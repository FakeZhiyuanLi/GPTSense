      Heloo.. I meant to write everyday. But due to time contraints and other obligations.. I promise I will find some time to write this. Somehow I feel this is soo therapeutic. I've been under a lot of stress lately. Renovating the house.. arranging furniture and stuff. The weekends are a total chore. Call me workaholic... but I do look forward to weekdays rather than weekends. Anyway, back to the topic at hand... How would you react when someone returns a glance at you. It's been so long since I've got responses from my glances that i totally freaked out. This cute chub I saw at this restaurant. He must be 20 , 100kg, 44 waist, Tan Malay look, adoring lips, big butt and firm ripe nipple to go nicely wrapped in the tight executive looking shirt. I was having lunch. He was sitting and waiting for his order. I glance at him ( its now second nature to do that). And WHALLA!! he give the same glance to me and smiled. Unexpectedly, I panicked and looked away. Should I too be smilling at this moment ??? Remorse evidently follows.... the bowl of "Yong Tau Foo" did quite taste the same.. I tried to look at him for the whole eating session.. but he didn't gave me second glance.  I always envy the yucky pickup lines in the popular gay series in the US "Queer As Folk".... "Hey! How issit goin". And the next minute they are in bed having raunchy sex. What is the correct pickup line in Malaysia ? From the mind "Apa khabar... ?" to the feisty "Saya taste kat awak".. down right to the dirty "Bang!.. isap konek". The weather is quite a good pickup line... but it's too cliche. ASL & Stats is too much of an IRC thing... Anyway, as I was going out of the restaurant and pass by him.. I used an old pickup line my friend taught me... "Macam kenal yea.. tapi kat mana kita jumpa ?"... YES it hits the spot!!! !!! And the rest is history in the making....

      Hi.. actually this is a backlog of a previous encounter I had. It was too weeks ago when I was shopping at the MP Shopping Complex. I was hanging out with the guys.. cruising some guys. Some are adorable ones like this one young chub.. he must be at least 16 - 18 years old. 7" tall at least and weight around 120kg. Clean face... and a gorgeous face that can make you saliva drool. God! I was in 7th heaven... anyway. He had this little stubles of facial hair..  you know..like it's just grown on him. Wonder how good that feels when it brushes on one's skin. Yikes! I'm day dreaming again... I kept looking at him hoping for a response..a wink.. a smile.. a gaze.. but nahhh.. it didn't happen. Well.. he had that str8 looking face anyway. But then.. one can never know these days... after watching a lot of Japanese chubby porn... I realize that str8 looking face does not mean he is actually str8 at all. Some of the porn actors looks so cute and damn str8 that I just got a little shocked when he suck cock. Of course they suck cock.. this is porn we are talking about. But hey!  certain thing needs assurance for me.. like this chub i saw earlier. Is he or is he not ? Should I go to him and ask him ? That also makes me wonder about myself. Are there any people watching at me and saying "He is damn str8.."  Sometimes I just wish there is a device or something that would beeps if he is gay. Being flashy or obvious is not exactly what I had in mind. But cruising for chubs... most of the times are frustrating... you know that you are attracted to them but at the same time you are afraid of their reaction when you open up to them. Scary and frustrating... well this is an after thought...

      Well.. this is my first entry..  Not much i can say... I went for a course and there i saw this beautiful chub named Zuhfri.. I sat beside him and pondering at this awsome girth. he was beautiful to look at.. he must be around 150kg 6"7' age around 30+.  Fair skinned, cute smile and a boyish look with a hint of chinese blood. A little small on the thighs but MAN!!!.. what a massive upper-body this guy has. Wonder if that leg of his could support those fat-tastic body. Big round and flabby all in the right places. I think he has a small cock judging from the size of his feet. Everytime he breath, I could almost smell his warm wet air coming out of his cute red nostrils. If he was a bottom.. I'd know what i would do to his massive flabby butt. My eyes kept looking at him.. i desire him. Unfortunately.. he is married and have children. Anyway.. I've got his phone number.. but do I have the courage to call him. Hmm..  we have to wait and see...

      Two weeks ago I was walking at the overhead bridge, spending my leisure time. My style getting out to strecth-out my over-worked body after several hours of driving. Taking a break at a windy place, waiting sunshine to fade at dawn attracts many population of city residence to take time-out to relax their minds.  Althoug the place looks crowded, because of the place is strech along the bridge makes it looks much open to walk around rather than spending staticly at one place. Many  comers are with families, spending their quality time. I was alone that time, as always, walking towards small stalls to buys some drinks, some junkies to overcome my hunger.   As waiting the moment of dawn, my eyes observe the surrounding, watching something that may eye-catching. Nothing new yet, kites flying throughout the skies, shouting, screamnig of childrens. People walking back and fro, groups of youngsters, couples and pets.  Walking through crowds does annoyying, have to avoid bumping others shoulders, avoid running childrens to run over me. I'm quite good at avoiding something. But skills don't always good !  "Ouchh !", a small yell coming somewhere I'm not sure. Hmm... , what I do wrong ? I stopped. Wondering what I'have done. Checking, no shoulders are bump. No childrens hurt. I realize I'm innocent.  "My fingers.", a groan heard, I turned around. I'have hurt somebody, somebody that i should apologize. I stepped a finger of a stranger, a stranger that I should seek earlier.   As the stranger looking at his cute, short fingers, matching his chubby body, round face, centre bald head at the age of late 40's.Children of 4. Concern about the hurt fingers, I intend to help, to sure that no swore or deep cut at the fingers.I sat beside the hurt stranger, making sure he's okay. I apologize of my disobience of carelessness.  Even the drama of apologize is over, I just sat the same spot, nothing to do, nothing to think. Watching the stranger children playing around, I began to open a convesation, asking the stranger's  schedule of visiting this place, when the correct time to come again. The stranger offer his beverage and some buns, I eate some. Short and open conversation began to arise between me and the stranger, lastly he offer to come to his place for dinner later, I agree.He gave his address, staying not far at this special place. He insist me to write down his address. I said, i just memorize. He not sure whether I could remember his  long address. Then, why not give contact numbers, that easier to memorize. He gave his contact number without  doubt. Damn I'am good at handling chubs.   Kapitan										11 July 2002 3:57pm

      Hi, first of all, thanks to moderator allowing me to write in this section, giving me the chance to write freely. Before starting a bit more, lets spending a moment knowing about me. Beginning with, I’m not a chub, sorry some may upset about this fact. Thought I’m not a chub @ slim, after knowing so much chubs, I realized that chubs nice to become a friend. I admire chubs from along time, since youngster.  Lets facts out about chubs first, of course they are cute, cuddling, fetish looks and best of all nice to hug. Their movement sometimes makes them more adorable.   Back to chubs encounters stories, I have many chubs encounters that I want to tell. Many of these stories are my own experiences, I encounter and approach chubs in correctly manners. Manners does matters in chubs encountering, the reason is that chubs are timid, easily disorder if the ways of approaching is done incorrectly.   Many my chubs encounters do success, the main reason is intension. Making friends are the best to last relationship with chubs, because chubs like to friend. Chubs feel lonely where ever they goes, it easily to spot a lonely chub. Yes, lonely chubs walk alone, wandering around looking something that easily catching their eyes, what ? Reflection ! yes, chubs wants to find a friend that are as same as himself. Many reason to this, among is, chubs usually feel down-hearted about their appearance, call fat. This chubs tend to find like their own size too because having same size is like having same feeling. Others chubs intend to find different reflection, a non-chub@slim. Why? Because this chub intend to be slim, unable and uncapable to be slim due to obesity, reason this chub approach to slim is express their feeling, how nice to slim and fit and even dreaming to be slim in further.   Okay, tells talk about manners, approaching to chubs has many ways, as mention above, manners mattes all. Chubs are easily tackle if the way of  approaching is correct. Tips: Lonely chubs. Chubs which are lonely is easily spotted, first step, smile. Simple nice smile does works. Done that ? Good. Okay, smiling to chubs is simple gesture of friendship. After smiling to the chubs, observe !.   Good ways of approaching and smiling produce happy results. Done that smiling, observe that chubs, usually that chubs re-act in disbelieve, pretending nothing happen and begins to look around whether he’s the one that been smile ?. After checking that no others and sure that he’s the only been smiled, that chubs will look back at you. What next ? Smile again and wave with your hand.   Then walk forward, intro yourself, talk nicely and remember, always smile. Offer high-tea, best place is at beaches and places of sight-seeing. Chubs usually like places that feel secure if this is his first-time. Make them feel secure, after a while, takes a walk. Do not express feeling too deeply at first meeting, do that later after several meeting. Remember, good manners, good smiles and good timing offer good friendship.

      Well.. it's been quite sometime since i wrote in here. It's not that i don't have any encounters. Just too numerous to write it all and i'm a little short of time. Anyway, there I was one day, at the day market. I was doing some grocery shopping on friday. I do admit that chubby encounters comes at the strangest places. I was walking back to my car with a bag full of groceries in one hand and my car keys in the other. Then I saw him... like thunderbolt rushing in my veins. A very handsome chubby man around his 30's. He was around 168cm 110kg with waist around 42 or 44. He had a fair skin and a cute goatee. He was also very well dressed. With neat shirt tuck in his very good fitting pants. Too well I suppose to be at the market. We share glances. I stopped and walk to his back. Adoring his massive body and good taste. I stood there behind him.. smoking my cigarette. I suppose he was waiting for his wife or something. I think he knew I was watching him as we share a few more glances. Then he walked to his card and stood there facing me. In the middle of the afternoon in the sun. Argghhh.. what should I do.. should i walk to him and say hi ? We both stood facing each other. The cigarette already burt out in my hands and i just could not move. Is he giving me the signal ? I swallowed a deep breath and slowly walk towards him. Eye to eye.. we gaze at each other. Then I panicked and walked the other way towards my car. Darn it.. !!! I just could not find the courage to even say hi. As i went inside the car.. i saw him in my rear view mirror. He went inside his car too and slowly drove off. Double darn.. he was waiting for me to make a move... he was not waiting for anyone else. I felt like a real loser. Sometimes I just wish with we can have a device which just can beeps if we meet someone we like. Like a keychain that we can signal to any plu that we could point if we like him. That would make things easier.. rather than looking for indefinate clues. Anyway to the guy driving proton MAD 4??. I think you are really cute chubby bear and if I had a second chance.. i would love to get to know you better. Beep me if possible...

      The thing you need to know is , its all about sex.. infact man think about sex every 28 second.! Ini ayat pertama bila saya menonton siri cerita Queer As Folk. drama PLU bersiri yang ditayangkan di TV america.  cuba kita bayangkan bertemu dengan seorang yang perfect pada diri kita. Apa yang selalunya bermain di fikiran. Mungkin pada pandangan pertama kita akan berfikir cutenya mamat ni. Geram tengok. Macammana agaknya kalau dapat peluk dan kiss. Hah! dari situ fikiran kemudian meneroka lebih jauh lagi, membayangkan dirinya yang paling menggairahkan pada pandangan kita. Contohnya membayangkan dia berbogel sambil mandi dan menampakkan bontot nya yang besar dan gebu. Kemudian kita bayangkan  bagaimana sedapnya dapat merasa lips to lips kiss sambil tangan memeluk erat badannya yang pejal dan gebu. Tangan merayap memegang benda 'tu' yang keras dan panas. Kemudian menghidu bau badanya yang sedap.   Kekadang bila difikirkan betul-betul ada juga kebenarannya. Kalau seorang str8 misalnya kemungkinan dia akan berfikir benda yang sama terhadap wanita, cuma mungkin persepsi terhadap sex ni berlainan sedikit. Mungkin dia mencari orang yang sesuai untuk di buat calon isteri. Jadi dia akan mencari kebaikan dan keburukan wanita itu dalam pelbagai segi. Ini berlaku setelah berkenalan dan berjumpa wanita itu beberapa kali. Tapi Plu persepsinya  memang jauh berbeza.Berapa ramai yang mengamalkan sex dulu sebelum bercinta dan menjadikannya so call  'boyfriend'. Selalunya chemistry dan minat ransangannya bermula dengan kuat apabila sesudah menjalinkan hubungan sex dengan pasangannya. Mungkin teknik dan caranya bermain  memang sesuai dan kena dengan apa yang diingini. Sebab itu boleh 'lekat lama'.  Hi semua. Salam perkenalan. Saya memang bukan seorang penulis.Tapi dengan wujudnya ruangan Blogger ni rasa ingin jugak mencuba cuba. Well someone has to start somewhere... Apapun  biar saya perkenalkan sapa diri saya dengan lebih 'clear' walaupun blur.   Badan gemuk, Ada misai ada janggut trim, muka bulat, suka senyum, kulit gelap gelap sikit, walaupun tak gelap sangat. Alah orang melayu biasa la. Rambut pendek, pinggang saiz 44inc. Saya sebenarnya meminati orang gemuk ni dah lama. Sejak azali lagi rasanya kot. Entahla mungkin saya sedar benda ni masa berumur 10 tahun. Tapi dalam sedar tak sedar rasanya perasaan minat tu wujud sebelum itu lagi. Cuma saya tak memahaminya. Perasaan itu bertambah kuat setelah saya meningkat dewasa.   Selalunya waktu kecil dahulu, apa yang saya buat ialah mengintai tetamu yang datang kerumah saya. Lubang melalui dinding rumah kayu dari bilik saya menjadi sasaran. Kebanyakan tetamu lelaki yang datang termasuk lah sanak saudara saya kebanyakannya gemuk gemuk. Dah memang genetic, terima jer la. Dari bilik saya, dapat melihat terus ke ruang tamu . Kalau saya mengintai selalunya posisi tetamu akan berdepan tepat dengan saya. Dari situlah saya melihat gerak geri seorang gemuk, melihat pergerakan dan bentuk badan yang menggairahkan.Yerlah bulat bulat. Kadang kadang ia boleh berlanjutan sampai kemimpi atau pun masa saya berangan. Berangan teringatkan chub yang saya tempuh atau tengok siang tadi.   Saya teringat masa mula-mula belajar naik basikal. Saya berkawan rapat dengan jiran saya. Namanya Ridzuan. Badanya memang gemuk, sama macam saya. Dia muda satu tahun dari saya. Kami sama-sama belajar naik basikal tiap tiap petang. Dia selalu tolong saya kalau jatuh dan memberi semangat untuk saya mencuba. Satu malam saya bermimpi tentang nya. Dia datang kepada saya dan saya memeluknya dengan erat. Masa tu saya rasa begitu istimewa. Lain dari yang lain. Sampai sekarang saya masih lagi ingat mimpi saya tu. Kami mula renggang tahun tahun berikutnya apabila saya memulakan pengajian sekolah pagi dan petang dan tiada masa untuk bermain.   Sekarang ni dia bekerja sebagai pemandu Van menghantar pekerja kilang. Kekadang bila saya balik kg masih lagi berbual bual bertanya kabar dengan nya. Orang nya masih lagi cute, gemuk dan mempunyai senyuman yang cukup manis. Dia masih belum kahwin. Mana tahu satu hari nanti saya dapat ber.. ekhhemmm ker.. who knows.. In the meantime just hope that day would come OK lah nanti saya sambung lagi cerita masa kecil kalau ada yang berminat. wassalam p/s: any comment contact me chub4chub2000@yahoo.com

      A LOVE STORY THAT FAILED!  Hello again!  Apa khabar semua?  Wow......tentang lovers!  Dalam hal ini, kita semua kena berhati-hati.  Tapi nasib setiap orang tak sama!   Pada tahun lepas, saya telah jumpa beberapa orang online.  Semuanya di mychub chatroom di MIRC.  Tapi , yang peliknya, semua yang saya jumpa ada dari universiti.  Saya telah jumpa beberapa student....ada dari USM, ada dari UM, tapi tak rasa apa-apa terhadap mereka.  Saya ingin ceritakan tentang satu perjumpaan.  Dia ni seorang cub dari UPM!  Tentu jumpa di mychub chatroom.  Saya telah jumpa dia di Sogo, KL pada hari yang ditetapkan.  Baik orangnya.  Saya tak tahu kerana dia boleh tertarik pada saya!  Memang selepas itu, saya selalu naik ke KL untuk jumpa dia.  Tiap-tiap minggu saya mesti jumpa.  Ialah...orang yang tengah bercinta.  Tapi tak lama selepas itu, dia mula minta duit.  Ialah budak u...saya pun kesian.  Beri ajalah.  Selepas dia dapat apa dia nak, dia dah mula tepikan saya!  Eh...geramnya saya!  Saya masih ingat pada awal tahun ini.  Itu kali petama dia melakukan ini.  Seperti dijanjikan, saya sampai di KL.  Saya call dia.  Dia kata dia akan jumpa malam aja.  Saya tunggulah.  Tak tahu apa nak buat lagi!  Tunggu aja...dia tutup handset dia.  Dari pukul 11.30, saya call tapi tak dapat.  Malam itu tak tidur.  Ingat apa yang terjadi!  Accident ke?    Selepas itu, dia hilang macam tu.  Dapat e-mail sekali aja!  Dia minta saya untuk biarkan dia.  Saya tak tahu kemana.  Dia tak akan ambil phone call saya.  Saya pun naik ke KL setiap minggu untuk cuba cari tapi tak dapat.  Saya dapat pada suatu hari bila saya di KL.  Talifon dari public.  Dia tak sangka itu saya!   Jawab.  Lepas itu puas saya marah dia.  Yang peliknya, selepas itu, dia nak baik semula.    Dia mula hubungi saya.  Dia pun minta saya belanja untuk pergi tengok FAME di Istana Budaya!  Saya pun bodoh.  Dulu dah kena, sekarang beri lagi.   Selepas itu, sekali-sekali da terima e-mail dari dia.  Tapi baru-baru ini, dia kata dia ada 'adik angkat'!  Tak puas saya!  Handphone dia pun dah tak boleh pakai.  Tapi silapnya, dulu bila nak baik semula, dia beri nombor rumahnya pada saya!  Saya dapat tahu nombor handset dia baru ini.  'Adik angkatnya" berikan!  Ini tak betul.  Dia tak nak cakap yang dia ada hubungan dengan budak ini.    Hari itu, saya paksa dia jumpa saya.   Saya dapat tahu semua darinya.  Tapi saya masih ingat berapa angkuh dia pada hari itu.   Dia kata dia tetap akan bayar apa yang dia ambil dari saya!  Dia tanya berapa.  Saya buka mulut...terperanjat dia.  Mana dia nak dapat duit, dia tanya saya.  Ialah dia baru habis uni..belum kerja lagi.  Kena bayar loan lagi.  Tapi dia kata dia tetap dia tetap akan baayar dan keluar dari bilik hotel saya.  Hampir satu jam selepas dia keluar, dia talipon saya dan menangis.  Dia minta saya halalkan!  Tadi saya marah....mana nak halalkan sekarang?  Tetapi selepas beberapa hari, saya talipon dia dan beritahu yang saya akan halalkan.  Orang melayu ada carakan....saya dah nak halalkan...dia tak nak jumpa pulak.   Dah berapa kali call dia, tak ada jawapan.  Tak tahu nak buat apa dengan dia.  Saya harap dia akan jumpa saya sebelum ramadhan yang akan datang ini.  Saya harap kita berpisah dengan baik.  Dia dah ada teman baru, saya tak nak jadi orang ketiga.   Apa lagi saya nak buat???

      Hi semua mashimaro lagi hari ni...!! selamat datang diucapkan kepada lydon penulis baru bloger kita ini .. cerita pertama beliau jugak agak menarik perhatiam mashimaro, daripada benci sanggat kat orang tu akhirnya dia akan jadi sayang plak .. ni memang pernarh berlaku pun dalam sejarah  ... hihihihi... wah kelas sejarah plak! .. well macam mana kalau terover sayang plak? pernah anda mendengar situasi sebegini... well situasi begini memang wujud dalam kehidupan seorang gay, apabila kita memjumpai taste yang memang serasi ngan kita, maka kitra akan jatuh cinta ngan nyer secepat mungkin... akan tetapi setiap hubungan turut mempunyai geloranya dari mana2 pihak, bagi seorang yang terover sayangkan partnernyer beliau akan sanggup membuat apa je yang diorang mampu agar dapat menjayakan hubungan tersebut dan kerana ini ler masalah mula timbul. Sebagai seorang gay yang mature kononnyer sesiapa yang lebih tua dalam pasangan itu akan mengambil peranan untuk membetulkan keadaan. hidup berpasangan ni memang banyak cabarannya kita harus cuba berusaha untuk menjayakan hubugan tersebut dan bukan fikirkan tenteng diri kita sahaja kerana sikap pentingkan diri sendiri adalah punca sesuatu hubugan itu rentak dan perasaan kasih sayang itu hilang . Bila sudah sampai tahap ini jikalau salah seorang daripada mereka masih tidak sedar maka mereka akan hanyut dalam kepura-puraan yang dicipta oleh diri sendiri dan ini akan membinasakan diri sendiri jugak!!!! . Oleh itu... good luck lover everywhere !! may all of you are fighting a good fight !! to maintain your relationship in this confusion and cruel world!!! take care everyone!

      Hello semua!  Saya ni baru masuk group blogger ni.  Cerita di sini semua menarik.  Saya ingin ceritakan tentang minat saya kepada orang chub.  Saya ni dah tahu saya ni gay sejak saya umur 18, bila saya pertama kali berada hubungan dengan lelaki lain.  Tetapi selepas itu, saya tidak minat langsung pada orang yang chub.  Pada masa itu, saya rasa orang chub adalah orang yang paling tak taste, tak minat langsung.  Ialah, masa tu kita pun dah muda dan senang nak dapat mangsa.  Sampai saya masih ingat lagi.  Ada seorang dari UK.  Umur saya dalam lingkungan 25.  Dia tinggi dan dari luar, tak nampak macam chub.  Pakai jaket dan bergaya tu.  dia ajak saya ke rumahnya.  Ikut jer.  Nak bayar!   OK lah tu.  Ikut.  Bila dah ada dalam bilik, baru saya nampak bentuk badan dia.  Tak minat saya.  Tapi apa nak buat.  Dia nak bayar.  Haruslah ikut apa dan nak.  Masa itu, baru dia ajar saya bagaimana nak memuaskan dia.  Itu cerita lain.  Selepas itu, pandangan saya terhadap orang chub dah tertukar.  Tapi kalau ada pilihan lain, saya akan pilih seorang yang bukan chub.  Tak tahu bagaimana saya terjumpa dengan seorang chub diSingapore..  Ini adalah dalam 15 tahun dulu.  Dia tu merasa sedih.  Orang semua pilih.  Setiap kali saya tengok dia, semua orang tak nak.  Saya pun  kesiankan.   Satu hari saya pun pergi cakap dengan dia.   Selepas itu, dia ajak saya pergi dengan dia.  Mungkin saya ikut kerana kesiankan dia.   Selepas itu, kami berdua boleh menjadi kawan rapat.  Selepas berapa kali projek dengan dia,  saya pun dah minat dengan chub.  Sekarang dia bekerja di KL.  Mungkin orang chub akan kenal dia.  Tapi setiap kali saya jumpa dengan dia di KL,  kita akan keluar makan sebagai kawan.    Saya pun dah banyak pengalaman dengan chub selepas itu.  Tapi saya akan tetap ingat kawan yang mengajar saya untuk menyukai seorang chub.  Itulah semua, kalau awak rasa ada sesuatu yang awak benci atau tidak menyukai, jangan terlalu benci.  Nanti suatu hari, awak akan tetap suka atau sayang apa yang awak benci dulu.

       hi everone mashi maro is back!!........ wah moks cerita pasal kisah silam siot sanggat menyentuh hati, well kita semua pun being there before right i know i have ...... saya rasa saya start lambat because sebelum ini fikiran saya, apabila saya tertarik pada seseorang lelaki yang taste is because i amired his acheivement(eh betul ker ejaan maro ni!!) lepas tu i got my first wet dream ngan pakcik saya sendiri, selepas ari tu je bila je nampak mana-mana chub, sesiapa je, cikgu ker  sampai ler pengetua sendiri pun bleh stim.. maro time tu tak bleh terima so maro pun masuk asrama mubaligh  kira nak find the answer ler... but there i find myself to accept what i am .. maro pikir how ever or to who ever we love it does not matter, what matter is how true your love is........ so kat tempat asal maro menjadi seorang gay memang mencabar to think about it.. it is dangerous being a gay there so maro kene cover gila-gila punya...but bila maro dah sambung belajar kat sini (KL) i am free i can even tell my house mate(who is also gay) that i am gay and we can really be open ...but also still in the closet cause we are bond under the gorverment .. and when i am here i found someone so special that at one time i thought would be imposible.....opps masa tak cukup mashimaro got to go so maybe latter i sambung balik okey... take care everyone.....!!!!!!!

      Hi, moks here. Wow.. seems like mashimaro has lots of fresh encounters that just I couldn't help to join. Well,  mine not really an encounter but more like a revelation. I started to notice chubby guys when I was in standard 1. Early huh!. I used to have this crush on a chubby classmate of mine. I had read in an encyclopedia that this urge was called "Gay". So that's when I knew i was gay, but of course, didn't act on that urge that burned deep down, so what did i do? Suppress it....For years. So yeah...i tried to put it in my head that i wasn't gay, you know the whole spell. So this act lasted throughout my whole school years. Even though i checked out some cuties around school, i just didn't think i was gay. I even thought i really liked this girl. And to be honest, you know, if she said yes when i asked her to be my girl...i might be with her right now. But lets not go too deep into that. I am what i am.  Then I went to the University. Everynight, when i went to bed, I couldn't fall asleep. I would lie in bed, and stare, and stare and stare...For hours, till finally i would fall asleep cause i was soo tired. That or i would cry myself to sleep. Either way it sucks big time, and im not talking about in the good way. I don't know where I belong. I would lie there and just rack my brain and think to myself, "There's no such thing as fat gay guys." I didnt fit into the stereotypical "gay" guy. I was fat. I mean look at TV...do they ever portray a gay male as a chubby guy? Where was John Goodman' hot body,?!?! Nowhere to be found. Not in the tv/movie media sense. So to me...i felt as if i was some sort of outcast...a freak, weirdo...fat ass fag. Whatever...all of that was eating me inside, and i was a grumpy. So that's why my life consisted of, eat, sleep, shit, work, go fuckin insane...cry. My daily routine.  Then came my savior. Thank God for the Internet. Because of sites like Mychub, Chubnet.com and other sites like that...I came to find out that, "Hey, I'm not the only gay fat guy around here." Holy shit did that make me feel better. I just wanted to scream out..."I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE!!!!!!" That's a huge weight that was lifted off of me, and damn it felt good. I mean i wasnt out of the clear yet, but knowing that I'm not the only one like me, i felt alright. I felt I belong somewhere. It feels good all inside.    So if you guys ever had the same experience and wants to share with us, we would love to hear it - e-mail to:  urlLink mychub@time.net.my     (thank you to a good friend - Kurt a.k.a KuJo from mysticinsanity.org - adapted from your log - FYI we all felt the same way)

      hi semua apa khabar hari ni ? ... ni mashimaro kembali lagi ... sebenarnya nak sambung cerita chef ari tu tapi hari ni mashi maro nak cerita pasal seorang plu ynag bunuh diri kerana dia tak bleh nak terima diri dia sebagai plu, mashimaro kenal dengan seorang pakcik tempat mashimaro belajar , dia atenden kat sana , semalam anak buahnya bunuh diri entah kenapa, dia tidak meninggalkan sebarang nota atau pesanan terakhir, ia menjadi misteri sebab pada biasanya seseorang yang membunuh diri akan meniggalkan pesanan terakhir mereka atau apa yang mereka tak puas hati ngan dunia ni, so mashimaro pun pergi ler bertanya kat family dia  actually what happen !!, family dia kata dia seorang yang rajin belajar dan aktif dalam sukan, cuma dia ni pendiam sikit , bila ditanya kalau dia ada kawan rapat , family dia cuma kata yang dia rapat ngan coach dia , menurut pakcik dia he it a bit soft then the rest of his cousin dan itu ler telah mngesahkan yang he is a plu , cause i seen this case before , where i came from !, a star student killing himself because he cannot bare the presure of admitting that he was falling in love with his teacher, the presure grow inside him then POP he is gone. sometime bila mashimaro pikir tentang semua ni , tentu ada banyak lagi mereka yang baru dalam dunia plu ni yang berada dalam kebingungan mencari jawapan kepada semua persoalan dalam pikiran mereka, adakah saya ni gila? jatuh cinta dengan seorang lelaki? banyak lagi contoh soalan yang mungkin timbul, kita yang well bernasib baik ni, telah berjaya mengharungi semua itu dan sekarang selesa dengan cara hidup kita tapi untuk budak budak tu macam mana? sometime we all need to think about it, when we see these young kids dont think they are only "anak ikan" some of them need guidance in these new world  of alternatif lifestyle .. please anyone out there think about this okey !!!!  bye for now take care

      hi apa khabar para pembaca sekalian saya mashimaro ahli terbaru blog ni, hihihihihihi well apa nak tulis dalam blog pertama saya okey well saya nak tulis tentang pendapat saya tentang "LTR" or long term relationship , well kita jumpa ramai orang dalam webpage ni dalam chat dan hihihi di mana saja yang berkenaan cehwaahhh!!!!, sebenar kita ni nak cari apa, sex je ker? kalau macam tu "ONS" sound very nice right tapi ada diantara kita yang bukan cari sex jer! hairan? well sebenarnya ia memang wujud pun ada diantara kita yang mencari teman untuk di buat bf , someone we can hugg, kiss and well know that is not only for one time but could be forever , sebenarnya "LTR" bawa maksud apa yer ? well pendapat saya maksudnya ialah hubugan jangkamasa yang panjang sama seperti hubugan suami isteri dalam hubugan heterosexual so sama seperti dalam hubugan hetero saya juga fikir the same rule apply in that, just a bit advance than the normal one hihihihi , saya selalu dengar  satu kaul yang dilafazkan semasa sepasang suami isteri berkhawin , "from health to sick, from rich to poor  thill death do us part" well kalau kita tak mungkin ler sampai mati sebab well kaum lelaki tak akan cuma stick to one forever , face it we guys can never commit that long to someone that why i say tha kita ni advance sikit , some couple keep an open relationship which is very cool , they can see other people although the are bf to each other, for me that just fine just as long as he dont tell me about it , what i meant is that hey as long as i have a place in your heart who ever you were with i dont care!! just hey i hope you have protection while doing it hihihihihihihi!!!!!! hey that all i have to say for now ! ada masa banyak lagi nak cerita okey ciao!!!!!!!!!!! hihihih

Been there a couple of times.   Anyway, the language is rather similiar to Malay.   Anyway, that was a past of my life!    I hope you will contribute to this column more regularly.

      WHAT ATTRACTS YOU MORE TO MEN?  Ima say.....physical handsomeness is of minor importance.  I am much more interested in the TOTAL person, the mind, the heart and the emotions.  I believe that it is the sensual and passionate emotions that stimulates the act of making love, not the size of the cock between two people.  Sexuality is born in the mind, not in the genitals.  I dont know about you guys but I have a rather strong sex drive when I am with someone who stimulates my mind and openly desire to share the act of making love.  Anyway, I cant even remember how I convinced my ex-BF to have sex with him for the first time.  I know I entered into some sort of arrangement.....or was it just a plain "gratis" knowing the fact that we both have the same taste for a guy? In other words, chub for chub, in BISAYA (w/c happens to be my dialect spoken) "tambok para sa tambok" and of course "gemuk for gemuk" in malay.  But anyway, I definitely had my moments.

      One unforgettable encounter/experience happened during the debut party of my friend back a couple of years ago.  Tracy Anne, a very good friend of mine and someone i actually grew-up with was making headlines in the society pages of Cebu City (PHI) and everyone from school dreamt to have this model for Dexter Alazas, a local designer, as her escort.  Well too bad for her that this "hot" model everyone was craving for phoned an hour earlier before the party started and said that he cant make it to the party due to emergency reason......hhhhhmmmm......what an ALIBI!  So no choice but to have Tracy Anne's cousin as a replacement.  Luckily, he did not refuse and.......not to mention that he's a very cute chubby guy, straight and is full of aura which i cant took an eye off with him while dancing Waltz with the celebrant.  Ohhhh how I'd wished that I was the debutant instead of my friend Tracy having a gorgeous big guy as my escort......Seriously!  And as of now, he still exist but only in my dreams.  Finding a quality chubby guy is my frustration but I have no regret on that.  It's just my fate that doesnt allow me to have one :(  But it doesnt also mean that im going to give up.  KAYA KO YATA TO PRE!

      Our young and talented writer - chubmashimaro a.k.a JoeChub a.k.a Chubbycub40 has met with a motorcycle accident (29/10/02). Although things looks pretty bad now. Has has gone through 7 hours of surgery... 6 stiches on the head and a metal plate in his arms, bruises on the face and body. MyChub reps (GemuK, Abu & Riez) were there with his mother who had flown from Sabah that very morning. When he finally woke up, It brought tears to our eyes when he said he would like to write his experience in this blog, and ask readers to wish him well. To all friends who are sincere to visit/donate - the address is UH, Wad 9U, Bed 32. To anyone who knew him, pls don't bother to call his handphone as it was stolen in the accident. Lets all pray for his life and hope that he will get better and stronger. We love your works and the sunshine you have sprinkled into our lives.

      Kapitan menulis lagi…  	Setelah sekian lama kap tidak menulis, kalo nak dikira alasanya.. memang manusia ada sahaja alasannya.. tak usah di tanya.  Kali ini muncul tiada sebab, cuma ada yang tertanya mana kap menghilang. Kap tidak kemana, sentiasa ada… cuma tak nampak jer. Biasa lah.. tak chub.. mana nampak. Ada mengatakan, kalo nak carik kap… dia ada kat sebalik tiang… hah! kalo tak ada… kira tiang tu kapitan lah tu… kira sedara dia jugak. Tiang tipon, tiang letrik, tiang post, tiang traffic dan segala-gala tiang tu kira kroni-kroni kapitan… itu kata-kata mereka. Yang ter’latest diorang cakap, kap jadik model iklan Boneeto tu… itulah menampilan kapitan yg terkini. Boneeto ! …… boleh jadik hero katakan. Kapitan memang hero … tak nafi lah.   Hmm… tu lah… ingatkan jadik chub kena ejek gak… tak chub pun sama. Tapi tak mengapalah… itu kira satu gurauan…  	Itulah kesimpulan nya… chub ker tak chub ker… sama, masing-masing manusia. Ada gemuk dan ada yang tak gemuk. Yang tak gemuk tu kapitan yang gemuk-gemuk tu pun chub kapitan. Koleksi………….. Satu insiden lah yg terkini… itu bukan cerita penemuan chub… ini yang sebalik nya… cerita chub menemu yg tak chub…. Yang chub tu… si chub lah, yang tak chub tu kapitan. 	Pada suatu hari………. kap pi makan… bersama dengan seorang chub… err  nama dirahsiakan. Masa tu tengah makan tengahari ler, chub yang bersama kap yang ingin blanja. Kap masih tidak mengerti mengapa chub gemar blanja kap makan. Mungkin faktor bila blanja kap, murah rezeki di masa depan… agak nya ler. Atau mungkin mereka sangka kap makan pun tidak seberapa banyak sangat pun… Dalam tengah-tengah rancak bersantap, tetiba-tiba muncul seorang daddy chub muscular lah camtu… makan kat gerai tu… berseorangan. Duduk berhadapan dan bertentangan. Kap pandang maut… dia pun buat pandang lain… beser ler… tak payah ajar pun tahu. Dalam hati kap… seperti pernah nampak jer daddy chub ni… tapi di mana ya !?? Pasti kap pernah  jumpa daddy chub.  Selepas daddy chub abis makan… dia bayar. Kap nak bayar kan .. tapi disebabkan  kaunter bayar itu jauh … tak jadi nak bayarkan. Betul… kaunter bayar tu jauh….. kalo hujur tangan nak bayar memang tak sampai… kira jauh lah tu, tangan tak sampai.  Selepas daddy chub tu dah tunai kan bayaran tu… dia lalu depan kapitan…lalu bercakap secara kuat hampir boleh dengar satu kedai.  	“ Kau kenal aku… kau  buat-buat tak kenal yer !” … daddy chub ulangi ayat tu dua kali berturut-turut. Kap cool jer…………….. Dia berlalu… lalu menaiki kereta nya. Kap senyum jer………… Ooo… bekas koleksi chub kapitan rupanya. Baru kap teringat.   Kapitan 30 Dec 2002 4:46pm

      Hi there.  Well yesterday, Thursday I was in one of the chat rooms of gay.com.  Anyway, I was talking a few people, and I had a message from a guy.  We got talking.   I was impressed to hear he was about 1.8 m and weighed about 120 kg.  After chatting some time, he gave me his handphone number.  He was going on his coffee break so asked me to call him.  I called him.  He sounded very nice.  He asked me if I could meet him after work.    We arranged a place.  i was skeptical.  Would I be able to recognise him and he me?  The time came and well yes that was him.  It was raining heavily.  He recognised me too.    As it was raining very havily, he was caught in the rain.  So was I.  Not much later he said he was feeling unwell, and there was a slight fever coming up.  Anyway, as we had already arranged to meet, we took a cab to a shopping centre and sat down at a Coffee Bean for coffee.  It was a sort of get to know you session.  I enjoyed it.  He wants to get togethr again next week for further action.  I am quite amazed that I managed to get a chub in a chat room.

      In regards to chubmashimaro's latest entry, there is only on thing i could say to it bro.  "You're getting more aggressive with your spanish lesson."  Although I can never seem to understand the article which you wrote to its fullest, but its pretty obvious that you've met a nice chubby guy again - - this time with a true spanish descent (am I right? hopefully).  Good for you then but hey, you got yourself a new friend, so was I, just that he's an asian.  It was Friday night, parties were happening everywhere in Cebu in celebration for the annual SINULOG feastival.  Foreigners are flocking around in the city and there's no bigger community here but JAPS.  In fact, i'd met one at the Ayala Center (a local mall).  Rate?  Honestly, im not good in rating people.......but for everyone's sake, OK!  Assuming he's 8.5/10 (base on my taste of course) about 28-30 yrs of age, 5'6, 120KG, bald, clean shaven and got the hairiest chest i'd ever saw (was wearing a polo - - unbuttoned top).  He was standing next to me while watching the live band playing.  So i'd approached him first and greeted him the usual "HI" (inspired by chubmashimaro).  I was just trying my luck you know, and it worked!  With that, i am forever grateful to you bro.  Anyway, he invited me for a drink.  Well, it took me 5 minutes to say yes.  Why?  I was thinking if he might be one of the Yakuza's and going to slash my head off with a samurai.  Well, just a thought.  LOL.  Come what may! he seemed to be a gentle person, and the fact that we both have no one to share the fun with.  And so we did have a couple of bottles consumed and a few talk of course.  To tell you, I really had a hard time communicating with him because he's not that good in english, but mind you, he's one hell of a rich guy.  He's the son of the owner of Mitsumi Group of Companies (Jap Engineering Company).  Now I dont want to sound like someone who's a social climber but i think he's cool.  I also found out that he's straight and definitely not like us:  a playboy instead.  The funny thing is that he invited me to go with him to a nude bar.   And i declined.  I could never imagine myself watching to a girl performing a lap dance in front of me. hahaha.  Time is always and will always be an alibi.  It was very late in the evening or early morning - - 2:30 a.m. (whatever that goes on) and I really need to go home and have some rest.  He gave me a business card as if i am an associate/client, and i left.  It was indeed a fun and to be cherished moment.

      It's not too late to wish everyone 'Happy New Year', I hope.  May all your wishes will come true, and may u have already fulfilled last year's resolution.  I celebrated new year at Nuovo, Kuala Lumpur becoz a DJ was there (Joey Negro aka Jakatta) who played creme and 'house'-y music.  Cover charge was RM60 per person with 2 drinks.  Twas almost full house, and Jalan P Ramlee outside was full of people also.  Across the road over at Emporium there's this drag show on podium, which I later found out was 'Mardi Gras 2002/2003'.  Apparently glitters.com performed somewhere on the the streets as well....  Met a new friend a few weeks before through the net.  Decided to meet up for a drink and more real-time face-to-face chat.  A bloody nice guy, I would say, almost too good to be true (well, that's what I always said when I get to know new people, but this one is the best so far).  A Malay bear (woof!), 170, no idea about his weight, has more than 18 hairs per square inch on his arm, wears glasses, short hair, great smile, stuble.  Or try to picture Santa Claus minus 40 years.  We chatted about everything from music to movies over a cuppa coffe and a plate of 'nasi lemak' (which he finished in about 2.30 min, I like people who enjoy food!).  "Errr, why do you like chubbies?"  "Dunno, I must have f**ked-up my brain or something.  No-lah, may be I like what the images of chubs represent, sort of like a happy personality" "But not all chubbies are happy all the time" "I know, maybe I like what they represent.  Confident funny witty chubs turn me on, especially those in Armani business suits and BMW M5s.  Hahaha.  Ok, so that one is a joke.  My point is, attraction to physical is one thing, but personality or intelligence is another." "But why chubs?" "Uhhh, why not chubs? If I wanted a slim,might as well I jack-off in front of the mirror or something. Hehehe.  Maybe I'm attracted to something different from me. Maybe.  Beauty lies on the eye of the beholder, dear.  It's not like I don't find Brad Pitt, or Antonio Sabato or Marcus Schenken-whatever not attractive.  I do.  But I don't find them desirable.  At most, I would want to be like them, but I don't want them.  At least, I would picture them as rivals.  But I CAN identify a good-looking guy.  I believe I'm not a psycho or a fetish." "Hmm.. ok... whatever.  Err, where do you wanna go after this?"

      Hi!  Apa khabar semua?  Mashimaro seems to be having a good time!  Well, for me not much to report.  I met a guy whom I used to know a few years ago in Singapore.  I was walking around looking for a cinema.  I suddenly saw this guy.  I knew him about 4 yeas ago.  He was the boyfriend of one of my girl friends.  He was tall then, and did not look very chub then.  But on Tuesday when I saw him I was so shocked.   He had put on a lot of weight.  Now, he would be 175 cm, weigh about 120 kg, waist 42 inches.  Last time his waist was about 36 inches.  Anyway, we started talking.  Talked about old times.  I discovered he was no longer with my friend.    As I had my friends waiting for me, I told him I would have to meet him another day.  We exchanged numbers.  I discovered he has recently been retrenched.  He is a malay guy.  I told him I would try to meet him for lunch next week.  But on second tthoughts, I think I will make it dinner.If he agrees.  Let us see what happens later!    Catch you later!

      Oh what a vacation it was (christmas 2002).  Probably the best i ever had so far.  WHY?  Two reasons that made the season the most speacial one (beside from the usual celebration, holiday treats, presents etc.....)  It took place in my hometown where it still does'nt have the comfort of big city living to this date.  Internet is not even heard of.  It is purely devoid of modern infrastructures or amenities.  According to an old friend, it is a place where the people matters the most.  Anyway, firsts things firsts.  It so happend that i wasnt able to visit my hometown for quite a while (at least a year).  And i found out that there are already the so called "MORMONS" (foreign missionaries) flocking around the town.  Most of them are very good looking as in my type of big guys.  Interesting part? naaaahhhh........they're just vitamins to my eyes.  And honestly speaking, everytime i see them, i always get hard. hahaha  Anyway, moving on to the next part.  My Ex-BF came back from the states.  He's been there for almost 4 years (meaning, im having abstinence on that certain period of time).  When i first knew that he came back to our town, its like no big deal for me at all.  But when i saw him, well, he gave me a shock!  He got those facial hairs, the beard plus he had gained tad enough weight just as i like it. (damn he's fine)  We never had sex but we did talked.  He shared some of his experiences while he's New York where he considers that place as the metropolis of all metropolis (sounds interesting huh).  And as for me, i told him about my latest outback in MYCHUBS, where the guys are just as gorgeous! dashing in every way...without even trying.  He even laughed at me when i told him that they had the impression I am of spanish descent (specially chubmashimaro) hence my first name "Alfredo" untill they saw my picture.  LOL  Ones again, I definitely had my moments. Thats it for now, 'til next time. Happy New Year to each and everyone.

      "So apa kamu buat kat sini?"  tanya pakcik tu. (Err... membuat pasu bunga?) "Saja buang masa... dah lepas urut ni bagi keluar peluh pulak..."  "Ooo.. ye ke... hehehe.  Kamu ni Melayu rupanya iyer? Camana urut tadi? OK? Kamu ambik sapa tadi? Dah lama sampai?" tanya pakcik tu lagi.  Mid-40s, salt and pepper hair, plump without being too chubby, burly without being stocky, trying to look serious but his hands kept scratching the wooden panels... the nervous malu-tapi-mau type probably... I don't know whether he's trying to be friendly or actually interested to know my answers. "OK, biasa aja.  Kalau sakit badan bebetul saya ambik Salman atau Ah Kau, kalau sesaja nak releks badan nak tidur saya ambik Shahrin.  So, arini ambik Shahrin."  "Oic, betul cakap kamu, I ambik Salman tadi, selalunya kalau nak ambik dia kena book awal2, kalau tak lambat le kena tunggu... lagipun dia urut semua sekali... semua sekali". (Uh-huh... napa nak stress last sekali tu ekk? Nak suruh aku tanya ke? Koserss.. taula ko cute) "Oic, bagusla camtu... so, selain sini abang gi mana lagi ekk? Ada tempat2 bleh rekomen tak?"  "Ada tu ada, tapi jarang ke tempat lain.  Rghupa kedai2 tu lain skit.  Kedai nampak open sangat, lepas tu yg pergi semua muda2 lembut2, rasa tak selesa.  Kat Subang ada, kat Selayang ada..." (Rghupa? Rupa?  Orang Perak ke ni? Jauh berjalan bang?! Hehehhe... Eh? Tak suka lembut2? Abang ke akak ni? Hiskk... ok gak akak ada misai nih... hmmm) "Oooo... paham2..."  "So Shahrin urut semua sekali jugak ke?"  (Ha'a... napa? Nak demo ke? Ke nak tolong bagi demo?) "Iyer, urut bebetul le, takla urut lebih2 yang lebih2... heheh".  (Dia cakap dengan aku nih, tapi tgk tmpt arang batu tu pulak, bad eye contact tul, camana la nak jadik businessman?)  "Oooo.. so belum lagi la ni?" (Belum? Belum apa la ni? Belum beli TV warna ke? Koserla soalan2 matematik nih) "Ha'a.. belum lagi..."

      yesterday was not a perfect day to begin with.  Went for my 2nd parking test at Ulu Langat and had miserably failed.  I went out and knocked down a pole, pretty smart eh?....anyway, feeling down like hell and everything seems very wrong in every way after that.  So I went home and called everybody that I could think of and blabbered about my shortcomings, not that they care but I had to tell evryone so i can get it out from my system.  I was a bit calm after the 8th call and proceeded to gay.com after a friend suggested to me on hooking up with anybody just for comfort and a little bit more.  So there I was just parking my nick and playing trivia at mirc and after about half an hour somebody ping me, well..what can i say...this guy was really aggresive in his approach and somehow deep down i was quite intrigued.  But after several lines, i detected something funny about his chat line, i noticed that he kept on saying dear this dear that as if it sounded so endearing, well not to me, thank you very much.  He wanted a meeting over coffee and I told him that I wasnt interested in having mere coffee and I couldnt be bothered to go all the way to KL for that cuppa.  He insisted and told me how he adored my pic and went on describing things which was so flattery to me that I eventually agreed but I told him the meeting should be at my house and not at some coffee joint or a hotel as he had proposed.  He agreed immediately and told me to wait for him for apprixomately an hour.  Before he log off he mentioned to me that he was good looking with mix parentage and have a VERY nice body for he often frequented Dynasty hotel gym facilities.  I was obviously smitten with the fact (as he had presented to me) that I would be meeting a 37 year old good looking hunk.  Before anything, I have warned him that I'm a chub and told him not be dissapointed if I wasnt something that he would have expected.  He told me he's quite cool with chub guys and told me that my body size doesnt count, it was my demeanour that attracted him in the very first place.  So it was settle then, we agreed to meet and I caution him that I wasnt up for any sex or it's equivalent, he said ok, he just want to be with me and have an eye to eye meeting with me.  After we finished chatting, I felt quite ecstatic and the things i said about not having sex with him, well it was just pure puny lie, hell, who in this world would decline sex when a sex object is infront of him.  I did my usual routine of cleaning myself up and stuff and smiling to myself silly.  Well, he did arrived at the supposed time he promised and with just one look I could tell it was him for he was not as manly as he described he was and the best part was that he didnt have a great body (he told me more than seven times that he possess an envious body thx to his gym routine).  Hell, what the feck should i do at that time? ask him to go back to his home and said goodbye? It was the lie about his appearance that gutted me the most, i dont fecking mind if you're fat or slim, just fecking tell me the truth about your self, dont make me live with false hope and false fantasy and how do you expect me to carry out the fantasy when the make-believe wasnt there. I greeted him and invited him inside my house, and he got the nerve to ask me this : you like my great body baby?  This is over-confident to the max man, his tummy itself is as flabby as mine, and he was as melayu as melayu get, what with the chinese look claim?  He proceeded to tell me that he was horny and ask me where the bedroom was. In my mind i was like saying to myself: do I have to deal with this?  I told him that I'm not up for sex and just want to have conversation as he had earlier proposed during our chat session.  He paused for a while, then he said ok, let's talk in your bedroom.  I should have seen it coming, but me being me reluctantly agreed to enter my bedroom with him.  and he told me that my room is quite hot and he needed to undress in order to make himself comfortable.  Can I say no? so there he was half naked and on my bed and keep on saying, come on baby, come to me baby let's make love baby.......what the feck is that?  I told him off and ask him to leave but he resisted, he then said to me; 'if you dont want to make love to me, the least you can do is suck my cock'  the nerve! anyway, i told him nicely that I'm just not in the mood and instead I swiched on my computer and show him some gay movies that I have downloaded.  So he just sat quietly and stroke while watching the movie while i dont know what to do sit at the end of one corner and just remain clueless. I thought to myself, i have to get rid of him fast, he will obviously leave whenever he managed to cum.  But after the third movie, he was still strong and there was no sign of him cumming.  So I did the unthinkable, I went to him and grab his cock and started to you know what until he cum.  He's one clever bugger.  He left after that and as soon as he left my house, suddenly i felt it, i felt really really horny....while i was doing him, i didnt feel much of anything, just like an obligatory things to do in order for an objective to be achieved.  At that moment i was up for anything, then, i received a call...and this call really made up my day.....i'm out now maybe i would continue about the call and its eventful result tomorrow......bye

      Hello.  Apa khabar semua?   Well, last weekend, minggu ketiga, cutikan?  Saya telah pergi ke kuantan untuk jumpa seorang kawan saya.  Sudah setahun setengah saya tak jumpa dia.  Dia baru pindah ke Kuantan 6 bulan aja dari Melaka.  Anyway,  sejak saya  masuk ke Pahang, mulalah hujan.  Saya pun tak buat apa.  Saya sampai pada hari Sabtu dan terus ke rumah kawan saya.    Saya betul marah kerana hujan tak berhenti!  Hujan berhenti pada petang hari Sabtu tu dan kita pun pergi ke telok chempedek.  Tak der apa pun!  Kami nak pergi Cherating pada hari Ahad tapi tak boleh kerana hujan turun lagi!  Satu hari pulak.  Anyway, hujan pun berhenti pada malam Ahad.  Kami makan malam di sebuah restoran ditebing sungai Pahang.  Dari tempat kami berdua duduk, saya nampak ada 4 kawan.  3 daripada mereka biasa.  Ada yang pakai shorts, seorang pakai jeans.  Tapi satu daripada mereka adalah chub.  Dia tu mungkin 168 cm dan berat badan dalam 110 kg.  Handsome betul.  Dan yang best punya, dia tu memakai kain pelikat dan t-shirt!  Betul handsome pulak.  Saya asyik tengok dia aja.  Ada kali dia bangun dan tengok saya.  Rasanya dia suka saya tapi dia dengan kawan dia dan saya pulak dengan kawan saya.  Saya dan kawan saya bangun dulu untuk balik.  Dia pun lambai tangan.   That makes my day!!

      My Chub webteam, particularly Gemuk Chub, thank you for inviting me to somehow write my two cents worth in this blog, though i doubt that it would amount to anything but at least hmmmm...why do we like to say at least this, at least that, is it something heriditary or we r just being too freaking polite and doesn't want to sound too show offy when the real emphasise is obviously on the at least thingie and it seems we simply settle for the 'at least' when we didnt manage to achieve anything, how contradictory!.  God, i'm rambling.....ok so back to business of writing this blog, allow me to introduce myself (at the same time advertise my slutty ass) and pohon restu from the seniors for i am just a budak baru berjinak ngan this community, i was a chub in denial(maybe i'm still am, i dunno) and still thinks that I'm a babelicious babe but reality hits hard when the amount of rejections (we can know from the eyes and the silent or akward treatment especially when courting unless the guy really appreciate chubs and the like) surpassing my ability even to say ello!  But then, it didnt get the better of me, no fecking way, our demeanor is our saving grace and our endurance are priceless, a make believe reality. Anyway, I'm 26 and love having encounters with strangers but seldom will it last two dates or sessions, whatever u want to call it.  Never had the privillege to acquire bf/s or maybe lacking the skills in maintaining a relationship, i dunno but it's as fickled as fickle get.  Mostly I would assume the agressive passive role and would try ever so hard to please my many one time lover (touch and go).  But I think i have ceased to be sooo a housewife, being assertive is quite a difficult thing to practise when you were like before this; when the guy you were with couldnt get it up after so much bragging and boasting from his side, and you smile instead and said takpe....i dont mind saying it if the person was a nice guy but when he was like too demanding in every way, where he sets precautions and rules in everything and you abide to that, and in returns, he freaking couldnt deliver, well...what is tHAT! just remember guys body contact between two people means two people working it to make it work not a literally sleeping partner who just laze around and make you do all the work.  Hey aint nothin a free ride anymore, we have way passed that.  Honestly I have to admit that I'm rather a shy person outside in the real world but can be pretty daring when i'm in the net, I have never hit anybody off the streets even if he was like this drop dead gorgeous being, i just took a disinterested glance and pretend that nothing happens when deep inside me it's like a Krakatoa ever ready to erupt again.  My last encounter was with this guy who responded to my personal message in the mychubs personal ad or something, i coudnt feckin remember and yeah we did have some good jackin off session together (god i dunno whether i'm allowed to share explicit moments in this blog, i know zilch of the rules in here, so if i was way overboard with my anything, pls advise ok) but then it stops there, i's an ok encounter, not that great but ok and he doesnt mind kissing either.  I've been like Julia Roberts in pretty woman who inferred that kissing is more for affectionate relationship and not for ons but then this guy started it, so i kissed him back and right at that moment i realised that i'm not a good lay....simply because i have forgotten how to really kiss and it affects my performance as well.  Not affecting it completely but slightly affected.  And that was like i dunno a week ago, and after that I couldnt be bothered to have anymore meetups, i used to have meetups at least 3 or 4 times a week, a full fledge meetups mind u, but now..hmmmm....maybe i'm getting older.  Or maybe LOVE has become something of a requited necessity. I dunno.

      To Lyndon: Pretense?  I suppose everything is a bed of roses when you first met, then the 'attraction graph' goes down.  I don't think he intended to play with your feelings, but more like 'having different goals'.  To each his own, someone told me.  A bloody busy month, which was February and now, March.  My free time was usually past 9pm, where I’d get myself dinner, and actually met other people from my workplace.  Hardly go clubbing anymore, since there aren’t that many places I’d want to go to.  Am hoping that Kings of Tomorrow or some house DJs would come over soon.  Went to Bleu a few weeks ago.  Don’t really agree with the music they played, but the crowd seemed to love it.  Somehow, the maths doesn’t add up. Loud speakers + 2am + Jln P Ramlee + PLUs = Dikir Puteri.  To each his own, someone told me.  But heard from some guys that the place was packed the recent Saturdays, and the playlist has improved.  Missed hanging out with the guys, really eases my stress and tense (a cheaper alternative than going to saunas and such!).  I do drop in IRC once in a while, just to get latest updates.  Chatted with a guy over coffee the other day.  Kinda chubby, he has a big frame.  Round face, bout my height, fair skinned, Malay, smooth.  Could pass for Afdlin with glasses if you look from behind.  Hanged out the Bangsar area these days to get glimpses of the F1 Grand Prix fever, and yes 'twas fun.  Girls in minis (er?!), boys in shorts, bigger boys in shorts... the likes.  Am expecting a much larger turnout over around Jln P Ramlee (12SI, Emporium, Nuovo, Backroom) area this weekend.  Think Tequila on a furry chest.  Okay, so I don't drink, but you get the idea.

      Hi there!  Well tak ada banyak nak ceritakan!  tetapi saya ingin tanya sesuatu.  Why do so many people make a pretense of the situation?  Ini bukan kali pertama yang saya mengalaminya!  The guy I met in Penang!  It was nice for a while.  Tapi sebenarnya, dia tak berapa minat sangat pada saya!  Selepas jumpa beberapa kali, dia terus nak menghilangkan diri.  Cinta tak boleh dipaksa!  Baru-baru ni, dia tak nak menjumpai saya.  Dia tak nak terima pangillan saya!  He is a big pretender!  Saya tak boeh buat apa-apa?  Kenapa ada orang yang boleh memainkan perasaan seseorang?  Kalau tak minat, cakap aja!  But I am lucky!  Minggu lepas saya jumpa seorang lagi di gay.com channel.  He is a chub, umur 27.  He seems nice!  Last weekend, saya berada di KL dan dia pun menemani saya!  I hope it will strike off.  Saya akan ke KL minggu depan.  Just hope it goes well.

      Hi all!!! Mashimaro is back!! After a week break from my university studies now I have a bit more time to enjoy myself !! but  first of all I would like to say sorry to moari27 since I promise to join in the gathering at JB but something come out at the last moment, so I have to go back to my home town!, but hey I hope the gathering was a fun one(so I heard!!) okey so in the bolgger today I would like to talk about the chubby guy in  Television or famous chub celebrities!! Well last week while I was in my home town , I found myself watching  the grammy award rerun on astro and I saw a very cute chub guy presenting an award, It's was Kevin Jones from the sitcom "kings of queen! Wow he was cute , actually I adore him because he  is a chub with such a cute tummy (season 1 episode 5) where he actually show his tummy on TV (a cute one, I would say just like mine!!hihihihihi!!!!). In my mind I was thinking that! " I wish I could be like him!!!" surely  no str8 but actually there is a rumor that he is PLU also in one of the tabloid in the U.S, well let me see! Errmm.. ,  I would say kevin was a 9 for me !!! hihihihihihihi!!!!!! But the strange part is that I start to like the thing he does !! for example I read  on one of the tabloid in the internet that he like to eat fried chicken, well actually I always like fried chicken !! so that does not count, but one more thing is that, in one of the episode that I saw , he was wearing this cute round cap that got me walking around the mall the next day looking for the same one!! Suddenly I realize "hey! Is this an obsession! Or just sudden attraction to the fesyen he reveled  on his show?!" Well I dunno but , hey!! why don’t malaysian chub celebrity have the same effect as the foreign one? One more question in my head!! Well lets us see our malaysian chub celebrity ! bob lokman? Cute  but ermm.. not that attractive for me though , what about aflin shauki? Ermmm.. do you consider him as chub? I think cub would be it !!, ermmm… mazidul of TV3, he is cute, serious looking but not that influential, I think that really influence me when I was still in high school would be KU2, with the two cute chubby guy kuman and kumin!!! Hihihihihi!!!! but the thing that influence me about them at that time was the cute jumper they wear!! To tell you guys the truth I have one too!! , although there is one more guy who is a malaysian chub celebrity, I am sure all of you known him by now ,he would be the casual kind of chub,with a cool and conservative kind of appearance!!! That chub  would be Harid Iskandar, you guy's probably often see him on "celebrity square's" or if you guy's are in PJ area he would be often seen him  around section 14 at the TGI Friday's , don’t ask me how I know that hihihihihi!!!! Ok I thinking I write to much ok I got to go now since I have a lot of thing to handle before I start my extra semester course!!!! Okey take care all hope you guy's have a fun  life a head!!!!

      Hi Semua,  Saya sekarang di Penang!  Saya telah menjumpa seorang chub di gay.com.  Kami saling hantar e-mail sampai ada kali, 3 kali sehari.  Saya pun ambil keputusan untuk jumpa dia di KL.  Maklum, orang Selangor.  Saya telah buat reservation di Vistana Hotel, tempat saya selalu menginap di KL.    Tetapi, tiba-tiba, saya dapat e-mail dari dia yang kita kena batal perjumpaan kita di KL.  Last minute, dia kena di hantar ke Penang untuk kerja.  Tak tahu apa saya nak buat!  Rasa macam nak batal perjumpaan kita.    Dia pun ajak saya ke Penang.  Dia menginap di hotel di Penang.  Dia kata company dia dah bayar!  OKlah tu.  Saya pun ke Penang.  Habis keje malam pada hari  Khamis dan terus ke JB.  Naik bas pukul 12 ke KL dan sampai pada siang pagi.  Saya pun ambil keputusan untuk naik ke Penang dengan bas.  Dia tu kerja.  So samnpai lewat tak per.  Saya sampai pada pukul 3 dan duduk di Komtar.  Dia suruh saya beli makanan ringan dan minuman.  OK!  Habis tu naik teksi ke hotelnya di area Bayan Lepas.  OK.  Sampai saya di hotel.  Talifon bilik dia, tak jawab.  Mungkin belum balik tu!  Tunggu bawa sampai 45 minit.  Rasa ada yang tak kena.  Talifon bilik dia lagi.  Ada pulak.  Dia minta saya naik.    Well he is chub.  Melayu dan tinggi dekat 5'10".  Umur 30+, dan berat badan dalam 95 kg.  Saiz pinggang adalah 39 to 40.  OK.  Malam itu kami pun bercakap-cakap dan dapat tahu antara satu sama lain.  It was good.    Saya tak buang masa.  Hari Sabtu dia kena kerja.  Maklumlah....keje private bukan kerajaan!  Saya pun ke bandar dan membeli sebuah kad.  Saya beli dia sekotak chocolate Ferrero Rocher dalam bentuk HEART!  Saya pun dapat sebuah bunga ros!  Tak lama selepas dia balik, saya pun buat proposal!  I think I am in LOVE!  Malam itu, kami pun pergi tengok movie Jennifer Lopez, Maid in Manhattan!  I tell you, it was so romantic!    It was a good night!!  Dia telah pulang ke KL petang ini.  Saya balik esok.    I THINK I AM IN LOVE!!

      Hi Lydon how are you! well mashimaro is back again  i was being really quiet about the huge amount of bitching around lately!! well to tell you the truth we cannot stop people from bitching about us!, there are always people who are jealous of MyChub. One thing though, you cannot simply label it was us that was bitching around. If you look closely, the real bitches have quit mychub and decided to form a new group for themselves (BigBoyz). However, "kerana nila setitik, rosak susu sebelanga", due to their foul mouth acts, mychub had to bear the blame and shame. The good news is that these people are no longer inside our group, thus we can now clear up our good name that have been tarnished. Except for BLUE Bar, MyChub does NOT have any functions elsewhere in KL. Those whom found loitering around CM by day and Selera Kampung (SK) by night are Bigboyz. In MyChub we have better things to do than gossiping and bitching people all day and night at mamak stalls. So, it's up to us who knows the reality of this to clarify this matter and help spread the word around.   We cannot cry over spilt milk, what have been done is done. We cannot force people to like MyChub, or even join MyChub's activities. Once a person have a bad impression of us, it is very hard to change their mind. However, we should not worsen the situation by pointing finger at each other, instead we should learn from this experince and try to show the good nature of MyChub by setting ourselves as an example not to be bitches like them.

      Hi there, all!  How are things?  For me, so far so good!  I have recently met a guy in KL!  Chub to say the least!  But well, let me just tell you that I think it is starting correctly!  So far I have been to KL a couple of times and to prove his sincerity, he has come to Singapore too.  We met in chat on gay.com.  Anyway, wish me luck!  But something actually saddens me!  I have spoken to him about mychub and its activities!  He said he used to attend some functions especiallly with his ex.  Pergi juga ke CM on Sunday.  But he told me that he has absolutely NO interest in attending any more functions of mychub!  Of course, saya mesti tanya kenapa???  He said it is due to the huge amount of bitching around of mychub members!  Nothing I can do will make him change his mind about going to any function!  But I think I am lucky!  His answer to me, "Kalau abang nak pergi ke apa-apa function, abang pergi seorang!  Saya tak boleh halang abang tapi jangan paksa saya pergi!"  That is a very sad statement!  Well, you cannot get everything, right??

      6am.  I felt too fuckin' tired to drive home, so I went to Tasik Permaisuri (how convenient, eh?!).  Twas a long day, 'lepak' at bleu, watched the glittering show by glitters dot com, bitched about how everyone danced on the podium, and secretly thought that I would look worse.  My my, people must think I'm such a desperado, coming there at 6, when people are about to go jogging.  Oh well, all I wanted to do was to get a short nap.  And I really really hope the slim guy in Planet Hollywood t-shirt wouldn't be there.  I got a major shock the last time I saw him where suddenly I saw a face smiling near my car.  Opps, make that eyes and teeth.  But it's too stuffy in the car, and I have no idea what else to listen to, tho I have literally thousands of songs, so, I got out of the car, lit a cigarette.  But it's too bright at the parking lot!  I gotta go somewhere darker, so that my mind can relax, and perhaps saw some activities, so I walked slowly into the park.  Yeah yeah, create a reason to go inside, eh?  I'm like so telling the truth... hehe  Saw some enthusiasts trying to catch some Flower Horn in the lake.  Err, that ugly hybrid that's supposed to be bred in Malaysia?  Why?  Whatever... as long as everyone's happy.  Oh my!  It's actually darker in here!  I can actually relax my mind here!! And they have chairs too!! Now why don't I sit down, smoke a few cigarettes and just be quiet.  "Hi! Apa khabar?" "Er?  Ok, khabar baik!" I replied  "Panggil aku Wan.  Nkau?" "Ok.  Panggil aku Zul" (why Zul?  I've no God-damned fucking idea why, but the name's familiar, so I used that name)  "Tak balik lagi?  Dah pukul 6 dah ni." (Pointing at his watch) (Huh! Jam Cartier ke?! Hiskk, napa tetiba aku jadi judgmental ni?)"Dah balik dah, saja datang balik, tertinggal molot, ni yg nak cari ni"  "Hehehehahahahahhhehehehehehehehehe.  Awak ni kelakar lah!" (Hmm, the transition from 'engkau' to 'awak'.  Sesuatuh!! Makin lama makin lembut nih!) "Dok mana?"  "Er... er... er.... Ampang!" (Aisey!  Did u just make that up?  Trust me, pumpkin, I don't care.)"Ok.  Bagus tempat tu.  Kat situ banyak TV warna dan klip kertas."  "Huh?!?! Apadia? Tak faham lah!" "Heheheh... takda apa2...aku tgh boring, tu yang merapu tu. Jom jalan2 jap sedut udara segar."  Lyndon: Hmm, mesti ko ni peminat cerita Ally McBeal kan?  Yang bagusnya ko ni optimistic pesal life.  Aku tak kenal ko tapi I don't find any reason for you to change becoz someone asks you to.  Sort of you wouldn't be you anymore.  Kata kawan aku, ala2 ikut konsep programming, ko dah tau apa silap, so betulkan le algorythm tu.  Tapi emosi masuk campur, kan?  Ko bukan mesin, ko manusia yg ada perasaan.  Senang cakap daripada buat.  Tapi cam kata kawan ko ler..you tak serik lagi ker??  Would it be that somehow deep inside, you're hoping that they're not as manupulative leech as they appear to be?  Or the thought of being alone kinda scary?  You already know the problem, you know what needs to be done.  Good luck!  And I believe you, he's out there somewhere...

      Hi there, Sudah lama saya tidak tulis untuk blog ini.  Firstly, congratulations...both of you....hope you have a long and lasting relationship that just gets better as the days go by!!  Itu harapan saya!  For me life is pretty quiet.  Since I last met that guy in KL, nothng much.  But as all tales go in my life, it has come to an end!  Well, that is life...tapi kita kena terus hidup kan??  But seriously I think I need to look into myself.  Saya dapat rasa yang kebanyakan daripada orang yang saya jumpa, menganggap kebaikan saya sebagai satu kelemahan!   Of course, nothing else counts!  It is money.    Sebelum ini dia tu dah kata....abang tak boleh tulis untuk blog lagi....I had a whole list of demands.  Never mind.  Saya akan mematuhinya.  But as usual, the rest of the story revolves around money.  Saya tak tahu kenapalah......kebanyakan yang saya telah jumpa di KL akan minta wang dari saya!   This one was a classic case.   When I refused to give, plus masa tu I memang sakit.   Mana boleh pergi bank nak hantar duit pada dia.  Baik tu, he will call me often to check on my health.   But bila saya tak hantar duit pada dia, terus dia senyap.  It has happened to me before....I think semuanya 3 dari KL!  Sampai my good friend kata...you tak serik lagi ker??  I am sure that outside there, there is someone for me, but I have yet to discover him.  In the meantime, I will carry on searching!!

          Hi, it's been quite some time since moks have written anything into this blogger. Sorry dearest readers, a lot has happened with my life and my present work continues to take more and more of my leisure time. Anyway, i'm back for now and I just want to share with you a story that I had encountered a few weeks ago. Well, I was sitting in a restaurant waiting for my ordered set lunch, when I noticed a cute daddy chub sitting in front of me. He was fair for a Malay, around the age of 40-ish, waist 42, around 168cm and 100kg. There was a cute little mole under his ear which makes him irresistable. He was wearing a white office shirt that hugs his huge belly and dark colored pants which curved nicely around his bubble butt. I tried NOT to stare at him... but one just cannot resist such temptations when one is presented with such delicacy. Starting from eye contact then down to the lips... I smiled. He smiled back at me. My heart just pumped with joy. Are my charms working today ? Rarely I would be this lucky. We continued to glace at each other and smiling silly all the way through lunch. He was really cute i tell you. After i ate my last morsel, I grabbed a pack of ciggarette. Then, nervously tries to look for a lighter in my tight pants. Out of the blue, he was standing beside me and offering me his lighter. He looks really good close-up, all the fats bulging at the right places. Belly tits and butts. His clean shaven face looks so adorable in the sunlight that it took a while for me to regain my composure in that situation.  "Mind if I join you ?" "Sure lah.. have a sit", I replied in my broken english. "You ni GemuKChub kan ?" Huh.. i was taken aback with his question. How did he know ? "Err... uncle ni siapa?" The work uncle just jumped lovingly from my mouth. I did't have time to think... abang would have been more appropriate in this conversation. To my amazement, he has been eyeing me for quite some time. More amazingly, he knows a lot about mychub and it's movement. He gave me the impression that he is an old passive member of mychub. Each of us tries to get more confortable and we even ordered our 2nd drink. Well, with a georgeous chub like that I'd even skipped work this afternoon. "So what's happening to mychub lately", he asked "Donno lah.. everybody bitching about each other.. not as fun as the old days" I sighed. "Uncle tahu.. i have been keeping my interest in mychub for quite sometime now" Feeling unconfortable, I dumbly  ask the Trophy Question... "Uncle dah ada B/F ke ?" He replied.. "Dah..!!" , My heart sunk. Seeing my sullen face he added "Kalau bukan kerana MyChub, uncle mungkin tak bertemu jodoh" "Macammana pulak tu" "Ye la, tanpa mychub, uncle tak akan tahu bahawa bukan uncle sorang sahaja yang memendam perasaan sebegini", "Dulu uncle ingat uncle sorang sahaja dalam dunia ni, bila uncle terjumpa website mychub barulah uncle sedar yang orang seperti uncle ni masih mempunyai harapan dan ramai lagi berperasaan seperti uncle" "Perasaan macammana uncle", I asked knowing too well the answer. 'Alaaahh.. perasan suka kepada lelaki... terutama lelaki yang gemuk dan badan berisi macam uncle sendiri" I nodded with approval.... "Uncle tak takut ke.. yer la.. expose ke" "Dulu memang uncle cukup takut, terutama kalau orang lain tahu. Tapi sekarang ni uncle sedar bahawa selama ini uncle takut dengan diri sendiri. Takut untuk menerima kenyataan", "Terima kasihlah , kerana tanpa MyChub, dimana lagi uncle nak mengadu nasib" "Uncle.. MyChub bukanlah kepunyaan saya akan tetapi hasil titik peluh semua ahli yang telah sukarela menolong untuk membangunkan kominiti ni" "Uncle percaya, ada ramai lagi yang masih belum melihat itu semua, ramai lagi yang memerlukan khidmat Mychub untuk membuka mata mereka" "Tapi uncle.. ada dah jadi kacang lupakan kulit, tidak menghargai apa yang mereka ada, malah mencaci maki kita bila ada yang tidak kena. Walhal kita cuma berniat hendak menolong" "Itu adat lah... bila kita berjaya.. dan orang lain tidak.. hasad dengki tu akan berputik","Biarkan mereka dengan cara mereka... MyChub have it's own kind of style and class","Keep up the good work and don't let anybody make you think otherwise" "Thank you uncle" Suddenly, I felt proud, becauseI felt that something I did have helped someone. Eventhough not for my own benefit.. but at least I made people happy. Along the way I have made a few new friends. That is what the sprit of MyChub is all about. To all of you,  Have a nice day ... especially to all the LTR couples who have found their match in MyChub. We are glad that you have found your happiness here.

        WOW! It has been exactly 6 months and 2 days (correct me if i'm wrong) that I haven't written anything in this page. I'm so sorry. Been super busy for the last few months. And I'ma say March was the nightmare. Tons of projects, final exams, and even worse, our "thesis". The latter of which was not really so successful. "Frustrated" was the exact word to describe myself during those times. But despite all those failures, I still had the best of it. After all, I now had a noble career in life. And I am happy to say that things started to ease-up on the following months. In fact, May was kinda interesting. I even considered it as the "love month".   Now how come I called it as such when February is supposedly the month of love? Well, lets just say that it was the date that I'd met my partner. He's about 230#, 5'10 and of course, the beard (oh boy, it could just simply turn me on.) Mutual email exchange at first.  Well, that was some sort of an advertisement where he said "hey! I'm a new bee here. And I'm this and that... straight acting chub looking for the same.  Blah blah blah I'm in Cebu."  Jackpot… Then I said to myself "oh my, could he may be the one that I've been looking for?"  Anyway, we kept on sending email until we reach to the point that we should have to meet (its kinda weird how you say I like you but don't even see each other.)  So, meeting time. It took place on a local mall. But He didn't recognize me at first because of my new look (I sent to him my old pictures) when in fact, I was the one who approached him.  But you know what he did to me, he reached his right hand into my cheek and squeeze it. He said, "You're cute. I can't help it". I don't know if he's saying the truth. hehe… but anyway, we went to a cinema and there, we're just chatting inside instead of watching the movie. We didn't even realize that the movie has ended. Whew! That was quite a talk. And one thing, FAQ's always present. Everytime anyone asks me my nickname, I generate some kind of response. "Why FiveForty?" he asked.  For me, the answer is quite simple.  It's my alter ego, my crazy inspiration on life. Hehe…  And yet the bond between us was fast that at first meeting, there's already a kiss involved. I don't know what is it called. French? American? Or just a plain Filipino style. What's in the kiss anyway?  After all, the satisfaction was there. I'm so glad that my hunting days are over.

      Hi there, I just got reading the previous articles.  Well to me, I knew I was different from others at the age of 13 or so.  I was attracted to guys then.  I found certain types of men interesting to look at and would always look at them.  But at that time, I did not know what this is about.    It is only about 3 to 4 years later that I used to use shopping centre toilets.  Of course, keluar lepak dengan kawan-kawan sekolah.  It is then that I became aware of messages behind toilet doors.  I used to ead as many as I can and imagine what was happening.  Actually at 17, there was a few times that I was approached but I chickened out.  Only at 19, did I dare enter a toilet and try out a quickie!  But was not a good experience.  I promised  would not do it again but somehow it happens again and again.  At 20 I got a girl friend.  Was long term but did not work out as I felt she having a university degree versus me who did not would not work well.  After that I went all out cruising.  Believe you me, in the 5 years of our friendship, I can count that the maximum number of men I cruised was 5.  But tastes change.  Before I was not at all attracted to chub guys.  It is only hen I met a guy about 1987 and I realised what it was.  Until today he and I are good friends.  But he is in KL now.  I think he is the one who has made me see chub guys in a different way now.

      i havent written for quite some time, not that i was bz or something like that (I am eternally bz with work, anyway) it's just that i found that writing for this blog proved to be quite a hard challenge, not everyday we experienced encounters and not every day we resort into slutness.  Anyway, what Raden Putra @ istante wrote made me want to share my 2 cents worth.  lately i have been questioning my gayness and my situation as a chub with homosexual tendency.  True, history and environment play a major part in making me decide to be what i am as applicable to 'Zul's' friend who were unfortunate enough to be mishandled by his own uncle hence evoke his decision to be what he is today.  What I am trying to get at is this: is it the whole truth? is it because of one particular or maybe a series of episodes that led us to resort to our own likings?  Many people will gladly tell you his story of why he become gay in the first place, but then to me, the story were purely made up (not imposing that the story/ies wasnt true or anything, it just that it did happen but it's probably not the REAL reason)  The episodes or the stories simply strengthening it but it wasnt the CAUSE.  My theory : we (plu and the like) are afraid of women, or we respect women too much or women simply too fucking hard to handle.  So we find comfort in men and embrace them whenever we can.  i will let this linger on your mind and i welcome any feedback before i finally present my case with deliberation and arguments.  regards rozman www.deadjournal.com/users/tristrandoe

      Ada member minta tolong letak dialog ni... Kot2 sesapa nak bagi komen dipersilakan, topik mungkin agak heavy.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Knock! Knock!  Aku ketuk pintu. “Jap!” terdengar suara kat dalam bilik.  “Hi!” “Huh?! Eh… hi… so betul ke aku ni orang yang ko nampak aritu?”  Aku cuma senyum. “Camana bleh tertidur?  Apa ko buat arini?” Dia menguap sekali. “Aku baru sampai.  Penat siutt! Err… panggil aku Hari”  “Ok, panggil aku Zul.” “Jap ekk… aku nak mandi jap”  Dia pakai tuala dgn baju melayu masuk bilik air.  Aku lepak je kat katil, perati dinding dengan siling, kot2 ada lubang dan kamera tersembunyi.  Paranoid betul aku.  Dia dah habis mandi, dan masih pakai tuala dgn baju melayu.  Dan masih bulat dan gebu.  ………………………………………………………….  Dia tidur terlentang, aku baring atas dada dia, mengadap muka dia. “So, bila ko nak balik Penang?” Dia tak jawap.  “Macamana ko tau aku aritu?  Ko ngendap aku chatting yer?”  “Ha’a.  Aku lalu kat PC kau, aku nampak nama2 channel yg kau masuk.  Heheh” “Ko tau, aku panik giler masa kau tegur aku tu, tangan aku siap menggigil!  Masa aku jalan ke luar tu pun menggeletar lagi!  Aku ingat aku dah cover abis dah…”  “Ala… org yg tau mesti tau punyer… ko ada bagi satu renungan yg boleh diagak.  Hehehehe…” “Hmmm…abih tadi kau tak lari lak masa aku bukak pintu tadi?”  “Err? Napa kau cakap camtu?  Kau penah kena ada org lari bila kau bukak pintu ke?” “Takle… saja tanya.  Mesti ramai chubby-chubby kat KL kau dah jumpa kan?”  “Wahhh!! Molottttt! Takda le… aku buat member jek!  Lebih2 pun takda!  Kalau dah kenal sebagai kawan aku buat jadi kawan aja…” “Abih aku ni?”  “Err… dalam hal ni aku ni kira mangsa, kau goda aku suruh datang bilik kau… Hahahahah” “Siutttttttttt!”  “Takle camtu.  Aku ada unwritten rule kot, nak explain pun susah.  Lain2 kali aja le.  Kau citer le pesal kau, biar je aku baring atas dada kau ni…. Citer le apa2…Err, kau takda kutu kan? Hehehhe” “Siutttttt! Heheh…”  “Hehehe.. ko perasan tak?  Bila ko bercakap tetek ko ikut bergerak sekali.  Hahahahah…” “Woii!! Merapu je ko nih! Hehhehe… Eh! Ko tau, aku terjebak dalam dunia ni masa kecik."  "Duhh!! Isn't everyone?!" "Citer aku panjang.  Aku kena dengan uncle aku.  Confuse, siut.  Sanggup dia buat camtu kat budak2 yang tak tau apa2.  Sakit.  Aku menangis.  Aku memang dendam dengan dia sampai sekarang.  Sampai mati aku takkan maafkan dia."  "....." "Aku grew up confused, marah kat diri sendiri.  Aku taktau nak cakap kat sapa.  Taktau nak mintak tolong kat sapa.  Org2 kampung aku kenal dia sapa, kira org yg baik2 jugak, so mesti diaorg tak percaya dia buat macam tu.   Akal budak kecik aku ni suruh aku makan banyak2, supaya badan aku besar, nanti aku boleh lawan dia balik, nanti aku boleh jaga adik2 aku kalau diaorg pulak kena kacau."  "....." "Aku taktau apa diaorg pikir sampai sanggup buat camtu kat budak2 yang tak berakal.  Tapi aku macam kena sumpah lak.  Aku jatuh cinta dgn lelaki.  Buat aku lagi confuse.  Untung bebudak sekarang, diaorg byk tmpt nak luahkan perasaan."  "Bukan salah kau, beb... tu aja yg boleh aku cakap.  Bukan nak offer comfort, aku tak pandai, tapi mmg bukan salah kau..."  (bersambung bila rajin...)

      hi all !!! how are you? well this time mashimaro is back but with a sad story!! some of you guys know where i study rite ? well i currently doing my practical there too! i meet up with one of the patient which i was going to  monitor his progress during the sugery he had to undergo that week, he is a daddy chub with 168cm tall 105kg and 44 inch waist! i know this since i read his folder! but is not that he was chub and all(although is was one of the main part of it!) but it is because he is this kind and friendly guy!! that never stop smiling!. the past three day before his operation i got to know him a bit better and actually became his friend! he told me about how he is ready to face evrything that might happen after the operation! but he is human and he is also a bit afraid of it too!! on the day of the operation, i went to see him to talk to him before the operation! we were laughing together talking about what might the surgen think of his big body size!! when it is almost time, i told him that i need to go and prepare everthing for the operation, but before i leave him , he grab my hand and ask me to take care of him there in the room!! i told him "i promise i will". at the operation theater before the surgen arive i had a short chat with him telling him to keep a strong faith that he get through the operation! the last word he say to me before he fainted was "thanks ben!". The first part of the operation went smoothly but the suddenly the monitor went beeping loudly, meaning that his heart is slowing down! the surgen was odering around everyone inculding me to make sure the machine was working and i did, suddenly i hear the most dreadful word in the Operation room!! "Time of death 3.58pm!" i raise my head from the monitor! looking at the daddy stiff body on the table! i almost cry when i saw he pale face , it seem like he was still smilling!. after all the other staff have left the ot room i was the only one left there, i still cant belive that he is dead! "i was talking to him just a couple of hours ago!!" that the word i keep saying in my head! i just stood there for almost an hour until the attendant took the body back to the morge! and at that time my last word to him was "maaf pakcik! ben tak dapat jaga pakcik!" i dont know why!, i only knew him only for a week but it felt like i have known him all my life!!! the whole night i was thinking about what happen in the theater? could maybe it had been solve and maybe the daddy could still be alive? i dont know the answer for that question but i do know that he is a nice guys, a funny one!, a cute one, and he had a hot body!!!(what am i thinking!!!!!!) . well i am glad that at least i got to know him!!!    Rest IN Peace Pakcik Razak!! May God Bless you!!     p/s thanks gemuk chub for you comforting word that nite!!! luv u!!!!

       Hi you alll!!!!!  mashimaro is back again!!! and this time I got like a few stuff to put in the blog, well is being a great week!! last week went for the gathering!!! is was cool!! It makes me realize that I haven’t being clubbing for such a long time! ok well the was some comment about me when I enter the channel , about  all the blog I wrote, some comments are constructive but some  are destructive!! Well I take it all as a reminder and motivation for me! one thing though! people actually told me that it cant be that someone could have so much encounter!!! plus at a young age like me! Well to tell you guys the truth, actually you guys will find an encounter almost every single day but an encounter will never be so direct!! You guys must see all the small detail that follow, for example a few day ago I was walking to the café during my lunch break!! Suddenly I realize that well someone was following me!!! But I ignore it thinking it might just be my imagination, but then I realize that the guy was still following me from behind, so I took the courage to say hi! And ask him why is he following me? , He was quite a while and then he say that he was lost and was following me because he wanted to ask for direction! Ok for you all you probably say that he was right! He was just trying to ask for direction!! But think of this!!! Of all the people around there why me? Why did he follow me from the second floor till the café? At that time he have plenty of time to ask someone else for direction!! For me that was an encounter although he was only a cub but he has a cute face!!  Just nice lerr!! So sometime when you guys wanted to make you life more exciting , all the little thing that we most probally ignore, just for once think that it does really matter! From a small smile(respon tu!!) to a sharp stare! (taste kat kiter ker?) or just a cute comment example: “you ni cute ler” ( mak aii!!! Bertambah kembang mak dibuatnyer!!!!) hihihihihi ok you guys gotto go now but a new blog is coming soon so be patient ok!!! (yeah that mean you too Sir Cloud!!) to take care you all!!!!!    mashimaro

       Hi alll!!!!!! Mashimaro is back after a long pause from the blog arena!!! A lot of you being asking me why haven’t I enter anything in the blog lately?? Well the right answer for that is because……. I haven’t had an encounter for quite a while now!!!! With all my  clinical and thesis to do!!!  I think I would not realize if a naked chubby guy is walking past in front of me!! ( yeah like that ever going to happen!!!) for you guys who have finish studying ,well maybe you guys would understand how I am feeling right now!!! With  less than 50 days (1 ½  month to go!!!!) I be a full pledge medical scientist hihihihihihihihihI!!!!! Wow!!!!!! After all the hard work I finally get to use the title hihihihi!!!!!!!!!!!! But it is sad though when I realize something have change indeed since I join the course ….!!! I seem that my friend who I thought was my friends finally back stab me!!! ( ouch!!!!!) just because to them a kampong boy like me is not qualify to score A!! well wut ever!!! Who care about what they think as long as I past hihihihihihi!!!!! .            Ok thinking about the past, I like to share an experience I had during my first semester!!! , before I start I have to inform you that at that time I did not even know that mychub existed ok!.                Well I t was my first semester at UM it seem to be a great semester for me!!! I finally was excepted here!! And my course I think is the most coolest course there is (for me that is! ) in the university, never missed a single classes ( those were the days!!) and plus I got a crush at one of the professor in my course!!! (hihihihihi!!! That was a long time ago!!) . During that semester  the one thing I could never forget is how I was lucky enough to meet someone that I could get close to like best of friends but  lost it!.              I was my first day doing practical work and well I was nervous , and I was really afraid of doing something stupid in front of all my lab senior!!! , I  hide it by   putting on a happy face and try to make friends with everyone there!!!  But there is one person who actually kindda attract my attention!! He was one of the  full staff there!!! He is about 157cm tall ( a short guy!) ,43 year old , 95 kg and a 40” waist nice small chub guy and has this cute mustache with a thin layer of goatee . He  is cute although not really chubby!! (not enough chubby for me!!) hihihihihi!!! . He was really quite that day!! But during lunch time!! I finally got a chance to talk to him!!! And I did , I ask him where he come from and all that other stuff to break the ice!!!, it turn out to be that he is quite a chatter bug! So the whole afternoon we were talking about almost all the thing I could have think off!!  after that day!! We were getting closer to each other!! Always going out for lunch and all talking about life or how hard it is to be a parent like him!!!! ( yelp he is married!!) going out for movie!!!! He start to send me back after work and all!!!  At that time I start to have feeling toward him!!! (hihihi!! Like a love story ler!!)   then one day I have to go for a dental treatment , I have to do a reconstruction on one of my tooth! So the dentist gave me an anesthetic , after the treatment I was feeling woosyyy from the anesthetic, so he offer to take me back to my apt!! as usual I say  “yes” ( wut do you  guys aspect  I was wooossyyy at that time !! he he!! )  at the apartment I was alone with him!!! As I lay down at the sofa he sit at the edge and say I better lay down in the room!!! It was nice to have someone that care for you since you own family was like hundred of miles away!! Hihihihihi!! Then I kindda was thinking at that time maybe if he just give me a kiss !!!!   that would like be so romantic!! Hehehehehe!!! As I was thinking about that I felt something wet touching my lips!! I say to myself  “wut the heck?” when I opened my eye I saw that my dream come true he was kissing me!! Well at that time I just response to kiss!!! I was like so horny!!! Hihihihihi!!!!!!! We were like so on each other, his tongue was like massaging mine and I was massaging his!!! His hand was rubbing my “you know what!!” and the unzipping my jeans, then…..you guys can thinking of wut ever happen next!!!  Hihihihihi!!!! The next day I was feeling remorse of wut I did!!! Since I actually did it with him! One of my senior staff ,a good friend of mine!, A father figure to me!!!!! “Oh my god!!! Wut have I done!!!”  I kept reciting that all day long!!! He was also really quite !! for the past few days we lwas not talking to each other!! Finally on afternoon he come up to me and ask me if I would have tea with him! I agree ,  then he finally have the courage to talk about wut happen!!! , he say that he is sorry about wut happen he did not know wut got into him!! (I think I do!!!)  and he promise it would never happen again! Well it never did!!! Although  we are talking to each other but since I was move to another lab ,and were rarely meet each other!! Maybe sometimes on the corridor toward the café but just to say hi!!! We were never close as we were before!!! Well thing that are not meant to be!!  Ok that all for now that was really a long one huh? Hihihi see you all at the gathering this weekend!!!!    MASHIMARO

      Interesting comments.  At least I knew there are people who read it.  Me and friends had a heated argument about being gay about 7-8 years ago, about whether it's 'nature vs nurture'.  It came out in TIME magazine if I'm not mistaken, some gay professor from Harvard found some 'differences between hetero and homo brains'.  But, I pick nurture.  The idea of blaming my genes somehow does not appeal to me, it sort of give me the idea that I do not have control over my choices.  Probably the same crap about having worker genes and leader genes.  That's the summary, the whole argument shit was a lot nastier, which in the end, no one really wins.  I would say I'm turned on by personality, intelligence, success.  I would say Marlon Brando as Don Vito Corleone in 'the Godfather' very sexy.  The idea of a small man, soft spoken, kinda bubbly, but in total control of the families in New York is very very interesting.  Just his personality, not his organised crime activities.  The same probably goes with Dr Hannibal Lecter, played by Sir Anthony Hopkins.  The idea that he commands so much, able to delve into other people's mind, that's like "WHOOOOOAAAHHH!!!".  What have I been up to these days?  Weekly trip to Bleubar, screamed happily when they play Beyonce's Crazy In Love, and cursed when they play 'The Number One Song In Bleubar for the fucking 4th month Shanty and Marcell's Hanya Memuji'.  Oh my God!  That song was like a year plus ago!  Perhaps I kinda take it too seriously, but I do believe DJs have a social responsibility to educate the crowd, probably by playing up-to-date songs, with the intention of keeping abreast with the current hits, and guide the not-so-lucky clubbers who probably don't have fast ISDN/ADSL/T3 internet connections to download all the latest hits.   Somehow the songs are better on Fridays than on Saturdays, apparently the crowd on Saturdays have more 'youngsters', and they prefer 'Chiki Girls' to 'Destiny's Child'.  Really?

      It took me the longest time to write to this blogger nowadays. Not because I ran out of encounters but due to lack of time on my hands. Well.. this little incident I must share with all you dearest readers. It occured when was I was strolling along the TESCO shopping complex the other day.  It was squirming with people. Especially during this Merdeka holiday weekend. There were lots of chubbies too. Small chubbies.. BIG Chubbies.. Cute Chubbies... all came "out of their shell" to welcome this festive occasion. So there I was, sitting inside at a corner of the KFC Restaurant. Looking at people passing by and scooping my 3rd helping scoop of Sara Lee's Vanilla Ice-Cream. When a cute chubby guy with goatee and moustache caught my eye. He was 5'8" in height, 112kg at least and jaw dropping smile that you couldn't resist. He was wearing dark polo shirt and a white trouses which shaped his butt nicely. The tight shirt wraps around his body jingles at the belly as he walks towards me.  "Excuse me... Could I ask you a favour" he asked... "Sure... how can I help" I replied with a little bit of shock. "Well it seems that I had lost my handphone.. do you have a handphone so that you could call mine ?" Defiantly, I took my handphone from my pocket.. "Sooo.. what's ur number please.. " "It's 012-XXX XXXX ... give it a few minutes to ring."... So I pressed the number on to my phone and waited. It gave a couple of rings but nobody answered. After it seems a minute or two he said thank you and went his way. I did not gave it a thought afterwards but continued to eat my ice-cream.  Later that night, a familiar number flashed on my handphone. "Helloo..." "Hi... Remember me the guys at TESCO ?" "Oh yes.. I still do" .. feeling the nervousness in his voice. "I just wanna thank you for the call.. I managed to find my handphone at last.. I missplaced it in my car actually" "Oh issit ? I glad that you found it" "Err... do you mind if we go out sometime tomorrow ?.. err.. as a token of gratitude."  "Okay.. but it's your treat.. so where do you want to meet ?" "How about TESCO... same time and same place ? "Okay.. see you there then.. bye" "Byee.."  Duhhhhhhhhhhh!!! Did a cute chubby guy just ask me out ? I never thought that the handphone missing was a trick. But i admit it works.  Anyway... wish me luck on this date. Who knows.. we might be sharing Ice-Cream from the same cup. To you guys out there.... there is life out there.. there is hope out there... u just need to be a part of it.  Happy Merdeka Fun    GemuKChub

      Happy belated birthday to me.  Damn!  I'm into the Big Three Oh.  Age ain't nothing but a number, Aaliyah said.  But she's already gone!!  She will always be 22!!  Then again, I have to take her words for it, I like her THAT much.  Oh yeah, happy belated birthday BaronCaffeine.  ------------------------------------------------  Aku balik kampung minggu lepas pesal ada kenduri.  Jumpa kawan chatter lama jap.  Seorang manusia menyerupai beruang yg baru shaved, agak buncit tapi dada dia lagi besar, pinggang ala2 muat dipeluk, rambut pendek lurus sikat tepi, gigi putih kecik2, bulu roma tangan agak halus dalam 17-21 helai seinci persegi, punggung bulat, bau wangi melebihi bau lemak, cakap banyak.  Just the way I like them.  ARGHH!!  Cutenya!!  Dia bawak jln2 kat bandar, pesal aku tak reti sgt jln2 ni.  Lepak kat Singgah Selalu.  Happening gak.  Borak2 je dekat 2jam sambil perati org dan sekali-sekala main teka-teki 'Sapa PLU kat sini?  Mamat rock dgn mamat pakai baju ketat tu couple ke?  Wragghhhkahkahkah!!'.  Dia dah ada boyfren.  Ahh! The good ones are always taken, there are only leftovers.   Hahahah, mesti aku kena laserz kalau ada org yg berkenaan baca statement tadi tu.  Dia percayakan long distance relationship.  Dia ingatkan aku kat Elaine dalam citer Ally McBeal, very der optimist.  Dia buat aku enjoy makan banana split sejuk2 tgh malam kat restoran baru tu.  Dia suka Ning Baizura.  Dia suka Antara Mungkin Dan Curiga.  Aku bagi dia dengar Hazami Keabadian Cinta pun dia suka gak.  Tapi masa dah cukup, aku taknak balik lagi tapi ala2 terpaksa.  ------------------------------------------------  Jumpa kawan lama gak minggu ni.  Chub, smooth, misai dan goatee, suka diamond.  Dia dah ada boyfren.  Slim.  Bagusle.  Dia kata boyfren dia caring, sebab selalu telepon dan sms tanya khabar.  Dan dia rasa boyfren dia serious nak rapat lepas boyfren dia selalu telepon dan tanya khabar masa dia demam 3 hari.  Aku terpikir something yg dia cakap.  Kalau dia tak demam dan boyfren dia tak telepon adake maknanya boyfren dia tak serius?  So, dia cuma perasan boyfren dia serious pesal dia sakit, so kalau dia tak sakit dia tak perasan ke boyfren dia nak serious?  So, pesal boyfren dia je yang tau dia sakit then adake maknanya orang yg tak tau dia sakit pesal diaorg tak telepon tu tak amik berat?  Sekali lagi, norma2 hidup yg tetiba jadik undang-undang ekk?  Ala2 kalau dapat sms kena jawap cepat2, kalau tak orang marah... hehehe

      Tadi masa moks tengah lepak2 kat opis. Ada orang ketuk pintu. Moks pon pandang la kearah pintu. Tetiba je jantung moks berdebar. Di muka pintu tu, terpancul susuk tubuh seorang chub. Tergamam sekejap... cutenyerrrr dierrrrrr. Very chub... entah chub mana pulak sesat kat opis moks ari ni. Dia muda lagi.. dalam lingkungan 25 keatas. Tinggi dalam 172cm berat dalam 120kg. Waist size dalam 44 - 48. Perghhh... dunia rasa macam berhenti kejap... macam ada chemistry.. terasa ada kejutan elektrik.  "Yer.. nak apa ?" .. dengan stail machonyer bertanya (tak boleh pechah lobang.. kena la gaya abang-abang). "Err.. saya dari Syarikat XYZ, ada kawan saya kata encik nak order quotation dari syarikat kami.  Dia pun menghulur business cardnya. Mata kami saling memandang... tak berkelip lansung. Moks mempersilakannya duduk dan pada masa yang sama, moks jeling-jeling la kat celah kangkangnya tu.. wow.. boleh tahan jugak ni. Perutnya memboyot ke depan. Rasanya dia perasan moks dok asyik pandang kearah perut, dia cuba membetulkan bajunya yang sememangnya ketat di bahagian pinggang tu. Kami pun memulakan perbualan dan moks mula perasan, matanya tak berganjak memandang tajam kearah moks. Business trick ni kot.. nak tengok response pelanggan.  "Macam ni. Saya nak order ... bla bla bla" Dekat 15 minit moks membebel. Herannya.. dia tak tulis pon apa moks nak.. Macam terkaku. Eye contact tak pernah putus. Hmm... ada respon agaknya.  "Ehh... awak tulis tak apa saya nak tadi...?" "Tak apa.. saya boleh ingat." Barulah tangannya tergopoh-gapah nak mencari pen dan kertas. "Err.. apa yang encik nak order tadi ?"  Moks pon ulang sekali lagi apa yang moks nak. Dia mula menulis dengan khuyuk. Kebetulan pulak, digital cam moks ada atas meja time tu. Apa lagi.. sambil rancak berbual. Tangan moks dok sebok memicit picu digi cam. Boleh la buat modal time-time kemaruk nanti.  Di tengah-tengah perbualan. Tiba.. tiba dia mengacukan soalan yang tak diduga. "Maaf ya.. muka Encik ni memang nampak familar".. (Aiseh... ini macam ayat ayat budak all boys SBP nie) "awak pun macam familiar.. tapi kat mana pernah jumpa ye" "Rasa macam pernah nampak... encik ni grad dari UTM ke ?" (dlm hati moks... eleh kot kot dah ter-chat kat chennel #mychubs dan siap tukar-tukar face-pic lagie.. bole buat-buat tak kenal) "Tak la... saya bukan dari sana" "Tapi betul la.. muka encik ni very familar, sejak dari saya masuk tadi saya cuba nak ingat kat mana kita pernah jumpa." "Hehhehe.. saya pun rasa kita pernah jumpa. Kalau nak berkenalan dengan lebih dekat pun tak apa." (hints .. hints) "Encik ada business card tak .. atau contact number ke.. nanti kalau saya free boleh contact encik." "Ehh.. tak de la.. card saya dah habis" moks sengaja tak kasi business card moks.. sebaliknya, moks capai kertas dan tulis my personal contacts.  Moks dah paham.. ni musti nak ngayat ni.  "Ok lah, kalau encik moks perlukan apa-apa, jangan segan-segan nak contact saya..."  "Okay.. no problem"  "Kalau ada masa nanti.. saya nak belanja makan dinner ke.. bole kan?".. wahhh nak ajak dinner date ghietuu..  'Boleehhhhhhhhhh" kalu orang nak belanja moks.. mesti nak punyerr.. apatahlagi kalau chub.  Sambil salam tu.. moks genggam kuat-kuat tangannya. Nak kasi hint sket lagie.  Nanti weekend ni ingat nak call dia balik.. nak ajak keluar sambil mengenali dengan lebih dekat, pertemuan kat opis ni terlampau formal... tapi moks agak dia akan call moks dulu.. hehehhe.. it's just a gut feeling.  Hik hik hik.. seronok gaks ada encounter camni. Anyway utk pembaca sumer.. kena la pandai "read between the lines". Encounter bole terjadi dimana-mana sahaja.. pada waktu yang kita sendiri tak terduga.  Happy Deepavali !!!   P/S: (susulan dihari besoknya) Dia call gak moks ari ni.. yahoooo.   Pastu siap kasi e-mail lagi: > Maaf kerana tak dapat jumpa En. Moks (bukan nama sebenar ya) hari ini. Sebab petang ni  > saya ada meeting penting. Besok pula nak pergi out-station, jadi kemungkinan besar > saya tak ada selama beberapa minggu. En. Moks masih bujang ke ? Kalau bujang, boleh  > ke jumpa malam ni ? Dinner ke ? Ada beberapa pekara penting yang saya nak finalize  > sebelum saya nak submit proposal ni.  > Call saya nanti untuk confirm.

      Hi Guys, kali ni moks tak der nak citer pasal encounter. Tapi nak citer pasal projek-projek terbaru kat mychub website. Kalu y'all nak tau, ada banyak inovasi yang sedang berjalan dibelakang tabir website mychub ni. (iskk .. jangan berfikiran kotor sedara2 sekalian). Apa yang moks maksudkan ialah internet services.  Yang paling baru ialah linking Internet Radio dengan Gaydar UK. So skrg y'all bole lah mendengar lagu berunsur PLU sesambil melawat website mychub atau meng-chat di chatroom MyChubs. Hasil kreatif Jaze_Ipoh.  Disamping itu, kami juga sedang berkerja keras untuk membina RSS newsfeed (amende tuh.. ?? ) Well, RSS nie macam berita terbaru ala2 website berita harian / the star tapi mengenai berita Chub & Chaser dan boleh diletakkan di laman web peribadi sedara2 sekalian - ianya diupdate secara otomatis. Diusahakan oleh GemuKChub  Selain itu, kami juga sedang dalam bergiat dalam pembinaan servis baru iaitu MyResipi - satu ruangan untuk berkongsi maklumat mengenai pemakanan yang sihat dan pada waktu yang sama boleh membina perut .. hehehe. Diusahakan oleh Mashimaro  Pada masa yang sama kami juga sedang membina skrip IRC untuk OP di channel MyChubs. Add-on terbaru skrip MyChub2003 bole didownload dari website. Hasil usaha Nightshiver.  Akhir sekali, terdapat beberapa projek Multimedia Flash yang sedang berjalan untuk Intro website dan juga MyCard Greetings dibawah pengawasan Ali-SetanKL.  So, kalau y'all berminat nak menyumbang idea/hasil kerja kreatif dalam bidang2 yang disebutkan tadi... sila lah e-mail kepada : mychub@time.net.my  "Bersama menyumbang untuk komuniti Chub & Chaser"  Peace Broder !!!!

Hi Semua…Buat pertama-tama kalinya saya diberi peluang utk menulis didalam ruangan Blogger Mychub ini. Terasa bosan pulak asyik berchatting jerk,nak jugak curahkan citer kat Blogger ni…ghituee…  Mungkin ada yg dah tahu kan yg saya masuk hospital aritu sebab buat pembedahan mata.Anyway saya dah semakin beransur pulih. Takder apa sangat pengalaman selama 2 minggu lebih kat wad cuma meluat jerk dgn gelagat beberapa orang Nurse yg agak  'getikz’ dan 'gedik’  ditahap maksima!Doktor2 semua ok dan friendly.  Terima kasihlah kepada teman-teman yg sudi dtg melawat saya kat hospital aritu Nanti kalau korang ‘termasuk’ hospital aku pi melawat pulak yerk…hehehe. Especially to my bf yg tersayang sbb really take care of me, love u kebabz! ahaks.  Hari ni saya nak ler citer sikit tentang hal ehwal memaki hamun orang! Adalah sekali tu gambar saya telah terpampang di front page website Mychub (ala2 jadik cover ghitue..). Semua ni hasil usaha   kreatif   GemukChub!hahaha. Lepas pic tu kluar, adalah sorang dua umat ni yg ntah ler apsal tak puas hati dgn saya tetiba jerk send msg dan sms dlm website Mychub dan memaki hamun saya dgn kata2 yg agak kesat. Well,kalau tak puas hati dgn org toksah ler selindung2…ni tidak,dah ler letak nama palsu pastu dok maki2 saya pulak!  Getikz  sangat perbuatan tu! kalau berani tampilkan lah diri yg sebenar! Sesedap rasa jerk nak ngata org!Dasar penakut, ngata belakang jer buat per!!!  Oklah saya bukan marah pon, okjerk..no hal ler!nak pesan sikit kat org yg maki2 saya tu, pls ler cermin muka tu sikit sebelum nak ngata org! Sesungguhnya kita benci seseorang itu, tak perlulah memberitahu semua orang.  Lets keep it to ourselves , tak payah membuka keaiban orang lain lah. Kalau dah rasa diri tu  ‘gila’ , pls jgn nak libatkan org lain! Dasar getikz & gedikz yg spastik!!! Kata pepatah orang putih,  "All chubs are grey in the dark!" , what goes around comes around.... Hmm..sorry yerk semua..ter’over’ emosi pulak, geram siott!! Ok, tu saja utk kali ini, sampai ketemu di lain cerita. Bubyeee.. Vote for Nana!!!…………..hehe

      Hi!  Apa khabar semua?  Harap semua baik.  Well i chatted with this guy on gay.com/chat.  He is pretty nice and from KL.  We have been chatting and also SMS each other and sekali-sekali call.  Well from his photo, you will not guess his real self.  I went to KL over the weekend and took the opportunity to meet him.  We made appointment to meet Saturday.  But last minute he was working as he had a dateline to meet for his work.  So, I told him not to worry.  He called me around 8 at night.   He asked to meet for dinner.  He even came to my hotel to meet me.  Wow, I was shocked to see him as I entered his car!  His picture showed me that he was not so big.  But he was.  My taste!  Anyway, I act cool.  We had good dinner and long chat!  He sent me back at about 11 or so.  I understand kepenatan!  I would say he is 1.7m, and weigh 120 kg.  He asked me to call him again and hopefully things will be better when I go to KL the next time.  Looking forward to that!  And anotehr meeting!

      Beberapa hari sebelum Raya, moks telah dijemput ke rumah seorang kawan lama. Bukan apa, saja nak menziarah sebelum dia balik ke kampung. Moks pon dah lama tak pergi rumah dia.. dah dekat 2 tahun dah.  Actually, kawan moks ajak suruh tengok2 kan komputernya yang rosak. So, moks pon setuju aja tanpa banyak soal.  Sesampainya moks dirumah. Moks ternampaklah Abang iparnya yang sangattt cute. Chubby Daddy type.. siap kumis goatee yang nipis. Kulit putih melepak. Rambut ala2 beruban sikit. Muka senyum meleret. Dia memakai baju melayu dan kain pelikat. Isskk rasa macam nak terkam dan peluk je on the spot.  Lagi cair, daddy ni pulak ala2 manja.. ala2 childish. Very approachable and friendly. Entah camana, there is a chemistry. Abang Ipar dia ni plak tetiba jadi restless, asyik2 nak lepak ngan kita orang je. Dah ler tu.. asyik dok keluar-masuk bilik kawan moks...  "Nanti lepas you tengok komputer tu.. meh tengok komputer I pulak.. ada kat dalam bilik I" "Err... bolehhh" (tapi.. apa motif daddy tu nak ajak masuk bilik dia.. angkat laptop tu datang sini tak leh ke ?) "Laptop I ni banyak problem.. I nak pasang banyak barang"  Start dari situ, Daddy ni dah mula kasi hint. Ada beberapa pekara yang daddy ni kasi 'clue' yang amat mencurigakan. Antara hint yang dapat moks tangkap semasa perbualan kami adalah:- -------------------------------------------------------- "Semenjak i pencen ni.. I ada banyak masa." (Dlm erti kata lain.. I'm always free and available)  "Kalau u free datang la lagi ke rumah.. kita leh main-main komputer" (dlm erti kata lain... nanti bila wife I pegi kerja, bole la kita main-main bersama) p/s: statement ini diulang beberapa kali sepanjang perbualan.  "Semenjak dua menjak ni, I banyak buka puasa kat hotel.. dua malam lepas kat Sheraton, lepas tu kat Istana then semalam kat Equitorial" (dlm erti kata lain... kalu you nak ajak I tido hotel 5 star pon bole juga.. i mampu spedoo you !) -------------------------------------------------------- Moks pon cuba la korek skit info dengan kawan moks tu pasal abg ipar dia. Banyak maklumat berguna yang moks dapat... 1. Abang ipar dia tu kawin lambat.. umur 30-an baru kawin. Skrg umur 50-an anak baru 2.. kecik2 skolah lagi. (maybe PLU ni) 2. Bini dia plak chub.. (ader chance chub4chub ni) 3. Kawan moks cakap, dia kasi layanan special hanya untuk chub2 aje.. kalu kawan dia yg slim datang.. abg ipar dia buat tak layan (confirmmmm!!)  So malam besok, moks dapat invitation lagi berbuka puasa ngan diaorang. Tengok la camana daddy tu kasi respon lagi. Kalu berjaya.. tambah la lagi sorang sugar daddy moks.. hehehhehe.

      Hello apa khabar semua...  Sempena bulan baik dan hari baik ni Buaya nak ucapkan selamat hari raya le aidil fitri buat semua. Yang mana termakan terminum tu harap dihalalkan....  Hari ni adalah hari terakhir Buaya berkursus, yahoooooo!!!... dan harini juga exam .. sepagi dok mengadap kertas.  Nak dijadikan cerita  adalah seorang pemeriksa tu memang cute habis... chub , pendek , senyuman yang manis.. muka bulat... hmmm memang menepati apa yg Buaya minat. sepanjang kursus 3 minggu ni .. memang kalau dia mengajor.. apo lagi ambil peluang ler... tengok atas, bawah.. tepi, tengah.. belakang depan, habis semua jadi bahan untuk hilangkan mengantuk. Dan banyak kali jugak ler senyum senyum bila dia lalu kat koridor masa in between kursus. Dia pun senyum balik... emm nice guy.. Tapi harini rasa nak melompat sangat. Mana tak nyer .. tadi 2 soalan memang tak leh jawab, baru sejam exam.. orang dah start keluar.. dah siap!.... time time camtu lah.. dia dok lalu tepi Buaya dok pasing pasing kertas... Buaya pun senyum la kat dia... Dia senyum balik dan terus datang dekat.. Camner bleh jawab ker? .. ermmm boleh kot ... Buaya jawab dengan agak tergamam.. buat buat nampak pandai ler.. .. pastu dia beredar.. selang tak berapa lama.. Buaya mula gelisah .. pandang sana pandang sini... tak tau nak jawab... Dia nampak terus datang kat Buaya lagi... Dia tanya .. yang mana takleh jawab? .. Buaya pun tunjuk la soalan no 2 bahagian 1... ooo  yang ni camni.. bla bla bla bla.. dia bagi jawapan... Eh tetiba plak.. kasik jawapan.. ermmm .. pastu dia terus pegang bahu Buaya dan siap tulis lagik camner nak jawap... perkkk.. best gilerr.. tangan dia plak .. rasa lembut lembut montok gituu...badan dia plak kena skit skit kat tangan Buaya... sambil sambil tu dok terbayang best nyer kalau dpt cium pipi dia ni. Pastu apa lagi Buaya pun laju ler menulis jawapan...

      After much thought, and in view with the changing times, we are experimenting with a new name title change to our blog column.    "The Chubby Soup for the Seeking Soul"   Thus, we hope that more blog writers will come forth and write, not only about encounters but also about the expanding world of Malaysian chubs & chasers as we had originally intended this blog to be.  We value your comments and hope that this change will bring a positive turnaround. If you have the skills... If you have the passion.. If you want to be a blog writer...   write an e-mail to: mychub@time.net.my Introduce yourself to us...  We will reply with a confirmation invitation to the MyChub blog writers pool.

          hi you alll!!!! maro kembali semula ke arena blog!!!!! wah lama siot  maro tak tulis aper2 kat dalam blog ni!!!! well pertama sekali maro ingin mengucapkan Happy Chinese New Year!! kat all yang celebrate !!! kuikuikui!!!      Well!, first of all maro nak ucapkan jutaan terima kasih kepada para member of mychub sabah yang  menyertai gathering sabah yang pertama!!! tidak lupa terutamanyer pak sani dan mr mail yang sudi datang dari jauh!!! Brunei tu kat dalam peta nampak dekat tapi sebenarnyer jauh siot!!!!. Anyway maro agak kecewa juga sebab terdapat anasir yang cuba mengsabotaj gathering ini dengan menyamarkan diri mereka sebagai orang lain!!! dan mengatakan bahawa gathering sabah tersebut di batalkan!!! ermm....!!! sedih betul!! tapi anyway we try to do something for the community is up to you guys to judge why they want to stop it!!!.    ok ni maro nak cerita skit!! beberapa minggu yang lalu maro masuk channel (MIRC) saja boring2 cari ler member nak chat!!. So maro chat ngan sorang ni (nick dirahsiakan!! heheheheh) dier cakap dier dah umur lebih 30 tahun tapi tak pernah pulak alami encounter macam maro sedangkan maro ni baru jer belasan tahun!!!(oopppss!!!konon!!!),   ermm.. well actually encounter ni so subjektif!! , encounter berdasarkan tafsirsan kita pada masa encounter tersebut berlaku!!!     oleh sebab itu bila ader ler sorang daddy chub tu bagi no HP kat kita!!! dengan alasan saja nak berkenalan!!!(chewahh!!!) aper tafsiran pertama kita semua? bila saya tanya soalan ni kat chater tu dier cakap!! well mungkin dier saja nak berkenalan!!( well of course ler!!! ) but cuba kita semua pikir lebih dalam lagi? ermm.. dier minat kat kita kot? and dari sana kita pikir semula semua perbualan kita ngan daddy chub tu!! setiap geraklaku dan reaksi muka dan sebagainyer!!! well then korang semua akan kata wow!!! an encounter!!!     so actually encounter boleh berlaku anytime anyway but kita punya Subconscious mind yang terbiasa buat dek jer all the simple factor yang menunjukkan that experince is a encounter!!  in other word!! encounter tu ader cuma well kekadang tu kita ter miss jer!!! hihihihi!!! ok semua that all from me for today!!! take care!!!

      Di zaman dahulu kala ada sorang chub bernama Samwise, dia takut buka mata tapi dia tak buta, dia suka kena pimpin.  Samwise kena pimpin dengan sorang ni dekat 7 tahun, nama dia Qui-Gonn Jinn, kalau Qui-Gonn nak lepaskan tangan dia nanti dia tarik balik tangan Qui-Gonn.  Samwise takut jalan sorang2 dalam gelap, pesal dia taknak bukak mata, dia tak percaya suasana sebenarnya terang.  Ada sekali tu Samwise jumpa sorang ni, nama dia Iori, Iori ni pimpin dia sekejap, dan tanya "Kenapa u tutup mata?  Bukak la mata tu so boleh kita jalan sama2?".  Samwise jawap "I tak nampak la, bukan i tutup mata.  I nak org pimpin."  Iori jawap "U nampak la, cuba bukak mata tu, jom jalan sama2.  Tengah terang ni ha. Then kita boleh sama2 pergi mana2".  Samwise jawap lagi "I tak nampakla!  U taknak pimpin i sudah!".  Dia suruh Iori pergi.  So Iori pun pergi.     Si Samwise ni jalan2 teraba2 dlm terang, kekadang terjumpa tangan orang, ada yang tepis, ada yang sambut.  Yang sambut tu pimpin tangan dia kejap. Samwise tu seronok kena pimpin, seronok kena tarik ke sana sini.  "Apa guna buka mata kalau dah ada orang pimpin?"  Mungkin tu yg dia pikirkan.  Ada orang yang rimas asik tolong pimpin dia aja.  Ada yang nak pujuk dia suruh dia bukak mata dan tengok keadaan sekeliling yang sebenarnya cantik, tapi dia halau.  So Samwise pun meraba2 dalam terang lagi dan lagi dan lagi, minta orang pimpin tangan dia, sapa2 yg lalu depan dia yang sanggup pimpin dia pun dia tak kisah, asalkan orang tu sanggup pimpin.  Tak kira orang tu nak bawak ke mana, asalkan kena pimpin.  Takda arah tujuan, padahal Samwise boleh buka mata tengok sapa yang pimpin dia dan arah mana yang nak dituju dan pilih dia nak pergi tempat tu ke tak. Samwise tengok dengan tangan dia aja.  Dia tak pernah kenal sapa Qui-Gonn, sapa Iori.  Dia tau Iori pernah bercakap dgn dia, dia tau Iori pernah pimpin dia, tapi dia taktau camana rupa Iori tu.  Semua tu tak penting, dia nak kena pimpin aja, dan sebagai balasan, dia akan pegang tangan org tu dan takkan lepaskan.  Sekarang dia kena pimpin dengan orang baru dalam 5 bulan, orang tu pun nak lepaskan tangan, atas sebab2 yang tak diketahui.    Motif? Moral?  Anyway, playlist minggu ni: Cokelat - Jauh Dygta ft Andina - Tak Mungkin Kumelepasmu Lingua - Bila Kuingat Titi DJ ft Agnes Monica - Hanya Cinta Yang Bisa Andien - Tentang Aku Andien - Menjelma Reza - Cintakan Membuatmu Kembali ADA Band - Manja Peter Pan - Sahabat Anita Sarawak - Perasaan Azalea - Gemawan Gerhana Skacinta - Antara Anyir Dan Jakarta

      Went to Bukit Bintang around 4pm, to avoid the massive traffic jam I'd expect since they're closing some roads for the celebration.  Called some that I know and got the expected answer "Errr... tak taulah lepak mana, tanya  ".  So I hanged out with BaronCaffeine, ate the famous Nasi Ayam Hailam, and went all over Bukit Bintang to look for budget hotel but couldn't find any (we're planning to go clubbing until morning, and concluded that we won't have the energy to drive back home).  Went to bleu.  Less than 30 ppl before countdown (I think!).  Apparently they all went to see the fireworks at KLCC before coming in.  Then suddenly the place was packed.  Cover charge was RM20 before 11pm, and RM25 afterwards.  Last year I went to Nouvo to see Jakatta the DJ, cover charge was RM60 but worth every cent as he played really really nice stuff (American Dream, Ever So Lonely and others I dont know).  The mood at bleu was the same, except that I think everyone smiled more.  The song playlist was the same, I expected more since it's New Year and probably the DJ would want to bring some changes.  Oh well... one can only hope...  No new chubs in sight, except for one from Belgium, I think.  Contrary to popular belief, he DID NOT smell like chocolate.  Current playlist: 1.  Missy Elliot - Pass That Dutch 2.  Timbaland - Indian Flute 3.  Baby Bash - Suga Suga 4.  Mandalay - Beautiful 5.  Titi DJ ft Agnes Monica - Hanya Cinta Yang Bisa 6.  Simply Red - You Make Me Feel Brand New 7.  Josh Groban - You're Still You 8.  Tori Amos - Love Song

      Have you ever been a victim of online gay bashing? As the Net becomes the new hunting ground for gay bashers, Here are some tips on defending yourself in the virtual world.     Many might be shocked by the idea that gay bashings still happen – but the truth is thousands of documented cases happen each year. But that’s only the physical bashing. The reality is, many bashers have chosen to take their crusades to a safer, more anonymous venue. The Internet, with its much debated virtues, ills, and undoubted freedom, is their new hunting ground. What could be more convenient, after all? You can even pop a few beers while you satisfy your hunger to assault some ‘sick’ queen.  Welcome new millennium. Hello, old hates.  True, the assault from online bashers isn’t likely to cause death or disfigurement. But it is just as much a violation as the first, if not possibly more dangerous. The possibilities and reach of the Net allows a basher to pretty much spew his acid wherever he chooses, with much greater impunity. He can let his inhumanity run free, until it bubbles to the surface, that much more concentrated. He can have the luxury of being several places at once, and even luring potential victims into dangerous situations, where they can be assaulted in their own homes, or in a ground of the basher’s choosing.  So what can one do about it? Much as in the real world, you fight back, with whatever you can. For the gay man in the Internet world, wit is probably the best weapon.  Many people believe that  bashers are closet cases who cannot accept their own homosexuality , and thus try to push it away by attacking other gay people. With the relative anonymity that chatrooms and online communities provide, some feel that they intimidate and abuse with impunity. I remember another time someone came into a chatroom claiming to be a police officer, and exercise his ego by scaring off the people there. He beat a hasty retreat when the moderators told him that impersonating a policeman was a crime, and that his IP address was being noted down for the authorities. Two can play at the game of bluff, but it always pays to know your rights.   Another motivation bashers have, is vengeance . Maybe he was slighted by a gay classmate (I say he, because statistically, almost all bashers are men - women tend to be much more sensible.), or somehow "lost" to a gay competitor. For some, the idea that a strong, masculine MAN like him could be in any way inferior to a "limp-wristed freak" was intolerable. A friend told me about one incidence, when a would-be basher had his ego seriously bruised when his nasty messages on a yahoogroup elicited hordes of devastatingly witty replies. Unable to frame a suitable rejoinder, he retreated with his tail between his legs. But after a few days of nursing his humiliation, he thought to avenge himself by setting up an eyeball with one of the members of the group and physically "assert his superiority". To his regret and greater humiliation, the victim-to-be turned out to be a tae-kwon-do instructor. Some days, it just doesn't pay to be straight and stupid.   A third kind of basher is the (shudder) religious fundamentalist  sort. There is no hope of reaching through the miasma of their religious fervour, and they're not even any fun to bait and toy with. Moderators should just ban their IPs or kick them from the group.   Ultimately,  bashers are sad, insecure people who try to prove their manhood and machismo  by trying to exert power over others. Don’t let them. Here are a few ways to defend yourself:  1.  Take away their tools.  Log IP addresses, note down emails addresses, forward hate email or forum postings to your ISP (Internet Service Provider) or to the basher’s ISP. Make sure the person knows that you’ve got his info and have taken steps to disseminate that info. Make sure he knows you’re covered, and that if something happens to you, it’ll be traced back to him easily. If you find a gay bashing site online, report it to site’s host, and make sure others see and hear of the site. With enough pressure, it’ll be taken down before it encourages some young fool about his “superiority”.  2.  Don’t give them what they want.  Don’t show fear, don’t react with hostility, don’t pander to their needs. Why give them any satisfaction? For some bashers, it only encourages them, because they feel that they’re succeeding in getting under your skin.  3.  Don’t take risks.  Just as you shouldn’t walk down a dark alley at night, sniffing a bouquet of flowers while yodelling “Be A Woman”, don’t meet anyone from the net who seems suspicious. Try to check on the person who’s inviting you to eyeball - talk to the person on the phone, or check his address isn’t some abandoned building somewhere. Write down any details you can get on the other person, and keep the info somewhere easy to find. Course, for those of us who like rougher trade, well, the line is hard to distinguish sometimes, so be sure to pack your Taser in your purse or buy one of those cellphones with cameras or recorders. Aside from obvious advantages, you can take a snap of anyone who tries to assault you. (For technologically challenged: a Taser is a hand-held remote stun system.)  4.  The ignore function is your friend.  If someone is getting tiresome, just tune them out. There is little point to talking to an empty room, and ideally, the basher will go away. Otherwise, see Number 1 above.  5.  Take them seriously.  One disadvantage of being online is that bashers become disassociated from you - you can’t see them or hear them. More often than not, you regard them as a nuisance rather than a threat. But they ARE threats, if not to you, then potentially to some sister in the community. Don’t give them the chance to try again with someone else, perhaps with better success.  Online bashing doesn’t cause real pain, true. But it potentially can cause real harm. Just as you wouldn’t allow anyone to physically attack you, don’t let them emotionally or verbally violate you either. The Internet is probably the one place where we can all stand proud as equals with the rest of the world. Let no one take that from us.      Original Text by:  Glenn Chua

      If it may appease our bald brothers and sister, there are some celebrities out there who had and currently have bare heads. In the world of sports, there is tennis phenom Andre Agassi as well as NBA hardcourt hero Michael Jordan. In the music scene are vocalists David Draiman from the industrial metal band Disturbed, and Billy Corgan from the legendary Smashing Pumpkins. Both have bald tops. Dolores O' Riordan of the rock band The Cranberries and Shirley Manson from the bizarre pop group Garbage once sported shaved hair dos a few years ago. In Hollywood, there are Bruce Willis, of the Die Hard Trilogy fame and rising star Vin Diesel from the blockbuster hit Triple X, who both defy the odds, and seem to project the fact that bald is macho. Demi Moore once shaved her head while doing the movie G.I. Jane, and many found her sexy after doing so.  What I am trying to point out, though difficult as it may seem, is that we should not adhere to the dictates of society on what beauty should and should not be. We should remember the sayings "Beauty is in the eye of the beholder" and "Beauty is skin deep", before we proceed to look down on bald people. It is a fact that some people actually look good without hair (just like yours truly) or in my local dialect, "angayan". There are also people out there who are remarkably intelligent and very nice, and lots of them are bald.  So there is no point in seeing those with bare scalps as one of the less-fortunate. Maybe you might say that i only wrote this article because i am worried that in the future, i would also be the object of ridicule of other people, and that this is sort of a defense mechanism. Perhaps. But i also would like to open the minds of those who regularly sner at bald people; Who knows, you might also become bald eventually, join the club, so to speak, and you'll surely experience all the mockery, the hurtful jokes and jeers firsthand!  Even so, i admit that i am still concerned when the time comes that i would no longer have the luxury of running my fingers through my hair. It still pains me to think that before i reach the age of 21, i'd have a head as shiny as a well-polished marble floor. But i think im ready for that. I mean, I am just glad things did not get any worse. At least i do not have a life-threatening disease or a serious handicap or something.  In this case, it's my head. The bald truth, anyway.

      I've been totally hook to the American TV series "Sex in The City" for these few weeks. I know, it's been out for quite sometime now, but only recently do I have the time to watch the DVD. After watching the complete 3 seasons, I have concluded that it has a lot of things I can learn from those 3 women characters. The message being conveyed is universal. It kept me thinking about the whole cruising thing.. either gay or straight. It opened my eye to a few things which I never thought before. As I put myself into Carrie's shoe and see my relationship with "Mr.Big".  Now I know the reason why he left me and married the other girl. Am I too complicated ? Is he a straight acting gay or a gay straght acting ? Those I are the things I can relate to whatever happened to my life. Overall it's very entertaining.. and educational the very least.

      I am exhausted.  I've been exhausted for the past 2-3 months.  The workload.  The stress.  The problems.  A sign that my monthly visits to the local masseur should be increased.  I badly need one right now.  And that's not April Fool.  Just got back from my hometown last weekend for a wedding.  Not mine, mind you.  Not yet, anyway.  But will be, hopefully.  Had a interesting and wonderful time, not to mention exhausting.  Didn't meet anyone as a friend I planned to meet couldn't make it.  But had some visitors from KL who decided to spend their weekend there instead of clubbing at Bleu.  I'd say they had a more interesting time with a trip to the local masseur, a nite out by the seaside cafe, and lots of DVDs.  Berudu is starting his own f.r.i.e.n.d.s collection and bought season 1, 2 and 3 altogether, including some 'berangan' movies like Legally Blonde 1 & 2 and others.  Shook bought some 'berangan' movies also which I can't remember the titles.  Harry bought LOTR: Fellowship of the Ring extended version.  Somehow the people at my hometown look 'better' in every sense, especially the chubs.  They look 'neat', clean-cut and not messy, and judging from the appearance, they could very well smell nice.  Not that I went over and smelt them... But I could probably imagine the smell of Dolce & Gabbana on fat, and it's not that bad.  Go figure! Perhaps the election result has got something to do with it.  Went to have dinner last nite with Eric and Teddy.  The original plan was for us to go to the Baskin-Robbins outlet at Ampang Point, buy 1 pint of ice-cream each and have a steamboat dinner at Desa Pandan.  But it was raining cats and dogs last evening, or rather it was rather raining angry hippos and horny bears.  So the road was jammed, and I got to Desa Pandan around 8.  Asked Teddy to buy for me a pint of Peanut Butter n' Chocolate and waited for them at Desa Pandan.  The steamboat restaurant was no longer there, a mamak restaurant instead.  Had a Japanese set dinner with them, bitched about life, and ate the ice-cream.  Yum!!  Gotta do this again.  Went back to Ampang Point and had a late drink at the mamak stall in front of Ampang Puteri Hospital.  Reza and RH joined later for a while.  And suddenly I'm like the slimmest guy around.  Heh!  Am autorepeating this playlist, more on the simple piano-based songs.  They sound better the more I play, especially in the car.  Btw, I'm looking for a cheap branded second-hand 4-channel car amplifier, preferably the established brands like Infinity, JBL or Rockford Fosgate.  Yeah, like duhh!! Found out on e-bay that it's dirt cheap in the States but about 1000x more in Malaysia.  Globalization hasn't reached here yet, I suppose?  Hasn't checked out Zouk KL yet.  How's the scene? Any chubbies there?

      14th May Went to see Pontianak Harum Sundal Malam at KLCC with Harry, Hisham, Berudu, Shook and his new friend.  Sundal betul movie tu.  Had big expectations before watching the movie.  "Ini cerita pontianak pertama selepas 30 tahun!" "Cerita ni gunakan banyak special effects!".  Duhhhhhhh! Oh well, Maya Karin was very pretty though.  And Berudu nearly jumped off his seat when he saw the scene with the chub-in-a-sarong who nearly got bitten by the Pontianak(Eng: Vampiress) from Madura.  15th May Went to the workshop to get lubrication service and my car's timing belt changed.  Was charged RM345.  Damn!! There goes my stress relieving massage sessions.  After that I went to Yow Chuan Plaza around 5.30pm to meet up with Hard, Ajeep, Ferhad and Teddy for a karaoke session.  Stayed about 3 1/2 hours in there singing everything from Simply Red to Siti Nurhaliza.  Teddy, who was pretty uncomfortable and shy at first, sang his heart out when he belted 'Anuar Zain - Jangan Bersedih Lagi' and 'Usher - U Got It Bad'.  The karaoke theme that night might've been "You hurt me you f**king asshole, hear me cry!".  Went to Suzy's Corner at about 9pm at Jalan Ampang for dinner.  The crowd was certainly for them c4s's eye-candy.  Food was so-so.  Service sucked.  Cipan joined us later.  They talked about a lot of Malaysian artists which I've no idea about, or know what they look like.  I just listened.  Hard tried to guess my preference as he pointed to everyone in the cafe whose BMI is over 28 and asked "Yang tu okay?".  To which I replied "Susah nak cakapla... diaorg kena ada brain... hahahahah".   Dari body naik ke otak then turun ke hati...   Went to Starbucks, KL Plaza at about 11pm for more gourmet coffee.  Teddy went home to freshen up coz he's going to Bleu with Harry.  I sat and quietly chatted with them as I know my intention to go there was not to oogle at people I could never get.  Not that there weren't any chubs there.  A pity no one brought their laptops as the Wi-fi speed is pretty fast.  The five of us hanged out there about an hour before moving on to 'Restoran Colour' or something... that cafe that's next to BB.  Not many chubs there.  Eyun and Zairy joined later at about 2am.  They came back from RH's place in Ampang.  Sat around till about 4am before they all went home.    Went to Taman Midah to meet up with Teddy and Harry to have breakfast.  That was around 4.15am.  They bitched about Bleubar's song selection (yeah, like what else is new!?) but complimented Glitters-dot-com's show.  Apparently Kak Ju did another scary but hillarious 'hantu' show, that instead of throwing a doll at the others at the end of the song, she threw herself.  Go figure...  We all went home at around 6am.  Definitely a long day for me.  16th May Woke up at around 3pm.  I really love weekends.  Eric called and wanted to come over for a drink around the lake.  Had a chocolate with hazelnut syrup at San Francisco Coffee.  Again, we like the surroundings and the view, and the intention to go there was not to oogle at people we could never get.  He had Mocha Frappe and a plate of Chicken Rice.  Very very nice people.  I like chubs who're well dressed, enjoy life, clean cut, could talk about anything under the sun.. the likes.  Hmm, despite what anyone might say, but 'first impression DOES count'.  We headed off to Briyani Gam Batu Pahat for dinner.  Left at 9pm for another working dinner with officemates.  Had home-cooked Japanese friend rice, tempura and sushi. Discussion ended at about 11.30pm.  Went to Concorde Hotel, KL to have late supper buffet with Harry.  Too many people, including a group of loud students or factory workers who're probably extending celebrating their annual dinner.  But there're some nice dapper looking chubs around.  Harry's having everything Asian while I opted only for a plate of Apple Pie a-la mode.  I really ate too much today.  Was sick of listening to hip hop since it's played like 24 hours on MTV and Channel V.  A friend who came back from Jakarta bought some CDs which I've been playing for the past 3 weeks.  Harry will be leaving to Middle East next week for an ICT project.  I told him people get clobbered with stones if 'caught in the act'.  But perhaps it's a sign for him... I wish him farewell.     Marcell - Marcell (reminds me of Vince if Vince ever got nice catchy songs from composers) The Groove - Hati-hati (still prefer their 1st album KuIngin.  Btw, heard there's this Malaysian group called Groovejehat who's doing acid jazz like the Groove and have a similar set-up.  And the leader is a bear.) Shanty - Shanty (dance music, reminds me of Deanna Yusuf) Agnes Monica - and the story goes (still listening to Hanya Cinta Yang Bisa) Tere - Sebuah Harapan (yes!) Audy - 2002 (ok) Utopia - Utopia (still listening to Antara Ada Dan Tiada) La Luna - (haven't really heard the album)

      Wed 23rd June 2004  Lunch break.  Had late dinner/supper with Hard, Fairyhad, Sharil at Kirana last nite from 11pm to 3am.  The first 2 hours were dedicated to comments on Akademi Fantasia especially on Kaer, Zahid, Kaer, Mas, Kaer, Kaer and Kaer.  Fairyhad was pissed coz he received messages from unknown people who gave nasty comments regarding some displayed pic.  Ironic, coz he's now the 'hunted material' instead of the usual 'hunter', and like I said to him, he didn't handle this calmly.  There is a GOD....  We talked about a lot of deep shit stuffs which I haven't done for quite a long time, coz my usual bosom buddies are now spread all over.  A trip was suggested, preferably JB or Colmar.  I dunno...  I dont really connect with JB, though there lives a fine looking furry gentle bear.  And I dont happen to have lots of fat to protect myself from the cold breeze on the mountain top at Bukit Tinggi, which means that I should get myself snuggled in between some furry cuddly chubs.  Bwahahahahaha (evil laugh!)!!!  Went to Bleu last Friday with Berudu, met Hard, Fairyhad, Cipan and Ajeep there.  Met also Tyco, Abg Ram, and a couple from Brunei.  Cutesy... Bleu is still Bleu, with songs to die for, literally.  Hanged out till 4am before heading to Kg Baru for an early breakfast.  Reached Bangi at about 6 to send off Berudu, too tired to drive back and stayed to listen to old songs.  Saturday, slept bout half an hour at Berudu's place before heading back home for a meeting at 9am.  Been selected to be the Tim Pengerusi, possibly the easiest post existed.  Went to sleep finally at 1pm till 6pm, before heading off to Bangi for late lunch.  Watched Akademi Fantasia and impressed with Bob, Kaer (have been trying to find the songs on the Net but couldn't find them.  Anyone?).  Met Hard, Fairyhad, Ajeep, Cipan, Sharil, JD, Joe Hanj, MukriezChub, Shish at Restoran Color Bistro.  Stayed there from 11pm till 3.30am.  Went home.  Sunday, did nothing at home except sleep till 7pm.  Went to have dinner with Teddy at Nasi Ayam Bukit Bintang.  Not too many people around, perhaps it's becoz it's in the middle of the month.  Went to Starbux to chat for short while and went home at 11.  Monday, went for an interview at 10.  Felt I totally fucked up. Oh well...  Chub sightings: ****

      I got this from the internet.  I've no idea whether this is true or not.  Perhaps someone who has already started this program would like to enlighten me?  Heheheheh.  However, I'm guessing that this article is something out of 'Weekly World News' or 'Mingguan Misteri'...  Playlist these few weeks: Goapele - Closer, Back To You Marcell - Semusim, Pertama Kali Siti Nurhaliza nyanyi lagu Dewa (live) - Cintakan Membawamu Kembali, Takkan Ada Cinta Yang Lain George Michael - Amazing (Full Intention Club Mix) Shanty - Takkan Habis, Persembahan Dari Hati Simply Red - You Make Me Feel Brand New Usher - Burn, You Got It Bad (feels like listening to it after watching Sweetest Thing on Astro)  ------------------------------------------------------------------  Wanking your way to weight loss   By Masuo Kamiyama  Contributing Writer  June 7, 2004  My gosh, nearly six months have gone by since the year-end party season, but you haven't done anything to trim off those excess pounds. As a result, your belt is running out of notches and your bottom is starting to sag over the edge of chairs at the restaurants where you stuff your face.  It's time, Dr. Hideo Yamanaka tells Weekly Playboy (June 15), for guys to start doing something about it. Yamanaka, director of the Toranomon-Hibiya Clinic, offers a weight reduction that he's convinced guarantees results.   Follow his "masturbation diet" regimen, and you'll soon be able to squeeze back into those hip-hugging jeans and impressing the gals with your svelte figure.   "Ejaculation raises the basic metabolism of muscles and consumes calories," the doctor says. "With fewer calories, subcutaneous fat is consumed, and making it easier to trim down.   "But," the doctor goes on, "there's no point in ordinary activity. An ordinary young person would have to do it 100 more times a month for it to have any effect."   Gosh, says Weekly Playboy. That's three times a day he's talking about.   "Actully more like four or five, if you're really serious," remarks Yamauchi. "For each 2 kilos of body weight, you'd need to squeeze out 2 liters of semen."   Gomesu Yamada, a journalist covering the pink trade, wags his head in agreement.   "It's hard enough just to spurt so often, but to get the full benefits of aerobic exercise, it's necessary for the process to be maintained for at least 15 minutes before ejaculation occurs. We have named this activity 'Onani-bics.' "   "Onani" a common Japanese term for masturbation refers to Onan, the Biblical figure who was destroyed for "spilling his seed on the ground."   Gomesu claims he has knowledge of people who have actually managed to slim down through a regular regimen of Onanibics.   "Guys who made their motto, 'At least one good tug a day' have managed to lose as much as 4 kilograms in a week," he grins.   Rather than indulge in boring generalizations, Weekly Playboy then lists the average pulse rates and calories consumed while combining masturbation with various forms of exercise. "Abdominal muscle onanism" (sit-ups), for example, if performed for 15 minutes, will consume 61 kilocalories; "back strength onanism" (reverse sit ups), just 22 kilocalories; push-ups, 95 kilocalories; deep knee squats, 89 kilocalories; pole climbing, 72 kilocalories; and so-called "Ona-hole jogging" (an activity obviously not for beginners), 204 kilocalories.   A tubby 55-year-old writer named Koyamamyama, who tips the scales at 100 kilograms, had an even better idea. Deciding he might as well have some fun in the process, he headed for red-light districts around he capital. First he dropped in at a porno video parlor in Shinjuku, where DVDs (and hand play) can be enjoyed in private viewing rooms (cost: 1,300 yen). His next stop was a peep show, where, again in a private cubicle, he could watch a young nude girl feign her own efforts at, er, weight reduction (admission: 2,000 yen). This was followed by a visit to an "image club," where the climax of the session included a climax (5,000 yen). After several other workout sessions in Ikebukuro and Ueno, he ended his session at a "roshutsu kurabu" (exposure club) in Shibuya, where, for a layout of 15,000 yen, a young lady joined him in a private cubicle, disrobed, and energetically masturbated herself to orgasm --- while he did the same.   These efforts during a total of four hours of sexual activities came to 43,800 yen, consumption tax included. Did they help? Slightly. Koyamamyama's weight declined from 104.2 kilograms to 102.6. His muscle-to-fat ratio improved from 31.2 percent to 31.8; and his overall body fat ratio fell 0.8 percent.   Well then, guys, how about it, exhorts Weekly Playboy. If you want to get in shape for this summer, then let's give it a good tug! Make that several tugs!

      Friday, got some shocking news thru email at 4.32pm. Twas time for sms-frenzy though the news's not certain yet. Had some home-cooked meal at my sis's place comprising of 'Ketam Masak Lada Hitam' and 'Sotong Masak Hitam' (tak baik makan sedara Berudu!). Yum! Went to Bukit Bintang for a while and then to the ever popular if-you-think-you've-got-class-don't-drink-here-go-to-Starbucks-and-you'd-smell-like-Maggee-assam-laksa-even-after-dabbing-yourself-with-lots-of-perfume Selera Kampung to meet some guys. Nizam's really into his new bf and was thinking of finding a job in East Malaysia or Brunei. He'll be having some 'tea-ceremony' soon to present himself to the parents. Went home bout 2am but had a short nap at Mobil station near Sg Besi after a heavy downpour. Was planning to have McDonald's prawn burger, coz one of the staff who's working there is kinda cute (read: chubs in uniforms) but the place closed at 12. I've to make up the theory that McDonald's trying to make people eat more hamburgers thru&nbsp;making their staff wear tight shirts and pants, give killer smiles while mopping the floor, bending over all over the place. I wonder if they're supposed to make fries wearing aprons, only...   Saturday, had a haircut (coz I was planning to take some passport-sized photos) and went to cc at Bangi to chat with Harry. He gave a lot of pointers, and said that I could dump my stuff over at his place if I've no where to put 'em, and that'd be a lot. The cc is run by a family whose family members and friends are mostly chubs, including one twin chubs. It did cross my mind that i got there subconsciously thru the concentrated smell of fat. Like some say, the sense of smell is the most primitive sense and most developed of all our senses. Really?   Went to Sri Petaling at 8 and hitched a ride with Hard, Fairy and JD to watch Akademi Fantasia. Got there about 8.30, after a Subaru WRC drive featuring Hard, and co-piloted by Fairy. Such display of enthusiasm for Kaer made me feel touched. With a flick of his hair while waving his invincible pass a-la  'diva datang lambat' , Fairy got us thru the gate. Picked our seats on forth row. The crowd was full, but disciplined and full of enthusiasm. Everyone seems to know everyone else in those front rows. I sat quietly, sandwiched between 2 chubs. Ahh....  The stage looked smaller than what I see on tv, and so did all the contestants. Aznil was hilarious, the show was ok, I like Kaer's Episod Cinta Dari Bromley but especially their final broadway-ish show Cats' Memory. Many gave them standing ovation, including  urlLink Joe , Hard, and Fairy, and yeah, they very well deserved it. The result was revealed, and Zarina was out. There was shock, and anger. Not many cried, perhaps becoz they're more angry than sad. She's cool. I always thought of her as someone who'll be in the Top 5 final. Sounds like the Top 5 would be 'Nurul, Mas, Farah, Adam, Bob'... hahahahaha. Btw, I'm eagerly waiting for Bob to appear in full  Nike  attire on tv. Any chance of that happening?   Went to Kak Ara to have dinner. More complaints about the result. Everyone complaint to everyone else via sms "Why Zarina?". Joe was especially pissed, and now he'd be more considering Nikki of Malaysian Idol didn't pull thru. Btw, Happy Belated Birthday, Joe!   Left for Kelana Jaya, something we all haven't done for a very long time. The mood and surrounding do have an effect over everyone else; the feeling of thrill, suspense, diva-esque made people walk slowly, with a 'lenggang' and smile. JD suddenly had a barrage of questions to everyone, questions that I believe I've asked myself about 10-12 years ago. "Why did u become one? Are you happy? What type are you looking for? Is it all about sex? Do you choose this life? Do you want to change? Why and why not? Are you t/b/v?" And so on... To JD, pick your path carefully, young man. It'll be hard to turn back. Hard said I passed the scoring marks in answering JD's questions... Yeay!&nbsp; Btw, this para requires a lot explanation which I MIGHT do should I have the time later...  Sunday, Eric called and wanted me to tag along to show his friend around Putrajaya. Went to Souq to have 'Briyani Gam Batu Pahat', which is much better than the one at 'Pintu Gerbang Kg Baru' or the inconsistent-standard near Uniten. They took some pics of the bridge (Jambatan Wawasan), Istana Darul Ehsan, Perdana Putra Building and Ministry of Finance. Eric looked exceptionally happy, smiling and showing his teeth, which tells me that he had a very wonderful nite. Btw, our usual plan to have Baskin-Robbins every 31st of the month (31% off on every 31st of the month) has to be cancelled.   Went to Sri Petaling again to hitch a ride with Hard and Fairy, and off to Plaza Ampang for a karaoke session. Ajip was already there, and Teddy, Cipan and fren, Mike and Shah, and JD came by later. Those who planned to sing a lot of songs decided to sit quietly after listening to Ajip and Fairy, including yours truly. Twas a free flow of songs incl Jangan Bersedih Lagi (Shah), Tekad (Teddy &amp; Hard), Hanya Memuji (Ajip &amp; Fairy), Episod Cinta Dari Bromley (Fairy's tribute to Kaer), Nirmala (Ajip), U Got It Bad (Teddy), Unchained Melody (Hard) and a lot more. But I did try a few verse from Barbara Streisand's Memory, inspired after the AF concert.&nbsp; Come to think of it, most songs were inspired by AF, with Fairy gave extra attention to Kaer's songs...  The five of us (Hard, Fairy, Ajip, JD, me) had dinner at Kg Baru, ordering quite a lot of things, while still complaining about yesterday's AF result. Ever the 'kipas susah-mati'. JD was back to his usual 2-words-per-hour mode. The karaoke and dinner was sponsored by Ajip (thx!), who looked none to happy with his new glasses, and planned for colorful contact lenses. Excuses? Definitely.... heheh   Monday, still listening to Barbara Streisand's Memory.

      Friday, went out to Bkt Bintang at midnite (so, it's already Saturday).  Saw legolas (no! no THAT legolas), zyf, eddibank and others.  Supposed to meet Berudu earlier but he went out with his family to have steamboat dinner at Brickfields.  Met him up at 'CC kat Kak Ara'.  We were seated next to this couple, whose bf is kinda plump/stocky.  Berudu deliberately browse the bearwww site, to indirectly signal his preference, knowing the bf would see them.  Ahh!! A master at work... The bf giggled seeing the pics, especially those from Malaysia, and kept looking at us in a curious way.  Before leaving the cc, in a pitch that would make Siti Sarah blush, Berudu said "Eeeeeee!! Ramai gak yg taste kat site ni kan?  Tetambah yg pakai2 cap dan badan camtu!".  The bf was still giggling when we left.  Went to Tasik after that, which was boring.  Meaning there aren't any that's worth watching.  Now I remembered why I don't go there anymore.  Went home at 4am.  Got off work at 2.30pm.  Had a short nap before heading to Ampang Point to meet Teddy at 5.30.  We had 'lunner' (err, lunch & dinner?!) at Hock Choon Supermarket at Jln Ampang.  Thought we're like the only Malays in the expat-frenzy supermarket.  Potato queens take note!    Headed off in Teddy's car to Bukit Kiara for the LOTR Marathon while listening to Marcell - Semusim about 7 times and got there around 6.30.  Wayyyyyy too many cars parked along the highway, which means we're too late to get good 'seats'.  Picked a spot near the right fence.  This time we came prepared with more rugs.  The crowd was huge.  Some wore pyjamas.  Some brought shiny gold-and-diva-looking bean bags.  Made last attempt to lure Hard and mylady Shalla (u prefer this name, pumpkin?) to come over after Akademi Fantasia concert.  The weather was quite cold so I'm making my best attempt to get myself covered by as many chubs as possible to generate more heat and therefore might produce more endorphines which makes people happy and want world peace.  Such a noble cause should be encouraged, aye?    Reza and Royal came later with more grubs and junk food.  Yeay!!  Fellowship started at 8pm, Two Towers started at 11.45pm (which I slept through almost the whole film) and Return of the King started at 3.30am.  One of my favorite scenes:  urlLink Arwen: "Nin o Chithaeglir lasto beth daer; Rimmo nin Bruinen dan in Ulaer! Nin o Chithaeglir lasto beth daer; Rimmo nin Bruinen dan in Ulaer!".  Got news around 11pm that Anding was out.  Er?  Anding, who? Anyway, the show finished at 7am, where one can truly see 'wajah sebenar semua orang di waktu pagi'.  Think orcs and goblins in the Moria caverns.  Got home at 9am, and had another short nap.  Was asked to go for the King Arthur premiere by none other than the Queen Fairy himself.  Dare I ignore his request?  Though sometimes I do believe he does need a little bit of spanking once in a while...  No particular reason for that but I think he needs it.  Hahahhahaha...  Ha!! Jgn sentap!!  Arrived again at Bukit Kiara about 7pm.  Feeling surreal and sleepy as I was there about 12 hours ago.  Was asleep 15mins after the movie started and was confused with the storyline and all.  Kinda hard to 'retune' my perception of what I know about the King Arthur legend, especially since I only saw the last half hour of the movie.  Picked up ShahRailway and had late supper at some unpopular but quite yummy stall in Kg Baru.  Had a good laugh about some sms which took me 5 mins to understand that sounded something like "Ppl try benana big.  Never try big benana before. Lie to pain me" or some shit like that.  Direct translation?  Ahhh... the popular ones usually get the attention, aye Hard?  Or the popular ones usually want the similarly popular ones, aye Fairy?  The contractor installed the grill last nite, which took about 2 hrs.  Now my place looks like a prison, or a dungeon.  All I need now are whips, candle wax, handcuffs, gas masks and leather straps.  Heh...  Hard, mylady Shalla and Ajip dropped by later, and we had late supper at mamak restaurant.  Reading the post below, we could have crossed path with them fatbasty and friends along the way.  Perhaps I suppose I didnt turn down my window low enough to hear Ted's voice screaming "Mana abang tadi tuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu.  Diiiiiiiiiiiinch kannzzzzzzzzzzz?!?!?!?"  ******************************************  Aku terpikir something aritu, aku bleh lepak dan borak2 about a lot of deep shit stuffs dgn byk Pisceans.  Astrologically, kononnya aku dan Pisces bleh kawan rapat.  Aku ni superstitious?  Maybe...   Bagi seorang yg hampir tiap2 hari mengadap data, fakta dan polisi, yg kononnya byk gunakan bhgn belah kiri otak, aku rasa subconsiously aku gunakan right brain utk percaya wujudnya takdir, miracle, petanda dll.  Somehow aku nak percaya wujudnya idea2 metafizik ni...   Antara kawan Pisces aku yg paling rapat ni si Harry.  Dia takda kat sini skrg ni.  Dia ingatkan aku macam ikan, yg mengikut arus (dia bukan ikan salmon), yg bebas, yg tak suka masalah, yg enjoy life, tapi perlukan seorg yg ada karakter yg kuat utk bagi dia reason utk membataskan diri; selain dari suka gi urut, atau kena pampered.  Salah satu sikap yg aku perasan sgt mmg ada kat lagi 3-4 org Pisceans.  Hahahahah...   So, adake aku mmg percaya benda tu, then aku cuba fit in apa2 description yg aku tau pada that character?  Ataupun mmg certain individuals mmg behave according to their star constellation pattern which actually affect them masa diaorg lahir?  Kalau aku pilih yg 1st, then aku dah buat satu deductive reasoning yg mungkin salah, yg memungkinkan aku menutup possibility2 lain yg timbul, which is aku cuba buat teori aku betul, in other words, aku bukan open minded.  Very not CSI material.  Hahahahha... Yg kedua? Kuasa2 graviti seluruh alam mmg bebetul boleh pengaruh hidup dan sikap org?  Yg certain ppl are born to best hang out with certain ppl?  Yg dekat2 sama teori dgn setgh org dilahirkan dgn gene 'leader' dan gene 'worker'?  Then itu nanti against dgn idea aku yg being PLU tu nurtured, bukannya nature...  Cakap pasal bintang2 ni tetiba teringat lk dialog Ethan Hawke dgn Julie Delphi dlm citer Before Sunrise "we're only fragments of the universe, totally insigificant, but some shine more than others" or some shit like that (kalau salah tolong betulkan).  A good quote for those diva-wannabes or diva-posers.  Cuaca harini gelap lagi.  Tiap2 hari hujan, so sejuk le sikit.  So mood lagu2 aku pun pada lagu2 mellow, 'dark', soul, trip hop, ambient.  Asik auto repeat lagu2 ni je sesuai dengan keadaan cuaca semasa.  Minggu ni takda mood dgr hip-hop atau r&b sangat.  Takda dgr news pasal cd2 dari Bleubar macam Diana King, Noraniza Idris, Vengaboys, Chiki Girls, Aqua hilang/terbakar/tercurah asid/terpijak dgn high heels semasa pindah ke KL Plaza lagi, tapi masih ada masa, masih ada harapan.  Marcell - Semusim Andien - Tentang Aku Dygta ft Andina - Tak Mungkin Ku Melepasmu Reza - Cintakan Membawamu Kembali Lingua - Bila Ku Ingat Mandalay - Beautiful Hed Kandi - campur2 dari siri Winter Chill... Cafe del Mar - campur2... Portishead - Sour Times Telepopmusik - Breathe Enigma - campur2 tapi asik repeat Carly's Song yg dlm citer Sliver tu Shirley Bassey - Never Never Never Brenda Russell - Piano in the Dark, Get Here Oleta Adams - Get Here Chaka Khan - My Funny Valentine Mary J Blige - Not Gon' Cry Sadao Watanabe - Any Other Fool Jill Scott - He Loves Me Stylistics - You Make Me Feel Brand New Barry White - Just The Way You Are  Depressed betul list2 lagu2 ni.  Metafor?  Tiap2 lagu ni byk meaning yg tersirat, kalu baca title pun dah tau kot.  So, adake sebenarnya otak aku subconsciously nak dgr lirik2 tu utk convey feeling aku yg sebenar tapi consciously buat aku percaya aku nak dgr lagu2 tu pasal cuaca skrg ni asik gelap?  Hahahhaha.... psychonyer....

      Hi all mashimaro back at the blog!!! how are you guys!! Sorry for the long silent!! Just haven’t find the time to sit down and wrote something!!! Well the thing is! everyday seem to be slow here in sabah!! But well sometime I could get hectic!!! A lot of stuff I did this weekend !! such as went to the likas sport complex  swimming pool for a swim!!! See a lot chubby there!!!( one of the reason to be there actually!!!)  ,  make me think that pool and chubbies are connected!!  Why??? One thing is that chubby like pool party like the gathering in pantai hill kl  recently!! And if you are a chub what would you prefer running , sex or swimming, I know your first choice would be sex! But well come on what if you single ? and like in sabah!!(hehehehehe) Cruzing place in near to none!! Except if you count  the CPS Bowling and beach street!!! Hehehehe  but well there a lot of place to “cuci mata” or direct translation washing your eye!! Hihihihihi!!!  But still sabah is a slow to get the chubby concept, still a lot of  discrimination more than in kl!!! But with the recent appearance from the akedemi fantasia student like shaari and Bob of limbang people start to accept that chubby people should not be discriminate but should be given a chance to prove themselves to the world!!  So chubby people I would again say “unite”!!!!  and prove that we can be chubby, cute , talented, knowledgeable  and good in bed too ... ops so to say!! Hehehehehehehe!! Ok that all for today!!!  Mashimaro in sabah

      Idol aku dah mati haritu, si Marlon Brando.  Aku takla tengok semua movie dia, pasal yg buat aku idolise dia pun pasal karakter dia dalam cerita The Godfather.  Padahal cerita tu dah lama, tahun 1972, setahun lepas aku lahir (selain dari lahir dalam tahun 1973, aku juga mempunyai berat 76kg dan tinggi 174cm, suka lagu2 house, ambient, r&b, Madonna, Soul II Soul, suka cerita2 fantasi, sci-fi, anime Jepun, beruang2 Melayu yang boleh berbual pasal apa2 aja).  Aku tengok cerita tu pun kira baru le jugak.  Cerita tu buat aku ada belief system yang baru, that anything's possible if you work for it. Aku terpengaruh dengan karakter si Don Vito Corleone, seorang yang agak soft spoken, berbadan kecil tapi ada karisma dan mampu mengawal keluarga2 di New York.  Aku cuba ambil dari sudut positif dari cerita tu. Makin lama Marlon Brando makin gemuk, makin taste.  Kononnya dia pernah ada hubungan sekejap dengan James Dean dan Paul Newman.  Ntah betul ke tak... Aku taktau kenapa aku suka dia.  Pasal dia Italian?  Pasal dia chub?  Pasal dia kemas? Pasal dia ada karisma dan personaliti?  Someone yg subtle and stylish. Someone who leave something for thoughts.  Yeah, brains are sexy...  Makin lama makin banyak chub kat KL ni.  Itu belum termasuk dari cerita2 yg aku dengar dari mereka2 yg selalu pergi ke Brickfields.  Jumaat ke Bleu.  Ada dekat 20 org aja.  Bosan sesgt.  Ada heat karaoke competition, so masih heat lagi.  Berudu dapat nombor telefon baru, which means dia akan senyap tetiba utk seminggu dua.  Sabtu, lepak makan2 kat Kak Ara jap dgn  urlLink Joe , Hard, Fairyhard, Berudu, Ted, Biggie. Sempat gak berbual pasal Akademi Fantasia, dan kebanyakkannya suka Fitri terkeluar. Pastu pegi Bleu lagi.  Ada beratus2 org pulak kot.  Agaknya semua nak merasa 'last call at Rohas Perkasa' kot.  Rasa macam surreal, tmpt yg sama tapi org terlalu ramai.  Ada Tyco, Abg Ram dan kawan2 dia.  Ada Eyun dan Zairy.  Ada Aalimin, Usmang, Adflin dan e-Chub.  Ada AdamJohan.  Ada GemukChub.  Dan ada 6-7 org chub lagi yg aku tak kenal.  Pastu lepak belakang Warp, dlm pukul 4.30pg dgn Hard, Fairyhard dan Berudu.  Ada scene gaduh2 a-la KL Menjerit (ada mat rempit) campur Pontianak Harum Sundal Malam (takda terbang2 tapi keliling tu ada set design kayu2 macam dlm filem tu) campur The Young and Dangerous (err.. kongsi gelap?).  Dengarnya lepas ni Bleubar akan pindah ke tmpt lain.  Bagusla.  Dan harap2 masa proses pindah tu diaorg terhilang/terpatah/terbakar/terpijak cd2 lagu Noraniza Idris, remix Jamal & Sarah - Sandarkan Pada Kenangan, remix Waheeda - Wassini, Shanty & Marcell - Hanya Memuji, Aqua - Barbie Girl, Chiki Girls, Vengaboys, Diana King - Shy Guy, Britney & Madonna - Me Against The Music (Rishi Rish Remix) dan juga cd2 boy bands.  Wishful thinking...  Smlm ke Bangsar dgn Hard, Fairyhard dan Cipan utk jumpa bebudak lain.  Maklumlah smlm kan Fourth of July.  Diaorg tak jadi mandi kolam, sebab hujan agak lebat, so adala dekat 23 orang duduk2 di ruang tamu rumah sambil makan macaroni, Kentaki, nuggets, drummets twisties, chikadees, sambil tgk Diari Akademi Fantasia.  Ironinya, soft drink dia lagi byk pilihan dari kat Bleubar. Ada BobSani, GemukChub, Peeky n partner(?), Adflin, e-Chub, wolverine7, Sham Alam n partner, AJ n frens, AcukFrance n frens, sun_way, nix_31, dzeng dll.  Bau2 lemak agak kuat di dalam rumah tu, mungkin satu kelemahan (atau kelebihan) ventilation system rumah2 di kwsn Bangsar.  It was a very laidback and simple gathering, tapi ada jugak yg panik bila time kena intro diri.  Makan lagi dgn Hard ngan Cipan kat KLCC.  Dia shopping perfume.  Balik kul 9.30 lepas aku terlepas beli sushi murah kat Isetan.
