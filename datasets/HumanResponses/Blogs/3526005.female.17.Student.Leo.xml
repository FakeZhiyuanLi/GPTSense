      -Onofre: Shakaku, I need a wrench over here. -Shakaku: Wrench. *passes Onofre a wrench* -Onofre: Hammer. -Shakaku: Hammer. *gives a hammer to Onofre* -Onofre: Screwdriver.  -Shakaku: Screwdriver. *tosses a screwdriver to Onofre* -Onofre: Doughnut. -Shakaku: Doughnut? -Izumi: You two better not be goofing off over there! -Onofre: Oh c'mon, Izumi! A Chao's gotta eat! -Izumi: You can both eat AFTER you rebuild my mansion, piece by piece! -Shakaku: But WE weren't the ones who blew it to smitherines! -Izumi: No, but you're going to fix it! I didn't hire you two for nothing...keep working. *walks off* -Onofre: *sigh* Work, work, work...I feel like a spriffin' slave. -Shakaku: Hey, Nofre, where do I stick this nail?  -Onofre: I know where I'd like to stick it... -Izumi: I heard that! -Akari: *walks up to the group with Omen* Hey, Zumi-chan! What's happening? -Izumi: Oh, hi, Kari-chan! Hey, Omen! *turns into her Chao form and leaps into Omen's arms* I'm just supervising. -Omen: Supervising what? -Izumi: Those two over there. They're building me a new mansion. -Akari: Oh. Hi, Shakaku! Hi, Onofre! *waves* -Onofre: Hardy har har... -Izumi: Excuse my brother. He's a bit frumpy over having to do ACTUAL work. So, what brings you two here? I thought you went to the parlor, Akari? And...you, Omen, was supposed to head back to Hell. -Omen: We were....but... (meanwhile) *dig* *dig* *dig* *clunk* -Shakaku: *looks up from her digging* Hey Nofre, I think I discovered something. -Onofre: As long as it doesn't move, breathe fire, and eat Chao, I could care less. Just keep digging. You were supposed to finish installing the plumbing yesterday. -Shakaku: Um...okay. *keeps digging* *dig* *dig* *clunk* *crack* -Shakaku: Whatever I found, I think I broke it. *rumble* *rumble* -Shakaku: Uh-oh. (meanwhile) -Omen: Hey, what was that? -Izumi: What was what? *rumble* *rumble* -Akari: That. (From the area where Onofre and Shakaku are working, a sudden explosion is heard, following by the sound of rushing water shoots out of the ground) -Izumi: Yikes! What happened? -Omen: Let's go find out! (Izumi, Akari, and Omen hurry to the scene. Once there, tthey find two bewildered and soaking wet Chao sitting in the mud around a busted pipe, which continues to gush out a tone of water everywhere) -Izumi: Holy cow! -Omen: My word! -Akari: What happened?! -Onofre: *points to Shakaku* SHE DID IT! -Shakaku: *points to Onofre* HE DID IT! -Izumi: For crying out loud... -Omen: Is anyone hurt? -Onofre: Shakaku! What did you do? -Shakaku: I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING! IT WAS...THE PIPE'S FAULT! -Onofre: Yeah, right! Lame excuse! -Shakaku: You're the one who said to keep digging! -Izumi: Geez, grow up you two! And fix this mess before I have to find something else to help me! *walks off* -Omen: Good luck, you two. *walks off* -Akari: *smirks* I'll wish you luck if you're still alive. *walks off* -Onofre: *mutters* Your fault. -Shakaku: Is not. -Onofre: Is too.  -Shakaku: Not. -Onofre: Too.   Just some random stuff that I wanted to put, it's one of my favorite little character dialogues. Onofre, Shakaku, Izumi, and Akari the DragonKitsune are mine. Omen belongs to my friend ExileofHeaven. When you're digging, to repair someone's house, make sure you don't hit any pipes in the process, or else it's not going to be a pretty sight afterwards.
