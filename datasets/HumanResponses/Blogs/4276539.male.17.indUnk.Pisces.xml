      This blogging is really therapeutic. It’s like talking to someone on MSN, but not having to listen what they have to say. It’s like talking to yourself, without being called crazy or people giving you a funny look. It’s like, posting on a forum, without everyone telling you that you’re spamming and that you should stop creating irrelevant threads about nothing in particular… In fact, it’s just what The Docta ordered!  Finished watching the first season of The OC on the weekend. All 27 episodes, 43 minutes each: 19.5 hours of my life well spent. Yer, the show is dripping with clichés, but I love it.  I consider my life to be similar to The OC…. With Brisbane being Newport, and Gayndah being Chino. Now I’m just waiting for a wealthy family to adopt me (hint hint, :P).  The official site is awesome,  urlLink www.fox.com/oc . 500 word summary of each episode, wallpapers, best quotes from each episode. It even has a list of all the songs that play during each episode.  Which reminds me, I want, WANT “Music From The OC Mix 1” Soundtrack. The music on the show is so awesome; I’m even considering purchasing the CD myself. I know, I said the “P” word (and not the one followed by “irate”), but I can justify this mainly because the artists are all independent or non-heard of, and so 1) I want to support these great indie bands, and 2) I can’t find them on the internet. :P  So, hopefully the album will satisfy my cravings until the second season returns. (Airing 4th November in the US). In fact, all the good shows are just about to come back… New South Park, October….New OC, November….New Family Guy (brought back from the graveyard of cancelled TV shows), 2005! Oh my god I’m drooling all over my keyboard, better wipe that off……qartfvgbyuhnjiko. That’s better :P  And yes, I’m trying to blog as often as I can, but I’m finding it pretty difficult, especially since I can’t edit any blogs or drafts I’ve saved >: ( There are just some things a proxy server can’t do. FUCK YOU SCHOOL INTERNET! ..|.. ..|..

      Yer... Check it out, my very own blog page. Fuckin' ace. I'm sure this is typical of a first blog post, but to you I say....STFU.  Thanks to my mate Johnsee for convincing me that i too, need to tell the whole world about me and my utterly boring life. Also i must thank him for helping me get past this fucked-up school's list of blocked websites....which includes www.blogger.com. Shock. Horror. (bastards. they ruin all my fun. PRAISE THE LORD FOR PROXY SERVERS! I'm sure they were all part of His master plan.)  But hey, I'll try - I'll really try, honest - not to mention this nazi camp's name. Because that would be slander. Or defamation. Or something bad that I'll get sued over. I'm sure if you're reading this, you know which school i'm talking about.  Anyways, if you're still reading this because you think I'm really fucked in the head and want to know where I buy my pot from, I'm sorry to dissapoint, but I don't puff the magic dragon, if you know what i mean.  Time to go. Later.
