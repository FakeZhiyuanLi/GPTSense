      Tonight Steph and I went to Macy's Furniture Store at Shopper's World and I found a great Couch, Loveseat and Recliner set for a great price!!! YAY! I think it will look really nice in our new apartment and it is SO comfy. It will come on the 9th.   After that, we had dinner and watched some of the Sox game at J.J. McKay's in Wayland... My old hood.   Tomorrow I am bringing Berkley to the vet at 9:00am and then Mom is coming over to help me wrap the breakables. I am going to grab plenty of newspaper to wrap with... Thanks Dave for your brilliance!   I saw Erica and Allen at the bank today... They just got back from Hawaii and they seem to be absolutely thrilled with life.

      The Yard Sale 2004 was successful! It was our fourth annual sale, and we were successful money-wise, but more importantly, we had the greatest time!! Friday Mom made about 27 signs for us to hang up!!! She did a really good job and everyone who came commented on how great our signs were. Friday afternoon, Carol and I drove around for three hours and hung signs on telephone poles, desperately trying not to get runover. It was quite funny. About 10 people we know drove past us and said hello at one point or another. On Saturday and Sunday we all arrived at 7:00am(ish) each day and started the set up. On Saturday Michele greeted us at 11:30 with bagels and set up her stuff as well. Mom provided us all with constant beverages and a lovely spread for lunch both days. Carol brought gorgeous fruit, Andrew spent a lot of time hanging out and helping us, and Allen helped Carol stransort goods. Bob helped us both days with the set-up and clean-up. And then Mom and Bob, and Carol, Andrew and Michele all chipped in to help take down the signs. So thanks to everyone!! It really was so much fun. At the end of last night we all got pizza and had some wine and beer to toast a successful 2004. And if you didn't make it this year, be sure to be there in 2005!! =)   There was certainly one downer to the weekend... My grandparents were missing for the first time. And it led to a few emotional breakdowns for all of us over the course of the weekend. At one point, an older gentleman came to our house. He walked straight right up the driveway and didn't look at anything we were selling. He just came right up to my mother and I and said "Where's that older fellow that's here every year?" And after meeting my Grandfather at our first sale in 2001, he has returned every year ONLY to come and visit with my Grandfather. And he was concerned about where Grandpa was and disappointed to find out he was unable to visit with him this year. Also, when my Mom told Grandma that Carol and I were hanging up the signs, she said "ohhhh, that's my job!" And everytime something sold of my grandparents it was sad, because they always get so excited when something of theirs sells and they like to meet the person who is buying it and talk about it. But... Next year right?   unfortunately I don't have any news to share yet about my Grandmother. On Friday we thought she would be coming home today, but I think things may have turned back the other way over the weekend. I will let you know as soon as I hear anything, but my Mom says that when she spoke with her yesterday she sounded really bad. We need to get her home.   And last night I watched the movie "Monster" which was freaky and then I took Nyquil and passed out.

      I am so relieved that it is Friday and that I actually made it through this week!!! Not that the work is over... My family along with the Prices, and Michele are having our annual Yard Sale this weekend. My Grandparents have always come too, but since she is till in the hospital, they obviously wont be able to make it this year. However, so characteristic of my Grandmother... Just like she made and froze meatballs and soup and eggplant and sauce, etc. for all of us to eat while she was she was in the hospital, she also packed the packages full of items to send to us to sell at the Yard Sale before she went into surgery. She is too much! So, although we will miss them a ton, and it will be hard without them, they will be with us in thought!   My grandmother seams to be finally recovering. Slowly but surely. So please continue to pray for her.   Anyhow, I am off now to go and hang up yard sale signs with my mom and Carol, and start pricing items. If you want to come to the sale, email me and I'll give you the info!!

      My Grandmother was supposed to come home from the hospital today. But, in the middle of the night, her foot and leg went numb. She thought it had just fallen asleep, but it turns out that her heart released a clot and it lodged in her leg. So, within the hour they need to do emergency surgery on her leg to remove the clot. This without knowing if her heart is strong enough. And then, it's back to square one with the recovery. Please pray for her in the next hour.

      Well... There's no change with my Grandma thus far. But, she's hanging in there and she's a tough cookie. Always has been. If you are looking for someone to look up to, my Grandparents are perfect. The perfect example of love. Anyhow, there was an open house at my apartment tonight. So... We'll see!

      So I went to Connecticut on Saturday morning with my Mom and my Step-Father Bob. We drove straight to New Haven to  urlLink Saint Raphael's Hospital . My family has become quite familiar with Saint Raphael's Hospital over the last few years. On Christmas Day 2001 my Mom had emergency surgery at Saint Raphael's. On Christmas Eve we sat down to dinner in North Haven, CT, at my Grandparents' house and suddenly my mom became extremely ill. After a few hours of her being in agonizing stomach pain, I called the ER and asked for advice, and we decided to take her in. We stayed in the ER all Christmas Eve night and then on Christmas Day they performed surgery to release her intestine from where it had been logged between her stomach and liver. Then in 2002 my Grandfather had surgery at that same hospital to remove his colon cancer. And now, my Grandmother is there after her surgery to remove the tumor from her kidney. So, needless to say, we don't have fond memories of this hospital, but they have been wonderful and successful with each of my family members. I have always heard that things come in threes, so WE HAVE REACHED 3!!!! Enough already, ok? Anyhow, my Grandmother's surgery went fine, and she is healing perfectly from the actual surgery... EXCEPT that her heart beat and blood pressure is now all messed up and fluctuating. They were trying to decide whether or not to move her to the cardiac ward because her heart is now not right. So, nobody in my family slept last night. Mom and Aunt Janet stayed with her in the room overnight, and the rest of us "tried" to sleep at their house. I am home now due to work but may go back after tomorrow. Please continue to pray for us.

      OK, now I have the "moving jitters." I realized that we are moving in like 2 weeks and we need phone, internet, cable, heat, electricity, mail... And I need to pack, and I need to sell my couch. It is oversized and overstuffed, so it wont fit up the stairs in the new place. I have started to make some calls, but this is the kind of thing that really bugs me out until it's all done. I need to sell my couch soon, because I want to use the money towards the new couch. And I am all for one or two yummy sushi meals on the floor, but hey, I like to watch TV on a big comfy couch!! Let me know if you are interested in buying it!  I am off to Connecticut tomorrow am to see my Grandmother in the hospital and will return Sunday night.

      I have my job review today at work. I am really nervous... I hate job reviews. I wish they just did it all in writing like a report card in grade school. I don't like the face-to-face aspect of it =) By the way, the Website that I work on is www.SearchWin2000.com you should check it out! It is a  urlLink TechTarget  website. Anyway, wish me luck!!

      My Grandmother had surgery today to remove a tumor they found on her kidney. It was a 3.5 hour surgery and we were all very nervous... But my mother called and let me know that everything went very well, and the tumor is benign!!!! She is in recovery now and doing well. PHEW!!!! I will go and visit her in the hospital this weekend. Thanks to all of you who prayed for her.

      So I realized today that it is halfway through the month and I have things going on every weekend for the rest of June. So... I started to pack. I didn't realize how sad and emotional it was going to be to prepare to leave the Crank. I know things will be ok, but right now it's going to be a tough ride.

      I decided to try to help my landlord out and post the apartment on Craig's List. Hopefully this listing will help to reach a broader audience than she has been able to thus far.

      Today is SO beautiful. I am in the best mood. How can you complain about anything when the weather is like this? Even the fact that while I was in the office today my landlord came to my apartment to "check and see if anything needed repairs" AKA "make sure the cats were not back." Nope... Doesn't bother me at all.

      I can't believe of all the nights I decided to lay-low and pass on going out, I missed something that would have been like a dream for me!!!&nbsp; Steph, Marcus and Pete got to hang out with some of the  urlLink New England Patriots ! Now  urlLink Steph  is one of the BIGGEST  urlLink Red Sox  fans that I know, so I know that she would love to meet the guys on the Sox... So go figure that she was there and got to meet the Pats! Now watch me meet the Sox... Well actually, I wouldn't mind meeting one specific player. I have a slight obsession with  urlLink Bronson Arroyo  ... Shhhhhhh. Anyhow, at WaterWorks last night, the guys and Steph saw  urlLink Willie McGinest ,  urlLink Joe Andruzzi ,  urlLink Lonie Paxton  and  urlLink Richard Seymour . AND they got to see their brand new rings... awesome.   Needless to say, next time my friends go to WaterWorks, I will be there!

      I am so sad it's over... I had so much fun throughout the year with Erica and Allen planning their big day and the actual wedding was PERFECT! It was a gorgeous day... Sunny, not a cloud in the sky, no humidity, 70 degrees. Erica was so calm and happy, I couldn't even believe she was getting married that day. Everything went perfectly. It was a gorgeous ceremony and a rocking reception. NOTHING went wrong, except her alternate bouquet got lost, but in the large scheme of things that is nothing. I think the pictures will come out beautifully. We took some at her parent's house before we left and then we went to the Bentley College Bridge, which is famous for the scenery. The hotel itself was beautiful and had a perfect manicured courtyard with a gazebo... We took more pictures there. The food was great and we danced our butts off. Erica and Allen are now off to Hawaii. They will have a fabulous time. Congrats guys!   Now I am home and have the Sunday night blues in combo with the post-wedding blahs. I got back at around 1:00pm today and since it was sunny and high 80s I tried to go outside and read some magazines in the sun. BUT, I was too tired to even sit up so I took a nap for a few hours.   Tonight Justin, Pete, Marcus and Steph went to  urlLink WaterWorks , a bar in Quincy on the bay. They asked me to go, but there was just no way that I could go out or drink again. So I am going to watch "Just Married" and get food from  urlLink Pic-A-Pasta  in Brighton. If you've never gotten food from there, you MUST! I like the chicken broccoli and penne.   By the way, now our toilet is broken. It wont stop running. AND it is a shade of bright pink, which I find hilarious.

      I am steaming right now and need to get this off my chest. I have 2 Himalayan cats, and their names are Berkley and Chloe. I have had Berkley for 4 years and Chloe for 3... And I love them to death. They are the best cats! They behave very well and do not ruin anything, ever. They are declawed, so the don't scratch and they are very picky about their litter box being clean. Now I admit that on occasion I have been too lax about cleaning out the litter, but never to the point that is was nasty or smelled rancid. AND I am obsessed with cleaning and with good smelling candles.  Anyhow, on July 1 my lease is up and Steph and I are moving into a gorgeous 2-bedroom in Watertown. It is owned by the same landlord that owns the 1-bedroom I live in now. On the Thursday before Memorial day, my landlord called and asked me to "send my cats away" while she is trying to rent out my 1-bedroom. She felt that having them here with their litter-box and their hair was somehow keeping people from wanting the place. So, I obliged and called my mother and dropped them off to her house the next day. Thank God she was willing to help me and take them on for a while... She already has one cat, Snowball, so this leaves her with three.   So it's been a few weeks now, and not a person has looked at the apartment, and I miss my cats and it's really not fair to my Mom (although she has not complained at all) nor the cats, to leave them there much longer. So yesterday I called the landlord and asked her when I could bring my cats back. She just called back and this was the conversation:  LL: Jennifer, you can NOT bring those cats back as I have not yet rented the apartment and they are really causing a problem for me renting the apartment. ME: OK, well, I was just hoping to bring them back soon since they are my pets, and my responsibility, not my mother's. LL: (Demeaning voice) Jennifer, I am extremely concerned about them in the new apartment as well since it has a carpeting and cats pee on rugs. ME: Not all cats pee on rugs. My cats have NEVER EVER peed on a rug. They will not pee on the rugs. LL: Well, I don't want my apartment to be ruined. ME: As I said, they do not pee on rugs, they ONLY go to the bathroom in their litter box. My mother has a very nice house. Do you think my Mother would let the cats stay at her house if they were going to pee on her rugs? LL: Well in addition, you have not done a very good job at keeping the apartment clean **YES I HAVE!!!** and I hope that you will do a better job when you move into the new place. ME: Uh-huh (I couldn't say anything else because I was fuming and I was scared I would say something mean and nasty... Because I am a clean FREAK!!!) LL: Jennifer, there have been times when the hallway has smelled and it was coming from your apartment. I hope you are going to do better. ME: UH-HUH (GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR... ) LL: Uh-huh responses aren't making me feel very confident, is that a yes? ME: The apartment is going to be where we LIVE, do you think I want to live in a dirty smelly place?????????????????????????? LL: OK, thanks, and don't bring the cats back ME: I hung up.

      Today is just beautiful... Sunny, 70, not a cloud in the sky! I am getting ready to meet Erica at her house and then we will head to Indulgence Day Spa for our manicures and pedicures... Erica and Allen gave us gift certificates last night for us to use today! They also gave us an adorable hat box with matching notes, a framed picture of the bridal party, beautiful pearl earrings and a gorgeous silver necklace with a diamond and pearl pendant. I was especially spoiled by this gift because pearl is my birth stone! We will wear the jewelry tomorrow with our dresses.

      A woman who was at a Red Sox game got hit in the face with a ball... Now she tries to sue the Red Sox. Is it just me, or is that the most ridiculous thing ever?  Also, Brittany Spears got rushed to the hospital after hurting her knee while dancing. She has to have emergency surgery. Poor Brit.

      I have so much to do and no time to do it. Saturday Erica and Allen are getting married and I am in the wedding. Tonight we are having the rehearsal dinner at  urlLink The Chateau  in Waltham... The food is SO yummy there, and it will be really great to see Erica and Allen et al. Then tomorrow, Erica is treating the bridal party to a spa day. She is so sweet. I am going to bring cheese and crackers, so I need to go and buy all that stuff. Today is Amy's birthday and since she is coming to the rehearsal dinner as well tonight, we are going to celebrate with her tomorrow night. We are going to a Tapas restaurant, which I love!&nbsp;I actually just went to  urlLink Dali  in Somerville for my birthday. I LOVE that place. If you haven't been there, you must go! Actually, if you go to the website, they have a picture of the exact place&nbsp;I sat. The sangria is unbelievable! Try and take a cab there so you wont have to drive =) Anyhow, tomorrow night we are staying at the hotel that the wedding will be at. It's the  urlLink Renaissance Boston Bedford Hotel  which I have heard is gorgeous. Saturday morning I have to go to Erica's mother's house in Newton and then we are getting our hair and makeup done. The wedding starts at 3:00pm. We will stay at the hotel Saturday night as well. I am very excited. Now let's just hope the dress fits after all the eating coming up!   By the way, Pecker was terrible and my fish is still alive.

      I&nbsp;had to put in my ACs tonight. It is 93 degrees. It is just too unbearable and I wouldn't have been able to sleep. I think there is something wrong with my fish because it is going crazy in the bowl and it barely ever moves... Maybe he is too hot! If it dies it will be the 13th fish I have had die in 2 months... Long story.   I am watching the movie "Pecker" that I got from  urlLink Netflix , I'll let you know how it is.    urlLink Steph  is upstairs watching the Sox with Pete, but they are on rain delay. She is lucky because she gets to sleep in Justin's room with his AC while he is away. Sure beats sleeping on my couch!!

      As I was writing about my Mom's experience with red wine spillage, it made me remember one time that I accidentally spilled some wine and felt just horrible. I was living in the North End with one of my best friends, Lisa. (Lisa recently got engaged... YAY!!) We had this little fire escape type of thing outside the window of our kitchen. At the time, I would have an occasional cigarette.  urlLink Which is BAD!  And I no longer ever smoke. Anyhow, I climbed out the kitchen window onto the fire escape and when I was coming back in, I knocked over my glass of red wine onto poor Lisa's kitchen rug... A woven wool rug. I felt terribly. She had to have it dry cleaned and I paid for it, but even then the stain didn't come completely out. If ONLY I knew about  urlLink Wine Away  then! Sorry Lis... I will always feel bad about that.

      My Mom just came by to pick up the Wine Away (see below) and she brought my mail from my Mother and Step-Father's address, which I have not lived at for years, yet people continue to send me things there. One thing I recieved really annoyed me. I am a huge fan and supporter of the  urlLink MSPCA  and I have sent in donations... But they send people address labels and note pads with the wrong info on them! I got all these address labels today, with the wrong address on them and my name spelled wrong on the note pad. What a waste of money!! There's nothing I can do with them but throw them out.

      My Mother just called. She had a retirement party at her house last night for a great guy that she works with. Problem is, someone spilled red wine all over the dining room... NO, it was not me... I know I usually am the "spiller" but I wasn't even there, I swear! Anyhow, she knew to call me since I have become a pro at removing red wine stains. She is coming by to pick up this great product that I once discovered. You've got to check it out. It's called  urlLink Wine Away  and it really does remove wine stains from anything!!

      I have always loved this kind of thing... Since I was little. My favorite books are biographies or those written in "diary format," and my favorite TV shows and movies are definitely from the reality genre. I love reading other people's blogs, and how great this is going to be to have my own!! Even if I am the only one who reads it =) Plus, I love to write... Ask any of my friends, it's hard to go a week without finding some sort of mail from me in their mailbox... That's right, I still LOVE the good old fashioned pen and paper snail-mail.   I am going to use this to share funny anecdotes from my life, complain, share good products, clothes, shoes, books etc. that I have found, complain, tell you the really strange things that are going on in my mind, and whatever else comes out of my fingertips. Oh, did I mention complain??  OK, so I hope you keep reading! This is so much fun!!

       I went to Sue's shower yesterday. Corrine and I chipped in for a gift, and then I realized last-minute that there was a gift wrapping contest. I had nothing, so I decided to go through my photo albums and magazines and make a collage out of wedding stuff on the Crate and barrel boxes. It was so last minute and I was so stressed.&nbsp; It was all so last minute, but guess what? My gift got 3rd place prize!&nbsp; I couldn't believe it! But YAY!     &nbsp;   Last night we all went to the Bell and Hand for Nelson and Kim's going away party.&nbsp; It was a good time, but I was not feeling well and had to leave early.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;   Today I did not leave my apartment at all. I didn't feel well and I had to miss Cathy's shower in the Cape =( I fell terribly!! Hopefully I will feel better tomorrow.

       Steph and I had our Housewarming party last Friday night. It was so much fun. I think over the course of the night we had about 50 people. Everyone was so sweet to bring something, whether it was food, alcohol or gifts, we appreciated all of it. You would not believe how much alcohol was consumed!!!! An entire keg of Bud Light was gone, a handle of Captain Morgan's empty, a huge bottle of Grey Goose vodka finished, one bottle of Stoli Raz consumed, and most of another bottle and a stoli vanilla bottle. On top of that, about 6 bottles of red wine went, a huge jug of sangria, and all the cans and bottles of beer that were in the fridge! That a whole lot for 50 people!     &nbsp;   It was great to see everyone... That was definitely the best part. However, I spent three days cleaning and I am not at all planning another party anytime soon.&nbsp; Maybe a Patriots party though   =)     &nbsp;   On Monday I left for Ogunquit, Maine for our annual family vacation. We stayed at  urlLink the Milestone  which was a first for us. Our old hotel got bought out by a new place and they are doing time-share rentals only! BUMMER! However, the Milestone was fine! The pool there was gorgeous and that is the most important thing to me. Mom, Steph and I stayed in one room, with Steph on a cot and mom and I sharing a bed. It was the smallest room we have ever rented... Not a condo type of place like we are used to, but we made the best of it. Michele and Adam stayed next door on one side of us, and Carol and Lisa stayed on the other side. Allan and Andrew came for a night as well.&nbsp; Bob is on his white water rafting trip in the Grand Canyon.     &nbsp;   Monday night, Steph, Andrew, Lisa, Adam and I headed across the street to  urlLink Vinny's . We really love that place... We have gone there for the past three years, and we went there this year Monday night for dinner, Tuesday night for dinner, and then Wednesday night for Lisa's 21st birthday! On the website Vinny has a picture of him and the Patriots Cheerleaders. Well, on Lisa's 21st Birthday we MET vinny and took a picture (see above)&nbsp;with him too... Hahaha. Not quite the same. Also Monday night we all went in the hot-tub late night.     &nbsp;   Tuesday we all sat by the pool at the hotel, and then when it rained, we moved up into the room and had two games of Gin-Rummy going. Then we went back out to the pool and enjoyed the rest of the sun and Gina joined us. That night we all went back to Vinny's for dinner and drinks, with Gina this time.     &nbsp;   Wednesday we all sat by the pool again. It was a beautiful day! In the morning Steph and Gina went for a walk on the beach. In the afternoon, I walked into town and purchased a bunch of things for Lisa's birthday celebration that night. We all went to dinner that night at  urlLink Jackie's Too   . It was Lisa's choice, but it is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Ogunquit. We had a great time.     &nbsp;   After dinner Steph and Andrew went home to Boston. The rest of us, plus Gina's parents Paula and David, gathered at the hotel and had cake and a champagne toast.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   At 12:00 Adam, Gina, Lisa and I headed to Vinny's again so that she could get into a bar being legal for the first time! It was fun. We had a drink and headed home.     &nbsp;   Thursday morning we all packed up and went to the  urlLink Egg and I  for our annual last breakfast (see picture above.) After breakfast we headed home.     &nbsp;   Now we are back and it is always very hard to come home from vacation. Tonight, Ame, Jay and I are going to the Red Sox vs. Yankees game. GO SOX!!!!

      Steph is in CT tonight visiting Marcus. I was happy to be able to do whatever I could to prepare for our house warming tomorrow night.&nbsp; Mostly Steph took care of all of her stuff, so it is my things that are all over the place. And my room was a disaster. It is 9:34 and I am already just so beat.  &nbsp;  Tomorrow I have to finish my Featured Topic on SearchWin2000.com and then prepare for missing the next week of work. Then my mother is coming over to make food for our party and help me prepare. Steph got part of the day off, so she will help too! She has already done more than I have.  &nbsp;  I think the party will be fab.

      On Friday I went to  urlLink Foxwoods  for the weekend...&nbsp;It was fabulous! Going to Foxwoods for the weekend is totally different from visiting for a few hours to gamble. Friday night&nbsp;I arrived, unpacked, changed and then had a few cocktails and an appetizer at  urlLink The Intermezzo Lounge.  Then&nbsp;I proceeded to the gourmet restaurant  urlLink Paragon  which was so amazing. It was at the top of the Grand Pequot Tower (where&nbsp;I stayed) and had a gorgeous view. The food was fabulous. It was a great night.   Saturday&nbsp;I woke up and ordered room service breakfast.&nbsp;I got an omelet and unfortunately they mistakenly put salmon in it. I love salmon, but it REALLY did not taste good in the morning in an omelet. From there&nbsp;I went down to the casinos. First I tried&nbsp;my luck at the slots... And lost my money and fast! I still feel that I will be the one to hit the huge jackpot someday. Then I played my usual game of roulette.&nbsp;&nbsp;  I decided to have a quick and casual lunch at the  urlLink Veranda Cafe . Then I took a nap and did not stir again until 9:00pm.&nbsp;I showered and went down to try&nbsp;my luck again at 10:30pm.   At about 1:00am I was starving and decided to have&nbsp;my "dinner."&nbsp;I really did it Vegas style!&nbsp;I ate at  urlLink The Golden Dragon  a Japanese restaurant. YUMMY sushi!!   Sunday&nbsp;I slept until 12:00 and then packed and checked out.&nbsp;I couldn't resist spending the rest of the day there though, so&nbsp;I proceeded to eat at  urlLink The Festival Buffet . Then&nbsp;I tried&nbsp;my luck one more time and FINALLY won at roulette!!   When&nbsp;I came home,&nbsp;I rented the movie  urlLink The Butterfly Effect . It was terrific and you must see it!   It was a wonderful weekend overall! Hey, and if you are looking for a good, light book to read, check out "Shop Girl" by Steve Martin... Yes, THE Steve Martin.

      We are all moved in now. Today we got our cable, internet and phone hooked up, and despite past negative experiences with Comcast, the gentleman who came to hook me up today knew exactly what he was doing and did everything correctly. It was such a nice difference! AND my cats are finally home! Berkley and Chloe are still adjusting to the new surroundings, but they are home, and that's all that matters. Tomorrow my couch set get delivered and then this apartment is going to be fab! I am so excited!!
