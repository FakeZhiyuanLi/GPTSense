						    Following is an excerpt from an article by Randolph T. Holhut:       Dan Kennedy, the media critic of the Boston Phoenix, pulled this telling nugget from Bill Clinton's autobiography, "My Life". In the passage, Clinton tells about a conversation he had with former Wyoming senator Alan Simpson regarding the political leanings of the press.      "You know", Simpson said, "before you (Clinton) were elected, we Republicans believed most of the press was liberal. Now we have a more sophisticated view. They are liberal in a way. Most of them voted for you, but they think more like your right-wing critics do, and that's much more important... Democrats like you...get into government to help people. The right-wing extremists don't think government can do much to improve human nature, but they do like power. So does the press.  And since you're president, they both get power the same way, by hurting you.      In other words, on social hot-button issues such as same-sex marriage, abortion rights and gun control - issues that ultimately aren't that important in the larger scheme of things - there is a liberal bias in the corporate press. On the important issues, such as the economy and the national security state, the corporate press sits squarely on the right. And, to counteract the perennial cry of liberal bias by conservatives, the corporate press goes out of its way to attack liberal politicians.      Randolph T. Holhut has been a journalist in New England for more than 20 years. He edited "The George Seldes Reader" (Barricade Books). He can be reached at randyholhut@yahoo.com  .

              "I have no problems with that issue [same-sex  marriage] at all. ... Marriage has been undermined by divorce. So  don't tell me about marriage. ... People should look at their own life and  look in their own mirror. I think marriage has been undermined for a number  of years, if you look at the facts and figures on it. So don't blame the gay,  lesbian, transgender, transsexual community, please don't blame them for  it."  -- Chicago Mayor Richard Daley at a Feb. 18 press  conference.

      I'm sure we're all absorbed in the Democratic National Convention, but I wanted to share an observation about the whole "e-voting" issue.    As you're probably aware, the problem with e-voting machines is that they don't provide an audit trail and are very easily "hacked"... It's already happened in California.    What you may  NOT , however, be aware of is the fact that the "preferred" e-voting machine is made by a company called  Diebold . Another point of interest is that the owner of  Diebold  (a privately held company) is a  HUGE  supporter of the  Bush Regime  (both financially and in ideology).    The "logic" forwarded by  Diebold  for not allowing computer scientists access to their code is that it would violate their "intellectual property" rights. This is a thinly veiled way of saying, "Forget it! You simply have to TRUST that we wouldn't manipulate results." (These machines are to be used in Florida... So much for trust and/or a fair election!)      Diebold   has also said that it isn't possible or practical to design the machines so they will produce a paper audit trail.      This is where it gets really scary...     I was running a little short on cash the other day and, like we all do, headed to the nearest ATM for a quick infusion of green backs. I inserted my card, entered my code, selected withdraw, entered the amount. POOF! Just like that, money came out of the machine. THEN, it asked me if I would like to make another transaction. I said no, and it asked me if I wanted a RECEIPT. I said, YES, and it spit out a piece of paper with x's over all but the last portion of my account number (to identify that, yes, I had indeed accessed funds from MY account), the amount I withdrew and my current balance.     NOTE: I did this at an ATM that isn't affiliated with my bank, and STILL got this information...     As I was preparing to drive off, the manufacturer's name on the machine hit me like a ton of bricks!       DIEBOLD      Now, I'm not always the sharpest knife in the drawer but this one's a real no-brainer that even Gomer Pyle could understand! If  DIEBOLD  can make an ATM that can access, process and supply all this information, why in the world can't they make their voting machines do the same thing???    Could it be because they don't WANT them TO??? You decide.

      Wow! I've been glued to MSNBC tonight. Their objective, yet positive, coverage of John Kerry is heartening... I like Kerry. I'm a Democrat.    Now I have reason to like Kerry beyond party affiliation.    If only Texas were a battle ground state!    Where are you, fellow Texas DEMOCRATS??? Let's mobilize. Knock doors. Be prepared to have doors slammed in your face. BUT... for every slammed door is an open window.     WE CAN DO IT...       A tremendous kudo to my friend, mentor and inspiration... Terri Procell Bowen... Her husband, Bill, is representing Texas as a delegate at the convention... For every person who says that you must be wealthy and "connected" to have a voice I say, "Talk to Bill Bowen."       Bill is an educator. Yes, we all know that teachers are the best paid of professionals. Thank you, Bill, for representing the common man/woman.

            Does anyone out there remember Bush's 2003 State of the Union Address? I know I sure do... This man is the king of bait and switch... You know, promise one thing and then deliver something completely different...

      A passage from Bob Woodward's recent book quotes Bush as saying,  "I do not need to explain why I say things. That's the interesting thing about being the president. Maybe somebody needs to explain to me why they say something, but I don't feel like I owe anybody an explanation."     Well, that just about puts the bow on THAT arrogant package. Mr. Bush should be forced to repeat this quote, face-to-face, to every single family that has lost a loved one in Irag... One family at a time.

      Check in again for my diatribe on Shrub and his miserable AIDS policy. All I'll say now is, "Liar, liar, pants on fire!"

      OK, so whether you're in favor or opposed to this whole notion of "gay marriage", the Republican arm of our government (not just the Congress but I'll include our Pretender-In-Chief in this, too) are now pissing and moaning about the "radical justices" overstepping their bounds. They use this logic to, in effect, castrate the judicial system.    Last time I read the Constitution, there was a reason for THREE (not 2) branches of government. It's called checks and balances, Mr. Shrub. SO, perhaps Bush&Co. should brush up on the Constitution, instead of using it as so much Charmin.    There are a couple of problems with this failed Amendment...    FIRST and foremost, the notion that it even made it out of committee is frightening! What's up with that? Poor delusional John Cornyn thinking that Constitutionally legislating morality into the Constitution would just make the GLBT community go rushing back into our cramped little closests like so many roaches when the lights are turned on!    SECOND, those "radical justices" legislating from the bench are doing their jobs! It's up to each branch of the government to keep the others in line (or at least provide a modicum of fairness!). The radical right is tramping so many sour grapes on this one! If the courts were in agreement with them (think the Supremes annointing Shrub to the throne), they would be putting them on a pedestal of piety.    THIRD and most important, our Constitution has never been used to limit rights, but only to expand them. Think women's suffrage, a woman's right to choose, the abolishment of slavery, Civil Rights for ethnic and gender minorities, the legal voting age being established at 18.    Now, the House has lost its collective mind (following on the heels of the Senate) with its "Marriage Protection Act" which passed 233-to-194. This  Act would bar federal courts from hearing challenges to parts of the DOMA (a piece of bad legislation in itself, even if Clinton DID sign it).    I'll save "Civil Rights for ethnic and gender minorities" for another upcoming rant.

        Reminds me of the old folk song, "For every season, TURN, TURN, TURN"...  Following is an excerpt from an article by Molly Ivins that I found at  urlLink www.thesmirkingchimp.com &nbsp;(which is one of my favorite web sites, by the way):   "For the first two days I was on this media marathon, the story du jour was the Senate Intelligence Committee report that concluded the CIA was just flat wrong on its pre-war calls on Iraq. Wrong abut the weapons of mass destruction, wrong about connections to Al Qaeda, wrong about Saddam Hussein having a nuclear program and so on. All of which we already knew the government had been wrong about, but this was the Official Report.So here's the Republican reaction: "See, the CIA was wrong, so you people owe President Bush an apology." I'm sitting there, brilliantly riposting, "Huh?" Here's the chain of logic. The CIA was wrong, therefore those on the left who say President Bush lied to us are wrong because he wasn't lying, he just believed the CIA. And you people are being rude and hateful and ugly and just mean about President Bush, and we want an apology.What I'm worried about here is the amnesia factor. Am I the only person around who distinctly remembers an entire 18 months ago? This is what happened: The CIA was wrong, but it wasn't wrong enough for the White House, which kept pushing the spies to be much wronger. The CIA's lack of sufficient wrongness was so troubling to the anxious Iraq hawks that they kept touting their own reliable sources, such as Ahmad Chalabi and his merry crew of fabulists. The neo-cons even set up their very own little intelligence shop in the Pentagon to push us into this folly in Iraq."  The full article was originally on&nbsp;the Working For Change website and the direct link url follows:  urlLink  http://www.workingforchange.com/article.cfm?itemid=17337    Is the everyday American ever going to wake up and smell the coffee??? How many lies does this administration have to tell before someone stands up and shouts, "The sky is NOT falling...oh, and by the way your NOSE IS GROWING"...

                   I don't know the original source of this but would be glad to give them "props" if anyone out there does know...                Saddam was a good guy when Reagan armed him, a bad guy when Bush's daddy made war on him, a good guy when Cheney did business with him and a bad guy when Bush needed a "we can't find Bin Laden" diversion.    Trade with Cuba is wrong because the country is communist, but trade with China and Vietnam is vital to a spirit of international harmony.    A woman can't be trusted with decisions about her own body, but multinational corporations can make decisions affecting all mankind without regulation.    Jesus loves you, and shares your hatred of homosexuals and  Hillary Clinton.    The best way to improve military morale is to praise the  troops in speeches while slashing veterans' benefits and combat pay.    If  condoms are kept out of schools, adolescents won't have sex.    Providing  health care to all Iraqis is sound policy. Providing health care to all  Americans is socialism.    HMOs and insurance companies have the best  interests of the public at heart.    Global warming and tobacco's link to  cancer are junk science, but creationism should be taught in schools.    A  president lying about an extramarital affair is an impeachable   offense.   A president lying to enlist support for a war in which thousands die is solid  defense policy.    Government should limit itself to the powers named in the Constitution, which include banning gay marriages and censoring the Internet.    The public has a right to know about Hillary's cattle trades,  but George Bush's cocaine conviction is none of our business.    Being a drug addict is a moral failing and a crime, unless you're a conservative radio host. Then it's an illness, and you need our prayers for your recovery.    You support states' rights, which means Attorney General John Ashcroft can tell states what local voter initiatives they have the right to adopt.    What Bill Clinton did in the 1960s is of vital national interest,  but   what Bush did in the '80s is irrelevant.

              Finally, Ron tells it like it is! I'm not sure if he was shackled by the "keep it positive" mantra of the Democratic Party but this is certainly a more comprehensive analysis of the Bush regime... Follow the link to the full article in Esquire magazine.
