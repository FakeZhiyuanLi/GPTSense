      I was wrong. It's 8 hours, not 6! *sobs* And Philippa will be there so we have to be good or she'll tell people we suck and then they won't come see us

      Riiiight! I've been told to update this but I'm sure something will come to me as i write this! or i could just rabbit on about how i have nothing to say!  Urgh! Giant practice tomorrow, 6 hours or something ridiculous, my fingers will never be the same again! But i have to persuade people that it's a good idea to cover "Liberty" by agnostic front because they rock! And its an impressive song! Oh Pants i forgot to go to the most sexy of pixies to get my hair cut & dyed. She's the only person i trust to cut my hair cos all the hairdressers are like "It's a guy, get the shaving machines" and everyone else i know who'd do it is all emo and i can't be in our band with emo hair! Paul would spazm! I'm gonna get philippa to dye it tho. Just cos thats a reason for her to come here. Hehehe! Silly holly having breakfast at twenty to one. What's the world coming to? Loves you neway you crazy thing Hmmm...

      What a dismal day, the sunshine has all gone. not that i've been outside anyway so i don't see why it matters, but theres something rubbesh about having to have the heating on at this time of year. Maybe it's just this draughty old house. I finally finished writing my french thing but i'm not gonna check it with Mr. Stone cos he'll pick at it and it'll end up saying what he wants. Is it just the french teachers i have had that do this? Probably not but as only 3 people have my link i'll probably be in a minority. I sound really bored and depressed in this but i'm actually not that bad. Wow, i went through a whole entry without mentioning holly oh...nuts... Hmmm...

      Prepare for a moan! Grr! I hate study leave! It's so much worse than school, at least then i have people around me to make it bearable! At home i don't get anything done either cos i'm spending all of the time being told to do something, or cos i'm answering fone calls that arent for me. The fone hasnt stopped ringing all day. well, thats not quite true, it stopped ringing wen i answered it but 10mins later it would ring again. Why doesnt anyone ever ring me, my parents are always getting fone calls. If i ever meet Alex Fairhurst of the medical sickness centre i'll shove everything within arms reach up his nose. TWAT!!! Leave me alone, she'll ring you when she gets back! I don't need to be rung to ask whether she's home yet cos if she was, she'd have rung you. YOU TIT! And i have tan-lines again. I'd rather be pale, but noooo, i have to have weird looking arms! fuck tits ass bollocks wank etc...!!!! *calm* Hmmm... P.S. - Holly! Haha It does now :p

      Hannah sent me a pic of her "parts most private" It was very worrying! Never, ever do that to me again! Anyone! *Scared* I still don't quite understand why, something to do with Steve. Yay, I have all my luffly CD's back although at the moment I'm not listening to as much music as normal, I spose it's because i usually listen to it on the bus and i'm not at school. AAAH, fook, i forgot to go to Norwich on saturday to meet finnie! He was gonna finalise all the details 'bout our gig. Ah well, i'm sure he'll ring me. *hint hint* Hmmm...

      Mmmm, Barbeque! I'm so fat! As soon as my metabolism slows down i'm gonna weigh a tonne! I eat way too much! Like, more than most african countries.  Oooh, first gig nerves starting to kick in, especially cos the strings i bought require fiddling with to get the right note. I cant believe i bought the wrong gauge strings, what the fuck is the difference between "standard" and "medium" anyway. Surely by definition they're the same thing! Hmmm...

      Boring, boring day!!! I have french revision to do but i don't know where to start as i really can't be assed and i just remembered i have to finish writing my oral which is totally gonna bomb in the exham cos i'm crap wen it comes to remembering great big tracts of writing. I know i'll forget what i'm saying 1/2 way thru and the only reason i got an A last year is cos i'm good at the reading and listening bits but theyre stuck together this year and theyre not worth as much so i'm gonna suck!!! AAAGH!!! *stressed* there's too much going on in my head and none of it's helping!!! I just wanna forget all about everything and pass these exhams to get father to leave me alone about them! I need a lock on my door cos he keeps coming in and nagging me and it's getting on my tits.  Wow, Fookn essay or what? and only one person knows the address. Hmm... xxx

      I, I still recall, The first full moon in may, 'Neath whose rays we lay together, And those bright nights on glassy waves, When we would glide lightly away, From the grain, For wicked flights of pleasure.  Those visions fade, Like ghosts to lifes parade, Though incisions once made her so vivid, A scarlet whore, With both heels in the door, Of a heaven severed from me, Insipid.  And midst the writhe of parapets, Where angels sigh, Lonely she sits, Upon the lip, Only a slip from whence I beg her.  That i would wish, Her kiss a chrysalis, To break to make my fluttered heart amiss, And in those frozen moments won, From grief that creeps to wreathe the sun, In drapes inwove with deathshead wing, I thank god for the suffering.  Love would have conquered all, But for the rapture, That ancient plan for my defeat, Denied faith skies that would have set her free, It seems again dreams wend to capture  Once dancing in a spotlit waltz, Through a shadow dimension, Given to the rivers that bedizened her eyes, The world drifted by in lost momentum  With no divine intervention  Regardless that the author, Of sin was me and I, Lay chaste of hate in Faith's embrace, As mortals warred with more besides  They warred with life itself, And in those frozen moments won, From grief that creeps to wreathe the sun, In drapes inwove with deathshead wing, I thank god for the suffering.  And i thank god for the suffering, As i still burn, For her return I would make my peace with everything  I, I still recall, The first full moon in may, Consigned to flames like secret letters, And midst the writhe of parapets, Where angels sigh, Lonely she sits, Upon the lip, Only a slip from whence I beg her.  That i would wish, Her kiss a chrysalis, To break to make my fluttered heart amiss, And in those frozen moments won, From grief that creeps to wreathe the sun, In drapes inwove with deathshead wing, I thank god for the suffering.  Love would have conquered all, Were we not parted, her splintered loss rekindles rage, the winter frost dwindles across my stage, lit up once more to score finales started.  Love would have conquered all,  Love would have conquered... Hate

        if you were a punk band you would be: The Misfits. The Misfits are a punk band from the 80's who used to dress up in wierd costumes. They also had really wierd hair. Maybe you are wierd too. You are probably obsessed with death and killing things. Maybe you are just reaching out for attention. You probably like to stand out from the crowd.     urlLink   What Punk Band Are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      I hate microsoft so much! I'm always torn between going on my pc on crap messenger and going on the windows oopstairs which cuts me off and crashes and is just generally a git. You'd think it was obvious to stay down here and be cool on the beautiful Mac but the lure of webcam with the tres beau holly is sometimes too great. But then it fucks up and i hate it! I want posh messenger! *sulks* *tantrum* Yah, ok, i'm done! But yah, that suckaroo's. And it's gig time this sat! Holly come see me! Pwease! xxx

      *Runs About* Helloo all you out there in computerland, The fantabulous Me hath returned. Today i saw Shrek 2 and It was tres funny and i have a newfound obsession with calling people pigeon. Then we were gonna go to nando's  for some spicy portuguese type food but it was full so i had to trek all the way to St. Benedicts to the Italian place. I forget the name. No, wait, Umberto's Trattoria Italiano. It does killer Lasagne. Well not literally, I lived to tell the tale. As you have witnessed. I'm now going to hut up as this entry is rapidly becoming the nonsensical jabberings of a retard Hmmm...
