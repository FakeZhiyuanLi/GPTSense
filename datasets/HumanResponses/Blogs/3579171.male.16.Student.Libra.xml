After reading in someone else's blog that nice guys only like the bitchy sluts who take advantage of them, how there are many fake nice girls that put their nice guy friends through torture, and how nobody thinks of the genuine nice girls, I realized a few things.  First of all, I think I speak for all the nice guys out there when I say that all nice guys are stupid.  We can't tell if the bitchy sluts are acting or not.  They could be the worse actors in the world and we couldn't tell if that was the real them or just a bad performance.  Second, there are people that think about the nice girls, which is why I am writing this post right now... What? There's nothing else I wanted to mention before I get into the meat of the update.  I'm not going to deny that the nice guys always like the bitchy sluts, we do always like them.  So your thinking, "Are there really nice girls out there?"  Well, of course.  They're the girls that only like the hunky jocks who take advantage of them.  They're the one's that get put through torture by the many fake nice guys which are hunky jocks.  They're the ones that always finish second to first.  They already have several innate advantages: They don't have to act to be nice and every guy, no matter how gay, will always be attracted to a nice girl.  Even though they have these advantages, they have one major flaw that will make them always finsh in second place: Just like nice guys, they are too shy to tell the hunky jock that they obsess over and stalk that they like him.  The other bitchy slut will always get the hunky jock before the nice girl.  Even if the nice girl gathered enough courage to tell the hunky jock that she likes him, the hunky jock will just say the six dread words that every nice guy and girl despises: "I just want to be friends."  But, no matter what happens, the hunky jock will always come back to the nice girl because the nice girl is his "friend."  Before I go, I want to present the nice girl version of the unspoken, until now, unwritted rules.  These set of rules are somewhat original,they have never been seen by the general public.  Here they are:  Do  fantasize about telling him your deepest feelings towards him, prompting him to reveal similar feelings towards you, upon which the two of you will immediately engage in passionate and fulfilling lovemaking.  Do  not actually do this.   Do  listen to entirely too many sappy love songs, especially R&B where almost every song is about a women who can't get any loving.  Do  paste the lyrics to those songs in your AIM profile or online journal where nobody will ever read them, but do it anyway becasue you "love" him and want people to know with out actually telling them.  Do not  actually sing these songs to him, as your voice is terrible.   Do  alienate the rest of your friends when they become concerned about your depression. Pretend that your problems aren't about a guy, even though they are because you would rather have him than all of your friends combined.   Do  drive him around everywhere when he needs to run errands even though you are really busy and will get expelled/fired from school/work.  Do  let him tell you that "you're such a nice girl."  Do not  wash your car after he sits in it.   Do  do bad in your math and physics classes so you can spend all your free time letting a stupid hunky jock tutor you.  Do not  learn the material, even if he isn't in your class, so that he can tutor you and you have an excuse to be with him.  Do  have a hidden agenda that you will never get to.  Do  fantasize about telling him your deepest feelings towards him as he is trying to tutor you, prompting him to reveal similar feelings towards you, upon which the two of you will immediately engage in passionate and fulfilling lovemaking.  Do not  actually expect that to happen because it will not.  Do  start sweating and gibbering like an idiot anytime you're around him because you are a sweaty, gibbering idiot.    Do  listen to him tell you about a great girl he just met.   Do  listen to him complain about his bitchy slut of a girlfriend the next day.  Do  listen to him tell you that he wishes she was more like you.  Do  tell her that everything will work out between him and his bitchy slut of a girlfriend.  Do  shred your intestines by swallowing a chainsaw afterwards.   Do  realize that there is a difference between a nice girl and a pansy.  Do not  realize that you are definately a pansy.    Do  attempt to forget about him. Avoid him as much as possible and never initiate conversation with him.  Do  hate it when he actually tries to talks to you, preventing you from forgetting about him.   Do  write a  horrendously  long Xanga/Blogspot entry detailing your experiences with your platonic friend. Use sarcasm in an attempt to hide your embittered feelings, but make it clear to everyone reading that you still haven't forgotten about him.  - Some loser   Remember people don't need to think about nice girls, they always finish second to first anyway, it's not that bad.  It's better than second to last right? =P  "Nice girls finish second to first."

       It seems that I actually have something to update about this time.   Some  people have read my blog here and have asked me why my blog is so depressing.  Well, actually not  some  more like  a lot .  My blog is not depressing, it's not supposed to be anyway, it's supposed to make you smile or possibly laugh if my recent update is stupid enough.  Didn't you guys read the "About" section?  It says that your not supposed to take most of the stuff I write seriously.  Most of the stuff I write is written in sarcasm, as it says in the "About" section over there ->.  Well, actually all of it is sarcastic except for the first post, of course.  Some people actually told me they cried after reading my blog!  That's not supposed to happen!  Stop crying damn it!  You guys are corrupting the atmosphere of my blog!  Don't cry, just smile, like this, =D, show people your pearly whites.  Now that we're on the subject of crying, why do people cry, get depressed, or get angry?  What's the point of it?  Being angry isn't going to solve your problems.  Crying isn't going to make the pain go away.  Being depressed isn't going to miraculously make your life better.  If you want to solve your problems or make your life better go do out and solve it or make it better yourself.  There's no reason to cry, get depressed, or get mad.  They're all just useless wastes of time.  If you want to change your life, go out and do it yourself, in today's world no one's going to help you.  Damn, this post sounds depressing also.  It's not supposed to be, it just turned out that way.  Maybe it's just me?  Oh well, who cares, it's not like any one cares about this blog... right? q=P  - Some loser

       Every one's heard the infamous saying, “Nice guys finish last.”  I hate to tell you, but it’s not true.  You have to think about it as a race.  The nice guy cares about winning but he wants the other people to be happy also.  So he lets everyone go in front of him…except the last guy.  Why not the last guy?  Easy, because the nice guy doesn’t want to be last.  No matter how nice a guy is he still doesn’t want to be last.  Every person has this drive in them to not be last.  Nice guys are people too.  Of course, there’s the six words that every nice guy hates: “I just want to be friends.”  Even though the nice guy lets everybody, except the last guy, go ahead of him, it doesn’t mean he doesn’t want to win.  The nice guy always has hope that he can win, even when the leader is millimeters from winning and he is a couple steps from the start, just to not be last.  The nice guy always has hope until he hears the six dreaded words.  So if you’re a nice girl and your reading this, never, Never,  NEVER  say those words… ever.  I’ve already mentioned before that there’s always some one behind the nice guy so the actual saying should actually be: “Nice guys finish second to last.”  So remember, nice guys don’t finish last, they finish second to last.  Anyway before I go I’m going to show you the confidential, top-secret rules of being a nice guy.  Trust me, these rules definitely apply to nice guys, I know… not from experience, of course… Taken/stolen from a good friend of mine, here are the unwritten, until now, rules with a couple small changes of course:  Do  fantasize about telling her your deepest feelings towards her, prompting her to reveal similar feelings towards you, upon which the two of you will immediately engage in passionate and fulfilling lovemaking.  Do not  actually do this.   Do  listen to entirely too many sappy love songs, especially punk rock where almost every song is about a kid who can't get any loving.  Do  paste the lyrics to those songs in your AIM profile or online journal where nobody will ever read them.  Do not  actually sing these songs to her.   Do  alienate the rest of your friends when they become concerned about your depression. Pretend that your problems aren't about a girl, even though they are.    Do  drive her around everywhere when she needs to run errands even though you are really busy.  Do  let her tell you that "you're such a nice guy."  Do not  wash your car after she sits in it.    Do  spend all your free time helping her with her math and physics classes.  Do  learn the material, even if you aren't in her class, so that you can tutor her and have an excuse to be with her.  Do  have a hidden agenda.  Do  fantasize about telling her your deepest feelings towards her as you tutor her, prompting her to reveal similar feelings towards you, upon which the two of you will immediately engage in passionate and fulfilling lovemaking.  Do not  actually expect that to happen.  Do  start sweating and gibbering like an idiot anytime you're around her.    Do  listen to her tell you about a great guy she just met.   Do  listen to her complain about her trash of a boyfriend a few weeks later.  Do  listen to her tell you that she wishes he was more like you.  Do  tell her that everything will work out between her and her boyfriend.  Do  shred your intestines by swallowing a butcher knife afterwards.    Do  realize that there is a difference between a nice guy and a wuss.  Do not  realize that you are probably a wuss.    Do  attempt to forget about her. Avoid her as much as possible and never initiate conversation with her.  Do  hate it when she actually tries to talks to you, preventing you from forgetting about her.    Do  write a  horrendously  long Xanga/Blogspot entry detailing your experiences with your platonic friend. Use sarcasm in an attempt to hide your embittered feelings, but make it clear to everyone reading that you still haven't forgotten about her.  - Some loser    !Reminder!  Nice guys finish second to last.

       Ok, I wasn't kidding when I said I didn't have a whole lot of friends.  But, just because I don't have a whole lot of friends doesn't mean I don't have some friends.  The weird thing about my friends is that they all hae one thing in common.  They all seem to be losers also.  It seems that ever person I make friends with just happens to be a loser like me.  When most people makes friends they usually become friends with their friend's friends also.  In my case, I am my friend's friend.  Everybody that I know seems to be a loser.  It's like one big loser network.  Maybe losers are just attracted to me, or maybe I'm attracted to losers.  Maybe all losers are attracted to each other.  Maybe it's a government conspiracy, or it's just in our genes, or we have some unknown force that pulls us all together, who knows?  Gets you thinking, huh?  Well, not really I guess... maybe it's just me.  Maybe I just have way too much time to think.  Damn, I need a hobby.  Oh, by the way, everything I said here only applies to everyone except  Lisa .  "Why not  Lisa ," do you ask?  It's because  Lisa  is cool.  How can  Lisa , who's so damn cool, be a loser?  She just can't.  P.S.  Lisa  is cool!  - Some loser   "The path that we take is not right, it is simply the path that we choose." -Anonymous

       Those of you who have actually found this site may be wondering why I have abandoned Xanga and hopped on the Blogspot band wagon.  It's pretty easy to explain actually, everybody already has a Xanga so I decided to get off that band wagon and hop on another one.  I wanted to be different than the general public, so I created a Blogspot and am going to neglect my Xanga now.  Besides, I don't know how to edit the template on Blogspot so I won't beable to waste time messing with it like I do with my Xanga.  So, why I'm I coming out of retirement now?  It's because I'm bored as hell, that's why.  As you know, boredom seems to be sexually attracted to me.  Writing these horrendously boring blogs seem to keep it away from me for a while.  Besides, writing blogs wastes a lot of time, which I have way too much of at the moment.  Just to show you exactly how much free time I have, I have come up with an inequality:   infinity    Simple huh?  Basically what I'm trying to say by writing this entire post is summerized by these two points: 1.)I think Blogspot is better that Xanga  2.)I am bored!  Oh yeah, one more thing.  I have this qoute that I got from Miyamoto Musashi, some famous samurai but I'm not going to get into his history.  He said,"Do nothing which you will regret."  In his infinite wisdom, still less than my free time, I think he what he actually means is this: "Do everything and regret nothing."  Reach out on a limb, explore the unexplored, do whatever you want, just make sure that when you're done, you don't regret any of it.  I guess that's all, unless I forgot something, which is very likely.  Doesn't matter I guess I'll just put in it my next update, don't wait for it though, it might never come, I might retire again. =P  - Some loser   "Do nothing which you will regret." -Miyamoto Musashi

       For those of you that know me, you know that I've retired from online journal writing.  Since you're reading this it's pretty obvious that I've come out of retirement(again).  Now, you have to be thinking,"What can move  Kent  so much that he will come out of retirement and update?"  Well the answer... Just read the title damn it!  I never, in my entire life, thought I would get to know anybody well enough that I would actually miss that person a lot when they're gone.  This year I met five of them.  I don't need to name any names, they know who they are.  What are we supposed to do next year with out you guys?  Who am I supposed to walk to class with?  Who to I talk to during lunch?  Who do I hang out with during band trips(yeah, I'm a band geek)?  It's just not going to be the same with out you guys.  I think that I'm pretty good at controlling my emotions.  Actually, it's pretty easy because I have the emotional level of a rock.  Most people have never seen me in a state of being besides happy, bored, and tired.  That's because I keep them bottled up inside me, like every other loser out there.  Since only people that actually know me will even consider reading this, you, the reader, know that I don't have a whole lot of friends.  I'm a loser, like I've said every day for the past couple years.  I'm not afraid to admit it.  In fact, I dont care.  I may not have many friends, but I have true friends.  I just want to thank those five people for making my junior year a fun, interesting, and memorable one.  Even with my terrible memory, I'll remember this year, it's doubtful that next year will even come close to the fun of this year.  Also, congratulations, be sure to come visit.  You know where to find us.  - Some loser   "He who has many friends, has no friends." - Aesop

       "I want someone/something, but I don't want to work for it."  This seems to be what everyone is saying these days.  First of all, you can't have everything you want.  Second, no one's going to give it to you.  Everyone's always saying: "I wish this person would notice me," or ,"I wish I could get this."  And their good friends respond with something like this: "Ohh, don't worry someday he/she will notice you and appreciate you," or "It'll come to you one day."  Well, guess what?  They couldn't be more freaking wrong.  You want something?  Go out and get it.  If you can't make yourself go out and get it, you obviously don't want it as much as you say you do.  In fact, if you don't go out and get it yourself, you don't even deserve to have it.  Nothing's free in this world we live in.  If you haven't already noticed, I'm don't really like people who talk like that.  You might call me a hypocrite, because you hear me complaining all the time.  Well, guess what?  I'm always sarcastic!  Everything I've ever done I had to work hard at.  I wasn't born with natural talent or a some god given skill.  Probably the exact opposite.  Sorry if I sound pissed, but I hate it when people only complain and try to get other people to do crap for them.  - Some pissed off loser

       I currently have the severest case of writers block ever.  I need some ideas or I won't be able to post again until something intersting happens in my life... which is very unlikely.  Unlikely enough that I may have to retire this Blogspot just as I retired my Xanga.  After retiring this Blogspot, I might get some more good ideas and start up a Live Journal or something.  Then when I run out of ideas again I'll retire that Live Journal and so on.  You get the pattern.  So, what I'm trying to say is:  Give me some ideas and save me the trouble of retiring an online journal just to start another... or something like that... Ok, leave a comment then go away.   Later, after publishing this post : Blogspot seems to hate me.  Besides making new post infinatelyharder to write, it has also decided that all of my previoius post should be entirely in bold.  Damn piece of junk.  Anyway, I'm too lazy to fix it right now so live with it.   Later, after publishing this post a second time :  I seems that Blogspot has fixed the problem by itsel... I mean being the genius that I am, I fixed the bold problem... with ease.  As you can see, Blogspot is no match for my genius. =P  - Some loser

       Wow... Blogspot has completely changed the entire updating system thingie.  Usually when something is changed, it's changed to something better.  In Blogspot's case they seem to have changed to something much more... sucky.  There are a few advantages to the new system, but the pitfalls greatly out-weigh the advantages.  Let me give you some examples: When you push the button for "new post" it takes you to the screen where you format posts.  New post and format post are not the same damn it!  You can't even type anything when your formating the post.  When you push the buttons to make font bold or italic it doesn't even make the font bold or italic.  It just deletes your entire post!  And, there's no way to recover it.  Stupid Blogspot, why do I even bother with this?  Even though there are pitfalls and disadvantages there are still some advantages.  For example, theres a new button that allows you to put in block quotes.  The good side is that it's pretty nifty.  The bad side, it's almost impossible to figure out how it works and when you push the button it deletes your entire post.  Hmm... Ok, that's not much of an advantage but it's an improvement... kind of...  Any way, I want to try the block qoute thingie so... here goes:  What we've learned from this horrible tragedy is that the male model's life is a precious, precious commodity.  Just because we have chiseled abs and stunning good looks, does not mean we, too, cannot die in freak gasoline fight accidents. -Ben Stiller,  Zoolander    Wow it actually works.  Don't ask about the quote selection, it was all Kolina's idea.  It has nothing to do with anything that can be related to anything.  Any way, I can't think of anything else so I'm just going to stop now.  - Some loser   "Live as if you were to die tomorrow." -Mahatma Gandhi

       I know many people are eager for the results of my morning driving test, so here is a highly descriptive version of the highy anticipated results.  It started out pretty normal, he tester checked the car and tested me on my hand signals.  The car was fine.  I got lucky when guessing the hand signals.  After waiting for the horrendously slow driver in front of me to start his car and get the hell out of my way, I started my car and got the hell out of the person-behind-me's way.  I did ok getting out of the parking lot, didn't hit anything or anybody too hard.  I made a perfect left turn out of the parking lot, only because there was nothing on the street to hit.  Continued straight until a stop sign.  Stopped perfectly.  Made a bunch more perfect turns.  Stayed in my lane.  Did everything I was supposed to do.  So it's pretty obvious what the results are right?  Yup, I failed horrendously.  So your probably wondering, "I you drove so perfectly how in Zues' butthole did you fail?"  It's pretty simple actually, I just suck that much at driving.  I pulled up to this stop sign.  Looked left.  Looked right.  Nothing.  Inched forward.  Looked left.  Looked right.  Nothiing.  Started to turn.  Looked left.  Minivan going 90 right next to me.  Luckly in the impending crash not many people died.  Just the tester, the nun driving the minivan, and the 7 orphans she was driving.  Not bad for my first driving test huh?  Only 9 people dead.  It's ok that failed.  I'll just try harder next time.  Maybe I'll kill less people, who knows?  If you actually believed me when I said I killed 9 people, I feel very sorry for you.  You should just commit suicide now and spare yourself the torment you will receive in the future.  Just kidding.  Actually the exact same thing happened, except there was no crach.  I speed front of the minivan into the left lane saving myself and the tester.  Being an ungrateful bastard, he stilled failed me.  Damned bastard.  I should have just crashed into the damned van.  Anyway, after waking up after passing out from shock, he asked me why I cut in front of the van.  To save your ungrateful ass, you bastard.  Actually that was what I was thinking, but I just said, "I dunno..."  Genius aren't I?  Anyway, I drove back to the DMV, not killing anyone else on the way, and did a pretty nice parking job.  Then he turned his head and looked at me and said, "Ungratefully... good driver...bye."  That exactly what I heard.  I think what he actually said was this, "Ungratefully I can't kill you for almost killing me so I'll just fail you.  You will never be a good driver and should never be allowed in a car.  I hope you burn in hell.  Bye."  I'm almost 100% convinced that's what he said.  I probably wont remember for sure because of my bad memory.  Oh well, I guess we'll never know what he actually said.  Anyway, that was my first driving test.  I'm looking forward to my next driving test!  Wish me luck and pray for the other drivers around me.  - Some loser

       Tomorrow, July 8th, a date which will live in infamy...well, for me.  Anyway, just ignore the peral harbor speech rip-off.  I have my driving test tomorrow at 10 in the morning.  There's only a few things wrong wiht that.  First of all, it's a  test .  Second of all, it's a  driving  test.  Lastly but not least, it's in the morning.  You all know how I take tests right?  I know for a fact the people who I know that took calculus probably do.  I wing them like a mo-fo.  The results: 99% chance of failure, 1% chance of  maybe  not failing.  Ok, forget that it's a test.  It has to do with driving!  Everyone knows I'm obsessed with racing games... but that's just games.  I can't actually do what I do in games in real life.  My driving skills are terrible in real life.  I seriously mean terrible.  If any one has ever sat in the car while I was driving, they'd be scared for life.  They'd be so messed up mentally, they'd freak out just be seeing a car.  The last thing, it's in the morning!  I am possibly the worst morning person ever.  Ok, imagine the American Idol judge Simon.  Now imagine Simon on crack, ecstasy, marijauna, and every other drug possible at the same time.  I'm not done yet, now, imagine the drugged up him drunk like a monkey and trying to kill everyone around him.  I'm that him, but to the millionth power.  Getting up in the morning for me is like diggin my self out of a grave(kind of like Uma Thurman in Kill Bill 2, except Pai Mai never taught me the one inch punch).  Anyway, if I happen to miraculously pass the driving test in the morning, then maybe it might be possible for me to pick up girls after all!  It's commen knowledge that guys with cars have a higher chance of actually hooking up with girls.  Having a car shows the girls that you are somewhat independant, even though your car was bought with your parents money and the insurance was paid for with your parents money.  Anyway, here are the chances that I figured: Guy with out car: 5%- 40% Guy with car: 41%-75% Guy with nice car:75%-100%  With those percentages in mind, I figured my percentages.  Here they are: Me with out car: -100% Me with car: .5%  As you can see, once I get a car my percentage with be non-negative and any percentage thats not negative or zero has a chance of happening.  There might be a chance for me after all!  If I happen to pass the test tomorrow, I'll be on the road to to ending loneliness once and for all!  Ohh wait, after my license I still need to get a car, and after the car I still need to get insurance.  Let's see, I predict if I get my license tomorrow, I'll get a car the end of senior year.  That means I'll get insurance a couple months after that.  Which means I'll be able to drive freely in December of 2005!  YEEEEESSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!  Now, pray for me to pass the test tomorrow and if you read this after the test or didn't pray for me, then I hope you burn in hell.  Just kidding, but pray for me ok?  Ohh yeah, almost forgot.  I realize my recent updates are lacking horendously in humorous and interesting material.  This can be easily seen, my previous post received  0  comments.  Forgive me, it's hard for a loser like me to fill in for a genius like Wesley, I'm trying my best...  - Some loser

       Apparently my new resloutions have been working out really well, but god damn, I'm bored.  Maybe it's working out too good...  Actually, it depends on how you look at it.  If you look at it as keeping my end, it's been working out great.  If you look at it as seeing how many people actually want to talk to me, not that great.  I can easily count the number of people that actually IMed me  and  how many times they did on one hand.  Actually, it's not that surprising.  Remember my earlier post?  Where I write about the number of friends I have?  Yeah, taking that number and this new number, it's actually understandable.  Anyway, now that the fourth of July/July 4th is over, everybody seems to be posting about their adventures on that day.  So, I decided I should be a follower again and do that also.  Here's my post about my adventures on July 4th:  On July 4th, I did... absolutly nothing.  I probably sat online waiting for people to IM me for over 10 hours.  Okay, well maybe not 10 hours that's exagerating, only 9 hours and 59 minutes.  I didn't want to be that much of a loser waiting online for 10 hours.  Besides that, I guess I just slept or watched tv.  Basically, I did on July 4th exactly what I do everyday.  Intersting, huh?  Since my last post was horrendously short, I am trying to make this post horrendously long.  Well, not  horrendously  long but longer than the last one.  Hmm, now that I look at it, this post is already longer than the last one... I guess I'll just end it here than.  Hope you enjoyed your forth of July as much as I enjoyed mine... maybe more.  Actually, before I go I want to congratulate two of my stalker friends for  finally  getting with their stalk-ees.  - Some loser   "Once a loser, always a loser." -Who knows?

       After using AIM for several years, I have come to realize several things.  First of which is that AIM is very useful when you have something, important or not, to tell someone.  The second is that it is not a very smart way of relieving boredom.  The third and final thing I realized is that having the same person IM you the instant you sign on can get irritating and annoying.  Keeping these three points in mind, especially the third one, I have come up with a few resolutions: 1.) Try to use AIM less(Try to sit and stare at the screen while AIM is on less.) 2.) Not to talk to anyone,  anyone , online unless they talk to me first, I have something really important to tell them, or I succumb to my boredom and  accidently  IM someone.  I don't know if I will actually be able to stick to these resolutions, but I'm going to try.  If I stick to them and not succumb, good for me.  If I succumb... well, who cares?  If I sucuumb I'll just act like I never wrote this in the first place.  Wish me luck... or not.  - Some loser   This is probably my shortest update yet, I'm so ashamed of my self... =P

       Every time I load up my site to update, change settings, or whatever I do on my site, I always check to see if the number of comments on most recent posts has gone up.  Sadly, 99.9% of the time, the number is the same as the last time I checked.  On the .1% chance occasion that the number did change, I always read it before doing anything else.  Usually, that comment ends up being just random gibberish that even the author of it can not understand, kind of like my posts.  Even though it's just gibberish, it still adds to my infinitesimally minute collection of comments.  I always wonder how come I never get that many comments?  After seconds of strenuous thinking, I came up with two possible possibilities.  First, I don't get lots of comments because no one knows me.  What leads to people not knowing me?  That's when I came up with my second possibility, with the help of Kolina... I think, I can't remember.  Now, before you hear the second, you first have to visit  urlLink this site  because the second compares it to mine.  Now that you've visited her site, the second is that I am not her.  Maybe if I was more like her I might get more comments.  By like her, I mean look like her.  I seriously doubt she would get that many comments if she were a hairy, butt-ugly guy.  Or maybe its her attitude that attracts so many people.  By her attitude I mean her body.  Again, I seriously doubt she would get as many comments if she were not only a hairy, butt-ugly guy but horrendously fat also.  Tell me I'm wrong.  That's right, you can't because you know I'm right.  So now that we've gone over the two possibilities, I've also come up with ways to fix the problem.  First, everytime you visit this site imagine the sexiest, hottest, cutest chick you've every imagined and imagine that she was the author of the site and has hot pictures of herself all over the site.  If you're a girl, imagine the hunkiest, jockiest, most muscular guy you've ever imagined and imagine that he was the author of this site and has topless pictures of himself all over the site showing off his nice muscles.  Second, tell, all your friends about this site.  When you tell them about this site, tell them the sexiest, hottest, cutest chick they could ever imagine is the author of the site and has hot pictures up everywhere.  If their girls just tell them the author is the muscular guy described above.  If your friends happen to be gay instead of sending them to this site, instead send them to  urlLink this one . =P  Now, leave several comments and then leave.  - Some loser

       Before I start, if you have no interest in wushu what so ever just skip this post entirely.  You probably won't even understand even if you were obsessed with wushu.  A couple days ago I started thinking about how to best describe wushu flavor.  Well, when I think about wushu flavor, I think about two things: rhythm and flow.  Two entirely separate things, almost.  I don't claim to be an expert in either of these, probably barely an amateur at both, but I'm writing this post to help me clearly analyze each of these aspects.  First, when you think of rhythm what is the first thing you think of?  Probably music, huh?  That's what I think about anyway.  Rhythm in music is ver similar to rhythm in wushu, I think.  You have to know when to go fast when to go slow.  You have to know where to add that extra boost of speed for effect and when to dramatically slow to build up suspense.  Recently, after doing some deep thinking about flavor, I've tried to think of a song while doing wushu.  I think of the fast part of the song and I'm doing a fast part of my form and try to move according to the songs rhythem.  When I need to go slow, I think of a slow part.  I admit that my rhythm is pretty terrible, but I think this method helps me to apply rhythm to my wushu.  Second, flow.  I don't know about you but when I think of flow the first thing I think about is waves.  If you've ever watched the waves come in you probably know what I'm talking about.  The waves combine perfectly power, with speed, with the ultimate non-stop flow.  Everything moves as one. Nothing stops moving, it's just constant flowing motion.  I'm not sure how to explain it, but I kind of try to copy the waves.  Sounds stupid, but that's just me.  I try to copy the constant flowing motion, the movement as one, trying to create that same ultimate non-stop flow of the waves.  I'm not sure if this helps anyone, but if it does, that's just a bonus because I, myself, have learned a lot from posting this.  Well, all my secrets are out.  Know it's time to start practicing what I preach.  You're probably wondering why I make such a big deal of something as small as flavor.  The reason I make such a big deal is that I can't make my form super powerful or fast so I need to have something to distinguish it, something to make a noticable difference from my form and other peoples' forms.  - Some loser
