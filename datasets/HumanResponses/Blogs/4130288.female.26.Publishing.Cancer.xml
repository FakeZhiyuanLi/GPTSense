       A good portion of my journalism portfolio is telling the stories of how people died.   I've written articles about babies drowning, pilots crashing; kids maimed and killed by powertools and execution-style gang killings. I've been to crime scenes and seen the bodies draped in sheets. Today, in fact, I reviewed a case where a woman used a ball-peen to crack another woman's skull. I've sat in court and stared at defendants as cops on the witness described little girls being molested and murders being plotted. Worst of all, I've called and knocked on the doors of dozens of families after a loved one has died.  I hate to admit this, but when I'm chasing down these stories--mind racing, blood pumping, I'm giddy and excited. During the writing process, I sit in front or my computer trying to come up with the most painfully precise verbs for what happened. Hit--no slammed into a tree. Touched--no fondled her. Hit--no pummeled. There's no thrill in the actual details of the crime or the atrocity. Rather, it's the gathering and retelling of the facts--the detective work--and the kudos that comes with a job well done.  But this weekend, I read something--a piece of fiction--about a crime that really spooked me. I just finished the novel--it's very bestseller Oprah book club--The Lovely Bones. I had avoided it on the new releases rack for more than year. The other day, I finally picked it up to read the first sentence. Usually that's enough to dismiss the book as frivolous. But the first sentences were riveting.  "My name was Salmon, like the fish; first name, Susie. I was fourteen when I was murdered on Dec. 6, 1973. In newspaper photos of missing girls from the seventies, most looked like me: white girls with mousy brown hair."  After finishing the book, I'd give it a 6 out of 10 for its writing and subject. But the whole premise of a crime and the voice of the victim really made me think about my own writing about real-life crimes. I don't know if there's any neat summary or lesson to be drawn. I don't know if can suddenly connect with the victims better because that book freaked me out, but it made me reflect on my own numb approach to real-life tragedies.   Can every story I right have a worthwhile purpose that will help give that victim's and family's loss some kind of broader meaning? Can I be fair, and at the same time, compassionate? Can what I do in the interest of corporate profits serve a greater good?

      Before I leave the house for work each morning, I choose to look my best. I'm a girly girl, so I go all out with the long hair, the lipstick, the heels, usually something pink and usually a skirt.  Hey, I'm single and you never know when you're going to meet Mr. Right. Plus, I feel better when I look better. Apparently, some folks think I've taken the whole concept of business-casual-sexy a bit too far.  I got into an argument the other day with the guy I'm dating. As I've mentioned before, we're both journalists. And from 2000-2004, we wrote for the same publication. (I recently switched jobs. He's still at the old one.) He went out with the co-workers (my old officemates) and apparently a few "old friends" made some snide remarks about my manner of dress. I think the comments cut along the lines of--too short, too low-cut.  The boy toy comes home from happy hour, calls me and blabs the comments. He then proceeds to softly chastise me: "You know you're cute and smart, you don't have to do that to get noticed. It's unnecessary and it undermines you."  I am floored by his comments. You'd think I was coming to work in a halter top, miniskirt and thigh-high boots. I've steamed over his comments for a few days now, and I've pieced together a few theories.  Janet Reno or Pam Anderson:  I don't understand why, in American society, a woman can be either attractive or smart. It seems like there's no tolerance for a woman who has both. You can either be smart and look like Janet Reno, of you can be pretty and have the reasoning ability of a third-grader. If a woman in the work world is both sexy and smart, she has to be torn down and put in her place. She has to be debased as too provocative or a bit too slutty.  It's a man's world:  My second theory has to do with how women have been incorporated into the work world. Essentially, male-dominated Corporate America wants to program us to be little men--but they'll still judge us as women--based on our bodies and looks. That's a losing proposition out of the gates. An androgynous all-business woman in the office is an "ice queen" or a "bitch." A social, feminine woman isn't taken seriously or is viewed as the office trollop.  So in the end, I'm going to dress how I want to dress. That means heels, skirts that brush the knee and red lips. Every office needs its trollop.

      I've never screwed a source that I've interviewed for a story. But I've wanted to.  You know the tall, dark and helpful types who like to call your cell phone in the evening hours to whisper tips--usually inconsequential ones that don't really help. It's the gesture, the innuendo of an unnecessary evening call that makes it so thrilling and a little bit naughty. I had one "good" married source who liked to call me at home and carry on irreverent e-mail exchanges during the workday. We lunched several times and talked all the time. Nothing came of it. (My younger sister says I'm bad at closing the deal.)  I have shagged a few fellow reporters in my time though. Most reporters live and die their work, which means we spend a lot of time at the office. Men who go into reporting are rarely the highest quality physical specimens. But quite a few are smart and wickedly funny. They're all supremely arrogant and overconfident in the intellect--which I must find some kind of turn-on because I always end up with this kind of jerk.  If bringing work home is considered bad form, bringing work to bed usually is an even bigger no-no. There's nothing that's worse than workplace competition and banter in the form of pillowtalk. Actually, my current love interest is a journalist and we spend too much time talking news and how we approach our jobs.  He does have a few redeeming qualities though. He's tall, unmarried with amazing shoulders, and he's bent me over piece of furniture and kitchen appliance in my apartment, so I'll keep my reporter boytoy for now.  I'm a girl reporter. I've been in the business for about six years. I'm single, in my 20s and a Twin Cities transplant. After some minimal consideration, I've decided to chronicle my exploits as a budding journalist and a single woman to the web.  My first priority is to keep it interesting. (I knew you'd like my sexy start.) I'm not actually sure where I'm going with this. Maybe I'm just trying to figure out for myself where my career ends and where I begin.  I'm very lucky because I've always known what I wanted to be. I interviewed someone recently who said he made his career decision at age 9. I was the same way. I always wanted to be a writer. As early as I could read, I was fascinated with newspapers. I remember first reading advice columns--Dear Abby and Ann Landers-- in second and third grade and then the features section and slowly working my way to the front page.  I went to college for journalism, picking a university that specialized in that major. Ever since graduating, reporting is what I've done. At this point, it's a big part of my identity. I spend most of my time and devote most of my energy to the craft. I've never regretted my decision to be a reporter even though itâ€™s time-consuming and stressful. Now though, in my mid-20s, it might be time to figure out what else I'm about--after the 9-to-5 grind.  So, welcome to my web log. Let the therapy begin.
