      today was a cool day.  i went out with my mom and her sisters for a late bday celebration.  we went to lucilles somkehouse bbq...the food wasnt that good, but it was cool.  then melissa, jennifer, and i went to jasmines bday celebration and met a bunch of her family.  they are really nice and cool.  everytime melissa and i go out we get asked if we are sisters.  its really crazy considering we just met almost a year ago.  its real cool having a cousin my age that i can kick it with thats not stuck up.  nette is cool to kick it with too, but shes at a different stage in her life and shes not really sure what she wants to do with it right now.     so i can feel the confindence that i gained this year diminishing at a fast rate.  i dont know why that happens cuz im the same person, look the same, have the same amount of pouches(lol).  but i guess maybe its cuz neither one of us has expressed our feelings for one another yet.  im scared of his response and im not even sure if it would be better for me to know or not to know.  i guess its cool how we are for right now, but i know eventually im going to have to remove myself from him again just for the simple fact that my feelings for him are and always have been greater for him than his for me...at least thats what i get from his actions.  that may not all be true though, maybe i just express my feelings in different way than he does.  i guess ill just see what happens, but that will probably be nothing considering im always the one that asks what the situation is between us.  but like i just said it might be best that i dont know.

      so i guess we are "cool" now.  we talked and whatever.  you still ask for shit all the damn time, but its not like i didnt know that.  i just really wish you would grow up...  and what was this plan about?  maybe there was no plan and maybe "he" was lying about you and your friend, but i still cant figure out a reason for "him" to lie to me.  i really want him to be, cuz thats just fucking disgusting.    but yeah..none of this talking to me about you lick this and that, but you're "scared" of me.  i gave you 4 too many chances and you couldnt get it together on the last one that you supposedly asked for.  im tired of the games and im not playing them with you anymore.  lol...game over.    so i still need money and my boss is still nuts.  shes a good person, but shes not all there.    im taking mr white out for his bday tomorrow and i cant deny that i still have feelings for him.  i just hope i can stay strong and not give in.    yeah i need to lose like 5 pounds.  ive lost 10 since last year, but i still have this horrible stomach, although its not as bad now thats its a little smaller.  im still sexy though.  its crazy that when im not talking to anyone i have a lot of confidence in myself, but as soon as im ina relationship and theres a possibility that he might not want me anymore, its all fucked up, thinking im ugly and all that shit.  thats just out of control...i really need to get it together.  its not about guys, its about me.  this explains it all right here  "Love, your happiness don't begin wit a man Strong woman, why should you depend on a man I understand you want a man that's resourceful If he pay your bills, he feel like he bought you Talkin to a friend, about what love is Her man didn't love her, cuz he didn't love his Hugged her from afar, said what I felt You never find a man, till you find yourself Time helps mistakes, you can learn from Cuz one man fucked up men you shouldn't turn from You want a certain type of guy, gotta reach a certain point too At that destination, a king will annoint you Goin through the storm, many bodies stay warm That relationship died, for you to be born, you worth more Than anything you could cop in a store For you to grow he had to go so what you stoppin him for Not even I could ignore bein alone it's hard Find heaven in yourself and God" - Common

      its really sad when you your whole life revolves around parties, hoes, and your cell phone ringtones...especially when you are a father.  obviously, you arent mature enough to take care of yourself, let alone a child.  your selfishness is out of control.  all you care about is what you can get out of people and you think that you never have to return the favor.  all you do is lie to everyone, including your best friends.  you cant admit when you are wrong. i cant believe that anyone could ever want you as a boyfriend.  you really should take what you can get cuz those girls do way too much for you for you to treat them that way.  all i can say is that one day you will get what you deserve.  oh yeah, and just because the girl says its ok, doesnt mean you share.  thats fucking digusting, do you have any kind of respect for women or yourselves?  you have daughters...  being a women is sad these days cuz guys especially in l.a. think they are pimps and try to get as many women as they can.  i cant imagine how its going to be when your daughters grow up.

      ok so this may be a little too much information for you guys to want to know, so ill try and keep it NC-17..lol...j/k.  anyways, so my legs are really sore again, but im having no cramps at all.  this is great and i recommend "female comfort" -some herbal shit for anyone that has really bad cramps.  apparently bloating is directly related to cramps cuz im not extra fat (from bloating at least) and im not having cramps.  so these herbal pills apparently balance out your hormones, so that you wont have cramps anymore or something like that. and heres where its gets a little graphic, i advise you to skip down to the next full paragraph or block, cuz these arent really paragraphs, but its for my own interest....  i guess i was having really bad cramps cuz i wasnt shedding it all.   so now im feeling 90% better than i usually do and im not overdosing on midol.  the only thing that really discombobulates me is why my legs get so sore.  thats really weird, but my body is weird.  just enough discomfort for me to want to stay home, but not enough to make me cry and writhe in angony...lol @ writhe.  so i think im done for now. bbl

      so my birthday celebration ended up to be really nice.  everyone had fun and all the important people at least called me, came to celebrate, or took me out for my birthday.  i guess we are all going again this saturday, so it seems as though they had just as much fun as i did. unfortunately, my wish didnt come true, but i guess its not time for all that.  my whole weekend was actually good.  i got a massage on saturday that was great and my evening plans went well also.  sunday, stevie had a dance recital and it was soooo cute.  that night rohya and i went to jamaican gold and although i didnt stay, it was cool.  afterwards was great.    im glad that i have true friends and that i can count on them to be there for me just as much as i am for them.

      so melissa and i went and saw miss Yaisa and her family out in ATL.  we got back 2 days ago and It's sooo nice out there in convington county. there are soo many wooded areas and everything just looks so different from california.  I need to get me a vacation house out there when i get older with a half mile driveway like this one family's.  people stare a lot out there thought, but i guess its just cuz they can tell that we werent from out there.  they are on that whole "cali girl" trip out there, but whatever.  there are ghosts out there too...   i feel like shit right now though.  i left work this morning feeling like someone was stabbing me in my uterus, but then i went back to help out cuz one guy took today off.  the herbal stuff was working really well for a minute, but i dont know what happened...i guess my body got used to it.  thats all bad though cuz i thought i was cured naturally with natural supplements, but i was sadly mistaken.  maybe i shouldnt take them so often and that might work, btu i need to do something
