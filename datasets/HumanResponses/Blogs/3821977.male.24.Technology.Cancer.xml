      Went to waco and came back with a feret and cage. W00h00 . I got my Roxy Carmichael Super feret back. The last one bit the dust by the actions of myself unfortunately. This one will be treated much better i believe. I dont anticipate anymore feret stepping to occur.   Moved to new location in S. Austin. It took 3 minutes to drive to work today. I do believe this is the closest i've ever been to a job.   more later rob

      It has finally occured. The day that i dreaded has finally come around. I am now 24 years old. It just goes downhill from here. On a positive note I can finally apply for financial aid w/o the gov't using my parent's income as a justification for not giving me any money. Stupid Gov't. You'd expect after 18 they would no longer base your life off of your parents. I'm coming to Waco today for a nice 4-day weekend. I took off Today and Friday using vacation time to celebrate this unforgettable time in my life.     Mom, Vanessa, and DJ are coming back from DC today. They spent a week siteseeing the east coast and i'm sure have many tales of their adventures to describe in amazing detail since the Kodak 5megapixel cam is now functional. It seems that Best Buy finally did something right for once. The fixed a camera that was able to take over 500 digital images upon return. Seeing as I was once a BB tech, I know what a rarity this is. It was not uncommon on a daily basis to see a customer's camera, computer, or television come back delayed and still not working.   later

      haha Vanessa Flamed the hell out of her post with Lots of Avertising for Go-Quiz.com. We here at gr0mit.blogspot.com do not rely on advertising tactics to allure potential blog hits. That's the level of quality you can expect from gr0mit.blogspot.com   Rob

      Things I want for my Birthday #1. New Computer better than alex's  #2. New Celly - better than alex's  I just want to say that i've been extremely busy for the last couple of days so in all defense i can justify why I wasnt able to h00k it up with mad blogg'in action. My birthday is on th 22nd' and I'm really wanting a new computer since Doom 3 comes out on August 4th. My Hl2 should be here around that time and the xp1700 just cant push the Fps anymore like it could 2.5 years ago. Plus alex is riding high on a 2.6ghz so I'm definitely doing something wrong.. I recall upgrading my computer every 6 months but now . 2.5 years that's a world record that i hope to never encounter again. Shame Shame on me for not supporting the computer hardware industry. The Celly Situation is this. I was going to get 2 new cingular samsung x427 flip picture phones but Cingular screwed me over and never fully processed my order. I decided to forgo the reprocessing of the order and just wait and buy a nice Cam Phone. Can anyone say Samsung E715 - the most pimped out cell phone ever. Take a look at the screen and the high frame rate of the camera(1.5megapixel) and you will never look at your crummy cell phone again unless your Alex whom owns a pimpy little v400 *screw you alex, your days are limited*.   Btw : Good Email Client is Mozilla Thunderbird - F'in Sweet  more later rob

      Let me start of by saying that all Vanessa said in her post is true but in my defense it was not all my fault in how I've come to be. It was actually Vanessa's. Tell you the truth I was a kind soul with promise in my heart until Vanessa came along and slowly turned myself into an emtpy shell of a man. But I like to look at life in a more positive manner. You get lemons and you make... One would say Lemonade but really?? Do you know how many lemons it takes to make lemonade. Take the easy way out and use a 10Cent packet of Koolaid lemondade powder mix and lots of sugar and overcharge that stuff. Add some sliced lemons in there to give off the false appearance that you really worked hard and the $1.00 cup is justified b/c it's really that good. To further increase your profits, dilute the hell out of the lemonade. This sheisty idea has been brought to you by Martha Stewart Living and the fine staff at the Style Channel.  love you Vanessa, my favorite little sister --> now go make me some lemonade!

      Got 3 and a half hours of sleep last nite b/c i was too enthralled in the television. Watched every episode of Court Tv's Forensic shows and then finished off the Airline reality show. I woke up and realized that 3.5 is not enough to sustain myself for a grueling 8 hour (haha) work day. Had Chinese Low mein for lunch today courtesy of the little chinese restauraunt down the corner. Unfortanetly for the driver i did not tip well.

      Charlene woke up this morning saying that something in bed bit her. She did indeed have a litle bite on her but from what i'm not sure of. She was soo cute about it. We searched the bed as i was getting ready for work but to no avail no bug insite. Charlene forced roxy this morning to sleep in the bedroom this morning b/c of her interest in sleeping on the futon.  I drove to work today going a little too fast this morning  and almost clipped a car. It had to have been a millimeter apart from the next car. wheeww that was a close one. I called Charlene back once i got to work and asked her if she was trying to sleep. She said she was with the tv turned off thankfully. She's going to call David back for an interview with Spherion.

      well i'm at work and it's 7:07CST. We just got our new Cisco Ip phones installed. They're very nice. With the ability to access your phone from a website and making customizations remotely,  who wouldn't want a phone like this. I currently have over 20 different wav tones to signal when a call is coming in. very cool. Anyway very nice today as it's friday. I'm going to see my parents this weekend and spend 4th of july with them. Dad is going to take me to the lake to fly rc planes. should be a nice weeekend

      I'm here at 6am working 8 hours of overtime. If anyone feels like calling me to talk about anything, then i'm here otherwise i'll be watching South Park & Family Guy episodes. Btw I forgot to bring my Great Train Robbery - the one w/o mustard stains all over it.  Hope Alex has a good trip and to watch out for that big ol' nasty hurricaine killing people in FL.

      So I had the new Angus Beef hamburger from BK. It's more filling than the regular hamburgers out today but I cant help feel that it's not real beef. It had the texture of prefab hamburgers. I think i still prefer the original whataburger hamburger. Today is Fridy the 13th and AVP comes out... Oh yeah

      I'm on the communications level of Doom 3 Which is going quite nicely. In one week i'll have  urlLink Half-Life 2  and on October  urlLink Tribes Vengeance  will be at my doorsteps thanks in part to Dad buying it from Amazon with a $50 gift certificate he received from doing surveys that took no time at all online.  ok - nite

      So i finished Andromeda Strain which was not that good. The book up until the end was great but the end was exactly like Prey. He rushed the ending and just finished it with 3 pages of end writing. I'm not sure whether to read Terminal Man or Great Train Robbery. In regards to Alex's comment on my prior post. The mustard was purely an accident. haha Alex you can have this book after i'm done reading it. It doesnt have the same snazzy book cover as the original stained paperback but It should do just fine.  Charlene got a job at Conns as a cashier. She's working 40 hours a week. Very good news as we will have quite abit of money now extra. She also receives a super discount there. I am working overtime on Sunday and on Friday i'm going to fix some guy's computer @ 60 an hour. This should be a very nice month indeed.   peace rob

      What an amazing book. I once started reading it back in 97' but i never went past 10 pages. It wasn't that i did not like the initial first few pages but just another item in my life that i forgot about at the time. I bought an old hardbound from a goodwill store that included Terminal man and Great Train Robbery as well in it. The font type is very old and nothing like his newer books such as Prey which imho was complete and utter trash. Great Train Robbery for some reason reminds me of mustard stains! eh Alex?  What comes to mind when you hear the book " great train robbery " to you? haha . In any case the book is exactly like it should be with a chrichton novel. It's very detailed in military and medical terms. I'm on page 200 right now so I should be done by tomorrow.   rob

      I finally got back from my 9 day vacation. For people in the working world where 40 hours is the weekly ritual. 9 days is an eternity. I began my vacation receiving my new computer parts from the internet and upgraded my computer in anticipation for Doom3 which i promptly picked up 2nd day from Frys for 13 dollars. I slept all week long as to make sure i was fully rested for each day of doom3 that promptly ensued.   Mind you Doom3 never came before 12 as this would be an insult to a vacation such as this. The game is quite simply amazing. I've never had an experience like this unless you count in 96' when a copy of the leaked quake fell into my lap. I have been terrified all week long walking ever so slow with my flashlight gripped tight. I hear a noise and turn but it's nothing..just the cooling down of the sewer pipes that clutter the cramped confines of the shithole i'm in. I turn back around to continue on my path when a godamed monster jumps out and scares the shit out of me. It's a very tense feeling playing this game. I feel like my life has taken on a fresh load of stress ever since D3 fell in my lap. I'm 10 levels in on the game and have since picked up the plasma and chaingun. I saw the bfg9000 in action from some other npc's that were in a cutscene and it looks breathtaking. I upgraded to some beta 4.9 catalyst drivers and Winxp Sp2 last nite. I'm doing everything in my power to increase the fps to the point where 1024 is a reality.   I also attended Charlene's sisters marriage. I was the cameraman and did everything in my power to make the cinematography on par with a high budget action film. Lots of camera zooms in at Charlene. I caught the garter belt and Charlene caught the bouquet. ok more later. This post was dedicated to Alex as he seems to push me more on the blog wars scene than anyone realizes.
