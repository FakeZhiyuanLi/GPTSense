      The other night Radio National had Philip Adams interviewing  urlLink Daniel Ellsberg  about his book  urlLink Secrets: A Memoir of Vietnam and the Pentagon Papers.   Ellsberg made some interesting comparisons between the war in Vietnam and the present conflict in Iraq. Phillip Adams seems to be the number one enemy of the many of Right Wing Australian Blogs on the net.  Most of their readers seem to be Septic Tanks, pretty depressing really.  However found a couple of decent political Aussie blogs which I will read from now on, one being  urlLink Tug Boat Potemkin  and even better is  urlLink Back Pages  by Christopher Sheil.

      An estimated 35,000 people in Indian state of Uttar Pradesh have been declared dead, by unscrupulous relatives, in order to steal their property.   urlLink Transparency International  via  urlLink The Man in Blue   and more on the living dead   "I'm here. I'm alive," Lal Bihari told revenue officials after discovering he was listed as deceased in 1976. "That may be so," an unruffled clerk replied, "but according to my books you're dead." It took Lal Bihari 18 years to get his life and his land back. During that time, he added the word Mritak, or Dead, to his name and to prove that he was living sought arrest, tried to run for parliament, kidnapped the son of the uncle who had stolen his property, threatened murder, insulted judges, threw leaflets listing his complaints at legislators in the state assembly and demanded a widow's pension for his wife. Each time he was either beaten up by police or rebuked for wasting officials' time. Unable to make headway, Lal Bihari The Dead sought the company of other ghosts in Uttar Pradesh and found an entire underworld of the deceased and dispossessed. Last month a dozen of them demonstrated outside the Uttar Pradesh assembly to publicize their fate, demanding an official investigation into land registry transactions to prevent others from being robbed.  urlLink Time Asia

      Had one of our first hot days this summer, and I haven't acclimatised yet. Fortunately a cool change is coming tonight. Found this strange little  urlLink archive   of machine translated text when I googled term  Hot Adelaide :   When me this thought came, I was even before the carpet seaweeds, which zierte at that time each backyard and thus also our meadow, because she had the function of a backyard, in which one beat out evenly also the carpets of the dwelling. Laying out commodity was likewise not yet invented. Some parents used the Teppichklopfer also for the corporal punishment of their children. That was very painful, but I knew only from an argument with my older brother, with which we had mutually struck ourselves with the Klopfer.

      Extracts from the Odd spot column of  urlLink The Age .  Tuesday November 18, 2003 A man's year-old corpse hung for nearly a day in Budapest's Arts University after builders and students mistook it for a modern sculpture. The man hanged himself a year ago but was found only after the closed building was reopened for repairs.   Saturday November 15, 2003 Nazi saboteurs plotted to blow up Buckingham Palace using exploding cans of peas, according to MI5 files just made public. Three men captured in Ireland in 1940 were carrying explosives, including tins labelled "French Peas" containing nitrocellulose.  Friday November 28, 2003 One-third of all American visitors to Scotland believe haggis is a real animal, according to a survey. Almost one in four (23 per cent) of those questioned said they had come to Scotland believing they could hunt and catch Scotland's most famous dish.  which reminds me of something I read recently on  urlLink Scottish Food . via  urlLink Senior Citizen .

       We do not know where this journey will end. Yet we know this: Human beings are headed into the cosmos.  PRESIDENT George W Bush People tell me the cosmos is near where the Grecians are. The details of George's  urlLink vision  look a little dubious:   The proposed funding for the new exploration initiative will total $12 billion over the next five years, with much of it coming from reallocation of $11 billion within NASA's current five-year budget. The president called on Congress to increase the agency's budget by roughly $1 billion spread over the next five years.    If you look at the PDF of the proposed NASA budget (on the same page ) it is hard to determine where the money is coming from to build new spacecraft.

            You're  The Guns of August !   by Barbara Tuchman     Though you're interested in war, what you really want to know is what causes war. You're out to expose imperialism, militarism, and nationalism for what they really are. Nevertheless, you're always living in the past and have a hard time dealing with what's going on today. You're also far more focused on Europe than anywhere else in the world. A fitting motto for you might be &quot;Guns do kill, but so can diplomats.&quot;      Take the  urlLink Book Quiz  at the  urlLink Blue Pyramid .    Can't say that I've read the book but I can recommend  urlLink A Distant Mirror: The Calamitous Fourteenth Century  by the same Author.

      As the election draws near the weighty political issues of our time come to the fore. Hence this discusion about  urlLink flagpoles  at  Back Pages  and then the revival of the Fridge magnet  be alert but not alarmed  campaign. My last  urlLink Fridge magnet  was accidently thrown in the bin so I am eagerly awaiting the arrival of its replacement.  For as the Prime Minister has stated   we all have to ensure that this country is as prepared as it can be and as protected as it can be .  While trusting in my fridge magnet to protect me in most circumstances in this age of  hysteria  terror I've decided to do my bit by publishing some useful excerpts from this 1940's Adelaide booklet   Know Your Enemy: and Improvise your own defence   &copy; Department of Home Security, Canberra.  If you need to take shelter and don't want to dig a trench in the backyard;    ... the safest place would be beneath a solid table placed against two walls in a corner of a room. A mattress thrown on the top, as indicated in the accompanying sketch, would increase the protective value of the table, whilst a double thickness of books will also give good protection. If you are caught unawares, why not put a stout table against a wall in the passageway, and block two ends of it with mattresses, or, if you have time, books. It would be much better than nothing.   the booklet also suggests that;   A handy means of boiling the kettle will do much to pass the time away, whilst a gramaphone or portable radio will also do much in that respect.   I suppose you could always read a book, from now on I'm only buying hardcovers for added protection. In the future I will post some useful nutritional advice, such as  The Value of Dripping ,  Do not despise liver   and how to  Preserve a few dozen eggs .

      Time for a bit of nostalgia from the late 70's when a  friend at work told me that the Bard of Salford  urlLink John Cooper Clark , was still performing.

        The Prime Minister, well known impersonator of Max Gilles (pictured above) and fawning admirer of the late Don Brademan, after calling  urlLink Muttiah Muralitharan  a chucker, got a right old bollocking in urlLink  this article  by Christian Ryan. In the first paragraph Ryan manages to use two of Howards obsessions (Ming and cricket) against him;  Sir Robert Menzies, among his many good turns for Australian cricket through the 1950s and 60s, once paid for a young Keith Stackpole to receive legspin coaching from Clarrie Grimmett. John Howard's one and only contribution has been to put paid to any hope of Muttiah Muralitharan touring Australia. Eight of the lamest, laziest, least considered words uttered by any prime minister on any sport – "they proved it in Perth with that thing" – will go down as Howard's cricketing legacy.  Meanwhile Muralitharan has time for his new role as an  urlLink  Ambassador  of the United Nations Food Program.

       urlLink Boynton  had this fascinating link to an image of  urlLink Myrtle Foster batting . A feature of this image was the unusual bat.  The  urlLink Worcestershire Women's Cricket  site has a brief history of woman's cricket and this following image.   It seems Woman's Cricket, along with slaughtering some of the local fauna, was quite popular in some parts of Britain among the leisured classes.  From the middle 18th century there are constant press references to women's matches, most of them played, like their male equivalents, in Sussex, Hampshire and Surrey villages. Records also exist for several matches held in Sussex around this time, these were often between rival villages, or teams of married and single women. The winner's prize for such a match might be a barrel of ale or eleven pairs of lace gloves, such games could lure crowds of 2,000 plus and betting on the result was rife.

         Caught somewhere between trying to impersonate Winston Churchill and a Lemming over Britains involvment in Iraq Tony Blair returned from Reagans funeral to find that labour had  urlLink lost  nearly 500 seats in Council elections.   The PM, who has been at Ronald Reagan's funeral, urged Labour MPs to hold their nerve amid the anti-war "protest" vote. It was a difficult time and "lessons had to be learned", he said.   Speaking on BBC radio Robin Cook said:   "Out there are a lot of people who withheld their Labour vote because they disagreed with what we did in Iraq. "The tragedy is that hundreds of very good Labour councillors have lost their seats as a result of something which many of them themselves would have opposed. "If we are to win these people back, it's not enough to simply say we are holding our nerve, we are seeing it though,"  At least  urlLink  Red Ken  Livingstone  managed to scrap back in.

         The ABC science show  urlLink Catalyst  aired a  urlLink story  about Sébastien Murat training to break the free diving record. While I usually find Extreme sports boring and rather silly, there is something about what Sébastien Murat does that transcendes all that.   Sébastien Murat known as “The Human Sub” attempts to break the world record for extreme human breath-hold diving, made famous by the feature film ‘The Big Blue’. In the virtually bottomless waters of Kimbe Bay, on the island of New Britain, Papua New Guinea, he tries to reach an unbelievable depth of 180 metres, without the assistance of any breathing equipment.

      After being held for two and half years in Guantanomo Bay, Adelaide man David Hicks was finally charged by US authorities.  As can be seen in this  urlLink ABC Transcript , at least two of the three charges against Hicks look somewhat Dodgy.  Here is a site advocating a  urlLink Fair Go For David  Hicks

         Watched the  Jim Lehrer Newshour  on SBS this evening and it was fascinating to watch US Attorney General John Ashcroft getting a grilling from the Senate Judiciary Committee about allegations of a memo that suggests the President is not bound by International treaties prohibiting the torture of prisoners. A transcript of the program can be found  urlLink here .   urlLink Juan Cole  points out that;  A Republican Congress is most unlikely to impeach George W. Bush, even if it does become clear that he is the torturer in chief and that Lynddie England is not the mastermind behind Abu Ghuraib. But he could be prosecuted, even after leaving office, for breaking US law against torture.   American Media Icon Walter Cronkite had  urlLink this  to say about Ashcroft last september;  In his two and a half years in office, Attorney General John Ashcroft has earned himself a remarkable distinction as the Torquemada of American law. Tomás de Torquemada, you might recall, was the 15th-century Dominican friar who became the grand inquisitor of the Spanish Inquisition. He was largely responsible for its methods, including torture and the burning of heretics - Muslims in particular.   Ashcroft may be a hero of the Christian Right but he is not supported by  urlLink all  christians.

      Today the Transit of Venus occurred. Not much to look at I'm afraid. This  urlLink Melbourne Observatory  site is worth a look, has information about the 18th and 19th Century Transits of Venus. The  urlLink Airy Transit of Venus Simulator  is not as erotic as it sounds.

         Ronald Reagan former Actor and US President died today, probably reached the high point of his career with  urlLink this . Sadly missed by his family and the  urlLink Iron Lady  who once wrote about Reagan that he   "did not suffer from the dismal plague of doubts which has assailed so many politicians in our times and which has rendered them incapable of clear decisions."   A quote which is probably better applied to Thatcher herself. It seems that  urlLink CNN  broke the story of Reagans death a little  urlLink early .  Update  There was  urlLink this   Speaking in London, the Prime Minister, John Howard, described Mr Reagan as the greatest post World War II American leader.  and then  urlLink this   "He leaves behind a nation he restored and a world he helped to save," Mr Bush said in Paris.  And all the time I just thought he was an incompetent old bastard who should have been impeached.

      The rift between the French and the White House seems to be over with Bush now saying that Chirac is now welcome to  urlLink visit his Ranch . What the rabid anti Arab/French contributors to this  urlLink site  will make of all this is yet to be seen.

       urlLink Jim Kunstler  is an avid commentator on american architecture and society as seen in his  urlLink Eyesore of the Month:Architectural blunders in a monthly serial     Kunstlers writing can be quite biting as can be seen in his view of the above  urlLink Ontario Art School    a totemized retro-futuroid coffee table joined umbilically to its Soviet-style predecessor below. The message, apparently: art and design are nothing but fun fun fun. Nothing to get serious about. A playful spirit of induced hazard will keep students wondering when the checkered box might wobble free of its cute swizzle-stick legs and come crashing down on their heads. This exercise in hyper-entropic avant garde faggotry is so cutting edge that it is already out of date. The only question: which of the two conjoined buildings is more cruelly ridiculous?   Kunstler dislike of contemporary American society can be seen in this  urlLink movie review  of Michael Moores   Fahrenheit 9/11     Michael Moore gives me the chills and the creeps. I see America's future in his ponderous, slovenly, lurching figure, stalking congressmen with his video camera and his childish rhetorical questions. I see a nation of feckless, clueless overfed crybabies building up to tantrum. It will be a long, destructive tantrum with no times-out and it will prevent the nation from getting on with life under the new realities of the 21st century.

        A fascinating story via  urlLink Dogfight at Bankstown  through  urlLink Pharyngula  about the  urlLink terror  a woman felt when travelling on a US domestic flight with fourteen Syrian musicians. These musicians were a scary lot, one had a orthopedic shoe and another was carrying a McDonalds bag, and they made frequent trips to the toilet.  This xenophobia shown towards arabic people has become commonplace since 911 as can be seen in the following extract from a report on discrimination against Arab Americans:   A disturbing pattern emerged in the months following September 11 as airline crews and security began to remove passengers of Middle Eastern ethnicity and other people of color from their flights after boarding but before take-off, because some members of the crew or another passenger felt “uncomfortable” with them on board. Once back in the jetway or gate area, security typically would inform the passenger that, “the crew does not feel safe with you onboard,” the only articulated reason for the removal being a “feeling” of discomfort on the part of someone else on the plane. In most cases, this discomfort was attributed to the passenger’s name or perceived ethnicity, since all passengers had, before boarding, successfully passed through at least three levels of security including the Computer Assisted Passenger Screening System (CAPSS) and the FBI watch list .  pp16-17  urlLink Report on Hate Crimes and Discrimination against  Arab Americans: The post - September 11 Backlash  September 11, 2001 - October 11, 2002   Also a  urlLink story  about a cynical ad run by the Bush campaign that exploits the fear of Arabs (near airports).

         urlLink  Barista  has a  urlLink post  about the conviction of Martha Stewart and then there was the  urlLink sad story  about the arrest of Bobby Fischer, another unlikable american. Well do I remember when Bobby took on russian world chess champion Boris Spassky in 1972 at the height of the cold war. This spurred a chess craze at my school, just as Nixons visit to China introduced ping pong as a popular pastime.  Even then I sensed that Bobby really was the  ugly american  as his genius at chess was more than matched by his obnoxious personality. A more detailed article detailing Fischer's decline from American Hero to despised psychotic exile  urlLink here .

      If there is any truth in this Paul McGeough article in the  urlLink SMH  then the shit will really hit the fan:       Iyad Allawi, the new Prime Minister of Iraq, pulled a pistol and executed as many as six suspected insurgents at a Baghdad police station, just days before Washington handed control of the country to his interim government, according to two people who allege they witnessed the killings.

      searched for entries under  tripe  in  urlLink soup tales  and found these lines by Sassoon:   But as he stamped and shivered in the rain, My stale philosophies had served him well; Dreaming about his girl had sent his brain Blanker than ever--she'd no place in Hell.... 'Good God!' he laughed, and slowly filled his pipe, Wondering 'why he always talked such tripe'.  Siegfried Sassoon in  A Subaltern   Siegfried Loraine Sassoon.(1886-1967) was a poet who was deeply affected by his  urlLink experiences  in the Great War. In 1917 Sassoon wrote a  urlLink statement  against the continuation of the War which resulted in him being hospitalised for shell shock.  This Oxford University Site on  urlLink WWI Poetry  has some poems by Sassoon including this one;     Survivors  No doubt they'll soon get well;  the shock and strain Have caused their stammering,  disconnected talk. Of course they're 'longing to go  out again,' — These boys with old, scared faces,  learning to walk. They'll soon forget their haunted  nights; their cowed Subjection to the ghosts of friends who died,— Their dreams that drip with murder; and  they'll be proud Of glorious war that shatter'd all their pride... Men who went out to battle, grim and glad; Children, with eyes that hate you,  broken and mad.   Craiglockhart. October, 1917. Collected Poems 1908-1956, Siegfried Sassoon (Faber and Faber, 1984)

      The recent gaffe by the Murdoch owned  urlLink New York Post  when it  urlLink broke the story  that Dick Gephardt would be John Kerry's running mate, only to find the following day that it was to be Edwards. May have only been an embarrassment for this Murdoch rag well known  for its comic book style. However another Murdoch rag the  urlLink Sun  (UK) has recently reinforced a gaffe from 15 years ago which has cost a lot of money in lost subscriptions.  In 1989 after the Hillsborough Soccer tragedy the  Sun  falsley reported that   ..that Liverpool fans urinated on the rescuers and then stole from the bodies of the victims. This caused local sales of the Sun to collapse. And fifteen years later, the paper's circulation on Merseyside still hasn't recovered.   urlLink via Radio National  The  urlLink anger  that Liverpudlians hold over this incident has resurfaced when Wayne Rooney, a young star who plays for the Liverpool club Everton, sold his life story to the  Sun  which is engaged in a circulation war with its rival the  urlLink Mirror .

        In  urlLink The Age  Tony Parkinson in his column entitled  urlLink  Time will come again to let slip dogs of war   writes that   The growing number of nations pursuing a nuclear weapons program means a pre-emptive military strike such as that in Iraq is inevitable.   In a sneaky bit of hack journalism Parkinson spends half his column discussing remarks by Mohhamed  ElBaradei, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency.  Evidently ElBaradei argues that in the future    "I believe the Security Council should under certain circumstances authorise pre-emptive measures - collective pre-emptive measures - to address extreme threats to international peace and security, such as to prevent genocide or to counter an imminent threat to use weapons of mass destruction in an act of aggression."   Parkinson ( not ElBaradei) then goes on to link Syria, Libya and Iran to this scenario and concludes    For those tempted to think this whole threat assessment is a beat-up, the hallucinatory fantasy of Washington neo-cons, ElBaradei's warnings constitute an important wake-up call - both on the nature of the risks, and the necessary range of responses that might have to be considered.   The problem is Tony that this whole threat assessment is a  urlLink beat up  by Washington neo-cons as can be seen in this post by  urlLink Joshua Landis

       urlLink Dublin Dictionary : A dictionary of Dublin words and terms. Since a lot of these terms are sent in by readers, don't be surprised if some of these terms are just as likely to be in use other english speaking countries. The Irish Travellers get a mention in this dictionary with entries such as  Knackers ,  Jolliers  and  Nacaragua  all terms which show their marginalisation in Irish society.    Another despised subculture is the  Scanger    an individual of either innercity or Dublin Corporation estate origin, with a liking for acrylic track suits.   also see  anto  or  silkey .

       urlLink Mick Fealty's  site  urlLink Slugger O'Tool , looks at various strands of political aspects of life in Northern Ireland. Reading the extensive comments in some of the posts, such as this one on  urlLink an Orange Order parade which went past a nationalist area , is fascinating.  I suggest drinking a few pints of Guinness while doing so as they can be a long read.   Liked this quote I saw in the comments by  hurdy gurdy man    "Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it."  George Santayana In the paralell universe that is Northern Ireland this maxim becomes inverted - it is those who cannot forget the past that are most wont to repeat it.

        The High Court in a 4-3 finding upheld the Federal Governments right to indefinitely detain failed asylum seekers that have no other place to go. While this decision related to two asylum seekers, stateless Palestinian Ahmed al-Kateb and Iraqi Abbas al Khafaji, there are 13 other asylum seekers who may be affected by this decision.  This ruling overturns previous Federal court rulings which determined that the governments indefinate detention of people who had nowhere to go was illegal. Now these asylum seekers must rely on the mercy of the federal government or hope that a kinder nation (such as New Zealand) will accept them.   urlLink Ken Parish  at Troppo Armadillo has a good analysis of this decision and points out that the reasoning of the majority judges in the case of Palestinian was a little bizzare;   it must be accepted in the present appeal that, as the primary judge found, "there is no real likelihood or prospect of [the appellant's] removal in the reasonably foreseeable future", but that does not mean it will never occur. Whether and when it occurs depends largely, if not entirely, upon not only the course of events in the Middle East (his preferred destination being Gaza) but also upon the willingness of other countries to receive stateless Palestinians.    urlLink Troppo Armadillo  via  urlLink Barista

        As the Olympic juggernaut is about to overwhelm us, here is an amusing account of the  urlLink 1904 St Louis Summer olympics . The Marathon was a particular balls up with the initial winner being disqualified for hitching a lift. The eventual winner was a Thomas Hicks (pictured above) who finished the race in some distress:   It seems that Hicks had begged to lie down about ten miles from the finish line. Instead, his trainers gave him an oral dose of strychnine sulfate mixed into raw egg white to keep him going. This was not enough - they had to give him several more doses, as well as brandy, along the way. By the end of the race, Hicks had to actually be supported by two of his trainers so that he could cross the finish line (essentially, he was carried over the line with his feet moving back-and-forth). Hicks was very close to death's door. It took four doctor's to get him in good enough shape just to leave the grounds, eventually falling asleep on a trolley.   The accounts of other competitors in the Marathon such as the the Cuban Postman and the first two black Africans to compete in the olympics are worth reading. via  urlLink Black Triangle
