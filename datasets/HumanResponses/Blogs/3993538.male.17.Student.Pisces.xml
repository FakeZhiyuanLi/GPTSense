       When you look at me, what id it you see?  Is it my strength, my pride, my will.   Or is it my hurt, my pain, my skill.   Is it my knowledge, my joy, my faith.   Or is it my fear, my anger, my hate.   Is it my kindness, my warmth, my honesty.   Or is it my guilt, my abuse, my jealousy.   Is it my beauty, my happiness, my smile.   Or is it colour, my ugliness, my style.   Is it my loyalty, my success, my intelligence.   Or is it my pass, my mistake, my resentment.   Is it my respect, my individuality, my gratitude.   Or is it my defense, my failure, my attitude.   Is it my sensitivity, my patience, my confidence.   Or is it my temper, my animosity, my ignorance.   Is it my dreams, my hopes, my fame.   Or is it my struggle, my despair, my shape.   When you look at me tell me, what do you see?

      You called yesterday, to basically say That you cared for me but, that you just not in love Immediately I pretended to be feeling similarly And led you to believe I was OK to just walk away from the one thing That's unyielding and sacred to me  Well I guess I'm trying to be... nonchalant about it And I'm going to extremes... to prove I'm fine without you But in reality I'm slowly losing my mind Underneath the guise of a smile gradually I'm dying inside Friends ask me how I feel... and I lie convincingly 'Cause I don't want to reveal... the fact I'm suffereing So I wear my disguise, till I go home at night And turn down all the lights and I break down and cry  So what do you do when somebody you're so devoted to Suddenly just stops loving you And it seems they haven't got a clue Of the pain that rejection is putting you through Do you cling to your pride and sing "I will survive" Do you lash out and say "How dare you leave this way" Do you hold on in vain as they just slip away  Well I guess I'm trying to be... nonchalant about it And I'm going to extremes... to prove I'm fine without you But in reality I'm slowly losing my mind Underneath the guise of a smile gradually I'm dying inside Friends ask me how I feel... and I lie convincingly 'Cause I don't want to reveal... the fact I'm suffereing So I wear my disguise, till I go home at night And turn down all the lights and I break down and cry

      The promise of love... It came from my heart Thought all that we shared... Would last forever So where did things go wrong What happened that made things fall apart Why I just don't know It's so hard to let go of someone... I used to call my own  But I'll find a way I'll get over you one day I'll find a way I'm gonna deal with all this pain I'll find a way' Cause I know that somewhere... My soul mate is waiting for me Gonna make it through the day I'll find a way  Silence gets so intense... Without you to share a word I really miss your presence... This loneliness feels awkward But I won't call you... I refuse I'd rather lay here by myself in the dark... Crying my heart out I wish these tears could erase... All the memories of you but they can't  But I'll find a way I'll get over you one day I'll find a way I'm gonna deal with all this pain I'll find a way' Cause I know that somewhere... My soul mate is waiting for me Gonna make it through the day I'll find a way  'Cause what hurts today... In time will fade away When you told me goodbye... I felt so betrayed Find the courage... To move on One day I'll replace... The precious love I lost
