      A tiring day indeed.   We had our class chalet 4 days ago. Which means on the 31/05/04. Err,rite? It was fun though.   1st got up in the morning ard 10am. (which is so not me! usually i wake up at 3-4pm!) I make so much noise till ayn got up and start to swear and curse me. Hahaha! Funny!   Went to eat at Long John Silver and bumped into Syidah,Syikin,Hanisah & Reza. They are as pretty as ever.   Smiling and waving. Haha!   Then off we go to Yishun. Took 969 to meet Aidil coz i wanna borrow the Honey vcd.   Aidil called to say he couldnt send the vcd. Instead he asked his youngest bro to send it to me.   Reach Yishun den me and ayn were like talking and talking. Laughing2 den suddenly this cute kid just came up to us and say, "Nah!"   I'm shocked! Hes so cute! He's actually Aidil's lil bro. Hes name is Alfian. Damn cute! Ayn and me was like DAMN! HES CUTE! Haha!   Then off we went to Tamp back. We walk to tamp library bus stop to take 15 to Pasir Ris. We sat at the bus stop and were like arguing weder 15 pass that bus stop den came bus no.28 and there is Shasha and her lil bro. Her straight hair irritates me. But i'm soooo happy i got to meet her! At last!   We took 15 then met Syed and his new girlfren. She's very pretty. Her name? Nurul. Schling in Ngee Ann Poly thiz July. Takin engineerin or sometin. Forgot. After that met Chal and Fattah. Fattah so cute. Hahaha! Alwais bump into him.   The most funny incident is tat we all lost our way while findin for Aloha chalet. It really sux! But rily funny. Nurul was like so-so tired. Can see her face. It was like,God help me. Haha!   At last,after struggling finding for the chalet,Chal finally called Serina to pick us up. We reached the chalet, evryone was like hello2! A bit crappy and awkward but we just sit one corner and enjoy ourselves. I ate lots of crabsticks while Shasha and Ayn were like aiming on the satays. Esp the beef satays. Haha! We never help with the BBQ but we help them to eat. It was nice.   The bad news of the day! Syed told me dat Acit was already married! That means i dated a married guy! Yucks! Tat never have happened b4 among all my frenz! Oh my gawd. I almost broke down and cried but nevermind. I'll take it as a lesson. Never to get to noe a guy anyhow. It really sux. But nvrmind.   Then i took pic with Fattah. Haha! We were like all over each other. He hugs me,i hug him. Haha! Not to worry. he's like a bro to me. A lil bro. No speacial feelings. Took many pics. Click here. Click there. Posing2 for the pics. Gerek! Went home then later watch Mummy Returns.   Later got to go aunt's place coz my dad called to say tat his coming home late.   Well, its sooo my dad. Typical.   Den got to know from someone that liza and faj said that they dun wanna talk to the ITE students. Wat the hell. Its kinda a discrimination against the ITE students. Ahh.. Who cares anyway coz im no ITE student.  Haiz, tired already. Got to go to sleep. Catch up with ya'll later. Bubyez!
