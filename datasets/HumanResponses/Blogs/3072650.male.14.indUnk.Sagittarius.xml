      Ahh, Phantasy Star Online...  one of the funnest online games that I play offline. ... as well as the only one. With all this long-range, short-range, scifi mages, not-pausing-while-in-the-start-menu, one can get addicted. One day, I went into the menu of one of my other games, and tried (sub-consiously) to navigate it with the c-stick. But getting to beat episode I is a good goal, especially since the boss looks like a neon sign gone horribly, horribly evil.  GO BUY IT!!! NOT THE X-BOX VERSION!  x-box = waste of money = wasted money for Windows = wasted money for people that starve babies  Always behind you until you turn away, thusly ninja-ing into the nearest shadows, The Tempo

      I just got to beta a Gmail account, 1 gig of storage.  That's 1000 megs.  That means that I can store more information in my e-mail than I can on my old Win95 machine... saaaad.  So e-mail me, it won't matter, because my e-mail will only get full every 3 YEARS!  zero.exe(at)gmail.com  Always behind you until you turn away, thusly ninja-ing into the nearest shadows, The Tempo

      well... I just bought an archie sonic comic... and quite frankly, I do NOOOT like it. it made sonic sound like a valley ... er ... boy ... or something, and I am pretty sure that sonicteam did not want a green knuckles. Or Eggman's first name Julian. Poor guy.  I mean, seriously, you come up with brilliant ideas(heck, you've got an IQ of 300), but every single time some personified animal gets in the way.  AND THEN you, a male, has a feminine name.  Poor, poor eggman.  So, I will not include the archie comics in my studies.  Always behind you until you turn away, thusly ninja-ing into the nearest shadows, The Tempo  PS: Anti-X-box testimony: Today someone just blurted out "X-box!" for no good reason.  NO GOOD REASON I TELL YOU!! THEY'RE BEING BRAINWASHED!! Anyway, right after that, I said "Sucks."

      Well, I have begun research on sonicology and will thusly post my findings here.  question: When I say sonic, what comes to mind? average joe answer: that one fast food place! sonicologist answer: adventure.  society these days... too obsessed with sport games... BEFORE the dumb -- I mean X box, most of us didn't play sport games. Or volleyball games. I don't think those were even in existance until the shadow government made that one DOA game... *Sigh*  But before the X-box, we relied on the systems with mascots.  Mario, Sonic, Crash Bandicoot... they were all popular.  But then mr. no-mascot came with all the M-rated-ness and the neuter'd version of Halo - Bungee didn't finish it; mircosoft did.  If the X-box wasn't around, alota people would answer hedgehog over fast food.  Always behind you until you turn away, thusly ninja-ing into the nearest shadows, The Tempo

      At the going away party for my friend, Kylie Jones, at Boondocks, I owned Virtual On.  I lost to no-one. It's a giant-robot 1P-2P arcade game, 1 play for 2 tokens, 5$ gives you 10 plays on VO.  There are 10 "virtualiods"(VR is the abbreviation, don't ask) to choose from.  The 2P game is best 4 out of 9.  My favorite VRs are V.R. Fei-Yen (I ownz joo and teh police and teh government and teh moon with her) and V.R. Viper II.  Now, allow me to share some veteran VO war stories.  It was classic.  Here is Parker, a complete newbie to VO.(I had played it twice before going to boondocks) He challenged be, thinking that he could dethrone me quickly.  I selected a medium VR, and Parker chose a heavy-weapontry specialist.  Parker relied on pure power of weapontry throught all 9 rounds.  It was quite funny to see him launch a bomb when I was on the other side of the field; he "tried to confuse me with them" whereas I was oftentimes behind him when he launched them.  Anyway, he won 2 of the 3 rounds he won consecutively, whichin I was developing strategies and the like.  He was overconfident. VERY, very overconfident.      It was 3/2, Parker in the lead.  If he destroyed me once, I would have lost.  I had to destroy him twice.  We started off with Parker throwing his diskus-bomb at me, but I had already dashed to the left, jumped up and fired a few missiles at him.  He fired another diskus-bomb at me, and I took the hit, but fired a napalm bomb at him.  I was near-death, he was 1/4 out of HP.  I switched to ninja tactics.  He kept on firing his heavy projectiles and the like at me, but I was always dashing out of the way.  I mainly fired some grenades at him, and one or two missiles. He lost horribly.    The score was 3 even.  He launched a diskus-bomb at me, but I jumped over it.  MISSILES ARE POWERFUL AT CLOSE RANGE!!!  He fired at me with his heavies, and a few gunshots, but I ran from their blast radius.  I was barely sratched.  One more hit with anything and I'd of killed him.  Now - this is a very good strategy - as the VR cannot fire until the climax of the jump, normally locate your target and shoot at him with a powerful weapon before the climax of the jump.  He was destroyed midair.     Now, Parker challenged me again. This is ironic, but Kylie came up and messed with the dual joysticks when I was selecting the VR, and I, for the first time, selected Fei-Yen.  Parker selected Dorkas.  There is something very useful about Fei-Yen.  If she takes 2/3 damage, her armor turns gold and her attacks are 150% more powerful.    It is sooo emasculating to loose to a Fei-Yen, mainly beacause as the killing move I usually use the Heart Beam. Which is in the shape of a heart.  I dashed right at him at the begining and passed him, when he tried using a fireball at the start.  I destroyed him 1/4, Alan in the lead.  I'm too lazy to describe it.

      Me & my friend,  urlLink green_ninja , have been hacking the sonic advance 2 chao garden. We've sucessfully hacked the total ring value and the ring value for the white GBA minigame, and the total ring value APPEARANCE, of which the latter's maximum value is 8888.  Green_ninja suggests modding both the appearance and the total value to the same value; I, however, do not. here are the locations in the memory:  03001ab4 = minigame white GBA ring value -- 8 BIT-- 030044d8 = garden ring appearance value --16 BIT-- 03005254 = garden ring value --16 BIT--  Always behind you until you turn away, thusly ninja-ing into the nearest shadows, The Tempo

      Current music: few tracks ripped off of Sonic CD for the PC  So here I am, putting notes on my life for the first of May on the great expansion known as the internet.  My friend has made a blog in a last-ditch effort to get a gmail beta offer. This is his blog:  urlLink Life as We know it    Ok, now that that's down and finished, it is time to talk about how the universe has recognized the word "shigmuffin". The word "shigmuffin" was created nigh but a few minutes ago, in a simple IM conversation with green_ninja.  He was telling me that Sonic said the "sh**" word in the Japanese version of Sonic X. (kudos to whoever animated, produced, and storyline'd it)  I jamp* to conlusions, and my brain instantly thought of "shigmuffins".  Now you will get an exaustive definition and history on that word. Shigmuffin is a variable, as in it can be used as a noun, verb, etc. (i.e.: Look at that shigmuffin go!", "Wow... did she just shigmuffin her LUNCH?") It is not nessisarily an insult or the opposite of an insult, whatever that is. ... And that is all.  Now, on to the final part of this post.    look at me!! I know how to HTML!!    ahem, I am planning on writing a mecha science fiction soon. So there.

      Since my last post, don't you agree?  James and Ryan have been at California for the last 2 weeks, I'm going to be graded for a 5th Kyu in Aikido on July 13th, and I had a very good time at the Reniassance(sp?) festival with Kylie.  In my honest opinion, I am going to die at the grading, being as I have no freaking idea what the techniques are.  Oh, and did you know that Kylie's PC doesn't have a floppy drive? It is evil, very evil.  James says that Blogger gives you a list of people that share the same interest as you so he's going to use it as a way to find a girlfriend. Sad, eh? Oh, and I found out that nobody can out-ninja me at night. ... or at least in theory... I will have to test it... In other news, Kylie has invited me to an RPG with Jordan and Joseph, but nobody plans when the sessions happen. It's a tad annoying, being that I have to wait a long time and all. Dang, I feel like this needs to be longer. Eh well. I've been wasting my days playing the highly addictive game of Flight Simulator 2004, and I am currently flying around the japanese countryside in a biplane (Curtiss Jenny to be exact, for those who care).  I haven't seen a town since I've taken off.   Always behind you until you turn away, thusly ninja-ing into the nearest shadows, The Tempo

      Ok, so it's 2:30 AM, and I plan on spending the whole night up. I've already consumed 1 liter of pepsi, and I hope that's enough caffiene to keep me up all night.  Anyway, some of my readers might be wondering why I am doing this. Especially since this means all of those hours in front of the PC.  Although my parents will probably make me go to sleep,  I cannot, for "CURSES, I hath been foiled!" would be said. And that makes me most unhappy.  But, I digress. The reason for this test of geekness is simple - I am going to my friends house this afternoon (monday). BUT, thursday morning I have to wake up at 7:30. So, in order to get enough rest, I will deprive myself of sleep today/yesterday.  Thusly insuring my enough sleep-ness.  Oh, and this has been a goal of mine for a long time. I also plan on staying 2 days up straight. HAHAHAHAHA!!! HA! BUWHAHAHAH!!!     ...    DANG I need a MMORPG.

      Or the lack thereof, if you might consider it as. Alotta things have happened lately. For one, I put my RPG PBP forum back up, and ... uh ...    Well school is almosst back. *shoots self* Which is good and bad, but mostly bad. In fact, very bad and a tad good. The good part is that I get to see my high school friends more often, and the very bad part is the teachers, and the fact that most of the 8th grade left this year. Like, half of it.    So here I am, listinging to Japan-a-Radio on my iTunes, talking to Ryan, king of the nordic manslaughterers, and listening to my dog barking at harmless specters. and the King of Nordic Manslaughterers is sending me a picture of the girl he likes and it's messin' with my bandwidth, which is small enough already. And I'm on a quest to find a copy of "Godzilla: Destroy all Monsters" for the GCN, which another one of my friends thinks isn't as good as it is. BUT THE GAME HAS GODZILLA 2000  AND  GODZILLA '90's!!! Plus all this AWESOMENESS of japanese monsters. AND DANG THIS IS TAKING UP MY BANDWIDTH!!! but enough of current events. I was going to take a flight in a cessna 152 at 8 AM this morning, but the weather foiled that plot really good, making VFR impossible. So no flying for Alan. *sob sob sob*    Always behind you until you turn away, thusly ninja-ing into the nearest shadows, The Tempo
