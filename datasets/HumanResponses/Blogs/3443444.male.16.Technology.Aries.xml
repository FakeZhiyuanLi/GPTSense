      Another poker tournament, another fucking loss, the same way as all the other ones. I think I may have explained this before, but you're gonna listen to it again. The way I lose at poker, goes like this. At the start, I win a couple of good sized pots, so I'm usually in chip lead for quite a while, until some lucky bastard gets the luckiest crap ever to fuck me out of $5 or so, and this happens a couple of times. Sure, I win a couple hands between those big hands, but it never equals the amount when I lose with my three of a kind, to the person who has the only 2 cards that could of possibly beat me. Its shit like that that makes me hate poker.  And after the horrible defeat today, I realized that there hasn't been a time in my life where I have actually been, really happy, theres always been something to ruin my life. Wether it be my brother fighting with my Mom like 8 years ago, or last October where I was depressed for a reason some of you probably know, or wether I've just been lonely, and have been alone for 16 years....  And school's almost out, hooray for that, but it also sucks, because I'm probably gonna get screwed out of an internship with HP because of my age, so I'll be sitting at home, staring at the wall all summer, with nothing to do, nowhere to go, and nothing to learn. and beacuse I spend most of the day in the lab, I'm failing 2 of my other 3 classes...so, yeah....  That's all I have to say about that.

      As the title indicates, I'm very boring, not much happened today, I just went to school, fixed some shit, dealt with some shit, did some other shit, wrestled with Mar during lunch, ate pizza, and got pissed at my Mom for something, its a long story, not that important.  There was supposed to be a poker tournament today at Mitchells as I stated yesterday I believe, but that was cancelled due to, something, I dunno....so I just played poker online (WHICH SUCKS!) and lost miserably. For example, I had an Ace high flush, which only a couple hands can beat as you probably know...well there was only one combination of 2 cards  that could of beat me, And some guy just happen to have it after I bet like, half my stack. It was a depressing moment in my life.  And let me introduce Robin (the girl who made the only comment on my last post, to those of you who don't know her. Robin is a girl that I met on www.gamefaqs.com, on one of the social boards there (LUE). She posted a picture of herself, I thought she was cute, so I added her to MSN Messenger and started talking to her, more and more, along with liking her more and more. I then found out that she had a webcam, and so we started camming back and forth, until my cam started to hate my computer at some random time. So now, I usually just watch her as we talk...Creepy? Yes, very....Anyhow, I'm rather obsessed with her, and would give my left arm to meet her, but she lives in Newfoundland, so that makes it extremely hard. :(   I know that most of you (out of the 4 of you who read this blog) don't really care too much about my "love life" as the kids say, but this is a very rare occurance for me, so whoever doesn't like it, can kindly go fuck yourselves ^_^

      I'm starting to hate poker....especially online poker, just because you can't see the people you're playing against to read them at all, its all based on best hand only. I can't wait till tomorrow though, an actual poker tourny at Mitchell's house. should be quite the turn-out methinks.  Really, the only other thing going on is certian issues within the HP SIC....but thats strictly on a need-to-know basis only....and yes, I'm serious :D  I'm saddened due to the fact that my first post on my new blog got absolutly NO comments at all. I even sent out an e-mail to a lot of people telling them about it  ;_;    Well, I've got to do some homework.  Thats all I have to say about that.

      Welcome everybody, to my new blog! As you know, I have a blog at Xanga.com, which I will be abandoning for this one, since Google will soon take over the world, I might as well start now.   Well, here I am, my new blog!   Oh Yeah!   I've had many good memories at my old blog, but it seems that it turned into work to keep it updated. And yes, I do realize that this is the same exact thing....but its not, this one looks better, and the look of the bookmark isn't all crappified as was with Xanga. Ok, to be completely honest, I made this blog out of sheer boredom while sitting here after school with Meaghan, waiting for her mom to get here to give me a ride home. But it really is better.  Enough with that...on Saturday, we had our standard poker night, only better because it was at my house instead of Popham's. It was also improved because of the fact that I was up to $24 at one point...I started with $5. I knew I should have cashed out right then, but I really like poker and wanted to keep playing, along with my nemisis, Mitchell. It was rather even, up until "el mano de diablo" as its come to be known. In this hand, Mitchell was dealing, and he dealt me pocket 2's, a crappy starting hand, but it was better than the ones I'd been getting for the past 45 minutes, so, I played. We both call, the flop comes, 4, 2, ace. I have trip 2's. I bet $5, he quickly calls. The Turn comes, 8, no help, I check, then Mitchell bets $5, thinking he has 2 pair, I call. The River, a 10 or something. I check, he checks. I flip over my cards with excitment, only to be crushed when he reveals his damn pocket aces. I lost. I nearly died/killed him at the exact same moment. That was the biggest pot I'd ever been involved in, over $20. After anoter run of crappy cards, I eventually have a semi-good hand, and go all-in, I have him beat up until the river, in which his damn flush, beats my straight. I was angry.  On Sunday, I did nothing, I did nothing and it was everything that I thought it could be. I just layed on my bed, watched TV and/or listened to music, and talked to people on MSN messenger, and played online poker, in which I played in a Tournament on Pacific Poker, and got 20th place out of nearly a thousand people. Not quite my highest finish ever (which was third out of over 800) but I think I did quite well.  And now today, Monday the 24th, I sit at school, waiting for a ride home as you know. And am bored out of my skull, but I am listening to Eddie Izzard, so thats a plus.  But anyhow, I must be off, for the ride is due in a while.   - Lee

      Today was actually kind of exciting. I flew in a match for Battlefield 1942 against a crappy clan. And when I came into the server with the wrong tag on (the tag for my other clan) they got all pissed off and complained about how our team was so stacked, and wondering if I was on the roster or not, it was a great feeling know that just because of my 1337-ness, I can piss off an entire opposing team! And after they told us to suck their dicks, and how they were gonna kick our asses....we proceeded to wipe the filthy, blood soaked, spider infested desert floor of Operation Battleax, with their scrotums. After the match they complained about how we were a team of ringers, (damn fine ringers too) and how their starters weren't there. I believe that I was accused of hacking somewhere in the match too, thats always a good feeling, knowing that you're that much better than somebody....  After that, I did my usual routine of sitting on my ass, playing poker, and talking to people online. At around 10 or so, I was talking to one of my friends, Shannon, and she invited one of her friends to the conversation, then another one who I'm friends with also, I was completely overrun by estrogen. Although it wasn't that bad, since we discussed  urlLink eBaums World  for a good hour or so, and it turns out, that when a group of girls talk to each other, they talk a lot like guys do, cussing and yelling and threatening, it was great. And then, the massive pool of estrogen overflowed, and there was a half hour conversation about Neopets (which I, of course, wasn't in). After that, it was back to the normal, rowdy conversation from before, but was cut short because by then, it was past midnight.  After they left, I just sat back, watched some TV, and then listened to some music, that is, until this enormous, gargantuan devil of a moth flew in my window, and touched me...needless to say, he is now rotting in the 7th circle of Hell thanks to a well placed stomping/grinding motion with one of my shoes.  Oh my God, my Mom brought Baked Lays!! Do you people have any idea how much those kick ass?! I know you do Tyler....

      In a comment made by my one and only reader, he said that if I kept posting in this blog with a picture, that he'd keep reading. So what do all of my faithful listeners think? Should I just put a random porn picture on here for all of you to enjoy? I'm still undecided.

         Oh my god, she is hot.  I just heard today that Morgan Webb, the beloved host of G4TechTV's X-play posed for  urlLink Maxim Magazine  Appearantly this has been known for quite a while, but its news to me.  Geek's all across America have begged and pleaded for something of this nature. Just imagine how much one of those 50 year old guys that pretends to be a teenage girl on the internet finally getting a hold of a Playboy with the Olsen Twins in it. Thats what this is like to Geeks.  On a completely unrelated note, Trent, aka God, got a new blog a couple days ago, and he mentioned my blog in there, even had a strange little picture, which looks nothing like me....so, to both of you that read this blog, go visit his.  urlLink http://thenewtrent.blogspot.com/

      During the rousing events of today, which involved sitting on my futon on my laptop, mowing the lawn, playing poker, and sitting on my futon some more, I decided to go look at a couple of other random people's blogs, and it made me remember just how much I hate people, or at least how much they bug the bloody 'ell out of me, eh? Especially those damn 13 year old girls that have their own blog....Heres an entry from that exact demographic, from a girl that goes by "Sweet Princess", typical, isn't it?   wee going out later for father's day dinner..yipee...had a baddy stomachache..damn it..dunno wat i ate..(-_-)" hmm..tml i swear i am going to poa classes..skipped 3 lesson liao..cannot b like tis animore..hmm better not oversleep again..  haiz i decided to forgive phyllis..i must be like my heavenly father..learn to forgive n forget..love my enemies..hmm mayb tis is e best solution..tink positively..b a better gaL!! hmm..tis few days got chat wif phyllis..hmm happy..n glad..>  haiz gotta clear my table one of tis days..got so many junk CHINESE paper..c until headache!! k gtg now bb :P   Now please, tell me with a straight face, that the italicized text that you just read, didn't hurt your eyes/head, and that it wasn't the biggest peice of crap that you have ever laid eyes on. As far as I can gather, in that chicks fucked up mind, "tml" means "tomorrow"  and "wif" does indeed mean "with". I have no idea what the holy hell "poa" means, or "liao", although I think it may be Hawaiian. And it took me well over 3 minutes to decifer that "haiz" equals "hey's" which still isn't even a word. How sad is it when some dumb chick fucks up a word,  THAT ISN'T EVEN A REAL WORD!!  It's devestating to my remaining hope for humans.  This next part, is what this damn "Sweet Princess" wrote about herself in the About section of her blog:   My name is kelLY..everyone call mi kel..haha i like to play piano..surf net..daydreamz..act bitchy...eat lolipop (yummy)!! blahz blah as e list goes on..Eh..currently studying in marsiling sec (berri wu lu sch) haiz.. Results arrg!! HoRRIBLE Juz wanna Say Life suX..tt aLl   Simply amazing. And if anybody out there can figure out what exactly  currently studying in marsiling sec (berri wu lu sch) haiz..  means, I will pay you. I think I got the first three words, but after that the damn bitch kinda trails off into a language that looks like German. And with that, I concluded that this girl, as with most girls that spell "with" like a fucking 3 year old, is a  NAZI!!  Yes, you heard me right, the same goes for Hilary Duff, that god damn goose-stepping whore. I actually have proof that Hilary Duff is a Nazi, and that proof is in the following link.   urlLink http://subliminal.ytmnd.com/   hAvE i SaId ThAt AlTeRnAtInG cApS pIsS mE oFf?/!1  Kudos to Kevin Rose, and Sarah Lane, Hosts for the show The Screen Savers, as their blogs, kick ass and follow every rule in the book for making a blog the proper way.  I could keep this up, and go on a "Maddox-esque" rant about how people suck, but I'll leave that for later. Something I may do in the future, is make a collection of the crappiest blogs and/or websites, and post all the links on here for y'all to enjoy, and laugh at. Expect that to come in my next entry.  I have a small homework assignment for anyone out there who read this blog entry. If you've only read this sentance, please, take 10 seconds and e-mail me at  urlLink LeeDeaton@gmail.com . I just wanna get a feel for who my audience is for these.   Update:  I've discovered why young girls type the way they do! If you would notice, the word "wif" is said by 3 year olds who can't talk right, or by kids who don't have front teeth. And "tink" (supposed to be "think") is also said by either 3 year olds, or kids with no front teeth. And since you can't type wrong because you have no front teeth, I've come down to the conclusion that the majority of girls who type like "Sweet Princess" up there, are mentally 3 years old.   Another Update:  I can't possibly put into words the shittyness of this girls blog. You have to see this abomination for yourself.    urlLink http://gnettelovesgreentea.blogspot.com/

       - Fran Lebowitz  From now on, I think I might do a little quote of the day thing, since I just plain suck at coming up with witty titles.  Its official, www.grouphug.us is  THE BEST WEBSITE EVER!  Everybody who reads this must go there RIGHT NOW! Its the funnies/saddest site you will ever see. Here's a sample:   "In 1990 or 1991, someone left a large salmon head hidden inside the piano in the Diamond residence hall at Southern Oregon State College. After several weeks, the smell was unbearable, but it would be several more weeks before the source of the stench was found. The paino was seen that summer outside, covered in plastic, presumably because it was ruined by the rotting fish head... That I put there.  I still laugh about it to this day. That fish head was the best 75 cents I've ever spent (I bought it at Safeway. Why they were selling fish heads is beyond me, but when life gives you fish heads, make stinky pianos I always say)."   And theres a lot more like that, but its mainly about angsty teens and cutting themselves and how they weigh 100 pounds and are too fat, or how they're boyfriend is a dumbass and they're only going out with them because they feel sorry for him. Its hilarious, yet sad because these confessions come from actual people.  Only 3 people besides myself will understand this next part, maybe more if I feel like explaining it, but its like midnight, so probably not. A 4 FUCKING 7!! Every rule in the poker book just gave me the finger!! Jason (Not Stubbs) I hope you burn in hell for that act of bullshit!  And on that note, it looks like I'm gonna be getting somewhere around $75 this week, and Saving Private Ryan on DVD! :D  Not much else to say....

      I must agree with my good friend Alice Cooper, and say that school is indeed out, for the summer. And so, for the next 3 or so months, you can find me located on my futon in my bedroom, most likely laying on my side, whilst on my laptop. Thats right, I said whilst, I'm trying to incorporate in some old english into my life. Will it work? no, but what have I got to lose....The respect of most of my friends? Possibly.....  Today's been a relatively good day, as opposed to days that aren't quite as good as this one.  The main event of today, happened at around 5:29-ish this afternoon. It was at that time, when I got a GMail account. For those of you that don't know what GMail is, Its Google's new E-mail service which is currently in Beta testing, and isn't avaliable to the general public. The only way to get a GMail account to call your own is by knowing people who already have a GMail account that can invite you to get it. So if you ever need to e-mail me, please, don't use my Hotmail account, as it sucks ass. E-mail me at  leedeaton@gmail.com  from now on.  And yesterday, I played poker over at Neil's, which was a mistake...turns out Neil used to play poker quite often a few years back, and after a slow start, he proceeded to kick our asses. So the only business that I'll be doing over there, is ordering pizza.  I've noticed why I like poker so much! Its because I can't stand to be worse at something than somebody. Same thing happened with Battlefield 1942. Sure, it was fun and all, but people were still better than me at it, and that bugged the hell out of me, so I played more and more, until I caught the eye of a clan, who took me in, and made me even better, and it was in that clan that I became a pilot, and when I started that, I sucked ass, but with some help from 2 brothers, named Golden Eye, and Knives, I became better than them. When I played in a scrim against my old clan, I could actually say to them "When I left you I was but the learner, now I am the master" and mean it! And I then proceeded to shoot them down in about 3.8 seconds. and it was then that I knew that I was amungst the top 5 in the world at being a pilot for that game. And my quest for perfect-ness, was accomplished. And so now, after BF 1942 is dead, I took up a new hobby, Poker, and I'm on that same quest. So in about 5 years or so, watch out....  Appearantly theres something wrong with the comments on here, and how you have to be a member to post one. Well, from what I see, you don't have to, so I don't know what you're complaining about. So whoever reads this post, please, try and leave a comment, and if it doesn't work, e-mail me to let me know that it wouldn't work.   Update:  I found my USB thumbdrive! It was in the pocket of a pair of jeans I barely wear, but I guess wore once, and forgot about the thunbdrive. so, yay!  And as I said, if you're going to e-mail me about anything, wether it be if I think the Red Sox are going to make it to the World Series, or if you can't make a comment, please, e-mail me at  leedeaton@gmail.com .

      Ever since this god damn poker thing started, I've been fucked out of so much money by a bunch of bullshit. It turns out that I am the unluckiest person alive, I actually won the first tournament in my young career, then lost it because I'm a fucking pussy that can't say no....they made me play fucking 5-Card-Draw, the all-time worst game ever, I FUCKING HATE THAT GAME! And of course, do to more bullshit and crap, and human feces, I lost. And then, in another poker tournament after all that shit, I lost again due to bullshit, (ie. me losing to the only hand that can beat me, it seems as that happens ALL THE FUCKING TIME!!!) I don't even know why I play poker anymore, it just causes me to be pissed off at stupid shit like this.   For those of you who don't know, the 2nd worst feeling in the world for me, is losing, losing anything at all, wether it be a simple poker hand, or a baseball game or something. I FUCKING HATE IT. and nobody seems to get it. When I lose, I get annoyed/mad/pissed/whatever. NO SHIT! I'm not gonna sit there a loser saying something like "oh well hes a much better player than me, and deserves the money more than I do." Bullshit. Does anybody ever watch Phil Helmuth play, err, lose rather? He's a much worse sore loser, than me.  I did find out however, that I can read people really well. I can usually tell people what they have by the way they act and how they bet and all that. 4/5 times when somebody bets, I can tell what they have, and be right about it. But, I don't trust what I think and I end up calling anyway, because I have the top two pair, and theres a small chance that they could be bluffing. Like today, I was playing against my Mom and Popham. Nearly everytime I had the 2nd best hand (which seemed like every damn time) I said out loud what they had that kicked my ass, and was right. And a couple of months ago when we were playing, I called Glen's pocket pairs nearly every time, and when Schiffman played the one time, I said out loud that hes bluffing, but I didn't trust myself, and folded...I would've fucking won. And a couple weeks after that, Jason bet like $4 on some crap, and he was kind of nervously tapping his foot on the ground, and I said out loud that hes bluffing to everyone, 3 people besides hime were still in...nobody called...and I was right, again. I just don't know what the fucks wrong with me, and why the fuck I even play poker anymore. It just is starting to seem like a big ass waste of time and money. Even though I consider myself better than a lot of the people out there, and even though I'm only 16....

      Shit Shit Shit.  As some of you know, I have a little USB Thumbdrive, that I dont know how I lived without. Well today, at roughly 10:58 PM, I discovered that it wasn't in my pocket like it always has been. And its nowhere in my room, or the living room where I was just sitting. My only guess is that is in the Dentist Office's chair I was in on Thursday. That little thing was like my life, I don't know how me, or James lived without it. I am so sad. that thing was like my pet. I would occasionally pet it for no reason....I've said too much. Oh my! Moving on Swiftly, there are somewhere around 4 days of school left. Yay. The down side? I have like 354562 tests to make up from classes I've missed. But hopefully, during the summmer I'll get an internship with HP, that would be the highlight of my life if that happened. That's all I have to say about that.

            Finally, the title for Episode three was released, and this time the fans got it right. I am so excited, words can't describe it. More news is that the Original Trilogy will be out on DVD for the first time ever, in September, appearantly with some MORE edits, and added scenes and all that Lucas-y stuff. My god, I can't wait. Just a warning, if you see some Star Wars references in my blog for the next year and a half, its not my fault....        Anyhow, to all of my faithful readers that I'm unaware of, I haven't died, I've just been too lazy to update my blog, and have taken quite a bit of flak from Tyler, and a couple others because of it. Tyler, the bastard, just wouldn't leave me alone, calling me disgusting names because of my lack of work on this blog, I don't quite understand why he was so mean about it :(      Well, at 2:46 AM, I have nothing better to do, so I decided that I might as well....that, and the fact that Tyler had made several threats on my life if I didn't update it. but luckily, hes in Washington at a basketball camp, so I didn't have to worry about this until he gets back, which is soon.       The past week or two has been rather uneventful, although mine and Tyler's Mom has formed an evil allience to completely wipe out our poker extravaganzas. Appearantly, they think that me and Tyler are addicted to poker and think we should only play 2 times a month. And my Mom has incorperated the rule that I can't ride in anybody's car who hasn't had their license more than 6 months, and since I don't have my license, and usually my Mom is at work, my Dad is god knows where, and my brother has a girlfriend, somebody else is usually my only mode of transportation, unless I walk, but poker night is across town, so thats a negative on that. I must say that it is very stupid, and they just don't realize that playing poker is fun, and its something that I like to do, and it gets me out of the house, and away from this here computer, which happpens to be something that my Mom always complains about....    Well, thats all for now, I might have more to come later, most likely tomorrow, so keep and eye out....as much as that will hurt.

      Probably as you know, if you haven't been living under a rock for the past 228 years, today, was our Independence Day, or as we know it, the 4th of July. And because we're Americans, we like to watch stuff that blows up, or thats shiny. So every year, on July 4th, we go down to the bay/lake/whatever type of body of water there's avaliable to pollute, and we go and shoot a bunch of stuff into the sky that just happen to blow up, and are shiny all at the same time. And because I had nothing better to do, I did the same thing as most of the American's today, and went and watched the fireworks (which is crap, because fireworks were invented in China!). Every year (except last year) me and my family go down to the same spot on Highway 101 to watch the fireworks, its a damn fine spot if I must say. This year was no different, me and two friends, Tyler and Jason, walked down from Tyler's house to our famous spot, which was quite the adventurous hike since we encountered Braxton and Kelton along the journey, I hoped to play poker since Tyler brought his brand new chips down there in hopes to find time to play a few games of poker while we waited. But that didn't happen, as we walked (fell, really) down to the beach. And then because we were bored down there, we threw rocks into a little creek down there. And when it got to be a little later, we ventured out into the bay, which, since the tide was out, was filled with sand, and we found a big ass log out there which we were planning on sitting on and watching the fireworks. Until these 3 girls and one guy came walking from somewhere and also came to sit on OUR log! So, they sat down, and made small talk, (this is were it gets exciting!) offered us a couple of beers, and since they were cold, cuddled up close to us, and started kissing our necks and whispering to us....or man, it was like a dream come true...they left their drunk, nearly passed out friend on the other side of the log. It was almost perfect how there were three girls, all good looking who wanted to talk to us, and make out with us, and three of us there (Me, Jason, and Tyler). After a short while, they got a little bit closer to us and starting trying to make out with us, and grope us, and with us being guys, we didn't object to this. After another short while, Jason, with his damn red hair won over ALL THREE girls, and we think that they're all pregnant now....  Ok, so I lied..... Most of what I just said didn't really happen, but it sure does make it more interesting than the real story!   The REAL Story  We really were sitting out on a log in the middle of a bay, and 3 girls and a drunk guy really did come sit on our log, and they did make small talk and offer us beers, but after a short while, they were REALLY annoying, so we left to go out to a big ass rock....about halfway to the rock, Tyler discovered that we just left 3, very drunk college girls, and we made a horrifying strategical error. Because all of what I said before, very possibly could have happened....although highly doubtful....  And Tomorrow, Tyler is organizing a special 4th of July poker tournament! Complete with brand new poker chips bought and cared for by Tyler himself! I had the pleasure of seeing these chips, and oh man, they are nice!

      Yesterday I played poker against my Mom and my brother, it wasn't even my idea, they kind of forced me to play, and for that, I had to win. I won $20, my brother bought back in and lost it even faster than the first time. The only time I was below what I started with was just after the first hand I lost my $0.20 it took to call....then I won the 2nd, and 3rd hands, and didn't really lose again.  And today, I was in an online tournament, it started at 10 PM, I got knocked out around 12:30 or so. At the beginning, I lost 3 hands, and then kicked the ass of some poor schmuck when he went all in against my full house, aces over 9s. I was up to just over 2K. After that, I kept getting awesome hands and knocking people out left and right. I was doing pretty good until I got up to about 5K. Then I had pocket aces, and one person went all in in front of me, and of course, I called, I had about 2K left, the flop came A-K-10, 3 more people went all-in, of course I called, and I won $15K or so. Then 3 hands later, I got pocket kings! The flop came 2-9-K! some guy raised a couple hundred, I rereaised all-in, and 3 people called! So ummm, on that hand, I believe I was up to $30K or so. And so a little later on, I, again, had pocket aces, I raised a couple hundred on the flop. the majority of the people called. the flop, an amazing A-J-J. I flopped a full house. somebody bets a couple thousand, I call. the next card, a king. the chip leader at the time, he had like, 50K or so, went all-in, me, and 3 (!!!) other people called, guess who won over $70,000? That's right. Me. And I became the chip leader, with more than double of what the guy in 2nd had! And I remained the chip leader until the hand before I got knocked out! Here's the scenario for my last hand. I had 40K, I hold K-J off suit. the flop comes K-2-8, with 2 hearts, a guy raises 5K, I reraise all-in, he calls, and so does somebody else who had like, 5K total. So if I win this hand, I would win over $110K! the turn is a jack of hearts, which means that I have two pair, but there are three hearts on the board, and I didn't think that somebody would call 50K with a flush draw....the river is a 5 of diamonds or something. The otehr two guys lose miserably, and the guy who beat me, had q-8 of hearts...when I raised almost 40 thousand dollars, he had nothing but a queen high flush draw....and with the card that gave me two pair, he got his flush....and he won $111K. And I just stared in disbelief for about 2 minutes. And slowly walked into my room, hanging my head in shame. I won $1338, and took 36th place.  (Note: I used K's, instead of "thousand" or "...,000" because its shorter to type.)  And from what I understand, Tyler is holding a poker tournament on Monday the 5th, and I will proceed to kick some ass.

      The past week or so, nothing really has been happening, I've just been sitting here doing my usual routine, which is just me, sitting on my futon on my laptop with either my TV on or music playing in the background. I have talked to Shannon pretty much all the time, so thats a nice plus. And I just had my braces tightened yesterday, so my mouth hurts like a bitch....

      I have yet to recieve my iRiver, and according to the shipment tracking that FedEx has, it was just sitting in a warehouse 2 hours away for over a day, and when it left said warehouse, it was 2:39 AM, which is exactly 18 hours ago from now. I haven't heard anything since that time. So, its been 18 hours, for an under 2 hour journey, and according to their tracking, it hasn't made any stops yet. I am befuddled.  I do however, have some good news! First off, Cait said that she was gonna come over and bring me pizza and hang out for a while, this is such great news because I haven't seen her it what seems like forever and I really miss her. And also in October, the 11th-18th to be exact, My Mom, my Dad and I are going to Las Vegas. We're gonna be staying at the Stratosphere tower hotel since its really cheap, but I think its just so my Mom can always find out hotel...It should be fun there, with all the hookers, and celebrities etc. I have only one thing that would be nice, a fake ID so I could sneak into Bellagio's poker room, or at least watch a poker tournament or something!

      My Mom got her money today, and it was ordered at 2:55 PM today off of Newegg.com. With standard FedEx Express shipping, it will be here on Sunday the 8th. If you ever talk to me, odds are I'll be downloading music so I can fill up this behemoth.

      ...even if it is only temporary...Because you see, my Mom is getting a loan for $12,000 or so to pay off her credit cards/bills/etc. Well, she'll have a couple thousand left after all that, and our vacation. So, she's buying front row wrestling tickets for my brother, so she decided to get me an object of my choice. I chose a nice ass MP3 player, after some quick research, I chose the iRiver iHP-120 20GB MP3 player:   It has a 20 GB hard drive, which is about 10 times the amount of music I actually have, but luckily, since iRiver doesn't suck, it can be used as an external hard drive, a voice recorder, and it has the ability to record from any outside source. So I found it to be quite a useful device. Since I only have under 2 gigs of songs, I decided to go prowl some message boards asking for reccomendations to fill my new, expensive toy. Well, on one board, known as LUE which is notorious for its bad behavior all over the GameFAQ's message boards, I had 29 people in 5 minutes telling me how iPods are better than my iRiver in every way possible, which sadly, it is not. I even had one person tell me that all iRivers suck and iPods are so much better, and threw in the fact that hes  not  a fanboy, because he owns a   Dell DJ!   Now, I must say that Dell DJ's suck a rather significant amount of ass, and no, this isn't coming from a potential future HP employee, its coming from somebody who knows a little something about technology.  If one of my faithful readers wouldn't mind too much, please, either make a comment, or e-mail me sending me a nice big list of some good songs that you know of. It'd be greatly appreciated.
