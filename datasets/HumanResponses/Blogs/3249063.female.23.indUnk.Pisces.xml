      Well, here I am on a freakin' HOLIDAY at school waiting on this boring class to start. I really hate the fact that we have class today, but I have to accept it because there is really nothing that I can do about it. Plus, it is necessary because our classes only go for 6 weeks and every week is critical since we only go once a week. Maybe I should suck it up.  I had a great weekend. I had a fun filled Saturday. I worked for a while, then I went shopping and took myself to a fancy dinner. Then I went back to O-town for a bit....stopped at the bar and had a few cocktails at around 6ish or so. I know I said that I was going to cut down on my drinking, and I have, but Saturday was the perfect day for amaretto Sours. I had 3 and then I went home and took a nap for an hour. Then, I woke up and got freshened up to go party in KC. I had a blast. Every Saturday at King Louie (bowling, pool, arcades), they have Xtreme bowling from midnight to 3am. It is where they have a DJ and the lights are off and all of the bowling pins are neon and glow in the dark. It is like a club in a bowling alley. They also have a bar. Anyway, it is 13 bucks to get in , but that covers everything (unlimited bowling and pool for 3 hours, plus a great dj). The bar stays open til 1 or 2 and you can bring your drink to the pool tables or bowling lanes. It was a lot of fun and it may very well be my Saturday night hangout. So, I hung out with a friend after bowling until like 5am, then I drove back to O-town and made it back by 6:15am. Since it was already daybreak, I stayed awake all day Sunday and hit the sack at 10 last night. I slept like a baby.  Today I don't get to enjoy the holiday because I am at school. I am taking off work on Wednesday....maybe I'll make up for it then....who knows?   That's all for now

      Whew!!!! It's hotter than a hooker on a Friday night outside. I hate it so bad. I think I need to move to the North Pole or something. Nothing much going on here. Been working all day, not complaining because it's been a good day-for the most part. I switched my insurance company to a company in Ottawa-why did I do that? I thought that my premium would go down? No, it went up a few bucks because they noticed a speeding ticket I got last summer. Plus, they talked me into getting a renter's insurance policy in the event that my apartment is burglarized or burned down....So I did it. I think it is beneficial just in case an unexpectancy occurs. I think every renter needs renters insurance....Just in case.   Well, I had a VERY late night last night, but it was awesome and a lot of fun. I don't regret staying out so late-even though I had to wake up at 7 to make it to work by 8am. I made it to be at like 345 and woke up at 7 in a great mood.   Houston (my guinea pig) is getting more attached to me. He used to hide in his igloo if he heard me come in the door. Now, he comes to the door of the cage when he hears the door so that I can pick him up. He is also showing emotion to express that he dislikes when I am not there. This proves to my many friends that consider him a rodent, that he is a normal pet.   Well, I am outta here for now.

      I have made the decision to buy myself a wonderful gift when I graduate with my Master's in January. I have to start saving now, though. Oh well. I'll try. I have ALWAYS wanted a sporty bright orange motorcycle. I love motorcycles ( the smaller ones). So my plan is to get my buy one for myself when I complete my degree. I can't wait. I have also been thinking of places to move to. Until this week I was certain that Dallas was the place for me. Dallas is still top on the list, but there is so much out there.   The Lakers game is coming on soon- so that is all for now

      This has been another busy day, but I am not complaining at all. I like it that way most of the time. My life is smooth sailing right now, for the most part. Back to normality for once. Things seem to working in my favor in all aspects of my life and I am thankful for that. My relationship with my family is on the rocks for many different reasons, but I am sure they will eventually work out.  Work is going good. I had to ride to a meeting in COffey COunty yesterday with the Executive Director of the organization that I work for. She is a powerful lady and can be intimidating. So, it was just us two in the car and she praised me and my productivity the entire time. It made me feel good. we talked about personal issues as well as work related ones and it made me feel really comfortable.   I haven't really had much social interaction with anyone lately. I kinda like it but I kinda miss it too. I am glad that my friendship with a good friend is back on track. For a while, my friendship with LaShawn was shaky because of a situation he put himself in. Before he got into it, he would call daily and we would hang out about three times a week. Well, for a while, our contact was non-existant and I started feeling like the friendship was gone. Well, last night, I was planning on going to Applebee's by myself and having dinner and a drink when my cell rings. It's LaShawn. "Hey girl, I KNOW you are coming over to have dinner with me and watch the LAKERS game". FYI-the Lakers are both of our favorite team and its fair to say that I am obsessed with the LAkers. They are in the Playoffs which is a big deal. So I said "sure, I'll come over." SO I ate Blimpie for dinner and we sat down and talked for like 2 hours. It felt so good to know that he was missing the friendship too. I am glad things are good between us again. (Though he hasn't stopped doing what he's doing).  I have been putting my phone on vibrate at night to avoid the late night drama calls. I haven't received any for a while and I am thankful for that. I pray that it is over and at ease.  Thursday is going to be out of control. Brooke leaves next week to go to Vegas, so we are gonna have our girls' night  out THursday and Mulligan's and we are going to party hard. It has been a while since I have partied hard and I am looking forward to it.  I have been spending alot of time alone lately. I am discovering more and more things the more I spend time alone. I don't know whether or not it is good or bad stuff, but it is being revealed.  One of my co-workers told me that I am hard core. I really don't know what she meant but I am hoping that it was a good thing. Yes-I have four tattoos, I can bench press more than alot of men I know, I like to workout and run, I like to watch and play sports, I like video games....but I am also sensitive, very emotional, caring , open-hearted, i am obsessed with keeping my body clean, I love fragrances, I like to cook and so on and so on. I hope her hard core statement wasn't an insult or a misconception of me.   Well, I am off for now.

      Well, with a combination of last night's tornado scare and today's busy agenda, I am tired. I was in class when sirens for tornado warnings went off in KC, my class rushed to the basement area for about 20 minutes, then we were released. Then I was headed back to Ottawa (I had been in class all night....no access to a TV or radio....so I had NO IDEA WHAT THE HELL WAS HAPPENING). Luckily Brooke called as I was headed to Ottawa to tell me to turn around and head the other way b/c they, too were under a tornado warning. So I ended up going to KC, they were in the same boat Ottawa was in. It sucked. Finally, things slowed down and I headed back to O-town at midnight:30 or so. Then I had to wake up super early to be in meetings all day because I am on the Advisory Board for Franklin Co. Community Corrections. I had to go to Coffey County for this meeting all day. Now I back and I have to facilitate my therapy group until 7. I am tired. I think bed is the first place I'll go after work. Anyway, not much here. I hate my professor. He's a male-chauvinistic pig. We had an argument last night before the tornado scare. I am thinking about finishing this class online because I hate him so bad. We have a major personality conflict and his chauvinistic views collide with my feminist views only to create controversy. I really can't handle it. All of the other females in the class just sit back and take it like a bunch of dumbasses-which angers me even more.  We have class on Memorial Day- which also pisses my off. Give me a break. He is such an asshole.   Well that is all for now.

      Okay- I just got one of those forwards from a good friend of mine that asks you to fill in the blanks about your favorites. So that I won't have to deal with sending it to people, I decided to post it in a blog and if people are really interested in knowing what I like, they can go to the blog site. I also created my own version because (no offense "B") the ?'s on the original were stupid.  My favorites:  Food: Spinach, corn, peanut butter and jelly (not together, but I love them equally) Fruit: Banana, cherries. I think I like bananas better Drink: Water, Orange juice-equally Alcoholic Beverage: amaretto Sour, Bacardi O3 Store: Old Navy-for clothes, Pier 1 for home decor. Restaurant: Chipotle, Olive Garden, Canyon Cafe (on the Plaza), Thai Place (in Westport), On the Border, Chili's. Shoes: Adidas, Saucony, Air Max. I favor Adidas more. Sport: I love them all; basketball is my favorite, track is second. School subject: English is first, math is second.

      It's a given. No matter how well I take care of my body, no matter how much medicine I take to prevent catching a cold, I still get sick every time the season changes. It's been like this my entire life. My family often teases me because it is a known fact that no matter what happens, I get sick exactly 4 times per year (at the change of each season). Anyway, I am not sick yet, but I feel like my nose is clogged and and my throat feels like it will be sore in a few days. There is nothing I can do about it though.   I guess I had a good weekend-for the most part. Well, not really a good weekend, but a good Sunday. I did so many things in one day and I didn't even get tired. I woke up early and cleaned my ENTIRE house. That took a while. It is spotless. Then I made a fabulous lunch. I made vegetable strir-fry (bake). Though I specialize in stir-bakes, I tried a new recipe that I found. I let the veggies marinate in italian dressing for a while then I completed the dish as usual. It was amazing. I also used many fresh veggies. In the past I used frozen, but yesterday I used mostly fresh squash, zucchini, onion, cabbage, broccoli and carrots. Then I added frozen cauliflower and strir-fry veggies.   A friend came over for lunch and we chatted for about an hour. Then I did my laundry BY MYSELF. My relationship with the woman who gave me birth is on the rocks, so I am being forced to do it. I can't remember the last time I did my own laundry....but it was fun. Then I washed my car-which was well needed. By the time I was done with all of that, I played basketball at 7, as usual. I can't believe how much energy I had. We had to play full court 4 on 4 (basketball requires 5 on 5). Anyway, I expected to be tired since we were short 2 players, but I played so good. I couldn't believe that I sprinted up and down the court for 2 hours straight and wasn't even tired. That let me know that I am in good shape. I scored over 12 points each game, and the games were to 20.   After I played bball, I permed my hair-finally. OH MY GOODNESS!!!! It is soooo long. But, the flip is back. I had to get rid of the curliness. If I had worn it any longer, people would start mistaking me for Rick James or Michael Jackson in the 80's. Whew-a perm was well needed. It turned out really good. It looks cute, but it is getting too long to flip. I need to get it cut, but I dont foresee myself having time to do that anytime soon. After I permed my hair, I turned my phone off and went to bed.   This morning I woke up a 5 and played bball again. It was fun. Then I took a shower, had the breakfast of champions (banana and OJ) and came to school. Here I am searching the net for an armoire. My TV is too big for an entertainment center and I am sick of the current setup. Oh well, I hope eBay can help out.  My neck is breaking out with a rash, I have eczema and this is the time of year for the breakout. I need to reorder my medicine. Maybe I'll do that today.  I feel refreshed. Friday and Saturday weren't that great. But Sunday I spent alot of time thinking and focusing on me and my well-being. Today I feel good and new. I am having some regrets though. Saturday, I told "S" that I wasn't attracted to her anymore. At that time, I was going through alot and I didn't think I was attracted to her. But I really need to be honest with myself and not let my ego get in the way of me being real. I am still attracted to her, whether I want to be or not. Honestly, I don't want to be. I don't need to be, but I am. That is kind of tough sometimes, but it is just how I feel about her. I am still amazed by her beauty as much as I was when I first saw her. Whenever I am mad or frustrated, I lose attraction to others, but I quickly snap back into reality after my frustrations are gone.   Well, I am off for now Later

      I am sure that it is no surprise that I am in a bad mood today. This mood is recurring for some reason. Surprisingly, I actually woke up in a great mood, though. I woje up at 5am, played bball till 7, took a shower and made it to work by 8. Then at about 9 my mood changed. I gues much of it is to blame on me and my misinterpretation of others and their actions. Last night I was talking to "S" on the phone....at the end she said "call me at let me know if you get a lunch break". To me, this means "let's do lunch if you have time". ANyway, long story short, I analyzed my schedule this morning, I have a free hour at noon, which is the usual lunch hour. So I call "S" to tell her that I am free and to invite her to lunch at my house because I made this wonderful dinner last night, but didn't get to eat it b/c I went to dinner elsewhere instead. Well-imagine this- "S" doesn't want to come. Great. I got mad about it-maybe I shouldn't have. But I hate getting my hopes up or even taking the time to think about doing something that won't happen. I hate it. I think it is unfair and inconsiderate to be honest. Oh well. I guess that just says something about me and how I try too hard to have friendships. I need to go back to the Mykie that no one hears from for months on months. I think I will. Just when I thought I had at least one friend that really enjoyed me as much as I enjoy them....reality kicks in. Ugh!!!!  I have a toothache again, I am sleepy (didn't get to sleep til 3 and woke up at 5), mad, sad (one of my clients died yesterday-she was only in her 40's)and irritated.   I had 2 arguments last night. One with my mother. She has just been able to piss me off more than anything right now. When I get mad I can't control my words....so I forget that she is my mother (a role that she recently decided to take on) and I flip out on her like she is a nobody. Last night I asked her to stop talking to me. She kept talking while I was trying to talk. She wouldn't let me talk. I got frustrated and asked her to shut the fuck up. At least I added please to it. Well, after I got off the phone with her I regretted the fact that I had just told my mother to shut the fuck up. Then I realized that my client who died was around my mom's age. What if something were to unexpectedly happen to her? SO I called back and apologized. But, I am still mad at myself for doing it and I am still mad at her for not letting me talk or finish my sentences.   My ex showed up at my house a little after I got off the phone with my mom (midnight or so). She was wasted and I don't know how she drove to my house without having a collision, but she made it. Oh well. I was so mad at my mom and I really needed to talk to someone, so I tried to talk to her. NEVER TRY TO TALK TO A DRUNK PERSON IF YOU ARE SOBER. It is frustrating, to say the least.We ended up arguing. I told her that she needs to really go see someone for her problems and that having sex with me isn't going to make her feel any better about the situation. She seems to be convinced otherwise for some reason.   I'm off for now.

      I finally have time to breathe. What a day. I am so tired right now. I had a long night last night and an even longer day today. I have been on the go-non-stop all day long. I didn't even have time to take a lunch break!!!! Oh well. I guess that is part of having a real job. Anyway, I am in a bad mood today. I think I have mentioned in other blogs that I have a tendency to let small things get to me. Well, for some reason, I have been thinking about the economy all day. I have made the determination that we have an unbalanced economy and it is unfair and contributing to the detriment of our working class people. I paid $8.50 for a movie ticket Tuesday, I have been paying close to 40 bucks each time I fill up my gas tank,and my grocery bill has increased by a few bucks-I buy the same items over and over again....why has it increased? So I did an analysis of our economy. The prices are of necessities are increasing, the prices for leisure activities are increasing....but wage earnings and yearly salaries remain the same. I think this is really unfair to all of us who are attempting to live honest and productive lives. What about the people who are on welfare and live below the poverty line? What about the disabled people who earn no more than $500 bucks per month? Does our society/economy not realize that these people do exist and make up a large part of our world? How is a welfare mom supposed to go job hunting if gas is 2 bucks per gallon and she gets 500 per month? How is a clinically depressed person supposed to participate in community leisure activities if a simple movie ticket is $8.50 and they receive $500 per month for rent, food, and personal items? This constant problem is going to be the blame of much crime that will occur. People are going to have to STEAL gas because they won't be able to afford it. This makes me so very angry. We are in what I am labeling an economical crisis. I don't claim to be an economist, but I have common sense and I look at things from a logical perspective. Many aspects of our lives, not just financial, will be negatively affected as a result of this crisis. UGH!!!! I am still bothered.  Anyway, I am off work. I am going to go to Wal-Mart and spend a million bucks on peanut butter and vegetables for my weekly calorie intake also known as food. Then, I guess I will go run and play Nintendo....nothing else to do.  Chow for now.

      I have come to the conclusion that I need to get my wisdom teeth pulled. They hurt like HELL!!!! Actually, they just came in a few months ago. It seems that about twice a day I go through a period of excruciating pain with them. I hate it. I have insurance, but it only covers MEDICAL expenses. Imagine that. I need to figure out how much it will cost to get rid of these evil teeth. Oh well. We'll see.

      Well I just got to work....it's not my fault though. I woke up this morning and I couldn't move my neck. I was in so much pain that I even cried. This has happened a couple of time before and I really need to figure it out.   Anyway, I went to the movies with the Brooke's last night. It was originally supposed to be me and Brooke #1, but Brooke#2 was having boy trouble and needed to vent, so she met us in the city. We saw Mean Girls. It was ok. Definitely a "chick flick". I wouldn't recommend anyone to go to theater and see it, but renting it would be ok.The entire way to and from the movies, Brooke wanted to talk about my life. I guess she realizes that something is wrong,so she wanted to discuss it the entire way-I didn't. I wasn't in the mood for my life. I wasn't in the mood to discuss the shit that I can't believe I have been doing and putting up with. But, Brooke is a Master level Psychologist and very close to completing her second Masters and a EdS degree. So I talked to her so that she would quit harrassing me. She gave some good feedback, but I am not sure that I wanted to hear it. So I was quiet for a long time in the car and finally said "Brooke, I really don't want to talk about it". It made her sad because she thought I was being a bitch. I wasn't. I was just trying not to focus on my bullshit life right then.  So, I got back from the movies at 10:30. I was not ready for bed. I have never been to bed before 2 on a Tuesday night. I couldn't believe that I was already home. I didn't know what to do because I realized that I had not been in this situation in a long time. So I decided to call my mother and talk to her for a while. She is really talkative and sometimes our phone conversations tire me. So I decided to use her to try to make me sleepy. It didn't work. She didn't talk long enough. After I got off the phone I worked on my novel and wrote a poem. Right when I started feeling sleepy, my phone rings. I look at the clock....2:45. It's "K" crying asking if she could come over. I asked why she was crying and she said "I love you Mykie, no matter how much I try not to, I do". I didn't know what to do or say. Suddenly a tear fell from my eye too. I really didn't know how to approach it, but the words that came out of her mouth felt so real and so honest. It touched me, for awhile. So we sat there on the phone in silence for a few minutes....I couldn't say it back to her. I don't know whether to be happy or sad about it, but I couldn't say it back. Suddenly, a feeling of coldness took over my body and I let it all loose. I flipped the script on her-which I have been doing alot of lately by the way. I told her how I really feel about EVERYTHING!!!! I have been really honest lately with EVERYONE and she was going to be no exception. I had to let it all out. So she hung up. Next thing I know I hear a knock at my door. WHo is it other than "K". I let her come in, by this time its 345 or so. SHe doesn't say anything she just walks in and sits on my couch. She goes on to talk about her depression and how miserable she is without me....blah blah blah. Technically she has been without me for months. She should have adapted to my absence by now. I refused to fall in to the trap. She wouldn't leave so I went to bed and she crawled in with me. I gave her an invisible line that she was not allowed to cross in the center of my bed. We fell asleep until 6 and she left. I feel like I have conquered her without drama. I don't know what she was expecting when she came over, but she didn't get it. I was calm and nice to her. I feel like she realizes, finally that it can't be. I hope so. Anyway, I am off for now.

      I am sure that it is no surprise that I am obsessive compulsive. In fact, I am obsessive compulsive in most aspects of my life. Because I am OCD, I don't deal with disorganization well AT ALL!!!! It may sound weird to some, but disorganization really makes me nervous. I can't stand it when things don't go as planned. It really gets to me. Long story short, for 3 months, I have been planning on going to this quarterly meeting that was SUPPOSED to happen today. I got all dressed up in my cute little girly clothes only to discover that the meeting was cancelled until next week. I was pissed. First of all, I rescheduled all of my Tueday clients so that I could make it to the meeting....not its cancelled. Now, I will have to reschedule the same clients AGAIN since it is next week instead. This means that I won't see my Tuesday clients for 2 weeks. What if one of tehm really needs to see me? What a pain in the ass!!!! I HATE IT!!!! Here I am with nothing to do until 4pm.  I went to lunch with "S". It was a good time. She always makes me laugh. She is by far the funniest, most dorky person I know this week. No matter what type of mood I am in, she always manages to bring a smile to my face.   Brooke called and wants to go to the movies tonight. I am glad. I guess she knows that I am dealing with alot of stuff and she is trying her best to make it better. I appreciate it alot. I am also glad that we aren't doing the usual tonight, I need a break from it. The thing about Brooke is, I can't really tell what is up with her. Sometimes, she is really flirty and curious, then sometimes she is really HETEROSEXUAL acting. I can't explain it. Saturday night, she was all over me and she wasn't even drunk.So, I am assuming that tonight is designed to get me away from the drama that is ongoing.   I am mad at myself again-imagine that. I can't believe that I let my drama with "K" interefere with my relationship with "S". It sucks because "K" still has somebody in the end....I don't. It just makes me a little angry because I really liked being with "S" and I am trying to figure out how and why I let an outsider ruin it. I wish I could go back and do it all over. Oh well.  I am off for now.

      I woke up in a weird mood this morning. Part of me feels mad at myself for flipping out on someone that I care so much for last night. I have allowed my personal life incidents to cause bitterness in my overall attitude, thus creating negativity in every interaction that I have with human beings. Most of it is to blame on me. I can't control my bitterness and it often lets loose on the least deserving people. The people who deserve from me get only silence and non-recognition. Why can't I take my frustrations out on them.   Though this is a journal, I want to take time out to apologize to "S" for flipping out last night. I love you dearly and I really want things to be ok with us. I am going through alot. You know exactly what I am going through with "K" and I am glad that you are there to listen. However, you don't deserve to be the recipient of my anger. I am sorry. I really am. I hope that my sudden anger explosion didn't create any problems with us. I am on a "I hate people" mission, but you are one person that I know that I love and I know that you care for me. I wouldn't want to risk that. I apologize from way deep down inside. Please forgive me.  Well, I am on the go.

      I think it is fair to say that I was born into socialism. From the time I was born I have been surrounded by wide varieties of people and I have been exposed to the social life for 23 years. My parents were socialites before I came into the world. My dad was the class clown of his high school, and my mom was by far the prettiest girl in her high school. Everyone knew them for their open-heartedness and for being outgoing.  I say that I was born into socialism because I was primarily raised by my paternal grandparents. My Grandma retired from the Board of Education, had a foster home in her own home(where she fostered over 23 foster kids throughout her career), she owned our neighborhood candy store, she was the neighborhood counselor and every kid in the neighborhood called her Grandma. She was a socialist. She believed that people make the world go around, and she did all that she could to help the world be a better place. She felt that socialism was the avenue to better the world, or at least our community. My Grandpa wasn't as social as grandma, but he enjoyed people. He had retired from Wells Fargo, and everyone knew him for his hard work and promptness. He was never late to work, and he worked there for over 30 years. So, these were the people who raised me. There was never a dull moment in my childhood. My grandma always hosted card parties and Friday Night Fish Fries. People were always around. The store we owned was always busy. It was only a candy and pop store, but we encountered everyone in the neighborhood-old or young- at some point.   I was an "attention-getter" from the time I entered school. Alot of it had to do with my last name. Everyone in the city knew the DeGraftenreed family. My teachers admired my Grandma-even if they had never met her. They knew that she had retired from the Board and was a foster parent. I also drew attention because I was a little chocolate girl with naturally curly hair. Many of my teachers loved to play with my hair and tell me that I was adorable. In about the 3rd grade, my grandma started realizing that I wasn't the average kid. I was smarter than the rest. I would rather read the dictionary than Dr. Seuss. I would rather watch the news than watch the Smurfs. So, because my Grandma had so much power in education, I was allowed to take a test to measure my intelligence. I was immediately moved to a fourth grade class. Now everyone knew me because I was smart. People always wanted to be around me.  I began to embrace socialism in high school. I was glad that people knew me and liked me-but I no longer wanted them to like me based on who my family was. I played sports all through high school. I was voted in unanimously as the KCK Scholar Athlete. I held a high GPA and averaged 20 points per game, so I was voted in. My senior year, I was nominated Homecoming Queen by all of my classmates.  In college, I was nominated Homecoming Queen as well. I made many new friends and people were attracted to my personality and sense of humor.   I feel that now, I have lost my socialism. No one seems to care about anything that goes on in my world. To a non-socialist, this wouldn't matter. But the fact that I have been surrounded by people my entire life and now I feel isolated....is sorta traumatizing to say the least. I woke up this morning and I hated life. I hated all of my friends ( or so-called ones). I couldn't name one friend that I loved completely or even gave a shit about. Yesterday I didn't feel this way, but today I do. This lack of socialism and the feeling of unwantedness is slowly killing me inside. I hate it.

      I am sooo glad that it is Friday. Work is busy today. I see 3 of my most difficult clients today. I hope it goes well. I really have no plans today. I get off at 3 or 4, then I guess I will go home and relax...nothing else to do.   I got a good night's sleep last night. I woke up in the middle of the night for about an hour, but other than that, it was a good night.  Since there is nothing new here, I'll sign off for now.

      Not much going on here. Though I love the rain, it is slowing my day down and sorta interfering with my motivation to be at work today.   I got a good night's sleep last night. Went to bed at 10, woke up at 7. I feel well rested today.  I had dinner with "S" last night and watched American Idol. It was a good time, though I am pissed that America voted LaToya London off.   I took the LONGEST shower this morning. I was sorta in a daze, so I just sttod there in the shower for a long time staring at the shower walls. There was definitely something on my mind, but I am not sure what it was. Anyway, I was in the shower from 7am-7:45am....so my mind was definitely occupied for some reason. I think it is because I had a bad dream last night. I'd rather not get into detail about it, but it involved my siblings. It was a fucked up dream and I am glad that it was just a dream.  After reading "S's" blog today, I wonder if any of it pertained to my friendship with her. I don't like to jump to conclusions, but the blog wasn't really clear enough for me to know for sure. Oh well. I hope all is well with us. I still consider her to be a good friend. I still love her. We'll see.  Well I am off for now.

      My professor just emailed me my grade from Human Resources Management....I got an A-. She said that I missed 5to 7 participation points when I went on vacation....if I hadn't gone on vacation, I would have received a regular A. Oh well. I am glad that it is over. My next class starts next Monday and I am not looking forward to it. (Employee motivation and compensation).   Last night was fun. It was really laid back. Went to the MEZ and had one margarita, then went to the Lynx and chatted with a few friends. I was in bed by a decent hour.  I feel good today. I ran 4 miles this morning. I could have gone further, but I had to make it to work by 8. I think I will run a few more when I get off if its not raining.   I get off at 330 today. I am excited about that. I really don't have anything to do but relax. I can't wait!!!!  Well, I am off to figure out some lunch plans.  I will return later

      My toothache went away. I hope it stays that way. I have decided that I am going to the MEZ tonight, but only for one margarita. I am going as soon as I get off. The only reason that I am going is I talked to Brooke and Brooke and they both said that they want to see me since we really haven't done our usual since I went on vacation. It kinda made me happy because I was really at a point where I felt like I had no friends. So, we are gonna do that after I get off. We said we won't be there long....we'll see.  I need to perm my hair soon. I am sick of the curly look, ready for the flippy look again. Maybe I'll do that sometime this week.   Well, I am off to work AGAIN.

      What a busy day!!!! I have been on the go constantly for the last couple of hours, I am in a good mood though. I think my depression was temporary, at least I am hoping so. I did alot of thinking last night and today, and I have finally accepted every situation in my life as it is. I didn't go to bed til 330am and still woke up at 7 to get ready for work. My body isn't tired and I feel really good about everything in my life-today.   I lost weight, unintentionally. I took a client to the gym, so I decided to weigh myself.....whoa. I lost 5 pounds since last week when I came back from vacation. I really haven't tried to lose, I think it came as a result of stress and worrying all the time. NO MORE of that. To be honest. I can't afford to lose too much more weight, except in my breasts-which is where I am failing to lose weight at!!!!   I feel like I am back to my old self again.I have re-developed my famous "I don't give a fuck about shit but me" attitude. That is the way I have always been. Why was I so stressed out? I really have no worries. I have no kids, no companion, no responsibilities other than myself. I am responsible for making sure my priorities are in place, paying my bills, and making ME happy. I am satisfied with all of those areas. I have a perfect life, for the most part.  Sure, I'd love to have someone to spend time with....but I refuse to push myself any further than I already have. It's not me and I can't see myself doing that anymore. I will just wait until someone finds me. I have options now, but I am trying to weight them out because honestly, I don't think that any of the people who are after me are right for me....but I could be wrong.  I work til 7 tonight. Kinda sucks. I really have no plans after that. It's margarita night at the MEZ tonight. I don't think I will be in attendance though. Not really in the mood for A and her ongoing love stories with L....  I have somewhat of a toothache in one area of my mouth. It is weird because it came all of a sudden and it hurts like hell! I think I need to go to the dentist and get a root canal.  I am sick of typing....

      I am on my last break from class, so I figured I would devote 15 minutes to blog. I am so ready to get out of here (we don't get out til 10pm and it is only 730). I have to work all day tomorrow. I will be on the go all day. I have 2 new clients on my caseload, so I will be busy. I need another vacation, believe it or not! This next vacation needs to be alone, though. I need time to think.   I am in what my late Grandma Opal would call a "catch 22". I feel so stupid right now. Why do I have to turn every encounter with "S" into a flirt session? I guess it shouldn't be that way. We were friends before anything ever happened between us, why can' I just go back to that mindset? I have to because I still want her as a friend. It seems that when we are holding a regular conversation, I change its focus to something inappropriate. It has to stop because obviously she isn't on the same page as I am, anymore.   I was thinking today about how much I really miss my grandma. It kills me everytime I think about her death. It was so sudden and unexpected. She hadn't been sick in years, then all of a sudden she dies. It makes me cherish every moment I have with loved ones even more. Just thinking about it angers me though. Why her?  Well I am off to class again

      Whew!!!! SAme shit; different day. I am at school finishing off my final paper for Human Resources Management. I can't wait until its over. I hate it so bad. It is just so elementary. All of the course's content is comon sense. Thank goodness today is the last day for it.  I played dawn ball this morning-as I do on most Monday, Wednesday and Friday mornings. Its where I get together with a group of guys that live in the local community and play basketball from 530am til 7am. It is alot of fun and good exercise. It is kinda tough waking up so early, but its a great way to start the day.   Today I am registering for a festival for WOMEN only in KC. It's basically a retreat for women. It's September 16-19 in KC. I can't wait. It's called the "Gaea Goddess Gathering". Should be interesting. I am also registering for the Gaea Goddess Open House on July 10th from noon-4 in KC at the Sacred Earth Arts Center. At the open house I will learn more about the festival-the festival is for women only and run by women only. I am so excited. For any of my feminist friends.........if you are interested, the site is www.gaeagoddessgathering.com   Tootsies was so much fun Saturday night. It was out of control. I didn't get home til 6am or later. I had a blast. It was one of the best nights of my life. I felt that I didn't have a worry in the world, and my depression was non-existant. I met some really cool people too. I can't wait til Gay Pride week. The first weekend in June is going to be a great big gay pride celebration and Tootsies is having a big party. I can't wait!!!! I am already picking out my attire for that night. There's gonna be a parade and lots of partying. So, the only thing on my mind right now is the women's festival and the Gay Pride celebration.   That's all for now.

      So lately, there have been lots of people telling me that they love me....needless to say, I don't really feel the love. I wrote this poem some time ago. Maybe it can offer some clarity to my confusion about love.  Is love a word, or an action? Is it for pleasure, or satisfaction? Is love deep,like a river or a stream? Or, is love just a dream? Can love be defined in a dictionary of words? Can love be seen, and can it be heard? If the weather was cold, would love freeze? Or, would it melt in 100 degrees? Love is an expression that has to be shown. And the qualities of love will forever be known.

      From now on, I am going to finally take all of my late Grandma Opal's wisdom and insights into consideration. She always said: People ALWAYS know inside what is best for them; but they don't ALWAYS do what is best for them. After going through this depression, I can really understand what she was saying. I do know what is best for me and my life, but lately, I have failed to make the right choices, knowing that they aren't the best for me. My grandma also always made it clear in all of her advice-giving sessions that: Self perservation is the first law of nature. She said this repeatedly. I get so caught up in my career, schooling, and friendships that I forget about the most important thing-my own well-being. I have got to focus more on me and my goals in life.  Last night was out of control. I talked to "S" on the phone for a while and it was cool-in the middle of me talking to her, I get a call from a high-school friend of mine from KC saying that he is wasted and is driving around in Baldwin. He couldn't find his way to the interstate. Well, Baldwin is 10 miles from where I live, so I got out of bed and went to get him. Little did I know that he was not only intoxicated with alcohol, he had been doing coke, too. It made me sad for many reasons. First, he endangered his life and his passengers' lives, he also endangered innocent road travelers' lives. Second, he is in the professional world. He makes like 50 grand a year already and he is only 23. Why would you risk that? Third, the fact that he went joyriding and ended up in Baldwin KS from Kansas City bothers me. That is like a 45 mile joyride. Why? So I took him to Lawrence to a 24 hour restaurant to sober up. I couldn't think of anything else to do because I didn't know the peple he was with and they all were HIGH and wasted. I didn't want anything to come up missing from my house. So, they sobered up by 4am, I drove them back to Baldwin to get their car and showed them to the interstate. I made it home by 445 and had to get up at 7. What a night.   I have a major absence in my life. I really do love "S". I really do miss her. There is something about her that has me hooked. I can't really explain it, though. I really just want her to be a part of my life. But I don't think that is realistic anymore. I guess I am struggling with the fact that it was realistic not long ago, but now it is just a dream. I keep saying that I am lonely-and I really am. But there is no one that I want more to spend time with than "S". The month that we were an item was one of the best months of my life. I don't know, though. Sometimes I feel that she feels the same about me, then sometimes I feel like she wants nothing to do with me in that way. I can't tell. I wish I could, or I wish she and I could really sit down and figure it out.   I am at work right now. I see 2 clients today. They are easy ones to deal with. It should be an easy day. I don't really have plans today. I get off at 1 and I have all day to do nothing. Later tonight, I am supposed to go to Tootsie's ( a gay club in KC) to celebrate the graduation of 2 of my good friends. They are graduating today from Central Missouri State University. The party should be fun. Maybe it will help me not be depressed. WHo knows????

      I just read my ex's blog for the day. I don't know how I feel. I have a hard time explaining what's on my mind to other people, primarily because they don't seem to care. As a therapist, I know for a fact that people really don't care to listen to other people's problems if they have their own. That's just the way that I perceive it.   Plain and simple: I AM LONELY. That is all there is to it. No explanation needed because the words speak for themselves. This doesn't imply that I feel that I NEED ANYONE. However I WANT somebody. There is a huge difference between NEED and WANT. I am getting kind of frustrated with my friends because they are all assuming that I feel like I NEED a companion. That is not the case, but I WANT one. I don't need them to try to boost me up. As probably evidenced, I have high self-esteem and high self-confidence already, I don't need people to try to boost me up.   I get sick of staring at the walls in my apartment hours on hours. I get sick of constantly calling the same people over and over again because I have nothing better to do. I get sick of WISHING I had somebody or something to do. I am 23 years old. I should be active and filled with liveliness; not sitting in a hot ass apartment staring at the wall wishing that I had someone next to me.  Last night I broke out in a deep sweat, my apartment was cold. I became short of breath and tears started running down my face. That is when I finally accepted it: I am depressed. Before last night, I just thought that I was a little depressed or maybe just tired. No, now I know for sure. It's easy for all of my friends to give advise....they have what they want.  "A" is married and has a thing on the side, "B#1" has a boyfriend off and on and a kid to spend time with...plus she lives at home and her parents are fun, "B#2" has a great boyfriend who is taking her to New York this weekend for no reason, "A and A" have somebodies, Beth, Brandy, and Becca have lovers.....Kristy has a live-in girlfriend, "S" has kids to spend time with......I could go on, but Me...I have a guinea pig and a nintendo. Yep, that's about it. You know, I agree with "S" that someone would be lucky to be with me. But that is not the problem. I desire to have someone right now, but no one desires to have me. "K" is the ONLY person that has showed interest in spending time with me in a long time. Problem is, she's my ex and she has someone LIVING WITH HER. How am I supposed to react to that? That's sad. The person I DUMPED and almost betrayed is the only person that wants me in her life, or wants to be with me. PATHETIC. Now I am beginning to re-evaluate my friendship with her because she has been consistent with her feelings for me. I almost feel desperate. I talked to "K" last night and it was hard for me. She kept telling me how much she loves me and would do anything to regain what we had. Even if she had to dump her lover. It made me think for awhile. I cried to her. I know that it can't be. It just can't. I can't go through the jealousy and controlling behavior anymore. So I told her. I hate to say it, but of all the times I have hurt people, I am really sad that I had to hurt her.   I am out of here for the day.   I am just gonna let things come to me. I can't continue to let this get to me.

      TGIF!!!! I am so ready for some relaxation. Work has been kind of hectic lately, but I guess I can't complain. I really do like my job most of the time. I got a raise today. I wasn't expecting it. Out of nowhere, my supervisor told me that he is happy with my productivity and that all of my clients like me, so he gave me a raise. Extra money has never hurt anyone. That made me happy.  I get off in 30 minutes. I am gonna go to Lawrence and look for some new earrings and maybe some new decor for my spare bed room. I just feel like I need to be out enjoying the nice weather. I am gonna ride around with my tops off of my car like I don't have a worry in the world. I am thinking about getting a slush from Sonic before I hit the road. It should be a good time.  I have a final Monday for Human Resources Management. Not looking forward to it. I am glad the class is almost over.   I was supposed to have a date tonight but I cancelled. I am just not in a condition to socialize. It was a blind date too. Not really into that at all. But, I am depressed and social interaction is my least favorite thing right now.   I work tomorrow, as usual, but Saturdays are never hectic for me b/c I only work 4 hours.   Well, I am off to spend some QT alone.

      My mom told me that I am the most lovable person in the world. It made me feel good for the moment. She said that I am cute and that I make people just want to hug and squeeze me all day. I felt like a toy or stuffed animal at the end of our conversation. I am glad that she thinks that way. I can't tell if she was saying it because I am depressed or because she meant it. Who really knows????  I met this girl while I was on vacation. Out of nowhere, she started talking to me. She was in the bathroom at the casino that I was at. We were washing our hands and she asked where I was from. I told her and she said that she is from St. Louis Missouri. We talked for about 20 minutes about life. It was kind of cool. She just started asking me questions because I seemed interesting to her. I felt like such a geek, though. She asked what my favorite things to do are. I said : play video games, read, play with my guinea pig, lift weights, watch ESPN and MTV, write poetry, travel, and try new healthy recipes. She thought I was the coolest person on the planet, but I felt like a dork. Maybe because I am a dork. I get excited about Mario Brothers and NBA and NFL video games. I am obsessed. Anyway, we exchanged numbers, but the encounter was so weird that I don't know whether to call or not. She can call me since she asked for my number. She said that she could look at me and tell that I HATE MEN. This is a fact. How did she know. I don't walk around with saying I hate men, I don't treat them rude and I wasn't wearing gay rights jewelry.....how did she know???? It's kinda scary. She was kind of cute in her own way. If I saw her walking past me I may have looked twice, but she was definitely nothing to write home about. We'll see.   Speaking of men. A guy that I used to mess around with in like 2000 suddenly remembers my number in 2004 and decides to call me and try to sweet talk me. He left a message the other day, and he called again today. NO WAY. What part of I hate men does he not understand. He knew I hated them when he was on the scene. The only reason I hung out with him then was because he was supposed to buy me a DVD player. Needless to say, that never happened. So I plan on emailing him to tell him once more that I am not interested in anything that is associated with the male species. We can be friends-like watch basketball together or something like that, but as far as hooking up goes.....I don't think so.

      Lets just say that I am in a pissed off mood. Why is the price of gas so extreme? $1.89!!!! Give me a freakin' break. The only weapon of mass destruction that I am familiar with is PRESIDENT BUSH. He's like a wide-spread disease that is taking over our lives. To hell with Iraqi Freedom.....where's ours. We should not have to pay so much money for gas. It is ridiculous and unnecessary. It just pisses me off when I go to fill up my tank and my total is 30 bucks, for basically a 2-seater car. UGH.  Okay now that I have that off my chest I can blog about other things. I saw a bumper sticker that said "Sometimes I don't know what I think until I hear what I say"....I started thinking and that is so true, at least with me (lately). I thought it was kinda cool. Sometimes I say things, and I don't realize what I am saying until it is verbalized.   I am planning my annual "Spring Cleaning" for my apartment. It's actually almost summer though. Anyway, its when I load all of my favorite CD's in my CD changer and let them play loud while I go through every room in my house and thoroughly clean each part. I alphabetize my hanging clothes, books and fragrances.Yes, I am obsessive compulsive. I make mixed drinks for myself while I am cleaning and by the end of the excursion, my house is spotless and I am in a good mood. It really works. I don't answer my phone or even my door during the cleaning time. It's just time for ME to focus on my life and my involvements. I make alot of decisions during this particular time. Last year, I decided that I was going to go directly to grad school after undergrad, so I did. This year, I know that my love life will be the center of my decision making process. Wish me luck.   Today is a pretty day. I took a client to the park today. We just sat there in pure silence for 30 minutes admiring nature's beauty. I felt refreshed when we left. We both looked as if we had things on our minds. We didn't even have to speak to each other the entire time to know that this was the right place for both of us at the time. Because it would have been unprofessional, I couldn't tell her what was on my mind, but it is my job to hear what was on her mind and to advise her on it....but we never spoke. So, in a way, I felt unproductive, like I didn't do my job. But, in a way, I felt that she had her issues under control, I just needed to worry about mine. Here I am attempting to help people through problems in a therapeutic manner, when I can't even help ME. In that 30 minute span, about 30 things ran through my head.......breast reduction-should I get reduced to a B or C?......Relationships- should I try harder or stay miserable? Family-should I let their issues affect my life? School-should I write my paper tonight, or wait until I feel like it, which could be the last minute? Work-why am I in this field right now? I am probably worse off than many of my clients. Attitude-should I stop being such a bitch to people, or should I be a little more down to earth? My own mother called me bitchy, so I am assuming that other people think the same thing. Dinner-should I eat pasta or something lighter? UGH.....I had a headache when I left the park. But I was relaxed.  I think I am mildly depressed. I don't know why. But, lately I have been in bad moods daily. This is unlike me and I don't like to feel this way. I have to get over this depression before I become a hermit. I think I am already half-way there.  That's all for now.

      Since I have been back from vacation, I have not adjusted to the work atmosphere yet. I am glad to be back to my daily life, but there is so much to done and so little time to do it. I have decided that there are not enough hours in a day for me. I need at least 30 hours a day to do all of my involvements and still get a good night's sleep.   I have made my final decision to get a breast reduction. No matter what I have to do, I am going to get one. It will make my life alot easier, from all aspects. I don't know when that will take place, but it will happen soon.  I have a BIG paper to write by Monday. Really not looking forward to it. I am gonna hide from the world after work today and work on it from 530-10. That's the plan. Then I am going to go to bed. However, tonight is Karaoke night at Mulligan's.....I hardly ever miss it. But....I think tonight may be a different story. I need some ME time. Haven't had that in a while. Sometimes ME time is not so good because I start to realize how lonely I am. It kind of depresses me because I am the only one out of my circle of friends that doesn't have somebody. Even the ones who aren't in committed relationships at least have SOMEBODY to spend time with.....with the exception of me. Hmmmm.....kind of sad huh? Sometimes it makes me cry. Why is it that I am stuck here with no one? What have I done to deserve this? I think I am a great person. I have a good personality and a good heart. I also think I am attractive, not to be arrogant, just honest. What is it? I don't know. Hopefully I will find someone who wants to spend time with me soon.   I am on my lunch break. I think I am gonna go home and make some pasta. I plan on making enough to last for lunch today, dinner tonight and lunch tomorrow. I am not a big eater, so I really won't have to make too much. All it takes is noodles, marinara sauce, mushrooms and onion. Quick and easy.  Well, I am off to be domesticated.

      This morning I woke up in an undefined mood. I can't really tell how I feel. Maybe my mood is neutral. I can't say that I am in a good mood; but I don't think I am in a bad one either. I am trying to decide what to have for lunch today. There is so much to choose from since I am away from my small town life, and on vacation in a big city. Mr.Goodcents seems to be on the top of my list right now.....turkey on wheat....mmmmm good. Chipotle is second on the list.....veggie burrito in a bowl. Who knows. I am so indecisive that I may end up eating something totally different.  I washed my hair this morning and it is soooo curly. It's cute. I think I may keep it this way for a little while. Nothing else is new here. I am ready to sleep in my own bed again. Haven't done that since Thursday night, and that was only for a few hours.   I've been thinking alot about an ex of mine We just broke up not long ago. I happen to still have a great friendship with this person, but I don't know if it's enough for me. There is so much attraction there and I just want to act on it in some kind of way. I really am having a hard time accepting the fact that its over. I miss what we had but I have got to move on. I have to, for the sake of my sanity. If I don't hear from this particular person daily, I feel empty. I shouldn't feel this way when I know that its over. I wish we could try again, but here I go being indenial and unrealistic AGAIN.  I think that I am just sick of being lonely. I want to feel wanted. I want to feel loved. Where do I search to find that? Clubs are not a good place to find a companion. They are ok if you are looking for immediate action, but not a solid relationship. I think I am a great person with alot to offer to any relationship. I just wish others could see that.   Back to my ex. I don't know what to think. It makes me sad just thinking about it. I want someone that I can share my experiences with, whether they are happy or sad. I just want someone that I can spend quality time with. I don't want marriage, or anything too serious, but I want someone to spend my time with.   Well, that's all for now.

      I'm back in the blogger atmosphere. This is terrible because I am on vacation and quite a distance from home.....but I have nothing better to do.   I am reading Hilary Clinton's book (Living History). It's a really good book and it really lets us outsiders in on who Hilary really is. Too often, we get caught up in what the magazines and newcasters tell us about famous people, and we let their perceptions make our judgments. Hilary is a powerful woman who has seen and done alot in many different aspects. She's a rebel. That's why I love her. She is my second favorite famous female, next to Oprah Winfrey. I recommend Hilary's book to anyone who is interested in women's empowerment.   I think that Oprah and Hilary demonstrate power. They spell power. Even though we continue to live in a society that does not value powerful, intelligent women, they truly are what the world needs. If Hilary ran for office I would be the first person to vote for her, without a question. She is still holding it together-even after all of the turmoil she experienced not only as a First Lady, but as a First Lady who was betrayed!!!! She has been put down in magazines and in the news....and she is still working hard to help the less fortunate and minorities. After reading most of her book, I can see that Hilary has a heart. She is truly an activist for HUMAN RIGHTS AND EQUALITY, regardless of race, gender, ethnicity or sexual preference. She loves us all. HILARY CLINTON FOR PRESIDENT (someday).   I love Oprah because she is a double -minority and she still reigns. People of all races and genders praise Oprah. She is so caring and loving. Her show is the real deal. It's no phony talk show, like Jerry Springer or Ricki Lake. Oprah reveals real life issues and attempts to publicize them in a way that will contribute to the betterment of our world. While Ricki is focusing on "You're too fat to wear that", Oprah is focusing on ways to help people who have eating disorders, or who are overweight and have a difficult time in today's cruel world. She's like an advocate for life in fancy clothes and with millions of fans.

      Today is my very first day posting my feelings (publicly) on the Web. I think blogger.com is a great site.   What is going on today? Let's see....well, I am sitting here thinking of a conversation that I had with one of my uncles last week. He's a pastor, but he is also a male-cheauvanist...I am a feminist, so I am sure you can imagine what our conversations are like. Luckily this one was over the phone. He is also very controlling. He wants everyone to think like he does and have the same ideas or perceptions as he does. So, this particular conversation was about the military, war in particular. I am strongly opposed to war. That's just the way I feel, I always have. He thinks it is a good thing for our country. Anyway, he said "you should be thankful for the military because they defend our WOMEN and children." I got soooo mad. As if there aren't WOMEN in the military. As if the military is not designed to defend MEN...ugh. What about "the military defends our COUNTRY-" Defense is not gender specific-at least not to my knowledge. Anyway, that is what's on my mind right now-even though it happened last week. I guess I need to learn to let things go.  What else....I am thinking about buying a new computer b/c the one I have is old and keeps freezing up. Maybe I'll put one on lay-away....I dunno. Just a thought.   I am kind of mad that my GPA is 3.8. Grad school is tough, but the only class that I made a B in happened to be the easiest class I have taken since my freshman year of undergrad. I think the teacher was inexperienced and sexist!!!! Most of the men in the class made A's, only 2 of the 15 women made A's. I dunno. I think I deserved an A.  More later. Me

      For some undefined reason, I find intimate connections and relationships between women to be beautiful, almost like art. The beauty lies within the synonymousness that can also be incongruent at times. The beauty lies within the intuition that they share and the relation of their being. The true beauty lies within their bodies, alike in formation; yet so different to the opposite's eye. The beauty lies within them touching, holding hands, kissing lips and being able to love and be loved. The beauty lies within each of the women for being brave enough to be honest with her feelings and being able to love the other and challenge society's normal standards. It is truly beautiful to me and if ever I am to love again, I want it to be beautiful. Love is only beautiful when it is without expectations and standards, when it is free; therefore, love with another woman is the only true love for me.  I fell DEEPLY in love with another woman once. It was truly a beautiful connection. My life was lightened and I felt like I had never had a worry in my life. We were in love and nothing else mattered. We walked through our daily lives with thoughts of the other on our minds consistently, and when we were in the presence of one another we cherished each moment. Our conversations were endless, and filled with excitement and great discussions. Our kisses were sweet, soft, gentle and intimate. And when we made love, our bodies connected together like puzzle pieces and didn't want to separate once the love making had come to a halt. Our sweaty bodies connected, our hands locked together and our eyes gazed at the other in silence. Tears ran down each of our cheeks at the same speed, with the same movement. Our heart beats went bump bump bump at the the exact same speed for the exact same reason. Us.   My most fond memory of me and my only true love was toward the end of a great spring. The season was preparing to change to summer at the same times our hearts and minds were preparing to, once again, connect. We walked to the end of a grassy area that was surrounded by trees, with the wind blowing our hair strands at the same time. We found a grass hill that was surrounded by trees, silence and the sounds of nighttime. We layed on a powder blue blanket, arm in arm, hand in hand. Our lips touched as mother nature decided to cry. Maybe she saw the beauty of our connection, too. As the sprinkles came down from mother nature's eyes, the stronger we embraced one another and braided our tongues together. Our breaths, deep, and at the same exact pace as the other's. The sounds of thunder storms as vivid as the bump bump bumps of our heartbeats. We proceeded to make love under the thunderstorm with Mother Nature as a witness to our intense love together. We rolled off the blanket into the wet grass and oddly the love making felt more natural. The grass felt like silk to my back as the woman I loved kissed my inner thigh while I moaned and groaned. As the rain began to pour more intensely, the muddier our love making became. This was literally the dirtiest sexual encounter I've ever had; yet it was the best. As we rolled over in the mud, my lips traveled up and down her body while I kissed her from head to toe. Our bare naked bodies covered in rain, grass and mud, were beautiful as we layed there admiring the other, her womaness, her beauty.  I write about this today because my heart aches. I have never loved another so deep and intense, and no one has ever loved me the same way as my ex-partner that I wrote about above. I was watching MTV today and there was a special on Gay Marriage. I just wish people would understand that love is amazing and beautiful, but true love is a rarity. I wish I could have shared my experience with the world. I wish MTV would have interviewed me and I would have told them the exact same thing that I wrote about above. I miss being in love and being loved back.

      Today is the first day of summer. Most people would be happy about it....But not me. Summer is definitely my least favorite season. My eczema gets outta control in summer, plus I hate being too hot.   I am at school. I am dressed up today because I have a final presentation. I think I look purrty damn cute....but I am a bit uncomfortable because I have to stay this way at least til 11 tonight. I hope this presentation goes well. I love powerpoint, so it shouldn't be a big deal. The thing that sucks is the fact that it has to be 20 minutes. I don't want to stand in front of a classroom full of people and talk about motivation for 20 minutes. Oh well.  This weekend was good. I worked everyday, but I still found time to enjoy it. As I mentioned in my last blog, I am living everyday like it is my last. I am doing things that make me happy, whether they are consequential or not. Friday I hung out with the fam. It was a great bonding process. I tought my mom how to play pool.(I am not good at it, but I know the rules and the basics....and I am getting a little better). It was funny to see her trying to hold the stick....she had no clue. We had dinner at Fric and Frac in Westport. It was really good. The crowd there is fun. It is mostly gays and lesbians who go there and it is really an exciting atmosphere. Friday night made me appreciate my mother even more. The fact that she is so accepting of my lifestyle and even likes to hang out with me makes me even more appreciative. She is supportive of my decisions, whether she agrees with them or not.   Saturday was awesome. I worked at both jobs til 10, then I went to Topeka to visit "Kels". It was a great time. We went to a few bars. We stayed out til 3 and ended up talking until 5 in the morning. (I had to be at the ORC at 630am....so I didn't sleep at all, and I was hung over at work). Sunday I met "Kels" in Lawrence for dinner. It was great. We ate Chili's and walked down Mass Street. I promised myself I wasn't gonna buy anything. It was so hard, but I stuck to it.  Sunday night I played bball as usual. I played really well and I feel like I am in  really good shape. I scored 17 points and had 8 rebounds. When I play so well against men who underestimate women athletes, I feel like I am making a statement for all women. I love it. After bball, I went over LaShawn's and we had a heart to heart. Things have been good in our friendship lately. We talked about so many things and it felt great. It really feels good to know that I do have at least one male in my life that understands my perceptions and accepts them. He really understands feminism and strangely, he can relate. He is a good friend, even though he is a cheater. My friendship with him has nothing to do with his personal life. I just have to remember that. After our heart to heart, we did some cyclones. Whoa!!!! That is all I can say about that. I am glad that I made it home safely.  Today I feel ok. I am a little tired, but I'll live. I am in the process of finishing off a paper.  Well, that is all for now.

      I guess I am back to the routine. I'm at the MHC and as soon as I get off here, I go to the ORC until 11 tonight. Not looking forward to it at all-but I gotta do what I gotta do.  Last night was a good time. Me, my sister and my mom went to dinner and we hung out at Westport after that. Everybody thought we were all sisters....so either I look 45 or my mom looks 23????  My sister told me that I was too psychoanalytic. This could be a good thing and a bad thing. I need to know what is going on in every aspect that surrounds my life. I need to know every detail because it involves me. I like everything to be out in the open so there are no uncertainties or surprises. That is the way I have always been. It could be why I am a good student, too. I thoroughly dissect anything that is thrown at me-whether it is an assignment or a conversation with a friend. It's just me.  Let's see. Nothing new here. I really think things are well in my life. I am living everyday like there is no tomorrow. I have to because life is so unpredictable. I think I appreciate life so much and I want to live every day to the fullest-from sun up to sun down. My late Grandma Opal used to tell me to live everyday as if it is going to be my last. I am really taking her advice into consideration and my life is so much more at ease when I live it this way.   I talked on the phone with a new "friend" last night for hours and I think I got too psychoanalytic on her. I hope I didn't scare her away, but she was filled with questions and of course, I was filled with answers-but I felt the need to thoroughly explain each answer. For instance, she asked if I like macaroni and cheese b/c it is her favorite food. I said "Yep. I like it alot but I can't tell if it is a favorite or not because, you see, I love pasta and I love cheese, but the cheese (American) on mac and cheese isn't my favorite cheese (pepperjack is my favorite) and the noodles that are generally used for mac and cheese aren't my favorite noodles (mostaciolli are my favorite) but pepperjack cheese and mostaciolli noodles just doesn't sound pleasing, so I think it is all about blend. SO I can say that the blend of traditional mac and cheese is one of my favorites". I went on and on. I even got into the peanut butter and jelly conversation. Those of you who know me well know that I love pb&j and I only eat a certain kind. That took 10 more minutes to explain. SHe seemed pretty amused by it though.  Well, I am off for now.

      Compared to most days this week, today seems to be a pretty laid back day-for the most part. I don't have to go to work at the ORC, so I will have some well-needed free time on my hands after work at the MHC. I think I am gonna clean house, then go to KC to see my sister. I "accidentally" end up a Tootsie's....who knows?   Things are ok on this end. Nothing to write home about. I have been extremely busy with both jobs everyday this week. I need a break of some sort-but extra money is always good.   Well, I am off for now.  Hopefully more later

      Just when I thought today might be a good day....my fucking glasses break. Yep. Here we go again. I just got new ones a couple of months ago. I really don't know what happened this time. Last time it was my fault. I sat on them. This time, a screw fell out and then my lens fell out as I was going to grab lunch. The lens fell smack dead onto the concrete and chipped. Ugh. Now I have to sit here and type my paper in pain. It hurts to look at the screen without my glasses and my contacts are expired. Plus, I have to drive home tonight after class with no glasses. Let's just hope this goes over well.  I am suddenly in a bad mood. Right as my glasses break, my mom calls with all of these old-fashioned remedies for my eczema. I know she is just concerned and wants to be helpful, but come on. I told her my glasses just broke and she kept rambling about fucking clamine lotion and non-perfumed lotions and soaps. Duh. I have had eczema all of my life and by the age of 23, I should know what not to use. Anyway, I finally had to tell her that I will call her back later because obviously she wasn't understanding my frustrations from the glasses incident. I kind of feel bad for being so rude to her, but she just doesn't know when to stop talking sometimes.

      "The Liberal Democrats exist to build and safeguard a fair, free and open society, in which we seek to balance the fundamental values of liberty, equality and community, and in which no-one shall be enslaved by poverty, ignorance or conformity. We champion the freedom, dignity and well-being of individuals, we acknowledge and respect their right to freedom of conscience and their right to develop their talents to the full. We aim to disperse power, to foster diversity and to nurture creativity. We believe that the role of the state is to enable all citizens to attain these ideals, to contribute fully to their communities and to take part in the decisions which affect their lives."   This is the Preamble for the Liberal Democrat Party-which I claim to be. I have been having these ongoing disputes with a friend of mine who happens to be an anal Republican. She wanted to know what it meant to be a liberal democrat....so here it is. I just thought I'd post it since she claims that she visits my blog pase daily. What does it mean to be an anal republican?

      Guten Morgan!!!! I am at school-which seems to be the story of my life. I am working on my second to last paper for this boring class. It is about non-monetary rewards/recognition and team-based incentives. Yep. Pretty boring.   My weekend would have been a blast if it weren't for my eczema flaring up. I worked outside( at my 2nd job) most of the weekend and my skin is just not compatible with huimidity. So I have a gross looking rash that is about the size of Texas covering my neck and 5 mini rashes on my arms. Ugh. I am pretty gross looking today.   Let's see....Friday I worked at the ORC til 11 ish, then I went to Topeka to see a friend. Saturday, I worked both jobs. I got off at the ORC at 10 and went to Tootsie's in the middle of a freakin' storm. It was a good time though. It's always good to be around people who I have something in common with. I feel so free there. I love it. I met a few new people there. They seemed pretty cool. Anyway, I made it home at 4 am and had to be at the ORC at 6:30am. I made it and I was even 10 minutes early. I got off at 1pm, came home and slept til 5, then played bball at 7. I watched the Lakers game when I got home and they lost AGAIN. That put me in a bad mood so I turned my phone off, wrote in my journal and hit the sack.  Today seems to be an ok day. I started off playing bball at 530. Its always a good time.Got done with that at 7am-took a shower, ate breakfast....and here I am-at school. I'll be here until 10 tonight so I may as well accept it.   Oh well,  I am outtie for now.

      I'm hot, tired and I have a headache.....I guess a nap in an air conditioned spot is the only single remedy for all three of these symptoms, but it is not possible today, at least not til 11 tonight.   Nothing new here. Same shit; different day. I am a little worked up because the Lakers lost. Keep in mind that I am an avid Lakers fan-probably the biggest Laker's fan in all of the Midwest. Plain and simple-they played like shit last night. No other excuses needed. I just couldn't handle it, so I went to bed immediately after the loss.   Today has been an ok day-nothing to escribe' home about, but nothing too horrific either. I work at the ORC all weekend as well as the MHC. SO I'll be BUSY!!!! I am sure I'll be ok. I am supposed to go to Tootsie's Saturday night after work. Maybe I'll get more excited about it as it nears. But right now I am not so excited. I know I will be tired after work. Hopefully my mood will change before I go.  I played dawn ball this morning and it was awesome. It was a really good workout. It is a great way to start the day. Then I worked out at 11:15. So I have done quite a bit of intense working out today- I think the reason i felt the need to workout and be active so much today is because I won't be able to be active again until Sunday night at basketball. I can't wait. I get excited just thinking about it. The thing I love most is the good cardio that I get from it. It's approximately 3-5 miles if calculated. I love it.   Well, I am off to do some paperwork.

      It's been a LONG day!!!! Once again, I have been on the go, non-stop since 8am. I'm kinda exhausted; but I'll live. I have to work at my 2nd job tonight as well....So I won't get home til 11 or so. Then I need to work on my final paper. It's due in a week and a half and has to be 5200 words!!!! Definitely not looking forward to that.  Nothing new here. Yesterday was relaxing. I cooked myself a good dinner, took a candlelit bath and played Nintendo. Then Kelsey called (my ex that just moved back from Chicago) and we talked for about an hour. It was nice to catch up with one another and see what has been going on in our lives. Sometime next week, we are supposed to hook up. We'll see. Yesterday I was enthusiastic about it; but today I am not. That's one thing that I wish I could change about myself. I am just afraid that if we hook back up, she won't trust me completely. I can't say that I blame her, though. That's the sad thing about it.   I am thinking about getting my snatch pierced. I have always wanted to....I may as well. What's there to lose? Plus, I hear that it makes lesbian sex ten times better. I am strongly thinking about doing that. I do something crazy every summer, that will be my craziness for this summer.   I had a good lunch today. I had to take a client to Lawrence, so we ate Chipotle. It was awesome. Definitely one of my favorite spots. Veggie burrito in a bowl.....mmmmm.  My supervisor told me that I was the best conflict resolver in our organization!!!! Wow, I wish I could carry that over to my own life. I guess I am good at conflict resolution, though. I do what's best-whether it is painful or not. I encourage my client's to do the same. I have helped 10 people out of crisis in 2 weeks. That is a record at my job....So I will be getting a bonus and a plaque. I think the thing that makes me so good at conflict resolution is the fact that I see things as they are, accept them as they are, and tackle them as they are. For instance, a client of mine was in crisis, almost suicidal because she was craving meth and didn't have the resources to get it, her husband beats her and she didn't have any food in her house and doesn't get paid again until July. So she came to me with this, expecting me to do something about it-which is my job....But.... I talked to her straight up with no sugar coating. I basically told her that she knows what is best. She has to do what is best and I can't make her do any of it. If that means leave her husband, so be it. The session went on and on, and I talked to her like I would have talked to a relative or friend going through the same thing. At the end of the session, she was not suicidal/ She liked my approach and she wants to talk to me every week. Most therapists would sugar coat it or look at it to deeply. I think it's important to be as open and honest as possible.   Well, that is all for now.

      I guess it's fair to say that I am back to myself again; but I don't know who long it'll last. A friend of mine, "A", called me today to tell me that an ex of mine still wants to be with me. Go figure. I am excited, but I just don't get it. I ended it with her long ago, for immature reasons. Why is she still interested in me? Who knows. I still like her too, but I never thought about her after we ended it. She moved away and that was the end of it. Well, I guess she's coming back to the KC area and she called "A" last night to ask her if I am seeing anyone. According to "A", my ex never wanted to end it and loved being with me. What was I thinking. She's gorgeous and we clicked for the most part. Thanks to "K", I ended up leaving her for her. Whew!!!! Sounds like a Soap Opera. Anyway, I expect that she'll call in the next day or so. We'll see how things go from there.  I feel like shit today because I have done nothing related to fitness-which is rare. I didn't run because it is raining and I didn't have time to lift. Maybe I will do that when I get off....  I am outta here for now.

      Wednesdays always seem long for some reason. Maybe because Wednesday is mid-week. Good news- I don't have to go to my second job today because of the rain!!!! I am excited. Who knows what I will do with my spare time. I get off at 3:30 today and I am free all day.   Nothing new here. I have been working all day and really trying to get my office in order. These past few weeks have been so tough at work and I have been on the go non-stop. I was cleaning my office today and noticed that my wall calendar was still on May!!!! No way. It is June 9th. I bet my client's think I am the one who needs to be receiving therapy instead.   My allergies have been way out of control lately. I could barely sleep last night as a result of sneezing and having a runny nose. I plan on going to buy some Benadryl soon. It probably didn't help that I was on the phone until 2 this morning and had to wake up at 5 to shoot hoops.   Well, I am off for now.

      I'm back. Today has been a busy day, but I really have no complaints. I get off at my first job at 7 and have to go directly to my second job. I think I get off there at 10 or 11. Not much new here. The humidity is bothering my eczema, but I have been applying the cream, so it should be ok in a few days.   Brooke just got back from Vegas and she mentioned that she wants us to go there together soon. I have already been there twice (for family vacations) and it was great. Looks like I have to plan for ANOTHER trip. I love to travel, though. This year I have been to St.Louis, Chicago and Texas. I am going to South Dakota at the end of June and maybe Chicago at the end of this month. Now it looks like I have to plan for Vegas. It's kinda exciting.   I have 2 more weeks left in this boring class I am in, then I start a Computer Information Systems course for 6 weeks. It should be interesting being that technology is such a major part of our lives. I am really looking forward to it.  My life is going well, for the most part. I am satisfied with most aspects of it, with the exception of my love life-which seems to be a consistent problem. The people I have been spending my time with lately seem to be good people, but maybe not for me. One of them is my type, but she reminds me so much of an ex that I fear having interest in her. I don't know....I really have liked being by myself lately. There are times when I have wanted someone next to me, someone to hold, to kiss and to just talk to, but after awhile, I am ok. I don't want it to seem like I don't want someone, because I really do, but I think it's time for me to let them find me. I am a good person with lots of good qualities. I am a great companion and I have a good personality. I'm faithful, honest, loving, and all of that good stuff. What more can a girl ask for? So....Why am I single? I don't know, but I'll wait around until someone finds me and appreciates me.  My hair is CRAZY today. I need it cut bad. It is all over the place. It's kinda cute though. I just weighed myself and I lost 3 pounds-unintentionally. My weight fluctuates, so I won't worry too much.  I am glad to finally be out of that hot ass neck brace. Ugh. I hated it so bad and needless to say, it didn't help me out any. My fucking neck still gives me pain daily and I still pop it whenever I get an opportunity to do so.  I am off for now.

      Guess who's back in the atmosphere. My blogger absence was really starting to bother me. So....I am back. I have been a busy bee today. This is my first opportunity to have contact with the world (and that is only because my 11 o'clock appt. Stood me up). I had a great weekend. The Gay Pride Celebration was a blast. It was good to hang out with my sister,too. She is hilarious. When we go out together, we laugh non-stop. Anyway, Rebecca( the girl from STL) is nice and cute, but not my type. She is a good person and I can see us having a good friendship. Who knows?   I have been running and working out excessively lately. I always have worked out and ran, but lately I've had this burst of energy that pushes me even harder. When I am running or working out, I feel like I am in another world. I put on my Sauna suit, stick my headphones to my ears, and GO!!! It feels so good and I feel so free. While I was running yesterday, I thought about so many different things. I really sorted a lot of things out during that 4 mile excursion. While I was running, I came to the conclusion that people fail to realize that some things are just necessary. Like running, working out, eating right and living a healthy life are necessary. One of my good friends had called me a couple of days ago and asked me to be her personal trainer. She said "Mykie, how do you do it? How do you get the motivation and energy to work out? I just don't know how you do it." Until then, I never had an explanation for it. To me, it is a necessity. I can't say that I love to run. Some days I do, but some days I hate it. But I love the results that running gives me. I love the stamina. I love to sweat. So that was my reply to her questions. I have always been concerned with health. I have always focused on taking good care of my body and being in shape. She went on to ask "but don't you think running and lifting are painful" At times, they are. But my philosophy has always been "PAIN IS ONLY TEMPORARY....PRIDE IS FOREVER" You can't expect to lose weight or get stronger if you are not willing to give it your all. You have to. I am so concerned with what I put into my body. SO many things are invisibly bad for us. In addition to working out, I think it is important to know what's good and not so good for our bodies.   Things are ok with my family right now. My mom wrote me a long letter and bought me a plaque for my desk to apologize. I accepted. After many days of solitude, I have realized that I have to play with the cards that are dealt to me. I may not agree with my family's actions, and at times, they may piss me off, but I can't trade them off or throw them away. In a card game, if you are not satisfied with your hand of cards, you can't trade them for others. You just have to deal with the ones you have and make the best of it. So that is going to be my attempt.  Well, I am off for now, hopefully I will be back soon.

      Last night was a good night. Instead of partying hard, I decided to go to dinner and bowling with 2 friends from college. It was a great time. We ate dinner at the Guacomole Grille then we went bowling. After that, we went to the Cheesecake Factory to have cheesecake it was awesome. It is always good to see Josiah. He is a good person and he holds good conversations. He lives in the KC area and has a really good job in the IT field. He just bought a new Harley and he drove it to show us last night. It was awesome.   I am at work, imagine that. I have to take a client to see the new Harry Potter movie. After that, I am gonna shower and head to the city and get ready to party it up. It should be a good time. I am not nervous anymore. I am just ready to hang out and have some fun.   My allergies are killing me today. I hate it. I don't want to take my medicine because it makes me drowsy for the entire day. I guess I will have to deal with it.  Well, I out of here for now.

      This is weird. Blogger just posted a blog I typed yester-morning. I couldn't log on to the site earlier....I dunno.   Nothing new here. Same shit; different day. But all is well. I really don't have much to complain about. I have enjoyed my life for the last week. I am living off of excitement, adrenaline and nervousness. This weekend is PRIDE weekend in KC. There is a weekend long celebration at Tootsie's (my favorite spot). People from all over are coming to celebrate; and when their cities have PRIDE week, people from KC travel there (Chicago's is the end of this month-if time and money are available, my sister and I are going to fly up there to celebrate with our good friend Angie and her new girlfriend). Anyway, this weekend is a BIG deal. I am going to meet so many new people and I am so excited. PLUS....that girl that I coincidentally met in the casino bathroom while I was on vacation is coming up from Saint Louis to celebrate with me. I am excited, but nervous too. I am nervous because she is esentially a stranger. She came up to me in a bathroom and started talking to me, out of nowhere....now she is driving all the way from St.Louis to spend a few hours with me. I have to be careful...she either just really likes me, or she's crazy. We'll see. Anyway, she is driving up with her best friend and we are supposed to meet up for dinner at 7 or 8 in KC then go to Tootsie's. Thing is, if she's drinking, which I don't know if she will or not, she can't drive back to STL, I live in Ottawa (which is where I will end up after the club)....do I open my house up for her to stay at? I don't want her to think I am trying to sleep with her....but she is coming to visit ME and it is only right for me to give her the option of sleeping at my pad instead of driving back. Oh well, something to think about.  Though it hurts like hell, I am afraid that a friendship of mine has gone down the drain. It seems like it. I don't know how or why, but I am not feeling it and seemingly neither is the other party involved. Does anyone have any stategies for fixing a friendship (when you don't know why it's broken)? Oh well.  My mom is asking for some money she GAVE me back in the day. She wants $65/month until its paid. Long story short, she GAVE me the money like 4 years ago, now that she's mad at me, she wants it back. I don't know what to do......  I'm out

      Looks like the big PREZ is at it again. I firmly believe that he is to blame for much of the inflation that has been going on in our country. I really don't think he cares too much about us workin' folk who struggle to make ends meet and live paycheck to paycheck. I was watching CNN yester-noon and they said that we can expect gas prices to be at around 3 bucks per gallon at the end of summer. HA. How in the hell are we expected to afford this???? Well, I wrote a little poem for Mr. Prez and he will be receiving via mail soon.                               "Criticism for the President" Dear Mr. President, my life is in a crisis and I don't know what to do. Normally, I wouldn't complain; I would just adjust, but my problems stem from you. I would never expect a rich man like you to understand a poor girl's crisis; But how do you expect me to progress in life if I can't even afford GAS PRICES? Yes Mr. President, my life is in a crisis and I bet you have no clue So I have made the determination that our ONLY weapon of mass destruction is YOU!!!! You can't even give a straight answer when the media asks why we are at war And you plan to spend millions of dollars to send a shuttle to Mars when prices     for our necessities continue to soar. I am not being rude Mr. President, this is exactly how I feel. I really do believe that we were better off when our leader was Bill. At least soldiers didn't die every single day. At least people didn't have to fight for the right to consider themselves gay. But this is turmoil that you have created for us and it is truly unfair. One question for you Mr. President, Do you even care?

      Tonight is the finale of the Democratic National Convention in Boston. John Kerry is going to speak on his plans if he is elected as well as try to convince the nation that he is a more qualified candidate for President than Bush is. I agree. I have been following the convention quite a bit. I am really into politics. I love it. I think it is because I am so opinionated and so interested in what is going on around me.   Hillary Clinton (one of my favorite people) spoke the other night at the convention and her speech was phenomenal. She amazes me. She introduced her husband and it seemed as though his speech was elementary to hers. They should have arranged for him to go first.   I am interested to see what Kerry has in store. You know, I can't tell if he is coming up with all of these brilliant ideas that will benefit minorities just to get more votes; or if he is really trying to better our minority communites. I guess it could be a little of both. Hopefully his intentions are moral.   I am interested to see where funding will come from for his college plan. He is making a policy that will allow EVERY college student to go to an in-state college for 4 years absolutely free if they agree to work in their community for 2 years after college. Sounds good, huh? How in the hell are we going to pay for every person that is college age in America to go to college? There should be certain criteria and the thought needs to be "thunk" through more thoroughly. I can see where this can potentially contribute to the betterment of many communities, but the research needs to done deeper.  I like Kerry for the most part. I also like Edwards. They seem like really good, moral,good decision-making people. I hope they win the race.  If Bush wins-again- I fear the turmoil that our country will have to face.  Well, I am off to life weights and free my mind.

      I am so tired!!!! Most of my tiredness is to blame on an unfortunate family situation that occured last night. I had to drive to Kansas City at 230 this morning. I got back to Ottawa at 5 and I was SUPPOSED to be at work at *....I overslept and made it by 930. It is amazing how lack of sleep and rest can effect the entire body and ruin your day. I feel ike shit. I look like shit. Most of all, I am in one of the bitchiest moods I have ever been in. I am on the edge and frustrated and I will flip out on the next person who pisses me off, I'm sure. So my only remedy for this is to isolate for a while and think about all that is going on. Even though I cant do anything about it, I have to learn to seperate myself from the getting so fired up.  Well, I am off for now.

      Today seems to be a fairly decent day. I've had a good morning so far. I woke up at 5, shot hoops at 530 til 7, then I came home and showered. After that, I ate breakfast and watched the morning news. Though the news is by far my favorite thing to watch on TV, it is sometimes too damn depressing.&nbsp; I was immediately saddened to hear about the missing woman and how her husband is in a psychiatric ward. I guess police found a bloody knife with hair on it in their apartment....hmmmm why is he not a suspect yet? People just don't keep bloody hairy knives laying around for decoration. Plus, he had been living a lie for a long time. His wife and family were under the impression that he had been accepted to medical school. Come to find out, he never was accepted. Wow. Suddenly this reminds me of the Laci Peterson case.  I saw "Anchorman" yesterday. It was ok....nothin' to write home about. I had a hard time staying awake, not because it was boring, but because I am just not a movie person-no matter how hard I try to be.   After today, I have one more class left for the class that I am in. I am excited. Then, I have 4 more classes left before I graduate!!!! I can't wait.  Well, that's all for now.

      I think that I am having a hard time accepting the fact that my little brother is a menace to society, as well as to&nbsp;himself. It angers me so bad, but more than that-it hurts. He just can't seem to live an honest and productive life. He feels like he has to try to fit in with his circle of low-lifes by making the choices that they make. It seems like I am blaming his friends for his actions-which I shouldn't be....but I know that my brother was not raised like that and there is no rationalization for his behaviors. If he wasn't hanging out with drug dealers, thieves and cheaters, he wouldn't act like he does. The police busted in my late grandma's house (which is where my brother resides) because there were two STOLEN cars in the backyard!!!! No way. First of all, my brother knows better. He doesn't have to steal. He could easily ask one of his family members for anything that he needs. Why did he feel the need to steal a car???? Second, that was my grandma's house. A good Christian home where I spent much of my adolescence. To see it rampaged by police blows my mind. Third, he put many lives at risk. What if the people came looking for their car and found it and shot up the house? My brother's girlfriend has a baby....what if they would have retaliated and shot the baby? Why does he not seem to think about these things? I realize that I can't control his actions, but I am his big sister and I can't give up on him. What do I do?   Most of my day has been good with the exception of my brother's drama.   What ever happened to regular old jeans? I went shopping with the intention of purchasing a few new pairs of jeans and every pair was either low-rise or hip-hugger. I am sick of it. Every pair of jeans that I own are low-rise because I can't find regular ones. If they arent' low-rise or hip-huggers; they are high waters or they come up past my abdominal area! About 5 years ago I had no trouble finding regular jeans....times have changed. I am getting sick of my ass crack hanging out everytime I bend over or when I get in and out of my car.   I have a dinner date tonight. I hope it goes well. I am forcing myself to go. I don't know what the hell is wrong with me. Sometimes I am in the mood to socialize and sometimes I just want to hide in my apartment and never talk to a soul. I go from being extremely attracted to some people, to thinking that they are totally annoying and unattractive. It depends on the day and my mood. I wish it wasn't this way. Lacey is gorgeous. She has a great personality and she would be good for me. She's drug-free, an occasional drinker and we have the same goals in life. However,&nbsp;I can see myself pushing her away within the next couple of weeks. I always do that and I don't know why. Oh well, we'll see. It should be a good time if I can get other things off my mind.&nbsp; I get to keep my mom's Jeep overnight and I am excited. It has nice wheels, a DVD player and a kick-ass sound system.   That's all for now.

      Periodically, I go through phases where millions of things run through my head at once. It normally happens when I become overly frustrated. I am having one of those moments right now. I am sitting here thinking that this is the most horrible hot chocolate I have ever had. Gas station hot chocolate sucks, but its the best I could do. There are no Coffee Houses in the vicinity of my school so I am SOL.  &nbsp; I am so mad at Arnold Schwarzenegger right now. He referred to the California Democratic Party as "girlie men". That can be seen as a sexist comment as well as a homophobic comment. Also, there are WOMEN in the California Democratic Party, too. Are they "girlie men" too???? In addition, Arnold's wife claims to be a feminist! Give me a break! I am a little fired up at the present time. &nbsp; I don't think Martha deserved a prison sentence. She made a mistake as do all human beings. So unless she is some angelic figure, lay off and let her breathe. I think she deserved punishment of some sort, but not prison. I think our criminal justice system is sexist and biased. OJ kills his wife and makes the NFL hall of fame....Martha makes a monetary mistake and hits the wall of shame. I love Martha. I started liking her in 1999 when I was a freshman in college. I tried one of her recipes and I loved it. The next week I used some of her creative decorating ideas and turned my shack of a dorm room into a palace. Ok- so my reasons for thinking she should not be in prison are lame. I still think that there are many celebs who have done far worse and are still running free.

      Greetings!!!! Nothing new here. So far today has been a typical Monday for me. I woke up at 430am and played bball at 530am. It was a great workout and a great way to start my Monday. After that, I watched the news, ate some dry cereal and a banana, fed Houston, sorted my laundry (because I have a washer and dryer now-who'da ever thunk I'd be doing my own laundry?) Then I went to Wally world and purchased lots of soup for my soup diet (vegetable soup for lunch and dinner.) I buy the Campbell's Soup at Hand brand because it is very convenient. After that, I went to workout. I had to work out early because I have to go to the dentist and get my fangs cleaned here in a little bit. I try to get them cleaned at the change of every season at least (4 times a year). After that, I am coming back to finish off my paper and search the net.&nbsp;I am looking for new running shoes and a dart board for my spare bedroom. Any ideas? Ebay is my first choice.  &nbsp; I had the biggest debate with a friend last night. I can't believe that I even&nbsp;socialize with such closed-minded people. We argued over same sex marriage and war. We both have opposite views and beliefs on each topic, and we both feel strongly about our beliefs on the topics. I am strongly opposed to war. I always have been and I always will be. I think it has a negative affect on the overall quality of human life. I will never support it. Most people are familiar with the various forms of conflict resolution. There is a range from about 8-10 ways to resolve conflict. I think war is conflict resolution; in its most inhumane form. There are various perspectives that war can be analyzed from to determine its benefit or contribution to our lives. Sadly, most people look at it from an economical perspective-analyzing its monetary benefit and how it can contribute to the financial development of our country. Some look at it from a psychological perspective-analyzing its affect on the human psyche. I think the most logical way to analyze war is from a sociological perspective-analyzing the social problems that it presents as well as how it affects the various aspects that surround human life. Basically, it is logical to analyze how war affects US and why it has the determined affect. I am very opinionated and my next statement is a bold one to make....but its truly how I feel. I think war indirectly condones violence. It indirectly condones gang wars, spousal abuse, relationship conflict-whether it be between two lovers or two sisters. It indirectly persuades us to slove problems out of anger and retaliation instead of utilizing other forms of conflict resolution. I hate it so bad!!!! &nbsp; I am for same sex marriages for obvious reasons. But even if I were not "sexually diverse" I would still be for it. I asked my friend to give me one reason that she is opposed to it and her dumb ass said "reproduction". Oh my goodness!!!! No way. You can't use reproduction and marriage in the same sentence. Maybe 50 years ago when America had higher morals and standards. Not today. That is not a valid argument simply because there are many people who have kids and aren't married. Just as there are many married couples who don't want kids. That is just the way it is. In addition, if two lesbians wanted kids.....there are new ways to "reproduce" is they want to.Give me a break.&nbsp; Plain and simple....I would much rather see a kid be raised by two lesbians than by a single mother or by a heterosexual couple where the dad is abusive to the mom or where the mom is subordinate to the dad. Just my opinion. &nbsp; &nbsp;

      Back in the Blogger atmosphere. I have been too busy to journal. I finally have a few minutes to relax before I meet with my teammates from class. We have a huge paper and presentation in a few weeks and we really have to get on it if we plan on making a decent grade. The paper is over software systems and how they are incorporated in the business environment. We'll see how this goes. It's alot of research, so I assuming that there will be lots of paraphrasing going on.  &nbsp;  Nothing too new here. I feel good today. I feel relaxed and at ease. My brother called me last night to see how I am doing. He is so anti-social and isolated that he never calls. I know he cares about me, but he's just not the type of person that talks regularly. I was surprised and it made me feel really good. He told me that he loved me and that I am on his mind. I really miss him alot. We had a difficult period not long ago where I disagreed with some of his actions. We had a huge argument. He apologized and things are good now.&nbsp; Sometime soon, my fam and I are going to dinner and maybe a movie. Generally we try to do a bonding activity once a month, but lately there has been so much turmoil that we haven't desired to be around one another. My sister is planning the outting and we have to eat somewhere that is health nut friendly because my sister and I are healthnuts and my mom and brother like to grub. We'll see. I think Red Lobster is a great suggestion.  &nbsp;  Tomorrow is an easy day for me. Pretty laid back and stress-free. I have to wake up at 430 because I have bball at 530 am. Lately, when I have bball, I have been waking up an hour before game time to get loose, put some energy (food) in my body and drink enough water to start my hydration for the day. By the time 530 rolls around, I wide awake and ready. I get off at 3 or 330 tomorrow and I have absolutely nothing to do all weekend.  &nbsp;  Well, I am off for now.

      Talk about anger management!!!! So I go to Bally (the gym) as I do EVERY FUcking Monday afternoon. The plan was for me to take a study break, work on my abs and lower body for and hour, grab a bite to eat and come back and study. Well, I get to Bally and the person at the front desk swipes my card (as they always do) and he wouldn't let me enter the gym. He said that I was behind on my payment. Those of you who know me, know that I am NEVER behind on any bills. In fact I like to pay them early. I even hand delivered my payment last week because I was in the area. So he had to pull up my account and it showed that I made a payment but it wasn't posted to my account yet. So that took like 35 minutes. By the time it was over, I had to head back to school.  I had a fabulous lunch. Every since I tried sushi, I have been on a sushi rampage. I love it (Only if it is dipped in soy or sweet and sour sauce). I am at the exploratory stage in my life. We all go through it. ( I learned that in psychology). I am really into trying new things and experiences.  I am gradually seperating myself from the Alli and LaShawn saga....as it continues at a rapid pace. I have become distant from each of them except on Sundays b/c I play bball on the same team as LaShawn. Other than that and an occassional amaretto sour or margarita, I am not involved in the circle anymore.  I miss my family. I haven't really seen them in a bit. I saw them last week only for a short time. I miss giving my brother "blow-up kisses" where he blows his cheeks up as much as he can and I kiss them until they deflate ( yep we are dorky). I miss sitting on my moms lap and teasing her about her kuntree accent. I miss calling my sister bad names and walking the plaza with her. There is so much that I appreciate, small things. I really need to be exposed to the things I appreciate at this point in my life. I want to spend as much time with them as possible before I move to the big TX.   Well, that is all for now. eikyM

      I have been thinking a lot about my late Grandma Opal lately. TO be honest, I have thought about her every single day since her death in February of 2002. Anyway, I have been thinking of her excessively for the past couple of days. In the ongoing process of re-evaluating my personal life in attempt to live an honest and productive life and to be a good person, I keep thinking of all the work she put into teaching me to be a good, whole-hearted, well-rounded and head-strong individual. In our home we were always taught and forced to practice three basic core values: family, fun and fitness. Each of the core values contained variations of life's many aspects. Respect, love, discipline and many others fall under the core values. Needless to say, I have not appreciated the values I was taught for quite sometime. I have slightly gone astray and it is almost like my Grandma is looking down from heaven in disappointment. I have got to get it together. I really have been trying, but it is so hard when you feel that every single situation you encounter is a failure. It takes time. Slowly but surely I'll get there.  I had a good weekend and for the first time in a long time I am glad that today is the beginning of a new week. There is so much that I considered over the weekend and I have made some decisions that will contribute to my overall growth and well-being. I am proud of myself for settling on a decision on my own and being ok with it.

      Sometimes the way people say things can have more of an affect on you than what is actually being said. It seems that lately I have been victimized by others and their verbal aggressiveness.I think it is because I have really been out of it for the past couple of weeks. I have been holding everything together and being productive, but I really have been out of it for the most part. I think people see this and feel the need to take advantage of my non-attentiveness and the fact that I have not been in my "right mind" for quite sometime. Well, guess what? I am back. Today I am free from all types of intoxication and I am clearly seeing what is happening in my life.  Yester-evening I went to dinner with "S" and I talked and talked about things that have been going on in Mykie's world. I never talk so much about myself at once becasue I am so secretive, but I felt so at ease when I was talking to her that I felt the need to open up and reveal all of my mind's contents. I really feel comfortable talking to her. She actually tries to understand even if she doesn't agree. I have always liked that about her and I think that is what attracts me to her most. After talking with her and just opening up, I feel like a new person- for the better. It is nice to have at least one person who listens and cares about what you are saying or what you are going through. Everyone needs that at some point in their lives. Normally, when I talk to "S", I am so interested in what is going on in her world. I like to hear what's shakin' in her sugar tree. But yesterday was rare. Not once did I ask her about her life or her sitautions. At first I thought that maybe she would think I was being self-centered or not interested, but then I realized that she has been where I am before-in different ways. She knew that there was alot going on and I needed to vent it out. I really appreciate that. She listtened intently for nearly an hour. Those of you who know me know that I don't like to reveal my problems-especially not for an hour. It was amazing and I realized how important my friendship with her is.   I was a maniac in the gym today. I lifted for an hour and a half straight and didn't get fatigued. I had so much on my mind that I forgot I was actually lifting. Then I ran 6 miles and it felt like 2. I could have kept going longer.   Kelsey hung up in my face last night. Imagine that. It seems that everytime we have a dispute, she wants to end the conversation immediately. I don't know how much longer she'll be around. She just doesn't understand that I have things going on and that there is life outside of her.  Well, that is all for now.

      Today seems to be a fairly decent day in the workplace. Everyone is refreshed from the holiday break and things are flowing freely. Today is the first day in a long time that I have not been extremely busy. It excites me to know that I can go directly home from work without having to go to my other job. I can just go home at a decent hour and relax and enjoy my apartment. It has been a while since I have been able to spend time there. It seems like I sleep there sometimes. I shower there and I don't see it again until the tail end of the day or the next morning. I am glad things are starting to settle down.   I have been trying to copy and paste my application and responses to the questions for the L Magazine Bachelorette of the Week Contest, but for some reason I can't paste it on my blog and it is too long to type it all in. We'll see. I think my responses were honest. I really think I have a good chance to win.   Nothing new here. I never get time to blog because my life has been so on the go lately. I had a great weekend. I went to Westport twice and Lawrence and Topeka once each. Things seem to be ok between "Kels" and me. I am glad that she agreed to move slow. I don't think I can handle being in a relationship right now. I just have to face it. I am still a little traumatized from past ones that I need to get over. It is unfair to drag her into my confusion.  I settled on my decision to move. I will graduate with my Master's in January, so I am going to move in March. I am moving to Dallas. If things get better with "Kels" and me, she will come along, if not....I am ok on my own.   Well, that is all for now

      Well folks- I must admit that I look pretty damn cute today. I have adopted the Ellen DeGeneres look for today. I have on a tannish colored suit coat, a white button down shirt, a pair of OldNavy jeans and some brown low top boot looking shoes. My hair is spiked in all the right directions and I feel great. I have a final presentation tonight. Should be interesting. Next week I start a new class....Systems Thinking and Performance. We'll see how that goes. So far I have all A's and 2 B pluses.  My Monday morning has been great. Woke up at 430 ish....ate a banana and drank some OJ. Then I played bball at 530-7. Took a shower and got spiffy and came to KC to finish off my paper and practice my presentation. I am not overly stressed about it. I think I am ready....it just sucks to stand in front of a class full of people for 20-25 minutes. Oh well.  The plan is for me to work diligently on my homework til noon- then go lift weights til noon:30, have lunch at noon:30, shower and come back and study til 6. Class from 6-10.  This is an exciting week for me. I have a friend coming in town from Arkansas on Wed. She is staying with me from Wed til Sunday night. I took vacation from work from Wed til Tues. It should be a blast. She has never really been to KC, so we will spend most of our time there. I am excited to see what terms we are on when she leaves. There is alot of attraction there from both ends, but we both have had our share of relationship difficulties, personality clashes, or unhappiness with other people. My main problem with finding the right somebody is I hate the empty feeling. I don't necessarily need to be around them constantly, but I need to know that they feel the same way I do or that they are excited as much as I am. If I don't get that vibe from them, I either end it or seek the fulfillment elsewhere. I like vibrance and the last few relationships I have been in have not provided me with that, at least not consistently. Most of them have been really boring to me-and I HATE boredom. Sherri seems to be different. She is openly lesbian as I am. She is so exciting and full of life-as I am. We match really well. Even down to our interests in vegetarianism and fitness, from politics to traveling. We match. But I look at it like I am shopping for shoes. There have been times when I have purchased shoes just because they may match an outfit perfectly, at the same time, the same shoes only offered discomfort and pain-though they looked good. The same applies to my search for a somebody. I am really critically analyzing everything and I don't want to act too fast. We'll see.  Well, I am off for now. I have more to say-but I have to get this paper done.
