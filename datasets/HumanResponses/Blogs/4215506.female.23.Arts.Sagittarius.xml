      So the parents came home after being gone for three days up north. Which I hate that they do this because it leaves me stuck at home if the realator calls and wants to show the house since we need to box up the kitty since he likes to eat people. Then like they come home and fucking just trash the kitchen, c'mon. Then my mom goes "Oh I figured if I left it you would do it" WTF is that shit. I've been like the "cups go in the dishwasher" nazi for the last two weeks keeping crap clean. Then like she buys this puter game and just hands it to me, doesn't ask me to install it for her, so I just kiddingly said "OH I'm just used for my puter skills" and she freaks out and is like "Well I think you use me for pleanty of things"...ok thats a fucked up thing to say so I ask her what I use her for.........well....uh...I dunno, yeah thats what I thought. Then like the outside light was on, my dad asked me if it was on for a reason and I said no, then he freaks at me about it and is like "I guess I'LL have to go turn it off" yeah such a struggle for you to walk your happy ass over to the switch. On the brightside, I went for an uber long walk, whoo three days in a row now. I'm trying to go everyday instead of every other day. *sigh* I wish I had money to buy a new CD to listen to when I go.

      *sigh* woke up to my sister's loud ass mouth this morning. Oh joy she's here to visit today...can't tell you how happy that makes me. ugh. So I've pretty much hid from her in my room all day. I did escape for a bit though and went for a walk this morning. I coudln't go yesterday cause my knee was really bothering me, but I figured I've gone 4 out 6 days this week which is way better than I have been doing since I moved back home. But I've been eating a lot better than when I lived with the ex. Him and his damn Chipolte obssession. Oh well, thats the nice thing about living back home, when I spend time cooking dinner my fam is all appriciative about it instead of going and getting fast food instead. Tommorrow is another open house so back up to the cabin again with the devil kitty. Hopefully I'll remember batteries for the digicam and get some pics of the lake, its really cool up there now cause there are lily pads all over it. I'm thinking of driving seprate though so I don't have to spend all damn day up there though.

      Ugh I hate my neighbors! The like had a party on a Thursday night!!! Who party's on a Thursday. Yeah need to say they're lame laughing and screaming and bottle breaking kept me up till 3am. My mom won't let me call the cops on them lol, they're vengeful little fucks and would know who did call on them. I found out yesterday that it looks like my parental units are going to let me keep my car when we move down to FL!!! They originally were going to make me sell it but I guess my aunt wants to come down with us and suggusted driving with me and she said she'd like drive most the way cause the woman loves to drive!!! AHHH! This so kicks ass! lol besides with my directionally retarded self, I'd like end up in Texas or something instead. Normally I'm not a big fan of my aunt, but she's been ok latley, and like since she knows all my business cause my mom tells her everything, when she called the other day she was really supportive of me moving which yeah that was fuckin awesome of her! Since she's like the only one not in my house whose said something postitive to me about it. We have an open house to get ready for this weekend ugh, I have a feeling there is going to be one every Sunday since my parents want to get rid of the house fast. Eeep! Which reminds me for some odd reason that I need to call the school in Tampa I wanna go to and set up another phone interview. UGH it sucks so bad, because I'm not considered a dependent yet, my mom has to be all invloved in college shit...I'm twenty the fuck three years old! c'mon!

       God I'm so becomming as bad as Cassie with my multiple blogs. But I hate that your all limited to your blogging community and crap. But until I stop being a cheap ass and get my own domain and shit, yeah this is how it's gonna be! The house is nice and quiet for once, the parental units and one of they're friends went to see The Notebook, to which I refused to be dragged along too. I went on a walk again today whooo third day this week! I feel bad for missing yesterday but damn it was only 50 degrees out yesterday! Summer??Hellooooo! Yeah this week has been hella cold, makeing the move to Florida looking oh so much better...well cept for the hurricane shit they have going on down there hehe.
