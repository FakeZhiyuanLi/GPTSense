      man, yesterday was a drag.  i went to get my haircut at this place in norwalk.  so were in the car and my mom is all like, "well go this way. i know a shortcut".  well, it turns out, my mom didnt know any shortcut and we just kept going straight on this weird road somewhere for like 15 minutes.  after some crazy winding turns and confusion, we finally got back to the main road, and made it to the haircutting place in time for the 12 o'clock appointment.  there were so many homos in there, with their squeeky voices, listening to gay pop music.  i was just glad to not get one of them to cut my hair.  the lady that i got gave me such a bad haircut.  i look like such a homo now.  its crazy.  but, itll grow back, eventually.  and on the way back, i saw two mad crazy black ghetto dudes right in the middle of darien.  definetely a rare sighting.  alright, im out, later.

      wow.  so today was all crazy.  like at 2, i went to the doctors to go check out my rash and all.  the doctor starts like talking about how hes gonna have to cut my arm off.  what a lame bastard.  then i find out my rash is like a crazy case of poison ivy.  so its crazy.  the doc gave me some lotion for it thats in like these little bottles, they look funny.  so then after that, i call up james, and hes all like me and bussey are going down to mr. fruity or something.  so then i come along and we get ice cream.  then we go to bussey's house to chill and listen to music.  then bussey beats me up because ive never heard a beatles song.  it was funny.  after that, me and james go to noroton train station to pick up jordan.  he's supposed to be coming down today.  we wait there for like 45 minutes or so.  he didnt come.  so james gives me a ride home and all, and right when i come in, rad is all like jordan was calling.  so i call up the negro and he couldnt make it to noroton so he had to get off at stamford and hes on the bus to my house now.  so he comes and we bust out some good ol' hindley skating like old times.  nothing too great was going down and it was hot as hell so we decided to hit the Puritan for some drinks.  we got the drinks and looked at some porn while the chinese dude was fiddling with something behind the counter.  we then left and sessioned the picnic table for like 2 seconds then left to my house.  we then decided to go to carolines house, but she wasnt home, so we went back to my house.  after tech decking for a couple minutes we checked the train schedule for the next train to redding.  sucked for him bc it was in like 15 minutes.  so he had to haul ass all the way to noroton train station.  he calls me like 20 minutes later telling me he barely made it so its all good.  then im thinking to myself, im just gonna space out for the rest of the night.  and yea, i space out for a couple of minutes.  then remember to update my blog.  so here it is, the crazy updateage, fresh out of spacing out, enjoy.

      on saturday, i wake up scratching myself furiously.  im like wow, how did i get this huge rash on my arm.  i think its just a mosquito bite so i dont worry about it.  it keeps itching the whole day and im really pissed off now because i like irritated it so much it hurts.  so then i go to plan b, and start smacking my arm against the chair.  after a while i got tired, so i started biting it.  then, after close inspection, i saw that it wasnt just one bite, it was like 50 tiny little bites across my arm that go in lines.  it almost forms an A, except it doesnt have the line through the middle.  so i guess its an upside down V.  its insane.  then after doing more damage to my arm to stop the itching sensation, i noticed it started ejecting puss from the little bites.  so now im all like grossed out so i go to the sink and just turn on the water to full heat and stick my arm under it.  that felt really good.  but i started losing feeling in my arm so i decided to stop.  finally, the water treatment got rid of the itch.  when i dryed off my arm, it was all red and the bites were like sticking out and all whitish.  it was insane.  i like freaked out my mom when i showed her.  its crazy.  she was all like inspecting it and finally gave me some cortizone 10 to stop the itch bc it started itching again.  so now im like itll get better so i leave it alone.  on sunday, i wake up and start itching the crap out of it again.  i found out how to pop the little bites so now i like squirt puss.  but that helps it heal.....i think.  but its not getting better.  its still itching today and i came to the conclusion that its either poison ivy or ants.  but neither of those make sense bc i didnt even go outside on friday, and itll take like a whole antfarm of ants to give me so many bites.  so, i have no clue what it is.  its probably like one of those crazy mutated african gene strand virus's that have no cure, and ill prob die in like a week.  until then, stay tuned for suggested treatment and identification.  this is aris, saying, good night connecticut, and have a pleasant tomorrow...

      well, today didnt turn out half bad.  went to play soccer at 2 with all ma peeps.  that was really fun.  got home, took a nice long shower, and just spaced out for a few hours.  then, boredom hit again.  man, what is it with these long, boring summer nights.  i can never find anything to do towards the end of the day.  it feels like all i do is skate, and play soccer eventually.  i dont hang out with my friends, the very few that i have, as much.  well, those that dont skate, i mean.  i really need to get out there and meet new people, especially ones that are good at skating.  see, here i go again about skating.  i cant help myself...i wanna skate.  i didnt get any skating done today so im really hyped.  its like by far, the funnest thing thats ever happened to me.  id recommend it to everyone.  whats really bothering me now is how popular its getting.  it now somehow is in every commercial that has completely nothing to do with skateboarding at all.  all of a sudden u see kids wearing skateboarding clothes and shoes and they dont even skate, or they "used to skate".  also,  many kids just do it for the style.  like, sup with that!  there are only a few kids out there that do it for the love.  and they are the ones that will make the biggest impact on skateboarding.

      today was really boring.  at about 3:20, james picked me up and we went to skate soundview and the wwf building.  after skating those for about 25 minutes and getting kicked out, we went to josh's place and watched some good footage.  the three of us went to go skate town.  we go up to the rainbow shop and meet jay and these norwalk skaters.  we skated a bit, but nothing was really going down.  i really need to step it up.  after getting kicked out we went to this grass gap near some bank.  we hardly even eyed it before this random chick starts calling the cops on us.  jay forgets this is darien and starts talking back and all, then remembers its darien, and stops because the chick was already busting out the cops on the cell.  so then me, james, and josh go to the place behind cvs and just skate that for a bit.  josh gets his finger jammed in the window while james was closing it.  looked like it hurt a lot.  well, the skating, it sucked, nothing was going down at all.  then we just went to hang out at the darien sports shop with this kid bruno.  that was really funny.  we hardly got any skating in today though, so that sucked, and i still wanna go back and do that grass gap.  oh yea, i still need something insipirational to write on my griptape to get me psyched for when im skating.  if any of u little bastards have any ideas, tell me.  oh, and my ghettoness is going away.  thats what happens when u skate darien.  alright im done for today.  later.

      wow dude today was probably the craziest day of skating i had in stamford.  it was sick.  here it goes.  so sometime around five im all like busting out the moves on tony hawks pro skater and its sick and all, but then im all like, dude i so gotta bust out some crazy skating today.  so i get ready and head out for the long skate to stamford.  on the way i remember this kid, cj savage, that played on my team in after school soccer at middlsex.  i think hes in like 8 grade now or whatever.  so me and jordan always made fun of him and it was really funny.  so one day he wouldnt tell us what the c and j stood for so me and jordan made it up.  "cock jacking savage" is what he is known as now or just plain ol' "cock jacker".  hahaha i was laughing my ass off on post road thinking about it.  i must have looked like the biggest homo just like cracking up on post rd by myself.  but whatever yo.  so when i get down there im just like cruising around to all the spots and all looking for some homies to skate with.  dude like no one is out, so im going to uconn and all and on my way there i see the funniest cross dressing hobo i have ever seen.  its prob the first cross dressing hobo i have ever seen.  it was so funny.  he was wearing a polka dot dress and was carrying plastic bags or whatever.  but it was so funny, he was like out of it, like drunk or i dont know, and was wearing a big necklace.  it was funny.  then i hit a crack and fell off my board.  so i get to uconn and theres no one there so im like where is everyone.  so then i go to the double four.  im like dude theres so gonna be people there.  then i see these two kids skating the two and i come up to them and im all like sup man have u seen anyone else skating and theyre all like no no and im all like thats coo'.  so i just go cruising again.  everything was pretty mellow until i got to the road that pedigree is at.  it was like all blocked off and weird and i skate down farther and theres a concert going down.  wow dude i was so stoked.  i checked it out and it was a 95.9 FOX classic rock station concert called like LIVE @ FIVE  or whatever.  it was pretty beat.  i was just like checking out the bands and they were like classic rock style and i dont think they were that good.  but then again i dont really listen to classic rock.  i had to move to several different spots bc people were smoking like crazy and i like couldnt breathe.  but it was all good and i got a 95.9 FOX sticker for my board.  it was intense.  i put it on the nose so i can scratch it off.  it somewhat scratched off but u can still see it.  alright so i was just like skating around the concert place and i see those two little kids there.  they leave and i go to find people to skate again.  i go to the square and bobby is there!  hes like sup man and im all like sup and its all cool.  there were like 6 girls there all ugly and a couple more dudes.  all of them were like super drunk and/or stoned and the chicks were like kissing each other and they were fat and ugly and prob lesbians so that was gross.  and one of them was trying to get on this kids bike and he was all like "yo, u best get ur sister yo, before she kills herself on my bike yo".  bam! thats a direct quote.  he said yo like a lot.  it was intense.  then the drunk chick went after my board and i was all like, no im using it.  then she swore at me a couple times, and sat down to do other stuff.  i dont really know what, i left after that bc they were all drunk and whatever and were smoking like crazy so i parted with bobby and set out to the circle benches.  there were some mexican dudes there skating and i skated with them for a bit.  it was pretty nice, got some tricks down on the bench.  then i parted with the mexo's and went to micky d's for a drink.  on the way there i saw those two little kids skating prudential and i came up to them and they sorta looked scared.  i was like sup man.  and the kid was trying the four, i gave him a few pointers and he finally did it.  i cheered him on and it was all good.  talked to them for a little, then went to micky d's for some sick h2o consumption.  then i see this kid that was with bobby and we talk for a bit about skating or whatever and how hes also fucked up and is taking care of all the drunk chicks up there.  it was crazy.  thats all.  how sick is that.  like it was so intense.  so many things were going down.  oh yea, the thing thats even crazier is that this is like the 3rd time im retyping this due to some insane computer failure.  and it really blew like crazy.  adn was really annoying.  alright im out...

      dude, today was mac daddy hot nasty, foo.  me and james went down to SONO today at like around the fivish hour.  we went to axis and james was all about the buying of a new deck and video so he did that while i just looked around.  dont really need a new deck, shoes? nope, im still waiting for my ccs order to come in so i didnt get anything.  then we go back to his car to put his gear away and i see mr martin!!!  dude mr martin is the coolest, he was like eating with his family at this restaurant place.  but anyways we go put the stuff in his car and james called bobby, this kid from stamford whos super good at manuals and super chill, and he says to call him back in like a half an hour.  so then we go skate the spots at SONO.  we skate this little gap thing with a ledge for a while then decide to hit up the five.  we get there and im just trying to go for this line, fakie varial heelflip to 180 the five, but my varial heely isnt even happening so im like drop that foo and i move on to some other ghetto line.  then i see james trying to kickflip the five so im all like ill give it a shot too.  and i just go for it first try and i do it like perfectly but i catch the board and kick it out like right away.  like its such a retard reaction that i have.  so im like all like wow i totally just had that.  so then i keep trying and landing it but falling on my wrist all the time bc of some really awkward landing situations.  so im like so freakin close to doing it and im really hyped and the heelflips are just flowing, like i flick it and it just spins so beautifully, and like i wanna have an orgasm and its so freakin cool.  then i do it and i land it.  im all like wow and im super stoked that i just did that bc thats the first time i actually heelflipped any stairs and it turned out to be a five and im feeling so good.  so that was hot and we decided to leave.  thats when i felt the hurt of those falls on my like thumb muscle or whatever its called.  and its like swollen a bit, but its all good and it was worth it.  then we hit up burger king and get some munchies and call bobby again and hes all like i cant come out im really sore from yesterday and all so we just go to james' house to view the new vid and all.  the new vid is actually and old plan b video but it was still good.  its just awesome to watch these old vids and see how much skateboarding has progressed through the years.  people are just doing insane stuff now that the people back then couldnt even dream of.  its crazy.  well anyways we viewed it and it was good and all then we watched a few parts of yeah right and that was hot.  then i borrowed chomp and james was gonna take me home but instead we went to the bay to find erika.  we drove around like the whole place and got stuck in like two dead ends and it was funny.  then we go to dunkin donuts to see if anyone is chilling there.  we get there and we see alex carmona, tory, darina, and other people there and they were all like super drunk and tory was like all over james and carmona was like trying to put moves on me and it was pretty rad.  then tory was all like give me a hug and i didnt really know she was drunk bc i dont really know her and i thought shes always like that so i was like whatever sure and i hug her and she smells like booze all over and it was funny.  i ended up giving her a piggy back ride and then james drove me back home.  so today was pretty sick and i wanna skate really bad again.  it was fun while it lasted, hopefully tomorrow ill chill with bobby in stamford but we shall see.  but for now, im out....

      alright so im back by popular demand and its hot and all.  but the thing that really ruined it is that chris black tried to be funny and ruined my hundred percent votes for "yes" on my profile.  yea chris, ill remember this when ur asking me to skate.  yea, what, ill kill u.  alright, so i got the new "the Used" cd and its sooooo awesome.  its a cd and a dvd.  the songs are mostly all the live stuff with a few unreleased tracks but they are still bangin'.  i love it so much.  but the real treat is the dvd.  i just watched it today and it was the best thing i have viewed in a while, except maybe for dying to live and sorry.  but it was so hardcore.  it like tells the story of the band and how it all got started adn what happened and all.  and it shows bert getting humped in teh face by a fat naked hooker in the recording studio in london on his 20 birthday.  that was so raw dude like i so wasnt expecting it.  especially when i was watching it in the living room with my parents like all near by somewhere.  it was so insane.  and it was like 120 minutes long so it was crazy.  wow dude it was really good and i liked it a lot.  it was siiiiiicckkkk!!!!!(rock on sign).  i recommend it to anyone who doesnt mind watching fat naked hookers humping their favorite bands vocalist.  other than that its super good.  thats about all thats happened in the last like 2 days.  oh yea, it was so hot how i got it too.  i went to the palisades in westchester or whatever, and i was all like im gonna go to best buy to see if they have it there.  and i already knew it was 20 bucks so i was like its worth it.  then i find it and its only 9.99 so im like freakin jumping around and like huggin the cd and i just cant like let it go.  so that was such a good deal.  a cd and dvd for 10 bucks, i call that a hot spankin' deal yo.  holla......

      sweet, today was pretty nice.  me and james go skating at about 5 in town.  we're skating the manual pad and its super fun and all when i think erika calls or something happens, i forget, so we go down to stamford to meet them.  it starts raining a little and i tought all was gone but it just stopped after a little tinkle so it was mad tite.  we go down to the mall to meet them.  we meet them and just go around the mall and hang out.  all's well and we go to skate the parking lot.  that was pretty fun.  im surprised we didnt get kicked out of the mall sooner for having our boards with us.  then erika and katharine go to mikes house or whatever.  so when they left we went to skate.  skating was so awesome today.  i felt so good to get out and skate and i was hyped up too.  after skating a little james is all tired and all and wants to leave.  im still hyped and wanting to skate.  so that was an upset.  but whatever, it was all good.  he droped me off and now im here, probably typing up my last entry to my blog.  yep, this is probably it.  people just get offended by my blog so i just wont even bother with it anymore.  i dont wanna hurt anybody's feelings.  so whatever, if u guys want me to keep it or drop it, talk to me about it.  im still undecided.

      another horrible day goes by.  i thought today was gonna be good and all but noooooo, it just had to suck bc i suck at life.  at about 2 i had two things to do: either go to erikas and chill with jordan and her, or go to stamford and have a blast skating.  well of course being the dumbass that i am, i chose to go to erikas.  that was like the first time i chose anything over skating...is this a sign of something horrible yet to come?!?!?!  well im still waiting for jordan to arrive when james is all like come with me and julia to a movie blah blah blah.  another freakin descision!! oh come on.  i had to think this one thouroughly.  ive never seen julia hathaway but i hear shes super hot.  so its either go to erikas and sit there and listen to jordan and erika talk for hours or go with james and see a movie with a supossedly super hot chick.  but the again i havent seen erika or jordan in like the longest time.  whatever shall i do?!??  my head started to pound and i didnt know what to do.  thats when erika was like jordan isnt gonna come whatever whatever.  and then james was all like were not going to the movie, the he plays a cruel joke on me and im so freakin confused and stressed out i have no clue whats going on at all.  so long story short we end up going to erikas to hang out.  well i knew i shouldve just went skating bc all that went on at erikas was bussey and james making fun of me and my family.  plus i was already pretty depressed from yesterday and also it was like super awkward.  wow what a day.  then i wanted to leave but like i couldnt really since it was my idea in teh first place to go to erikas.  so then we drive bussey to mccaffreys(spell check anyone?) and someone calls james' cell from my house.  hes like here u go answer it.  im scared bc im afraid its my parents, then i pick up and its jordan.  wow what a relief.  so we pick him up and go back to erikas.  we just hang out in her room for some time then just go outside to play some ghetto street ball.....well only jordan and erika.  me and james just skate like this little slanted hill she has.  and its so much fun!!!!  like im loving it!!  i dont know if its from wanting to skate so bad all day or from the urge to forget everything thats happened and happening.  so me and james get really into it and like im learning tricks.  i was close to getting the f/s 360 and b/s heely on the hill.  it was so much fun.  oh my f/s 360's are actually 270's but im working on it.  thats what i meant by close to getting it.  anyways i cheer up somewhat from the nice little session on erikas hill, and it was time to go.  me and james were supposed to go with julia again to a 7 o'clock movie but she cancelled that too.  nothing is going right at all... then we had to deliver jordan to the train station bc his train leaves in like 10 minutes.  so we all get in and james just puts the pedal to the metal and accels like a mofo down outlook drive.  then this guys yells at us to slow down.  after we get jordan to the train station, we all go home.  at home im super depressed bc of some personal stuff i cannot reveal to the general public.  so i have a talk with my good friend dory.  dory is awesome.  and she made me feel so much better.  thanks dory! ur the coolest.  then flip sorry finally finished downloading so i just sign off and drift into skateboarding paradise.  what a good way to end a horrible day....

      wow, i havent blogged in a while.  i guess ive just been lazy.  no wait, ive been on vacation.  then after vacation i got lazy for about a week.  vacation really sucked.  and i mean really really sucked.  no freakin' skating for two weeks!  man what a drag.  i didnt think i could pull it off.  but, i did.  during vacation, my recreational activities included tech decking, handboarding, and having crazy tony sessions on the ps2.  thats about it.  oh yea, and i also played some intense tennis.  that was prob the only time i went outside.  i was so psyched for skating that i bought two skating mags over vacation and i read them thouroughly all the way through.  geez, i just wanted to stand on a skateboard, and feel the curves of that beauty.  but no cigar.  i thought i was gonna die.  my parents had to drag me outside to swim or whatever but i was longing for that special someone.  with its wooden ply's, and its slick paint finish, oh man.....i was missing it with all my heart.  i cant even explain it.  alright, so then we went to my friends, or family friends, house and i ask my friend alexie if he got a skateboard bc i was trying to get him into it and all.  hes all like, dude i have a deck, so im like freaking out and all, and like asking him like 20 questions at once, where is it, what kind is it, whatever whatever.  so hes like its just a blank.  so im like a blank, thatll do.  but he doesnt remember where he put it!!!  so im like freaking out looking for it through his whole garage, but we dont find it.  then like later that day he remembers he gave it back to his friend.  what a drag!!  i was really hoping to get some crazy flatground no wheels skating in.  alright so whatever.  today i saw that no one was online so i was like, im gonna go down and skate stamford by myself today.  so i go down and see some dudes skating there, so im like whatever itll do.  so then bryan comes down and we play skate at the circle benches.  im like the first one out bc i suck the big one.  so that lowered my self esteem.  so then on the way to uconn everyones talking about how they have a girlfriend and all, and that lowered my self esteem even more bc i dont have a girlfriend and ill prob be single forever.  we met up with alex and his girl and skated uconn for a while and then i ended up going home with a shattered self esteem.  damn, my life really sucks at this point.  skating isnt going well and my love life is even more horrible.  im such a loser....

      ok so its about like 4 in the morning and i have nothing to do.  i cant sleep, im not hungry so i cant eat.  i have nothing to do at all.  i wish i was older so then i could just do whatever i want.  like i feel like skating right now or just doing something like going out.  i just talked to bussey for a good 20 minutes and then just decided to update my tricked out blog i got here.  so here i am, updating my blog.  alright, on saturday i went to go play soccer at middlesex as usual.  so, im thinking today is gonna be awesome so many people are gonna show up, its really nice out, were gonna have so much fun.  when i get there, theres only 3 people there.  so im like ok whatever lets make the best of it.  then gordon decides to leave after like 20 minutes, i think he was scared of my poison ivy, if anyone remembers what poison ivy does to gordon.  and yes i still have my poison ivy.  like what the hell, leave me alone!!!  ok, back to the main story.  so now its only me, rob, and omar there.  we just like kick the ball around whatever.  so omar is like dribbling, i go to take the ball away, and he like tries to do like one of his queer little mexican fakes and smacks me in the face with his arms.  so im like alright whatever ill let it slide.  then my nose just starts bleeding and im like snorting the blood back and swallowing it.  so thats mad gross.  then i find out that omars grandma had children when she was 12, so i start calling omars grandma a big slut.  after a while omar gets all mad and starts getting all hypocritical (bam!! check out the big word) on me.  hes all like shut up and im all like ill kill u.  then i forget what happens, but i just start calling everyone gringos and homos.  it was funny.  then everything gets all mellow again, so i go to like one of the flag things and like attempt to try out my javelin skills, so i throw it like across the field and like rip some skin off my finger while doing that.  that hurt so i just go chill on the bench and wipe my blood on it.  so then everyone leaves and i call my mom to pick me up.  i end up waiting there for an hour before she finally arrives.  like, i shouldve just walked, i wouldve gotten home faster.  i dont really remember what happened on sunday.  i probably just stayed home all day doing nothing.  but thats what summer is all about.  its so weird.  like we all look forward towards summer, but then when summer finally comes, theres nothing to do at all, and its too hot to do anything.  so like u end up wasting ur life away in front of a computer and just writing all the crap u can possibly think off.  like i just wake up at about 1 o'clock everyday now.  i forgot what breakfast is.  i just wake up and have lunch.  but thats like what summer does to ya.  life just feels so empty without school.  like im glad school takes up our time.  i dont like how it takes up our time but it does.  and theres still time to skate.  but like in the summer, i have all the time in the world, but i skate way less than i did during school.  oh yea i got some skating in on monday.  but only for about a half an hour.  i havent skated in such a long time.  my legs got all cramped up and my muscles tightened up.  which was why i left.  its weird bc like if u dont do something for a while ur body like has to like work up to that thing that u did.  what?!?!  ok im sort of drifting off to sleep here.  one more thing, i saw a white kid with corn rows on monday i think it was.  like it was so insane.  seriously, like, what the hell were u thinking.  alright, im gonna go dream of hot babes and skateboarding sponsorships, later.

      wow what a day. dude it seems i start majority of my blogs with "wow".  how crazy is that. well, whatever.  on to more important issues, this is my first time blogging since......friday july 25, 2003 at exactly 12:35:17 in the a.m.  sweet.....alright i thought i was done with blogging forever mostly because i kinda got lazy of doing it and i dont know, it always just gets outta hand and i end up typing like 10 pages of crap that no one probably reads so i didnt do it for a while.  but today, today, was the day that i just had to blog about.  this day, friday january........ahh whatever itll be above the title after i post and publish this.  but anyways, it was crazy.  so it starts out that last night, i couldnt sleep and all and i got this art test in the mail where u have to like draw all these things and u mail it back to them and they score you and stuff.  i ended up only drawing one thing, it was like a face of a dog that was like all happy and stuff.  i think i drew it pretty well, but 20 minutes later i saw all of my flaws and stuff.  so then i couldnt sleep and all, and i had to finish reading this book for english that i chose to read, the lovely bones.  i was later informed by ragan and julia that it was a chick book and they were laughing at me.  so i started reading it because i still have to read like 200 pages in the next two days.  its a pretty crazy book actually.  yes its kinda girly, i noticed that, but its also strange.  this chick like gets raped by this dude whose like a murderer and he cuts her up and puts her in a safe and throws the safe out into like a sinkhole, and shes like all up in heaven looking down on her family thats all like trying to find the murderer.  long story short, her sister has sex at age 14, her mom had sex with the police officer/investigator guy, this one chick thats like obsessed by her death is a lesbian and secretely fantasises about having sex with women but at the same time being with them or something weird and crazy like that, and her dad like knows the murderer but doesnt have any proof and annoys the police and attacks this girl in the middle of the night and her boyfriend beats the living daylights out of him with a baseball bat and like kills his knee or something.  see what im talking about.  this book is weird.  and thats only what happens in the first half of the book.  alright so i keep reading until like 3 something a.m. and then i go to sleep.  i wake up around 11-12 and just play diablo for about 3-4 hours.  nothing special.  then my parents kick me off the computer and make me eat fruits because im on the computer for like the whole day.  it was crazy.  so then around 4:50 i decide to bust out to stamford, mostly because i havent skated in like 2-3 weeks and i prob horrible now.  so i go by myself and dont call anyone because im too lazy to call.  i get there around 5:30 and start looking for peeps i know.  i go to the triple 2 and see brian with these 3 rollerbladers skating the stairs and the rail.  so im all like hey whats up and we skate for like 20 minutes.  no tricks were happening so i was like lets bounce and all and we went to the double four.  on the way i was all like dude lets get bobby to skate because terrel (otherwise known as T) came down for a little while.  so we go to bobby's and T opens the door and we come in and jay is there and theyre playing t.h.u.g so im like thats cool.  me jay and brian wanna skate so were all like dude lets skate but bobby and T are all like we gotta eat then well skate.  so then we wait for them to finish playing thug and to eat and all at the same were all giving shit to brian and everyones making fun of him and all and T was putting crap in his hood and poured lotion in there and just stuff like that.  a lot of trash talking and all, it was pretty funny actually.  between all this me and jay went down to buy cigarrettes for T and everyone and we met up with max and he came back with us.  so then everyone went to smoke and i just went with them even though i dont smoke.  so finally we go skate the double four.  we get there and just skate and get kicked out in like 7 minutes.  so then we bust out to prudential, which to my surprise, is now Wachovia Securities!  thats crazy.  so many things change, like they cut down this tree at this church that we used to skate at, so that was pretty insane.  we also get kicked out of prudential/wachovia securities, i like prudential better, and we go skate the triple two. on the way there  were just skating and all's cool when jay just falls of his board, he was in front of me so i pick up his board and hand it to him to help him out and hes all like raging mad and takes his board and speeds off toward brian and knocks him off his board and starts punching him and calling him bad names and stuff, and u have to remember that brian has a broken nose and they just have a little brawl on the ground and everythings cool.  then we cross the street and brian starts acting all weird, i dont really recall what happened but brian was just all like lets fight u wanna fight, and stuff like that.  and T was all mad already after the mall incident where him and bobby met up with this kid and threatened to kill him and his boys if he or any of them ever called "her" again.  i dont remember who they were talking about but it was some chick.  so then theyre all like damn yo i was about to hit that kid, but they were at the mall so this other kid came and kinda broke things up.  it was actually pretty funny how he broke it up.  he was a funny kid.  so back to brian and T.....brian threw all his stuff down and put his fists up and T was all like oh u wanna fight lets fight, one on one.  so then he throws down his backpack and his coat and his hat, and puts his fists up too.  i thought they were just playing around.  then brian threw the first punch and it hit T on the side of the face.  that just set T off.  i mean he just went nuts.  he started cursing and just beating the crap out of brian.  and with every punch he would yell out bam!! and stuff like that.  he was cursing like crazy and it was all just like in the middle of the street.  they were just throwing fists at each other and yelling and people were just like standing there watching.  T nailed Brian in the face so many times.  finally bobby breaks it up and splits them up.  but T just got started and he wasnt finished.  he was so mad.  after bobby broke it up, T ran and jumped over this big planter tree thingie and jumped off of it and like kicked Brian in the back and came down with a punch right in his face, i would later find out the he "followed through" on his punches just like bobby taught him.  they fought some more and brian was just out.  he got his ass beat so bad.  result.....brian-got his ass kicked, really bad looking split eyebrow which was bleeding all over his face.  T- still mad as hell and got the hell outta there for fear of someone calling the cops on him.  T and bobby were also thinking about going after that kid at the mall too.  i dont know if they did because by this time it was already 8:40 and i had to go home.  but, wow, brians eyebrow was just split wide open and it looked pretty bad.  very bloody and messy.  it was pretty intense.  i really would not have wanted to be in his position.  i kinda feel really bad for him, everyone made fun of him the whole day AND he got his ass whooped really bad.  damn, thats harsh....

      vacation is boring.  i thought that it was gonna be awesome.  i always think that.  i always look forward towards vacation, and when it finally comes, it just sucks.  i was really bored today.  couldnt find anything to do.  which is exactly why im writing this right now.  theres not much to talk about.  it was really boring today so i decided to get in shape and start running.  yea, i just kind of decided to go running....  i put on some clothes and went running to middlesex for phase 1 of my training.  i get there in record time, just 12 minutes, and i see bob just riding his bike there in the parking lot, all alone.  we talked for a bit, but then i had to go to phase 2 of my training in which i needed the field, so he was all like ill be riding over here and i was like alright.  i went down to the field but there were these little kids practicing so phase 2 could not be completed.  so then i went back to find bob.  he was doing 180's off the two stair and i just sat and watched him.  about 10 minutes later, this fat kid on a mountain bike came by and just started doing laps around middlesex.  he just started riding his bike around the school.  it was really weird.  he came by us and was making these weird noises as he rode his bike which was pretty funny.  the second time he came around bob said hi to him and he just kind of stuck around.  then we told him to show us some tricks.  and it was the funniest thing because he couldnt do anything and tried to do a wheelie and could hardly get the front wheel up off the ground.  and he'd keep trying and every time he tried he would look back at us and see if we saw it.  it was pretty amusing.  then he whipped out a walkie talkie and started talking to someone, so that was kind of weird.  after a while it got pretty boring and there was nothing to do so bob went home and i also went back home.  i made it back in 10 minutes.  woohoo.  im super.

      ah yes, the much fabled and talked about blog of aris.  this is the return.  turns out, me starting a new blog didnt go so well.  wasnt off the hizzie after all.  so im just gonna let it whither and die, and it can go to hell! bc blogspot is the only blog for me.  i have neglected it for too long.  so...i have decided to go back to my first and most intense blog.  sometimes i look back and see how intense i was at blogging.  my fight club entry is like 10 pages long.  thats hardcore.  im sure no one even finished reading the whole thing.  wonder how long it takes to read it.  the thing is, i kinda get carried away.  i seriously was addicted to blogging back then.  oh the memories...  things have changed so much from those days.  my only problem right now is skating.  ever since jordan left darien to go play lacrosse and be preppy in redding, my skating has been decreasing in intensity.  that was a big blow to my skating career.  we were pals.  used to skate everyday in stamford or hindley or just at his house or wherever.  it was chill.  tear tear...i always get emotional about these things.  but i dont wanna talk about my skating problems.  it seems that all of my blogs are about skating.  all of them!  but after my period of non-blogging, i dont even skate anymore.  i want to.  but it doesnt happen.  ok, no more talk about skating...i will eventually, but on to more important things.  i had to do a 7 page paper (thats 7 with two sentences on the 8th page) for world studies last week.  it took me 5 hours to type it up.  it was on chernobyl.  about how there was a nuclear explosion on the homeland (if you dont know what the homeland is you are retarded and you dont deserve to live) and how the russians delt with it because they were bitching us around back then until we retaliated (howabout them big words eh?) and we were all like fuck you we became a country.  and because of those russians building their piece of shit nuclear reactors in ukraine, everyone is dying of cancers.  good thing i lived in poltava, which isnt even close to chernobyl.  so its all chill.  but then again its not.  thats weak dude.  thats like if america was to dump nuclear waste all over mexico and say it all never happened......which im pretty sure america already does.  wow i get smarter by doing these big projects.  i hope i dont get caught for plagiarizing though.  mr burt was all like "i will crush your soul and banish you to the seventh abyss of hell if you plagiarize."   then he also said that "i will call your parents up and well have a meeting and I WILL MAKE YOU CRY!!!"  so im just a bit nervous....just a bit.  mr burt is intense, but he is the coolest teacher i have probably ever had.  the name says it all: burt.  to bad its burt with a 'u'.  bert with an 'e' is the way to go.  but anyways, i didnt plagiarize, i think.  damn there were several sentences that i couldnt rephrase so i had to plagiarize.  ahh i dont want him to crush my soul.  help!

      so thursday im all like, i would like it very much if i skated today.  i get my board, and kick it to stamford.  on the way there i remember noticing how good the weather was, not as hot as wednesday.  so i finally get down there and daniel is the only one skating and hes really tired.  we slap high fives and all and i brought my money with me to get a new deck.  so im like, dude lets hit up the 44.  hes like you want deck?  and im like yea i do.  so we walk there and just talk about stuff.  like how bobby talks trash to everyone, even to him.  saying stuff like you suck and all and being all like i saw this kid, hes like 10 and he can do this amazing trick and hes been skating for 1 year.  or something like that, you know?  so that just makes me mad at bobby because he was saying that danny sucks and daniel is like one of the sickest skaters i know.  so we get into this whole conversation about this and that and just about the skate scene there in stamford.  supposedley brian is starting some skating magazine and want to get footage of everyone.  thats cool and all, but i dont really see how that will work out.  but im willing to help out.  anyways, we finally get to 44 board and start looking for decks.  i automatically spot out my deck to be.  the pink stripes zero.  it is sooo hot.  i had to go through all the choices before i made my descision.  so i finally bought it and the dude there was putting on the griptape while me and danny were talking about this brazilian dude with no legs that skates with his hands.  thats just amazing and hilarious at the same time.  he was telling me how he has this european competition video with him in it.  and he does tre flips and handrails...on this hands!!!  he has like stubs for legs, so he stands on it with his stubbs and puts his hands on the side of the deck and does sick tricks.  that is just amazing.  i would pay so much to see that.  doing a handrail on your hands, just imagine how hard that is.  and if you cant imagine that, trust me, it is very very hard.  the dude there finally finished my grip job after what seemed like so long.  it was kind of shitty, but it didnt matter at that point.  ill polish it up at home, i told myself, and we were on our way to skate.  we go back to the circle and meet up with some kids there, rodrigo, walter, and alex.  there were these girls walking by, foreigners from what i could tell, and daniel and walter and everyone were checking them out and making all these obscene getures.  this one girl then came and sat on one of the benches and wanted to take a picture there.  everyone im skating with there run up and sit down next to her and hug her and do bunny ears.  it was the funnies thing.  they just blatantly got in her picture.  then when the girls were walking away, daniel and walter kept screaming "I WANT AFRICAN SEX" in their spanish accents while humping their boards which was just hilarious.  good times.  so were skating and all, and im like, i need to get my noseslides back, because im horrible at them now.  so i get some speed, i am constantly eyeing my object, concentrating on foot placement, proper ollie.  i go for it....bam.  im down on the ground.  i suck.  what happened goes like this.  i ollie and turn my body and get the board too high so the wheels or on the bench.  i put my weight on the nose to slide.  the board shoots out the other way taking out my foot underneath me.  i come straight down on the concrete bench with my shoulder and hip.  and it hurt.  it makes me mad that i fell that bad on such an easy trick.  thats what i get for not skateboarding.  so i get up and everything hurts, but im alright.  i walk it off.  but the thing that got me so mad was this kid, rodrigo i think it was.  ive skated with him before but i wasnt sure what his name was.  well the thing is, i get up and hes laughing his ass off.  holy shit, i was about to spaz so bad on him.  i very rarely get mad.  i hardly get stressed when i skate too.  but this time it just hit the switch.  i just saw red for like a second then went back to my usual cool, calm, and collected self.  but it made me really made that he was laughing when i fell.  you jsut dont do that.  thats so gay.  and he didnt even skate at all.  he just put his board down and lurked around as everyone else skated.  which also pissed me off.  now i really hate that kid and i will never have respect for him.  other than that little incident, the day was mine.  i landed a smooth f/s boardslide on the bench and a fakie tailslide on the bench for the first time.  it was very exciting.  i got mad props for that.  we then went to skate prudential, in which we got the boot.  so we just went to the back 2 stair and just did switch ollies off and nollies off.  it was fun.  this is when i found out why rodrigo wasnt doing anything at the cirlce benches.  he couldnt even ollie the two stair.  at first i was like, is that switch, because it was horrible.  and hes like no.  and i felt really bad i said that.  even for him.  i am a sympathetic kid.  but he couldnt even ollie the two stair, so i guess were even.  oh yea he also laughed when danny kickflipped the four and fell.  i held myself back.  alex told me later that hes always like that.  i was pretty tired and beat up, so i decided to go home with my brand new deck a little early.  i usually go home at around 8:30 but this time i left at 8:00.  i got home later that day and my shoulder hurt so bad.  my hip was bruised hard and i had a huge bruise on teh side of my knee, which kills.  all in all, a good day.  well, coming home early would prove to be a very very good descision.  i put my board away and brought my deck inside to show my brother that i got a new deck.  he was like whoa a new deck...nice.  well during the excitement, we heard the door open, and it was my mom!  aahhh.  and as im not allowed to skate, a deck would prove to be a bad thing for her to see.  and we were in our parents room at teh time, because they moved the computer there because they thougt it was descrtacting us from our studies.  so were both like holy shit.  he stuffs the deck under the bed and im still in my dirty jeans and tee shirt that ive been rolling around in the dirt in, i wait for her to turn her back to go into the kitchen to put the groceries in the fridge, then i make a run for my room, very silently.  i make it and i quickly get changed.  but im still perspirating from skating so im all like, uhh, i went running again.  dude and it worked.  she was like, oh youre so committed.  that was a close call.  a very close call.  they leave to maine friday morning so she was doing some last minute shopping.  wow, i am so lucky i chose to come home early.  i still cant believe it.  so the deck stayed under their bed for the night and luckily they didnt find it.  it was in enemy territory for a few hours, but after school on friday, after a lenghty school bus delay at the DHS, i came home to rescue it.  my parents were gone by then so i just threw it down on my bed.  i rested for the next few hours.  just doing nothing.  enjoying my freedom.  i heard these kids were gonna get togher to play some soccer so i though id join them.  we went to royal and played for a good hour and a half.  then i put on my sambas, took olivers board and went to skate the seven.  and that made me realize how hard it is to skate in sambas.  i couldnt ollie it.  i couldnt do the seven.  i got very close but then the board slid out as i landed.  i was mad at myself.  but i also hurt my heel from bailing and coming down on it multiple times as sambas are really thin and dont protect your foot.  i ended up leaving empty handed and feeling bad.  i got back home all hot and sweaty and i didnt even bother taking a shower.  i just changed into my skating clothes and was out the door in about 30 minutes.  on my way to stamford to skate with mad peeps.  it felt good going there knowing that you can be out all you want and no one will bother you.  so i had no worries.  i arrive and see bobby and jay with his girlfriend (who by the way, is really hot).  they are like where'd you come from.  i havent seen them both in such a long time, so i was excited to skate with them.  im surprised bobby was at the circle bench bc i remember taht he hates that spot.  i was jsut skating around, bobby was talking on the phone, jay was macking it with his girl.  he was seriously macking it, he was like taking off her pants.  she was wearing a thong.  hey! i admit it, i was peeking a little.  but she didnt look too good.  she looked sick actually.  like she was gonna throw up.  i kind of felt sorry for her.  she needs a man who can treat her better.  like me.  nah whatever.  i dont really care.  we skated for a little while before more kids showed up.  bobby was showing us his amazing tech decking skills.  he can do every trick and combo it up too.  it was crazy.  everyone thought that he cheated because the tech deck jsut sticks to his fingers. he was doing some crazy things with that tech deck.  everyone was watching him bust it out.  the spotlight was on bobby.  it was actually pretty funny that everyone wanted to watch bobby tech deck and no one wanted to skate.  we finally got everyone to come to prudential with us.  after skating it for about 15 minutes security comes out.  everyone runs and hides behind these plants.  so he thinks that we left and goes back inside.  we came out of our hiding spots and started skating again.  the same thing happened again and we just hid once more.  security guard was a retard so he though we were gone for good now so he left.  we just started skating prudential again.  it was so funny.  we did that to him twice before he realized where everyone was hiding.  so finally on the third try he kicked us out.  there wasnt really antyhing else to do so we just skating this little ledge for a long time.  it was about 11:40 at this time and i really wanted to go to tylers REAL prom.  bobby wanted me to sleep over at his house but i really wanted to go to tylers gig.  i chose to go to the REAL prom.  as i was leaving, daniel shows up out of nowhere and hes all like dude ur gonna get ruffed up and killed.  a while back, he was telling me these stories about skaters getting robbed and beated up by gang members late at night.  so that kind of freaked me out.  so i booked it outta there.  i was pretty paranoid, looking over my back to see if anyone was following me.  i stopped at mcdonals to get a drink and refuel for the long road ahead.  it actually wasnt that bad or scary.  once you get passed the downtown area, its pretty chill.  it was awesome skating back because the post road was completely empty so i just skated the whole way to tylers.  it was refreshing.  i get there and they have all the lights turned off and theyre jammin' with the blacklight on.  it was pretty nice.  i had no clue who was in there.  turns out bussey was in there playing on the guitar and my brother was rocking out on the drums.  i came too late though and everyone already left so it was just like 6 people there.  then eventually people started showing up and we got the party going.  james showed up with erika, havent talked to either one of them in a really long time.  me and erika played some crazy extreme pool with the strobe light on.  it was really hard to concentrate and erika was definetely taking advantage of the minimal vision to cheat.  but she still wouldve killed me.  im horrible at pool.  then we got the rave going and it was awesome.  everyone was dancing and going crazy.  the strobe light effect made everything so much cooler.  you would see things in like a frame per second.  like if someone raised their hand, you would just see them standing still, then the next thing you would see is their hand would be raised in the air.  and you wouldnt see it go up.  thats how crazy it was.  everyone was jumping around dancing, swinging fists (tyler).  i got poked in the eye and knocked over.  tyler punched james in the stomach doing his little dance thing.  it was all very exciting.  then it got too hot and we all went outside to cool off.  then wes and ragan show up.  ragan is excited that im there, and im excited that ragan is there and its crazy.  we talk and chill.  its good stuff.  the jammin starts up and again and peeps is dancing.  Suz was really good and tylers organ solo was awesome.  then the kelly duncan song was very good too.  wheres hammer? mmkay.  haha dude that was awesome.  so eventually everyone parts and leaves except will, me, rad, bussey, rumsey, watson, and little chris.  im all of a sudden hungry, and i start eating a lot of food.  then i get a burst of energy.  so im skating in his basement and im all hyped up.  landed a few double heelflips, some varial heels, all that stuff.  i dotn remember what i was doing.  i was just jumping around.  so we all kind of decided to bust out an all nighter since it was already 3:30.  so were just talking, trying to get bussey to tell everyone his big little secret thing that happened to him at prom, and he wont tell.  we start bugging him so hopefully he would spill it.  then out of nowhere, stinch just comes down at 4 in teh morning.  talk about showing up fashionably late.  hes lucky we all decided to have an all nighter.  so sometime after he came, we all just started pissing into this strawberry mango twister bottle.  everyone contributed and we ended up filling the whole thing up all the way to the top.  stinch needed to go pee and there was no bathroom in teh basement so he just went in the twister bottle.  we ended up filling up the whole twister bottle, a gatorade bottle, and half of a two liter cherry cola bottle that night.  it was hilarious because it looked exactly like strawberry mango twister.  at about 5:30, we set out to the bay to watch the sunrise.  it took us a while to get there and we missed it too.  but it was so foggy out i dont thing we couldve seen it anyways.  so we jsut hung out on teh beach for a little.  after getting home, everyone was really tired.  we cleaned up and everyone just died and went to sleep.  my feet hurt really bad from skating all day in a 1 size smaller shoes.  it was just tiring, but fun.  i woke up at around 9 because i was cold.  i looked around and everyone was asleep.  i dont know where will went, he wasnt in his bunk.  i waited for someone to wake up for 30 minutes.  when no one did, i just decided to go home.  i got my board and left.  we should do this again sometime.  if we do, ill come on time.

      is there such a thing as pulling your jaw muscle? because i think i pulled mine.  i dont know how but it really hurts when i open my mouth and chew and all that stuff.  its weird because i have to be cautious when i eat to not open my mouth too wide.  i guess this all started when i began abusing trailmixes.  my mom comes home from cosco with this big package of trailmixes made with an all natural assortment of nuts and berries.  so im like whats this trailmix here.  and i try it and its really good.  so i start eating them and eating them and i cant stop.  the thing is, they are very good.  and i want more and more.  and i ate like the whole box of them.  thats some damn good trailmixes.  so anyways i went skating on friday, not before having some trailmixes, and it was alright.  i talked to tyler and he said that he was going to pick me up but i waited for him and he never came so i just went by myself.  i skated the circle for about 30 minutes by myself before this other kid showed up.  i remember he skated with us a while ago and he was pretty bad.  but now he is pretty decent actually.  its awesome to see the progression.  it made me sad though because i lost a lot of my tricks and was just working on getting back what i lost that day.  so were just skating and im trying to get this frontside boardslide down on the circle bench and i go for it and slide out, thus, coming down on my arm.  i get up and im all like, wow my shoulder doesnt feel too good.  i move it around and it pops a few times.  and it feels weird.  ive seen people dislocate their shoulders and so i was a bit worried because my shoulder felt pretty weird and was poping a bit.  but i could move it around so there was nothing to worry about.  i sat for a little to let the pain go away then went back to skating.  after about 30 minutes i finally landed the frontside board but it was the sketchiest landing ever.  but i kept getting so close so often.  like i would come out of it and land on the board but the board would shoot out.  that happened like 4 times so after i landed it i just went back home because that was good enough for one day.  my parents left for boston that day and i wanted to find someone who was willing to skate all night with me, but no one volunteered.  i guess thats a little hardcore but it would be awesome to do something like that.  one day i will do it, and i will be proud.  i wish i could post pictures on here.  that would be off the meat rack.

      well we finally found my mom and it ends up she was looking for us while we were looking for her and we all got mixed up and she was mad because she didnt get to go to the stores that she wanted to go and blah blah blah whatever.  i got some pizza, and it was damn good pizza too.  sbarros is very good.  i advise anyone who hasnt had sbarros to have some, and you will be amazed.  on the ride back home, listening to taking back sunday, i watched my brother boss around my mom and tell her where to go.  he always does that.  'go here' 'turn left' 'go faster' my mom always gets mad at him and yells at him and its funny to watch them argue.  he tries to boss me around but i show him whos boss.  anyways, after i got home, i forgot what happened, but somehow i ended up watching the proffesional with jean reno on bravo.  ( i hate it when you have blank spots when you forget what happened on that day but remember what happened later on, its like a part of your life thats not there.  just like indian trading that me and ragan discussed.  like when the indians traded their land to the white men in exchange for their lives, but then the cherokees tried buy it back with fireworks and casinos.  so then the white men got mad and killed everyone and stole lacrosse from them for being such assholes about the whole land stealing thing.  the end. )  the movie was sick though.  jean reno is like this hitman dude and he gets paid to take people out, also known as "cleaning", and this family that lives next to him is like weird and all and they have a little girl who hates them because they treat her bad.  so one day these guys come for the drugs that the dad had and he had like a partial amount so they just blew him away and his whole family while the little girl was at the store buying milk.  so she gets home and goes to her neighbors jean renos house and he lets her in and she is mad at them for killing her little brother.  and jean reno is all like, i will be nice to you.  so he lets her sleep.  and the little girl is all mad and shes like i want you to teach me how to clean.  and hes like no way dude, youre only a chick.  and shes all like crying and saying that they killed her little bro.  so he starts teaching her and its awesome.  so then one day at the store, she sees the lead guy and she follows him to the cop station and finds out that hes actually a cop.  so the next day she goes to the cop station packin' major heat and she wants to kill him but he is all like im going to kill you but then this guy comes in and hes like dude johnny is dead or whatever.  he was doing business with the chinks and they say that a crazy hitman came in and killed everyone.  so hes all sad and leaves her alone.  the little chicks name is matilda i forgot to say that.  so then they tied her up and jean reno comes in to save her killing these guys while at it.  and its awesome because the lead guy gets all the swat teams and the whole police force after him and they come to his house and they go in.  but hes on the roof!!!!  and he just starts killing people like crazy and its so awesome!!  so then they shoot a bazooka and its all smoking and no one can see anything and jean reno somehow gets into a swat suit and looks like one of them and hes injured and all and they treat him.  and while this is all happening matilda ran away with his best friend, this plant that he loves.  so then the lead guy spots jean reno in the swat suit and he shoots him down.  and hes on the ground bleeding and hes all like dude i have a  present for you from matilda.  and he hands the head dude this clip.  and hes all like whats this.  and he opens jean renos vest and he has like 6 grenades in there and the whole place just explodes.  it was such a good movie.  i loved it.  everyone should see it.  the matilda chick is like super crazy and jean reno is the man.  i dont watch or like that many movies but this one was really good.  they also drank a lot of milk in that movie.  i guess its like supposed to promote dairy products.  weird.  and since everyone is doing this month thing quiz i decided to give it a shot and its actually true, for teh most part.  pretty amazing.

      i had so much to write about like two days ago.  i said to myself, i am going to blog alot.  but now, i cant remember anything that happened.  crap dude, i really wanted to blog about something but i cant remember.  whats the deal!  that is whack.  i need to have better access to a computer.  that doesnt make sense because i already do.  but, its weird.  so anyways, im back into skating, finally, and it is very good.  very very good.  i cant believe i was thinking about quitting.  im so stupid.  but now i have lost all of my skillz and all.  so its time to get serious and get those back.  i have been skating stamford lately, as usual.  that seems to be the only place i skate anymore.  the kids there consider me a local.  that weird.  we were talking about kids from other towns, and i said something like im a kid from out of town, and they were like nah youre a local.  so i was like that is very chill.  i dont remember when that was, maybe thursday.  but we got kicked out a lot that day.  after skating the circle we went to prudential, known as wachovia now, but it will always be prudential to me.  we skated there and it was sick.  walter busted out a backside tailslide and daniel did a nollie noseslide which was so nice.  i was getting tailslides and i was really stoked on that.  we got kicked out of there in like 20 minutes and the guy was all like, the administrator isnt even going to come out here anymore, hes just gonna call the cops everytime he sees you guys.  so we went to the double four.  it was all daniel.  man this kid got so much better.  hes insane now!  back in the day, me and him used to be pretty evenly matched.  he was just a bit better.  but now, hes like the best in stamford.  hes insane.  at the double four, he did the longest noseslide ive seen, then backside 50-50 shove it out.  but it wasnt like a weak bs 50 50.  it was a hardcore one.  like grind for a while, then shove it out.  man he is good.  after getting kicked out of there, we went to the twin towers hubba.  that was so sketchy.  we had to all wait across the street while danny sneaked in and waxed it.  everytime some girl walked by everyone would howl and make orgasm noises.  even to ugly chicks and chicks with babies.  i decided not to take part in that and just sat and laughed at them being retarted.  then after danny waxed the hubba, we all went in and started to skate it.  danny 50 50 it and it was hot.  the hubba is whack though bc its all cracked and has a pole at the end of it.  but since daniel is sick he did it anyways.  then this fat security guy kicked us out.  we went to skate this other building and daniel was soo good.  i just sat and watched in amazement.  he is sick.  we went to 44 board and they had some awesome zero decks there so i was there for like 30 minutes admiring them.  then the gang took me to this crazy bank.  it was awesome.  i was just like a parking lot with a slanted bank with parking block things on top.  i wanted to skate it so bad, but a tenant dude that lived in the condominiums there gave us this 10 minute speech about how he was going to call the cops bc we skate tehre the move aroudn teh parking blocks and dont put them back and how we ruin the neighborhood.  it was pretty funny actually and i was laughing the whole time.  he seemed to get pretty aggravated so we jsut left.  "ill ba back".  so then that was it.  i went home.  friday was the day to skate.  i wanted to skate the bank, but i got home and i was mad tired so i took a nap.  woke up at around 7 and tehre was no point in going to stamford bc of a lack of time.  so i just watched tv and did nothing.   i also counted my money, and i have 64 bucks.  that enough for a deck.  the zero deck that i crave so much for. but my deck is in good enough shape and i also have another complete that is perfectly good.  the complete that i bought off clay for 40 bucks.  but now he wants it back bc hes getting back into skating but im already back into skating so i need it myself.  so you see how that works out.  saturday i went and played soccer for about 2 hours but everyone left after coach chase showed up to play with the men, so i decided to book it.  later on me my bro and my mom went to the big palisades mall.  i go there for the sbarros pizza (which is the best pizza ever) and for teh zumies.  i checked out zumies and it was pretty chill, they had some very good decks which i wanted.  but i didnt make a purchase.  walking around the mall was boring and stupid.  there were some hot chicks but most were ugly and fat and the pretty ones were checking out my hot brother.  we decided to meet at this shoe store place after we were done looking around.  after about and hour and a half me and my bro went to the shoe place but my mom wasnt there.  so then we go to some other boring stores and go back to the shoes store to see if my mom is still tehre.  ahh, this is the most boring entry ever.  i need more excitement in my life.
