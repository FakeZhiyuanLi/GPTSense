      An intersting dicsussion in Youth Group today. We were discussing the importance of the Ten Commandents, linking them to the two biggies Jesus pointed out, when the conversation turned to religion in school. A couple views were expressed but I could barely get mine out for whatever antisocial reasons that be. The overwhelming majority thought Christianity should receive some special treatment as it was the basis for our government. I personally believe that this is kind of weak. While I truly believe my religion to be true and that it is important to spread it to others (evangelization), I also believe the government shouldn't give us any more help then it absolutely needs to. The government, in my mind, should be completely impartial to all belief groups. While the only-Christian preference of the early years worked, right now we are too diverse to do any major religious interference without a huge backlash by all the other underrepresented religions. One of the great faults of the US government has been the misunderstanding that atheism is impartiality, thus leading to its promotion in our schools and laws. The government should just give us the basics: here are the big religions and belief systems, here's what they do and think. You choose, we won't judge them or you. The only way I can rationalize the promotion of Chrstian standards in government would be under the pretense of a code of morality. The Christian morality states this (e.g. adultery is bad), I found this to be true and harmful to society as a whole, let us make a law against it.

      Yesterday, I went to Calvin College for "Friday's at Calvin". It was a real eye-openner. Calvin is a college based around my personal belief system, Calvinism, and I truly felt at home there. I stayed in 2 Beor, which I find out later to be the Jock hall. Blast! Why does my life keep getting more confusing and complex?! I was all happy with my logical prejudice against all Jocks, then I met these guys and it just goes up in flames. The college student I roomed with was going into PreSeminary, which allowed me to ask a few questions. His friends were curtious and witty, and also talked to me about colleges. They had a Bible study that night, so I got to tag along. It actually answered one of my Great Theological Questions of Life (tm). I learned that the command of Jesus to "turn the other cheek", "walk the extra mile" and such should be followed until it damages the communion and fellowship which is another vital command of God: "I was glad when they said unto me 'Let us go into the house of the Lord'". The previously mentioned examples did not interfere or harm the commands, and therefore are good. The next day, Friday, I got to go to an actual class: History of Philosophy. I wanted to go to a Religion class, as that  will  be my major, but this was the next best thing. Surprisingly, it wasn't mercilessly confusing, but only a light brain-numbing sensation. I'm definitely considered a Philosophy Major or Minor. At the luncheon, I sat next to a Philosophy Prof. and another Friday student interested in Philosophy. Imagine my surprise when she tells us she wants to go into Missions! She seemed to have her heart set on a college called Moody Bible Institute, but was looking at Calvin for kicks and giggles. I'm intrigued by this Moody. I suppose I must add it to the growing (and shrinking) list of colleges I have to check out.

      A sad day in MS Debate. It seems Cam Shunta, easily the best debater on our team, decided to back out. The other two varsity debaters will not be returning, leaving me as the last of the varsity debaters! Cam steped down due to verbal abuse and underappreciation from all the Debate team. I felt terrible. As I explained in my Debate portfolio, I admit I've made fun of Cam on several occasions, but realize that they were foolishness. It really made me think about the things I say in fun which can be taken incorrectly. Cam is an awesome guy and a legendary debater, and I truly hope he reconsiders.   I went to Hage's and bought a Bible cover for the Bible I received at Christmas. It was a thoughtful journey. Going to Hage's reminds me of the commercialization Christianity has gone through. Christian message cards, necklaces, pens, markers, and books upon books line the store walls. I think of the original days of Christianity where your only form of Christian merchandise was a quickly scribbled ichthus symbol on the ground. Perhaps it would be better to return to those days and perhaps not. If you find enlightenment from Christians book, then read them. If you hear God in Christian music, then listen indeed. If not, then don't.  Tonight's First Priority leader's meeting ended late and for good reason. We got sucked into a wonderful discussion of denominational doctrine, sacraments, and the walls between denomanations. It was a fulfilling experience. I personally believe that while denominational preference is fine and dandy, it should be set aside when we come together as the Body. What are these petty fights compared to the great truth we all know and love?

      I barely talked at all today. On any other day, that would be nothing, another status quo day of silent contemplation or just empty head syndrome. But today is Sunday, and I should damn well be fellowshipping! My times at church, catechism, mission trip meeting, and youth group were all spent in silence. A rare interjecting, a uncommon spoken word. But almost nothing. It is beginning to become unsettling even to me. I know I'm a loner, but my church time should be spent learning, asking question about God and to him. Strange and sad.  During youth group, one of my...acquaintances began talking about staring at the beautiful chicks in such and such a place. I told him I was trying to avoid that kind of thing and his jaw dropped. I could almost imagine the thoughts floating through his head. Loser. Homosexual. Self-righteous prick. Hell, I'd described myself as these sometimes. The reason I tend to escape any sexual interaction, even weak and useless stuff like ogling that occasional set of knockers, is a twisted and painful tale. Let's just say I've had a hard time with an Internet pornagraphy addiction, and ogling should be the last damnable action on my to-do list. Its ironic. He talked about watching out for thongs. That's how my addiction began. With looking at thong pics. *sigh* Life's depressing sometimes. Suck it up and pray.

      I went to John Givenneti's (sp) house today. John is a interesting man in the higher tiers of age (at least 70). And he rocks. You just don't expect an elderly man like him to be so happy, friendly, and talkative. My original stereotype of the "old man" is a grumpy lump of wrinkles living between shots of Valium. He killed that mold. Mr. Givenneti is the greatest conversationalist I known, and it is a great pleasure to listen to what he says. Mostly all I do is nod, drink root beer, and interject an occasional statement, but that is just fine for me. I'm a listener, not a talker. He talked about many things: using newspaper as insulation, meeting Babe Ruth, listening to the Pope preach in 7 languages, a Pennslyvanian who owned a mine, a friend he knew who threatened to break down the door if he wasn't let in at a hospital in WWII, a man nicknamed Maps who always was with his maps, a guy nicknamed Colonel because he looked like the Colonel, the real colonel walking up and down the ranks talking to random men, old women knitting as they walked their cows home in France and Italy, a friend from the Humane Society who wouldn't give dogs to certain people because they would use the dogs in animal fights, and this is all in one day. Today, my Mom and I did something special and got them some roast beef sandwiches from Arby's. They hadn't had burgers in a long time.   We showed them a project I did for my Debate class that I got a 60/60 on. I was quite proud of my work there. It really came straight from the heart and was a pleasure to write. Mr. G and his friend Cindy were very pleased by it and demanded that I start writing more, and bring some of it in sometime.  Also, on the trip to Arby's, I bought a nonbleeding highlighter for my Bible. Fun stuff. A fulfilling day.

      A friend of mine made an interesting Matrix analogy: God is love. Love is blind. Neo is blind. Neo can fly. Time flies. Time is money. Money is the root of all evil. Therefore, God is the root of all evil.   Finished the Loners' Manifesto today. It was a good book, and helped explain some of my little personality quirks (such as reading, ironically). For all intents and purposes, I am a loner. While there are deviations from the rule, I still lack true interest in society at large and prefer my own society-of-two (there's always room for God, even if he is the root of all evil). One of the deviations is fellowship with my Christian fellows. While I can find solace and guidance on nature walks and in the quiet of my room, without youth group or church meetings, I would not be as far in my faith.  Finally ended the great sojourn of Alma. I turned in my check without delay after school. Now all I have to do is go.  A terrible thing happened today. I got a ticket for parking to far out into the road. Now, one of the reasons I even started this blog is to vent my anger against whatever dares to strike me the wrong way. But I can't vent against this one. The verdict is true. I thought several times that I should try parking closer to the curb, and watched with a twinge of anxiety as cars had to move around mine. I only wish the disgruntled neighbor would have talked it out with me instead of bringing the Law onto my tail. Too bad. Such is the cost of lonerdom.

      Antoher homework-induced-pain day at school. Humdrum  I forgot to mention on Monday, but another awesome thing happened at B & N. While getting our coffee and frappes, Mom asked if someone could use her card without her being there. They said yes if you can give the phone number on the card. Score! This is like Hermes coming down from the sky and saying ambrosia, food of the gods, is now 10% off. I'm a regular at our Barnes and Noble and can commonly be found staring at any title, but mostly in the sci-fi/fantasy or Christian sections.  Finally, got to turn in the application to you-know-what. One step closer. Now I have to pay the $40 fee.

      It seems that yesterday's collection was a harbringer of pain to come. Today's school activities were the pleasure equivalent of a knee to the crotch. Late homework, work I didn't even know was due, new homework...blah! But on a positive note, my mother has finally decided to let me go to Alma Youth Mix! Oh, joy! Now it is all a matter of turning in the application before Thursday...it  can  be done.  Of the books I bought recently, I began to read the Loners' Manifesto first. It basically is a grand overview of all things antisocial including history, mistruths, and other lonerisms. While this book is overall good and very well written, I've begun to pick up little flaws in the writer's philosophy. I've got three so far:  1.  The world is devided into two groups: loners and nonloners   I find this false because I am only a partial loner, brought up by a pure loner Dad and another loner-nonloner mix Mom. Basically this means I find joy in both "loner" activities such as music, art, reading, etc. as well as "nonloner" activities such as youth group, concerts, and dicussing things. While I am mostly a loner, rarely talking and commonly walking off or separating myself from the group, I still enjoy being part of the mob. I draw my water from both rivers and am full.  2.  Loners are always being put done by the majority nonloners  This may be linked to the fact that I am not a truth loner, but I have rarely if ever been mistreated or insulted for my loner ways. People tend to accept me as I am or ignore me. Worst case scenario, I'm misjudged and found annoying.  3.  Masturbation is a fun and interesting hobby for loners  When she first started talking about masturbation it was as a stereotype for loners and almost appearing a bad thing. I was relieved. Then she started promoting it and that relief died. I have done persverse and stupid things in my life, but suprisingly masturbation is not one of them. I thing she is only projecting the stereotype she reviled earlier by saying it is actually an okay thing. Masturbation....Ungh! I hope I never have to mention it again on this blog!  An interesting topic came up in English class today. My friend was talking about the personality test she took involving convergent/divergent minds and the conversation turned to revolutionary/fascist personalities. I myself am a diehard anti-statist. I loathe our government and almost all others as they are corrupt focal points of power. I also expressed my wish to burn down the White House. Now, let me clear up some facts about that before the FBI breaks in. I would first evacuate the White House of all personnel. As they left, I would had out complimentary mints and express my deep regret that they would have to lose their current employment. I would then commense in torching that building with the true and grand glee found in all pyrotechnics and arsonist. There is a little arsonist in everyone. Mine came out and gave a lecture today.

      A great day with a nasty end to end a grand 4 day weekend.  "The world was shocked when The Dan Study Center was overrun by nuerons. One of the observing scientists explains, 'We were watching the last nueron die off when somehow it got a Circus Peanut. Then there were thousands...thousands of them! Then they escaped the skull and started attacking us. Nuerons just don't do that!'"  I've developed a love/obsession with Cirus Peanuts. These are the inch-long orange peanut-shaped pieces of pure sugar. By pure I mean concentrated until it forms a new phase of matter beyond solid, a super compact lattice structure of sugar. Some say they are too sweet. To these I reply, "Duh!" That's what they're supposed to be! Sugar! SUGAR! SUUUUUGAAAAAR!  The day started with my Mom calling First Presbyterian Church about Alma Youth Mix. She sounds impressed by what the pastor said which helps. The youth pastor seems to be on a break so she didn't learn enough to finalize, but it will be so. The deadline doesn't seem to be a problem anymore so I won't worry to much about that. Until tomorrow for my next attempts.  Then we went to Barnes and Noble, my dream house. Really, if I could live anywhere, it would be in the basement of a B & N, living off frappecinos and prepacked sandwiches. But that's just me.  I ended up buying three books: Party of One: The Loners' Manifesto by Anneli Rufus, Fast Food Nation by Eric Schosser, and Massage by Bernie Rowen. Fast Food Nation is for the Literary Review Club and I have to admit, it looks like a good one. The foreward about the Cheyenne Mountain military base and Domino's delivery made me drool. Massage I bought because I have been a little envious of people who give and receive casual massages. I want this power, and books can give it to me. I chose this one because it involves the least number of nude people (a positive for my mother as well) and was on sale (Dutch frugality strikes!). I ended up finding Party of One on that table by the little Starbucks. For those that don't even vaguely know me, I am rather a "loner" and it looks to be a great read.  The final occurance was collecting payment for my paperroute. This is that negative ending I was talking about. Now, the standard collection is always a drag, involving my ripping the green from my clients' icy grip. But this one happened at 7:00, in the cold, and after a fight with my mom over dropping some payments during a delivery. Not fun.

      Having a great and relaxing 4 day weekend. My mind has almost completely vegitated. Scientists are saying the last nueron will die approximately 5:12 P.M Monday. Bring the kids!  I've heard through the grape vine that our pastor-hopeful will be a newb. For the uniformed among my crowd of adoring fans (cue grasshoppers), my church is currently sans head pastor. We have Ron, and he rocks, but I still like idea of a young pastor. We need some new blood in our little crypt pitstop of a church.  Tried to drop off an application to the Alma Youth Mix 04 but no one was at the First Presbyterian Church at 12:30ish. Understandable but unsatisfying. I will go to this "Mix" come hell, high water, or ninja monkeys. Blast those ninja monkeys! Why must they hunt me?! My mum is still questioning whether she will let me go, but I will win her over to the dark...I mean...light...side. This Mix sounds like a lot of fun, and I'm always up for a theological escapade (Bless you, Thesaurus. You have taught me well).

      When I asked myself if I really wanted to start a blog, I started by asking who I know has such a blog. I found that only the interesting, intelligent, and (greatest majority) the insane have blogs. I know I fit one of these categories (guess :)) so I started this blog.   This blog will be a no-holds bars release of all the juicy fun things whirling around between my ears. I'll try to keep the language civil, but this is the Internet after all. You have to keep some minimum obsenity going.  This blog will be updated on a complex and developed schedule based on cosmic formations, chemical balances within my brain, and a mathematical equation I based of lemon jello. I promise to keep diligently to this schedule.

      Yesterday was a rush. It all started in 3rd hour with the video. You remember, don't you? That grotesque twisting of reality, designed specificly to embarass me and frighten small children? Well, it has been shown. I had my head under my arms for the whole showing. From what I heard, it received good reviews.  With my brain thoroughly burnt from all that mental torture, I did the only thing any standard idiot would do: finish the mind-bending book I started a couple weeks ago, "God and the Philosophers." Without question, it was the most difficult book I've read...ever. I find it funny that in several of the testimonies the philospophers described a book about philosophy they would read in their youth and only vaguely understand. The book had an interesting twist at the end. The last two testimonies were from Jewish philosophers. An interesting move, I'd say. I wasn't sure how to react to someone of a radically different faith than I, but surprisingly their views were very close to mine. This kind of opened a little window in the world of another's spiritual world I could only begin to imagine. It was fun.

      Forgot to mention; Yesterday, my mother, sister, and I went out and looks for birthday presents. For my birthday. Yes,  my  birthday. Apparently, this is the custom among other families, but it is an extreme rarity in my nuclear family. I ended up getting some very strong hiking boots, a tank of gasoline, and looked at tents.  Youth group makes me sad. As stated, I find the last bastion of quasi-fellowship in church. But recently, I feel more aloof, less connected, as though I do not belong here. I feel like a puzzle piece sitting in the hand of the Great Puzzler staring down at the unfinished puzzle. I know I belong somewhere in that great connective collective, but where?  Thoughts have turned to prom even though it is months away. I plan to ask Emily to it. I hope I haven't asked too late. I know women like to look extremely good for these kind of special occasions. I just hope she won't feel rushed.  Mental note: Should I ever rejoin the world of multiplayer gaming, I will take on the alias "Gravefeeder." Just because.  Mental note: I use too many sentences with the subject "I". Fix that.

      If you could erase a painful memory and never have to remember it again, would you do so? I believe Emily (as I speak this word, a dove flies free from my mouth) said it best and I will do my best to paraphrase: "No, I wouldn't. I believe memories sculpt us into who we are." Or something to that degree. Methinks I'll take that up a notch. God sculpts us through our memories and events. I love the idea that everything I do or is done to me is like a Godly chisel scraping away a piece of marble from the sculpture of my life. Emily was completely charming, as usual. Our conversation after the movie turned and twisted all the way to her driveway. Oh, yes. And there were cookies. Girl Scout cookies to be exact. The tasty screams of still recognizable Samoas echo in my tummy. I regret not giving some to my date though. That was rude. But even with that, it was a   night.

      Spring is finally here...for now. Michigan tends to play with its inhabitants' minds when it comes to weather. Rain followed by snow then to sunshine......BOOM! Tornado! This morning a beautiful fog lay over the land. I like the fog. I like most natural occurences, but the fog I like for a specific reason. It hides; it covers indiscriminately. It has an almost chameleon-like affect, protecting those who do not want to be seen. Too bad it did not cover me.  My "secret" dating life is out. I don't know why I liked it as a secret. My personal life tended to be ignored  and for good reason: I didn't have one. But now that I do have a "life", I am subjected to the scrutiny of my peers. The word got out by way of my fellow dater. It left her lips, travelled through her friend, and on to a pal of mine. I don't know why I bother with the Internet. Gossip and knowledge travels so much faster on the System. Yes, friends, the System. This great behemoth is the interconnected discussion wonder of humanity that has been around since the beginning. I'm sure Adam and Eve were thoroughly Systemized. I have to admit, this is my first true run-in with the System. I've always lived in outcast-style nonconnectedness. I'm not sure I like being plugged in to the System. Meh *shrugs*

      Currently legal. Anybody else think that the recently missiled Hamas leader looked stunningly similar to Saruman in LOTR?  Worked at Fazoli's to raise money for my mission trip. $81 and odd cents were made, but that divided mongst the 15 or so of us doesn't really amount to much.  Questions...riddles in the dark...precious. Ah, yes. Another thing happened on Saturday I forgot to mention. I saw LOTR ROTK in the Plaza. Best $2.50 I've ever spent. It was IMHO best than the first time I saw it. By then I've overcome my pet peeves about their interpretation of the great work and could enjoy the movie for what it was: an awesome action flick. I could look at Elrond in the face and not think Matrix. Some points in the movie which seems dead serious the first viewing were wonderfully cheesy. Once again the homosexual innuendos set off a Gollum discussion in my mind which went a little like this:  Gollum: They're gay, my precious, yessssssss. Smeagol: Nononononono. They're just happy to see each other, dearest. Just happy, not gay. Gollum: They're three short men jumping in a bed, precious. Smeagol: Look. Pippin caught the flowers and looked at that pretty hobbitesssss. He can't be gay. Gollum: He could be bi. Smeagol: I'm not listening!  In the end, I decided to choose the "really good friends" theory as an absolute. They  were  simply happy to see each other. In real life, you can't just randomly choose paradigms as absolutes, but in movies I find solace in it.

      Breaking the LAW! As proclaimed from the saintly halls of the Learning Center, Dan says, "Hi."  Life is good. My date on Saturday went well. Said datee was truly interesting in the fact that she is equally as crazy as I am. (screams from the halls: "say it ain't so, Dan!"). Yes, her inzane love of tangents and mutations are parallel to mine. Should she ever decide to read this, Jiffy's taking over the island on 902nd street.

      As the world continues to turn, my thoughts turn to the future. I wonder where God is leading me as this is the way I see things. God has some freekin' awesome path figured out for my life, whether I like it or not. But right now I don't see it. I'm going to college. Of that much, I am certain. Where? For what? That's the stinker. I've pretty much narrowed my dream colleges down to two: Oklahoma Wesleyan University and Calvin College. Calvin I've been to and OKWU I will go to at the end of March. Calvin is a more accepting quasi-liberal (in the sense of theology) college, while OKWU holds to a more conservative stance. Calvin is a huge, slightly expensive college with tons of possible majors, while OKWU is less expensive, about 1/8 in size, and a more limited selection. That set aside, if I go to Calvin, I would double major in Religion and Philosophy, then go on to graduate school to get something else, maybe a Masters in Divinity. Were I to go to OKWU, I would take the studies in the Persecuted Church major and either go to grad school or straight to the missions field. That's the other stinker. What is needed? Immediate action or higher education? My mom believes I don't need that grad schooling, but I don't know. And should I really go into Philosophy? What good will that do me in the field? Questions, Questions...  Debate Banquet is coming up. This is the culmination of all that was Debate this year. It was really fun and good last year. It is at Topo's this year, which means truly great food.

      I'm beginning to believe my spiritual escapades are forming a self-fulfulling prophecy. At Alma they spoke of the enevitability of doubt, and in my recent reading,  God and the Philosophers , every philosopher so far has dropped away from the faith during their upper high school/college years. Am I doomed to follow this path of denial then reacceptance? I hope not. I'm also beginning to see a bunch of other similarities between the testimonies of these philosophers and my current life. Perhaps I will study philosophy...  Don't bother reading the rest of this. You've been warned,  I have decided that English is a inherently flawed system of dicussion and must be destroyed. Leave nothing to infect the other langauges. This recent uprising of anti-English hatred is brought to you by my recent influx of grammar rules in Am/Lit 11. Most specifically rules #2 and #10.  Rule #2: A verb in a dependent clause agrees with the subject of the clause; in other words, with the phrase "one of these," the verb that follows will be plural. E.G. Alice is one of those students who always receive an "A".  The first flaw is the ambiguity of were the clauses truly begin and end.   Alice is (one of those students who always receive an "A".)  Alice is one (of those students) (who always receive an "A").  Alice is (one of those students) (who always receive an "A").  I suppose the first example can easily be thrown out. But I personally believe the 3rd makes more sense than the 2nd. Wait...Wait...Dang it! This begins to freekin' make sense! Why? Why does English torture me so? Argument retracted.  Rule #10: A singular and a plural subject joined by "or" or "nor" take a verb that agrees with the nearer subject. E.G. Either the judge or the lawyers are wrong.  This can be defeated mathematically. As judge is singular it therefore must be 1 judge. As lawyers is plural, they therefore must be a group greater than or equal to 2, so let us assume the lowest possibility and say there are two lawyers. Since there is no indication of extraneous variables affecting outcome, we can also assume that probablity will be exact... Damn this is boring. Argument retracted.

      My brain feels violated. It is as if a cloister of microscopic nuns marched into my ears and cut my gray matter in ribbons, while discussing hockey over gin and tonics. I broke the unspoken law of solemnity that guides all great philosophers and thinkers. Follow? I did perhaps  the  most embarrassing video for A.P. Govt. In it, I lost any scraping of decency and went hogwild. It should be fun to get reactions from the fellow A.P.ers.   But I get ahead of myself. For the past 2 days, I have been at Alma College. My great reaping of checks, phone calls, and discussions has finally brought harvest. I'm kind of disappointed. It wasn't the childish energizers (or ice breakers or singalongs or what have you), because I expected that. It wasn't the antics of several of my fellow wanderers 'long the path towards God, because I expect this as well. It was the lack of discussion. I don't talk a lot (duh!). But when I do, I do so to learn or teach or incite happiness. Too much of the latter has occured. I did not learn as much as I would have in a free-flowing democracy of intellect. The irony is, that is almost what the keynote was preaching. She spoke of tying your rope to the foundation of your church, then going off to search, knowing you are free to return. In a way, I did this even by going to this Mix, as I am Christian Reformed and this was Presbyterian. At least a little discussion about Islam and the Diety of Christ placated my needs on the way back home.  I received a compliment today. Common people would shrug at this and say, "uhhhhhhh, so?" A while after expressing my heartfelt belief in the constant interaction and assistance of God in this world, I was spotted while trying to get my Bible. A girl said something to the tone of he is the most intelligent, awesome guy you'll ever meet. This frightened me. Not the compliment itself, as it was most kind, but the possible reactions. As most Christians boys and girls, I've had the negative concept of pride taught, drilled, beaten, and self-flaggelated into my psyche. Hearing such a sweeping compliment set off more than a few bells and whistles in that memory department. I am in constant alert against such things, always ready to mentally look to God and question, "What shall I respond in accordance with your will?" His answer is between Him and me. Reading what I just read frightens me again. Do not assume me to be some great theologian or prophet. I am a fool, a beggar in priestly robes.

      Family, forgive me for this rant...  I am beginning to REALLY dislike my family, except for my sister. Because of her calm attitude and generally undemanding ways, I cannot be angry at her. But my parents, my brother, even myself I loathe profusely! My mother recently went on a bloody rant about how our house is soooo messy and how Dad doesn't like coming home because it is messy. Firstly, who is Dad to hate coming home to a messy house he shared a part in making messy? Freekin' hypocrite!   And my mother! She nags and nags and nags about my hair, my room, and just about every part of my life she has a connection to. Maybe that's why I tried my damndest to keep her out of my life. Because I don't want to give her any more ammunition to nag with. So what if my room is messy? I like it that way! At least I don't mess up the rest of the house like she thinks apparently thinks I do.   And that little punk ass son of a biscuit-eater, my brother. He I dislike the second most! He is so damn self-centered, wouldn't give a rat's ass to save his Mom some work.   And me! Who am I to rant and rave about the stupid things of my family?! I'm just as much the dumbass! Perhaps I should listen more, or clean more, or something. But I don't. I'm just as lazy as my brother which adds hypocrite to the list of things I hate about myself.   *heavy panting* that felt good.

      I will never be a teacher. In some dastardly move by Todd Conrad, I was placed as leader of the class for the last 5 minutes or so. It was a disaster, a cruel lesson to all the ego-pumped bravado-loaded arses like me. No one learned. No one cared, except me. Unhappy times.  NOTICE: PORTIONS OF THIS JOURNAL INSERT HAVE BEEN CENSORED FROM THE DEFENSE OF THE INNOCENT. PLEASE PARDON ANY DISTURBANCE. ATTEMPTS TO DECODE THIS MESSAGE WILL RESULT IN EXTREME VIOLENCE.  I...I have...been asked out on a date. I was taken off the street while doing my route to %#!#$'s house. Her friends asked me if I would ask her out. I was deeply confused. These things don't happen to Dan. I'm normally considered the scary antisocialite, commonly found nibbling on some inhuman morsel and hissing when exposed to natural light. Not exactly loverboy material. But they said #$!@# thought I was kind and a good guy. I told them I don't see %!#$# in school often, so they actually brought her out to talk to me! She seemed as surprised and embarrassed at my visit as I was. We agreed on the weekend and possibly going to Fazoli's for a date, but no time was set. In hindsight, this weekend may be a bad idea. I'm going to the Alma Youth Mix that weekend and will be away for the majority of the weekend. I have to discuss this more with #&*@#. I've been walking in a daze ever since. Wow...God hath a sense of humor. I never saw this coming.

      I saw the movie Hidalgo yesterday. I went in there expecting a mindless action movie filled with one-liners and a decent actor, Viggo Mortenson, one of the select handful of actors/actresses I can remember (LOTR hath me). I got this and a little more. If purely by luck and randomosity, they struck a point of importance in my life. This happened in the scene were the wife of some rich Major or such invited Viggo into her house. She obviously had Viggo's pride on her mind more than the horse race. Just when it was about to get hot and heavy, Viggo says, "Good night, Milady" and walks off. The point is reached by the fact that she is refered to as "the Christian lady" throughout the movie. Is that what Christianity is about? Be all "holier-than-thou" until you get out into the desert with a stud and no one is watching, like your husband? Extrapolate this. Do Christians in general only act nice and godly when other humans are around? Obviously not all of us. Some of us have reached that connection with God where we act in secret just as we act in public. I haven't and, thus, am flawed, a disgrace to God and the Church (with capital letters, signifing the holy collective of true Christians). My actions are often skewed without some noisy observer keeping me accountable. I still have much to learn. As I said, a point of importance.

      I collected payment for my route today, and gained a little insight along with the money. Mr. Close told me, "Never get old." He is a feeble man, forgetting small things like names and wallets, and his wife is extremely sick and in a hospital. I agree with this man. I truly fear few things in life and old age is one of them. I hate the idea of living in an assisted living place more than much else. Death I can stand. When I die, I become greater than I was before, robed in radiant white and ageless. But old age is worse, old age is inability and dependence on other humans. I pity people who live their lives in some foolish hope of immortality, that if they keep going just a little further some miraculous scientific cure for infirmity be made and all will be well. That said, I will live my life to its end, even old age and death. I believe I am nothing but a tool of the Most High, and I will work for him until my ticket is punched. I will live my life without fear of death and do whatever I feel led to do. Perhaps God will bless me with a death at the top of my existence, but if He doesn't, I will continue all the same. Old age does have some blessings: knowledge, a warming aura of nonviolence (no one expects the old Grandma be packing heat), and amnesia towards the unimportant things in life (like names).

      Went to "Beethoven and Blue Jeans", an orcestral event. Well worth my dollar, and a relaxing escape from my everyday droll.  Same Sex Marriages. These words strike disgust in some, hope in others, and others just start loading their automatics. This tangled web is a great problem in my phiosophical life. I so dearly want to agree with those who support "love and free will" mongst the same-sexers, yet still hold to the biblical truth so prevelant among the heterosexual clan.   Let's begin at the beginning. Homosexual sex is wrong. We can get that from a couple verses in the Bible but let's focus on Romans 1:18-32 since its New Testament (so as to escape the Old Testament "burn the defilers" rhetoric), applies to both men and women, and seems quite straightforward to me. In effect, God gives the evil peeps of our world over to their sexual impurities, and they "commit indecent acts with other men". I hate this verse. It is the anathema of all the never-hurt-a-fly God and anti-brimestone speaks I've heard. But it is there, glaring at me, dispelling doubt even when it was a beautiful cloak to protect me from the world's eye. Homosexuality seems to be a trap, a snare the wicked fall into. But more so. God seems to be laying the trap! The saving grace is God only acts this out after they replace God with a lie, Creator for the created. They don't walk into a hidden snare, but walk off the lighted, guide-railed highway into the dark and forbidden.  The system is down. All that is good and wholesome is being lost to replacements, and sickening ones at that. Standard marriages lost to same sex ones, unmarried sex replacing good old married sex. Some would say it is a sign of the times. I like the path I have. Why leave it for something less?

      Didn't bother with a coat today on the paperroute. This is just the right temperature for me, the "chubby-white-boy-ideal-temp." I'm in the zone.   I think its time I explain a little about the way my mind works. Most things that affect me I regard with passive agknowledgement. Basically, I admit that you are there and leave it at that. No matter what you do, I simply agknowledge you did it and go on, quietly forgiving and forgetting.   Example:   I need to get from point A to point B: http://photos.bravenet.com/892/191/471/16699E1DA1.png  But there is a problem, an obstacle standing in my way. For our purposes let's call this problem "unruly mob of freekin' freshmen" or UMoFF: http://photos.bravenet.com/892/191/471/4CE5EF875B.png   Now the standard junior would give an UMoFF the "evil superior being glare" they've been developing throughout their sophomore year. Or perhaps this junior would break out his gas-powered weed wacker and just mow them down. I accomplish my objective simply by knowing the UMoFF is there and where it is not there. Maybe there are holes in the UMoFF and I shall walk through the storm without hitting the droplets. Mayhaps I shall find a point C to walk to and around the UMoFF. Confrontation is unnecessary. Through this philosophy I escape many situations that would only result in anger on both sides. I follow the way of Sun Tzu and win the war without fighting a battle. But don't get me wrong; I'm not a pure nonconfrontationalist. I will confront the problem for 2 reasons: betterment of others and betterment of self. If there are other people behind me also trying to get to point B, I will politely (or not politely) request the UMoFF to move. If I believe confrontation will test my mettle and turn me into a better man (debating, playing the devil's advocate to learn more, etc.) I will do so within a heart beat.   Now assume my plan has failed and I found myself in a negative position. The UMoFF was displeased and I have reached my goal but in a flawed means. Will I be angry or agitated? No! I have believed that your reaction to any situation is a choice. I will be sad, because I have partly failed my duty, but I will also be happy because I have tried not to fail.  If I were to only live this way, I would have a deadly gray and boring life. Nothing would miff me, but nothing will bring me enjoyment. I have decided that throughout it all (it being life), I will look at all the things within it and be glad. How many blind people are in this world that cannot see the good and the bad? The simple fact that I can see is a gift. I enjoy small things: the neon green of a Jesus Freak T-shirt or an aphid, the muddy dark green of my car, the motley of pink, white, and red of my skin. And that is only sight. That is the key.

      "I'm finding myself at a loss for words, but the funny thing is its okay." What are words? They are a doubled edged sword. They cut men down, films to shreds, countries to piles of ash. They are a carpenter's spade. They gather, inspire, teach, and empower. To me words mean little if anything. I am a social inept and can't use words, the social equivalent of a man beating in a railroad spike with a rubber chicken. I should use less words. Words was off me like water on a duck's back. Because of Debate and other social activities, my tongue has been loosened and I beat a little harder. The words stick to me a little more. I don't like that.  I've seen the Passion of the Christ today. No words. "It was as it was."- Pope (attributed and denied).

      Have you ever had amoment in your life, when there is absolutely no doubt in God? When it all seems so obvious that some great being is leading you along his path? I am currently in one of these moments. Because I had to drink some Mountain Dew for a Psychology project, I'm staying up later than usual. I decided to look on the internet for information about one of my college interests, Calvin. The path God led me on was winding. I went to Calvin, then to their Third World Development section, then to Google to search for more info on the unreached Christians of our world. There I found a link to a group I've been led to before: World Evangeliztion Crusade (WEC). I thought, "What the hey. I'll go there again. Maybe I'll email them for info." Finally, I came to the great site I believe God wanted me to see: http://www.joshuaproject.net/index.php. I am almost crying. God has found some great way of showing me places, peoples to find and minister to. Life is good. God is good. Now I shall read some of the site.

       The Fast Food Nation  is beginning to make me feel uncomfortable with my Republican homies. I whiff of Democratic prejudice from this book, and have that feeling that he's not telling the full story, but overall it is an informative read. I've always feared my cafeteria's hamburgers (bone pieces should not be your primary source of calcium) over McDonald's and now I have logic to back my intuition. The book has been beating down on the horrors of insanitary actions as well. These fall on deafened ears. I readily think to myself that the meat I've been eating for nigh 17 years has yet to kill me. It is too tasty to stop now.  Well, back to my recent displeasures of the Republican party. Apparently, they've been taking a lot of campain contributions (read: bribes) for the meatpacking industry. Their antiunion tactics and complete hatred of all federal regulation make me feel more and more Democratic. I feel so...unclean. Tell you what: I'll agree with my Democratic other-siders that we should regulate the heck out of big business if they agree we should do next to nothing with small business. Mkay? But economic reasons aside, I'm still a fervent Republican for moral reasoning. I get that warm fuzzy feeling when Bushie walks onto the stage that I really don't get with Dean or many other Dems. Abortion, homosexual marriages, drug control, and states' rights are too strong in my heart for me to consider moving to the Dark Side.

      *looks down* That was not a good day. Luckily, things have taken an upswing. I very briefly spoke with my girlfriend, only long enough to agree that we should eat at House of Chan's sometime tomorrow. Let's hope things get worked out.  But I'm getting ahead of myself. I spoke to her after the Debate meeting today. We talked about Debate, the hardships and glees inherent within. I saw a bunch of newbies there, and that made me happy. Dynasties are being formed as well as new sproutlings. I had to give a minispeech, but that went bad. I mumbled and hum-drummed my way through it then ran to my seat. I still don't have this public speaking thing down pack yet. After the novices left, the returners congregated and we spoke of camp, possible cases, and the Research-a-thon.  As I read my Bible (far more sporadically then I have a right to, I'll admit), I come across a verse in Psalms that says one should "not put any vile thing" before one's eyes. Now, I'm religously curious. While I am secure in my Christianity (as well as my masculinity), I find the urge to study other faiths quite tempting. I believe what I believe to be true, but I still want to know what others believe, why they believe, if there is any truth in their beliefs, etc. It is important to me, but I wonder if this verse is set to hinder me. Would the Koran be a "vile thing"? Has this verse been overided by the fact that we are now an evanglizing sect, and must know the others' views if only to convert them to ours? My, that sounds arrogant. But is it not true? I think society is too freekin' PC these days, that no belief is truly held, just lightly grasped. I promise you I'm not that type of Christian.

      Fuking fuck fuck, damn it! The quality of my life has just dropped multiple levels, deep into suckiness. Why do I bother? Honestly, every damn time I try to interact with people it just ends up shoved up my ass. *heavy breathing* OK, I'm better now. A little explanation, but not enough to embarass anyone but me. I've hurt my girlfriend (dare I call her that?) emotionally. I asked if she could pay for her prom ticket. I was worried something like this would happen. I discussed it with my family and my parents agreed it was logical to ask her to chip in since the tickets cost $32. Look, I have some money and make some more on my paperroute. I even admit I've saved up quite a decent nestegg in my bank account. But, damn it, that money is for college! I'm trying to enforce some fiscal discipline, and I get screwed. No blame is to be placed on my girlfriend. This is one of those unspoken laws of courtship stupid people like me must learn through trial and error. I guess this is just one of those damn learning experiences, you know, like when you cut off your fingers.  Went to the Job "fair-thing" today. Mandatory, much like other useless dribble in my school life. To be completely honest, I did enjoy it a bit. It got me out of school, let me see a couple colleges I didn't notice, and eat free food. The actual job part was pointless. I know what I want to do with my life (missionary work) and no pansy-assed fair will turn me from that, thank you very much...Makes me wonder just how Christian I've been throughout this post. *sigh* Life sucks now, but I'll get over it.

      Returned from a 30-minute "just-5-minutes" discussion with the illustrious Mr. Green. It's okay though, I quite like the conversations I have with that man. They always leave me happy and free of worry, even if I probably should be worrying. Our discussion was about Debate (capitalization is key here, people.) He thankfully gave me some good news about debate camp funding. Apparently, some wonderful ex-MS Debater is willing to help fund our measly Debate team. He wishes to focus on helping novices advance, but there is still hope for an old Varsity 'Bater such as I. We spoke of the Research-a-thon and the Debate Garage Sale, both wonderful plans to raise our much needed cash. He says that, at a bare minimum, he thinks there will be $400 dollars available for me from school, the Green family, and other sources under his persuasion and control. We shall see if that figure stays so beautifully high, but it's worth hoping for. As only makes sense, I will not be the only Debater off to the great fountains of knowledge we call Debate Camps. The other returning 'Baters are all possibly going as well. Let's see if I can remember who's coming back...Molly, Navi, Poonam, Kelly, Andrew, Emily...that's all I can think of for now.  The discussion turned to a certain debate meeting upcoming. Mr. Green has asked me to give a wittle speech about the pros/cons of debate life in general to the general debaters-to-be. We whinnow the wheat from the chaff. Following this analogy, I must provide a strong enough wind to blow away those who would hate Debate, while keeping it pleasurable enough to maintain those who would enjoy it. Following this, I shall speak of the pros of debate camp to the returners. I truly do hope at least some of them consider camp. It truly opened my eyes to the possibilities of debate and so much theory...so much.  Following  this , I spoke to him about an idea for a case I gleaned from a movie my family rented:  Beyond Borders . The plan is to provide US backing of some form to the UN High Commisioner of Refugees. This has some crazy good harm and a gleaming pile of possible Advantages. It may be worth looking into.  Following   this  , Mr. Green voiced his wish that I would become a Debate assistant while I'm in college. He spoke of the wonders of Calvin, as it is close to Muskegon, and could make this dream a reality. ARGGHHF! Calvin is looking more and more worth joining every day!

      H.P. Lovecraft intrigues me. First of all, he's dead. I didn't know that until I read the Introduction. It seems he lived at the turn of the 20th century. I find him both similar and dissimilar from myself. He is...was a weird man, had a quasi-introverted social life, and read a lot. So far similar. Our differences exist in religion or as his case, the lack thereof. He was a mechanical materialist which is just about as far from Christianity as you can get. He disbelieved in anything spiritual or supernatural...at all. This is especially timely since the other book I'm reading, Miracles by C.S. Lewis, tells quite a different tale. I find Lewis a tad more persuasive, but I am quite biased. Today I will not explain my reasons for spirituality. Maybe next time, when they are challenged by a greater, less dead opponent.

      A very productive day. First, I wake up an hour early to do my route so as to serve at my church's Pancake Breakfast. How it worked out I don't know, because I had to rush to Forest Park Methodist halfway through to get to the Icthus Concert meeting. I know it is two weeks away, but I'm still pumped! Icthus! Icthus! Icthus! Woo! After THAT, I took it easy and went shopping for random camping/Icthus stuff with me mum (a bit of the British that isn't in me). We ended up buying plenty of gear including a backpacker tent, a floor mat for my sleeping bag, a decent waterbottle, some of those cool orange slices that are really huge sugar-coated jelly beans! SUGAR!!!  At the Icthus meeting, I was asked which band is my favorite. That is quite difficult for me as I listen to a wide range of Christian rock from lighter tones like Stephen Curtis Chapman all the way up to angst music such as P.O.D and like certain songs from each band equally. It all depends on which I feel like at the time. I like death-rattling headsmacking rhythms today, but may enjoy that soothing hippy love later. I ended up saying Kutlass, because it's near the middle of the rock spectrum (though some would say otherwise) and my interests hit it often as I move up and down the scale.

      Why is it that when I am silent, people assume I am sad? Can't a human being exist in a meditative quiet without the terror of being alone? I'm living proof it is so. I love not speaking, I'm quite good at it. Oh people-who-read-my-blog, don't guess that I'm sad. If I think you should know I'm unhappy, you'll get the memo.   A trip to Barnes and Noble again. I got the next book in the Discworld series, Pyramids (already proving itself as golden as its predecessors) and an abnormal addition to my collection: The Annotated Works of H.P. Lovecraft. For those that do not know, H.P. is perhaps the greatest horror novelist that ever oozed from the primordial. I've heard reference to his works in several computer games I notice as well as some movies (Hellboy). Famous authors such as Anne Rice and Stephen King were inspired by him. This is abnormal because I don't normally read horror. Sci-fi, fantasy, and religion tend to be my taste. But if I feel like branching out, Lovecraft seems to be at the top of the horror hill.  Randomness tastes good, even when surrounded by more standard randomosity. I was involved in a "drive-by" of a more comedic sort. People that were there will understand.

      I ODed on the Matrix last night. We bought Matrix: Revolutions and watched all three Matrices in a mind-melting continuance. There isn't anything else quite like watching Neo discuss causality at 3:00 in the morning. It's kind of like a nerd nirvana. I didn't go to my Grandma's as planned, because we stayed up waaaaaaay too late last night.

      Hello again, sweet blog of mine. We have not seen each other in quite some time. You see, it is Spring Break and normality has died. My plans for regular blogging as well as bev mod are equally buried. Much has happened and I'm far too lazy to tell it all, but some must be told.   Firstly, I most definitely am going to the Icthus Concert! YES! I have found and hooked up with Lake Harbor United Methodist Church's youth group to travel screaming down deep into the bowels (figuratively) of Kentucky for what could easily be the greatest musical experience of my petty existence. It will cost $100 straight, but that's OK as it involves renting vans, gas, and maybe food. My mom and I will split the costs 50/50 even though I will be the only one in my family going. There was only one seat left!  Nextly, I went to hang with Emily and her friends tonight. Stop thinking that! Right now! Stop it! Ok, anyways, it was a great insight into the workings of the female world. I've seen both sides of the contiuum now: Insanity and semi-depressed artisticness. Much sugar was consumed; many questions from my many Books of Questions were asked and laughed at. It was good.  I am reading "The Problem of Pain" by C.S. Lewis. It is an easier read then when I tried 7-8 years ago, but now it is a hard read because I understand what he says. The doctrine that hits hardest, which though I've always believed but have never really inacted, is the belief of complete self-surrender to God. I banged around in my head in slavering hatred of this doctrine. I love the thought of controlly myself and my surrounding but it cannot be if God exists and Christianity is true. I've seen, heard, and thought too many things to even try to rid myself of Christianity. It will stay there until eternity, and I mus submit to this cruel yet obvious fact. To act only for God...to speak only in honor of him...to live only for his Glory...it all sounds so...well...painful. Is there no room in the inn for my little gaming life? What about secular music or comedic books or anything else that does not directly honor God? Must they all die? I fear I do not know. This requires more thought...

      My, it feels good to be free...freer. More free than I was before Spring Break! I have only partial plans for this week, and none of them are impressive. I plan to go shopping, mostly behind windows, perhaps attempt some behavior modification (more on that later), and go hiking. I recently got some lovable hiking boots and am itching to test them out.   Yes, bev mod. I learned of this in Psychology class (where else?). It basically entails giving yourself rewards and punishments for your actions. Example: If I do my homework for 30 minutes every day, I can buy a book at the end of the month. I figure it's worth a try; I have no self-discipline and anything that could either fix or bypass that is welcome indeed.

      Yesterday was a great time. Literary Review Club, baby! About a dozen people from diverse walks of life, coming together to discuss a piece of...you guessed it, literature! Good discussion which quickly turned to vegitarianism. A couple turned out to be vegitarians, some turned into vegitarians. I always knew Mr. Green was a veggie, but it surprised me to find a good percentage of our club to be as well. Veganism and vegitarianism is okay with me. I fully realize you people have reasons for such insanity, much like I have reasons for mine. But I'm currently an unconverable carnivore. I love burger, steak, poultry, and many other delicacies of the meaty variety. I've been brought up by a farmer's daughter and another farmer's son. My Tunta (aunt) Yupka gave us a big slab of meat from her dairy farm a while ago and my siblings and I giggled with glee. I don't fear meat's health risks much like I don't fear saliva, dirt, or expiration dates. I've decided that if I fear these things, I must fear all high sources of germs, and live a bubbled-enclosed existance. I can't do that. Besides, it is fun to watch people squirm as I digest the baser things of life. The only reason I would turn veggie would be for the price. I hear that veggitarian lifestyles are, in fact, cheaper than omnivorous ones. That deeply touches my inner Dutchman. Perhaps one day I will test this theory.  More recent news, I decided to re-read some of my Terry Pratchett books  Discworld  . IMO, these books are perhaps the funniest books on my shelves, equaled only by Douglas Adams with his  Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy . I'm a newly made fan of British satire as of last summer, and love it in book and movie form (Oh sweet sweet Monty Python and your Holy Grail!). If your interest is piqued, consider buying  The Color of Magic  by TP. I know it sounds a little gay, but it's worth every penny.

      Finished my political service hours. I waved and threw candy for Jerry VanWorkeam. Jerry's our local state senator, too low in the political heiarchy to be corrupted, bless him. I love the candy parades on Memorial Day. I know Memorial Day is to honor our veterans and soldiers, but since I was a child, all that mattered was the candy tossed from on high, like manna falling from the heavens. Now I am the tosser and I enjoy it immensely. The cry of joy, the mad rush to the fallen manna, the silent and sneaky toss to the child who was not fast enough to grab the candy. It's beautiful in its own way.

      Books are insane, eh? There is a book called Sabrael...480ish pages...I read it in one day. There is the Brothers Karamazov...420ish pages...I'm still fighting to get halfway through it. Sabrael was a welcome break from the slow and deep-plotted BK. It was a Dungeons&Dragons style fantasy about necromancers and the adventures thereof. A pleasant quickie.  I learn more of a possible new head pastor today. After our latest contestant chickened out, I feel a tad cynical, but will welcome him all the same. A thing I wish and hope for is a pastor with the youth in mind. This man worked several youth event up in Canada. Yes, he is unequivocally Canadian in nature and nationality. Why not? My dear sweet Grandma was an illegal Canadian immigrant. I've always believed that Michigan is really just a Canadian colony disguised as a United States...State. When the next Canada-States War occurs, I'd like to see which side we chose.  Speaking of comings, there recently was a going that occurred. Our youth pastor of 4 years, Jeremy Borger, decided to resign and move on to newer somethings. So many leaders are leaving in my life: Mr. Trujilo, Pastor Jeremy, Pastor Jeff. I seem to repel superiors, like some antistatist reverse magnet. We shall miss you, Sir Jeremy *salutes*

      The Debate Garage Sale went well. I did not stay for the complete time, returning home around 2ish, but while I was there, there was fun. We talked and sold and ate and played silly mind games.   I fear I may be getting prideful over The Brothers. I take it many places to read, but do I only bring it there to receive the praise of men? Do I only do it to make people think I am intelligent or wise or somesuch? Upon self-searching, I find this false. I am still too great a loner and a fool to do such a stunt for popular gain.  Have you ever read the Book of Jeremiah in the Old Testament? If any of you believe God has your best material interests in mind, read this book. In it, God sends plague, famine, Babylonians, and other great deathmakers of the ancient world on to his chosen people. God is not opposed to corpereal punishment. His actions were to set his people back on the right track. Or were they? Perhaps also, they were punishment, brought down to humble and repay the Israelites for their wandering ways. Either way, I find in this book proof that you cannot be a hedonist and a Christian. Pleasure is unquestionably not the final goal of God. Truth? Salvation? Self-surrenderence, perchance? Whatever is the finish line to cross, it is not material pleasure.

      Helped out at the Debate Garage Sale setup today. As with all things that require mental effort, I resorted to standing around with a dumb expression, waiting kindly to be told what to do. I was told and I did. The world turned and all were pleased.  BSed my way through another essay today, this time critiquing an article on hunting.  No. Just no. Well, my friend and I made a rambuntious attempt to liven up the task, adding recently invented words, repeating title and phrases, and generally breaking the laws of writing and logic with a meat tenderizer.   Well, AP English is a no go. Would you believe the scheduling process started in March? MARCH! How am I supposed to even know what freekin' AP English  is , seconds before I run off to Spring Break? Anyways, as luck (or God, in my ways) would have it, the scheduling system must have changed. A English class turned over into the 1st semester, easing my time table woes. Now all I have to do is get the new Spanish teacher to let me independent study 5th hour. Allow me to rephrase, all I have to do is get the currently middle school Spanish teacher to let me torture her by requiring her to add me to an already brimming class and almost double her teaching needs on the first year of her high school career. Ain't I a prince? *sigh* But what else? What else can I do without destroying my schedule?

      Continue to read the Brothers Karamazov. It is a deathly slow read but the plot is too good to lay down. I just hope I can continue reading it after June 1 (the return date) because it shan't be finished by this time.  Another delightful trip to Mr. Givinetti. I really ought to write down all the stories of this man's life. They are so numerous and witty and insightful, but, alas, I am lazy, slothful even. Perhaps another day.

      Mental Note: Emily's Birthday- February 2              Andrew Asdell's Birthday- May 19              Gyghllyan's Birthday- May 20  Went to Commencement today. Don't know why. I barely know any Seniors (why do I capitalize "Senior"?). They gave their speeches. They got their diplomas. People in the crowd went wild with glee and occasional ditsy-ness.   One of the few virtues I hold in high regard and even consider myself to have is empathy. I felt nervous with the Seniors. They go on to the future, a world beyond what I am at now. I envy them. This world is boring and pointless now. I hope that will change during the summer...

      Hunting...I had to write a 1/2 page journal on hunting. Why? Beat's me. My views on hunting...yeah, let's do it. I like meat and I like shooting things. Hunting would be an utopic action for me if I could aim worth a rat's reproductive organ. I just hate sports hunting. You shoot something...then you don't eat it...WTF!?! You loser! That's like bulldozing an orphanage because you enjoy seeing things being destroyed.  Went to Barnes and Noble on a date. I just realized, B&N has been getting a lot of mention in these posts...meh. I think it went well, except I went to the bathroom twice because of the frappe. I showed her my favorite book areas and she showed me hers. She likes nonfiction and I like science fiction. Wow, we're going to kill each other or something. Nah, I enjoy a good nonfiction every once in a while. Heck, I have a whole series of nonfiction called "Dear Diary" in which olden people have written their thoughts which made it through the ages into this quaint little diary of now. I got over that after I realized how gay it is to read 15th century women's diaries. All good literature dies when you realize it makes you look like a homosexual.

      Ahh...sweet insanity. You know, there are two places I willingly submit to the mob mentality: at church and at music events. I feel that uncontrolable urge to jump, sing, dance even (if you can call what I do dancing). Good music can do that to me and that's what happened last night: good music.  Rock The Coast ! I really liked AudioA's performance, no matter what they say. I just wish I could have stayed longer. I left early with my family to beat the rush. I missed the Cow Bell *sigh*.   Saw Shrek 2 today. I want to hang our critic for the Chronicle. That bloody cynic, that disgraceful insult to unbiased workmanship! It was funny as can be and moreso. It's been a while since I've watched a comedy. This was one worth watching.  I love it when people mistake me for a Senior. It gives me a sense of superiority, that in some way, I appear older and more developed. Like a fine wine or piece of cheese. At least three people has asked me why I was still here, now that the Seniors have long gone. It feels good.

      The week was biiiiiiiiizzy (busy for the phonetically challenged). Tests and exams and projects all over. But it's almost done. We're almost free!  There is little that make me, the stoic emotionless rock that I am, giggle and laugh for joy these days. A good book can do it though. Here's the story: I've found this treasure trove of awesome old skool classics from all the greats. Aquinas, Aristotle, Dostoevsky, they're all here. I think they're called Great Books of the Western World or somesuch. Well, my friend recently told me that The Brothers Karamozov is a masterpiece and what do you know, but there it is. Right in Mona Freekin' Shores! But when I tried to take it out, it can up as a reference book and couldn't be taken out. I was downtrodden and complained to friends (really? friends?). But I tried it again, this time with a real librarian instead of a library assistant, and it worked! Yea verily, I shall bitch no more and even sing! I shall sing a song of joy to the Grand Librarian, and the God who used her to lead me to great literature. I'll be spending most of my senior year with one of these before my nose.  Doing a mock trial in AP Govt. We prepared quite well, figured out what the witnesses shall say and such. I think we'll win and Mike Mean shall be fried crispy. I choked up once, though. The witness said a wrong something, even something that contradicted her own evidence sheet. But I worry not, for we can prove what she was to say otherways.

      A quick blogging before bed. Well, the AP Tests are done and I'm still breathing. The AP Govt test was easy enough, but the AP Chemistry test was not. I feel empathy to Egyptian mummies who had a spoon shoved up their noses and swirled around until the brains become mush. That's the AP Chem test. End of the Year Projects are appearing. And damn it, but I need to do them well to hold to my grades. *Sigh* I almost envy the nonchalant grader. Then I remember I'll be getting merit scholarships and I just do the damn work.

      Is reality real? I think so. I firmly believer there to be an absolute truth, some overarching reality true to us all. From my simple and small list of experiences, I've found the world view supported by Christianity to be closest to "truth". Not only from parental inheritance, but personal revelation and study have shown this to be quit true. You see, that's the rub. I may believe in an absolute truth, but I cannot claim to  know  this truth. I can only promise the claim of a scientist: that this is as real as you can expect or, in all honesty, claim. Still, that's a good start and there is plenty of time to fill in gaps. Why do I believe in such an absolute truth? Because if it does not exist, then nothing can truthfully exist. No morals or logic will remain except the arbitrary choices of us madmen. There can be no better or worse because all are neutral and unequivical. The search for truth becomes a dog chase, not only after an unreachable mechanical rabbit, but a rabbit that isn't even there. I'd do a "better" job of finding truth by writing down beliefs and randomly pulling them out of a hat. No, this is not for me. My bones and intuition tell me there is sometime more beautiful, more purposeful "out there". That is why I do not enjoy groin dancing, why I read my Bible everyday, and placidly walk through life. I'm looking, searching, and occasionally finding. That is the de-rub.

      Danced for the first time in my life yesterday. The closest thing I've ever gotten to this was moshing at Unity Festival '03, but that's another story. The experience is truly new to me. In my distance past, I remember someone talking about how people sleep with each other not only for the sex, but also for the closeness and intimacy of being near another human being. Then I scoffed at the idea, thinking it was just an excuse for lust, but I think I've tasted a bit of that intimacy during our slow dances. It is worth repeating.  I feel sorry for the people who wrote in  The Matrix and Philosophy . If only they waited until the end of the trilogy, they would have a greater understanding of the whole Matrix-universe as well as more quotes to base their argumentation on. Even so, this book rocks. I'm learning many new philosophic words and theories. Some like mine; some not.   Fast dancing intrigued me. It is purely hedonistic (like that?  The Matrix and Philosophy  taught me). There is no reason to do it except for the sexual pleasure inherent within. Of course, I sound like some eccentric old goat, complaining about the fashions and materialism of today's youth. But objectively, I see no reason to rub one's buttocks against another's groin except for sexual purposes. But maybe that's just me.

      Are we strange because we are naturally strange or because the social network we live in causes us to be strange? I think it is a little of both. Natural geeks are drawn to "geek groups" which rub off on them, making them more geeky. It's cyclic. Geek clubs are the whetting stone we sharpen our geekiness into a razor, so as to better stab the heart of normality. I found it funny when a self-proclaimed "band geek" said that a nonband geek placed in a group of band geeks would be very confused and frightened. This phenomena is not limited to band. Throw some "normy" into a bunch of Debater geeks and he'll be mentally pummelled. Heideggerian kritik discussion alone would push that poor sap over the edge. In fact, I think all geek clubs would have that effect on a normy, similar to the effect on a geek thrown into a football lockeroom. We're mutually destructive, like matter and anti-matter.  I am officially a member of NHS now. Strange, no cultic rights, no blood-drawn pentagrams. Actually, I think the choir was a little gutsy in their choice of a Christian song for the induction. Honorable, but gutsy. Being in the National  Honors  Society brings up questions of humility. I'm thinking about running for an office, but so many others are running, it may be best to simply be a self-volunteered guide on the sidelines.

      Books and more books! I have so many books! There are brown bags filled with literature lying at the end of my bed and in my closet. Books are piled against my bookcase which is crammed in all ways immaginable. I dream of a new room, redone with a massive bookcase covering one wall. It would hold all of my books and be the pride and beauty of the whole room. I could invite people into my room and say, "Oh, yes. And this is were I keep some of my books." Of course, for this dream to be realized, I would have to clean my room, an act akin to an archeological dig, remove some unneeded furniture, and move everything else. But maybe one day, this dream will come true.  National Honors Society has welcomed me with open arms. I'm in and the final induction will occur tomorrow. I can only dream of the mysterious cult practices of such a society. Will there be drinking of goats' blood? Perhaps nudist dancing 'round the old pentagram?  Heck, we may even upgrade to a hexagram. I plan to work for a offical position in NHS. Maybe treasurer or vice-prez. I don't want president, because that involved too much power and leadership for my tastes. That is the one "pillar" of NHS I truly lack: leadership. I tend to neither follow nor lead, but simply go as I please until I find a better tug. Example given: I sit alone in meetings. I feel I can be an embarrassment to my friends, especailly around their other friends, so I sit alone and in the peaceful knowledge that I harm no one. Unless someone calls me over. That's key. If I'm called, I am relieved of the duty of nonaction and free to act in the proper fashion.

      I have a problem with authority. The government frightens me because it can corrupt me, my faith, and my lifestyle. I loathe governmental action because it is  always  ripe with bureaucratic illogic and overcost. Normally, nothing would exemplify that kind of law better than my school's law about no eating in the classrooms. There is scientific studies that prove well fed people learn better. On a more selfish note, eating in classes allows me to sell chocolate for my summer mission trip to Mexico. But this certain law is a paradox. If I break it, it negatively reflects on the teacher, which can only be bad for him. Those that know me know that I hate insulting or harming people in any way. If my nonaction will assist you better, even if it harms me in the long run, I won't budge. I feel a sense of shame for my actions. They could have harmed my teacher, a great sin in my book (or Book). Yes, even the authorities can cause this old antistatist to cringe in shame.

      The Da Vinci Code is a troubling dip in the other side of the pool. There are some views expressed in it that are ardently anti-Christian (or at least anti-Catholic). The historical arguments that the Fathers burned, tortured, and propagated strike hard. My limited knowledge of church history allow for these stories. But my worries were relieved after a single misstep: he said the Church was trying to cover up the Dead Sea Scrolls. Obviously this book was made before the Scrolls were fully translated as the Scrolls proved that an overwhelming portion of our Old Testament is perfectly aligned with the Scrolls. This fault brings into question his other light-hearted jabs which I will only fear after some unbiased study into church history on my part.   Another interesting twist is the feminism. Now, to be honest, the feminist movement frightens me. The days will soon be gone when a man can sweep his love off her feet and pile her high with compassion and gifts (monetary if you must). They are a dying breed of romanticism. If we view man and woman equal, no chivalry can't exist as the core of chivalry is the defense of the weak. I love such days. So as to prevent rabid women from lynching me in the street, the feminist movement has many good points. I firmly believe in equal pay for equal results (if you make a pound of X, you get Y dollars and nothing else). I even belief that in most areas of life (spiritual, mental, physical [in some case]) we are equal. The problem being my Bible has some cruelly chauvinist verses that hold me from true feminism. Like puddy in Brown's hands, that is just proof of the Church's persecution of the "sacred feminine". Even so, I feel some truth to them, some logic behind our sexually inclined differences and inequalities. In the end, the feminist issue is a deadlock for me now. I'm standing on the sidelines.  Friends. Female friends are deadly and merciless. They backstab, gossip, and mentally mutilate when you're not looking. Male friends tend to be nice enough to beat your ass to your face. Does that even make sense? Surprisingly, a large majority of my friends are girls. Does this mean I have a sweet spot for mental mutilation? No, I like girls for friends because they provide the discussion I crave. As a man, many of my points of interest are not "manly". I am not interested in cars, sports, military action, or lumberjacks (though one could argue the last one is feminine in nature). I love deep philosophical talks, delving into theology or epistomology or what have you. Women are more willing to talk about these things, in general.

      Lesbian Nuns. Yah...that's a title that'd make a Buddhist jump in fright. Norton Shores library impresses me. Every time I'd go there as a little child, I'd always run to the children's section. Now that I am older and my thoughts turned towards the loftier things of life, I find books like this in my search. I didn't borrow it and won't, but it's fun to know that such a book exists.  Icthus has come and gone and with great pleasure. Seminars, food, fellowship (or the lack), and such music as I love. It saddens me that I'm such a loner, I can't even strike up or follow a conversation with fellow Christians. It's that bad. One must accept his weaknesses and move on, I suppose.  Finished Angels and Demons by Dan Brown. Many interesting interconnections with Miracles by C.S. Lewis. I find his eventual definition of God as "energy" most amusing and out of touch with my views. But otherwise, it's good stuff. I firmly believe that science and religion are not only different sides of a coin, but almost the black and white of a yin-yang. What good is science if you do not believe in the reasoning of man? How can a theist see miracles if there is no normal background to place them against? They need each other.

      Someone ran off with the frisbee yesterday, so no Ultimate.  I've stopped considering what job I  will  have since I decided to be a missionary. But, even still, I enjoy the idea of what occupation I  should  do. I've narrowed them down to these three finalists: librarian, bartender, and missionary. I can't express the euphoria created by when I found book in the Graduate Library. It wasn't like sex (or at least how people describe sex). It was a silent filling of oneself with joy and purpose. I got the same feeling when I looked through my Dad's book:  The Little Black Book of Bartending . While I kindof enjoy cooking, I think the reason I like it is because it's in the mental proximity of mixing drinks. The mear notion of filling glasses with measured or, with experience, umeasured amounts of juices and alcohols...it fills me. Mission work does not do this, at least not yet. It is more of a cerebral pleasure than an emotional one. I like the idea of spreading the Word as it provides me with real purpose. Truly, what grand final purpose is fulfilled by making a damn fine Manhattan, or finding some obsure French version of "Lesbian Nuns: the Sequel"?  The idea of bartending comes up today from my recent chapter of  The Modern Gentleman . Really, this book covers everything: sex to fornicate, drugs to ingest, clothing to wear, literature to read, movies to see, and, of course, drinks to mix. It's inspiring if somewhat unreachable by me. My personality and moral strictures prevent me from performing some..."actions"...mention within.

      Sufficient imbibement of Mountain Dew has quantified in a marked upspike of felicity (I'm high on Mountain Dew,but that's ok).  People are writing on my arms. Well, actually just Emily, and just on one arm. I enjoy how our relationship is turning out. We kid and insult and retort lightly and in jest. Maybe this is why I gave up on my world, my piece and my peace...to join the real world, where Emily is.  Played more Ultimate Frisbee last night. We played on this mini-plateau of grass, really no more than a butte. I stubbed my barefoot on a manhole covering and now I have a bruise that hurts everytime I push it. Mental note:  Wear shoes during Ultimate Frisbee. We played a game of 7-weekers versus MNDI (3-weekers).

      The files...the files...WHY?!? Why do you torture me, O dreadful files of information? Why do you make me sort you and resort you again and again? Do you hate me? are you Allied with Macintosh? Gah. Files of all the cards we cut werre sorted yesterday. Today, we took those and taped them onto paper for easy reading purposes. So much pain...so many files...  On lighter news, I bought a book at Urban Outfitters. Most of their books are...risque to say the least, the unholy bastard-children of postmodernism to say slightly more. But this one was only marginally directed towards sex and drugs. It is called The Modern Gentleman. A good read, if not one I suggest to my mother. It discusses the ways and acts of...well...the modern gentleman. How to host a parry, how to arrive at a party, the correct ways of a good skinny-dipping session (no joke). Those who know me know I am not quick to party or talk (or swim naked for that matter). But there is something in me that enjoys the idea of being a decent conversationalist. A quip, a quote, a quick limerick or crude and unexpected reference, something to add to the knowledge and general frivolity of whatever grouping dared to allow me in from the kind darkness of nonsociety.   We talked about kritiks today. While I'm still of the camp that sayeth kritiks are a little low for a negative to hit, I still like the idea behind them: philosophical foundations of a debate action are flawed. This brings in interesting and insightful thoughts by philosophers that I enjoy and soak in like warm rays of golden shine from our closest star. Not that Michigan ever gets that. Why is it still so cold?

      Just before sleeping last night, I wrote some random letters on my hand to remind me of what to blog today. Let's see...what does "B" mean again?...Ah, yes. I went to a book store called Borders yesterday. I still have loyality ties to Barnes and Noble, but if they're going to build their freekin store  3 miles away, they should expect me to be a little promiscuious in my bookstore selection. Borders is alright. No Starbucks inside, but there are at least two in walking distance, so no prob there. What I like about Borders is its style of bookshelving. On every thinkable wall surface area, there are bookshelves crammed with books! There are shelves standing in the middle, shelves on the walls, shelves connected to the walls...books are everywhere! I still haven't gotten used to the organization of the store (if there is one) but I have found a couple books considerably worth buying.   "U" stands for Ultimate Frisbee. We played deep into the night, and then went and got drinks at Starbucks. I really don't know who won. It reminded me of the games of UF we would play in Eagle Pass, while waiting for the insurance company to send us the right vans. I'm not very athletic and I don't have terribly good accuracy, but I can play and run well enough. I hear we have a fledgling UF club starting in Mona Shores. Oh, happy day indeed! I'll have to hook up with them.  Free morning today. I ran off to First Congregational Church for a little religion. They spoke of friendship, which is ironic (or predestined providence) since I'm thinking of friends. The basic idea of friendship they created was composed of four parts: (1) friends hang out with each  other (2) friends can talk sincerely with each other (3) friends love each other deeply (4) friends are there and willing to respond when you call for them. The first section really limits the number of people I call friends. I hang with no one outside of school and sports...at all. Except for Emily, who I've begun to hang with regularly. Maybe family as well, but they're in a totally different category. (2) is also hard since I feel nervous bringing up any subject of real worth to anyone. (3) and (4) are easy for me. I love and am hard pressed to think of someone I do not love. Even my wee brother, who can thrown some stumbling blocks in the realm of brotherly love, is lovable. For (4), well, I'm always here. Really, I can be contacted and rushed in to most any real situation. Were someone to call me and say, "Dan, I need you in Antartica in three days. I'm faxing you a ticket and providing your clothing.", why, I start walking to the nearest airport. Of course, this is rarely challenged or tested, so who knows how responive I really am.

      Life in the social pond is frightening. Especially if you're not good at it. An example of this fearful thing happened today at lecture. As some may know, I have a sickening and self-mutilating habit of picking at the pimple-scabs on my face. Some people sitting in front of me noticed and started whistpering and giggling. I felt something then. A deep sensation in my stomach, like someone replaced my lower intestinal tract with a bottomless pit of despair and endless black. It wasn't good.   Now, a normal person could care less about this feeling, but for me it is a sign of changes in my life. I've become more social and thus am more affected by society. Honestly, 3 years from now I wouldn't have cared what those people were giggling about. Heck, I probably wouldn't even notice that they existed. I don't like this change. I want to return to my world, my pitiful section of the universe were God and I breathe and think and exist without outside judgement. But I doubt I can anymore; society has spotted me and is hunting me like an eagle hunting a little mouse. My only hope is to return to my sense of uncaring: that their opinion not only means nothing but that they won't even be in my life two weeks from now. *Sigh* If only it were again.

      World Government...should there be one? Well, I've already stated that I'm libertarian, even to the point of nearly being anarchist. World government is the absolute of my hatred and fear in terms of authorities. A grand, overarching creature, and almost certainly based on communist values...I shudder at the thought. I love freedom, even if some choose to use this freedom for evil, so be it. John Calvin frightens me with his views of God's truly omnipotent control over the world, even to the extent of controlling the actions of men and perhaps even the thoughts of men. I wish he would leave some small modicrom of freedom for our pleasure. The slightest bit of free will would be like the fingertip of water on the rich man's tongue (Bible referance. Look it up if you want). But like that rich man, no water seems to be coming. I will read on and hope for some sign of empowerment. That was what pleased me about C.S. Lewis' theology: it gave us freedom, if thoroughly without Biblical backing.  I searched for Name Generators on Google with Emily today. I was looking for the perfect to use as an instant messaging alias. I searched elf names, gangster names, hobbit names, cyborg names...and finally used a name generator called weird name. How appropriate. I shall use a mixture, a cut-and-paste of two names found in this generator. I shall be called: "Drunken Philosopher." And it will be pleasant.  A great shattering of my ways has occurred. Emily and I discussed the friends and relationships we have with people. Admittedly, Emily has the quickness to strike down fiery curses (such as "I don't really like him") on those she knows. I am slow to judge in most cases. People do not anger me easily, probably because I expcect them to be losers and annoyances. Though I am commonly an optimist, with human nature I am pessimistic and "An optimist is often dissappointed, while a pessimist is often pleasantly surprised." The conversation turned to the amount of time one must spend with someone to be considered a friend. I originally thought that I spend no great amount of time with anyone, and thus am no one's friend (many allies, many aquaintances, maybe even distant friends, but no close friends). Emily quickly pointed out that I spend plenty of time with her. I must ponder this. My previous societal engagements have been hit-and-run, "slam,bam, thank you ma'am" in nature. But she is right, I spend an undeniably large amount of time in her presence. And even talk with her there. It is strange to realize I am not the great lone wolf I always considered myself. Hmmm....

      Today's lectures went far better than last time's. They saw the problem, running out of time and rushing through at the end, and overcompensated. We got out 10 minutes early, and you won't hear me complaining.  When I finally break through my incalculable wall of procrastination and actually start working, I'll get to "cutting" cards. Apparently we don't actually cut them until the last couple days. Huh.  I was caught in the act of blogging by Emily yesterday. Yeah, now she and her friends will know my every thought and emotion I enscribe on this electronic tablet. Meh. It's not like I have anything to hide *darts eyes from side to side*.

      Changed my bio. I feel it is better or at least better explains my view of myself. S'good.  This morning's lectures were mediocre. The first attempted a self-humiliation joke that just didn't fly. The second, one of my lab teachers, tried some "interactive study tools" which involved us shouting out that we were not asleep. They both ran out of time and did not finish their whole lecture. This surprises me. Debate basically revolves around the idea of saying all you need in a set period of time. You'd figure they'd be trained for this.  Researching is a boring task indeed. As in all boring tasks, my mind wanders and the Internet has many attractions to engage a wandering mind such as I. But now I feel guilty for not working enough. I wish we'd start researching a kritik. All the evidence is probably in books and philosophical disertation is sweet desert to my soul.  I've received directions to the Starbucks. I'd go now, but I just ate supper. Maybe later tonight. Still don't know if there is a BNN nearby. I hope so.

      More to blog of. I didn't tell you, I found my favorite Bible verse: Romans 7:15 "I do not understand what I do. For what I want to do I do not do, but what I hate I do." This is important. For years, I would wonder at people for loving certain Bible verses. To me then, all verses were equally interesting and teaching. Now I see. This verse is my life. I do (addictions, temptations, fooleries) everything I do not want (God's way). It is also exemplar of me as it is theologically tasty. The idea of sinful nature being imposing itself on one is intriguing.   There are Macs here. I did not realize this before, but I am a hardcore Microsoft addict. Bill Gates is my homie. I look upon these lesser computing devices with disgust. They are cute and cuddly, what with their white cases, easily moving screens, shaded icons, and other burning figures of evility. The accursed apple, partly bitten, reminded me of Snow White's poisonous delight. I hate how they focus on appearance and lessly on functionality, sacrificing user capablity on the plush teddy bear altar of appearance. I admit they crash less (if you can find the freekin button to start the demon-spawned creature), but at least Windows is cruelly straightforward with your crashing. The Blue Screen of Death is quick to arise. With Mac, it just keeps trying, like the little engine that could(n't).  There is a arcade here. The prices were dropped from 50 cents to 25, so I get double the playing. I'm becoming hooked into a game called Metal Slugs 4. It's a beauty from my past, or maybe my distant recollections are of an earlier version. Anyway, this game is sweeeeeeeeeet. I go now to play. See you later I will.

      It has been far too long. I've made an analogy of blogging to the Pensieve of Harry Potter's world. You take a wisp of thought out and feel less clogged. This may require several sessions as I am currently blogging from Angel Hall in the University of Michigan, and I must run off to my next lab in 30 minutes.  Let us begin at the beginning or at the least the beginning of the end of my last post. I went to Mexico. In ways, it was similiar to the last Mexico trip. I failed to develope any meaningful personal relationships, much less start any. I did not work hard enough in the Work Project. Many a time, there was no work to be done, but I was the one not doing it and this grieves me. Perhaps out of some cruel guilt reflex, I read my Bible relgiously (gah) throughout these times of low. Even the Mexicans begin thinking I was some reflective Jesuit priest or somesuch. The arts and crafts ran well enough, but of no credit to my personal workings. But through this great fiasco south of the border, God had something to tell me. At the last meeting, between great bouts of joyful tears and questionable singing, a small message was translated to us. It twas the story of Peter, when he could not catch any fish on the first boat outing but captured many on the second. The difference, I am told, was that Jesus was with him the second time round. I suppose you could consider this my first trip, absent of fish (meaningful goals reached). But in it is a ray of hope: with God, the second journey will be bountiful. Truth be told, I did not pray much, if at all, throughout the trip. I was most certainly not walking with Dios. I can only guess what the second trip shall be, figuratively of course, but I hope for it. I truly have taken into question not only my steadyness of action, but also of feeling. Good God, who was the last person I truly loved? I fight with my mother, I'm distant from the rest of my family (even extended). My beloved "girlfriend" Emily is a wonderful shy young lass, but I have not felt love for so long...I do not know if I have loved her. I have no friends to love. My relation with God is waning. I speak of active love, the only true and worthy kind. I passively love these all, but how false and pitiable is that? We shall see....  Now, I am in U of M for a reason, which may surprise some of my faithful (Dan? Reason? Surely Not!). But alas, I am here for a debate camp. So far so good. My roommate is younger and less experienced than I as well as being the only Louisianan from his school here. His name is Alexander *mumble mumble mumble*. I hooked up with Emily soon after finding my room. I found my room long after arrival. We got to Ann Arbor LONG after starting. I left for Ann Arbor a day after returning from Mexico. (reverse-chronological sentence...fun)

      Off to Mexico. I'd better start packing, but I figure I'd blog first. I think this time will be better than the last. I feel I didn't do enough, didn't serve well enough, didn't say enough last time. In short, I failed as a missionary. I still can't speak or even preach, but at least I can work. We will be building an addition to the church down there, and menial physical work is my forte. Pray for me, friends (if you exist, that is).  I like the cut of Calvin's jib. You hear how he has a low view of human nature, but they forget to mention that he has a proportionally high view of God's gifts to us so that we shine as a reflection of that God. I shall be bringing the first book with me to Mexico as a "light read" hehe.  I'm beginning to tire of all this good literature. By this I mean, Calvin's Institutes and Dosteovsky's Brothers are incredibly good and passionate but also incredibly hard to read. My mind swims in their greatness, unable to comprehend it all. I need some good, low thought science fiction to clean my mind. Maybe some Isaac Asimov or RA Salvatore.

      Off in the distance, a rumbling sounds. The revebration continues and grows in intensity. Whoops and hollers of joy are muffled by distance, but only for a while. Then the wave strikes you, a thousand crazed teenagers like a mob of bipolar disordants collectively hitting mania. Summer is here.  I'm slightly depressed though. I cheated in the Brothers Karamozov. I read up to a point, then read the epilogue. Now I fear that the greatest part happened in that gray, unlearned space between reading endpoint and epilogue. Damn my great culmanation of vices, addictions, and desires which prevented me from a full blown Karamozov binge! Trust me when I say, BK is no action thriller. It goes on a seductively slow and intriguing pace. Still, it is worth reading. Many aspects of the book apply to my life: the spiritual searching of Alyosha, the sensualist needs of Fyodor and Mitya, the confused attempts of reading complex literature by Kolya (this struck me as ironic).  We bought Pitch Black yesterday. For those of you who do not know my family, my father, brother and I are deadly sci-fi fans. I enjoyed Pitch Black and find it suspisious that it came out in the same era as The Matrix. Such a lovely action flick was engulfed in the great mania of tight leather and disposable weaponry that is The Matrix. I find it interesting that both movies have religous overtones similar to my beliefs while still greatly different: Pitch Black being tinged with Islam and The Matrix holding to Gnostic Christianity and Buddhism. Pitch Black has a great deal more swearing in it, as well as a deal more blood (you ever realize that? The Matrix had some heavy battle shots but little gory mangled bodies or great blood splatters common to action/sci-fi/fantasy), but it still has good points on the philosophy of human nature. Men naturally tend to kill to save themselves, but there is the rare self-sacrifice. I believe all truly selfless acts are God-called in some way. Even the greatest atheist can be called to serve God in a selfless act, and thus reflect his greatness in that way. Hmmm...  Bought a CD by Disciple today. Now, it is ironic that I bought it the same day I skimmed a book called Tattoed and Unglued or somesuch. The book decryed the actions and dress of the Underground or Counterculture of today. Mostly I agree. Drugs, swearing, and sketchy theological basing is prevalent underground. But not everywhere. There are Christians who dress and act different than the mainstream. I am becoming one of these, what with my Hot Topic T-shirts and soon to be sexy dreads (my book is in and I shall buy it tomorrow! Huzzah!). Even some of the Christian apparral in Hages' is dark and smacking of Goth undertones. I strongly cry that one should never judge any book by its cover. Goth can be a theologian. But I digress. The CD gave me a minor headache. It is loud, angstful, and filled with guitars, drums, and guttural screams. I love it.  I started The Institutes of Christianity by John Calvin for real this time. I like the way he views his own book. He does not claim to add anything to the Bible, finding it infallible and beautiful. He does not even claim responibility for his doctrinal interpretations, calling upon the Divine for guidance and goodness in his writing. He writes this as a guide to the Bible to help "those who would study the path of salvation". That's me.

      Exams are here! Ready the armaments! I have to say, this is the least stressful of exam weeks in my life. I've already taken 4 exams (Govt, Chem, Psych, and Spanish) before the week even occurred. Math happened today. I felt good on most of it, except for the factoring segment at the end. If anything, that will kill me.  I continue to wait impatiently for a book I ordered. I know, fight that damn American one second patience syndrome, but I really want this book. It's about dreadlocks. Upon deep thought, I probably won't be able to pull off locks. My hair's about as Caucasian and straight and thin as you can expect from the descendent of some wooly iceman. But hey, a man's gotta dream right? My appearance is at 0 on a scale of 0 to any-number-you really-feel-like-at-the-moment. Getting shot in the face would improve my score. Scrapnel scarring is a great way to impress the ladies.

      Hecketicocity! I go to the First Priority "meeting" only to be told (through body language as it were) that the meeting does not exist. So, instead of peaceably going home and gaming, say a little DX2, I run off to  another  meeting for my church. This one was more productive. I learned more about the pastor candidate and all his Canadian goodness.  I re-checked my Brothers Karamazov yesterday. I have until Tuesday to read the rest of this behemoth. A challenge I shall meet with vigor! And speaking of behemoths, I borrowed Calvin's Institutes of Christianity for my aunt. Its in two books and at least 1700 pages in total! A good summer reading I see.

      You know, it took 30 minutes on the lakeshore to do what 2 days out fasting in the wilderness couldn't. But I'm getting ahead of myself.  I had an economic discussion with my mom. My readers must now have a Pavlovian conditioning so when I say I spoke to my mother, they cringe in painful pity. It started like that. I wanted to buy a baked stuffed bean burrito from Taco Bell. $1.79 plus tax, so let's say $2. She says I spend too much. Agreed. I spent approx. $400 this summer and have been working less due to Debate and Mission Trips. But it all has been on legit levels. I buy, tops, 2 Slurpies a week (what, you want to bleed me and sell the plasma for that $1.70?). The big payoff (GPS and backpack) was split with my father and we got a 10% discount. Okay, I confess. I bought a Swiss Army knife out of the blue. I so enjoy the multiplicit sweetness of such a tool; it already has proven itself useful (as an opening device). Can't a boy find happiness in a $40 dollar pointy rock with upgrades (Grog started with a rock and the Swiss perfected his design)? Anyways, I think I will cut back. She was right, even though I can never admit it (this doesn't count. Trust me.)  I think I will tell you about the sunset now. I have been a hypocrite: I decry the faults of society and instill them still. I haven't actively gone out to see a sunset until now. And with damn good reason. Been thinking. I've been trying everything to reach God (the fasting, the mission trips, Sundays torture events) by my own power and capabilities. Calvin has taught me that I can't do this without failing (see below posts for evidentiary facts). So I must start relying on God. I still don't fully understand what this means. But I think that's okay. The point is that I'm starting. For whatever crazy reason, today I've recommitted to God. Okay, this is sad. I've recommitted my pansy ass to this Omniscience Being one too many times. But this time it is for real. I considered making an oath, but I fear breaking it and feeling the vengeance of an angry God. But I feared it before and failed. So I decided it was necessary this time. I oathed myself to God. God save my soul if I forget (at least I hope He will. He's good about that stuff). Pray for my pansy,wanker soul, friends. I need all the prayers I can get.  Almost forgot. God has a...well, twisted...sense of irony when it comes to my CD Changer. Hear me out on this one. Here's the song that started the moment I left the beach:  "Simply"- Pillar  I've made it so hard on myself, turning my back on how You felt   Seeing a lie that led me on, leaving a love that did no wrong   That's what it took for me to say   That You simply love   Despite all the stupid things I've done   It's hard to remember   That You simply love   Even though I know not what I've done   It's hard to remember   That You simply love   I've tried to do all this on my own   Not thinking once of what You've shown    All that I've done has blinded me   To everything that You have for me   I want You to know that I finally see   I don't know why I can't understand   I don't know why I can't comprehend

      I finally got that repulsive left bucktooth replaced with a permanent crown. Well, it's actually temporary until people at a "lab" in Grand Haven can get the shading and leveling right. But still, my appearance is marked improved. I no longer have that slight discoloration in the gumline of that tooth. I've had that since I got it broken in a tragic sledding accident...what, 5 years ago? The gap between my two front teeth has been closed as well. I've had that since I was born. I plan to join the local&nbsp;YMCA as a Youth member and my mother plans to talk to&nbsp;a&nbsp;skin&nbsp;doctor she knows about my acne.&nbsp;I feel like an upgraded Agent, all spiffy and speedy. If only I could hit that Neo guy...  I'm at least 90% completed with my job applications (took me damn long enough, eh?). I found out my supervisor for 3 years was Jim Rhinehart. Huh, who'da known? Well, finish that and the resume and I'm well on my way to leaving my torture game of a job. I was actually told by a passing car-driver to get a real job (a friend in fact). Well, you just can't argue with that kind of coincidence.  I've started performing a ritual called the Wesleyan fast. It involves not eating anything (much like other fasts in the rule book) from morning till 3:00 on Wednesdays and Fridays. Supposed to help with my prayer life, so I can't complain. Wonder if my family will figure it out someday...nah.

      Had a good ole' fashion family reunion on my mother's side. Funny. How can you reunion when you've never unioned? Well, it was a good union. I saw a bunch of people I haven't seen in a while or ever. I saw a relative of mine who is a missionary up in Canada, that I've heard a lot about and never seen. I've seen some cousins that are about my age which I've never seen.&nbsp;A lot of funny Dutch accents flying in the wind and truly awesome&nbsp;Dutch food&nbsp;on the table (I didn't know we had so many kinds of meat). &nbsp;Of course, I didn't talk to them, but baby steps, people; you're talking to a man that has periods of complete&nbsp;nothingness.   My brother got a car on Ebay. What should I be feeling? Envy? Desire? Interest? Nadda. Maybe&nbsp;a little happiness, just in being around such a beautiful work of art (that is what a car is) and maybe a little pleasure divined from my brother's overwhelming&nbsp;happiness. But almost nothing. Cars are important things. I feel great freedom and worry and caution when I consider my own car (sidenote: I got flipped off for the first time. Not that much fun, that motherfokkin aoss [aren't fake swearwords fun?]). But this thing evokes nothing.

      I have a conflict, a complication, a quandary. I've lost the will and ability to express myself. Allow me to explain. There are things that I wish to say: witty retorts, friendly expressions, knowledgeable dicussions. But I can't. The words don't come to my mind. The words that do come&nbsp;don't leave my lips. And&nbsp;it's not only words. My body is a&nbsp;revulting mess,&nbsp;I cannot&nbsp;dance or sing or even look right.&nbsp; I have no skills, I cannot draw or build or work. I don't even have enough willpower to&nbsp;train these skills.&nbsp;My thoughts tend to remain mine and are never shared or expressed. This saddens me. I cannot explain why. I should be uncaring as to whether people know what I feel. I'm a loner, and a male loner at that; remember the rock? But I do care. I want to share, to teach, to learn. But alas. It is not so.

      Well, I'm back. So soon? Yeah, I kinda failed. I planned on 10 days and I couldn't even make two. Maybe it was the constant pain, the heavy weight, or perhaps the rashes that popped up in not so nice places. But it wasn't any of that. It was as appallingly boring as last time. Last Time? Oh, yeah, I tried this before at our property. Failed then too.&nbsp;The reason I&nbsp;put myself through the pain and misery is to grow closer to God, or so I try. Look, it just&nbsp;makes sense to me. I try to fast, I try to pray, but I fail.&nbsp;Or did I? The music sounds sweeter, the food is more delicious. I feel a little more driven. I think I'll start those job applications. I better do it quick; this kind of drive runs out all too soon.

      Anyone who says a geekish&nbsp;outsdoorsman is an oxymoron hasn't used a handheld&nbsp;GPS. My dad and I went shopping for hiking supplies today. GPS and a quality backpacking backpack. The price ended up in the mid-hundreds with me paying half. Understandable.  &nbsp;  Well, the worst is over. We had our big discussion about my hiking/camping experience yesterday. My mom wheedled me into camping for 10 days instead of 14. No big. My dad seemed more supportive of the idea, as he is a heavy outdoorsman himself. It should be fun.  &nbsp;  I may or may not be breaking up with my girlfriend. Who knows? She posted on her blog that she feels I was mean and nonunderstanding. I replied today with an email and shall read the reply after I'm done camping. We'll both have plenty of time to think.

      Turning again to another piece, this one more visual. I watched  Fight Club  last night. Easily, in my top three movie favs (The Matrix and Lord of the Rings [both the first in the trilogies]&nbsp;being the others). I really enjoy fight-the-system mentality. It's one of the reasons I'm becoming a missionary. Marx viewed the religious leaders negatively because they provided nothing to the great economic machine (I think, I've yet to read his Manifesto. I hear it's a good one). The value I provide will have nothing to do with silver or gold, but with heavenly treasures, much like the freedom found in the fight. Still, I disagree with the destruction of other's property, even on principle. If you cannot defeat them with words, you won't beat them with guns.  &nbsp;  I&nbsp;had a talk&nbsp;with my Mom again. As usual, it was like being gored in the man parts. I talk about dreads and you can almost feel the disgust and regret radiating from her. I talked about my camping and she moaned (not aloud but in her stance). She just doesn't understand why I have to stay so long. I do, but if I tell her, it will lose its meaning. I searched the Internet again. I found a good trail, but I don't know if I have to pay to keep my car at the trailhead.  &nbsp;  Happy B-day, Aunt C!

      I finished reading a book call  Interview with the Vampire  by Anne Rice. I've heard of this author before, but I didn't realized she was from so far back. 1976 is the copyright date. Well, as you may have guessed, the book was about a vampire. Pretty twisted stuff, IMHO. Interesting views of detachment, sensation, and morality. In the context of this book, I think of myself as a vampire. I'm detached and far from real humanity. I see horrors or beauties and feel little if anything. And evil. Such evil I have done, but I won't be telling. It wasn't terribly illegal though. &nbsp; With my mental pysche appeased, let's turn to my auditory indulgences. While I've bought several new CDs, what I'm really listening to now is the soundtrack of  The Matrix: Revolutions.&nbsp; Damn it's good. The lead singer of Hives once said that good rock is only sung in english. I reply that good classical music is only sung in anything but english. I'm not sure what Neodummerang is sung in, probably Hindi since it quotes the Upanshanids. But whatever it is, it's freekin' good. Buy this CD. No money? Sell your children, or steal one and sell him. *sigh* This CD reminds me why I like classical. You just can't get that mental rush from other genres. &nbsp; We're babysitting&nbsp;a small boy named Riley. By "we" I mean Kristen. I just love his blunt, innocent comments on life. He said I look like a girl (long hair) and I had a very messy room (self-explanatory). Ah, for such youthful exuburence. Wait, no, I don't want it. I like being tall and cynical of humans. It's more fun.

      My mother has been inquisitive lately as to my plans for the summer. To be honest, I have not even told you, O blog of mine, my future endeavors. Suffice it to say that they involve camping. She wonders where I will camp, how I shall prepare for it, and more. I don't like her knowing though, mostly because of a recent strain of teenage independance I've caught. I told her I planned to camp for 2 weeks and she balked. Too dangerous, too long, too little preparation. Honesty again, I'm okay with this danger. It will be different than other dangers. Skydiving and bungee jumping are false recklessness as there is always an emergency parachute or a safety line. In my plans, there is no tether leading me back home to security. I want it that way. Too long is too bad. I need it to be long. Too little preparation I agree with. I plan to find a nearby DNR office and get registration for camping. I'll ask them where's a good place nearby to do some dispersed camping (camping outside of campgrounds).  Went to Hages and bought some CDs I've been meaning to buy. Five Iron Frenzy and GS Megaphone. Good bands. Too bad I lost my MP3 player at camp. Oh, yeah, forgot to mention that one. Well, I took it to lab one day and left it in the room. I went back and it wasn't there. Albert saw me listening to it but didn't see were I put it. It may indeed be stolen for all I know. This really sucks. That was my best pasttime and perhaps the most expensive thing I own. I'll have to call Lost & Found at U of M again to make sure it is gone for good.

      Have you ever realized how beautiful a sunset is? Just sitting there, watching that great globe of fusing helium nuclei fade out of view. I really don't see enough sunsets. I've got tickets to one per day and I'm not even using that. To think, I'm missing such a thing because I'm lazy.  Well, I'm back from camp. Things have changed and moved on since I've left, for bad or good. They got rid of my favorite Slurpee flavor, Mountain Dew, and replaced it with "Pepsi" which looks and tastes like Coke. My family seems to have used my sleeping quarters and private sanctuary as a dumping grounds of sorts. My mother promises to help clean up tomorrow which is alright.  I forgot to mention: Emily wasn't the only religious discussee I had the pleasure of during camp. Nisanth (sp) and several other persons of varying faiths spoke with me as well. I received a compliment for my valient defense of my faith: I was the only guy Dan (another Dan, if you can believe it) knew who could answer his questions quick off the tongue. I felt like Paul, debating with the Jews in their synagogues over the Messiahhood of Jesus.  Also, on a more gory note, there were gamers in that camp. I guess one should expect it, as the standard debater is white, male, and prone to fits of mass geekdom. I was a decent player and a welcome addition to the team. We downloaded an Unreal Tournament 2004 demo and played Onslaught until the computer lab closed.

      Is it wrong to find joy in adversity? Example: I've been sent on a wild goose chase today, running between the Dennison building, the Shapiro library, Angel Hall, Starbucks, and Dollar Bill in a dual quest for delivery and collection of needed goods (caffience-loaded drinks and evidence, the two forces that drive debaters like me). Some people who should have had the evidence didn't or weren't there or just sent it elsewhere. Any normal person would find this confusing (don't you?) and annoying. But I don't. Strange. You see, I think God has a twisted (as in weird or strange) sense of humor. I respect that and have learned to enjoy it, even...especially in trying times. Also, I ended up with a Viente Tazo Chai Frappe and I'd hunt any goose for that.  Forgot to mention yestday: finished  Lord of the Flies . If any book would make me a vegetarian, it is this one. The crude hedonistic hunts they went on sickened me. But I do not believe all meat hunting is bad. The protaganists of the story ate meat readily. As long as the focus is on the end (meat), and not on some sadistic drive to end life, then it is good. Also, I liked his portrayal of human nature. Very Calvinistic, and psychoanalytic as I realize now. I never noticed how relativly similar Freud's and Calvin's views were before.

      Never discuss politics with your girlfriend. Ever. You hear me, fellow low-rung climbers of the intelligence ladder? Never,ever, EVER (you catch this?!?), talk about politics. Why don't I realize this? I hate politics, wish it would die. But still, everything is political eventually. You can't escape; it's like air or stupid people, always there, always around you. We've talked about situations before: pre-emptive strikes, Bush's knowledge or lack thereof.   (here's where I start talking about my views. If I insult you, stop reading my blog. If I don't...meh.)  But the shit hit the fan when we spoke of speech rights. Look, I'm a libertarian. Freedom of everything,   especially   freedom of speech. I like freedom in a box, I like freedom with a fox. I even like freedom in a can. I do, I do, Sam I Am. I used to believe that freedom of speech should be detracted for military reasons (how do you keep up moral when some fucker is running around saying you should dodge the draft?), but my misguided leader Bush killed that for me. The War on Terror will never end. There will always be people who dislike the US and therefore there will always be extremists to hate all the more. So, in order to keep speech from being permanently short-changed, I've got to believe even war shouldn't keep us from talking. But Emily disagrees or seems to. It started as a discussion about  whether  speech is limited and ended as a tussle over  if  speech should be limited. Emily made the good point that speech is limited in schools, I say, screw that, I'll wear a 2-foot crucifix and ceremonial robe to school if I freekin' want! Come on, government, try to stop me and my blatant religousity. I hate France because of this: they restrict religion in the classroom. The school of America should be a place of free learning, not stale textbooks and equally stale discussions! I'll dare any religious man of another faith to fight me over God. Anyone! And once again, no school bureacracy has the right to restrict my constitutional 1st amendment rights. Emily said that certain speech should be restricted because it can be dangerous. Example: Hitler's anti-Semitic talks led to the deaths of millions. I say, it was not only his antisemitism but his restriction of pro-semitism that led to deaths. Literally hundreds of Christian pastors were killed or defrocked by the German government for their attempts to promote such views. I say, let the dangerous speak but also let the right and peaceful speak. If Hitler wants to hate the Jews, fine, but let my homies and me like them. It is only when some view is taken out of running that fists fly and necks are put agaisnt the wall. It's because they don't want us talking, not because they can talk.  Poonam says I should be more social. Fat chance. I don't know why I'm not social, but I'm not and almost assuredly never will be. I was born to be alone (or at least alone with God) and plan to follow this path until divine providence shows a better one.  I'm not so sure about my relationship with Emily now. It was going good, but political disparaties and stupid acts (totally on my part, of course) are dragging us down. She is no longer the quiet nameless girl I know from Debate. She has a name, a persona, and damn well will defend it. Can I tolerate these gaping divides in our ways? Not really. Only a repressive communist regime "accepts" differences. I refuse to simply give up my beliefs and numbing nod along to the music. I will respect her as a person, even as a friend and girlfriend, but heaven help me if I start "accepting" differences. One of the greatest reasons I believe in free speech, is that only through discourse can differences be defined and realized. Only by battling out my thoughts can I realize whether I am wrong or right. Therefore, I shall continue my ways, even if they annoy and pester. But, as always, I must choose my battles. And may they never be political.  I went to the dreadlock place today. It was a quick in-and-out as society frightens me and there is little more social than a hair salon. I learned that dreads are expensive. It's  $40 an hour for 4-5 hours. I may want to let my hair grow a little longer, so that they droop instead of sticking out. As stated I wait until after pictures for dreads. But I don't know if I'll wait one day or until after Debate. I know dreads will kill any political capital with conservative judges, and can only hurt my speaks. I know that people will view me differently and for the worse. But that never has frightened me and won't now (see. antisocial.). This will require further thought. I'm just happy to know that dreads can be made out of my incredibly Caucasian, straight, stringy hair.

      Apparently we get two days off for Independence "Day". Never noticed that since school's always out and paperboys don't get days off...ever. All the computer labs and many good stores have been closed the while due to this "day". But, hey, I ain't complainin'. More power to the working man, yo.  Strangely enough, despite the festivities, I don't really feel that patriotic. Maybe it's the fact that President Bush is destroying my hopes for a smaller government. Maybe it's my general dislike of all pre-emptive warfare. Maybe it's just because there are no formal fireworks displays here in Ann Arbor (WTF). Don't get me wrong, I love America. The freedom, the free education, the light Christian underscoring of everything, the blatant commerialization (scratch that one). But you can't oversimplify a country (Critical Geopolitics 101) and only consider it's postives. Well, I hang my little flag from my backpack in remembrance of all America. Oh, and the parade here's allright.  Money's running low. I'm beginning to fear returning home and having to explain a $170 expenditure to my parents. So I think I'll break it down here, as a lot of small expenses look better than a bunch of big ones.  $35                     Security Deposit $10                     Money lost to the copy card machine demons $12                     Copies actually copied $22                     Video Games (mostly Metal Slugs 4) $21                     Books (all of them on sale) $34                     Snacks and Frappes (mostly frappes) $22                     Dinner on Sundays $10                     New ID Card $6                       Remaining Liquid Funds (these are all extremely wide estimations on my part)  Ah, yes. Forgot to mention. I lost my M-Card. I went to Potbelly's with Emily, bought a sandwich, went to Borders, and returned to the dorms without a M-Card. I scoured my room, Potbelly's, Borders, and found nought. I've come to expect the inevitabliity of my losing things on trips. I'm just thankful it was only my M-Card (so far...).  There are a bunch of homeless people in Ann Arbor, or at least a proportionally higher number than in Roosevelt Parks (surburban middle-class utopia that it is). I wonder about giving money to them. It's obviously quite Biblical to give to the poor, especially when it's not for reputation-building. But I wonder if they really spend the money on gas or food or such or whether they buy drugs and alcohol with it. I'm too gullible to believe they aren't in some need yet too cynical to believe they are decent people. I'll give them change and run, I suppose.

      I have to admit, I may not agree with their fightings in Kashmir, overly bureacratic system of government, or major religious tenets, but Indians can make some awesome food. This was proven to me today, as I joined Emily, Poonam, Sheshe, Lindsey, and...some other guy for food at a Indo-Chinese restaurant. They had variety to a tee, with 175 different entrees and vittles to choose from. Their "chicken dish" (as I dare not even try to mutilate its name) was delicious and could be eaten on rice or wrapped in naan (bread). I also ordered a drink, that tasted of yogurt and some other flavor I could not pinpoint. Poonam was our guide on this culinary safari, saying this was good or that was tasty. India, I salute you.  A topic that has come up in conversation several times during camp is my desire to gain dreadlocks. Emily doesn't like the idea, but says it is my choice. My mom says that as well. Several girls have voiced the opinion in the negative. All this negative feedbackl, and there is a hair parlor a stone's throw away that could give me my naughty locs. Fear not, mother, I won't partake until after Senior pictures. But I do plan to walk into this parlor sometime during camp, and ask some questions about dreadlocks. I'm quite nervous though, and fear social contact of this sort like the Plague. I shall pray for bravery during adversity.

      Today was a high as well as a low. I rose and flew but I landed and waddled in the muck and grime.  As you may know, my ways have not been the ways of a true missionary. I am secluded in my social activities, undisciplined, and failing to bring up discussions that truly matter and in their stead bring up meaningless drivel and refuse to fill my faults. I have never started a conversation with the most forward of intents of giving my testimony, my reasons for Christianity. I've debated, ironically enough, the means and doctines of my faith, but never taught, never truly listened. When I spoke to one debater at camp, I was left with a cold feeling, a cruel loss somehow. I felt empty, spent, in need of a frappe or some form of rejuvenation. All of my discussions of God have started and ended wtih that feeling. All of this was true before today. I had a conversation with Emily that I can only hope to repeat with others again and again until I die, and that with a smile of accomplishment. We spoke of God, of Jesus, of man and the forgiveness of sin. We learned of each other's faith. And I told her my dearest secret, which I dare put in writing now:  The night after my Profession of Faith (a Christian Reformed spiritual event that means I am inducted into the Church as a full member), I was filled with joy. I walked the path and was pleased with the path I walked. I was a Christian of my own accord now. My parents lead and taught me, but this was my move, my choice, without any discussion with anyone. I prayed to God and reconfirmed my vows to him: to worship him alone, to love and plead for only his love, and to serve him and others through him and him through others. Then something happened. I know God has tended to use less direct confrontation in these waning years. He rarely sends angels and visions, and those that receive rarely see. But something happened that night; God spoke or at least sent a thought into my mind. Some may say that that thought was my own and I imagine it was from God, but I can state unwaveringly it was sent from above in the truest sense. It said. "Don't worry, Dan. I am with you." That's all. No, "Don't worry, Dan. I am the God you have followed all these years. No "Become a missionary, Dan, and teach my ways to the world." These were spoken to God in my promises, the ones I mentioned above. I say that this thought felt familiar to me, like I knew this God, as He knew me very well indeed. That is why I am a Christian. This God did not say he was Allah or Brahma or any other relgion's God. I am certain he is the God I have worshiped all these years.  A great question occured in my mind as Emily told me of her faith and incounters with God. How can God, if he is the God of the Christians, also reasure Emily in her choice of religion? Emily freely admits that she believes Jesus to simply be a man and nothing more. Calvin, I'm afraid, in all his brassness and straightforward speak, would say that Emily did not truly hear God or somesuch. I don't think that is true. I could hear truth in her words, and that was a bittersweet true. I don't know what to make of it. I must prayerfully consider this all, treasure it in my heart. Hope may come later.  This was the up. The down occurred in the debate we fought after this talk. It went painfully. Firstly, we dueled against a total novice, and a second-year. We bungled several arguments, ran things that we should not have run, didn't run things that we should...and so on. I fear to speak to Emly about all this, even in lou of our discussion. I hate critizing people, especially friends and even moreso partners. Even postive critism is a massive pain to produce. *sigh* If you read this, Emily, and feel you can accept a humble man's foolish thoughts, ask me of it.

      Like the new look? No? Good, because it is very temporary. I wanted the comments and title provided by a common template and not found on the blogskin with Aragorn in all his kingly splendor. The background will change when the times deem it necessary.  The fiery eyes and burning tongue, the cold retort, the bloody feud and warfare, and, in the end, the judgmental decree. Goodness, I enjoyed my first debate of the season. I'd say  we won, but there truly was no "judgemental decree" as it was only a "practice debate". Still, I say we won. It feels good to straight impact turn and weigh the round once more. I had a momentous adrenalin rush while preparing for the neg arguments (disclosure is required upon pain of...something truely nasty yet unmentioned), and that pulled through till the 2AR. Can't wait to go Negative. A slight downer to the debate was Emily and my inround symbiosus was strained and frayed. I will mark it down to first time partnering and hope for greater streamlining as the year progresses.   We've already decided on the 'mark' for our evidence and tub. It was a misformation of the letter "f' which looks quite like an explosive stick with wick and keg. I will try to replicate it more fully to inscribe it upon our storages and usables.

      Still haven't. Promised Mom I would tomorrow. Let's see if that holds.  I woke up today at 4:00 with a splitting headache. I took some decongestants and ibeprofen and took another nap until 9. A rare feat. Normally, when I awake, I stay as such. I'm thankful I didn't today, because that nap fixed my headache up swift and quick.  Well, I had my first date with Emily since the camping trip. Strange as it seems, she still tolerates me. She brushed off the negative energy built up over in U of M and says she enjoys my company. I hold my position as boyfriend for now. I admit, I'm quite surprised. Judging from her blog, I was as good as gone, doomed to be dateless until 2021 (the beginning of my next dating cycle...long story). Yet here I stand, alive and with girlfriend. Something few readers of D&amp;D literature can truthfully say.

      I tried to lap swim for the first time in my life. Not...a...good...idea. I never realized how draining prolonged swimming can be. I've only had to swim for short spurts and with plenty of treading and resting. I'll have to try this again.  Speaking of exercise, I'm feeling the burn. Or at least I was. Yesterday, my arms, back, and chest simmered in a dull yet persistent pain. My manboobs shot twinges of ache whenever I walked down the stairs. I honestly believe it was the best physical feeling I've encountered in my mortal existence.  I finally started reading  The Dark Elf Trilogy  by RA Salvatore. And reading...and reading. I stayed up until almost 1:00 AM even in the full knowledge that I'd be getting up at 6:00 to deliver the stenuous Sunday papers. It was that good to me. I really enjoy his descriptions of the battle scenes. And of a functioning matriarchy. I always knew letting the women rule would result in a chaotic society of calculating backstabbers, rank-obsessed warmongers, and demonic goddess worship. j/k. The feminists will eat me alive tomorrow. It also is interesting how I see all these megathemes within the book and worthy quotes to consider. I considered this no more than RPG fanatic guttertrash but I can think of trash far worse to read (The 7th Tower by Garth Nix comes to mind). Maybe it is because I'm looking for these themes and quotes now. It's a logical irony: when you're really looking for something instead of casually perusing, you tend to find things.  Didn't you get the memo? I starting to take a more analytical approach to my reading. I'm going through this book and underlining strong passages, circuling words I don't understand. The next book I read, probably  Walden  by Thoreau, I'll start writing my revalations in a notebook. I got 6 of them from Staples for 50 cents. Damn straight. $.50. I am elated beyond words. I'm also planning to take notes on sermons, friends, and discussions. To help me remember and to help me learn. It shall be the Year of the Notebook.  Speaking of sermons, Pastor Al asked a good question, "What am I doing here?" In church, he meant. I honestly couldn't answer "correctly". The right answer is to further my relationship with God through his mediator and my saviour Jesus Christ. The true answer is that I go to my church out of force of habit. I loathe the pastoring style of both head pastors. I timed Ron's Opening Prayer at 10 minutes 25 seconds. It was mind-numbing and spiritually tortuous. I should have liked Al's sermon: he spoke in the langauge of my people, the theologians. He discussed the importance of saying, "Thanks be to God" after the reading of the word. But a rebelious streak runs in me now, one that I must control for now. It is no good to strike against such an authority, even with only words. But the thought of testing another church and another pastor is savory to my lips.  Speaking of theology (this post just keeps branching, doesn't it?), I've finally found the core curriculum for Calvin College. I jumped for joy at this almost random success on the Calvin website. Now I know that many of my AP classes coincide well with the basic courses, and the courses I miss are either impossible to get at Mona Shores (religion classes) or worth taking in college (English classes). When asked what college I planned to go to, I countered with "Calvin." It felt so natural. Calvin is the logical choice: it's close so I can be near family and debate for possible assistant coaching, it's big, it has all the majors and study areas I want and awesome profs, it's relatively cheap (to other colleges of it's grandeur), and the atmosphere is just deafening in its Christianness. But I will call upon other colleges in that sweet paranoia of my life: that the heathens gods of college application will keep me from blessed Calvin, and I shall be forced unto some lesser dwelling.

      And, truly, what village were they from. But I digress. I've exercised for the first time at the Y. All previous trips were merely preporatory. I also got my picture taken for the photo ID, and already I smell the ugly. I'm not very photohygenic on my good days, and this was a summer morning (we're talking about 8:00 AM). Not good. So I'm a health flunkie now. I can't explain why, but I have the strongest sense that I'm not getting enough protein. I want to eat more meat and tofu and maybe some veggie dogs. But these areas are highly limited until the next grocery splurge. I'm taking a multivitamin as well. I have taken a vitamin since they were shaped like the Flintstones.  Speaking of photohygenic states, I chose a new hairstyle. It wasn't cut or conditioned at a barber or any other trained professional. I tried to tame the beast myself. I struck early in the morning, while the head-strapped creature still rested. A quick shower to subdue it and I combed it back into a ponytail. The beast retaliated, trying to break from it's new and uncommon bonds. The fore section succeeded and gained freedom in a matter of minutes, but the back remained in chains as a tiny stub of growth. I fear future revenge against my oppressive dictatorship coup de tat. I can hear the freedomfighters whisper their plans of violence retribution. Ready the tanks.  I'm not sure if I can continue reading Calvin's  Institutes . They're still worth reading, but it just isn't enough to keep my ADD teenage mind captivated. "The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak." Maybe I'll take a quick reading break and read my newest buy: Henry David Thoreau's Collection of Works. We've got  Walden  and a couple of his other works. I'm interested in how his wilderness experience worked out, that I may change mine to gather more spiritual gold from nature's bounty. Also, I may start my D&amp;D reading trash:  The Dark Elf Trilogy . You can't suggest this kind of trash to any friends, but it is a good way to relax and waste the mind after a mental binge on the  Institutes .

      Need I say more?        You're Togo!    Small, quiet, and very insecure, you could hide in just about any crowd.  Even a crowd of one or two people.  Even though you're virtually anonymous anywhere you go, you could have been wealthy if people hadn't mistreated you and taken your money.  This is probably most of why you're insecure.  But some people who study you hard think you're cute, so maybe you should try to open up a little.   Take the  urlLink Country Quiz  at the  urlLink Blue Pyramid             You're  Confessions !   by St. Augustine     You're a sinner, you're a saint, you do not feel ashamed. Well, you might feel a little ashamed of your past, but it did such a good job of teaching you what not to do. Now you've become a devout Christian and have spent more time ruminating on the world to come rather than worldly pleasures. Your realizations and ability to change will bring reverence upon you despite your hedonistic transgressions. Florida will honor you most in the end.      Take the  urlLink Book Quiz  at the  urlLink Blue Pyramid .    They picked some good books for the book quiz. I'm impressed.

      But first, drum roll please *orchestra readies the massive drum of Doom*...Web Quiz Time! Whee!

Here is how you matched up against all the levels:      Level    Score       Purgatory   (Repenting Believers)   Very High       Level 1 - Limbo   (Virtuous Non-Believers)   Moderate       Level 2   (Lustful)   Low       Level 3   (Gluttonous)   Moderate       Level 4   (Prodigal and Avaricious)   Very Low       Level 5   (Wrathful and Gloomy)   Low       Level 6 - The City of Dis   (Heretics)   Very Low       Level 7   (Violent)   Low       Level 8- the Malebolge   (Fraudulent, Malicious, Panderers)   Low       Level 9 - Cocytus   (Treacherous)   Very Low       Take the  urlLink Dante's Inferno Test    Yeah...that sounds about right. It's normal to have about 3 major mental disorders right? Also, this is good for me. I don't believe in purgatory. Heehee.  My plans continue. I've scheduled a walk-about at the YMCA for 4:00 tomorrow. I still haven't worked on my resume. Well, I started, but then I got sucked into a 4 hour bout of  Fishy , a online flash game.  Fishy  is perhaps the most addicting thing that has ever happened to me. Quite fun.  Talked to Jillian today. First time I spoke to a definable "school" person all summer (excluded my girlfriend, of course). Always a pleasure.

      I finally got that vanity out of my room. Actually, my dad and siblings expunged the demon dresser whilst I was away in commitee. Speaking of commitee, I'm finally out of the Worship Commitee. Woohoo! It wasn't that bad, but I can't take the time constraint anymore, especially if I'm joining the Youth Leadership Commitee soon (does this constant parade of commitees ever end?!?[No]). Also, I finally joined the local YMCA. I plan to exercise regularly. Ha. Right. Let's see if I can pull that off.  Where I'm not going right now...well, I'm not doing my resume. I better start that ASAFP (guess what the "F" stands for). But I don't. I'm a terrible procrastinator. How long have I had these job applications now? 2 weeks? More? The mom machine is starting to ride on me to get this done, and with good cause.
