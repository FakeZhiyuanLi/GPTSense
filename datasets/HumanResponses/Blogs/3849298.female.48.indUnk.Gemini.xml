						   A group I newly joined sends out writing prompts.&nbsp; Today's is "write about packing a suitcase"  Ah the quintesential overpacker! Before choosing a suitcase one has to layout the outfits for the trip. This not only involves the&nbsp;external apparel but the underclothing as well.&nbsp; There is a right bra and panties for each outfit.&nbsp; A back up outfit has to be considered along with the reserve lingerie. Don't forget about shoes, socks and hose.&nbsp;   Packing is not simply removing some things and placing them in a zip up box. Things need underthing and accessories as well. Makeup, personal hygiene, hair dryers and the like. Travel iron because of crammed packing. Thank heavens I'm not a pretty or vain woman!   The preparation for packing may involve up to a week of developing a list that is built from the itinerary.&nbsp; Most of the packing is to be done the day before. The bag is left open so as to make adjustments according to the Weather Channel or an impromptu addition to the schedule and of course my mood. My husband on the other hand, does a load of laudry the night before and stuffs it into a duffle bag. A pair of shoes and he wears the sneakers.&nbsp; All black socks and toothbrush. How does he do it?

						    Today was long for no particular reason. Work was going on, no boredom but time seem to drag. Isn't it strange how a a day like that drains? Worked on several things and got them done but the word&nbsp;"accomplishment" doesn't work.&nbsp;There are days like that.  &nbsp; But what do you do with days like that?&nbsp; Give in and be lazy after the work day is done?&nbsp; I worked 2 hours overtime and it seems like 12. My original plans were to finish a collage art project but inspiration is stifled. I did admire the work I had done last night. It makes me smile.&nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps it is wise to relax and go with the slow flow. It gives me another day to think about how to approach the&nbsp;project tomorrow. I am excited about recieving someone else's project in the mail.  &nbsp; For now, just chill and&nbsp;re-energize.&nbsp;

						   Recently began to experiment with collage and altered books. It is something like going back to grade school and making something of great signifigance. It is collecting pictures, patterns of papers, stuff called empherma (baubles, trinkets and cool stuff to embellish your work).&nbsp; Tonight I worked on a page that will be sent to another person.&nbsp; She will (I hope) attach this page into her altered book. In a few days i will recieve on from another member of the same group.&nbsp; It is a cool idea, meeting others and sharing a part of you (your art). These pages criss cross the country and bring a person into your home you might have never met otherwise. It's great gift. I'm anxiously waiting to recieve mine as well as send mine out. I'll be checking the mail like a kid waiting for a package from grandma.

						   Warm day but a cool night.  My husband and I sat on the back porch for a few hours reading. It was nice to be a bit lazy for the evening.  I finished a book. Actually I sped read it.  It was about anxiety and fears etc. I had read 2 of the author's books many years ago and learned a lot of wisdom.  Her new book was sitting on the New release shelf at the library so I picked it up. It's not that I'm particularly feeling anxious or afraid. I tend to have anxiety but not any things as the paralytic fear of 12 years ago.  Reading the book felt good.  There was much I had learned and knew. The book was an affirmation of sorts. There was a chapter devoted to anxiety in the workplace. Budget cuts, layoffs, increasing production with a shrinking staff etc. causes a general anxiety in the work place.  In that atmosphere people react by underfunctioning and overfunctioning.  If in the workplace there is luck enough to have people who can function in stress, their work in minimized by the rest of the dysfunctional unit. Anxiety spreads.  This was new information to me. I just assume I'm neurotic and everyone else is okay. Whew. Good background on my understanding about what happens at work and how I react.  Felt good. Knowledge is power.

						   Today was wearing. Taxing. It's not that cases were hard. Sometimes you just want to bang your head when talking with people. My tolerance was low. In those situations you do not react how you feel. Take notes and try to disseminate the facts. I get back to the office and feel stressed.  I return some phone calls and do some paperwork. Eventually I asked to take my lunch hour at the end of the day. It was a good thing to do.  I wandered through the library.  Found some books on collage art. In trying a creative outlet, the subject of altered books appeals to me.  Collage work can be a big part of the altered book. Found a book on herbs and a novel and away to home. Took a nap, had dinner and the world looks a tad better.  Sometimes you gotta take care of yourself.

						   All America growns as they travel back to work after a long holiday. I amongst the mass of desperation for the sustenance of life bravely returned to my cubicle.  Why is it four day weeks are longer? It wasn't so bad.  I supervised a visit between a mother and her 2 week old child.  She's having some issues but watching her with the child sparked hope. I then went on a report of a child wandering the streets at 1am. However, the concerned citizen didn't call the report in until late morning. A bullshit report but I had to go out.  In the course of investigating this wayward child, I met up with Sam.  Sam is cook in an institution but not for long.  Next week he is opening a restaurant. He glowed like a new mother. We chatted for awhile. Soon we talked about where we grew up and it wasn't far from each other in a city far far a way.  Small world. Returned to the bureaucratic machine. Files, papers, calls before I knew it the day was over. Not too bad today.

						   Email, blogs and jobs....Marriage, kids, friends. It is a lot to live up to. St. Paul talked about being all things to all people.  Not sure that's something I can do. Yet day by day I do. My hope is that I can choose wisely and keep the commitments to those close to me. I receive so much from them, they are hardly aware. Inspiration and tutoring is more than I can ever give back.  Gratefulness fills me heart. Live simply love grandly.

						   Can't believe it's been that long since I last blogged. But it ties in to what 's been happening or non happening. Life feels like going in slow motion. Little progress in any aspect. Then physically not feeling right.  For the past three weeks "hot flashes" have begun.  It surprised me and yet it shouldn't. I am 48 and female. It's just was unanticipated. I had a hysterectomy at 26 and never really thought of the equipment "down there" as an issue. Now I'm angry. Since I bypassed that whole menstrual stuff thought I wouldn't have to deal with it.  It bother's me... a lot. A lot about aging and losing who I am.  Tears well up as I type. I hadn't expected those thoughts to emerge.  I've been feeling very detached and growing further from living. I do I perform but there is much that is missing. There is that tendency to ignore what feels uncomfortable but this is a slide deeper. And so it means a round with the shrink to tweak the meds and a visit to the Gman for an evaluation of the equipment. That's what you do after a few weeks of feeling like this. Other people don't have to go that route,I'm glad for them. Most times I don't seem to mind because it is taking care of myself. Today it feels that it is a necessity to function.

						   That's the day today. I tried to pursuade a mother not to go back to her abuser. She did and I'm racked with guilt he will hurt her.  This case was unravelling before my eyes like a bad Lifetime movie. She is a free moral agent but her child is not. He is smart and knows there is insufficient evidence not yet anyway.  I could do nothing to stop the reunion. My stomach hurt my soul is depleted.

						   Mentally and emotionally exhausting day. I am working with two separate families each with their own domestic violence (DV) issues.  All of a sudden these women have decided to go back to their abusers. I do not understand why I would risk my children's lives and risk having them removed to do such a thing. Is their need greater than the kids that they'll get "love" in any package?  In this job you can't ask WHY. It's just not that simple. Why do adults hit each other?  Because they choose to. They make the choice.  It is not "impulse control" drugs/alcohol or bad childhood. These factor in the equation but it boils down to choice and a refusal to see their partner as a human with dignity. Bastards. Why do they go back? Financial, fear of being alone but again a choice to put themselves and kids in danger. I don't get why.  My job is not to understand but to explain the consequences of everybody's actions. Make a choice. Yoda said "Choose wisely".  The puppet gets it.

						   It seems this writer has not followed through with the prompts on a daily basis. One prompt does not make a writer of practice.  A source of frustration has hit me not only in the writing area.  It seems very rare that I am alone. Two of my adult sons live with me and a friend of theirs until the end of August.  Yesterday my youngest son said " I'm coming home! (Be still my heart!!). I love them dearly but I have less privacy then whan they were children.  They are well mannered and behaved. My husband and I don't necessarily agree about telling them to get out but we are getting closer on those thoughts.  I want to write, experiment in art and other things. And I do but it feels like selfishness. And of course if they left I would worry. But they are 23, 25 and 28! Not babies.  It is me who can't let go.     Enough for now.  Let's start this week with doing 3 of 7 prompts.
