      Well started the day as usual.. nothing interesting. just remembered my experience with my hairdresser 2 days ago.. i have waist length straight hair and suddenly decided to chop it off.. so i went to the same hairdresser that i went few weeks ago for my trim. she saw me and ask me how short i want it to be this time. i told her shoulder length and she gave me that squeal and ask me if i'm really sure. well of coz i said yes and she started preparing the stuff. after getting ready and she was sitting behind me to do the first snip, there was suddenly total silence but i can feel that she already tugged at my hair just waiting for the scissors to do its work. there was about 5-7 sec of silence and stiffness and i began to wonder wat is she doing behind me.. all of a sudden, she tilt her head to the side, looked me from the mirror and said,"Cut ah?". i laughed immediately and told her to carry on. she loved my hair more than i do and too sayang to cut it off. den i heard her saying to herself,"aiyah! dont want to cut so short la. a bit longer." after that only i heard the scissors start snipping away.. by that tym i was really laughing out loud. here i was ready for a new look and she cant bear to cut my hair short. well aniwei i like my short hair now.. easier to maintain.. yay!!

       well its after national day today and i'm back at work. its still a school holiday but not a public holiday. i went out in the eve yesterday to watch fireworks at the stadium. the routine i always do evry national day. sadly enuff, my darling doesnt want to accompany me to watch the fireworks as we went to watch the preview the day before. he would prefer to chill at hm rather than get squashed in the crowds. well, he doesnt share my sentiments dis tym. its something i like and he doesnt want to do it. i was so sad. den i ask my bestfren nani to come along and she said she will bring her bf. well its fine w me though its gonna b my first tym to go out w both of dem. dey were so loving couple. well its their courtship days now. mine was long over!!! sigh. i was pretty pissed at my bf so i told him tt i'm goin to stadium all by myself. he didnt even budge. sigh again. so all nite i still stick on to my story tt i was all alone watching. n theres quite a num of pple tt teased me as i was alone. it was not true la but i juz wanna make him guilty. the fireworks was great though. after tt we went mcd to get a drink while waiting for the crowd to ease off first. we left at 10pm and headed straight hm. during the day i was practically slogging in font of the tv not doing anythin else. i shld have gone to the beach for a swim. but alas it has slipped my mind so the day was actually wasted.

       I guess it was my unlucky day yesterday. I was on my second day and was bleeding profusely and had no plans of going out although I was suppose to wait for my coffee table delivery. But since my darling is on night shift and he will be ard in the day, he told me that I do not need to come. So I was just lazing ard at home watching tv and I stained my shorts twice in 1 hr. That was how bad my bleeding is. Den my bestfren called and ask me to accompany him to buy shoes at queensway. Well i said oki. I left hm abt 4.30and need to pay my fees first and as I was walking, there is 3 bikes who jus blow passed me with the intention of showing off. I was turned off and kinda like pissed. Not a minute later, I heard a bang and wen I turn to look, one of the bike actually had an accident. The rider hit the centre divider and I was grinning from ear to ear and almost laugh as I felt it was their retribution. Hahah!!!! I called my darling n told him all abt it. He told me I was cruel to laugh but I was more satisfied. Then disaster strike! Juz as I put down the phone w him, my sandal broke! I was oready late and yet to nd pay my fees. So I just dragged myself to the nearest shop n had to get myself a sandal. A cheap one so it was hurting my feet. But I told myself it was jus temporary and will get another one wen I reach queensway. I was 1/2 late to mt my fren n he was oready grumbling. At queensway, I lost my i/c!! How? It fell into a tiny slot at the atm machine. Stupid way of losing my i/c. Have to make a report and have to wait for their reply. Den I realise my pay is not in yet and I'm already spending unnecessarily. Bought another better sandal there n I threw away the cheap one. I wont be using it anyway. Gosh!!! Wat an unlucky day for me!
