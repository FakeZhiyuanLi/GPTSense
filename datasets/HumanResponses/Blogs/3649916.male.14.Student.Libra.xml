      Wow i havent written in this for like 3 days.  I have actually been out with my friends.  For nearly 3 months I had stayed inside playing UO and today yesterday and the day before I went to the river with my friends and then went to bed.  It is awesome all we do is light a fire, drink, talk, tan, and swim, i mean doesnt get better then that.  I am in such a happy mood right now.  One of my friends ran away from home and it is super funny, i mean he took all the clickers from his house lol.  Tomorrow me, and my friend are going to get super loaded and do dumb shit! it is gonna be fucking awesome.  Right now i am listening to some alexisonfire and loving it because they are like the best.  Well i dont have much else to say, but peace out and have a good summer.  I know i am so far!

      Yesterday i wrote in my blog about the day before yesterday but not yesterday itself. I fell asleep as soon as i got home from my grandparents heh.  I had exams in the morning, English one first, and that was fairly complicated, did not do well....I have the second part of the English Exam tomorrow that will probably be easy, all i have to do is write a multiparagraph essay in 1 hour and 10min about dreams or wishes.  That is 2nd period, than the rest of the periods i just have normal classes.  Wed is the last day of school pretty much we have a barbecue and an assembly VERY easy day.  Thursday i get off because i do not have exams, and then friday i have to wake up at 8 :30am to take my Math exam which will be very easy because I am a math whiz.  Today in UO i did not do much at all, i stole some things and planted some new plants that i can sell for fair amounts of money in the end.  I did not do much stealing unfortunately.  I havent been in an excellent mood this week so far...HAH what am i talking about it is monday.  I am sort of in a bad mood though, last day i will see my friends for a long time, i am sure one day or two i will go out and get drunk with them lol, that will be fun when i do that!  But then i will be alone for the rest of the summer, just me and my computer.  Also these next 2 days of school are the last days i will ever see or talk to the girl i like, i cant believe it i get a crush on one girl finally, and she moves away...this sucks.  Even though summer is going to be not very exciting i will get drunk as much as possible, many of my friends want to see me drunk because they have not seen me drunk before, and it will be hilarious for them to see me like that....the only problem will be getting home.  But i am sure i wont have any problem with that, it will be fun to do that at least, I am thinking of doing it friday maybe i will ask some friends, they will know what to do haha.

      I am extremely exhausted today.  i never got to write in my blog yesterday because i fell asleep on the couch and was just too tired to write in it when i woke up at 3:30pm.  I had been drinking again haha.  I have an exam tomorrow, it is an English one so i am not going to worry about it too much.  3 paragraph essay wupp di do. Today i went to the beach it was pretty warm out, actually extremely.  All the babes comforted me though haha.  Shaved my face for the first time today, feels extremely soft haha, I cant wait to grow it out in the summer.  I did not do much in uo yesterday, not many people on, i did steal some items to tick people off because it is extremely funny to me.  Right now i am at my grandparents so I have no access to the game so it really sucks.  My grandparents got home today, so hot.  I feel like an insomniac right now, i have huge bags under my eyes and extremely exhausted but do not goto bed.  When i get home i will do some homework review for math, it is all due tuesday!  Wow school is going by fast, only 1 week left then 2 months of complete relaxation.  Now all i need is an air conditioner for my tiny computer room....Ha i wish.  Its actually a pretty boring day, but still none the less extremely hot.  I cannot wait for the game Half-Life 2 to come out i have been waiting for it ever since it was announced to be made, and then the person hacked and stole the source code (fuckers).  Now i have to wait until like July, but it is going to be extremely worth it.  Chris listening to: nothing thinking: why am i so exhausted and, man was last night worth it

      It is extremely late right now haha.  I have no problem with that.  Today i had a little to much to drink, but it was still fun.  I wasnt very happy today more depressed.  Althought i am at my dads right now which rules, because it is usually super fun.  Today i did like nothing, the day went by extremely fast.  I have exams on monday, tuesday, and friday, then i am done school...for 2 months or however long it is.  In britannia today i did not do much, pretty boring day, one of my plants bloomed which is pretty awesome, and i am nearly done selling tons of stuff i stole.  I am going to sell other expensive stuff later and then just steal it back haha.  I found a cell phone on the ground today and charged tons of ringtones to it, hahah sucker!  I am going to break the cell phone later.  I am going to miss that one girl that I like it kind've sucks.  I cant even believe i am making the slightest deal about it, i have talked to her like 2 times, and said like 5 words because i am a big wuss.  I usually talk to her on msn but i think she blocked me or got a new account....oh well.  This weekend I am probably going to goto the beach it will be pretty awesome, I will see all the babes and still get a tan haha. My pe teacher is so dumb, mrs kilby is her name.  I will never forget her because i hate her so much, i cannot walk in pe without announcing that i hate her so much.  I hope that she gets shot and i never have to speak to her again, she wants to fail me in pe, what a fucking bitch.  At least i have c-  so she cant really do that.  I am going to bed now and i hope i have some form of happiness in my dream today, if i even have one.  I havent been getting much sleep lately anyways, it really sucks, i look like shit. One thing i realized today is how awesome technology is.  I mean i am not talking about little shitty cells that take pics.  I am talking about pocket organizers, that can be recorders, mp3 players, organizers, movie players, internet browsers, and cameras.  I mean its fucking awesome.  They are working on technology to work computers with your mind, just started.  in 3 years they will have tvs you can sew on your shirt i will love it haha, practically play videogames on my shirt in class haha.  Well i cant wait for spring break, im out cya  Chris listening to: nothing thinking: Whether or not i will get A in math feeling:  too many feelings to explain

      It is 1:18am and is getting kind of late.  I have been going to bed at this time lately, i just wake up and am super tired for the rest of the day.  At least the weekend is finally here.  I have exams monday and tuesday...also friday.  I didnt do much today just sat in my corner as usual.  Class went by pretty fast, Math was easy, me and my friend robert were text messaging eachother all classes so it was super awesome.  I cannot wait for summer vacation, i definitely want to goto warped tour but i am not aloud to go, noone to go with more like :(  Only 4 more days of seeing my friends for awhile...wow that sucks.  Also last like 3 days i ever see one girl, she is moving to New Brunswick it is extremely shitty.  Today in the world of Britannia, I did not do much.  Mainly i stole ingots from people which was entertaining because they get mad at me and then I just kill them because i am gm fencer hehe.  Then i sold plenty of items I have stolen.  Today was boiling hot, sooo sunny out i practically already cant wait for winter.  Even though i hate winter because it is extremely depressing and dumb dicks throw snowballs at me.  I have Math first period tomorrow, only doing a test and review, should be REALLY easy.  I wish I was out of school already like some others in Vancouver. I live in Squamish BC, very small town, kinda shitty alot of weirdos around here.  I am going to my dads this weekend, it is his Birthday AND fathers day, so i bought him a bottle of vodka, and a nice thing to put on his balcony.  Right now i am feeling kindve pissed off and depressed.  I do not know why I just go through this phase every once in awhile, i guess this is just what i get every once in awhile from kids making fun of me for no reason, which i believe is not cool.

      Its about time i went to bed.  Turns out the world developed a little more today.  I cannot wait for school to be over finally in 4 days.  Friday i write one exam and then i am done school!  I stole 10k iron ingots, 1 ethereal llama (3 month reward), 1k ingots, and 200k.  Who says thieves cant be rich :P.

      There was alot of activity in the world of Britannia yesterday.  I stole quite a few items and sold alot too.  I stole 10k ingots=100k gold in the world.  I sold many bulk order deeds for blacksmiths and tailors.  I have become the ultimate thief, and everyone thinks i suck.  Today has not been busy at all, I stole a few rings to piss people off for my pleasure, not very good ones but yet...still rings.  I went on my other character too and fought some mythical monsters called imps.  I am growing plants in the game also.  It will be interesting when they are finally finished.  I hope that later today the world gets busier, i am playing on a freeshard at the time and probably some time....someday i will move to pay to play ultima online, where the masters are!  It is almost the end of school and I cannot wait.  Its also kind of shitty because I will not see my friends or others for like 2 months because they are out busy doing things.  Also the one girl I ever liked is moving away, which is amazingly shitty.  Her name is Gillian, I am just adding this in for when i am in future and i look back at this hehe.  Exams in 3 days.  Cannot wait for the end.  The events of today were pretty bleak, nothing at all happened i was pretty moody today, dont know why but i was because of some other kids irritating me.

      Well there has just about been nothing going on this entire week, In UO i got a full house, and 5 million gold, but now that is all worthless.&nbsp; As of 10:47 am,&nbsp; the shard i played on has shut down and i have found a new one to play on.&nbsp; I am happy with the new shard i am playing on it is very satisfactory. The staff is nice, the skill gains are ok and much nicer enviroment, yesterday i started training my first guy, Hell i was up until 5:00am doing it hehe.&nbsp; I am making an archer mage so i can pvp (player vs player), it will be awesome once i get him set up, it is one of the most powerful templates in the game.&nbsp; Well of course before i go pvp i will have to get good armor and weapons, so that will take a few weeks, but it will be very worth it, i thought for awhile i was doomed but i am not at all, i found a new better shard so i am satisfied, the only thing i miss is my millions of gold hehe.&nbsp; Well my friends i must goto bed its 2:30am and i was up too late yesterday.&nbsp; Oh yeah i went to taco del mar today! Loved it so much, as i quote my msn name "their burritos are almost as good as having an orgasm", haha i love them so much will have to go there again.&nbsp; Talk to you later  Chris

      Well these past days have been fairly boring hehe.&nbsp; I went to the river one day but then i just found out that i cannot swim in river water because i just hyperventelate so i cannot breathe because of my asthma which really really sucks.&nbsp; Then my friend went on vacation so i have jack shit to do.&nbsp; The population on the shard i play on UO is slowly decreasing and everyone is moving into some shitty protected places, which sucks.&nbsp; My sister is gone for the week so i am happy though, i can still collect bods in my game so i still will be very happy lol, i collect 6 every bod run lol.&nbsp; and you can only get 1 for each char every 6 hours hehe.&nbsp; there was an earthquake here yesterday, well i am too tired to speak anymore right now so i will talk to you later &nbsp; Chris &nbsp; listening to : its been awhile by staind

      Wow i am going to bed earlier and earlier every night...this is not good i will have to find something fun to do from 2:30-4:30 haha.  Well today i did nothing at all with my friends all i did was argue with some dumb girl on msn and talk to some other hot one haha.  I also made a tailor in UO he is just about at 110 tailoring so i am satisfied with him.  I did not continue macro mining though i have 25k iron wow!  I cannot wait for my day tomorrow i probably will actually goto the river as long as the weather gets better, it has been cloudy as hell lately, wow i just realized my teacher is right, at the beginning of the summer the weather is really crappy haha.  Well i either am going on a 10 day trip to las vegas and california or going on a 7 day trip to mexico.  I would prefer mexico because i can tell management i am 18 and then DRINK ALL I WANT!!!!!!!!  hehehe i will be pissed every night but i will make sure to control it so i dont get to the point of no return...this is as long as we actually end up going on this trip hehe.  Well i cannot wait to goto bed so talk to you later  Chris

      Hey all lol.   Well today was fun i didnt do anything in UO at all.  All i did all day was macro mining because i felt like making some money so i could fill some deeds and then make money from getting the hammers that you get from deeds.  I went to my friend roberts house today it was pretty awesome.  We watched tons of futurama episodes from dvd and then played on comps.  Then we went in the other room to watch a freaking pauly shore movie.  We watched son-in-law.  It was freaking awesome bu-uddy hahahaha oh pauly shore.  Then i went home only to continue macroing in UO.  Wow not much to write about today amazingly.  I am thinking of emailing Michael Moore to tell him i really enjoyed his film Farhenheit 9/11 and tell him about my likes and dislikes of the presedential campaigns even though i am not even American.  You would be very surprised how will a 14 year old like me can follow the news with the internet haha.  I keep track of everything new.  Well cant wait to hang out with friends tomorrow.

      Well i dont know what happened yesterday or the day before but my internet was performing really crappily.  the day before yesterday i posted like 3 of same posts, but i didnt not mean to, it just auto did, weird.  And yesterday it was thunder and lightning out so cable crashed and i could not post.  Today was awesome.  I was at home on my thief until like dinner time around and then i went out with my friends the river.  Me , Russell, Johanna, and robert.  We all hung out at the river it was awesome, i mean how could it not.  The only bad thing about it was the fact that we did not have a fire because all firewood was damp from rain.  We then went to russells ate a little and i went home.  When i got home i macroed in UO and did nothing else.  At the moment i am macroing mining so i will get enough ingots to fill bods that i have.  2400 so far yay lol.  I cannot wait for tomorrow i will finally get chance to get ouw tith robert, and others in the middle of the day because today i left house at 6:30, and tomorrow i will leave in morning hehe. I didnt do much in UO maybe a little stealing i dont really remember.  But yesterday i stole another house and loved it hehehehehe.  I cannot wait to go out.  I may go on a 10 day trip to Las vegas and california with my mom, her friend, her friends daughter, her friends daughters friend, me, and my sis hehe.  It will be kinda uncomfortable sharing a room with a girl but oh well i will still masturbate hahahahaha.  Well i am going to goto bed now i am exhausted, talk to you in the morning.  Chris

      I dont know what buggered up with my internet connection but i did not post frick that pisses me off well i guess i will rewrite this.  Today i stole 2 houses in UO it was very exciting for me because 2 houses full of stuff is worth alot of money in the world of UO.  Today i also watched the movie Mystic River.  It was an excellent movie done by Clint Eastwood.  I thought the entire movie was excellent except for one part where a teen finds out his friend and brother killed his gf and he punches his friend in the face like at least 20 times, and kicks his brother in the head a good 7-8 times.  I kinda felt like i could feel him kicking me but i dont know i just did not like it at all.  Sean Penn and Tim Robbins were excellent at acting out the parts of these peoples lives.  I cannot wait to get out to goto the river with my friends tomorrow it has been a week since i got shitfaced at Russells LOL.  Well im out  Chris  Going to bed

      Well today was awesome.  Well i did not do much.  I did not go out with my friends but i did stay in and play UO.  I stole 2 houses worth of stuff while scamming it was the best thing i had done while playing on this shard hehe.  I also stole many different things.  I also scammed someone by doing a little trick thing kinda hard to explain seeing as you guys dont even know what happens or what i am talking about lol so i wont take my time explaining.  I also watched the movie mystic river today, i think it was an excellent production done by Clint Eastwood and Sean Penn and Tim Robbins were both EXCELLENT in it.  I did find one part disturbing it was when a kid finds out that his friends killed his girlfriend so he punches one of them in the face about 20 times and then gets to the other one and kicks him in the face about 7-8 times, i kinda felt like i could feel it, it kinda startled me but i dunno.  The rest of the movie i loved and i believe was very well played out.  I think i am going to goto bed now and tomorrow i will go out with my friends to the river finally getting out of the house after getting shitfaced at russells haha.  Well im out  Chris  Going to bed

      Not much happened today at all.  I woke up at 10:30am and sat on the computer for almost the entire day haha.  I helped my mom in the morning with recycling because i was paid.  I then was taken out for dinner to the Japenese Restauraunt in town because i was good.  When i went home i played some uo.  I have been stealing so much stuff in it lately its hard to count hehe.  I initally started blogging so i could keep a log of what i stole every day but instead i decided to write about my day, and what i think about some subjects.  Today though i also watched fahrenheit 9/11.  It was probably one of the most amazing documentarys i have seen in my life.  I mean some parts showed how much of an idiot George Bush is.  It also shows all the people who had suffered because George Bush started this war in Iraq.  I had no liking of him from the beginning to start, and i believe myself even before i saw this movie that they had no reason to wage a war against iraq.  I think he is an imbecile if not worse....wait he is worse wayyyy worse haha.  Well i think i am going to sign off now and goto bed, thank god that movie is over, for i am extremely exhausted.  I cannot wait for tomorrow i am done being grounded YAY.  Me and my friends will probably goto the river or something, maybe even get drunk if i feel like it ha.  But of course if i do i will be drinking responsibly so i dont fall over and not get back up again and possibly die.  Chris  Going to bed

      Not alot going on right now.  I was about to finish watching Farenheit 9/11 but right now i am just wayyy too tired to finish it.  I watched almost half of it and I LOVE IT.  I think michael moore is a genious he came up with some of the most controversial but very very interesting topics about george bush and comparing him to the al qaeda, taliban, afghanistan, iraq, and saudi arabia.  When i finish the movie tomorrow I probably will go out and see it in theatres on the weekend because i like it sooo much.  I did not do much today i came home at 11:30am and played UO until i started reading the news around 11:30pm, and then i put farenheit on.  Well my mom still wont let me leave the house tomorrow so i am going to have to laze around for a day, but it will be worth it in the end when i finally get to goto the river and get properly drunk so i dont pass out and nearly die.  I do realize one thing, i will never drink vodka again for a month or so lol, because i took a sip yesterday and almost vomited thats how bad the memories that come back are.  Well i am going to get a deed for my blacksmith in UO right now before i goto bed, talk to you later  Chris  going to bed

      Today was pretty cool.  Actually pretty shitty it felt kinda like we were cursed lol.  We went to some shitty place to pick up a printer took us hours to find it because we got lost.  Then when we thought all was fine we went to Wendy's to enjoy a nice lunch.....everything was fine until we realized half way home my sister had left her purse there....great just great.  We got there, lucky for her sake it was there, we drove home only to remember that another car of ours needed to be picked up from the garage, so we went to hop in the rental car when we realized....the battery was dead GREAT.  My dad got someone from BCAA to come over and jump the car and i got to watch Star Trek Nemesis :D :D lol.  Then once everything was settled we sat down to watch The Godfather to remember Marlon Brandow's death.  It was actually an excellent movie, we then watched somethings gotta give which was an ok movie, but it still had its fare share of romance in it.  I tried to drink some vodka today lol, bad idea i almost vomited just tasting it that will take probably 1 month to forget how horrible it tastes...but even then i will still remember that night.  I got my hair cut 2 inches it is still long but i dont like it lol, it looks....suspicous like a criminal lol, looks like its been cut more then i asked for but i did not question the hairdresser because i doubted that she would just lie to me for no reason.  Not alot in the news today, not even in technology wow that sucks, i like to do my daily newsreading but still there was like nothing to read about except for marlon brandos death.  Hehe but i did get the pleasure of reading a National Enquirer front page: Mary-Kates cocaine addiction, they now believe that she had a cocaine addiction and had lost weight from all the drugs, im not positive but it still is pretty possible.  In Ultima Online i went hunting which pretty much pissed me off lol, so i decided to raise my stats so my guy would be way better.  I am good at Player vs Monster, but not Player vs Player (PvM, PvP.)  A girl that i know and am friends with got drunk today, i am not all that sure that i like that, i mean we are good friends and i didnt really expect her to do that, but she did...oh well her life not mine (even though i get drunk as much as i can haha.)  I think that once i finally get home i am going to have to goto the river with my friends, or at least hang out with them, its been so long lol, ever since Sunday when i got loaded lol.  I think if i do get drunk later some other time i most likely will just drink plenty beer, and a little bit of rum, that way i wont vomit from binge drinking.  I only realized today that i only have to go through 3 years of school, i mean that still is alot but i never really thought about how really it is farely short lol, well you know what i mean.  Although once i get out i probably will goto BCIT asap, or get a job for a year or something so i can afford to live in an apartment lol.  I wanna see spiderman 2 that looks wicked, me and my dad will probably go see it next weekend, because right now seeing as it has been out for only 3 days it is probably PACKED.  Well thats really all i have to say right now.  Chris  Talking to: noone Listening to: nothing thinking of :gillian and how hot she is lol

      Man i havent written in this in awhile i have been so busy.....and grounded lol.  I went to the river for the rest of the time, but then on last sunday i got piss drunk and i mean piss drunk.  I got so drunk that i could not move, they had to get 3 19 year olds to lift me into a buggy and wheel me home.  When i got home they dumped me on my lawn and had to drag me inside...my mom had to help with this lol.  When I woke up i was on the couch in my garage...wow what an amazing night, i thought to myself i got home all alone no help i mustve had fun.  I go upstairs and my mom tells me the entire story HA HA.  Well this weekend i went to the beach, got to look at all the babes....oh wait what am i talking about it is still weekday, oh well i went to the beach anyways.  Tomorrow i have to get some hair cut off...shitty.  Then i get to go back to the beach and check out the chicks again....I love vancouver haha.  When i get home I will beat the game i have been playing for awhile..Farcry.  I still play ultima online quite often almost 24/7 but i still like to have my fun with 1st person shooters.  in UO i have been playing on my thief and my warrior lately, been having a little fun killing shit in dungeions, its still really awesome even though i am super rich lol.  Oh yeah happy canada day lol, i celebrated that too just completely slipped my mind right now.  I cannot wait to be ungrounded and to get home so i can do something productive with my life lol, like going down to the pirate lagoon (hangout at river).  Its awesome there i mean a fire, some water, could practically do anything...except if we got caught by the fire department it would be so dumb.  Well talk to you later  Chris  Talking to Robert Listening to: Growing on me by the darkness

      fuck yes my internet is back, the last time i posted would be about 2 weeks ago. That is because about 2 days after i posted my modem fell and broke!!! i had to switch services and pay for the modem, i got it all setup just the other day so i never goto write in this. HA my mom blames me for the modem even though it was noone that is what really pisses me off she keeps thinking im lieing i mean geez, just because i lie sometimes doesnt mean i lie 24/7. Yesterday i saw spiderman 2 it was wicked, better then i thought i think it was better then the first one, and they sure set us up for the next one. I think the next one there will be 2 villains teamed up. I cannot wait to get doom 3. I am downloading it as we speak, been waiting for this game for a long while, i have a feeling it is going to be wicked.
