           My grandmother is the last surviving family member that I have.  Wait, no...that is not right.  She is the last surviving family member that I am proud to be related to.  She is the only family that I love, respect, and look to as an example of what is right.  She lost her mate a year ago, and things have been progressively collapsing within her life.  My mother and uncle, spend their time doing what they each feel is best for her.  This means their time is spent at odds with each other.  My uncle wants to spend the sizable estate on vacations, new cars, and home improvements -for himself.    My mother wants to absorb as much guilt, pain, and despair, as possible -for herself.  (catholicism at its best.)  My grandmother has been reduced to the role of a sick pet, or wayward friend.  She's tired.  She does not want to argue or fight with anyone.  So, she let's my uncle put her in a POW camp / retirement home.  "In her best interest" he will sell her home of sixty years.  He will also go on cruises to Alaska with the money.  My mother will torture herself, while torturing my grandmother with exercises and medicines.  83...how many exercises and pills would I care for, if I had very little to look forward to, tomorrow?  'The pictures of my son's beach trip to FL, just don't fill the days like my mate of sixty-plus years did.'  She just wanted to "fade away" in the home that she loved...surrounded by memories that she loved.  Now, she is in a box of unfamiliar smells and sounds.  There is no fading away in this prison...death is a disturbing, disgusting invader.  (-but not an invader like my relatives selling her possessions on eBay.)       As I type this, and wonder what picture my uncle will have on his christmas card this year?  I wonder how many hours did my mother sleep last night?  I would ask my grandmother, but my uncle won't let me write her anymore...my calls are screened out.  We have talked about so much over my years.  Now, it seems everyone has forgotten that you can talk TO her...not just at her, or about her.  You f*cks!  Why don't you spend some time with her -talking about what she wants to talk about?        I miss him too, grandma.         You f*cks are spending her money, and telling her where and how to spend the last of her time!        My grandmother is the last surviving family member that I have.

           I am only up to 8 times a day.  (running a mile)  Half-way through the year...and the resolutions are starting to look like impossibilities.  The other resolutions are progressing at the same pace.  $30,000.00 in credit card debt, has been reduced to around $22,500.00.  Have I been cursing less? Some of the f*ck*ng time.  I resolved to sleep less.  It made sense at the time, but now I am too tired to think about why.  Health insurance?  Well, it's not like I'm involved in any strenuous activity...(this is me, running into a wall.)  Enjoy the holidays.  Hmmm...    Should the holidays, NOT be celebrated as much as regular days?  Why should people ever need an excuse to celebrate something?  Why should you or I, ever need a reminder to show appreciation or love to someone?  I put that one on my list, to remind me to slow down a little...to spend some time with family and friends.  I think, maybe, I just really missed listening to the local symphony play christmas music.  I have to admit, I do enjoy the music.  I really do not enjoy my family, anymore.  I keep a very tight circle of friends that have come to either ignore, understand, or just put up with my attitude towards holidays.  -that they are JUST days, like any other.  They just happen not to have mail service.  People choose to live differently on those few key days...they choose to acknowledge something that they normally do NOT on those key days.  Yet, if it really mattered, would the store-bought-card make a difference?  Live today for what really matters...call your mother, go to your worship service, thank a veteran, buy some flowers for your lover, and then go dress up in a scary costume to run around in the streets for candy.  Yeah, candy.        Now, you as the reader get to decide...how much of this was my negative, embittered attitude towards others...how much of this was a two year relationship with a jehova witness (-lower case for a reason.)...and how much of this was me just checking in on how I was doing with the resolutions' list.      I also put "more focused computer time" on my list.  I just started a Blog...does that seem very focused, to you?

      -After going to see a late night viewing of 'The Village', that is the only thing that I am taking away from the movie. This costume, though looking impressive, should be fairly simple to construct. I suspect even someone without any modern conveniences, would be able to make a fairly convincing 'bad color' costume. (eh-he.) I really enjoyed the characters that M. Night developed for this movie...too bad he used them in such a poor story. Fortunately, since I have a ten dollar a week comic book habit, I am used to writers putting good characters in bad stories. (Now, all of you assume I look like Louis Lane [the comic-book guy], on the Simpsons!) That's o.k. Until tonight, I assumed that all of M. Night's movies would be really upsetting, with imaginative twists. If I could get a couple of my friends to run around me, in yellow shawls and parkas...now, that would really be amusing. At least in comic books, good writers can make poor characters seem really imaginative. Superman has been great since Azz' began scripting a few months ago. 100 Bullets has never failed to impress me. GA has survived some of the worst writers -and artists of all time. Daredevil had been recycled for over twenty years, before Bendis took over. I enjoy Hellboy, Sam and Twitch, and even this 'Identity Crisis' in DC...but I still don't look like that fat guy on the Simpsons. -I look far worse. Think -Moe, that guy behind the bar. That guy, dressed in a 'bad color' costume...that is what I look like. Not only am I an ugly character...I am also a poorly written character in a really great story. "Worst character ever!"
