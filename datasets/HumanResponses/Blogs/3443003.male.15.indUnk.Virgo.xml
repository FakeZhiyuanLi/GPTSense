      Damn it feels good to be a yoga master.  I just finished doing like 30 minutes of yoga with my Dad and my Dadaji, and I must say, I feel mighty fine.   I'm about to download Opera for like the third time. Every time I try, I get disconnected. However, I have faith that I will eventually download the elusive 3.4 megabyte web browser. And then I will laugh at the God of the Internet, for I will have won.  Oh, and another thing. Yesterday I saw a real Hindu swastika. Last year when school ended, I signed this one Jewish kid's yearbook with what I thought to be a swastika, in bold print, on the front cover. I guess that wasn't a Hindu swastika. Oops.

      I can't believe I left my password the same as the one I told sagar for FB! Feel pretty stupid now so i'm gonna go sit in a corner. But Abe you guys should either wake up earlier or go to sleep later so we can talk on AIM (I guess not enough upload speed for Skype) cause I got a message last night at like 3. Thats like what 12:30 in the afternoon your time? Do it like 3 hours earlier and I would've been online. But anyway don't watch those Indian soaps! They're evvvvvilll. They get Friends and Seinfield there on Star World if I remember everything right. Anyway we've been having some what fun. I was going to go to Six Flags today first with Abhishek, but he couldn't go so I was going with some school people, but I ended up waking up at like 10:30 and by the time I got there it'd be 1 or something, so i canceled on them. Well tonight I'm gonna play some ultimate with my old tip roomate, Jack, and some other tip friends. Well ima go look at some cars... tehehe to get one after I get back from tip, or maybe if I'm lucky before I get back from tip :) Adios

      Well Abhinav, I am hoping that your flight went well and that you seem to have arrived safely and are on your journey to becoming a fob. I must say that iLove how you are keeping up with the Northview facts. I do INDEEDlyish miss you.   Over in Amreeca, we have been having a blast. Sagar is gone so Neil and I have been quote, hitting it off, end quote. Our weather is at a calm mid 80 and has been raining since you left for mother India (aka Bharat).   Thanks for asking about my iPod. Yes it is in fine shape and is keeping me up to date on the date and the time and the weather for that matter [iPut a couple of scratches on it.... :( ] Life goes on doesn't it?   One more thing... iWould like to let you know, Abhinav, that you are indeed the love of my life.    Love, The White Tee Pimp  Oh yeah... for adding some purpose to this post, Doom 3 beta 2 is out.

      I'm not so sure about Sagar's post being the first real constructive post to the blog :?. I thought I posted before. Maybe I should edit the content of that last post. Yes, your favorite power-hungry-blogger-dictator-kid is back. I can't believe you guys allowed me to take over your blog and make it an ugly pink. Wait, never mind, it was my blog in the first place, and I had it blue.    Neil, you have no idea how much blood, sweat and tears this post took. Do you have any idea how slowly spymac loads up on 56k to retrieve passwords? Yes, I'm on the friggin 56k. Sheetal you prick, you got me thinking Delhi has cybercafes. The first "Cyber CaPHe" that I went to was one small dingy room with a crappy computer connected at 115 kbps through this fat old man's cell phone and there was an old lady sleeping outside the door. Not exactly up to par, I'm afraid. However, I'll keep looking. I've heard rumors of 5 mbps connections somewhere.   Today I went with my dad and purchased a pair of chapals. The shoe store I went to was a two roomed shop, with maybe 2 fans in it. There were shoeboxes stacked up all around the walls, and they gave off a really strong smell. Four shopkeepers were sitting on these small stools on the floor. It's really sad what kind of lives these people lead. The shop must have been 80-90 degrees Fahrenheit, and the shopkeepers have to sit there all day, waiting for customers. They must make an equivolent of 4 U.S. dollars an hour.   Why the hell is India so HOT?? I am going to go to a Mandhir the day the monsoons start. And then, when the cow shit starts floating freely around the road, I am going to curse the monsoons for coming.   The only thing that keeps you even slightly cool is the A.C. and the desert coolers. Yes, the A.C. keeps people cool. Even here. In India. But running the A.C. is some sort of sin because of the energy it wastes. Why can't I be sinful mommy?  OK that's all for now. I'm going to go watch Jassi Jassi Kohi Nahin. LOL. I've stooped to watching Indian soap operas. My life just keeps getting more and more exciting. But seeing as it's two months ahead here, I might be able to ruin it for someone back in America.   There is a space between "grins evilly" and the   thingies because the   thingies are used in html, and if i did " " without the spaces, than that would be an html command, and you wouldn't see it. Very interesting, isn't it.  I'll see you guys soon. Not. Your Indian Mussolini/Hitler/Stalin/Mao Blogger

      (to the tune of eminem's without me) Sagar's back... tell some friends...  Did you honestly think that I would be gone forever. Of course I am back. Anyways, I'm in Philly right now and will be going to stupid princeton tomorrow, tons of fun, really. Anyways, Abhinav is gone, and Neil will be gone from wed., so i decided I would get us back in (its for the good of the blog, i swear...)  Want to see a real blog? Check out Salas's the guy whose in Philly's blog: blasphemy.blogspot.com  That is a real blog. I want this blog to be a hybrid of its current form and the informative and slightly satirical form of that one. Of course, this is technically abhinav's blog so who am i to comment on what it should be or what i want it to be but whatever. But honestly he does maybe 10 minutes of work on it everyday and it looks/ is really good.   On my blog binge today, I also invited myself onto priyanka, sheetal, shivani, and meghas blog. I love being in control. Anyways, this was a relatively constructive and meaningful post. If you still want to delete it/me go ahead, I honestly dont care but i got a kick out of it, and hell, it is the first actual "post" this blog has really seen. I have got to go now and wreak havoc elsewhere, but gday, gnite, and good trip to neil...   -Sagar.The.G 5/30/04

      Eh Abe I miss you already. As in I, I mean me, Sagar, Shek and the rest of us. We went and saw The Day After Tomorrow today (Friday the day you left) and the plot and acting SUCKED HORRIBLY, but the special effects were pretty cool. Wonder if you got through airport security or if they made you unload the crap ass warez music and stuff. Thats why you get an iPod. Well...its only me and shek this weekend since Sagar's going to Princeton, and then on Wednesday i'll be going to Toronto, so the next time I see Sagar, it'll be 2 weeks and the next time i see you will be like 2 months :( Hope you had a good plane ride and the stopover in Toronto was good and I'll eat some indian and chinese food in Toronto just for you. My whole tour of Toronto's gonna involve going to all those chinese restaurants and eating for you. Mmmm this makes me feel sad now, time to go do something else or sleep :(  Oh yeah, email me at neil314x@bellsouth.net or IM me if you want your new blogspot password, since I changed it so "they" don't take control

      I should make a long post about going to India, but I don't really feel like doing it.  It feels like I'll be gone for way longer than two months. When I come back, I'm going to be totally fobbed out. Look out for the cool desi haircut guys. I might even put some coconut oil on my hair to get that totally rad hair grease.   And who the fuck changed my blog? It looks PINK. Damn hackers.

      I guess the only reason people use Gmail is because of the immense hype over it right now. I mean, come on, who pays 100 bucks for like 3 months of email, considering GMail should be out of beta testing by then? I have been using spymac for about 3 weeks, and IMO it's the same as GMail. The only reason I want a GMail account is to be one of the first to use it -_-. Oh, Spymac offers 1 gig of storage space just like gmail and it also offers 250 megs of storage space for photos and 100 megs for your own ftp. That's hot stuff.

      Do you know that of the few high officials in India, most likely half of them are corrupt?  I must say, that I find it a commendable accomplishment of the Americans that they have been able to keep their government officials in check as they have. The problem with democracy is that the strength of the government does not lie in the intelligence of the leaders, rather their constituents. Not the patriotism of the constituents, the intelligence. And you guys probably say fine, that works well and that's how democracy is supposed to be and all that. However, we are not talking of America.   Another key problem in democracy is its' need for more sophisticated means of communication. For a republic to be able to TRULY elect a leader, or official, that they want to represent them, they need to be able to have access to what the goals that leader has and how he/she plans to accomplish them. Furthermore, they need to know what that leader that they voted for is doing while in power. Once again, this is not the problem in America. In India, that bastard Sonia Gandhi is getting votes from over 300 million people that live in rural towns. When asked to vote, they say, "I put my vote for Gandhi Ji, actually believing that Sonia Ghandi is a descendent of Mahatma Gandhi." See, the ignorance that these people have is the reason that corrupt officials such as Sonia Gandhi, and Laloo Prasad Yadav are in power.   People in small towns don't have access to either media that can tell them how the officials they lovingly elect are cheating them, their families, and their next 3 generations of their income, or schools that will give them the power to find out by themselves. I'm talking of elementary schooling.   Let me tell you how these officials spend their power.   Laloo Prasad Yadav, that son of a bitch official (I am not intending to use profanity, but am actually referring to the instances of his birth) has become the head administrator of India's railroads. I don't believe that man has more than a high school education. His wife's name is Jalebi. O.K. background complete.   This man has issued an order for all railroads to serve tea in clay pots called kulhars. The experience of drinking tea through kulhars actually is a pleasant one, and I imagine this is how he passed the mandate. However, guess how many clay pots must be made to serve every railroad passenger in India per day. Please take into account that most poor Indians still travel through railroad. Now take that number you have in your head and multiply it by 2 because I forgot the real number.   Now, kulhars, although made of clay, have no environmentally-friendly use after they are made. They are thrown away as soon as they are used, and, unfortunately, are chemically changed after being made - causing them to not deteriorate. Just think about diapers. Fifty years from now, we Indians will have garbage dumps with fully intact kulhars because of our favorite Aloo - Mr. Laloo. What are the major artifacts returned from archeological digs, my friends? Clay pottery. But I don't really care about what future archeologists will think about our tea drinking habits.  Kulhars are made from heating clay. So where does the heat come from? Sorry, not any widely available eco-friendly source, like the excess products created after sugar cane is processed. They cut down trees, and fruit-bearing ones, at that, like mango trees. Those bastards. A kulhar-producing plant does not have any trees in a ten mile radius because my beloved government officials have cut them down.   Great. I bet you all want to get on an Indian railroad and drink some tea from a kulhar. But let me tell you the part that makes me maddest. Laloo's constituents - of whom most are farmers, get the brunt of the damage from this kulhar idea. A lot of clay needs to be used, so in order to get the clay, the kulhar-factories have created this ingenious plan. What they do is to ask a poor farmer that makes about Rs.10,000 a year if they can rent his property for Rs.60,000 per month. During that one month, they take that farmer's land, and dig every bit of it 8 feet deep, extract the clay, and run away. Now this Rs.60,000 that the farmer gets is spent on a new car, or the wedding of the farmer's children. Not something that would drastically improve his life. Unfortunately, once the farmer's source of income is gone, he inevitably ends up selling his car, land, and going bankrupt. But the next time he is asked to vote, he spends three hours to walk to the nearest voting booth and votes for Laloo Prasad Yadav, a great man whom he and his friends hold in high regard.  These kulhar producing factories don't help the poor person very much, either. Most are owned by large corporations, and in the end, the rich only get richer, and the corrupt officials stay in power.  I don't see democracy as a useful government, when applied to the country of India. Until the citizens are more largely made up of a middle class, with poor people having access to better schooling and real sources, I would like to see a limited democracy be set up in India that is not limited to, but at least, grants the higher classes more political power, places a literacy test for voting eligibility, and sets up government-run farms in order to increase farming efficiency in India.   So, I'm a communist piece of shit. Actually, no, not really. Just think about it. A government that requires voters to be literate would obviously pay more attention to schooling of the poor people. And a government that allows the higher classes, or the people that have more knowledge, to have more say in the government, at least for a time, will help to remove the corrupt officials, and aim for a more capitalistic society. How would you do that with a government that directly controls farms? You figure that out.   The U.S.'s NRA, and AAA, after Depression years greatly helped the country, while controlling farming. And all I am asking for is a more direct approach. India is a land where, in some places, farmers can plant and yield 3 harvests in a year. 3 harvests. While the monsoons greatly help the farming, I believe farmers would be more efficient with government-sponsored farms backing them.  I believe India's greatest asset is its' people and environment. If government schooling were to more efficiently teach students, and the environment would be properly administered, Indian people would experience an increase in standard of living.  Now, I don't know what NRI's are saying about this Sonia Gandhi, but most probably, Western newspapers are hailing the Indian system of democracy for being so open-minded as to elect an Italian born, Catholic woman as one of the highest government officials. Wrong. I would have no problem with an Italian born, Catholic  homosexual  (oxymoron?) being Prime Minister if he/she were an intelligent and caring person. However, Sonia Gandhi is not a caring person. And let's not talk about her intelligence. When Mrs. Sonia Gandhi was asked to become Prime Minister, she declined on the pretense that "She didn't feel it was the right thing to do”, but really because she knew that she wouldn't be able to handle the job properly. Now, while the knowledgeable Indians are screaming in outrage at this bitch, the poor people praise her for being so humble. The humble Mrs. Sonia Gandhi is right now probably staying in one of her summer villas in Italy, Spain, or Switzerland so as to not ruin her complexion during the hot season in India. Who knows when she may come back in one of her two government-paid-for BMW’s to grace the half-starved people that have never even heard of Europe.

      It's my mom's 40th birthday today. I hope we go to a nice restaurant or something. Maybe Haldiram's, lol. I was talking to my Uncle yesterday. He said, "What is more important to you, the atmosphere, or the food." ONLY in India, both are equally important. Which seems absurd in the U.S., but it's because no place in America is in as bad a condition as much of India is. So, you can try to serve me the best food in India, but if more than a certain percentage of the clientele that I care for is picking their noses, and the room isn't air conditioned (in this heat - imagine), I refuse to go there. You know, in much of China, the appearance of the food often is more important than the food itself. Just different stuff from around the world.    I have yet to see the monsoons. Last night I heard thunder a good deal off, and saw a lot of clouds from the top balcony. Our house here is really tall, so you can see over all surrounding buildings in a mile or so. Alas, the clouds moved off in another direction. Ojála que los nubios irán a mi casa en este semana. I'm not even sure if that's correct Spanish. And I don't like saying "Allah Willing" that much either. The word Ojála is Spanish, dating to when Muslims, sorry, Moors, lived in Spain.   Blah blah blah blah blah blah. I just keep writing random facts. Too much learning for the past few days, I think I'll celebrate today. Quiero que comeriá muchos Rajkachoris para el cumpleanos de mi madre. I forgive myself for writing it Cumpleanos because it sounds funny - haha. Like El Niño. HAHAHAHA.  El Niño is the Spanish word for Child. Like all things Spanish, it is very dangerous.  DO YOU know that India does not widely use Solar or Eolian energy? A pure waste, in my opinion, of the wonderful environment God has given our country, what with the high winds during the monsoons, and the scorching heat of the summer. I predict that within a few years there should be widespread use of solar power in India. Quite ironic, considering the only reason people don't use A.C. over hurr is because of the high energy costs. So the heat can power the A.C.   BTW, I used the word hurr to prove to you all, I mean, y'all, that I'm not a fob. See, I'm just another Cool Cat like you guys. Now y'all just go on doin' yo' bisness, 'n' I' gonna check on mah wata. Yuck. But we Cool Cats have got to be keeping it real. You know what I'm talking bout.   Back to solar power. Buy stocks in any large company that announces to bring widespread, cheap, solar power, targeted toward the middle-upper class consumer. It has to be large, because Indians are very driven toward name-brands. All the computer tech guys I see here seem to be little robots that just keep squawking "P4 P4 P4 P4 P4" as if it were some ingrained chant. I say, "What about AMD?" and they start blabbing about P4 again. The Megahertz craze we saw in the U.S. a couple years ago is still running wild in India, I guess.  I think it's not possible for my mind to keep a straight entry. Every time I try to write about something I just keep blabbing until I'm off topic. Today's blog was supposed to be about my mom's birthday, goddamnit.  But one last thing. You know how India is still supposed to be advanced? Only in software, my friends, only in software. I found this out after a long time of looking around. The lines here, although laid nearly thirty years after most copper lines in the Americas, are not yet being used even half as efficiently. Well, I guess copper lines never really advanced technologically, but COME ON, I mean, 30 years after the U.S. and Indian infrastructure is as bad as it is? I cannot tolerate this. No DSL, no cable modems, although I found that IIT is running at tolerable speeds. Of course, I am talking only of Delhi. I have no clue about conditions in Puna and Bangalore.  In the other technologies, India appears to be severely lacking. Infrastructure sucks, and power outages still are a nuisance.

      Well Abe, that talk of Diablo 2 reminded me to check the ladder stuff and whatnot, and guess what? Ladder reset prolly within the next week or so. Blizzard posted on their main site www.battle.net that the D2X ladder will reset, so I'll try to make each of us a good blizzard sorc and start botting or something. Actually, I'll leave my bot on while I'm at tip for 3 weeks. Anyway, I'm still pretty bored here. Work sucks time out of me, cause I end up waking up at 9, then working from 10-5, and then there isn't really that much time left in the day. We listened to Roses like 4 times today in the car, it was good, but my new song thats stuck in my head is Overnight Celebrity by Twista. Well, i'm gonna go wear my retainer and go to sleep, since I've only gotten 4 hours of sleep in the last 50 hours, so I'm dieeeeeeeeeing

      Well.... I have great news. I have teamed up with a professional web designer to make a website with me. I have to decide the name of the domain though. I am still thinking. Abhishake.com would be too personal so i think i might have to sleep on it. 5 gig bandwith 15 gb of storage. the guy has paid hundreds for the server. Says i get to keep it for 5 years. After 5 years he "might" take it away. I got a $150 router today....   By the way, guess who is paying for all of this? gmail invitations... muhaha

      Dude.. My password to gmail got messed up. I think it was because I was on phone line while I was changing it. Post the secret answer required for the G Mail account as a draft on the blog. Maybe some guy found the e-mail address while googling because this blog is really getting big. AND YOU POSTED IT ON THE BLOG. You could have saved it as a draft.  Ty man.   And yes, I am becoming a fob. I have found out some wonderful new ways to say words. For example. Instead of "wearing clothes" or "change your clothes", we Indians say "change your dress" and "wear your dress". YES I am serious.

      It's the 23rd of June. Today is supposed to be the day that the monsoons start in India. For the past couple of weeks, the pre-monsoon rains have been cooling the environment about once a weeK. Once the monsoons start (they should begin sometime this week) it will be awesome. Do you guys know that smell that comes from the ground when the monsoons start? I've been waiting four years for it.  After my dad left a couple of days ago, we moved to my mom's house. It's more pleasant here because there aren't so many bugs outside (almost none) and also there are more people to talk to. Right now, it turns out, I am sitting outside on the porch. It's a monster, about the size of my living room. There is a pretty large park right in front of my house, with these three really pretty trees. The weather feels just like Thailand - dark, moody, cloudy, humid, and windy. MMM, like some beaches on rainy days, except I'm pretty far from the sea. I would take a picture but my dad took the digital camera. Maybe today I'll go play cricket in the park. It's only 11:32 A.M. right now. You know, India is a lot more calm than America. So much easier to introspect over here because there is way more time. It's like you step back and take a look at things from a different perspective. A couple of days ago, while we were on this long road trip, Shivani and I were talking about you guys. Shivani told me that Sagar and Abhishek have to work really hard to maintain our friendship. Do you guys, really? To me, that brings back memories of me playing Diablo 2 and listening to the iPod while you guys needed someone to play baseball or whatnot. Haha. Sorry for being such a bum ;p.  Would you believe it, I'm spending like maybe 1 hour on the computer per 3 days. EH? I've also been watching a lot of Indian movies. You guys should watch Dil Chahta Hai, Main Hoo Naa, and Kal Ho Na Ho. Just try it. At least watch Dil Chahta Hai. For me. You will like it, really. Well, all of it, except Preity Zinta. She looks like Megan. Just her face isn't as fat.    I got my hands on a Rs.3000 violin yesterday. Even though it was the worst instrument I have seen in my life, I managed to tune it after an hour and four broken bridges. Four broken bridges. After playing on it for fifteen minutes, the bridge popped again and then I threw the instrument at the wall. Just kidding. But I stopped playing it. I'm going to go on Friday to see if I can find a better one.   Sorry for such a jumbled post. My cousin is like the most annoying insect. Every time I start to write something, he tries to see what I'm typing. Almost more annoying than Shivani. I've been running around the entire house trying to type this thing on the laptop.   Yeah couldn't log on for a while. Umm. Monsoons haven't started yet.

      Well abhinav a lot has happened since you left. I don't sell anything or buy anything (from eBay at least) because both sagar and my PayPal Accounts have been banned. But right now every day of summer is exciting. Here is some stuff that has happened:  We bought our dad a silver mini iPod for his birthday and we just bought an APPLE POWERBOOK!! It's pretty tyte. lol. I'm on it right now. iLove it. First we bought him a compaq, but he didn;t like that too much and i didn;t either. My mom and sister were mad because i was "biassed" with apple in my mind. So we went to Alabama yesterday (my grandfather lives there) and on our way we stopped by the apple store, my mom and dad liked the powerbook so much they bought. We are about to go return the compaq though. iLove Mac OSX. it is amazing. I downloaded Microsoft office. (apple is hard as shit to crack). I've been on the laptop for a long time now and i have yet to eat breakfast. i miss you and send me mail on Gmail. lol. We should all get powerbooks. Neil brought PearPC to my attention yesterday and i realized that if you want  And Neil and i are serving every one. It's been fun. Don;t become a fob please. iLove you lol. have fun with GMail.  Later  -iLoveShake

      Abe thats not normal. Try to start undoing your fobbyness before you get back here. We had a sleepover like 2 days ago where me and shek served sagar and megha every 10 seconds. I think sagar got pretty annoyed, but we thought it was pretty funny. Nothing new going on here, wake up, go to work, come home and go for a run, and sleep. But I as possibly getting a car  urlLink Acura Integra  Don't any of the cybe caphes over there have like DSL or a better connection? Thats why I like living in Mumbai and Pune.

      I think I'll marry you. My cousin is named Abishek also. Sometimes he is a twit, that's why I haven't been able to post for so long. Because I don't find the chance to type something without him watching  exactly  what I type. Oh well. I'm sure I'll get some time soon. Even now he is watching me type. o-0. But thanks for the G-Mail and the windows xp keys, and I'll give you the gmail invites. You stopped buying and selling iPods?  India is same old same old. You would think there would be more to blog when you are in a foreign country, but there isn't, because I can't find the time or the patience with this connection. Going to IIT sometime soon to find a decent speed. No, I'm not even joking.   Edit: Oh my fucking god. I just read what I wrote to check for errors, and I find that I have started to become a fob. Who the hell says (pronounced sAYs, mind you) "even now"? Or is that normal, and I just think it's not because I've lost my American-ness?

I saw like 20 whales on this boat trip thing we went on 3 days ago. then yesterday i saw about 150 porsche's of all different kinds while we were leaving quebec city. i guess it was a porsche exhibition of some kind and people were showing off their own porsche's. some guy had his painted purple and teal, it didn't look like a porsche. well i sat in the car driving from quebec city to toronto yesterday and i watched a lot of friend's episodes :) i'll go eaet breakfast now, porque no comí comida

      I watched Hari Putter today with my cousins. The theater was like an Imax - meaning there was only one screen. No wonder they are always booked for the first few days of movies, there's only one theater per like 10000 people. But it was really nice. Damn there is so much to post and I don't feel like doing any of it.   A couple of nights ago there was a blackout. Blackouts are O.K. when they are at night and you are sleeping so there is no discomfort to experience, but it just so happens that I was playing Monopoly at 3 o'clock with my Chacha and cousin. It turns out I lost at Monopoly. That's just wierd. I mean weird. I think it was a bad day for mankind because on that day the power went out and it also rained, causing all the desert coolers to lose like 60% of their efficiency. That must be why I lost at Monopoly. And where the heck does one get the name Monopoly? Mono is one, and poly means many. So what the fudge does Monopoly mean? One Many? Eh? ANYWAYS (yes, people that write anyways in all caps are generally girls), the lights went out while I was playing Monopoly and we had to run the lights on backup power to finish the game. But after the game ended (and I lost) I had to go upstairs to my room. And the fan and A.C. didn't run because the batteries were almost out of power from our two hours of extra light needed during monopoly. So I went to my room (normally at night it's the coolest room in the house because air can't come in from outside) and it was hot as hell. Almost 85 degrees Fahrenheit. That's nearly as hot as hell. And being the lazy bastard I am, I didn't want to open up the windows. So I stripped to my boxers and decided to try and sleep. EEEeeyaaa. Turns out, it suddenly got very cold at night. Or I could have been delusional from the heat. Who knows. But I wanted to put my shorts on for some reason. I had left both my shorts and my T-shirt on my bed when I took them off. So in the dark, I groped around for my shorts, and picked up my T-shirt instead. Now, my shorts are those elastic ones that you don't have to buckle up or anything. Yes, I am a lazy bastard. I picked up my T-shirt thinking it was my shorts, and tried putting it on. SOMEHOW I managed to put my T-shirt on as shorts, with the neck part going around my waste. I kept thinking, "Have I grown fatter or something cause these shorts don't fit me as well as they did two hours ago." Yes, probably delusional from heat. In the morning, I woke up sweating all over, with my T-shirt on my legs. It would be funny, but there was a lot of blood, sweat and tears involved. Without the blood. Haha. Oh, and I can't wear the T-shirt anymore. Wah. (I think I did too many of these things - )()( - I don't remember what they are called right now - sorry)  Another episode of my sad, pathetic, and very interesting life in India.

      I watched that while it happened. I was confused because he fainted and no one went over to help him or anything. I didn't know if it was him really fainting or not. His elder brother had won the spelling bee contest two years earlier but never in the history of the spelling bee had a sibling of a winner won the champioship again. This young INDIAN (show that pride biatch) is trying to make history. But I do indeed ask one question: Why is the spelling bee displayed on ESPN?   Love, The Shake

      Turns out spelling is a very demanding thing.... mentally and physically:   In a new definition of a fainting spell, the runner-up in the National Spelling Bee apparently fainted when asked to spell 'alopecoid' in the contest eventually won by a 14-year-old Indiana boy.  Akshay Buddiga hit the floor after fainting, but won a standing ovation from the crowd.	  Akshay Buddiga, 13, from Colorado, recovered enough to spell the word correctly and continue into the championship round.   Check it  urlLink  here

      Not saying their blog is ugly or anything, but when I saw it, I wanted to fall off my chair and die. I actually like the way our blog looks right now but we need to change it in a while.

      Ahh.. The reason for living in India. Seekh Kababs. And the mosquitos. They both taste yummy in my tummy. I just ate some Seekh Kababs in Roti with Pyaz. They tasted just like the Chicken Tikka Rolls from Curry in A Hurry. (All food is capped for a reason - it's holy) There's a thirty percent chance that most of you haven't shared this experience, you damn vegetarians. And there's a thirty percent chance that it's raining. I can tell because I have the fifth sense. And my left breast. I don't think guys are supposed to have breasts.  After eating my Seekh Kababs, I went out with my cousins and Chacha to go eat some ice cream. You know, from one of those Mother Dairy ice cream stands on the side of the street. Very pleasant. As I was walking back, I looked up. There was this beautiful red-pink hue in the sky. God I love Delhi smog.   You know those Sim City games where the citizens never shut up about the smog?

      First, I would like to say that I do indeed want a copy of the A.B.E. Har Har. Second you ruined my entire life Abhinav. You told me the whole story of the fifth book. I never even read it. (grrrr). I know the reason that Neil is posting on the other blog. This is blog is "messed up" in Canadia.   I believe the reason that people are posting on the blog with misspellings in the Title (aka kookies and milk) is because they have a lack of correct grammar usage. Have you read their posts? None of them deal with anything that would be beneficial to society. I would say that we should combine the blogs into one you know superblog but I don't want to read all of their petty little comments.     urlLink Good Pie urlLink

      Hi there. No one posts on this blog. What the shitty?  Why does everyone go to the kookiesandmilk blog? "Kookies" aren't even spelled that way. Which makes it a bad blog, as the title has a mistake, according to the American Blogger Edict of 1999 (A.B.E. HAR HAR HAR). You have no idea how long that last sentence took to make grammatically correct. /grumble grumble/ /Grammer Nazi/  :C  And I will watch Harry Potter (a.k.a Hari Puther) before you guys. Again. Sagar you better not read this blog till you finish watching Harry Potter. LOL. Or your hair will become big. Because it will be full of secrets. Go watch Mean Girls again.   Last thing. I need a key for Opera 7.5. Post on the blog. I hope someone still reads it. Damn cookies. It's pie, bitches, pie.

      I’ve got Lance Armstrong’s biography also. I just didn’t bring it with me to India. Tell me how good it was when you finish.   India is getting better. I don’t feel the heat so badly. And the mosquitoes now officially consider me “Indian Blood”. I know this because last night I only got bitten 2 or 3 times as opposed to the 15 times you get bitten the first few days. Is it that American Blood is tastier, and then living in India spoils it?   I have like 40 pages to type up for summer reading. That’s why I’m soo looking forward to my week before school when I get back. To take some of the load off, I decided I would write some of the summer homework. By write it, I mean manually write it, as in with the hands, and not using the computer. I’m telling you, it brings me happy dreams at night. The notebooks here are very good quality. They are like 40 Rupees but have all this fancy shit on them. I said “Dad! It’s only one buck!” and then he got mad at me for converting, saying it’s more expensive for people living here.   And look out. Our blog has been out for two months. Actually not even two months, more like two weeks. But it seems like two months because the archive says we have two months. Yatta.  Edit: These bastard mosquitoes over here are much harder to kill. I waved the electric flyswatter just now and killed one in the air. I JUST KILLED MY FIRST INDIAN MOSQUITO. TRIBAL WARCRY. LALALALALALALA.   2nd Edit: I tried to work this afternoon. I sat down with great determination to start writing the first page in my dialectical journal. I barely got finished with one page. Curse you Indian weather.

      Yo Well tomorrow morning I gotta get up at 4:30 cause my flight to Toronto is at 8, so I gotta be there by 5:30ish to check in and all. I'll be utterly bored after I get through security in like 2 minutes :( dammit, but atleast I have my nPod and Lance Armstrong's autobiography to keep me busy. He is a remarkable man... Well today I worked from like 9 till 4 and then I had to go to Sams to check on their V300's...but they're still out and they prolly won't get any more in for the next 2-3 weeks, but I was able to order a new set of contacts (hazel). Well after that I had to go to sheetal's for dinner with my sister and my mom and we all talked and ate, and then I went to Jay Patel's house and we played some basketball and he showed me these kickass cs videos he made on his own and they were so 1337. His dad locked away all the gaming stuff during the school year, so to find the second video his dad sent us out of the room while he unlocked all the stuff and everything. Well his mom and sister were watching some indian soap opera so I thought about abhinav and shivani and I was laughing. His sister's like 24, but when I first walked in I swear she could've passed for 15, it was crazy. But his parents were nice people and me and Jay chilled for a while and he hates a lot of brown people, just like me ;) but he doesn't hate cool brown peopel like you guys. Well I just finished packing my bag and I think i'm gonna go look for some food to eat since we don't got any lucky charms left at home. And amit said Mrs. Universe was on tv, so thats always fun to watch. Well peace for the next week, cause I doubt i'll be able to find a decent connection for the laptop up there, besides on next Monday when i'm staying at a friend's house in Toronto. Mmmmmmmmmm peace out

      I looked at the state of the elections at the moment, and I am pleased. The polls say that the Democrats are winning by only a few percentage points over the Republicans. However, I would give Kerry a 10% lead.  The majority of people who vote for the first time in an election vote as a protest vote. This taken into consideration, I think many people are dissapointed with the Bush administration, and will vote in November for Kerry as a protest vote.

      Well, I guess you guys all know what this post means. Yes, I am back in the Land of the Immaculate Stuff. I don't truly feel at home, with all this white stuff surrounding me. I think I looked at my bathroom wall for a full minute, trying to find some dirt  somewhere , and alas, I failed.  Feeling melancholy.  I don't really want to be either here or in India. Maybe I should just migrate every two weeks.  What I will miss: the mood, the style, the freedom, the butterscotch ice cream cones, the walks to Auro Bindo and Green Park, Rajinder Da Dhaba, the temperamental weather, and the relatives.  There's something Neil Armstrong said about how good it is to be home no matter where you are coming from. Yes, it does apply.

        "To live is to be marked. To live is to change, to die one hundred deaths."   &nbsp;  In my opinion it's closer to one thousand deaths. For me, change is simply a part of life. I wouldn't have it any other way. I think the best way to change who you are is to simply get away for a while. Undoubtedly, this trip to India has changed who I am, as have every one of the other trips I have taken. With traveling, you step out and shatter the protective bubble of your views on life. You take the dusty glasses off your face and chuck them away. Being completely separated from your own lifestyle allows you to think and reexamine yourself. And change.  &nbsp;  At home, I get caught up with all the action that is going on, and the bubble regrows. Well, at least my paradigm of the world is routinely updated due to the experiences and the knowledge I am able to obtain.  &nbsp;  I want that as this new millennium unfolds, people are given a better chance to learn and experience. To be more  aware . Looking back at history, I think don’t that I will be disappointed.

       For the past couple of days we thought my Dadaji had a blocked artery because he had an Angina attack and the cardiologist we took him to said he probably had a blockage.&nbsp; Well, it turns out that the doctor we took him to owned a private practice, and although he was a good doctor, was in requirement of some money. So he tried to scare us into keeping my Dada there for longer than required. We just got a call from the best heart hospital in Delhi - where my Dadaji was checked up - and they say that everything is fine.     &nbsp;  Try and make a post. The new post box is really cool. With keyboard shortcuts like Gmail. I like those keyboard shortcuts on websites.  &nbsp;  That - is the news.

      I was in Noida for the past 3 or so days. It's a very interesting place. The development in Noida rivals that of Gurgaon, in fact. Although the old Delhi isn't reviving itself or changing its styles of buildings, its outskirts are growing quickly and are very modern. When I came to India, Delhi looked the same as in my last visit - filled with large, open, inefficient houses that are affected by the weather, and slums where the poor live in horrible conditions that make me feel depressed. Many people have renovated their houses to make them more sealed in Delhi, the city is cleaner, and there are less poor people, but the style and atmosphere remain the same. I felt that Delhi hadn't changed, no, advanced, as much as American newspapers led me to believe. Thankfully, I was wrong. The development is occurring, although not in Delhi, but away from it, such as areas like Noida and Gurgaon.   The subway is being built right now, and I believe that when it is completed it will be on the same class as many large European cities. The metro will connect all of Delhi, so you could go to a mall in Gurgaon and Noida in the same day, comfortably.  There is a mall being built in Noida that will be the largest in Asia. Yaya.   I got pink sunglasses the other day.  I beat Mama in Carom Dad.

      Have you guys watched Dil Chahta Hai yet? It's got these really nice tunes. I think I'll play the title song on the violin. Bum-bum-bum-bum. Ba Pa Ba Paaa Ba Pa. Bum-bum-bum-bum. D-E-G-A, C-B-B-D-C-B. D-E-G-A.   A-B-E. It's the only name I can think of that you could play on a violin.

      Have you guys ever noticed that the Hindi language is far superior to any other? Whenever you read a word in Hindi, if you read it correctly, can be pronounced in only one way. There just isn't any other way to pronounce it, because the words aren't messed up as in the English language. I don't think any of the common languages has this advantage. English, Spanish, and French all have their K-nights, and K-nifes, c-oughs, tr-oughs, and d-oughs, in some way or the other. But in Hindi, the alphabet is used in the most simple form, without any weird rules. Even if you take out letters from a word, it's pronounced as it should be. The syllables don't change stress, ever. If you take out Doc from Doc-uments, are you completely sure how to pronounce "uments"?  No. Which means that you have to learn how to pronounce most English words. You can guess, but you can't be sure.   I think every syllable in Hindi words is given exactly the same amount of weight. What other major language does this? All I can think of is Bantu. Baaaanttttuuu. But they don't have an alphabet so we win.  I don't know if Eastern languages are similar. But Eastern languages are out of the question, what with their messed up symbols.  What a scientific language that Hindi is. A language should be made to be easy, not difficult. I remember in America, all those Chinese people used to brag to me about how hard their language was to learn. Where do the bragging rights come from, anyways? Are the Chinese people smarter for having made their language so difficult to learn?  I beat Abhishek in Carom Board dad.

      I wasn't able to post for the past couple of days because I was at my Dada Ji's house and because I was sick. I don't know what I had, it seemed like a cold/cough put together.  Every five or ten minutes, I would have to run top speed from the couch to the bathroom to blow my nose, because there is no such thing as Kleenex in India. What we have is a hot, humid, environment (as you all know) that causes anything resembling the American tissue paper to stick to your face. So, either you go get yourself a handkerchief - what a wierd spelling, eh? - or you blow your nose into the sink. I choose the toilet. Do you know that King Louis XIV actually employed people to pull weevils out of his ass? Boll Weevil.   Now. Why was I sitting on the couch? Because I have been watching cricket almost religiously for the past few days. That's just scary. I think I've watched more sporting events in the past two weeks than I must have in the past two years. Ten-dul-kar. Geeeeel-crest. I've also managed to learn the name of most Indian cars on the streets. Wowza. I think you all know just how passionate I am about cars and sports. Maybe there is just something about the Indian atmosphere that changes my interests. Hahahaha. Or maybe that was a little too idealistic, and the real reason is there is WAY TOO MUCH TIME.   I just broke a flourescent light. Or is it light tube? I took a break to go upstairs and grab my book, and when I opened the door, the damn thing fell down. And all this green gas started floating around, and settling on me. Yes, I was very scurred. But, thankfully, there is nothing harmful in the flourescent tubes. I need to refresh my memory sometime on how they work. The gas' electrons are raised to a higher state and when they fall back to normal states they emit light. And the electricity is what excites them. So why are flourescent tubes easy to keep running, and take a larger amount of energy to start up?  The other day I found out that the Indian government is in charge of power supply. No wonder the electricity is always out. Those fat old men can't do anything right. Unfortunately, the majority of India believes that the government should be the major provider of electricity. I would too, if I was one of the many poor people that tap the lines in order to get free electricity. Frickin leeches. And the people that rightfully pay have frequent power outages. That makes me mad.  Earlier this week, we had didn't have power for most of the night for three days.I also happened to have been sick during that time. The thing with this virus is that the person starts out being very hot, and within a few hours is very cold. Believe it or not, it's happened to 3 people already, not including me. And now it's happening to my mom and sister, while I laugh in their faces. So, at nights, I was very cold, regardless of the fact that I would have a winter blanket and a sheet on me, while my mom and sister would be sweating, with no blankets on, and right in front of the A.C. and fan. So when I used to ask them to turn off the A.C. they would just say "Shut up Abhinav" or something like that. And then the power would go out, and I would give them a little laugh from under the blankets, and then cough for a while.   Quite ironic, but the only time I have ever been truly cold in India during this visit was while I was completely miserable.  However, later, when I got better to the point where I could feel differences in temperature normally, but was still miserable, the power kept going out. So it was worse than when I was sick enough to be cold in 30 degrees Celcius.  When Crying, Stung by Bee in the Face.  The Jap equivalent of Jaa Bhooka Jaiyain, Wah Sookah Aiyain.   But right now, I am not crying, being stung by any bees, facing starvation, or under a drought. It's quite pleasant. The monsoons have arrived. On the 16th India is playing in this cricket game. Cool beans.

      I liked reading the posts today. They were very interesting. You should've talken Controversial Politics at TIP like I did last year. We discussed things like this in the class, but more focus was spent on China, Russia, and Cuba, especially the Communist revolutions in those countries. The instructor (Sergiey) a Ukranian was really cool, and most of the class agreed that if the right person was put in charge, dictatorship could be an excellent form of government, but of course, after any person gets that much power, they aren't a good person anymore, so a benevolent dictator is oxymoronic. Anyway, I built a new computer for my uncle, and for Shubh (well I told him a part by part list for him to buy, and I went over to his house, fixed all the wiring they had done wrong, installed the processor, and fixed the CMos since they were trying to run it in clear without a processor :). For my uncle and Shubh I got a AMD 2500+ Barton (yup AMD tell those Indians that AMD is 1337 :) and I overclocked my uncle's from 1.83 ghz to 2.35 ghz still running at 38 degrees celcius, and chasis temperature is 24 degrees celcius. I bought an Abit NF7-S motherboard, 1 gb PC3200 (DDR400) Corsair Ram, ATI Radeon 9800 Pro, 200 gig WD Hdd (no sata or raid), NEC 2510 DVD-RW +/- (8x dual layer), 52x Quiet CD Drive, and a kiiiiiick ass case with 4 led fans (2 intake and 2 exhaust), a nice led custom heatsink, and some UV lights with round IDE cables that glow with the UV light. (Well the case stuff for my uncle, shubh bought his own case). Sunday's the peachtree road race that we're going to run, it should be fun. And then I have to go to work tomorrow again, but it'll be good cause I'm going to Olive Garden for lunch to eat their yummy salad and breadsticks, and of course my all time favorite Chicken Alfredo :)

      Guess what? This will be the first post that I write during a genuine Indian blackout. Right now it's 8:30 p.m., and there is no light, causing the entire neighborhood to be dark. Of course, those lucky families with inverters on our street (us not included) have still got their lights on. OK.. the lights are back. I was expecting a long blackout during which I would have enough time to write something which would bore that prick Irish Beer. I doubt you are even old enough to drink, weirdo. Oh well, back to the books. I got up because it's completely dark outside and I wouldn't be able to read with no light. Staring at a laptop in pitch black, of course, is very healthy for your eyes.  Oh well, I guess I'll just complete this post now. What to do. The sky here is much cleaner than in America. Even though we are right smack in the middle of Delhi, the sky is darker than it is at my house because of that stupid soccer field. I can't see any stars at the moment, but the sky is almost completely dark, meaning there might be clouds. It's not an ugly purple like in Suwanee. I still haven't found the time to look at the sky.  I was reading about Norman Thomas a couple of hours ago. What an interesting guy. How come no one else is posting?

      Back in California, I used to go to Fry's a lot. I can't wait till Fry's reaches Gwinnett Place Mall.  For those of us that aren't so computer literate, here's what Fry's brings - 120 GB Hard Drives for -4 dollars. Because Fry's doesn't do rebates so much, the prices they sell computer equipment at is very cheap. You price match Fry's to any computer store (as soon as Fry's get here), and you get awesome deals.  Right now, Circuit City has the WD 120GB HD for 120$ minus 80$ in rebates. Fry's sells it for 80 bucks. Price match, take 110% difference, and you have a starting price of 120-44, or 76 bucks, minus the 80 dollars in rebates, and the hard drive is free. Free. I love it.

      Too many Freshman scum - half of our school is now Freshman. I'm not being swept up with the upper classmen ego either, there are just too many Freshmen. Last year I could actually breathe in the halls, see people, swing my arms - like a monkey. I guess this year, what with Alpharetta High School opening up, we aren't the "new school" anymore. I don't want to know how many people we will have in school if all our classes are the size of the new Freshman class. Lunch is worse. The food may have gotten better, but the lines are like 200 people long. A 20 minute wait for lunch, and the time left is what we had last year - 40 minutes.   At least next year I'll get a parking space seeing as I'll be a senior? That's funky. I don't want to be a senior..  Oh well. This year will be fun if the work doesn't kill me. I got great classes and great teachers.

      My parents finally came home from back-to-school shopping. They scared me when they walked into the room with two big bags labeled Abercrombie & Itch. But it's O.K. now, they were for my sister.  I just had "The Last Supper" as Goodwin would put it. Far too early by Indian standards (What? It's not even 9 p.m. yet??) but a bit late by American standards. I think? I don't know.   What I had: Gordita, 3/4 of that new Quizno's Sub - there must be a Quizno's near a Taco Bell somewhere, and no mangoes. Those are in the title to make it rhyme. Sorry.  Good Food for the Indian Dude.

      Ahh. So. I haven't finished the summer homework still. I have about 8 hours in which I can work on the remaining homework, after that I get really sleepy because my brain thinks I'm still jetlagged.  I predict that I can finish that APUS work today, and then I'll see about the rest, I guess.

      Yesterday Nikhil and Chris came over to work on the Chem homework with me. We got into a discussion as to what we would do if we were given a billion dollars suddenly. Both Nikhil and Chris agreed that if they were given a billion dollars they would drop school. I couldn't understand why someone would want to stop learning before completing college, and I still can't. Nikhil and Chris laughed and told me I'll agree with their views before I finish A.P. Lang this year. Yeah, I'll probably want to drop my English class, but the English class is for me to get into college. All my other classes I'm only taking because I enjoy them..    Was it just that I was stuck in a room with two lazy people? Or were they right, and I'm different, and all the kids these days would drop school if they didn't have to take it?  To me this is a very serious problem. Learning should be one of the most enjoyable things in life. For the limits of your intelligence are the limits of your world. And these American kids take every thing for granted. Like the information that is given to us through good schools just because we live in America. Since when was schooling such a burden as we make it? It's certainly not a burden to the thousands of people in other countries that forego their food for a day so they can rent out a book at the local library to learn some Math or Science. (In other countries you pay for good libraries - they aren't public)  Which just shows you why colleges love students from other countries. They are brought up on different principles, appreciating education far more than people here. Even some  second  generation  Asians here are spoiled brats. Not Nikhil or Chris - of course. Nikhil studies like ten times as much as me. And Chris is ----- Chris is Chris.  The short term enjoyment gained through American toys like the computer and the console games apparently are more  filling than the wholesome feeling you get from knowing why something happens the way it does. It's clich&eacute;, but Americans are truly too materialistic.

      I really like free web hosting.  The past few days I've been hosting my website on lots of great free web hosters. Geocities and Tripod are cool.  I love geocities. It makes websites real fun to make. Free web hosting with ftp is even better than an online manager. Then you can just upload via ftp to your website. HTML is fun to learn. Free web hosting.

      I finally sorted out a new server, after an entire hour of searching. I'm sure there are many free servers better than the one I have, but IT'S A BLOG. All anyone could care about is that little image that comes on the top that says "Got Pie". And if it loads a second later than the rest of the page and you have some problems with that, please go pee in your pants.   That said, I think there are some really nice new servers which everyone can use to make blogs and then not have ads.  Legally.   Maybe I'll put google ads on the site now to make some money. Money Money Money. As you all now, I'm paying through my nose for this server hosting and it would be really nice for you people to help me out. I'll put the ads in some inconspicuous place - like the bottom of the page. And you can have fun clicking them every day.  Seriously, there is some money in google ads. And not just 30 cents per click. Some clicks make large amounts of money - like 15 bucks per click. And we all know how much funner and informative someone's website becomes once you have those interesting ads. I would only put ads on to make my users enjoy my site more.

      I just went to the student orientation.  PHEW.  I thought I would be screwed with all the A.P. Language Arts homework. Thank GOD I've got Mrs. Upton. Do you know what a relief this is? It's like 3 big boulders off my shoulders. Yup Yup. Getting geared up for language with some rhyming. Mrs. Upton said that the work isn't due on the day we get back, as she wouldn't assign that kind of work anyways, and she doesn't really want to grade 200 plus essays to start school off. Aaaahhh. ::relief fart:: Good teachers really help.  To celebrate, I went to Taco Bell with my mom. I finally got my hands on a Chalupa, Gordita, and that Chicken Enchalada.  Well then, I think I'll type those twenty pages of US History within the next two days and also start that Language Arts homework.

      Sigh. Back to America and the Canadia cracks are back.  I revisited Canada. Of all the countries in the world, Canada is the most similar to America. So why do Americans over here make fun of Canada? Wouldn't you just be making fun of yourself? Similarly, people over here are always cracking jokes about the French. I don't really like the French, they have an extremely prissy manner. Still, I never make fun of them.. When I ask someone why they make fun of the French, they almost always say that the French are cowards.   .. EH?  Anyone ever heard of the Napoleonic Era? Guess Not.   Then there is that Google joke about French military defeats. Ha Ha Ha.  After I remind the person about Napoleon, the person almost inevitably states that the French are against the occupation in Iraq.   Aren't you?   And let me remind you all that the French are America's oldest ally. So where the hell does this anti-French attitude come from? Why did it start after 9/11? Why does the general derogative attitude towards the French rival in strength with the hate we have for Osama bin Laden?  This stupid Southern humor strikes me as crazy.  I bought some stuff today. A Ti-84+ Silver Edition and 2 120 GB Hard Drives for the new computer I'll start building soon. What motherboard should I get? I want an AMD chip (maybe 2), so an nForce?
