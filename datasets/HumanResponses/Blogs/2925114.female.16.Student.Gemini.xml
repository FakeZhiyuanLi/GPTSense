      today was great. i had an awesome day. i just woke up and felt like it was going to be a great day, and it was. untill 5th. my history teacher put the marks up on the wall. i looked up my number (yes we're numbered) and i saw 39% i must have checked it at lest 4 times. it was horrible, i've never failed anything in my life. it was crazy. so in my stubborn ways, i've decided not to talk to my teacher for a while. I dont know why i'm just mad. i dont deserve this mark. my boyfriend had to go to Co-op so i didnt have anyone to vent to either. oh well it'll pass. I'm reading a really interesting book, it's called The Perks of Being a Wallflower. by stephen....something i dont know, im too lazy to go to my bag and get it. lol i'm watching Fresh Prince of Bell-Air and will just burnt down his house. great show. anyways I best be off.

      Today was my brave day. I got my  bellybutton pierced ! yah! It rocked. Chris almost didn't come so that kinda sucked, but then he did so it was less sucky. I loved it so much more becuase he was there. It was so much better! He held my hand the whole time, I admit it, i was scared. It was way more comforting. My mom was there too and it didnt hurt as much as my nose... but it still hurt. Nothing I cant handle. Yup so I have to keep reminding myself i have it done because it is way too cool for me to even start to understand. It rocks, i cant get over it. Yup so I thought I'd write my thoughts about it because I've got so muh energy now after having it done!  YAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

      Hello, well today I woke up, packed aand then I was off to London for Easter. I wish I could tell you it was London England I was going to. psssh yaah right! nope just London Ont. for me. Anyways I have family down here. Aunt, Uncle, two baby cousins, my entertainment for the next three days.:D absolutley adorble. My aunt did this fortune telling thing. It was with tea leaves.. I'll explain.  1) You pours you some tea, with tea leaves in it. 2) You drink the tea (Imagine that!) 3) When your done the leaves are left in the bottom. 4) You flip the cup over onto the saucer. 5) You turn the cup counter-clockwise 3 times.  6) For the first turn you make, you think of a wish. 7) For the second turn you think of something you hope for. 8) For the third, you think of a dream you have. 9) When you're done all that mumbo-jumbo you flip the cup over and whatever is left in the cup is supposed to form a picture that predicts your future or says something about your life. But you have to tip the cup and let the remaining liquid drop from it, and the more tea that drops out, the more you'll cry over something in the near future.  So from my "reading" we concluded that I was going to have a huge cry in the near future. However, it would pass very quickly. Umm I'm going to receive a piece of mail (whether it be email or a letter) that's related to love. There was a picture of a cabin. (I have a little shack on my property for partying). There were three characters in a circle. My aunt said that these three were my friends aand I. SO I guess it's Me, Meliss, and Adrienne. Which is freaky because she doesn't know anything aboutmy life aat home let alone my circle of friends. And apparently a circle of anything means my wish will come true... YES!!! Umm there was a rabbit which meant that I had a n ememy I should look out for. My aunt said she had a feeling that the enemy was about something in my acting. Hmm I could name a few....there was some other stuff but I'd rather not make that too public for now.. Well that's my fortune not that you care, but hey just telling you.  I went to see Dawn of the Dead recently with my boyfriend. Best movie ever. And by best I mean worst I ever seen! They had to resort to severaal sex scenes to wake up the audience, and apparently there was a Bruce Cambell impersonation... I say apparently because I've never seen the guy before, I think they saaid he was from the Evil Dead movies or something.  Well Happy Easter to all and to all a good night!!  Ness*

      I don't really know why the world hates me...you should ask it. I guess it's really because I've just had alot of back luck lately. So I'm kind of convinced that it does. For instance, everyone knows about my Ottawa incedent. Everything was so planned and I couldn't wait for it, but then that happened.  Apparantley when Chris went he arrived to the guys' house to leave for Ottawa and another band member had his girlfriend there. When a friend of the band's said hey, where's Vanessa? (who was apparantley upset that I wasn;t there, even though I don't remember meeting this guy, oh well)Chris said Graham told me she couldn't come, Graham then said, don't look at me, Nick told me not to, Nick just said well I thought that girlfriends wouldn't be aloud to come with us, I didn't know Roury was bringing his. So yah... that was good to hear about..not. Anyways before I knew this, and after Chris told me I couldn't go I said damnit! I was planning on this for a while I haven't seen you fo a week! SO he said, okay I promise we'll do something on Sunday. Me, feeling discouraged said psssh yah right. But he kept promising. He said they were leaving bright and early on Sunday and we could spend the day together.  So again, I got a day of waiting, he didn't call untill 6.30pm because the guys had slept in the they took forever to get going apparantley, so he said I'm coming over right now, I promised you I'd see you today, let me call my Mom and tell her where I'm going (He was at Nick's house). He called back 2 minutes later, and the first thing he said was, don't hate me. His Mom had yelled at himbecause he was late and she wouldn't let him go anywhere because they were having dinner guests over and he needed to be there. So he said I'm so sorry, I promise, if I get off work early enough, I'll come over tomorrow...i was pissed, from again waiting all day for bad news... So the next day he called and said that it was an easy job that day and he'd be at my house early. I was in my room listening to music, and I heard a knock on my door. Suprisingly enough it was him! I was so happy! Then he pulled out a dozen roses form behind his back. Lucky for him they are my favourite...muahah. So my bad luckiness has come to an end.  I know you all probably don't give a shit about that, or you've got bigger problems&nbsp;but I had to write it down...  Maybe the world doesn't hate me after all?

      So I could be in London right now, having a blast. But nope, I'm at home...alone with nothing to do. See I was waiting for Graham to call me to tell me if I was gonna go with them to Ottawa.   My Mom waited for a while and then said sorry Ness we gotta go to London, sure you don't want to come along? And stupid me said nope, he's going to call me soon, and I'll probably be able to go. So I waited from 9am ( I got up early so I didn't miss his call) until 6pm. Yah thats right I kept everyone off the line that long! Do you know how crazy that is for my family?! So then I thought, well Chris should be home by now, and he said he'd call after work. So I just said screw it, and called him. He said that he talked to Graham, and I couldn't go, but Graham said that he tried to call but couldn't get through. Even though I'd been off the line all day. And I'd *69 every hour to see the last number that called my house, and everytime it was my grandma's number when she'd called in the morning to say bye to my Mom.   That I was okay with, whatever doesn't matter, I guess I missed going to London. But I was pissed...not that Graham didn't call me, I don't know who I was mad at...just generally mad. I could never be mad at Graham...he's awesome. Not only did I miss London, but I was just frustrated with the fact that I sat around all day, not going out or doing anything afraid that I'd miss his call.  Now I've had sometime to think about it and I guess that would've been hard for Graham to call me and tell me I couldn't go with them. I'd have a hard time with that...it's kind of mean. But now I know that it's better to be mean...  I don't even know why I'm mad...this is not only stupid...it's pointless..and a waste of time.

      It's a rather simple game, but if you choose to play, you must continue to play it for ALL ETERNITY no worries, it's nothing horrible.  this is the game.  as soon as you think of the game (I lost), you say, out loud, no matter who you're around, "I lost"  thats it.  thats the game. if you think about it, you say you lost.  I lost  but then again, i'm typing about it, so im currently immune.  but remember! You must ALWAYS play it. there is no finish line

      Everything is wrong, wrongity wrong wrong. It's the 9th of July today, happy 7th anniversary to moi...pppsssh. Man...I'm in Hmailton which is good I guess. But Age is going through a break up right now and I need to be home..bad. I miss Chris alot. I don't know when I'll be home.blah. I'm missing Waterfront right now and tomorrow as well. While i stay here in Hamilton...drifting away from civilization. All I can do is make cd's and sleep. Oh and shop, which has definaltey lost it's lustre.   eeewww yeast infection comercial on tv. Why do they feel the need to do that. Oh and the other day I saw a rather riveting commercial as well. ABOUT HERPES. Honestly. I love how the woman is in the ad with her husband, as if she didnt get herpes grom sleeping around. whatever.  Saw Spiderman 2 today. Meh, it was good dont get me wrong but i havent had a huge reaction to a movie since Pirates. And the second one wont come out till im 18. I was gonna borrow someones ID and go clubbing with my step sister tonight but that didnt happen...apparantly the place theyre going to is reallyreally strict about ID's.   Can't wait till Chris's birthday...yah I've done my shopping...king of the world or what??? I need to find out how much hes going to like it tho, so igotta be sneaky muahah. still need to buy a little something else though. I really would say what it is because i want the world to kno but there is a 4% chance that he'll read this..actually he wont i guaruntee it. but just incase....    I hate break ups. Like there is no such possible thing as good break up. I hate it when people say its okay..we're on good terms...it was a "good" break up. WHATEVER we all know your miserable deal with it!! just put it out there so that your not lying to the world, if your sad and lonely tell soemone...dont try to act like your ex wasnt a dick.  Man I'm a bitch soemtimes...lol. Jebus I wanna go home. theres no place like home.... theres no place like home...cahrazy.  LO freaking L!! hahaha Chris called me last night drunk...so funny. Oh my. It was great.. Miss yah Squishy! and Winifred to ;)hhahaah  Geeeeez I so wanna say what i got him...grrrrrr.. But now the chance of him reading this is higher, he cmae online for a sec and i told him i was writing this so he may read it...probably not...WAHAHA  Well I'm gonna go, I hope to write alot more often because I havent done this in while, it was fun, slates clean again...for now. muaha. byebye  oops actually I'm gonna show you the playlist for my aweosme cd that I love that I just made! :D Bye~!!!!!!!!!  1)Taste of Ink - The Used 2)Time - Pink Floyd 3)About a Girl - Nirvana 4)I Wish You Were Here - Pink Floyd *song of the day 5)Sic Transit Gloria - Brand New 6)Nevermind - Nirvana 7)Iris - Goo Goo Dolls 8)Broken - Seether and Amy Lee (LOVE LOVE LOVE IT) 9)You Know Your Right - Nirvana 10)Champagne Supernova - Oasis 11)Money - Pink Floyd 12)Polly - Nirvana 13)Knocking on Heavens Door - Led Zepplin and Pink Floyd 14)Mother - Pink Floyd (heard Chris play it so much I had to download it (illegally)) :D                                                                            .:ness:.

      Man, Apparently 115 people have looked at my profile.... whoever is, leave a message or something for me. I want a list of who looks at that...  anyway, guess what! there was a car accident in front of the Pro today! it freaked me out a lot. I was just standing with Ki, not doing anything, maybe twenty minutes after I got there, and we hear this Screech and Crash! I look outside, and this black truck is rolling into the lot with a busted front light, and another car, just sitting int he road, completely Written off.  So, this guy (mr.Black truck) was looking for a pot to park in the lot. Meanwhile, Jamie Heath, in the car, is coming into town. So, Mr.Black decides to pull into the lot, across the oncoming lane, not looking to see that theres a car coming. this is where Jamie Hits the brake (hence the screech) but it's too late. mr.Black doesn't clue in intime until he's rammed into the side of Jamies car. Now, theres another contrubutor. A guy was delivering stuff for the store, and his cube van was parked by the road so, when Jamie's car was smashed in the side, the car was side into the cube van, wrecking the other side of the car as well, and banging the van, knocking the guy standing inside off his feet. and there was a lot of glass. some old guy cleaned it up, nice guy.  anyway, theres the story of the night. anything else would be nothing compared to that. it was wierd though, since that's the first time thats happened to me while I'M working. phew, good thing Ki was there. he called the cops over, and it was taken care of in about an hour or so. but, man, Mr.Black (I don't know his name) had two little girls in the car with him, his daughters, and they came into the store and were quiet all the while, poor kids. I know all about that. aww Min. He offered them some popsicles. Min's a good guy. I'm glad he's my boss, as well as Ki. brothers are cool. anyway, TA

      Wait! I just wanted to brag, that the day of the concert we're going up to Toronto for the day, going on a SUBWAY!, a subway! crazy! going to all the cool stores and other cool buildings in T.dot lol. Then going to the Spaghetti factory, then the concert, then Chris finally gets to meet my Daddy!, he lives in Hamilton...After 8 months, he still hasnt met him, so we're spending the night there after the concert instead of driving all the way home. Hamilton is only half an hour from toronto. So braggity brag brag,...haha

      Wow, I really don't remember much. I remember getting there, listening to Bram, Chris, Angus, and some other guy play. Then I hung out with Chris, hmmm...next thing I remember was trying to find a bottle opener...for a twistable bottle, I soon discovered....  Oh haha, anyone remember when I thought it would be cool to throw Chris's keys into the air?? I definatley remember looking for them with Chris for at least more than and hour, giving up, getting one of the adults to try to break into the car...Then Age looking for five minutes..max. And Age screaming I FOUND THEM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! and running towards me and knocking me down...biting my lip in the process. Man was I absolutley amzed that she found them.   Um then Ryan told Calista something personal and Age got pissed and pushed Ryan into a bush..hah! Next thing I remember was sitting in Angus's room with Liam, Age, Meliss, and drugs. Then I mentioned that both Age and Meliss were single and Liam accidentally spilled that Age was going out with Ryan again... I got pissed, ran out of the room crying, went outside, grabbed Emily on the way...she fell in the doorway and bruised her knee. I ranted to her. Chris must have been told that I was freaking out outside because he came outside to calm me down. I talked to him for a while. Age came out...which made it worse. I just screamed at her and cried. Then I just walked away from her...went to the fire. Layed down infront of it with Chris, ranted and raved for a bit. Then Age came and told me that when she went back upstairs and opened the door, Liam and Meliss were making out! HAH.    Hrmmm then, I remember sitting in Angus's room again with Calista, Emily, Angus, and Chris, oh and drugs. Then I left because I was going to throw up. I ran downstairs and Scott Duchersac (haha nice spelling huh?..someone please correct that.) I guess he saw the look on my face because he came outside with me and helped me out.   Then I hung out in the bathroom with Meliss and Age. I sat on the toilet, Meliss was in the tub, and Age was sitting agianst the wall..just chatting. Hmm then they wanted to go downstairs so I followed, puked again, ran into the bathroom to puke some more. Poor stairs...dont worry I cleaned up... Then somehow I found Chris again. We both had to pee so we took turns. But apparantley as I was waiting for him to be done I passed out on the floor.   He came out and woke me up and then we both ended up passing out. Then we woke up and went out to the car to shleepay.   In the morning Calista was talking about how cute we looked passed out togehter...how cute can that be? And everyone at the party had passed by us at a certain point in the party. Some Danielle girl said, yah I took a picture of you guys because it was cute....creepy. Still I'd like to see that picture, lol. Well that's it.   Left in the morning to eat at the Springbrook Restaurant. Chris drove me and Age to my house, we all hung out together. Then we drove Age home and I went to Chris's for the day, and the next day I gave him his b-day present early.   Two tickets to Deep Purple feat. Joe Satriani and Thin Lizzy, in Toronto, a Pink Floyd t-shirt from Atomic, and a picture of us for when he moves away. awww lol. He loved it, I really wish I had a camera, he was very happy. Well that's all I really feel liek updating everyone on so cheerio.  Tah, Ness
