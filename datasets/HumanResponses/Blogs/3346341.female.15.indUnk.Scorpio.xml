        Vampire: Vampires are dead human beings who walk the earth. They are often characterized by fanged teeth pale skin and unearthly eyes.  You have a short fuse.  You know what you want and you will use almost any means to get there.  However, you probably have a soft spot when it comes to the one you love.  You tend to be possesive of those you love and they will never escape you.    urlLink   What Mythological Creature Are You (Many Results and Beautiful Pics)     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      when we was walkin to scan in Nate from 04 put his arm around my shoulder and said whats up. I tried to take it off and he said whats wrong why u ignorinme now. I don't know what he was talkin bout cuz I only said like 3 words to him since I went to that school. I might not even have been three.  I was on time today. Yay!!!!!!!!! First I went to my advisory to see if Kim was there so I could tell her that I was early. I didn't see her so went to look for Michelle in her advisory. On my there I seen Kim at my locker with Tiffany Brown. She was showin her how my locker worked. Cuz you don't have to put in the combination everytime before you open it. Then I just went to Michelle advisory. I asked Johnatthan and Telly is they seen her and they soud no. So i started to leave but I seen her comin. We was talkin at her locker for a while. Then I left cuz I didn't wanna be marked late.  1st period  We was goin over the verbs we learnt last week in spainsh. Then me Kim michelle and alexis started talkin about things that aren't appropriate for me to say right now.  2nd period I found out why that boy was absent. It's ashame that all that happened to him. I don't think I want my friend to go out wit him cuz he ain't like what he seems. In front of people he act all nice and sweet. But he's a lot different when everyone ain't around.  3rd period First I forgot my gym clothes in my locker. Ronni said why don't you just put it in a locker in the locker room. So I had to go to the academic building from the ag. building to get my clothes then go to the gym building. And I still had to change. But I knew I could make it cuz I had to do that before. I walked to the gm buildiing wit Bruce. When I walked past the Health room He was like Janay where you going. I swear if another one of them think I'm in their class I'm gonna go crazy.  She let us do whatever we want again cuz she gotta finish the grade for 04.  I was mindin my business and playin basketball and I finally got the ball I like. Then I was walkin to another court and Braheem missed a shot and his ball rolled away. He looked at me and started to smile. I was like please don't. And started to run. I didn't matter cuz he got the ball ne way. So I was tryin to get the ball back for like 5 mintues. Then I found a new one and Maleah started to play with me. Then Sharif took her ball and I helped her get it back. Braheem pushed my out the gym and tried to lock mr out.  Lunch Nothing happened here  5th period.  They took the boys from my biology class to take the chairs out of the MPR. So we didn't have to do nothin since they wasn't in there. Me Bruce Nicole and Stephanie started singin the coconut song from the lion king. Then we started talkin bout bein bastards. The boys came back and we told them to get out  so we didn't have to do any work. They kept comin back like every 5 minutes until they finally just stayed in the room. The teacher was gonin around the room tellin us our book  numbers so we would turn in the right books. Then she got to Phil and was like oh he's not her. But she seen a bookbag on his desk. She was like Rob is that your bag and he didn't say anything for a while then she asked Braheem he was like Uhh. umm. I don't know whos it is. Then she told them to hand it to her. She went through it and was like he got the 50 cents cd i want this. Then she seen a pice of paper wit his name on it. I asked Roy where phil was at he said that he was playin basketball.  6th period  I just slept and wrote notes the Sade  7 & 8th period  My group presented the trash thingy. It was funny. I was tryin to eat the sour patches without the teacher seein me. Alan fell asleep and almost fell out his chair. Me and Joslyn was laughin at him. Then for no reason he just jumped up and screamed. I was laughin at him and the teacher looked at me cuz she know I always doin somethin to him. I said I swear I didn't even touch him this time.   When we got off the bus after school Richard was in front of me on the escalater. I seen he was bout to look at me so i tried to turn around. When i looked back at him he was still lookin at me. So i waved and started to smile. He said there you go blushin again. I wanted to fell my cheeks to see if i really was blushin. But they were lookin at me and that would seem weird. He said to maleah that I was blushin again. I said no i'm not but i said low i guess they heared me cuz they looked at me funny. When we was bout to get off maleah said that richard said I want him. I can believe he would say that cuz he said it to me before.

      When I came up from the sub steps I felt like I was gonna pass out or somethin. I already couldn't breathe right so whenever I move a lot or something I can't catch my breathe. Oh yea I was late again. But there's no surprise there.  1st period All we did was some worksheets and a page in our workbooks. The boy my friend likes just came back. He was out for like 5 days. He just broke up with his girlfriend that he was going out wit for almost a year. But she wasn't here today. And he likes my friend now so I don't know whats gonna happen when she come back cuz all of us got most of our classes together.  On the way to math when I came out of the academic building I seen Richard thats in 04 coming. But he was like 50 feet away from me. I was almost at the ag building when he grabbed my hand and arm. I couldn't really look at him cuz i had my hood on. I knew it was him cuz I seen his hand and there wasn't that many people around me his complexion and that would do that. I tried to pull away from him but he kept pullin me back. Ne way he ended up making walk into the stupid puddle. Thats okay cuz I pushed him so he would step in it to.  2nd period We did this project thing in math. We needed rice and cups and we had to make some shapes.  3rd period I was scared to have gym today cuz i thought i was gonna die or something, But we got to do whatever we wanted to do. I was playin basketball and I dropped like 7 straight. I was like now why can't I do that when I play around my way. I didn't know Roni was near me she said what are you talkin about. I said when I'm home I can never make ne thing. Some people from the health class kept comin in cuz they were carrying the mats. I was talkin wit Chris for a while and he kept tryin to hit NIck wit the basketball. AT the end of class when I was walkin towards the doors Sharif said you had Mr. Randolf already right.(He's the math teacher we got) I said Yeah I just came from there. He was like then you know what I got don't you. I look at his cup and said please don't tell me you took some of that rice. He said sure did.  Lunch  Sharif was standin next to me in the line and Vernon kept tryin to guess what he had. Then he said come on sis help me out. Me and MAleah was sittin at the table and I heard Bruce say Oh MAn what The fuck. And he was all loud about it. I seen Sharif running out of the MPR. and I seen a whole bunch of little white things. Maleah said what was that. I said it was sharif being a dick head  5th period We didn't get to dissect the cray fish cuz they had dried out or something. The teacher said that the other class did it though. At least Sparky is safe now. Well as safe as a crayfish thats already dead can be. Michelle said she named her's Boxer. Bruce said I seen you in gym. I'm like okay. He said I was playin that freaky volleyball. and i was all on the floor n everything. I said that I wasn't even playin volleyball. Then I seen Travis nodded his head and sayin yea u were. I was like shut up and you were the one playin volleyball ne way.  6th period We read the rest of Ceaser. Mark wrote a rap for some boy in 07. Then he remembered that he did it to the worng beat.  7&8th period We had to mail the letters again. Then the lady came in that helps people get jobs. She said it was this one thing you can be tutor but you only get paid 5.15. I like tutorin people but i'm gonna work wit some stupid kid i don't know just for 5.15 an hour.   I went with Melissa after school to get the form so you can get workin papers. I found Chris in 04 to ask him if he could tell her but he said he wasn't gettin on the bus. Then I asked Chuck and he said he wasn't gettin on the bus either cuz they was playin basketball after school. I seen Richard and was bout to ask him but I remembered I was supposed to be mad at him. So I just went wit Melissa. She wants me to work with her at this place called puppy something or Joyce Leslie. But they In Plymoth Meeting Mall. All i got to do is catch the 27 but not all the 27 buses go that far. And its farther than my school so I would have to leave really early.  I sat on the step while Naseer was playin outside. Oneday I hope Nia just punch himor something

      I got myself sick last night. It's real stupid how I did it to.  I was late today. We had some kind of assembly today and it was like an hour long so me and Kim were studying for the health final.  1st period I slept all period cuz I was sick  2nd period I don't really remember everything that happened  3rd period We took our final in the MPR. There could only be three people to a table. I wanted the two girls I was with to sit at an empty table wit me so we could all be together. Sharif had to sneak in because he was late. He wanted me to go over there and sit with him and Travis but when I was about to get up Anesha said you not leavin me. So i stayed over there. Sharif came over and sat next to me. I said that ain't right cuz Travis couldn't come to. He was like I know I'm not gonna leave him hangin so he went back over there. Travis took out his book wit the notes in during the test. It didn't matter cuz the teacher wasn't really payin attention  Lunch I brought cheese fries. The lunch lady had us sign a pettion( i think i spelt it wrong. you know the thing when u get a whole bunch of people to sign so you can get sopmething) Ne way it was because the school district was tryin to make us eat box lunches. I hate those things. The box pizza be all stale and hard.  5th period We all got our own crate fish cuz we gonna dissect them tomorrow. Johnatthan  was makin his dance. And i named mine Sparky.   6th period I mostly slept in there too  7&8th period People was presentin thier reports. Alan fell asleep and I was puttin pieces of the wrapper from my bottled on his head. We got our last test back today and I got a 100 on that.

      Okay when I woke up I forgot that my friend wanted me to print her out some pictures for her animal. So I was online at 5 something in the morning looking for pictures of Chameloens. Just in case you don't know thats one of those lizard thingys that change colors.   Ne way I actually made it to school on time. I forgot what I use to do before the late bell would ring so I just went around tellin people that I was ontime.  In advisory me friend had a fan that sprays you at the same time and we were playin wit that  1st period Nothin really happened in Spanish we just kept playin wit the fan. On the way to second period I told Kim to spray Maleah wit the fan  2nd period All I did was take note then go to sleep. And Sade was doin my hair  3rd period Me and Maleah was playin basketball in Gym while we were waitin for class to start until Braheem(i don't know if thats how u spell his name) kept takin the ball. Then my teacher came out and told us to put all the stuff away and go to our spots. But she went back into her office. So Travis started plain wit a soccer ball. I took it from him and wouldn't give it back. But i saw the teacher comin and threw it to him before she seen me. He almost got and trouble and he was mad at me.  Why did we have to play kick-ball today. I was sweatin like crazy when we went into the locker rooms  Lunch Me and Maleah went to the library cuz they had the air conditioner on.  5th period We had to dissect those stupid 12inch worms. Roy wanted to cut it first then he almost throw up. So I took it from him then cut some more. Then he was like I can do this I'm a fucking soldier. I said whatever then we started arguing. He wasn't payin attention and cut to deep into the thingy thats like the stomach and all this black and brown stuff started to come out. He said Oh god and turned his head to the side I said You better not be about to throw up you little bitch. Cuz you know I'm never gonna let you live it down.  6th period We were suppose to workin on our group project but we just talked and I was doin my ag. homework.   7&8th period.  In ag. we had fun we had to make things out of trash. It wasn't really trash just things you would throw away. Like paper towel rools. ribbions, napkins, and paper plates. My group made a snow blower. For one part of it we wasn't allowed to talk to each and we acted like we was usin morse code. another group was grutin and other people were actin like they knew sign lanuage. Another part we were only allowed to use our right hand. But we cheated everytime she turned away.   Nothing happened on the bus today and I'm surprised. When I was down town I seen this boy Drew. I met him when I was workin at the summer session for 07.

I turned around and said to the girl on the other team,"If he said acid and rain it's over" And after like three minutes of tryin to guess what it washe finally said and rain. I was like oh my god. Then he turned around to look at me and I told him not to talk to me cuz he was an idiot.

      Yesterday I went to the movies with Maleah and Mary to see White Chicks. When I had called mary earlier she told me she didn’t have ne money so I got 5 dollars from Nelly. Then I had to wait for them to get ready. Me and mary brought tokens the we got on the 17 to 15th street. Then we had to wait for the 27 to come. Mary wanted to sit in the middle part. We played I spy. Then we was walkin to the front and the buys turned when it was getting off the express way and it made us sit in the seats. We was waitin to cross the street and we weren’t sure if we had to push the button to make the light change. We got to the place the movie didn’t start til 4:40 so we started walkin around. We went to CVS and brought a whole bunch of candy Mary put lotion on me. The lady said it was 4:00. Then we started walkin back. We waited outside of this apartment thingy. Then we was walkin on this thingy and had to jump off.   At the movies Mary was putting worms in the cup holder thing. It was nobody in there so I did a cartwheel in the front. We all sat in different rows. Then we left out to get juice then came back and actually sat together. Durin the movies Maleah went to the bathroom when she came back to told me about the hand dryer things. So we went to the bathroom when the movie was over and I can’t say ne thing bout the dryer thing.  When Maleah left and we was still waitin the bus a car went by that said accurate and we had a whole conversation bout that. Then when we finally got on  the bus we sat in the back and I was makin some guy mad.  I walked Naseer to the store and we went pass Mary step and he said hi to Thomas and I don’t think Thomas said nething back. He told me my dad came by and gave me some money. When we was back on the step I seen the Snapple bottle and Naseer told me it had ants in there and I asked him how they got there he said he put them there. What a sick nephew I have. But I made it fall ne way and it broke.  My mom is gonna be leavin next week she goin to Mexico. YAY!!!! The bitch is gonna  be gone. But shes gonna make me stay at my aunt house. NOO!!!! I’m gonna be stuck wit another dum@$$ bitch.  Then she said my dad wants me to feed the dogs when he’s gone. I didn’t even know he was leavin unless he’s gonin wit her but I tought that she was gonin wit somebody else. But ne way I have an excuse to see my sexy doggies everyday. And if it’s next week ii have an excuse to leave my aunts house. Then I’ll probably go to mary  house or something.   Jason jus called for Jenelle and he asked if I rememberd him. I said no then he just kept talking like we friends or something. He’s a loser ne way.

      When I got on the bus Sean was sittin where I usually sit and was looking at his yearbook cuz the seniors theirs last Friday. Some boy that be on there sometimes was sittin in the other corner but he gets off at walnut or something. So I sat a in the middle Then I turned and started starin and smiling at him. I thought he was just ignorin me cuz I was doin it for a while so I said bitch. He looked at me like I was crazy or something so I guess he really wasn’t payin attention. I rolled my eyes at him then sat right. The boy got off then I went to my seat. When we as at city hall I asked him if I could see it when he was done. Ali got on and he was bein gay or  really really  feminine.  I was on time but it doesn’t matter cuz school was basically over.  We didn’t do ne thing in Spanish  In math we was watchin Brother Bear. Then me Ashley, and Sade started playin Bull  In gym we could have just walked out cuz nobdy was payin attention to us. Shannon got in trouble cuz she wasn’t wearin pants that went pass he ankles. Kim Ashley and Anesha was briadin my hair. Then we started unbraidin it cuz we was board as hell.  During Lunch Ashley asked me to walk her to her locker so she could give the lock back and take the stuff out.  Ne way when I was back in the lunch room Ms. Steiner came in and told me to come over. She told me to come pass her class later and get the stuff for A.P. English. Kim asked me if I got in and she was all happy. I didn’t really wanna be in it. I didn’t think I would get in cuz they went by last years English grades. I got a D  on the first report a F on the second n third and a B in the forth one.  In biology we played I spy  Me Michelle Carl and Kasy just talked in English  When I was bout to go to ag Veronica told me there was nobody in the classroom. I went there and it was empty as shit. Terrance came and said he was leavin. I went to ask the vice princple who I pay the money to for my temporay ids. She said Mr. Weston. I was bout to leave when my Ag teacher came in and seen me. We went to the class room then we went to the ag building. She told me to go to mr. Weston when I was comin back I seen Sharif I told him she was around the corner.But she didn’t see him when she came back. Melissa and Joclyn was wit her. Then Me and Joclyn went to Ms. Simmens room .We was in there until Sharif came and was tryin to run in but Ms. Simmens was blockin the way. He got in then ran and jumbed over the teachers desk I ran around it and our teacher came in. We had to leave. Then me and him got away. And that’s how it went for the rest of the day.  Mary says that I’m sprung for this boy because of what happened Sunday or Saturday. I don’t even know what that means

      I got an award for perfect attendance. Tiffany said you late everyday but u still come. Kim said yeah u lucky if you make to advisory or 1st period. Which is true. Sharif told Tep that I went out wit some white boy in 9th grade and he believed him. Tep asked me then told me Sharif told him that so I threw Preston's book at him.  The assembly was over at 9:00. Then we went to our advisory we got our yearbooks and they told us if we passed or not. I was ready to leave at 9:10 but I had to wait for Maleah and Sherelle. So we ended up leavin around 10:20. I was mad cuz I could have been left.  Kim signed my yearbook even though I told her that I didn’t want ne one to sign it. Then Elyse wrote something. Joclyn came in and she gave me a hug. We was talking bout how we always laughed at Josh in ag and other thin  We got downtown at 11:00 me and Maleah went to Moda on Walnut street. We was there for like 5 minutes and didn’t get nething. Then I went to Mary’s house  We was at Mary house for a while then Lamar came. He made me mad so I left.

      I don’t know if I was marked late or not  Advisory Me Stephanie and Preston were the only ones sittin there. We had to fill out some survey thing  1st period I did nothing except talk to Amanda. When the bell rung it was 9:00. I asked my teacher why I was ringin now cuz I forgot we had a half day.  2nd period me and Ronni was playin hang man. She couldn’t get one of mine it was like PETA took the doggies. Then I couldn’t get her’s it was something bout orange soda and hard and soft shell tacos. But I don’t know anything bout tacos. The teacher was givin us the grades for the final. He said I got the highest grade out of both classes. And I got a 70. I was like damn did everybody fail then. Ashley got a 50 and Ronni said she got less than that.  3rd period Me and Ronni was playin wit the shoppin cart and throwin footballs in it. Then I started talking to Kim. Travis showed me some shit he made. It’s mixed with all this stuff  Lunch 04 was in the MPR practicing cuz it was rainin. Sean was sittin where we usually be at so I sat at the other end of the table. Chris came over and I gave him a hug.   5th period  It was only like 10 of us in there. We was watchin the Day After Tomorrow. And we kept skippin to parts were people died. Travis told me he left that stuff in the lunch room. He said if someone drink it they gonna be fucked up.  6th period My teacher was at the gradation thing so we had to go to room 4 which is where I was 5th period. On my way back to class I seen Minor, she’s the freshmen Ashley, and she asked me for some of my juice. I gave it to her even though I don’t like people drinkin my stuff. In class we watched the rest of the Day After Tomorrow. Some of the people who wasn’t there last period was mad cuz we started it from where we left off. Mr. Scenna called people from 06 that had books to give back to go to room 206. Preston said he had to go but thought he would get in trouble. I told him to just go cuz the teacher wasn’t gonna say ne thing. Soon as he walked out the door I called her. I wasn’t that loud. I wouldn’t do that to my brother  7th & 8th period  We was back in our class. She made us watch the Regan thing. We was laughin cuz some people was fallin asleep. All the boys except for Lamont was playin cards.  The rest of us was talking. Tyrice ran over to where we was at and then Sharif and Bruce are throwin cards at each other. We tried to get Tyrice to tell us what happened but he was laughin to hard. Marc came over and said it was happenin in slow motion to him and told us everything that happened liked that   There wasn’t ne charters cuz today wasn’t a normal day that we get out early. So first I went to the 27 stop right outside my school but that one went past. So I was bout to walk up to the second one from my school. I seen Ben and told him to come wit me. He wanted to wait for the charters I told him they wasn’t comin. Then I seen Ashley and Ronni waitin for the 65 charter I said they could wait if they wanted but it wasn’t comin till 3:14. So they started walkin wit us. When we got there I seen Sherelle walkin up there. When we got there we had to wait along time so me and Ronni started playin I spy. Then Tiffany Brown was singin the song that never ends wit me.   On the bus Shrelle told me she was goning to 23rd and Passyunk. I thought she was playin at first and I asked her what bus she was getting on. Octavia said she had to catch the broad street line too but she was gonin northbound. SO they needed me to show them how to get there. Then octavia said she was gonna catch the trolley and was beggin me to show her where it was. I kept telling her we had to go that way ne way.  Sherell said she knew the twins and she thinks they annoyin too.  Irene came over cuz she needed Nelly to braid her hair

      Richard was on the bus. At first I didn’t notice him until he sat down he was only a seat away from me. I didn’t know what to say. He was like sup Janay and I just waved. I didn’t think about what I should say to him. We was on the express way and I was tryin to think of what to tell him. By the time we got to the Wissahickcon Transfer Center I was just like fuck it. Cuz it’s not like I knew that long so I won’t miss him or anything. And he only gonna be around for like 2 more days so it ain’t worth it.  Advisory I gotta give Alyssa 23 dollars for the stuff I ordered.  1st period We was just talking about stuff. Then Crystal P told us bout the movie that they shottin in front of Shalmont. It’s a school up there that most of them went to. It has Cuba Goodin Jr in it and it’s called Shadows or something.  2nd period They was practicing for the graduation  and I guess they start in front of the ag building cuz the was all lined up standing there. When I came out of the academic building Richard was right there he was callin me but I was actin like I didn’t here him.  We took the other part of the final. Chris came in while we was doin the test he asked me why we was in ag. I told him it’s math but the teacher just uses this room. Then Ashley said shouldn’t you be practicing or something. After we was done we was watchin them. Chante came up and said something to me bout them practicing like I didn’t know what was gonin on. I said I know what the fuck they doin. She was like what you say to me. I said I don’t know honestly all I remember is sayin fuck. Then she said Oh my god Janay I never heared a curse word come out your mouth. The only reason why I said it is cuz she was getting smart wit me and Ashley.  3rd period Me Maleah Sharif, and Shannon went outside the gym building and sat on the bench thingy. Then we went back in but was satndin at the doors. Shannon left and Phil came over. Me and Sharif was passin the ball to each other. Then him n Phil went to play and Ronni came over. Richard was comin over so I went back in the gym. I got my bookbag and asked Maleah if she wanted her’s. We could have left if we wanted to cuz we had our bags n shit already and we was already outside.  I asked Maleah how Richard knew me. Cuz when he first started talking to me he was sittin wit Maleah and I thought she had told him bout me. But she said he had already knew my name n stuff. I don’t really talk to ne body in 04 that he hangs out wit. I seen him wit Josh in 04 a few times But it was like forever since I talked to him and I don’t think he knew my name. And he has a girlfriend so I don’t know what he was doin.  Lunch We ate  5th period We didn’t dissect the frogs again so Frogger is safe for now. Even though he stomach and legs are already cut open. I was sittin with  Bruce Nicole and this girl and I always forget her name. I asked Bruce why boys like girls fightin so much cuz me and Mary wanted to know. He was like I don’t know I just like like it and they be pullin eachother’s cloths off. Then I asked him if it’s because it’s like watchin have sex. He said Yea that’s why. I said Okay cuz I told my friend that’s why  6th period We watched Lion King ½.  7th & 8th period We was wit Ms. Brown class again. We was watchin School house of Rock. We was playin elimnition pitty pat for a while. Then she passed out packs of crybabies that had five in it. So Marc says lets play for Crybabies. Everyone who played has to give the winner one crybaby. Tyrice had one the first time. I kept makin it to the last round then lose. She gave us some more and I asked kim for some so I could keep playin She asked me if I won yet I said no then she said then why you keep doin it. I played l2 more rounds then stopped cuz I didn’t wanna give away ne more. Ashley had won the last time but they all ran so they didn’t have to give her one. Janysha gave her some but Lamont, Sharif, Marc and Tyrice ran. I was gonna give her on of mine but I wanted it   I gave Maleah a crybaby and I ate the last one. I was playin Ben and he didn’t know it. Gerald got on the bus. I didn’t notice how much I missed him bein on the bus. He’s funny. He left a few weeks ago and he’s goin to Southern. He lives on 13h and Locust so all he gotta do is go to broad street and catch the sub. Me and Kim had seen him earlier when we was goin to Spanish.  I took all the stuff out my locker. I’m use to havin that locker cuz I had it since I was a freshmen. But I’m gonna get a locker in the ag building next year. Freshmen and Sophomores  get lockers in the academic building and seniors and juniors get lockers in the ag building. I’m gonna get a full one next year and get a half one next year. So I’ll half two or 1 ½. I liked my old locker cuz I didn’t always have to put the combination in and I could just open it. I found my notebook from Deasy class. He was our first ag. teacher this year. It mostly got notes from me and Michelle   Naseer had just got out of the tub and was bout to brush his teeth. So I out the towel on him so it wouldn’t fall down and he didn’t have to hold it. Then he wanted me to do it again and was sayin it was a skirt. Then he started singin baby boy. Why all my nephews gotta be gay. The only ones that act normal is Idris son and Anige. I have no clue how to spell his name.  Right now i'm tryin to find my transpass

      I seen Joy when I got off the sub. I was just me and her on the back of the bus. So I was thinking this probably will be my only chance. So I said, You know Richard told me you said I liked him. She looked at me and said no. I knew he was lyin bout that cuz Joy wouldn’t say nothing bout me like that. After a while she said that he said to her that he was tryin to mess wit some girl named Janay but she didn’t think he was talking bout me. Mary made me think about that cuz I’m the only Janay at my school. So anyway I’m happy I talked to her today cuz I was gonna say something to Richard and I would feel bad if I said that then found out he had seriously liked me. I thought he was just playin wit me. So I’m gonna try to talk to him tomorrow. But I still don’t know what to say to him or when I can say it to him. He might not be on the bus wit me and if he is I don’t want everybody in my business. I seen him when I’m in 2nd period but that’s only cuz they be praticin for their gradution outside and I can’t just call him over in the middle of it. Plus Ronni and Ashley got that class wit me and they would think something cuz they already think that I like him. And after the practice they usually leave. So I won’t really have a chance to talk to him  I actually got to school before the first bell rung. I seen Ronni at tone of the tables in the MPR so I went over there and started talking wit her.   Advisory We didn’t do nothing  1st period I told Kim about some problems I had. And we was watchin MTV 2.  2nd period We took the first part of our Math final. Oh yea I got a 75 on my Spanish final, a 93 on my English, 90 on Biology, and that’s all the test except for math.  3rd period  Maleah hid my clothes. She need to hide Ronni or Ashley’s clothes cuz they the ones that’s always takin her’s. So when I went in the locker room I took their stuff. I wasn’t gonna give it back until they gave me my stuff back. Maleah came in and gave me my clothes so I gave them their stuff back.  Lunch Nothin happened  5th period  We started dissecting to frogs. I feel I little pick sorry for Frogger(just a little (a little little) ) Roy started getting on my nerves again. I only take people shit for so long. I’m surprised he couldn’t tell I was getting mad at him. Whenever I start cursin at you like that you should know I’m mad.  6th period We watched the rest of the movie  7th & 8th period We went wit Ms Brown’s ag. class. She at the penn state trip. We were doing more of the mulch stuff. Then we started walkin around I left and started beggin people for change. I went to Bruce and he was sayin how the boy in Mr. winter’s ag class throw a orange at him. I said to him if you give me some change I won’t tell ne body bout the orange. He was like what you say. Then he opened his bottle and poured the water on me. I started runnin but it didn’t matter cuz the whole half of my shirt was wet. It was a dark blue shirt ne way. I scared cuz I’m gonna wear a white shirt tomorrow. I better bring a hoody just in case. I asked him why he did it he said how dare you give me an ultimatum. I went inside the ag building and started askin people in there for change. Then I was talking to Lamont and for o reason this time he poured water on me. I really didn’t care that much cuz it was hot as fuck outside and I was actually doin work. It ain’t easy spreadin mulch around like that.   When she unlocked the classroom I got my bookbag and started looking for change. I got my dollar and asked the teacher if I colud go to the bathroom. She said yea. I went to the bathroom in the ag building then ran to the academic building and went into the MPR. None of those damn machines were takin dollars so I went back. I seen so people in my class in the Greenhouse class room. And I asked the people from 06 in there for some change. I don’t know why they was in there cuz it was a freshmen class.  We were watchin bringin down the house in ag. I went around putting Crystal’s make up on people makin up all this shit like it covers freckles, mole and tans. And I said it made your skin tone even and it made u look younger.  Alan was playin wit the ballon. Ms Snyder let him pop it and breathe in the helium. He did and said Oh Shit. It was funny as hell. Then Tyrice did it and said Nooo. He said that cuz he didn’t think it was working then Marc Murphy did it and said Oh shit too.    I didn’t really do nothing after school except talk to Mary. The thing about not talkin to the people ain't even all about what happened yesterday. I think is was yersterday. It's more like seein how long we can go without talkin to them n shit. And hang out without over the summer like we use to. But I neverbeen wit mary the whole summer without them. Last year was the first time I stayed around here cuz i usually go across the tracks  My dad came over to help put the air conditioner in. I gave him the stuff I brought Venesiha for her birthday, okay I don't know how to spell her name and thats a shame cuz its my own sister. Then he asked how old I though all-nie was i said at least 7. cuz we got him when I was in 3rd grade but I don't know how long we had him before that and he wasn't a puppy when we first got him. Then he asked how old Huff was. He 4. He thought he was older then four cuz he thought we had them before we had black and Jakill. O yea Huff birthday was june 5th. He we keep them they gonna be the first dogs that i ever had until they died noramlly. My other ones were put to sleep, shot by my brother, killed by each other, had to give some away and a lot of other thingies.

      When I got off the sub I seen this boy and he was bout to walk past me.  Then he was like Hi janay. And I’m just stareing thinking who the fuck is you. I’m thinking to myself okay he’s tall, light skin, getting off the sub at Lombard n South, and knows my name, Oh yea I know him. So I said hi he was wit his mom or something. His name is Jamal, or Jalil, but I think its Jalil cuz I think I only know one Jamal.   On the bus I had wanted to tell Richard what Maleah said but that Sean was all in my business. And I couldn’t tell him when we got off cuz Maleah got on at the Transfer Center. Then this girl that I think use to go to my school was all touchin the ring on my bracelet. I think she was in 02 cuz everyone in 04 be talking to her. But she might be from 01 cuz I never seen ne body from 05 talk to her.   I was on time today and happy as shit. I got the newspaper that the picture of every senior in philly. And we was looking at it in advisory.  1st period Nef was telling them something that happened to him when he stayed at Carl’s house. But they started laughin at him so he left. I came over and was like what happened. Alexis told me that his mouth was dry. I asked why was his mouth dry. She sadi she didn’t know cuz he didn’t finish but said I’ll give you a clue he sleptover a gay boy’s house. So he ended up telling us some more of it and we kept laughin at him.  We got Alexis to brake up with Johnathan cuz he thought he was playin her n shit. She said she was gonna do it after class. We was tryin to think of ways to say it.   2nd period We seen Johnathan in the hall way she said she just said I wanna brake up with you and then walked away. Before we got to class Michelle told me she was gonna cut  and asked me if I wanted to go with her. I said I was cool. We just did a worksheet in class and looked at the paper wit people. Everyone kept askin me why Gamp didn’t have a lot of people graduating.  3rd period When we were changing in the locker room Ashley didn’t have her shirt so Michelle R. Let her use hers but she said it was too tight. So I gave her mine and she was supposed to give me Michelles But that idiot gave it back and closed the locker. She just lucky as hell that I wore a whie T-shirt. We gotta wear A white T-shirt and blue shorts. She let us do what ever we wanted and I was happy cuz I didn’t feel like sweatin in the cloths I had to wear.   Maleah showed everybody  in class Richard’s picture and told them I liked him.  When we was kickin the balls across the gym one almost hit me and Maleah. We was standin there and it was comin right at us. She wasn’t facin it so I seen it before her I pushed her out the way then ducked. I was so fuckin scared cuz I felt the wind from it n shit from it when it went passed my head. That was comin fast and hard I knew that Jay did it.  Lunch  We started talking bout Bush. I don’t know how cuz I was standin up and eatin at first.  5th period We had to get our frogs. Then we had to open its mouth and put a toothpick in it and we had to name ours. Me and Roy named ours Frogger.   I guess Stephanie thinks I can read lips good or something. I was like you want me to cut scissors wit you. Cuz she had used the littlte hand signthingy for cutting. Then I was like ohh do u want me to cut wit you. No I’m cool.  6th period We watched more of the movie. I slpet in the beginning part cuz I already seen that part.  7th & 8th period We had to go to ms. Brown room for ag. She was our second ag. rotation teacher this year. We helped her class put out the mulch n shit.   After the 7th period bell I just stopped working and started walkin around my school. Then I walked around wit Ashley. We just stayed in the ag building. I got her to buy my id. It had broke and I had to order a new one but I never picked it up. It was only 2 dollars. I still owe like $35 from usin the temporary ids  After school Maleah asked if I wanted to go wit her and Ben to the wendy’s on 15 & walnut. I said no cuz I was mad at Ben.  I was outside wit Mary. She said we shouldn’t talk to the people on this block anymore.  I was playin wit Nia and she kept getting hurt. Then we was following Kalia to see where she was goin. And that it basically.

So we get to school about   2 minutes late. Today they was havein the awards thing for 04 and everyone came. Since we came late they tell us to go to room 2. the teacher for that room was Ms. Myres. Then we find out we can’t talk or go anywhere. She wasn’t letting people to the bathroom or anything. Veronica was sick and she just walked the fuck out. Me and like six other people started doin the wave. After  a while people just started walkin out and shit. Then we were singin the 100 bottles of beer on the wall song. I was sittin in that fuckin hell for two hours.  1st period Did nothing  2nd period  We did this worksheet thing. I sit all the way in the front and Stephanie sits all the way in the back. Then I hear her sayin Janay Maleah showed me your boyfriend. And whos your boyfriend Janay and said he was in 12th grade. Then she starts discribin him. I said Oh god please tell me she did not do that.  3rd period Did nothing again  Lunch. I’m in line and Ronni says to me. So Janay I saw your boyfriend today. I said hat the hell u talking about. She was like that senior. Then Octavia(how every u spell her name) said o yea maleah showed us ur boyfriend. Then Maleah came out of nowhere. I said what the fuck did u tell them. Then she started sayin that I was clappin for him and shit when they called him up. And I already knew he was gonna win something so I brought him flowers and gave them to him. What the fuck was she talking bout cuz I wasn’t even at the damn assembly. I was stuck in that fuckin classroom for like 50 years.  Now we sittin at the table I said to her. I can’t believe you told all these people that I went out with him. She said she didn’t all she said was that whenever I’m around him I blush and keep smiling. I said that’s not cuz I like him I do that with everyone I don’t know like that. She said whatever then why do you always do it around him. I said cuz I feel uncomfortable and that’s what I do when I’m nervous or something. She said well u know u like him ne way. Then Kim was like u like him. I said no I didn’t even know that he existed before a week ago.   5th period Stephanie kept interrogating the shit out of me. She said why would you go out wit somebody llike a week before school over. I said that cuz I’m not goin out wit. She said whats his name anyway. I told her his name was Richard. She asked his last name I was like I don’t know I just learnt his first name. And he ugly ne way. She said he ain’t even ugly. Then I told her he has a girlfriend she said yea you. So I just spent the rest of that class bein mad at maleah  6th period  I think I went to sleep in thiis class.  7th & 8th period We went over to the last ag class we had. It was Aniaml/Meat science.We went to look at our old cows. Then me and Kristy went to play wit the barn cats.  Everybody was knocked out except for 5 people. I wasn’t even payin attention. All I did was stare at the paper and kept putting braids in my hair. Alan kept noddin and he almost broke his fuckin neck   I was sittin on the step wit nelly and my hair was on my arm. I thought it was a bug or something. So I was like holy and I tried to stop myself cuz she still think that I don’t curse. So she couldn’t understand the rest I said. When Naseer came she made him take his stupid gay little chair in the house cuz he kept playin wit it. Then he got all mad and shit. So he comes back out a few minutes later with one of the comes that got the metal pointy part at the end. Holdin it like he bout to stab her and looking all crazy. So she took him in the house and beat him. I was fuckin dyin.  Me and her walked to 7 eleven she said it was something crawlin on my shirt ad I started screamin and jumbin. I don’t know what made me do all that.  When we was on my step my cousin Andre came by, he’s the one that just got out of jail. Then my brother Idris rode by. He got a new old car. Then Ski (I don’t know how to spell his real name) rode by. Then Carmela rode pass, She one of my nephews mom. I said to Jenelle what is there some kind of reunion going on somewhere.

      On the bus this morning it was me Sean Chuck and Tyrik. Sean started sayin something bout what makes a hood a hood and how he wants to leave when he’s older. Then Him and Tyrik started talking bout how his cousin was killed for no reason and stuff. Sean said something bout his dream when terrorists started shootin and he got hit. And he said he was forever dyin in his dreams. He was naming all the ways he died then he said one time this girl had poisoned my food. I stopped laughin and was just starin at him. That had happened when we was goin out. And he told me that I had tried to poison him in his dream. I didn’t even notice I was just starin at him. Then I looked at Chuck and he was looking a me funny then kept looking between me and Sean. I hate when he does that he’s always sayin stuff  like that on purpose. He says like its normal but know I know what he’s talking bout.  Tyrik was sayin how the say everything Iverson do. He was actin like he was reading sometin And said Today Iverson trips over shoe lace and damn near dies. Then he said how he’s tired of Smarty Jones cuz he’s just a stupid horse. And then I gave him my paper and it was like 3 full pages of him so he started rippin it up.  Good news I was on time today.  Advisory I was helping Kim with her essay for the AP English thingy.  1st period Kim walked me to my English teacher room so I could get him to sign the thingy for my AP English paper thingy. When we was walkin towards Spanish I was tryin to see what he wrote next to his name. It said highly recommended and I was all hype about it. We took the second part of the final today. We had to write 5 paragraghs on different thingys  2nd period When I was outside the ag building I seen 04 Chris. He seen me then started smiling n shit. So of course I started smiling because he was smiling and I didn’t know why. He walked up to me and said Mr.G showed us your tape. That was funny as hell. And why was you playin wit the cat like that. I knew I was blushin then cuz I felt my face. I was like he really showed it to y’all, oh great. In class I told Sade.  3rd period We watched a movie bout anorexia. Ashley said I’m a fat anorexic. Sharif gave me my pencil back. Then I told him he still owed me for helping him yesterday in ag.  Lunch I told Maleah that when I was talking to her on the phone last night that I couldn’t hear half of what she was sayin. Then me and Kim was talking bout the essay for the English thingy. Then Maleah came back and said that’s not even what we had to write about. It’s what we would be doin in 10 years. I said damn you hype and don’t even knoe what you talking about. Kim said yea we not even doing the ag thing.  5th period  She was collectin our books. And I didn’t have mine. Then the teacher asked Phil was that book behind him his. I looked over and seen the numbers on the side of the book. I’m thinking is that mine. Then he said know and she told him to see whos  it was. He opened it and looked at me and said my name. I was so happy and stuff. I kept tryin not to smile.  Then the teacher told us that we wouldn’t have a science class next year. But she said we might get us as seniors. She said shes gonna request us and said especially you. I said why she was like I like you that’s why.  6th period Chris and chuck came into our English class to say something to Mr. G. Then they looked in and Chris said her tape was funny Mr. G. Mr.g said that’s to girls that made it.  Chris said who the other girl. He didn’t know Sade and was looking for  her and she sit right in front of me.  We got our finals back. I got the highest grade on both parts. On the first part I got I 96 and on the second part I got a 90. He had to curve the grades cuz  a lot of people did bad. On the frist part a 21 was a D. A 30 was a c. and 70 was like a B and a 85 was a A. 96 was an A plus. On the second part 50 was a D, 60 was a C+. 70 was a B 80 was a B+ and 90 was a A plus.

      I got on the early bus and everything. But there was an accident on the expressway or something. So I ended up getting there the same time I would normally get there. The second bus got there the same time as the bus I was on.   Advisory We were talking about something. Preston kept touchin my arm. And I was tryin to act normal and like I didn’t care. But it was hard cuz I don’t want him touchin me.  1st period We took our final. Kim had gummy bears in her book bag and I kept leaning over to take some. The teacher thought I was tryin to cheat off her. But she was really the one cheatin off of me. But I started to get sick from eatin so many. We didn’t have time to finish so I just put a for the rest of them.  2nd period  I was late cuz I was waitin for Kim to finish her test. But I left her anyway cuz she only had to go downstairs and I had to go all way to the bottom floor of the ag building. I seen Richard outside of the ag. building and he walked me to my class. The teacher collected our textbooks.  3rd period We were working on a different part of our project. Then I started helping Sharif and Travis wit theirs. They had to do it over cuz the teacher said they did something wrong.  Lunch Nothing special happened. When me and Maleah was bout to go outside my English teacher seen me. He said that Joslyn told him I got answers from her cuz she let me see the paper with her definitions. He was like id this true. I said know cuz I don’t even talk to her until ag.  5th period We took the second part of our final. Most of the stuff was easy cuz it was stuff we learn in some of our ag classes. It had a lot of stuff from floriculture, plant science, landscape management, and greenhouse management. Royce needed help with most of it and I had to keep givin him answers. Roy was like you dumb as shit man. If I know this stuff then you better know it. When I was done my test I gave it to Royce so he could copy it. Then I started to make a cheat sheet for our ag test. I told Bruce he should start makin one.  6th period I seen Tyrice when I was bout to go to my locker. He grabbed my stomach and I guess I hit his hat or something and it fell. He was like you tryin to take my hat and then you kick it. I got it for him then told him he better start makin a cheat sheet for ag. Upstairs I went to Joslyn’s class but she wasn’t in there yet so I went outside off it. I seen her then told her what our teacher said. She told me she just said she let me see the list wit the words on it. Which isn’t true either. So I just went to English.  He told the class that the video me and Sade made was gonna go on the final type thingy. The guy came in and told us about applyin for the Advance Placement English course. My teacher said he wanted to make sure I got one. I gonna write the essay for it. English is real easy for me and it gets borin so I doin that.   7th & 8th period. The teacher let people do their presentations first so it gave us a chance to make our cheat sheets. Durin the test I guess she seen Sharif cheatin or something cuz she told up and started walkin towards the back. She was walkin all fast n stuff and she was starin straight at him. But before she gets to him she had to walk past me first. She was like a second   and a half away from he him. So I called her. I was like Ms. Snyder. And I was all hype about it. She stopped in the middle of walkin first she looked at him then came to me. I asked her a question about the test. After she told me what to do she walked back up front. I looked back a Sharif he was like thanks, good lookin little one.   And I have to remember to write the thingy for my ag. career so I don’t get a stupid class for my major. And if I get a stupid class as my major anyway I’m gonna be mad.    Me and Maleah went to the Beauty Supply store at city hall before we went home. She had broken the comb thing on her mom’s blow dryer. So she wanted to get a new one before her mom noticed

      1st period just studied for our final  2nd period I spent half to period tryin to show Sade how to do the Math. And the other half tryin to finish the homework for my next class. My friend told me I was actin moody yesterday and was bein mean to people. I already knew I was. But when I am I start sayin how I really feel. So I started lookin for people and sayin sorry to them.  3rd period We had a sub but still had to finish our project. Me and Anesha was done so we just started talkin wit people. I was helpin Travis wit his. Then I helped Ashley.  Lunch Kim talked me into applyin for AP English. I need to b in that cuz English is to easy for me. Thats why I stop doin my work after a while.  5th period When I walked in the teacher was like y'all got 5 minutes before the test starts. I looked at the board and it said finals today take out a pencil. Roy had came in after me I asked him if he knew that it was today he said no. It was eaier than I thought it was goin to be. I was done in like 15 minutes. Then we went to sleep for the rest of the period. I think tomorrow it's gonna be essays. I'm gonna be bullshitin the whole thing.  6th period I told Maleah about the final. she said why y'all have it today i said i don't know. Iwaited for her to finish puttin her books away then I went to class. We read these two short stories while people made up the final  7th & 8th period  We were havin a quiz but she had to go to the office so like everybody started makin cheat sheets. Then she had to call someone. Then she was like thank y'all but I gotta go back real quick. I said no thank you for givin us all this time. Then me and Joslyn was tryin to figure out what we was gonna do wit it. I said I'm puttin on my jacket but she didn't have her's today. Then she said she was gonna lay down and hide it wit her hair. Then I said I would do that too.  Oh yea for our ag class next year we pick our thingys So we can have that class as our major. Before you could just write down the class you wanted to major in and dependinon your class rank and how many people wanted to that class you would get it. But now you gotta pick a carrer from this list and they gonna pick a class. We was like what if they give us a class we don't want. She said they gonna try to match it up. All I wanna do is take Small Animals for 11th and 12th grade. And its a full year class so I don't gotta worry about pickin two. I said for all this I mines as well go to southern and be a crack head. She was like whats Southern. Alan said it's Soth philadelphia high school. She said why would you do that. I said if I'm gonna be put in a class I don't wanna be in I should just go there. Alan said thats what happen when you go to your neighborhood school cuz they bad. Y'all send people there thinkin its a good school and all.    After school I met Maleah outside. I told her to meet me at Kim's locker and wait for me. When we was all there we started walkin Sarah's Mom gave us a ride. Then we went in the shoprite. After that we went to Kim's hose. I got orange juice some cheese its and a ice cream bar. Maleah said how u gonna go to someone house and eat all their stuff. I adi its easy you should try it oneday. Then we waited for the 9 to go to the Acme on Ridge Ave. She did the thing on the computer and that took like for ever.  When we got outside I said is it supposed to rain today, she was like yea. As soon as we started walkin it started drizzlin. We went back and i put on my jacket and she put up her umbrella. Then we went back to the 9 stop. After like 3 minutes it just pourin and it got real windy. I kept movin around her so she could block the wind and most of the rain. Her whole leg was wet and her butt. And from the knees down on my pants was soak. I was like damn why this gotta happen. Then it just got  even harder and we both tryin to fit up under her one little umbrella. After a while I was like damn we ain't even payin attention the bus could have went pass. Then I went out to look for it. I said Oh shit come on Maleah it's comin. We got downtown at like 4:55. When I got off the sub at snyder it was all sunny and shit. I was like what the fuck is going on. I got home at 5:30.

      On the 27 Richard sat next to me. After a while he said would you go out wit me. I said no. He was just playin ne way. Then he said i'll give you 10 dollars. He was actin like he was yawnin and put his arm behind me. When i tried to move he said does me touchin you make you uncomfortable. I didn't know what to say to him so I didn't say ne thing. Then He grabbed my arm. He wanted to see my key chains i didn't want him to cuz I knew he say somethin bout them. After about 10 minutes I let he see it. He was readin the one about smilin out loud and as soon as he said smile I started smilin like an idiot I had to turn away so he wouldn't see me. Then after he read the last one he said Janay do you think I'm ugly. It would be wrong to just say yea and if I said no he would take it the wrong way. So I said do you think you're ugly. He turned to Joy and was like Joy said that I told her he was cute. He said somethin bout doin somethin wit him after he graduated. I didn't know what he said so I said maybe. He said what you were supposed to say yes.  I actually made it to school before 8:00 i'm so proud of myself. I got some poptarts then went to Michelle's advisory. Her locker is right across from her advisory so we was there for a while. Then I went to mine. I had to help Stephanie wit the math homework.

      I was on time friday but wasn't today. But thats cuz the mechaines are 3 mintues early. I could have been to class but it was takin long cuz it was printin out late slips.  Advisory There was a spider so we kept movin out of our seats  1st period Just studied for our final. I forgot most of that stuff about introducin yourself and stuff  2nd period On the way to math Richard didn't notice mebut i was kinda far from him ne way. We did a project. I was kinda easy.  3rd period we gotta make a balance diet. ANd thats harder than I thought it was.Oh yea and every other week we have gym. So i'm in health this week. Travis kept stealin my food labels when I wasn't payin attention Then I took some from Roni and ashley. Then everybody just started takin stuff.  Lunch I went around askin people about the engilsh final. That was hard cuz first I had to think who had him 3rd period. Then I had to find them. And thast a hard thing to do at my school  5th period We were supposed to be studyin for our biology final but I was studyin for my English final.  6th period The final was easier than i thought it was gonna be. The part about Ceaser was hard cuz they were like trick questions  7 & 8th period When I was goin to class I seen my teacher and asked her if I could get my jacket. She said no. I said fuck you and went ne way. On the way back to class I seen Chuck. He was like whats up. I said hi. Then he said he was leavin. i was thinkin okay its already 7th period whats your point. Then I remembered what he was talkin bout. I said aww I'm gonna miss you. He said me too. We was sayin stuff. He was like I remember last year when we use to talk all the time. What happened why you stop talkin to me. I said I don't know.  I don't know why people always say that. I'm not the one thts stoppped to them. If they not payin attention to me I'm not goin go out of my way to say hi to them or to talk to them. Cuz if he really wanted to talk to me that bad or cared if i said somethin to him. Then he would say somethin to me himself. I didn't wanna stay and talk wit him cuz I knew I was bout to say somethin and I didn't wanna say ne thing mean to him when he was bout to leave. I saw my teacher bout to go in the classroom and Shariff was goning by so I said I gotta o and went with Sharif.  More people did their oral report things in class. And we did a work sheet

Naseer came back today and he just keeps getting weirder. Jenelle is bein weird right now too and she's talkin on the cell phone that her friend let her hold. I wanna know why she's on my bed looking at me. She just left to get water out the freezer. And I'm bored.   The power went out earlier and it had woke me up. It didn't stay off that long unless i fell  asleep and woke up when it came back on.  And now nelly is back. She just asked me what I'm doin and walked out my room.  She's back and she's practing writing her application. She's gonna try to be a medical assitant. She just asked me the difference between hardware and software. I tried to explain it buut i ain't that sure myself. Then wwe tried to figure out what would microsoft word count as or what u would call it.    I just heard Naseer singing alond wit the teena marie song. I got pictures of him wearin jenelle's high heel sandels and he's posin in them

      Sunday I went to my uncle’s house cuz they had a cook out. They had a dog in the back so I me and carm was playin wit that. She found they had a cat so she went to play wit that . One of the little boys that was there threw a bagel and it broke the window. I thought it was funny that a bagel broke the window but my uncle didn’t.   I came back from Carm’s house yesterday. And when I said I was gonna be with the bitch I didn’t mean her I meant her mom. Thrusday we went to penn’s landing to see a concert. I wrote what happened there in my other dairy thingy. Friday we went to South street. And I brought Marshall Mather’s LP.  Her cat Domino is evil and she thinks she owns the house. It got problems. It walks up to me and sniffs me then it walks down the hall turn around and hiss at me. Then she it was playin wit my hair and Sherelle said it was only using me. I played wit Mink  I have to go back cuz I left te memory card to my PS2 there. I let Sherelle hold my black one cuz she saved Knockout Kings on it and she had got real far on career mode. Carm’s didn’t have enough space. I told her don’t erase any of the NBA street stuff or NBA live. But I left my clear blue one over there and I got most of my games saved on that one.  I couldn’t keep comin back cuz I wouldn’t have a ride back. I got sherelle to take me to my dad house to feed my doggies. The always so hype. Allnite hurts when he jumps on you. I taught Huff to jump on the railing when he wants me to pet him. Allnitye can’t jump on the railing cuz he’s chained up in my dad’s room and Huff is chained up in the hallway. They always fight when they get to close to each other  Kim sent me an e-mail friday. It's the one where you have to figure out the the three words with gry in it. I 'm tired of that dumb thing cuz it never tells me the answer after I send it.  I have to go cuz my mom wants me to help her do something to the car. And I have to call Maleah cuz I told her I would tell her what kind of car it was when she got it.
