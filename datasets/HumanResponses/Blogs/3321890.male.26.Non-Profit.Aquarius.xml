      Sorry I forgot to put a lead in to this discussion. Basically, my cellphone is a peice of shit. I do not need a hundred set of options on it that I will never use. Had a discussion on this with a friend. The funniest part was that the leading manufacter(er?) does not allow them into their main office buildings. ha! Eventually got to the point of how the cell photo thing is causing problems. I pointed out that you cant use cell phones in locker rooms at the gym anymore.  Anyways.... : joker! : hey what is this photo bin address : www.phonebin.com : Wow! You were right - this is something you do want to look at while at work!! : uh... I think you have it backwards : Wait a minute, you are right. DAMN!!!

      Friday night I went home and hung out with some family friends. Had a great dinner and some pretty good conversation. My good for nothing whiney little runt of a brother wasn’t there so that was nice*. Anyways, went to the gym on Saturday and took an aerobics class. It was a fair class - I go to this instructor cause I expect more. Damn! There was this fine looking chick there...great voluptuous spandex wearing body - pretty face - didn’t act like a sissy during class / kept going when a lot of people punked out - ...did I mention during the inner thigh stretch that she could almost do the splits? Lust anyone? Anyways, she sets her step up next to mine. Overheard her talking swimming...so as class is finishing up I’m thinking wow I can talk/introduce myself and ask her about CS swimming pool opening (yes I know the answer – its just to get things going). Anyways, I look over at her and was about to say something to her and notice she has a ring on....unfuckinbelievable, I cannot believe I missed the ring! What the hell was I thinking? That is usually the first thing I look for. If they have a ring, they might as well be a dude. Anyways, doing the D-Strut, I’m like back away not today married lady....So, I finish working out, clean my place some and then gave my little brother his birthday present - Dave Chapelle CD 1 and some money - He seemed to appreciate it but I think he would have rather had Dave visit him and make his dreams come true**.  After hanging out with him for a while (like 4 minutes to be exact), I go up to my parents to work on the boat.... got it back together. Look of shock? Took it down to the water but had some problems. Couldn’t really figure out what was going on so I went home. My Dad, being the super nice guy that he is, figured out what it was. As least what he suspects. The impeller was in backwards and connections were not tightened down enough? So, it burnt it up the impeller. So, I have to order one of those.... Sunday I was so lazy - played the crap out of Hitman 2 and saw Shrek 2 with Kate. Pretty good movie. I wouldn’t pay to see it twice, but it was pretty good. May be I’m getting old, but it seemed to be a little more adult theme than the first one? After that, went home and prepared for the week. NOTES:  * whiney – Think of FB - boohoo! You didn’t get your props * little - well pretty much everything about him, well except his ego * runt - what? I wrote runt. ** see previous link - (Dave 'Tell all you little friends, that Dave Chapelle came to see ya and whipped up on that monkey ass!!')

      That's the key to happiness with females. DON'T GIVE A FUCK! That's right, if you go in trying to act like some smooth sophisticated playboy then you're gonna look like a dumb ass. If you go in with some goofy, happy go lucky "life of the party" routine and constantly try to impress some broad with your wit then you're gonna get annoying.... fast! Just go in and don't try to impress them with crap! Go in, be yourself and if they don't like it, FUCK THEM!!  That's my advice, you don't like it, go suck a dog dick.

      Had a hard time sleeping last night so I played Hitman 2 on the PS2 for a considerable amount of time. I saved the world. (FYI: Yes, saving the world is just as easy as everyone says it is. Then it occurred to me, why not do really save the world? Well, first I need to figure out what I would need to do this:  	 TO DO - Get fitted for 1 Hugo boss black suit 	 TO DO - Get 1 red tie 	 TO DO - 1 semiautomatic sniper rifle (several rounds) 	 DONE - list of people Okay, I’m just kidding…or am I? Anyways, (anyways, not a word? Sue me! Okay, I’m sorry! I didn’t mean to write that. Blow me! Ahh, that’s much better!) Eventually, after I saved the world, I started channel surfing. Since I only get public TV, I have a very limited selection. Infomercials were boring, so I started watching some of the reality dating shows…(BTW, these things are much more entertaining to watch with friends so you can call the freaks out!) So, I am watching this show and just start to feel bad for some of these people. It’s the typical scenario that I feel bad for – people that are trying to hard, freezing up, getting walked on, acting like fools, etc.! I don’t know if its self-respect related or not, but they are not acting like themselves. Instead they are acting completely ridiculous! I feel so bad for them that I feel compelled to change the channel…now, if finally occurred to me. I am changing the channel cause I see a little bit of myself in them. Wow, who would have thought, that one could learn about ones psyche from watching others. So bacially, I have acted like these people have (around certain female friends)! (Note: They probably wouldn’t admit we are friends. Probably, ‘don’t even know my name!’copyright Vincent.) The real tragedy is that I know I do this and I will continue to do this. I have tried to stop yet I do it anyways!! At least I can say these women don’t like me for who I am not (yeah, figure that sentence out.). I have tried to change and act suave and debonair. Yet, I have failed and probably will continue to fail miserably. (I guess now is as good as time as any, go back up to the title and say it with me....)

      I was in the bathroom and about to wash my hands when I noticed that I had a spot of something on my shirt. Out loud (yes - saying this out loud makes no sense!). Okay back to the story, out loud I say - 'What the hell is that?' I pick at my shirt, wash and dry my hands and walk out of the bathroom. Needless to say I got some strange looks from some of my co-workers that were in a meeting next to the bathroom......

      Well, my one friend has an answering machine message that makes it sound like he is answering the phone. Well, that was pretty cool and to be honest - he got me. I thought it was him. So, just for giggles I thought what the hell, why not answer the phone like an answering machine. So who is my first victim? Why not my self proclaimed Master of the Funk Indian (not native) Brother *. Anyways, he calls, I do my little schpeel and then he starts jabber jawing the typical message**. Well, instead of wishing me a happy birthday like some other 'bozos'. (bozo - what he thinks of most people. Im telling you, this guy is not a nice person.  Examples? Sure, how about the time he drove by a retirement home and yelled out 'fresh fish! fresh fish!' to all the new inductees or how about the time he taught that 'special' kid that giving the finger is nicer than waving. So for the rest of the summer the kid gave the finger to everybody passing by his house. Okay. Okay Im kidding he didnt do that. That was me. ) Anyways, back to the story, he says he is going to sing to me.  I almost blow my cover trying to hold back the laughter. Anyways, the point of this blog is like most blog entries it doesnt have one. However, isnt it better than than test 4 5 6? Okay youre right it isnt. Well, off to save the world.  Laters! Side Notes: * My own self proclaimed title - 'Lord of Natures Rubix Cube' -- (Natures Rubix Cube? Hello, The Clitoris. Duh!) ** typical message - something similar to this.... --  You got it goin on my man, I like how its goin down. --  You got the fly cars, the girls, the jewels . --  Look at that ring right there. --  I know its real its gotta be real. --  Man youre the flyest guy I seen in my life --  Yo man, I just wanna role with you --  How can I be down?

      Well, after converting almost all of my CDs to mpgs. Somebody mentioned how poor the mpg quality was. Something happened to the defaults and I wasted a substantial (and I do mean a lot) of time on low budget mpgs. Well, wearing some cheap Sony headphones at low volume - I couldn’t really tell the difference. Now, I took this music and played it in my dope, fly, super-supped-up, player hater ride. Surprise! Surprise! (Is that you Gomer?) I could hear clipping, noise, even some metronome ticking ( Okay somebody pulled out the wrap it up box - D.Chapellel) Besides being irate, I also vowed never to use that encoder anymore. I spent quite a bit of time investigating some rippers and came up with one that works top-notch (of course I would do this on a backup machine - since if there are a lot scratches on the disc, it will take forever.) Anyways, if any of you are going to rip some CDs, I highly recommend this program ( urlLink EAC - Exact Audio Copy - web page link ) if you have a backup machine.  Highlights  - Allows CD DRIVER extraction modification with C2 error correction (I have not seen any other app do this)  - Normalize all music so your not listening to one song at volume 10 and another at 3  - Can specify an external encoding program (recommend LAME with the VBR extreme preset)  - Uses the CDDB and you can customize filename and add both ID3v1 and ID3v2 to the mpg 		(can specify ID3v1.0 or ID3v1.1 - ID3v2.3 or ID3v2.4)  - Will generate a quality log. Yes, that’s right a log the status/possible errors of the songs.     ( urlLink Please check out this example text log )  - Its FREE and you don’t have to register the app or the encoding program. Downfalls  - System resources.... seems to gobble up app running time and memory.  - Time. If the disc is really scratched up the app will appear to be locked up. It isn’t. Just wait.  I highly recommend using this program if you don’t mind spending about 2 hours in downloading and setting up the defaults correctly. If you want a list of the suggested changes to the default values - email me.

      So apparently Iron Mike is back fighting again.  No, not in the ring:  he's fighting to pay off $38 million dollars in debt, including fees to the IRS and his ex-wife.  So apparently, while he was fighting, Mr. Tyson earned over $300 MILLION dollars in purses.  My question is: if you're worth over $300 million dollars... why not spend $299 million, and save just ONE million?!  I mean, how do you do that?!?  How, when you're worth $300 million, manage to blow $340 million???  Amazing.

      Well guys, I quite often get the question, "Sean, what's the biggest turn-off you've ever heard???"  And as of today, I have a  new  "biggest turn-off ever."  So there's this girl in one of my classes that, apparently, has a crush on me.  Which is fine.  Except, she's annoying, and overweight.  Like, grotesquely overweight.  You know, Orca fat.  But, I still try to be nice to her; she is human, after all (but barely).  Well, I'm walking to class today, and, unfortunately, she caught up to me and struck up a conversation.  And that's when it happened:  Cali: "Yeah, I need to start running again..." Sean: ( thinking to himself: 'Yeah, right, like you *ever* ran' ) "Yeah, I hear ya..." Cali: "Yeah, I used to run in High School for the Cross Country team..." Sean ( impressed ): "Oh really??" Cali: " Yeah, hehe... then I stopped, and promptly gained 35 pounds!!! " Sean ( looks to her in disgust, and gives her the 'gas face' ): "EW!"  OH MY GOD.  THIRTY-FIVE POUNDS.  honestly, WHO *BRAGS* about gaining 35 pounds?!!  Especially to a guy that you like?!!? My newest "biggest turn-off ever".  Thought you all might enjoy it.

       Got a list from Kate. No, not that kind of list, just a simple list of things to bring to the beach. You start reading it like so….    …..(a lot of items)         - sun screen         - Sand castle forms (for Radford to play with)         - Shovel (to help Radford with in the sand)         - swim suit     ….(several more items)     Now you get to the end and there is this note. May be its me.? Does this strike any of you as weird?     Note to self, need to fix list. Replace the word ‘play’ with the words ‘be distracted’ and the word ‘help’ with the word ‘bury’.

           Its not long, just 4 items.     - Some dumb ass rude arrogant prick who was totally interrupting the BC class last night is my first gripe. Even though I tried to make up for him, my cardio workout    was sub-par (probably also due to my gimp like limp – I guess I shouldn’t directly blame him – but shit I’m an Xer and it’s a lot easier to blame somebody else!). For somebody that was bragging about how he was a boxer from Chicago – Had a nice body, ripped and had some speed on his punches, but yet, I wasn’t impressed. He didn’t even last half the class, would come in and out and his form was by far the worst of anybodies. He would not shut his dick sucker up and his comments were neither funny nor amusing. (Wait, that’s a lie or may be a fib. If you consider that his comments made him look like an ass, then yes he was amusing.) He tried to be the center of attention the whole time – well, I must give him props cause he was until the very end of class when Lissa pretty much told him to stop talking ….Oh yeah, he’s on the list.        - The list. It never gets smaller. It has exceeded my other list. You know the one, the Vile Temptress Names of Women I Want to Sleep with list – That is pretty damn amazing!! So the list is now on the list! Does that mean everybody on the list gets double? Well then, I guess that’s bad news for Radford, Libby, TRoy, etc. etc.     - Speaking of Vile Temptresses – ( urlLink pdf link )  - Yeah, it’s a gripe!! I want her but I’ll never have her (lust anyone?), so it’s a gripe!         - Blogger update. I can never update my blog site! WTF? It seems like I have write these/post these things a thousand times. NO, they don’t get any better after I write them a second time. smart ass!

         What? I said runt! Surprisingly enough that refers to me…how you ask     Okay, so I have to drop a little previous knowledge. Last week I went running at lunch on the Blvd pulled something in my foot. I was about 1.5 miles out. Of course I ‘sacked up’ and finished the run (while biting a hole through my tongue/cheek. Okay not really but I was biting my tongue/cheeks pretty damn hard). Well, on Saturday, my brother and myself had to run to grab lunch (literally). I had to stop and slow down cause it was killing me. End of previous knowledge, start of last night. I go and help my brother set up a LAN with w98/wxp. It can be confusing, especially if you have Firewalls running and such. After we get done I sit around and chit chat with my folks. While I’m sitting there, my little brother chimes in with ‘I’m in such good shape, I went running with Lonnie this weekend and he apologized to me for slowing me down.’ Of course, I try to explain myself and he starts mocking me saying I’m trying to make excuses and such.     Yes, last night ended with me congratulating him under my breath, cause he made the list.

       Well my cousin inspired me. Here’s the gist, he hasn’t missed a scheduled workout day in 500+ days and is entering a contest in November. Its some local contest he said (Really, it sounded like a small town local contest.) Anyway, he is pretty confident that he’ll win his weight class but not the overall. I agree with his first and question his second prediction. Anyways, after I get back from the beach I need to turn it up a notch.

      Radford doesn’t have one on his page. What is he, a virgin web programmer?  Although, if he did have a comment page, I think I would start with…..what is up with you and mirrors? I think I can go on record with saying that at least once a week you mention something about being naked and admiring yourself in the mirror.....remember what happened to the woman in Seven?

      I have been working (like mad crazy!!) for the man, for the past week. Trying to get some stuff wrapped up before I go on vacation. Hopefully, after I get back vacation I’ll have some time to update this page and workout a little…. yeah, ya’ll can only hope!

      It would be nice if the sunscreen protection factors would multiply themselves? Like if I put on SPF 30 and then put on SPF 30, it would yield like SPF 900…. now that would be nice. BTW, I was wearing SPF 30 this weekend and got sunburned…

      No, were not talking about DMX’s CD. Rather, were talking about my  ‘castle in the sky’ , my  ‘stabbin’ hut’  (both copyright Radford). My air conditioner broke on Friday. Needless to say I woke up with a terrible headache and in a pool of sweat….fun! fun!

         One of the most taboo things to do (No you perverts!! I mean when a designer is adhering to the fundamental theories in the C programming language. ) is not to use the goto statement because you create spaghetti code (Another developer has an extremely difficult time debugging it cause it starts in several places ends in other one. Basically, the overall flow is extremely hard to follow cause you’re always jumping around all over the place).    Just for giggles I littered my code with it today.     Hooray for me!!

         In my car, I like to hear it from the stereo but not smell it from my car upholstery.        I guess I’m just weird.        One would think that the 100 different cologne samples (I got from the mall) hanging on the rear view mirror  would take care of this, but alas no dice!!

      My co-worker is wearing that shirt that REALLY high lights her double D chest again. Sigh... so much for being productive.
