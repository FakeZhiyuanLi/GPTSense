      Sweet, it's Wednesday, that means Spiderman2 comes out.  God this movie is going to be cool. I'll probably see it on Friday. Then I'm gonna go buy the game. GAH Spiderman is such a badass, I'm wearing a Spiderman T-shirt RIGHT NOW.  If you didn't like the first one, then screw you, quit reading my weblog.  As for movies, I'm going to see if Chronicles of Riddick is worth seeing by downloading and watching the prequel, Pitch Black. From what I hear, it kicks ass.  That's it for today.  -Reb

      After going into a severe coma after eating a bowl of Double Fudge Brownie Ice Cream, and then getting brutality -ercised by a treadmill and some 10lbs weights I think I feel fine now. It's about 12:45AM on Tuesday "morning"  and I'm about to hit the sack... bed.  How did Blogger manage to fuck up the two posts on "Saturday"?   So, here's Monday's post:  [MONDAY POST]Monday, ah... a start of another week of freedom.... Well, my last one until summer school starts.  I'll be taking Health. Four hours of health.. whoopdey damn do.  Well, my bathroom is done. It doesn't look too bad, either. I just need to build the shelf that will hang over my toilet.   Speaking of toilet, one word of advice: Never eat double fudge brownie icecream... EVER. Unless you have lots of patience and good magazines laying around.  -REB [END MONEY POST]  There you have it folks. Two days of posting in ONE post. Hope you enjoyed it.  -reb

      By early, I mean 1:33AM Eastern time.  Well yesterday me and my dad painted my bathroom, which is now a dark shade of blue. It actually looks like someone when apeshit on a smurf in there.  Today, we're going to put up a border between the blue paint and the white paint. It's a 50/50 mix, so the effect will be pretty sweet. Alas, when my dad was taking off the floorboard, he snapped a piece off. He's going to Jew it back into shape, but it's like "Damn dude, be careful next time."  I'm finally going to go all out on my diet. Screw this weblog, I'm going to shed some pounds before school starts.  -Reb, future GQ cover model.

      Last night I was over at my friend Scott's house with Brice. At around midnight, we loaded up a Faygo bottle with tin foil and toilet cleaner and made Drain-O bomb. We left it in the middle of the street and it blew up about 5 minutes later with a KABOOM.  Today I feel like crap. I'm tired, I smell and I can't really think straight, but I'm operating fine on the outside.  It's when I have to move or speak, I have trouble.   My dad and I are going to redo my bathroom. We're going to buy paint, and paint it, as well as clean it and install a new showerhead. Yay, maybe we can tape it and send it to This Old House. Or maybe it's This Olde House. Whatever, that guy on it is a beaver.  -Reb

      Today's Friday, which sucks for me and is a pot of gold for the working folks. What's that? Friday sucks for me?  Yes, because that means the weekend, which means my family will be hovering around the house, trying to get me to "do things" like laundry, trash, drugs etc...   I'm also lacking in typing ability, since I had to rewrite that last sentance about four times. (and this one about three).  I better quit posting daily, that would bring people to accept it and check in obsessively waiting to see what Reb posts next. They'd come to my site twice an hour everyday to see if I've updated, and if I haven't they'd send rutheless, violent e-mails forcing me to post out of self-pitty for neglecting my blog.   Cripes, I never knew something like this could be such a burden.  Late update- Things overheard at a gay wedding #04: "I'm not losing a son, I'm gaining a, uh... a son?" #07: "Can you zip me?"  -Reb

      Today is definately a slow news day. Nothing important has happened to me today. I've just been sittin on my ass, wishing I was doing something...  On a lighter note, I've started a new diet, which was going great until about an hour ago when I had dinner.   Throughout the day I ate (sparingly, mind you) celery, a peach, tuna and a hand full of marshmellows (the mini ones). So far so good... then comes dinner. I had a bowl of rice, stir fry and french fries (the ones you cook in the oven) and I've been regretting it ever since.   Tomorrow I might have to cut down on some of the eating, just to make of for today. Dammit!  -reb

      Hello, folks.  For the two of you that will actually ever read this, you can call me Reb.  I am free for idle chatting on AIM @ Rebelzeppelin or you can email me @ NIXED see above.  I will use this weblog to chart my summer vacation at home, and I'll occasionally post when I get bored.   Today, I drew a robot: http://img78.photobucket.com/albums/v239/jdbrewer/untitled.bmp  Check it out.  First post! woop woop!  BTW- I'm aware of the issue that the labels on the robot CANNOT be seen. I can't fix this, please deal with it, and blame photobucket.com for sucking.  -reb

      I actually beat the first Mega Man game(NES).  Wow, what a run, I can't believe I did it.  Anyway...  Health is half-way over. And it's almost Friday. Someone got caught smoking in the bathroom today, too.  Cripes, what a dumbass.  "I know, I'll smoke a cigarette in the bathroom... no one from 3 hallways down will be able to smell the SMOKE."  Idiot. I hope he's expelled.  -red

      Thank God it's almost Friday.  Last night I went to bed at 7PM, woke up at 6AM. Worst sleep of MY LIFE. Christ, it sucked. I tossed and turned all freggin night.  Summer school could be a lot worse. I'm getting a 91% in the class. You make think "hey not bad". BUT ITS EFFEN HEALTH.  Oh well, we watch at least one movie a day, and I only have 14 days of class left. It blows, because I'm always tired afterwards, and I feel like I've wasted my day -.-   Anyway...

      Boredom is never a reason to post. Unfortunately, that's exactly why I'm posting. It's raining, I still havem't seen Spiderman2 and I'm a lil' bit irritable.  I'm going to go trip out to Floyd.  Durp  -Reb

      WTF is wrong with me? I almost went a day without BLOGGERCISING!!!  Today sucked. Yesterday rocked. I downloaded and watched Pitch Black for the first time. It was great, I loved it. Then I watched Dark Fury, which is the anime that takes place RIGHT AFTER Pitch Black.  Wooo, so exciting. Make sure to visit www.rooneycom.net and get your $5 ***@rooneycom.net email. Supplies are unlimited, but hurry up regardless! Also, make sure to buy LOTS of RooneyCOM gear.  That's all for Thursday, which sucks, because Friday's are Hell! But I might see Spiderman2, if anyone will come with me.... >.  -Reb

      Check out these sexy new cars:  The Pontiac  urlLink  Solstice    And the Chrysler  urlLink Crossfire   Which one is better? Who knows but they are worlds better than  urlLink this hunk o' shit   BTW, in retrospect I think Pontiac made the Solstice to make up for the crapfest that was  urlLink THE AZTEK    Normally I would've saved and edited the pics of cars to say something hilarious, but this was a "I have a thought, let's share it" type of post.

      Today I woke up at around 11 0' clock.  From then until about 4PM I was helping my dad build my 2-year old nephews sandbox.  This isn't just a small sandbox... this is the biggest mf-ing sandbox EVER.  It's 12 x 12 and has  SIX   TONS  of sand in it. There's a four foot mound of sand in the middle.  I wish we had done this about ten years ago. My army men never really had a place to put the smack down on eachother.  I am one sad, and tired, panda.  ~Reb
