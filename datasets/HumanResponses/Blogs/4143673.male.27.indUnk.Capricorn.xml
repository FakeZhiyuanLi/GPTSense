      Wow! That is the word that best describes the adventure that I had this weekend. How do I find myself cramming in so much fun in so little time. I know that this doesn't really sound like a problem but how can one survive when you are constantly burning the candle on both ends. There wasn't a night this weekend that I went to bed before sunrise, except for Sunday night I guess, when I finally crawled back to my condo just before midnight. Well, I guess I will get to all the juicy details now. Just as a warning, I've added a lot of non-poker related stuff because I know some of my friends that are reading this could care less about that and want to hear more about the party.  Friday, my buddies picked me up around 3pm. and we were off on our big adventure. We made good time to Lake Charles, where we stopped at Isle of Capri and I picked up my $50 for stopping buy. I'm still in awe that they send me these coupons, as I haven't gambled there in almost a year and have probably done this sort of "hit and run" with there coupons for $200 or $300 dollars, but as long as they send them I'll pick up the free money. We then headed over to the other side of the Lake to Harrah's and proceeded to pick up another $115 there without placing a bet. We also stopped by the deli and picked up a muffulata, which was actually very good, but just as a warning these things are huge! 3 of us split one and we still had leftovers, this of course sparked the debate of "could just one person could eat the whole muffulata?", It didn't take long to solve this debate as my buddies just pointed out all of the immensely over weight people there and judging by the size of this sandwich it didn't take long to figure out how they got this way. We finished our sandwich and were back on the road with full bellies and the giddy feeling one could only get from all the coupon whoring we just did.  Next stop was an Albertson's just outside Baton Rouge, we decided that since Louisiana still allowed you to drink in the car that we needed to take full advantage of this law. We picked up enough booze to inebriate a small army and proceeded to do our best to drink it before we made it to N.O. We arrived to the Big Easy around 9pm and met the rest of our friends on Bourbon St. From here we continued our drinking binge and did the normal drinking, flirting and policy of just making asses of ourselves. Next stop, the poker tables at Harrah's.  I cruised into the Poker room, or should I say corner, at Harrah's around 3am and to my surprise it was still pretty full. I immediately sat down at a 3-6 table and realized just how drunk I was. I could barely tell the waitress that I would like a bottled water. I'm sure all the players were quite happy to see this drunk kid show up, especially when the first thing I did was raise the pot under the gun when I looked at my cards and saw KK. I got 4 or 5 callers as the details are a little blurry, and was really hoping that I didn't see that A on the flop as I knew someone would have me beat if it came. Well an ace did flop and I checked, the person to my immediate left bet and to my surprise everyone calls, this made it easy for me to call the $3 and hope for one of my two outs to hit. Well to my surprise, the turn was another King and I now had a nicely disguised pair of trips, after the turn I was all excited and figured I was going to try and check raise, as it was very likely one of the 5 players would bet, but it was checked around. I led out on the river and a got a couple of callers and picked up a nice $50 pot or so. So far everything was going great. I folded quite a bit after that and got burnt once playing 10,9 diamonds when the flush came and I ended up against KJ diamonds. This pretty much brought me back to even. I played til seven in the morning and finished the session down $8 as I really didn't catch much the rest of the night.  On a side note there was the hottest little Chinese girl sitting at our table, she looked like Lisa Ling or Lucy Lue, whichever one was in Charle's Angel's. She was from Houston too, and I swear she was flirting with me the whole time, but I was to chicken to ask for her number. I just thought it would be too cheesy to try and pick her up while I was playing poker, plus being all trashed I just didn't think it would be prudent to do anything stupid. Although I do run into her several more times throughout the weekend, for the rest of this report I'm just going to call her "Lucy Lue". By the way if "Lucy Lue" is reading this please write me, you know who you were.  After cards a couple of us decided to hit the Harrah's buffet, since it was going to be free and all. For everyone told me that the Buffet in New Orleans was good, you are all full of S#%T. This buffet sucked, as do most of Harrah's buffet's. Call me a food snob, but it really reminded me of food that I used to get in my grade school cafeteria. I had one of those fresh made omelets and it was ok but very greasy. On the way back to the hotel I could tell that the combination of grease and booze just wasn't going to sit right and barely made it back to the room in time to pray to the porcelain gods by offering up my stomach contents as a sacrifice. I passed out a little before 8:30 and didn't arise until 5:30 Saturday evening.  After awakening I made a few phone calls and located most of my friends. They were all at Harrah's, surprise, surprise. It's amazing that you can be in a town that has so much culture to offer and spend most of your time huddled over cards or yelling at dice. Fun, fun. We'll I headed over to Harrah's in time for round two of poker. I had a little wait for the 3-6 and ended up sitting at a 2-4 hold'em Omaha split game. I only sat for one had where I saw AK and took a small pot. I apologized for the hit and run, I really did feel bad about it and moved to my assigned 3-6 table. It was jammed in the back corner by the cashier and was really just a table where you could tell some manager said "maybe we can squeeze a table in over there and after doing the math they decided that it would work", this table was such a tight squeeze that if it was a turnip you could have gotten blood out of it. I never really got a hand except pocket queens and ended the session down about $25. I will describe one interesting hand in which I made a great call, honestly I was surprised I won the pot. I get dealt an A, 10 offsuit and four or five of us call I'm under the gun, the flop comes J, Q, Q. I check and it checks around, the turn is another J. I check and it checks around. The river is 7, with no flush possible. Well since it has been checked around I come out and bet $6. It folds around to the button. He re-raises me, which really caught me by surprise. My first thought was that he slowplayed the J or Q, but since he was on the button I was confused as why he would do that. I thought about it and there was no way he had the J or Q, Maybe he had AA or KK, but that was unlikely because he would have raised preflop. So I called. The guy had 3 pair, flipped over a 4, 7 off and must have thought his 3 pair beat my J's and Q's with an Ace kicker because he was kind of surprised he lost. I guess that's some of the fun of a 3-6 table.  I met up with my friend Casey and we headed over to Pat O'brians for dinner. It was about a 45 min wait for a table so we hung out at the bar and soaked in the sights. We ordered some hurricane's and some alligator bites, which were very delicious. We finally made it to our table and had the typical Pat O's dinner. I ordered the Crab Cakes and they were spicy but very good. Two things stuck out about this dinner, one was the guy that was passed out in the bathroom, his head hanging over a filthy toilet, and two which might of grossed some people out but didn't really bother us was the family of mice that lived in a tree maybe a foot from the table. They would scurry out and grab some food and then fun back to their house. The staff even saw them and just seemed to laugh. Only in New Orleans can you have mice at your table and not be bothered by it. After dinner it was off to Bourbon St. for another night of booze, boobs and mayhem.  Around 4 in the morning we decided we could take no more and headed off to Harrah's for another round of poker. I was seated at 3-6 table directly under the A/C vent for the entire Casino it seemed like. Cold air was just being pumped across this table. I toughed it out for as long as I could and laughed when one person grabbed his winnings and headed towards the gift shop for a sweatshirt. He later returned without the sweatshirt so I think he was just joking but it wasn't a bad idea. I asked for a table change and found myself sitting at the same table as "Lucy Lue". She was taking down pots right and left the night before but was really struggling tonight. She really liked to see the flop and would stay in with any pair or draw, I bet she saw 70 to 80 percent of the flops and probably showed down a third of her hands. She was always hitting the flush two pair or a straight the night before but the law of averages was catching up and she said she was stuck a couple of hundred tonight. We chatted quite a bit, sometimes even to the point where I think it was annoying the dealer as he would have to yell over us to say anything. It was really looking good to get her phone number but then her mom and brother showed up and wanted her to leave. She somehow talked her mom into heading back to the Hotel and her brother stayed and played cards. We still were very chatty but it really seemed that most of the flirting left when the brother showed up which is understandable. I did have one hand of note.  I was on the button and got pocket 4's. The pot get's raised up to six bucks and I call, the original better takes it up to nine and I would say 7 people called. This was a big pot and really wasn't normal for the way the table had been playing all night. The flop comes J, J, 7 and is checked to the middle where it is bet, raised and re-raised. Now all three of them can't have Jacks. "Lucy Lue" who was next to act calls and I called making five of us in the pot, the pot was so large I had to try and catch that 4. The turn to my amazement was a 4. The first three people were bet, raise, call, "Lucy Lue" folds and I re-raise my little boat. The first bettor folds the second better quickly re-raises to the cap. The caller thinks and folds, and it is to me. I look at him and thought about what he might have. He wasn't that good of a player but you have to think he had J, 7 for the full, well I mean it was such a big pot that I had to call and hope I was best. I really just didn't know, at one point I was thinking maybe he had Quads and I found myself hoping for a 4 on the river with dreams of the bad beat bonus. Just about that time the dealer flips over a 2 which gave me some relief as I just didn't think he had quads and how can you play (J7) (J4) or (J2), he checks, I probably should have checked but I bet and was expecting the check raise, but to my surprise he just called. He turns his hand over and has J, 6. How could he re-raise me with J, 6? I showed the boat and collected my monster. One person said J, 6 was what he layed down also, and the other person said they had Aces. I don't know what "Lucy Lue" had but this pot had me feeling good and I finished the session up almost $150. Finally hitting the sack around 7am.  Mixed with about $100 dollar profit on BJ, about a$70 loss on slots and the $215 in free money it was a good weekend. I spent a ton on booze and bought lunch for everyone on Sunday so I ended up about $150 poorer but I thought I was getting off cheap for as much fun as I had. We all piled in the car and headed back home along I-10. There were several delays for no reason but we got back to Houston around 11:00pm and I crawled up to my condo. I seriously thought about playing in a sit&amp;go but since I had to be at work in 7 hours I decided against it and hit the sack.  I'll keep everyone posted of my everything else that's going one I hope to play a few sit and go's this week but I really need to get some rest as between work and this weekend I'm really draging. Nothing a couple of Red Bull's can't fix I guess. Oh yes, I have booked my next big adventure. I'm heading to Vegas on the 17th of Sept. I'll be at the Rio so if anyone is going to be out there then let me know.

      So yesterday after work, I did what seems to be working best for me.  Knocking off a few of the lower level sit & go's.  Played in 5 of them and had two first's, a second, a third, and one DNP.  That is probably all the online poker that I will get to play for a couple of days since I will be taking off for New Orleans tomorrow.  I did run into one pleasently surprising situation while preparing for this trip.  I was looking through all of my Harrah's coupons and realized that I will be able to collect $215 in free money between all of my free cash coupons that Lake Charles and New Orleans has sent me.  For anyone that isn't using Harrah's comp program I really suggest you sign up.  They give me tons of stuff and I really haven't even gambled that much there lately.  I've really been trying to save some money, mainly because I think I might need to get a new car soon.  So I've been watching the expenses, and of course gambling is the first to go, but this trip should hopefully pay for itself.  As long as I don't gamble too much.  Our rooms are free, the free money should cover gas and food, and if I'm lucky the 3-6 table will be good to me too.  Well I've give you the trip update when I get back, but it should be a good weekend to blow off a little steam.

      Just one more thing that I wanted to add to my blog,  some of the books, ok the two that I have read.  The first book that I read was the obvious "Super System"  this one really created the foundation for how I play and is a must read for anyone that is interested in playing poker.  I've pretty much read the sections I've deemed relevent over and over for the last year, I seem to learn something new everytime I re-read a section.  It really makes you realise how much you still don't know about poker and tends to re-inforce the good concepts that you can sometimes forget and really helps me be patient and get over the bad beats that I seem to see.  I know everyone hates it but I have to get this one off my chest and I've found that reading about others bad beats make mine not seem so bad so I hope you all feel better at my expense.   I went all in, in a $10 sit & go with QQ when the board came Qc-X-2c,  I was a little afraid of the flush draw, that's why I was all-in, I get one caller and they flip over the cards. I'm up against 22.  I was very happy to see this as I thought for sure I would double up.  Well the turn is a blank but the river is a 2 giving him quad two's.  What can you do about that.  As Doyle would say, "It's just one of the hazzards of playing poker".  Well I wish I would stop running into so many hazzards.  But back to Supersystem,   I'm sure most anyone that found my blog would have found this book by now, but if you haven't go buy it, it will be the best $30 ever spent.   The other book that I have read and am currently re-reading is "Hold'em Poker for Advanced Players" by Sklansky and Malmuth.  I really enjoyed this book, although I don't really agree with how he catagorizes starting hands.  For limit play I find it very good but for tournaments I have my own personal ideas, kind of based on the ante and what I feel my expected return will be if I hit my hand.  I just adjust it out for the pot odds and my stack size and I feel much more comfortable with this.  The one area that I really enjoyed about this book is his section on wild games and loose games.  Sometimes I head down to Lake Charles in Louisiana and play at Harrah's.  It seems that most weekends this games are just crazy, with people capping the 3-6 at 12 bucks quite a bit and it's not uncommon to see some $200+ pots.  This is good if you are getting cards but really changes what you can play and this was an adjustment I struggled with the first time.  I think I've adjusted but haven't had a chance to test it yet.  But I do feel better prepared because of reading this book.  He also discusses several other advanced tactics that I've used to some success, but with everything I want to emphasize the some.   The next book I'm going to get is the Psychology of Poker.  I only need less then 100 FPP's on Pokerstars to order it for free from them.  And I don't know if this book will help me with my online play but it should be an interesting read and I will post one of my weak ass reviews on it when 1. I get enough FPP's to order it and 2. I read it.  Well my night shift is winding down and still have some administrative BS to take care of such as entering all my trades for the night.  I really hate doing that and hence put it off as long as possible.  Remember when all else fails procrastination usually works.  Well thanks for reading and I will try and write something tomorrow

      OK, I just wanted to intoduce myself here in this first blog, I'm basically your typical newbie online poker player.  I've been playing poker in all forms for most of my life but have just started recently playing online at Pokerstars.  I've played quite a bit lately trying to get in about 1,000 hands per day on my days off, which I have quite a few of, and decided to start this blog to track my play a little since I really don't use any poker tracking software or anything.  I started with $200 and am currently sitting around $70 despite having my account up to $500 severall times.   It seems as if every time I get my account up to that level I try to step up in level and get smacked around.  One time I did go on tilt after have 4 7's beat by 4 aces when I had 77 in the pocket and the flop came A77, the turn and river both produced aces to let a measly pair of Aces on the flop suck out on me.  I didn't go all in until after the turn which I still think was the right play on that, who ever thinks your going to get 4 7's beat anyway.  Well enough on the bad beats and more about who I am.   Back to that topic, I'm 27 and I am a real-time energy trader, that's just a fancy name for an overpaid grunt that has to work shift.  Oh, I used to work for that evil (really it wasn't evil but that's another issue altogether) energy trading company named Enron.  The one perk of this job is it will give me time to post, as I can use the down time to write down my thoughts,  since I can't play cards at work.  You know they might fire me for that, but I don't think they will care if I waste just as much time posting.  Other side notes about myself are that I used to wrestle for the University of Oregon,  I was third in the Pac-10 before I tore my ankle apart and had career ending surgery.  Thank god for that because it let me focus a little on school and get a real job that will afford me my trial lesson on poker.  I've been playing poker a little bit ever since highschool, but just recently started getting serious about it, and looking back I can't believe some of the hands I used to play.  The one cool thing I did was in college on a trip down to Vegas I bought a full set of chips from Paul-son.  They used to sell to the public, but from what I've heard they don't do that anymore.  What else can I tell you about myself.  I live in what looks and feels like a dorm room.  It's just a 500 square foot studio, but It's on the 23rd floor of a condo in downtown Houston and I love it.  I bought it so that's much cooler than renting, it's my first big purchase and I think I'm doing well on it, so that's another good thing.  And so many nights you can find me there high above the lights of Houston playing poker.  Another side note is since I got my job at another company doing the same thing, trading energy, all the folks there decided to call me peanut and that nickname has kind of stuck.  I think it is because of my small stature.  I'm only 5'2", so while you all dream of the "nuts", I dream of the "Peanuts".  Well let me rant and rave about what I have done so far on Pokerstars.  Basically, I started off playing some 1-2 limit but this was so boring and mindnumbing that I soon discovered the infamous sit&go.  I did really well at these and quickly was able to run my bankroll up over $500 for the first time.  after doing this I had grand dreams of buying one of those Herman Miller Aeron chairs, so my butt would be much more comfortable while playing more poker, but severall bad beats later, mostly playing .50 $1 no-limit I was back to just trying to not have to redeposit more money.  I'm still working on that chair and that will be my first purchase with any poker winnings.  Am I the only one that loses a ton of money on full houses.  That seems to be my cursed hand, having a full house and running into someone with a bigger full.  Even at casino's playing 3-6 I've lost a ton with those hands.  Another reason that I started this blog is that it seems as if none of my friends really care about my poker stories and I think some of them are quite fascinating.  Not just the bad beats or the amazing suckouts that I've seen, or even been the benefactor of sometimes, but mostly it seems as if I get unbeatable hands, beat by the turn and river, but enough about that, can you tell I'm bitter about some of them?  One story that people don't get is that you can meet some pretty cool girls through poker.  OK, honestly I haven't met any lately through my poker playing since most of it is done at my computer at home now, but I did meet my ex-girlfriend, we dated for 4 years on my way to a poker game.  That counts doesn't it.  Now most of them just think I'm crazy for playing cards and can't understand gambling at all.  Any thoughts on this topic?  Can you meet girls while playing poker?  So what's new for me.  My buddy Casey and I just booked our rooms for Harrah's in New Orleans.  I live in Houston TX, originally from Oregon, so heading over to New Orleans should be fun.  I've already been over there 2 times this year and am really looking forward to the vacation.  I am really going to focus on just playing poker, as a trip to the Casino can be an expensive one for me.   Last time I went to New Orleans I was stuck for $1600 before hitting a really hot streak around 4AM at the $100 table playing Black Jack and cashed for $4000, netting me a $2600 profit.  I bought these really cool painting while I was there so I really didn't take that much home but it was a blast.  And the good thing about this is that I'm now pretty much comped to whatever I want at Harrah's mostly due to dropping some large sums there after I got laid off.  I had a trip to Vegas that left me $3000 poorer and they seem to know they can count on me leaving a grand or so of my hard earned money, on any trip.  But at least my room is free.  So, I like to gamble, it's no secret, but this whole poker thing seems to have givin me a way to get my gambling fix and atleast not lose money.  Back to this whole weekend trip thing.  I'm really going to try not to lose to much at the tables, even though I know as I write this I'm not going to be able to avoid the tables all together, that lure of the big hit still is with me.  I think it all stems back to a big, and big to me is almost $10,000 win.  I've done it once but managed to dump most of it back over the next severall trips and I know that I'm probably down that much over my life, playing blackjack, but you never know maybe this trip will be it.  I highly doubt it as I'm going to try and limit myself to a couple of hundred bucks for BJ and a couple of hundred for poker and a couple hundred for fun.  I've got to save up because my same buddy Casey is getting married in the fall and his Bachelor party is in Vegas in September.  Thats going to be expensive I can tell already.  Well that's the first issue of the Peanuts, and I'll probably be on later to tell you about any poker that I play between now and this weekend, I hope that this was a good intro, I'm really not much of a writter but this was kind of fun.  You can e-mail me at  urlLink michaelmier118@yahoo.com .  Thanks,  Mike
