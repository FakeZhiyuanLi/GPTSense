       good jesus.  did anyone catch the license plate on that truck?  you know... the one that ran me over last night.  went to dragonfly with my roommate when he got back into town last night.  for those of you not from DC, or not familiar with dragonfly- it is a very swank, upscale lounge in midtown, and everything on the inside is bright white (quite a stunning visual effect, actually).  great martinis there.  and beers, and shots.  it struck me last night that there are certain bars where no one gets picked up and no one picks anyone up.  Maybe not entire bars, but definitely nights in certain bars.  We were upstairs, so I can't vouge for downstairs, but- it was nothing but groups of 2-8 beautiful people (and i mean, there were some truley gorgeous people in there) talking exclusively within their groups.  not once did we see a single instance of intra-group interaction.  very, very odd.  the yuppies were there to see and be seen last night, and little else.  we were there to get drunk.

       3:00 pm, back from the power lunch- Washington DC style.  Two hours of martinis and good food at the famed Old Ebbit Grill, my friends, it just doesn't get any better than that.  Lunch is merely an appetizer to happy hour in DC- God, I love this town!

       The Brittish Open is on today, and its shaping up to be a great tourney.  Tiger trying to capture the calendar Slam, Faldo has won two open championships on this course before ('92 and '86 I believe), Sergio won the Euro Amatuer here 4 years ago, and the field is packed with guys like Harrington and the Goose, who are just nasty on links courses.  It should be interesting this weekend when the wind is gusting at 45 mph and there is a steady rain.  I know its kind of foolish to bet on anyone but Tiger, but I couldn't resist Harrington at 28-1 and Faldo at 66-1.  Obviously not a safe bet, but I think the odds are better than the bookies are offering.  Also, watch out for Nicky Price who has been cruising along doing nothing spectacular and making top ten after top ten.  Nate's golf betting column will return in August for the PGA Championship...

       blogging is a lonely habbit.  you empty your soul onto the screen without any affirmation of your thoughts, or even confirmation that an audience has read them.  the allure must be cathartic- a knowlege that your message is not to please any readership, but only a reflection of your introspection.  perhaps that knowledge is affirmation, in and of itself.  if your blogging is a reflection of your instrospection, you   are   introspective- you   are   growing in a personal and real way.

       as i'm sitting here enjoying the bounties of mother earth (puff, puff, give), i cannot repress the thought that one of the great sitcoms of our generation has not only been cancelled, but is not even available in syndication.  I mean when I watch the spineless, soul-less, uninspired diatribe that frequents the primetime slots in todays society, i cannot help but vommit.  The show that has been lost like an intern's underwear at the Republican convention is...of course, Perfect Strangers.  You know..... Balki, and Co-sin Larry!  Get out of the city!  That show was   AMAZING!!!

       Another relaxing evening sitting at home, cause I'm too damn broke to go out.  If only I were an alcoholic, then I could choose going to a bar over paying the bills.  All of my problems would be solved!  I think the only acceptable thing to do is to get stoned and watch a movie, maybe play the harmonica.  WAIT!!! I don't own a harmonica!  Enough of this silliness, I have addictions to feed!

        EBAY DOES NOT HAVE LAWN DARTS!   I am outraged.  Luckily there are a few message boards where people have posted that they are selling complete sets.  And there's a company in England making a game called Yard Darts.  In any event, a set looks like its going to run me around $50 - $70, which isn't too bad, given their relative scarcity.  And, there is still a month and change left of this summer.  It looks like I'll be making another sound investment.  Does it occur to anyone else that you could make a splendid drinking game out of lawn darts- in the same vein as beer pong, but even more dangerous?  I'll investigate and let you know...

       it's a chicken or the egg debate of sorts... do i not feel like doing work today because i started writing in the damned blog?  or, did i already not feel like doing work, and the blog is replacing my usual outlets for boredom.  Either way, the die is cast, work is just going to have to take a back seat to everything else this afternoon.  i've decided that someone should have a bbq this weekend.  whatever happened to lawn darts?  does anyone still own a set?  can i get them on eBay?  its time to find out.

       how does one convey the personal importance of daily events in a medium like this?  a folder was just deleted off of a networked drive at my office.  does this mean anything to anyone out there?  does anyone care?  does it matter that there were months of work in that folder?  does it matter that the folder was backed up as recently as last night?  does it matter that i almost dry heaved in my trash can when i heard of its deletion because of the work that was represented in that folder?  certainly it does to me, all of that is important to me.  but why does it carry any relevance to anyone who would be reading this.  are our collective voyeristic tendencies strong enough to outweigh the fact that this information is completely and totally inconsequential?  apparently they are, and the blogging goes on.

       the novelty of blogging is getting in the way of me writing open, honest blogs.  I really feel like this is window dressing- the small talk at a cocktail party, chit chat on an elevator.  speaking of which, has anyone actually been to a cocktail party?  i picture aristocrats standing around in $5000 suits and beaded gowns sipping martinis- but maybe i'm off on this.  anyway, i think that once this becomes more of a habit (cause I don't have enough of those) the blogs will get better.  or maybe i just need to sip a few more martinis- bottoms up!

       Page not found.  technology.  it comprises so much of my daily life- all day on a computer, cell phone, palm- and yet it frustrates me to no end.  better to just dump it all? and then what would I complain about?

       ....and so it begins.  THE FIRST POST!  Well, I'm at work, waiting for a report to finish running.  Its occuring to me that perhaps I don't think enough to warrant my own blog- or maybe my thoughts just aren't original enough.  NOTE TO SELF: start smoking more pot.

       haven't blogged in many moons.  the weekend was a blur, too many drinks and drugs to count.  had a going-away party for my dan on friday that lasted from about 5:30 pm till 4 am.  good times...good times.  saturday, went with some friends to a couple of spots in Adams Morgan- more good times.  the weekend was also full of completely unspectacular, anti-climatic golf- despite my earlier predictions.  yes, there was a playoff, but 3 of the 4 golfers had recieved approximately 5 cumulative minutes of camera time before the playoff.  if els didn't win it, it was going to be a dissapointment.  if els did win, well, he beat a bunch of guys that no one knows.  rather forgettable, either way.    TIGER POSTED AN 81?  I was at Dan's house, after he left, hanging with his brother- getting focused and watching golf.  we tuned in, and couldn't figure out why they hadn't shown tiger yet, and then we were sure that we had just missed his name when they showed the leaderboard.  Alas, Tiger was 11 over- there was nothing that could be done.  To borrow a line from Brian Murphy- if tiger wants a grand slam this year, he better head to Denny's.  I wish that they had showed more of Monty's meltdown 84.  I really hate that guy, just uptight and whiny, and hates on everyone on the tour who gets more/better coverage in the media than he.  A NOTE TO COLIN MONTGOMERIE IF YOU ARE READING THIS: You will get more media coverage if you stop behaving like an asshole all the time.

       blogging is becoming a weekly thing.  in truth, i'm doing well to be putting any effort into this even on a weekly basis.  like almost everything else in my life, i got hot on this blog for about 5 minutes, put some effort into it, and then forgot about it - cut it loose.  will this turn into my weekend recap -  something to do on hazy monday afternoons, while i zone out, trying to remember which mindless task my job requires next of me?  god, i hope so.  football is about to kick off- maybe more blogging will occur then, although my guess is that more football watching will occur then, and my blogs will continue being weekend updates with the postlogue- "sunday I watched football".  it really is one of my favorite things though.  maybe you've experienced it too- maybe i'm just a freak, but my sundays during the football season go a little something like this...  waking up on a blustery sunday morning...shaking off the staggering side-effects of the addiction-du-jour to make a big pot of really spicy chili...checking the paper for the line while watching pregame analysis...juggling the third recievers and second running backs on my fantasy football team...clockin all the moves in all the games with a combination of skilled web surfing and deft channel-changing...calling/IM'ing similarly football-centric friends with the inevitable -"DID YOU SEE THAT??/CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT CALL??/this game sucks" exuberation/boredom...more juggling of the fantasy team- this time checking the waiver wire to see if ALL-STAR RUNNING BACK's replacement is still available, since that linebacker decided to pin his kneecap to the small of his back...going out for a beer or 13 and a dinner of hot wings and a desert of the 8:00 game on ESPN at the local watering hole.  The NFL- its FAAAAAAAN-tastic  (apologies to the NBA, and Bill Simmons).

       ok, now that we've gotten that out of the way.  i will have nothing interesting to say on here for at least 24 hours.  of course, i don't think any of this was very interesting to begin with.

       So that whole independent thing didn't work too well.  I lost my domain name because I was 1) broke and 2) lazy.  And well you know, blogging wasn't that important to me.    Well, my boy  urlLink Danno  told me he started a blog, and I started thinking - do I still have a blogspot account?  It turns out that yes, I do.  So I will keep posting here over the next days/weeks/till I get bored with it. Just to let you know...

       Just coming back to work from a long 4th of july weekend.  The boring, married suburbanities are yammering all around me about fireworks, pink lemonade, mom, god, and apple pie.  Blah.    My boss, and his boss, and his boss are all out of the office today.  That's a good thing.  It means I can comfortably put off any real work until after lunch.    My weekend was strong.  Party Friday night at my boy EF's joint in Bethesda.  Sat I went to see A Clockwork Orange at the Landmark E St.  Sun, I went to a party at Fatwood's casa.  And yesterday I went to see Spiderman 2.  Today, I still feel like the various toxins I poured into my body have not completely vacated.  A little hazy, a little mixed up in the head.  Comprehension is   s  l  o  w.  Coffee is the only thing that can make this morning right.  Need to get on that.
