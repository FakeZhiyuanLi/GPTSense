Husband was on-call last night, so he's asleep. I can't even go in my bedroom to use my pc (all my job apps/application forms are on there and I'm having to use my dad's pc. Its so naff!) Anyway just coz Im bored doesnt mean I should bore u all further! Ill keep you updated about who snogged who tonight at the big NBU night out!!

      Yes it is absolutely f-ing scorching here. It was pouring down when I got stopped (No, it wasn't Paul. Shame! So he's a proper cop now?) Less than and hour later it was absolutely boiling. Its well wierd. Shame you aren't here to go out with us tomorrow - Paul Gray might be out?!

       Rob (Tea boy to the stars, not Rob Ahearne) whats happened to your blog?? Are you out tomorrow night - we can have an official reunion when Po comes back. Although he might be sickeningly depressing about Love of Life Lisa?  Rashmi suggested I have a daily update but backwards. The only thing is I can't remember what i've done recently. Probably coz I aint done nowt that was worth mentioning. Except go out last Friday and join the rest of a bar to boo Misery Guts Jason, chant "Nadia Nadia Nadia" and clap (BB Marco's Harem seal style) when she won! Yaay.  I thought I'd write a bit about my annual trip to India a few months ago. I needed another holiday to recover....it was just random little things, like the day we landed in Gujarat (India), my sister-in-law said "oh the weather was fine but its suddenly really really hot today." Really hot being no less than 40 degrees. And I know you white ppl like to go brown, but us Indian girls want to somehow go white, or atleast not catch the sun too much!! We got By the time I got home, I was hugely tanned.       The next morning Im sitting under the fan and the power goes. To which my s-i-l says "Oh no, looks like they know Aarti's arrived. We haven't had a power cut for months. Nevermind it will be back soon." She was right. It did come back. 9 long hours, 7 long freezing cold showers and tonnes of icecream later.  That was a sign. As my s-i-l said, things like that only happen when Aarti gets to India. And they get worse....  So I'm trying to get used to the 40 deg heat - Husband decides we should go away, to a "hill station" (like a little town up the mountains where its colder, e.g. Aberdare is a hill station, as Rashmi's mother in law pointed out recently). I fell asleep in the car (the car which kept breaking down, therefore the AC stopped during 4 x 5-7 hour drives which then made me cry every 30mins!) Suddenly the driver skid to a halt. Looked up and a HUGE overloaded truck (of course, this is India) was coming right at us - there was a car infront of us, only a small 'Maruti' (like a the size of a little Uno). The truck hit that car face on and swerved hitting a guy on a motorbike next to us. I was screaming hysterically coz the driver of the car in front was still as. I couldnt even see the motorbike and the 2 guys jumped out of the truck and ran before they got battered. How frustrating that was I tell you.  There's always things like that happenening in India. When I got married in India a few years ago, my family all flew there and apart from me, everyone was involved in some sort of road incident!!   I've never in my life seen something so bad and I was so shakey.       Naturally I kept my eyes wide open for the rest of the drive(s) and just thought about how lucky I was (and I know this is selfish) that there had been a car in front of us, otherwise it would have been us the truck had hit.  Anyway I have a few more great things to mention about this one particular drive, but I'll babble about that tomorrow!! Oh oh I just came back from Cardiff and got stopped by cop. It was quite exciting sitting in his car you know! (My heart was sooo not thumping and my hands were so not shaking ok!)

       urlLink     Rich and Karen Tuckfield without me. Sorry, I know its an old photo before u mention it Owain! But it is the best photo I have of Hanner! Doesn't he look fab - are there any single young and available ladies I know? Email me!!! Karen looks fab too!  I shall have to take lots of photos on friday of the HBOS lot, at Anne Marie's leaving do. Unfortunately, my "real friend" Rob Ahearne won't be there, so I am going to have to post a photo of us bowling a few months ago. That reminds me Rob, I still have a roll of photos where we went bowling the day Elaine's team got split up! Anyway ladies - Rob is also single so you have a choice - Rich or Rob?!

       I just finished some more application forms - didn't take that long, was a copy & paste job. I hope I get a job soon - think I'll have to go to some agencies soon. Somehow, even though I am at home, I've missed neighbours, home &amp; away and eastenders recently! And I have no excuse, its not like I've had anything better to do.  Except last night we did go to the UCI to see...yes, an Indian fillum. Well I thought it was quite funny. Me and Rashmi were completely shocked - usually when we go to see an Indian film midweek, its just us 2 in the whole cinema (and both our Husbands of course!) Last night it was full of (this is a guess, but most likely to be correct) Indian MBA students! And how many hair transplants has 'the hero' SK had recently? He was practically hair less a few fillums ago - and urgh, did anyone else notice his piercings? As a Brit Im too embarrassed on his behalf to state which piercing - maybe he's 'confused' - quite likely, what with the sarong too!! And to think I wanted to marry him - his autograph was even up on my wall when i was little. Yuk.  Well I just had a phonecall from someone - he asked if "aarti is there" and then went on to say "oh i thought it was a little girl!" Sweet, thats me!! I was gonna stick a photo of me, Rich Hanner and Karan Tuckfield on today, but I decided as fab as they both looked, I looked grim, so I left me out. Such a waste. So sad.    Also is Cardiff the only place in the whole UK that is still completely scorching??? Everywhere else has flood alerts.

       urlLink     Aarti Beth and Donna, HBOS Ball      Sorry I cant find any more up to date nice photos. I shall have some soon, soon as I get them developed. I am going to put loads of photos on. Obviously at the same time I am filling in job application forms. Honest.    Its way too hot today. Not sure whats happened coz on the radio they're saying that almost all of the UK is flooded!! Who said crossing over the Severn Bridge to Wales meant rain, rain, rain?

       urlLink     HBOS Ball 2004      Mat - tallest blokey in the world. Owain - the welshest person I know. Mike - the coolest and nicest bloke who I've ever worked with!    My bestest friend Rashmi is thinking right now "wow, I didnt know Aarti owns photos which dont have her in them!" Yes its true, but not that many photos. I'm gonna have to stick to ball photos for now, until I finally get Rashmi's hen night and wedding photos developed.... i looked pretty, you know.... oh yea, Rashmi (the BRIDE) she looked pretty lush too!!!   I just had a call to say I didnt get the job. Makes sense really as i have no experience of designing websites or NHS claims or complaints procedures (only NBU complaints!!!) But I had positive feedback about my performance, the interviewer was ever so nice to me on the phone. So as far as 1st ever proper interviews go, I think I did well! (Apart from my random Cardiff accent which meant I occasionally forgot to pronounce my Ts and sounded  common ! I need to practise and perfect my Sully accent again!!)    Anyway I went to Macarthur Glen, got some chocolate from Thorntons - the man in there gave me my change, grabbed my hand and said "promise me you'll come back again!" I've been quite bored recently, so I'm thinking (no, im not thinking I should go see him again, although Thorntons is pretty nice!) I should perhaps tell someone. Not Husband, but perhaps my mum - she'd drive straight up there and scream at him. That would be amusing and will un-bore me for a few minutes?

       urlLink     There were 2 Indian princesses....Seema & Aarti      God I am bored. I cant think about the interview this afternoon coz it makes me feel ill. So I thought i'd practise posting more photos - in fact I might rename this from Blog to Phlog - photo log. What u think, O-wayne?  Dont be too cheeky, i have a photo of you to add later.

       urlLink        Its just taken another hour to figure out how to post photos (thanks Owain. Again). Thought I'd practise with a pic of my fav little baby cousin Mala - aint she the cutest?   It really was a bit of a lazy day - only a bit. I had more ironing to do (you'd think I'd have finished all of it when I was ironing for 7 hours, yes thats 7 hours, earlier this week. But then most of that was Husband's clothes, which makes sense really. An unemployed ex-housewife doesnt have much need to be creasefree dressed, well not as much need as an employed Doctor).    Anyway so I did some ironing and then prepared for the interview tomorrow. I got some good answers; "So Aarti, why should we hire you?" "Well mate, I'm like known for being real generous with sweets in HBOS - Marks and Spencer sweets mind!"    Anyway I have to decide what Im gonna wear first. Oh yes, as the interviews in Bridgend, Im gonna go shopping (either to celebrate or cheer myself, any excuse will do) in Macarthur Glen. There's a Cadburys shop there, that'll do...Wish me luck for tomorrow.

       Even with Owain's help it took me 10 minutes to get my photo on my profile. Easy, yearite. I'm still thinkin of interesting things to write about, but my mind just comes back to the threat He made last night "Aarti, you get a temp job by the end of the week, or else." I'm not quite sure what "or else" means - probably means I'm not allowed to spend any more of His ££. Oh Crap. As if I wasn't already worried about my job interview tomorrow, now I have to consider the fact that I won't be able/can't afford to go shopping next week when Im bored. What was the point in getting married I wonder.

       Hello! Ok, I'm just trying to get the hang of this (it is hard u know, especially without   urlLink  Owain    being online to help me right now!) And when I do get the hang of it, I have to think of what to write about - Im sure there's the odd 1 or 2 of u who wouldnt be interested in updates of Neighbours, Home &amp; Away, or even my favourite Indian channel programmes!! Taraa (sorry about the Text style abbrevs!)
