       Quote of the day: Caffeine is the blood of life.    I’m determined to post before midnight from now on so that I can not be confused by what the hell day I actually posted anymore.  It’s a small goal.  It’s all about the little things.  Forced myself to stay in bed….just stay there.  No tv, no computer, no reading or writing.  Just sleep.  I haven’t slept much since I got sick, and I guess with things being as they are the stressmonster didn’t allow a l whole lot of sleep before then.  I must get better so I can (a) get one of those things that people have….you know, a place they go every day and they are given money for tasks?  (b) send out queries (c) get the fuck out of my jammies, outta this house for a destination other than the hospital or pharmacy, and down to the beach.  I finally couldn’t take it anymore and bounced out of bed (okay, stumbled sort of Sanford style) and turned to my trusty laptop to relieve me of all the noise in my head.  The words just bouncing around and demanding to be free.  Persistent little fuckers they are, no?  “Take me to paper now or lose me forever!”  they shout.  Other little persistent elements of the day were Petie and Scrapper, my two fuzzikids.  Scrapper, the diva and older one, loves to play with Petie, the baby, for exactly a minute and a half.  After that she turns into satan.  He gets confused and tried to play anyway (he’s a little simple, but I love him for that)….then he gets a little pissed off at her drama and taunts her….then mommy must get in to the picture.  So there you find me, in bed, coughing disheveled and grumpy squirting a water pistol aimlessness around the room with still-closed eyes trying to find the satan noises and stop the madness.  They laugh at me and run in the living room where I cannot reach.  Once this game becomes old, they start in with the in depth complicated procedure of trying to get me out of bed.  Scrapper will run up, get in my face…nose to nose….lick my nose and meow.  Oh, cute girl  .  Then, she runs away.  THEN she come back.  Then, she runs away.  THEN, she comes back.  Etcetera ad nauseaum.  Meanwhile, Petie is playing Army Ranger with my feet and strategizing the best way to invade my toes.  Then, there’s the sounds.  You know the ones….in the other room…the creaking sounds of a cat on top of something that’s about to fall in, topple over, or break?  Or the ones where you know they’ve gotten into the garbage or stuck in a drawer.  (Petie thinks it’s funny to squish his big self into a skinny long bathroom drawer, so as he can sit behind it, and watch mommy turn purple.)  They really are outlandishly clever and terribly good at this game.  I’m up already dammit.  And you know what happened?  The minute I got up?  They went to SLEEP!  Look at me posting during actual daylight!  Wahoo!  I deserve a cookie.  Anyone got a cookie?

       Quote of the day:  Low carb orange juice?  Give me a fucking break!   Just when I’ve found a happy place to swim around in and have a martini, BLAM….the universe slaps a fucking post-it note on my forehead that says, “Not so fast sparky!”  After endless hours of coughing and coughing….too many powdered sugar doughnuts…no sleep… and nightmares of living in my car with the cats and a guy named Speedy, I realize, here I am again.  Why is it that we must constantly readjust our center?  Refocus?  Why is everything so mushy?  By this profound term I mean, not solid…in flux…moving?  Buddhist philosophy is based on the theory of impermanence, that everything in the universe is connected and everything is changing.  Damn, that pisses me off.  Buddhist philosophy has helped me refocus my life and find meaning in my pain.  It’s made me understand suffering and it’s purpose.  But, seriously, I’d like to get to a point where things are rolling along smoothly and stay there for 5 bloody minutes.  It’s like the hard the bad the mean the ugly has staying power.  The floaty the swimmy the happy the peaceful can’t be pinned down.  When things are dark and really bad, you have to ask for help.  You have to.  I mean, what is this shit that “oh he never complains!” or “I’d starve before asking for anything.”  I understand pride and independence.  But being a martyr does not help anyone be well rounded and complete.  Both sides are needed.  I am surrounded by the people that love to beat me down when things are dark.  As if I intentionally created the storm.  We are all human, and I really don’t believe in mistakes.  We do things unconsciously and have to examine why.  Things that seems like mistakes are really life lessons.  Well, not the, “fuck, I missed my exit” kind of mistakes.  At least not usually.  That hurts my head to think about, so I’ll move on.  I can’t make them all happy, and I must stop trying.  It’s a fact that they simply will not understand me, and that has to be okay.  In fact, it may be true that a rare few may understand me….after all I am a complicated, complex, sometimes high-maintenance, arteest who is often unpredictable.  I’m moody and have been through a hell of a lot for any one life time.  This stops people from getting through, I guess.  It certainly wouldn’t hurt me to learn how to keep that from showing up as all of me…the “real” me.    I’m finally realizing that it’s not about people liking me.  That’s not where it’s at.  I know that seems obvious, but I’m just now getting it.  I want people to like me and to be a good person, a good friend.  I want to learn how to be a better person, always.  It’s so important to me.  But, what I didn’t realize was that I was working so hard at getting approval and validation that I was sacrificing myself…my self esteem…the very things I was trying to obtain and make solid in the first place.  I have to be sensitive to other people’s feelings and polite.  It’s important to try not to impose on people and consider the other person’s position.  But at the end of the day I have to take care of me.  I have to do what I need to do to get the bills paid, food on the table, and all of my personal needs met.  How ridiculous is it to say that I’m just now figuring out what the phrase “it’s MY life” is all about?   I don’t have anyone to apologize to when I try and fail.  My choices and risks are mine, I own them no matter the outcome.  That’s the first brick I need to build a new life.  A new life here by the sea with the energy, my words, my new fresh pink soul, and the keys to my own destiny firmly (okay, sometimes shakily) in my grip.  Fuck that post-it note.  Sparky is here to stay.

      Even though I felt like I was going to die, my mind kept on racing.  As I drove home from the hospital, coughing and wheezing and completely miserable, I caught a glimpse of the tiny blue harbor lights on my left.  I sped down the freeway, rolling down the window to take in the sea air.  I breathed in, as deep as possible in my current condition, the smell and the texture of the air made it’s way to my center.  I settled back in the car, turned the radio up, let the wind blow through my hair and took it all in.  I felt damn good for someone who is “6-inches away from having pneumonia.”  The money, or substantial lack thereof, is of course a problem.  As soon as I’m a few more steps away from death warmed over, it’s solvable.  True, I have no furniture still.  Such is the case with many long distance moves.  True, I am living my ever challenging life on my own.  But that’s the bonus.  Knowing that I am doing it on my own…that I can do it on my own.  In spite of the numerous and considerable challenges I’ve faced in the last four years, I did it.  I made it.  I left Denver.  I’m back in San Diego and starting over.  In spite of the fact that my family is toxic and ridiculous and unsupportive.  In spite of my ability to attract toxic energy-sucking people into my life who don’t know the concept of give and take.  In spite of my family’s ability to beat me down and get me to forget all the things I’ve accomplished or overcome in my life….college, moving across country at 18 alone, serious illness, permanent injury, rape, working since I was 13, graduating high school early, a devastating earthquake, moving across country again alone, death of many friends and family.  How is it that we are so eager to believe the bad things people say about us?  My dear sweet friend, Danny, said something profound to me recently.  (Love to you CL)  He said, if there were 50 cable channels all devoted to you, 48 positive and 2 negative, which ones would you watch?  Sad to say, I knew I watch them all but I would focus on the 2 negative ones.  Why IS that?  We convince ourselves that these people who rarely, if ever, take risks know better than we do.  That their word is gospel.  They don’t know me.  They don’t know the way I live my life every day.  They don’t know that I’m the person in the grocery store that puts something back on the shelf after 50 people walked by.  They don’t know that I have rescued more animals than I can remember and placed them in good homes.  They don’t know that I write letters and lobby congress for better animal rights legislation.  They don’t know that even with a blinding migraine I talk to my best friend about whether or not she wants to get a divorce.  They don’t know that after thinking an offhand comment I made to a store clerk hurt a stranger’s feelings that I chased him down an outside mall in the snow to apologize.  They don’t know 100 other things I do that are good.  It’s not that they don’t ever see me or talk to me, but they don’t SEE.  They don’t pay attention.  They never have.  Yet they have the audacity to criticize me and I let it hurt me.  When someone does comment on my integrity or intellect or good character, I can always find a way to not let it count….not let it in.  They don’t know me well enough or they haven’t seen the other side of me.  How asinine is that?  The thing is, that maybe because I can be my true self with them…because they have no preconceived notion of me….that just maybe they DO see me.  The real me.  I wonder how many times I will have to have this conversation with myself for it to stick?  So my family thinks I’ve flipped my gidget.  They don’t know that that’s where the beauty is.  I’m a vegetarian Buddhist with a law degree and Irish catholic roots (even writing that makes me laugh).  They are fundamentalist Christians, good ole’ fashion Christians, Catholics and one Jew.  Having 6 parents does at least provide for variety.  They all took the “should” road.  You know…you “should” go to college and get married.  I have no issue with that if it’s a choice, but they all fell into what was expected of them.  Except for my Mom.  She fucked everybody up and got pregnant out of wedlock.  The “good” girl.  But then immediately proceeded along the “should” road again.  I have no problems with the way they live their lives except when it comes to judging how I live mine.  I want to LIVE it and stumble through and figure it out.  I may have a lawyer’s mind, but I have an artist’s heart.  The ever pounding, bleeding, bruised heart that feels, thinks, and emotes too much.  Or should I say “too” much.  Part of the juicy part of life is the hard part.  The pain feeds my soul and heart and life experience, thereby feeding my words, as much (or even unfortunately sometimes more) than the happy parts.  I’m sure I’m some kind of anomaly to them.  And you know, that’s okay.  I’m perfectly happy being unpredictable, that way people have to take the time to get to know me to figure me out.    True, it’s not perfect.  The uncertainty makes me sick.  Keeps me up at night.  Maybe that’s what drives me.  What a sick fucking conundrum is this?  The very thing that rips me up is also my passion.  At this point, I realized I have reasoned myself in circles.  I just need to focus on the energy pounding inside me.  The energy and vibe of this city just surrounds me.  The sound of the ocean.  The smell of the water.  That tiny center in me that stays still and certain inside the storm.  The sound of my fingers on the keyboard.  It’s all my grounding force.    I can sleep on that.

      I'm too blue and too angry and too distracted and too overwhelmed and too lonely.... behind...broke...hungry...sick...sad...irritated....frustrated...discouraged...pensive...and abandoned to write much today.  At least not in daylight hours.  Okay, daylight hours have passed, but it's not hardcore vampire time yet.  Do you ever feel like no matter what you do, you will never manage to make the life you want?  Become the person you want to be?  Or, no matter what you do or say...don't do or don't say...you will never be able to make "loved ones"...or even new people...see you for who you are?  What you have done in life, faced, accomplished, etc....instead of what you haven't?  Do you ever feel like it will never change?  You will never be happy?  Never feel loved?  That maybe you are not destined to be happy or loved?  Maybe not worthy of happy or being loved?

       "The best is a matter of standards - and I set my own standards.  I inherit nothing.  I stand at the end of no tradition.  I may, perhaps, stand at the beginning of one." -  unknown    Yes, that is totally irrelevant (the how now brown cow part).  I didn’t know what else to say.  Feeling a bit better today.  Coughing so hard I pulled a muscle in my NECK if you can believe that.  Got laundry done, which is   a good thing.  Jammies and sheets and pillowcases all downy soft and smelling good.  And, of course, Petie has plopped his little furry self right down in the middle of them.  Now, if we could just throw me in the washing machine.  I need to be washed and soft and smelling good.  Any one got a sponge? :::wink:::  I’ve realized how much I need to get out of the house.  There was this big spider in my light fixture in the kitchen.  I could see is little creepy silhouette above me in the plastic fixture.  Every time I went in the kitchen I checked to see if he was there.   My neighbor across the courtyard must have watched me through my balcony door looking up in the kitchen constantly and said…dayam, what’s the crazy girl doing now?  What freaked me out was when I went in there and he was GONE.  I hate those fucking things.  Hate them.   My Mom says, harm no living thing…except spiders and roaches and icky bugs we don’t know!  Bad Buddhist.  On a serious note, I love that quote above.  I set my own standards.  I stand at the end of no tradition.  I may, perhaps, stand at the beginning of one.  Brilliant.  My own tradition of taking risks, making mistakes, following my instincts and my heart.  My own tradition of being okay with bucking “tradition” and finding my own way.  Going against the grain.  I guess I probably don’t have to talk about this with anyone on the BN.  A bunch of nonconformists we are.  Excellent.    Yes, well, I’m about as funny or inspirational as a bottle of glue.  So, off I go to fold my laundry.

       “Even after all this time the sun never says to the Earth ‘you owe me’ – look  what happens with a love like that.  Lights up the whole world.” –  unknown    Haven’t written in a while.  Been caught up in the day to day.  Then I remember that the day to day is sometimes the most fascinating things we have to share with each other.  Went to the beach yesterday.  It’s amazing how the smallest things, even the near nothings, can make for the most brilliant day.  Winter here brings hazy sunshine and clouds almost every morning.  The haze spreads up from the beach, up over the bay and the harbor, until blue gray fingers of clouds turn into cloudless blue skies spread over miles of palm trees.  The smell of the water fills the air everywhere, even in the city.  You can feel it on your skin.  My hair always has this wild just-got-out-of-bed look with the perfect amount of curl.  Every morning, I open my eyes and am grateful that I’m here.  That I made it back to the city of my spirit.  Even when things are bad, it soothes me.  Life is in the little things.  That is said a lot, but I think we don’t really appreciate that truth enough.  Waking up on soft, white cotton sheets, with the breeze coming over the harbor into my window.  Little black kitty curled at my side.  My boy Petie.  Little long haired tabby princess curled on the floor, for some reason believing my Nike’s to be an immensely comfortable place to sleep.  My girl Scrapper.  The details of the morning bring comfort and solace.  Hot, milky Irish tea.   Fresh grapes and bananas.  Joss Stone, Etta James, Diana Krall or maybe even a little Metallica, depending on my mood.  Super cold, sweet and tart pomegranate/cherry juice.  My pink tongue it leaves behind.  The beautiful Spanish boy next door playing classical guitar.     Soft jammies, the paper, CNN on in the background.  The trick is to focus on the details that help evolve your positive disposition, not the fact that AOL has now charged my account twice for an account I never had thereby tying up money in my bank account….money which is monumentally scarce.  Those details tend to take over and can shift our focus from what we want to what we don’t.  I believe when you focus on avoiding what you don’t want, your energy is there so much that you create what you don’t want.  So, I rub Petie’s belly, schedule job interviews, make the most amazing ramen noodles with fresh veggies, spring onions, mushrooms…and remember that the best stories come from struggle.

      No quote today.  Haven’t been able to write much, not enough to post.  Written a letter or two to friends and some comments.  Things have been hectic, on top of a baby migraine.  Now, turning into a full blown bitch.  Dark rooms, stillness, no food, some tea.  Squinting at my lap top and existing by small radio or tv light.  Money is very bad, maybe worse than it’s ever been.  Waiting on a small reprieve coming in the mail – money from a rebate a million years ago.  My deposit from Denver will come to help with rent.  Literally no money left, last $2 went in the gas tank to get home.  It’s a daily prayer to keep lights and internet on.  Managed a good interview in spite of the pain.  After a while with these, you find a certain level of functionality.  At this point, I must halt my life and tend to the  pain.  Even with such obstacles, yesterday I was driving to the interview, not knowing if I would make it the 22 miles on an empty gas tank.  I realized I felt at peace.  I felt centered.  I knew that I would be taken care of, and that whatever happened was meant to be.  We deal with so much pain in our lives, once you accept that it is inevitable, that it will be a part of your life…maybe even more so than not…it’s much easier to deal with.  I accept it’s blessings.  I don’t like it, but it’s part of the yin and yang of the universe and necessary to maintain balance.  Balance within us, our lives, the universe as a whole.  I realized, as I was driving (now stuck in traffic on the way to the interview) that I was not panicked.  I thought to myself, “Is this it? Have I arrived at this place I’ve been seeking all these years?”  I dare not answer in the affirmative, except to say, that in this moment, I have achieved absolute peace.  Tranquility.  Serenity.  And wisdom about my journey.  This moment is really all we have.  I thought of you all in this moment.  How something I had said had reached you somehow.  That’s really the whole point of everything.  Someone to guide us as we walk the road of life.  Sometimes just a stranger in a coffee shop says something that makes you think or see things differently.  I held you all with me.  Sounds kind of strange, but on some level, you all know the real me better than a lot of people.  Most, I would say.  I have had so many unknowing teachers.  People who said something to me that I carried around, mulled over, and was able to apply to a situation.  Something small, or even really irrelevant to the exact issue I was concerned with.  I liked knowing that I could take someone to a place they wanted to go….the beach instead of the Canadian winter or to a thought about how the details of life are our blessings.  Thank you all for the wonderful feedback.  It’s both motivation to write and motivation in my life.  It allowed me to solidify my belief that the way to find what you are looking for, in yourself, and in life, is to put yourself out there…the real and true you.  Much to say about last few days, but it will have to be another time.  I have already pushed too hard and my body, and my mind, is demanding I attend to it.   First, I need to send my love to Danny.  You are in my thoughts. For now, I’m off.  If you need some inspiration, Sparky has the gummy bears.

       “Pilgrim on a journey…people will fail you, but life will never fail you.” –  billy cargo    Chilling out with Angie Stone filling the room.  Sorting out where I am.  Sleepy.  Spacey.  Quiet.  Mostly today, I am feeling sort of bored and melancholy.  This is the wonder of me.  Moods come and go like clouds, and in San Diego the clouds come an go a lot.  Often just hanging around, not making a statement.  Just there.  I am almost never bored.  Maybe it’s restless.  I feel like things are changing in my life in ways I’ve hoped for and I want to burst onto the scene, shake things up.  The day should have been warm, but felt cool to me.  I opted for laundry and slid soft lazy clothes, still warm from the dryer, on to my chilled body.  I have been drifting in and out of daydreams all day, unable to really focus.  Unsure what I need to focus on.  Forgetting to look at my calendar.  Scatterbrained.  That’s it.  Just an off day where nothing gets done and I forget that nothing got done until tomorrow when I have more to do.  Does anyone else have those days?  Maybe it’s hormonal, maybe it’s circumstantial, maybe it just is and will go away.  Maybe it’s all three.  I need a long hot bath, spearmint and chamomile tea, a good book and bed early.  Or early for me.  I quote billy cargo today because it seems to fit my mood, where my thoughts go.  I loved the comment he left with these words because they have this simple profoundness to them.  People will fail you.  I will fail them, and myself.  When you accept how imperfect we are all are, and how in our imperfections lies our growth and sometimes even our character, it allows you…or me…to take things less personally.  I see so much in those words, I wanted to share them.  I will allow them to be further up to your interpretation.  When I’m centered, it’s easy to remain focused.  Sometimes it’s searching for that grounding, that center, that holds your focus.  The search can be vast.  Reading those who’s unique perspective and tone touch you in some way, make you think, take you away, stir something inside you that brings inspiration or joy or laughter or passion.  Some of those people are here on the BN (I can’t get behind this Blogit thing yet)….I think some of you know who you are.  I don’t always post or leave comments, but I read a lot.  I love feeling like I have the perspective of all these wonderful people, artists, from all over the world, right here at my laptop.  Others are the Dali Lama, Sylvia Plath, or Anne Rice.  I lose myself in music and let my thoughts go back to what I want, who I am.  The way to find my focus is not through my head, I live there too much.  It’s through my senses.  The way hot water feels rushing over my skin.  The smell of coffee or the ocean or even my favorite perfume.  Some days you know that nothing will feel better today, that this day is just the way it is.  You learn what to do for yourself to come out of it, but feel grateful for the day anyway because it gave your mind and spirit and body a chance to relax and decompress.  I think that’s what’s wrong with this country sometimes.  No time to decompress.  The hormonal aspect never helps.  I’m starving to death and I have a headache.  I can NOT stop thinking about sex.  The boy, the aforementioned boy, is getting a lot of action in my head!  The beauty of the difficult moods, moments, frames of mind, etc. is that, as the Chinese say, “This too shall pass.”  Sometimes that is true when the good moments come too.  That’s why each moment is important, and to be grateful that all that the bad and good bring.  It’s so lovely to find the importance in all the things that happen in my life.  I’m most grateful for that today.  I promise to forgive myself for the days when I’m just out of it or angry or lost or feeling sorry for myself.  Tomorrow it will be sunny.  I have a job interview in the late afternoon.  The “sell out” job.  My friend, Trinity, tells me as I write this that I should be an advice columnist to pay the bills.  That could be fun.  And funny!  How that would happen, I have no idea.  I will take the sell out job if offered, and be happy having money again.  I will commit to my writing also and within 6 months or a year, quit said sell out job.  Tonight, I focus on what I remember I need to do and just letting it all be okay.  I sip sweet tea and chop up chives.  Petie decides he want to eat one.  He doesn’t normally like people food, and I don’t really feed them any, and he will not eat meat.  I wave the chive in front of his face and over his head, as he watches intently.  His little feet are kneading the counter as he plots his move.  He’s sitting down, but front paws are marching away.  Finally, he goes for it.  Chews on it.  Drops it.  Picks it up.  I look up a minute later, and he’s eaten the whole thing!  Now, he’s standing up eager eyes in my face asking for another one.  He ate that one too.  Won’t eat turkey, but will eat chives?  I shouldn’t be surprised.  Scrapper loves brussels’ sprouts.  As I write this she’s laying on her back with paws in the air, rolling back and forth, talking to me…apparently she has a long story about something she saw today.  Her tiny feet are so cute.  Little green blinking eyes looking at me knowing I don’t completely speak Cat and she doesn’t completely speak Human, but we understand each other.  Petie, at the moment, is on the back of my chair half standing on my head and one shoulder.  As if he gets final approval.  I got an email from an old, dear friend today.  I sent him a few installations of this blog, to which he responded how happy he was that people are getting to know me, the real me, the one he’s loved since the day we met more that 15 years ago.  There are no words at how happy I am that the universe provided me this gift while I was at a gloomy turn in my journey.  When it’s all said and done, how lucky am I?  To be able to find this center, this spiritual place, that allows my current perspective on life….to have the love of my fuzzy little darlings?  To have the love of dear friends?  To be able to appreciate these gifts even under difficult circumstances, even more so? To have the ability to find the words and put them out there?  In the big picture, I feel blessed and fortunate to have what I have, and be who I am.  Maybe next time I get nuts and rant about spiders and my family and whatever, it will be easier to forgive myself.    Remember when you were little and you wanted to run away?  I remember packing up my little suitcase covered in green cloth with little daisies on it.  I filled it with crackers and clean underwear and little books.  I planned my escape to the sea (I have always been infatuated with California – we were in New Mexico then).  I always fancied myself much more grown up than I was.  Even in my memories, I saw life like a grown up (or what I thought a grown up was).  I was going to go to the sea and find a new family.  One that were nicer to each other.  I brought a jacket, a stuffed dog, my skateboard, and a comb.  I don’t think a toothbrush occurred to me!  I also brought a bag of books (some things never change).  I couldn’t have been older than 6.  I stood at the door and said to my mom, “I’m leaving now.  I don’t think this is a good situation for any of us.”  I really said that.  “I believe it to be best.”  My mom barely looked up from her newspaper and said, “Alright then, be careful.”  I think at the time it was a ploy, not to make a big deal.  It became the pattern.  Nothing I did was a big deal.  I think I started running away in my mind then.  Ah….a blessing out of turmoil.  Imagine that?

       “When it is time for us to grow we get restless. When it is time for us to move forward we get tense.  When the time comes for us to let go of the things we know are holding us back all hell breaks loose.”   Iyanla    Well, the parents left this morning.  Last night did not go very well, and I’m not even sure why.  Tension, miscommunication.  It seems as though they dismiss everything about me:  my beliefs, my spirituality, my needs.  It’s more severe than just a lack of acceptance, it’s flat out dismissal and disregard.  I’ve been on my own since I was a teenager and taking care of myself way before I left home.  It’s hard now to be an adult and realize that what you rebelled against as a kid was really what you wanted, deep in your heart, acceptance and approval.  I know I will never get it.  I am too much of a risk taker, too much of an explorer to ever be understood or approved of by this man, and for that matter, the rest of my family.  So when will I let it go?  When will I realize, in the deepest part of my soul and far recesses of my psyche, that it is what it is and it’s their problem, not mine?  I wonder if ever.  Some days I feel like I’m there.  Some days I can’t see it from here.  Like today.  I’m so washed out and lost.     Drained really.  I have finally come to a place in my life where talking to him and seeing him does not completely beat me down and set me back.    Today I am grateful for sweet friends, real and virtual, who support me and lift me up as I stumble through this journey.  I am grateful for having the gift of seeing the beauty in life and in people, even when those people are very different from me and life is bringing me challenges.  I am grateful for still being able to live my life and nourish my soul after so many difficult experiences.  I am even grateful for those experiences and challenges because they have made me a better, more spiritual, less judgmental, and more loving person.  I like who I am.  I love who I’ve become.  I guess it is really the loss of my family if they can’t see and experience that.  I am so very grateful for Petie’s endless fuzzy kisses and Scrapper’s little wet kisses on the nose.  I have the softest nose in town!  (Should I make that a bumper sticker?)  I am grateful for pear scented candles, the honeysuckle in the air, and soft vanilla incense.  I am grateful for Buddha and that his journey makes it easier for me to walk in mine.  I carry with me the souls of those who loved me but could not stay on this plane, and I am eternally grateful that they found me fit enough to spend some years with.  I savor the moment of peppermint tea and honey as the sun finally breaks through the oppressive fluffy gray clouds.  I am grateful for sleep and quiet time and the words of those who have been through more and have much to show me.  I am an open person, an open soul.  I know I have much to learn, and much to show and teach to others.  It all has a purpose.  It’s all on purpose.  Living life on purpose.  Making the choices, walking your path, following your dreams and aspirations – whatever they may be and whatever others may think.  I’m grateful for the ocean, for vanilla orchids, sterling roses (my absolute favorite), daisies, my dark jeans and brand new tennies.  Today, salvation comes in the smallest of details…that the remote control has mute...that it’s cool enough for the windows to be open….that I could sleep and rest my soul…sweet iced tea…a job interview…raspberry lip gloss…mandarin oranges…that I don’t have a migraine…being touched by a movie that moved me…Norah Jones.  When things are so complicated and you are walking up hill, the focus becomes simpler…closer to home.  A reminder of the fact that it could always be worse, and everything has a purpose.  I’m grateful for my imagination.  I try to get out of my head and interact with people in the flesh more.  My imagination is where I play, where I create, no matter what the mood.  I can reinvent myself, again and again.  Create the life I want, the home I plan to live in, the man I plan to give my life to.  I can simply create a day down by the water, the rhythm of the ocean soothing me and bringing comfort.  I can visit the boy.  You know the one.  He doesn’t know you’ve noticed him.  You’ve never met him.  You know only a little about him.  Yet, something about him moves you, touches you, feels like home.  I imagine conversations with him laying on the floor watching the cats play.  I see him at the table with me, telling me about his day, and me being very impressed (this is always the case even if he told me he just washed the car, because it is him that impresses me).  My heart races just at the thought of him.  He talks, I cannot help but be involved.  His hands on my skin, the sound of his voice, his joy at my presence.  He has no idea I feel this way, but the love story in my imagination is full blown.  This is a gift.  It’s a safe place where I can go to feel loved and I can let it run away in my mind.  He is a real man, not fictitious.  He is far away.  He knows who he is.  I imagine showing up at his door one day, as a surprise, bringing with me a great bottle of wine and a true desire to know who him.  What moves him, what makes him sad, what fears and sadness he can’t let go of, what makes him happy, what makes him smile.  I am so very lucky to have the ability to create whole lifetimes and people and happy situations in my overworked little mind.  This allows me to put it out there.  My intention.     I intend to always focus on life’s details and let the journey provide my greatest opportunity for growth and happiness.  I intend to be happy and accept myself, no matter what my family decides to do.  I intend to surround myself with great people who are loving, positive, supportive, funny, and open-minded, and live in a home where I have them often that is open and warm and safe and colorful.  I intend to always be crazy.  I intend to always have and help and speak out for animals, even when people think I am a pain in the ass.  I intend to always be a pain in the ass.  I intend to be opinionated, complex, simple (it’s true), loving, empathetic, sensual, funny, and outgoing.  I intend to always be an advocate for people in difficult situations that cannot speak for themselves.  I intend to find a way to let what drives me…my passion and color…find a way to bring in the money.  I intend to always be a true friend by telling the truth, being supportive in big and little ways, making them laugh, understanding without judgment but holding them up to their possibilities.  And I intend to love this man.  It may not be the above man, because I don’t know what life holds.  I will be his friend, his lover, his wife, his cheerleader.  I will not judge him.  I will not criticize.  I will kiss him and touch him and love him for the rest of my life.  Yes, there will be lots of kissing.  I love kissing.  These are intentions.  They create my vision.  My vision drives me to action.  I know it will not be perfect, meaning without difficulties.  To me, perfect is in overcoming the difficulties and learning why they were presented to you in the first place.  The lessons.  The growth and products of the lessons.  I know I will not always live up to my own expectations.  I will try to be gentle with myself.  I also know that I will never let anyone, ever again, take away the lessons I’ve learned and the peace I’ve found…the person I’ve become.  That is the most important intention of all. Tonight, I found my lost sock.  I regained my power.  I settle in with the fuzzikids and read.  As I fall asleep I will smile as I create the life I am striving for in my mind.  I will smile as I think about this boy, far away, not knowing…maybe never knowing…that he’s part of my thoughts.

       “Beauty is truth, truth beauty' - that is all ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” -  John Keats    The common misconception about San Diego is that it is always sunny.  In reality there are more sunny days in Denver than here.  I actually love it.  It allows for more colors, more perspective, more of a range of emotion and experience.  The picture of the day.  The photograph it leaves in my mind.  The words that are written as I walk through my day, drinking in the perspective and the texture like a deep, warm, red wine.  Slowly, with purpose.  This morning started with blackberry and banana pancakes.  Fluffy goodness with rich, sweet real maple syrup that melts on your tongue and lingers on your lips and fingertips. Big bowls of fresh strawberries, blueberries, grapes, bananas, honey dew melon, and oranges.  The aroma of rich café mocha with Mexican chocolate and homemade whipped cream wafts up to tickle my nose, and the hot, sweet liquid brings my sludgy mind to slow wakefulness.  I sit in the noisy, eclectic café down in Mission Beach among the hung over 20-somethings, the married and “I-never-get-out-anymore” 30-somethings (and a few on up), and my parents.  Sifting through papers, trading sections, talking about the hockey game (yes, my team lost to the Leafs….thank you beedle :P ) and what basketball game was on that afternoon.  Again, Eileen was flirting with the waiter…   go the blue eyes, while my father seemed immersed in finding out where in the Pacific the basketball team called Pacific was from (Forest Grove, Oregon).  She’s a people person.  It’s amazing she hasn’t found me a husband that way.  It’s good we don’t live in the same city.  Maybe.  Beautiful men, and women, surround me everywhere.  As if the universe felt that the scenery was to perfect, too harmonious, too picturesque not to pepper it with people who looked as if they were carved out of cheesecake.  Big talk of what to do for the day and all the sights we wanted to see, turned into lazy meandering through the charming beach city filled with small outside cafes, swimwear, surf shops and restaurants.  The personalized and slightly weathered feel of virtually each home and small business makes things feel homey and warm.  Every type of person and grouping of people, docks, bikes, scooters on sidewalks and boardwalks bustle by on sidewalks and boardwalks.  This is a special occasion, this visit of my parents.  It is there wedding anniversary celebration (early a bit).  32 years.  Can you imagine?  They giggle and play, and my father is the man Eileen flirts with the most.  Since I do have three sets of parents, I should be calling him Barrie to prevent confusion later on.  But if you are ever confused about which “dad” or “mom” I mean, you will be like a close friend.  That’s how it is.  So, on this special occasion we bring them to a special place.  Since Eileen feels like I do about the beach, she’s a sun-worshipper and I’m an ocean-worshipper, my dad has booked them in the most amazing beach side hotel.  They arrived yesterday, but had to stay elsewhere due a reservation snafu.  The good thing about this is they got an upgrade to a large ocean view suite.  The plan was to check them in, see the room, and figure out what else we wanted to do…sites we wanted to see…hang out until evening when we had reservations.  Ever notice how when family or friends come, or when we go on holiday, everything revolves around food?  Eileen got one look at the beach view from the master bedroom, from the master bed, and from the living room…the Jacuzzi tub…and all the little essentials that make for a romantic getaway, and I was being ushered out of the room with instructions to make the dinner reservations for later than originally planned.  They gave reasons.  I didn’t push it.  As evening fell, the sky was magnificent.  I had noticed during the day, how the shades of blue, gray, blue-gray and white had all come together at the horizon to look as if they met, blended into one.  The sea had taken on this magical misty gray that was just slightly darker than that of the sky.  It blended as if the artist had taken the wet brush and ran it across the sky to marry the colors together.  It’s vastness compelled me to wonder if that was the point, in fact, that there was no end.  No beginning.  That it was all connected, sea and sky, in infinite wonder and glory.  The caps of the waves took on new meaning in the seascape.  A burst of energy and power, frothing down to tiny bubbles over the tender and submissive sand.  The chill did not dissuade true beach lovers from frolicking in the water…throwing the frisbee to the dog who bounded into the shallow break to retrieve it with great glee…the amorous couples walking hand in hand, smiling as though someone had just confided in them the answers to the mysteries of the universe.  The night grew darker, and the inky ocean became infinite, mysterious, as if there was a small question as to whether it were really there at all.  The only evidence was the crashing of the waves and the pop of white that would show itself.  The Pacific Beach pier seemed to be resting on air and the blue and while lights twinkling on it’s great wooden railing seemed to be stars, somehow too close.    I pulled up to the hotel and saw my father standing outside.  He flagged me down and got in, explaining that he wanted to let me park in the garage of the hotel.  We waited in the lobby for Eileen to come down examining the vanilla orchids and intricate decoration.  As we sat, my father began to explain to me how he was doing with his situation.  What the radiation was doing to his body.  The extreme pain he felt at certain times of the day.  How limited his options are should it come back.  I fidgeted in my seat, partially from my own discomfort at the conversation topic and partially from his difficulty in expressing himself.  My eyes shifted from him, to my feet, to the door.  I said the proper words, telling him I understood, but with out the proper sentiment and emotion.  I looked at him, my father, who did not raise me, but was always a large presence in my mind.  My constant need for his approval and validation and understanding has been a running theme since I was a child.  Now, he looked so frail and vulnerable to me.  He would not like to hear that, and does not feel that, I’m sure.  He folded and unfolded his hands as he spoke, and tried to find the right words.  I was relieved when Eileen came down and it was time to leave.  I cannot wrap my mind around this situation.  All these years of anger and harsh words…of absence from each other’s lives…of blame and judgment.  I have not gotten over that.  I realize now that it can’t be fixed, and do my best to let it go so that the next group of years are not filled with the same.  I believe it will always exist as a part of me.  A part of me that feels angry and sad that my father never opened himself up to really know me, know my pain and struggles, my joy, my contributions, my effort.  A part of me that knows that I will not have him much longer, even possibly for much less time than I thought, and he never will accept and appreciate me for who I am.  The whole person.  I cannot find the ways to deal with this yet, maybe I won’t.  As I write these words now, the tapping of my fingers on the keyboard is accompanied by tears.  Tears for his pain,  my loss, and my inability to solve that problem within myself.  After a long walk down a mostly quiet boardwalk, we sit down to dinner in a patio encased in glass and topped with small blue lights.  The heat lamps are too warm, but the ocean stretches out in front of us doing its nightly work, so the rest is just details.  The fish is fresh, the martinis cold, and the conversation spicy and lively.  At some point, we begin to hit the hot button issues.  The ones you know you should stay away from, but inevitably from time to time you cannot resist.  I realize that my father will never understand or accept my politics and spiritual beliefs.  I accept that is the way it is.  However, it doesn’t stop there.  There is always some attempt to convert me into something he finds acceptable.  I am fidgeting with my martini glass, which is now warm, and biting my tongue.  I remember the father who has cancer.  Who is in pain.  I try to express to him my views on the particular issues and my emotional attachment, or actual attachment (or both), to him.  His rejection of this and the words he chooses sear my outwardly cool demeanor, and I begin to snap.  I remember the sandollar.  I excuse myself and take a walk.  Upon returning, we shift to another topic and manage to salvage the evening.  When we get back to the hotel, Eileen says they will go up and talk to me tomorrow because they are very tired.  I’m about to say this is fine, when my dad says that he will walk to my car with me and make sure I get out okay.  I kiss Eileen good-bye and head with my dad towards the garage.  He is walking a bit in front of me, and I notice he is limping.  He is clearly in pain.  His face shows the sign of exhaustion.  In that instant, I forgive him.  Not for everything, but for tonight.  That is enough to move forward.

       “It’s never to late to be what you would have been.” –  George Eliot     Kettle screams out.  Steamy hot water swirls the tea around in the cup.  Peppermint, Spearmint, Chamomile all rise up to greet me.  I watch the honey melt off of my spoon into my cup.  I sit down in my big purple chair to contemplate the evening holding the big cobalt blue mug between my open hands, holding tight to warm my fingers.  As I sip the tea, the warm washes through me.  Like liquid solace.  Have you ever been walking through your life, doing the day to day or working, whatever…and this voice whispers something to you?  Deep inside.  In your soul.  Your spirit.  Maybe an instinct, maybe the universe giving you a clue.  Something so real and basic, you know it’s true, but you don’t acknowledge it out loud, or even to yourself for too long, because it’s best not to speak it.  It’s best to just create it.  Make it happen.  The Great Spirit says, when the voice tells you what is true, only whisper it on the wind.  Those who are jealous or unsettled will want to tear you down.  Once you hear that voice of opposition, you might let it drown out your own voice.  You can make it more powerful…make it louder…until it you let it tear you down and destroy your vision.  That happens to me a lot, that whisper.  I think it always has, but I think I’m just now starting to hear it.  Thank the goddess for that one.  Tonight, I was making my tea….warm and safe at home…hopeful about the direction I’m taking.  I was writing, and chatting with a friend online.  The voice came to me, “This is your life.”  It’s that simple.  This feeling, this direction, this activity….that is my life, where it is going, how I will make it.  I can’t explain that in more depth for the simple reason that it’s intangible, but my spirit recognizes the statement and agrees.  I sip my tea and let the warmth of it and these thoughts fill me up.  I lean back in the chair and let Sweetback take me away.  The music dances over my skin, flows through me, surrounds me like a blanket and lifts me up to a place where it all seems to be coming together.  I narrate my life everyday.  As I walk through the world, I write it in my head.  What I see, what I smell, what I’m thinking.  All the tangibles and the intangibles.  When the music comes, it needs to be my soundtrack.  It always calls to me like a friend, providing the audio component to my experience.  I stood there tonight, looking over the vast ocean in it’s inky blue blackness.... fluorescent white foamy caps breaking and splaying over the rocks and the sand.  The sound of the ocean beating against the cliff and rocks was so loud, I couldn’t hear anything else even though I was high above.  I watched the sea water slam into the cove, meander inside to the utter darkness and flow somewhat slowly out the other side, only to be sucked in and pulled back out by the tide.  It seemed to be in a huge hurry to go nowhere.  At times I relate to that.  The haze from the ocean’s misty kisses covered all the windows and cars and air everywhere.  It was as if I looked at the scene through nylon, like they shoot the beautiful actresses through when they want them to be unbearably beautiful and glamorous.  The night was just chilly enough for a light jacket, but not too chilly that wandering up and down the coast wasn’t pleasurable.  The night breeze lifted the moist ocean air over me and through my hair.  I breathed deeply, taking it in, as if I could breathe in the ocean.  It soothes me.  Has conversations with my soul.  My spirit.  I don’t know how, but this brings me center.    My Mom joins me this night.  Eileen and my biological father are in visiting this weekend. I have 3 sets of parents (therefore 3 moms), so for simplicity’s sake we will use her name, Eileen.  She tells me that walking on the beach that day, she found a sandollar.  You don’t find sandollars or shells much on pacific coast beaches.  She said it was a sign.  A sign that this weekend would go smoothly and we would be a family and have a peaceful weekend.  As I look away from the water breaking on the rocks below, I realize she has tears in her eyes.  I have had some issues that have seemed to be beyond resolve with my father and Eileen.  I still don’t know if they are resolvable.  In this magic moment standing next to the water, it seems we may have found some common ground.  I explain to her that it hurts me when they say what they say without proper information.  When they don’t realize how hard I work, how much I’ve accomplished.  When they don’t see me, how I really am.  She seems to understand in her facial expressions and gestures, that maybe there is a gap here.  That maybe they don’t really have all the facts.  That maybe even if they did, it’s not their place to judge a situation they have no familiarity with.  She tells me she just wants to be a family….good, bad, and indifferent.  I smile at that.    We walk back up the many steps to the restaurant where we proceed to have a fabulous dinner of seared ahi, rice noodles, spring rolls, shrimp and martinis.  My father proceeds to lighten up the mood by stealing, by hand, a handful of my rice noodles and shove them in his mouth.  This is a nice restaurant.  I am my father’s daughter in some ways.  I throw more noodles at him.  I sip my apple martini under the toasty heat lamps surrounding us on the patio above the ocean.  We joke about my brother and Eileen flirts with the waiter.  We talk through the night about what we will do with the rest of their time here.  After I’ve seen them back to their hotel, I drive away home.  The night is cooler now, but the window is down so I can surround myself with that cool, moist night air.  I chuckle as I think…we should find sandollars more often.

       ”Life responds when we risk.” - Rodney Smith , "Lessons From the Dying"    I haven’t written in a few days.  The quote above is powerful to me, and it will take on new meaning as I write more in the next week or so.  You will understand why I chose it.  (And you already know, Lt.)  Life has gotten busy and complicated…both in difficult ways and in delightful sunny surprises.  I know I’ve neglected writing, and cannot take real time to post what I want now.  There were several very bad days when the darkness and thick clouds of uncertainty and frustration managed to penetrate my positive and calm demeanor.  I found myself lost in my ability to see the positive.  The ocean merely taunted me with it’s beauty, and it seemed someone had dipped me in a hard shell.  Everything went wrong at once.  Since I know from your comments and emails that these days and my ability to recover from them is something that inspires you, I will share this shortly.  I have been writing.  Notes on the computer…random pieces of paper…entries in my journal.  I wasn’t able to put it together.  A long letter to the Boy helped me regain my focus a bit and find some solace in warm details of his words back to me.  Yes, there have been developments, substantially, over the last week or two.  He’s become a bright spot in any day, however dark.  His words and actions, in writing and in person, create this safe place where I can fall.  Trusting someone to catch me has never been easy, but the Boy has earned it.  He tells me I’ve earned it, too, which I know is a big thing for him.  In any romantic relationship I’ve been in, I was the one to write the brilliantly worded letters and sweet notes.  This Boy has this ability also, which can definitely leave me all swoony.  I run my fingers along the words, amazed in their ability to break the hard shell and leave me smiling.  For this loveliest and most expected of life’s details, I am grateful.  I have to pull myself away to get anything done.  There is more to say on this subject also, but I must restrain myself so I can get some work done.  You heard right, work.  I thought I had a permanent job and it started immediately on Wednesday.  It turns out that it is not permanent, but the woman I work for has helped me out in ways I can’t believe.  Her name is Ema, she’s French, very direct, and probably my best boss ever.  They needed some specific help, but my legal background came into play and I went over and above.  Ema, in response, started paying me cash under the table (and without telling the agency) so I could get paid what was fair (the agency was getting $8 on top of my hourly).  Now I just work for her and the agency is out of it.  She filled my gas tank up and paid money on my phone bill, just a little, to keep it on.  I’ve gotten too far ahead.    These few days that were so dark were filled with a migraine that had come and gone for 7 days (still refuses to leave completely), no sleep as a result of the migraine and not having the proper medication, every thing was about to be shut off (phone, electric, etc.).  I had spent days fighting with doctors trying to get this medication thing settled, as I don’t have a neurologist here in San Diego yet.  I was beyond overtired, in pain, was losing vision in my left eye, and beginning to lose my balance.  This is very dangerous water for a brain injury survivor because it could mean hospitals or further injury.  I don’t know how I went to work those days.  Thursday, I was really beginning to feel the lack of sleep (I have still to feel normal even though the medication problem is solved).  I was driving to work which is up in Miramar.  There is a marine/navy reserve and a marine base there.  I have always loved planes, almost joined the airforce :::laughing:::, but me and someone telling me what to do is not a good combination.  As I sat in the traffic from hell on Miramar Rd., I could hear and see Tomcats all over the place above my head (F14’s).  Some girls are groupies, I got a thing about airplanes.  I never dated a pilot though.    I smiled at the planes and kept running things through my head to be grateful for, but I was coming up wanting.  Even knowing I would talk to the Boy later didn’t help like it normally did.  I felt small and lost and not resourceful.  I kept saying, just get through the next few days.  You will catch up on sleep and figure things out and you won’t feel as bad as you do now.  I had mentioned the night before to the Boy that sometimes I wish that someone would just handle it…say, I got it, don’t worry.  I do that for people so often, and I really needed that then.  I pulled into work sending thoughts to the universe to help me get through the day.  The drive had found me in thought and in tears, so I walked into work sort of sniffly and a mess.  I was greeted at the door by Jake, a big chocolate lab, with a stuffed bunny in his mouth.  He pushed the bunny into my belly insisting I grab a leg and pull.  Instantly I broke into a smile and was thankful that there was a living breathing detail of the amazing qualities of life to distract me all day.  Ema tells me, sit down right there and play with him.  Orders to play!  I sat down and played with Jake and the bunny who could not have been cuter.  All day he’d walk over to my desk and put his bunny and his head on my lap and look up at me.  I had to be productive since I was at work, but his presence made the day so much better.  Ema took him for a walk and they walked down the street…Ema in her pink top and pink slingbacks…Jake bouncing along beside her with a bunny in his mouth.  Ema notices I was upset and asked me why,  I tried to just make a general statement.  You can’t say no to Ema, you can’t.  She insisted on the truth, so I told her.  She insisted on putting gas in the car and paying the portion of my phone bill that I need to keep it on.  I was really uncomfortable with this and kept refusing.  She handed my keys and her cell phone, put her credit card in my pocket, and pushed me out the door telling me to fill the car all the way up.  Five minutes later, she called, you must fill the car all the way up.  I insist.  Later, she said, this is about helping people.  You didn’t hesitate to help us in ways that weren’t part of your job here.  You let me do this for you now because that’s what it’s about.  Somebody handled it for me.  It was amazing.    Later, I checked my messages waiting to hear from doctors, and guess who I heard instead?  The Boy.  Two messages telling me he hopes I’m okay (he didn’t have my work number, but he does now).  Some days, you just have to hold on to the love the universe gives you and know that you will be okay.  These hard things, they are part of life.  If we expect them, it can cushion the blow.  Sometimes we can’t find our way out of the sad, lost and small place.  But, if we let them, these things the universe provides…whether it’s from a doggie with a bunny, someone you just met, or someone who has found a place in your heart…can provide the solace and support during our time of darkness.  We have to just open our eyes and see them, they often come from unexpected places, and be grateful that they are there.  Focus on taking care of ourselves spiritually during these times can make it bearable, and make us find our way faster.  I still am exhausted and won’t be able to sleep like I wanted to because I have to work this weekend.  I’m getting great money though and I have resolved the most urgent of the problems.  I tell Ema she’s my French angel…she laughs and says, no, you are our Irish angel.  The universe provided for both of us, because we both really needed each other.  I had a long, brilliant conversation with Boy last night into the morning.  The emails and online chats are always a part of our day.  He’s in the Navy (who isn’t where I live?) so I can’t see him right now, but soon.  Until then, his perfect voice on the phone telling me all will be okay and his amazing letters make me happy and stupid…all at once.    And to think, this place of recovery began with a plane and a dog.

       “….You shall be free indeed when your days are not without a care nor your nights without a want and a grief, but rather when these things girdle your life and yet your rise above them naked and unbound....”  -  Kahlil Gibran      Starting up the car, pulling out into the unusually warm spring air.  The smell of the water hits me right away.  Honeysuckle fills the air.  Something else too…Jasmine?  Maybe Orange Blossom?  I always get it mixed up, but it is a fragrance that I always associate with spring and summer here.  It’s a sense of liberation, just me and my car.  No automatic for me.  I need to be more of a participant in my driving experience.  I don’t care if it’s a Honda or a Diablo (I’ll confirm or deny this the first time I drive a Lamborghini).  I just need for it to really drive.  I pull out of the garage and out over the bridge.  I can see to my left, the city.  My city.  The tall sparkly buildings…the little Spanish houses decorated in little lights all year round…the blue and white lights around the harbor and the bay.  The deep blue water filled in with sail boats.  I get through a few turns, and it’s on to the freeway.  There are so many in San Diego that pretty much anywhere you go you can take the freeway.  My last obstacle to the freeway is this three lane one-way street that I have to cross.  People drive it like it’s the autobahn.  I don’t care though, because at the end of it, is the on ramp…and if I get a green light down there I can punch it all the way through.  This night, I am lucky.  I am going way too fast up the on ramp and around the curve to hit the 5 North.  It’s good to see that my sensibilities and practicalities haven’t completely taken me over, and that the wild girl comes out for moments to play.  Her nickname, by the way, is Cherry.  I didn’t give it to myself.  Remind me, and I will tell you the little story sometime.  It’s cool enough now that no air conditioning is needed, which I don’t use a lot of the time anyway (this is good since it just broke!), and the windows are down.  I can’t believe I lived without this sensation for two years.  Driving is my outlet, my place to vent.  Fortunately for me, the flow of traffic in California is usually about 15 miles over the speed limit, so I am a little more safe speeding around with expired tags.  Such is the price of freedom right now, and it is what it is.  Freeway near empty, people whizzing by me at 80, radio blaring.  Shortly after my accident, since I couldn’t work, I had to move and sell my car.  It wasn’t the best decision, but I had a whole new education in poverty and the human condition in those two years that has proved itself invaluable.  Back in December, I was finally able to buy another car.  I did good.  The only really important thing to me was that it not break down and leave me without a car on the way here or once I got here.  The second most important thing is that the stereo kick ass…or as beedle says….kick ASS.  It takes me away, those moments in my car with the radio providing the soundtrack to whatever is going on in my head.  I bought my car, my little white Honda, and my Mom said, “What’s her name?”  I’m not in the practice of naming my cars, but at that moment it seemed perfect.  “Freedom,” I said.    I was now saying, Freedom, baby, I promise you will have gas soon….just please please get me to the beach.  She complied.  Once there I could return something my Dad bought me while here, that didn’t fit, and get CASH.  The funny thing?  If I had asked him for the cash instead of what he bought while he was here, which I didn’t really need, he would have said no.  I return the stuff, savor that feeling of having money for 42 seconds, and I beg Freedom to get me across the street to the store, and back up the street to the gas station.  We did it.  Driving home, with no worries for once in a little while, of running out of gas, I watched the city on my right go by.  I smiled.  Ran my hand through my hair.  Took a deep breath.  Song comes on…”….walking down this rocky road…wondering where my life is leading...rolling on, to the bitter end…”  The universe often provides the soundtrack, doesn’t it?  This particular part of the song just strikes me as being too perfect for this moment.  I smile.  I turn it up.  I drive faster.  You know, the rest of this song doesn’t not fit either.  It’s Bad Company, “Ready for Love.”  This morning found me restless.  Couldn’t sleep.  Sun was too bright too early, and it was HOT.  90 degrees today, which is unusual for any time of the year here on the coast (inland is desert, so it gets really hot in the summer).  I found that there were a few chinks in my armor.  Rent is due soon…no word about the job…my driver’s license expires in 2 weeks…my car insurance is probably cancelled…no tags on the car…and soon, everything (phone, power, internet, etc.) will be shut off.  Going through the morning ritual of opening windows and blinds for the kids…not too much this day as the a/c is on…putting books or journals or magazines away that are inevitably all over my room….turning on the news and the computer…I tried to focus on something else.  My dad, Jay, a southern boy, says, “If I got paid a dollar for every minute I worried, I’d be a rich man.  It doesn’t solve anything.”  I walked into my closet and stripped down, pulling a t-shirt off the top shelf.  I unfolded it.  It says “One Team, One Goal.”  I smile.  It’s from the Stanley Cup playoffs in 2001, the last year we won the cup.  Man, what a great season that was.  I was lucky enough to go to games in every round of the playoffs, including the final.  I had my friends so obsessed with hockey that year.  I am so superstitious, it’s nuts.  The girls were all wearing certain colors of blue nail polish that we renamed after the Avalanche in some way.  I even had a greeting on my voice mail saying that you MUST watch all playoff games, at home or at the rink, commando.  I had hockey game parties where it was confirmed no one was wearing underwear!  What can I say?  It worked, right?  If you are not a hockey fan, you may not understand how superstitious we are.  It’s all part of the fun. This, is a good memory.  I finished getting dressed, and put the kettle on.  Raspberry green tea with honey.  The room is alive with raspberry and I bring it to my face and breathe in.  I don’t want to face the day.  Dealing with the movers, bills, money in general.  I start to flip through a book called The Cherokee Feast of Days, by Joyce Sequichie Hifler.  This is a favorite of mine.  It has little daily inspirations.  I’m on the third volume now.  I don’t always stay with the date I’m on, I flip around until something strikes me.  I begin to read about handling all the difficult and unpleasant things early in the day…then to walk away, knowing you have done your best, then you can enjoy the day.  Instead of dreading what needs to be done and putting it off until later or tomorrow (this is my specialty), just tackle it.  Today is a day for a new approach.  I pull up my calendar, get a lot of stuff done, and realized it was not as bad as the anticipation of it was.  I know this is common sense.  But, we all need reminding.  As I was moving to what was next, I realized I haven’t checked my email.  You know how hearing from certain people can always lift you up?  I got the best email last night.  Sweet and thoughtful.  I forgot all about it until I opened my email again.  I read it again, and touched the words on the screen with my fingertips.  I started to write.  I saw Danny’s comments on my post.  The kitties were now on the balcony enjoying the humid, hot weather.  Petie had fallen asleep, on his back, paws in the air.  He was in this position like in his dream he was running really fast around a corner.  I laughed and remembered that progress, in and of itself, is progress.  The anxiety is still there, as my jaw can testify from my few hours of sleep that I did get.  As I’m feeling some chinks coming out of the armor, the phone rings.  I pick it up and look at the caller I.D.  The cable (and internet) company.  The one phone call I had yet to make.  Terry, from the UK, listens as I tell him that I have no money right now and that I’m waiting to hear about a job.  He says, “Fingers crossed.”  Then he tells me here’s what we’ll do….and suddenly, I’m okay and there are no worries about losing my cable and internet.  For a little while anyway.  If life’s beauty is in the details, life’s salvation comes in small reprieves.  I realized I forgot to eat, I do this all the time, and begin to make some more tea and eat something.  I was watching Petie play with a bug that apparently only he could see, and I remembered something last night that was really cool and made me wonder.  When I decided to move cross country, I decided to get rid of my furniture.  I had had it for a long time and I wanted a new start.  Not to mention I would have had to sell my kidneys to pay for the move.  I needed something to sleep on, so I got an air mattress…the kind that you pump up with just a button (thank the goddess).  It seems to be defective and I have not dealt with the company yet, although I think I can return it.  One of the reasons I get migraines right now is because of the way everything got jacked up in the accident, and when the bed has a hole in it (of which it has many), it messes with my neck.  I had to go on hole patrol.  I strip the bed and crawl around with my butt in the air listening to my bed.  It’s very pretty.  Petie thinks this is a game I made up for him.  He comes and walks around and rubs on me and gets all happy and purr-y.  The really loud kind that sounds like a muscle car at a stop light.  This night, I go through the routine, and I cannot find the bloody leak.  (I’d rather be cussing, but for you, I will refrain ;)  )  Petie comes in, walks around, and sits down on one corner after a while of watching me look.  I look at him and say, “Petie, where’s the leak buddy?  Help me out papa.”  He’s sitting on the upper right corner, looks at me, looks at the bed, and does a little pounce (no nails).  He walks over to where he pounced, and taps on one spot three or four times.  I giggled, and petted his little feet and said, “You big sweetie.  Thanks for trying.”  Right then, my hand was resting by his paw, and guess what I felt?  AIR.  Coming out of the bed.  He found the bloody leak.  It was little bitty, and probably not the only one since we have deflation problems still (look away boys), but I can sleep on it fine and it’s comfortable.    All that and the Av’s are playing the Kings tonight on a channel out here so I can see the game.  Now, I ask you, how’s that for divine intervention?  I can’t help but feel anything but lucky.  The price of freedom can be steep indeed.  True happiness, peace, serenity and salvation cannot be found when your spirit is bound in chains.  The chains may be the “shoulds”…concern for money…concerns for “what ifs”…other people…or our own lack of faith in our abilities and worth.  On the wrong path, even the things that should be blessings seem like burdens.  On your path, burdens bring hidden blessings.  The questions to ask are this:  If not now, then when?  What has to happen for your life to begin?  If the price of freedom is high, what price then of the sacrifices you make to live without it?

       “Happiness and suffering come from your own mind, not from outside. Your own mind is the cause of happiness; your own mind is the cause of suffering. To obtain happiness and pacify suffering, you have to work within your own mind.” -  Lama Zopa Rinpoche , "The Door To Satisfaction"   (Forgive me.  It’s a long one.  Longer than normal, I should say.) I don’t know why, but that song “The Scientist” from Coldplay keeps going through my head.  I keep hearing it on the radio, too, and I never hear it on the radio.  My interview was initially scheduled for Thursday at 4:00, but I got some misinformation about traffic in the area and missed it.  Fortunately, I was able to reschedule for Friday, which meant canceling Friday things, but the interview went well.  Between traffic, the lack of gas in my tank, and the fact that it was an interview I was scheduled for, the stress was threatening to come forth into road rage.  Instead, this song came on.  It has no real relevance to me, but the concept of going back to the beginning…taking a step back and a deep breath.  I put the lyrics at the end, just because I did.   Strange dreams last night.  I tend to have very vivid dreams, and lately nightmares, which this was.  I’d like to attribute it to the Imitrex (migraine medication), but it’s just my brain.  Slept through until the afternoon today.  Migraines usually, for me, come in bunches.  When that happens, I handle the Imitrex quite well.  I don’t take it every time, because it sometimes is too frequent to take it safely.  I haven’t had to take it in a little while, so it wipes me out.  It does weird, but bless-ed, things to your central nervous system.  Have to keep things a bit dark and quiet today, and I can’t drive.  I feel bad because it’s sunny for the first time in a long time and the kitties want the sun, so I figured out a way to make it work for all us.    It’s true, that I’m in pain and things are very difficult right now.  I’m not complaining, I’m happy.  For the first time in years, I’m happy.  I don’t have certain things in my life that I want, and do have certain things in my life that I don’t want, but I am honestly happy.  This is my journey and these things are necessary.  The lack of money, the lack of food, the lack of everything over these last 4 years has been the hardest thing I’ve ever been through.  It’s my 9 months of traveling with nothing but a singing bowl and the clothes on my back (Buddha).  My 40 days in the desert.  I do feel blessed to be who I am.  Not a prisoner to the world of “should.”  I’m only 35, 36 in two weeks, and I’ve broken free of the bondage of that path.  I see people going through this in their 50’s or 60’s…or having a heart attack or cancer and having to look at themselves and their lives…or having some mid-life crisis and having to choose enlightenment or instant gratification.  For me, it was a car accident 4 years ago.  I feel like I’ve shared so much with you, maybe I should tell you a little background.  There is a lot to this story, so I will tell it in pieces, here and there.  I was an attorney.  I went to law school later than most, at 26 and graduated at 29.  I interned a lot in college, took my time….then I worked for a while.  I was too wild to go straight out of college.  I wouldn’t have graduated.  I moved to Denver after graduation, took the bar exam and passed.  I made the decision in an emotional time to move there (I have family there), and it wasn’t the best way to do it.  But it was obviously my path.  Two years after moving there found me already laid off from a firm, the market was really bad and very impacted, and doing my own contract work.  I was struggling, but okay.  I loved my apartment, I was dating a lot and playing a lot.  I missed San Diego, I wanted to move back almost as soon as I got to Denver, but I gave it a shot.  Almost got married, but it broke up in November of 1999.  I have to tell you about him.  He was too good to skip over.  He was a tall southern boy, played rugby, was a surgeon (I hate dating doctors, but my family was excited, believe me).  He was funny and charming, and couldn’t be more different from me.  That turned out to be our undoing.  I met him when my dad, Jay, fell and shattered both femur bones into more than 50 pieces.  Michael was his orthopedic surgeon.  He had the best bedside manner of any doctor I ever met.  He took great care of my Dad and of all of us.  As soon as the crisis was over, I realized how lovely he was and was smitten.  I told my Dad, wouldn’t it be funny if I married him all because you were trimming the ivy 12 feet high?  I remember the exact moment when I realized he felt the same.  He had just come off rotation and was a bit disheveled.  I was the night shift at the hospital with my Dad, who was on heavy morphine.  I passed Michael on the stairs as he was coming down from checking in on my Dad and I was coming up from getting some iced tea.  We chatted a bit, and it was all nervous and awkward.  As we passed each other, he was now on the stairs below me and I was to the top, he said, “I’m glad to see you are okay.  Your Dad is a really great guy, but I’m really glad to see you.”  He waited a minute to see how I’d react.  Of course, I smiled and said, “Well, I’m very grateful he has you as a doctor.  You’ve been outstanding, Dr. Williams (changing names now).  It’s nice that you are around when I’m here at night.”  I smiled.  He blushed.  I was done.  This 6’2” 220 muscle bound rugby player doctor, blushed.  Alas, he had a girlfriend so it wasn’t meant to be at that time.  Shortly after I had gone back to Denver (this happened in New Mexico), I sent him and the other surgeon a thank you note.  I guess he hung onto it, because some months later I wake up one morning to see “Michael Williams” on my caller I.D. at 3:00 in the morning.  It couldn’t be a booty call since we were 7 hours apart.  He called again later to apologize for waking me up, which he didn’t.  He said he’d been carrying the note around for a long time, and got drunk so he could find the courage to call.  Boys.  After that, it was a big whirlwind.  I was in love.  He used to call me, straight out of surgery from the phone in the O.R., “Baby, I’m all bloody!”  Just a little bit of that Louisiana coming out in his voice, always more when he drank.  We’d spend hours on the phone where he’d play me songs, he played classical guitar which was a nice surprise.  He’d write me long love letters and call me from the weirdest places all day.  We’d spend long weekends in bed, tasting wine, going out for sushi and trying to keep our hands off of each other for a few minutes.  We laughed all the time.  Then, the end of his 5th and last year as a surgical resident was coming up and he was getting job offers all around the country.  He was raised in a little town and wanted to practice medicine in a little town.  I’d rather eat my own shoe than live in a little town.  I was a city girl.  I had my own business, was practicing, was looking to get back into the D.A.’s office.  He loved camping, as do I, and horses and dogs and the mountains.  We were good there.  I hate country music, but I loved him and we had a lot of music in common, so it was fine.  But, hate fishing and, obviously, hunting.  He said, okay, I don’t need to hunt.  I said, okay, I don’t need to move back to San Diego right now.  We were compromising.  One day, he tells me of a great offer he got in a little town in New Mexico called Silver City.  No D.A.’s office to speak of, no Starbucks, not many places to get shopping done, no doctor in town (he’d be working for the hospital outside of town).  He said, “Baby, it snows a lot (I love that), we could have horses, you could order anything you want off of the internet and we could fly anywhere you want to go shopping as much as you want.  I’ll buy you a coffee shop!  We’ll get a Starbucks franchise!  Whatever you want.”  I hate shopping, mind you, he’s talking about the things you use every day.  I was so happy with him I thought that I would be willing to give it a shot.  I had some terms.  I was afraid of losing my independence.  What was I going to do while he was working long hours?  What if the women were catty?  What if I’m miserable?  What if I want to practice my kind of trial law again?  He said, “I’m going to be making a lot of money there and the standard of living is nothing.  Can’t you just be happy with being a doctor’s wife?”  I nearly threw the phone out the window.  Apparently, this is what he really wanted and he had no idea that’s not who I am.  I had things in my life I didn’t want to give up and he would be a busy man there, or anywhere.  I tried one final thing.  I said, okay, I’ll make you a deal.  We go there, we stay for 2 years.  If I’m miserable and have to give up too much of myself to be happy, at that 2 year mark we renegotiate.  He wouldn’t go for it.  Sometime later we broke up.  He started a fight during one visit because I don’t like fly fishing!  That turned into some big drama, but the bottom line was that he wanted me to change into something I wasn’t.  He wanted me to give up everything for him, but was only willing to give up hunting (and honestly, once out there, I don’t think that would have stuck).  That was hard, because a life with him – in some ways – was exactly what I wanted.    That was November.  In January of 2000, I realized I had mono!  Michael didn’t have it, that was a funny phone call, so I don’t know where it came from.  He couldn’t have it and not know because he wouldn’t be able to keep up his schedule.  Who knows?  Maybe that random hockey player I kissed on New Year’s Eve.  Finally, in March I have a day where I actually feel better.  I had an appointment.  I was driving there and it began to snow, March is the snowiest month in Colorado.  I slowed down to avoid a car that turned right in front of me, and as I was up shifting, this man drove into the back of my car.  Didn’t slide, never hit his brakes, just drove into me.  The damage to my car was not significant.  But, I was knocked out.  My brain hit the front of my skull, then the back, damaging the frontal lobe and the brain stem.  My shoulder and back muscle on my right side ripped away from my rib cage (due to the seatbelt).  Now, I have a closed head brain injury called MTBI (Mild Traumatic Brain Injury).  I will have problems for the rest of my life, some will get better, but most will not.  I can no longer practice law because of the amount of cognitive energy it takes and because of the way my brain now processes information….among other things.  I have problems reading and with my balance – they are connected through the brain stem injury.  Word retrieval, short term memory, organization.  My personality changed so much.  I went from being social and confident, to isolating myself and being nervous around people.  My brain and my intellect was my most prized resource.  Suddenly, I felt like I couldn’t express my feelings in front of people and I felt awkward and weird.  Voila!  My life changes overnight.  This woman, Kara L. Swanson, wrote a book called, “I’ll Carry the Fork” about her MTBI (the title refers to the random things we learn to do to remember things…in this case, she carries a fork, to remember that she has something in the oven).  She says that you realize that sometimes when your life ends, you don’t actually die.  That’s how it felt then, and occasionally now.  I realize now all the reasons it happened though, and I’m grateful that it did.  I don’t like the fall out and the rehab, for my shoulder or my brain, but the person I am now wouldn’t be here otherwise.  I really am a better person for it.  There’s no need for sympathy for me.  I really don’t want that.  I tell people only to explain why I get tired easy or why I forgot something.  I tell people when I feel like it could help, serve a purpose, which is why I tell you now.    Beedle mentioned in her comments that her life was full of loud and busy and stress.  I think that is probably true of all of us, at least sometimes, and I know it’s been true of me.  The little things will save you, dear Beedle.  I promise.  I’ve tried to get back to California for the last four years, since the accident.  Circumstances would not allow.  I had the worst four years of my life, and of that the last year (up until last month) was so profoundly hard for me, there are not words.  Some of this I want to share with you, and will as we go along I’m sure.  In December, when it was evident that I was finally coming home to San Diego and the planning could, at very long last, commence, I still had so much to do.  So much planning, and on my own.  There were days when I thought it was just a tease and I waited for some disaster to prevent it.  I struggled with the errands and the phone calls and the check lists.  I really struggled with packing, I’m very bad and it and tend to get quite flustered.  Organizational skills are something that were knocked right out of me that day in March.  It was, as they say, so close but so far away.  I did a lot during this time to refocus and regroup, to lift my spirits, and to remind myself that deep in my heart (where all the answers are if you listen) I knew that I would make it.  There were two specific little things that got me through.  First, a website called www.surfshot.com.  It’s a few people that go out with cameras to all the hot surf spots each morning and each evening to show where the good surf is.  I could log on and see my beloved beaches, the ones where I always went out and lived for a while (Pacific and Mission).  I would blow the pictures up as my screensaver.  I logged on a half a dozen times a day, at least, to remind myself what I was killing myself for and spending all my money to do.  Second thing, and this one will make you laugh at me a little, was on that show on Fox, the O.C.  They have a song that plays for the theme that is a remake of “California here we come..”…but by the Phantoms?  (can’t remember) Anyway, I have yet to figure out how to download music (in my defense, my software has a glitch that I have not put time into fixing), so on Wednesday nights I couldn’t wait to hear that song.  I even taped it so I could play it over and over.  I then figured out how to download it, but not how to put it on a C.D. (which is what I meant before).  I would stop what I was doing and close my eyes, and remember the goal.   Take deep breaths and drink in what is around you.  Focus on what you have everyday that you love…coffee, favorite sweatshirt, oranges first thing in the morning.  I promise there are little things that will help you rebuild your perspective so that the loud and the stressful and the busy don’t preoccupy you.  I live by the freeway AND the airport!  Police helicopters, cars, planes (although they are not that close so it’s not very loud).   Every day is, literally, a fight for survival to make sure I eat, the kids eat, there is doctor/vet when needed, shampoo, medicine, etc.  The difference is that now, while these things do cause stress and require my attention, I’m happy.  I am resourceful and bright and I know this is temporary.  Find consciousness every day, don’t tune out as we all can do from time to time, and there will be peace in the moments.  I really promise.  I’m living proof.  Sparky says I’m her in an alternate lifetime.  I think so, too.  She reminds me of me so much.  How I grew up, my too-early sexcapades, how she sees life now.  I don’t see her in person, day to day, but I imagine that her emotions and her ability to put humor into everything get her through.  They are big though, and she sometimes doesn’t know what to do with it all.  (Sparky, if I’m speaking out of school or I’m wrong, feel free to slap me.)  I used to be, not saying this is Sparky now, all of that emotion and humor plus a whole lot of negative energy and pessimism.  Not because I wanted to be that way, but because I kept looking at life like…that’s the way it’s always been, so that’s the way it will always be.  When I realized how this was killing me and hurting my body, mind and soul, I began to try and change it.  I can’t say that it’s gone totally, it’s part of me and that’s okay.  I can’t say that a situation couldn’t present itself to me tomorrow that wouldn’t challenge everything I’ve ever said to you.  I could be cussing and screaming and pulling the full drama queen.  I’m entitled to be human.  I’m just not so hard on myself about it.  I try to regroup and find focus and find the solutions as soon as possible.  You’ve seen in this journal me feeling like I couldn’t do it.  You saw me regroup and find beauty and solace in the little things again.  It’s life.  It goes in cycles.  It doesn’t have do be a  menace.  All of you can do it.  You are each little gifts to the planet…to those who love you…and to me.  (Sparky is nekkid with nothing on but a red bow!  Don’t you love that about her?)  If you have a faith or a philosophy or a discipline that you like, study it, learn it, figure out how it can help.  I’ve always been, in my heart, a Buddhist.  I don’t mean the dogma of Buddhist religion, but the philosophy and tradition.  The key is to never give up searching for what you want and who you want to be.  What is in your life is a blessing.  You can shape it.  It’s yours.  We are all powerless to an extent, it’s true, but really, we have the power over our own perspective and that’s the key to happiness or suffering (like in the quote above).    The Scientist come up to meet ya  tell ya i'm sorry  you don't know how lovely you are  i had to find you  tell you i need you  tell you i set you apart  tell me your secrets  and ask me your questions  oh let's go back to the start  running in circles  coming up tails  heads on a silence apart  nobody said it was easy  it's such a shame for us to part  nobody said it was easy  no one ever said it would be this hard  oh take me back to the start  i was just guessing  at numbers and figures  pulling your puzzles apart  questions of science  science and progress  do not speak as loud as my heart  tell me you love me  come back and haunt me  ooh and i rush to the start  running in circles  chasing our tails  coming back as we are  nobody said it was easy  it's such a shame for us to part  nobody said it was easy  no one ever said it would be so hard  i'm going back to the start

       "I know of no more encouraging fact than the unquestionable ability of man to elevate his life by conscious endeavor." –  Thoreau    Late night sounds of cars whirring by and Alicia Keys purring on my laptop swim around me as I contemplate how this topic, integrity, has presented itself to me today.  I take frequent sips of pomegranate/cherry juice, which are like little pops to my senses and bursts of morning.  Scrapper has now realized she likes this juice, too, and is pondering how she can get her face to fit inside the bottle.  This day, although quiet, has been brilliant.  Filled with little treats just for me.  The happy sound of the Boy as he shared his day with me, and the sound of his sweet sexy voice as he began to fall asleep.  The gift of a nice big grocery shopping trip filled with red peppers, watermelon, fresh veggies, and pasta.  A little stray kitten that finally let me close enough to her to feed her.  Once I gain her trust, I will find her a home where she is not starving and searching for fresh water.  The look on her little face when she sees me, knowing I will make sure she eats.  She has this tiny pale pink nose with a thin, black line encircling it.  As if someone took magic marker to it so it would stand out.  Her little white feet are dirty, but her eyes are bright and green, and she knows I am a friend.  My team winning game 2 in the first round of the Stanley Cup Playoffs brilliantly.  Planning a summer visit with Trinity and an even bigger adventure with the Boy.  Tomorrow may hold a “play date” with a dog who’s mommy is struggling right now.  Big dog, half malamute, half husky.  Hopefully, tomorrow afternoon will find me dirty and messy running on dog beach with Rogue (who we call Moose).  My hair will be whipped up and have that great salty texture from the ocean wind, and my white tennies will be covered with sand and mud.  Sounds like a near perfect day.  Tonight, on my mind, is this concept of integrity.  Honesty.  Honor.  I believe it to be the key to our salvation sometimes.  If we, each individual…each government…each country…could treat each other with integrity and be courteous of our individual need to maintain our dignity, I honestly believe we could solve some problems.  World politics is not my expertise, but I see this in play daily.  The way I maintain my sense of calm in conflict with another is to take the high road.  Be the bigger person.  After all, someone’s petty negativity cannot really harm me.  It cannot change my world and my mind unless I let it.  I choose not to let it.  I’m not sure what causes people to be so hurtful and negative…to lash out in a situation where kindness would do more to find an end to the problem.  I believe that these people are hurting.  Buddhist philosophy says that all people, all faiths and religions, all countries, deserve to be treated with integrity.   As part of the same human family, our desires to dress, live, believe in certain ways deserve respect.  I find it confusing to deal with someone who feels that in order for them to get what they want, for them to “win,” I must lose.  It is possible for both of us to win.  There is enough success and love and happiness to go around.  In reality, we do not compete with each other for these things, but with ourselves.  I had a confrontation with the property manager here, not over my lack of rent (it’s there and paid) but over how I paid it.  For some reason, the rules that I was told apply, did not apply to me this time.  Apparently, when questioned by her supervisor on something regarding me, she played dumb and did not own up to her responsibility.  As a result, I got a four minute rant on my voice mail about something that was clearly irrelevant as to whether or not rent was paid.  My initial response was, to think, okay, this woman is toxic to me and I will not allow her to interfere with my state of mind.  Upon reflection, I was really horrified to find that her way to deal with this problem was to be harsh and ugly.  I wanted to call her and defend myself, but this never goes anywhere.  I had to be the bigger person in order to preserve my own well being and the rest of my time living here.  I called her and was very business like and calm, but did say that I felt it inappropriate for her to talk to me as she did and to persecute me for following the rules as she set them out.  Her behavior seemed to say that she was trying to derail my dignity.  That my struggle and my differences made her the “better” person.  That is a very sad and empty way to live.  As the day progressed, I came to the conclusion that while a cup of tea or a good game of fetch with Petie brings me immense happiness,  I believe she has very little true happiness and peace within herself.    This was a potent topic today, as it continued to come up.  It was the universe telling me to reflect on what was really at issue here and act on only that, with integrity and detachment…meaning, what this woman did or said really had nothing to do with me or who I am.  This value, integrity, is the protector of my soul and of my desire to be at peace.  It is not worth sacrificing to “win” any argument or ever be the “better person.”  The conscious choice to live your life in integrity and respect the dignity of others is truly a brilliant gift.  As Thoreau says above, it is encouraging that we each have the control and power to elevate our lives.  What better way?

       “Out of intense complexities, intense simplicities emerge." -  Winston Churchill    Mostly gray days with humid breezes, glide around me and take me away to times of no responsibility.  When the sun breaks through, a small victory is announced, and people multiply on streets and sidewalks talking on cell phones and smiling as they go for coffee.  Like recess.  As clouds break at night, I look over the wall of my apartment complex at the Coronado bridge.  The tiny lights dot the sky over the blackness of the water, making it look as though it was floating.  It seems endless at night.  Stretching out into the distance and seeming to just disappear among the clouds and stars.  I always think that it’s a magic bridge somehow.  That we could drive over it and make a wish, which would most certainly come true.    The universe has surrounded me in loving arms of support, sending messages as fast as I can receive them.  When working for Ema (the project has now ended but I have made new friends -- Jake included) I wondered about the next step, the next project, the Boy, my possibilities.  There was a day when I began to believe the whole thing with the Boy was too complicated and wondered if I should just walk away.  This is not my normal thought process.  I believe we are lucky to have loving moments, moments of love, tenderness, excitement…whatever it is…with someone we receive as a gift.  Moments where we are able and willing to play in the fields of wild abandon are few and far between.  This Boy, this Man, brought full realization to these moments for me.  And, I was scared to death.  I was one moment accepting this for what it is in the moment, and the next feeling like I had to take some dramatic action to shake it up or stop it.  Long conversations with his voice on the other end of the phone, missing me, from out in the middle of nowhere.  His words on the phone and in letters brought happiness, and hope.  I was able, for the first time in four years, to really let someone in.  I calmed myself by methodically finishing a project or going through routines…when all along I had to catch my breath at the thought of his voice, the touch of his hand, the depth of his word.  This is the point where I begin to panic, thinking it’s all too much…too soon…to complicated.  The universe had other ideas.  I drive down the street to see a young man walking wearing a bright t-shirt with Boy’s home state across it in capital letters.  After work, I go to the store and see license plates from there… people talking about there…a state I’ve never heard much about where I live.  I finally succumbed.  Okay okay, mercy…I said to the universe.  I get your point.  I still, as of this night, find my heart heavy due to email and telephonic communications…maybe miscommunications…and wondering if truly he is standing next to me on this page.  Behavior said today, tonight, that maybe not.  Time will tell what our purpose is to each other.  Maybe it’s already fulfilled it’s destiny.    My birthday was a couple of days ago.  At one point in my life, I would have been excited about it.  Now, due to disappointments and drama over the years, I barely acknowledge it.  Boy knew, but him being out doing navy things, I wouldn’t see him.  Late in my day, a surprise comes in the form of sunshine…a dozen sunflowers (he knows I love them).  In the gray day that it was, and the gray days that it has been since, there is this bright spot sent from across the world.  The cats try to eat them, and Petie looks up at them as if they were what he worshipped…big eyes, solid gaze, twitchy tail.  I look at them and wish I could put the feeling of them and the thought of my Boy in a bottle to show him this summer.  For some reason, I find myself off.  Tears are just below the surface today.  Laughter lives there, too.  It’s as if one cannot survive without the other.  I suppose they can’t, from the perspective of balance.  This moment finds them holding hands in intimate conversation.  They know their purpose.  It’s not their place to reveal.  I am not sad, I am basically happy.  But, blue and black are inexplicably on my palette.  I paint with them unwillingly, but out of some sort of necessity.  I now take pen to paper (the original form of this post) to explore their presence and meaning.  I’m not sure if it’s for me to know, or only to experience.  Letting go any preconceived notion of their essence:  good, bad, fun, painful.  If happiness were my martini, these colors and the emotions they represent would be my olives.  I paint sparingly and unwillingly…but always knowing they will be a part of my painting.  My thoughts turn to the sense of melancholy I feel.  Is there a reason?   Or is it just a general state-of-the-union sort of thing?  These are the days when we must appreciate our more delicate, less sunny emotions.  The side of us we hide from others.  We need to visit this place from time to time.  It’s a place of calm and introspection.  A place of wonder and thought.  We have a center, a place to breathe, where we can gather strength and focus.  It’s not a place for disappointment.  Every lovely piece of artwork has a back side or underneath that remains simple and untouched.  It’s not what we show, but it serves a purpose of support and space for which the artist can begin her work.  It is as vital and essential and beautiful…in it’s way…as the finished product full of meaning and texture and color.  This is a place that sometimes we all visit and resist.  We fight and claw declaring ourselves in no need of this space.  When we resist, we only find resistance.  When we surrender, we find acceptance and serenity.  Even in the middle of the storm, surrender brings acceptance.  We must work hard and speak out on behalf of ourselves, those we love, our causes.  Surrender means to accept that we have very little control over our lives and the chaos they may be in from time to time.  Lack of control only means that things will happen, that we do not want…that we do not like…that bring us pain.  Our mind is able to see that suffering, and remind us that we knew it would come.  It has come before.  We will be okay.  Our mind is able to find the details that bring us happiness and peace…to refocus all the energy from the challenge to the beauty.    Surrender has always been a part of my life and of myself that I chose to believe I didn’t really need.  I see now how foolish that was.  I cannot control what job I get, who I love, or what my family chooses to do and believe.  I fought it. I resisted.  When I stopped fighting, peace came.  I have to readjust and look for it again and again.  It gets easier.  But, it’s there for me.  Waiting to show me that my happiness is always waiting for me, and that I cannot fight things beyond my control.  Tonight, I find myself focusing on small details to, once again, shift my perspective…and realizing it’s okay to be the underneath of the sculpture.  I find my intentions.  I intend to look at those sunflowers every minute I can and feel their intention from so far away.  I intend to take care of my sweet girl, Trinity, who needs me.  I intend to keep Ema and Jake in my life.  I intend to put my work out there and be published.  I intend to crawl into cool, clean white sheets knowing that I have done my spirit’s work for that day.  I intend not to fall back in old patterns, but if I do, do be gentle and nonjudgmental of myself.  I am grateful for my Aunt Judy who sent me a brilliantly hand drawn birthday card.  I am grateful for Freedom, in every meaning of the word.  I am grateful for artists before me and spiritual guides around me who have shown me the way.  And, I am grateful that my team is in the playoffs and won the first game against Dallas – and I got to watch the game.  Every little thing in our lives deserves gratitude.  Tonight, as I head of to bed, I am grateful for my eccentricities and my imperfections.  I am grateful for my ability to be insightful and help people I love.  I am grateful for my boy Petie who is acting like a loon at this moment and cracking me up.  When I take a moment to refocus, even with something hanging heavy on my heart or my mind, I find the things in my life that bring beauty.  We all have those things if we can breathe and look for them.  All of us have beauty.  Every life with beauty in it, is worth celebrating.  We all are a celebration of the best things in life.

       “If you have built castles in the air,  your work need not be lost;  that is where they should be.  Now put the foundations under them."   Henry David Thoreau        Wednesday :  I looked solemnly at my calendar and thought, I need an assistant.  I knew in spite of my intentions that I would not be tackling all of it.  I was overly ambitious, and today I felt sort of dreamy and quiet.  I think today was a day to ease into things, finding consciousness and attentiveness, instead of busy pace and frantic thoughts.   Last night ended with real time email with Boy at work.  Sweet words were exchanged, but I still sat in the fog of unknowing and wondered if,  when it all cleared, is he the man I thought he was?  Or was this just another one of those times of evolution where, in revealing new information, everything seems unruly and wild and bleak?  As we “talked” via email I could tell he was suffering.  His way doesn’t look like my way, but it’s just as valid.   I decide knowing what I know about him, it was time to let it go and move on.  Some things said in that time will stay, but I’m not ready to walk away and neither is he.  Eventually, I call him at work and he answers his own phone with navy speak.  Couldn’t even wait for his secretary to do it when he saw my number come up.  Love that about him.  Hearing his voice brought me so much comfort.  I feel a little renewed and a little swimmy, but the day takes on a new color and texture.  I watch kitties bonding over kitty grass.  Happily sharing pieces of grass nose to nose.  I remember to eat lunch, which normally doesn’t happen without an actual lunch hour.   Crunchy sweet red bell peppers that I cut up and eat like potato chips.   I practice the art of mindfulness to take me through my day, trying to focus on one thing at a time.  Mindfulness is not something that we do much, because life has begun to revolve around multi-tasking.  I am not allowed to multi-task, that’s one big thing that makes my mind swimmy, but I have a hard time breaking old habits.  Today, I don’t research markets, listen to music, have CNN on mute but try to keep up, make breakfast/lunch, read and respond to email, check my planner and make phone calls all at the same time.  Today, I do one thing until it’s finished and move on to the next.  Ideally, there is no music or tv even while doing that one thing, but since that makes me even battier than multi-tasking, I allow music.  I have to take my own advice.  I have to take my own advice.  I have to take my own advice.  It’s a mantra.  I say, be gentle with yourself.  Do something nice for yourself.  In the spirit of that, I paint nails berry colors and schedule an appointment for some girlie stuff for tomorrow.  I do my best to do one thing at a time.  When my body says, stop, you are pushing, I stop.  If my body says sleep, I sleep.  No guilt for once, just taking care of what I’m supposed to.  A long discussion with my trauma specialist today, J. , confirms that I, in fact, have still not come to terms with who I was before the accident and who I am now.  The journey continues.  Hence, I believe, the reason for the continuing pelting of one thing after another.  To make me listen.  To make me fully comprehend the message.  I can do this.  I’m a rock star, I say, I got this far.   Thursday :   Conversations and letters with the Boy start to smooth out the rough edges.  Although, really disturbing developments are erupting in his world.  Things that could change everything.  He signs the email, “I miss you, too, girl.”  I trace the words on the screen because I can’t touch his face.  What is it about that word?  Girl.  I love that.  I, obviously, call him boy but he’s never called me that before.  Until now.  He’s the southern one here, so this strikes me as funny.  Things are on my mind still.   Once I tell him I love it, he makes sure to do it more often.  See?  Just good, this one.  My boy.  Where we stand.  What it all means.  Should I even care.  What is happening with him (more on this to come).  I come back to my belief that I’m happy now.  I’m happy with him, even though I’m really without him.  I’d rather miss him then not have him in my life at all.  I make the intention that I will let the past go, move on from here, and continue to let it all happen how it’s going to.  It’s not easy, but it is worth it.  Even with my intention, I still need a few minutes of escape.  Find that center and regroup.  Being mindful has all kinds of benefits, one is what I call recess.  If I can’t actually take a drive or get outside, I go there in my mind and let my imagination fill in every detail I can’t remember.  It’s like crafting a visual story in my mind, not a movie or a painting, but a story.  The other night, I took that drive I talked about to clear my head.  I turn on the car and pull out into the cool humid night air.  Immediately I feel lifted up.  Smiling, I pull away letting Joss Stone embrace me and start the story board.  She’s singing, “I’ve Fallen in Love With You” and it fills my car and sweeps me up.  The most amazing vocal.  The beach at night.  My quiet place.  Sanctuary.  I was gone for a long time.  I drove down the freeway, fast, letting the air sweep out all the questions and endless thoughts that pester my poor overworked mind.  I smile, Joss sings me my soundtrack, and I get off on the Grand exit to head down to Pacific Beach.  I love this beach.  It’s not a busy night down here, so I park and walk around.  It’s dark, no moon, and the waves break into bright white foam out of a black still sky married to the dark blue ocean.  I wonder at how they keep coming, as if from no where, just like a gift from the sky.  The sky has few clouds, just enough to accent it’s darkness.  A thin wispy veil of clouds cover the sky, like sheer nylon, but all the stars are still peeking through.  I closed my eyes and took in the sound.  I will never again be away from this, my ocean, my serenity.  The sound of the waves breaking is enough to calm me and bring me comfort.  I look up at the stars.  It’s too close to the city to see them all well, but there is enough to pick out a few constellations.  One star, shining the brightest, is obviously a planet.  I wondered which one, and then smiled knowing that I bet my sailor knew.  I wonder if he could see it where he was.  I wonder if he could see it where he was going.  To my right is the pier.  It’s funny, I lived here for a long time and never went there until recently.  It was just before sunset, that’s when it closes, and a few folks were meandering around the pier looking out at the view and taking pictures.  The pier is covered with little white beautiful cottages that are so lucky to be sleeping over the ocean every night.  The sound and the smell and the midst of the water enveloped them.  I wondered if the people inside knew how lucky they were to have the ocean to sing them to sleep every night.  I walk down the pier, becoming more and more aware of the boards being a half an inch or so apart.  I was looking down as I walked and catching glimpses of the ocean crashing against the pillars under the pier.  This makes me a little nervous, but I concentrate on walking and tell myself that I will not miss the details.  I get to the end of the pier, walk straight ahead, and suddenly is really is just me and the ocean.  The ocean is doing that great blue vastness thing that it does, and I am asking it…what of me, dear ocean?  Is my happiness vast?  Is it all possible?  The blue water remains quiet and I smile, yes, the answers are here to be found.  The water is peppered with surfers, sitting and waiting for the perfect wave.  The people on the pier look at them and see they are looking out into the vastness and seem to be waiting for someone to come over the horizon.  They look at the surfers, then look at the horizon, then look back at the surfers as if their body language or facial expressions would convey something to them.  The wind was picking up now, and the waves were getting bigger.  They began to slam into the pier and break into the pillars underneath.  It began to sway with the water, quite dramatically.  I took a quick intake of breath and said….it’s not an earthquake….it’s not an earthquake.  I stood there until the sun went down thinking about how perfect a moment can be, spent in silence and absent intense thought.  This night on my drive, I drove through Point Loma and Ocean Beach.  I got lost a half a million times, but that just took me through the little beach side neighborhoods with the small cute little Spanish houses with big paned windows and chairs on every front porch.  Ocean Beach has remained a little beach city.  Quirky and real, not dressed up and sophisticated.  Great place.  I told the Boy all about it.  I wanted to write him with every detail.  I sat in my car, right the boardwalk wall…almost right at water’s edge.  There was a pier on my left that had some stragglers.  It was late at night, but even so, PB would not be this quiet.  I watched the water lap up over the sand in the yellow-orange lights that stood tall above the boardwalk.  The water was so close and the light hit just so, that the water looked fat and puffy and round, like the stickers we put on things as children in school.   In this minute, I was absorbed.  I was one with the rhythm of the water.  My mind was clear.  It was brilliant.

       “….When love beckons to you follow him, Though his ways are hard and steep….But if in your fear you would seek only love's peace and love's pleasure, Then it is better for you that you cover your nakedness and pass out of love's threshing-floor, But if you love and must needs have desires, let these be your desires: To melt and be like a running brook that sings its melody to the night. To know the pain of too much tenderness. To be wounded by your own understanding of love; And to bleed willingly and joyfully. To wake at dawn with a winged heart and give thanks for another day of loving; To rest at the noon hour and meditate love's ecstasy; To return home at eventide with gratitude; And then to sleep with a prayer for the beloved in your heart and a song of praise upon your lips.” –  Kahlil Gibran , “The Prophet”    Monday .  It’s funny.  When you throw a question into the universe, she often is compelled to answer.  Or, at least make you consider the question more deeply.   I wonder, can it be true?  Eric Clapton fills the room.  I listen to him so much when writing the Boy and writing about the Boy that now this music reminds me of him.  Tonight, “Come Back Baby” provides the soundtrack to this post.  Bluesy, sad, all about pain and love.  Thank the goddess for blues…for music.  What a difference a day makes.  The sunflowers are dying.  Just started today.  Desperately seeking comfort today…can’t find solace…it eludes me.  Want to order Japanese food, nourish body and soul.  Decide against it to save money.  Looking for solace in the really small details….painting toenails, long bath, cold beer and a hockey game – can’t follow through.  Maybe it’s even more primal then that, simply just letting myself be.  Swimming in my thoughts.  Readjusting in little ways the negative thoughts fighting it out for attention.  Curling up in cool soft white sheets and down comforter.  Feels like sleeping in a cloud.  Safe place.  Soft place to land.  Let my mind relax and do it’s work as I drift off.  Figuring out one step to the next is where we are today.  Nothing got done, outside of the most urgent, and I try to find ways to live inside my skin.  Feeling disconnected and swimmy.  Spinny and lost.  It’s painful to be in my skin right now.  This ache that remains undefined.  Utter inability to make decisions, much less comprehend what took place in that long distance phone call.  Swirling options around – like tea leaves in a cup – looking for the right one.  I know which one I want, but if someone pushes you away over and over…maybe it’s time to go?  I don’t like the possibilities right now, so I take to laptop to see if something surfaces.  What I know, all I know, is that I long for this day to end.  I long for the details to soothe me.  I desperately search for comfort.  I’m not sure how much is worse than uncertainty without immediate opportunity to sort it out.   I don’t want tea or any food.  I don’t want to work out or sit here.  Wretched indecision.  Persistent flowing of deep liquid sting and emptiness.  All of me feels raw and tender.  Existence of turmoil is part of our lives.  I accept that I put myself in this position by putting myself out there to someone who felt uncertain on his feet.  I do not regret one minute.  I do not hate him or wish for any harm to come to him.  But, I do not understand how we got to this place.  I say, please baby, think before you say these things…as you bounce around with your thoughts, working out your feelings out loud on these subjects, you take me with you…and I have no way to know if what you are saying it what you really feel and want, or something you are hashing out.  I’m not sure how to go on from here.  I do not believe in putting up walls, but I am human and my psyche feels the need to protect itself.  In my experience, things only get worse when we are on the defensive.  Put yourself in it, do it full on, or walk away.  How are these my options today when yesterday it was whether or not I wanted to come see him at the beginning or middle of July, and what phone card to buy so I could call him less expensively?  If I can’t get out of my skin, I’ll get out of the house.  A drive is most definitely in order.  Clear my head a little perhaps.  If that is not to be, at least I can find a new framework to look at the situation.  The Boy is good.  He’s one of, if not the best boy – really, I call him that, but he is in every way a Man – I’ve ever met.  Talking with him about our possibilities…our feelings…what the future holds…has never been easier.  :::laughing:::  Maybe I jinxed it because I told him that I was in awe of his ability to talk of all things relationship without panic.  Some part of his boy brain gasped and realized it wasn’t on the ball.  I know two things.  This morning, after the all night phone call, I realized how strong my feelings were.  I was shocked by them, but I accept whatever they bring.  This is a gift to me, no matter where it goes.  I honestly believe nothing bad can ultimately come from having him in my life.  Even if it all ends today.  So, the two things I know are firstly, I must know where this goes.  I must see where it can end up.  I cannot, I will  not  let fear rule me.  I will not let it rob me of something bright and joyful and unique.  Secondly, I will not let his fear rule me either.  I will help and support in whatever way I can.  But I cannot let him pull me through his thought process and indecision.  He will have to commit to seeing what happens, or commit to walking away.  I have no control over what he chooses, but I do hope it’s not the latter.  I wonder, is that too harsh?  Does the true generous spirit walk on his journey with him until he can see it for himself?  Maybe I don’t know two things.  Maybe I know one thing here and there…a half a thing.  I know right now that the alternative to working through these challenges and this fear is to never know what we could be…what we could have.  I find that unacceptable.  I have few regrets when it comes to love because I think it needs to play itself out, and I’ve always followed my heart.  Yes, I get hurt.  It is only pain.  Not famine or war or poverty or illness.  It’s painful to walk away too, but with that you don’t ever know what could have been.  This is what I mean when I say I will not give into fear.  Such is my day.  Perfect.  And my team just lost to DALLAS.  :::cussing:::  So, tonight, to refocus, I will give you my intentions.  I intend to do something really nice for myself tomorrow.  Maybe a lot of somethings.  I intend to be true to my heart, my spirit, and my integrity.  I intend to give this Boy one last “get out of jail free” card, because I know this is new for him and he is struggling…and he is good.  However, I intend to be strong and take care of myself and my best interests.  I intend to do something girlie and unnecessary tomorrow.  I intend to do everything on my calendar tomorrow.  I intend to be gentle with myself tonight and take my own advice.  I intend to let it be okay that I don’t know how to solve this just yet and that I am indecisive.  “Life responds when we risk.”  - Rodney Smith, “Lessons From the Dying.”  It always come back to this.

       “Things which matter most must never be at the mercy of things which matter least.” –  Johann Wolfgang von Goethe     Sunday.   I’m so restless today.  Last night, too.  Can’t sleep, can’t read, can’t watch tv, can’t write.  I can’t focus on any one thing for too long.  I can’t figure out why.  I flit around from thing to thing, like a fire fly or honey bee…but can’t stay put or stop the humming in my body and my brain.  It’s not physical energy exactly.  Cosmic energy.  I wonder if it’s stress due to the long holiday weekend and me not being able to work out the situation with the landlord until Monday or Tuesday.  I wonder if it’s being in job transition again.  I wonder if it’s that the migraine and lack of sleep of a few days ago have left me far behind in just errand and chores, and now I feel overwhelmed.  I’m forgetting things.  Having a hard time making sentences and retrieving words.  Can’t make decisions.  Part of this may be the brain injury.  I think, these things that seem to be present inside me on some molecular level, are only part of the story.  The other part, is the Boy.   I don’t know how people cope with the distance.  I need some real face time.  I need to feel his hands on me, hear his breathing in the same room…no computer or telephone between us.  My blood is running hot right now.  I feel the energy in my body calling out for him.  These thousands of miles between us,  these continents between us…seem like planets…and all the plans for me to go see him, although not that far away, seem like lifetimes away at the moment.  I don’t know how people do it.  I’m glad that it’s the navy he’s in so he may have the option to be stationed here, if he doesn’t get out.  I pace around on the phone and talk to him about everything.  He says, “Baby, go to sleep.”  I can’t, I tell him, my mind is so restless, my body is burning up.  I miss you.  I need you here.  I just want you home.  Things move fast with us, and it scares me, but it never has felt so easy and natural to discuss all of this.  What we want, the future.  If I’m wrong, if we are wrong and the future is not what we planned, I will be hurt and ache for the time when we didn’t know.  But, I wouldn’t trade away this time with him now, as much as I just want him here with me.  The letters, the sweet words, the phone calls until the middle of the night…it’s all so precious.  And fragile.    He takes care of me, even from planets away.  He asks me if I ate today.  I have to think.  I forget to eat all the time.  I forget to buy the right things when shop.  One day, maybe, there will be a boy to help me remember.  He says, I’ll cook for you…I’ll make sure you eat.  Never in my life have I allowed someone to take care of me.  Defense mechanism, I think.  I never really had someone to count on, so I just decided there was no one and I have to do it myself.  On some level, I feel weak letting someone take care of me.  With him, I let down my defenses enough to let him in…to show the vulnerability I try to hide so much.  I can say, baby, can you do this for me?  I can’t figure it out.  And, he will do it and say, here sweet Temple, it’s done.  He says I take care of him so well, even with the space between us.  How can I not?  It’s all so brilliant.  Some disagreements are part of the deal, especially when you live online and in email and on the phone.  We don’t really fight.  We handle it well.  Feelings are considered, the goal is to solve it, not to be right.  I wonder, can it be true?  Can this relationship really exist like this?  I know we won’t know for sure until we are back together again, living day to day, in the same city for a while.  For now, I make the decision not to fight it.  To let him take care of me and me of him, best we can in this situation.  I will always cherish this time with and without him.  It’s terribly romantic, no?

       “Insist on yourself; never imitate. Your own gift you can present every moment with the cumulative force of a whole life's cultivation; but of the adopted talent of another you have only an extemporaneous half possession...  Do that which is assigned to you, and you cannot hope too much or dare too much.” -  Ralph Waldo Emerson    Little words of big meaning nipping my heels this day.  Someone asked me what I was looking for in a man.  I thought for a minute, and responded that I was looking for the same qualities in any person:  integrity, their ability to be true to self, and ability to be open-minded.  True, there are many little qualities that I think of in assessing a man.  The reality is, that when it comes right down to it, only a few core characteristics should mean something.  This applies whether this is a new friend or a new lover.  We get caught up in the shell of a person.  Their materialistic or superficial attributes.  Think of how many people have passed us by because we didn’t fit their “criteria.”  How many we’ve passed by.  I know I was guilty of it.  I’d like to think less so now.  Looks, money, status, power.  These things dictate our social circles and our job choices so much.  Look at reality TV.  I think it’s cruel and exploitive most times.  Watching it we seem to be giving permission to treat people like game pieces.  I want to look at integrity, genuiness, kindness, and success as a person (growth and introspection) when I decide if someone should be a part of my life.    Sometimes we have to get beyond the image of something.  In love, we decide that we must be with a person who looks a certain way, does something specific, has certain hobbies ….etc…. But, love is beyond our control and if we try to force it, it will crumble.  Our souls recognize each other.  Sometimes this is something to be wary of.  Others it means that this is a person to pay attention to.  It is often said that beauty is only skin deep, and that true beauty is inside.  We dismiss this.  But the people who can give you what you need often don’t come in the packages you look for.  In fact, the very package you are looking for may be unhealthy for you…may not even exist.  The superficial may be fun and excitement, but not long term joy.  This is not to say that looking for what we want is wrong or bad…there is no wrong or bad.  It is to say that sticking to a strict definition of what we should be, our spouses  and lovers should be, our house should be, our job should be…can only lead to heartbreak.  There is little or no flexibility there, and that which does not give will break or tear.  We are all looking for the same things.  We are all fundamentally the same.  This is Buddhist philosophy, and something that the Dalai Lama says quite frequently in lectures.  It means that we all want to be happy and loved and safe.  If I help you find safety…if I love you…if I help you on your pursuit of happiness, then I help myself.  To live in this bubble where only the money or body or status or title matter, is an empty one at best.  It’s wonderful to achieve the things you want, as long as the balance remains.  As long as we remember that companionship of good, strong, authentic people and establishing home and heart are what will really bring us warmth in our long lives.  The daily grind can find us so empty.  Look beyond the shell of a person and see their heart and true character.    I saw this girl tonight, beautiful girl, talking on her cell phone and walking.  Perfect hair, gorgeous face, perfect clothes right down to her little purse.  She walked toward me and I smiled.  She looked at her perfectly manicured toes.  It would be so easy so assume that this girl has it all…money, style, looks…by our standards today.  As she passed I heard her say, “My whole life is falling apart.  I don’t know what I’m supposed to do, because everything is a mess.  It’s all wrong.”  After a minute or so she said, “It’s not that easy just to get it together, you know?  What do you expect me to do?”  The person on the other end of the telephone didn’t hear that she was lost, or that she needed support and guidance.   I felt for her, because to the outside world – and even maybe those that know her – she had that image of having it all together.  They don’t know what to do when she doesn’t have it all together.  I’ve been there.  I’m often the one people come to with problems.  When it’s my turn, they don’t know what to do or what to say because I’m the one who “has it together.”  When I started to put my real self out in the world and stopped looking at the shell of the person, I began to see some of the most beautiful people I’ve ever known.  People who can support and love me the way I’ve always wanted.  Who don’t see me by only one definition, therefore allowing me to open up to the real me more.  This beautiful girl walking by me just shows this image we all seem to strive for, and what now be in her way from getting real support, and she may not even know that there is another way.

       “Here's to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The trouble-makers. The round heads in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. They're not fond of rules, and they have no respect for the status-quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify, or vilify them. But the only thing you can't do is ignore them. Because they change things. They push the human race forward. And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do.” - "Think Different" Advertisement, Apple Computers   I cringed a bit at leaving a quote from an ad, but I really like it.  We, the artist and the writers and the free-thinkers, we are the ones who inspire and document change.  The crazy ones.  The misfits.  Even if you are a stock broker, and you shake things up and look outside the box, you can earn that title.  It’s an honor.  I want a plaque.  I’ve been writing almost nonstop it seems for the past two days.  My journal, the computer, napkins, maps, whatever.  Between blogit’s meltdown and my ever changing emotional state, it’s been hard to finish anything worth posting.  I’ve been through a couple of days with the crazy angries, the poor me’s, Fred’s nonstop ranting about something or other, and some impromptu crying on the floor of the closet.  I seem to end up there a lot, but there has been impromptu crying just about everywhere.  There has been driving 100 miles an hour down the freeway during a wretched, bright sunny day.  No mercy that sun.  That’s a blues song, isn’t it?  Or maybe a country song?  Anyway, I realized that a lot of what had to be hashed out had to be done in trusty blue leather journal, on phone with best friend, in my overworked and harried mind, and in emails with S. and online chats with D.  I do like sharing these things with you, because something that is so painful is easier to bear when it brings someone else even the teensiest bit of inspiration or clarity.  However, it’s not just my story, it’s his story, too, and at a point I felt like he should not have to read all about it on the internet.  Hurting him will never do, no matter our status.  Blue leather journal and best friend have missed me.  It is indeed complicated.  Remember that story from “Winnie the Pooh” – the Blustery Day – where Piglet is blowing away, holding on to the string of a balloon?  That’s me, and that balloon is a different emotion every five minutes…well, sometimes longer.  I’m angry, sad, accepting, resigned, crazy.  And then, like Pooh to the rescue, he can say a word or a sentence…just something little…and Fred can’t even argue.  A minute of bliss for Temple and Fred…has tea.  Sweet relief.  I have much resolve.  Me strong like bull.  But, sweet words from boy make it easier to be in my skin.    In the midst of navigating the choppy unrelenting waters of uncertainty, I have been making some progress.  I sit down at laptop to write hour by hour schedule.  I crinkle my nose, stick tongue out at laptop, walk away.  The reason for this schedule is to help me build memory and organization skills, as well as helping me just know what needs to be done and prioritize.  All things we all take for granted unless the day comes where they were knocked right outta your head.  I put the kettle on and stand in the kitchen, looking out the window.  I cross my arms over my body, like I’m cold, and tuck my chin into the crook of my elbow.  My hair falls into my face.  I don’t want this schedule.  Being in San Diego makes me miss the old me.  I can’t seem to come to terms with her demise.  I live downtown, and as I drive around I see women dressed up, coming over to the mall for lunch from the Hall of Justice and the old courthouse.  I know they are attorneys, many district attorneys, I recognize the badges around their necks.  I have one just like it, tucked away somewhere from another lifetime.  I watch them talk, so animated with big gestures.  I miss it.  I miss everything about it.  The long hours.  Suits.  My blue suede pumps.  Even pantyhose.  Late night trial strategy with Thai food.  This is law school, too.  Once you get past your first year, being a lawyer is the same almost…if you do those kind of internships, which I did.  Endless sleepworking hours living on adrenaline and caffeine and fear.  Spending hours in the stacks, shepardizing (oh god – don’t ask, it’s horribly tedious and I still miss it…I liked doing research the old fashioned way instead of on the computer), stacks of yellow highlighters and endless amounts of legal pads.  Weekends spent on the library floor in sweats and no make up with my trial partner, putting a case together for competition, laughing ourselves stupid because we’re so punchy and something just set us off.  Missing lunch preparing for court and going into court with an ice cream headache from eating frozen yogurt in 3 ½ seconds.  Being called counselor or Madame Prosecutor.  Arguing with long haired public defenders in the hallway over counts and degrees and plea agreements.  I miss juggling 30 page legal briefs, 100 pages of reading a week, writing my column for the paper, quizzes, trial team, interning, laundry…maybe a boyfriend…and going out on the weekends to blow off steam.  We used to have a joke about no talking shop on the weekends.  When we went out, if someone asked what we did we said we were in management school at the Debbie Field’s Cookie College (it really exists).  This was good for me, because most guys when you say…I’m a lawyer…or I’m in the DA’s office…or whatever, often times they glass over.   It’s sad to say, but happens all the time.  Inevitably, we’d end up in some big discussion about the first amendment and the media…juvenile tried as adults…cross-examination techniques.  That got better as we went on in school, less of those, more play.  Now, I have to make a schedule to remember to go to the store and write stuff on my arm if I have no paper.  I miss my old self.  I miss my old brain.  I miss it desperately sometimes so much that the ache for it becomes nearly tangible.  I have no options to practice law now, I’m not the same.  I like different things, my lifestyle is different, I don’t have the same brain function I had before the accident.  People want to be positive and say I can do it, but I can’t.  I tried for four years.  I don’t think I miss it enough to go back anyway, because this is where I’m supposed to be in my life.  I just can’t seem to find where exactly and how exactly and who exactly I am.  I take my tea back to laptop and make up, sorry, yeah, I was rash.  The schedule is made and followed, not perfectly, but definitely progress.  I am still learning how to estimate time and all of that.  I have a really fun errand today.  The brain injury does wonderful things….nightmares and anxiety, to name two.  Since I don’t have insurance out here and have yet to get all my accident treatment stuff situated, red tape and all that, I have to find ways to fill this anxiety medication they give me.  They have one system for medical, which, after jumping through all necessary hoops, I find out will most likely not fill this prescription because it’s related to psychiatric.  Huh?  So, much time passes and I find that I need to jump through more hoops to get it handled.  The first stop, is the Emergency Psychiatric Unit.  Scuse me?  Voluntary, like, right?  No one will say, you and…Fred?  Yep, she’s nuts.  I go there, sans makeup and in the grungies with a backpack full of my journal, my walkman, a book…blah blah, prepared for a long day.  I get there and security searches my backpack and chit chats with me about the war and random odd bits.  I walk into this horrid pink hallway.   There is a concrete “chair rail” that separates this salmon/red/orange color that is painted from the rail to the floor, about four feet.  The floor is gray speckled linoleum, with peeling seems and corners.  I go through another door, into the actual emergency room (it’s connected to the locked unit).  Gray chairs are lined up along the walls, and everything is very sterile and institutional.  No magazines or silly posters about Prozac or other such things.  Just signs about the red line and don’t yell at us if someone is called in out of order of appearance.  There are two people waiting, I think this is good, but what do I know.  The thing about being around truly mentally ill people, is that normal rules don’t apply.  I worked as a mental health worker, and it is somewhat liberating.  On my worst day, me and Fred are usually the most together people in the room.  I like that feeling now and then.  Plus, these folks often like to chat.  They are helpful and talkative and often quite lovely.  I don’t feel weird there, well, until the receptionist hands me the little plastic cup and the brown paper bag.  I thought, wait, where am I?  The girl sitting in the chairs behind me giggles and says, they make everyone do it.  Upon handing this to me, a discussion in the room and behind the glass starts up about what to do…where to go…where the little cupboard is…not to forget the number on the sticky note on the cup in the bag.  Geez.    A couple of hours later after endless ups and downs, paperwork, questions, and people telling me how nice it is to have someone pleasant in their office – I got the impression this job was somewhat loony and difficult – finally I see a social worker for this assessment.  She asks me all the federally required questions.  I make her laugh, she tells me I’m pleasant.  That’s the thing, I loved a lot of my patients.  Miss them in fact (feel guilty because just remembered I was supposed to send postcards).  Crazy people, mentally ill, my people in most ways, can be great.  But, I guess a guy petting an imaginary cow in your office might be stressful.  I was told some stories.  Finally, 3 ½ hours later (apparently that was short of the 5 to 6 hours of normal), I walk out of there with an appointment and tons of paperwork.  Small note, I found out today that, yes, in fact, my primary care doctor CAN fill anxiety medication and yes, the pharmacy WILL fill it for free.   I was sad that morning… screamed through some crazy angries…and ended up having conversations with almost every single person in that room.  Patient and staff.  They all think I’m pleasant.   This is one of those days that you could say was a bad day, but I got to meet some really cool people and write all day…and got some of my stuff handled in the process.   Good day, indeed.  I drive sensibly on the way home, and write until bedtime.  I figure if I can have a good day in the midst of a bad day, I’m still doing alright.

       “Finish every day and be done with it. You have done what you could. Some blunders and absurdities no doubt have crept in; forget them as soon as you can. Tomorrow is a new day; begin it well and serenely and with too high a spirit to be cumbered with your old nonsense. This day is all that is good and fair. It is too dear, with its hopes and invitations, to waste a moment on yesterdays.” -  Ralph Waldo Emerson    Wake up this morning, in the morning, alarm blaring.  Went to bed early for me last night.  My trauma specialist wants me to set an hour by hour schedule, but it usually takes a week or so to implement.  Before I could hit the snooze button, I feel the loss for the boy aching in my belly…the missing of him has already begun.  I’m glad to feel scheduled today.  It’s almost bliss…blissful distraction anyway.  I have an appointment at noon to get fingerprinted for a potential job.  My fingerprints are on file so many places between the different boards of law examiners, FBI, Dept. of Justice, Secret Service, the county…for different jobs or security clearances.  It feels funny having to do it again.  I’m up and talking with kitties.  Fresh water in bowls, opening windows and blinds to disappointed fuzzy expressions at the lack of a good sunbeam to roll around in, putting on the kettle.  I turn on CNN and make myself crazy for a few minutes trying to catch up on world news, specifically Life in Baghdad.  I’m moving quickly today, letting thought only wander over whether or not I should get coffee before my fingerprinting (which means trying to find parking downtown) or to wait after and fuel up before the rest of my errands.  I decide on the latter, and grab my girl shaped (hour glass that is) cobalt blue starbucks travel mug.  Instead it’s raspberry green tea for me this gloomy morning.  It’s bright crisp scent brings a little pop into the artificially lit kitchen.  Putting dishes away, reminding myself to eat and grabbing a protein bar for the road.  I never get enough protein.  Maybe there will be another boy who loves to cook and who will make sure I do.  Thoughts are quickly dismissed, shooed away, so as not to fall into their soft, sad familiarity.  In the old days, a broken heart from a boy meant girls’ nights out, too much tequila, and finding new boys to kiss.  When I wasn’t doing that, I would sleep…missing class or work, writing in journals, retreating into my pain until it controlled me.  Today I feel grateful to find a rhythm that allows productivity.  I know it won’t be there always.  There is always crying.  I just go about my day with puffy eyes and sniffly demeanor.  Thank the goddess for makeup.  I hope that it continues and that there is not a retreat into the pain, but I realized that there might be.  I feel it looming there, threatening.  I am not hungry and I feel sick.  For this moment at least, I have beaten it.    I turn on the computer to review my schedule and check my mail…and put a few instant words down on screen.  I see there are emails in my inbox, but I delay checking it.  I used to do that in a “save the best for last” kind of way.  Now I do it for fear of either result:  that’s he’s written, or that he hasn’t.  If he has, will I be sad by what he says, and that painful throbbing will win?  If he hasn’t, will that be the breaking point?  I put it off, shoo thoughts away again, find solace in warm, sweet, raspberry magic (it really is) and change the channel.  This lasts for a minute and a half.  I decide to check.  He did write me yesterday, his today.  But, of course, I think fast and type fast and already responded.  I check and he has not written again, and I begin to wonder if it wasn’t this expectation of mine sitting here, with me, right now, that didn’t make him crazy.  He is sweet and says that it isn’t me, that he is restless (in yesterday/today’s email).  I want too much, I guess.  Who the hell knows, really?  Ah, here it is.  Old familiar.  Body and spirit want to go back to bed.  Instead, I suffer the sun’s intolerant enthusiasm and open blinds for happy faced bounding kitties as a sunbeam makes its way into the room.  There is salvation in my inbox thought, two letters from S. making me laugh as she always does.  She questions herself, too.  I find comfort in that.  Bella said in comments yesterday "…intensity doesn't prosper over distance….”  I agreed wholeheartedly at first.  But, I started to think about it yesterday, and realized in this case she is absolutely right.  But, I thought since there was distance, that intensity was good.  Like if you are trying to say something to someone in the same room, you speak normally.  When you are trying to say something to someone on the back porch and you are in the kitchen, you have to shout.  I thought, this boy is far away and in a sad, dark place.  I felt the need to go an extra mile or 20.  He appreciates this, he says it…I know it’s true, but did it cost me?

       “Your joy is your sorrow unmasked.  And the selfsame well from which your laughter rises was oftentimes filled with your tears. And how else can it be? When you are joyous, look deep into your heart and you shall find it is only that which has given you sorrow that is giving you joy. When you are sorrowful look again in your heart, and you shall see that in truth you are weeping for that which has been your delight. Together they come, and when one sits alone with you at your board, remember that the other is asleep upon your bed.”  -  Kahlil Gibran , “The Prophet”   Afternoon started with thoughtful waking and pounding head.   Boy’s days being my nights lead to many late night/early morning phone calls.  I don’t mind really.  I’m happy that I get to talk to him at all.  This “morning” brings instant memories of heavy conversation.  I don’t know how people do the distance thing.  Boy doesn’t show emotion in his voice.  He has this great slow, southern, sexy voice (except when he’s trying to make silly voices – which he does badly – or bursting into song) and this great laugh.  I could listen to him talk forever.  I guess that’s part of my problem because he hates phones.  Even when we are talking about heavy things or having an argument, there is usually humor and his great laugh.  Instantly, usually, diffuses the situation for me a little.  He says that makes him feel better that I can laugh and say something funny.  I agree.  Usually fights are fights and jokes are unwelcome.  There is an ease between us, even when I want to ring his neck, that always makes me somewhat mystified.  But, this distance, this nearly 5000 miles away, feels like planets away and takes its toll.  Men and women already have enough differences in style and perception and communication to make this relationship thing intricate and thorny.  Since we can’t see each other in person right now, we have letters and email and the phone.  I know any of you who have tried to do the distance thing know that email and online chat can be the devil.  Misinterpretation and no inflection.  Most of the time, email is a brilliant thing for us, but it’s not enough to carry on day to day.  Letters take 10 days or so.  That leaves the phone.  Boy starts to get all itchy and scratchy at being on the phone too much (not to mention calling from or to Iceland is costing us both a pretty penny).  That makes him analyze his feelings and maybe he should feel differently on the phone.  I said to him this morning, do you realize that you are complaining about the telephone being the issue here?  He laughed, and said, well it sounds funny when you say it like that.  I said, like what?  In a sentence?  I cannot pretend to understand this, but I will tease him about it.  It hurts me in a way that girl’s understand, like, I don’t get it…if you can’t talk to me in person why you wouldn’t want to talk to me on the phone?  If you were home, we’d be able to talk in person and you could just do the normal thing with the phone.  Small and insignificant details take on monumental proportions when magnified by distance and stress and circumstance.  A small reprieve to explain a few things.  The Boy is billy_cargo.  We have been incognito.  Some of the writing about him in the past hasn’t been in real time, but now you will learn about us.  We thought it was fun to just write and comment like we didn’t really know each other, but now circumstances have changed and we want to just write what we feel.  Or, that was the original discussion.  Billy is often a mystery to me.  As some of you may know, Billy is a naval officer stationed in Iceland.  However, he just got word that he will be going to Iraq within the next few weeks.  He will be in Baghdad, on the base mostly, we think.  The same base that takes regular mortar and sniper fire.  The same base he will have to commute to from Kuwait, most likely by one of those convoys you hear so much about where people are kidnapped and blown up.  Because he is a naval officer, with no combat training mind you, and not Army or Marines, I feel better that at least he’s not on patrol.  But no one is safe there, as we’ve seen recently, and I can’t bear the thought of him not coming home to me.  The only good news is that he may be able to get orders to be stationed in San Diego after his tour is over and he finishes out Iceland (they are actually making him go back).  I am sick with the idea that I may lose him.  People say to be positive and not think about it, but that’s easier said then done.  I just will make sure he knows how I feel about him and can take that with him.  I won’t see him for about 7 months or so.  I want to make sure he has everything he needs while he’s gone and that I can be as much about stress relief for him as possible.  I want him to be as focused as he can be, and not worry about me or home too much.   I think, if we can stick it out and just hang on through Baghdad, I can see him in Iceland – maybe for Christmas – and solve all our problems face to face.  Renew.  Find answers with the tips of fingertips and with the lack of space between us.  Regroup for the months following that until he’s back home with me.  A latte with a few moments to jot thought down on laptop and it’s off to a long, hot shower.  You know the kind where there is no hurry, it’s a shower just because, not just because  you have to hurry your ass up to get out the door.  Lavender and cucumber-melon smells fill the room and I breathe deep.  Try to wash away the stress and pain and complication of this endlessly bewildering situation.  I stand there, letting the hot water beat against my hair as my thoughts swim away to where my boy is.  It’s so hard to know what to do.  I know this situation with us is new to him.  I know that someone like me, who treats him like I do, is new to him.  I try so hard to give him what he needs to feel secure and safe.  Maybe I’ve made him feel too secure.  Maybe that’s just some bullshit people say when talking about the relationship game.  I take care of myself too, ask for what I need…do what I need to do.  That’s why, right now, I’ve asked him not to call me for a few days.  I’m too hurt, too emotional.  I’m so confused by him.  He pulls me close with one hand, pushes me away with the other.  I don’t know what he needs anymore, or how explain what I need.  The words fail me.  I just want to get through it, so he can go and come back.  So we can get on with our lives.  So we can see what it all really means.  I don’t know how to do that, at this point.  I know he is hurting, too.   I realized in our last conversation, that everything is up for question.  While I was so busy making sure that he was feeling secure with us being far apart, all the things that come with that, he was drinking it up…getting swept away…and now, we seem to be on different pages of different books.  It seems impossible to bridge this gap with letters and email, and ole’ itchy and scratchy making telephone calls sound like Chinese bamboo torture.  He’s asleep now.  It’s deep in the night in Iceland, and the sun has finally set, giving him the darkness he wants so badly.  This time of day is the hardest time for me.  It’s only 5:00 p.m. here, and I know I can’t talk to him or won’t get email for him.  The normal time for us to be together on the beach with the dog or he’d be talking about what to make for supper (he has me saying supper now…dinner, dinner).  He’s better at all things domestic than I am.   Or if it were yesterday, cloudy and cool and rainy, we’d still be in bed…Chris Isaak on the stereo (okay, you win this one).  When I’m thinking about going to bed, he’ll be getting up and going to work to do the turnover in preparation for his tour.  Now, I go about the day to day.  Wander around the house, no lights on, sunlight lights up the room just enough.  Not too much to taunt me.  Yerba Matte and chamomile tea with milk and honey….strong and sweet to align my chakras (according to my Aunt) and calm my nerves.  No Iceland morning/late night conversation with boy answering phone in navy speak tomorrow.  No confusing his secretary by saying his wife is calling, with Billy’s mischievous smile and no word on the subject.  No “good morning lieutenant” from me and real time email.  He’s preparing to go off to war, and I can’t help but feel I’m being selfish and unkind to take this time to myself.  When life presents intense circumstances, it can scramble up the purest of feelings and best of intentions.  We say, baby, I don’t know…I just don’t know.  And, I just want us together again, just let me be there and hold you.  That pull to be together, to rearrange the universe and damn all the circumstances and make it happen.  Damn the war.  Damn the navy.  Damn the distance.  Damn all of it.  What is that?  Is it love?  Is the fear stronger?  Will he succeed at pushing me away?  Deep down, I think I know the answers.  I think I know what’s in his heart.  Could that just be ego, or self-protection?  More questions than answers these days.  I have a full plate out here with projects and job hunting and finding a rehab team for my shoulder and noggin.  I sip my tea and look out the window, thinking about this boy.  When someone is afraid to love, unsure how to love, unsure of what it is in it’s pure sense, and as a result locks himself away in a painful, lonely space, what is the one who is not afraid to do?  Is it best to protect, alter behavior, be cautious?  Or is it better to sit with the pain and fear of being pushed away and be gentle and loving, and risk even more?   If someone out there knows the answers, there’s a cookie in it for you.  Every time I write words of that nature above…should I do option a or option b…this song by Eric Clapton comes on, “Running On Faith.”  I put the words at the bottom.    I started writing this yesterday, and now we are not only onto separate books, but separate volumes.  Billy and I spoke today, which we weren’t going to do.   He was so very far away.  Distant and cold.  I felt like I had no business there, like the store was closed to me and me only.  I couldn’t read him, and went to a protective, defensive stance.  Not a good conversation.  Not a good result.  He’s decided that I, us, this is too much for him right now.  I have been a ping pong ball with this the last few days, and I’m finally at my breaking point.  I feel like I’ve lived a lifetime with this man in 5 minutes, and now it’s over before I can finish sending out thank you notes for the wedding.  He saw an ugly side of me.  It’s funny.  When all we want to do is love and feel better, but we are hurt, that protective side of us finds ways to cope with things that we really don’t want.  This is really my fault.  My friends say, no, it was fine until Iraq.  I think there’s some truth to that.  I think if he hadn’t gotten orders, or whatever since basically he volunteered (although if he hadn’t, we believe he would have been ordered, at least this way he has some leverage hopefully), he would have been able to handle this until this summer.  Us being together sooner rather than later helped him put his mind at ease.  But that’s not all of it.  I pushed too hard maybe, wanted too much, felt too much.  All I want is for him to be happy.  Ideally, that happens with him and me together.  But, if not, if me walking away and letting him be free is what he wants, that’s what he will have.  That ugly little protector guy, we will call him Fred, is in my head saying all those things that produce guilt and telling Billy that he’s wrong and I feel stupid and blah blah blah.  Fred needs some valium.  Or a bonk on the noggin perhaps.    The bottom line is this:  I feel what I feel for this man who is good and real and lovely and smart.  I expressed it.  I stand in the elevator today all teary eyed and say, oh Temple, you are so fucking stupid.  You just put it all out there, no defenses, for him to reject or stomp on.  You made it too easy for him.  The reality though is only Fred feels that way.  I feel like the person I am in my heart, the person I want to be, and the person I wanted to share with Billy.  I wanted to be open and real and let it all be develop and be what it was going to be.  So, here it is.  I miss him.  It hurts to breathe.  I don’t know what will happen.  He still wants to be stationed in San Diego.  He’s still talking about Iceland after the tour, but I feel him wavering on that, too.  I only know that I gave him everything I wanted to give him.  Everything he said, verbally or otherwise, that he needed (that I could figure out that he needed, I should say).  I was true to myself, to my heart, and with him 100%.   If this is it, if this is the end, I will never feel that I shouldn’t have done that.  I gave it all that I had with no regrets.  I can’t control what he did with it.  I will look at what I should have done differently, and perhaps after some time has passed and Fred calms the hell down, I can realize what I did that pushed him away.  He said he doesn’t want me to be out of his life.  That he needs my help to get through Iraq.  But, that he doesn’t want me to wait for him.  I get the impression he’s either met someone else or wants to.  He says, no.   Men say funny things when they are trying to break things up with a woman but they don’t want to hurt her.  I don’t know if he really wants me to write him, if he wants to still come to San Diego, or if he just says those things to pacify me.  Damn, I would hope not.  I would hope that I have earned more of his respect than that.  I know he’s going through a lot right now, but I will never understand how in the matter of 24-hours his feelings can change.  It must have been coming and he was faking his way through…or I really fucked up somehow.    These answers will not present themselves for some time.  So, for now, I sip vanilla latte (thank you Emma) and flip through pages of a magazine trying to regroup.  When that doesn’t work I go up to the sundeck on the roof and take in the lights and the sky…the endless and endlessly beautiful Coronado bridge.  I will take a few minutes and breathe, try to change the storyline in my head, get back to the list of tasks at hand.  Danny says, just live your life.  This is true and good advice, but when it hurts this much you just want to find a way to make it stop.  That’s when we do all that stupid stuff that we do, get all crazy and call a million times or drive by the house (no option there fortunately!).  That’s what Lifetime movies are all about.   Not today.  Not for me.  He wanted out, I let him go.  I just have to get myself through it, always in the back of my mind believing that it isn’t supposed to be this way.  That this is just a temporary glitch.     Sweet Billy, you asked today, if you were one of the good ones.  Look at me, standing here, telling you and the goddess and everyone, that yes, in fact, you are.  I will always know that, as your friend or lover, and will hold it until you know.  Just take care of yourself.  And….please please come back!  Think of Saylor and Petie and Scrapper!  What will we tell them!  :::laughing:::  Dammit Fred!  Too much caffeine.    Eric Clapton “Running on Faith”  Lately I've been running on faith What else can a poor boy do? But my world will be right When love comes over you  Lately I've been talking in my sleep I can't imagine what I'd have to say Except my world will be right When love comes back your way    I've always been   One to take each and every day   Seems like by now   I'd find a love who cares just for me  Then we'd go running on faith All of our dreams would come true And our world will be right When love comes over me and you

       “You do not have to be good.    You do not have to walk on your knees For A Hundred Miles through the desert repenting. You only have to let the soft animal of your body love what it loves.” -  Mary Oliver    I step in the shower, and the almost too-hot water beats down on my head, slicking my hair down to the middle of my back.  These are the moments that I get in trouble in the morning when it’s time to go to work.  I think, I have so much to do this morning, I’ll just take a quick shower.  Once I feel the water, I lose time and get out wondering why I’m such a big rush.  Today, there is no rush.  I remember a boyfriend from college, a fiancée actually.  We lived together, something I only agreed to after much persuasion and talk of marriage, because I didn’t want to deal with breaking up and moving out.  D, my first really grown up relationship.  I had several boyfriends before him, long term boyfriends, but this was dealing with getting married and life issues I had never dealt with before.  I was only 21 at the time and thought I was ready to get married.  I laugh at this now.  We lived in L.A. where D. worked for a trucking firm and I was in college.  He was 4 years older than me and a gifted artist.  He wanted to design cars, but never took any steps to make things happen for himself.  One of many in a line of men I would date that would tell me that I was too good for them, that they weren’t worthy.  D. was really good to me that first year.  He sent me 2 dozen white roses for Valentine’s Day.  We’d been dating for a few weeks, but I went out of town unexpectedly for my grandmother’s funeral.  The girls in the landlord’s office took care of them for me.  After that he gave me flowers upon flowers, every time they would die, he would bring me another.  He wrote love letters, penned on my floor while I studied or was coming home from work.  We were “old fashioned” and didn’t make love until after we said the “I love you’s.”  He had amazing manners, and taught me things he learned from his parents (who I loved to death).  One day, we were walking down the street by my apartment.  I was on the outside of the sidewalk near the street.  He put his arm around my waist and switched places with me.  I looked at him puzzled.  He said, a gentleman always escorts a lady on the street side.  D was 6’3”, 190, long chestnut hair (it was the 90’s, shut up), and gunmetal blue eyes.  This was too new.  He laughed at the look on my face.  Now, when I see men walking on the outside, and at times have seen them move the woman they are with to the inside, I smile and wonder how many people know that.  The second year, I kicked him out, we broke up for a while, he cheated on me two or three times (the last while we were planning a wedding).  I had a therapist who knew both of us (long story) who said she reminded him of Ted Bundy….charming, brilliant liar, conniving.  He wasn’t violent or anything, but his ability to lie and fuck with my head remains to this day, stunning.  Anyway, he would come home from work and grab a beer to take a shower.  He’d put the beer on the shower door frame.  When I was in a particularly difficult time in college, and was working at school until late at night, he would come in and put one on the shower frame for me.  This was particularly sweet because he had to be at work at 4:00 a.m., so when I got home from school at 10:30 or 11:00 at night, he’d be asleep.  He’d wake up, come in with the beer and set it down, open the door and kiss me, “love you bunny,” getting wet in the process.  Then go back to sleep.  Now, in the shower,  I look at my beer up there on the frame and laugh at what we keep from relationships.  That was the worst break up I’ve ever had, not that I loved him the most or was closest to him.  It was the first of this caliber of relationship.  When he moved out the living room was empty, my bed was empty, I didn’t know how to sleep in my own house.  I told myself then that I would never live with another man unless I was married.  Divorce happens, but at least with getting married maybe it’s not as easy to move out like that.  I kicked him out because he was sleeping with his ex-girlfriend and she had gone schizo and starting calling the house all the time.  I found letters from her saying it was good to see him, and half naked new pictures (they had dates in them).  We shared a tandem parking spot, so I had a key to his truck and often had to move it.  I dropped my purse inside one day and starting to pick things up.  I grabbed a piece of paper thinking it was mine that was poking out from underneath the mat, and found all of this girl’s letters.  The beginning of the end.  The next girl he cheated on me with used to call me and call me names.  ME.  Crazy ass chick.  I left him then, finally.  I found out from his friends later that he had some kind of breakdown and took out every picture and letter of mine/ours and had them laying all over the apartment.  He got in trouble at work, and almost lost the girl he cheated on me with.  He moved in with her and she wouldn’t let him go out with his friends.  His best friend, B. came up to me at a wrap party I was working when I worked at Capitol Records.  I was dressed to kill, it being an music industry event and all.  He apologized and said he got this girl and D. together because I was on D. to stop drinking and he didn’t like it.  I told D. I wanted him to quit the second time he drove his truck into something.  That doesn’t count the times he lost his truck, got lost somewhere coming home, spent rent money on beer, etc.  Then, my favorite part, B. asked me out telling me D. was missing out!  I laughed and walked away.  I learned a lesson about men that night, that’s for sure.  I walked away from that relationship knowing how to better take care of myself, taking a glass of water to bed every night (he always did that and I still do), calling my cat Mitty instead of Mittens, and on the road to learning what it means to listen to my instincts.  That is a long hard road indeed, but had I done that, that second year would have never happened.   It is all worth it though I think because I am who I am because of all the love, loss, pain, drama.  I’ve learned now how to not lose my mind completely at the down times.  I can hash things out and pour out my emotions, but that’s my survival mechanism.  It’s my thoughts and my process.  In my life outside of this I think of this, I think of these things and I acknowledge my feelings but my whole world doesn’t stop.  Maybe sometimes, maybe when fear gets a hold of my heart and squeezes….my blood runs cold…and I think I may be losing something I’ve waited forever to find.  The Boy says I’ve done so much and that I must find him boring.  I tell him he’s loopy.  He and his life are so different from mine and my experiences, it’s totally interesting to me.  Plus, I’m a different person now.  I want a man who knows the simple things in life.  Is tender and kind and honest.  Who knows his weaknesses and tries to work on them, compensate for them.  Who knows the beauty of a slow touch, a slow day.  I’ve done a lot and experienced a lot, this is true, but I’ve taken with me the ability to pinpoint what I want from my life, myself, a man.  By dating so many of the bad ones, I’ve learned to spot the good ones.

       “I have never been able to conceive how any rational being could propose happiness to himself from the exercise of power over others.” -  Thomas Jefferson    Unfortunately, this negative situation is snowballing.  So, I will clear the record with this situation with Passionflower, and then move on.  I have no interest in this little drama she has created.  I am working on getting a job, getting published, my Dad hears about the radiation treatment soon, and of course, my boy is going to Iraq.  I’m more interested in putting my energy into that and my friends and the work I do with animal rights, and so on, than her rants.  I will say this.  I stepped up to say that I felt she could be more tactful and diplomatic in her comments.  I did this because I felt her telling lost hillbilly that they must not teach reading and writing where he is to be disrespectful.  She says it’s important to speak up, but when I do it’s a huge drama.  I feel she is a very sad and lonely person with no other place to direct her energy.  I was nothing less than respectful in my comments.  However, now she has set up a new post to talk about how outraged I was, how I wanted an apology, etc.  The original blog and its comments have been deleted.   I never wanted an apology, I just stated my piece.  I was never outraged.  I just felt she could be more thoughtful (she responded to this by calling me a sissy baby).  I never said she was mean, I never needed any type of stroking from her (parish the thought) and I never wanted anything but to say what I did in defense of someone I think is a nice guy and doesn’t deserve to be treated as stupid.  This is not me being sensitive, this is me being compassionate and an adult…and voicing my beliefs.  I feel like speaking our minds and being truthful is no excuse to be cold and unfeeling and childish.  I will not play this game, it is beneath me.  I don’t care enough about this woman or her antics to be outraged or have my feelings hurt.  It is simply a gnat buzzing around my head, and I felt the need to clear it up.  I will not speak of it further, it is not worth my time.  Like I said, I have a job interview tomorrow….queries out…and I want to enjoy my boy before he’s too far away to hear his voice.  Passionflower, I know you are going through a divorce, and I am sorry for that.  I feel that you have some lovely qualities and I have read some of your writing that I really enjoyed.  I think, however, out of your sadness or emptiness you strike out.  If the comment I put in your post ended up in mine, I would have said, I did not mean to hurt anyone and thank you for your comment.  It’s that simple.  I stand up for myself and for those I care about.  Nothing you could say would make me feel badly about being a compassionate, strong, thoughtful person.  So please, let it go already.  This is not a competition.  At least it isn’t to me.  I’ve already won.  I have, or am working towards, what I want in my life.  I love writing here and have made wonderful friends, not to mention getting to share this space with Billy has been great.  I do not care about rank or any such business.  I write here for myself, to grow and learn, and for those who read me…even if it’s only five or 10 people.  I am secure about who I am, how I treat people.  I do not need validation from you.    This was just a quip to get it off my chest.  A real post will hopefully follow later.  But, to end this on a better note….today, I met a kitty.  I was walking to my car and walked past where I needed to turn to go to the parking lot.  I realized this, and cut through the side street to walk bayside.  Still blue water.  White boats.  Sun shining.  In the moment, all was alright in the world.  Just for a moment.  I hear a small voice, and look to see a white and brown Siamese mix….amazing blue eyes.  She spots me, and stops mid-move.  I squat down and extend my hand.  Hi pretty girl, I say.  The kitty voice.  I don’t even know I do it, but it has amazing effects.  Billy will say, you haven’t talked to the kids since we’ve been on the phone.  I say, you want me to?  He says, I like that voice.  Maybe it works on more than kitties.  Anyway, immediately, she wants to meet me so she comes over, but goes wide.  A few more laps, coming closer each time.  Finally, rolling on her back and pushing nose into fingers.  Loud purring.  She said, I need a home.  I met the people that take care of her, they don’t want her.  She has no affection in her life.  I think I missed that turn on purpose, and now I have a mission.  I walked away, all choked up, as kitty sat in the middle of the sidewalk watching me go.  She followed me for a little while.  Watched me for a long time.  All the way down until I had to turn.  I am sad still.  She is an innocent.  She deserves no pain.  This, is where my energy is supposed to go.

      Or writing?  My favorites are so quiet now (check out  urlLink Blogit ) of 2 pages, only 2 or 3 are writing right now.  I miss my people!  I miss Billy, of course, but Danny and Sparky and Benzinha to name only a few.  Foxy and Wench?  Where is…geez, now I can’t remember who’s in my favorites.  I’m not the most regular of posters because I have a hard time with managing everything else.  Time management issues.  People are reading me, but not commenting.  Or are they reading me?  :::wonders if she’s lost her touch:::  Maybe, as Billy says, the warm weather makes people want to be out in life more.  I get that.  I just happen to like life indoors and in my head, too.  Today, not so much.  Waiting on Billy to call to let me know he’s there okay…well, hoping he’ll call.  If he can.  He left in the wee hours of the morning and it’s a 23 hour (or so) flight…plus the time difference is 10 hours ahead from where he was…11 hours from me.  I think he will miss all of Sunday.  He doesn’t sleep on the plane, neither do I, so he’s going to be exhausted.  I think he had just had a few days relief from jetlag from Iceland.  I simply can’t focus.  I think, okay, let’s do this paperwork…or let’s do the dishes.  I start…then the phone rings or one of the kids gets into something…and I have no idea what I was doing.  I have this evil beast mucking about with my insides making them feel all knotted and throbbing.  I keep saying, it’s not the end of the world.  If you don’t get stuff done, you don’t.  Just the essentials right now.  Be gentle, it’s a lot to go through.  That doesn’t stop that critic in my head, you know the one…the one we all have that sounds like our mother?  That critic wants things perfect to start a new job and all errands, laundry, cleaning must be done.  If I have clean clothes to wear, gas in the car, no utility or service is getting shut off, and there’s food for lunch and dinner, that may have to be enough.  I imagine if I hear from Billy it won’t be until late tonight or tomorrow anyway, and I really have errands to run tomorrow.  I may miss his call.  I guess that’s how it will be for the next six months, because I can’t sit here waiting for the phone to ring all the time.  I have a cell phone and when I moved here, it was impossible for some reason to get the number changed to a San Diego number.  Months of crap and hours on the phone with AT&T Wireless (the WORST company for customer service EVER), I still couldn’t do it.  I just shut it off.  Now, with Billy gone, I want him to be able to reach me.  So, I tackled it again.  They changed the number, good.  BUT, now it’s been 24 hours and the phone is still not activated.  I spent TWO hours getting this done yesterday.  Then called today, held for 35 minutes (when it said the hold time was five) and got hung up on.  Crazy.  I suppose I will have to tackle it yet again if I want it to work.  We agreed to sort of make a standard time to talk so he will be able reach me at a time when I can talk.  That’s a ways off since he’s not even in Baghdad yet.  The uncertainty and anxiety of this are just really doing a number on me.  There’s nothing I can do, but what I can do.  This is one of those things you deal with the best you can, and the rest, you just have to sit with.  Ride it out.  Take care of myself…be gentle with myself…and stop beating myself up over not achieving perfection in all these tasks.  Perfection can make us nuts and stray from the true point.  I just want my boy to be okay and come home.  We have big plans for November…for my trip to Iceland…for his homecoming to San Diego.  The good thing about all of this is that there is this tragic, yet terribly romantic, element to it.  Sweet smelling love letters, naughty little notes and letters, finding something I know he will love but doesn’t have out there and putting it in a care package.  If we make it through all this separation and the war and the distance…imagine what we could do in the same city?

       La Vita Nuova  In that book which is My memory . . . On the first page That is the chapter when I first met you Appear the words . . . Here begins a new life  -  Dante Alighieri    As I write this, Billy is getting up and getting his gear ready for the flight to Kuwait.  He stayed in a hotel room, basically, all week at Ft. Bliss going through processing, so he had a phone in his room and we could talk.  He was busy going through endless paperwork, medical examinations and immunizations, gear issue, training.  He was sick from the shots they gave him.  He had to send tons of his stuff back to Iceland because of the amount of gear he had been issued and the limit on what he could bring.  He qualified on his weapon on the first try.  Now, they will issue him a gun (hand gun) to carry with him for the next six months.  He’s on active duty and must remain in uniform for the next six months.  Phrases like, don’t get shot, or learning to stay alive, have become common.  Yesterday, he told me about the last training class he had where people who have already done tours in Iraq came in and talked about IEDs and “engaging” and what to expect.  Suddenly, my navy lieutenant was saying things like “in theater.”  Not standard lingo for the navy, unless you’re a seal.  Most navy folks are on a ship.  My boy is going in with the army and will be “in theater” within a few days, maybe a week.  I knew today would be a busy and weird day, as it was it seemed like things were getting to him.   It was fun for a while, a defense mechanism, when we both looked at it like camp and like he was playing army.  Today, that was all gone.  Last night we could feel it fading into all too real dread and anxiety.  I didn’t let on how bad it’s been yesterday and today for me.  He kept up military voice, the hardcore place he started to go when this became reality.  I love Billy voice, and navy speak (work voice) is actually really sexy.  But, military voice…scares me, but reminds me of how capable he is.   His biggest struggle the last couple of days have been packing his sea bags and trying to get his Kevlar in.  Now, this morning, he gave up his room, got his gear ready, was issued his weapon.  I asked him to call me as close to time to go as he could (he wasn’t supposed to tell me what time he was leaving).  My phone rang at 8:30, 9:30 his time, tonight.  He was at a payphone and of course other people were waiting to call home before leaving, too.  We only got to talk for a few minutes, but I was grateful to talk to him.  I may not get to hear from him at other such points along his journey, though he will call if it’s possible.  I told him something in a letter about going some place in his mind if he needed me.  I call it a safe place to land.  We talked a few minutes about what his day was like and how we were feeling…how or when he’d be able to call.   I told him to get some sleep, think of me, think of happy things.  I miss you, I said.  I miss you, too, he said.  My friend Trinity says I sound like Billy now, that I’ve picked up his accent.  I like that.   Safe place, I said.  Yes, safe place, he repeats.  Apparently some people going over with him were talking about the probabilities in getting killed or losing limbs.  I want to say, it’s less than 1% fatality…something he told me originally.  I want to say, you aren’t going to be on patrol, you won’t be that mobile.  I can’t say anything.  I am sobbing.  I don’t let him know.  I don’t want this conversation to be about the fact that I can’t breathe for the last few days, especially today, and I can’t eat…I can’t sleep…I’m having nightmares.  This is all compounded by having found out that my cousin is special ops over there on the ground right now, and I can’t reach him.  This has been going on for a while, but my nightmares are now about Billy and Mathew.  Last night, Billy said, well all you guys have to do is miss me (meaning me and his family), I have to worry about not getting killed.   Billy, I said.  That was all I could say.  I was crying then, too.  I know it was said in jest, but it was very, very real for both of us.  I just want to be there for him, support him, make him feel missed and needed and loved.  So, now, tonight, instead of saying what I wanted to, I said, in six months I’ll be waiting for you at Ft. Bliss…we’ll laugh about how it was all for nothing.  You’ll be all set to bitch about having to go back to Iceland, and we’ll be planning my trip up there.  He gets quiet and says, I hope so...I sure hope so.  There are no words at how much this man’s voice can lift me up, bring me comfort.  I write about him talking and I realize how little we will be able to.  It just reaches in and mucks about in all the soft places to think of that.  I’ve been through a lot in my life, but this is way up there with the hardest.  I can’t help him out there to stay safe.  I can send letters every day and email and care packages, but I can’t really do anything.  He doesn’t want to be there.  He’s forced to be in a position where he has to worry about being shot by a sniper or blown up.  The things he’s learned, that he’s shared with me these last days, don’t make me feel any more secure.  There is a lot going on out there that doesn’t get reported.  I know I’m not alone in this, and I know he’s not the only one to go over there, but it certainly feels like a lonely place to be at the moment.  For both of us.  I wanted to not post all these feelings and all this Iraq stuff here, but I am so unfocused and sad that I feel like I need to work it out here.  The last few days my journal and my friends and all my normal coping mechanisms fail me.  Last two days I feel like I can’t really even talk about it.  It hurts too much, no one knows what to say.  What is there to say, really.  The worry for him is profound, but the missing of him is deep and expansive.  I am taking care of me also, not as efficiently as normal, but I am.  I imagine in time my body and my psyche will adjust to the situation a bit and I will, as Billy says, find a groove.  My goal when it comes to this boy of mine is to just send him as much love and support and happy thoughts as I possibly can.  Some nasty, distracting, transporting thoughts, too.  Must have those.   I used to email him at work with those, knowing he will have to talk to people all smiley and giggly.  Can’t stop that now, can I?  That would be just cruel.  I will plan for Texas in November, and send strict instructions to the universe that he is to come home safe and sound.  I imagine he will need a whole new kind of support when he gets home.  Hopefully, some face time with me and some time in my arms will heal some of what has ailed him.  That and long hot showers, air conditioning, and AMERICAN beer.

       "I find the great thing in this world is not so much where we stand, as in what direction we are moving: To reach the port of heaven, we must sail sometimes with the wind and sometimes against it, but we must sail, and not drift, nor lie at anchor."-  Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.    Sometimes life comes together in such a way, events collide so profoundly, that we feel we cannot take it one more second.  I’ve been writing a lot in the last few days, and had a post I wanted to write tonight.  It will have to wait.  My mind is on my very survival, and we know that when we are in survival mode, nothing else is well crafted or pursued.  Conserving and focusing energy on the most important task at hand becomes all we can see.  I’ve never been one of those people to whom things came easily, who’s life went smoothly.  At some point, I learned to accept that as just the way it was, and tried to handle things the best I could.  I learned over time that changing my perspective and expectations could change the way things happened sometimes.  Sometimes, you just had to get through it the best you could with what you had…and look for the lesson or meaning once it was over.  Since my accident, I’ve been unable to manage my life as I could before.  I didn’t understand things, I got confused or disoriented.  I had no ability to organize things.  I’ve learned some of that.   Emma asked me this weekend if I thought going through it all made me a better person.  I said, without hesitation, absolutely.  I believe it’s worth the trouble, that all of this has led me to a better place.  In my heart, I know for certain, that it is leading me to become the person I want to be so I can lead the life I want, the life I deserve.  I see the benefits every single day, truly not an exaggeration.  But, still, there are days when you just want to beg for mercy.  You want the universe to send up a cosmic flare that says you pass, you get to learn whatever it is, but you don’t have to fall apart to do it.  I just picture myself, walking across the apartment as pieces of me fall off behind me…..a foot, a hand, an ear.  Wouldn’t it be great if our nervous breakdowns could be so obvious like in cartoons?  Oh dear, says the woman…picking up a toe, I believe she’s falling apart!  I want to tell you that I am fine with what’s happening in my life right now, that knowing what I know, I can handle it.  The truth is, I’m not fine.  I’m barely holding it together.    I’ve spent too many hysterical moments, sobbing until I couldn’t breathe…scrambling for ideas…swallowing pride.  I feel I have no where to go with these feelings because the people in my life have so much going on that I must downplay because they can’t help or handle it now…or they don’t really want to know.  There are most definitely exceptions, Emma and S. have been there.  S. has been there to the point I think I’ve stressed her out.  But, I still feel so very alone.  I can’t tell Billy any of this…in fact, I wouldn’t be writing this here except I know he most likely won’t read it due to his schedule out on the base in Texas and no real computer access.  He leaves for Kuwait sometime between Thursday and Saturday.  From there, Baghdad is only a few days away.  I need him to focus on the task at hand and not worry about me.  He’s emotionally tapped, gone to John Wayne world, so he couldn’t absorb it all anyway.  Hopefully, soon, it will be sorted out.  I should back up a bit.  I went on the interview, got the job, yay.  I am grateful, but not excited, because it’s a job that I think will cause problems for me and my messed up noggin.  However, it’s what was provided so I will do it and keep looking for a writing job or to get published or something more nourishing for me.  The job, however, does not come in time to avoid real threat of eviction.  My landlord has made it perfectly clear that there is no payment arranging that will happen, and as of end of business Friday eviction procedures will begin.  I’m getting resourceful and doing what I have to, but time is ticking and I’m afraid I can’t pull this one off.  I can’t explain what this will do to me emotionally, mentally, financially, cognitively.  I have one untapped resource, one possible resource, and one that lingers in potential possibility.  But, it really doesn’t look good.  As I write, Eric Clapton sings…have mercy on me…I hear that.    I feel so close to making a bridge from what was to what could be.  I am finding strength and motivation inside myself that hasn’t been there for years.  This is the time that things will begin to change.  I know it in my heart.  I feel its truth in my blood.  I deserve it.  I’ve worked hard for it.  Fear, however, is a powerful companion and threatens to stomp on all my best efforts.  It’s dark, lanky, spongy, sticky fingers stretch and wind it’s way through my brain and my heart and make me feel like there is no hope.  The best defense is a strong offense.  I spent the other night sitting on the sand by the bay.  The water was quietly lapping against the shore.  I wanted to live right there.  The wind carried the water in small ripples out across the bay, and the birds enjoyed the lack of rambunctious people.  I said, out loud, how can anything be wrong in the world when there is something this beautiful here.  I sat in the sand, running it through my fingers…feeling pieces of broken shells.  It was so quiet and so perfect.   I felt fear release it’s grasp and hope flow in on the ripples of water.  I want to fall apart sometimes, I do.  I want to crawl up little in Billy’s arms and let it all go away.  But I know, I really really know, that if I keep putting it out there, the universe will provide.    I found a home for Maddie, as soon as I can get her checked out by a vet (looking for no cost services tomorrow).  My sweet boy called today.  A sailor in the Army house is a little entertaining, but exasperating for Billy at the same time.  He’s getting Army gear issued, so his uniform will be army desert fatigues without proper rank insignias.  Seems a little disorganized, but totally logical all at the same time.  He was happy for warm weather, had me read the comments on his Adios post, and we talked about everything.  His voice sounded so good to me, I had to control myself because I just wanted to get all squealy and mushy.  He needs me to be strong for myself and him, so I will.  I have three letters written, just waiting for an address.  He will be spoiled when he comes home.  Then, it’s my turn, no?    I have friends who love me like Trinity, S., Emma…and who I know for certain would help if they could.  That feels really, really good.  It almost makes up for my family’s response to the situation, which was indifference for the most part.  Tonight I am grateful for:  air conditioning (geez, we’ve got fires out here already!), Emma, Jake, Petie, Scrapper, S., Trinity, my Aunt Judy (Maddie’s new mommy and my kindred spirit…the artist in my family), I have to say Emma twice because she took me out and we had so much fun, of course, my boy Billy.  I’m grateful for iced lattes, mangos, iced cold water when it’s 90 degrees out, that the worm didn’t take my computer.  I’m grateful that I got to talk to Billy today and that he sounded strong.  I’m grateful that, even though I can’t do it, we talked about me hopping in the car and driving to Texas right now.  It was fun to talk about.  I’m grateful that I believe in myself, most of the time, even when my family doesn’t.  I intend not to get evicted.  I intend to beat down the spongy, sticky reach of Fear.  I intend to find another job immediately that nourishes my soul and my bank account.  I intend never to let Billy think he’s alone while going through this process and being plopped down in the middle of a war.  I intend to let my friends know how much they mean to me.  And, most of all, I intend that my perception of myself will trump that of my family’s perception of me.  Survival can kill us, and it can bring out the fire of determination.  Sometimes, it can do both at the same time.  Even if we don’t know where the answers will come from, they are there and they are there for us.  We just have to take a deep breath and keep looking.

      Just a moment to say, that I have two pieces ready to post, but my computer had other ideas.  I had this great day, out with Emma and Jake.  We went to lunch at Seaport Village.  It was so hot, much hotter than we get even in the midst of summer on the coast.  Billy made it to Texas today for processing, but I missed his call.  Finally on the same continent, one time zone away, and I still can’t get a hold of him.  It was basically 24 hours to fly from Iceland there, and he got to the base last night at 9:30 or so….that was the schedule anyway.  He sounded so very tired.  I’m over here missing him and writing him letters that will go out as soon as we have an address in Baghdad.  Baghdad.  I can’t believe that it’s actually happening.  People seemed surprised at me being taken aback at his orders.  But, here’s the thing.  He’s a naval officer, more than 4 years in the Navy, with no combat training.  No, he’s not going to be on a ship.  He will be stationed in Baghdad, and his transport with be in an Army supply convoy (we think) or on a helicopter (worse).  Still not sure what he’s doing.  He will, at some point, be able to come on and read, so drop him a note in his last post.  It will make him feel good.  (billy_cargo)  So tonight, I spent hours working with a tech trying to get my computer to work, so no good posts tonight (sorry Emma).  I had a virus, that wormy thing.  Well, that’s what he said, but it wasn’t detected.  It seems to be working now, but I’ll reserve judgment.  Now, it’s time for bed.  To lay there and know, for the first time in months and months, that my boy is just two states away….sleeping when I am.  Sounds weird, but there is comfort there.  Getting ready emotionally for him to go, and handling some urgent personal business has taken all of my energy and time.  I still have a full plate, but I will post what I’ve been writing.  Until then, light a candle for Lieutenant Cargo and Mathew (my cousin in special operations I just found out was on the ground somewhere over there)…..light a candle for a peaceful and speedy resolution…and light a candle that I don’t get evicted.  Some good news though, I found Maddie (the kitty from last post I found on Manhattan street) a home!  My Aunt, in Albuquerque, is a great lover of kitties.  I said, you must be gentle with her.  She likes that.  My Aunt can play a little rough.  And she can’t ever go outside!  She laughed and said I was the protector for all animals (she’s the one who dubbed my voice when speaking to animals “the kitty voice”……Jake likes it, too, though.)  Anyway, I’m going to see about getting Maddie tested for all the scary kitty diseases, get her shots, and then drive her halfway to Albuquerque and my Aunt will meet me.  Her owner doesn’t know yet, but I don’t think she’ll mind.  Maddie will miss the bay I bet, but she will have lots of attention and other kitties to play with.  I can’t wait to tell her!  I think tomorrow I will find out about no-cost services and then go get my baby girl.  Yes, that will be good.  Hopefully Billy will catch me at home, too.  I miss him SO much.  Haven’t heard his yummie little voice in two whole days.  Seems like eternity.   Tonight, bed and sweet dreams of a kitty with a home and the day when my boy comes home.  Hope all of you are well.  I will write more tomorrow.

       "The tragedies that now blacken and darken the very air of heaven for us will sink into their places in a scheme so august, so magnificent, so joyful, that we shall laugh for wonder and delight." – Christopher Bacon   Your gut is always right.  Is that really true?  Do we ever substitute fear for instinct?  My instincts are usually dead on balls accurate, as they say.  My problem comes when I can’t sort out the difference between my fear of what might happen from my instinct of what is happening.  When you add a lot of other stressful things to that mix that all take up residence in the pit of your stomach, it becomes harder to know what you are feeling.  I try not to react, but to act with a choice.  I’m having such a hard time these days sorting it all out.  My “instincts” – in quotes because I don’t know which is real and which is the imposter – are telling me two different things.  That require two different paths… completely different set of actions and choices.  As Trinity says, Bah.  I have had this problem before, and then some weeks or months later the words, “I knew it!  I felt that all along,” come out of my mouth.  It was true then that I felt it, but there was at least one imposter there mucking about for sport.  I want to learn that.  I need to learn how to tell them apart.  I don’t know, I.D. badges…background checks…facial recognition software.  It’s become essential in my life, at this particular moment especially, to figure it out.  The way people say to do that is to step back.  Take some time and look away, so you may look back with new eyes.  Or, take some time and stare at a blank wall for a while, as Billy likes to say.  It’s my time to do that.  I have invested my heart, time, soul, love, energy and boundless and endless support in this situation.  I’ve begun to wonder what is fair…respectful…thoughtful.  How much is good for me?  Sometimes in life, there will be a situation that we must invest in…with little or no return…because we know it’s the right and best thing to do.   Recognizing that situation is hugely difficult, because if it’s not the right one to invest in…with the belief that it will even out in the end…it can be monumentally damaging and destructive.  Painful.  Lonely.  When we love someone, can we love them without expectation?  Should we?  If not, what is fair to want in return?  Circumstances vary, but in extreme ones we are usually willing to risk more than other times.  I am, anyway.  I am willing to live without certain things and take the risk.  Maybe my lesson here is, in fact, that.  To love without expectation.  To give the benefit of the doubt.  To realize how strong the sentiment is that we all deal with things in our own way.  To breathe through it and remember why I’m doing what I’m doing.    I feel like I’m always waiting these days.  But, I can’t figure out what I’m waiting for.  It happened once Billy left Iceland for the desert, but it’s not solely about him.  It’s so much more than that.  Of course there is the waiting to hear from him, hear what is going on…how he is…if he’s safe or if anything’s changed.  The full picture is about finally feeling, after all these years, that I’m living my life again.  I want more in my life.  I want to work more with animals…form a nonprofit…go to yoga, study Buddhism more, meet more quality people, work out more.  Branch out and explore.  Problem is, my brain boycotts me so often.  I finally accept that I have to pace things more slowly and have more reasonable expectations of myself since the accident.  There are days when I forget or deny.  There are days I don’t know how to do it.  I am also finally realizing that I can’t give my little bit of energy to working a job that doesn’t nourish me, but drains me in fact, and that requires me to function on someone else’s schedule.  I have had a sense of this in my heart, but until this past week I didn’t really get it.  I am too tired and too focused on getting to work and handling that, that I am once again in survival mode.  The same survival mode that comes with facing eviction or not having enough food to eat.  I never expected that.  It’s more important than ever that I focus on writing now…the nonprofit soon…and taking care of myself.  I really lost nearly four years of my life to not knowing what was happening and feeling completely lost.  Time just passed with no consequence or celebration.  My time was spent in lonely rooms, living in my head, dealing with people who not only did not offer support, but who beat me down.  It’s finally time to fill my days with people and things I love.  I deserve that.  I can actually say that and mean it.  I forget everything and go too fast, too rough on myself.  Trinity is having a really rough time of it right now.  Lonely place she’s in, and sometimes I can’t reach her.  She is in survival mode.  I say, baby girl, be soft, be gentle, go slowly.  Just take care of yourself and be gentle.  My best friend, Jennifer, is beating herself up because she’s not able to do everything all at once.  Husband, kids, nursing school, work.  I say, find time for yourself before you burn out.  That has to be priority.  Then, what do I do?  What do I expect of myself?  I beat myself up for not being able to handle work, friends, working out, the house, etc.  I am not gentle with myself.  This weekend, that was the plan.  Look for work, sleep, write, be gentle.  I won’t die if errands don’t get run, if the house doesn’t get vacuumed.  We have to nourish our souls to find any real happiness.  When we don’t, they wither and cannot serve us.  Life is not really lived when done in the unconscious.  It must be priority.  If the house is clean, but I am sad and unfulfilled, what good is that?  It makes me crazy not get everything done.  That’s okay, I lived in crazy for a long time.  I still get mail from there.  Survival mode robs us of our ability to take care of our deep mushy spots, our soft tender parts.  We must be able to step up and say, not today you don’t.  Today, I put my soul and my spirit first and the rest must wait (can you tell I have this conversation with myself a lot?  I truly believe progress is continuing to affirm and reaffirm what we want and need.)  Living in that place of too fast and too much, we miss the little things.  That place looks different for all of us.  So, it’s back to basics for me.  The small things.  The things I’m grateful for.  Here we go.  Today, I am most unbelievably grateful that the mortar fire that hit Billy’s compound in Baghdad did not hurt him, nor seriously hurt anyone else.  I am grateful that I read about it in an email from him instead of seeing it on CNN (which it was).  He gets cookies and, hell, whatever he wants, for that.  I know that it won’t always be possible for me to find out from him first.  I am also grateful for:  Petie kisses, Scrapper’s belly, Heather (buxomwench) and all talks of sex cake :::big smile:::, the ocean is only minutes away, caffeine (helps with headaches), good headache drugs to keep demons at bay, my favorite conditioner that makes people compliment me on how my hair smells, modern technology (we’ll leave it at that, but you know my deal), silence…oh blessed silence, long, hot, lavender filled showers and fluffy white towels.  Little bitty things.  That’s where it starts.  When the tide comes in and takes you out to sea with your heart in one hand and a busted up life raft in the other, what’s the worst thing to do?  Panic.  I slow down, breath deep, keep my head above water, and plan my way out.  Soft bed, soft white sheets, down comforter…bring me small increments of sleep that I can use as fuel to navigate the waters and my small increments of time when I can focus.  I dig heels into sand and reaffirm my intentions.  I intend to get Billy home safely and soundly, even if it’s not up to me…and even if our future is yet defined or certain.  I intend to be writing and making money and not be a corporate slave one second longer than absolutely necessary.  I intend to make myself a priority for a change.  I will not let this fucking war drown me at sea.  I intend to focus on nourishment:  body, mind, soul.  I intend to slow down and breathe, let it be okay that I don’t know how to live as the “new me” yet, and every time I trip…every time I fall…I will just remind myself that it takes time and I’m one step closer.  Finally, I intend to remind myself that it’s okay not to know what do to all the time.  I am, after all, a mere mortal.  Flawed and perfect, all in one.  Running on Faith just came on.  Perfect.  See?  The universe knows what we need.  (Oh my god, directly followed by Old Love…safe place baby, safe place.  This time next year.)

       “The web of our life is of a mingled yarn, good and ill together” -  William Shakespeare    A couple of weeks ago I had a doctor’s appointment at my clinic in Mission Beach.  It was one of “those days” that have been all too frequent lately, so I left early to get some time by the water.  I wandered around bayside for a while, marveling at blue water and white sailboats.  I realized I had not properly greeted the bay since I’ve been back.  At some point living in Denver, I began to realized that blue and white were my favorite colors.  Even if it was just blue jeans and white t-shirt.  I wonder why?  I wandered street side, wanted to go get my favorite mocha, but they are only open for breakfast and lunch, so were closed already.  There I was, sitting at a coffee house, aptly called Coffee House, waiting for my  appointment.  My mocha is good, the breeze coming over the ocean plays with my hair and makes my lips salty.  I had lots of time, so I wrote some letters and wrote in my journal.  Taking the time to just let everything go.  This was a good day to reflect and daydream.  I used to live down here and so much still reminds me of that time.  I was 18 when I first moved to San Diego, and the first few months were spent in the area I was sitting in.  I used to sit by the bay at night for hours.  So still.  So quiet.  I couldn’t believe something so beautiful could always be there and I not always be part of it.  I sat there, writing about peace and hope and love.  Writing letters to my boyfriend in San Antonio, Erik.  So desperate they were with missing him.  I was shacked up with four surfer guys in a house just down the street from where I was this day, about a block.  I’d spend late nights on the payphone at the Boardwalk Café, his mom screaming about collect calls.  I remember sitting at a bon fire on the beach with my housemates.  We were all half drunk, radio blaring, throwing a football, covered in sand.  Some song came on the radio and tears would be in my eyes.  My roommates were great.  Didn’t hit on me…much…looked after me.  My roommate asked, what’s up little one?  I said, I miss Erik.  He said, funny about love long distance…you feel everything more, it makes you work harder, it’s romantic and  horrible…or, you don’t.  The answer shows itself soon.  He was right.  We were too young, love was small and fleeting.  My roommates were amazed that I could party like I did, get hit on like I did, share a house with four guys (one who occasionally slept on the couch in my room), and not cheat.  Considering I just moved so far away from home and was so young, I was often amazed, too.  Erik was so good to me.  Such a good person.  I just couldn’t do it.  I didn’t even want to, well, until I did.  Let’s go back.  I had this girlfriend growing up in Albuquerque named Erin.  She was going to Phoenix for some reason around my 18th birthday.  Erin, I said, I’m bored with boys here.  Bring me a new boy from Arizona.  She went, and when she came back she stopped by my house.  She said she brought pictures of me to Phoenix and had showed them to boys she met.  She said there were “many takers,” but one guy was cute and funny and charming.  He was the only one she thought was good enough.  Are you serious? I asked her.  She handed me a picture and a letter.  It was Erik.  He was gorgeous!  Blond, blond hair.  Big deep blue eyes.  Perfect smile.  His letter simply said that he thought I was beautiful and Erin said wonderful things about me.  He enclosed his phone number.  I smiled and kissed Erin on the cheek.  I called him that minute.  We spent hours on the phone every day.  He was unbelievably sweet to me.  So thoughtful and concerned about me.  An ex-girlfriend of his was harassing him, and he made sure to tell me about it before I could find out some other way.  He told his whole family about me.  His Mom and I talked a lot.  She invited me to visit.  Three weeks later I was moving to San Diego.  My uncle lived in Phoenix and said that I could stay with him as long as I wanted.  I got to his house, and he had to go to New York City for a month or so, but I could stay in the house.  I could barely contain my joy.  The house was beautiful and had a pool…and was 10 minutes away from Erik’s.  When I first met him, it was perfect.  We were nervous for about five minutes.  Our chemistry was perfect…he was a great kisser.  When it came time to leave, we weren’t sure what to do.  Should he go with me?  Should we break up?  I was going to California to go to school.  His parents were planning a move to Texas.  We decided to wait and feel it out.  That young it’s hard to make such permanent decisions.  It was for me.  I wanted to be on my own, and he didn’t know what he wanted in regards to college, etc.  We stood crying in his driveway, my car all packed up.  That was the thing about Erik, he was hot and strong and masculine, but he had no problems letting me in…letting me see and know his feelings.  Not many men can do that, especially so early in life.  He told me he loved me and was afraid of losing me.  I loved him, too, but in my heart I felt like this was not permanent.  I hugged him and told him he had my heart, which he did, and not to be scared.  I cried half way to San Diego.  Then, I remember coming to the “Welcome to California” sign.  Judas Priest was rocking my stereo.   The sun was bright and merciless.  I got out and ran around like a loon.  I was free from Albuquerque…of the horrible things that happened to me there…of my parents (or so I thought).  I was looking forward to a new start, a new life.  I had come to San Diego when I was 15.  Fell in love.  Knew it was the city of my spirit even then.  I knew I would move there after high school.    Once in San Diego, I found a hotel in Mission Beach to stay in.  It’s still there.  I walked up and down the boardwalk and Mission Blvd. looking for “For Rent” signs.  That’s when I found my housemates.  They said, hey, come up to the room were bbq’ing.  I did.  We had a blast and I told them my story.  They had a roommate going out of town and said I could rent his room while he was gone.   After about a month, I moved to a house with some other people.  Things get a little crazy being the only girl in a house with four guys.  I never had privacy.  I never got to take a shower without someone coming in to talk to me…to pee or brush teeth…or walk through to the roof (that was the only way up to the roof).  My new house was bigger and less crazy.  I lived with three other people and finally brought all my stuff out from Albuquerque (including my girl, Mitty).  Had my first earthquake even.  It was about 7:00 in the morning.  I had an old fashioned waterbed, the fully wavy kind.  The movement woke me up, and I opened my eyes to see Mitty, totally cool, no panic, sort of surfing the waves as she walked along my bed.  After a few seconds, I hear my roommate yell, “holy shit!”  I get up and come into the hallway asking, what was that?  She smiles, that was your first earthquake.  Shortly after that I went to San Antonio, where Erik had moved with his family.  San Antonio, at least then, was dreadful.  Nothing to do for kids our age.  Erik was miserable.  His parents, of course, put us in separate bedrooms.  It was weird staying with a boy’s family like that.  I thought at the time it was because I was young, but it’s still weird as a grown up.  I was put in Erik’s little brother’s bedroom.  I got to sleep in the boy’s first bed (read: tiny).  I remember going to bed that first night, trying to figure out how to end up in the same bed with Erik.  We stayed up late talking and getting to know each other better in the careful-my-parents-are-in-the-next-room way.  That blissfully hot, crazy making out that seems to disappear as soon as we get older.  So, I lay there in the dark…and what do you know…door opens up.  It’s Erik.  I wanted to say goodnight, he says.  Tuck me in?  I smile.  He pushes the door almost closed and sits next to me.  Sitting next to me quickly became laughing and trying to get next to each other on this little bed.  Suddenly….oh Erik!...his Mom sing songs from the other room, trying not to totally bust us.  A few minutes later, I slipped into his room.  That became our routine.  Then, his best friend came to visit (who’s name totally escapes me now).  I knew him from Phoenix, and thought he was a great guy.  The three of us hung out a lot, got along really well, laughed all the time.  This time, something was different between him and me.  We’ll call him Ace.  There was this really hot chemistry between Ace and me, out of the blue.  I was still loving Erik, things stayed the same.  But, then, I noticed Ace looking at me intensely one night.  We looked into each other’s eyes and knew he wanted me, too.  He was so unbelievably gorgeous, not to mention charming and funny and sweet.  I entertained the thought…many thoughts really.  I just had to pretend it wasn’t there.  One night, we were all out somewhere, and Erik was at the bar or in the bathroom…something.  Ace walked up to me, really close…I couldn’t breathe.  He leaned over and sort of nuzzled his way into my hair to whisper in my hair.  All he said was, And?  When he pulled away, we just stared into each other’s eyes.  I said, there’s no story.  There can’t be any story.  He said, Erik’s always been my best friend and he’s a good guy.   We agreed that we would never act on our feelings or never tell Erik.  Alas, over time (we were all staying at Erik’s house) Erik picked up on it.  Called us out.  We never really admitted our true feelings, we said there was some chemistry but it didn’t matter because I wanted Erik.  That really was the truth.  Ultimately, I had to walk away from both of them.  My feelings only grew for Ace and I couldn’t ever date him.  Erik and I stayed in touch for a long time after that, of course his Mom hated me (I was the barracuda).  I never saw Ace again either.  But, when I come down to Mission Beach and see all the places that I spent my time while he was in my life, I can’t help but wonder how he is and what he’s doing.  We always wonder about what could have been.  I wonder about Ace, too.   _________________________________________________

       “Much have we loved you.  But speechless was our love, and with veils it had been veiled.  Yet now it cries aloud unto you, and would stand revealed before you.  And ever has it been that love knows not its own depth until the hour of separation.”-  Kahlil Gibran , “The Prophet”   Jolted awake at 4:30 a.m.  Only finally fell asleep around 1:30.  The feeling in that dark pit of my belly would not have me rest.  It is demanding and possessive, and it insists on all of my thoughts and all of my soul.  Before I can even open my eyes and focus on the alarm clock to see the time, the bold…hard…sharp thought cuts through the fog:   Billy is in Iraq.   I bolt up, trying to adjust to where I am and what is happening.  Did a cat wake me up?  Was it the phone?  Silence greets me in the house.  I grab the remote to the stereo and click play, letting Kem come into my room…wrapping around me and rocking me into hazy half-sleep.  The song by him, Say, reminds me of Billy.  I wonder what doesn’t these days.  Billy doesn’t like R&B, but occasionally we find songs he likes.  I was writing one day with the streaming radio on, and Billy called.  When Say came on I said, baby, listen…you have to love this one.  He let Kem travel the nearly 5000 miles to Iceland and introduce himself.  I like that, that’s good, he said in response.  Some time goes by, and then….Petie has my toe.  He has invaded and insists on occupation.  The more my toe fights, the more Petie threatens to take the whole foot.  He is a man up to the challenge.  I look at the clock and it’s not even 5:00.  I put the kids out in their kennels to see if I can salvage an hour and a half of sleep, but it wasn’t to be.  Finally, I open my eyes and accept the inevitable.  I play with the good luck charm Billy sent that hangs around my neck.  I remind myself that he’s still in Kuwait…that the processing and settling and army red tape part of his life has taken up his time, and he will call to tell me that he’s in Kuwait safely soon (and when he’s due to leave for Baghdad)…that he’s okay, and I would know by now if he wasn’t.  Still, part of me says, he didn’t have 5 minutes to let me know that he made it okay?  I get up and go about my day, getting ready.  I’ve become both child and parent to myself this morning.  I want to sleep.  I’m exhausted and in sleep, I don’t have to think or feel.  My inner child is stomping its feet in protest, while the parent in me spews reminders of the integrity and necessity of work.  It’s a battle all morning.  Don’t want to get out of the shower.  Don’t want to eat.  Simply just don’t wanna.  Fortunately, the parent in me wins out and I gather my things and leave.  I show up for my orientation and training early, for a change.  My whole group is women, and we could not be more different from each other.  After sitting through a benefits, paperwork, look-how-fabulous-we-are meeting with a poorly prepared, testy, and condescending human resources manager, we are free for lunch.  (Stops to listen to Clapton do Bell Bottom Blues – favorite Clapton song…..if I could choose, a place to die…it would be in your arms…brilliant.)  One woman in my group and I click.  She is so interesting.  She’s about 5, maybe 7, years older than me.  She has tons of dark eyeliner on and really dark eye shadow, but she pulls it off.  She smiles a lot.  Her blond hair is pulled partially back, and her shoes show that she’s got a little party girl in her.   A look I happen to love with a suit (no one, but me, seemed to have been told jeans were cool…I was the only one to interview with the actual honcho of our department so I had all kinds of inside information).  She runs to make a phone call and joins me outside in a gazebo where I’m eating my lunch.  She’s smoking and downing sunflower seeds.  I’m writing in my journal.  We start to talk and she tells me how she started writing poetry for the first time in her life after a friend’s son died, and her friend found his body.  She remembers some of them by heart and tells me.  They are sad and powerful and good.  We talk about boys and work and living in San Diego.  After lunch, we are splitting up into different training groups and she is in the other one.  Training is brutally boring and full of endless details.  I’m amazing at how this company, which makes a FORTUNE, doesn’t put any value into efficient systems, equipment, or the environment.  This place is a dump and the computers seem to be from 1975.  If I told you who I worked for, every single one of you would know.  That’s how big.  In fact, every single one of you has a product made by them – or spun from competition – in your house and office.  I can tell that this is a place that does not value its employees (which is also evident in the unbelievably bad wages and employee cost of benefits) and remind myself to stay on the ball and find something else as soon as possible.  Once I get started, I can pick my schedule.  I’ll go in at 7:30 and leave at 4:00…maybe 7:00 to 3:30…then I can have some business hours to do other work in.  It will be hard to get myself on that schedule, but I’ve done it before and I can do it now.    We are set free at 3:30 but paid until 5:00.  Most excellent.  I come screaming home because I know there is a package in the manager’s office for me.  I got the note on Saturday, but the office closes early that day and I missed them.  I know it’s from Billy.  I park in the garage and run up the steps to the office.  Upon seeing my package, I actually squealed with delight.  I ran up the remaining flights of stairs and opened up the box to find a copy of The Prophet (“our” book…he bought one for himself and took it to Iraq with him) and one of his favorite t-shirts that happens to be from a company out here.  I have it on right this minute.  The quote above is from the book.  He wrote inside the front cover.  More conflicting emotions at this moment…missing him and wondering why the hell he hasn’t called yet.  Really, I’m just worried and want to hear his voice.  I leave again to go to the store…and in spite of everything I’m in a great mood.  Driving home just reminds me how much I love this city.  I love living in a big city.  All the people and the culture and the different things to do and see.  Tonight was a perfect illustration.  I was driving up Broadway towards my building and rocking Joss Stone.  If you’ve never heard her, it’s soul music.  She’s this little 16-year-old British blond, but she sounds like old school soul.  She does a remake, that is brilliant, of “Some Kind of Wonderful”  and I have my stereo really loud.  I notice the bus driver to my right is keeping time with me in traffic and rocking out with me.  As I smile, I hear a ruckus to my left.  Across the street, these two old black guys were shouting stuff like…you go girl…and sort of dancing down the street along with my car as it crept a little in traffic.  I looked over and smiled at them, they smiled.  I just laughed and waved and drove on.    Earlier today at my gazebo lunch, there were these amazing bright pink flowers with big silver dollar pedals…big like leaves.  Billy loves plants and trees and growing just about anything.  I thought he would love these, so bright and full of spring.  Especially in the desert.  The gazebo was covered in them, so many…so beautiful.  I picked a bunch and put them in my journal to put in a letter or care package.  As I drove home, I took notice of these huge flowering trees that lined the streets of downtown.  Purple flowers blooming everywhere and getting caught up in the breeze…falling like rain over the city.  Ha!  Purple rain.  I never meant to go there.  People everywhere…punkers, business people, homeless, junkies, mom’s, homeboys…every kind of person.  Every kind of store.  Every kind of music on the street.  And soft purple flowers raining out over all of us.  I decide I want these to send to Billy, too.  I park and get out of the car, and start walking up and down the street trying to find a bloom low enough for not-even-5’5”-me to pick.  I walk down one block, then turn around.  I’m walking up to the corner, waiting to cross the street, when I hear, hey, stop flipping that hair around…you’re making me crazy!  I look over my shoulder and a guy is walking up.  Looks a little rough, but this never bothers me.  I laugh and smile, sorry, I say, habit.  He laughs.  I’m looking elsewhere when the light changes.  C’mon, he says.  I look up and we start walking across the street, making small talk.  As we get to the other side, he says, hey, where you going?  Back to my car, I said.  Car, huh?  You ever ride a motorcycle?  I tell him that yeah, it’s been a long time since I’ve been on the back of a bike, but I spent a lot of time there once.  At this, he rests his arm on my shoulder.  We are now best friends.  He says, you gotta let me take you riding sometime.  I smile.  He asks, what are you looking for?  I tell him I’m trying to pick these flowers for my boy in Iraq, but I’m too short.  He expresses sadness that I know someone over there, and tells me that he used to be 101st Airborne and was in Vietnam.  At this point, I want to just buy him a beer and hear his story…but I still have groceries in the car.  I never find the flowers on this street and my new best friend and I part ways.  As I get into my car, I see him try to talk to another woman who just ignores him, like he wasn’t there.    Once inside the car, I pick up my cell phone and call the florist by my house.  They are closed, but I’m leaving a message to see if they can help me identify this beautiful flower and if they carry it.  I turn on to my street, and guess what I saw?  Little flowering trees with purple blooms all over.  Little, meaning I can reach them.  Right there.  I got out and picked some purple flowers, which now sit in my journal awaiting deployment to Iraq.  Now, if only my boy would call me with the address.  What a cool day, indeed.

       “You are not here merely to make a living. You are here in order to enable the world to live more amply, with greater vision, with a finer spirit of hope and achievement. You are here to enrich the world, and you impoverish yourself if you forget the errand." -  Woodrow Wilson    It’s funny how we take things for granted without even knowing.  Inside most of the day with quick escapes outside, but all that is there for me outside at work is constant navy flyovers and inland blah.  Here, even living close to the water, I don’t always notice.  Tonight, I was in the window, playing with Petie.  Having the little conversations that we do…me, in kitty speak…kiss kiss kiss kisses?  And him happily with punching little pawsteps coming to rub Petie kisses into my face and shoulders.  Back and forth.  Back and forth.  I looked out the window and took a breathed deeply, noticing fragrant ocean breath on the wind.  Immediate connection…breath, air, ocean, soul.  They all recognize each other and get quickly reacquainted.  Busy working and surviving, I’ve neglected them.  Three day weekend brings blissful thoughts of sleep and heavy wordsmithing.  Schedule screams out in passionate pleas that there are many details to tend to.  Harried work and schedule and errands all leave my mind at 4:45 where I’m able to put it all away for the 12 minutes it takes me to get home…even after getting stuck at work later than normal…and I’m screaming down the freeway passing Mr. BMW and Ms. Porsche.  Soft gray clouds, cool breeze, and home awaits.  I indulge myself on one of Billy’s favorite Sobes and have taking to telling him when I get a good cap.  It’s funny, loving him makes me ache for things I’ve never had.  Especially loving him far away.  Things he loves.  Things I never wanted, or even things I didn’t want.  It makes me realize things I’ve been searching for either more fully or for the first time.  Things like privacy, quiet, simplicity, balance.  All things I recognized as necessary and places for growth.  Now, there are new, clear pieces to those puzzles.  The minutia, as he calls it.  Blow up the minutia, baby, he says.  I like knowing there are things for him to teach me, things he already has taught me.  I like knowing that finding balance in a tangible, present way could be as simple as finding each other and exploring each other’s strengths.  Meeting closer together where each of our flaws or weaknesses have been dealt with, explored, adjusted, and all it meant was finding and loving each other.  The subject of cowboy cargo always ever present and fluid and cause for distraction.  I digress.  Tonight, real time email with LIEUTENANT Cargo (see, baby, fuck October), lots of Japanese food, and scritch time with the kids bring me back down to home and laptop.    Some exceptionally bad news for me tonight, however, left me in a heap sobbing…Saylor, the dog I was going to adopt, was killed.  Euthanized, for no real reason, and I wasn’t even given the courtesy of a phone call.  I read it in an email.  I can’t elaborate much here because it’s is just too sad to comprehend.  He was a beautiful boy…only 6 years old.  I am livid and devastated.  It was my mission to get him away from his owners.  I knew there was a purpose when I found him, but I didn’t know it’s urgency.  I was supposed to save him, and I let him down.  Now he’s dead, and I can never let him know how much I already loved him.  I will grieve the loss of what never was and the loss of this poor, sweet doggie deeply and with deep soul sadness.  I must leave this topic here.    Work has been…well, it’s been.  I am not a fan of busywork with no real variation, lots of inane details, no real responsibility or decision making.  It is not for me.  I can do it because I need to, and because I need the money, and because anything is better than sitting here watching CNN all day for Baghdad news.  Some of the people I work with are fun, some are truly out of their everlovin’ minds.  There will be much more on this, because characters attract themselves to me, and I have much to tell.  Crazy place my office.  One good thing is that my job requires me to be on the phone very little, so I throw headphones on and off all day to tune out noise and get lost in my thoughts.  Music has always been an essential fabric of my life, my soul, my very well being and sanity.  It’s weaving small little soundtracks to different stories for me now.  One came from the title of our software that is like a screensaver, I suppose, called The Assassin.  It sends warnings to you when it thinks your system is idle, sometimes even though you are in the middle of something.  It takes up two-thirds of the screen and doesn’t go away for a minute, but you can type through it.  It says you’ve been idle and blah blah blah and do something or The Assassin will take care of it.  Some programmer’s way of dealing with his or her stunted career and profound brilliance.  It’s a little creepy, however.  It used to be called The Sniper.  Considering current events, when in training we were told to “beware love notes from Assassin, I was a little disturbed.  I work really well right now listening to hard rock…metal…whatever, because there is no emotional thread for me to unravel in my head.   I’m rocking away listening to Rage Against the Machine, one of my all time favorite angry/driving/energy CD’s.  For those of you not familiar, this  was a very political band made up of exceptionally bright and very cool guys.  I was lucky enough to have met them back in my days in music during college.  The lyricist and singer of the band, Zach de la Rocha, is truly a brilliant and powerful modern day revolutionary.  He strikes me as one of the guys you saw from the 60s building true causes out of a bunch of stoned kids.   He is now doing other things, but once again, I digress.  However, even for those of you not into that music, check him out.  My favorite CD is the first one they released, self-titled.  On the front cover is that powerful and controversial picture of the Buddhist monk who set himself on fire to protest the Viet Nam war.  I’m listening to it this day and thinking that so much of it relates to the war in Iraq that no one will officially call a war.  The lyrics make me think of the boys I dealt with in gangs who feel there is no life outside of their set, who don’t believe they will live beyond 25…much less 30.  There is no vision in that life.  I loved my little gang bangers, they were good to me.  Loyal and kind.  They trusted me because I was also loyal and kind, as well as real, to them.  They laughed when I would come to work on a Friday night (I worked in juvenile hall during law school) with Ice Cube and Tupac CD’s.  They were proud.  They did homework and chores and we rocked out.  Coach!  (that’s what they called us…don’t know why)  You know all the words!  Yep yep.  I listen to all this and Eminem one day, my mind going to the war in Iraq and the war in the streets, and my computer is giving me love notes from The Assassin.  It strikes me as profound and looming and scary that these things that seem all so far apart, so different, turn towards the same thing.  Violence has become an accepted part of our society.  Maybe it always was but I wasn’t clued in.  Or maybe it’s the war and my boy’s presence in it that brought it home.  I think of the foot soldiers, the ones with “boots on the ground,” who live without sleep…traveling hours and hours every day…dirty and tired and missing home.  No comforts.  I hear stories from them of “missions” and notice the periods without writing.  Billy, thank the goddess, is in about a safe a place as you can get if you are going to be in Iraq.  However, with the handover coming at the end of next month and him being at the coalition compound, he is most definitely not safe.  Safe-er.  Iraqi insurgents are going to get more and more insistent on disturbing that process, which means his level of danger will increase.  It’s true, their weapons are flawed and they have no training, but they are determined.  It is a very big compound and very heavily guarded.  You’ve heard, I’m sure, about the death of high ranking Iraqi officials by car bombs just outside of the compound.  It’s the same area, I believe, a place that is called (of all things) assassin’s gate.  Love notes from the assassin.  For any member of the military over there now…male or female…marine, soldier, sailor… there is a stance.  A way of being.  It differs somewhat from person to person, but it’s there just the same.  It’s game face.  It’s been scary and frustrating and interesting to deal with Billy during this transition.  He isn’t Billy most of the time.  He’s Lieutenant.  I see it in others in different ways.  It makes me sad, but it’s necessary.  I used to see the same thing in my kids at juvi.  Show no fear.  No weakness.  De la Rocha says, “fist full of steel…44 full of bullets…face full of pale…eyes full of empty…stand full of nails.”  That about sums it up, I think.  I will tell you it has not been all work for our boy, billy cargo.  He’s violating military drinking regulations with full vigor.  Bought a guitar and sings for folks by the pool whether they want him to or not.  Leaves me drunken messages at 2am his time…the telephonic booty call, if you will.  Ah, just like the good ole days.I’m thankful that he has the release and the distraction.  I still worry, and like I tell him, I won’t feel better until your home.  All of our soldiers (I say that in a general all encompassing way…in the way that society uses the term…to mean all military) over there will need some special soul work, extra nurturing and special care when they come home.  No matter what they did or saw or experienced while there, coming back from ‘stand full of nails’ requires a little extra time and patience. :::sigh:::  Billy says I’m patient. I say I just do a good impression of it.   In the meantime, I will keep doing what I’m doing.  Sending very special Temple love and thoughts and words overseas to my sailor in the army.  It’s frustrating and lonely, that’s is most definitely true.    It’s also important.   Abuelita says, letters from girl are true north.  A point to focus on.  A point of orientation.  November cannot get here fast enough.  I write this with these thoughts for all of you.  If you know someone, or know someone who knows someone, who is dealing with a soldier overseas in this war (or any conflict) remind them that they must remember where they are coming from now.   Their lives may be filled with routine, but they are very uncertain and there are constant reminders of danger.  This is an interruption from regular life, and their behavior is going to be different.  It’s important to remember and hold on to what you know to be true from before life was interrupted.  It’s very complicated because feelings are involved, and I don’t pretend to have all the answers, but that sentiment has helped me.  Secondly, all military is trained to think of going to war – in whatever fashion – as part of their job.  Otherwise, they wouldn’t be able to do it.  To make war a job, certain things must be tweaked in the mind and glassed over in heart.  I call this going military guy or going John Wayne for Billy.  It’s something of a messed up principal.  When you start talking about, as Billy mentioned while at Ft. Bliss, shooting someone in a war as “engaging the subject,” and it takes place in “the theater,” you know there is a bit of conditioning going on.  Whatever they have to do to get by, to get through it has to be okay.  I get asked about Billy at work, and someone recently put up a big thank you to troops in his honor.  How do you do it?  I say, well, I have no idea.  Every five minutes it changes and I keep looking for a better way.  I never withhold love even if I’m angry, because it’s too sensitive a situation.  I cry a lot and write, both him and journaling, a lot.  War, good or bad, just or unjust, is violence plain and simple.  It’s another place where it is totally acceptable.  I find the idea of killing random people who had no power to decide whatever it is they are fighting for, and sometimes had no choice whether or not to fight, only to make a government of untouchables respond, pure lunacy.  I don’t say it’s never something that must be done (only because I personally can’t always think of a better way to solve the problem), but definitely not as much as it has been done.  Even when I agree, the fundamental concept is madness.  Finally, I say this.  With all the desensitizing that has happened to us and the generations below us, we must open our eyes to what is really going on.  We’ve made it okay through music and television and politics to treat people with utter disregard.  There are answers to that, but not for this post.  For the record, I don’t believe that is the problem with society or that censorship is the answer.  It’s up to us, individually, to continually be open for growth and compassion.  If Nelson Mandela can remain that way after what he went through, I know we each can find a way not to believe what is being carefully spoon fed us.  That humiliation, degradation and annihilation are all just a part of life and politics.  I just believe that we need to provide the balance.  Free thinkers.  The creative community.  We have the power to do that.  Whether it’s to protest war or to find ways to stop the wars on our streets and open kids up to a vision of the future, it’s imperative that we use our voices to stimulate thought and change.  In whatever way the spirits move us, we must let it flow.  It’s time to start writing love notes   to   the assassin.

       “There is a real magic to enthusiasm.  It spells the difference between mediocrity and accomplishment.” -  Norman Vincent Peale    The new job at, we’ll just call it Yellow, has provided an endless flow of post-it notes and scribbles in my journal for writing later.  Problem is, getting up at 5:00 a.m. is not in my natural repertoire, neither is falling asleep at 10:00, so I’ve been in a constant state of tired juggling the necessities of my life after work.  I’ve been saying this a lot, but this, like everything, is an adjustment.  The schedule and my tendency to put too require too much of myself in too small of a period of time, have left me sick and dealing with brain fatigue from the brain injury. I have been doing really well with scheduling and planning, and trying to expect less from myself.  But, I still am running around at 10:00 trying to finish up the day instead of going to sleep.  It’s definitely progress though.  House and car are clean.  Bills are handled (as much as they can be for right now).  Laundry’s done.  Still working on incorporating other things into my day and get into a rhythm I’m happy with.  I have to make sure to keep writing time and query time a priority.  After all, that’s the mission and this job is just a way to fund the mission.  Progress is slow, but it’s progress.  Being at Yellow can be desperately boring, but provides endless character study.  It’s rich with characters that is.  I sit there, 7:30 in the morning trying to get into the rhythm of the day.  House music pumps through my headphones and into my veins supplying much needed energy.  I don’t listen to house that much, but here I need it to tune out all the chatter around me as well as the chatter in my head.  I need the beat.  The groove.  I swig Pepsi like it’s beer trying to fill up on caffeine and sugar.   Under my breath I curse the sales rep with the staple fetish that makes my review of the contract much more difficult and time consuming.  Some of the characters are here already.  One of my favorite is L.  She dresses completely differently every day, like each day a different personality was in charge.  This day she’s wearing a bright t-shirt under overalls, and fuzzy blue/pink/green slippers.  Yes, slippers.  This is not uncommon.  One girl wears her Curious George slippers quite often, and another girl was in pajama bottoms.  L’s hair is short, just below the ears, but it’s big.  The back is cut really short in layers up the back of her head.  She plays with it a lot, so it looks like she just woke up.  She shuffles by with growly-face and mutters to herself.  We fell about.  Periodically she mutters a little louder about something or tells us, in jest, to get back to work.  I can’t look at her sometimes without wanting to crack up.  Every single day right before the end of her shift, she begins to panic and curse and mutter louder.  Today, she does the slipper shuffle, but the day before she did the angry girl stomp in her calf-length high heeled boots.  L. also is sweet and turned me onto Pablo Neruda and gives me good feedback on my work.  In my little section of four where I sit, there is J., a 6’2” black guy that apparently has tapeworm because I have to keep all food away from him or it’s gone.  There is S., who’s Hawaiian and works another full time job.  She fights with her sister a lot, and mostly shows up as innocent.  Then, something slips and I tell her she’s busted.  Finally, there is I. who is an Asian woman, older than the rest of us, and just very sweet.  I don’t know her exact background, but there is a few people here that she either knows or has befriended because they share the same ethnicity.  At lunch they each bring a couple of things and sit around and share dishes.   She gets migraines too, so occasionally you will see her with her head on her desk.  J. is very loud, all the time.  Talking to himself, doing calculations out loud, having his radio on without headphones, singing and rapping.  He was calculating out loud the other day, and I wrote down the numbers he was saying out loud on a contract as a new contract number.  He has a good sense of humor about it though, and I was able to tell him that I can’t work if he does his job out loud.  It changed very little.  Once day, he was singing along with Christina Aguilera, and I. was singing “Tiny Bubbles.”  I was in the middle pulling my hair out.  At lunch, J. takes a nap in his chair and snores.  When S. is away, he steals her lotion (which is very girly smelling).  He also has a 73-year-old man as a roommate.  Not live in care, they are roommates.  Where the hell do I work already?  In training, people thought I would be the clown.  I’m really pretty quiet at work.  During the long, boring training I would do things to amuse myself.  On one day in particular, none of us could make proper sentences.  I said it was a catching case of mushy peas.   Mushy peas is a dish made by Nigella Lawson, a lovely British chef who has a show called Nigella Bites.  It always seemed to fit my days where I couldn’t retrieve words or speak properly.  I always make a joke to alleviate my discomfort with that.  So, my trainer picked it up and now it’s common to hear in the office.  My trainer also kept calling me Pam, because I look like her friend Pam.   She couldn’t remember my name.  It became problematic when a girl I’ve become friends with at work, M. , started calling me Wynona because I look like Wynona Ryder with long hair.  Finally, to help the trainer, I took the post-it note she had with my name on it and stuck it to my forehead.  I can do this with a straight face.  There was much laugher and oh, Temple, you’re so funny…she remembered my name after that though.  I find so many of the inane details of work entertaining, I suppose that’s my salvation.  I have this staple remover with a magnetic end.  I remove a lot of staples, so I find it very entertaining to get them off my desk with that little end.  I had an ergonomic evaluation done, which as far as we can tell is just for show because they’ve changed nothing.  I’m not tall and my legs are supposed to be at a 90 degree angle.  This means I have a little step-stool thingy underneath my desk.  The ergonomic guy kept touching me and telling me the same things over and over.  I think I made him nervous.   He spent 5 minutes with J. who really needs to adjust his space because he’s so tall.  He said, over and over, don’t let your feet be on an island.   Meaning that I’m comfortable with my feet there so I don’t turn all the way around when I needed to.  I laugh still when I move around from my island to another spot.  I hate my job because it’s not what I feel like I should be doing.  I went to school and did all the right things so I could do what I felt I should be doing.  The only way to do it every day is to remember that it’s only temporary…to find the humor and the details that amuse me or make me think.  Having to go there every day makes me more motivated to find a way to stop going there, which is to let my writing take off.  It’s forced me to deal with my scheduling difficulties in new ways, and brought progress there.  It’s supporting me, barely, and giving my poor mind relief from the details of the war.  There is relief and purpose to even mundane details we all must deal with.  Our mission is to look around and find them.  It’s our most important education.  It breeds discipline (my weakness), structure, perspective, gratitude.  I look at people in my office like L. who cannot find a positive detail in her work day.  How lucky I am that I can find reasons for it, find out why it’s there and why I must honor it now…even if I hate it.  One day, I will be writing for a living and telling you about an editor that makes me want to jump out of my skin.  There will always, always be something that gets to us or that we hate.  Growth comes in embracing those things, making them yours, finding the spin.  Just being willing to try that brings unforeseen gifts and enrichment to our lives and spirits.

       “You carry away with you a reflection of me, a part of me. I dreamed you; I wished for your existence. You will always be a part of my life. If I love you, it must be because we shared, at some moment, the same imaginings, the same madness, the same stage."  -  Anais Nin  (from Henry and June)  “I am two fools, I know, for loving, and saying so.” -  John Donne    Darkness is winning this night.  Deep, rich icky black.  I seek inside myself to find the bright center, the girl who beats the demon.  This night, I fail.  I find layers of velvety, heavy enveloping darkness.  Lined with layers of self-doubt and crisp new thoughts of failure.  Failure to find, failure to connect, failure to accommodate…acclimate…adapt.  The darkness has layers full of texture and depth.  A richness full of the realization that maybe when I fall, I just fall.  Maybe when I crash, I just bleed.  Maybe when I try, I just fail.  Maybe the dream will always be just that, a dream.  Even Temple’s words do not reach this place.  The tortured place, magnified, but not entirely of my own making.  I say, do not give up.  Do not stop loving.  Do not stop dreaming and seeking and traveling.  Another day, light will find me.  Most likely in a form and at a time I least expect.  This night, I am swathed in this painful, wretched, destructive darkness.  I can’t help but wonder if there ever will come a time when I should just accept that there is a possibility that my place in this world, my mission, lies in helping others find their light…bringing them love and peace and confidence…so they may find what they seek.  And, if so, is that mission so heavy and complicated that I would not be able to find those very things for myself?  More times than I care to think about have I been told that I have helped, taught much and opened eyes.  I am influenced by this soft, dark place…but my heart breaks at the concept of this.  The concept that I will never find what I seek.  That I will never be loved the way I love.  That never will these lessons I so heartily instruct upon be rewarding by allowing me to enjoy the fruit of that labor myself, rather than sending it off into the world to be enjoyed by another.  Forgive my wallow in this place.  Sometimes even Temple must live here for a while.  This is my new, temporary home.  This is called steering into the skid.  Embracing the pain and sadness.  I cannot pretend that my heart is not broken.  I cannot pretend that I don’t feel betrayed in some way.  Abandoned.  I cannot pretend that I understand why I’m not worthy of the effort or the conversation.  I cannot pretend that the small voice inside my heart still wonders in the deep trenches of this place why I am not good enough…why I am not loved.  If I am truly loveable.  Questions such as these have been pondered in this place before.  Eventually, the light will find me.  Where and when is still unknown.  For now, I have to believe there is value here for me, as strange as that sounds.  I am spending time under water…deep in the sea…busy in discovering every creature and trinket.  Upon surfacing, I have a new perspective.  Alas, I speak that only as a goal…a distant hope.  This night, and following nights, the questions will continually cycle.  Why am I so easy to walk away from?  Why am I not loved?  I sometimes wonder if I love those who do not know how to love back out of some sick familiarity.  In this brand new moment with these all too familiar questions, even the logic and reason is beaten down by merciless pain and searing sadness.  I cannot find peace here.  I cannot find peace yet.  The sounds of slicing and ripping and tearing of my poor, weary war-torn heart echo throughout this place…throughout my mind.  It is simple here.  I am not enough.  I am not wanted.  I am not loved.   The warning is clearly written:  enter at own risk.  Truly loving and giving of ourselves always risks bringing devastation and loss.  I did that.  I gave truly and sincerely all of my love.  Later, that will bring comfort.  Now, the voice says, what were you thinking?  Why did you not see what was happening?  In truth, maybe I did.  In truth, maybe I wanted to love anyway.  In this place, the truth fails to soothe the demon.  It is said that the real happiness in love comes from loving.  If that’s true, then I was very happy.  I loved well, I did.  Attempts at light and comfort are lost on me.  I journey down the road to find it closed to me.  Still the embattled traveler.  I suppose all that’s left to do is dig in, feel it, let it ride.  Conversations with the demon.  I carry with me…one true feeling…one true bright spot, tiny as it may be...a day will come when this will be remembered.  I will be spoken of.  Memories of my love will bring a smile.  In that moment, there will be thoughts of what was risked…what was lost…what was sacrificed on the alter of convenience.  Maybe for a fleeting minute…or maybe for more in depth contemplation…it will be known and felt and realized.  Questioned.  Missed.   For now, the demon and I have much to say.  I must get inside its head to find the way to defeat it.  It, rather than my love, will be my constant companion for some time to come.  I must win this battle.  I cannot accept defeat.  I crawl back into velvety darkness where I can be very small, and very sad, and sleep until the next confrontation with the beast.  I suppose this is how it’s done.  How it’s always been done.  That knowledge brings me no comfort.

       "Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things you didn't do than by the ones you did do. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover." -  Mark Twain     Woke up at 3:30 in the morning with thoughts bumping around in my mind and forcing conscious thought.  I went to bed early, but not early enough to make up for this.  I realized pretty quickly that there would be no more sleep for me this morning.  I didn’t get up though.  I petted Petie who was snuggled against my belly.  For once, it wasn’t him that woke me.  In my mind I washed over everything going on right now.  Looked for solutions.  Looked for ways to make things better, steps to take.  In those half-asleep hours listening to Sarah McLaughlin in my still-dark room, dreading the moment I had to commit to leaving such solace, I wrote letters in my mind and made plans.  For a few moments, everything was clear.  Finally, I forced myself to get up and dislodged my fuzzy boy.  Otherwise I would fall asleep 10 minutes before the alarm went off and sleep in too late.  My mind was so busy.  I had been having a hard time breathing, and when I came into the living room I could smell smoke.  The screen door was open a little bit and I pushed it open further to smell outside.  It was just after 5 a.m. and it smelled like someone was having a fire.  Odd time for a fire, I thought.  Plus, it was 65 degrees.  Then again, this is California and anything goes.  I found out on the way to work that the Cabrillo Bridge, which is 90 years old, was on fire.  It’s just down from my apartment.  It goes over the 163 which runs out of downtown and takes me to work.  Needless to say, that freeway was closed and I was on another freeway going another direction.  I had to get to work another way.  I panicked at first because I didn’t know another way.  I just kept driving, and the proper exit presented itself.  Making changes, big changes that tell all those of the “you should do this or that” variety that we don’t buy their restrictions on our happiness, take determination and perseverance.  I feel strong and scared…brave and crazy…all at once.  I can’t live the life others say I should.  It’s hard to stick up for what is our right to pursue, what we deserve as people.  There is this fear that creeps in, saying that we are unworthy of such declarations.  That speaking our minds will only result in judgment and abandonment.   Unfortunately, this is the truth sometimes.  The question is how much are we willing to sacrifice to be doing the right thing in someone else’s eyes?  I believe in standing strong, heels dug into sand, and stating my case.  Show my belief.  I believe in picking my battles as well, which includes choosing which societal norm to buck.  My mind ponders the roads to travel.  Creates a map.   I start big, but whittle down to a doable plan and build an itinerary.  It’s my journey, it’s my adventure.  At the end of the day, tired and weary, I alone live in my shoes…my skin…my heart.  I must be steadfast and strong when believing in my own worth and my right to have the life I choose.   As my mind peruses plans and the best way to travel on this rocky, unfamiliar, and often lonely road, there are road blocks and wrong turns.  The key to any adventure is to take everything that happens, pleasant or not, as part of the overall experience.  Pull what you can from it as part of a creation of an even better map, and discard what you don’t need.  Lately, I’m tripping on rocks and skinning my knees.  In the quiet, lonely wee hours of my morning I feel sore and hungry for the destination.  I’m out of band-aids, low on water, and my compass is broken.  The challenge for the embattled traveler is to find other resources and continue on.  Every time I find myself lost on the path or heartbroken from a new obstacle, I’m actually one step closer to arriving at the place I seek.  The mind finds ways through the puzzle…through the rejection or fear or sadness or doubt…and as we keep taking one step, then one more, it rewards us by bringing new light to our darkness.   The darkness envelopes and consumes.  It changes form.  It becomes misty, determined, wispy and clever seeping into our skin with every opportunity.  It brings forth our insecurities.  It brings forth our feeling that we don’t deserve to arrive at the destination we seek.  It exploits self-doubt and old demons for its own joy and satisfaction.  This, my fellow travelers, is not the time to quit.  Tempting old negative thoughts and the comfort of familiar spaces compete hard for the victory.  Not today fellas.  This is my championship.  I am the champion.  I will not be beaten.  I will not be broken.  I will not retreat.   I am worthy of love and happiness.  I am worthy of this journey.  I am worthy of the destination.  I am powerful and persistent.    Sometimes, when darkness is most threatening to beat us down…when we forget the road we have traveled so far and the destinations reached…we must reach into the recesses of our minds and remind ourselves just how far we’ve come.  When I was 14 I lived with my Mom and her husband Jay (Dad #2).  He worked all the time, so did she, and both drank excessively.  I had already lost my virginity and had a boyfriend practically living in the house with us right under my parent’s noses.  He slept there every night, and stayed there after we all had left.  He was dark and possessive and sadistic.  He never hit me, but he had this way of getting in my head and mucking about.  Our demons don’t arrive unescorted.  They are carefully or recklessly placed by others and become the guests that never leave.  Dean was his name, and finally coming to my senses I let him go.  I found a new boyfriend shortly after.  Someone kind and sweet and funny who I remain friends with to this day.  His name is Erik.  One night, I was staying with Erik, his sister, my best friend and Erik’s best friend in the basement of Erik’s mom’s office (she was a doctor) that we had semi-converted into an apartment.  It was spring break.  I never had supervision, but I think I told my parents I was staying with Erik’s sister (they did live together).  I still can’t believe they let me go with that.  I had come home to get clothes and the phone rang.  It was Dean.  Jealous and evil and manipulative.  He began telling me that I couldn’t live without him, that I would never be loved, that he was the only one that would ever love me.  He began telling me all the things Erik and I had been doing, where we went, what I wore.  He was a big boy, Dean, lifted weights…very strong…good in a fight.  Liked to fight.  Erik was gentle with these big blue-gray eyes, long eyelashes, freckles, and sorta skinny.  Dean began to tell me that he would hurt Erik because Erik would eventually hurt me.  I don’t really know what else he said because I was hysterical at this point.  I had this bright yellow doughnut phone.  The earpiece is “C” shaped, hard to drop.  My hands were shaking and sweating and I kept dropping the phone.  At some point I grabbed a razor blade, held it about three feet over my wrist and slammed it down hard.  I did the other one, not as effectively, and then began cutting down the length of my wrist.  Blood was pumping out of my right wrist with my heartbeat.  Fortunately, my best friend had called while I was on the phone with Dean and knew something was wrong.  She came rushing over to help.  I don’t remember what happened next really.  I remember my doctor, our family doctor came to the hospital to stitch me up (what they did back then), being so angry with me.  I kept turning away.  He said, no…called me by my first and middle name…I want you to watch this.  I want you to realize what you did.  In Dean’s defense, I was a sad girl and this was under the surface.  After it all happened, there were doctors and appointments.  Erik went to group therapy with me and never left my side.  I let one person pull my already residing demons out and let them take over me.  I let that same person place more demons in my head that set up shop in my fragile psyche.  The darkness won that round.  I still have the scars from that day.  In the thick, blind night when fear is beckoning, I touch them…on my wrist and in my mind.  They now stand for survival, not weakness.  Erik and I were together about six months, an eternity when you are 14, but remained very close all through school and even after I went away to college.  I’ll have to tell you more about him some day.  He was my light.  He was my friend and my voice that said, wait, look at the whole picture.  He was one person of many who stepped in to protect me and help me.  That was a very dark time.  I hadn’t tripped on a rock on this journey, I fell off a cliff.  I remember that because now, I can be the source of my own light…and if I can’t, I know how to recognize other sources of light better.  I think that was the first really significant time in my life that I realized I just had to hold on and ride it out.  I kept noticing the yin and yang of lightness and dark.  How really good things also can come with really hard things.  Like love.  Like growth.  Like success.   Holding on to the soft, sweet, light parts helps us trudge through the deep, dark night with coyotes calling and no flashlight.  Lightness comes in all forms.  I don’t think that the goal is reaching new destination after new destination…but in learning how to live and learn and find light on the road.  I hear you saying, Temple, you’ve said this before.  We know this.  I wonder, if we know it…in that place in our soul where our life’s breath is…why is the darkness still such a surprise?

        “The best ideas come after you think you’ve run out of them.”  --Unknown    I often wonder about my choices in men and about the things that I find comfort in.  I think it always goes back to childhood, even if it wasn’t a very good one.  The other day, I was driving somewhere and I took the wrong exit off of the freeway.  I looked around, trying to figure out where I was, and saw this little Mexican girl sitting with her Mother in metal folding chairs just outside the open garage door of an auto shop.  She was about 4, dressed all in pink with little curly pigtails tied up in those glass ball ponytail holders I remember.  Boys may not remember those.  Her Mom was holding out a bag of chips or something, and she was biting her tongue in focus trying to grab a handful with one little hand.  The neighborhood is a familiar site in San Diego.  Little Mexico almost.  Signs are in all in Spanish.  Cute, colorful little houses with front yards full of cars and bars on the doors and windows.  Abuelitas walking down the street trying to contain six or seven bubbly grandchildren.  Families on porches laughing and arguing.  My family did little together, so driving through these parts of town always makes me a bit sad.  Culturally, Hispanic families always do so much together…by choice or necessity, no matter.  I have had two very close Mexican friends who let me be part of their families from time to time.  I don’t speak Spanish, so I didn’t follow everything, but they were always warm and inclusive with me.  Today, this little girl reminds me of me when I was just a little older than her.  My mom’s second husband and the man who I consider my father, Jay, used to own many gas stations when I was growing up.  They were all around Albuquerque.  He sold Native American jewelry of silver and turquoise from the stations.  I would go see him and run and run and he’d pick me up in the air.  He’d laugh and his cigarette would dangle dangerously from his lip.  He was so handsome.  Tall and blond with green eyes.  Big smile.  I still think he's one of the most handsome men ever.  I say Daddy, I need to marry a guy like you.  He laughs, then shakes his head and says, don't you dare.  I would sit on those same metal folding chairs and eat Bugles from the vending machine.  I thought they were the best.  I’d put one on each finger and eat them off one by one.  Sometimes the guys in the shop would come up and eat them off my fingers, too.  I felt like a princess in this dirty, greasy place surrounded by dirty, greasy men.  I guess some thing’s never change.  I still love a man who works with his hands and the smell of a gas station takes me back home.  Daddy would come home dirty and let me use the Lava and the wire bristle brush to scrub his hands.   They always stayed a little dirty.  Now, he’s the big boss and doesn’t own gas stations but owns the largest, maybe the second largest, auto body shop in all of New Mexico.  His hands are clean now and he wears a tie.  When I go see him, I still get a big hug.  Only now, the boys in the shop aren’t allowed to touch my fingers.  I used to protest in high school, but Dad, stop hiring such cute guys then!  He would just look at me and call me by my full name with a clenched jaw.  I loved boys with long hair back then, but my Dad wouldn’t have it in the shop.  After awhile, he started hiring long haired boys because he found that there was no connection between hair length and a good mechanic.  I’d come home from college and gleefully traipse through the shop in tight jeans, tight shirts and boots checking out the new boys.  They would smile and stare and wonder who I was.  No one was allowed to walk through the shop like that.  Someone would whisper, that’s the boss’s daughter, dude…and smiling faces would get back to work.    In high school, my Dad gave me a job.  He’d done it before, but I would just go out back with the guys and smoke pot.  I figured I better quit before I got me in trouble or them fired.  I still have Gulf gas station shirts with my name on the front from the first time he got me a job.  I was only 13, but I begged.  I would go in during the summer and pump gas…remember full service?...and wash windows.  I was the cashier, too, but that was before the cash registers told you what to do and you had to make change in your head.  I wasn’t very good at it then, but I was cute and young and smiled a lot, so people were mostly understanding.  The second time he gave me a job, in high school, I was pulling all the cars in at night and crashed into one of the walls.  I drive much better now, but I was never good driving big vehicles in small spaces.  I brought that up with a nervous smile to my Dad last time I saw him.  He just did that half smile and shook his head, as he so often does where I’m concerned.    To this day, muscle cars and auto shops and the way they smell always remind me of being that little girl with Bugles on her fingertips.   A strong man who is capable and good with his hands gets me all giddy.  Doesn’t have to be cars, it can be building furniture or construction or landscaping.  As I drive now, through this little Mexico in San Diego, I smile at the little girl and her Mom, who wave at me.  Little adorable Mexican children run by giggling.  I’m totally lost, but somehow, I know exactly where I am.  Sitting on a metal folding chair at a gas station by the Rio Grande.

       “Love, not reason should make your decisions. Decisions based on reason are karmic. The Heart is mad, and the Heart is the ground I call you to walk on.” -  Adi Da Samraj    Peppermint tea has become my elixir.  Warm and honey sweet.  Minty goodness makes my mouth all tingly.  I can’t seem to eat anything, so temple’s magic tea must do.  I sit today listing to Lady Bianca sing, “Made Up My Mind” and teetering on some weird phantom line between exquisite self-discovery, devastating pain from loss, and frustration from life’s general acerbic wit.  I know, you are wondering about my title.  I’ve got you wondering if temple has let go of her cargo and seduced a priest in the name of entertainment.  I will talk more about the lovely and versatile sentence shortly.  For now, let me say, it is not literal.  But it could be.  And there is no priest involved.  Well, directly anyway.  Having said that, let’s move on for now.  My life has been fielding some rather interesting developments as of late.  Some good, some bad, some intriguing, and some downright miserable.  I would first like to say thank you so much to my dear and sweet friends, and even those who don’t know me who gave me a kind word, for your comments and emails.  I know you were concerned about me, and I love you for it.  I have been going rounds with the demon.  I slay.  He comes back strong.  I reason.  Sometimes we have tea and discuss the situation.  I’ve found him often times reasonable, even.  Not today.  Today, he is tempting me…torturing me.  Such is the nature of these situations.  We feel we’ve found some solid ground to place our shaky legs, and something new and sharp gets ground in our face with no thought of new wounds (or even of interfering with the healing of old wounds) and we fall down again.  Some time and distance brings new perspective.  It also makes solid some old beliefs.  To have the knowledge that you may have found home for yourself, then to blow the house up, well, that’s when I wrap hands up and take fighting stance.  It’s a scary thought to deal with and to try to move past.  Maybe I won’t…maybe another truth will reveal itself…maybe it’s okay just not to know anything right now.  I just keep wondering though, how my love wasn’t enough to warrant some cautionary steps when it comes to my heart now.  The demon and I will be enemies who respect each other and over time I will learn his weaknesses.  He will not stop me from finding happiness, not ever again.  It will all be very Art of War.  In addition to conversations with said demon, my brain is betraying me again.  The brain injury has never been completely treated nor have I been able to seek full rehab, simply due to bad doctors and that strange need I have to have money for food and rent…so I had to work.  I am looking into creative solutions for my problem.  I was under doctor’s orders recently to miss work, substantial work, and now am in some pretty deep financial trouble.   I am monumentally dizzy, and very nauseas.  Violently sometimes.  Just waves come over me of both and if I’m lucky I’m not driving.  Of course my neurologists can’t agree, but the main belief is that this is due to the brain stem injury.  Makes me all those things and effects my vision.  If I try to read or write too much I just get that kind of fatigue where you can’t do one more thing and must go to bed.  There is a stress component, but some of it is the mystery of the brain and how to treat it.  I’ve lost probably six pounds in the last week simply because I can’t eat.  There is new medication and I have some hope for it, but it’s not the whole problem.  My boss has been a rock star and I plan to go back to work Monday.  As I recently told another friend going through a difficult situation, we just have to keep our eyes open and look for creative ways to solve problems…be resourceful…and not beat ourselves up for feeling angry or bitter or whatever we feel on this journey.  It’s only important that we don’t pitch a tent at Camp Bitter and let it consume us.  I dream of having the power to fast forward time…or at least being able to see forward…to when all of these situations that tug and pull at my heart and body are resolved and I know what the future holds.  So far no luck, but I’ll let you know.  Between body and heart, I’ve been pretty damn miserable.  But, as you will probably guess, I don’t see this as all bad.  There is another side to it.    While I’ve been out of work, and in this last week, there have been really lovely and good things, too.  My best friend is out of school now, so she can breathe and we’ve been able to chat.  She’s finally able to read some of the Gidget.  She’s coming to visit soon, before class starts once again.  (Right mama tool?)  In a couple of weeks or so, a totally new friend will be in town for work and we will go get a drink and hang out in pacific beach.  He writes a blog on blogspot, check him out:  urlLink  The Highwayman    He’s got a great sense of humor and I thought it would be fun to go hang out.  He was stationed in the navy here years ago and really misses it.   In this free time, things have slowed down and I’ve been able to get in touch with my thoughts…the calm, logical ones…and sort out some things that desperately need to be sorting out.  Thinking about what I want, what I need, what I’m being unreasonable about, and what I’m not being staunch enough on.  Standing in a place of peace, even when there is turmoil around me, puts me in a position to realize that my spiritual beliefs always have the guidance for me.  The answers are always inside me, and when I just let things be and not try to fix it or force it so much they float into my mind and soul as if they were just waiting for me to open the door.  A couple of weeks ago, someone asked me what my vision of my life is, of my future.  I described it, but I always leave a lot open because you don’t know what the universe will bring.  I still stand strong in that vision, but there are now certain portions of it that remain uncertain, undefined.  It’s okay.  I feel very strong in standing where I am, looking into that vision, knowing what the core of me wants, and letting much of it remain unspoken.  The thing about life that can be either frustrating or infuriating, depending on your current perspective, is that it doesn’t reveal itself all at once.  (Hence my desire to fast forward and check it out.)  We don’t know which decisions are right, which are wrong, what path will lead us to where we want to go, and even if where we want to go is the same address as we think now.  I believe, today, that the lesson in part is about how we handle the changes.  How we handle the uncertainty.  Our willingness to grow and evolve on the path…on the journey…will define the destination in such a big way.  So, here we are, at sex in the rectory.  There is, in fact, a rectory.  There is a priest that lives there, but I don’t know him.  I know the other person who lives there, who is most definitely not a priest.  We’ll call him Drifter.  He wrote this amazing haiku, which I will share with you.  Drifter writes many lovely things, but I asked for this one specifically.  The sentence, my title,  is not really about literal meaning.  It encapsulates all the new and different and interesting things going on in my life.  It’s not a sentence I have ever said before, or written before, that’s for sure.  It’s about the universe bringing you something, or someone, that helps you see things in a new way.  Looking at old things with new eyes.  It’s about remembering that even though your heart cries out for something to happen, that you can find new pathways and you can stop spending all of your time with the demon.  The sounds my heart makes…still cry out for home, still cry out for my garden with sunflowers and a beach cottage in May.  Those are powerful sounds.  I stand at a crossroads now.  Looking at my present.  Looking at the future I want.  Realizing that the future takes time to reveal itself, I stand ready to learn what I need to in order to accept what it brings.  For now, I make plans and I play and I cry for the sounds in my heart.  I am reminded that I am strong and that new things are possible.  It’s an interesting place to be.  Darkness and light together in each moment, in each decision, in each quiet night just before sleep.  I know I make it sound so simple, sometimes it is.  Then again, sometimes I’m standing in the kitchen making tea or just having a normal conversation with someone, and tears force their way to the surface.  Stinging my face, they remind me that all is not yet well.  These times in life…these growth spurts…are painful.  They require constant reevaluation, constant shifting and readjustment.  That’s the growth.  That’s how we learn to do better next time, or how to find beauty in the middle of chaos.  Our love, our heartbreak, it’s there with us.  Those questions we have about ourselves, our worth, they are there with us.  We must learn to listen to other voices, too.  The ones that support us, ask how we are, remind us of our strength, point out new positive points.  The ones that take the emotional risk to say those things, that open up to us in our time of darkness…of frustration and sorrow.  We must listen to those voices, too, and not let the river of doubt and sadness sweep us away.  One day, there may be the home I envisioned.  Or, there may be sex in the rectory…in the literal sense.  What a post that will be.  Until then, I seek solace in those who embrace me even now when it is all very complicated.  I seek solace in the people who love me…here at home and on other continents.  I seek solace in those things I know to be true, even if they walk hand in hand with the demon.  I know (most of the time) that if I keep putting it out there, if I keep looking inside, and I’m true to myself,  I will find what I am looking for.  This is Drifter’s haiku:   Nimble   Heaven-spanning tree, ivy-covered rocks and ferns:  see me steal your words.

       “If there is any great secret of success in life, it lies in the ability to put yourself in the other person’s place and to see things from his point of view – as well as your own.” -  Henry Ford    I’ve been trying for days to sit and write this post.  Seems like I have not quite learned the lessons I need to, because the universe just keeps piling it on.  I said tonight that I wish it would just give me a week to breathe and catch up.  My health, the health of one of my favorite aunt’s (Judy) who is now in hospital very ill and they don’t know why, worrying about this wretched war and those I love being caught up in it.  Not to mention work and money and trying, still after all these years, to learn how to organize and handle and pace myself.  I speak to Joan every week, who I’ve mentioned before but I can’t remember to what degree.  She is a psychologist that is an expert in post-traumatic stress disorder (which I have) and in brain injuries…well, trauma in general.  She’s awesome, gorgeous, straight shooter.  She’s back in Denver, so we chat on the phone.  She tells me what she sees because she knows mine is not a problem of not trying to sort it out on my own.  She is endlessly repeating to me that I am not the girl who lived life at 100 miles an hour with her hair on fire, but that I am a new person that must sometimes take out all unnecessary things from my life to survive.  Work and doctors is what I’m left with, and I can’t live like that anymore.  I haven’t figured out the way yet.  I get so angry at what I’ve lost.  This is new for me.  I get scared that I will never be rid of this constant shifting or that I will ever figure out how to live in some peace with my new brain.  As I write this, The Scientist comes on.  My apartment smells like peppermint and rosemary from my conditioner.  Sensory things always bring life to my weary mind.  I am so afraid that I won’t get beyond it.  That I am stuck in a time loop of some kind and things will never sort themselves out.  I don’t feel this way all the time, but right now I certainly do.  I can’t do what I need to for me, and I can’t do what I need to for the people I love.  I suppose on some days, I just don’t have faith in the process anymore.  It’s time to get back to basics, part of this process.  I get better at it each time, so that is good.  I find basics in the smell of the ocean, the feel of Petie’s fur, the sound of Trinity’s laughter, the taste of peppermint tea or warm, red wine.  It’s the smallest details we take for granted.  The touch of someone’s hand on your skin, the smell of clean sheets, music.  It’s remembering that I do have a job, that is really working with me even in spite of it all…that I have a car…that there is laughter and plans and hope for new things…that there are people I can talk to that love me…that I’m writing and putting it out there.  I had none of that six months ago.  It’s a stretch when so much is on my mind and my heart is heavy to find pleasure in what life does give me instead of what it’s taken away.  I must fake it sometimes, pretend to agree with the universe that all is well.  Speak words of gratitude when I really just want to throw something.  I keep telling myself that when it gets much easier, when I can find the center without so much struggle, I will have solved this particular puzzle.  That challenges will mean less adversity because I will have accepted them and found a way to put them in their proper place.  Things seem about to shift, to change, when I think I get most frustrated.  So close, my fingers ache to touch.  Not yet within my grasp.  One of the things that’s been on my mind lately is something that’s happened to one of my favorite people and my close friend, Trinity.  That is not her real name, but my nickname for her.  She has had something happen to her so grim and black that she cannot speak of it.  Her life is so painful, so many horrible things, one on top of the other, that I can hardly forgive myself sometimes for even complaining.  She has such a good heart, such a sweet and loving person, and I cry because I cannot help her.  I’m going to share something with her, and you, now…as my way of letting her know that I love her and she’s not alone.  To share this, in detail, is the kind of scary that makes me want to climb out of my skin.  The kind that causes you to take a quick intake of breath and realize what you are about to do.  Anyway, here’s my story…the only way I can tell it.   Sara came out of the 7-11 holding a bottle of Gatorade in her small hand.  She could hold it in one hand, good and strong, even though it was big.  Everything was falling down on her head and she felt overwhelmed and sad.  She drove out of the parking lot as the little chubby Mexican girl hopped off the school bus, flashing a peace sign at her friends as it drove away.  Sara smiled, but then felt that smile was a betrayal of everything she felt.  She floored the car and shifted quickly into overdrive, flying over San Francisco type hills on her way to work.  On the freeway, she pulled past a bouncing Wells Fargo armored car and thought to herself how the contents of that truck would solve so many problems.  She could take care of herself.  She could go back east and take care of her friend, too.  The thought of it all brought tears streaming down her face, and she knew it was time to tell her tale.    When Sara was in her early 20s, she was wild.  Different boys, parties all the time, crazy risks.  She managed to stay in school and relatively safe, but eventually she took a chance that would change her life.  She and a friend, Lana, were at their favorite dance club flirting and collecting numbers.  Sara was driving, so there were no drinks for her, but she was having fun all the same.  She spotted a tall, dark haired, beautiful boy across the room and fixed her gaze on him until he looked over.  She smiled, he smiled, she played the game.  Eventually, he made his way over to her.  He had friends with him and Sara and Lana knew other people at the bar, but Lana was still bitter because she was without a hook up.  While she pouted, Sara and the boy, Willie, danced and got to know each other a little too intimately on the dance floor.    As the night broke up, Willie and friends mention a party afterward.  Sara, as usual, was up for it, and told Lana that they should go.  Lana always wanted to be the one with the most attention, although it usually worked out about equal, and bitterly snapped that she would go home since she had her own car.  Sara tried to make her feel better and tried to get her to go with her to the party, but to no avail.  She drove off without so much as a wave.  Sara and Willie stood in the parking lot with about 15 other people, and cars going by with people shouting out that they would see them at the party.  Willie was being charming and playful, telling her how safe she’d be with all those people there.  Against her better judgment, Sara agreed to follow him over.  They walked in…her, Willie, his friend, and some random girl…to the an empty apartment.  Immediately, Sara told herself she just fucked up and should go home.  She didn’t trust the other guy, and never saw the other girl at the bar.  Willie makes drinks, which Sara doesn’t touch, and shortly realizes that no one else is coming.  The random girl is bumping and grinding herself all over this guy like no one was in the room.  Go, Sara said to herself, go now.  Willie was smiling and acting apologetic.  She didn’t go.  Finally, to her relief, the other couple headed off to the bedroom.  When she asked Willie where that girl came from, he nonchalantly said she was a hooker.  Fear in the pit of her belly wouldn’t stop, but she kept telling herself she was overreacting.  Willie was being a perfect gentleman, she thought, it’s like a date.  No big deal.  Within a few minutes of the departure of the other couple, Willie was kissing her.  Sweet at first, more forcibly as it went.  He was slamming hands into her shirt and yanking her skirt up.  She had fought off over eager men, but something about Willie and this situation was different.  She just kept saying, you like this guy, he’s been sweet all night, there is no problem here.  Willie was about 6’2,” 220 pounds or so.  Sara was not even 5’5” and weighed maybe 117.  He stood up and asked her to go in the bedroom, she said no and stood up.  He said, let’s watch a movie then.  She breathed a huge sigh of relief.  He put a movie in and pushed the coffee table out of the way so they could sit on the floor.  He turned the lights off.  She sat with him for a few minutes and he was all over her again, on top of her, pushing clothing aside harshly without much ceremony.  She pushed his hands away and said no, which would dissuade him for a moment or two, then he’d be back at it.  He pushed her skirt up around her waste and tried to yank her panties off.  She shook her head, said no, and tried to pull her left leg out from underneath him so she could close her legs.  He pulled his hand away and readjusted himself so his body was more squarely on top of her and pushed her legs open with his knee.  Before she could really understand what had happened, he pulled her panties aside and was inside her.  His weight was on her, but her hands were free.  She didn’t know what to do.  Tears were running down her cheeks and she began to quietly sob.  She told her self just to wait because it would be over soon.  He got up, finally, and Sara sat up disoriented.  He wouldn’t look at her.  He never looked in her face the rest of that night.  She ran into the bathroom and cried for what seemed like a very long time.  Denial set in.  She asked herself, what is wrong with you?  You like this guy.  It was just sex.  She didn’t really understand all the conflicting emotions that took over her as she looked in her tear stained face in the mirror.  She wanted to pretend it was just bad sex.  She couldn’t handle thinking it was anything else.  She cleaned herself up, and went out into the living room.  Willie was about getting ready to go.  In one last humiliating effort to deny what just happened to her, Sara wrote down her phone number and gave it to him.  He held her hand and walked her to the car.  It was as if neither could grasp it.  She told no one.  Weeks later, she started to see a counselor for nightmares.  It came out in a session.  Sweetheart, said the counselor, you were raped.  That was rape.  In the years to follow, Sara told few people.  Once a boyfriend told her it was her fault for going with him.  She didn’t tell anyone for a while.  Her own parents still don’t know.  As she got older, she realized that she is responsible for the bad choice of going with Willie alone.  She was guilty of bad judgment.  She was NOT responsible for the rape.  It was not her fault.  It was not because she was wrong or bad or deserved it or was wearing a mini-skirt.  Of course it was confusing because it was date rape and there were conflicting thoughts and feelings were involved.  In no situation does a woman deserve to be raped or blamed for her rape.  Any friend that tells you otherwise is not your friend.   I love you, Trin.  I’m here when you need me.  One in four women report being raped.  I didn’t.  Trinity didn’t.  Imagine how high it really is?

       “A candle loses nothing by lighting another candle.” –  James Keller    I don’t want to write.  That is when I need to write most.  That is when people tell me to write, and tell me what becomes of me if I don’t.  Now, here I am and there are too many little nuggets of wisdom or clarity or expression in my head competing for attention.  Songs…poems… some random little writing here or there.  Staind sings… it’s always raining in my head …Foo Fighters sing… it’s times like these you learn to live again .  I am swept away in the expressions of my feelings towards others.  I am also swept away in other’s expressions for me today.  I can’t pinpoint how I’m feeling.  Happy, basically, and solid in what I need to do to continue to rebuild.  Yet, there is this manic energy…restlessness…can’t sleep much.  I’m sensitive and irritable.  Intolerant.  Introspective, connected, serene, secure.   Different sides of me with different functions compete for space.  I think, mostly, I can present the poet.  The warrior, feeling protective and betrayed and cautious, punches through with solid rights and round-house kicks.  Takes over, builds that energy, tries to right wrongs.  I’ve found the warrior to be a valuable part of me, the reason I get through the things I do and survive painful and grizzly obstacles.  Slays the demons.  Functions through migraines.  Tackles injustice or unfairness.  Problem is, when the warrior is buzzing with hypersensitivity and purpose and pride, the poet can’t get through to handle the small shit – as Dr. Dre says.  I write to remember the poet and praise the warrior, to find the balance I need.  It’s been a really good few days, with some gritty bits mixed in for good measure.  I was totally punk rock at work and got done what I needed to.   I felt, for the first time since I started, that I could put the time in until I could leave of my own volition and do work more suitable for me.  I spent days listening to Eminem and Ice Cube and absorbing an art form some people dismiss as not good enough.  The words, the sentiment, the stories in this music is so powerful.  That’s why the warrior in me uses it as fuel.  I think about things that have happened in my life and how they prevent me from being the girl I once was.  Then, I listen to Eminem say… Listen to the sound of me spilling my heart through this pen…motherfuckers know that I’ll never be Marshall again ....And here I sit, pouring heart through keys knowing I’ll never be able to go back to that girl.  People say, yes, Temple, I know, but isn’t it time to let it go?  Every day I try, but every day something new shows itself.  I’m still getting to know the person who lives in my house now, and she’s very different than the former tenant.  I don’t know how to handle things or predict how I will handle things.  I simply don’t know, and I imagine I won’t for a while.  Anyone who steps into my house must be willing to accept the battle of her and me…of poet and warrior…because it is my path and my focus.   Eminem says… seize the moment, try to freeze it and own it …which is I try to do every time I try to write anything.  Own it.  Examine it.  Apply it.  The cogs of the wheel continue to move and I see, bit by bit, pieces of my soul come to life in the world.  It’s in little things like meeting Erik, The Highwayman, for shrimp tacos and beer down on the beach.  We talk about the navy and work and admire steely waves and blue gray skies.  Just a normal day, but walking down the hallway to my apartment I remembered the feeling I was having.  It was familiar.  I connected with the girl I used to be, and in this way am still, and remember what it was like to live my life.  I left a comment for a total stranger, met him for drinks, and it was fun and fine and I didn’t blow up or fall down.  In fact, we are having breakfast tomorrow.  Today, I had lunch with Emma.  Lovely Emma, who I adore.  We sat outside at this French bistro downtown as the sun was shining and the wind was blowing a little.  It was perfect.  Warm enough, not too cool.  We sat under the umbrella and had salmon salad and mochas and chocolate mouse cake.  I told Emma stories about my life and the people in it, new and old.  She told me of hers and some challenges she faces.  The theme was perspective, finding happiness…or creating sorrow…in any situation.  How there are gifts from the universe every day in the form of people or signs or even a movie quote or a song…and those gifts are there to open our eyes to what beauty is around us.  That is how we shift perspective.  I used the example of the man who lives in poverty with his wife and children.  He has a job that doesn’t pay well, but that he likes.  He and his family want for most everything.  He can say, my life is bad.  I have no money and nothing I need.  I cannot get ahead and I can’t take care of my family.  Or, he can look at his beautiful family who love him and take pride in a job well done, and find himself to be most blessed.  Today, I was a gift of perspective to Emma.  She was a gift of living to me.  As usual, I put it out here on virtual paper and I see tension drain from the warrior.  She is on guard now, feeling ready still to fight, but she sees that this moment is for the poet.   She is more defensive and wary than normal, partially due to that manic energy coursing through and battling it out with serene rivers, partially due to feeling quite wounded.  It’s hard to open up for most of us.  To let someone in, to risk the heartbreak or disappointment in the event things fall apart.  Sometimes, I have small quiet conversations with her in my spirit.  I comfort her.  I stroke her hair and say that life only feeds us when we live it…when we risk.  It’s time, I tell her, to let life in again.  I coaxed her down from her watch point, and the poet came to enjoy the fruits of a risk…the bounty of allowing someone to see our true self, pink and black and all colors in between.  She’s feeling angry and resentful with me…with the poet…because that risk brought pain.  When you let someone new in, and things go awry, there still must be tenderness and respect.  She lashed out at the first sign of dismissal, disregard, thoughtlessness.  It’s not always easy, in fact, sometimes downright impossible, to explain what we don’t ourselves understand.  Quiet reflection and time with our own thoughts brings some small understanding, but inside of us lives old pain that doesn’t always make itself understood.  It only makes itself known.  Now, sitting here as Solomon Burke soothes the beast and inspires the poet, I see that it was wrong to let her have control in those minutes.  I don’t feel bad right now, however, knowing she is close by.  Even though I didn’t handle this recent situation the best way I could have, harsh words and repeated blows…in indirect, but clear, ways…have me feeling that I need her protection a bit.  I am so very vulnerable, really, but you would never see that if you looked into my face right now.  Intentions to hurt me or make me sad still cut deep, and make me wonder if I was wrong in taking this particular risk…if maybe this person never held me in such high regard.  You never know with new people or new risks, but it comes back to what I said about my day with Emma…it’s about living again.  My life, the one I’m rebuilding.  That is the truest and most cherished blessing.  The poet and the warrior…the demons…Fred…the girl I once was…we all have our roles to play and paths to take to bring this to fruition.   I admit my mistakes, but stand firmly in my integrity and feel confident that I could risk…that I did try.  I will do it again and again, and some will stay, some will go, some will be ugly.  The poet reminds me that we live for those we keep in our hearts, that keep us in their hearts, that make it all worth it.

       ”Only in growth, reform, and change, paradoxically enough, is true security to be found. –  Anne Morrow Lindbergh    Gray, oppressive clouds invade me even though the sun is taunting me through the window.  Wretched sun.  Must it always show it’s gleeful grin when it knows I cannot play?  I trudged through frustration…anger…and some fear of what’s to come only to find deep, sticky sadness on the other side.  I feel dejected.  It’s a general sort of feeling that clings to thoughts and movement.  No specific purpose.  It’s the weekend of the 4th of July and I love fireworks.  Several times in Colorado this holiday went unnoticed, but it didn’t bother me as much.  Last time I celebrated the 4th here in San Diego, it was off brilliant.  I lived on the beach in Pacific Beach, behind Lahaina Bar.  I had a party and friends came and brought tons of beer.  I just left the front door open and my friends could wander in and grab one from the fridge.  The beach was awash with people all day, all night.  We walked across to the bay and watched fireworks explode over the still glass waters of Mission Bay.  Perfect.  Today I had to go down to PB to run an errand and it was so crazy with people.  I realized that they must have been doing fireworks tonight instead of tomorrow.  Boys everywhere lugging hug coolers while flip-flopped feet shuffled along and crinkled shirts stuck out of waistbands.  I had a panic attack.  I’m still not good about being around crowds, and I had planned to go to the grocery store down there since I was there.  It was so crowded and traffic was creep creeping along Mission Bay Blvd.  I turned around to go home feeling like this store would just send me over the edge.  Crestfallen, was I.  I love that beach.  I love that store.  I decided that I would be damned if I was going to let this bloody injury run me off of one more thing.  I flipped around again and pulled into the garage of the store.  Grocery shopping with a brain injury that can’t handle noise and details can be sheer madness.  You add that everyone from every inland town plus all surfers and beach girls and families in summer rentals were here buying picnic and barbeque fixins, and I was headed for a nervous breakdown.  I have a really hard time shopping when I’m not on my cognitive toes.  I walked into the store and my heart was racing, my skin was getting hot, I couldn’t focus my eyes.  It was awash of color, no details, no faces…just bright color and noise and no where to walk.  I thought that I would just pass out right there and die of embarrassment.  I swallowed hard and went about my task.  What I wouldn’t have given to have had boy’s hand to just pull me through that lunacy and get me out of there…or at least helped me shop.   I shopped slower than anyone has ever shopped in the history of time.  There was no room to focus with the cotton in my head.  Gaggles of giggling girls and boasting boys…many of them well on their way to a brilliant hangover…tortured me as I tried to think think think about what I was looking for.  This one group took so long on an aisle and was so obnoxious and taking up so much air, I had to leave and come back.  I did, 10 minutes later.  They were still there.  I got out alive and, I think, with what I needed.  But, so much time had passed now it was nearly dark.  A moment of gentle reprieve and esteem caught me peering up at the sky which was now my favorite shade of blue waiting to give birth to full night.  I looked up and breathed ocean air and persistent woe was boxed up and sat on by triumphant gratitude.  Unfortunately for me, gratitude is not on her game and was pinned and counted out in the first round.  I drove home knowing that the sky would be luminous and bright and vibrant with exploding wonder very soon.  I had fallen into a black hole back there, lost time.  I skipped my exit deliberately and drove over the Coronado Bridge.  How can anything be so full of wonder and intrigue and splendor?  The view, the tiny lights.  I was flying over the ocean in my car.  I drove around the island a bit and turned around to head home.  On the way home, off to my right, past the navy base…boom!  Bright colors splayed out over the sky.  It was a bit of a detriment to my driving, but I caught it anyway.  I had a minute of childhood, of child’s wonder and glee, before the clouds were back.  I was sad because today my Dad (Jay) said to me that I was a disappointment to him…how could I be anything but?...said he.  I know how disappointed he must be because I damaged my brain beyond repair and cannot be the girl I once was.  All the other wonderful things I’ve done, or the loving person I’ve become, do not matter because I am struggling right now…and have been struggling for a long time.  I guess the fact that I never gave up and I kept at it don’t matter.  I realize he is wrong to say this to me, wrong in his opinion.  I know the truth.  But, my heart wants nothing of this conversation.  My heart holds the words close to itself and breathes them in.  I am sad because I miss having real flesh and blood people in my life, that live in the same city, and I haven’t made that happen here yet.  I haven’t lived here long at all, but the old me would have hooked that up right away.  I’m sad because the people I want most to be with today, this weekend, are all far away and it’s hard to remember that they love and care about you when you are feeling lost and separate.  I realize now that there won’t be actual fireworks on the 4th, so the tentative plans I had with one flesh and blood person to go watch them is moot.    I’m sad because the old me would know how to fix all this and would just do it…she would make sure she had all bases covered.  I’m running bases naked these days.  I know it will get better, it has gotten better already.  I just ache at the leisurely way my progress ambles along in spite of my heartfelt pleas to bring my plans to fruition.  I am weary. The clouds have rolled in, and I just have to settle in for now until they move out.  I believe that even feeling sad can bring new enlightenment or motivation later.  I’ve tried the normal ways to bring myself out of it, but nothing so far this time is helping.  Maybe this is part of the universe’s path for me.  I would like to just fall apart a little.  Let that be okay.  Find the new undiscovered path amongst the thorn bushes and quicksand.  Billy offered a hug in email the other day.  Whatever our history, he’s my friend.  One of my best friends.  I wish wish wish to be in his arms right now and let it all melt away as he told me in true cargo style why it’s going to be okay.  I always believe him.    For now, it’s me.  Strong, yet sad.  Determined and hopeful.  This song “Solder,” below, has been on heavy rotation for the last couple of years as I needed that great, angry, no-way-do-I-give-up-now feeling.  I’m a soldier in my own battle with my own body.     I’m a soldier These shoulders hold up so much They won’t budge, I’ll never fall or fold up I’m a soldier Even if my collar bones crush or crumble I will never slip or stumble 		- Eminem

       Just some words I wanted to share.&nbsp; This is from "A Cherokee Feast of Days" Vol. III, for June 27.&nbsp; It fits some things going on in my life right now, and I wanted to share.    "We can stand where we are or stand on tip-toe and look over the edge.&nbsp; What is the edge?&nbsp; It is that place where fear lurks and no one dares get too close.&nbsp; Many dreams have taken us up to the edge.&nbsp; With quaking knees, we have looked over the immense distance between what is and what could be.&nbsp; Most people turn away from the edge -- it's just too scary.&nbsp; But we don't have to turn away.&nbsp; We can go to the edge and leap, if we can believe in something greater than can be explained.&nbsp; The most important thing is to let go of fear and take hold of the life whose Light never goes out."    Sometimes what we think of as pain is just part of the leap.&nbsp; Sometimes we walk away from the edge thinking we had already lept, when the time to soar...the true lesson...still awaits.  &nbsp;

       soft salty lick followed by hot harsh caress warms up my chest with a punch leaves all in its wake changed not clear how or if it’s for the better just altered now lime relieves the sting but is less bitter than the taste in my mouth

       Just a note to let you know I haven't fallen off of the planet.&nbsp;&nbsp;Life is changing and shifting and brilliant right now.&nbsp; The beauty of the darkness is the time you get to live in the light.&nbsp; I'm not sure exactly what changed...I'm back at work, I feel better, Emma has had more free time and I get to see her more, my friend Erik and I had a&nbsp;great time&nbsp;while he was here (and we are planning to go skydiving when he comes back in a few months! yay!).....these things have made me feel like I'm living my life again.&nbsp; Like instead of dreaming in my head of what rebuilding will look like, I'm actually rebuilding and making some progress in areas I really wanted to see change.&nbsp; Some of it is perspective, focusing on the good things.&nbsp; I’m still not feeling great and I'm definitely still overwhelmed with all that's on my plate...especially lately because my lease is up and have to move middle of next month....but it just seems like a normal situation where there is good  and  bad, not just swimming in the bad.&nbsp; I feel like there is no time for things and that I'm behind all the time, but I also feel more confident that I can get it done.&nbsp; For the first time in years I feel like I have support to get it done if I feel like I can't go it alone.&nbsp; People who actually live in the same city or who can be in the same city if I need them.&nbsp; My perspective is bright and positive and shiny.&nbsp; I am usually happy in a general sort of way, but right now, I'm really happy.     There is another cause of this bright happy shiny feeling.&nbsp; A new boy.&nbsp; I just told Billy about him, so please don't think I'm being cruel.&nbsp; He wants me to be happy, I want him to happy...maybe with the movie star girl in his last post.&nbsp; Being a hazel eyed girl myself, I know the appeal. ;) &nbsp;We care deeply for each other and wanting the other's happiness is a genuine thing.&nbsp; The new boy, who I nicknamed Drifter, is really named Andy.&nbsp; I should call him Andrew because he's too grown up and yummie and really sexy to have a name that sounds so young.&nbsp; He lives in Florida (my special gift is long distance relationships...been doing that for years), but he'll be out here on Wednesday.&nbsp; I won't have much time to write until he goes home, so hence this note.&nbsp; He's brilliant and lovely, and such a wonderful friend to me.&nbsp; A really good man, too, just really good.&nbsp; We are both Buddhists, that's how we met, and we seem to see life through the same lens.&nbsp; He's much younger than me, which he thinks is really hot (I'm most definitely okay with that, myself).&nbsp; There doesn't seem to be any gaps there, we communicate on the same level.&nbsp; He's expressive and communicative and creative and random.&nbsp; You know I don't go for main stream boys ::: yawn ::: and he's all the good boy I need to be good to me, and the right amount of an edge, of random loveliness, to keep me excited and interested.&nbsp; We are letting things develop as they do, not trying to push things, but it's fair to say we are both definitely smitten.&nbsp; I resisted him so much because of my feelings for Billy and what that relationship meant, and&nbsp;Andy just patiently waited for me to be able to see what he saw and open up to him.&nbsp; We don't know what it means, but I believe (as always) it's happening for&nbsp;a reason for both of us and I am just going to enjoy it...enjoy him.&nbsp; Yes, enjoy him indeed.&nbsp;:)    The girls in my office say I'm lighter and happier these days.&nbsp; They were sad to hear about me and Billy, but glad to know that we are still friends.&nbsp; (And will always be good, good friends, yeah, LT?)&nbsp; They want to meet Andy when he gets here.&nbsp; The only constant in the world is change, so I'm going to swim in this light happy place as long as I can.&nbsp; Lessons come in light, too, you know.&nbsp; Hope you all are well, and forgive my absence if I can't write until Andy goes home on the 29th.&nbsp; Kisses my lovelies!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; urlLink   &nbsp;       urlLink

       everything about who I thought you were who I let you become to me tangled up in an ache that forbids me to swim in memories of you or that which would bring them on  anger feasts there instead you betrayed me brilliantly not by your change of heart but by your reckless disregard of all things me in stunning fashion you lived in worlds of opposite of contradiction I was blind to the reality that what you professed as truth as real and solid was in fact deception  pledges of sincerity and promises of truth along with the conversations needed to mend and nurture represented the true beacon of deep meaning and self awareness they were antithesis of your path no communion met words remain unspoken  believing your enlightenment your “this is it” moment is genuinely the path of your growth when the cost was taken out on the back of the one you credit with freedom is sheer foolishness  you missed the point you tainted the gift illumination, truly, is inevitable a new lesson within the old the path, the gift, the knowledge are only life sustaining if in the moment it blesses you it finds you worthy
