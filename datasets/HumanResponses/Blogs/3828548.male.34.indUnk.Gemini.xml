      Dear Someone,  I have not imagined myself to be in this kind of a situation. Little things, little problems piled up so high, it created a huge mountain of suffering and pain. I tried to somehow move that mountain bit by bit into the ocean of resolve to wash away my tears so I can see once more the glory of a new dawn in my life.  There will be no use in telling me now that this is all my fault. I already know that fact. That's just putting salt in my already sore wound. I know that if I had only listened to life's lectures and crushed my deliberate ignorance of each lessons taught, I wouldn't be in this mess. It's too late for me. Even my pity pot doesn't help now in relieving my grief. My dreams have become obscure. My waking life is now a nightmare.  There is only one chance I have now.....YOU......with your sympathetic and most generous help. I know I could never ever repay you. But I will forever be grateful for the second chance you would give me to live my life normally again.  Your compassionate support will be my rope to help me climb up from this deep dark hole of shame and anguish.I am asking for your generous assistance to help me raise US$10,000.00 to help me settle my debts.  I am a Filipino working here in Saudi Arabia as a Department Secretary. My small salary is not even enough to pay for my debts and to give some support to my parents in the Philippines.  I am very desperate for your most compassionate help. It will be my second chance in a debt-free life. I'm begging for your mercy. When this agony is through, I know I can fully support my family and continue with my education for a better life.  These changes in my life will only be possible with your most generous help.
