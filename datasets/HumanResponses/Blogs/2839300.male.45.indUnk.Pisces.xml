      Here is a list of cites for law review articles on the topic of prison labor.  I am checking on which ones are available on the internet for full text viewing.  I will update this post with live links as I find them.

      Few sites are devoted to prison labor, but a number of sites address the issue along with other issues.   urlLink American Gulag , News and resources on Prisoners, Prisons, and Prison Abolition.  Contains a lot of information on prison issues, but the word "anarchist" is used quite frequently, perhaps too much so.   urlLink Missouri Prisoners Labor Union .  Frequently updated site covering more than just prison labor issues.   urlLink Prison Activist Resource Center - Prison Labor .  Lengthy list of links to the DOC industry sites of the several states and the feds.  Very useful.   urlLink Prison Legal News .  Monthly newsletter.  I've read a few issues.  Well done and worth subscribing to, even if only to support the cause.   urlLink The Wire , Prison-Related News.  Presented from the San Francisco State University servers.  I suspect it is student-run - and I mean singular.  Lots of links to articles and has been publishing for a couple of years.   urlLink The Other Side of the Wall .  This site is no longer maintained, but anticipating that, the owners archived their nine years of work very well.  Still a good resource.   urlLink Torture in Texas Prisons .  Rather direct name, and (at times) equally direct content.  Use the bar on the left to find prison labor information.   urlLink ACLU - Prisoner Rights .  What set of links would be complete without the ACLU?  On the right side is an entry for "Prison Industrial Complex."  The content isn't always on-point.

      Most of the articles, unfortunately, are dated.  But I will link them as I find them ...   UPDATE:  Forgot to add this article in original post:    urlLink The Prisoners of War , By Ian Urbina, AlterNet, October 27, 2003.  Article on Unicor/FPI and the broader prisoner labor issue.  Reads like an NPR piece - somewhat factual but just can't help taking jabs at republicans.  Let's be honest here - this is a non-political site - but the legislation that effectively repealed the 1935 Act and thereby brought back prison labor was the Justice System Improvement Act of 1979 (Public Law 96-157).  The Act was sponsored by Ted Kennedy, the House was controlled 276 to 157 by the democrats, the Senate 58-41-1 by the democrats, and Jimmy Carter was POTUS.  What did W or the pubs have to do with that?  Do you find it equally irritating when people can't keep politics to themselves?   urlLink 'Made in USA' ... but By Convicts , Christian Science Monitor.  January 14, 1998.  Discusses Broward Optical, run out of Broward (FL) Correctional Institute, and the general prison labor situation.   urlLink Prison Labor: Workin' For The Man , by Reese Erlich, originally published in Covert Action Quarterly #54 - Fall 1995.  One of the better articles, includes footnotes and informative (if dated) use of data.   urlLink Prison Labor: Profits, Slavery and the State , by "MC12," Maoist Internationalist Movement.  Undated.  The article has a decided bias against the process of using prisoners are laborers, and loosely uses the term "forced labor" as if the system in the United States were akin to the USSR's gulags or Communist China's laogai.   urlLink Doing time, 9 to 5 , by Steven Elbow, Copyright 1995 Isthmus, Madison, WI.  Plenty of examples, focused on local Wisconsin issues.  Reads like a well-research op-ed piece.   urlLink Prison labor on the rise in US , by Alan Whyte and Jamie Baker, May 8, 2000.  Published by the World Socialist Web Site, the article focuses on the relationship of prison labor, traditional labor unions, and legislation.   urlLink Prison Labor: Some Facts and Issues , by Karen Miller, copyright 2000.  A lot of data, but presented in a narrative, and also inaccurate in two instances that caught my eye in a quick review.  She cites the Hawes-Cooper Act as occurring in 1935 (it was 1929), and the Ashurst-Sumners Act as occurring in 1940 (it was 1935).

      This is a new blog for me.  I practiced criminal law for over ten years, and now teach it at the college level.  I have taught in the prisons and have developed and maintained friendships with inmates.  I first became interested in this topic as I taught the chronology of the prison workhouses in England, circa 1544, then into the United States in the 1800s, and culminating in its federal legislative death in 1935.  That was an interesting lesson in history and, since my undergrad was in Economics, I was not shocked at all to see the manipulation of the labor market end disastrously.  Then in 1979, with the Justice System Improvement Act, the 1935 legislation was rendered ineffective.  We are now fully into the workhouse environment of centuries ago.  So I have begun my research, and it is very much in its infant stages.  It is my intent, however, to make this important issue the subject of my dissertation.  I intend for this web site to track my research and present it for comment to you as I progress.  I have been initially disappointed in my research, which is to relate that the level of scholarly research into the issue seems to be thin at best.  Some prisons are paying 19 cents an hour to inmates, working them without breaks, subjecting them to constant verbal abuse, and in general treating them as slaves who should be thankful for the opportunity to work.  How can this be without serious study?  Articles appear here and there, but nothing in depth.  A textbook I recently read that devoted six pages to the topic cited articles and prison yearbooks as its source.  That is not a condemnation of the author, but a commentary on the resources available to him.  The websites I have found have been authored by (understandably) angry prisoners or family, but generally lack any real pedagogical value.  I do not intend to take sides in this research.  I wish to gather all relevant information and present it for your consideration.  If you have any articles, websites, or other information that you wish to inform me of or, as appropriate, use this blog to inform others, please e me at PrisonLabor@hotmail.com.

       Marriage   How many of you are on the same page as me?  I woke up early this morning – maybe 5AM.  I gently rolled over, looked at the back of my wife’s head, watched for a moment as the movement of the covers told me she was breathing deeply.  Then I thought, “Damn, still alive.”  Marriage just is not an as-advertised commodity.  How many people reading this have been married over 15 years?  And under 10?  Now, if possible, get at least one person of each group in the same room.  Those that have been married the longer time, look at those married under ten and watch their expression when you say this: “My friend has a nephew; he’s going to get married next week.”  They thought that was a good thing, didn’t they?  Just pathetic, isn’t it?   The closer to being married ten years you are the more disillusioned you become.  At precisely ten years, you finally figure out that something is systemically wrong.  This thing – whatever it is – doesn’t work like you thought it would.    Then from 10 to 15 years you think of ways to fix it.  You change.  You require her to change.  At the end of the day, nothing’s changed and the dog growls more often and pisses on your shoes.  When 15 years finally rolls around, you got it figured out.  And it’s depressing.  Marriage sucks – and the only thing worse than being married is being single.  And just when you thought it couldn’t get worse, immediately after you figure it all out, come to peace with this new reality, she pipes off with some statement about wanting to change, wanting you to change.  You look at her and her eyes tell you everything – she’s at a guy’s ten-year mark.  You’ve got five years of Hell to live through until she finally accepts marriage for what it is – an unworkable, dangerous situation.  Dangerous?  Where did that come from?  Try this - what other job has a 50% mortality rate?  Even storming the beaches of Normandy on June 6, 1945, gave you a better chance of survival.  A higher percentage of people walked away from Soviet gulags than walk away from marriage.    Perhaps “dangerous” isn’t a strong enough word.

       Bee stings,  et al.    I just got stung by a bee.  Boy, that pisses me off.  And everyone knows exactly how to interpret that last sentence.  But what does it mean, literally?  A conceptual understand has to follow an initial literal one.  To be pissed off is to be angry.  I would think I would be more angry if I were to be pissed on.  It would require a slightly different sentence structure: Boy, that’s like getting pissed on.  Telling someone to piss off is to tell them to go away, quickly.  I don’t comprehend the relationship to urine in or out of the bladder.  Anyway, I am putting ice packs on my ankle where I got stung.  I don’t see a stinger, but it hurts nonetheless.  How did nonetheless become one word?  Did people say it really fast?  I can understand using hyphens to join the words, but to make them into a new word seems odd.  It doesn’t make me angry, it doesn’t pissmeoff or pissonme or anything, I’m just curious.

       Grocery Shopping   I went grocery shopping today.  Took four hours.  I do the shopping, not her.  Her and the kids keep a running list.  No one goes to the store but me.  Shopping is much too serious an issue to be left to women or children.  I entered the check-out line at $508.25; exited at $341.22.  It was an exceptional day.  Pushed my year-to-date savings to $655.40.  On average, I’m good for at least a grand a year between in-store specials and coupons.  I remember a trip last fall.  For some reason, a lot of husbands were there – coupon organizers in hand.  No kids.  Grocery list at the ready.  Two were talking and comparing quality and price on something in the soup and canned meat aisle.  They had it nailed.    I found some good specials today.  9 Lives was discontinuing Chicken & Fish Dinner.  17 cents.  And I had a $1 off coupon for 12 cans.  Decent cat food is a good buy at 25 cents; is usually priced at 33 cents; I paid 9 cents.  Countrytime Lemonade – the size that makes 2 gallons – buy-one-get-one-free.  It was on the ground level, six inches above my feet.  At eye level was the size that make 4 gallons – that was priced at about 67 cents a gallon; I got it for 49 cents a gallon.    $167.03 total savings.  About 5 hours work, including coupon clippings and organizing.  Effective hourly wage $33.41; annual - $69,500.  Not bad for a part-time job.  Tuna fish in oil.  Does anyone buy that?  And why?  Always seemed gross to me.  Another thing that always amazed me is people (like my wife and daughter) that make tuna fish for a sandwich, and then put mayonnaise on the bread.  Why not just put enough in the tuna to begin with?  Why are navel oranges 50 cents each?  It feels like a lot to me, and there seems to be so many on a tree.  Apples are not as much, nor are peaches.  I always feel badly for mothers with young children.  Usually out of control kids.  Sometimes, however, I feel badly for the children – mothers that scream.  I had both today, but then also the most dreaded of all species: the completely checked-out husband-en-tow.  Two of them.  They wander within a leash’s distance of their spouse.  Both guys were in their late 60s.  One walked in between me and the aisle – I was looking at Mexican beans.  He just stopped, as if he were shifted into neutral.  He wasn’t looking at anything, just standing there.  After a moment he moved on.  We crossed paths several more times.  Poor guy was just shuffling along.  There is always an older woman with a middle-aged daughter.  And the middle-aged daughter always talks too loudly and in a tone like the listener is a child.  And the mother is always mumbling.  Well, more later.
