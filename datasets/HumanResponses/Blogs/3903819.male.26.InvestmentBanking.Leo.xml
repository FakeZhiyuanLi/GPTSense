      I checked out their website today to&nbsp;get some ideas. Somehow I think the site is really really confusing. You have to dig and explore to go&nbsp;places. The main page just showed too many options. Creative, but not intuitive.  Anyway, I thought that the more interesting parts of&nbsp;the website&nbsp;are these: •  urlLink Lovemarks  •  urlLink Kevin Roberts  •  urlLink Bob Isherwood

      I&nbsp;love reading about the things that make other people great. Altpick Magazine&nbsp;has a  urlLink piece about David Droga , Worldwide Creative Director at  urlLink Publicis .   What I learned from that story:    1: Most of what advertising is about is emotion   "Business is all about logic and being rational, but most of what advertising is about is emotion. That's what the strongest brands are--attitudes and feelings."    2: Grab a scene, act out scripts, and bring things to life   Apart from creative judgment, the most important skills a creative director can possess are theatrics and articulation.    3:&nbsp;What's our common thread?   The creative department at OMON (have no idea what that acronym stands for) was&nbsp;made up of Americans, English, Indians, Australians, Chinese, Singaporeans, and Taiwanese. Working in a team where&nbsp;everyone has different cultural backgrounds and different experiences is okay, maybe even great, if there was a&nbsp;common thread-- in OMON's case, it was creativity.    4: You can't be narrow   David enjoyed&nbsp;not only&nbsp;the creative side of his work,&nbsp;but also&nbsp;the  building a culture and momentum aspect --the business side.    5: Excel creatively   Imagine.   6: More similarities than differences   People are all ruled by the same emotions--love, fear, greed, envy, wanting to improve ourselves, and protect our families. If you try to advertise somewhere in the middle, you can successfully adapt to different cultural and religious climates.    7: Shifting into high-inventive gear   Be a leader, not a boss.    8: Standard of work   Sub-consciously or not, clients want a point of view and for their brands to have&nbsp;a point of view. But&nbsp;these clients&nbsp;won't succeed&nbsp;if they doesn't live by their chosen point of view. Yet many companies do this.    9: Drive to be a standout   Really great work, has to do more than just be great. It has to be something that changes the way you look at the industry.

      Many companies are unaware of the fact that creating organization-wide conversations is a crucial leadership task--but often  a  very  difficult one.  Crucial because critical problems and opportunities can be analyzed and timely addressed. Difficult because many managers still believe that company-wide surveys and interviews, once done, should automatically lead people to think that the company is now "open". Well, that's logical thinking. But as  urlLink Seth Godin  once said:   "Logic is not enough. If all it took was logic, no one would smoke cigarettes. And every smart proposal would be adopted."    To create conversations:  (a) management must establish a 2-way communication channel, and respond to concerns as well as ideas--to build trust; (b) management must try to understand the battlefield, so that real understanding (NOT assumptions) drives organizational changes; (c) management must celebrate small and big successes, to sustain the momentum.. like team members giving high-fives to the scorer and the teammate who created the scoring chance; (d) and management must remember that because conversations are informal, factfinding methods like surveys, focus groups, and interviews are not  urlLink quintessential tools  of building "open" cultures.

       urlLink This Jeff Wuorio piece  is very useful. While many customer service reps know that it's important to positively deal with angry customers,&nbsp;there aren't too many advice that can be used right away.. e.g. when you are "in-the-moment"&nbsp;with an angry customer.  &nbsp;  Jeff offers 7 response lines CSRs can use:  &nbsp;  1.  "Let's go over what's happened."  -- indirectly forces the customer to think, not just vent.  &nbsp;  2.  "Let's get together to talk about this."  -- if the customer is venting over the phone, this line helps by giving some cooling down&nbsp;time to the customer. Some customers are better at showing their anger over the phone and emails, than in face-to-face meetings.  &nbsp;  3.  "Let's have someone else hear what's happened."  -- calling in a third party could serve as a cue to both the CSR and the customer to approach the situation as objectively as possible.   4.  "Let's see what we can do to resolve this."  -- shows that the CSR is moving past the accusation and signals intent to reach a solution that prevents the incident or mistake from recurring.  &nbsp;  5.  "Let's hear how you think we should solve this."  -- gets the customer to appreciate the CSRs perspective.  &nbsp;  6.  "Let's talk about ways this won't happen again."  -- used to get feedback directly from the customer. And to demonstrate commitment to customer care.  &nbsp;  7.  "Let's use 'let's' as much as we can."  -- signals to the customer that reaching a common understanding is considered an important result.

      As an Organizational Development Executive, I develop in-house courses, among other things. And I have always wondered how I can do a better job structuring the content of my  Financial Statements course  i.e. what comes first, second, etc. I believe a good presentation draws people into the course, and  urlLink this book  does just that:-    1: The Five Rules For Successful Stock Investing   Our five rules of profitable stock investing.    2: Seven Mistakes to Avoid   Costly errors committed by even the best investors.    3: Economic Moats   An economic advantage you can't afford to overlook.    4: The Language of Investing   The key to unlocking a kingdom of critical information.    5: Financial Statements Explained   What information to find where and why it's important.    6: Analyzing a Company: The Basics   Looking at growth, profitability, and financial health.    7: Analyzing a Company: Management   Delving into compensation, character, and running the business.    8: Avoiding Financial Fakery   Ignore these 13 warning signs at your own peril.    9: Valuation: The Basics   What price multiples and yields tell about a company's value.    10: Valuation: Intrinsic Value   Learning from cash flow, present value, and discount rates.    11: Putting It All Together   Applying the principles to real-world examples.    12: The 10-Minute Test   How to tell quickly if a company is worth in-depth investigation.   Plus—individual chapters on all these industries!  Chapters explain specific factors that drive industries  • Health Care  • Consumer Services  • Business Services  • Banks  • Asset Management and Insurance  • Hardware  • Media  • Telecom  • Consumer Goods  • Industrial Materials  • Energy  • Utilities   I like the way the&nbsp;content is structured.  &nbsp;  [And at the moment, it sells at a 60 percent discount for&nbsp; urlLink $9.98 at you-know-where .]

      This is a blog..   ..where I keep most of my ideas, whether in raw or refined form, and to record my experiences--those that are worth noting. So, this is part idea-log, part diary.   About ideas, most of them come from other websites I have accidentally come across. But of course, I don't aimlessly link to other sites. The ones that I feature here are those which I have an opinion about. You can read my views and comment on them by sending me an email. I will try to respond to every one of 'em.  Thank you for visiting, and enjoy!

      I wonder how many new world records we will get this year, from Athens 2004.

I have found 3 sources: •  urlLink International Olympic Committee's website  •  urlLink Ato Boldon's video collection (no sound)  •  urlLink Ato Boldon's video collection (alternate angle; no sound)   If you know of better sources, please share them with me, :)

      "If money is your only hope for independence, you will never have it. The only real security that a man can have in this world is a reserve of knowledge, experience and ability. Without these qualities, money is practically useless. The security even of money depends on knowledge, experience and ability. If productive ideas are replaced by destructive ideas, economic life suffers." -- Henry Ford  [First seen at  urlLink Jonathan Ruff's website .]

      Eversince I have been entrusted to write a concept paper on e-learning for my organization, I have been looking all over for authoritative writing on the subjects of e-learning, knowledge management, corporate training and learning. Of course, I have come across a great number of material. But none have come close to providing me with a good background than the  urlLink Grassroots KM through blogging  piece found at  urlLink elearningpost , written in May 2001. Some links in the article are already dead but it still stands as one of the best, in my view.  To corporations that are still having trouble with creating companywide conversation, I'd like to quote  urlLink Maish Nichani :  Haven't they heard of weblogs?

      Celine Dion's released a new song called "You and I".  The title is captivating, if you can relate it to team situations. I picture a team leader talking about going forward together and as one. Solving and tackling problems one by one. Helping other team members cope with the pace. Succeeding creatively with no one left behind. All the time, making his point by saying  "It will take you and I".   Remember how Maximus, in  urlLink the Russel Crowe movie Gladiator , greeted his comrades by saying "strength and honor" before going into battle? Now, I imagine similar effect is achieved by a store manager saying "you and I" to each of her or his teammates before opening for business every day, reminding that they need to be a  unit of one  when executing the service strategy to succeed.  Simple, but powerful.

      Great companies do this well: Continuously find ways to positively change, and make customers see these changes over time.  I know  urlLink Blogger  is improving. Realized they just added new features to better help me manage my blogs.   urlLink Amazon.com  did the same thing when it first got started. In 1998, you couldn't search books by author name listed alphabetically, by price, by customer reviews, etc. But at  urlLink CNET  you could. I emailed them. They responded saying they'll look into it. Today, they have all that, and more.  Companies need to do one simple thing. Plan the changes that will positively alter the customer experience. Then,  launch these changes one by one,  in planned sequence. You want customers to see these changes as they appear so that they'll talk about it. That's called viral marketing? I don't know, but it's definitely something.

      Just got back my broadband connection. It was suspended because I was slow on the bills.  One observation though, I found out that it was suspended after calling their toll-free customer service number. So the guy tells me, pay and we will reconnect you. Fair enough. So I paid online at the office. It takes 2 working days for online payments to typically clear. After 4 days, I tried connecting and turns out my account was still suspended. Called them up and they restored my connection.  Question: Why did I have to take the extra step to call?   I know some companies who lift account restrictions as soon as payment's received. What can the provider possibly gain by interacting with me for like 2 minutes? I am not complaining as I was at fault. But curious as to the way they operate. The interaction was hardly value-adding. As far as I'm concerned, the only time the provider interacts with me is when I have a situation like this. And it ain't gonna happen all-the-time. Are they seeing this?  I think they should remove the "step" from the process, or find ways to add-value when interacting with the customer. There are millions of ways to do that.

      I'm giving this  urlLink 3 stars out of 5 .  The robots in this movie are very life-like, and not cartoonish or animated.  Storyline was pretty cool. Having Will Smith means you'll get a good laugh at some of the scenes. The robot-human relationship was carefully built and you can almost feel it.   Definitely worth seeing, if you haven't.  3 stars for me means "worth seeing at least once".  What gives? Near a certain point in the end, it becomes predictable; and Will Smith was the only "good guy" until late in the movie.  This was my review. Read the  urlLink plot here .
