       this is something which i really like !!! i mean i dont like it that much ... some might have seen me using this gif to some peaople in some places :P   this is a gif which i find really interesting ... some peaople like karam ( aka bandupari ) still has doubts about my sexuality ... LoL ... i dont blame him ... having fun on this wired world is the best way to get away from everything in real life ..so everything which happens on the net ... lets just say i just wanna keep it on the internet ... cause i dont think that real life and this connected world really match ...   heres something for everyone out there ! BE BRAVE AND BE PROUD OF YOURSELF !! but not like george bush ... :P vakaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaoooooooo !!

" dhen enme thireehennu ! dhen mifaharu dhakkaalaa " so laaaaaaame !!  but all i know is when they are supposed to pay why cant they pay that "ekkala" 30 odd rufiyaa ? why cant they ? amillayah dhakkanveema onnanee bodu vefa ... its sad really.. well not sad but a bit hard to beleive ...   this is a huge problem in maldives nowadays ... fear of taking responsibility for money ... well actually not that but soemthing like that ... u will get the idea .. if u dont .. better get help ... dont know where to go ? try  urlLink www.google.com  and search for help :)

                 this is something which i have encountered severel days ... not  just several days ... infact a whole lots of times .. boss office ga ulhey iru office heevaaanee hama saharaaa ehhen .. its so peaceful ... but as soon as boss goes out ... people start moving around and stuff... voices starts getting higher and breathing starts to get higher .. no .. no .. abt the breathing part ... i just made that up . :) :P  and then out of the blue ....  "kyaa huvaaaaa theyraa vaadhaa !!! voa gasam theyree vaadhaa ... "  i turn around to check .. the girls in the next section starts jammin' to the oldest most boring hindi crap i ever heard ... its like  .... no no no i really dont know how to describe that ... umm .. strange noises ? hmm ...   its not like i hate hindi music or anything .. the new  stuff's they have some catchy songs .. but ...those old boring music or whatever they call it ... are they legitimate ? they should be banned as noise pollution ... it can make a man cry . . . really it can ...   so the question is . why ? why do they like to hear boring crap... its not like office is the most fun place inthe world to make it a bit boring ... frankly saying its one of the most boring places i have ever been ... but sad to say ... i have to go there again tomorrow ...  otherwise PAY CUT !!DAMN !! one of the things i hate most . but ... office is not always the baddest place to be ... got some good looking chicks :> ( that;s girls for everyone who didn't understand ) and beleive me ... in our office there are awesome girls ;) but .... still they dont have good sense of humor and THEY dont know whats noise and what is music ... so let's just say one more day of boring music and its gonna make my hama nujehey brain even more hama nujehey ...

                this is something i stil havent figured out yet ...  girls and there reethi vun ... what do they do so much ... which takes so time ... for instance we make a date for lets say 9 ... but unsurprisingly they  come at 9:30 ... talk about getting fashionably late . but they really need to know whats going on in the mind of the guy who is waiting for him .. its like a bag of everything compressed to his mind .frustration and a bit more frustration.. but ... the Girls just come and say " alheyyyy so soryyy " aan enimunee dhen ... everything is settled ... so they think so but in the guys mind those small stupid things stick like glue .. cause they know someday when they might need to those small stupid things against the girls  and one more thing ... the toilet thing.. girls just love toilets or bathrooms .. they spend 1 hour 2 hour ... plz no offence but isnt that a little bit too much ? i know they come up with all sortsa reasons to explain it  but .... in the end we all know its just alibis ... so why exactly cant a girl get ready in time for her to make his date happy ? cause she dont want to go ? dont like to spend more time together ? or is it that it has become a small "Fad" well anyway i know that guys dont like these fads and wait ... does guys know all these products they use ?! any one heard of an eye lotion ? wTf ! its supposed to keep ure eyes white yoa ! pis pis ... boahalaaaku!! then foot lotion akaa ehen ehchakaa ... lotion thakun araa vareh nuvey kanneynge ... and please every girl have the same excuse " dhen theenayah ( refering to his bf ) reethi vaan kuraa kanthah thakey "  wheeeeeeeeee !! so frikking lame ... but looking nice is a good thing .. but lets just say ... i dont like it to take so much time  we dont care if ure wearing a dress or top...i just want u to be there on time with me !  thats all i care abt ... so lets hope girls just take this as a compliment and start getting on time to places ... but anyway emeehun furihamayah reethi veleema haadha chaaley ... TOIN !

              well... ive been getting mixed reactions about me having a 3 years younger girlfriend ... some of my friends are telling that i have done something wise and im thinking about my future as well .. but .. some ppl just does not seem to agree ... they say its something i do to get away from the reality of life .. but first of all when they say that .. who are they to tell whats real or not ? dont they think twice about all the crap they've done in there life ?  i mean ... i dont feel im doing something bad ... i think its the best thing i done since .... hmmm ... well let's just say its the best thing i done ... i mean ... when we start dating a fresh girl .. its easy to mak her think like how i do ... meaning me and her will think alike ... resulting in a better and a more understanding relationship ... try for instance a girl who have been going out wiht lotsa guys .. she comes into a relationship and for the boy im sure it would be difficult to get her to set the mind frame as his .. maybe she wants soemthing else ... maybe the boy just wanna get laid ... who knowS !? but having a fresh girl means ... they are more predictable and its more easier to go on with her ... well most guys just try to find girls who want what they want ... and beleive me its one of the most hardest thing to do ...    your my favourite thing ... julie ... never thikn otherwise ...  Got my fever down, then weighed it up, and know the  Sounds remaining won't strain all the silt from my eyes  Bleach the green from the pastures, feast on the grey  Of the night, straight from the vines refusal to shine   You're my favourite thing - the one that I love  You're the one so I'd die for your love   Blind the deafened moon, stimulate the tombs of angels  I'll open my heart we won't fall apart  Don't fall apart You're my favourite thing  And I never feel like letting go

               ive been having a great life ... i " was " having the best year of my life ... the year 2004 started out GREAT ... on the 1st i met a wonderful girl ... and we fell in love .. it was really going along well ... since my first love decided to show up " hus koh " well it was really surprising ... cause she had been in a serios relationship for the past 2 years after breaking up with me in a huge misunderstanding ... which frankly saying .. i also didnt know wat happened .. but it was all good until she showed up telling she still loves me .well old sparks flew and i dont know whats on my mind also .now i feel that i need to be with my first love . but i cannot forget theres one more girl that i care about . and i really care about her . shes a fine girl and she also really loves me . but .... after my first love showed up ( sorry no names :P ) things havent been the same between me and my GF ... i am a bit uptight abt stuff and have a tendency to get angry a bit faster ... well things are really on a tight string between me and my girlfriend ... its really sad . cause she seems to be always busy with her school stuff .. and shes really having a hard time in her life .. YEa i know i should be there for her at this time and everything but .... i am spending time with my first love ... cause she has " time " to be with me ... i know its pretty lame excuse but... its really wonderful to spend time with my love after a 2 year break ... its like were meant to be or whatever ... and it really fills my heart to be with her .. but some of my friends tell thats shes not good news .. but fuk there opinions .. ive known her for 4 years .. wtf can they know from one of there friends friends friends ! ERr GRR ! so im having a huge decision to make now ... its like my GF cant dedicate her whole self to me at the time being ... cause shes in school and she has huge responsibilities yet and shes got a long way to go yet .... but my first love .. shes all for me ... infact all over for me .. but i really dont like cheating to my Gf ... shes the girl i love "now" ... i mean i have strong anf undeniable feelings for my first love but still ... where was i when i needed her ? when i loved her she also couldnt get out of the relationship she was in ... so why am i suposed to get out of my current relationship ... but shes always telling to be hers ... but what to do ... i really like my julie ( my current GF ) shes one of a kind and one of the sweetest girls i met .. i just dont wanna end up with her due to my past ... hope my present stays present and my PAST stays in the PAST

               about the day it all ends for that person ... is everyone afraid of it ?...   in our society very few of us devote much mental energy to pondering death ... or its implications of life but the knowing of death which will be upon us ... either we use this for another reason to sufer anxiety or we march headlong in to denial.what we "know" we do not really accept. I see death as a completion of a cycle ... ia return to the state in which we existed before we were born ... well everyone might disagree to that ... but its sometimes how i feel ... but other people thinks death as sacred .. but now . we have re arranged the letters in sacred -- and gotten just plain scared ... ppl who are afraid of death are ppl who arent ready for it ... meaning they havent done there duty alive .. everyone gets punished for there sinss ... most of the real question concerning death is why ? but , lets make it "why not?" becoz death is a part of life.becoz all things that take form ultimately dissolve and all things that begin ultimately ends and most of all becoause ....  -  until we reconciled with the truths , we will never be really at peace       let us deprive death of it's strangeness; let us frequent it,let us get used to it; let us have nothing more often in mind than death ... to practice death is to practice freedom ...  -- micheal De Montaigne

                  throughout history , violence has been used to affect political changes. assasination of john f kenndey ; 6 million jews died during the holocaust; In argentina The huge clashes between the right wing death squads and the left wings terror groups after peron's death ; members of doomsday group , Aum Shinry Kyo releasing posonous nerve gas on the Tokyo underground and later the plane crashes on to the WTC ....  throuhgout the 20th century the same mistakes have been made again and again, ideologies the world over have created escalating culture of terror . but always caught in the  cross fire of the " politics of violence " is the innocent ... so why use such terror ... and have innocent lives at risk ... after all the ppl caught in these cease fire might just be u or me ... or the guy sitting next to u ... but .. still this acts of violence never seems to calm ...

            this is something which i came across when listening to one of the chairs songs ... it really caught my senses when these lyrics are put in such a way ...  i hated everyone just like  hating you should be introduced as a new law take the time to learn to hate come join the mass debate take the time ... its uphill your gotta climb   why do musicians use such lyrics ? cause it SELLS !! thats why ..  well .. talking abt hate .. i hate waking up in the morning .. i hate going to office i hated it when soul's fone gave me a wake up alarm at 6 oclock in the morning .. ( and it was the only day i could rest !! ) i hate it cause once i wake up i cant go to sleep easily i hate it cause i cant sleep in anything other than total darkness... i hate it cause i cant listen to my own type of music at office ... i hate pay cuts ...   but I LOVE TOMORROW !!  its PAY DAY BABY !!!  so ciao and night all... tomorrow is a big day ... well not really ... just another day ... sigh ...

       >       its 3 30 AM wen i am starting writing this ... tonight it was all rolling on the bed for me ... i dont know why but tonight just cant sleep .. seems my mind is wandering of to some other problems .. ( yes i do have problems ) here is sit in total darkness ... blinded by the light coming from my monitor ... still cant get my eyes to open fully .. not knowing about what im writing .... i feel as if life is so cruel soemtimes ... there comes a phase wen its so happy ... but everytime that comes i think about the downhill part ... and the happiness just seem to go away each time ... becoz all happines comes with great sacrifices and its damn sure that tragadey follows after happines ... i wonder why tragedy is there in everyones life .. ? but its a question i stil havent answered yet to my self ...  but its really cruel .. because what we really want ... we can never get .. its how its meant to be ... but feeling what you have is not enough ... thats the worst thing any one can do ... be happy :) ciao and night ol' .... damn ... and i still cant get my eyes open !

      well ... im back to this blogging frenzy ... its not as huge as it was a couple of months back ... but anyway   things ... strange weird things happend recently .. and just wanted to clear them out of my mind .. it effected my life ... my only love .. but hopefully now that we have sorted it all out .. we can go on wiht out lives .. i dont knw wether its gonna be the same or not .. anyway ... coming out thru problems makes a good relationship perfect .. and the bond between two indiviuals are made stronger and deeper when they overcome difficult situations ... well atleast thats how i think about it ..  anway .. her bday 29th july .. was one of the worst days of our lives due to mystery problems .. but now its becoming fine ..  and te 1st phase of my birthday gift to her ... SHE absolutely LOVED IT !  i gave her a large sized " bubbles " soft toy .. and she cant take her arms around it .. hehe ... and nor can her lil bro can take his arms around it .. hehe ! those two seems to be fighting around for it ..  so hopefully things will become normal ... case time solves everything .. well maybe not everything . . .
