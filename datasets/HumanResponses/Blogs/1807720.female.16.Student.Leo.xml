      Well the party on Friday was fun and well yesterday we just all went and did whatever had to be done and then in the evening we went out for Chinese at that place Down Town called Ho Won.  Was that ever good, I totally just stuffed myself cause I had only eaten like a little breakfeast earlier that morning.  Today I was planning to go to church but my mom is like kind of against it I guess because like she kept persuing me not to go.  Because well there was this water main break and it flooded my sisters house so now I have to help them move their stuff from their house to our garage or else the storage fees will be very expensive!  And well right now they can't even live in their house because it is like ruined all down stairs and the walls are starting to cave in.  So well they bought a 5th Wheel to live in during everything and then in the Winter they will probably live with Jim, which is Ben's mother's boyfriend.  Kind of confusing but honestly I am not to crazy about Jim and all.  And well Ben's dad passed away from Cancer on Friday night and yeah even since I applied for some jobs I've been having second thoughts - which is like NOT a good thing at all.  I guess I just still realize how important everything else really is to me, and I guess it kind of lets me know where my priorities are at the moment.  But well I am just concned about the time I will have available because most people don't take as long as I do to like finish work or study and things like that.  And well during the summer I sort of began to maybe question that like maybe there is something wrong with me.  I do get good marks and all but I don't think many people realize the countless hours I spend trying to figure something out or all the times I have cried because I tried and tried to figure out math and it just doesn't make sense.  Sometimes I think I might have some kind of  disability like associated with learning but when even I mention that people just tell me that I am crazy but I am not sure what to think I mean maybe I am crazy but I wish I knew why I cry like a million times per week and everything NEVER and mean never comes easily.  I have to work for all things and let me tell ya I work my ass off and yeah only I know truly what I go through.  But I don't think I am crazy, I really think that maybe I could possibly be right, but I suppose there is no way to know for sure and everyone has this ideal in their head that I am some kinda really smart girl.  And yeah so maybe I am smart in their eyes but if only they knew a little more and felt all the feelings and went through all the experiences I've been through.  Especially when I consider how hard driving was for me to learn and I even did and extra class of drivers ED and like I still got a 70% and I was suppose to have 75% to pass.  So well I am putting of going for my license until about next year because I don't need the stress of driving in my life too.  But well yeah I don't know what to think when it comes down to about everything.  When I was a kid I never could count money or tell time very well, and I remember always being in some kind of room working with this lady who helped my learn how to count by tens.  And well it's not like math had even been easy, all my life it has been hard and like I read that sometimes disabilities are life long.  Sometimes I think that maybe someone knows something I don't, I mean maybe I do have some sort of problem but no one wants to tell me because maybe the way I would feel like I dunno maybe my parents or something, if anyone were to know anything it would probably be them.  But then again I might just be thinking way too much.  But I mean when I think about all the difficulties with everything it makes sense that it could be possible for me to have some kind of disability involving learning well at least in my mind it makes sense but people usually just think the opposite.  I never thought school or driving or anything was suppose to be soooo hard but I dunno maybe it's not just me and mayeb their are others who feel the same way.  I guess I will never really know for sure though and I just have to go along and do my very best because that is all I can really do.

      I have been so busy!!!  Going to a party tonight from 7:00 - 12:00 PM and my dad is flying in from Vancouver tonight.  Today I took the C-Train to Chinook and applied at Old Navy then I took the bus down to Wendy's and applied there cause Chels, Derek, Eric, and Lawrence all work there so I think that would be kind of cool.  On Wednesday night I went to go see Uptown Girls and we got popcorn and later on some ice cream...YUM!  Last night we went to go eat out  *AGIAN*  and I bet you guessed it...Zellers.  Of course there isn't really many options because all my Grandma likes is Zellers and Dairy Queen.  Anyway Jenny Gear finally got voted  *OFF*  Canadian Idol!!  It's about time!!  And MY idol Billy Klippert is still in there!!!  I sure hope he is the idol, although I still love Clay Aiken from American, he will always be damn sexy and irresistable.  LOL.  And well the last Big Brother it was like really cool how Jun got to leave the house to go to the VMA's, like how cool.  I'm kind of disapointed that Jack got voted off though cause I really did like him.  And well I  *CAN'T WAIT*  for the finale of For Love of Money 2 on Monday.  I am like so into that show now and I used to think it was so dumb.  Canadian Idol was also really funny last night, my mother and I were killing ourselves laughing at these people who really could not sing.  It was the best of the worst show and man those are like sooo my total favourites.  Anyways school is coming soon and probably I will have a job soon and well now I have to think about how I am gonna handle everything!

      This morning I baked some cookies to freeze for when my dad comes and also some for my sister and her future husband.  Then in the afternoon all I did was watch TV and just relax.  Yesterday Canadian Idol was also sooooooo awesome I mean Billy Klippert was awesome.  When my Dad was leaving from Calgary and going back to Vancouver we saw him at the airport.  He shook my Mother's hand and he hugged me.  Oh how lucky I really am!  Meanwhile I really think that it is Jenny Gear's time to go, in fact I never thought she should have even made it to Canadian Idol.  Toya was much better than Jenny, I mean Jenny can't sing - all she does is move her mouth and it is painful for me to listen to her.  My mom says she looks like one of those Hudarite people..LOL!  When I actually think about that it is so true!  I think that Canada judges way to much on appearance instead of like  REAL  talent!  And well my mom is at the Foothills hospital right now because Ben's dad is dying of cancer and they think he is going to go soon.  But well I think my Grandma is taking us out for dinner tonight - none other than the one the only...Zellers!  LOL.  That is like her favourite restaurant but well me and my mother would rather have a plate of ribs or Chinese...YUMMMM!  Oh well, I won't be greedy, I should just be lucky that I am actually going to go somewhere tonight  Lately everyone has been working!  Chelsey especially has been on the go non-stop and well she doesn't have a single class with me in grade 11 and well I don't know when we will even talk or see each other except for maybe Fridays cause we all usually hang out on Fridays.  School is only a week away now and well I am getting a bit more excited but a little nervous.  Just hopefully everything goes well and well I plan to ace Chemistry and hopefully that will happen!  Last year I don't really know what happened, I was good at anything that involved Science except for in Grade 10.  This year I hope to turn things around a bit, but of course still keep my good Math mark.  And knowing how Math last year was a big emotional roller coaster it will be even more difficult this year.  But well I took Physics and have it in the 2nd Semester and well last year I wasn't all that great at it and now I am having second thoughts about it.  I was so confident before that I wanted to do it though, and well I think after doing Math 20 Pure in the 1st Semester I should be able to handle it.  I will probably just try it for a while and see how it goes.  It would be pretty funny though if that ended up to be my highest mark.  I mean anything can happen can't it?!?!  I guess no one really ever knows.  I am just going to put my heart into everything I do and what ever happens was just meant to be!

      Yesterday I didn't do alot except go to church, hang around the house, and bake some cookies.  Today, first I went to the mall and got some lunch at that new little place to eat in Sears.  Later I bought myself some socks - need those for sure!  And I also got myself a new bag for school.  Then I bought a pair of jeans for myself and that was basically my day.  Nothing too exciting because well I am trying to get in as much rest as possible before school starts.

      It was just one of those days today - the ones where you kind of just take it easy because you don't really have anything planned.  Well basically all I did was *Majorly* clean my room today cause I all of a sudden had this like erge for everything to be clean.  Sure is funny isn't it.  And well tonight I think I am going to watch some sappy movie my Mom rented even though I don't really care for those but later at 9:00 PM they are having a special Big Brother Episode where there is going to be a surprise 'twist' to the show.  I can't wait!  And well Reichen and Chip won the Amazing Race which I totally think they deserved and well the new Survivor is starting some time in September so I am really exited for that!

      Well lets just say I am sooooo tired right now but I don't want to admit that or anything cause I am like still young!  And well today my Mom, her friend Linda from Winnipeg and me all went to Heritage Park today and we basically did it all.  We went on the boat, the train, and to tons of shops and exibits.  We even had a free breakfast and lunch there.  Then later on we went to Chinook Centre and went shopping!

      Well this morning I went to get my hair done and I am kind of getting used to it now.  I wanted something a little bit more vibrant because I am not really the conservative type but it is very nice and I actually really like it.  I also met with Anne today to talk to her about becoming catholic and that went pretty good but I don't really know where I am going to find the time to do all of this while also trying to do my school work.  Also at Super Store today I saw Claire and her Mom and they couldn't stop saying how good I looked.  Maybe I lost more weight then I thought I did cause people are really starting to notice now and I actually feel really great I mean I really like it when I hear things like that.  In the past especially there are somethings I would like to forget and I haven't even told Chels about them which is how deep those secrets are but things are starting to turn around now.  I'm getting much more confident, thinner, and much more happier and I just hope it all continues to rise.

      Today I went to South Centre and got a new pair of leather shoes, a belt, and a new bag.  I had alot of fun but all my birthday money is going to be going before I can blink!  Tonight I am going to that teen night thing and we are having free pizza and cotton candy not like I really need that or anything.  I think I am really starting to get annoying counting calories and everything and I would like to think I am not obsessed but I am begginning to think I might be.  It has gotten as bad as skipping meals and things like that and everytime I eat I feel a huge sense of guilt afterwards.  Maybe this is just normal for teenagers though and everyone is probably just over-reacting.    Anyways I am still excited for chemisty cause well I think I want to either major in Chem or Bio but I am not sure which one I like better or which one I will advance at more quickly.  I am really thinking I want to become a high school teacher.  Like I am not the most talented at science or anything and even though sometimes it seems really hard but it just really interests me.  When I see people doing their thing and teaching kids about my age I think how cool it would be to do that same thing.  I really look up to alot of older people that have chosen the teaching profession - I mean if you really get to know them they are not as different from teenagers than everyone thinks - they are caring, compassionate, and really have an understanding of what others are going through.  I'm sure it is not the easiest job with the best pay but I remember a quote I once read that went something like  "Chose a job you love and you will never have to work a day in your life." The quote really speaks to me strongly because I mean I would rather be enjoying life than rich and unhappy.  Still I continue to wonder about the future - Like will I ever meet someone that loves me back and will I ever get married and have kids.  Just the normal things that people are expected of today.  Considering I haven't been with many guys really it concerns me but most people say high school relationships don't usually work out.  It is really quite confusing, in fact almost everything in life has never really made sense.  Like this summer I really had the worst drivers ed. experience ever, met a boy and fell in love but that turned out awful, and couldn't even find a job.  But really now that I think about it I am not ready to drive yet and I should take more time to improve, I know now what kind of guy I *DON'T* want and exactly how I *DON'T* want to be treated, and now that I have seen my school schedule I was thinking "Thank Goodness I don't have a job because I know that would not be about to handle everything."  So I guess everything really happens for a reason and I feel that all the great and wonderful people I meet and have met in my life are there for a reason!

      I finally got my schedule on August 18th the day after my birthday!  I've never been so excited to open my mail before and what a relief it was!  I absolutely love my new schedule for next year and I am so excited for chemistry and I don't even know why.  Maybe secretly I really like it and I just won't confess...lol!  My summer however wasn't all that and well it was pretty bad except for the odd days here and there but I suppose everything happens for a reason.  And well yesterday Chels and I went shopping and we both bought the same pants for school - like how totally cool and she got me this awesome ring for my birthday that matches the one she has!  I'm getting my hair done Thursay and nope I probably won't look like myself anymore but that's the whole point!  And well I had a little romance of my own over the summer but the book is still open so I won't say anymore until the chapter ends and the book is closed.

      Well I made it to my comp finally to write this.  All that math and Chem..oh man!!  But well I REALLY wanted to prepare really well for my quiz tommorow and well I am feeling pretty confident - but not over confident of course but I KNOW that if I want to do good I really believe that I have to power to.  And well I've got the Chem quiz on Friday but I am having some diffuculty understand the stuff and I did go to tutorial today which sort of helped but it's still confusing so I think I am gonna go for tutorial tommorow too and well what ever happens with my Chem quiz at least I know that I did my best and tried really hard.  And well this morning me and Chels got into a huge and I mean HUGE fight.  In fact I don't think we have ever had one quite as bad as the one this morning.  Because well I told her I liked Alex and all but we had a LONG and I mean long talk about how that stays between me and her so I found out yesterday that she told Lenny and well he talked to Alex and well apparently he likes me back which is a good thing and all.  But I was questioning her why she told him because well *I* wanted to talk to Alex and about the way I feel and for once *I* wanted to do something for me and instead of having it done the CHEAP way and having people set others up.  But I guess what's done is nothing and there is nothing that can really change that.  But I am actually not upset that we had that fight.  To be honest when she walked storming off I felt a huge sense of releif.  I feel like I am always trying to live up to her expectations and all and like she thinks she is almight and powerful and great.  Well I don't know how bad my attitude was but I was just questioning her and she took it the wrong way.  I think maybe though some part of myself is changing - espeically my attitude I just don't kow what is up with all that.  Maybe it is just a stage that everyone goes through but at different points in their lives.  But who knows.  I am feeling pretty happy right now actually despite being a bit well majorly confused in chem but math was SOOOOOOOOO awesome today.  I thought it was so fun, and like I was excited to do more practice problems.  Lol...if anything that so does not sound like me but it is so true.     The Untitled Poem  Floating on my feet once more I have looked on through this open door Steped inside to see what I face On this path to a better place  Knowing my attitude isn't always great But in life we must learn to appriciate All the things, the good the bad Even those that may be happy or sad  This is a stage I think all people go through Just some of us wish only we knew How to deal and get through each day Knowing that I can't always have my way  ~Vanessa

      "Sometimes I wonder why I am here" those are the words that kept going through my head tonight.  I must have cried for over half and hour on an off.  I didn't really notice how bad things are going during school because I was busy with other things but tonight I was jus thinking and a huge rush of tears poured from my eyes.  I don't really think it is normal for a teenager to cry almost like every second night or sometimes there have been weeks where I just cry at night but it is getting bad.  I got a 35% on my social M.C. test but I did way better on the long answer and got a 75% so like I do know the material I just don't know why I have to fuck every damn thing up.  I was working on my math but I kept crying and so I decided I would write in my little journal thing cause I just need time to think about things in my life right now.  And well I don't understand the Chem stuff we did today and well I keep trying to inform my math teacher that I really don't understand but I just feel ignored and unimportant.  I am worried about the quiz Wednesday - after all who wouldn't be worried if they didn't understand.  And I tried to get some help today during tutorial but like there was only one lady in the room helping people and there were alot of people with questions so I could barely get any help.  To be honest the schedule and the tutorial thing worked way better for me last year and I was so much happier.  Although I try to put on a nice little smily happy face at school it is hard sometimes.  If someone where to look into my eyes and just "look" as they say it the eyes are the window to the soul.  And yes they truly are because when I stare into my eyes I see all the hurt and pain I feel.  And all the irrational thoughts I get once in a while were coming back into my head again tonight but all my dreams and hopes me so much, which is probably why I haven't given up.  But I don't know what to do and I don't know why I just can't understand like everyone else.  I mean I am going to the resource room, I'm asking questions, I am going to tutorial and stuff and I mean I don't know what else to do.  And my marks worry me because that is the ONLY thing my parents ever talk to other people about, like last year how they were like "Oh and Vanessa is on Hounors w. Distinction" and blah, blah, blah.  Now what the hell are they suppose to brag about...that I can barely get good marks anymore.  Hmmm lets see...I can only wonder, they probably just won't talk about me at all like I am so unimportant and they only seem to worry mostly like about Ben and Melissa and everytime my Dad flys in he is always at his place and the only time I saw him last time was when we ate meals.  I just wish there were answers right now, I wish that someone could explain to me why everything is so difficult right now and is eating away at me self-esteem, self-worth, and at my heart and happiness.  I wish that I could wake up and everything would be ok - but in reality it just isn't ok.  And I wish that someone could look into my eyes and truly understand what I am going through and feeling and I wish for once that maybe someone could just be there for me to hold or hug.  To just stand there and feel someone else's arms around me reasuring me everything will be alright and just holding me for what seems forever until everything feels alright.

      I went to church this morning which totally made me feel good afterwards.  Chelsey called me last night so we went out for dinner to Perkins cause we both used to work there and stuff and that was like so fun and well after we just hung out at her house and talked for like a million hours and when andreanna got home from work we were all listening to Christmas music..Lol.  Then I left around like sometime after eleven but man was it creepy walking in the dark.  Like I know self defense and all and even though I have my brown belt I kept thinking someone was like behind me or like hiddin in the bushes.  Then like I heard this noise and looked back and then when I looked forward again and I saw this massive shadow and I almost had a heart attack cause I thought it was someone else - luckily it was only my own shadow though.    And well I went to South Centre today and got a new winter jacket and some boots for when it snows and stuff and well I was doing my homework but social is no boring and I am behind and I just don't want to think about it anymore.  It is driving me up the wall cause I really hate how we always have to work through those guides and stuff cause I just don't have the time and patience to sit there and do that kind of thing - I wish they would just get up and teach already and well they should at least give an option if we want to be taught by someone or if we want to do it independantly but ya know I don't think that is going to happen.  And well AHHHHHHH math quiz Wednesday and I don't understand.  And well my goodness lately I've been coming to have like a totally obsession with space and that.  I don't want to be no astronaght (sp?!?) or nothing like that but I actually find it really fasinating and really cool!               I mean sometimes I wonder...what am I good at anyway - I have a lack of answers when it comes to that and when it comes down to it I don't really know if I have any talents.  I mean lets see I am not very good at Chem, or Math, or Social, or English, or Physics and yes the list goes on.  I've played sever years of soccer with fourteen medals, play the flute but I don't take band anymore because the theory is too hard for me, been sewing for a couple of years but really not very good at that, used to do a form of Korean Martials Arts and I have my brown belt but all that doesn't make me talented.  Why does it have to be like that...I mean just WHY???  I definetly KNOW it is not from lack of effort so I just really don't know and wish I did.  I wish I had some subject that I just would naturally excel at but Drama doesn't count because well anyone can act if they put the effort in and I wish that I just had something special that I could do that would define ME.  But right now I don't feel like there is.  And knowing that I am not doing well in Chem right now and I DON'T want to major in Physics if I am not good at Bio next term I have no idea what my purpose anywhere is.  I mean I know that my HEART tells me that no matters what happens my dream is to be some sort of Secondary Science Teacher and I couldn't imagine doing anything but that but in my MIND I just don't know if I can do it.  And I KNOW that if I don't become some sorta of teacher that has something to do with Science I will regret it all my life and will always wonder well WHAT If.... and will probably not be very happy.  I was so confident at the end of last year and so happy but I don't know what happened to all that happiness and I don't know what happened to that girl I once knew will all that confidence.  But then summer happened, and it changed everything.  Everything right now is changing and I don't really like change very much.  I was happy the way everything was last year but over the summer like Drivers Ed totally ruined my confidence and self-esteem cause of the fucking bitch of a lady who called herself Kathy who thought that she could stomp all over teenagers and tell them they are no good at anything.  I mean I don't hate alot of people and that is not really my think but I do know that I HATE that Kathy girl.  And well even though I met Aaron over the Summer our intial relationship was good but then everything just fell apart.  Everything fell apart in the Summer just the way it is falling apart now.     Hopes and Dreams  Just feels like everything is falling Knowing what my heart is calling Wondering in this mind of mine Hope to know what is right in time  Dreams aren’t what they used to be Confidence left I cannot find in me Searching in this life of mine Hanging on this one lifeline  Gasping for that breath to take Looking around for a purpose I can make Questioning this authority somehow Thinking of these dreams right now  Falling through this dirty floor Knowing I am not welcome anymore Left alone and on my own Searching for a brand new home  Where shall my heart sleep tonight? These dreams are drained from this flight Everything now keeps falling in Surrounded by hopes I can only loose or win  Looking through the hands of time Finally I found that someone so kind Special, rare, and precious too She is someone just like you  When I am lost, she guides me through She knows just what she is suppose to do Sometimes I wish I could be just like her All her hopes and dreams they are so sure  In this destination she stands still But here I am waiting for that day until I find my confidence and achieve these dreams Knowing I have the willpower and the means  ~Vanessa     Maybe in a couple years from now I will probably laugh at the way I feel now.  But right now it feels so real and it feels like my heart is being crushed by everything.  My hopes, my dreams, my goals - all that I have even wanted in life I don't even know if I wil ever have any of it.  And hopefully in a few years I'll be at the U of C.  I've got it all planned out I just have to get the marks and everything which is a challenge now and I heard that now they only accept people with the highest marks and that is what it is based on.  But well I want to do three years in the science field and get a degree and then do the teaching program for two years and then get a job teaching somewhere is the S.W. or S.E. at a highschool and then I want to do evening classes and go for my masters in teaching.  That's my plan but somewhere along the way I want to meet my husband which I hope will be a big church go-er and someone who is also a teacher then I want two kids.  Not one, not three but two because one is not enough and three is too many.  I wish the sex of kids were in my control though cause I want two girls - Edele and Janine but ya know if so happens that I have a boy I like the names Eryk and Jaden.  So it's not like I don't know what I want in life because I KNOW EXACTLY what I want I just don't really know how to get there because it is not something that anyone can even have total control of.  and well I guess I just don't know and for now I will just have to keep going from day to day knowing where I want to go and trying to get there.

And well  I got part of my homework done but that darn ole' procrastination ya know has to kick in sometime and boy did it even kick in.  And well I tried to finish my math homework but well I am really confused but she never finished the lesson and well luckily we get a work day on monday.  And oh man does this pic ever remind of worried I can be at times about Chem.  LOL.

      Was today even better!  I actually felt happy today - really happy.  Today I actually smiled for once in like what seems a thousand years!  Everything just seemed to go right.  Lucky pennies really are lucky cause yesterday morning I found one on heads up.  I did awesome on my Chem test compares to other marks - I got a 74% but like that is really good for me right now and I studied like mad for that test.  And Britt just called!!!  I haven't talked to her in ages!!  She goes to Scarlet and stuff and we just had like a big long talk for an hour!  Today me and Alex went out for lunch and then we met up with Tyler, Ash, Sarah,  Ali, Lenny, and Trav.  I hope I don't gain like tons of weight cause well I couldn't resist the temptation and I HAD to get a chocolate brownie Frap.  God was that ever good and well I drank that thinking I would just skip supper and it would make up for all the calories but then I get home and my mom had ordered my fav. pizza - bacon and tomato and well I HAD to have some of that.  So yeah basically I feel like really guilty cause I had way to much food today and well that ain't good.  But well I had such a good time today and Chels wasn't there.  No one to fight with means no one to upset me and it actually was really nice.  Instead of speding all my time with chels I spent it with everyone else and it was so awesome.  I think my and Alex might have something between up - the romantic chemistry is totally there and he wants to walk with me to school one day even though it will be a long walk from my house.  Everything was just so awesome today and I even did the Chem lab like really well too cause for once I understood the directions and I actually felt like I did that lab without any help and like after I even cleaned out all the beakers for the teacher for her next class and well I stayed a bit later and the Chem teacher told me I didn't have to do it but it felt good to contribute to something and I felt like I could actually help with something for once.  It was nice.  I'm happy at the moment and everything seems like it is going well.  To be honest Chels is alright but I had way more fun with out her.  It is sad to say but is true.  When we are not around each other we don't argue or disagree, I think for now it might be better for us to be apart.  Me and her are both going through alot of different and difficult times and well I think we just can't deal with all of it and it causes us to argue.  Besides I feel like I am getting to know my other friends in a greater depth.     Future and Past  These days are different Comes with a new foundation For times have been not so vast Searching for this sharp content  Then I saw the wrong,  Now I see the right Looking back in history, Shall not dwell on each date  Craft a future for what you crave In your spirit, one can recognize Where the heart slumbers in aspiration Only you know where you want to go  Take the stairs one step at a time Acquire the understanding of determination Know that amid willpower you can grasp a hold  Anything is probable, everything hugs potential  Lacking friends with choices firm Not one to steer, simply yourself to depend People transform and people depart Whether future or past, just follow your heart  ~Vanessa

      Well I definetly thought my Chem quiz went good today but last time I thought something went really it good it didn't quite turn out how I wanted it too.  The only thing I really got confused with was dissociation vs. ionization but I thought everything was alright.  And well I got a 73% on my math test which is ok but I know I am so much smarter than that and could do better but I messed up two M.C. questions and they are worth 2 marks each.  And well last time I got a 72% on a test the math teacher told me that I could do better and she told me that she knows I can do the material and then today I got like one percent higher and she was like "Oh Vanessa you did so awesome" so yeah that doesn't really make any sense and I think she was just trying to make me feel good.    And well AGAIN me and Chels got into another fight this time it was during lunch.  I feel kind of bad through I mean I NEVER meant to be harsh or mean or anything like that but I guess it came out that way.  I just was informing her that I thought maybe she should eat a little more cause sometimes she skips meals and stuff and she is so small and thin and it worries me.  And then she was accusing me of calling her anorexic which NEVER once came out of my mouth at all, it came from her head.  I was never trying to upset her, or make her angry or mad at me, I was only worried.  But she got all defensive and told me she was sick or me and said that "Every time we talk we always argue"  which I totally can agree on cause that is EXACTLY how I feel too.  But well I don't think me and her stand on high grounds right now, we can never agree and I always feel I am competing about her.  I hate it how she never stops talking about Chem and "oh I get this, and Oh this makes so much sense."  It is SO annoything and it makes me feel really bad about myself because it makes me feel like I can't do anything right.  Sometimes I wish Monet had never come to the school this year I mean she is a nice girl but ever since she came along me and Chels can do nothing but argue and fights and today Chels walked right by me in the hall and didn't even notice me - Go figure she was too busy talking to Monet to notice I was ever there.  I feel so lost, so empty it was like me and Chels and so much in common and she was my best friend.  But I guess people change, but I don't want it to be true I NEVER wanted it to be true.  I don't know who I really define as a good of friend as she was, I don't really have any other friends that I could share that best friend relationship thing with.  I am confused again right now but I suppose that is the whole point of being a teen.     Thoughts of my Heart  Always fighting, Nothing is right Monet comes along, Steals you away Why does it have to be like this?  Never wanted this friendship to end Something came between us We are different people, different now Different goals, different dreams  A same pure heart though Music taste we shared Fun times together Especially summer, remember?  What went wrong? What did I say? To make you feel mad and angry Everything is this way  I do not know what to do Have no clue what to say Do not know how to heal Cannot figure how to deal  Friends do come Friends do go Why though must it be you Not this time, one more change  Work things out Play with a better hand Get things straight Tell our story  Why can't we just work things out? Why give up? It is not that just easy It is the easy way out  And if I had the courage strong To talk to you to find the time Make things better Heal this flood tonight  Things are different now Must admit No one to talk to, to one to share those times together, precious and rare  To only remember tommorow just is One more day to work together Find a way to heal this scar Make this better, lighten this load  Sometimes only you can give Just some choices Seem so simple To die or to live  Wondering if I were gone or pleading for a life not worth Would anyone care? How would I know  Blood so vain Stab through my heart Consume to many pills My wrists are and art  If I were just struggling to make it through would you be there? Would you care too?  ~Vanessa     And lately Alex has totally been coming on to me, and to be honest I actually really sort of like it.  I never thought it would ever be him of all people and I don't think he ever though he would like me cause he always seemed to have a thing for Ash but as I said before - people change, times change, things change.  This whole world is like one big circle of change.  And now that I think of it Alex actually would be so my match.  I mean we have our differences but he is URAINIAN! and so am I which is totally cool cause everyone in my family ends up marrying a Ukrainian guy by fait I guess cause no one ever plans for it to happen.  Like my sis caught that cutie urainian Ben which she is getting married to next year.  Melissa is taking me shopping for my dress in December and I am the Maid of Honor.  It is gonna be so cool and I get a purple dress cause that is the theme color of the wedding!  My fav. color!  Man it feels like I have so much to say cause well who else am I going to talk to?!?!...I have no clue.  Chelsey used to be there to talk, but another reason why I just get soooo angry at her and others sometimes is I never get ANYTHING out but when I do get something out - I sure get alot more to come out than planned.  And well yeah usually end up exploding at people.  I wonder if anyone is going to want to eat lunch with me tommorow - everyone always goes to A&W but I don't really like it there cause there are no heathy kinds of foods.  Maybe I can drag Alex or Ash to Wendys to have a good ole' healthy salad with me - HOPEFULLY.  Cause well I have been having lots of hot chocolate lately cause of my cold and sore throat and well during dinner for a couple nights this week I have been like the incredible eater or something because I just can't stop eating at night now which is probably why I haven't lost any more weight since the summer but everyone keeps coming up to me and saying how they didn't recongnize me like Alison that I met in Drama last year she told me today that she didn't even realize who I was until like the third week of school.  I didn't realize my weight loss was that noticable but HA..after like a million times to figure out how to loose weight the answer is so simple however I haven't have the will power lately to keep up with my good healthy eating habits quite often so once in a while I slip in one of those sugary pops that I am sure are like the worst things in the world cause of all the sugar.  But well I have lost about 40 pounds since April which is definetly something that I definetly could not predict a while's back but well I guess it was my sis in the first place that got me going.  She started to loose weight for her wedding and then I wanted to loose some because I didn't want her being thinner than me and well then me and her lost some weight and now we can fit in each others clothes so yeah when I get to see her I might raid her somewhat of a wardrobe cause she always raids my closet when she comes over.  But well they are living in their trailer in their backyard right now because of the water main break that happened a while ago.  It flooded there house and causes major damage so the house is basically like falling apart now and the walls are caving in a and buckling so they are probably gonna get a new house built after the old one is torn down and stuff and as long as no one disapproves of the plan and stuff.  It is complicated and they are young so it ain't like they have alot of money and the city sure didn't cover much for insurance.

      I just finished my long studying and practicing of Chem and guess what I think I understand!!  I am feeling really confident about the quiz tommorow because I was thinking about what my math teacher said that if I had confidence I would be much better at things and right now I feel like I really believe in myself and that I can do anything.     Believing  Yes, Joyful it seems Understanding Makes so much sense I believe  And remember and Listened to the words Gave me advice Told me to be confident  With confidence ANYTHING is possible, achievable Reachable goals attainable  I believe With errors, comes success Disbelief, AND belief Sadness, AND Happiness  All makes so much sense Know I can make it through Have been searching for Found the light  knowing Thinking Wondering BELIEVING  In my heart I know What path I must follow CURVES along the way but we all get there  One way or another All works out, Gods plan Never know what comes next Just keep believing  and I know now Would not give up chem for anything these dreams, goals, aspirations mean something so special  So important, ALWAYS I know where my heart lies Realize what makes me heart beat and I believe that I can do anything  ~Vanessa

      Ok well I am not sure how the math test went because I am not too sure if I did the last question right (word problem) ya of course ya know now really my thing.  And well Social was alright but I kinda totally blew up at Chelsey and I feel really bad.  It was kind of something like this "I just don't understand, and if you try to help me how will that be different?  Everytime someone explains it I never understand.  I am so sick of never understanding and sick of trying and never getting anything. I never understand anything and teacher probably thinks I am like the stupiest person in her class.  It's just really frustrating."  Now that I think of what I said I sound so negative towards myself and I wish like yesterday the math teacher said, all I need if confidence but sometimes it's so hard to have that because I mean I really am not doing too well in Chem.  My feelings are something like this right now:     What I am Feeling Today  So tired  SICK  Trying to understand  Just do not get it   Frustrated  UPSET  Unhappy,  Underestimated  Wish that I would know   How do I make things right?  Correct mistakes  MARKS  So down, so down below   Is this just me?  The way I feel  Am I the only one?  How can I know?   Chem quiz  tommorow  Studying soon  Feel it is so important  Gotta make it through   Just when I can only think  things just might get better  Worse it seems to my eye  Light or Darkness now?   Crying in the silence of  my heart so deep and solid  breaking up the pieces so  to make them all but one part   Thinking in this gift of mine  What shall I do?  I'm so confused right now  All I want is to make it through   ~Vanessa

      Today well I dunno.  OK so I got a 60 something on my math quiz 10.5/16 but well I know it is not the end of the world and well it was just because I didn't understand the last question.  My math teacher was also being really nice today and she was so right.  Ya know she was telling me about how I am a really really great student and if I just had the confidence then I could do so much more.  She is right.  But well it is kind of the same for Chem but I am REALLY REALLY trying and well I think my average right now might be like a 56% and anyone who knows me knows that is NOT like me at all.  I am TRYING so HARD, but I really don't understand however I understand more than I did than when I began.  I am worried about the quiz for Chem thurs cause I am having diffuculty and the science wing is all closed tommorow cause it is Wednesday tommorow so I am not sure when I will get the help I need.  Anyways I don't know what to do about Chem cause well I could drop it and make life easier but I NEED chem for University like the courses I want to do, but well even if I do pass I don't think they are gonna want someone with like a 56 some average in there.  I am SOOO CONFUSED and I WISH I KNEW just what I do.  Well after I write a poem about how I feel right now I need to go practice my math for tommorows test.     Wondering Why?      Forever, it seems  One more breath, one more time  Wondering why, oh why, oh why  Is this happening?   Why Chem, why me, why now  Why  Why   Why    Why     Why?!  I sit here and think and wish  Things will get better   I must pass chem  Dig my way through this tunnel  Find the exit  Looking for it, forever   Wandering round,  Finding that escape somewhere  somehow  Out in darkness   Tears unending  Searching  Wishing for not much,  Someone to hug, someone to hold   A person so special  Not too young, never too old  With power so strong  To heal this heart   Passing on days  Like they mean so much  Why are things so hard  Why must this be happening?   And In the end  I still do not know  Will I be happy?  Where will I go?   How will I get there?  What job will I do?  Will I pass my classes?  If only I knew   Forever, it seems  One more breath, one more time  Wondering why, oh why, oh why  Is this happening?   ~Vanessa

      I thought thing were starting to change but then TODAY happened.  I got a 60% on the Chem test and honestly in my heart I really though I did good, I studied more for that test that I usually study for tests just because I wanted to do good.  I spent half of the night crying over it and the fact that I don't understand Chem and my teacher is sorta trying to help but like she doesn't make any sense and I don't know who else to ask.  I mean I wasn't always amazing at balancing equations but now all the concepts are building on a skill I am weak at and I am confused about dissociation and non-ionic, total ionic, and net ionic equations.  Right when I got my mark back there again going through my head was "why am I on this earth, and what is my purpse??"  I know I want to teach science so bad by why does reaching my goal seem so difficult right now, I am having those bad thoughts again roll through my heads - the ones about suicide and death, the thoughts I wish I didn't have but are so real and deepest thoughts that I can't share with anyone.  And well I tried to get help with my math and all but well today I did the quiz and well I didn't understand the last question at all.  Go figure a word problem thing but well I couldn't get part A right and I couldn't even finish part B or C because part A's answer was crucial - so basically there goes 5 marks down that drain - five important marks.  I think my math teacher really understands what hard time I am having trying to make sense of everything and I am getting really frustrated trying to figure out things - everything is just becoming so difficult.  I don't want to admit it to myself but in honestly reality I don't know how I will even make honors, I mean it mean's soooooo much to me yet I am trying my BEST right now, my very best and I don't know what else to do.  And I was thinking too - do I have a talent, what is my talent.  When I thought about this there was not a single thing that I can think of that makes me talented at something, the only thing that ever made me proud was marks because it was something that was earned through hard work.  But what about now...where is all my hard work getting me to, I mean I guess no one's road to achieve all their goals and dreams is perfect but I never thought it was this bad ever for anyone.  I just pray that tommorow goes better, and that maybe I will understand Chem a little more, and maybe my math teacher will help me with my math and understand that I really am very confused.  Maybe someone special will see me and say "hi" or maybe they will just smile.  Maybe things won't be perfect, but I can try to make things better.  I never really know what the future holds so all I can hope and wish for is that tommorow will be better than today.

      Well Friday was good.  I so needed that Friday.  Me and Chels had a BIG & LONG talk on the bus and C-Train and went to lunch with Eric.  Then after we went shopping and worked things out.  Later on we went to Matt's party which I actually had tons of fun and found out that Monet is actually a pretty cool person like Chelsey said.  I guess I just was a bit jealous before and didn't want to try form a friendship with her but now I realize how cool she is.  We might all be going to the mall next Friday or Sunday and maybe have a slummber party with everyone again.  It also felt real good to gorge on some pop and pizza Friday - I haven't been all strict about the whole healthy eating lately but well I'm still doing good with that but well my Grandma made this apple cake and like all weekend long I have been addicted to it.  LOL.  I am like so confused for math though and have my quiz monday so like I might have to bother someone in the morning to get some help and well I am a bit confused about Chem but I think I did pretty good on the unit test so  *FINGERS CROSSED*  because I really need to do good since ya know the quiz didn't go over to well.  I have been studying social like all today like mad cause I have to write the M.C. and Long Answer test either monday or Tuesday but I think I will do it tommorow cause I keep thinkin bout it and it's starting to really stress me out cause I've got so much more on my mind.  And well yesterday night I went to go see Cold Creek Manor but it was just and OK movie but nothing too exiting and well right now I am havin' a big break from studying my social and listening to Hilary Duff - and man is she ever great and a good singer and yeah Chels bought her CD on Friday so we were listening to it then at my house before we went to the party.  And well this morning I went to Church and I always feel really good after Church and I feel I still have problems but I know in my heart I just have to keep going on.  And as Celine would say it "One heart you are following, one dream keeps you wondering" and it sure is.  Everything will be ok in time.

      Finally a great day!!  Ashley was all supportive today and like everything was just going right.  I guess since I was trying to have a good attitude it really does work.  I still am a little confused about math but that can be dealt with tommorow and well I think the Chemisty test went pretty good.  My throat is kind of sore right now but I'm sure that is not too big of a worry and well I felt kind of good today.  You know just one of those little simple nice things that happen in a second they make me feel so special.  Cause well I was walking down the hallway and Mrs. J was there was talking to some other teachers and well she just kind of smiled at me with a kind look.  Man did that even make me feel good, and it is those things that happen in like a second that mean so much.  Tommorow is the CALM carocell and well Matt's party is also tommorow and I can't wait to have some pizza.

      Hmm lets see I got 72% on my math test but I could have had done better if I knew a few more things.  But I feel as if the math teacher actually understand now though that I really do need help with some things which is good.  And tonight I studied for Chemistry but well I have been reviewing since the weekend so I wouldn't have to cram and well I am kind of putting some pressure on myself to do good because my quiz mark wasn't so hot.  And well I had a better day today - didn't cry but well Chelsey and Monet do like everything together and I think how that once used to be me and she denies that we are going are separate ways sometimes but I think it is true.  But well I think I worry to much about that and tommorow I am going to try to just be happy!

      Ok so the day wasn't like totally amazing but it wans't really bad either and I did cry tonight which is an improvement.  I am still having some problems with Chem but I am working to understand it and I do understand it a bit better and well the test is on Thursay.  But well there is lots of pressure on myself to do good because I got 45% on my quiz and I know it is not the end of the world and it is just one thing but it is very important that I do good on the unit test.  Anyway Ryan won Canadian Idol tonight so I am so happy cause well even since Billy got voted out I have been cheering for Ryan even though Billy was always my number one favourite.  And well I had a math test today and I am not really sure how I did because I had a hard time with word problems like usual but I mean they are just hard and it's not like I can just snap my fingers and everything will be fine cause it don't work that way.  But yeah things seemed to be going a little bit better today and well I just hope it continues.

      Here I am again, a little upset again, actaully alot.  Today I REALLY REALLY put my heart into trying to understand chem and I am REALLY trying so hard.  But I just don't understand and I went to tutorial, I am getting help from my Neighbour, I asked the Chem teacher like a million questions in Chem, and even read over the chapters in my text that we are studying!  I have no idea what else do if and honestly if I could understand I would, but unforntunatly I can't just snap my fingers and understand everything right now.  I've been having lots of irrational thoughts today like suicide and I want them to stop but I am thinking maybe dropping Chem would be my best option right now, but how could I even do that.  I would kill my dream of being a Science Teacher or a Bio Major (Biology Teacher) and well I need Chem to do the things I want to do.  And I  *CAN'T*  kill my dream, if I were to ruin that it would be like some one stabbing a knife into my heart, and the thought that is demeaning.  I can't image doing anything else but teaching and I know in my heart that is what I life and breath for.  If I would drop Chem or fail I just don't know where my place in life is, it would feel as if there is no place and no reason for my being here.  I know suicide is wrong but sometimes it feels like nothing will even work out and I cry for what seems like forever wondering WHY??...Why can't God understand how much my dream means to me and how hard I am working to try understand.  Why can't God help me and WHY isn't there an answere to why I just don't understand things as good as everyone else??  I just wish there were someone to hug right now, it sounds silly but I wish someone could just understand what I am feeling and look into my eyes and see how much I am hurting.  I wish sometimes things would get better and I hope they do.

      *Prayer to God*  Dear God,     I have had an interesting week with ups and downs but I feel that my attitude hasn't been all that great around my friends all the time.  Please forgive me, for I do not mean to say some of the things I do it's just that sometimes things just come out of my mouth and later I regret them.  I am feeling like the best friend relationship between Chelsey and I may be in jeopardy so I would ask if you please just help make everything alright.  I feel we are growing apart, even though she claims that is not happening it feels to me that we are.  But I also would like to thank you God for blessing me with the opportunity so meet so many amazing people and I am thankful for their help along the way.  I thank Mrs. J for trying to help me with Chemistry because I know she didn't have to do that, I thank you for her in my life because she is making Chem alot easier for me right now and she is alot more supportive than my T.A.  But I also do thank you for my T.A. because even though she can't help me with Chem it is nice to have some else that can be there more me.  I am also thankful for all my friends and I am thankful for having Chelsey in my life still because I really needed someone there for me this week more than ever, and she was there so thankyou.  But God you also know how hard I work at everything, and you know how much it means to me to make at least Honours, please help me to have confidence in myself that I can do this because lately negative thoughts have been going through my mind.  I suppose I am going through a hard stage in my life right now but in the end I know it will make me a stronger person but I ask that you help me through this hard stage right now.  I am having thoughts about my future career again and I am very serious about it but you know how I want to be a Science Teacher well I am not very good at Physics and not very good at Chem and well that is just how things are - but please, Oh God Please, bless me with the gift of Biology if you only had any idea how much I want this to work.  I could not image doing anything but teaching when I am older, it is what the voice in my head is calling.  My conscience is so strong right now and is has been for a while and I have known since grade 7 that teaching is my calling in life.  Please bless me with the gift of Biology because I know with my hard work and effort, and your blessing that I can accomplish anything.     Thank you God for listening.

      Well today was sort of mixed, I felt happy at times and unhappy at others.  I was happy cause well I got an 85% on my math quiz which is pretty good from me but well I just can't seem to get the hang of Chemistry.  I just wish I knew why it is so hard to understand and learn for me.  I feel like no one else has as much difficulty as I do and it is very frustrating.  My math teacher said some nice things to me today which made me feel good because I thought that maybe she didn't like me or thought I was dumb.  I do think my self-esteem is a little bit low right now but I can't do anything about it.  I just wish, I wish, oh how I wish I just understood Chem though and well everyone thought the quiz was easy and well people after were like "well that sure was easy wasn't it" and well of course I don't want to say that I thought it was hard cause EVERYONE thought it was easy - so just WHY or WHY don't I seem to get anything?!?  And well even since Monet came along I feel me and Chelsey are drifting further and further apart.  I don't have anything against her but it's hard watching my best friend laugh and seem to have a better time with her than me.  Chels always seems to have room for Mike or Monet but never me.  And it hurts.  But well it kind of cheered me up when I found out that I didn't have to write the test for the Religion unit cause I finished my work.  Everything this just doesn't seem to want to work out though and I feel upset about things - there are just so many things, and things beyond my control.  I will probably get my chem test back tommorow and well I don't think I did to well so I don't know what I am going to do.  I don't understand the Chem teacher at all but I am really trying to understand.  I am having mixed thoughts about my career choice too, I mean I just KNOW that I want to teach something that has to do with Science in the High School level but I am not very good at Physics or Chem and well Bio (have it next term) is the only thing left.  I LOVE Science so much though and I don't know why I just can't seem to get the concepts of things and understand.  I just wish I was a little more happier, and that maybe I could alot more nicer to others, and I wish that maybe for once I could just UNDERSTAND.  I wish.

      Well I do think there is something wrong and well I thought that might be like some kind of problem affecting learning or something but well I asked someone close if they thought it was possible but well they just laughed.  Maybe they are right but I feel there is something wrong.  Especially Chemisty right now, I really can't take it.  I mean I know I am stressed out when I cry every night.  Today was a bit better than the rest though, and yeah I still cried for like the 6th day in a row but I felt that someone actually kind of  cared  for once.  I was just sitting up in the Science wing and Mrs. J comes up and asks me how my Chemisty is going.  Little things do make a  big difference  because I feel like she actually wants to help me and help me to pass Chemistry.  She offered her help during tutorial which is nice because I am really stressed and I honestly don't understand a word the Chem teacher says.  It's so confusing, it's like she could speak another language and I still would know the same thing as if she were speaking English.  And her directions for the lab we did today were so confusing - I really want to be able to do stuff and not just look lazy but well I don't even understand her directions but well I always found it kind of hard to understand directions when people just tell me so well it would of been nice if she could have written them out but I guess no one really learns that way except me.  I still keep wondering why I just can't get the hang of things..Chem, Math etc.  I wish there was just an answer.  I feel like I have been so rude lately too or like when someone asks me something I don't even think before I speak I just... SPEAK .  And well I sit in like this little corner on the left side of the Chem class where there is like no one to ask when I don't get anything, and well it's hard to feel like part of the class because I feel so far away - I call it the little island and I have to be careful not to lean to far back or else I'll hit my head on the pencil sharpener..lol I actually did that cause well I have to admit I am such a major clutz!  I just wish things would start going a little better and well I wish I could stop crying at night cause I am at the point where I toss and turn for even and like hardly get any sleep.  It will be nice to talk to Mrs. J tommorow it's like she is the only person who understands what I feel and what I am going through with Chem, and I pray to God that she can help me so I can do good on my quiz.

      It's like I am going through an emotional roller coaster.  Everything is so much harded this year and alot more stressful.  I don't really feel comfortable yet and it's really hard especially for Math because I really need help but I don't know really how to ask the right way because I don't feel a trust level with that teacher yet.  And well her teaching style is really not matched with mine at all - I never understand what she is doing because she will explain something but will not go through the steps of how to do the problem and she usually shows like one or two examples and expects the rest of the problems to be tried out on our own - well that  *DOESN'T*  work because if I don't understand how to do something in the first place I won't know how to try it and get it right.  I've cried just about everyday so far this week and well I had a talk with Chels yesterday and that helped me figure out things but there are still other things that I haven't talked to her about and that maybe I need to figure out on my own.  I just really hope on Monday my TA or McDougall will be there so they can explain the math to me because that is really my only hope right now.  I feel so energy drained and kind of dumb, I feel like everyone else is good at math and I'm not, everyone is maybe better than me at chem, and so on.  That is just how I feel right now but I don't want to feel that way.  I am so confused and I am having feelings that I might fail math which would ruin everything.  It would ruin my whole life because of course my dream of becoming some sort of Science teacher would be ruined and well I need Pure Math 30 for that and well I have to pass my Sciences too.  I am having second thoughts about my career choice but not that I really want to.  I mean I  *KNOW*  that I want to be a teacher but I don't know what kind of teacher.  I really love science, in fact I always have really liked it but I am not the strongest at it, and well Math I would never want to teach anyways, English I am really not strong in reading comp at all and I NEVER understand that stuff so that would be out of the question, and even though in Social I usually pull off a good mark it just doesn't interest me the way in which Science does.  So I am just really confused, don't know how things are going to turn out, all I really want right now it to just be hugged - for someone just to hold me and tell me everything will be ok.  But I don't know if things will be ok or what is going to happen, there is no one here right now.

      Today wasn't that great.  I feel like I've turned evil, I mean I am all stressed out already and feel like I can't handle anything.  I feel like I have no control.  I have no idea what to do - I'm just really confused right now I don't know what I should do.  I don't know if I should drop any courses or what...I just don't know.  I am starting to have some feelings that maybe I don't want to teach science, but it's confusing because that is my dream and I didn't even imagine giving up on it.  And I guess me and chels sorta had like a little fight today about stuff I mean we are going through so much right both and usually we support each other but lately there's been no one there and well I have to admit it's hard because I sit and cry for about half and hour each night.  She's always complaining about her problems and so am I but she gets mad everytime I complain yet she does the same thing.  Sometimes I have bad thoughts like suicide but I don't think I could ruin all my dreams like that, but I am just very confused and plan to talk things over with Chels tommorow.

      First day of school today!!  Lets see it took me and hour and three minutes to get my yearbook photo, half an hour for my id, and about five minutes for my bus pass.  Then I was like starving to me, chels, ash, alicia, and sarah all went to Wendy's for lunch and I got myself a Chicken BLT salad with a big lemonade!  Yum!  Then we went back to the school to get something of Chelsey's and well we decided to see her sis and then we saw Mrs. J which we totally admire and think she is so cool and awesome.  It was nice to talk to her and see her again.

      I had the biggest and greatest sleep yesterday night because it was technically that last time I really get to sleep in because school starts  *TOMMOROW* which is quite a scary thought when you think about it.  Today I helped my Dad and Ben unload the van and the trucks to store their stuff in our garage and well I am just kind of taking it easy today and hopefully I will get a hold of Chels to talk to her for a while.  And well I feel like I am the queen of eating or something like that because I had breakfast and then like an hour after that everyone was eating lunch and desert so I couldn't help but stare at the food so I decided to eat lunch to.  Little did I know though is that I would end up eating pie and ice cream too.  Hopefully I won't gain too much weight from that but I should be fine as long as I don't keep that up.  Now I think I am going to go and enjoy my last day of holidays!

      On Wednesday night over to thursday night I had well the most interesting dream.  Usually I don't dream alot during the school week nights and stuff but this dream was long, sorta made sense is some ways and not in others, but I do feel it had a message.   My Dream that other night  My mother and I were going to this friends of my moms that lives in Ogden.  I remember first standing outside and then looking to the house on the left next to it.  I looked in and there was the living room with a couch and a TV but the on the screen was just that static grey kinda picture.  I remember going into my moms friends house and she took us to the backyard.  Then I remember seeing one my sisters rabbits and I said "Oh Adora" thened I look at that house on the left and Mrs. J was sitting there.  She looked at me as if she knew I was going to be there and said "How was Friday" and I just said "It was good" and that is all I remember from that seen.  Later on I was at a park that was close to the houses, but well I don't know how I got to the park.  Anyways there were these two swings and I sat on one of them and beside me on the other swing was this older woman.  She wasn't like wrinky and granny old but like she was "older" you know.  This lady seemed familiar and had like sorta yellowish, goldish, blondish, sorta whitish kinda hair - basically it was like a blonde but a mix of different colors but I am pretty sure I have never met her or seen her in my life.  She sat there at started telling me about Mrs. J's past.  She told me that the year before she taught at my school nothing in her life had been going right.  She said that she was at the lowest point in her life and she didn't think things could get better and the only thing that kept her going was her kids in her life but then the lady continued and said that she was going through a really rough time in her life and a really "hard stage" in life.  Then she described to me that we all go through these "hard stages" in life at one point or another.  This dream was like odd cause well I hardly ever dream and I swear that dream felt like hours and hours.  I think it was kinda like a message to me though.  Symbolism I guess.  I think since I am having a tough time right now my dream meant that it is normal.  That sometimes people just feel that way - we all feel that way no matter who we are, where we come from, what we look like.  We all feel pain, we all feel sadness.  That seriously is the most interesting dream I have EVER had.  And like it sorta makes sense but sorta doesn't and well I don't think it is true although it could be - I just think there is like stuff on my conscience and somethin' is trying to get some kinda message to me. ___________________________________________________________________________________________   I went to Megan's party and slept over.  OMG it was SOOOOOOOO fun and I met lots of new people.  I feel a transition happening.  Even since I met megan my friend range has expanded and slowly I am being excepted into the more popular crowd.  I mean I like my friends popularity or not, that was never an issue.  But it is also real nice to like have other friends too.  We watched so many movies, we watched The Ring, the Rocky Horror Picture Show, Labarinth that dumb movie for kids cause David Bowie is in it and we like watched all the parts that he sings in [Oh he is a hottie] and we watched The Little Shop of Horrors and stuff.  Then we played like Cranium which was awesome and funny and great and we ordered pizza and stuff and ate like probably 40000 calories worth of junk too.  And well she lives in Mackenzie and holyman her house is HUGE.  Anyone who lives in Mackenzie does not know how lucky they really are.  And well yeah my mom had to go to faith day today cause she works for the Catholic School District thing or whatev. you wanna call it.  So yeah and then when she got back instead of having lunch the people she works with she left so she could have lunch with me and she took me out to B.P. and we ordered pizza...yum.   Then we went shopping to safeway and she bought me cupcakes so I can pack on another 5 pounds which I will have to loose like next week when all the halloween candy is gone and there is no junk left in the house.  LOL.  Well I am going to watch Survivor now cause I taped it from last night.

      I don't know how to describe today.  There is no one word that comes to mind.  I didn't want to wait like the hour and some minutes for a stupid bus to come so while Chels, Andy, and Eric all went back to Eric's house I decided to walk to school.  They thought I was crazy but like it is just snow and a little windy.  And well I didn't want to really fess up that I love school and for the life of me I HATE being late for things.  We had a quiz in chem today which I hope I did well one but some of the answers just didn't seem right so I will see how I did tommrow or whenev she gets them marked cause she is pretty sick right now.  I am just glad that she was there today and not that sub. guy we had yesterday who had no idea what he was talking about.  At lunch we played asshole again for like a million times and then just before the bell rang me and chels kinda got mad at each other AGAIN but I am not explaining the story cause I am not in the mood for thinking about that stuff.  Today was good I guess, everything felt kinda odd though.  Felt like I was dreaming or something, but I suppose I am just not use to the snow and stuff.  And well I decided I would use my one re-write for the math test tommorow.  I have the "feeling" that that is what I am suppose to do.  It's my conscience I think, I have a very very VERY strong conscience.  Cause well if it were not loud and strong I would have given up my dream of teaching high school bio/science a long time ago, but I can't give it up.  It's my passion, the one think my heart wants, the one think I know that in the end will make me happy.  Well yeah that was today.     Conscience  Hear in this night my conscience is speaking “Take your time and live for today” Be yourself and don’t be anyone else You are who you and there is no doubt  Dreams will be dreams until they make reality Turn them into the passion of your life Life for today but remember tomorrow Here in this life my conscience is speaking  ~Vanessa

      Today was pretty good.  I did the bonus lab for chem at lunch so that kinda took some time away from my lunch but well I would rather have bonus marks.  And omg we had a sub. for Chem today, now that I think of it I had a sub. for all of my classes except for one.  Anyways the sub for chem didn't even know what he was doing and it took like half an hour to balance an equation and then he explained to us percent difference the wrong way, he was actually explaining percent yield but I don't think he knew that.  Then he was talking about SATP but on the board it was written as STAP...LOL!!  I got the biggest laugh out of that and well then he was like "Oh and can someone explain to me how I would figure out so and so kinda problem" and then someone answered that they would use Gravimetric Stoichiometry and he was like "Well I don't understand that."  I hope my actual chem teacher is there tommorow cause I don't want another class with someone who doesn't have a clue about things.  My chem teacher is actually pretty good, smart, and nice.  Sometimes I underestimate her I guess.  And well I have gained 10 pounds in four days.  Scary as it sounds it is true.  I can't stop eating.  When I think about chem I eat.  When I think about not eating I just want to eat more.  Chocolate bars, timbit things from timmys, and I even had a doughnut tonight.  I can't stop but I want to.  I used to be sooooo good with the healthy eating but then everyone is like "vanessa eat this, eat that" and now I can't stop.  I am out of control.  I don't want to starve myself but tommorow I really can't eat ANY junk.  I am starting to worry.  Before I just wanted to be thin and on some level I still would like to be thin but I am more worried at being at a healthy weight.  I just want to be healthy and yeah thin would be nice too.

      I went to the womens show yesterday and it was great.  I got to watch Billy Klippert perform live and then I got his autograph afterwards.  It was soooo awesome!!!!  I loved the free food and drinks.  And well I got to watch a fashion show and a hair style makeover show thing.  It was soooo cool and it was the first time I had ever been to a womens show and now I can't wait for the next one!!!  I also bought myself another charm from my bracelet, it says "dream" on it cause it is to remind me that everyone had to start somewhere and they started with a dream.  I think my mom is getting me a hello kitty charm for Chrismas but yeah that is still a while away.  And well today was actually good.  We saw Mrs. J in the morning and when she smiled and said "hi" that just made my day.  I was all cheerful and happy after that, it was kinda odd but that lady sure has something special about her.  She has this remarkable gift to just cheer people up.  And well I also got Billy to autograph a thing for Chels to and I ever got him to address it to her and she like loved me and gave me a big hug and I have never seen such a hugh smile come over her face.  Me and Chels are usually arguing but today we made peace.  Like I said we were all cheerful and happy today.  I was a little upset about extended TA cause I really needed help with Chem but then I was like about to start crying in chem cause we couldn't go to the lab until we figured out a calculation thing but then Paige came over and helped me with it, told me things would be alright, and told me that if I wanted she could even help me prepare for the quiz.  I think though that I could probably do the quiz really well it is just that I have a hard time with the basic skill of balancing.  That I find very very very hard and also like to write out the equation when it is in a word statement.  I got a 62% on my math test but I think I will use my re-write for the test cause I just have a "feeling" like this is what I should do.  There is like a voice in the back of my mind telling me to re-write it.  At lunch it was also really fun and I got to take my mind away from everything.  We played Crazy Eight's, then Poker, and then we had a few really fun and awesome games of asshole.  Social was like sooooooo boring but Chem well in the lab it was pretty entertaining.  Our chem teacher sat on like one of those stools in the lab and like she broke the chair leg and she was like "whoa" and also feel on her ass.  Oh man that was like the FUNNIEST thing ever, I like could not stop laughing for a good minute.  So yeah things are pretty good for now.  I mean classes are still hard, social is still boring, life right now is great even though I keep eating all the halloween candy and chocolate but I guess I have to live a little.  I have to admit it sure is good!  Well here is a song/poem I wrote about how I WAS feeling, but I think the feeling is slowly passing.  Who knows what is happening this time.  Maybe I am just "adjusting" to this crazy school life.  Hmm only God knows I guess or my heart - or course my heart can't talk, only my consciece can.      What I have to Say  A broken heart, wandering dreams Through the darkness in the latest hours Flames are fading, the colour is erasing Wish I could take this all away  What I am feeling, feeling today More than words could ever say Pain in this heart it can’t be pushed away So you listen to what I have to say  This is today this is today, today, today, today Wandering away wandering away, away, away, away Thinking of death, just one choice, the choice of suicide Have no clue where these thoughts in my heart reside  This is today this is today, today, today, today Wandering away wandering away, away, away, away Looking at her looking at my future world that I want to discover Thinking how she could only be a true light and a hope to me  This is today this is today, today, today, today Wandering away wandering away, away, away, away No one just knows the thought it my head They truly are the ones I dread  This is today this is today, today, today, today Wandering away wandering away, away, away, away Wish I could talk and I wish I could share But sometimes I don’t know who would really care  This is today this is today, today, today, today Wandering away wandering away, away, away, away Thinking what if my dreams don’t come true I wish, I wish, I wish I only knew  A broken heart, wandering dreams Through the darkness in the latest hours Flames are fading, the colour is erasing Wish I could take this all away  What I am feeling, feeling today More than words could ever say Pain in this heart it can’t be pushed away So you listen to what I have to say  ~Vanessa

      I think I am gonna gain weight this weekend.  I wish I could stop obsessing about it but that is all I can think of.  I don't think I will eat tommorow and well the whole week I think I will just "restrict" myself from eating anything other than fruit, fruit, and more fruit.  And damn I knew I shouldn't of had the Chinese for lunch but I have to admit it was good but probably cost my about 5 pounds.  And then I went to Kirsty's party which was fun and all but we had chips, chocolate, pizza, and cake and then I had to come how and have another dinner!!!  I wasn't even hungry but me, my mom, my dad (flew in from Vancouver this weekend), Ben (Sisters Fiance), Melissa, Bens mother, and Bens mothers boyfriend all came for dinner and I *HAD* to eat again cause it would be rude to sit there and watch everyone else at the table.  So I barely ate but I had to eat something so I had like three meatballs and some veggies then I had to have dessert cause company made it and my Mom told me to eat what they brought.  I can't believe I didn't throw up from eating all that, I have never felt my stomach so loaded ever in my life.  On friday we all went so Starbucks and yeah actually I had more junk Friday which is most likely why I am gaining some weight.  I didn't want fast food but no one wanted to come eat a salad with me and I didnt want to eat alone for I just went to A&W to eat cause that is where everyone else wanted to go.  Then at Starbucks Travis bought me a chocolate brownie Frap. which was sooo yummy but I hardly get those cause they are like calorie loaded and later everyone left.  Apparently we "wen't out" really for the first time.  We played arcade games for a while which were actually really fun at the coliseum and then we went to go see Scary Movie which was absolutely hilarious.  He asked if I wanted to go for dinner and well I would have wanted to go if I had been hungry and hadn't eaten fast food earlier but I have to watch what I eat more than others.  Other people eat whatever they want, if I ate whatever I wanted all the time I would gain 20 in like a week.  So then after he just walked me home and well he is actually a pretty good person.  But now that I got to know him a little bit better I think of him as ONLY a good friend and nothing more than that cause I really can't see me dating him.  I don't like him in that way.  And well it does kinda of bother me that he is not really too serious about school cause I am, you know like I have goals, hopes, and dreams and I want to do things with my life and go places.  It bothers me a bit that I was talking him and he had told me that he cheated on his Science test and got caught.  I mean I am sure most people have cheated and yeah in my deepest darkest secrets yeah even I have cheated but not recently.  I mean I would never do that in High School and I don't really know why someone would - well actually maybe I might.  Now that I think back...Grade 6 the worst yeah of my life when every person hated me for no reason and I was the ugliest thing on earth and was always the "bad" kid that always got detention.  Anyone who knows me now would probably be suprised to learn that I was not a very well behaved kid.  Cheating for me though was actually I mean the act itself was bad but I cheated on three of my grade 6 achievments - all but the math test.  And well I only did it cause I was soooo scared of failure and maybe that is what gave Travis his motive.  But well cheated boosted my confidence and I really believe that I could do anything - and well my marks as a kid where never great no matter how hard I work so lots of things I found pointless.  So well that next year I worked my ass off, behaved myself, and had no detentions.  People started to notice me more, and were drawn to me.  Finally I was accepted for once with a good range of people.  So I mean I know Travis did a bad thing but there is ALWAYS something good that comes out of those things even though sometimes it may be SOOOOO hard to see the good.  And well I am proud of myself.  I got into the van today and drove for the first time since my drivers ed experience.  I kept thinkin bout' drving so I drove.  But it was different this time.  This time I wasn't scared of the driving, or the road, or others, or anything.  I have to admit my turns are a little sharp and my judgement needs a little improvement but I am sure that will come eventually.  It takes longer for me to usually learn things anyway and I learned the hard way that sometimes things we have to work our asses off and yet that doesn't make us any wiser or better at things.  Although I was proud for driving again, my mother well she isn't helping anything right now.  I asked her what she thought of my driving and if she thought it improved [and yeah I would be the one to know if it has improved or not] and she was like ummmmm blah, blah, blah and started listing all this bad stuff about my driving.  Then I asked if I could drive home from the party cause well I drove there and she told me "no." And well like if she won't let me drive then how can I practice and get better at driving?!?!?  Like duh you just do wake up and your a better driver, although sometimes I wish it worked that way.

      I got 73% on the chem test!  Yay!  I studied really hard for that and well that mark isn't like amazing but it is not really bad either and right now I am just aiming for over 70% cause that is what is reasonable for my abilities for chem.  My average when from a 67 to a 68.89 or something like that which means it will be rounded to 69.  I mean that mark still isn't too great but at least it went up.  Afterall I would much rather see my average go up then down anyday.  However, the math test is a different story.  I worked my ass off to understand that unit and I really did believe I understood it but some of the questions just stumped me and I didn't really know how to do em cause I got confused.  I really need to boost my math average cause it is at a 70 but with the next unit test mark going in I can only pray, and hope, and wish that maybe I did do good on that math test and I am just underestimating myself.  Afterall I have done the very best I can, and truly believe in my heart that I derserve over and 70% in math and in chem.  I have worked my ass off to understand the stuff to the best of my ability and I have practiced math over and over, I don't know anyone who practices their math as much as I do.  I seriously don't even know who goes to as many chem tutorials as I do or who even studies as much as I do for that stuff.  I deserve way over a 70% in both things and sometimes it kinda bothers me cause well I KNOW that I have done my best but sometimes I wish my "best" were better.  I want to make honours more than anything and if I don't yeah I think I probably will cry.  I deserve to be on at least honours - I deserve it.  I have worked so hard to this point and it would be disappointing to see all my efforts and hard work go to waste.  I guess I should stop worrying so much about it right now though cause interm/mid reports and TAPS are not till ike mid November I think and from now til then I am gonna have to keep working hard and putting in the effort.  And well in the morning I told my TA *ALL* about what I thought of the schedule and stuff and we were getting into like a little bit more detailed conversation than she asked me if I was eating properly.  And well like EXCUSE ME but like that is my business and stuff.  Besides I don't skip many meals during school anyways and really should should stay out of stuff like that.  Besides I have been eating junk lately cause I have been worried about Chem and Math.  Today at lunch I hate 2 of those mini-chocolate bars and then my mom bought me two cookies from Tim Hortons.  I don't want to gain weight I see all the others girls so thin, I want to be like them and look like them, and yeah don't get me wrong I would like to also wear a size 2 but well I would be happy with size 5 cause I have giant bones so I don't think size 2 is realistic.  And chels man I am getting sick of her.  I hate to say it but it is SOOOOO true.  She is becoming self-centered and like she is always like "Everyone always comes to ME, Me, Me" and "When they need to talk they come to me" and blah blah blah.  I can't take it anymore!!! ARGGGG!  I am sick of hearing her complain and work, and chem, and people, and all the other shit.  I mean I complain too but not nearly as much as her and she is always in a bad mood, I hate it!  Eric is starting to get fed up too.  We are all annoyed.  She was my best friend and on a certain level still is a "friend" but we are not friends like we used to be.  It is her who has changed, certainly NOT me!!!  Everyone has noticed it too, and it is not only me...it is EVERYONE!!!  I feel like I have grown up while she is still stuck in her whatever-you-want-to-call-it-but-it-seems-like-she-is-so-imature-and-annoying-and-whatever Land.  So yeah there are alot of things going on right now and yeah some good and some bad.  I suppose I am still pretty happy though cause well I raise my chem mark a bit, but still a little worried about math.  I suppose it isn't the end of the world.  I am happy and worried...I don't know if that is a good thing or a bad thing.  I should probably go eat my dinner now but I am not really too hungry but I want to eat anyways.

      Today yeah was good I guess besides my compulsive impulse to eat junk.  But I kinda resisted and got some pizza and an apple for lunch which I guess is not too bad when I think about it, that is not too junky or calorie loaded.  I am not too sure how the Chem test went cause somethings I really knew and other things I wasn't too sure and could not remember but I really need a good mark in that stuff.  And well since today was Wednesday and there are no Science tutorials I didn't go to any tutorial cause I wanted a *real* lunch so yeah it was nice to have *real* lunch and actually have a good *talk* with others.  Matt mentioned to me how he thought I was attractive and how alot of the other guys I know think I am attractive too.  That makes me feel pretty good and well I think I help Travis feel alot better today too.  He was really upset and disappointed in himself cause he cheated on one of his tests and stuff, and he feels really bad about it and does not even know why he did it.  I tried to make him realize it is not the end of the world, and people do make mistakes and things like that do happen and it is reality.  I think I helped him feel a bit better though cause I just cared and stuff so I feel good about that.  I gotta go eat my dinner now then I got a big math test tommorow and I need to be well prepared cause I want to boost my average.  I have been working hard enough that I really do feel like deserve it, I deserve for my Chem average and my Math average to both go up.  I always go to tutorial and get help when I need it and stuff, but well today I took a break during tutorial.  I need to re-energize myself somehow and sometimes we just need to talk to others and have a good lunch with others.

      Again today was yeah...pretty good.  Well besides the morning.  I woke up crying because I had a dream about drivers ed and driving and well that is kinda what I am avoiding.  After drivers ed the lady I well didn't like very much and well I am not too good at driving.  Everyone is always talking about "Oh I want to drive" and "oh driving is so easy."  Well it bothers me cause I find it really difficult to learn how to drive and well I feel the pressure to drive, and get my license and stuff.  I feel pressure but I know deep down that is not what I want right now.  Just this morning I did not want to wake up thinking about that stuff but I did, dumb dreams.  I guess they really are a reflection of the conscience.  Oh and Travis asked me today if I wanted to do something friday so of course I told him sure.  I mean why not try something out.  I have nothing to loose, afterall Alex did not turn out to good.  Well I have to go eat supper and then I have some major studying to do for chem.  I need to boost the average and I know that I can do this test.  Note to self: You can do it Vanessa!  You can do anything!

      Today was a good day.  I talked to people and yeah they talked back.  I was happy.  I smiled.  CALM was even fun, me and Andrew talked alot [yeah so me and Andrew went on like one date and that went bad but yeah we are still good friends]  I even for the most part understood my math except for a few questions in the homework which my calc. was being a pain and would not calculte my decimals numbers to fractions.  I even found out Travis kind of likes me and then later and and Chester had one of our "friend" talks although Lenny seems to claim that I was like "trying to pick him up" LOL [that makes me laugh so hard] I have always sorta had this thing for chester but I think we make better friends ya know.  We are just those kind of people.  And well hmmm not sure how the Chem is going now, sometimes it is good, sometimes bad, sometimes just ok.  It's like being on a big roller coaster with all the chem students [I can actually picture that] and like I have people asking ME [yeah me...haha...this is when you laugh] and they were asking Me how to do things.  Ok...ya so I am not the only one who does not understand so I don't feel so bad.  I wish I would have not gone onto the U-courses sight tonight though to check my chem mark.  Down 1% from before [and yeah it may not be a big deal to anyone else but that 1% does happen to be a big deal to me] it was my worst mark and still is.  I HAD  67 but now I have a 66, but I just don't get it - like I am trying and all, going to tutorials, and putting in all my freaking effort, I just don't get WHY WHY WHY chem is not going well.  I feel like I work hard enough and study enough that I really do deserve an 80, of course in a perfect world I probably would get an 80.  Now I really have to think hard though.  I want my dream of being a science teacher more than anything [since I HATE chem now I would probably major in Bio] but well I don't think I could drop chem, besides I am way too far now and all that work for nothing...I don't think so.  I have to pass.  Just keep reassuring myself that I can DO ANYTHING, but it's hard.  I have to ace that unit test on Wednesday, at least get over 70 so my ave. should go up a bit, and over 70 is not an unrealistic goal.  I studied lots on the weekend and will do alot more tommorow night, tonight I just practiced the problems and stuff and worked out the math stuff from this unit.  Yeah well I am pretty happy besides chem, that is the only thing that is really dragging my down right now and upsetting a little part of me.  I will keep working at it though.  I suppose that is all I can do right now.

      Ya so I fisished my book.  The end was the absolute best!!!  I want to read another book (scary thought - can't believe I just said that)  And yeah I feel good today again.  I went to church and well the feeling afterwards I love.  I think a good ole conversation with God was just what I needed.  And well when I got home from church I practiced my math for a while then had an apple (yummmm, I think I am addicted to fruit) [Scary thought when I realize fruit is actually healthy] and well yeah now I am back on my comp cause everyone works sundays and like there is never time to do anything.  I'm like sunlight deprived or something and well yeah walking hope from church it was nice with the sun rays just bouncing off my face.  Kinda weird actually the sun put me in a better mood.   The chem teacher told us we might have a quiz monday (even though we just have one of Friday) so yeah I hope she decides not to have it.  Cause well lets see all the things I have crammed into my head: Chem, Math, Social, What I am making for dinner, how good my book was, friends, influences, Tv shows, lets see TOO MUCH!!!!  GRRRR and I just got one of those sales call things: this is sears blah blah blah survery.  Like K I don't want to hear that!! - It should be like a law that only people that know you or are your friends can call!  And yeah when I was practicing my math I realized that uhh I think I understand most of the stuff in this unit!!!  For once I understand alot of something that was really hard to learn, oh how proud of myself I am right now.  Now I just have to get that mark I need on the unit test thurs and boost my math mark.  I have a 70 right now but the way I work and effort I put in I feel it should at least be an 80 so yeah I'm gonna try get that 80 I deserve.  As for chem, well all I can really do is study like usually and practice, practice, practice those calculation problem things still my head hurts and til I WILL get them right 100% of the time.  I think I CAN do good on this unit, but it's REALLY HARD to understand and yeah alot of times it is very frustrating and I honestly HATE crying over dumb stuff like that all the time.  But well I NEED chem for university so I am just gonna have to suck it up, get through the year, and I try to understand and do my best.  And well I am planning to get Chem over and done with doing summer school when it rolls around again.  If I do chem 30 during the summer that means no Chem during the regular school year [yeah I sure would like the idea of that wouldn't I]  I think the next Joe Millionaire starts tommorow.  Oh how excited I am - makes me want to jump up and down.  Of course if I was a kid that would be ok, but yeah I am think people would start to stare at like an older perosn.  And well I want it to be like almost Halloween.  I CAN'T wait for Megans party!!!!  Like seriously we are gonna have a big sleepover with lotsa people and I CAN'T wait!!!  Megz is like one of my close friends now(I would call her one of my best friends right now cause chels well hasn't been my "ideal" of a best friend lately) and Megz and I met in Drama last year.  In gr. 9 we both got medals for Drama even though we went to diff. schools.  That is like wicked.  And we all best pals in Drama Queenism forever!!! Lol [she wrote that in my yearbook]  And well mentioning yearbooks I have like closed eye syndrome in like almost all the photos I am in.  The only pics with my eyes open are my portrait one and the ones on the band page.  You know I really hated the thoery in band last year, and well the teacher for band last year doesn't score alot of points in my book, but I kinda miss playing my flute.  Megz wants me to join choir next year and chels always told me too take it.  I can sing and all and people that do hear me like drop cause they love my voice apparently but I dunno I think I will consider it.  I mean besides it would be someing FUN next year [A fun class besides Drama - now we're talkin'] and yeah I think it would be kind of fun.  I am not sure if I wanna do the band thing again cause it's more theory than choir and with my load I think I will need less.  I can't even believe I am in gr. 11 now.  I am like getting old, and I will like serious cry for the longest amount of time when high school is over cause man even though life can be a bitch sometimes and all the times I go through.  School is like my second home.  I love school and ya know what I don't care bout anyone who thinks differently.  Lots of people call me crazy for thinking that but ya know what I got goals, hopes, dreams.  One day I will be at the front of a class and I will be teacher.  Yes, I will cause that is my passion.  The one true thing I have wanted to do since grade 7.  I could not imagine doing anything else, that would be like a sin.  Yeah and I think I am gonna get off my comp now cause it's cold downstairs where my comp is and NO light - I need light, thrive on light now.  I feel really good right now.  Chelsey went away this weekend - no friday with chels.  It felt kinda good though.  Instead of competing with someone else I could be me, people focused on me, talking to me, concerned for me, I am not self centered or anything but it gets annoying when CHELSEY always comes before I even will.  That honestly does both me.  But what the hell I don't need to be worrying about things like that.  If I always worried about things like that then I'd think I would go crazy!!!  [yeah vanessa as if you are not crazy now?]  Well yeah this term in school is really stressful and I do want high school to last but I *CAN'T* wait for next term...ya know what that means...DRAMA DRAMA DRAMA.  I am born to be on stage [now that I think about it teaching a class would be like the same thing] which is a neat realization.  I am a Leo (ROAR - lol)  Ok so that is like the reason I was born in August or something.  Now that I think of it getting into a Drama was not really even my choice, it was an accident, or well it makes more sense to call it "fait" or "destiny."  I still remember at the end of gr. 8 we had to choose options and well I choose the one's I wanted and well never thought about it.  The next year in gr. 9 I got my schdule and was like all pissed off cause I didn't get like any of the options I wanted.  I made me soooo furious and Drama was on my schedule.  At first I didn't really like it, in fact day to day I claimed "I hate this, I hate that" but by the end of the yeah on of my fav. things we had to do was our monologues.  I blew everyone away - literally.  I went first and after that everyone was scared to go up cause no one wanted to follow after me.  After that I don't think I ever recieved so many compliments in my life.  Then I came to a realization and thought "You know what I spent all this time saying I hated Drama, well ya know what I really LOVE drama, it's great."  So then the end of the year rolled around and they were givin out medals for "Top marks" and I got the "Top Drama" one.  It was cool, it still hands with all my medals from soccer in my room [soccer medals is a whole other story - got 14 medals for that] but yeah the Drama medal has my name carved on the back with the year and my grade at the time which was gr. 9.  I thought it was like the best thing even cause even though I have earned like a million soccer medals they don't engrave your name on the back.  And well so then I took Drama in gr 10 and LOVED it so now I am gonna do it till the 30 level and cause of "fait" I met Megz and like expanded my range of friends.  And well my hand hurts now from typing but I didn't realize I had alot of stuff to think about of vent about or get of my chest.  But it feels better.  Things feel better.  I feel better.  Chels better now ruin this mood tommorow - I won't let her.  She always ruins my happiness to make herself happy but not tommorrow.  Not this time.  I am gonna be me, happy me, old me, confident me, the girl I used to know.

      Well I am not like the most happiest person alive right now but I feel better than I did on Thursday.  That like "How's chem going?" conversation thurs at lunch was some kinda miracle cure to my sadness.  On Friday I was worried about my Chem quiz but it certainly went way better than I thought it would.  Oh goodness I just got one of those calls again - you know the ones where they think they got the wrong number but they sound like someone you know.  Man that totally freaks me out and it usually happens when I am at my comp typing around like the same time!!!  I got a call like that once last year, and I could have sworn it sounded like one of my teachers..like way TOOOOOO freaky!  And well the one I just got kinda sounded like my science teacher from last year but it probably wasn't cause well chances of her getting the wrong # and calling me - ok yeah that just would not happen cause chances are too slim.  Man I think she has had to big of an influence on me.  LOL.  But well she is like the BIGGEST role model in the world and I would kill to be like her.  She has the ideal job, two kids, married, smart, pretty....everything I have always wanted.  But well yeah I am sure I will have it all some day too and someone will probably wish to be me.  Anyway yeah I am feeling really happy and good and stuff.  I feel really happy.  That's a change from the norm feeling of grade 11.  Also I am like not a big reader at all but Sarah and Ali both read this book called "Speak" and said it was real good.  And if anyone knows me they know that I would NEVER read any books outside school, I think I started one once or twice but I never finish them.  But I bought this book "speak" on Friday - that's right *I* bought a book (yeah the world might end) LOL and I am already half way throught.  It is SOOO good.  It totally relates to teenage life and like the whole time reading it I was like "Ya this author sure knows what teens go through cause she hit it dead on with just about everything!"  So yeah I want to finish the book soon cause it is sooo good...and I think I wanna read another one after this.  What is wrong with me?!?!?!?!...AHHHHH I am interested in books now..ok that is just way too strange!!!!

      This morning I woke up feeling bad about things and just kinda upset about everything in my life right now.  The social test I thought did go actually pretty good and well I understood most of the math today.  I still haven't told Alex that I am not really interested in him in the way I thought I was.  I don't know how to tell him and I don't want to upset him and well thatt is actually one of the things I am least worried about right now.  After lunch today though I felt a bit better.  My science teacher from last year just stopped to ask how chem is going and I felt for once she understood how I feel about like stuff like chem and stuff.  I don't think anyone really realizes how stressful it can be to try really hard and not be able to understand.  And well I wish I knew why I don't always understand and things are really hard but I guess I will have to keep wondering.  I went to chem tutorial today and got some extra help the equations for boyles law and charles law and well I think the combined formula is pretty easy but I think the ratio thing we did was kinda confusing for me but the chem teacher didn't seem to understand where I was coming from cause she kept saying it was so easy.  She needs to realize that not everyone finds the same thing as easy as others might.  After Mrs. J little short talk with me after lunch though I actually kinda felt better about things.  Strangly enough and well tonight I went home and just took my time to go through my chem before the quiz.  I understand it alot better and I didn't cry tonight, and tonight I actually feel glad to be alive.  Survivor is on at 9 and well I found out today that the Clay Aiken Cd came out!!!!  I love Clay!!!  He is one of my role models so yeah.  Hopefully, after all my studying and hard work I will be able to do good on my Chem quiz and ya know what I believe in myself right now.  I really think that I can be successful and do good.  I feel like my mood has kinda been uplifted and for once I have a real good feeling.  I feel good inside which certainly is a rare feeling that only comes along every now and then.  I feel happy, and glad, and important.  I feel loved, and cherished, and like I can do the things I put my mind to.  Well it certainly is like the opposite of yesterdays feeling but I like it right now.

      Well today at school I didn't really notice if I was happy or upset, I was like emotionless or something.  And well me, chels, eric, and andy all walked to school today cause the buses were all backed up but we got there in half an hour and beat the buses.  But well yeah tonight I just started finishing up my math and well then I got to my chem.  And well the chem teacher seems to think we have no life or something or she must think our lives should be chem cause I just say there starting at like a million questions and she have us like 2 examples and like no offence but I DON'T learn from seeing two examples of something.  But I guess I realized how overwhelmed I am with everything and how stresses I really am.  It was apparent to me tonight because tonight was just different.  I have never felt that way I have felt tonight even.  I was crying on my bed for about half and hour and then well I went to the bathroom to blow my nose and stuff and well I just looked at myself in the mirror and said "I just want to die, I want to kill myself" and then I went through my drawers looking for a fresh razor.  I picked it up and just held in there my wrist.  I don't know why I did this, cause well I have never even come close to even thinking about that stuff and well as I held it there I felt a calmness.  It was strange cause all my fear it was all of a sudden gone, and everything just felt ok.  I can't really explain why I felt that way at the time but well I always cry at night forever and that is when all my sadness and pain really shows, but it never shows for anyone else and sometimes I kinda wish it did.  Things are just getting really bad and more than anything right now I would like to just to talk to someone about things but I don't know how to bring up the subject or how to talk about things in that kind of way, and I don't know who would take my thoughts and feelings serious.

      I don't really know how to describe today.  But lately all I can do is eat and eat.  I am drowning my emotions in food and I gained 3 pounds and like oh God I have to stop like NOW...or I will blink at gain 10 pounds and that CAN'T happen cause in high school every looks at people and judges them non - stop and yeah that includes the way others look and well I like the compliments of how good I look now.  You know it's weird though cause I thought loosing weight would solve everything and make me happier but ya know what is didn't change a thing, not one.  In fact I don't think that was ever the problems it's just I have many problems right now that some way or another I have gotta deal with em' but it's hard.  And my TA didn't help that matter today, lots of the things she says makes me feel bad and makes me feel like I will never amount to anything.  And well she was like "Well do you guys know how hard it is to get into university and she was like and did you know what the average acceptance average for a grade 12 overall is 82% and yeah that sure is high so you odds of getting into University are slim and you sure better get going now to get those marks you guys need"  Like AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH I did NOT need to hear that cause frig it's not fair to people like me or TRY AND TRY AND TRY and just never can get over a certain mark no matter what and like I don't think acceptance into University should be based on only marks I mean cause then they aren't getting the really serious, dedicated, and focused people that know what they want in life that work so hard for it kind of people.  And really it is not fair to only choose the really smart people.  And well yeah she is kinda right though cause I am gonna have to work my ass off to get the marks and I HAVE to get into University.  I could just picture the outcome now if I didn't get in.  Lets just say suicide rates are really gonna go up and stuff and well I couldn't imagine not getting into University, that would like ruin my life forever and it would be like someone crushing my heart with a giant rock.  I could not let that happen.  Well I guess I still have to get through grade 11 and well 12 too but well grrrr why can't I just be finished with this all - I want a husband and kids and stuff and a REAL job...I don't want to go to school anymore.  I want kids more than anything right now - just kids that I love and will love me in return and a husband and stuff to love me too.  I guess one day that will probably come and later I will wish to be back in high school but I would soooooo any day rather have the stresses of adult life than teen life.  Like seriously ANY DAY I know I would choose that over what I feel now.  It will be sad when grad eventually comes and I say good-bye to some people but then I would be just one more step towards my future.  I can't wait right now actually but I have GOTTA STOP EATING!!!  I can like feel my stomach gettin bigger and stuff and well I just wanna be thin like all the other girls - it's not fair.  Of course it seems like nothing in my life is fair right now.  O well, I guess that is just the way things are.

      Well on Sat I went to Calaway with Paige and Thy and we went on the bumber cars 12 times.  That was pretty fun and then when I got home I have a big turkey dinner with my family and with Ben and Melissa...well actually yeah they are family.  We had a lot of fun that night and it was good to see my sister again but when they left they left me feeling really upset.  They were talking about high school and university and stuff.  They were both like "University is really difficult compared to High school and oh if I had to go back to high school I would have like 90's" and well that comment scares me and makes me feel really bad about myself.  If I find high school hard now then how will I find university??...If I find high school stressful now then how stressful will University be??  I am trying my best right now but like they said it is suppose to be "so easy."  So then I just cried when I woke up Sunday morning just lying in my bed wishing I were smart, better, wishing everything could be easier and that everything could just work out.  Wondering why I put so much effort into things and get hardly nothing out.  It feels like are my hard work and effort it for nothing right now.  I was even rethinking my future career choice but I am pretty certain I know what I want to do.  As I went over all the possibilities just NONE of them, not one interests me.  There is only ONE thing that I have mentioned over and over yet I just don't know why things are so hard.  I mean I don't seem very good at any of the Sciences or Math which is kind of related to Science and I can't snap my fingers and made me understand or be good at things.  I just cry over and over thinking about the future and what will happen, thinking if I will even get into University because my marks aren't that great now but it isn't like I don't try.  I DO TRY and that is what hurts me all the more is that I FUCKING TRY AND FUCKING try over and over.  And when I never understand or can never get the marks I feel I deserve I cry even more cause it hurts me.  I want SOOOO BAD for my dreams to come true, more than ANYTHING in the world.  Why are some people just nuturally smart and why am I not one of them?  I am sooooo sick of people always saying "do the work and put in the effort than it will pay off" but it NEVER does NEVER and it is so heart breaking just trying and trying but NEVER being able to do anything as good as others.  It hurts me that I am not good at the things I want to be, and I feel like I have never good at anything.  I wish that someone could just tell me right now where I will be in 10 years from now.  I am confused.  Always questioning if this life is worth living and right for me but certain people, hopes, and dreams keep me here for now.  But no one UNDERSTANDS what I feel or what I go through everyweek.  What goes through my head and what it is like being me.  I wish someone could feel what I am feeling and understand whatever I am going through right now.  And today I listened to the rain pour.  Like some kind of calming after affect of what I am feeling and I watched the drops roll down the window and realized that looking outside I feel as if though I am stading outside in the rain and everything is being washed away.  Everything.  I was so upset yesterday that I cancelled my plans with Alex in the morning and I don't really want to be around him or many people cause I just usually have like this attitude where I have no idea where it comes from but people end up hating me because of it.  And well I don't really like Alex at all, I thought I did at once but God what a mistake and besides I don't need for crap to think about or deal with.  I did go to Erics party through and I met Linkin which kinda cheered me up and I was trying to be happy and well thought I was doing a pretty damn good job but then later me and chels were on the couch and she was like "Nessa what's wrong?  You are not yourself and I can tell you are thinking hard about something" and well I felt that it was kinda odd she would notice something wrong cause we hardly even see each other anymore.  But well I just reassured her everything is fine and well she probably thought I was thinkin about Friday and what happed with Alex and Travis and stuff.  but well she is wrong and yeah I guess only I knwo truly about what I am thinking but I don't feel like talking things through with Chelsey at the moment cause she will just tell me it is silly to feel the way I feel and I will get over it.  I have tried to talk to her about things like this before and well this time I think I am just gonna keep things to myself unless someone other than her asks me about everything.  There is just soooo much crap in my life, and yeah a couple good things but the bad thoughts and feelings out weigh the good anyday.  I just hope tommorow I will wake up without crying and feel a little bit better about things.

          Life at Sixteen  Crying on the inside I don’t know what to do Have to clue of who to turn to I am lost, dazed, and confused  This crazy life is throwing me up And I am falling further on If High school is suppose to be so easy then why does it seem so hard?  To my sister and her fiancé They claim high school is just a joke And reassure me University is where it really starts But I am just so confused right now  Right now everything seems so hard I have no clue of how I will make it through I don’t understand just why things just are And I wish I new why I just don’t seem to get things  Feeling as if though the teachers judge and stare It is like they feel that I am not smart enough Or just something enough, I am lacking something I just don’t know what it is right now  But I was always told to follow my heart And that is what I feel I must do right now But sometimes it’s hard to follow my true feelings Because I know what I want to do and where I want to go  However, I want to teach science, maybe Bio But I need chem. 30 and well 20 is hard And well Physics I can’t really predict how I will do I have to be good at Bio next term I just have too!  If I am not good at Bio, or Physics, or Chem. then how the hell can dreams come true? How can I have a job that I love or pass University? In life what purpose would I serve?  There are so many questions, but not enough answers I wish someone could just tell me my future Cause sometimes I wonder why I am here?  What can I do? I feel as though my efforts just pour down a drain  It feels like I try and I try and I TRY But that is never enough it seems The one thing I want more than anything in this world Is to just understand for once, and have my efforts recognized  And sometimes I think no one really does know ALL the hours I spend studying or doing homework ALL the days and nights I try to figure out Chem. ALL the times I just practice my math over and over  Just hoping that maybe I will get a good mark Maybe all my studying will pay off, but does it? A lot of times I just feel and wonder why do I waste this time studying? I work so hard, but never get to where I want to be  It is always like that, but why does it have to be? I don’t choose to be dumb and all I want to be smart But I feel dumb because I never understand what everyone else does And it is so FRUSTRATING almost all of the time  But no one can make me smart, or make me understand If I could make myself understand I certainly would And I KNOW that it is not from lack of effort Because there is so much effort I put into everything I do  So really I have to explanation to why things are the way they are Certainly an explanation would be nice And maybe I will reach my goals, and live my dreams But I just don’t know right now cause I am so confused about everything  Chelsey and I always seem to argue almost all the time We still have fun together but things are changing now, people are changing And it is hard to talk to her about the things that bother me There is no one really there anymore because she was the only one  I wish sometimes I could just talk to people openly about anything But that is not the way things work even though I wish it were true And I feel as if the ONLY person to care enough about anything is Mrs. J I always felt she cared more than anyone I have ever met  But my mother always calls me annoying, and she might possibly think the same And I don’t think she would want to hear my problems I mean when I think about it there is nothing I can do or anyone else No one can make me smart, or make me understand  It’s like I am stuck in the middle of some feeling so awful To feel like I am never successful at anything And to feel like I never achieve anything that I feel I deserve It is a very heart crushing feeling because I try really hard  And the feeling of love WAS something I thought was great Until I woke up and snapped out of this daze I WAS in I thought I liked Alex but I realize now I can’t stand anything about him and he is not my type  He is the kind that keeps things to himself, but I myself am more extroverted And well I CAN’T stand those army shorts, and army pants They drive me INSANE cause he is obsessed with anything army And I don’t want to upset him but I really don’t like him how I thought I did  That feeling inside of me is a feeling of love But that strong feeling is developing for Travis now The one person I totally never liked, but I know him better now And he is definitely someone that I like  But he has been coming onto Chelsey over the last few days And I know she has a boyfriend but I think he DOESN’T like me And well I guess that is not really one of the big concerns But I guess everything worries me cause I am a teenager  I am only sixteen but with everything there comes stress And sometimes it seems like things are just too much to handle I think sometimes how things would just be different If I just made a choice, one choice that would change things forever  Sometimes I am so certain, but other times I am not so sure This choice is the one of suicide but I don’t want to hurt others around me And my dreams I want to come true, but if they don’t Then I will be crushed forever, and I could not let that happen  And sometimes everything just seems to go wrong All I want sometimes is to be somewhere else, and be happier But even today I was looking through the yearbook and looked at the staff pictures There I saw Mrs. J and I just looked and stared at her picture forever  I thought to myself that I couldn’t hurt this one person that seems to care so much And as I looked at her smiling in that picture I remembered a specific day The day of the social final, the day before the science final and what happened It was when I was walking down the hall upstairs and I wasn’t exactly all too happy  But there she was, and there I was just walking down the hall and I looked up Then our eyes I guess connected and she just smiled and I never felt a feeling like that Cause it made me smile too and the feeling inside I cannot describe From then I knew she does care about me, and would care if I were gone one day  She would probably think I am crazy if I ever told her that I felt like she was an angel But I feel like as if she was sent by God to be in my life right now Honestly I don’t know where I would be if it weren’t for her, she has made a difference All the times I wanted to die, but all the times she stopped to ask how things were going  All the times I just wanted to give up, but she just smiled Sometimes a smile means more than words ever will, and sometimes that is all it takes I realize that words don’t always fix things, or make them better But it is so true that if one person you know cares it can make all the difference  My life is my no means perfect, and I feel as if though I have a lot of things on my plate I mean I have some confusing feelings about love right now And I have many feelings about where I will go in life, and if dreams will come true I guess I can’t forget that there are also great things and people that come into my life  Maybe these are common feelings for teenagers or maybe they are not My feelings are  not really things that can be discussed, which makes it much harder But I feel a lot better now that I have thought about what has been bothering me And maybe this is all normal, maybe this is just life at sixteen  ~Vanessa

      OMG today/tonight was SOOOOO fun!!!  I have a 67% in chem right now and well I thought for a while that I just want everything to end, I just want it to all stop.  But then omg me and chels and travis went to Dairy Queen and he bought us those chocolate utopia things oh man were those things to die for!  Then later that night we went to Llody's and we went roller skating/blading and it was soooo fun.  I got to take my mind away from everything and it felt so good.  Alex bought me a rose and Travis got Chels a rose and Travis bought us some fries and like a million glow sticks.  He also gave us a ride there and back.  The funny thing is though I thought I liked Alex but I felt really uncomfortable with him tonight and well I felt this really kind of strong relationship/connection with Travis and not Alex.  I am still gonna go out with Alex on Sunday but I just don't thing going out with him is right at the moment but I don't really want to offend him.  I am really trying to give him a chance but everything he left when we were roller skating I felt better and more like me and stuff.  I thought tonight Alex was acting kinda like a total idot and well he was sort of embarasing in public.  And well I HATE it how he always were those army pants or shorts and stuff and GRRRRRRRR tonight he wore army shorts.  I HATE those.  I mean clothing and looks aren't a big thing but I mean when someone wears that same friggin thing for even and you ONLY see em wearing like one thing it is like a big turn off.  Like ewww man get some new clothes or something!!!  I just don't feel Alex is right for me like at all....I thing Travis would be way better and I still have had that crush on Chester for like what seems to be five billion years!!!  I said I would go out with Alex on Sunday so I guess I am still doing that but I don't really want to but just this one more date and if I still feel like I don't want to be with Alex then I think I am really gonna have to tell him cause I can't hide the truth and my true feelings!

      I suppose today was pretty good but sometimes I just talk and I talk and whatever I feel comes out.  Then after I realize how negative I was being or some of the mean things I was saying about others and it makes me feel like I am a bad person.  And now I wonder am I a bad person?  I suppose I can never really know the answer.  And well yeah I had the greatest laugh after school today.  My back was turned and this guys comes behind me and is like "hey" so I turn around then I looked him up and down and thought to myself (do I know who you are) then he was like "oh my gosh I am sooooo sorry, it's just you looked like one of my friends from the back"  Man I had the biggest laugh after that but the guy was a cutie and really nice to me, and well I realize that at B.O.B. there probably are alot of awesome and really nice people I just don't know them all. And well I didn't understand the chem lab and well it WAS SO HARD to try figure it out so I went to tutorial to find out how to do some stuff and like the chem teacher I thought was like laughing at me and like for a while she made me want to cry cause she made me feel like I am stupid but I AM REALLY TRYING to understand.  But well after I ended up laughing at myself cause she was like "yeah Vanessa thanks for playing around with this stuff, now I have a really good lesson to teach my students" so then I thought that it was kind of funny and stuff and I realized how much I made her work to help me to understand.  boy I sure make teachers work for their money don't I?!?!  Lol!

      Well this morning chels comes and like I was just talkin to her and she was saying how she really hated the yearbook cover and well I was saying that I really liked it.  And then she totally like spazed out and got like all mad and was like "oh vanessa shut up and stop accusing me" and well I just had my own opinion and she had hers but it seems that the more time I spend with that girl the more of a negative effect it has on me.  Infact I called her miss negative this morning cause she was being miss negative about every damn thing and after a while it starts to really rub off on other people and like I am trying to be happy and positive but she makes things like that so friggin difficult.  So yeah and well I am worried about that 70 in math and well I REALLY studied chem and REALLY knew the stuff but plain and simple - the chem test today I found really difficult but I KNOW that I know my stuff.  I just don't know why I found it hard like applying the knowledge is difficult and half of the questions I didn't know what it was asking.  It was really confusing.  And I am back again to wondering why I am not very good at anything.  Why are some people so good at school and subjects and everything and why NO MATTER HOW HARD I try or HOW MUCH I work on things they are still sooooooooo hard.  I want to know why.  I mean just WHY?!?  I mean I want to be a teacher when I am older but I have never heard of a teacher in my life that struggled through school and in their subjects....because there isn't such a thing.  I wish I had someone to relate to.  And all the teachers I ask if they were good at this or that always say that they ARE good at it or WERE good at it.  Either way they never had any of the difficulty that I am having.  I just wish there were an explanation, it would make me feel better if I just knew WHY..!  Like I didn't really understand how to do the lab write up for the last lab we did and the math word problem things I STILL don't know how to set those things up and it is REALLY FRUSTRATING because I REALLY WANT so bad to understand and just be able to get a right answer.  Honestly if I knew how to do it I would but the fact of the matter is that I don't and I feel like my continous efforts of trying and trying are getting me no where.  I am just falling into a big black hole where all my marks are falling in with me and everything else.  I want an answer to things.  Yes I want and I want and I want right now, but I only want know something.  I just want to know WHY...and forever I will probably always wonder why and wonder why there is no answer.  Why do I have to work at things so much more than others?  Why do I spend countless hours trying to figure out the material and studying something that I usually don't do good on anyways?  Why does everything usually take me longer than others?  Why does it seem like I feel as in I put in 100 times more effort than what I get out?  Just why??..!

      Oh yes what a good day.  It was alright I suppose I mean my overall average for math right now is a 70% and if I get anything below that even I WILL die so yeah I'm makin a promise to myself NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS I *will NOT* get anything below 70 in math from here on in but I have been giving it my all it's just I can't always get the help I need which is really frustrating.  But well I feel the Chem teacher is really trying to help me and I feel like she finally understands that it is not easy for me.  The chem chapter 5 test is tommorrow and I studied for like ever tonight and did a little review on stuff the days before.  I really feel ready for this and all I can say is "bring that chem test on" cause yes I believe in my heart that if I truly believe that I can do good than I can do anything.  That's right...ANYTHING.  and well understanding the concentration of ions was really challenging but I think tonight when I just took a little bit more time to go through things I think I am getting it alot more and everything in this unit has been challenging but I have really been working hard that like right now in this current unit I have improved my marks drastically compared to the first unit.  Things are kind of coming together but well with that 70 in math it worries me a little cause well the whole "I want to make honours thing going through my head."  Honestly I feel I really in my heart deserve it more than anything if only people knew how many hours I spend trying to work through my homework, studying, and even trying to figure out math.  No matter what I know in my heart that I have done my very best and worked my ass off to get where I am.  I'm listening to a great song right now.  It's true and so touching by hilary duff.  It goes like this...     Inner Strength  Gotta find your inner strength If you can't then just throw life away gotta learn to rely on you Beauty, strength, and wisdon too  Your beautiful inside and out Lead a great life without a doubt Don't need a man to make things fair It's more than likely he won't be there  Listen girl gotta know it's true In the end all you've got is you  ~A song by Hilary Duff

      Well ok so I have to admit the math test I did today I don't think I did to good.  But I don't really blame it all on me.  I was TRYING so hard to get help and she kept ignoring me or saying she would help me but always ran out of time and well I went to the math resource room and asked that lady how to do some of the stuff but she didn't make very much sense.  If I don't do very well on the test though maybe it might be a good thing cause then the teacher will realize that I really really really....do NOT understand how to do many of the things and she always says "when I talk to you though it sounds like you know it all."  But well honestly only I am the one who knows myself the best and I think if anyone were to know if I didn't understand something it would be ME!  Today had its pros and today had its cons but really I think there was much more great things that happened.  I got a 14 out of 15 on my chem quiz!!!!!!!!!!!  That is like a 93% and well I did good on something in chem.  I actully did good on almost everything in this new unit after the review one from last year that didn't go over so well.  I have gotten 100's on all my labs for the unit and well and 74% on the first quiz and a 93% on this one - all I need to do now if get a really good mark on the unit test.  And well Mrs. J came up to me and asked how Chem is going which even though I actually don't feel really bad about chem right now its nice to know people do care about others and that she does care about how I am doing in chem or even about how I feel.  She's different from alot of the other teachers, there is just something about her.  I mean my TA would never ask me how things are going like she does and well I think she really has a good understanding of what people feel and go through.  I'm writing a poem right now which is not finished but I want to give it to her at the end of gr. 12, on the last day that I will probably see her for the last time and I just for once at the end of grade 12 to let her know how amazing she really is and how she had touched the lives of people around her and made them feel special and helped them to understand.  So here is what I have so far.     Thank you  People come and people go But you were so special I want you to know I’ve never met anyone so kind and so caring You were different, all that knowledge you were sharing  I still remember one day walking by You gave me a smile instead of a “hi” That feeling inside was something so great A gift that anyone could appreciate  There is just that something special about you You know what to say and you know what to do You helped me with science and with chem too Helped me to deal and helped me to get through  Forever a memory of you will rest in my heart I didn’t think you would be so cool right from the start But wonderful things they come and they go The thing in life is that we never really know  So here is a thank-you to all that you have done You have made such an impact on everyone You are an inspiration, and a role model too There is nothing about you that I would undo   Thank you  ~Vanessa

           One Moment  Wishing just once, wishing for a moment One moment A moment in time we say good-bye to our problems Let them all fall away now Wishing just once, wishing for a moment One moment A moment in time these dreams are alive and flying There won’t be no more crying Here in this life wondering where I’ll go next Stepping onto a pathway, the freeway An I-don’t-know-where-I’m-going day Wishing just once, wishing for a moment One moment A moment in time where friends can be in this line On this calling list to talk to, to help me to just get through To share our secrets and stories This moment, one moment I’m wishing for Here in this life, this crazy life I’m spinning, Not winning, just looking for a place to find Where in time I can find a line, a rope And hang on to that one true dream, this feeling inside of me Wishing just once or twice  Wondering why something can’t just happen over night Wishing for dreams to come alive, friends by my side Wishing just once, wishing for a moment One moment  ~Vanessa      So I went to church today which I love going to cause the feeling I get from it afterwards is really great and it is kinda like a re-energizing thing before monday starts.  And well I spent HOURS and yes I mean HOURS studying for my social and preparing for the long answer and I spent a bit of time on math today but most of saturday I spend reviewing my math for the test tommorow.  I think I will studying a little bit more for the social tonight too cause I just still don't feel ready but well knowing all the time I spend I mean like yeah I probably am ready but last time I got a 75% on the long answer and like I know I am capable of like 90's and stuff and since the M.C. usually ain't my thing I've gotta do good on this.  And well I have to do good in social cause if I want to make honours and gotta have good marks...lol and well I am a little uncertain about math and chem right now but I am sure that everything will come along just fine - it will all be right with time!

I just hope there is not too much stuff on the test monday.  And well my mom is going to apply for a job opening at my school which is the textbook rental assistant which I actually think that would be like sooooo totally cool is she was.  And well I went shopping tonight man that was fun.  I bought a shirt and skirt, new jeans, and purple pants with my left over b-day money from August!  And I fit into a size 10 - I think I am gonna faint!  I used to be like size 14-15 man this is sooooo sweet I was like drowning in the 12's too.  So well I had a little treat tonight I got one of those twisty cones from mcdonalds besides on of those ain't gonna make weight gain happen over night and well I am just makin sure I am balancing the fruit intake w/ the junk intake.  Lol and well man I have sooo much social to do and I still have to finish my long answer question answers before I can memorize em' for the test so that is what I really need to go do now.

          One Thousand  One thousand words, one thousand miles One thousand dreams one thousand times One thousand takes, one thousand lines One thousand hopes one thousand times  ~Vanessa      Well yes today was good except for I felt I dunno really ignored in math and I have no clue when I am going to get help with anything and I wanted to get help but the teacher was busy and grrrr I just don't know who will help me cause I don't understand solving for min/max problems.  I keep thinking about the social test and it is driving me up that wall!!!  but well I am just one of those natural worry people so yeah.  And well Alex asked me out and stuff so we shared a salad and some fries for lunch and well then we disscussed how like we should go out a couple times and see what happens from there.  And well I suppose the Chem test today went pretty good.  I mean I think I did good at least and well I really prepared for that thing so yeah I don't really think there is anymore I could have done.  I feel pretty good right now again.  Chels came to my house for a while then my mom, chels, and I when out to dinner then me and chels went to South Centre to shop and I got some chopsticks for my hair and a new belt - oh it is soooo cool.  And well we invited Ash but she wanted to watch football so like whatever!  I just hope I understand my math a little bit more tommorow when I try to practice the stuff and well I should review my chem, but I have lotsa social studying and stuff cause I think I am gonna write the test on tuesday.

      Wow!  Words can't describe how I feel right now but I feel *happy* yes really great.  I mean Chem is still kind of confusing but tonight I just sat there tonight and worked through it and it makes alot more sense then it did before.  I feel like I really have a good chance of doing good on the quiz tommorow.  And well I got a 70% on my math quiz but I think I could have done better but I guess I will probably get some help with the stuff I don't really understand to much and well that stuff we did today in class I found confusing cause I don't think she did enough examples so I am bit confused but tommorow we have a work class so it is all good.  Everything is great right now I feel so awesome it's like this odd feeling that have come over me.  I feel so calm it's so odd but a nice feeling and I feel so great.  Lol sounds silly doesn't it but I am actually not over worried bout the chem quiz tommorow cause I know I ready for this and I can face what comes in my way and what comes next on this path of mine.

      All that social studying.  Man my head was starting to pound there for a while and well GREAT news....originally it said on my scantron that I got 35% on the M.C. social test well me and the social teacher went over it and like half of the things I put were right now yeah I actually DID pass - thank God he just said it was because he thinks he ran my test through the wrong key so lots of things were wrong when they should have been right.  And well I had the math quiz today and well I am just not too sure how I did.  My mind is kind of like ya know sort of went blank but I mean I know how to do the stuff so I guess I will just have to wait until tommorow to see how I did but I probably did fine because I really prepared for it.  And well I feel pretty good today and yes still confused with chem and all but I am sort of getting it a little bit more and my chem teacher DOES seem like she is trying to help me because I think she can see that I am really making an effort to do good.  And like tonight I was majorly studying for social because after last test I got a 60% on M.C. and a 75% on the written answer but I know in my heart that I could do much better than that.  And well yeah I feel good, I feel happy - there were no fights today and well I talked to other people that I don't usually talk to so much.  And paige invited me to Calaway on the 11th so maybe I'll see if Alex is a ride person cause knowing Paige she wouldn't care who comes she would just think 'the more the better' so yeah that is an idea and I was thinking that maybe one weekend me and him could go during free skate and just hang out and well I can't wait til it snows so we can act like kids and go slidding down the hills and go skating at the rink like 5 minutes from my house and build a gigantic snow man and then when December rolls along we can go to the dance.  Man all the great and fun things I can think of.  I think a little part of my self esteem just took like a major boost.  It feels good, and I want to make it last.  Things have been going a bit better lately and I KNOW on Friday the Chem test will be challenging but in the end I think I have really got to realize that I CAN do things if I believe that sometimes we don't always do as well as we would like but it is not the end of the world and WE DO always get other chances, we have other quizzes, and other tests.  And that is right that one mark or one bad quiz doesn't mean I have to hate myself, or beat myself up over it.  It doesn't have to mean that at all, it can mean that I have made some mistakes along the way.  But mistakes are good, they are learning experiences and even though they may upset us at the time, when I look back on things I realize that the most important life lessons for me have come from the many mistakes I have made in my life time.  And thinking about this now reminds me of all the hard things I have gone through to get where I am now.  Like when I was a kid I don't think anyone even liked me because I wasn't the ideal "thin" like all the others kids and well in gr. 6 it got to the point as bad as when I was seriously considering suicide and I guess no one really does know what things in life have been like and I have been through alot that no one, not even my best friend will even know about.  And well I got through that but then two years ago I was older, wiser, but knew more about things and had a better idea of suicide but there was someone there for me and she always could tell something was wrong even though I thought I kept it hidden so well.  I have to admit man she had some sorta of gift.  Sometimes I don't think teachers realize the difference they can make for people.  Sometimes they can makes the difference of life vs. death and I would say that is a very powerful thing.  That is also one of the reasons why I want to be a teacher because of the difference that I could make too.  So I wrote this poem that has a lot of meaning to me:     All My Life  This is the story of all my life Can I tell you what is was like? It wasn’t easy and it was so hard Take a look at me and see how far I got  Being pushed around day by day Called those names that I dare never say Told I did not matter, it hurt me so bad I had that feeling inside, told me I was sad  Down so deep and feeling alone, all on my own Why wasn’t anyone out there to hold? I wanted happiness but all I had was one plan To take my life and that would be the end  Along came a hero, she walked in the door Held me tight until I hurt no more Told me everything would be just all right She gave me hope for a better life  Now in high school; I’m having the best time Who would of though I would of made it this far There’s a hero out there waiting to help you through And she knows exactly what we all go through  The good and the bad The happy, the sad The joy and the misery That is what all my life has been filled with  When I was all alone, she helped me through I felt unloved, but now I feel the love inside of you Seemed uncared for, and now I’m cared for even more And this is how all my life has been like  Through the halls I pass all the people I know Hear the laugher as I walk the school floors Now I know so much more, things do get better And sometimes all you have to do is wait for that hero  This is the story of all my life Can you feel the pain that I’ve felt all this time It was never easy and it was all so hard But take a look at me; I got so far  And this is the story of a young girl She never really wanted to take her own life All she wanted was to be loved and cared for And this the story of all my life  ~Vanessa

      I was listening to that new Britney Spears Cd.  It kicks some major ass!!!  I haven't bought it yet but I got it off the net in windows media player.  She is awesome.   And well I sorta studied my chem this morning but I did most studying last night but I am going to wait for later tonight to do some more stuff.  I think I am starting to understand the stuff and there are just a couple things that I really can't get the hang of that I should probably ask about on monday before the quiz.  Me and my mom went to our hair dressers house for this open house she was having for all her clients and we had a huge lunch.  And then later tonight my dad is flying back to Vancouver so my parents will be gone and it will actually be QUIET.  So I can actually study alot better.  I need to do good on this chem quiz tommorow.  I NEED to, and of course the unit test coming up is certainly important.  I haven't done the review questions from the end of the chapter yet but I might start on some tonight and well I will probably be done by tommorow night.  If I don't do good on these tests I don't know what I will do.  I don't know what else I can do really.  I'm so scared for the future.  I wish I could understand chem.  If I want to be a Biology Teacher I will probably have to do chem stuff in university and I can't even understand the stuff that is suppose to be easy now.  But that is my dream, I have dreamed days and nights thinking about how much I want to teach something related to science and I am pretty certain it will be biology.  It is my passion, afterall I love science but not when it is frustrating.  Why can't I be good at the things I like?!?!?    Wouldn't it make more sense if God made me talented in the areas I am actually interested in?  I mean everything that has to do with science is LITERALLY my dream, I can picture myself infront of a class teaching too.  I can just "see" it, it is sooo clear.  But I am soooo afraid for the future, I NEED to understand Chem now, if I don't then when will I understand???...I mean I think I am getting a little bit more of the unit now that I have gone through the stuff over the weekend, but lots of times I feel I know the stuff and then I just get soooo confused on the tests and quizzes cause I need know what they want you to do or what they are asking.  I just hoep everything turns out alright.  I hope University still accepts me cause I don't know what my chem mark is going to be.  I am trying to get it higher but I don't think failing all the quizzes is going to raise it by any means.  I just worry soooo much, I wish I could stop.  CHEM, CHEM, CHEM, that is alllllll I can think about.  It's annoying and it ALWAYS on my mind.  I just want to score like at least an 80% on something.  I want a mark that actually reflects my effort for once, I hope that I do good on that quiz on monday and especially good on that test on Wednesday.

      My dad flew in Thursday and yesterday we went out for Chinese.  Then I went to a party and OMG we had sooooooo much fun.  We went sliding down this giant hill that connects to a road so like when you get to the bottom of the hill you just keep sliding down the road, but well you have to be careful not to get hit by a car.  And like this one time when we were going down the hill we were going like REALLY fast and like almost hit this guys garage door.  We keep going from the hill and starting going up the driveway and then we started to scream.  It was soooo funny and fun.  And then we had this big snow fight and me and Ash loaded up this sled and poured it onto Lenny.  And then Lenny jumped on top of me and we like feel over and then we started like rolling down the hill and then when we stopped I landed on top of him.  LOL.  He was like "Wow, that was some good fun but I got crushed by Vanessa's boobs" so yeah I guess they were kind of digging into him but after he admited that he liked it.  What a fun night.  On Friday the CALM carosel was pretty good.  Some speakers were really boring and others were interesting.  Like the lady from Best of Bridge was really good and had an interesting story but when that football player Mark Mcglouchlin (sp...?!?) came is was like sooooo boring.  And the phys. ed teacher there would NOT stop obsessing over him and kept telling us over and over again how many grey cups he was in and how many he won.  The first lady was really boring and I don't even remember where she was from, I think she might have been some sort of career counsellor.  And well the last guy was a student from our school which was pretty good and interesting, and he was funny but he needed a little bit of work on the public speaking.  The carosel thing ended a little bit earlier so I had some time to talk and so I talked to Matt about like me and Travis.  See like Travis always buys me all this nice stuff and pays for like everything and well I like that.  I like when I don't have to spend my own money and everything but like there are soooo many qualities about him that I don't like.  He is sooo not honest, I mean I am NOT stupid and I CAN tell when someone is lying to me.  Especially when I asked him why do you always lie to your parents, and he was like "I never lie, really I never lie, ever" and so I was thinking, ok so if you really never lied to anyone then why last monday would he have told his parents he had school.  That is what he did last Monday.  He told his parents that we did not have school just so his parents would not make him work and he could spend the day with me.  Like that IS a lie.  And he is failing CALM, how in the world does someone fail CALM?!?!?  Like that just really tells me that he takes nothing serious.  He is a LOSER, the big L - O - S - E - R!!!!  I mean he won't graduate if he fails everything.  It makes me think you know, doesn't he have goals...or dreams.  He told me he wants to be a mechanic and well I guess that is alright I mean if it is your passion and stuff but like at least pass high school and get a high school diploma.  I am surprised he hasn't even dropped out.  Me and Travis did make plans to go to the mall on Friday though and well I felt that maybe I will try one more time to spend some time with him but like we have no kind of "connection" and I have felt NOTHING for him so it kind of bothers me that he still sort of comes on to me.  Anyways yeah we were suppose to go to his bank and then go to his house to get the truck and go to the mall but well I decided to go home first cause I wasn't feeling good near the end of the CALM thing and realized it was the stupid T.O.M.  So yeah I went home and met him at the mall and we spend about like half-an-hour in the dumb electronics store.  Like seriously he waists all his money on stupid games for his x-box.  Knowing how much he works and how much he spends, he could have saved up to pay for like University or something but I am guessing that he might not go on to post-secondary education.  It is not that I don't believe in him, it is just how he acts not and the way he is doing in school there is a very slim chance that he would get in.  But yeah we went to the mall anyway but like there is STILL NOTHING THERE.  Like he thought he kind of liked me and I was never really sure I liked him but now that I know him more I don't like who he is.  He doesn't even have a relationship with his parents and can't be open and honest with them.  That is like the most important thing and he does not have it.  He can't tell his parents anything and I KNOW for a fact he lies to them all the time.  I don't care is he claims that he NEVER lies, cause that is pure bullshit.  And well besides I am sure just about everyone has lied about something sometime in their life.  I just don't want to offend him, but I don't even like him as a friend anymore.  He turns me off.  He is not the definition of the kind of friend I want.  And even last week he started to follow me around everywhere.  I mean no offence but like it kind of starts to creep me out when someone starts following me around.  Like on that one friday were I was at my locked and he came up to me and was like "hi" and I was like "how did you find my locker?  Who told you where it was" and he was like "I followed you."  No offence but like I don't want to be followed.  Besides it was afterschool and I just wanted to relax and stuff before I saw him and well nooooooo he shows up at my locker and I didn't even have time to think about things.  I hope he starts to clue into things, but gusy are slow when it comes to things like that.  I don't want to upset him, but I don't like him.  I want an intimate relationship but I KNOW that he IS NOT the one I want it with.  Not at all.  I want to find someone with goals and dreams.  Someone that wants to go to University and does take school seriously.  Someone that I can talk with and have a good time with and doesn't ONLY use money as a way of showing affection.  Money means nothing when it comes to feelings that that.  I want someone who is trustworty, open, and honest and has a good relationship with their parents.  I want someone who is responsible and that is about it.  If I had someone with all those qualities than everything would be perfect but like I have gone through a couple guys already this year which kind of stressed me out and this at the moment is still stressing me out but it makes me realize something.  It makes me realize what I DON'T want in a guy and it makes me more aware of the qualities that I am really looking for.  So far I have not found that yet, but yeah it is not like I am 32 or something, I would start to worry if I was but I only 16 right now.  I have many years ahead of me and there is plenty of time.  Anyways that is like only one of my problems.  My other problem is understanding my Chem.  I would give anything right now, literally ANYTHING just to understand.  I feel bad that I don't really understand some stuff.  I feel it's my fault I don't understand and I wonder if it is my fault.  But I know I am trying to understand and I read over the stuff today and did the practice questions that I could do, but there were others that I am confused about.  I feel bad that I always have to ask "How do I do this and how do I do that."  I feel stupid.  Why can't I ever understand anything on my own?!?  WHY?  And like alot of times I can't do something cause it realates back to Science 10 which I had a really hard time with.  Like I even remember the chem teacher saying "well you should know this from science 10, right" and yeah I agree cause yeah I "should" know it but I struggled with science last year I no matter how hard I tried to understand some of the concepts I just could not grasp some of them, even some that alot of people find very simple.  Since I couldn't understand some of the concepts from last year, obviously I cannot understand some of the Chem this year.  I don't know how to make myself understand all the concepts, if I could not "get it" last year and I can't seem to do it now then what do I do??  I don't know what I can do to understand some of the old concepts I should know and figure out the new ones.  No one understands how hard things are for me.  They just don't.  It's frustrating TRYING AND TRYING.  I failed my lasy chem quiz too.  If I wanted to fail I would have just done nothing but WHY did I have to fail.  I STUDIED, I STUDIED for all of the tests.  I feel like the chem teacher understands a little bit more of what I feel and realizes that I DON'T understand some stuff and she is TRYING to help but I should not keep failing.  Someone who is actually trying to understand the stuff and studies and does all of her homework should not keep failing!!!!  I have another quiz on monday and well I will probably have to go to tutorial though and get help with the stuff that I don't understand because I HAVE to do good.  If my chem average ever drops below a 65% I am not going to be a very happy person.  I want to make honours again come the end of first semester but right now chem is really one of my big concerns but I KNOW in my heart that I am trying my best.  All the times at the beginning of the year where I thought chem was sooo hard that I could never do it or pass the course, I even thought of dropping it and giving up my dream to teach science.  But I didn't drop it, I kept going.  If only anyone knew all the nights I cried cause I didn't understand, and the nights I cried because I got a bad mark.  I have to admit that I have found NOTHING in chem easy and I guess yeah it is suppose to be challeging but I didn't it would be as bad that I would cried like a billion nights in a row and fail more tests than I have ever failed in a course.  Chem really is the first course where I have failed more things that even beofre, so far I have failed four quizzes and usually I don't fail anything at all.  On the odd occasion I might fail maybe once or trice in a course but NEVER have I failed four things in a course.  That is why it is so frustrating.  I know how hard I try and how much effort I put it and hardly even does it seem to pay off.  It's like I am constantly being drainned of my energy and often I wonder for what???  It's hard, I won't deny that.  I am trying, but for someone who wants to do good soooooo bad I sure ain't doing to well.  I am trying to be positive in my thinking for chem but when I reflect on everything it upsets me.  The way I feel about everything it upsetting and how much stuff I have failed in chem is also really upsetting.

      Today I realized that the chem teacher is nice and is not as evil as I once thought she was.  I realized that she CAN actually know and realize what others are feeling, and for onceI felt like she tried to understand where I was coming from.  For once I feel like I told her my honest opinion about how I really feel about her classes and stuff and it feels good to get it all "out there."  I mean I am still confused about alot of the stuff in Chem. but well I felt like she actually was NOT rude at all today and took her time going through the quiz and stuff so I would understand.  And when we were doing the lab she was like "good work girls" and like usually she gives us a lecture about how to "propery" do something but today she just told us we were doing good work.  She is sooooooo much more considerate and much more nice.  Tonight I was doing my homework for Chem. and I was doing those titration calculations/problems and like at first I totally did not think I could do them at all.  But then I thought about what the chem teacher had said, what she basically asked is that "When you see a question that you might think you don't know how to do or confuses you do you panic or get scared?"  When I thought about that, the truthful answer is "yes" and then she was like "Well you can't let that get to you and you have just got to go with what you know and don't let that panic you."  So tonight I looked at this worksheet we got and like freaked and thought I could not do any of the questions, but then I thought about what she had said and well I started just to try doing the questions based on what I knew and stuff and and trying to put all the info together and since she gave us the answers for the questions I could check my work and I actually did do a couple right and there are only a couple questions that I need to ask her about.  I feel that she actually can be really nice, and can actually be really understanding.   I saw a totally different side of her today.

      Ya, 80% on my math test...now that is more like it!!!      I got an 80%...Go me!!!!!!   I deserve it.   I sure hope I did well on that last Chem quiz Friday cause well I got kind of confused on it.  I think during tutorial tommorow I am going to go ask her what I got on that quiz...cause she still hasn't posted the marks and I cannot stop thinking about what I got. This guy today in chem like insulted her teaching.  Someone asked "Why do we have to do this?" and then she was like "Well the students told me that they liked it" and he was like "Well not everyone said that" and then she was like "Well would you rather have me teach" [cause yearh we were using labtops and he was like "Uhhhhh NO!...Like no offence or anything" and then she was like "no offence taken."  She seemed to know that she needs a little improvement on the teaching.  I have to admit though she is getting better.  And well she is alot nicer to me now then she was before, but her teaching is getting there, it is improving.  One of my cats had to be put down today.  He had diabeties and well he went partially blind from the insulin and well then she would just lay on the floor and he wouldn't move or eat and the odd time he got up he couldn't even walk straight.  I had Socks since I was five but well I am glad I don't have to see him suffer anymore so I am not really upset.  I knew it would eventually happen one day so I am just accepting the fact.

      Today was pretty good.  I was actually pretty quiet today.  I didn't feel like talking too much today.  When I got to school and went and got some math help from my math teacher and there were like a couple of us in her room watching some examples.  Socail was pretty good, we all spend the time practicing math and there were other people practicing for the test as well so whatever I didn't get we helped each other out.  Then I had the math test.  Surprisingly I didn't think it went all that bad.  I mean I know that there were some questions that I didn't understand but there were also lots of questions that I totally understood.  I really hope I did good on that.  And well after interviews thurs my TA knew I had some issues with some of the teachers and then in CALM today I don't know how we got to the topic but then she actually told me all the stuff they talked about.  I only asked her to talk to my Chem teacher but I think she talked to my math teacher too.  She said that they said that I doubt myself alot and that sometimes I can do things but I think that I can't do them.  And then she said that they said that I am really hard on myself.  I guess now that I think about it I can be a kind of hard on myself at times, and I guess sometimes I do doubt myself.  I think my TA also mentioned something about structured reviews to like the math and the chem teacher.  I am hoping maybe the Chem teacher will like have a little more structure to her teaching and stuff now that well I think my TA told them that.  Well yestarday well pretty good.  Me and Travis did some stuff together.  We were going to go into his hot tub but then I decided not too because I didn't want to lie to my parents because I can't lie - I hate lying, and well I just knew if we did his parents might come home or something.  So I went over to his house and we played X-Box, GameCube, and Playstation for a couple hours.  Then we went to my house and I made him some lunch, actually a really huge lunch.  We has that spiral KD stuff and then we shared some pizza too.  Then I made us some hot chocolate.  It was really good actually, he said I was a good cook.  Then we played my N-64 and I kicked his ass.  LOL.  Then we talked for like a million hours.  Later that night I watched Joe Millionaire finale which was soooooo sad and happy, and like a million other emotions.  When I was trying to go to sleep I just started crying for about five minutues, but I can't even remember why I was crying.  I think it might have been that I was really stressed out about the math test, that could have been it.

       So I got up early this morning and then I started on my math.  I could do more of the review assignment because it was stuff was early on in the unit but the stuff near the end of the unit is really confusing me.  I am trying to understand it and I want to do good, but it is very hard to be optimistic about the math test since I don't seem to understand the stuff.  My dad can't help me cause he isn't coming to visit until next weekend and my mom knows nothing about math.  Basically I have to figure it out all of my own, and it certainly is not easy.  You know if I had one wish right now it would be to just understand my math.  That is the only thing that I really want at the moment right now.  It is stressing me out.  The more I try to understand the more I realize I don't understand.  The more I practice the more I worry about the math test being hard.  The more I don't understand the more I think that I won't do good on the math test.  I don't want to think negative right now, but it is hard not to.  I need a break right now though just to think about things and all this not understanding math is making me fell bad about myself.  Tonight after supper I will do more math cause during the night it is easier to focus and remember things.  And well yeah I can't wait til' Friday cause my dad comes in from Vancouver on Thursday and that Friday we get to go out for Chinese.  Then Lenny is turning 16 so I will probably go over and visit with him and some other people later that night.  Travis is suppose to call me tonight to make arrangements for tommorow but I will see if he actually calls.  I don't know whether to believe him or not.  He told me he was working until three o'clock today and like I logged on to my msn before 3 to check my email and he was online.  It kind of bothers me that I can't seem to trust him, although I want to trust him.  I feel that something is not right and he is not telling me something.  I don't know if I sould wait to find out what it is or come on to him with a strightforward question asking him what he is not telling me at the moment.   I got this in an email a while ago and saved it because it had meaning to me:     Sometimes people come into your life and you know right away that they were meant to be there, they serve some sort of purpose, teach you a lesson or help figure out who you are or who you want to become.   You never know who these people may be; your roommate, your neighbor, professor, long lost friend, lover or even a complete stranger who, when you lock eyes with them, you know that very moment that they will affect your life in some profound way.   And sometimes things happen to you and at the time they seem horrible, painful and unfair, but in reflection you realize that without overcoming those obstacles you would never have realized your potential, strength, will power of heart.   Everything happens for a reason. Nothing happens by chance or by means of good or bad luck. Illness, injury, love, lost moments or true greatness and sheer stupidity all occur to test the limits of the soul.   Without these small tests, if they be events, illnesses or relationships, life would be like a smooth paved, straight, flat road to nowhere. Safe and comfortable but dull and utterly pointless.   The people you meet who affect your life and successes and downfalls you experience, they are the ones who create who you are. Even the bad experience can be learned from... Those lessons are the hardest and probably the most important ones.   If someone hurts you, betrays you, or breaks your heart... forgive them, for they have helped you learn about trust and the importance of being cautious to whom you open your heart.   If someone loves you, love them back unconditionally, not only because they love you, but because they are teaching you to love and opening your heart and eyes to things you would have never seen or felt without them.   Make every day count. Appreciate every moment and take from it everything that you possibly can, for you may never be able to experience it again. Talk to people you have never talked to before, and actually listen, let yourself fall in love, break free and set your sights high. You can make of your life anything you wish. Create your own life and then go out and live it.   I wish you all the best in your endeavors as well as struggles in life. Have a fighting spirit and never hesitate to get back in the struggle!

      Today was boring really boring.  I wish someone would call me.  No one ever calls me.  Apparently it takes way to much effort to call someone like me I guess.  I finished my CALM stuff today and did my Chem homework.  I finished some of my religion but I am going to have to go early Tuesday to finish my Religion stuff cause I brought home the wrong religion book.  I got distracted by Travis yesterday cause after school he just showed up at my locker.  And well it kinda creeped me out though cause I was like "I thought you didn't know where my locker is" and he was like "Oh I was following you."  Like ok that kind of creeps me out when someone is following me and well since I have Chem when he had Science he was following me again on the same day.  And well I would have finished more Religion if I wasn't dumb and brought home the wrong book but I guess it happens and I will just have to live with that fact.  Tommorow is going to be ALL math.  I set aside ALL of my Sunday just to focus on my math.  I need to figure out what I am doing and PRACTICE, PRACTICE, PRACTICE.  That is all I can really do at the moment and try to understand it cause this unit is REALLY CONFUSING and yeah FRUSTRATING and just about everything else.  All I did today was eat mounds of food like seriously tommorow I am going to have to majorly cut back because well I don't want to gain any weight but everything I thought about how much I don't understand and how I dread the math test I just kept eating the cookies and chocolate.

      Yesterday was pretty good.  Well I missed math basically cause no one had no idea what class to go to first cause they had to be dumb and switch the schedule around.  It was such a short day yesterday - it was great.  Chels and I went to go have some pizza for lunch then we walked back to my house cause the overpass is up no and there is no point waiting for a bus.  I showed her my dress for Winters Eve and well then we sat on my bed for three hours talking while we drank hot chocolate.  Then of course she had to work and well I started on my homework and studying and stuff.  Then later we went to TAPS and well I told my TA all about my true opinions.  My mom was kinda annoyed cause she thought my TA was ignoring her.  I am so glad Chels made honors too cause she really does deserve it.  Chels, Sarah, Monet, Lenny, and I all made honors.  Now we call ourselves the "Charmed" ones - Monet, Chels, Sarah, and Myself.  Lol.  We are all like obsessed with the show charmed which reminds me that I think it is on tonight.  I still have to watch the episode of survivor I taped and the finale of Bachellor that I taped.    Today was ok I guess.  Just ok like one of those days.  It is just that math that is really worrying my right now.  I know she is like trying to help me understand the truth is I DON'T UNDERSTAND.  I have no idea how to do half of the stuff and half of my homework I can't even do.  I am really really REALLY worried.  Tommorom is gonna be dedicated to finishing my religion stuff and well maybe finish my CALM stuff in the evening.  Then Sunday I think I will use the entire day to prepare for math and then I just have like two Chem questions to do.  Monday of course is set aside for Travis cause his parents won't be home so we are going to spend some time in his hot tub.  *I Can't wait*  And yeah I do plan to make out in there and I am sure he is just as eager to do the same thing, but I don't want to take it all the way cause I am not gonna be stupied and get pregnant or anything stupid, but yeah just makeout that is all.  No parents - ALONE...yup that is right we will be all alone.  And well yeah I knew my Chem inside out and well on the quiz I started to confuse myself.  I sure hope that I still did good though because I really studied ALOT for that and I KNOW that I DO KNOW the material.  I need to get my Chem mark up and well my Math mark would be nice to raise but for now I think a realistic goal would be just to maintain it right now.  And well yeah Travis bought me lunch afterschool and stuff and well then he went off to work and I left.  All I have been doing today is eating...chocolate, pop, cookies.  Yeah so I guess it isn't a bad thing to reward myself for doing good is it??!?!...lol.  Yeah as long as I don't gain 5 pounds cause yeah of course my image worries me.  I want to look good of couse.  Guys seem to gravitate towards me now that I am 42 pounds lighter.  So yeah I want to go watch Charmed now and I think Boston Public is on tonight but chances are that it is a repeat.

      Today was pretty good.  Well I still don't really understand my math though, and well even though we get monday off if I don't understand how to do the stuff then how will I have time to prepare for the test properly if I don't know what I am doing.  I really need to do good on a test in math, but how.....HOW HOW HOW...how am I suppose to do good if I don't understand.  You know actually today I felt like she actually wanted to help me.  For once I felt like she actually understood that I really have no idea about what is going on.  I really liked the fact that she actually sat down and took the time to help me instead of how she normally acts when I don't understand something.  Though I feel kind of bad, I don't want to have to keep asking her over and over again "How do I do this, how do I do that" because I think I will drive her up the wall and I feel really bad that I don't understand.  I wish I understood and I am trying to understand.  The Chem lab was really fun and interesting today.  We got to use a molecular model kit and build different bonds that form in a reaction.  We also had a sub today and I guess I was sort of happy.  But well I still have to admit that yesterday was seriously the best lesson she has ever taught.  I get this new unit and I think it is totally my thing.  For once something that I'm good at!  Well the chem quiz is Friday but I usually do a 15-30 min. review everynight of the material so I don't have to cram it but I understand this new Chem unit.  It feels good to understand.

      Ok well today was pretty good.  Well besides the point that I DON'T understand my math that we leart today.  I was kind of freaked out to ask my chem teacher about a couple questions from the homework but I did and she was actually really nice to me.  And well not to mention that we had the most interesting Chem class ever and it wasn't boring at all and I kind of understand the stuff.  Chem was fun today!  Although I was trying to copy down notes and like the over head is my way and same with the teacher and like I think she DOES realize she is in my way but she contines to stand there.  I swear she does that just to tic my off!  LOL.  So yeah that was basically my dad and well today me and Travis actually connected.  We started talking and well it felt right.  I found out he has a hot tub too and well that is like MY BIGGEST romantic fantasy ever - to be in a hot tub with a guy!!!  Wait a minute that will be more like reality soon!!  So yeah that was my day and well I guess I should get going on my homework now.  I was just listening to this song...and I love these lines of it.      Looking back now, it’s so clear to me That you were sent to shape my destiny Because there were times when I was ready to walk away But you gave me strength to face another day  ~Ryan Malcolm (Something more)

      Today I came to school happy and said "Hi" to like a million people.  We had extended TA and I got to see my report card cause my TA had em' and I DID IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I made honors!!!!  I think I am gonna jump up and down now.  LOL!  I worked so hard, I derserve it but I am still worried about if I can still make honors at the end of the entire semester.  I found out my math quiz mark and it was actually kind of bad and well I felt bad at the time and well felt like crying but I didn't thankful and well when I was going through the quiz with her she decided she was actually marking kind of high and gave me a higher mark so I felt a little bit better about that.  I was kinda scared about what I got on the chem test but I got a 61%.  I guess that isn't like amazing but I DID EVERYTHING I could to get that.  I was thinking of maybe to re-write it but I mean I did my very BEST on it to begin with and what I did on that test is my very best.  I hate to think of 61% being my best but only I know how much effort and time went into preparing for that test.  At least I didn't fail cause I know lots of people that did and well I was kind of scared about it cause I failed the two quizzes from that unit.  Hopefully it won't affect my average too much and well I have to keep in mind that there are other quizzes, other tests...more marks that go in for both Chem and Math.  Oh and well I think next term I am going to drop Physics.  The thought of taking physics keeps haunting me and if it is anything like Chem then I don't think I can deal with that.  I want to take Active Living 20 instead because that is what I origionally wanted to take but I did not have to room to fit it into the schedule.  I think I want to do that and I am almost positively certain at this point.  I felt pressure before cause my parents kept wanted me to do Physics and now my mom said "Do what you want" and well I want is to do Active Living.  Yesterday I wateched the game.  YEAH EDMONTON!!  Yeah they won!!  And well I went shopping earlier and got some new jeans and this new sweater and some bras [yeah girls need those] and well I bought my dress for winter Eve.  I looked everywhere but then I walked into this one store and looked at this dress on the manican and I said "That's the one"  It instand captured my attention and when I put it on I don't think I have EVER and I mean EVER looked so damn hot in my life.  All the guys are gonna think I am hot on Winters Eve lol....and the guy I go with man will he be in for a surprise.  I can't wait for that dance!!!  I think I am also gonna get my hair done professionally this year cause last year it didn't turn out the way I wanted it..so yeah.

Oh and I found this funand interesting thing...It was this thing to determine which Finding Nemo character you are most like!!!  LOL.

      I had the math quiz today which I thought I actually may have done good on.  I am pretty sure I understood most of it except maybe like the odd question.  I still am kind of worried about how I did on the chem test cause even though I prepared for it I found it very hard.  Maybe I did good though, I can only pray and well for once the chem teacher didn't give me an evil look.  Usually I am like scared of her cause I always feel like she doesn't like me or something but then after school she was like "Hi Vanessa" and actually had like a non-evil smile on her face.  Chels, Mike, and I all went out for lunch and we had the funniest server guy.  He came up to our table and was like talking in the REALLY FUNNY accent and well we were trying soooo hard not to laugh.  At first I thought he was faking it but then he didn't stop the accent thing but well when we got the bill he stopped doing it.  So yeah I guess he was just playing around with us but it was funny.  Then I went to chapters with them and well was suppose to go to matts but I called ash I told her I was not coming.  I don't care if they are mad at me or whatever cause ultimately what I do is my choice not theirs!  And well I just know someone is going to say something on Monday to me about "Vanessa why didn't you come to Matts" so yeah I'll be expecting it.  I am just kind of relaxing tonight.  I have lots of social stuff to do tommorow but once that is done it will all be good.  I am a little worried about the new stuff in chem though cause I don't understand it really well yet.  I think I am starting to get a hang of the math though.

      I feel like little miss nice Vanessa.  Over the past days I have let Kendra who never even talks to me borrow my lab book and then today I could not say no to Thy.  Then in CALM Stephan kept asking me "how do I do this...how do I do that?" and he kept saying "tell me the answer."  It drove me up the wall and well I feel like all my effort is just being used by other people.  For now on, even if I may come across as rude I really have to learn to say no.  There is a point to cross the line, and there is also a point where the line should not be crossed at all.  The chem test was soooo hard today.  I had confidence though, and I practiced and studied for a million hours.  I even reviewed at lunch time.  I am not too sure how I did but I know that the test sure was hard.  I do deserve a good mark though.  I deserve a very good mark.  If I have to rate myself I would give myself an A+ for effort and working and trying so hard.  I deserve it.   Oh and me and chels almost got hit by a car today.  We were crossing at the cross walk and there were cars stopped for us and like another car went by in the other lane and was speeding I am pretty sure and I suppose they didn't see us or something or they just didn't want to stop.  A car that was stopped honked the horn and me and chels turned around and the car was like right behind us.  Literally like an inch.  What a day!  A close encounter with death kind of, and well it actually made me think that well you never what will happen so we should live life the fullest.

I put so much effort in, I can do it!  It doesn't matter what marks I got on the quizzes in the past...all that matters is the future.  And I am going to make sure I do good on that unit test tommorow in chem!  Yes Vanessa you will do good cause I can do anything.     Anything  You can do anything I believe in myself I am capable of anything I put my mind too Hard work, effort, and dedication I have it all, and I can do anything  ~Vanessa

          Here in this life, stuck in the place Time is racing us to face Challenges ahead, wondering why What or who can help us to get by?  ~Vanessa     Here is a little poem I wrote just now.  I keep thinking about chem.  cause well I want to good on the unit test but I can't just snap my fingers and all my balancing will be amazing and everything will go well.  I can't just make that happen.  I think Ashley knows I am not doing well in chem and on msn she was like well couldn't you be a Social teacher or and English teacher instead of teaching Science.  Yeah k like NO.  I felt kind of bad after she said that though even though I know it wasn't meant to be offending in any way.  I have to follow my heart.  I can't just give up my dream.  I thought about giving it up this morning, but God that would hurt me way to much to give it up.  I when onto the U of C website and looked at all the diff. courses I could do and the things that I could study.  Everything turned me off and just totally disinterested me.  And well I know I am pretty good at Drama and like being on stage and acting but I don't want to do that for the rest of my life.  I want to teach Bio.  Of course now that Chem and Physics are ruled out...yeah I will make sure it is BIO.  But I have to pass chem and I am worried right now.  Then quizzes are only worth about one mark but the unit test is worth about ten.  Either my mark is gonna go up or it is gonna go down.  And I mean I can't get it out of my head now...I mean I FAILED.....FAILED DAMN IT.  I didn't try to fail, that was never my intention.  See that is why I am sooooo confused right now.  How could I want to be a teacher and stuff and love science and stuff but not be good at it?????????....  I would give anything in the world the understand and just get an amazing mark on that next test.

      Today was like really long it felt like and well math...math...math.  Lets just say I am going to be working on math for a very very long time.  It was so confusing for me...not that I wanted it to be.  I felt really bad cause I kept having to ask "how do I do this....how do I do that??"  I think I have a little bit of a better understand now but last time I thought that I just go confused so I don't want to get over confident.  I just hope I can really understand the stuff for the quiz.  I am very afraid of the chem unit test for stoich.  I am really trying but my work is non-reflective of my effort at the moment.  The first quiz of the unit I got a 48% and then today I asked to go over my second quiz and I got 25%.  If I can't pass the quizzes then well that of course makes me worry about the unit test.  I need to do good, but if I am trying for the quizzes and I am not doing well then what will make anything different on the unit test.  All I ever do is practice, practice, practice, but that isn't really paying off at the moment.  Today I actually thought the chem teacher was being nice.  I felt she was actually very polite to me and I think she felt empathy for me cause of how I did on the quiz.  It was actually a nice to change to how I feel she normal acts when I don't seem to understand something.  Everyone kept saying they liked me hair though.  I am not really sure if they were telling the truth or if they were sincere.  I wanted to be different today.  Going for the cute look ya know.  I think I wanna do something to my hair - but there ain't no way I am cutting it again..I HATE short hair...ECK.  Maybe a dark color...with a red through it...yeah that is what I like for winter.  I need a change.  I positive change for once.  Yeah treat myself of something.  Make myself feel loved.       Hmmm I am so gald there is no school tommorow.  I have so much to catch up on and do.  I have the religion test, the chem test, the social test, and the math quiz.  I have way to much on my plate and I thought cutting out extra curricular would be a good thing but I miss it.  I miss being always busy and doing things I like.  Now when I fail at school I feel like I fail at everything cause I don't do hardly anything anymore!  Sigh...there are so many things to worry about when your in high school.  Yesterday night Ben, Melissa, Me, my Mom, my Dad, Grandma, and Uncle had a big turkey dinner.  It literally felt like Chrismas holidays.  Oh and I bought...the Finding Nemo DVD cause I love that movie and it is awesome but my sis took it back to their trailer so I probably won't get it back til the weekend or next time I see her.  Newayz yeah it feels good to get all my thoughts down and clear em from my head right now.  I think I am going to go try to finish my math assignment.  I was looking at all the older pictures and I came across ones from my party and when me and Chels used to be like way better friends.  And well yeah over summer we basically spent our entire lives together, she even put up my patio set with me and we spend like a million days together doing a million things.  When I remember all the great things it's sad to think that we are not as close anymore.  Here is a pic of me and her in August on the day of my birthday at my house and yeah it reminds me of some great times.

      Well Friday was pretty good actually.  I thought math was going to be bad but I asked her a few things and she reassured me I knew what I was doing and stuff.  It made me feel a little bit more confident and I can do a few more things from my assignment now but there is still lots I don't understand.  Luckily me dad flew in from Vancouver last night and so sometime this weekend he is going to have to help me.  He is good at math, very good cause well my mom can't do like any of my math at all.  I am trying not to let too many things get to me though.  I mean when I think about it I always WORRY WORRY WORRY.  But like what is the point about thinking about things of the past, that are over and done with and cah't be changed.  What does worrying about those do...nothing but make me miserable.  So now I am just going to look ahead to future.  What is done is done, but what has not been done yet can always been changed.  So even though I failed a chem quiz and well think I failed the other one....well I failed and that is reality that I have to life with.  On the next test I will just try my very best and that is all I can do.  I already know I put in tons of effort into doing work, trying, and understanding so I guess the rest is left up to fait.  What is meant to happen will happen, and what is not meant to happen will not happen at all.  Well yeah so friday afternoon I picked up a bagel from the Y cafe and ate it on the bus home and then dropped off my stuff and then left again to go to chapters.  Looked at some stuff their for a while and then Alex, Matt, Sarah, Ash, Thy, Travis, Raul, Lenny, and of couse myself all went to see Matrix: Revolutions.  I thought that action was awesome and stuff which is the only reason I go see those cause well I never really understood the whole story line too well.  I didn't want Trinity and Neo to die though but I guess they had to cause it was literally the end.  Actually I really liked the main quote and theme throughout the movie which was "everything that has a beginning has an end."  I like that quote alot because when you think about it, it is soooo true.  And well after the movie I was going to go to South Centre but my mother wanted to wait for a phone call from my dad cause he though he would miss his flight.  The traffic was backed up in Vancouver and well he ran for like well far and JUST like JUST made it on in like the last minute.  And well YAY!!! I finished my religion projects....!!!!  What a relief...I got up at 8 so I could get a head start on em and ya it helped.  Not I actually have some time to spare [yeah like now lol] and well I get to RELAX....now that is word I sure don't hear everyday.  Well company comes tommorow.  My Uncle is flying down from Winniepeg and we are having a big dinner tommorow with my Uncle, Dad, Grandma, Mom, Melissa, and Ben.

      Tonight was awful.  I just don't understand my math no matter how hard I try. I cried for about an hour off and on, and I kept trying over and over again to do the math.  I tried and tried to understand my math but I just don't "get it."  I really wanted to finish at least one math assignment too but I couldn't finish it.  I feel so bad, like I am giving up but that is certainly not the case.  I don't think I am doing too well in chem either.  I don't know what to do.  I know lots of people have difficulties learning in life and stuff but things should not be really diffucult for me like this all my life.  Literally all my life things have been difficult and it makes sense that maybe I do have some sort of learning problem.  People don't seem to think so though, they think there is nothing wrong with me but man if they knew how many times I cry and get frustrated with things and how difficult everything is.  I put so much effort in and get hardly anything out and it is soooo annoying and not fair.  How come I can't get good marks if I put so much effort into trying and trying to understand and doing my homework.  I don't know what is wrong with me but something is...I know it.  I know that things in life should not be this hard or frustrating and they should not have to go through all I have been through.

      Today was uh bad.  Yeah bad.  I did the math test in the morning and I got all confused with the word problem stuff and well I checked on the ucourses sight and I got a 69% which isn't too bad but it could be better.  I guess it wasn't too bad though.  The chem quiz was bad though.  I studied...I practiced...I did my work.  I did the first page fine and then I flipped the quiz over and the second side was like a nightmare in a quiz.  It was awful.  My mind just shut down and I could not figure out how to do some of the stuff.  I felt bad and well yeah I failed my other quiz and the one thing I really did not need right now is to fail another one.  I don't know what to do.  Everything I try to explain to her that I don't understand and I really need help all she tells me is that it is easy for her and says "I don't understand why this is so hard for you."  She makes me feel bad and stupid when I ask her things.  It isn't my fault that I don't understand everything she teachs.  I just don't get it, and even when I did think I understood I failed.  I need to pass chem and well yeah get a good mark.  When universities see that I barely passed chem then I don't think they will even take a second look at me.  I was so down today cause I kept thinking about university and stuff and the future.  I know I have to follow my heart if I want to be happy, but this stage right now isn't the happiest of em' all.  I think I might be one honours though for the half term.  Fingers crossed, I just have to pull off a chem average over 65% which yeah I think I am capable of.  My latest labs I got like 100%, 80%, and like a 93% so that will really help my mark cause the quiz thing certainly yeah did not go over well.  Now that I think of it today wasn't totally bad, I guess it was ok.  I am going to try be a little happier tommorow but the weather is really starting to affect me.  Also Travis kept talking to me about websites and games and stuff.  To be honest it was boring.  I got over that stuff in like grade 8 and like seriously if I could I would tell him "move on man" but that would be rude and I don't want to offend him.  I don't really share too many of the same interests as him but I notice that he is falling for me, and coming on to me, but I am not falling for him.  I am falling for Andrew B.  I remember in gr. 9 we did not really like each other and like went out and it went horrible but he is in my CALM class now.  I always end up talking to him like all the time and it is sooooo natural.  It feels right and he has goals in life and takes school very very seriously.  I like that about him and well I like her personaliy.  He is friendly and easy going and stuff.  I don't know if he feels the same way but I think it might a little bit cause I am getting the signs you know.  I don't want to be rude to Travis though and I don't want to let him know I am not really into him.  He keeps trying to like "get me" over to his house.  I am kinda freaked out about that.  He kepts condums in his pocket and keeps talking about how he wants me to come into the hot tub with him.  Like if he wants "you know" and stuff than I am not the girl for him.  I don't want hurt him though and I think I will still give it a go and do something on Friday with him.  I am afraid that if I tell him that I am not into him the way he likes me than he will go back to not doing his working and cheating on tests.  After I started listening and paying attention he made more of an effort to do work and didn't cheat again on science as I am aware.  See that is what bothers me though.  He isn't as serious, focused or dedicated as I am.  I have goals in life, dreams.  I want to go places, be someone.  For him I can't really say which in a sense is kind of sad.  I guess whatever happens will happens.  I believe in fait and destiny, so whatever will be will be.     You're Most Like The Season Summer ...  Whoa.... Passionate eh ?? Typically you're a fiery, zesty dominant person. As the hottest season, you certainly ooze Sex appeal. You have confidence which draws people to you, and you have the makings of a good leader. However sometimes your exterior is stronger then you are and so you scare people off before they can get close.  Well done... You're the most memorable of seasons :)    urlLink   Which Season Are You?  Take the quiz!

      I hate everything right now.  I hate myself.  I hate my life.  I just hate all of this, just everything.  I can't take it, I can't.  I came home from school and there me and mom go.  Arguing off and on about stupid stuff.  And ARGGGGG she was like "here have a muffin and shut up" and I was like "uh no, why the hell did you have to go and buy muffins anyway" and then like I was gonna eat and she was like "dinner is not ready" and she was like "have on of these" and it was a stupid packaged dinner.  she DOESN'T understand that those ARE NOT in anyways healthy and I told her that I would not eat something that nasty.  And then she was like "well then what the fuck do you want" and ARRGGGGG I can't fuckin take any damn fucking thing right now.  Stupid chem, stupid arguments, stupid everything.  I went onto the ucourses site during social and looked up my chem marks and there was my quiz mark - a 48% a stupid 48%.  A 48 for what...for working my ass off to understand, for trying SOOOOOOOOO damn hard, for trying to actually pass chem.  It is not fair, I hate it.  All my wasted effort and time and for what - a stupid fail mark.  It makes me want to just burst into tears but I haven't have the full out explosion yet, though I am thinking it might come sometime later in the week.  The chem teacher does not understand.  She doesn't understand that the stuff if REALLY HARD for me, I can't help it!!!!!!!   I feel like it is all my fault, like I am stupid or something but obviously that is not the case.  I want to know why everything is so damn hard.  I still wonder if this is normal for people, I mean of course not everyone will understand everything always but I am SO DAMN SICK OF IT.  I am NEVER good at anything, NEVER!  Not when I young, not now when I am older...plain and simple nothing has even been easy.  And you would think I would be used to it all by now but things get harder - way harded and defenetely not easier.  I wish I had answers for things but there are no answers right now, there is just feelings.  These feelings of anger, frustration, and yeah I do feel upset.  I didn't even think I did that bad on the chem quiz - I did all the questions and really put effort it.  How come a stupid 45%...HOW COME????????  What the fuck did I ever do to deserve to be doing to bad in chem.  Oh God it kills me to think that maybe I should give up my dream of ever being a science teacher, and tears come to my eyes.  But what do I do..I don't know what else to do about everything??  I just don't know.  I am so confused and have just about every damn problem in the world right now.  I don't want to say it and I don't want to believe it but I just want to be dead right now.  So much right now actually.  I can't take all this, this life - I still don't know what I am good at and there is nothing that I really excel at.  Other people have their looks, their grades, their talents but what I do have.  I don't know the answer to that, I don't know the damn answer to anything right now.  No one understands how it feels, they just don't understand, and would not be able to understand.

      Today was alright I guess.  It was just the chem teacher that was really bothering me.  I needed help with stuff and so I asked her some questions about the lab and she was like "I don't see why this is so hard for you."  I always get this vibe from her like she underestimates me and thinks I am not as smart as everyone else.  Maybe I am just imagining it, but I really feel strongly that that is how she thinks and feels.  And well then she checked everyones work before they left class and she was like to me "Who did this?" and like I mean yeah Paige helped me a bit but I was the one to do the stuff, and she was like "this is good work" but she didn't belive that I did it.  I felt really bad after that.  I mean that is just an example how she underestimates me and like she thinks I can't do anything apparently.  I am getting frustrated again, I am so sick of trying to hard.  Effort I put in is not paying off.  It feels like all my energy is being wasted, and for what.  My one true dream maybe, it is what I want most.  But I don't know.  I just wish someone had an answer to everything in life.

      Today was good.  Matt came over and helped my with my math.  We worked through those circles booklets together and helped me to understand that stuff a little bit better.  I am still confused about chem but hopefully the teacher will be there tommorow and she can help me during tutorial.  When my mom got home from work (her other job doing demos for cat and dog food) she took matt and I out for dinner.  We went to Swiss Chalet and ate like tons and had dessert and everything.  It was so good but I made him promise me that he would stop me from eathing junk all week.  LOL.

      ^_^ Six hours to finish my social project.  Six friggin hours - like who is soooo getting 100 - I better!!!  I did my chem lab, well what I understood of it but I can't answer the homework questions cause I don't understand what to do.  It is not that I don't want to do my homework, cause I always do homework.  But I feel kind of bad cause I can't really do it.  I think Matt is coming over tommorow and then he is gonna help me with math later cause I don't have a clue of what is going on and the math teacher didn't "teach" the unit so I am confused and she does not seem to understand that not everyone understands.  I think I have a religion project to do but I don't think I really want to work on that this weekend so I will probably do it next weekend as long as it is not due this week but I don't think it is or well if it is I am going to be one busy girl during the week.  Last night was Halloween like ya and it was funny cause my mom was like to some kid "Oh boy you sure look scary" and then he was like "but I am a dog" Lol...She thought he was an abominable snowman.  And then she was like "oh faith day was good" and then like in the night she is like "oh faith day is so boring, I don't like it"  like OMG I can't believe she would say that.  She does not realize how lucky she is cause she gets to go to that.  I can't wait til I am done University and I have a job teaching and then I will get to go.  And well yeah nothing too much this weekend.  I kept thinkin' bout the homework I need to finish but weekends end up being me trying to catch up on everything from the week and I don't ever seem to get a "real" break from things.

      Went shopping lots today and yesterday and got tons of new shirts *THEY ARE NOT NAVY OR WHITE* thank God too cause I am soooo sick of those colors and all my old shirts that aren't navy and white are like 5 sizes too big.  And well I got myself some clicky shoes, I have been wanting them forever.  And well this song/poem just came to me in my mind like about 10 minutes ago so I started writting down what I could hear in my mind.     Fighting the Cold  Out in the cold I’m lost In a reality of wandering Dreams trapped within themselves Stored up on the shelves  I think now is the time To unlock the cupboards Throw away the keys Let your dreams just be  You got to be you You got to be whom you are inside You have to believe That you can succeed Your willpower will override All your fears washed away Forget them for today these dreams are here to stay Follow your heart; don’t do what your told In this life just keep on fighting the cold  You are the only one who knows you know where you want to go If someone comes along one day And tells you to throw your dreams away  Say “hey, do I look like a fool?” They tell you dreams are foolish and you should go away And you say, “don’t tell me where to go or what to do” This is the way that it will be because I believe that  You got to be you You got to be whom you are inside You have to believe That you can succeed Your willpower will override All your fears washed away Forget them for today these dreams are here to stay Follow your heart; don’t do what your told In this life just keep on fighting the cold  The reflection staring back at you Tells your something like dreams can come true If you believe and if you have faith You will get swept to a land far away  Your heart will guide you to the Promised Land Never know if dreaming comes to and end So if you’re in doubt don’t give up on yourself You have to believe that things will work out, and I said  You got to be you You got to be whom you are inside You have to believe That you can succeed Your willpower will override All your fears washed away Forget them for today these dreams are here to stay Follow your heart; don’t do what your told In this life just keep on fighting the cold  ~Vanessa

      Well I got back from Jim's place tonight with this big dinner thing.  Ben and Melissa were there, Doreen and Jim, and Ben's bother pete and his wife Judy, and their two kids were there.  It was pretty fun but when we opened our gifts one of the kids got a puzzle and I kept having to do it over and over again.  Like me and him would finish the puzzle and then he would dumb out the pieces on my lap and start putting it together again.  After he finished it for like the 10th time I said "Why don't you go show mom" but he just continued to dump the pieces on my lap.  After I finally got away me Ben and Melissa played Skip-bo which is like a really fun game.  It was fun and we AGAIN had lots to eat.  Then I just did some Social stuff when I got home and now all I have left to do is my Math but I don't feel like doing that at the moment cause I am on holidays.  Tommorrow I get to go shopping.     ___________________________________________________  I survived the crash, I survived the burn Survived the worst yeah baby but I learned Survied the lies, survived the blues Almost killed me but I survived the truth And when you wrote me off like I was doomed I survived you  ~Clay Aiken ___________________________________________________  Open to New Possibilities  Breathe and let all your worries fall away Just see what a difference it can make Let your mind just drift along today It’s OK and everything’s going to be just fine  Laugh a little and smile once more Walk along until your find that door It’s that one you’ve been searching for Here I can see it opening up for me  Step inside cause you’ve got nothing to hide Don’t be afraid it won’t hurt at all There’s a shinning light blinding me I have found my way and now I can see  Open your eyes and open you heart, I opened my soul right from the start Believe in yourself and belief in your friends It took some time but now the believing never ends  See in your heart and see in your mind That everything will turn out right with time Just open your hands and accept what comes Who knew the surprises of life could be fun  Follow your heart and follow your dreams Don’t turn away because you don’t believe Walk on the grass or walk on the road The choice is yours, go where you want to go  ~Vanessa ___________________________________________________  Somebody There  Tears descend from your eyes Let go of the hurting your concealing Be true to what your feeling There will forever be somebody there  They will seize you when you stumble And hold you to let you know they care When you think your lost and you think it’s over There will forever be somebody there  ~Vanessa

      So we ATE and we ATE and we ATE Today and Yeseday...and the day before.  Ok she so had junk all week.  Yeah I feel my stomach starting to expand actually - kinda scary thought and tommorow I have ANOTHER dinner thing to go to.  Ben and Melissa came over for Christmas Eve and we opened our presents that night and we had like a ginormous dinner.  Like EWWW though, how do people drink Eggnog, that stuff should be like illegal it's so nasty.  They should call it holiday Gagnog instead and whoever came up with the idea with putting dyed fruits in a cake was really messed up.  Fruit and cake don't mix!  So yeah then Ben and Melissa came again today and we had a HUGE breakfeast and ate junk and chocolate ALL day.  I thought my food was going to come up after dinner too.  I didn't realize I was full until after I finished eating.  Actually I felt like I was 5 million times way too full.  Too much food intake.  Too much food and junk intake ALL week.  And I have to eat a huge dinner again tommorrow out in Cochrane at Jim's place (Ben's mother's Boyfriend).  And well I liked all my gifts, but of course my sister was being her fussy little self and always complains about what she gets and stuff.  You would think since she is older she would appreciate things more but whatever.  I am not her and we are two entirely different people so I really shouldn't be on to judge.  Anyways here's the list of the stuff I got for Christmas:          -XBOX -Watch -Hello Kitty charm for my charm bracelet -New Diskman -Blue cord purse from Gap -Clay Aiken CD -Socks cause it's not Christmas without an article of clothing -Lipgloss -Pen with my name on it (lol) -Birthstone Ring -Money -Gift certificates to HMV, The Body Shop, and La Senza -Chocolate and mints -And five extra pounds from all the junk I've been eating          I also updated my portfolio.  I didn't realize I had so many talents.  I didn't really that I AM REALLY SMART, and all this time I didn't pay attention to all the awards I have for like a million different things.  I am talented in the academic area (well I try REALLY hard) but I still call that talent, and I have tons of sports awards, and lots of music stuff too.  I am multi-talented.  I didn't even realize it.  And I totally forgot about the Winter's Eve dance, I don't think I mentioned anything about it in my blog ever.  It was really fun that night and I do think I look sexy in my dress.  I love it, but well since I gained some weight it doesn't look as good on my now but well I am still hot in it.  I don't care what anyone else says cause I like it!  That night was yes VERY fun, but I am way to lazy at the moment to go into the story of that night cause that would probably take about five hours to explain the night.  I don't have the time or patience to write for five hours.

      This strange like song/poem just kind appeared in my head today.  I had the lines "Just when I thought things couldn't get any better, I closed my eyes and you showed up at my door" going through me head.  So then I thought I would try make a poem out of it but I didn't like even think of any of words in it.  They all sort of just "came" to me.  Strange isn't it.     A Feeling  Just when I thought Things couldn’t get any better I closed my eyes and You showed up at my door I thought it’s over But it’s never to late begin On this journey I feel like I am starting to win  Closed my eyes, now I see Took my hand, now I feel Love is something that is real That’s the way it should be Together, just you and me Feel like I am flying above and beyond all the earth I found my wings and now I can breath, I can breath This feeling inside is how I am  suppose to feel, this feeling is real  I never knew that life  could have so many turns, all those bumps in the road I never thought of how someone Can walk into your life And turn your life around I never dreamed before of a life like this A life full or respect for me That is how it is suppose to be I finally see, I finally see A feeling described, a feeling so close Something now, a feeling so real  ~Vanessa     So yesterday I had some people over and we watched Freaky Friday and played Mad Gab for like two hours.  Then we played air hockey and everyone seems to like that.  Then I went to the movie Something's Gotta Give which was absolutely hilarious.  I am almost done my social stuff too!  I feel like so non-stressed right now and that feeling is so amazing.  I feel like the enegizer bunny for once.  My head is clear and I realize that I can have so much more confidence than I think I have.  I can do so many more things that I had though.  I wish we had break earlier because realizing all these things would of really helped me a couple months and well when we get back to school it's pretty hard to raise a mark in two weeks, but anything is possible right!??!?  Tonight Melissa and Ben are coming and we are having a big dinner thing, like usual.  And you know what I am not going to worry about what I eat, life it too short to worry about that.  You know I really came to a realization today because I thought that when I lost weight all my problems would be gone and there would be nothing to worry about.  Like yeah right!  There is more to worry about it feels, and it didn't solve anything.  I am just going to enjoy my holidays and if I do happen to gain weight then it can always be lost again anyways and it's not the end of the world.  I just want to be happy and have fun.  And I am happy right now.

      Today was sooo busy.  Wow, I feel happy.  I forget about my screwed up world for about two weeks.  My postive attitude is coming back, and hell I feel like I have the confidence to do anything right now.  Yesterday I went to see "Elf" with my neighbours and stuff and I think I did something that morning too but I can't remember what it was that I did.  Today I went to Melissa's house and Doreen was there and took us to Fabric Land and Fanny's Fabrics to get some patters cause Melissa is making some runners for the table and wanted some patterns for the window drapes for her and Ben's new house they are getting built.  Then we went to North Hill mall and then Market Mall and it took us like 50 stores and 5 times around the mall for me and Melissa to pick out Mom's Christmas gift.  There were so many people at the mall too.  And then we had to look for dresses for the Wedding because I am the Bride's Maid, but after lunch we were so tired that we didn't look long and didn't really see anything that was the color we were looking for.  So I went back to their trailer her and Ben are living in and Doreen went back to Canmore, then my Mom picked me up and went back to my house.  After dinner the neighbours came over to visit and we had a ton of food.  Tommorow is going to be a long day too.  Chels, Monet, Sarah, and Mike and coming over for a while and later I am going to see "Something's Gotta Give" cause it's cheap Tuesday at the Coliseum.  There is this song by Britney Spears I was listening to and it's soooo good.  It has so much truth to it and the like "And everytime I try to fly I fall" just so describes what I felt for like the entire Semester.  But after holidays I think I can totally get it together again.  I just feel so awesome right now.  I am rested and not tired, and just HAPPY.  That's right - HAPPY!!      Everytime  You notice me And take my hand So why are we In strangers' land And love is strong Why carry on without me  And every time I try to fly I fall Without my wings I feel so small I guess I need you baby And every time I see you in my dreams I see your face, it's haunting me I guess I need you baby, oh  I make believe that you are here Is the only way that I see clear What have I done You seem to move on easy  And every time I try to fly I fall Without my wings I feel so small I guess I need you baby And every time I see you in my dreams I see your face, it's haunting me I guess I need you baby  I may have made it rain Please forgive me My weakness caused you pain And the sun smiles on me  Oh, at night I pray That soon you'll face will fade away  And every time I try to fly I fall Without my wings I feel so small I guess I need you baby And every time I see you in my dreams I see your face, it's haunting me I guess I need you baby  After all  ~A Song by Britney Spears

      Yesterday was really fun, alot of good, and a little bit of bad.  The moring was really good and well in Math we just watched a movie and during social we got to watch the play done by the drama 30's.  I hope next Semester that the 20's get to do a play cause I would really love to do that, but I can always wait until 30.  Then we had Chem and like she told us to do a lab, Paige and I were like the only people that actually did it.  And well I only got a 30/43 on that Chapter 9 test.  The moring was going so good until Chem.  I love Chem though, I really really like it but I just keep trying and trying and I seem to be no good at it.  Our teacher always praises the people who score like really high marks on the test, especially Ashley and now Stephan.  It makes me feel kind of bad and it really bothers me because it feels like the only thing that matters to her is high marks and if your smart or not.  You know I feel like I have worked just as hard if not harder than any of those people, but no one comes up to me and says "good job Vanessa."  I wish the Chem teacher could understand for once, I don't think she ever experienced "not doing good when she put in a lot of effort" cause she does seem really smart.  But I wish she could understand and just know what it feels like sometimes for things to be very hard and not come easy.  Anyways getting off the topic of Chem cause it's starting to upset me now.  After that we had CALM and like she didn't even care if we left of stayed so I stayed for half the class.   Then I just left afterward and well got a ride in Sarah's car and we went to A&W for lunch and then we went to chapters for a while.  Then we got in line for Lord of the Rings cause we had pre-bought our tickets.  That movie was so good!  I hated the first two movies for it though, but I liked this one because it had alot of personal discovery and reflection within each character, but they had like five different endings for it but it was really good.  Then we drove to Boston Pizza and got dinner and exchanged our secret santa gifts with everyone.  Then I went back to my house and got Mat's gift and then went to his house.  We exchanged gifts and he got me like these different scents for your body from the body shop and a whole bunch of Vanilla stuff cause that is my favourite smell.  Then we went outside and went sliding down this hill that was like pure ice.  Lets just say I have LOTS of bruises today and my ribs kind of hurt cause I like got banged into the ice.  I am sure I probably killed a couple brain cells to cause of all the times I banged my head.  Then well Mat's asked me if I wanted to go out, but it was kind of awkward.  To be honest I don't really want to go out with him, but I just told him I wasn't sure.  I don't like to upset people or hurt their feelings.  And Chelsey keeps telling me that I should just trying and experience a relationship but honestly I don't see Mat' in that kind of way.  He is more of a friend and nothing more, that is how I really do want it to be.  Like at the dance we touched each other alot, but after a while he would not stop and then like he woulnd't let me do what I want to do.  He is a control freak.  He probably gets that from Cadets, and that is anothing thing that like he's obsessed with planes and flying and stuff.  It is one thing to be interested in something, but it's dufferent when your obsessed.  Also, I always thought to myself that looks don't matter, but now I realize that no matter how much I say that, they really do right now.  That is why at the dance I could not kiss him.  I didn't want to kiss him.  I don't want my first kiss to be with him, I KNOW that and I AM sure of it.  I just don't know what to tell him but I know sometime I will have to tell him that I don't want to go out.  Then everyone is going to be on my case and telling me to do something different, but whatever.  This time I am not listening to anyone else, not Chels, not anyone around.  I am going to do what I want to do.  And that is the way it is going to be.

      Today was 1000 times better than yesterday, not to mention that our chem class smelt like a farm yesterday cause of some leak.  And well I did good on my re-write, I got 87 but when it's averaged with my old mark it becomes a 75% which still kind of sucks.  And that Titration test I REALLY did my best and I got a 59%.  I do have one more re-write left but if I did my best to understand and do that test then I don't think re-writing will do any good.  My chem average dropped again.  The more I seem to try, the more I seem to try and understand, the more my chem mark just keeps dropping.  I hope I did good on the Chapter 9 test we did today though.  I thought the M.C. was really easy but I got a little confused on some of the long answer questions, but I just pray that it didn't affect my mark too much.  I can't deal with my average dropping AGAIN because I put in alot of effort.    I totally don't get the new math unit.  Everyone is like "it's so easy."  Why can't things be easy for me??  She even said that is was like the easiest unit they saved for last and like finance is NOT my strongest unit, if anything it is my weakest cause I am not good with money related concepts and stuff.  It is NOT easy, although I do wish it were sometimes.  I can't wait until math is over.  It's stressful.  And well I do like Chem, it's very interesting but I have a VERY hard time understanding.  Tommorow is the last day of school before holidays!!  Only one more sleep.  I need a break.  I am stressed out right now.  Although I do have alot of stuff to catch up on over the holidays and I have all that math to try and figure out and understand.  And well I should start reviewing for finals.  Especially my Chem final.  It is going to be like the most important final I have EVER written.  Depending on what I get on it there are two possibilities:  #1:  I make honors #2:  I don't make honors.  And if anyone knows how much I deserve to be on it that would be me.  Because I know how hard I try to understand and I KNOW all the effort I put in.  I want sooooo bad to be on honors because it makes me feel good.  Afterall who wouldn't feel good because of that?

      I don't even feel like writing in my blog right now but I think I need to unleash some of this stress I am feeling.  Today was so stressful.  I have three tests, the math, the chem, and the chem re-write.  I didn't know that I could stuff that much knowledge in my brain at once.  And well I am really worried about how I did on that math test because I just lost my focus and concentration through it.  I wasn't scared or nervous or panicked for a math test for once and I think it kind of had a negative effect.  Kind of strange isn't it?  And well I am not sure how I did on that chem test.  I am sure the re-write went fine but for the actual test I just totally got confused.  I tried to understand stuff though, I really did try and I do feel really bad.  I always ask her over and over how to do things.  I feel like I I probably can get annoying sometimes, and it does may me feel bad because I never seem to understand alot of things.  She was nice today though, very nice.  She is always nice actually, I KNOW that she really did want to help me understand.  She even asked me how the test went, and like she has NEVER done that.  And then she was like "some day you will understand."  I sure hope some day I understand, but well with math I didn't get it ever as a kid and it's still hard, so lets just pray that she is right.  I WON'T give up my dream of teaching Bio no matter how hard I have to work to understand and no matter how things may be for me.

      I can't concentrate right now.  The thoughts in my mind are still stuck on chem.  There is so much to worry about.  I went shopping for Christmas presents this morning and well when I got home I studied for chem for a while but like I said I couldn't concentrate so I am going to wait until later tonight when I can focus more.  I went to Britney's last night.  We haven't seen each other in almost a year and I got my like 4 month be-lated b-day present and we exchanged gifts.  She gave me a $25 gift certificate to South Centre and a $25 gift certificate to A & B Sound so yeah this moring I bought the Britney Spears Cd and I got these two sparkly shirts cause I love things that sparkle.  Ben and Melissa are coming for dinner tonight and I think the last episode of Survivor is on tonight.  I have to study for chem though.  I MUST do good, I NEED to do good, I HAVE to do good.  I hate always trying to hard and stuff and like average keeps dropping.  I want it to go up this time.  I can't even remember a time when my chem average actually went up.  I feel VERY stressed out right now just thinking about things.  Next week is going to be so difficult and stressful, but holidays are almost here.  I just have to hold on a little bit longer.

      I don't really feel like writing anything right now but I do have alot of things to get out right now.  There are so many emotions I am feeling right now and so many things that I keep thinking about.  I just had to go onto that U-courses site and check my marks didn't I?  And there was a stupid 60% that made my waste half-an-hour crying.  I got a 60% on the chem. quiz we did Wedneday and there is NOTHING else I could have done.  I thought I did good, I can't believe I could do that bad.  I seriously thought I got like a 90% and I studied all night and even reviewed at lunch.  Why did I get  60%?????  I TRIED.  I want more than anything to understand and well I did think I understood that quiz.  And well if I thought I understood that quiz and I did bad, well now I am worried about the quiz I did today.  I tried to understand the stuff but I just DON'T UNDERSTAND.  I can't help that fact that I "don't get it."  When I started that quiz my mind just went blank.  I couldn't remember anything, of course it didn't help that I didn't get much sleep because of the dance.  But I even got up early to study and practice my chem.  My marks are NOT from lack of effort, and I do ask her ofter how to do things so my marks in chem aren't bad because I don't ask enough questions because that is not the case.  I don't know why I don't seem to understand.  It's frustrating.  Especially the unit now.  EVERYONE seems to understand the stuff, and I am TRYING to "get it" but I ask and ask and ask about how to do stuff.  And yes she explains it to me but it makes no sense.  I feel really bad that I don't understand her.  I want to understand.  I want to do good.  I just don't know what else to do.  My marks in chem don't reflect my effort and this unit seems to come very easily to everyone.  NOTHING ever comes easily for me.  I feel like no one understand me right now, and if I told them how I feel they just would not understand.  No one understand what it is like to wake up everyday knowing how much effort and time I spend trying to understand my stuff and my marks SUCK.  No one understands what it is like believe that you can do something and just when you think you understand and know it you end up failing another quiz.  No one understands how it feels to fail over and over when I try so hard.    No one understands how frustrated I can get with everything and how difficult things are for me.  I want to understand.  I feel so bad.  I feel like the chem teacher is puting in effort to try help me understand and I just never seem to "get it."  I want to do good in chem.  I need to do good in chem.  I want to major in the Science field and I SUCK at chem.  How would that make anyone else feel.  Image if you tried SOOOOOOOO hard at EVERYTHING and your marks never showed your effort and you failed numerous times but you know you tried really hard.  Just imagine that you had a dream of being a science teacher someday yet some concepts from science you couldn't grasp from the previous year so in the present year it is really difficult.  So difficult just imagine trying to learn a new language but in a limted amout of time.  That's what it feels like - It's like chem is the forign language.  Think about how many times I've tried over and over, how many times I have asked "how do I do this?  How do I do that" and I still don't understand.  Image how many times I have cried because I want to be able to finish my homework and do it correctly but I can't finish or do it correctly because I don't understand.  Just imagine.  For one day if someone could just picture that.  Image that for just one day then multiply it by 365 and then by how old you are.  Yes, EVERYDAY that is what is feels like.  EVERY SINGLE DAY.  I have lost count of all the nights I have cried because I don't understand, all the nights I have cried because I just want to understand, all the nights I have cried because I tried hard and my marks don't show it all all, all the nights I cried because I failed again, all the nights I cried because I never seem to understand, all the nights I have wished to be dead because it feels like too much to handle, all those nights that I wanted to drop chem because of the difficult time I am having with learning and understanding it, all those nights I thought about dropping Chem. but I didn't because I have a dream.  I will NOT give up my dream.  I want MORE THAN ANYTHING in the world just to be a science teacher and to be happy.  That is all.  So if I can make it through high school and do my best in my Sciences, if I can get into University and get through that, and if I can graduate from that, than that is really all I want.  I want also to be happy but it's difficult to feel happy if you are me.  There is so much in this world that I would change if I could.  The first that would be just to make myself UNDERSTAND.  All I want for Christmas is just to UNDERSTAND.  That is all.  The ONLY thing I want right now.  If I could just understand things and make sense of them then I know I could do alot better in a lot of things.  I am so worried about next week.  All the chem tests I have next week.  Just the thought of them stressess me out.  I have *3* tests on Tuesday - THREE.  I have to do the Math test and the Chem test, and the Chem re-write.  That is too much to handle in one day.  I don't know how I will remember everything and well I still don't understand those ICE tables and since Stoich is confusing for me titration calculations I always seem to mess up one way or another.  Then on Thursay and Friday there is the Chapter 9 test and I am very confused and lost when it comes to Chapter 9.  I thought the quiz was hard and that was just a quiz.  If I thought the quiz was hard then the unit test is probably like three times harder.  I HAVE to do good on those tests.  I don't want my average in Chem to drop again.  I am sick of it always dropping.  It seems like the more I try, the more my average just continues to decrease.  It doesn't make any sense does it.  That's why I am SOOOOO confused about what to do.  I feel like I have done EVERYTHING I could, but nothing is helping out my Chem. mark.  I want to make honours for the end of Semester 1 but my hope is slowing fading.  I deserve it and I know that, but if I don't make it I know I will just wonder what all that effort was for.  I guess for my dreams but I AM DOING MY BEST.  I feel though that my marks should be way better, and I think I will always wonder "why can't my marks be better?"  Like what am I doing wrong???  I just don't know and it's frustrating.

      Today was a good day.  I understand my math for the most part and I am pretty sure I did good on that chem. quiz.  And I even got all caught up in religion today.  Today was good.  I am happy today for once.  I feel like I all of a sudden got some confidence back in me today and I really believe that I can do things right now.  Matt and I are going to the dance tommorow.  He is meeting me there though cause he has to go write some important test at Cadet's tommorow but then he is missing the rest to go to the dance.  I can't wait!  I still have to think of something to get him for Christmas but I have no clue what guys like.

      Today was better.  I didn't cry unlike yestday and well it did seem like a very painful lesson to understand that chem stuff but I had to ask about it because I really didn't understand it.  I think I understand the stuff a little bit better now but it's still sort of confusing.  I feel bad that I probably like drove her up the wall today as she tried to make me understand.  I thought I would never get it but I think now just maybe I can do the stuff.  It is hard though, and frustrating when it seems like everyone else can do the stuff.  She was like "oh this is so fun" and "you all understand, great!" and like I didn't understand and like it is pretty hard to think something is fun when you get frustrated when everyone else seems to understand the stuff.  I think chem will get better tommorow though.  I know that I can do good on that quiz tommorow.  I just have to re-gain some of my confidence because after that chapter 8 test I was really hard on myself I have to admit because I really tried my very best and I got a 63%.  I am trying not to worry about it too much but it's hard because I want to still make honours and I still have two re-writes left so I think I want to use it for that chapter 8 test.  I know that I can do better then a 63%, I KNOW that I have the power to get like 80% and I really feel like I deserve and 80% and I earned an 80%, I just don't know why I never seem to get an 80%.  I just pray to God that all my studying will pay off.  Maybe chem can start going good for once, and well if I could understand some more stuff that would be nice.  I always study and stuff but the marks never show it.  I have a 68% average right now in chem and yeah that is what I see when I look online on that U-courses site but in my mind I see an 80%.  I feel like I should have an 80%, I should have an 80%.  I really should but I just want to at least get my chem average to a 70% before the final.       Prayer to God God I ask you to help me get through Chem and help me make honours.  You know how much work I do and how much I study.  You KNOW how much effort I put into everything.  All the effort that goes into trying, and trying to understand.  I pray that tommorow on the quiz I will do good because you truly know how much effort I put into studying for it.  I pray that I score an awesome mark on my re-write and that on those tests next week and the quiz friday in Chem. I understand so I can do good.  I pray for a mark that will reflect my effort for once.  I pray to you to understand my math and just score an amazing mark on the next math test because everyone knows I deserve a good mark, a really really good mark for once and you know it.  I pray for so many things and I do want so many things but if I just understood and had marks that reflected my effort then I would be much happier.

      Today the lesson is chem was interesting but none the less confusing.  I like it better now though since people are doing it independantly our class is now SMALL, that's right a small Chem class [I never thought the day would come]I'm so confused with chem and I don't understand AGAIN.  I am sick of never understanding.  It's frustrating.  Chem is really interesting and I really do like things that are related to science but I don't understand.  EVERYONE else understood today.  Literally EVERYONE.  I hate myself so much right now, if I had one wish right now it would just be to understand.  I listened and tried and everything today, I don't want to not understand it but I just don't.  I am sick of always having to ask her how to do things.  I am sick of always needing extra help.  For once in my life why can't I just understand.  Lenny even tried to help me with my chem in rel. after chem class and like he didn't make any sense.  Eric tried to explain it too.  No one makes any sense!  I NEED to do good in chem, I just want SOOOOOO BADLY to be able to do good.  I have put my heart into chem, being a science teacher is my dream.  I want that so bad.  More than anything else in the world.  But when I see how smart my chem teacher is and all the stuff she knows and understands it makes me wonder how I could ever be as smart as her and know as much, and just understand everything.  How could I ever be a teacher?!?  HOW???  And why don't I ever seem to understand things?!?  **FRUSTRATION**  I cannot emphasize that word.  I feel frustrated with just about everything, it's annoying.  The only things I am good at is CALM and Religion because those are courses that are based on mostly effort rather than being based on actual knowledge.  This brings me back to my original thoughts over the summer.  Maybe I have some sort of learning problem, but when I ask the people that know me really well they just tell me that I am crazy for thinking that.  No one understands though.  I KNOW I AM smart of course, I know that and I know others around me know I have a smart side to me too, but what they don't realize is how difficult it is for me to learn.  I don't work or anything and I have cut out EVERTHING extra curricular just to focus on school.  There is NOTHING I can change to make me do a lot better in chem.  I mean EVERYTHING I work my ass off for, and even then that doesn't mean I will get a good mark.  I put in COUNTLESS hours trying to understand and doing homework and stuff.  I NEVER seem to understand anything, but I want to, I want to understand.  That is all.  Why can't God just make me understand.  I would trade EVERYTHING, EVERYTHING I have in my life and this world just to understand.  ANYTHING.  I would do anything.

      I can't concentrate right now.  I was TRYING to figure out my math.  I wish I could understand.  I was trying to do that trig assignment, the review trig stuff and I can't even remember how to do that.  How sad is that, I can't even do the review.  I can't finish my homework either cause I don't understand it.  It's frustrating.  I want to do so good on that test monday but it's hard to keep the hope that I can do good if I don't understand.  I tried out my chem homework today too, those ICE chart things don't make any sense.  I think she tried to explain them too fast or something.  I mean she sure knew what she was doing, but we don't.  I finished my religion project but now I have to study for dumb social.  I HATE social.  It's stupid and pointless and a waste of my life.  I have better things to do other than stuff about the past.  Why the hell do I need to know anything about that past, it's not like knowing WWI is really going to make some smart person or something.  I should get back to my social.  I keep avoiding it but it has to be done eventually and well I need to try figure out my math but if I don't hand in all my homework on monday I don't want marks taken off.  It's not that fact that I don't want to do my homework, I just don't know how to do it.

      I hate myself right now.  I tried.  I worked hard.  I did EVERYTHING.  I got a stupid 63% on my chem test.  I mean I didn't fail or anything but I really really really tried.  It hurts when you know how much effort you put in and I just don't get anything out of it.  I can't take it.  It hurts and upsets me soooo much.  Thank God I don't have a gun right now, I would have pulled the trigger for sure.  Like I went to tutorials, asked her like a million questions, studied like a million nights, did all my homework....EVERYTHING.  Why can't I do good?!?  I don't get it...I mean what else am I suppose to do??????????  I want to die right now.  I just want to die cause everything I do is never good enough.  Everything I try and so things they just never work out.  How can I suck so much at Chem, WHY?  I dream nights and days of being a science teacher.  How though, just HOW can I do it if I can't even do good in high school chem.  All I could do is cry and wonder about the future and wonder about now.  Will things turn out, I can't give up my dream right now.  I just can't.  If I gave up my dream then I might as well give up my life too.  Some times things just aren't fair are they.  In fact, no damn thing is fair and that makes me sooooo mad.

      Ok so the math teacher actually made an effort to help me today.  She actually like sat down and went through some stuff with me.  It actually helped me to understand some stuff.  She actually made time to help me today and I definetly appriciated that.  There is still lots I don't understand though and I am worried about the test because only *I* truly know what I understand and don't understand.  The lab in chem was actually kind of fun.  I sort of understood it a little bit better than usual but her directions are really confusing cause I hate when she like scribbles little arrows on the board to different thing and like it gets kind of confusing.  But yeah it was fun, and well I did more than usual this lab.  I actually like did stuff instead of just sitting and watching.  It is actually more interesting when you actually like do that lab.  I sort of understand it a little bit better but there is so stuff I sill don't get.  I hope I did good on that chem test on Wednesday.  I will be upset if I did bad.  I have soooo many things to do this weekend.  Tommorow is Friday and usually I am excited but there are soooooooo many things I have to do.  At least I feel better today and my stomach feels alot better.  I didn't have any meat or milk though cause those things don't agree with my stomach.  I didn't eat too much today either.  I lost 4 pounds since yesterday.  That is kind of scary when I think about it, I don't really think that is too healthy loosing weight quite that fast.  Oh and my horoscope today was actually really what I think describes "me" I thought it was really interesting:    There is really no such thing to you right now as 'try.' When you set out to do something, you do it, no questions asked. The weight of the responsibilities you have on your shoulders might cause other people to stagger, but you have enough strength to carry on for as long as you're asked to do so. Your day isn't filled entirely with work-type activities, though. When you do get the chance to play, you play just as hard as you worked. The way you see it, anything worth doing is worth well.

      I don't feel good right now and I didn't feel good last night.  I couldn't even sleep.  I woke up thinking it was about three and like I looked at the clock and it was 1:45 am.  I keep getting like these sharp pains through my stomach.  I didn't even eat breakfast today and for lunch I just had a slushie and well for supper I had some chicken nuggets.  I shouldn't have eaten though.  I started to feel better until I ate supper and put some food in my stomach.  I also threw up this morning but I still went to school.  I didn't want to miss school because I don't need to miss math because I already don't understand it as it is and well I didn't want to miss the chem test.  I am really annoyed with the math teacher right now.  I am not too pleased.  I admit at times she can really help and be nice but I don't understand this certain stuff and I keep telling her I don't get it, but like she keeps ignoring me.  I told her today I was like "I don't really understand this" and she was like "well it takes to long to explain that so I will explain it later."  She never has enough time for anything or anyone.  She doesn't get it.  Like I DON'T understand!!!!  And ignoring the fact that I don't "get it" isn't going to make anything better.

      The math quiz was hard I have to admit.  Since I didn't understand the stuff yesterday it was difficult and well I tried to get some help with the stuff in the resourse room but like every teacher that tries to explain it to me was really confusing.  Tommorow I am going to see how I did on the quiz and hopefully my math teacher will go over more of it.  Chem today was great!  I did good on my quiz.  I got 16/20 which I think is an 80% which is much better than failing like previous times.  I have to study tonight alot but I know that I KNOW this stuff.  I studied soooo much on the weekend, I have to do good.  I believe in myself right now.  I really believe.  I can do it.  The chem teacher was really nice again, ever since I talked to her she has been extremely nice.  I think I ask her way too many qustions though and by the end of the term I will probably have driven her up the wall from "How do I do this...How do I do that?"  LOL.  I guess that is what she is there for.

      Today was actually really good besides the fact that I am very confused in math and well we have the quiz tommorow but I am going to do my best tonight to prepare for tommorow.  The chem teacher was nice again today.  She even like reviewed this stuff that we are doing on the board with me and Thy and like when she was talking about it in class it all make sense because she had explained it to us already.  I think the quiz went really good.  There was one question that I got a little confused by but I did my best to figure it out and I think I will at least get part marks.  I am soooo sick and tired of failing her quizzes and I KNOW that there is no way that I failed this one.  I knew alot, and I know the stuff so yeah I think it went good.  I thought that math teacher was being kind of rude today though.  I mean sometimes she helped me but like I got this sort of vibe from her that like she didn't want to help me cause I think she thought I could figure it out of my own.  I tried tonight though and I am very confused!  I couldn't even finish the assignment cause I got lost on how to do that stuff and it is on the quiz tommorow.  In the morning I might be able to see if I can find an available math teacher and maybe they can help me.  Ususally my math teacher is really nice though, but today she was just kind of "off."

      I felt like the queen of zits this morning.  My face was like swormed and omg I have to get rid of em' before school starts again cause I hate wearing make-up to non-speacial-occasions but if I have to hide my face then I will!  I am breaking out more now on this break then when we had school.  I assume it's from Mat that is really stressing me out.  I feel so good today though.  My sister came and we watched American Wedding which was hilarious and then like I got my hair done.  It's really dark with blonde and red going through it.  It's soooo awesome - I love it!!!

      Things have been crazy.  Last night I had this big argument with Mat on msn that went to 1:00 in the morning, and thank goodness it wasn't in person cause I am sure someone would have been hurt.  I can't talk to him, or look at him, or anything.  I just can't.  After we finally finished our conversation/arguement - which was 28 pages, I just sat alone in my basement and cried as tears poured down my eyes.  I just wanted a HAPPY week off, no tears, no being upset, just a happy week, but NOOOO he had no ruin me just wanting to be happy.  Is it such a crime to want to be happy???  There's no chem, no math, but now there are different problems to deal with.  If it's not one thing, it's always another.  I went to BP for lunch today with Ash and Jesse cause I had to get out because I was feeling really depressed.  After crying during the night I thought everything would be ok in the morning, but that wasn't exactly the case.  I feel alot better now that I listened to my Britney Spears Cd lol, and I went to lunch, and Ash and Jesse came over and we played x-box and air hockey.  I am going to try forgot all the shit mat said about me, cause you know what I am better than all that sh*t that mat called me and said I was.  I am better than people who are so low, they have to insult people, make them feel bad, and put em' down.  I am getting my hair done tommorow!!!  I can't wait!  Change, good change for once.  I haven't had my hair done since August, so YAY!!!  And when I get back to school, I will NOT talk to mat, I can't talk to an asshole like that.  I don't think I can even look at him, I don't want to try and find out.  He thinks he is so much better, well I will show him.  I am going to show all those people who constantly point out flaws and faults and everything that seems to be wrong with me to them.  I am going to show them that I don't need to change anything about me.  Cause I am who I am, that is the way it is.  I am me, that is all I can be.

      When my sis came yesterday we went shopping for a dress for the wedding and I finally have a dress now!  It's the theme color of the wedding of course, that light purple, but a little shade off cause we both agreed that I don't want to match every flower and table piece.  And I even got shoes that I can walk down the eisle without tripping!  They are soooo awesome, and I love them so much I will cry if anything happens to them.  We destroyed like 5 million stores and tried on about 20 thousands pairs of shoes.  Finally, my sister found these ones that were made of ight blue leather and like, with a nice heel that isn't too high and I wont trip, and one the side of my small toes there is this little butterfly thing.  It's so classy, so sexy, and those shoes so say "ME."  Kind of ironic too because the meaning of my name is butterfly.  When I saw them I just said "those are the ones" before I tried em' on, and when I put them on they fit perfectly.  Today I am not really doing anything much.  Relaxing I guess.  I worked hard for exams, and now is my time to relax.  I am also working on my audtion for the play.  I have almost got my monologue down, it's going to be great.  And even f I don't get a part in the play (cross my fingers and work hard and hope I do) then I am sure I wil be busy enough with drama as it is.  Megz and I were talking to the drama teacher and he said that he thinks we might get to do "travelling drama" where we would go to other schools and show them the scene work that we did, or our script work maybe.  I sure hope we get to do that.  Semester 2 is definetly going to be time consuming and hard work.  I think after doing chem though, I feel like I can do anything.  I remember all the times I cried over chem, all the times I wanted to drop Chem.  I was actually reading only posts of mine in my blog and just about everyone second post mentions Chem. lol.  And well I have to go to dentist later, (dentists are evil) but well yeah I haven't been in a year, so at least my teeth will be white instead of yellow.  Something to look forward too.  lol.  I actually really badly want it to be semester 2 right now!  I think I love school a little too much, but yeah I am soooo excited for Bio too, and Drama, Drama, DRAMA!!

      Yesterday night was fun.  Chels, Edi, Andre, and myself all went to glo-bowl.  Then we went back to Edi's house where we stayed there until about 1:00 AM and then he drove us all home.  Yup that was my night.  Chels sure flirted alot with Edi though for having a boyfriend, but whatever it's really none of my business.  So lets just say that when everything goes wrong and everything breaks - that's my house!  Ok so we got a new washer cause our old one sucked ass and well my dad flew in this weekend and he was setting it up and forgot to remove something so like for half an hour it sounded like the house was going to blow up.  It was actually really funny.  Then in the evening we had water pouring into the basement by the comp from like the ceiling.  That's when we discovered that the diswasher was leaking from the bottom so now they have to buy a new dishwasher cause it's already been fixed like 500 000 000 times, we could have had like ten new dishwashers by now.  Then my printer wouldn't work again and we just bought a new one, so there is a problem with the connection between the comp and the printer.  So now we have to buy cord thing that connects the two.  So yeah basically my house is falling apart, not like that is anything new though.  Melissa and Ben are coming later for dinner.  It was Ben's birthday on tuesday, so we invited them for dinner tonight.  We aren't having any cake though because we are all trying to loose weight for the wedding, so no cake.  We will probably just have fruit for dessert, it's way better anyway.

      So I spent all day Thursday at school preparing for the math exam.  I worked through like a million problems with the resource room lady and like went over my finance test with my math teacher.  Looks like practicing for that math test paid off.  I got a 71%!!!  YAY!  That was my goal, just score over 70%.  Last night all I could think about was  YES, I DID GOOD ON MATH , and when I woke up this morning all I could think of was: 71...71...71...I GOT a 71% in math!!!!!  Although I wish I could of done a little better on the Chem final I was looking at my marks and she changed one of my labs that I failed to 100% and it said:  Mark changed to reflect the participation in Bonus Lab.  I just hope my Chem average will be over 70%.  I sure hope.  I know I deserve it.  After the math final yesterday Megan, Erin, and Myself went to Moxie's for lunch and then after Erin left we shared one of those white chocolate brownie desserts: It was after final reward.  LOL.  And then we had to go back to the school so Megz could finish a social test she didn't write, and then we went back to my house.  We both choose our monologues for our audtions for the play and we are soooooo excited for Drama.  Can't wait!  Then my mom made us dinner but we were so full from lunch that we barely ate but by midnight we were pretty hungry but just waited til' the morning to eat breakfast.  And we rented a Midsummer Nights Dream so we watched that, then we watched legally blonde, and on TV we watched Charmed, Jaon of Arcadia, and Third Watch, and then half of My Big Fat Greek Wedding until we we so tired that our eyes hurt from keeping them open for so long.  I had such a fun time.  I didn't sleep much last night for some reason.  It might take a couple days for the stress I have built up over the past week to wear off.  Either it's the stress or maybe it's cause I kept thinking about math last night.  I still can't figure out how I did better on the math, than the Chem.  I thought the long answer on the math final was soooo easy but like the M.C. part was challenging.  And like on the long answer there was this question that I didn't understand at first and I just remembered what she said:  If you get to a question you don't know then skip it and do it last.  When I skipped the question I didn't understand, I didn't loose my confidence through the test.  So this question was stuff during the year I really struggled with, but when I went back I just said to myself: Ok Vanessa you can do this.  I just sat there and I did the question right!!!!  Since it was like you have to set up two equations, and then solve for like what x or y represented I just plugged the values I got for x and y back into one of my two formulas and it gave me what it was suppose to equal.  I am so proud of myself, because all year I struggled with doing those kind of questions, and finally I got it right.      Life's Tug Of War  Life can seem ungrateful and not always kind. Life can pull at your heartstrings and play with your mind. Life can be blissful and happy and free. Life can put beauty in the things that you see. Life can place challenges right at your feet. Life can make good of the hardships that we meet. Life can overwhelm you and make your head spin. Life can reward those determined to win. Life can be hurtful and not always fair. Life can surround you with people who care. Life clearly does offer its ups and its downs. Life's days can bring you both smiles and frowns. Life teaches us to take the good with the bad. Life is a mixture of happy and sad.  So...  Take the life that you have and give it your best. Think positive, be happy let God do the rest. Take the challenges that life has laid at your feet. Take pride and be thankful for each one you meet. To yourself give forgiveness if you stumble and fall. Take each day that is dealt you and give it your all. Take the love that you're given and return it with care. Have faith that when needed it will always be there. Take time to find the beauty in the things that you see. Take life's simple pleasures let them set your heart free. The idea here is simply to even the score.

      It sure is amazing how one day can seem like the greatest day ever, and others just totally suck.  Today is one of those bad days, one of those days that totally suck - except for this morning before the final when the Chem teacher said "Hey Vanessa."  That was the only good thing about today.  I didn't think the chem final was that bad, but well they didn't give us enough time.  I would have liked more time to go back through my answers and go through the questions that confused me.  I felt rushed through half of the test.  I went online - big mistake - and wanted to see if the chem marks were posted and there was my final mark - 68%.  First of all, I KNOW that I DON'T deserve a 68% and secondly why does my effort I put in never pay off?????  WHY?  I feel like I try so hard.  I try, and I try, and I try.  Over and over again I put the effort in, more and more effort, so much effort that I don't think I could do anything more or try harder.  I wanted so bad to do good on the final, I wanted to do good more than alot of things that I have ever wanted in my life.  I TRIED SOOOOOOOOO HARD to get a good mark on it.  Look what happened.  68%.  I suppose it could have been worse, but still that isn't the point.  I can't say I didn't try my best though, because I did.   I TRIED MY VERY BEST .  But I feel bad.  I have a pile of kleenex now after crying so much.  I don't deserve 68%, I just don't.  And to make things worse I somehow only got a dumb 68% on the social final too.  My m.c. wasn't that bad, and I thought that my position paper was 80%-90% work that I did.  Then online is says my mark is 68%.  I am so confused, I just kept staring at the mark wondering how I could have done so bad.  I thought that I would get at least an 80%.  Of course for both Chem and Social I do feel like I deserve an 80% but do I have an 80%...NO.  I certainly worked hard enough to deserve an 80%.  So then why don't I have an 80%?  I feel stupid at the moment.  I mean I don't mind not being "naturally smart" like Ashley P. but it would be nice if my marks actually reflected a little bit of effort for once.  I just pray that I make honors.  I can't deal with not making it.  I am so scared of the math final, and that is going to be a real challenge for me but I have to make honors.  And well going back the whole chem thing, it confused me alot because I want SOOOOO BADLY to be some sort of Bio or Chem teacher when I am older.  But just how could I be???  If I can't do the stuff now, how will I be able to do it for university.  That is what I want sooooo much though.  I WANT IT MORE THAN ANYTHING.  It's my dream, to be a high school teacher is my dream.  And the more effort I put in, and the more I try just leaves me wondering "Maybe effort and trying isn't enough,"  I need to actually be good at this stuff, but in reality I'm just not.  I am not good at anything.  Hmmm Vanessa - name one thing your good at?!?...Funny isn't it, because NOTHING comes to my mind.  This means I have no talent I guess.  I feel like everyone has a place in this world, but where do I come in.  I want to be happy, I want everything to alright.  But I am not happy right now, and I don't feel alright.  I don't feel like everything will be alright either.  Finals are so easy for 99.9% of the population, and you know who falls into the remaining percent that don't find finals easy - ME.  Why does it comes so easily to lots of people, why is it that when other work hard it pays off for them, but not for me?  Just why??  What is wrong with me???  Why do I feel so different from so many people, but so similar to others??  I can't wait til' all this final stuff is over.  I can't deal with the stress anymore.  I'm glad I made plans with Megan on friday after the math final, because at least I have something to look forward to.  I don't even know what I feel anymore.  Of course upset cause of my chem mark, actually really upset, but I guess a little happy too for some reason.  There are so many things I am so confused about.  So many things I wonder about, so many questions, and no answers.

      Matt came over this morning and then we ate breakfast.  Then we did the social test and well it was pretty fun and got the same score on the M.C. and then of course we each wrote our own position paper for the test.  Then I cooked some pizza - the stuff from the box.  Remind me never to eat that stuff from a box again.  The calorie and fat content in that thing was disgusting and I am sure not the most healthiest.  Then we watched some TV - comedy - which was absolutely hilarious.  It was nice to have a good laugh.  I wanted to write in my blog right now for some reason.  I keep avoiding studying right now because I studied so much yesterday.  My head was pounding when I got home yesterday but after I finish writing it's going to be back to studying chem.  I have all the stuff down, and the only thing that really needs some extra practice now is re-arranging the formula.  I sure hope everything goes well.  After the chem final tommorow I am going to do math review because I was going to do some today, but I need to know chem.  Chem comes first in my mind.  I want so bad to make honors though.  It literally means the world to me because of all my effort.  I don't want to screw this up, and I am not going to.  I am going to do good.  Anyways I have to study some more Chem!!

      Today was great.  I am soooo tired right now though.  I got to school around 8:30 and well then around 9:30 did some Chem review for finals and then went to the quiet room in the public library to study more Chem!  Then Chels and I went to wendys and got taco salads then went to Chem in the afternoon.  That was my day!  Chem!  And well the Chem teacher was listening to music and like either I was imagining it, or she was like actually humming to the music.  I had to hold back my laughter cause it was hilarious.  I am like so into chem now and find it really interesting, and I don't want to admit it but I find studying chem fun!  And then chem teacher was like so incredibly nice.  She even told me that I had an awesome work ethic.  That actually made me feel soooooo good.  I always feel like no one realizes how hard I work at things and for things, and for someone to tell me that I have a really good work ethic, well that is an amazing feeling.  I feel alive for once, I feel like I am actually living.  I feel good, awesome, so many things.  I feel like I am on top of the world.  I feel like I can do anything I put my mind to.  I feel like things might just start to go my way a little, and I feel like everything will be ok.

         Inspiration  I woke one morning Then I opened my eyes A flash before my face this feeling that I can't escape A memory that I can't erase I opened my eyes Then it was a new day  She was a inpsiration to me Was everything I wanted to be When I look in her eyes That is when I realize She is everything I have wanted to be Just like an inspiration to me  As I walk down the halls Passing through I can see This is how to live, a life so free Then I stumble upon the ground And I fall, I fall, I fall  Never thought that someone could see All the pain and the hurt inside of me But she always asked me about one class When she saw me it was always of chem she asked  Her career is my dream life as you see I could wish days ands night just to be So special, so rare, so full of care Someone just like her  She was a inpsiration to me Was everything I wanted to be When I look in her eyes That is when I realize She is everything I have wanted to be Just like an inspiration to me  I woke one morning Then I opened my eyes A flash before my face this feeling that I can't escape A memory that I can't erase I opened my eyes Then it was a new day  ~Vanessa

      I am going to be a Chem expert by the end of the weekend.  I was reviewing my chem stuff and like I understand sooooo much stuff in the course now that I have like gone through everything we learned.  It's amazing!  I have a good feeling about the chem final because I really feel like I am REALLY REALLY REALLY getting this stuff.  of course ICE tables still continue to confuse me, but I partially understand them and well not understand the ICE table isn't exactly going to kill my mark.  I feel so good right now - but I am taking a little break right now because my brain will be fried if I don't take study breaks. feel so great and I am happy! :)  "Believe in yourself and you will succeed!"

      Today was good.  Chem just made my day.  I thought I had failed that test and I found out I got 71% which is pretty good from me in Chem.  I am really hoping that my average will go up before the final because it would really help me alot.  Besides I worked hard enough that I really know that I deserve my average to go up.  I am so glad finals will be over soon.  I just want to get them over with, the thought stresses me out but I am going to put EVERYTHING into studying for Chem.  And well actually I already started studying for Chem and did some math review but I am not going to worry too much about math until after I am done with the Chem and Social finals.  After school ended, Sarah, Me, Chels, Mat, Alex, and Lenny all went to Swiss Chalet for lunch and we got soup with chicken and fries, and then pie afterwards.  It was soooo good.  I think starting tommorow though I am going to try eating healthy again, if I could loose 40 pounds once, then the last 20 I want to loose I think is definetly possible.  So yeah - Eat healthy tommorow Vanessa!  Oh and I confess.  I like the Chem teacher.  I know I always complain about chem, and at the beginning of the year I really didn't like the way she teaches.  But you know what, I really think she is really nice and actually really cool.  Although sometimes hard to understand, I really feel like after that day we had a "talk" she has put alot of effort into trying to help me understand and after "talk" I haven't heard her say anything rude to me or anything that would make me feel bad.  She is like different from ANY other teacher that I have EVER had, and I think she has the most coolest and most diverse wardrobe on the face of the planet cause her style is outta this world.  I would kill to like dress like her - I think her fashion style is really cool.  And she owns like 20 million types of high heel shoes.  Especially the ones she wore today when you could see skin, they were classy and I sooooo wanted them. But Mrs. J will always be my most favourite teacher in the entire world and will ALWAYS be number 1 on the list of my favourite teachers, but the chem teacher comes in second place, which in my books is extremely high.

      Today was kinda bad.  Well chem was bad.  I sat there during most of the lab and well I thought that she thought I like was lazy or I just didn't want to do the lab.  The truth is that I just don't understand her directions.  Everytime she explains something it is so confusing.  It's not that I don't want to do the lab, I just never understand the lab.  I never found out what I got on that unit test either, because there was no time, but I really think I did bad and I keep thinking about it.  It's like ALWAYS on my mind.  Social was good today and I think Ali, me, Megz, Erin, Elise, Grant, Kenda, and another guy are going to do Model UN.  Anyways yeah I guess was ok, but Chem was bad.  I thought her demo was interesting, but I felt bad cause I never do anything during labs because I never understand.

      Today was horrible.  It wasn't too bad until that chem test.  I got 72% on the last quiz, but there were just dumb mistakes that I know now how to do correctly.  That chem test today was so stupid.  Half of the stuff we didn't even learn or talk about.  I studied soooooooo hard for that and I am pretty sure I failed.  It upsets me so much.  Its so discouraging when I try and I try and I try and alot of times I fail and I fail and I fail.  It's like the more I try the more I fail.  It doesn't make anysense.  If I do fail that test like I predict then there is DEFINETLY something wrong because I ASKED A MILLION QUESTIONS and I STUDIED MORE HOURS THAN I CAN COUNT ON TWO HANDS and I KNOW FOR A FACT I PUT MY VERY  *BEST* effort forward.  I don't know what to do anymore.  I thought this was the chance to raise my mark, but I think that I was wrong.  I just feel so bad, and I think I really scared my friends or something.  They even said "don't do anything rad...no knifes or razors.  I must have been more upset at school then I remember right now.  But I am really upset.  But I made plans with Megz after the Math final and she is going to sleep over that night too and we are going to prepare our monologues for our the auditions for the play.  I can't wait!  Once I get through finals I get to have fun, but right now I am very concerned about my chem mark.

      Today was good, actually it was great!  I feel so good right now.  I think I did good on the chem quiz but I am not going to get too excited because you never know.  I hate thinking I aced something and then I find out that I didn't.  Today was really good though.  I finished social and religion and I STUDIED alot for chem.  I feel real ready for the test tommorow.  I just know I know this stuff.  I studied and practiced too much to do bad on this.  I KNOW in my mind that I can do good on this.

      Today was alright.  The chem teacher was really nice.  The math teacher kept getting mad at us for talking - but hey we are humans and yeah we like to talk.  In social we watched a movie and in CALM we had a sub.  Interesting day wasn't it?!?  I have another chem quiz tommorow but I feel confident about this one.  Now that I have cried and whinned and complaned about not understanding all my frustration has led me to somehow understand this stuff.  It feels sooooo good to understand and I 84% on the quiz I thought I was going to fail.  I thought I didn't understand, but obviously I do and now I feel like I understandd too!  I just have to keep this up now.  This is my chance to bring up my chem mark.  This is my opportunity.  It's the last week before finals and well I know for sure that I can raise my mark for sure.  I have to make honors.  I worked too hard not to make it.  I have to do good and I really believe that I can do good.

      I have never been so happy and so sad in one day.  Everytime something good happens, something bad happens that always outweights the good things in life.  Again I sit hear crying, thinking to myself that I want to be dead.  Wishing that there were someone here right now, but there isn't right now, and I just continue to cry in the silence of my basement.  I did my really stressful Rel. project today and then I told my mom that we were going out rollerskating and stuff, and that I would be going in the evening.  So Chels friends that she works with at Wendy's picked me up and we went to Eddie's house while he had a shower after work.  Then we played pool for a while until his brother got home.  Then we went off in Eddie's car to Perkins (Which is where Chels and I used to work) and we all got milkshakes with a Cheeseburger and fries.  It was soooo good.  Then we went to Lloyds for a couple of hours.  It was soooooo fun.  And OMG this Eddie guy is like my perfect match.  I never thought he would be sooo awesome.  And well he is a University student at the U of C and is studying to become a electrical engineer.  That's kind of ironic because my sisters fiance has EXACTLY the same profession.  And Eddie looks ALOT like my sisters fiance too.  When me and him held hands it was actually really really really natural unlike alot of other people.  He is soooooo fun, but since we had to drop some people off on the way back we got home around like 12:15 PM but like that isn't that late.  Then my mom was like questioning me when I got home and no offence but:  WHO THE FUCK WANTS TO BE QUESTIONED ABOUT STUFF WHEN THEY GET HOME AND ARE TIRED...hmmmmm....NO ONE!  And then she was like "Oh I was worried, blah, blah, blah, and you never called" and then we got into a huge arguement.  I told her where I was going, and was like "well you never said what time you would be home" and like she NEVER asked me what time I would be home so why the hell would I tell her if she didn't ask.  If she wanted to know so bad she should of asked.  Besides if she can't let go now, she never will be able to.  And then after our argument I told her I would talk to her in the morning and I went downstairs.  Then like half a minute later she followed me downstairs.  What the hell doesn't she understand about: I WILL TELL YOU IN THE MORNING, I WANT TO BE ALONE.  All she said is "I want to talk" and like she wanted to know about what stuff we did.  But I told her I would tell her in the morning.  I am sooo tired right now and have been talking and doing alot of stuff tonight, she doesn't understand that I DON'T WANT TO TALK RIGHT NOW, ACTUALLY MEANS THAT I DON'T WANT TO TALK.  She doesn't understand right now.  Besides I had such a good and fun time, and then I got home and she ruined everything.  Everything just started to turn around and I was feeling alot happier but now she has just put me is some depressed mood and I want to kill myself at the moment.  But that is nothing new.  There is so much to think about, so much to worry about, that honestly I don't need anymore fucking stress.  But obviously I am VERY stressed out right now.  Finals are coming up and those are SOOOOOO important and well I am TRYING to be happy, but that's an extremely hard task at the moment.

      My life sucks right now.  I hate myself at the moment.  I don't think I have ever wished to be dead so many times in a night.  It's all because of the Chem stuff we are doing now.  I just can't get the hang of it.  I want sooooo badly in the world to do good, and well with the quiz tommorow and me not understanding how to do LOTS of the stuff scares me.  I WANT to understand, and I am TRYING to get it, but NO ONE understands how difficult it is for me.  I wonder sometimes if anyone has as much trouble learning everything as I do.  I still don't understand my Chem though and well I was studying and practicing and trying to "get it" but tears just kept pouring out of me for a good hour when I was trying to get my chem.  I DON'T need to fail again, that is the last thing I need right now.  It's starting to set in though that it could be a reality.  If my mark drops again in Chem before the final and if I do bad on the final then it probably is possible to fail.  I CAN'T fail chem.  If I fail my life is literally over.  The rest of my life will be ruined because my dreams for the future all depends on if I pass Chem or not.  I honestly don't want to harm myself or kill myself, but sometimes it feels like a better way out.  To just get away from everything.  No one understands how difficult this stuff is for me - I keep trying to do the stuff and like I just can't seem to understand it and I don't know how to practice something I don't understand.  The chem teacher doesn't understand, no one understands.  I feel horrible right now and I am so scared for that quiz tommorow.  I just feel like I put in sooooooooooo much effort into trying to learn the stuff and it feels like all my effort is just going down a drain.  Afterall it's not the effort someone see's, it a mark.  When it comes down to it, what defines me is my stupid marks.  University isn't going to give a fucking piece of shit if someone tried hard.  All that matters is whether you do good or not.  I am so worried.  I want to get into the Biological Sciences eventaully but if my marks in my sciences are weak they probably won't even take a second look at me.  I wonder if this is what all 16 year olds think about or feel like.  I wish I knew, and I wish I had answers.

      Today was AWESOME!!!  I mean I think I did bad on the Math test, but other then that silght imperfection in my day it was really really REALLY good.  Chem was sooooo interesting today and she did a really good lesson today.  I am using my other re-write tommorow too because I KNOW that I can do soooo much better than the 69% I got on the test.  I am soooo happy right now and well worried about Math of course, but it's not the end of the world.

      Things seem to be going pretty good.  I feel happy right now.  Although I think I lost my math text book and my CALCULATOR!!. AND I HAVE A MATH TEST TOMMOROW.  I NEED my graphing calculator for tommorow because a normal calculator can't calc. any mortgage questions. But hopefully Lawrence just accidently took it or something, or maybe I just forgot it in her room or something.  I HOPE!  And well tonight to review for my math test I am going to have to go over my notes and use those as practice cause I have no text at the moment.  I am VERY responsible though and it seems strange that I wouldn't have it but I am not going to worry too much about it.  I understand my Chem. a little more.  Mrs. J also talked to me a little bit today, and she is like my favourite person in the entire world to talk to.  She is so awesome and like one of the best teacher's I have ever met, and like really cares about people.  I feel like things are starting to go my way.  I still have alot of things on my plate though, I have the math test, the chem re-write, the Chem project, the religion tests, my project and M.C. for the rel. final, and the next chapter 9 pt. 2 test next week.  Yeah it's alot.  But I CAN do it.

      I feel kind of bad right now.  Holidays are good, nice....relaxing.  They are wonderful, but what is not very wonderful is the fact that I feel forgotten.  I feel like I have no friends and like everyone has forgotten me.  No one calls me.  No one!  If I don't call them then I don't hear from them.  This is the first year that no one even called me to do anything New Years Eve.  I just stayed home on my couch watching the re-run of the Canadian Idol Finale.  Everyone else went out, while I just stayed home and was lonely and bored out of my mind.  Then I called up Chels today.  Usually me and her can have 2 hour conversations no problem and like just talk and talk.  When I called her today it seemed like the last thing she wanted to do was talk to me.  All she said within the time span of five minutes was: "Yeah, uh-huh, maybe, and oh."  I was kind of like having a one-way conversation.  I KNOW for a fact that if it had been Monet that called she would have not been so boring and unenthusiastic on the phone.  I did offer to her that we could go to a movie today or something but I never foreced the decision on her, all I said was "call me later then if you want to do something."  For some reason though I know that she isn't going to call.  I don't think she wants to do anything with me right now.  No one seems to ever want to do anything with me, but why?  What have I ever said or done that was so wrong?  What was it that I did?  After that conversation I just cried because we aren't the kind of friends we used to be.  Ever since she met that new girl Monet this year she has been way different.  I mean I have nothing against Monet and she is very nice, but all the stuff Chels and I used to do together is the stuff that Monet and her do together now.  I always hear about "When Monet and I went to the mall" or "When we went to so-and-so concert."  No one invited me to the mall....and no one ever invited me to the concerts they have been to.  Chels used to be the ONLY person that I could talk to about anything, and it hurts me so much now.  There are so many things I want to talk about, so many problems that I want to discuss with someone but I feel alone right now and there is just no one to talk to about anything anymore.  It hurts alot.  It never occured to me that someday our friendship wouldn't be as strong as it once was, and I never thought that she would meet someone that has better qualities in a friend that she would like better then me.  It makes me wonder sometimes 'Where did I go wrong?  What did I say to make you feel this way'?  I wonder why no one ever calls me.  I didn't do anything to hurt them or upset them, it's certainly not something I did or said.  I feel like I have no friends right now.  At lease no close friends at the moment.  As I get older the people I once were close with just somehow don't seem as close anymore.  I know this is a common feeling for a lot of people, but I don't want to loose all my so-called friends that I once had.  I can't do that you know, I can't do life alone right now.  I need people here for me more than ever.  I don't know what I would do without anyone else.  What I am trying to say is that basically I just feel very ALONE and FORGOTTEN and I need someone in my life right now that cares just a little.  That's all.

      Here I am on my computer again writing in my journal, the one friend that always listens and doesn't criticize.  You know now that I think of it, I think I saw into the future.  I really think I had a vision of it before.  I was thinking about dreams I had in the past and I remembered the one were I was walking through the Science wing and all these strange people said "Vanessa come it" and I walked into Mrs. J's room.  Now that I think of it - it was basically the future.  I foresaw that I would have another class with her.  Either it's a coincidence or I really dreamt the future!  Scary thought!  I bought the followed up novel for speak - Catalyst.  It is absolutely AMAZING!  I can sooo relate to it, especially because the main theme through it is Chemistry.  I miss chem!  Anyways yeah I went to Vanessa W's place yesterday for her b-day.  I had a fun time, although I am all "junked up" from all the shit that I ate that I probably could have done without.  I also finished my Drama project too, and now I just have to finish my warm-up which I am pretty well almost done.  Today I also want to review the Bio stuff we learn cause she said we might have a quiz Tuesday.  I will do good on that, cause I can.  And well I think I might go to the doctors sometime this week because I think on my stomach I am having some sort of allergic reaction.  I don't what it is and last time I went to the doctors they told me it was acne - but it's not because this stuff like swells up, is itchy, and painful.  Ok no offence, doctor or not, I know for a fact that's not acne.  I really need to find out what it is too, because I was actually going to go get a piercing there without telling anyone.  However, I need to find out if anything is going to cause me to have a reaction, cause if my mom ever found out I would be one very dead gal!

      Last night I had the strangest dream.  I dreamt that I kept eating all the chocolate I could find and I couldn't stop.  I would walk through like  narrow halls and all around were people that I knew just staring at me, saying nothing.  Then I went home, got on my scale, and yelled "omg I gained 10 pounds, what am I going to do?!"  LOL.  I guess the message here is to stop eating so much junk!  I am sooooo afraid of weight gain it's not even funny.  I suppose lunch yesterday didn't help.  Ash, Chels, and I went to East Side Mario's for lunch.  We actually had such a good time we were there for two hours.  We even had dessert afterwards - this big chocolate thing which me and Ash just went at.  Chels described it as: "It was like two monkeys fighting over one banana."  Ok I have to admit I am a pig when it comes to chocolate.  I mean c'mon who is like so junk deprived - ME!  Bio actually wasn't that bad yesterday.  I was a little worried about how I did on the unit test.  Turns out I got a 72% - not bad, but I am capable of an 80% or higher and that I know is possible.  Then unit we are getting into now does seem like it would be hard, but it's sooooo much more interesting than anything we studied on the biosphere.  What we are doing kind of reminds me of Chem in a way.  I feel like I am in my comfort zone.  I am also really motivated now because since she said it was a hard unit and I even more determined to prove myself capable of mastering hard tasks.  I have put that quiz that I did bad on in the last unit behind me.  It was one quiz, and a quiz is a quiz - nothing more.  Not ever worth much.  And I know that I am capable of great things.  Drama was also really great yesterday.  I am so proud of the work me and Megz did.  We put a scene together in about 5 minutes.  It couldn't have any words, just actions.  A beginning, middle, and end of course!  We actually weren't trying to make it funny, but everyone ended up laughing at it - so were like "yes we actually made people laugh!"  We even got Mr.B to laugh - mission accomplished!  LOL...  It was about the girl who goes shopping(me) and she sees these amazing shoes at a store, but the clerk(Megz) also wants the shoes, but she hasn't saved enough money for them.  While the shopper is convinced that she couldn't live without the shoes, the sales woman tries to sell her an ugly bag.  However the customer doesn't want it, so both the customer and the saleswoman run the the shoes and they each grab one.  They then circle each other trying to get the other shoe to make a pair.  However, the customer pulls out a $20 for the shoes and the saleswoman can't refuse.  The customer puts on the shoes, and sighs of relief then walks away!  That was our lovely speechless scene.  I am so proud of out work actually.  I felt it was some of my best work in Drama!

      I don't know what to say about the Bio test except I thought the M.C. was really hard.  Everyone else that I talked to was like "yeah that was easy."  I guess I shouldn't judge if I did good or bad on it right now, but I am not confident that I did well.  I got confused on a lot of questions, but I studied a lot for that.  It's like I know the information, but when I get to the test something happens.  I don't know what because I can't exactly explain or describe it.  There was lots of reading charts and number things to, and that's just not my thing.  Besides we hardly ever read charts or answer questions on them so it's odd that there would be a lot of that on the test.  I just pray I do good because I deserve it.  I can't deal with doing bad on something that I know for a fact I know very well.  I guess I will just have to wait for tomorrow and see.  We did go Off-Campus for Active Living today.  It was really fun!  We went curling and like at first it was really hard, but by the end of it we were getting a lot better and at the end of the game it was a tie.  Swain and I teamed up against the other girls in Off-Campus.  Drama was really cool today too.  We had a guy that specializes in make-up and costume design come it.  He did a demonstration on Megan which was amazing!  He made it look like she had wrinkles and bruises, and even scars he could do with the make-up.  It was amazing!

      It was a good/bad day.  I can't really make up my mind how I feel.  I do know though that after the Bio quiz I literally wanted to kill myself.  In fact, I know that I KNOW everything on that quiz.  I do know it.  Just something happened, I lost focus, got discouraged by something I didn't understand.  In fact I thought the whole quiz was confusing.  Like some sort of unfamiliar foreign language.  I am really upset.  In fact I just wanted to cry during and quiz and after.  If I could I would of just let the tears roll, of course now being upset has built up inside of me.  I am still upset now actually.  I was doing so good in everything in Bio, and then this stupid quiz.  I know she said it was hard and that people do really bad on it, but I STUDIED SOOOOOO MUCH.  It hurts so bad because I know I deserve to do better, I know that I deserve it.    I know a lot of other people probably did bad too but I really really think I have a learning disability.  I don't care if it sounds stupid, or funny.  I don't care if people think I am really smart and that it's not possible, because of course I am smart but I DO BELIEVE it's possible.  I don't know what is wrong, but for a while now I have clued in that something about me is different.  Maybe not from the outside, but something is wrong!!  I used to even think I had a brain tumor or something crazy like that, until I realized that was crazy to think that.  I guess I just want an answer to my struggles.  When demands increase I can't keep up with it.  No one but myself knows really how often I cry trying to do homework and how many times I have wished to be dead because of my struggles.  All my life I have struggled with Math especially and aspects of English.  Especially the reading comprehension.  I used EVERY strategy that I have been taught throughout school and you know what I scored on the last reading comp. test in English - 35%.  The thing is that I have always struggled with it and people just ignore the fact, and it doesn't help.  Ever since I was introduced to reading comp. I have struggled with in, and I don't know how to pass those tests!  I used all the strategies and everything - so where do I go from there???  Honestly I don't know.  I don't know how I got through Chem, or math 20 last semester, I honestly don't - I suppose maybe it was because of my 200% effort I put into everything.  Of course it doesn't end there.  In fact jump in a car with me and you will learn a lot more.  I failed drivers ed.  You can't really understand what that does to your self-esteem until you have experienced it.  And guess who has experienced it - me.  Sometimes I wonder if I am just not ready to drive, but I feel ready.  Everyone always talks about how they want to drive and it's fun.  You know what I think when I hear the word driving - STRESS.  I'll admit it - Driving I find to be one of the hardest things.  Every time after the drivers ed class I would come hope crying.  I never did go for my license - why would I after failing drivers ed.  My parents just assumed that I am not ready.  No one ever stops to think that maybe that isn't the case.  Sometimes I wonder if maybe I am just a slow learner, but I don't think that's the right answer.  I mean everything points to some sort of learning disability.  Whether people see it or not, they are not the ones who live my life.  They should try walking in my footsteps  -Math being hard all my life -Failing/Barely passing reading comp. tests -Difficulty driving -Not understanding directions for labs (Which is why in Chem half of the time I just sat there during the lab - it's not because I didn't want to do it, it is because I didn't understand what to do) -Difficulty with relationships (Though I am sure lots of people have this problem)  To be honestly I find EVERYTHING difficult.  Whether I always show it or not, it's difficult.  No matter how good I may do in Social, or Religion or anything like that.  Plain and Simple - it's HARD.  All of it!  Not that I am saying life should be easy.  Other people excel at other subjects while they may not be strong in others.  I on the other hand am talented in the arts I suppose.  Not drawing wise.  Mainly Drama though I play the flute.  However it would be a lie to say that it isn't hard because learning and playing is a struggle and a challenge.  I wish I had answers.  Some sort of answers.  I wish someone could explain to me why everything is so difficult for me.  I wish someone could tell me why I struggle so much.  I wish I knew a way to change that, to be less stressed out, to not cry so often and have emotional breakdowns at night while "trying" to do my homework.  It's frustrating feeling like something is wrong, but the rest of the world doesn't seem to think so.  Maybe they're right, but I don't think so.

      Today was really good.  Of course usually the days of semester II are good.  In fact I got 14/14 on my Bio assignment - that would mean 100%!!!!!  Tomorrow we have a Bio quiz which I know I am capable of doing good on.  Also I have an English test but if I prepare enough for it I think I will be ready.  I got like 30 something % on my reading comp test and well I can re-write it but the thing is that I TRIED MY BEST.  I used all the strategies that they have taught and everything.  It's frustrating not being able to successfully do reading comprehension all my life.  This is why I have always thought that I might have a learning problem of some sort.  It's confusing though because sometimes I can score amazing marks, and at other times I put my best effort forward and it is barely apparent.

      Ok well I haven't posted in a long while.  I have been so busy, but none the less so extrodinarily overjoyed with the content and satisfaction of life.  I got 89% on my last Bio quiz, and so far have managed to score 70% or above on everything thus far.    Friday was amazing.  It was eventful and we were on the go since school ended.  First I had a Model UN meeting, then I ate a nice juicy chicken burger from the YMCA cafe.  Megz and everyone met up (about 23 people) and we divided into groups with one assigned driver and we given cameras and a scavenger hunt to do.  Some of the things we did were EXTREMELY CRAZY and are pictures to prove it!  Then we met up at Pizza Hut for pizza and Megz opened her b-day gifts.  I got her a g-certificate to body things which is a place she buys dance stuff from.  Then we went to East Side Mario's and ordered a million desserts til' we felt like our stomachs were going to burst!  Saturday morning I woke up bright and early to get to MODEL UN.  We met sooooo many amazing and wonderful and smart and good-looking and intelligent people!  It was so fun!!  I learned soooo much and walked away from the experience just saying "WOW."  I learned so much about myself, the UN, and gained plenty of knowledge that can be used in everyday life.  The University is soooooo cool and the banquet dinner was the most amazing this ever.  I felt like a queen for one night, like royalty.  No one even serves me dinner!!  I even made a really good friend.  Since in the Model UN you could write a note and then put the country name and the section such as GA: General Assembly (which is actually the room I was in) I wrote a note to Mr. Egypt I call him.  I think he is so perfect, just everything about him.  Lets say we sent a lot of notes to and fro and he even has my email now.  He goes to Grandin and he seems that type to keep his word.  In fact I know that he will contact me a while's after Model UN.  I walked away with more knowledge and a good friend.  I also met a lot of other brilliant, intelligent, and unique people!  Life seems to be going my way for once.  Everything is falling into place.   All I have to say is "let it fall!"  I mean Bio is going really well and I am doing good, MODEL UN was amazing and I met Jack (Mr. Egypt!) and I even got a part in the school play!!  What more could a gal such as me ask for?!?!  Note much more I wouldn't think!  I am more then just content, I am overjoyed.  Today I smiled for then I have in the last...hmm I can't recall how many days!  Of course I even said "hey" to LaCour and she didn't even have the dignity to say "hey vanessa" of course maybe she was just having a bad day.  But whatever, is people can't be polite and say "hi" and acknowledge that others exist then that's their problem!  Active Living was amazing today!  AMAZING I TELL YA!  Everyone wants ME on their team!  ME ME ME!!  That's right!!!!! - ME!  In jr. High I would always be like last, now it's like - hey we want the Work Horse!  LOL!  Swain kept telling the guys how they should play like me.  I bet out just about every guys out there, and out worked them all.  The guys on the other team were even complaining about not having ME on their team.  Swain asked if I could switch so they would stop complaining!  So I switched teams, and I still could out work them and beat em!  It was great!  I am really good at broomball!  I am turning out to be good at a lot of things.  Before I was just too blind from the discouragement in Chem and Math to see beyond the bad things, but I see further than even before.  I see the horizon where the sun comes up.  It rises beyond the hills and the sun shines on ME!

      Today was good, but I have another Bio quiz to study for again.  Yesterday I stayed at the school and then got supper and then had to be in the Drama studio for 6:00 pm to do a rehearsal of our scences we were showing for the open house.  Then we performed from 7:00 and went past 8:30.  I didn't get home until after 9:00 pm.  I was so afraid I wouldn't remember the Bio I studied.  I think the quiz was ok today, but there was something that I just totally could not remember no matter how hard I tried.  It was even part of the topic that *I* researched.  Doesn't make very much sense does it!!  I also made a mistake with the last question on the front side.  I put that animals absorb water through cellular respiration.  Oh boy Vanessa, that's like not even close!! LOL.  I guess I can't change the fact that I made a stupid mistake like that, so I guess I will just laugh about it.  I have sooooo much to do this weekend though.  I have that Bio project, which is alright and not that bad but I also have an essay to write for English.  She isn't even giving us the question for it until tomorrow.  Also tomorrow after school I have a model UN meeting and then I 'm meeting up for Megz party and we are going for pizza after.  Then on Saturday and Sunday I will be at the university all day!  I'm going to be a busy busy gal!  No rest for me!  Broomball today was really fun.  Active Living is fun!  I'm glad I switched Physics for it.  It is such a nice break from hard work and everything.  It's nice to just have some fun.  Of course Drama is fun too!  And good news, no great news, no EXCELLENT NEWS!   ...I MADE THE AUDITION CUT FOR A MID SUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM!   ...And I got Cobweb as my part  ...It's nothing major, but I feel good just to have a part and actually be chosen  ...This semester kicks @$$!  ...And did I mention I love life right now?!?

      Words cannot describe how I feel today.  Feeling loved, cherished, important - that's what I feel like today.  In Bio my group got all their work done!!  I have trust issues you know and well it was a little bit (ok well not a little bit, but really) it was was really hard to trust some people I don't know.  And well they did finish their work and our project is done and it's all ready to present for tomorrow.  In Drama Mr. B wants me to like play my flute when the audience are walking in and while there are scene changes going on.  He wants me to do so much and it makes me feel so important.  I guess that is because I have a very important part in the Drama presentations tomorrow night at the open house.  After our little run through of everything today he even was like "And lets thank Vanessa for all that she is doing" and everyone clapped for ME!  Just for me - no one else.  It truly was an applause, a 100% dedicated applause just to me.  That makes me feel so incredibly special.  Even when I was sitting upstairs in the Science Wing and eating my lunch, Ms. LaCour said "Hi Vanessa."  Of course if she said that to anyone else I don't think they would appreciate it as much as I do.  No one hardly ever stops to say "hi" to me anymore.  It's like sometimes I'm invisible and the whole world can see, but they can only see beyond me and not what is in front of their eyes.  If that makes any sense.  I guess what I am trying to get across is that I felt noticed you know.  I do like it when people just say "hi" to me, because it doesn't happen a lot.  Active Living was the best today!  We played broomball and I like got my right hand all scratched up and even broke my nail off.  It actually really hurt and now there is blood on my new expensive jacket.  It was so fun though.  The guys even gave me a nickname - Work Horse!  LOL, ok Mr. Swain was like "You know she has a name and it's Vanessa" but you know what, I actually kind of liked being called Work Horse.  The guys said they called me that because I worked harder than all of them.  I would do all the work, then they would just score.  They even were like "C'mon Work Horse we want you to score for us" and like they helped me score a goal!  That was awesome and I think I am going to make my MSN name Work Horse - cause I do work my ass off - I'm a work horse!  How cute!  After class Mr. Swain even told me that I worked harder than anyone else and I beat out everyone out there.  That was an amazing compliment to get from someone like him.  It made me feel good.  Of course now I have to end my journal entry with boring ole' English.  That class well was boring, but I mean C'mon every good day has it's boring class.  Now that can't be debated.  You know I think the list of people who made in to the cast of A Mid Summer's Night Dream is being posted tomorrow.  I really can't wait because I know for a fact my audition was really good.  I just hope I am on the list.  If I am not then it's not the end of the world, but I do have confidence in myself that my name very well may be on there.  Fingers crossed!

      I drove today and I drove good!  For once my parents didn't insult my driving, for once I wasn't told that it totally sucks - because it was good!  My driving is a lot better than it was before.  I think once my Dad's contract expires he is going to review with me uphill and downhill parking, and probably some parallel parking too so then I can take my drivers test.  I feel a lot more confident now, and a lot more ready.  Once I review that stuff I should be good to go.  I also went to the zoo today.  There were so many people there.  I think half of Calgary was there actually.  It was really neat cause I saw the new white tiger they have, it was so beautiful.  And I saw cute little (actually big) sloth bears playing - how cute.  And I said the cute lil' adorable red panda.  There were other things I saw, but of course the tigers, sloth bears, and the red panda seems to stand out more in my mind.  Got school tomorrow.  I am excited of course but scared for Bio for some reason.  Silly me!  I am also kind of nervous because the model UN is going on during the weekend I am involved in it, so basically I am going to be very busy next weekend.  The closer it gets to it, the more nervous I get.  Though great people are also doing it with me, like Megan, Kenda, Elisa, and Maria to mention a few names.  I think I will be getting a ride with Elsie that day, but if not then probably Megz.  I think we will stick together cause we won't know a lot of people.  We had a sub for English on last day of classes before the holidays, but our English teacher was there and told us to read a story and that we were having a test when we get back on the story.  See the thing is - I don't remember the story that I read!  I mean I didn't understand it in the first place, but it was Wednesday that we read it.  What am I suppose to keep these things stored in my precious memory???  I don't think so!  So I am thinking that tonight I might read it again just in case.  I also can't wait for Active Living and Drama tomorrow.  Hopefully we get to play Kinball again in Active Living cause that was like so incredibly fun!  And well in Drama we are putting the final touches on our February 18th performances for the Open House at the school.

      There is sun this morning!  SUN!!  The last few days have just been dull and gloomy it's hard to have a good attitude.  Now there is sun.  It's so refreshing when you wake up and your blinded by the light.  Guess you could say I am a true Summer gal, though Summer is still far away.  I had like the strangest dream last night.  I guess I have been thinking about school too much.  I dreamt that every time the bell would ring for a class change, I forgot something so I would go back to my locker and then be late for the next class.  When I was going to Bio I walked through the Math wing and in my old class our Bio teacher was there and I remember her saying "Now see the reflection of the mirrors?"  I wasn't sure if that was the right class so I went upstairs where Bio is suppose to be, but no one was there.  So I went back down stairs to the Math wing.  Strange dream!  I've been thinking about Bio or School too much.  In fact, most of my dreams nowadays are based on school, Bio, or Chem.

      Back online again.  Got lots more to say.  It seems that there is just so much I have to think and talk about right now.  I guess talking/writing to my computer will have to do.  I don't think anyone else will listen to my rambling, or would want to.  So yeah Ben and Melissa came for supper and we ate alot.  I am so afraid of gaining weight but I just keep eating.  Weight is a big struggle, and well yeah I have done good at maintaining my weight loss but I would like to loose more, however I am thinking if I keep this eating pattern up I might start to gain some.  Everyone gets sick of me talking about weight but they don't realize that while maybe a lot of people don't have weight issues and are thin, some people have a real struggle with it.  I would be one of those people that struggle.  Anyways I was talking to Ben and Melissa and they are getting a hot tub.  That's right a hot tub.  Since their new house is being built they are going to buy it soon and put in the basement because once the house is complete they won't be able to get it in.  And well I am allowed to go over there and use it if I want and stuff.  YAY!  Although it is a long way from the S.W. but I mean c'mon it's a hot tub - that is like what I have always wanted.  Of course for those who know my romantic fantasy date, I dream of being in a steamy hot tub with roses all around with the dark moonlight sky above and a slight fog outside.  Ok that is enough of me fantasizing!  My Dad is in town this weekend - finally!  I feels like it's been forever since I last saw him.  At first I didn't mind him fly back and forth a couple weeks here and there to visit, but now it feels like he is not really my Dad.  I mean of course he is, but since I don't see him a lot it feels that way.  My mother says that sometimes it feels like she is single so I guess my feelings are actually quite common.  Anyways my parents said that next February break I might miss like a day of school or something but we are going to fly to Florida.  That is where one of the NASA buildings is located, and I made my dad promise me that we are going to go for a tour.  He never breaks promises, so yay we get to go!  I just have a long ways to wait.  That is basically like a year from now - so yeah it's a long ways away at the moment.  I think that tomorrow I am going to the zoo!  How exciting - I sound like a kid.  Anyways I want to see that new white tiger, at least I think that is what it is.  I love tigers, cats, you name it - anything feline.  Of course I think that I will sleep in on my last day off.  I miss school a lot because it is like a second home to me.  Half of my life is spent there, and it keeps me busy.  Today I also did that contest thing in the sun where you like go through the papers for the week and find answers to questions.  If you get picked you can get a $2000 scholarship to a post-secondary institution.  So yeah I am going to mail it in, and I think it goes for a couple weeks.

      On Friday I went to Chelsey's house and Edi made us all dinner - Lets just say that was some of the best chicken I have had.  We watch the Lion King 1 1/2 which is hilarious and My boss Daughter or some movie like that.  Then we played Uno extreme and bunch of card games.  It was fun!  Yesterday I didn't really do much - just listen to a bunch of music and relax.  This break seems to be actually really short it seems like it's going so fast.  I went with my parents a couple places because my dad is in town.  Then we went out for dinner and Swiss Chalet because my mom wanted there chicken.  I felt really lonely on Valentines day though.  I just wished that I had someone in my life.  I just wished for one day that someone could love me, and they could just say "I love you Vanessa" and hold me.  I suppose one day there will be someone in my life, but I am afraid that I might not meet that person.    You know I have been thinking about Aaron a lot.  I mean some sort of twist of fate brought us together over the summer.  Then we just never talked after a few weeks.  Some stupid reasons kept us apart during a summer we could have spent time together.  I mean I know he lied to me about his age and everything when he met me, but I think he only did that because he didn't want me to turn away from him and I didn't.  I miss him a lot.  There have never been anyone like him.  When we met each other both him and myself felt like we were meant to be together for the rest of our lives.  That is not a common feeling when your young.  There was a spark with me and him, there was Chemistry between the two of us.  I don't feel that way with anyone or about anyone else.  I have never felt that way about or with anyone else.  Sometimes I wonder if I will ever see him again.  God can only do so much to create your destiny and let fate do the rest, but I guess sometimes that might not be good enough.  Ultimately we are the ones that decide what direction our lives go in.  Some of us take the right directions, some of us take the wrong directions.  Somethings we don't even know which direction is the right one and which is the wrong one.  I don't know for sure if Aaron and I are meant to be together, but I am starting to realize that what I felt around him, just with him was something so powerful.  When I think my future, I can see him there.  Ok so he lives in Halifax and I am in Calgary, but those are just slight differences.  You know when I met him, he though I was perfect.  And yet I was just being myself - image that myself, and that is perfect to him.  To him I didn't need to change anything.  No one sees me that way.  Chels was with me that day we met - July 18, 2003 - I even remember the specific day.  Usually when guys meet Chels and I, they are always attracted to her.  Maybe cause she opens up more right away, maybe cause she is thinner, who knows.  For once though, someone was attracted to me though.  Me for once.  And that was a special feeling in itself.  I think that I might have given up something that could have been great.  We only stopped talking cause he lied to me.  I have trust issues and don't like people who lie - but I realize now that he was doing that because he didn't want to loose me.  I see the picture clearly.  Though his plan back fired, and he didn't realize that I am the kind of girl that just takes people for who and what they are.  That is just me.  He also needed a little work on the hygiene, but that can be fixed.  Everything else is perfect.  To each other we were perfect and if I ever got to see him again, then I KNOW that we would still feel the same.  He was a good looking guy, cute.  Even chels had to agree with me.  I always look at the pics from the summer.  I look at the smiles on our faces.  We had so much fun, with Aaron it was all about fun.  And that is what I want.  Lets put it this way - I miss chem, I miss chem, I REALLY REALLY miss chem.  I am a confused girl.  I am not about to go make judgments about my future but I know that I want to be a high school teacher, but now the question is what kind of teacher.  I know that I want to teach something related to the science area and have already ruled out physics because that's too math based and just not my thing.  So what is left then - Bio and Chemistry.  We haven't got totally into Bio yet, but I find it kind of dry although since most if memorization I am pretty sure I am going to be way better at that.  However, Chem I found VERY difficult, I mean honestly I thought it was the hardest thing that I have even done.  I like it though.  You know I thought I didn't like it, or the teacher, but my views and my opinions have totally changed.  The chem teacher is one of my most favorite teachers of all time.  At the beginning of the year I thought she was evil, now I think she is the coolest.  See I am confused though, I always seemed confused.  Because well I kind of want to teach Chemisty, which would be ok I was as smart as the chem teacher.  I mean I can barely balance a chemical equation properly and I want to be a chem teacher...!  I can't explain it, it's weird.  I mean why do I always want to do what seems hardest.  It would be easier to teach bio probably, because I would most likely be better at it.  Eventually I do have to decide though.  Will I major in Bio or will I major in Chem???  Do I choose the area that I like more or the one that I am better it????  So many questions and I have to decide before I apply to university next fall.  You know I am accomplished more than I have even thought.  I am not the naturally smart, talented, or gifted.  I am your hard worker.  I work for all my dreams.  I turn those dreams into goals, and I accomplish them.  Of course University if whole other challenge in itself.  I am afraid.  Afraid that if I choose Chemistry to major in I might get stuck in a rut of not understanding because I do find it very difficult.  Then University and all the money spent would be a waste.  If I choose Bio, it would be easier but still challegning and I could probably do it, but I wonder since it doesn't interest me as much as chem, would I get tired of teaching Bio.  You see I just don't know, and I guess that's life because really none of us have all the right answers.  You know I do think that I would make an excellent teacher.  I know what people go through.  I understand that people do need help and that things can get very hard sometimes.  I mean I have sat down enough nights just staring at the math book and crying, looking at it like it's some kind of foreign language, and not being able to answer the questions.  By some amazement no one even knows that, I keep it so well hidden.  I even managed to finish all my homework last semester and everything.  No one will even know how many people I had to ask to understand, and all the nights I had to cry to finally get a little bit closer to understanding.  In fact lots of people think I am really good at social too.  You know I guess it could be partially true, but really I don't seem to learn anything from that class.  I have just come up with my own techniques for getting good grades, not actually mastering the material.  For the long answer tests since they give the questions before I wrote the answers out, and then just memorized the answers.  After the test was done, everything I had memorized seemed to be erased from my memory.  I admit my study techniques suck - What study techniques is the question I should be asking!  You know teachers spend so much time or material and teaching it, but what they don't teach is how to properly study.  I mean of course I study all the time, but I often wonder if I am doing something wrong.  After all if I can't get the marks I deserve and want, then don't you think teachers should teach us how to properly prepare for exams.  I learnt more in Chemistry then in Social, but my Social mark was like way higher then Chem.  So what does that show anyway.  Are marks really an accurate way of showing how much people learn.  You know really a mark, a percentage - it's just a number that's all.  It doesn't define how much you know, or how much you don't know.  It doesn't determine you future (well usually it doesn't) so then why is there so much emphasize on them?  You know I never thought about that until now.  So now that I think of it, why would I let my Chem mark stop me from doing what I want to do.  It doesn't define me, or what I know.  So when the time comes to apply for University, which will come sooner than I am imagined, I am going to major in Chem because that is what I want to do.  I don't care if it's my lowest mark, highest mark, whatever it ends up to be.  Why would I let a number determine my future.  I will decide what I want to do based on my feelings.  After all I wouldn't major in something related to Social just because I have a high mark, so why would I choose not to major in something I have a lower mark in???  You know just thinking about this makes so much sense, like I feel I have gained about 2000 points towards my confidence level.  I think that if you believe, then anything can happen.  You bet I am going to make what I want it life happen.  I have made my dreams before into goals that I have achieved, so why not do it again.  I think I know what I want to do in life know.  I know now.  After High School I just have to do it.  I will be a High School Chemistry Teacher.  That's it.  It doesn't matter how far fetched that seems right now.  The things that are harder are always more of a challenge, but somehow I always go for things that don't come easy to me.  It just means I have to work harder to get what I want, and to get where I want to be.  I see clearly now.  I understand.

      Ok so I am back online!  I just got home a while ago and so much has happend since this morning.  You know today I really feel "complete."  I feel like whatever was missing before has now just arrived right infront of my face.  Even I am not sure what this means, I just know I feel good.  I got my brows waxed today and went shopping again and bought myself - YES I TREATED MYSELF - anyways a pink spring jacket.  I LOVE it. , and I can't wait to show chels.  I think that her and I and some of the uiversity/college guys are going to Edi's house to play some pool and stuff.  And well yeah I guess that jacket was a reward to myself for all my hard work for making honors and I used part of my grandma's $40 that she gave to put towards the total value.  My mom also bought me a roxy shirt which I love.  And well I got my eyes checked today too, and my vision is still the same.  Did I mention that I also ruined a pair of my new underwear that had little glimmery jewels on em.  It wasn't suppose to be my T.O.M. til like next Saturday but you know how it is.  The monthly visit always comes when your least expecting it, lol - that sounds so bad!  Anways year grr. that was like my favourite pair, but well it could have been worse.  In fact, I have had and been though worse things than that.

       Fun day yesterday!  A fun, fun day!  Went to South Centre and got some black pants.  Lets just say I have never seen my ass look so damn good in anything before.  Then I got a new pair of jeans form AE and a shirt for when it gets warmer.  In sears I went to the Clinique counter and this cute guy was working in cosmetics - like I have never even heard of a guy in cosmetics!  So yeah he was cute, and we were looking for some makeup for the wedding even though it's not til' may, but the guy was like - "do you want me to do your makeup"and I was like "Y-E-S."  So then he did one eye and then showed me how to do it like he did, it was really neat.  He showed me how to apply my eye liner and mascara because those two things I have never worn before.  It was really neat, and like I also got this lipgloss stuff - #7 Sugarblue.  Now that is some cool stuff and I also picked up this shimmer stuff with the happy perfume in it.  Oh I am beginning to like cosmetics - I get it now when people like make-up.  Of course I don't wear any to school though because I mean when would I have any time to put it on.  Saving it for special occasions makes it all the better.   Actually it was really warm yesterday.  There is actually sun again today too!  I love the sun.  It's like when I wake up I am blinded by light and I don't feel so depressed.  Semester II is so much better you know.  I mean I confess though that I do miss Chem.  I actually miss it ALOT!  I guess I spend like my life in that class - during class and tutorial and now it's like a part of me is missing.  I didn't realize how much I enjoyed it, until I didn't have it anymore.  Bio I think is good now though.  Of course I am not friends with many people in that class because they are mostly grade 10's, but for the group assignment I met this really nice girl, Lisa, and there is this other really nice girl, Aaron, that sits next to me.  I feel a little more comfortable in that class now then I did at the beginning.  It was really awkward and everything and well I am not sure what I think of these projects that we have to do and then like "teach" the class.  It's a little odd, because like usually we wouldn't do something like that for Bio.  I am afraid that I might not be able to learn the material as well as if it were taught.  But whatever happens I am going to know my stuff, cause studying will actually pay off in Bio, where as Chem not so much because it's a lot of application of your knowledge, rather than the just straight forward information of what you know.

      Today was really awesome.  Drama was really fun today and we worked on our scences for the Feb. 18th open house performance.  I think that the Bio quiz went pretty good and there were only a couple questions on the back that I got confused on cause they were like those questions where you had to choose between option A or B.  I forgot to put my name on it though and realized afterwards.  I also forgot my name on the lab we did the other day.  I think what happened is that I wanted to get all that stored up info in my brain out and when I did the quiz and got it all out I worried about the info, but I forgot the simple part - my name.  When I told Mrs. J that I forgot my name she made like this comment that I actually kind of thought was rude - but really I don't think she was trying to be rude, that is just how I interpreted it I think.  She was like "What's with this name thing?"  At least of what I remember it was something like that.  I kind of got offended because I can't help that I keep forgetting to put my name on things.  How am I suppose to remember that?!?  If I don't remember, then I just don't remember.  In English we had a sub and we hardly did anything.  She just assigned a story to read and that was that.  So I read the story and then had free time so I played some games on the comp and finished off my bio.  Then I had active living.  SOOOOO FUNNNNN!!!  We played kinball and that was my first time playing it, but like the people on my team were so nice and awesome.  I had so much fun.  Our team even won, and we beat the four other teams.  Now I am just sitting here thinking about my day.  I am really having a big issue with my weight.  I keep eating alot, and I am gaining some weight.  I feel like I should stop, but sometimes I just have to keep going.  What happens if like for a week I will gorge on anything and everything.  Then the next week after I find that I have gained weight so I barely eat anything.  Of course it would be a lie to say that I don't like food - because I do.  I just don't know how to control that part of me right now.  Sometimes it's very easy, but at other times it is very difficult.  I am REALLY REALLY going to try eat alot more healthier and try not to gorge.

      ARGGG!!!  I can't deal with old people.  I mean I love my grandma and all but she talks and talks, and TALKS!!!  Sometimes I just want to sit down and have a quiet peaceful meal but that is impossible.  When I got home she was like: "look, look at the rabbit outside."  And like I have seen a million rabbits in my life time and like can anyone say...BORING!!!  She kept going on about that thing for like 10 minutes.  Ten minutes about a rabbit ok!!  Can you feel my pain??!?  In Bio I am kind of worried that some people in my group might not get their stuff done.  I have to be worried because my marks are VERY important.  There is this one really nice girl, Lisa, in my group and she is willing to do the work, but the other two people drew a dart board on the white board and used some sort of magnet for the arrow and they played that while they were suppose to be doing research.  Then they broke the first laptop we were given and they glued on the key they broke and then got another one.  When they got the other laptop they didn't even do their reasearch - like I said they just played that dart game thing.  I feel as if I am being portrayed as a bad student or something.  I mean with no one nominating me for habits of mind last term that especially makes my thoughts more realistic.  Especially I feel like Mrs. J feels I am a bad student, I don't know why I feel this way but something makes me think that right now.  I know I have a good work ethic and try hard, and do know lots, but sometimes I wonder if she ever forgot that and now has a different opinion of me.  I am probably just over reacting and thinking too much, but that is how I feel.  English was actually really good today.  We had to answer these really boring questions but then we got to write a poem.  And poetry is MY THING.  I LOVE writting poems.  So yeah that was fun, and something I am good at.  We played handball in active living and I thought that the guys might not let the few girls play but they did and they were totally ok with it, so yeah that was fun.

      I had a good day today except for active living.  Katie was being rude and stuck up, and we had to shoot hoops for an hour and a half.  No offence but that is not my idea of fun.  Bio was really good today.  She explained the lab which was soooo nice, because it Chem they always left us in the dark and confused about what we were suppose to be doing.  I also auditioned for the play today and I think it went really well.  Drama was fun today and we got to work on our scenes for the Feb. 18th performance.  I am so excited for that, but I hope we don't get alot of homework and tests the day after.  English was pretty good too.  The other day she asked me to read, and well it was kind of creepy but like she was calling out names for attendance and she called me "miss vanessa" - that was a little creappy.  Overall I did have a good day, and mat and I kind of talked a little bit.

      Yesterday night it was Andrej's 19th b-day so he took us all out to eat and we got pizza - lots of it.  And well I gained some weight too, so now I have to like cut back on the eating.  The we went bowling and then back to kari's house.  We had so much fun!  Earlier that day I just practiced my monologue for my audition for the play and then I was bored so I studied Bio cause she said we are having a quiz soon.  Nothing too exciting.  And today I am going to review the bio stuff we learned and maybe do some research for the Model UN thing I am doing.

      Today was fun.  Drama was so awesome this morning - fun like always!  And in Bio the girl next to me talked to me - someone actually talked to me!  And well English was boring as usual, but she asked me to read so I felt special, lol.  In Active Living we did the 30 minute run and I was STARVING by the end of it, but I found it pretty easy.  So then after I was like "LETS EAT, EAT, EAT, and I think I annoyed like everyone.  But I am good now, on a full stomach.  We had pitas today - YUM...

      You know today was going pretty good, but I must be cautious when my days start to turn out good because they always seem to get ruined by one thing or another.  I guess today just proves that "Life isn't fair."  Everything was fine until TAPS.  I made honors of course, cause I worked my ass off for it.  And well before I went to interviews I was talking to Chels and she also made it, but she was like "Oh and I got nominated so many times for habits of mind."  You know what happened when I asked my TA: "So did any teachers nominate me for habits of mind?" and her answer was a "NO."  When that no came out of her mouth I don't think I have even gone from so happy to so sad in that many seconds.  I mean I don't understand what I did wrong!  Was it something I did, or something I didn't do?!?! I KNOW for a fact that I have worked harder that half of the people in our school.  I have gone to more tutorials than 3/4 of the student population and that I know for sure.  I know that because out of all the days of the semester there has been 10 days or less that I haven't gone to tutorial.  Now try finding in the school how many people have gone to that many tutorials.  I bet that someone couldn't even find 10 people like that.  I worked my ass off.  And the sad thing is people in my TA who come in the morning are like "Oh I didn't study, Oh I didn't finish my homework - I should umm finish it now"  and sadly alot of the time those are the people who get nominated.  Well you know what, I finish all my homework before the school day and put ALOT of effort into it.  I put in hours of studying, and I know for a fact I put in more hours than alot of other people.  It hurts alot to know that NO ONE nominated me.  It makes me feel like no one even notices me, or even cares for that matter.  I feel like I even worked way harded this year to get the marks I have gotten.  I feel like I have put EVERYTHING into school, and if people didn't nominate me 1st semester it gives me little hope for 2nd semester.  Of course not all the teachers, but I presume that most teachers only nominate the advaced, the smart, the gifted, the talented.  I feel like none of the above.  I am a hard worker but it seems there is little room left for that category.  I just don't want things to be made worse by Chels bragging tommorow about: "Oh I got nominated by so many people" - and blah, blah, blah.  Just what I need to destroy my self -esteem.  But you know after I cried about enough tears to flood my bathroom I came to realize that you know what, I KNOW in my heart, I KNOW in my mind that I really worked VERY hard and put in my 110% effort.  If people can't see that, then it's their fault.  I know that I do deserve to be nominated, but I am not, so I have to deal with it cause nothing is going to change.  What's done is done.  Only God knows why no one nominated me, literally only God knows.  I mean I am trying to not take this so badly, but I didn't think not getting nominated would upset me this badly -but I knew I wanted it very badly.  Ever since I learned that you can be nominated for habits of mind I have purposly worked harder and tried by very best.  If that is not good enough then I don't know what is.  I feel really bad, but not as bad as before, and definetly not as upset as before.  It would of made me happy if at least one person nominated me, but like I said "Life just isn't fair sometimes."  And right now it isn't fair because I know what I deserve.

      I am not sure what to think of the new semester yet.  We haven't really got into anything interesting in Bio yet, but Drama cheers me up all the time.  Today Active Living was really fun and we did fitness testing which I did awesome on and tomorrow we are doing the 30 minute run.  I got really freaked out today though - I mean I didn't tell anyone but when we were doing a 5 lap warm-up around the gym I starting getting this stabbing pain right about where my heart is on the left side, then when I kept running the pain like stabbed through my stomach.  I had the same pain when I went to go work out at the YMCA one morning and well I am kind of scared.  I mean there's pain for a reason obviously and I have to run for half-an-hour tomorrow and I will do what I need to do to get a good mark - even if that means running though half-an-hour of stabbing pain but hopefully it won't happen again.  I talked to that Aaron girl in Bio again this morning too - she is the only person I talk to in Bio and well I am glad that at least someone talks to me.  I am scared for doing a lab though.  I am not scared of any labs or anything, I am just afraid that I won't know anyone and no one is going to want to do that labs with me.  Maybe I am just over reacting though and thinking too much.  Maybe the gr. 11's could just go in their own lab group.  Who knows really - I guess whatever happens, happens for a reason.  I sort of feel out of place in English too.  There are lots of people that I see as "acquaintances" but other than that I don't really have a lot of friends in my class.  Making friends was never really my thing - that's Chelsey thing, then she just introduces me to people - but I am going to have to learn something right.  But half of the people I would rather just not know, because I don't make friends with smokers, druggies, or people who can't focus, do work, or pay attention.  My English teacher does seem really nice though but she comes across to me as a "favour picker"  - those are the teachers that give students better marks because they are their favorite or they just suck up 1000 times, or they already know them.  It is only the first week of semester 2 though and I mean I can't really make too many judgments or assumptions yet.

      Today was ok - but I have no homework because I finished it all.  It feels weird to not have homework  Without Math and Chem I sure have an easy semester - except for Bio.  I actually talked to someone in my Bio class today too which is good consider I was freaked out that NO ONE would talk to me because there are like no grade 11's.  It almost feels like I failed it really, but maybe I will make alot of friends or something, but it's hard cause most of these people already know each other.  I think I did bad on that fist Bio assignment too because she wasn't like really clear about what she wanted so I think I did some stuff wrong.  Even if I do bad on it though, I have to remember that it is only the first assignment and there are MANY others - because I mean I failed the first quiz in Chem but I didn't do totally horrible in that class - I did pretty good for my skills and abilities.  Drama was sooooo fun today.  That is like one of the best classes I have in my schedule.  We did so much and the class felt like it just kept going and going, and we were having so much fun.  Tomorrow we are doing fitness testing in Active Living tomorrow and I just know I am going to have like burn out by the end of it - especially if we have to do the 30 minute run.  But I can handle it - I'm not in that bad of shape.

      Today was filled with so many emotions.  More happy emotions than anything really.  This morning Mrs. J was like "Hey Vanessa, your in my bio class" and I was like "WHHHATTTTT?!?!?!?????!!!!"  At first I was shocked, then just happy.  I am soooo happy I got my favourite teacher in the entire world for Bio.  Of course it kind of blows that 90% of my class is in grade 10.  It's also ironic because I sit in the same corner and desk in Bio now, as I did in Science 10.  Notice how I always end up siting in corners?!??  -It's like everytime I take some sort of science, guess who ends up sitting in an isolated corner - ME!  But yeah today was good.  Drama was awesome!!  Active Living was cool cause our class is small and I know a couple people, and today Justin Pono - the guy that used to hate me and always call me ugly was like "Hey, How's it goin'?"  So yeah people were nice, my schedule worked out soooo incredibly nice.  I am still mad at you-know-who but whatever.  And well I umm lost my wallet.  That's right, my wallet.  It had my new bus pas, my learners, debt card, YMCA membership, student ID, and well some money too.  Now I can't do anything fun cause I have no money!! GRRRR.  O well, hopefully it will turn up, but I feel happy for some reason even though losing my wallet was stupid and sucks, I still feel REALLY HAPPY! :)

      I'm not looking forward to see you-know-who tommorow cause I just know we are going to get into another big argument, but maybe something worse.  And tommorow and I just want to be nice, happy, good, all of the above.  Usually in the world of Vanessa that isn't possible, but I am going to make it possible.  I am going to be the new me tommorow - confident me, proud me, happy me.  I have wasted so much time being so unhappy just because I only looked on the negative side of things.  Tommorow is going to be different.  For the past couple days that I haven't wrote in my blog I can't remember what I did.  Stuff.  That describes it.  Today I went to go see The Perfect Score and yesterday night a watched a movie.  Of course that isn't all - it's just the rest of the stuff that I did - I can't exactly remember.

      Come to think ok it, life at times is good, at times great, and at times just plain frustrating.  Especially Bio right now.  It's suppose to be the "easiest" unit.  I don't find it easy.  I find it the hardest, most difficult, most confusing.  I feel kind of stupid actually for not understanding half of the stuff.  It's stuff we did like way back when, but I don't remember what I learned like five or four years ago.  I need structure and so far, there has been like none for this unit.  It's hard to learn that way and I am extremely worried about the quiz on Thursday.  I don't feel like I really understand anything too well.  Honestly I don't know how I am suppose to learn from a bunch of fill-in-the-blank-handouts.  That is not my thing.  Why does every damn thing have to be hard for me.  WHY CAN'T I JUST BE GOOD AT BIO?!?!  I don't get it, I mean there aren't very many areas I excel it.  Why is it that when I like something I always have to be confused by it.  Grrrrrr.  It's very, very, VERY, frustrating.  You would think I would be used to it by now, but let me tell ya that things never get easier.  They only get harder.  Ok so now I have gotten off my chest how hard I think Bio is right now, I might as well say how fun active living was today.  We did social/ballroom dance which was soooooooooo incredibly fun.  We learned the Cha Cha and Chataranga and some other things.  My partner and I were like so amazing at it!  The instructor always "borrowed" me from my partner to do demonstrations.  It was so fun and not too hard until like one step at the end.  I could do the guys steps and not the girls, lol.  So then Swain was like "ok, I will show you" and like omg I got to dance with him.  Ok so it was like under a minute, but he is seriously hot and good looking and a good dancer.  oh and I went to go see Secret Window tonight, which was good and Johney Depp is amazing.  Tomorrow is also going to be great cause I have rehearsal from 4-6 and well hopefully Bio won't be as stressful tomorrow as it seemed today.

      I'm finally sitting down, relaxing!  Listening to music, old music, good music - Ace of Base (Cruel Summer) and the new song My Immortal by Evanescence is really good and the song Breathe by Michelle Branch is good.  I have been out driving a lot.  I always drive out to Melissa's house in the N.W. all the time and I am getting way better at driving.  My mom even said I parallel parked better than her.  That is the first time I have ever heard my mother say something good about my driving.  I am worried about Bio now too.  I am doing "ok" in it, but this unit is suppose to be easy and like I find it confusing.  She keeps giving up worksheets and assignments and stuff but she hasn't taught us much about the unit.  So how am I suppose to know the answers?!?!  Also apparently marks have to be in at the end of next Friday, but I still don't know my English mark.  All I have to get is over 75%, that is it, then I am on distinction.  I worked hard all year, I deserve to be on there.  Hopefully I get nominated for Habits of Mind.  God and the world knows I deserve it.  No one nominated my last semester, and well someone is bound to nominate me.  Someone will and I know it, I know it in my heart that from the beginning of the year I deserved it, and I still do.

      Well I just finished doing my Drama assignment write-up thing on my comp.  Last night Edi and I went went for dinner.  He took me to Swiss Chalet, lol, and we had chicken and fries.  Then we fed each other a strawberry sundae.  Ok so it's HARD to loose weight though I have done it before.  And I am thinking that maybe genetically I am just not meant to be super thin.  So maybe instead of trying to loose weight I think I will try to maintain it instead.  And you know, be healthy.  Ok I confess I had dessert last night and some chocolate tonight, but it's not like I eat that everyday.  I also eat tons of fruit so yeah that makes up for it.  I didn't get over 80% on the Bio test, but I got 72%.  Even though it's not what I wanted, I don't feel bad for getting a 72% because I know that I did my very best.  I'm thinking that I may have ruined my chances of getting nominated by Swain for habits of mind cause last class before today I feel pressure to not participate a lot because none of the girls wanted to.  I know it was STUPID to not and I realize now, and I got an 85% in the unit instead of a possible 100%.  That is my fault though, my mistake and I have learned from it.  That is what counts.  So for now on I am going to try make it up, because I know that one day can't outweigh all of the other days.  I just pray SOMEONE nominates me.  PLEEEEEEAAAAAASSSSSSEEEEE!!!!!  Sometimes I feel like yelling that so freakin' loud.  Arg, someone needs to see that I WORK MY ASS OFF, in ALL that I do.  Ok so call me crazy, maybe I am.  However, I feel different.  I know everyone feels different and yes being different is good, but just different in how I learn and understand things.  I know I don't fail my classes, or hardly ever assignments (Chem is an exception) but what I don't think people realize is how stressful and frustrating it is trying to finish them, or even trying to understand.  I don't think I am stupid, that's not it, and the reason why my marks are maybe average or higher is because I work so hard.  I am no expert in this area, but I honestly think that I might have like a learning disability or something along those lines.  I've only told that to two people, one thought I was crazy, and then other one didn't but I don't know if I am paranoid of if maybe my instincts are right.  I was reading up on a lot of stuff about it and like a lot I can totally see in myself, except for the underachiement, but I need 120% effort just to do "ok" on things.  Like sometimes I will miss numbers or reverse letters, though it's not a very common occurrence.  However, when I copy from the board and then go back to my notes later I realize that I have either missing words, a sentence, or wrote the same thing twice.  I can read good, but when I finish reading I have no idea what I read, which makes novel study and Shakespeare really difficult.  I usually fail reading comprehension and not on purpose.  The harder I try to pass those tests, the worse I seem to fail, which explains why I am so scared for the English 30 diploma.  I have a hard time understanding directions, and that is especially evident when we do labs.  I hate labs because I never understand how to do them.  I struggle with understanding concepts in just about every area and it usually takes me longer to grasp a concept.  Sometimes I never understand the concept and we just keep going on.  I excel at Drama, and I'm pretty good at sports, but Math, English, Social, and Sciences are difficult.  I do manage to do good in most of them, but firstly it's cause of my hard work.  More then half of the content in social I didn't understand and still don't.  I would do poorly on the M.C. tests, and for the long answers I would not be able to understand the content.  What I had to do was write out the answers previous to the test and then memorize them.  When I would do the long answer I would write what I memorized, but then shortly after I would just forget.  I have this bad habit of forgetting names on things, but I think a lot of people do that.  Often when someone tells me something, shortly after I forget what they just said and I feel bad having to ask them again.    In Elementary I did very poorly and even then Math was especially hard and everyone blamed me for not trying hard enough.  I strongly remember that I couldn't tell time, but I of course can do that now and I recall trying to copy off of people during a math test on money because I didn't know how to count it.  Junior High was also a struggle but somehow I managed to do "ok."  I can do some simple math in my head now, but not a lot, and I still used my fingers to count certain numbers sometimes, but I don't make it very apparent cause if people saw me counting fingers they might look at me a little strange and think I am dumb.  Also it's not that big of a deal because we use calculators for practically everything nowadays.  I don't remember exactly why, but I remember working one-on-one with some lady when I was in grade 2 on math, and I think on math again in gr. 3.  In Elementary they have the resource room, which is were often I would go.  As far as I know I don't have a learning disability, and I think if I told someone else that I thought there was maybe something wrong they might think I am crazy or out of my mind.  I also don't like to admit it, but sometimes on quizzes and stuff I do need extra time.  I mean it takes me longer to do unit tests then most people, and well when someone asks "do you need more time" I usually say "no" because I don't want to admit it.  I like structured things, lessons, just structured ways of doing and learning things.  I think that is just more of my learning preferences though, and well when I color code my notes and underline stuff in my text I seem to to better.  I think forever this is like always going to puzzle me, just wondering about everything.  If I am right or wrong.  Last year I actually used to think I had some kind of brain disorder or something, but then I realized that IS crazy and like totally stupid, and I came to my senses.  Thinking that I have like learning differences or a learning disability I really don't think is stupid.

      The sleepover with the gals was really fun!  We all had dinner and then we played Cat-opoloy and Truth & Dare Jenga.  Then we watched a bunch of movies and ate and stuff.  Though I was doing really good with the healthy eating, I kind of ate some chocolate this weekend and "real" food.  So yeah I gained a little bit back, but I still weigh less then I did before.  Besides tomorrow it's back to healthy eating, and I'm going to try really hard again to loose some weight.  Just cause I blow my "diet" once, doesn't mean I have to let it drag me down.  Today was nice to have off, though after the gals left I studied Bio for the remainder of the day and then my mom came home, we watched a movie, ate supper, then I dropped off the movie and drove to Safeway to get more fruit.  Did I mention I crave fruit right now.  I am deprived!!  Strangely enough when I eat fruit the weight comes off, eat bread anything "carbs" then it just adds up.  Edi and I are going out for dinner on Wednesday night too, cause I am done my English and the Bio test is that day so I most likely won't have a lot of homework if any.  Though I am trying to loose weight, I will probably just get a salad.  Besides I will keep things cheap.  It just means that he spends less money.  And rule of thumb: guys are cheap.  My goals at the moment/for future include:   -Get Drivers License -Score 80% or higher on Bio test -Get over 80% in my English novel unit -Loose Weight -Get someone to nominate me for Habits of Mind because I DESERVE it and last semester no one nominated me -Make honors with Distinction -Make a new friend -Be a better friend -NOT get into any arguments -Look sexy -Have lots of fun with Edi -Maybe kiss Edi if it's right -Take up a new extra-curricular activity -Have a better attitude about things -I have TOO MANY goals to list!

      I haven't wrote in a while, at least of what I remember.  I have like retired from being at my comp all the time.  I have better things to do now.  Edi and I went to Starbucks for an over two hour date on tues and yesterday night we went out to the movies.  They didn't even ID me cause we went to an 18A movie.  It was amazing.  He is so mature and I will admit he is good looking.  We have another date this Wednesday night.  I am excited.  Everytime he comes over he always wants to go eat, but I have always eaten already so this time we planed it!  lol.  Oh and after the movie last night we rented another movie and went back to my place and watched it.  The Bio quiz was slightly difficult I though, but I did my best in really trying to understand that stuff.  It was just "ok" though.  I have been driving everywhere and practicing all the time.  It's getting easier.  Although I do notice that is has taken me like 3 times as long as most people to get the feel for it, and just to be good at it.  I have to admit I used to find it difficult, but now I find it really fun!  I went shopping today and yesterday.  I got these amazing capris from old navy.  Pink!!  I own pink capris!!!!!!  NO NAVY, NO WHITE!!  AHHA!  And I bought some black sandals and I got a shirt from The Rocket that says: "bubble cat."  It is so cute.  I also bought my bodysuit for underneath my costume for the play and I got the other part of chelseys b-day present.  It is really great and amazing, and I put so much effort into this present.  It's like a 3 part thing, but I ain't saying nothing here incase she happens to read this.  Did I mention I had a Wendy's salad for lunch yesterday and today.  YUM.  And tonight my sister, her fiance, her fiance's mother, and her fiance's mothers boyfriend are coming to celebrate my sisters b-day even though it's really on Monday.  Tomorrow morning I am going to check out the new value village in Midnapore Mall cause I have never been there and I have to practice parking.  Then Sara, Chels, Monet, and maybe Ash are coming over for dinner and then sleeping over.  I don't know when I am going to study for Bio, but I will find some time.  I suppose I could do some right now, but I need to relax a little.  I feel like I am just on the go all the time now.  But I kind of like being busy all the time.

I also drove to the N.W. today and to south centre, wendys, petland, dollar store, and a whole bunch of places.  Later on I am going to drive back to the N.W. to pick up my Dad.  Tomorrow, we are practicing my parking and I am going to book my road test.  That's right, I feel it's time.  It's time to take my Drivers Test.  I am going to book it for a time over spring break near the end, so the days off I can keep practicing and then do it!  I am so excited!

      So I guess you could say I have had quite the eventful life during the past couple days.  Yesterday was so busy for me.  In Drama we had a sub, and Bio I don't even remember what we did, I think it might have been the quiz that we did yesterday, and a lab.  Yeah I think that's it.  Then for active living we went off-campus and went bowling and I learned how to score keep for 10 pin.  It was actually not that hard and I am improving since last time we went, because I usually only do five pin, so 10 pin seems really odd.  Then Swain asked if I wanted to do volunteer hours for the leadership aspect of active living, and at first I didn't really want to, but then I said I would do it because I thought "might as well get it over with."  So I helped with admissions at the door from 4:15 PM - about 8:00 PM.  I actually never knew bball games could be that interesting to watch.  Then I went home and watched the most boring episode of Survivor ever and finished my Bio homework.  Today is going pretty good so far.  I am addicted to the Y.M.C.A.'s low fat muffins and their brown toast.  The food is sooooo good.  I also had the salad in which I have wanted to eat all week - my old classic Friday lunch - The Chicken BLT.  Yummmm.  Then when I got home I cleaned my room cause I was in the mood and well everyone else went to the movies, but my dad is in town for the weekend so I wanted to stay home.  Plus I didn't want to see that movie anyway.

      This morning really sucked.  I don't mean to be so negative, but a girl can't control what she feels.  In Drama, Carli and I had to do our Helen Keller scene over and over.  Mr. B told us each time what we could change or do differently.  So we tried it again and did something differently, but then he like took me to a corner and gave me more suggestions.  Then he was like "Vanessa sit in a chair over there and watch."  So I had to watch him do the scene.  It made me feel like he thought I was incapable of it or something like that.  It made me feel bad.  Maybe I just took constructive criticism the wrong way.  I mean I don't think that he thinks I am incapable, so I probably just took it the wrong way.  Bio was ok, except for the fact that I have difficulty reading graphs.  I mean I don't want to seem stupid or dumb, but like when I asked her about it, she explained it and well I still didn't understand.  Thank goodness I finished the assignment, finally!  And that is over.  Not to mention my head was pounding again.  I get headaches all the time now.  It was ok thought after I ate some lunch.  I think my body like needs certain foods or something, and if it doesn't get it, I get sick.  English was actually really good, and I got tons of work done!  Then in active living ALL the guys wanted ME on their team for floor hockey.  ME!  They were arguing over which team gets "Work Horse."  Some of the guys were like "whoa she's good" when we were playing, and another one was like "I commend you for what you can do, cause you're really good."  Another person was like "I can't get passed her, she blocks my shots before I can even get a chance to shoot."  Someone else was like "Hey she switched positions, she's playing offence.  She's got the whole package."  LOL!!!  OMG all those comments made me feel so good.  They made up for a lack of happiness throughout my day.  What started out as a bad day, turned out to be pretty good afterall!  I feel really good right now and I am ready to review some Bio for the quiz tomorrow.  And today I recall myself saying that I wasn't smart.  Well you know what I am a hard worker and I AM SMART.  If I wasn't smart, then I wouldn't be on the honor roll.  I AM SMART, and I should not put myself so low, as to say that I am not.  Cleary I AM.

      Today was actually really good.  Drama was fun even though Sam wasn't there and she is CRUCIAL to my mark because we have not been able to rehearse our Helen Keller scene that we are doing in like forever.  Everyone seemed to like my skirt today, so it was nice cause everyone kept complimenting me.  Bio was really fun and we did a lab, and it was really interesting.  Mr. Proux I think marked me absent yesterday and he was like "ok who is your Ta?" and I was like "Radomski" and he was like "Well tell her to jump in a river because I don't make mistakes.  The only mistake I ever made was getting married, but it's ok now because I've trained her."  LOL!  By the way active living was boring - basketball - that explains it all.

      My head hurts like a %&$!@ right now!  It's been pounding since English.  No one knows how much it sucks to try listen in English when your head feels like it is ready to explode.  I felt sick this morning after eating breakfast, but once I ate lunch I was better.  For A. Living we went off-campus and we got to go bowling which is really fun.  I am sort of upset with the English teacher right now because he was telling us that we should have finished lots of the questions that we had in these booklets that he gave us, and that he said is "assumed" most people had finished the book.  Well earth to Mr. Proux but:   I CAN'T READ MINDS!!!   He never told us what questions to do, and never even mentioned what chapter we were to read up to.  That makes me mad, but whatever.  Things are the way they are.  Finally someone talked to me about just ANYTHING!  You know, other then just normal friends.  Mrs. J is amazing and one of the people I look up to.  We had quite the interesting convo during tutorial.  She is the only person who takes interest in aspects of my life.  A lot of other people do really care, but she cares and she's really cool.

      Today I think I ate more pancakes then I have in the last six months.  I consumed more peanut butter today then I have in an entire year.  You know what else.  I reviewed my Bio - interesting stuff.  Now I want to be a Biochemist if teaching Bio fails, but most likely I will be a teacher.  I also finished my amazing Drama project, which I am certain it's my 110% best work.  I also come to a realization today.  I guess you could say a feeling came over me.  I just feel ready.  Feel like I know more now.  I feel smart, or more mature, or older, or I guess you could just say "ready."  That's what I feel.  I feel I a ready to drive, to get my license.  I should have waited before doing drivers ed, but whatever, it doesn't matter.  My dad flys in on Friday.  I am going to talk to him about takin drivers with a diff company and doing the stuff again.  I think doing the drivers course again would benefit me a lot.  I am almost certain he won't have a problem with it.  I all of a sudden want to drive, and be free, and just drive.  Strange feeling.

      Yesterday I just wanted to rip my phone out of the wall.  I was watching School of Rock and like the phone would ring - I would pick it up.  Then I would sit down and two seconds later - the phone would ring.  This went on for a couple of minutes!!  I wasn't exactly feeling up to par yesterday either.  I was a bit under the weather for some odd reason.  All I wanted to do was lie in my bed all day.  I was really tired too and I kept thinking about everything that I am worried about.  I did watch another movie last night too.  I watched The Missing but it was really boring.  I think today I might do some review for Bio and make sure my Drama project is ready to go, because he is such a hard marker.  This morning I kept thinking about Habits of Mind.  Kept wondering why I wasn't nominated.  As much as I say to everyone that I am over the fact, the truth is it still bothers me that no one nominated me.  I just don't understand why not.  Of course life is not fair, and that is just the way it is going to be.  However, I felt like I put in so much effort last semester.  More effort then I have ever put in.  That is why it leaves me so stumped, confused, and puzzled.  It leaves me in questioning.  Now since I wasn't nominated I use tutorials way less these days and I feel as if though no one notices that I work hard.  I'm sure lots of people do know that I work hard, but I don't think they see it or know how hard.  Maybe that is why no one nominated me.  I'm hoping that Swain will give me a nomination though because I feel like I am working so hard in A. Living and I know that he can see that.    I am not sure as for Bio though because I study a lot at home, and try to understand the material but have not gone to any tutorials.  That is only because I understand the info though, that is why.  I don't think she would nominate me again this year though.  I don't feel like I have anything special or stand out.  Of course that is slightly being negative towards myself and doubting myself, which I should not do because I am better than that.  The most important thing I learned from LaCour was to not to doubt myself because it's demeaning and degrading, if you think you can do something and believe in yourself, it's likely anything is possible.

      After school ended, I went out for lunch with Travis.  I got a taco salad and he go fries and some chicken burger thing.  Then we played lots of XBox games which was nice cause I don't own many and plus I hardly ever have time to play.  We also watched Finding Nemo and got Hawaiian pizza for dinner.  Though I was still hungry after so I also had a bowl of cereal and some crackers with peanut butter.  I think I am growing or something, cause lately I have been one to just down food and the numbers on the scale are slightly going down though I keep eating like a hulk.  I miss having Chem, but I know lots of people dropping 30.  Scary, scary, thought.  I guess I am not them though and I shouldn't be too concerned if I am not taking chem til' next year, but of course I am going to be a bit worried.  I am doing a lot better in Bio, then I did in Chem though.  The biochemistry stuff we are doing now is so interesting and it seems simple because I learned lots of the stuff in Chem so it's not the difficult.  I want to try do really good on the next quiz and I know I can get an 80% on the unit test.  I want to prove to myself and the world that I am cabable of such things.  I haven't failed anything in Bio yet.  I came close on the nitro/phos quiz, but I thought it was extremely hard.  Now that I have been stressed last semester, now that I have done Chem, it seems to be paying off.   Chemistry + Being stressed out -------> A good and hardworking Bio student     My goals right now are:  -Score 100% or close to in on the next Bio quiz, because I CAN -Get 80% on the Bio unit test -Finish memorizing my lines for the play -Try to pass my English reading comp because it's hard but I CAN do it -Be a better person, nicer, kinder, wiser -Eat healthy so I can loose some more weight

      My lunch was like a balanced equation today.  Apple + Banana + Hot Dog + Cranberry Loaf  -------->  A semi-balanced/semi-healthy lunch  Ok I ate a lot, but whatever.  Live life a little.  I can't always be dieting and staving and trying to look thin all the time.  Maybe genetically I am just not meant to be thin.  In Bio we did a chromatography lab, but our groups really honestly sucked!  We only got like a yellow color, and barely any orange.  She told us that we had to staple our chromatography paper to our sheets when we hand them in too.  I don't even know if my group kept ours, cause I am not the one who put the stuff away.  I don't think the others in our group know the names of me and Amanda.  Whatever will be, will be I guess.  I still think I did like really amazing on that last quiz though so I will keep my hopes high.  Drama was pretty fun today, like usual, but I only got a 75% on my warm-up.  He just has to be such a hard marker doesn't he.  Drama was my thing though, it is my thing.  Something that I was talented at, something that I am talented at.  Thought I don't deserve a 75% but there will other things I suppose.  Other opportunities for marks.  I do have to remember that he is a hard marker.  But still, it was better then that.  Life seems just like going through the motions right now.  I mean I talk at school (except in Bio - I'm like miss queen of silence) and well I laugh, socialize, do plenty of things.  But it just seems like I am going through the motions of everyday life.  That's what I fee like ever time I get home.  It's hard to explain.  I mean I struggle with a lot of things in my life, but now that Chen is over I don't struggle as much with everything.  I guess what I am saying that that before life was unpredictable.  *Will I fail the next test, or will I pass*  You know that kind of thing.  Now I can basically predict the future - what will happen - what will take place.  You name it.  There are a lot more things I can predict now.  I think I like life more when it's just random.  When it throws curves in your path when you least expect it and you have challenge to over come.  It may stress you out, make you cry for hours on and off, but in the end it is all worth it.

      I swear by the fact that I did really good on that Bio quiz today.  I knew everything on it.  Of course it's cause I studied til' my brain was wired to tap into my stored Biology information hiding somewhere in my mind.  Strangely enough we had a sub for Bio today even though our actual teacher was there.  Some meeting or something she had to go to, but like they should seriously make these meetings outside of class time.  Obviously I don't like substitutes, though the lady we had today wasn't bad.  She was actually pretty nice.  In Drama, since Megz did her warm-up yesterday she got to choose who got to go today.  Megz chose me, so I did my warm-up and everyone liked it and found it really fun.  And once again, everyone applauded to ME!     I am beginning to really think I like a lot of attention, of course being a Leo that is understandable.   In Active Living we just played basketball, which I find kind of boring.  I can't wait til' we get to new units.  I think on Monday though we are going off campus again, at least that is what I have heard.  Apparently we are suppose to be going bowling, so that should be really fun!  In English we didn't do much, and right now we are doing novel study and reading Ethan Frome.

      Bio I think I totally have things under my belt.  When she was reviewing the stuff from the previous days I knew every single answer.  I studied last night, so that could be why.  Of course I always so study and am going to study more tonight.  However, I know I can do good on that quiz tomorrow.  I know that I know the stuff, I just have to be confident and not bomb this quiz like that nitro/phos quiz.  That was hard.  Though it was cause of the wording that I did bad.  I knew all the info, just didn't understand what was being asked.  Drama was fun today and English is so much better now that we are doing novel study.  I'm reading Ethan Frome.  It's actually pretty interesting so far.  We had open gym in Active Living today and about 12 of us played some games of volleyball.  That was my dad.  Nothing too exciting I suppose.  I can't wait for tomorrow though, I have all this info stored into my brain for tests.  It needs to be unleashed!!  - By the way our theatre is haunted!  Like no joke.  Megz and I were in there working on some scene work and like every couple minutes there would be whistling.  We thought it was just someone on the catwalk, but Mr. B checked and there was no one there.  Lets say I wanted to get out of there fast!  It didn't help that most of the theatre was dark because the house lights were off.

      I guess today was good.  I didn't talk a lot though.  Drama was fun, but I thought Mr. B was being bit of a touch critic today, but whatev.  I know the Megz and I did a good job.  Bio was alright but at first I thought this handout thing that we got was like really hard.  I guess maybe I shouldn't assume so much, because once I tried the stuff and had a better attitude about it, it seemed to be a lot easier.  At lunch Ash and Chels just talked about stupid work ignoring the fact that I don't know the people they work with.  So basically I sat there for a very long time not saying a word.  Oh what a great lunch!  NOT!  Anyways English was nice cause we switched to novel study and now I have Proux (I think that's how to spell it) and like today was so nice for English cause he actually taught!  Unlike the classes I had before with Schamber.  In Active Living we played boring basketball.  I seriously should of signed up for rugby, should-of, could-of, but didn't.  So I will just have to deal with a sport I done like for a while, that I can deal with.    I keep hearing all about chem 30.  It's starting to freak me out.  I was talking to Thy and she told me she is going to drop Chem 30 cause she got 35% on the unit test.  Reminder:  Thy had a higher average than me in Chem 20.  Ok so thinking about that....I'M SCARED.  It doesn't matter if I don't have Chem 30 now, cause next year I will.  So yeah I have heard LOTS of stories about chem.  I suppose I should worry about what I have to deal with now actually.  I'm going to review my Bio some more tonight.  I am very determined to do good.

      Play rehearsals are tiring me out.  We went from 4:00 - 6:30 today and on Wednesday we start the 4:00 - 7:00 rehearsals and other days we have some late night rehearsals from 7:00 - 900.  Not to mention that I have to miss three days next week to attend the High School Drama Festival at the U of C.  I am never sick and like I don't know how to catch up on missed work because I never really miss school.  I am going to have to find out the Bio work we have to do.  I don't want to miss Bio and at this point and I can't afford to.  I did bad on the last test - which yes I am still like killing myself over cause I didn't want to do that bad.  I can't even review the damn thing cause not everyone has written it and our Bio teacher is organizing the grad stuff or whatever it is.  Grrrrrrrrrr.  So frustrating.  Just goes back to my statement that no one ever has any time for anything.  I am still very sick of everyone condemning me for not understanding something or just plainly not knowing the answer.  Like leonard today I was like "yeah we have a lab in Bio today" and like that is ALL I said, nothing more and you know what he says to me.  He says "omg this is the easiest shit ever, that isn't anything freakin' hard Vanessa."  Like there we go again, I didn't even say it was hard, but then again making me feel stupid seems like the most popular game to play.  Even Brent asked me a question in Bio and I don't know what everyone seems to expect me to have ever damn answer.  When I told him "I don't know" all he says is "I thought you were suppose to be smart."   Hmmm so here is the message I seem to be getting: No one ever has anytime, people feel good about themselves when I do bad on things, and I happen to be dumb.  Ok so we both know that isn't true but sometimes after hearing the repeptitive negativity towards me I begin to think it is.  But it is not.  I can't let that get to my head.  I need positive self-talk.  If I learned any lesson from Chem last term it's to believe in yourself.  To think: VANESSA YOU CAN DO IT.  And yes I can do it, I can do anything, I am capable of anything.  That is what I must say to myself.  Deep down I know it to be true.  I am the girl with so many dreams.  Dreams of going to University and majoring in a science like Bio and becoming the most inspiring wonderful teacher.  I have the ability to pass Bio and do good in Bio.  For some unexplainable reason like so many things seem so difficult that cry over all the time, but I have got to where I am right now somehow.  I am here right now, on Honors w. Distinction.  I must have done something right.  I suppose that something might be hard work, effort, work ethic, whatever you want to call it.  I shouldn't listen to what others say *unless it's positive, lol* because I am so much better than that.  I am better to call others dumb or stupid or tell them that everything should be easy for everyone.  If anyone knows how difficult things can get at times that would be me.

      Call me the carb queen because that's what I am.  All I did was eat carbs and chocolate today.  Ok so I confess I ate junk all weekend.  Chocolate here and chocolate there but tomorrow I am going to eat really healthy and try keep it up for the entire week.  Also there is so really good news.  We went to the Saturn dealership today just to look around at some cars in the lot and next time my dad comes in we are going back to the dealership and I am pretty sure he is trading in our van and getting the L300 series for him and my Mom and buying me a used.  We saw a REALLY really nice 2001 LS-200 today which was like so nice and my dad checked up on it and said he really liked it and stuff.  NO ONE BETTER BUY THAT CAR OR ELSE.  It's my car...!!!  It is just like the car I drove for drivers ed (Is that like totally freaky or what?!?) and well it's the same color too.  It's like a really nice light blue color.  I love it!  Hardly anyone has cars like that and the interior is great.  And since I drove a car like it for Drivers Ed, I know where most of the things are in the car.  I want it so bad but my dad doesn't come in for another two weeks.  He is heading back to Vacouver tonight and it's his b-day tomorrow.  My mom also said that if he buys me a car then she is going to buy me a cell phone.  I was in a state of shock when she told me this.  I mean I have asked and asked and asked to the point on no return and now she is practically offering me one.  I guess she is right that I do need one.  She needs to be able to contact me at times and in case I need to call CAA/AMA then I am going to need it.  Like "YES!" if I get a a car then it is guaranteed that I will get a cell and she is paying the bill though I can't rack up charges but that is not something I would do on purpose anyways.  I still have to come up with a play for how to pay for gas but I do have money saved in the bank for a while that should last me a while.  My dad asked "If I buy you a car and everything, Melissa payed for gas, so I would expect you to pay for gas too, so would you buy your own gas."  And of course knowing how badly I want a car I said "yes" because I have a lot of money now but depending on how much I use the car, gas could become quite expensive.  I don't have a job for incoming money either.  I know long ago I used to work at Perkins but I couldn't keep up with the demands of school and work.  So now when I apply for jobs I put I am only available from Friday to Sunday.  No one ever calls me back when I apply places that I actually do want to work.  There is nothing wrong with my resume.  Employers just think that your only life should be work.  No offence though I am not one to go pick and choose.  I just need a BALANCE of school and work, though to employers the word 'balance' is almost unheard of.  All they seem to want these days is someone who is available 24/7.  They don't care how much experience you have, how qualified you are, or nice you are.  Plain and simple, they are going to hire the people that have a wider range of availability than those that don't.  And well if actually wanting some time to focus on school and continue to do well is interfering with getting hired or a job then whatever.  It's just sad that people put more emphasize on stuff like that, than actually caring about the things that really matter.  So to sum things up:  My dad bought me a laptop, I might get a car (though eventually forsure get one), and then a cell phone.  Hmmm I begged for all these things before and the answer was always no, no, no.  Slowing it changed to maybe, maybe, maybe.  Not it's a probably, probably, probably.  I have stopped bagging, stopped asking.  I am slowly but surely getting what I want.  I suddenly feel very lucky.  And I am very lucky.

      More problems seem to arise today.  More so within my head.  My thoughts seem to be taking over or something cause it's really affecting the way I am feeling.  Flames lost today but whatev, the fight Iginla had was entertaining to watch and made up for their boring loss.  I keep eating like all the food in the damn house.  Maybe cause it seems to make up for all the damn feelings I have.  You know I do want to loose more weight, but then once I loose some I decide I am happy the way I am.  So then I eat what I want and then I get scared that I am going to gain weight.  I don't want to say I am obsessed, but really I think that is closer to the truth.  I weight myself AT LEAST 3 times on weekdays and AT LEAST 5 times a day during weekends.  I can't stop.  And my mom always buys a whole bunch of food that I really don't need and well I always go out to eat.  Actually now that I think of it, Thursday I went to Boston Pizza, Friday I went to moxie's before rehearsal (I have lots to say about how the play is going so far) and it's my Dad's b-day on Monday but he won't be in town because he is flying back to Vancouver so I am also going out to eat tonight.  Not to mention that I ate practically anything and everything that has the word 'chocolate' in it in my freezer, we also had like ten thousand doughnuts during rehearsal on Friday.  So I would have the say that the play is like the highlight of my life right now.  I honestly wish I had signed for Soccer or something.  I miss playing it all the time and I am always stuck inside my lonely boring house.  I feel so anti-social like I have no friends.  I need to do something active - NEED...!  *Not a want* My mom is always working and every time that my dad flys in from Vancouver he always goes to Ben and Melissa's to work on their new house.  I feel so abandoned if you know what I mean.  I know my parents do love me, but they never have any time for anything.  No time to just talk and stuff.  I even have some doubts about who are really my friends.  You know during the Thursday of TAPS (by the way I made honors W. Distinction cause I worked my ass off) well see I have invited everyone but Travis to my house for lunch (Trav and I got in a fight therefore I didn't invite him) and so at first they were all like "yeah we will come" and then strangely the only people who came over were Chels and Sarah.  I mean I was glad that I didn't have to cook and clean as much but that really makes me wonder.  What was more important than me.  Apparently they were going to go to Extreme Pita for lunch.  That makes no sense.  I mean I have the vehicle and I could of driven them all and lunch would have been free.  That makes me feel like Chels and Sarah are my only true older friends.  I am becoming much closer to those that came from other J.H. schools then the one I came.  I feel as though older friends aren't so much like the people I would most likely be lifelong friends with.  Infact I still keep in touch with Brit that goes to Scarlett and well Megz and I declared that we will rule in Drama-Queenism 4ev :) and well I like Lindsey, Allyse, Margaret, Maria, Jess, Brit, Kenda, Bianca, Kirrie, Palavi, Erin, Kristen, and even Carli, Alison, and Jason and so many more people.  I mean I still like my old friends (most of them) because I have known them for so long but I think I am a very different person.  I don't really enjoy lunch hours with them either.  It's not fun or cool, it's just boring and I honestly find them immature.  I feel that I am like ten steps above em.  I mean Ash is nice, but honestly sometimes acts and dresses like more of guy.  By all means though that is just her so I can't really change that, but I think Ash and I will be really good friends for a long time because we both thrive off of cheering the Flames and thriving off Soccer.  Of course Chels and I forever will be friends, I mean that is a given.  I saw her at Safeway this morning and actually gave her a ride home.  And well possibly friends with Sarah.  I do like the rest of the people but I feel as though as high School progresses we are just growing more apart and more now than ever we seem very different.  Ah yes I also forgot (don't know how I could forget this but I did) what Leonard said to me about Bio.  You know maybe that is why I am like beating myself up for doing bad on it.  Well first of all I DO feel stupid because it was suppose to be like the easiest unit and like it was my worst.  That is also why it was so difficult to ask is she could go over it with me sometime, but I know that if I know now what I did wrong then I won't make the same mistake and if I want to make a career out of Bio I have to take it very seriously.  So anyways Leonard walks into T.A. one day and I was just looking over some Bio before the test and he was like "What are you doing" and I was like "Just reviewing my Bio so I don't screw anything up and I really want to do good on the test."  Then he went ahead and said "OMG I can't believe your actually going over that stuff, it's so easy, it's stuff that they talk about on The Magic School Bus."  I was so hurt by the comment, actually it still disturbs me because I remember it so damn well.  I've heard it before 'Don't listen to those kind of people' but how do you just "not-listen."  It's like everytime I find something hard or difficult that most people find easy everyone has to condemn me and make me feel so low.  It's not a very good feeling quite honestly.  I actually remember what Ms. LaCour said to me way back when I was reviewing for the Chem final.  She started off by saying "You have done so good" but we both know that I failed ALOT of things, so I was like "Well I failed a lot, I don't exactly consider that good" and then she said "Yeah but your work ethic is amazing."  That was the first time I felt that something she said truly and deeply came from the heart.  Sometimes being smart isn't everything and sometimes people who have to work for things work so hard that whatever their goals are, they always seem to accomplish them one way or another.  I am sure there is so much more that has happened over the past Spring Break and then some, but I guess if I don't remember the rest than it doesn't really affect me too much.  For Active Living Off Campus we went top rope climbing one day which I honestly hope I don't have to do again because heights scare the living day lights out of me.  One day we also went to archery (sp??) which was neat to try but no something I would probably even do again.  I think I will stick to being the amazing soccer player that I am, I don't have 14 medals for nothing.  Oh yeah I also forgot about the play.  I guess it's going really well.  We sold a lot of tickets already, but not everyone has their lines down pat so that is a little frightening since we start full runs at the end of next week and Wednesday we start the late night rehearsals for we go from 4:00 PM - 7:30 PM.  My entire life is going to be Drama - literally.  He expects so much too.  And well I honestly wish I had more lines in the play, but like I am a faerie so I dance a lot but dance ain't really my thing.  I think I am a better actress than dancer but you know what, if he cast me as a faerie then he must have belief in me for that part.  I have belief and confidence in myself too.  Friday's rehearsal never seemed to end though and I was so energy drained afterwards.  After Megz, Kirrie, and I went to Moxies for lunch we walked back to the school cause Friday rehearsals begin at 2:30 PM.  Then we rehearsed til like 6:10 PM or maybe even a bit later.  It was a LONG LONG night but I still once everything comes together it will be amazing.  All of our hard work and effort is bound to pay off.  I just really hope that everything with Drama and stuff doesn't interfere with my other classes *cough* Bio cause doing good in Bio is higher on my list and things that mean ALOT to me.  My goals, my dreams they are everything to me.  I cannot image doing anything else but teaching.  It is my passion.  ok anyways getting slightly off-topic yeah I just really hope the play goes well and well with the amout of work, time, and effort we are putting it it should be a good show.  Though in May I have so many things coming up.  There is:  May 1: Melissa's Mount Royal Grad Dinner May 5-7: High School Drama Festival & Rehearsal (Miss School those days) May 8: Weekend Rehearsal to make sure we are prepared May 10: Showing of a Mid Summer Night's Dream to J.H. Drama classes (Miss afternoon classes) May 11-14: Mid Summer Night's Dream Showings (No life for four nights but Drama) May 18: Drama performances at Father Whelihan (Miss afternoon classes) May 29: Melissa's Wedding  Ok wow, busy huh??  And between all that I some how have to fit time in for rehearsals for the play, and doing homework and studying.  When my dad comes in another weekend he is also taking me a whole bunch of places because we are looking for a car to buy me.  I think most of the things I need to get off my chest are free now.

      Thank God my dad bought me a laptop cause my comp. just decided it would shut down because you know when I needed the most to write in my journal that just had to happen.  Things have been really rough lately.  No one has any time to listen to my problems.  I cried so much over Bio last night while trying to watch the hockey game.  I did really bad on my Bio test, at least for wanting to major in it.  And so then I wonder and think, and really do feel that Bio is the last thing that I totally don't completely suck at.  Worst of all I heard her say that is was the easiest until.  Well easiest for who???  I thought it was the most difficult and did the worst in it, so that especially makes me feel really stupid.  People that admitted they didn't study were like "oh I'm really surprised I got an 80."  IT'S NOT FAIR!  I studied so hard, I mean I always study alot and I knew the concept questions really well.  They always say that if you can answer the concept questions then you will do good on the test.  Well yeah right...did I do the questions - yes, did I do good on the test - no.  See what I mean.  I feel like I did my best.  When I do tests I put my best effort forward and I just feel like I put 110% in the first time and I can't do better.  When I tell people that they just tell me that I am being too hard on myself and too negative.  They don't understand.  I SERIOUSLY DID MY VERY BEST, and the same goes for reading comprehension tests in English.  Everytime I really believe in my mind that this time I can pass, I always end up failing.  I mean of course I feel like I can't do reading comp very well because I just can't!!!  People always tell me don't have this attitude, but they have no idea how much I study for Bio and how important it is to do good in English - yet no matter the circumstances I still seem to screw things up.  I did however ask if there was a re-write in Bio and she said that possibly at the end.  And instead of just ignoring the test I did really I did really bad on, I am going to go over it with her hopefully sometime near the end of next week.  If I figure out where I am going wrong now then I think university might seem a little bit easier.  I also think I could of done better on the test in my comp had been working.  My computer is my outlet.  The one think that has to accept what I say and write no matter what.  The one thing that has no choice but to listen.  The one friend who is always there.  Everyone else works, or goes out, or is never home, or doesn't want to listen to me.  There is more I have to write.  I have been letting all my feelings and emotions build during the time that I didn't have internet.  Now I have so much to get off of my chest.  I am slowly starting to feel better already.  I have more to write but I still want to explore some of the new features of my new laptop so I -will continue with the rest of the very long 'What-has-happened-and-what-I-have-been-feeling-over-the-past-week-and-then-some" journal entry.

      I picked up Chels today and we went to the White Spot for brunch for her B-day and she opened her presents and she really liked them.  Then we were going to go see a movie but my Dad needed the van so we just went to the mall for a while and then I drove Chels home.  It was neat today and really cool.  I feel so independent.  It was just Chels and I in the vehicle - It was cool and I drove by myself for a while too like before I picked her up and just after I dropped her off.  I love driving.  It's so much fun!!!  Yesterday I also ate hard turkey!  LOL.  See my Mom was cooking it and she put in the thermometer that measures turkey and stuff and like it was way lower than it should be to be done but we had been waiting til seven at night so my Mom just cut off the top layers and put it in the microwave for like four minutes.  My turkey was hard!  It was good though and well at least it was food!  Also I love that song by Lindsey Lohan (Drama Queen/That Girl) It's sooooo good!!  She is like one of my newest role models.  So basically my main ones are:  Britney Spears, Hilary Duff, Lindsey Lohan, and some other people that I have met throughout my lifetime.

      I PASSED!!!  Yeah ok so that wasn't that bad and now I can drive on my own.  This is great.  See now I can pick Chels up to go out for Breakfast on Monday and we can go alone!  I feel independent.  For once I did something right the first time.  Though it took my 3 tries to get my parallel perfect.  The first time I was too far, the 2nd I was too close and I hit the curb so I lost some points there, and the last time it was perfect.  I didn't even have time to merge because it took forever to parallel but I still passed and I only got 40 points deducted.  Tonight I get to go out for Chinese!!!!  OMG that is all I have been doing - EATING!!  But whatever, I look good and besides I am on top of the world right now.  Passed my test and pretty sure I made Distinction, hmmm not much more I want cept a good mark on the next Bio test!  LOL!

      I am sick.  Woke up today and felt very sick, and now I sound sick.  Sick again during holidays, like that's nothing new.  It's official, I dumped Edi but I mean we are still going to go out and still going to be friends.  It comes down to the fact that we have a bit of an attraction for each other, but we are very different.  Our lifestyles and just what we like to do, what we would prefer, and just the way we were brought up.  Everyone is different, but there is a point to draw the line.  My Grandma is coming in from Winnipeg today and she is going be like "oh poor you, your sick" and I don't like it when people feel sorry for me when I'm sick!  And then wait til' she finds out someone stole my wallet.  Luckily my YMCA membership expires at the end of the month, and I had not renewed my library card, I don't care so much about the money but I had more than usual in there cause I was saving it up and was going to put it in the bank when I got the chance.  I got a new learners and my road test is tomorrow and *PLEASE GOD, I PRAY TO YOU HELP ME TO PASS* and I bought a new school ID, and went to the bank and got a new card issued and all that is left is to get a new S.I.N. card.  I didn't realize how important my wallet was to me until it was gone.  And Megz had her Cd's stolen - one of them I know she said was Lord of the Dance.  OK, so like right there that limits it down to a girl cause honestly what kind of guy would want to steal a Lord of the Dance Cd, like really?!?!  I think it might have been Jenna.  I don't want to blame or accuse, but everytime she shows up and then leaves something is always gone!!!  Hmmmm, coincindence - I think not!  And she does Celtic dance, so that would explain why she would want to steal Lord of the Dance.  I don't trust her.  And on Friday during rehearsal she was like "Yeah I think Mr. B keeps candy in his office" so she went into his office and got some candy.  I was thinking 'You have no right to go in there!'  This holiday I am just going to enjoy my food and try to keep under 145.  I keep eating the paska my mom bought and she keeps buying more....ahhhh!  Satuday it's Chinese, then monday Chels and I are going to the White Spot for Breakfast/Brunch and maybe a movie if we have time, but if not then the movie will be another day.  Also I am going from 9-12 on Tues. and Wed. to help put together the set for the play and thurs we are getting together to shop for make-up.  I went to the mall today and finally found some zodiac t-shirts and tanks!  I have been wanting one forever!  Also I got a red sleeveles turtleneck tank think with a black skirt for my sisters Mount Royal grad.  And like EVERYTHING is happening in May.  Like there is the: High School Drama Festival, Sisters Grad, Sisters Wedding, J.H. Performance for Drama, Mid Summer Nights Dream running for four nights.  I am going to have like hardly anytime for studying or anything!  It's gonna be crazy.  tomorrow I just really hope I pass my drivers test.  I have practiced so much and I just want to do something right for once on the first try.

      It's hard to believe I never seem to make it to the computer anymore.  I never have any time for anything!  I guess that might be a good thing.  My life is exciting, filled with excitement, and I am almost certain that I made it onto Honors w. Distinction.  Most of this week after school I have had rehearsal for the play.  Actually everyday except Wednesday.  However my wallet got stolen with money and all my cards so I have been doing lots of running around and then I had to file a police report to get a case number so I could get my learners cause I have my road test on Saturday.  Lots of running around!  Then next week I think I am going to the school a couple days because the Mid Summer Nights Dream cast is putting together the set and I think Megz, Justine, Jenna, Mandy, and I are going to finish all the dances.  So yeah I am a busy girl and filled with like tons of chocolate right now!!  That is like all I have had all week, but honestly it tastes good and it doesn't matter what I look like.

      Yesterday was like the day of chocolate - seriously!  In the morning they were giving out those hershey kisses so I had some and then in Bio I had a chocolate cookie, then in English Megz was like "hey, want to share smarties" so I had some of those, and then when I was leaving school they gave out more chocolate.  OK so yeah you would think that is the end of my lovely I-ate-chocolate-all-day-story but nope it goes on.  So then I got soup and a sandwich at tims and I got the combo that comes with coffee, but I didn't want coffee so I got hot chocolate.  Then I don't have any idea why I ate dinner last night cause I wasn't hungry but I think I was just emotionally eating.  So yeah I ate like yogurt, a granola bar, crackers w/ peanut butter, and a plate of chile.  Yeah ok so that is it right - nope.  Then after I drove to my sisters and stuff and picked up their clothes I drove to timmy's cause my mom wanted to get a gift certificate and some tea and so I got a donut - with chocolate on the top.  It was my first time driving through the drive through too!  Then I want through Wendy's drive through and got some lemonade and I saw Edi there.  I really have to cut back on the chocolate though.  I was doing so good eating healthy and then my bad habits just creeped back.  I can just try again though.  It's been hard with the rehearsals for the play though because I have been eating bigger lunches cause we got during the week 4:00-6:00 and friday 2:30 - 4:30, next thurs we get off early and so I think he said we are going from 12:30 - 2:30.  Then Edi came over after work and we talked for like four hours.  Everything was going good until his kiss.  I mean c'mon it was first kiss.  To be honest it was not enjoyable at all.  It was totally disgusting.  I expected a little kiss on the lips, but he like sucked the bloodly life out of me.  When he started kissing me her was like trying to like get his tongue in my mouth or something.  It was nasty.  I had a vision of a reptile kissing me.  I called it "the lizard kiss" cause it literally was like kissing some lizard trying to like get my tounge.  I finished my homework this morning, yay!  I actually had homework this weekend, but this morning I actually really had nothing to do.  So I finished my Bio, did Drama, and I am done my English though it is not due.  All I have to do before Wednesday is know my lines for our bonus scene we are doing for Drama.  Tonight I am going to Mat's house for a get together thing for his b-day with a bunch of my friends and we are having dinner and probably watching movie's and stuff tonight.

      Well today was better than I expected.  Afterall the Bio quiz wasn't as scary as I thought, and I am pretty sure that I did good on it.  Although the little experiment thing we did I found like really confusing, so I had to ask Brent after class about it cause I had no idea what was going on.  After like 5 explanations from him I finally understood it, and afterall it wasn't as hard as it seemed.  That is why I didn't ask the teacher in the first place.  Sometimes I feel that I am just annoying, always asking questions, though maybe I am just super paranoid.  English was good.  We finished watched Good Morning Vietnam and now we are watched Billy Elliot for film study.  Though I am kind of worried cause on the ucourses site my average shows up as 0% with a comment mark entered.  Everyone knows I don't have 0 and when I asked my base teacher what I got she told me that I had an 84%, and well prouxl told me that something about the English is messed up because on another girls it said she had 15%.  Yeah, there is definitely something wrong.  Active living was amazing today.  We did social/ballroom dance today.  Yesterday we did break dance and I got to go in the break dancing circle!  It was soooo much fun!  Anyways today I swear it was like guys fighting over me.  I would start dancing with one, and Swain said that if a guy tapped the other on the shoulder, they had to kindly exchange partners.  Guys kept trying to dance with me, and this one creep kept trying to come back, but whatever.  Maybe he liked me or something, I suppose there is really nothing wrong with having a crush on a someone.  Also Swain pulled me over and was like "I want to show you something" and I was like "oh goodness what are you going to do?"  Then we had to like hook arms and "sway" into a certain position ready for the dance.  I did it once and then he was like "ok now if you could just flow a bit more and loosen up"  OMG, it was like so odd, but I like dancing with him.  And ok I can officially say that I danced with the gym teacher.  So I guess I am entitled to think a teacher is hot right...cause like damn Swain is an amazing dancer and he is hot.  Shhh....!  No telling, that is my little secret.  After school we did a read through of the play during rehearsal and then I went home, ate some Chile and did my Bio homework.  How exciting!  LOL.

      Oh how I wish I did better on my Bio test.  I thought I got like an 80% and in my mind that is still what I KNOW I deserve.  I mean 73% isn't that bad.  It wouldn't be bad if I didn't study, but I studied like it was a matter of life and death for this test.  I want so badly to raise my Bio mark.  It's so frustrating just trying and trying.  People who don't even study score like what I score on tests.  It's not fair, not that life ever was but WHY WHY WHY?!?!?!?!  I want to major in Bio.  Can't God make me great, amazing, and talented in Bio.  Just something other than Drama, please!!!!  Sometimes I just feel like my effort goes to no where and it makes me question why I study in the first place.  It's cause of my goals and dreams, the places I want to go.  It's because I like Bio and I am going to be a Bio teacher no matter what.  The world knows I have the work ethic.  I certainly have that, it's just higher marks would be nice.  Sppp...Hear that God...I would greatly appreciate higher marks and I am doing everything possible and in my power right now to try and achieve.  I bought a shirt that says Calgary Flames on it today.  Mat and I went to the mall and got lunch then shopped.  It was really fun actually!  We tried to go out twice before and it ended bad, but today was really good.  It was calming and just really fun to have someone to do things with!  And now that I have my car it's even better and I am picking him up tomorrow!  I am also really busy and everything coming up.  Tomorrow I am getting a pedicure and it's my sisters wedding rehearsal tomorrow so I have to miss the game, but o well I will live.  Although I used to hate hockey, in fact I had NEVER watched hockey until the Vancouver vs. Calgary serious and then I got hooked.  I LOVE hockey now and the flames kick ass!!!  I love them and Jarome Iginla is like the coolest ever!  Anyways, on Friday I am getting a manicure and then we are having a cast dinner at Boston Pizza and then later we are going back to Megz house.  That will be soooooooo fun!!  Then Saturday is my sisters big day - getting married!  So in the morning we are doing our hair and make-up and we have to set up the hall and that is basically my Saturday gone.  Sunday is the opening of the gifts and when I get home I am going out with Chels.  Ok so that is my weekend!  Booked solid!  Yeah what is new - just hope there is no upcoming quizzes in Bio cause I don't really have a lot of time right now and my ultimate goal is an 80% in Bio, that is what I want.

      Things are crazy, life is crazy!  Ok so like I think I am sick, my mom cracker her tooth down the middle, and now today me Dad flew in yesterday and was helping Ben with the house and he fell and broke his ankle.  Ok so yeah that wouldn't be that bad on "NORMAL" circumstances, but my sisters wedding is this upcoming Saturday.  So yeah my Dad will have to like hobble down the aisle instead of walk my sister down it.  He is more of a pain in the ass that sits and watches T.V. now - certainly not much of a help.  I am also really proud of myself right now.  I studied so much for my Bio, I did all the concept questions as I went through each chapter and I have read them more than once.  I plan to read them again maybe later tonight, but I really feel like I know the info so well.  I always study, but I have never felt this way before.  I feel as though I could be ready to write it tomorrow and you know what I probably am.  However, I will use the one day extra to my advantage.  I might as well, more review.  I mean no matter what I score on this test, I really know I put my 150% into it.  That is all I can do.  I know what I want, I know where I want to go, and I know what I need to do to get there.  So bring on the Bio, yeah cause I can handle it!  OH and here are some pictures from the play:

      I think I am beginning to get sick.  Of course I haven't been feeling all that well and stuff and well am anticipating the results from the blood test cause I am almost convinced that something is wrong.  And well I did good on my Bio quiz!  YAY!  I just really need to do good on the unit test on Tuesday cause the last two I didn't do so well.  I don't know why though.  I studied for both, read over the chapter(s), and went over the concept objectives.  I know that I know that stuff.  It is so frustrating!!!!!  I just want to be good at something, I want to be good at Bio.  I don't just always want to be the hard working girl that is good at Drama and fit for a stage.  I don't just want to be good at Drama, I want to be at something that will get me somewhere in life.  I am trying though and I KNOW that no matter what happens I am passing Bio, but I want to do better.  So frustrating but I guess that is part of the process I have to do through to get to where I want to be later in life.  After school today we striked the set for the play, and it only took us an hour to get everything down.  Then I went home, ate a muffin and a half, two slices of raisin bread with jam, and about 7 crackers with jam and water.  That was really good!  Next Friday Mr. B is taking us all out for dinner at B.P. and I am also getting my nails done that afternoon.  It's hard to believe my sisters wedding is one week away from Saturday and the rehearsal is on Thursday.  Time flies by so quickly.  I wrote this poem a while ago, just thinking about things in the past.  It's called Beside me you Will Stand.       Beside Me You Will Stand   With time I've come to grow and learn and in time I've come to understand There are so many amazing teachers, friends, and people that can lend a helping hand When I thought that I just "can't" I was reminded that I "can" I realize now I am capable of anything and beside me you will stand  There were times when I thought I couldn't continue on Times that saw my life as short instead of extraordinarily long And though I must admit sometimes I felt as though I couldn't carry on There were friends and teachers there who saw it as duty to care I Would have felt to be all alone but I know there was always someone there  I cried so many nights thinking that "I can't" So many remarkable teachers reminded me that "I can" And there are those who I could never thank enough  For how many times you asked how things were going When school seemed just too much, when life seemed all too tough  Wonderful people that I did meet tell me "Don't be hard on yourself" At the end of the day I realize the many talents I do posses Though sometimes it takes more than just hard work and effort to gain success At times I have given up and failed, but forgot that there will always be another test Whether a test from God, test during school, or a test from friends to prove my cool  With time I've come to grow and learn and in time I've come to understand There are so many amazing teachers, friends, and people that can lend a helping hand When I thought that I just "can't" I was reminded that I "can" I realize now I am capable of anything and beside me you will stand

      It seems like forever since I actually had time to go on this thing!  I have been busy with the High School Drama Festival which was soo fun, but left me confused in Bio.  And then like a million late night rehearsals for the play which was a HUGE success!!  It was so good!  People were comparing it to university plays and how we have met the standards and on the last night we got a standing ovation.  Tommow we have to take down the set though and well I think the cast party is next Friday, but I have to get my nails done for my sisters wedding.  Today for Bio we went to the Bridlewood creek, which was fun but really wet because of the rain.  And well this one day in Bio we were using one of those machines that measures blood pressure and I thought it was cool so I got my blood pressure taken and it was like really high.  Then I was kind of worried and have been paying attention to things more in detail.  I have also been having like a million muscle spasms in my right arm but I went to the doctor today and said that is normal, but my blood pressure was high and they took my pulse then decided it would be best to do blood work.  So yeah my arm is slightly sore, but not as bad as before.  I am really worried though.  I have lost a bit of weight over the last couple days and am worried because I keep having to eat to feel good.  I eat breakfast - a good breakfast but need something before lunch and usually after lunch I don't feel good by 2:00 pm.  That worries me, along with this strange thing that goes on with my hands and toes.  I feel warm everywhere on my body except the fingers and toes are absolutely freezing and like my mom described it like in-depth to the doctor today cause even she was kind of worried cause she is always like "omg how can you be that cold?" and like I really don't know.  Even on the really hot day that we went to Father Whelihan to do Drama scenes (It went really well and our scences were amazing) even then my fingers were freezing and the temp outside was like over 20 degrees.

      I am so enegery drained, so worried about when I will review my Bio for the test I missed.  So stressed out right now but for good reasons.  In fact, I have had to take any available time (excpet now cause I am tired and just need to unleash) just to do school work.  I am trying really hard to keep up with the English but right now he expects way too much.  I can't keep up with it all, but I am trying.  On Sunday I will have to do an indepth review of my Bio, though we are doing a J.H. performance of the play during tutorial so I will probably have to write it Tuesday.  I think I am going to ask if I can write it 1st thing in the morning, like after 7.  There would be less distractions, I wouldn't feel time pressure, and if I am in a room by myself (hopefully) then I would feel less anxiety and more relaxed.  Drama festival was fun.  Too much food, and well I have had to leave early alot for play rehearsal (which I am sick of)  And well Wednesday I did Commedia, yesterday I did "Unwrapping the Classics" so basically breaking down Shakesphere, and today I did Musical Theatre - which was the most fun of all, and we even got to sing Jesus Christ Superstar with a dance we learned.  It was sooo much fun!!  Like I said though too much food - today alone I've have p.b. & J sandwich, granola bar, muffin loaf thing, cookie, milk, chinese, pizza, ice cream cone, strawberries and cool whip.  I gained like 3 pounds from yesterday but I look the same, or atleast still feel like me.  Ok I can't write anymore, too stressed and I am talking to Brent on Msn and tommorow I have early morning rehearsal.  Rehearsal again, go figure.  I am really tired of it, but it will pay off.  It's just really hard to have a life.  My life seems to revolve around Drama more than anything else.

      Wow I have been soooo busy.  Rehearsals all the time!  I think I spend more time at school then I do at home now.  Our rehearsals have been running from 4:00 and well they are suppose to end at 7:30 but we always end up going to at least 8:00 or 9:00.  Usually we order or bring food.  On thursday we got pizza and yesterday we had chips, cookies, and pop (well I didn't have any pop *by the way I have a story bout' that*) and yeah Megz and I bought a 2 lb bag of animal crackers!  We bought the zoo!  Yeah so Friday's rehearsal was good and we got soup from timmys and a yogurt parfait from McDonalds (that is like the ONLY thing I will eat there) for lunch.  Oh and who got 100% on their Bio quiz - ME!!  It was the easiest all year but I still have to do good on the unit test coming up cause my last unit wasn't so hot.  Anyways like 100%.  Like I literally studied in the theatre during rehearsal and while watching the game.  Maybe it's because I wasn't so stressed out.  I usually study for hours on end and don't end up doing good.  I find that actually when I just relax and take it easy, the marks seem to come easier.  I guess it makes sense though.  Also the gym riot on Thursday was so much fun.  I was on team white and we came in 3rd, but we weren't last because there were four teams.  Team white was pretty pathetic though, because I mean c'mon you know how hard it is to decorate with the color white when half of the gym is already that color.  We got to do a balloon stomp where everyone got to tie balloons around their ankles and stomp the other teams color.  Matt Clearly did the pie eating contest.  We got to make up a team cheer and like I said decorate.  Then there was a refridgerator box relay where three people on each side had to go under this giant box and to the other side to pick up other people from their team.  Then Chels got taped to the wall with duct tape in 3 minutes and we actually came in 1st for that one.  There were many more.  Also for the grab bag re-lay pulled out a can of Pepsi, but I like never drink pop.  At first I started to chug in really fast but I got like this rush of carbonated drink going down and I had to stop cause I couldn't breath and then my stomach LITERALLY felt like it was going to explode.  After I was done I thought I might actually throw it back up because I could feel some muscles or something in my stomach trying to force it back.  So I am sure that wasn't exactly too safe to chug pop, but whatever I did it for the team.    Yeah white! Alright! We look like snow We're ready to go We've got the flow We're white, alright!  Go White!

      I went to the YMCA again yesterday and worked out for about two hours.  I love working out.  If I had the energy I would stay at the gym all day all the time.  Afterwards I feel so good.  Exercise is like the medicine for happiness I swear.  When I got home my mom and I went to Tim Hortons and got a BLT bagel combo and we also tried those celebration cakes.  They were so good!!  Then we ran a whole bunch or erins and she also showed me how to get to Bishop Grandin.  I can't believe school starts again on Friday, but I am happy I signed up for Summer School.  It's better than being bored out of your mind.  I also applied at Safeway in Southland cause I haven't got any callbacks from all the places I applied.  My resume is awesome, I mean there is nothing wrong there.  I mean I am an honours student and do like a thousand things within the community and school, and still no call back.  Maybe it's the hours I request to work.  I mean I can't exactly work every hour of my life like other losers out there that don't have a life.  I mean I still have to focus on Summer School, that is my main priority and that comes first.  I woke up this morning and it felt so calming.  I had left my window open last night so when I woke up I could hear the rain pouring down and hitting the window and the side of the house.  It was peaceful.  I have to go shower soon and then drive my mom to the Rocky View.  Then basically I have to do everything - dishes, cleaning, feeding cat and bunnies, the list goes on.  I also have to drive her everywhere, but luckily I have a car and can drive now.  I also have to drive to the airport to pick up my Dad.  He is coming home from Vancouver tomorrow.  He is going to live with us again.  It is going to seem so strange.  It used to be strange enough when my dad came back for every second weekend, and now he like is going to be here permenantly.  I guess I will get used to it, but at first it's going to seem really strange.  Last night I also went to go see The Notebook.  That was a good movie.  Oh, I also found this really good scholaship I am going to apply for.  I am not going to say what the name is though cause then my friends would be competing against me.  There are like five categories you can chose to enter and I am choosing the Performing Arts Category.  I have to write an essay and stuff, fill out the application form.  Then you can also include four additional pages of evidence, proof, and like examples of what you did or can do.  I have the best idea.  It's too bad though that we couldn't video tape the play though cause video, cds, etc are allowed.  That is going to be the real competition.  Anyways I am going to write about the experience in the play.  Then for my examples and stuff I am including the program guide, two pic on two pieces of paper to show it, and then I am going to ask Mr. B for a letter of reference.  Except what I am going to do to make mine stand out is that I am going to use this tissue paper kind of art thing I was taught in grade 7.  Instead of just attaching the pics to blank pages I am going to make like a background kind of thing and since we did "A Mid Summer Night's Dream" I am going to make like moons and starts part of the background.  That is going to be like the theme.  Then on the envelope that I am going to send it in, I am going to do just a little simple art design like that.  It's creative, and original.  I don't think everyone will do something like it.  I hope that it will make in stand out, and just noticeable.  I believe I have a very good shot at this.  I am going to do my best to get this.

      K, I mean how in the world can I be 140.  How was I at 134 one day, the next 137, and now 140.  I mean for christ sake I worked out for two friggin hours today!!!!!!!  I mean I ate healthy and everything.  I am hoping that maybe my weight is up because I am building muscle mass cause of exercise or because of the large water intake increase.  I am scared though.  I don't want to gain anymore weight.  My Mom and I am going to Timmys for lunch tomorrow and then on Thurs we are going out to Earls with the neighbor's and then to Peters Drive In.  That would be nice if I had like super metabolism and like didn't eat anything else those days.  Maybe when I go to Summer School the weight will come off.  I just don't want to go back in September and be like 10 pounds heavier.  Especially because Leonard said "Well Vanessa before you came back you were pretty ugly, but now your hot."  I mean what if I were to gain back the 50 pounds I once lost.  What would people think of me?  Would their opinions of me change?  The truthful answer to those questions is yes.  You know I just want to be smart and pretty, really that is all I want.  I wish I weren't so self-contious, worried about weight and everything, but I mean that is what today's world is all about.  It's about being thin and hot.  That is all people care about these days, or at least it seems.  I wonder how people can be content with the way they look and the way they are.  I wish I could be, but everytime I step on the scale it's higher and makes me want to cry cause I feel like I have lost control over things in my life.  I am TRYING to eat healthy though and going to the gym all the time.  Other than that I don't know what to do, maybe I am just going through a temp gain of weight or something now.  I don't really know, I just know that I want to be back to the usual 137.  I feel ok with myself and confident at that.  I suppose it's not like being 140 is really going to make people say "omg, she gained weight" but I mean I have to keep the weight off some how.  It just doesn't make any sense though, you would think eating healthy and working out would get me somewhere.  I am more friggin active now then I was during the school days.  It doesn't make any sense.  I don't want to starve myself and I don't think that should be an option.  I am thinking maybe putting away my scale in my closet is a good idea so I don't weight myself like 4 times a day.  I need to keep away from it, and not seeing how much I weight might help with my self-concept here, but I can Physically notice changes too.  All the fat is going to my stomach, everytime I eat that is like the major fat storage area.  All my food seems to turn to fat.  My arms feel a lot muscular from weights and my legs are my more shaped.  If only there was something to make the stomach smaller.  Right now I wish I were a celebrity.  They can do anything.  I wish I were right and older.  Then I would get lipo, it's not like anyone would know you had it done.  I am scared though, if I can't keep the weight off at 16 then how I am going to manage when I have kids or when I am in my 20's and 30's.  Sometimes I think weight matter more than anything.  Your whole world practically revovles around it.  The thinner you are, the more prettier, which gives you high self-esteem and self-concept, which leads to you living a happy, successful, and productive life.  I wish I wasn't so obsessed with stuff like this, but I am and I don't know how to cope.  My Mom doesn't make it very easy since she is very overweight.  She bring home fast food (not that I eat any of it half of the time) and we always go out to here and there, she like NEEDS to buy junk when we go to movies, and compulsively she eats late.  Not to mention she buys way too much food for the house and there are always too many good options, which makes you try to resist the urge to always eat it.  She always seems to want to go get ice cream too.  I mean once and a while a treat is good, but not like every second week.  It's difficult trying to stay my weight, and I am doing my best.  I mean if I went more then 2 hours at the gym, then that would be over doing it, and I don't want to stave myself - that's just not right.  Well at least I got this off my chest.  In the morning I am going to wake up and just eat my meals, go work out, and NOT step on the scale.  This entire week we will be going out lots, so really there is no point in stepping on the scale anyways.  Once I start summer school their probably won't even be any time to eat.  Well that's that.  Wish I could be thin, but life isn't always fair so whatever comes my way I guess I just have to accept it and deal with it

      I hit an all time high on the scale - 140.  I suppose going to all those stampede breakfasts and to dairy queen didn't really do any wonders.  I went to the gym this morning and am going to eat healthy - really healthy for the rest of the week except Friday cause my Dad is coming in, and I think this time he is stay and going to live with us again.  And well we are going to Peters Drive In on the Friday he comes in.  I did an hour and a half workout of cardio this morning at the gym and about half an hour of weights.  I am eating healthy, working out, I SHOULD be able to loose weight.  I mean I know I heard of what happens when people get older, and they gain weight and stuff but AHHHHHHHHH I am only 16!!!!!!!!!!!  Yesterday Chels and I went to Harry Potter and then got ice cream, though she barely ate anything.  No wonder she is so thin!  And well I went to the stampede breakfast at Walmart and got free food and stuff.  Today I have to vacuum later on, water the garden, and get all the dust out of the bathroom mats.  I have to drive my Mom to the hospital on Wednesday for her surgery and then I get to drive her back.  I think on Tuesday she is also going to show me how to get to Bishop Grandin so I know how to get there for Summer School.  I am excited for Summer School.  I will get to meet new people and well it was be a STRUCTURED Social class, instead of like the independant stuff they try to make us work with at BOB.

      I went to the Stampede Breakfast at the Somerset/Shawnessy station today.  I went up twice for Breakfast because I got like the smallest pancakes I ever did see in my life and I was still starving and we had got there early so I ate two plates.  Then I saw Chels and her mom and Chels and I went up to the platform and we got to see the major driving the train into the station.  Chels and I tried to huddle by the photographers and the cameras, lol.  When he got off the train it was like endless pictures over and over.  It was really neat to see what it is like to be known and be in the publics eye.  It was kind of cool.  Then he went around shaking hands, taking pictures with kids, and when he came to Chels and I we though he was going to shake our hands, but then he put his hand up and we high-fived him.  It was funny.  My mom said that he probably just wanted to be hip and "in" with the young people.  You know what, I think it worked.  After that my mom and I did a bunch of just little stuff, just going here and there.  Then I went to the YMCA for a workout.  I did an hour of cardio, 45 minute walk around the track, and I think about half an hour of weights.  Then I got home, and was hungry. You know I had envisioned eating like an apple for lunch, but as I opened my cupboard I discovered chocolates that weren't there before.  It was like calling my name I swear.  Besides, I think I worked out enough that it won't really have an effect.  I have managed to stay at 137, but I have shaped up and everything, my arms and my legs I can totally feel and even notice physically now that there is a difference since I started to work out all the time.  And well it's almost Stampede time and though I start Summer School soon it's like tradition to go to as many Stampede Breakfasts as possible, so really I mean bring on the pancakes and sausages.  That is what Stampede is about!

      I went to work out yesterday, I went to go work out today.  Do you think I lost any weight....NO.  I stepped on the scale and I am back up to 137.  It doesn't make any sense.  I am eating way less then I was before and working out all the time now.  How am I not losing weight.  Maybe I shouldn't of got a Wendy's salad yesterday with brent, but I mean I didn't even finish the damn thing and I took the rest home.  Oh well, I do feel in better shape then before.  I always thought the scale didn't lie, but my arms feel like super strong and my legs aren't as flabby.  If only my stomach would somehow shrink.  Oh, that would be nice wouldn't it.  I hope Chels calls today.  I want to do something, but if she doesn't then I will just find some exercise vids. in the basement and workout, or go for another hour long walk as long as it doesn't storm like half way through my walk.  It my bike wasn't in such bad shape I could probably go out for a ride, but I think the handle bars are still crocked from me dropping that thing a thousand times last summer.  I probably need a new bike cause I practically killed mine, but I don't really have the money for that now.  We are like ultimately broke now that I have my Car and my comp, but I mean those are like needs for me.  I went to go see the The Terminal last night.  It was a good movie.  If Chels calls we will probably end up going to see Harry Potter cause we both want to see that and we haven't seen it yet.  I am thinking I might go to that opening breakfast at the new station tomorrow.  It's not like I have anything else to do and Chels and I am probably going to the Walmart one on Sunday.  Although I am sure pancakes and stuff aren't the best choice for trying to loose weight, but whatev, I mean I probably will eat enough that won't need lunch anyways.

      My stomach hurts so much.  I woke up and felt a pain that really I cannot describe.  I would have rather been run over by a truck then feel that.  I had to eat though.  I ate a fruit to hold me over til' morning.  Maybe I should re-think my eating habits.  They aren't really good and they are starting to cause deterioration of my body.  I mean sure I want to be thin, but health is more important.  Anyways I am going back to bed.  I am tired and feel a bit better now.

      I feel so sick, like I am dying or something.  Everytime I eat I don't feel good afterwards.  I can't go not eat anything all the time though.  People are going to begin to start to think I am trying to starve myself, but my stomach REALLY REALLY hurts right now.  I barely ate anything for dinner and I lied to my Mom about what I had for lunch because all I ate was a granola bar.  I don't want to eat anyways though cause it makes me feel like deadly ill.  Also, my Mom would have freaked out if she knew I just ate a granola bar for lunch, but she doesn't know I am not feeling well.  If I don't tell her, she won't figure it out.  It's not like anyone can do anything about it anyways and I just had a blood test done like a month or less ago and everything was fine.  My stomach really hurts right now, but it's more painful when I stand up and stuff, and like about an hour or half and hour after I eat is usually the worst times.  When I lie down it's not as painful.  I also have to start Summer School soon and I am going to have to go the entire morning there, trying to pay attention and stuff, and it will be so much more difficult if I don't feel well.  To be honest I am kind of afraid to eat.  I don't want to feel sick and I don't want to get fat.  I was 137 a while ago and that's usually the weight I try to maintain, and now I am at 134, which I guess isn't that much weight lost considering I barely eat these days and I work out like 24/7.  I did about an hour and fifteen minutes at the gym this morning.  It felt good to work out, I feel in my legs there is slowly more muscle building up, and at least at the gym you meet people and there are people to socialize with.  I have also noticed an increase in like my level of happiness, I think the self-esteem meter went up to, but that's because when I eat less I feel better about myself.  I feel thinner.  I don't actually really care if it's unhealthy.  I mean maybe this being "sick" or whatever you would call it is a good thing, because I want to be thin and beautiful.  I want to be like everyone else, have a nice body, and just look good.  I don't want to be feeling sick though, but whatever, with time I am sure it will go away.

      Yesterday a whole bunch of us went to Laser Trek and played two games.  It was so much fun!!  I had more fun there then I have in a LONG time and I also got a good workout in that place.  The first game I came in third and the game I came in second.  The top three in both games were all girls - go figure.  We beat out all of the guys.  Then we all went to Fish Creek, but suck at starting fires so we went back to my place and cooked hot dogs and had chips and pop and stuff.  Then we went to the field out by the back of the school and some of us played Frisbee, Basketball, Soccer, or just went for a walk.  Then Chels left for work and the remainder of us went to Boston Pizza for dinner.  I barely ate though, cause again I didn't feel good.  When I did eat, like an hour lately I felt like deadly ill again, but that wasn't going to stop me from going out with friends and having fun.  After dinner we went to Chapters for a while and then to the movies.  Then I drove the people in my car home and Sara took the others.  It was a very fun day!  This morning I woke up and felt actually pretty good for once, compared to like how I usually feel in the mornings these days.  Then I went to go work out at the YMCA.  I didn't want to leave.  I was so relaxing working out and being in a busy, crowded environment.  I didn't want to like overdo it or anything, but I went from 8:45-10:00, which well isn't too long I guess.  Any longer then I will probably be like aching tomorrow.  When I got home though I felt sick again, though at least this morning I had an appetite for my breakfast.  My weight is slowly dropping though.  I am like not trying to avoid for or anything, it just makes me feel sick.  I suppose everything is fine though, as long as the weight comes down slowly then I don't think I have to worry too much.

      Ok, so I swear there is like something wrong.  I mean I can tell when things aren't right.  I had a blood test a while ago and they said everything was fine, but I don't think so.  Everytime I eat, I wake up in the morning and feel really sick and extremely full.  Then I go to the washroom like a thousand times and then I am usually fine.  Except the rest of the day I don't really feel the need to eat.  It's like food is sickening.  I took four bites out of my cereal this morning and felt like my stomach was going to explode.  And I mean that is not like me.  I love food, I love to eat.  This morning it just made me sick, and yesterday I barely ate because I didn't feel hungry even though I went for a 45 minute workout and an hour long walk.  Last night I ate like some M & M's and I felt extremely full for like over two hours and I mean really eating M & M's shouldn't make you feel like you just ate like two steak dinners.  I also started to get the pain in my left side again while I was working out.  I was only into the 5th minute of my workout.  When I was talking to the doctor about that, they just said I over did it.  Ok, so how can I over do it is it's something that is reoccuring all the time.  I mean it happens when I work out, climb stairs, sometimes it just happens when I am sitting.  Usually the mornings are the worst though cause I can seem to keep the food in.  It's like I eat it one day and my body feel the need to just get rid of it ASAP.  I don't really know what this is, and if I go the Doctors again they are just going to give me the bullshit speech of how everything is fine.  I remember when my sister had kidney stones they kept telling her everything was ok, but she was like in extreme pain and like a month later they were like "well maybe it's kidney stones."  Like...hmmmm...you could of thought of that a little earlier.

      Ok, so I have to admit I spend a lot of time on my computer but I mean it's practically my other best friend besides Chels.  It doesn't tell me what's right or wrong, doesn't insult me, or give opinions, and it doesn't talk.  Sounds like something good to me.  Anyways, I was bored, yes bored of the comp so I went for a walk.  I actually went to the old wodden park near by and sat on a swing until I was dead bored so I went for a walk around the school and then around Evergreen and Shawnee and back home again.  Then I had some fruit - the other half of my lunch.  For lunch I only had a granola bar, but when I got back from my walk I thought that maybe not eating like anything isn't exactly the best thing.  So I had some fruit, and it was so good actually.  Better than junk food because you don't have to feel guilty eating it because it's healthy.  I had an oragne, bluberries, and a nectarine.  Yum!  I think my mom is also picking me up a side salad from Wendy's.  You know I am tired of hearing about the debate on TV.  That is all everyone always talks about now.  I mean C'mon Paul Martin really doesn't have a chance.  The only people that will vote him are all the French people that don't know any better.  All Liberals are good for is wasting money if you ask me.  I wish I were old enough to vote because Conservatives are clearly best for what Canada needs.  Stephen Harper is the best, he is like a family man and everything.  He believes in what is important for everyone.

      I had seriously the strangest dream last night.  I dreamt that I was pregnant.  Now that is just slightly scary considering I am an teenager.  I mean I don't really know what the message of that dream was trying to convey.  It was just weird.  This morning I went to the YMCA to work out, and I feel so good now that I have.  It's like seriously some sort of energy booster.  I feel good about myself, healthy, and just happy.  I miss school too, not like that is any surprise.  It was nice to be at the Y, kind of reminded me of school you know.  I also talked to Chelsey today.  I had an amazing talk with her this morning.  It was just like the old conversations we used to have when we were even better best friends then we are now.  No arguing or anything, just someone to talk to about my worries and everything.  God, now I realize why it's so important to have a best friend.  They are always there for you.

      Yeah I was bored so I wrote a poem.  I know I don't have school and I am not obligated to do work, but I like poetry.     On the road ahead  Awaiting us is one grand course To where it directs I do not know As though we chose to go our ways What does this opportunity hold?  Cannot judge, nor calculate Where we will be in time Our position in life may be standing Or running against the hands of time   Where then I may find myself Slightly short of being blind To come across myself without a clue With only a insignificant sight in mind 	 These ambitions, these visions of reality They are not undetectable to the human eye Nor imaginable, just complicated to observe At times they are not easy to believe   One day we will stumble onto a path A route that lies further on The one we have bee waiting for With stones, rocks, and pebbles too  We may stagger, we may fall Trip over an obstacle or take off instead of fall Though we do not know what awaits us tomorrow Today we will follow the road ahead  ~By Vanessa     I also over-heard something today.  I don't know if I was supposed to know or anything, but my mom was talking about one of my cousins.  One of the sons of my Dad's brother and his EX-wife.  Well this cousin she was talking about is a years older than me and I found out that he has problems with learning and has a confirmed learning disability.  This is kind of scary, but kind of makes sense to me.  It makes sense because I think I have one to, it's just that no one thinks so.  They don't live my life though, so I don't know how anyone can speak on behalf of me.  Yes, I pass my classes.  Yes, I put in a lot of effort.  Yes, sometimes I can score good marks, but I also fail just as much as I pass.  I think one of the biggest eye openers was Drivers Ed.  That was one of the most difficult things learning.  I mean I REALLY tried to pass drivers ed, but I failed.  I don't think too many people fail, but I am sure that if I did, then others must have to.  I say that I think I might have one though by the unseen struggles I have with math and chem especially, and some aspects of Biology.  Like reading and interpreting graphs, reading comp for English, understanding what math word probs are asking and determining which methods to use, oh there is so much, and I listed more things (a lot more) in a previous post not to long ago.  I guess I try to hide most of my struggles.  Now that it's summer, things should be a little bit easier though.  No crying to hours at night and like almost having a heart attack from hyperventilating.  It's just now that I found out my cousin does have one, I know they run in families.  Therefore it could be possible that I might too.  Maybe I am just a slow learner though.  I don't really want to believe that, but it could be true.  That doesn't however explain why I fail sometimes, pass other times, and sometimes no matter what just don't understand.  My life is so confusing and the world is equally confusing.

      Yesterday I babysat Marci's two kids - Danika and Megan.  They were like so well behaved it was amazing, and seriously I have never met kids that polite in my life.  We played monopoly, clue, soccer, basketball, then I had to pull them around in a wagon for like half-an-hour which actually was really fun, and we watched Monsters Inc.  Kids are so fun!  I can't wait til' I have kids, but yeah I am just slightly young right now.  I made $40 for the night, so that will pay for Tuesday.  Some of my friends and me are going to laser quest, barbecuing in fish creek, going to Chinook to bowl, having dinner out, and then going to a movie.  We always have like a day of fun once school is over every year, so this is what we decided we are going to do this year.  This morning I went out for Brunch at the Carriage House Inn.  Ashley was working, so I saw her and apologized for missing her party, but I am seeing her Tuesday.  I will also give the gift I bought her on Tuesday to her.  Anyways, we went to brunch with Melissa, Ben, Collen, Martin, my Mother, my Dad (he's in town for once in a blue moon) and of course myself.  You know what the retard did at the gas station yesterday...He left EVERYTHING open - the fuel door thing and like the twisty thing that you have to unscrew to fill up the car with gas.  Luckily I went to go wash my car right after that.  While I was washing it, I got around the that side and noticed it open, right after I had filled up.  Errrr, that makes me so mad.  If it was raining my car would have been ruined if water had gotten in.  I mean it doesn't take a rocket scientist to know how to fill up a car with gas and it is only common sense that if you have to twist a knob to put the gas in, it's likely you also have to CLOSE it as well.  Next time I am just going to go to self serve, even though last time I swear the guys in the gas stating were laughing their ass off because I couldn't twist the cap thing off.  So then I had to ask some lady, because that was the first time I had ever filled up with gas.  I can't wait for Summer school to start, but on the other hand at least now I have some time to go to the gym and work out.  I haven't been for a long time, and I have been eating a lot more than usually because I am trying to get out of my habit of weighing myself all the time.  It's almost like an obsession I have.  I must weight myself at least four times a day, if not more.  Twice in the morning and twice at night.  It's hard trying not to gain weight though.  There is so much pressure to be thin and look good and everything.  It will be nice to get Social 30 out of the way too.  I knew that I wouldn't have time to use the strategies I used this year to get myself through Social.  I ended with an 82% and that is pretty good for not knowing a thing.  I mean all I did for all the long answer tests were write out the answers to the questions they gave us and memorize then word for word.  It doesn't matter in the world today whether you understand or not.  Everyone just looks at marks and uses that as an estimate, which in my opinion is stupid.  I mean you can't measure what one knows based on marks.  There is to much emphasis put on achieving, and everyone always praises those who are so smart.  Then again I guess I get praised for hard work.  It's like being complimented for TRYING to be smart - sometimes I wonder if that should be taken as a compliment of not.  That's a tough one.  It's hard to believe next year will be grade twelve.  I will be at the TOP of the food chain.  That feels good, but it doesn't mean everything.  There is so much pressure to succeed, and I already put numerous amounts of pressure on myself to do good.  I want to get into University so badly.  That is the one goal I am ultimately working towards.  I know that if I get in, I can do that stuff with hard work and well probably going to have to hire a tutor.  I might even need a tutor for next year because no one seems to take me seriously when I saw I don't understand my math.  I mean no one really knows just how frustrating it is, going home and just crying for like hours because you really want to understand and you just keep trying and trying, but can't seem to get the right answer.  That is why I doubt myself a lot.  I mean really, people expect me to believe in myself, but after trying and failing so many times you would think there would be a time and a place to draw the line of: I can and I can't.  If that makes any sense at all.  I probably will need a tutor for Chem 30 next year too, but I really want to try doing it without a whole bunch of tutors.  I want to be able to do the stuff myself you know.  I don't want to be dependent or reliable on other people all the time to 'teach me this, and show me that.'    I hope I get all the hard courses in the first semester for grade twelve year.  I want at least just the Math and Chem.  That way second semester I won't be so stressed and will go through my depressive state at the beginning of the year, rather than the end.  I want to enjoy high school, it's just not always that easy though.  I'm so scared of Diploma's next year too.  I mean C'mon, why on Earth would they make them worth 50%.  Some people like me, try and they try, but doesn't necessarily dictate how good of a mark I will get.  My tests are my weakness for most subjects.  Like half of the subjects I do good in, is for the reason that I work my ass off for my future goals and dreams that I am NEVER going to give up on, and most of my marks are as high as they are because I do ALL of the homework.  I don't think anything is going to change though, it's just I don't chose to fail half of the tests I do, I mean I REALLY honestly try my best to pass.  I mean what will happen if I fail a Diploma.  Maybe I shouldn't be so negative, but I mean you always have to consider all the possibilities.  The University are especially going to pay close attention to my marks in the Science courses I have taken.  The thought of having to do Chemistry courses and Math courses in University scare me a lot.  I am the girl who still doesn't even understand how to balance an equation properly and needs to eventually pass University Chem.  I have proven to myself that I can do just about anything I put my mind to.  So when I make it in into University (Which I will because I didn't work my ass off for nothing)then I will probably have to face one of the biggest challenges of my life.  Mat and I argued this morning, about Tuesday that we are all getting together and stuff.  We argued about a stupid movie.  He was like "Oh, we all agreed to see Chronicles of...??Can't actually remember anymore" yeah I forgot what the last word was, but it's like some action shit I don't want to see.  Then I told him that like why would I pay for a movie I don't even want to see.  And he was like "Well you can't always have your way."  Well you know what, if I don't want to see that fucking movie, then hell I am not going to go see it.  He pisses me off so much something.  I can't even believe I am dating him.  So sorry Mat if you somehow happen to find my journal and read this, but I really have to get off all the shit I am feeling so I don't end up almost killing myself like the thousand other times I came so close.  He is way too into my looks.  I mean no one was attracted to me until I came back after last summer 50 pounds lighter.  There is this one comment specifically I remember, he said: "I can't wait until I get back from the flight camp because you will have lost more weight."  I mean buddy your being TOTALLY unrealistic.  Just because I lost 50 pounds one summer, doesn't mean I am going to come back to school again even thinner.  I look just fine (well I admit I would like to loose more, but right now I am not trying cause I have other issues I need to deal with) and like it's all about my stupid looks.  Looks are nothing, personality is everything.  The more I get to know him, the more turned off I am.  I miss Aaron, I loved Aaron.  I really hope he comes back for the Summer so I can see him.  He is like my perfect match.  I didn't believe in love at first sight until I met him.  Now that was love at first site, then our personalities just complimented each other like leaves in the wind.  I swear Aaron is the one.  Ok, not kidding, not joking, not being unrealistic.  I mean they say there is always someone out there that is meant for you.  With Aaron I feel so loved and accepted, so free to be who I really am.  To him, he loved me the way I was.  He didn't think I was too big, or too thin, just right.  We had so much fun together.  I had public affection with just about anyone, but with him it was so different.  I felt good showing public affection with him.  I just wish he didn't live so far away.  I mean I can't exactly fly to Halifax and I swear last summer it was fate that brought the two of us together.  In fact, the minute he stepped of the west side bus at C.O.P. for an off-trip, my attention drew directly toward him.  He made me feel confident and just wild.  When we all took turns going on the bungee trampoline he was like "Vanessa, do a flip, you can do it."  I was so scared, but I did it for him and it was so much fun.  Then he dumped a bucket of water on me and we had a huge water fight, just the two of us without even knowing each other that much back them.    Nothing in life seems to ever make sense does it.  I mean I seem to have failed myself in so many different areas.  I mean I failed in relationships, I literally failed Drivers Ed, but with so much damn hard work and practice I finally got my license (Some miracle of God, seriously that was so stressful), and well sometimes I feel I failed myself in school.  All the times I really try.  Sometimes I think people underestimate how much effort and work I put in, trying to get a good mark.  That is why it's so upsetting to fail.  I guess that is the whole lesson in life though.  We try and we fail, and we try and we fail.  I suppose with failure we understand more about life and the rest of the world.  Maybe the world is trying to send me one big message or trying to teach me some important lesson.  Maybe I am just crazy.  That seems like a good option.  There is so much that is on my mind right now though, I am pretty stressed.  You would think that with the end of school, life wouldn't be as hectic, but thinking of the future and what awaits me is a pretty scary thing.

      Yeah so I woke up this morning, but NOT early.  That's right, I slept in!!  Yesterday was so much fun.  Megz, myself, and a bunch of other people came to the Greek Festival.  We got lost like a million times, and yeah I made a couple u-turns.  Yup, I broke the law.  Then a couple assholes wouldn't let me in so basically I ALMOST hit them, but instead of clipping them, I just swerved back into my lane.  On out way back, so guy pulling out of a parking lot almost hit me to, but my car is fine and everyone else is too, so that's good!   It was so much fun though last night.  We ordered like tons of Greek food, and had lots of Greek desserts and everything.  Then we went to the face painting both and we all got mustaches with goatee's painted on.  OMG, it was so funny.  Then the kids that saw us with them painted on our faces, were all like "lets get mustaches guys, then we saw little girls starting to do it too."  I suppose we started a trend, or we are pretty influence and great role models!  Then we went back to my house and we took a picture of us with our sporty mustaches on.  Then I drove everyone back to Megz.  The ride from the Greek Festival on the way home was the best though.  I still had to concentrate on driving, but when we stopped at red lights we all yelled OPA, and you have to remember we looked strange too, with all that stuff painted on our face.  They also had a whole bunch of Greek dancing to watch, and that was really neat.  Not that I am like into Greek a lot or anything, but it's like totally different from the Ukrainian culture - foods and dancing.  Anyways, my mom assumes that when I say I like something, it's some sort of indication for her to go out and buy like 10 of whatever it is that I said I liked.  Like these yogurt granola bars.  One day I was like "yum, they are so good.  You know what she did...She bought a box of vanilla, a box of blueberry, and a box of strawberry.  Now she won't stop buying them.  I try to eat them quick so I don't have to see them anymore, then she just goes while I am sleeping to safeway and comes home with more food that I don't need!!  I can tell it's the beginning of holidays.  Already I feel kind of like a slave, but I mean I guess doing things for your parents is kind of expected.  My mom wanted to me take the newspapers from out garage to like a newspaper drive they are having at Bishop O'Byrne.  Ok, so I was kind of upset by her telling me this, but then I just felt like I was doing something to help out the community.  It took forever to load the newspapers into boxes and bags, and then carry them to the car.  Like seriously I swear my mother has been saving since Christmas.  I mean if they world didn't have newspapers, they would save a heck of a lot of trees!

      I got 71% on the Bio final.  I was aiming for 80%, but I thought I like failed.  I am proud of my 71% and my overall average only went down by 1%.  So I am very happy about that because it's didn't dramatically drop.  I worked my ass off trying to understand everything for Bio and I tried my very best.  71% is the best I can do.  I put my very best effort forth.  Mat and I went to the zoo today.  Our lunch was like the most expensive thing ever!  Tonight I am going to the Greek Festival with Megz and a bunch of my other friends.  It should be fun.  I also am eating what I want to eat now.  I mean I don't want to admit it, but I am obsessed with weight, and weighing myself.  I decided I need to get out of the habit, even if that means I gain a couple pounds (but hopefully that won't happen) Anyways....today has been great!!  My Bio marks just made my day.  I swear she like rigged the marks cause I thought I did bad.  Maybe my T.A. is right after all.  Maybe I am just like way too hard on myself.  I mean I do expect great things from myself though, I mean there is no doubt about that!  I also wrote this little thing a while ago.  Just about people who inspire me, I look up to, and mean a lot to me:      Making a Difference    Everywhere I go it seems that the message trying to be conveyed to students is that there T.A. is someone who they can rely on, find strength in, and just go to in times of need.  Truly that is what my T.A. is there for and she has been such an amazing support and guide through out my high school years.  However, at the beginning of grade ten my T.A. was away for the first few months.  To count the various substitutes I had gone through is nearly impossible, nor did I feel very comfortable is a new school environment.  There was this one day after tutorial had ended, and our substitute we had for T.A. had asked us to get a card initialed proving we had gone to tutorial.  It was my Science teacher, Mrs. Jagorinec who asked me who my T.A. was.  When I thought about this question, my answer came out as I don’t know.  That was the truth.  I had met so many different people in the following weeks that the names of people became unimportant to me.  Once my Science teacher realized that really I didn’t have a defined T.A. or just someone to talk and rely on, she did her best to make me feel welcome within the school community.  She talked to me, took interest in what I liked, and most importantly she cared.  To her I was more that just the student that sat in the back corner.  I was more than just another student in her Science class.  As the weeks proceeded, Mrs. Jagorinec began to notice my involvement in the school community and the different aspects of extra-curricular activities I took interest in.  These interests of mine became our foundation for weekly discussions.  The more she took interest and the more we communicated, I began to feel more welcome in the school community.  It wasn’t long before I felt that she too was someone I could rely.  I discovered she was a teacher I could turn to for advice, someone that would support me in tough times, and just talk when no one else was around.  A couple months later my T.A. came back permanently and I learned that she was also an amazing person.  She was there to support me with learning and help me with choices, but I wouldn’t take back the way Mrs. Jagorinec had made me feel in the past months.  She helped me to get through those months where I didn’t have a supportive relationship with any other teacher, and didn’t have any one else besides my friends to turn to.  Soon enough she became my favourite teacher and her Science class was also the place I loved to be most.  Not only was she an inspiration, but she was also a role model to me as well.   Since I got to know Mrs. Jagorinec very well in the last months, I began to feel more open when I needed to ask for help.  I didn’t feel pressure to always be perfect in her class and she reminded me that making mistakes was an important step in the learning process.  At the end of grade ten she had mad such an impact on me that I realized I wanted to teach Science.  I thought I may possibly want to teach Biology because I excelled in that area more so than others.  When I reached grade eleven she only had the opportunity to teach one Biology class.  During the second semester I saw her in the hallway and she told me that I was in her Biology class.  I wondered how this could be; because on my original schedule I was suppose to have a different teacher.  It turned out that one Biology class had been switched from another teacher to her, so she had the opportunity to teach me for the second year in a row.    I cannot describe the difference she has made.  Times when she saw me in the hallways and just asked how things we going had value and importance to me.  Just a simple question of how’s it going can make all the difference in whether my day was good or bad, just because she took time to care.  Even when I wasn’t a student in her class, I was an important friend outside of class.  She has inspired me to become a Biology teacher in the future.  I plan to go to University and study Biological Sciences and then obtain my teaching degree to teach secondary education.  Before I had met Mrs. Jagorinec teaching was only a dream, but she has made me realize that becoming a teacher is only a goal away.    This is a poem I wrote about her, because of the difference she has made in my life, and I am certain that she will continue to inspire and touch others students such as myself in the near future.      Thank You  People come and people go But you were so special I want you to know I’ve never met anyone so kind and so caring So different, all that knowledge you were sharing  I still remember one day walking by You gave me a smile instead of a “hi” That feeling inside was something so great A gift that anyone could appreciate  You never failed to ask how things were going Never failed at the compassion you were showing Always proved you wanted to help out Certainly the greatest teacher without a doubt  There is just something special about you You know what to say and you know what to do You helped me with Science and with Biology too Helped me to deal, helped me to get through  A memory of you will remain in my heart Didn’t think you would be so cool right from the start But wonderful people they come and they go The thing in life is that we never really know  So here is a thank-you to all that you have done You have made such an impact on everyone You are an inspiration and a role model too There is nothing about you that I would undo  Thank you     	My high school years have been filled with wonderful memories of the remarkable experiences and the many magnificent people.  With anticipation this wonderful precedent has be set for the generations to come.  Just thought I would write a little essay kinda thing.  Just felt like it you know.  It gives me more time to reflect on everything.

      Ok, I was reading some stuff online just looking into the possibilities as to why I struggle so much in school.  I came across a very reputable website that described what EXACTLY matches me.  I mean EXACTLY.  It totally describes me, it's really scary just how 'dead on' it is.  Conceptual/Holistic Processing Disability:   When your weakness is in the conceptual/holistic area, you probably can memorize details and facts pretty well but really struggle to understand deeper meaning and general concepts. You may read rather quickly and easily but have difficulty understanding what you have read.     For this type of disability it is most important to take extra time to try to develop a deeper understanding of what you are learning. Although you may finish assignments quickly, you need to spend extra time to figure out why each assignment was important and what you really learned.    The following may be most suitable for you:   1.  Extra instruction  about underlying concepts and deeper meaning. Why is this information important?   2.  Overviews  and summaries to provide context before and after lessons.   3.   Concrete visual aids  (drawings, charts, video, etc.) to help understand the "big picture".   4.   Extra time for thinking  through tests and assignments.  5. Textbooks and assignments with  highlighting  of the most important information and concepts.  6.  Hands-on experiences to use your other senses to learn.   7.  Reduced assignments to avoid feeling overwhelmed.   8.   Concrete examples  and/or demonstrations.   9.   Linking information  to real-life situations.   10.  Encouragement  to go beyond superficial understanding.   11.  Clarification and repetition  of concepts.   12.  Outlines  listing key points and concepts.     And here are some things you can do for yourself:   1. Take more time searching for deeper meaning after completing assignments.   2. Pay attention, watching and listening for any important information you may need.   3. Ask for explanation when you don't understand concepts or meaning.   4. When reading, stop after each paragraph to see if you understood what you read.   5. Take time to break large assignments into smaller(manageable)pieces   This sounds just like me.  EXACTLY like me.  Especially the part about memorizing the details and not understanding them.  That's EXACTLY what I do for social.  When they give us the long answer questions, I write out the answer and then memorize what I am going to write.  This way it seems like I know the information, but really I just memorized it without actually knowing the meaning or understanding.  And the part about finishing assignments quickly, but not understanding is just like me too.  I do the assignments, but I don't really learn anything because I just plainly 'answered' the questions without actually understanding them or going through what they actually mean.   I like concrete examples because I learn from totally structured environments, and often I do need time on tests and stuff like that.  I usually need clarification and ask questions beyond the original information presented - so that one basically hits me dead on.  It's so scary how accurate this is.  Also, this might explain why reading comprehension is so bloody difficult.  It's so true that I can read, I mean reading is not my problem.  My problem is understanding what I have read, which makes it very difficult to answer comprehension questions.  Maybe I have some sort of processing problem, which is why a lot of things are difficult and school can often be frustrating.

           My Bio test was today.  I was really nervous before it.  I think I did bad on it.  I wanted to just burst into tears after it.  I feel really stupid too.  I didn't understand the ratio question and I think even after I asked I still did it wrong.  I think that question was supposed to be easy, but I found it confusing.  As well, I don't think I did so hot on the M.C. part and I got confused on the long answer.  I just feel bad about it.  I do feel a bit better though because I went to say good-bye to my T.A. cause I won't see her again.  We had a long talk and stuff about everything, about school, marks, the Bio final.  She made me feel like everything will be ok.  I just hope it turns out that way.  I studied a lot for that final and put in a lot of effort.  I just wish it would pay off you know.  I know I can't ace everything, but I really deserve to do good on this.

      I thought earlier would be my last post, by I can't help expressing my feelings right now.  I need a break from studying Bio, or my head is going to explode.  You can only study so much til you get totally stressed and everything.  I was just curious.  As for me, curiosity gets me to feelings I don't really want to feel all the time.  I just had to go look at the English marks.  I just had to know so badly.  I got a 64%.  You know what though, I am not really that upset about it.  I put in my 150% effort.  I took my time.  I concentrated.  I believed in myself and in what I was doing.  I used EVERY strategy, yes EVERY strategy I have been taught for reading comprehension.  My average is going to drop, but what counts is that I did my very best.  I guess some people aren't English inclined, or Math inclined, or Chemistry inclined....the list goes on, but frankly that would be demeaning to list what I'm bad at.  I guess I am just the girl who excels at sports, drama, and puts in a lot of effort and tries hard.  That is just me, and I suppose I just have to accept that.  This time I am not going to get upset about a bad mark.  I am going to learn from it.  What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.  And you know, my Bio mark has nothing to do with what I got in English.  I very well believe that with my effort, hard work, and amount of prep time I put in for this final I very well have potential to do good.  I am going to try my best and put my best effort forward, that's all I can do now.  I've learned the material, I've reviewed, I just have to prove what I know and I have to do my best.

      This is truly the last time I write in my journal before the Bio final.  I will probably just do some last minute review of things I did a little bit more time to go over.  I feel very prepared though.  Today was good and I went to school and we performed our Drama Final Project.  Then I went to Tim Hortons and got my fav: BlT bagel, iced tea, and a crueler.  I felt really nervous this morning for some reason.  I didn't even have a final today, and I was nervous.  I was probably nervous cause I know a whole bunch of people were writing their Chem finals and Diploma's today.  Maybe I felt nervous for them.  I think the reality that it's actually the time of finals is starting to kick in.  I do know though that I am 100% capable of doing good on Bio.  I know the stuff.  I studied.  I worked hard.  I asked questions.  I know what I need to do and I am going to do it.  Believe in yourself and you will succeed.  Oh and I saw Ms. LaCour in the hall today.  It's odd how when I was in her Chem class she would say "hi" to me in the hallways.  Now she doesn't even say anything.  It's like she's pretending she's invisible or something.  She did smile at me, cause I smiled at her.  Maybe she thinks I don't like her or something, but that's not that case.  Actually she's one of the best teachers because she's different and she doesn't go changing her style of teaching or whatever to suit your needs.  She has the coolest style - love the clothing.  I actually look up to her as a role model, but shhhhh...that's my secret.  No one needs to know that.

      One down, one to go.  I sit here in front of my computer, thinking to myself and realizing that grade eleven is really over.  After Thursday - that's it.  After the Bio final, I will be in grade twelve starting September.  I keep thinking about University more and more these days too.  I am pretty sure I know what I want to do, and I don't think it's going to change.  Getting into University scares me a lot.  I don't think I could handle rejection.  I mean I can barely handle Chem class as it is.  My biggest goals next year is to get into University and get a scholarship - Maybe one of those Habits of Mind Scholarships they give out to grade twelve's.  I have a good shot for that, especially since I am like miss-I-work-my-ass-off-for-ALL-of-my-marks-and-always-put-my-best-effort-forth.  I also thought that my English exam went really well today.  I took my time.  I concentrated.  I focused on what I needed to do.  I made a strategy.  I did the knowledge questions first, and then the reading comprehension.  This build up my confidence cause I thought the knowledge questions were easy, so when I got to the reading comp I was more relaxed.  However, I did get a major headache half way through cause the exam is like way too long.  Like sitting there for hours, just thinking and using your brain to ultimate capacity is hard on moi!  I so totally thank Proulx for helping my with reading comp. cause like after that it totally make me believe in myself and my ability to do well.  I also think that I might not necessarily have any type of learning problem like I thought before.  I think that I just get stressed out for tests and maybe like test anxiety.  I need for time for things and just need to be more alert and aware.  Maybe that's it.  Maybe that's my problem.  Yeah, I also forgot to post this pic.  It is the day of my sisters grad for graduating in the Youth and Child Care Worker program:

      I have no idea where to begin.  My I-need-to-try-eat-healthy strategy well...I guess I have to try again tomorrow but I am going outs for lunch so that's a hard one.  Anyways I really need to stop worrying about weight, weight gain during exam week is allowed guess.  That is the exception to the I-must-eat-healthy-so-I-can-have-a-nice-figure.  I went to school at about 9:00 AM to review my English.  We went over my reading comprehension one-on-one which REALLY helped.  Then I stayed for the review cause he was going over terms that are on the exam tomorrow.  I wanted to do some Bio review too, but by the time the English review was over it was 11:00 AM and that is when the Bio tutorial ended.  I really have a lot of questions to ask and I want to go over a previous test, so I hope like no one shows up for tutorial tomorrow.  After all half of the people on my Bio class aren't like keeners like me, or have the work ethic of a grade eleven student.  Tomorrow is the big English final.  I studied lots today, and the day before that, and the day before that.  I studied my Bio extensively too.  I feel like I know it like the back of my head.  hopefully she will like totally help me tomorrow with some of the stuff that I need extra review and I am sure that all will go well during, before, and after the English final.

      So here's the truth.  I gained weight...again.  Not like anyone is going to notice that much, but if I keep it up.  I can't help it.  I am addicted to junk, but I am REALLY trying to eat healthy.  I thought my scale was going to like break today.  140.  That is higher than I have been in a LONG while.  I got down to 132.  Then...I ate.  Soon enough back up to 137 where I usually.  Now 140.  I won't let it get any higher.  I can't deal with that.  After exams I need to go to the gym.  I suppose weight gain weekend before exams actually probably isn't that uncommon for most people.  I studied so much today.  I feel like I know my Bio so incredibly well.  I have lots of questions to ask Mrs. J, but tomorrow morning I am going in for English review of comprehension and so I might go do Bio review later, but I will probably just go on Tuesday because I have my English final that day.  Ok so here is my dilemma.  Well actually it's like my feeling  inside, feelings I have had for a long time.  When I talk to people about how I feel, they think I am crazy, insane.  I don't care about that though, because I know I am not.  I am not stupid.  I also don't fail my subjects, but I sometimes (often if it's chem) fail quizzes or tests within my subjects.  I think I have some sort of learning problem.  Actually I am almost certain.  I feel different a lot of times.  Different in the way I do things.  Different in the way I learn things.  There are MANY reasons for these thoughts and feelings.  They are valid and significant, sometimes I wish people would pay more attention to them.  I know I am doing my best to learn and doing pretty good, but there are some adjustments that would make my life much less stressful.    why I believe there is a problem:   -I am a good reader, but don't understand what I read  -Come close or fail reading comprehension  -When able to take read comp. test alone in a room w/ out time restrictions I can score much higher then usual  -Study MANY hours, sometimes all night and space out study sessions and feel as though my marks don't match up with the effort I put in  -Don't have clear understanding of concepts, need to use pure memorization to take tests (ex. Social long answer) I memorize the answer to the questions we are given.  I NEVER actually understood the material, it just seems like I do cause of memorization  -Failed drivers ed, couldn't remember parts of car or what they do.  Have trouble learning rules of the road and actually driving.  My right-of-way judgment is still bad and the parking (no comment), but the driving is getting better.  -When people tell me things, I don't remember unless I write it down  -Some concepts I just can't seem to grasp no matter how hard I try and how much effort I put it (ex. Chemistry ice tables, some Math concepts)  -Have trouble understanding explanations in texts books and understand what Math word problems are asking  -When I was younger I could not tell time or count money (Ex. I remember trying to copy off of another girls tests cause I didn't know what any of the money represented)  -Take and long time to complete tests, feel rushed cause there is usually not enough time to think things through  -Excel and most sports and Drama related activities, but cannot grasp (some) not all concepts for Math, Bio, Chem, English, Social  -Marks ARE good, but because of effort and because I do ALL of my homework, which makes up for the bad test marks  -For years I had hardly any friends and had to stay in during recess (grade 6) to do assignments because they were not "good enough" even though I felt I had done my best.  It felt like a punishment, although I didn't know what I did wrong.  -Thought of suicide many times, about twice I have considered it on a serious level cause of the frustration and stress I have been though?  -Cry on and off many nights because I want to understand and finish my math, but it's frustrating and like foreign and finish chem but no matter what or how many explanations of get, I just can't seem to grasp the concepts  -Marks vary drastically Ex:(English Unit Work: 80%E, English Comp test: 52%) (Chem Quiz: 35%, Chem Lab: 100%, Chem unit test: 73%) (Math Unit Test: 80%, Math Unit Test:52%)  Can anyone say: INCONSISTENCY!  And I just try my best, and those are some of the marks I end up with: 35%, 59%, 45%...That isn't the kind of marks you would expect for a girl like me who works her ass off  -Spend hours and hours on homework, studying, cut out most extra-curricular to focus only on school  -Get anxious and stressed during test, homework is frustrating  -Feel like I need more time one-on-one to understand things.  Ex: Time in math when she sat down (actually many times in this specific unit that I kept asking over and over for help) with me to go through a whole bunch of stuff and I got 80% (highest unit test mark in math for me)  -Feel like I try more that others, work more than others, need help more than other people (A lot more help)  -My mother was born at a low birth rate and also had difficulty in school (I read that those born at low birth rates are susceptible to have problems learning, and I read that learning problems run in families)  Yeah the list just keeps going and going.  So yeah that is why I truly believe there is something wrong.  I wish I knew.  I feel so different or something.  No one struggles as much as I do, and I wish I knew why.  I wish someone could just tell me.  Come straight out and tell me.  I am not stupid.  I study, I work hard, but so many things in my life are frustrating, stressful, and to accomplish things I must go to extreme measures of hard work, hours studying, etc...

      I woke up this morning, reviewed Bio.  Most of my day consisted of...you guessed it...Bio review!!  I am like determined to do good on the final.  I did every question from the review booklet from every unit today.  So now I have like a million things to ask about stuff I am not sure about.  I am going for English help on Monday, and will go to the Bio review on Tuesday.  Wednesday I have to present our Drama final project.  Last night I went to Mat's house for dinner.  It was just the two of us, it was a candle lit dinner with rose pedals on the table.  He made the meal himself.  It was good and pretty nice of him to think of such a think.  I wasn't expecting it, and I was pretty surprised.  I am just worried about a few things.  I am pretty sure I am right too.  First of all, I am pretty sure he likes me for my looks, more than who I am.  He even said "I like you cause you look good, and I assume you think that same for me."  When he said that in my mind I was thinking 'Actually I like you for who you are on the inside, I don't pay attention to looks at all.'  The fact that like none of the guys liked me before last summer, but then I come back thinner then before and they all seem to like me.  Hmmm strange or coincidence, I will be the one to decided.  Then he also is going away for the summer and said "I can't wait to get back, you'll have lost even more weight"  I mean who does he think I am, some kind of super-I-can-loose-weight-really-easy-and-whenever-I-want.  I don't think so!!!  Just cause I lost 50 pounds before, doesn't mean I am going to loose anymore.  I am not trying to loose weight right now and I don't need to cause I look just fine the way I am.  So I think he only likes me for the way I look, that REALLY REALLY REALLY bothers me a lot.  I went out for an early dinner and then to see The Stepford Wives.  That was literally the only break I had from studying all day besides right now and taking a shower.  However, I am done for tonight.  Tomorrow I plan to read my Bio text books unit chapters - as many as I can get through in detail and know all the facts.  That is all I can really do for now, study, study, study, read, read, read, and ask questions.  And do my very best.  And I keep thinking how I got that Habits of Mind award thing for grade 11.  Oh how I worked my ass off for that.  It feels good in the end though.  To know my hard work and effort paid off.  It's a good feelings.  Anyways, so long blog until next time...

      I feel good today.  I only got a 62% on the Bio test, but that is better than what I thought I got cause I thought that I failed.  I KNOW that I could have done better if I wasn't rushed, and had more time, didn't feel pressure to finish, and could just take the time and think through the questions.  I did feel really good today.  I got to use the scantron machine thing and got to scan through like a whole bunch of classes tests.  It was really neat to see how it's actually done, and it was really cool to be able to do it.  I felt good that my English teacher trusted me to do that cause it was sooooo cool.  Then in active living I got to take attendance for the class.  He is also helping me on Monday with my reading comp.  No matter how hard I try, it's difficult.  I think there is like something wrong or something.  It's hard to explain, but I am tired right now and I don't feel like trying cause my Mom wants me to talk to her and I am going over to Mat's for dinner.

      Early this morning was really good.  I went to the recognition breakfast and got my awards.  I got the Habits of Mind award that I have wanted soooo incredibly bad.  Only one teacher nominated me last semester, and to get the award you need three nominations, and I got the award and this year they gave out pins too so now I have one of those.  I worked so hard for that.  All the years effort, hard work, and frustrations paid off for what I wanted really bad.  Chels wouldn't talk to me again this morning.  I didn't do anything wrong though and I never did anything that would make her mad. I am so confused.  I don't know what I did wrong, and well if she keeps this I'm not-talking-to-you-thing up then I have a feeling we might go the entire summer without talking to each other.  I don't want that to happen.  We promised we would be best friends forever, and always lifelong friends.  We don't even talk anymore.  I am busy with things and other people.  She has to realize that I can't spend 24/7 talking to just her.  My world doesn't revolve around her and she needs to understand that.  Bio was really bad today.  I studied a lot for that test.  I study a lot for all the tests.  It was confusing, hard, difficult, and frustrating.  Not to mention it felt like I was in the middle of Hawaii cause the heat was like blasting from the vent near me.  There wasn't enough time for the test, and well I tried to finish it but she had to start class and well I didn't want to keep writing it.  I got confused on the long answer too.  I blanked out or something, it just didn't make any sense.  I know the stuff though, I just don't know how to explain it.  The chart thing we had to interpret made no sense to me.  That was the most frustrating part of all.  It's very very very frustrating knowing that you studied, put in effort, and tried really hard and then you feel like you bombed the test.  It makes you ask: What was my effort for?  Why is it I work so hard and doesn't pay off half of the time?  Why is it that people who study less then me, sometimes get way better marks then me?  I wonder, I wonder, and I wonder.  I will forever wonder I guess.  Why this and why that.  I think I actually got like 0 on that longer answer, seriously I think I got a zero.  I am so scared to see what my mark is.  The last thing I needed was to bomb and test to like totally bring down my mark before finals.  That is the last friggin thing I needed.  Sometimes I just wish things made a little more sense, and weren't so frustrating.

      I can't really say anything exciting happened today.  If anything it was mostly bad.  I mean last night with Mat was fun at the Cadet Awards Banquet, but today well I don't know.  First I went to his house to print some stuff, but then his comp kept freezing.  That sucks cause my printer decided it would feed through 100 pieces of paper instead of 1.  So yeah now I have a jammed printer and can't print anything with color.  Go figure, last week of school before finals and I am like breaking everything in my house.  Mat then came over and we watched Shrek, then we ate too much damn food cause I seriously think my blood pressure must have gone like sky high when I saw that number on the scale today.  Haven't seen it that high in a while, but everyone around me claims I still look the same.  I suppose a bit of weight gain last week of schools and week before finals is to be expected.  It's like the ultimate stress weeks.  Not to mention tomorrow is a pretty big Bio test, cause it's the last chance I have to bring up my mark before the final.  I study so hard for those tests all the time, and everytime I always get a mark that I know I don't deserve.  For the amount of hard work and effort I put it, I truly, honestly, in the deepest part of my heart know for a fact I deserve an 80% on all of those tests.  Life ain't perfect though, and I guess in an un-perfect world, hard work and effort doesn't always pay off.  To make things kind of bad though is that well I haven't talked to Chels in a while.  That in itself isn't that bad, except she was talking to Mat about how I didn't talk to her anymore, and she thinks I am mad cause 'there's never enough time to spend with her.'  So I don't know exactly what her problem is at the moment.  I asked her to talk today and you know what she said "no."  So now a girl who was my best friend won't even talk to me, in fact I have said maybe like three things to her in like the last two weeks.  I don't want to be like non-communicative or anything, but it's kind of hard when someone doesn't want to talk to you.  I mean there isn't a lot I can do about anything, and I can't force her to talk.  I didn't even realize there was a problem cause I don't have any problems with her right now.  It just seems that she has some sort of problem with me and it's bothering me that I don't know what it is.  tomorrow I am picking up Mat and going to that Recognition Breakfast.  Finally the moment of truth when I get to open up my awards envelope and see if any other teacher other than my T.A. nominated me for Habits of Mind.  I want that award again this year so badly, that is what I am aiming for.  I worked so hard all year.  You have to have three nominations though, which means that two of my teachers would have to nominate me from the current semester.  I can definitely say I tried very hard, and hopefully two of them did.  Although see the thing is that two of my teachers from last year that nominated me I have this semester.  I don't know if they would nominate me again, but I mean if I have habits of mind one year then I would assume no much would have changed.  So I know I deserve it again.  I think I should stop thinking about it though cause I am going to worry myself too much.  What happens, will just happen tomorrow I guess.  And whatever way things turn out, then that is just the way it's going to be.

      It's the second half time of the flames game.  We're losing anyways.  My mom told me she was going to Ben and Melissa's and then pick up a milkshake for me.  She told me this like three hours ago.  I waited forever for her, I was worried something happened.  Then she calls and says that she is still at their place and staying like a hour longer.  Like what the FUCKING HELL I AM SUPPOSE TO DRINK A MILKSHAKE AT 11 AT FUCKING NIGHT JUST CAUSE MY SISTER WAS MORE IMPORTANT THAN ME.  FLAMES SUCK AS RIGHT NOW.  You know I was going to go to a party, but I stayed home cause she always complains how I always leave during the game.  I hate myself right now.  I want to die.  I want to kill myself.  You have no idea how fucking tempted I am to find some pills in the cupboard and swallow the whole damn thing.  If only someone was here right now.  But no, I'm all alone, no one is here.  I feel like no one cares.  I feel like I don't even have a mother.  That's nice and dandy that I own a car, and a laptop, and million other friggin things.  That doesn't matter ,though.  I want to be happy.  I want someone to care about me.  I want someone to be here right now.  My mom doesn't barely ask any questions or anything.  She's too busy.  Too busy with everything but me.  I wish Mrs. J was here right now.  I just wish I could talk to her.  She is the one person in the world who truly cares about people.  She cares.  She asks questions.  She takes interest in things.  I just want a mother like that.  Some one who cares and puts me first, makes me feel important, and makes me feel like I possess talents and can accomplish a a lot of things in life.

      It was a half day today.  We only had to go for the afternoon, so I picked up Mat and we watched finding Nemo til' school started.  Also the people at the gas station must have thought I was retarded.  I couldn't get my fuel door thing open, like the nob thing you twist.  So after like a minute I decided that the smart thing to do is ask someone, so I asked a lady and she could barely get it off too!!  But well she was like "you just have to twist, and give it a pull" so yeah I think the guys in the building were like laughing their ass off, but whatever.  All that matters is that I have a full tank now, lol.  Drama was good today, watching Finding Nemo was the highlight of my day.  Mrs. J talking to me was the 2nd highlight of the day.  She is so damn cool, I want to be like her someday.  And well yeah that was my day, and this morning I studied Bio.  Exciting stuff!!  Lol!

      I barely slept last night.  All I could think of was the Flames loss, my Bio test on Tuesday, the fact that the upcoming week is the last week of school, and the fact that finals aren't this week, but one more week from that.  There is so much to worry about.  Friday I spent working on our Drama Final Project, then I went to Mat's and helped Ash and him on their Chem project.  Then I had dinner at Mat's and spent the night with him.  Saturday morning I reviewed a bit of Bio, went shopping (I bought some tanks, skirts, shorts, and two dresses - one of them for the Cadet Awards Banquet Mat and I are going to, which he is going to fall over when he see's me in that dress cause it's hot n' sexy), then I got home, relaxed, and went to a Flames Game Party thing at Ashleys and we had a barbecue and party.  It was fun, though would have been better in the Flames actually won.    This morning I woke up and read over my Bio text, ate a lot - Way too much but I think it's the weather.  The rain is putting me is some kind of I-want-to-keep-eating-mode-even-though-I'm-not-hungry and some sort of depressed state.  Well actually a depressed state until I studied my Bio tonight.  Studying at night is easier than studying during the day.  I feel like I am kind of getting a grasp on this stuff now, and before it felt very foreign.  It's kind of a bad thing though that the game is on tomorrow and my Bio test is the next day - but I will just study in between periods and well partially during the game.  Once I studied during play rehearsals while I was off stage and I did good, so I am not going to miss a game for studying.  I am however going to miss another Flames Game Party though, cause I turned down the offer.  I know that if I go to that I won't have time to study - and quite honestly Bio is more important than hockey.  Bio is going to be my life and career so I better do good.  Anyways, yeah that is what's new.  Tomorrow I going to the bank, the filling up my tank, then picking up Mat for 11:00 AM and going to school a bit earlier to eat and just talk and stuff.  Yeah that's all for now.  GO FLAMES GO!    And I pray to God, For all my effort, all my hard-work help me get through Bio and raise my average.  This is the last week I have to raise my average before the final.  God I also thank you for the amazing and wonderful people in my life.  You know who I am talking about - There's so many!  ;)

      Yeah, ok so I am suppose to be in English right now but we have a sub and I happen to be like totally tired today.  Ok, and a little (no actually majorly) yeah majorly stressed out.  Bio makes no sense.  It's great for all of those I-understand-every-damn-thing-always-kind-of-people, but it just sucks that I am not one of them.  Last time I studied my life away and my mark sucked, and this unit makes no sense.  I don't know what to do to understand.  I actually felt really stupid asking her "how do I do this?" and "How do I do that."  Bio is suppose to be my thing.  It's something I like, but sometimes hard work doesn't get me to where I want to be.  I suppose what ever will happen is going to happen.  No matter what I have basically passed it course it's just University standards are becoming way higher and it's harder to get it and that scares me sometimes.  I think all will be ok, and things will work out, but sometimes I just really have to question things like that.  I need to question choices, options, etc... but I am absolutely certain that I want to be a Bio teacher and I am going to do anything that will get me there.  I feel like such a bitch today.  Maybe it's cause I feel lazy or ate too much junk for breakfast.  Maybe that's it, but I really don't know.  I'm glad flames won yesterday, but really I would rather have like a thousand other things then just a win.  Maybe I am so stressed out cause finals are coming, school is almost over, and it seems like I have no time.  I am so busy this weekend!!!!  After school today Ali, Carli, Meg and I are working on our drama project for a couple of hours and then I might go over to Mat's house and help him and Ash on their Chem project.  Knowing how things usually work I will probably be the one doing the project instead of them.  Ya that is how it usually works - guess that is what you get for being totally nice.  But I like it, nice is the way to go.  I finished my English project of poems and that's why I am taking a break.  I haven't written anything down in my journal forever.  I just need to get things of.  Not to mention I have been eating like massive loads of junk food all the time.  It's strange though cause I can only eat large amounts of food when I am alone and no on is looking.  Whenever there are others around I eat really healthy and not very much.  They sometimes think I stave myself, but that's not that case.  If anything I eat too much.  I got drunk at the wedding, but it was all in good fun.  Me and this uncle Mike we like doing a disco solo to 'staying alive' which I kind of remember - it was crazy, wicked fun!  And like Ben's side of the family kept buying me alcohol - a lot of coke with rum's, I had white wine, red wine, punch, and water.  All day it was like RUSH, RUSH, RUSH!!  We had to put up signs, basically swallow our lunch whole cause there was no time to chew, and get our hair done, do our make-up, and yeah just way too much.  On the Friday before the Saturday I got my nails done, went out to Boston Pizza with the Mid Summer Night's Dream Cast.  We ordered like 3 appetizers, 2large piazza's, and like 5 desserts.  Then we went back to Alex's house, jumped on the tramp, ate and drank more, and played a million improve games like party quirks etc...  So fun, so fun!  The day after the wedding we went to Jim's place and ate more.  We had French toast, eggs, sausage, left over cage, brownies, chile, butter tarts, cinnamon buns, muffins- Yeah, ok, get the idea - We had WAY TO MUCH to eat!  tomorrow I am going shopping for a dress for the Cadet Awards Banquet, I need to also get some tanks and shorts that actually fit too!  All my old clothes are too big.  Early that morning I am helping my Mom with the garden and then in the evening there is a party at Ashley's house, dinner, food, and we are watched the game on her big screen T.V.  Yeah GO FLAMES GO!  And then Sunday I have to memorize my lines for our Drama final project and believe me there are a lot of lines.  Then I need to study my Bio - well actually figure it out.  Analyze it.  It's like a friggin foreign language.  So difficult.  So hard.  Everything in school and life in hard though so it's not like there is any difference fro before.  Monday night I am also going to bust my ass studying.  It's my last chance to raise my mark before the final.  That's it.  The end.  Last chance.  Scary thinking about it.  But I pray to God that I do good, because I deserve it, work hard for the marks I have and the marks I want.  I want to go places.  I want to be something in life, and I will.  I know I will.  I can do whatever I want to do because I know that I can.  I am capable of anything and the world knows that.

      I can't even remember the last time I was online. I am trying to think where I left off, I think it was last Friday. I went to the Cher concert that evening. Saw her wearing outfits with more colors that could ever be imagined by the human eye. That was pretty cool and only my second concert ever. (My first concert was Back Street Boys when I was in gr. 5) lol. Oh, the memories. I think I went to the mall on the Weekend, but I can't remember. All that comes to mind is my Summer School teachers voice saying "Don't make plans for the weekend, you have too much to do." That's pretty sad when all I can remember is that. I swear I am like memory challenged in some ways. This is going to sound strange, but like I forget sometimes if I washed my hair in the morning. Sometimes I will be in the shower, look down at the shampoo bottle, and think to myself: Did I already wash my hair!! (As far as I know, no one else does that) I have thrown cutlery in the garbage by accident, took my empty bowl to the laundry room, and when carrying down my dirty clothes from upstairs I took them to the garbage can. It's kind of scary all the things I forget and mix up now. These are things I do at 16 (almost 17....August is coming) and well I hate to imagine what I am going to be like at 40!  Tracking my life back to Monday I remember that at teen night, we all played Kinball. (Fun game) and Chels and I got to teach everyone how to "properly" play the game. I came up with our team name and we called ourselves Neon. Yeah! Of course we won...cause I mean I am like amazingly talented at sports. That's if you exclude baseball because I could only hit myself in the head with that thing like five times. Later that night we went out for dinner at like 8:30 but didn't end up eating until like 9:00. I had an amazing rice bowl at moxies, Andy had steak, and Chels had pasta. Then Chels and I split our favorite - the White Chocolate Brownie. On Wednesday, we went bowling (I won both the 5 and 10 pins games I played) and well we had pizza and pop. That was like the first time I have had pop in months cause I don't drink it much anymore. I am anti- pop. Too much sugar, and bad for the body baby!  Today it was my last official day of Summer School. I suppose you could say I am finished Social 30. I just have to write the diploma next week and that's it. I wouldn't do Summer School again though. I didn't exactly get the mark I know I could have gotten if I had done the program at B.O.B. I got a 71% for now, until the diploma. I can't blow that test. My life depends on it, or ay least it seems. University will be looking at marks, and that is the only 30 mark I will have in at the time they look at my transcrit. I don't want them to be thinking like "Well, if this girl got a 90% in Social 10, 82% in 20, and 70% or somethin' in Social 30...then what is she going to get in her other courses. I suppose it's because I scored BELOW the class average on all the unit tests we did except for one (The one that was based on FACTS, not reading and interpreting) My essays were good for the most part (The last one could of used some work cause we had to write on a topic I didn't feel I could defend my position strongly) Also, if I were to hand in those same essays I wrote at B.O.B. I would have for sure got 100%. I realized how easy and slack our School's Social program is. I did good on all of my assignments too. Plain and simple, I am bad at tests. I understand why now too.  COMPREHENSION . That sums it up in one word. I don't understand what I read. It's frustrating. How do you make yourself understand what you just read???? I still had yet to figure that one out. This is becoming a big problem for me though. I can't achieve what accurately understand or answer questions because comprehension affects my performance on social exams, math word problems, English (that is a big one) and when I study. It kind of reminds me of the time I asked Mrs. J how she like studies and what helps her to go good. She told me: You need to read your texts book. However, when she said that, for EVERY unit test I had previously done I had read over ALL those chapters MORE THAN ONCE. Then one morning that confirmed by issues with reading comp. is when I asked her some Bio questions about how the book said like one thing and the notes totally describe dsomething different. Then she was like "Well it's just the comprehension, they are really the same things," but in NO way, shape, or form did I believe they were the same. I am still confused about that actually. I was confused on the unit test, and confused on the final. I guess you could say that it's frustrating knowing that you know a lot of things, and just can't score the marks you feel should reflect your effort. It's so frustrating you know. Well I mean I know, and highly doubt anyone would care to understand. And GRRRRR my Dad doesn't understand, and was like well you should be studying more for that Diploma. I would like to see him take the course. My Mom at least can except that fact that work my ass off for the marks I get and have, and they they solely reflect MY hard work and effort. It's never good enough for my Dad. I am just never friggin good enough. And I need to score at least 70% on the diploma to keep me near that 71%. 71% is so far the lowest mark going on my transcript...it just can't be any lower. It can't be!!!!!!!!!!!!! Just can't, and I won't let it.  I actually had second thoughts about my career choice today, but yes I am still going to be a Bio teacher no matter what it takes. No matter what I have to do. I just thought about the alternatives. Everyone always says "Chose a job with your strengths and talents." The really of the statement - Well hmmm, I am going against the grain on this one. Math isn't my talent, Chem isn't my talents, and well I would exactly consider Bio one of my talents either. These are my interests. Things I am passionate about (INCLUDING Math, even though it stresses me out and makes me cry like 235 days out the the year trying to understand) This is what I love. I love Bio, I love Chem, and I love math. So, I guess I am just following my heart. I am going to do what I love. Though today I thought about the easy way out. I thought about maybe applying to like some drama related program at University. I thought about how much easier it would be. I wouldn't have to struggle with the math, or be stressed about now understanding Math problems or Chemistry labs. I thought about it. I thought about it until I realized that it's the easy way out. I am not about the easy way. When have I ever taken the easy way out???LOL...Yeah good question. Answer = Never. Some how I always surprise myself with what I am capable of with my 250% best effort towards everything I do. Some people see this effort, some people are blind. Other people just don't really give a shit, but that is just the way it is. Anyways, I realized that I would regret it forever if I chose Drama over Science. Drama is fun, but not a passion. I want create a life that revolves around something that will keep me interested forever.

      Life's been fun!&nbsp; On Wednesday Chels and I went to one of those off-trips the City has and we had a barbecue and were taught how to play Frisbee golf.&nbsp; It was a lot of fun but really tiring because there were too many hills!!&nbsp; Each group had their own "specialist" or expert that were part of the Frisbee golf association.&nbsp; Chels and I got a hot guy named Kevin.&nbsp; Anyways, I didn't see Aaron.&nbsp; I guess he didn't come to visit this year.&nbsp; I suppose Halifax is far away.&nbsp; I wish I didn't loose him number and just ignore him at the end of last summer.&nbsp; I constantly think about him and wonder where he is.&nbsp; I wish I could see him because I miss him.&nbsp; Am am strongly guided by my heart and intuition and I KNOW that I loved Aaron.&nbsp; If I saw him again, I wonder if that feeling would come back.&nbsp; I just miss him a lot.&nbsp; I had TRUE love with him.&nbsp; Never felt anything else like it since!!&nbsp; All the Calgary guys are strange, at least the ones I know.&nbsp; Thank goodness Mat and I broke off.&nbsp; Clearly their if NO love at all, and I question our friendship because of some of the things he has said.&nbsp; I am still kind of pissed off with him and I don't think he will be getting invited to my party at the end of the summer.&nbsp; I don't care what he thinks of me not inviting him either.&nbsp; Plain and simple it's my choice and that's final!!!   Anyways I was pretty nervous for my next position paper in Social today because we didn't get the topic before hand, but&nbsp;I mean it was so amazing!!&nbsp; If I don't get like 90% on that I am going to have to kill someone.&nbsp; It was purely amazing writing with supporting examples - far more than I am sure anyone else provided.&nbsp; I feel so good because I just knew the information.&nbsp; Unlike Social at BOB I always had to purely memorize the info.&nbsp; It felt SOOOOOO good just to not memorize pages and pages of information.&nbsp; It was SOOOOOOOO less stressful.&nbsp; I mean I was sill nervous, but I mean that just took stress to another lever.&nbsp; A very low lever.&nbsp; Not to mention everyone was like: "Nice dress" and well it made me feel good.&nbsp; It sparked convo with a lot of people in my class that I haven't even talked to.&nbsp; I talked to this really nice girl Andrea that is from Grandin and this guy from Marys.&nbsp; Our convo started with school of course, but then once I started it he just continued and we talked for like the next ten minutes.&nbsp; It was good.&nbsp; The unit we are doing right now is a bit confusing because it's like an overload of history in a few days.&nbsp; I also have to do an individual unit on the weekend.&nbsp; Then a test Monday, test Friday, and third position paper on Wednesday.&nbsp; Once Friday comes it's all over...and then the Diploma.   I just realized something.&nbsp; I can do just about anything I put my mind to.&nbsp; If I say I want it, then I get it.&nbsp; If I say I am going to do something, then I certainly do it.&nbsp; I also discovered why I have problems with so many things sometimes.&nbsp; It all comes down to comprehension and memory.&nbsp; Tests are confusing cause half of the time I don't understand what the question is asking.&nbsp; I don't always learn info from texts cause since I can comprehend 100% I miss some important details.&nbsp; When I read I forget what I just read until I read a thousand times again and again.&nbsp; Then there is memory.&nbsp; I can study a lot, then get to a test and only "partially" remember something.&nbsp; Since I only remember part of something it makes me mix things up in my mind.&nbsp; I find myself debating with my own conscience half of the time.   Summer School is great.&nbsp; I have become more accepting of the fact that YOU CAN'T ALWAYS DO GOOD ON EVERYTING!!!&nbsp; I have turned negative thoughts into positive ones.&nbsp; It goes a long way.&nbsp; When I score bad on a test or&nbsp; quiz I tell myself: It's only a test or a quiz, there will be others.&nbsp; You can't always be perfect.&nbsp; Now that I think of it, chosing to do Summer School has helped me gain confidence I didn't even know I had stored in me.&nbsp; It has helped me to become independent cause I mean for the longest time I didn't talkto anyone and has to "go it alone."&nbsp; It has also helped me to be less critical of myself and long the the brighter and more positive aspects of life!!

      Ok, so I will give my story of my life since I last wrote in my journal.&nbsp; Saturday I ATE too much again and went to the Chuck Wagons and Outdoor Show - that was exciting and my some gift of God I have managed to eat like a cow (wait a min...cows eat grass...lol) and gain NO weight - scary, but it's a good thing.&nbsp; Then Monday we had a substitute&nbsp;for Summer School (not like I haven't seen enough of those in my lifetime) , but I liked him a lot.&nbsp; He was pretty good, maybe even a bit better&nbsp;at explaining things.&nbsp; Then during that night I picked up Chels and Andy and went to the Teen Night thing out here cause it' fun and something to do - Even though I have too many hours of homework.&nbsp; However, like two minutes after getting there we got rained out so we went back to my house.&nbsp; I ate dinner&nbsp;and then we played Catopoly.&nbsp; Later on it stopped raining and walked back up the the teen night.&nbsp; We made shirts again this year that say: South Side Gals, and then our nicknames on the back.&nbsp; They also have a karokee system this year, and we are having an 80's night where we all have to come dresses as someone from the 80s and everything, with 80's karokee.&nbsp; Oh, I am so excited.&nbsp; Chels and I am OBSESSED with the 80's!!&nbsp; That was the coolest decade ever!!!   Today I got my mid-term report for Social 30.&nbsp; 78%!!!!!!!&nbsp; How did I manage that one.&nbsp; I like practically failed half of my tests and quizzes.&nbsp; I even beat the guy from St. Marys on the average.&nbsp; By the sound of it I also beat everyone on their essays.&nbsp; Everyone was like oh...50, 60...I got 81!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&nbsp; Anyways, that is all I can write.&nbsp; I am a busy gal.&nbsp; Gotta study tonight and go out right now!!&nbsp; So long...

      I think taking summer school may have been a mistake, but I know how badly I just need to get a course out of the way.&nbsp; I like Summer School, the class structure is good - but my marks are anything but good.&nbsp; I found out I got a 60% on the last unit test and a 55% on the quiz.&nbsp; I did my best and I studied.&nbsp; I have done every single homework assignment assigned and have studied for each quiz and test.&nbsp; I am so afraid that Social 30 could affect my chances of getting into University.&nbsp; I hadn't been obsessing over the possibility of getting rejected for a while now, but our teacher keeps mentioning that "not everyone has the right to education" either because of financial situations or admission requirements.&nbsp; He told us to take a look around and realize that not everyone in the class will get accepted into University.&nbsp; That just made me realize the reality of it all.&nbsp; There is no such thing as a "hard work" mark or "effort" mark.&nbsp; There are only numbers to define students.&nbsp; I will be just another number, and just another statistic - % of people rejected/% of people accepted.&nbsp; I am so afraid.&nbsp; I know how badly I want to get in.&nbsp; I know how much I want to go to University.&nbsp; I am still going to stick through to the end of Social 30 though.&nbsp; I am too far now, and whatever my mark I am pretty sure I AM NOT redoing it because I need spares this year.&nbsp; Last year I didn't have any and that just about killed me.&nbsp; I just about killed myself some nights too, trying to deal with the Chem and Math.&nbsp; I don't want to give up on myself, it's just that marks like 69%, 60%, and 55% have me worried.&nbsp; I am doing all I can though.&nbsp; A part of me just wants to cry for some reason, I guess because I am really trying to succeed, but the I think to myself what good would that do??&nbsp; I mean I like school, I am dedicated, and constantly keep up with homework and studying.&nbsp; There is not much more that I can do, so I guess I just have to stick it through to the end.&nbsp; What ever happens happens, because I seem to have very little control over my mark at the moment.&nbsp; Everything always works out in the end one way or another, so I suppose this is no different.   Well, ok so that is my like depressing little side to me right now, but I did just come back from Stampede.&nbsp; I went to watch the hypnotist twice, and ate A LOT of food.&nbsp; I had some ice cream, cheese burger and fries,&nbsp; Stompin' Strawberry drink from Jugo Juice, half of a lemonade drink and half of a strawberry fruit shake - so good by the way.&nbsp; I think I am going to get another one tomorrow when we go the the Chuck Wagons and the outdoor show.&nbsp; I also got an amber heart pendant thing which I am going to attach my white gold chain too.&nbsp; anyways, I am going to some Stampede lunches and breakfasts tomorrow.&nbsp; I am going to Stampede again, and well Sunday I have lots of Social work to do.&nbsp; I just pray to God that no matter what happens, no matter what mark I end up with in Social 3o, just PLEASE make sure I get into University.&nbsp; I want to get in...and I deserve it.&nbsp; Just thinking about rejection upsets me, and I can't handle being upset!!!&nbsp; God, I pray to you.&nbsp; Please.

      Today alone I was assigned 23 questions (by the way each of them had like four parts to them), 4 chapters to read, and an assignment due Tueday that I haven't started yet because I am too energy drained from everything else I have been doing.  I don't believe those rumors of "summer school is easy."  If anything it's A LOT more work then ever!!  I had another unit test today - guessed a lot of questions actually.  It's difficult to do old diploma questions and infer from article, sources, and pictures.  Knowing knowledge is one thing, but tests are another.  Truthfully, I actually do care what I get on it.  I did my best - that is what counts.  I am not going to worry or get fed up with anything.  I am simply going to just keep on working hard.  We have already written one position paper and have another like next week or the week after.  I have had like two unit tests and about five quizzes if not more.  I lost track along the way.  I haven't really made any friends in Summer School other than the ones I know, because all the people are strange and most of them know each other.  I am truly finding out what it is like to "go it alone."  Between Stampede, Monday Teen Night's, and Wednesday off trips that begin next week I am going to be a busy girl.  Next Wednesday if what I must wait for.  It is when I get to find out of Aaron is back for the Summer.  If God meant for us to be together he will be back because I LOVE him.  I miss him so much and breaking off at the end of last summer was a big mistake.  I gave up something that I have never had with anyone else.  I gave up a feeling that since I have not seen him, I have not felt it.  Love.  Aaron is a true example of love at first sight.  I didn't believe in it until I met him.  I need to see him again.  HEADLINE: Calgary Girls Searches for Long Lost Halifax Boy - That is going to be me if I don't see him for the next few years.  I can't go on that long with out him.  I need him.  I need to see him.  I need to talk to him.  I love him.  On Monday we are making shirts again this year and I think Chels and I are suppose to be brainstorming a good name to put on em' this year.  Last year we were the "South Side Girls," this year we have the cleaver idea of being the "South Side Womanizers" yeah now that's cool!! LOL ;)  On Wednesday we are doing some BBQ thing and doing disk golf.  I can't wait til' Friday cause I get to go to Stampede again and this time I am going to see the hypnotist cause he is like so amazing.  Then Saturday Meg and I are going to a Stampede breakfast in my area, then we are going to some Stampede lunch in McKenzie.  Then later that night I am going to the Chuck Wagons and Grand Stand Show cause that is like the best.  OMG I love Stampede, and it will such when it's over.  I am just about half way through Summer School too!!  Thank goodness.  I have such a passionate hate for social and history.  It makes no sense really, not like it ever did.  I have more common sense of current issues it todays world rather than the "old time" issues and conflicts that were occurring.  Whatever though, as long as I pass Social 30 all is well.

      Today was fun despite the morning.  My parents were arguing again.  I think I liked things better when my Dad lived in Vancouver.  Now I understand why I lack confidence half and the time and doubt myself.  Over and over my dad kept saying "You guys are so stupid" to me and my mother.  Now I remember why I lack confidence in things like Math.  I remember I used to ask him how to do things and then if I didn't understand he would get upset with me.  I kept thinking in my head this morning: I wish my parents would divorce.  I felt so strongly like that this morning.  It made me want to cry just listening to them go at it, and there I was right in the middle of it.  The argument didn't even have anything to do with me, yet my Dad put it as "you guys are so stupid."  I mean sometimes my parents are fine, but old age has turned my Dad into Mr. Grumpy.  I don't like it.  That is not the person I know or thought I knew.  Anyways, despite that we picked up Megz and went to Stampede.  We walked around inside and checked out the art exibits and all the both things.  We also pretended to be really interested in products so we got tons of free samples.  Then we got pizza and mini-donuts.  I don't even want to think about how much fat were in those, but they were good and I don't eat those everyday.  Then we went to the Rodeo which was pretty excited.  Except I am not really into bull-bustin or any of that stuff.  The barrel racing was pretty exciting.  I have to admit that my favourite parts were before the Rodeo when the Stampede Showband performed, during the Indian Hoop Dance, and part of the show where the rodeo clown dressed up as if he came from different eras: 70's, 80's, 90's and it was really funny.  To say the least all the non-related Rodeo things were my favourite, lol.  It wasn't that bad though, it was pretty entertaining.  Then later on we went for dinner and then Megz and I went to those boths where u get old fashioned picks and we dressed up like the older days and got a pic taken like that.  It is sooooooooooo hilarious.  My Mom was killing herself laughing.  Then we went to see a whole bunch of animals and stuff and that was about it.  When I got home I had to work on my position paper for social 30.  We get Monday's class to write it, but I wanted to get a head start.  Here's that picture we got taken at the Stampede today.  And by the way that outfit makes me look fat, my stomach is NOT that big.  It is a misleading misconception.  Anyways, still looking good!  lol ;)

      Now I know why my marks seemed to shoot up when my Dad lived in Vancouver all the time.  Here my parents go again.  Blah, blah, blah, fight, fight, fight.  It makes me feel like I did something wrong or something.  It's actually not about money this time though.  Believe it or not.  My Dad can't find some important envelope so he is like raving and ranting all over the house.  I chose to sit here at my laptop and just be silent - invisible.  Things are better that way.  Other wise, I will end up being yelled at and blamed.  I really don't need that.  On Monday I have to write a position paper in class for Social 30 and tomorrow I get to go to Stampede.  I am excited about that.  Megz and I are going to the rodeo too!  I also have tons of homework again!  So much!!!!  I mean I am crazy to sign up for Summer School!!  The teacher is really really good though, but the info we learn is fast.  I will admit I find it difficult to learn, but I am doing pretty good.  Now I know what it feels like to "go it alone" cause I don't really know or talk much to anyone.  Most of them are kids that normally go to Grandin and they are all strange.  There is one guy from Mary's - my competition, and the rest from O'Byrne that all the smoker-drinker people.  I chose NOT to socialize with those that smoke and drink.  Besides it's again getting a good mark, not about socializing and making friends.  I just have to keep reminding myself: Three more weeks, diploma, then I am DONE SOCIAL for the REST OF MY LIFE.  I can almost taste it.  That is my motivation.  Considering I hate Social with a passion, except for Model UN.  That is really fun, and the way the UN works and is organized is actually pretty interesting.  I don't even know why the hell Social is mandatory anyways.  I mean thirty years from now I am not going to be like "Hey, remember the tactics that Stalin used?"  Like, I DON'T think so!!!!!  And for English, why do I need that to the 30 level??  I want to be a Bio teacher not an English teacher!!  Who cares how well you can interpret Shakespeare and use guessing ability on reading comprehension tests.  What gets me the most is how people DON'T need Math and Sciences to the 30 level.  I think ANY DAY logic and reason are MUCH MORE important than stupid history and English.  I know I am right too.  Those English and Social nerds just hit it lucky that's all.  Then there are people like me - who like Science and Math. (math is hard, but yes I admit it I find it interesting) They are just making the Science and Math nerds do more shit that they really don't need in their schedule.  I have enough courses as it is.  If I didn't have to do English and Social I could spend more of my youthful years doing more productive things and things that would enjoy.  I could take more option classes and have more time to relax.  But...NOOOOOOO...Government...school boards...who ever thought it was a good idea to make make Social and English to the 30 level mandatory and only Science and Math to the 20 level mandatory had too many screws loose.  History and English are merely a waste of time.  Society should be educated to use logic and reason.  To critically examine situations, learn to interpret, and experiment.  Those are the essentials.  Anyways, talking about that is not going to change anything.  Lately I have been having nightmares and thoughts about university.  I even dreamt I was in University one night, but I was taking some performing Arts program, lol.  I like acting, drama, dance, and performing but would NOT do that as a career.  I am scared though.  Scared for the future.  I wish my marks were higher from the previous years, but I tried my best.  Sometimes your best isn't always enough though.  I want to go to Univeristy so badly.  I want to get in so badly.  When the applications come out online in live Oct/Nov I am going to apply as soon as possible.  It's so stressful though.  Just all the articles in the newspaper talking about how difficult it is to get accepted now a days, and I mean even all the teachers during school time telling us all how important it is that we focus and concentrate on acedemics.  I read about a month ago in the Herald that what Universities do now is that they start at the top - those with the highest marks, and then work their way to the bottom - those with the lowest marks.  I have to compete with those people wanting to be doctors, dentists, all that other stuff that requires you to be like super smart.  I just want to get so badly.  I don't want rejection.  I don't know if I could even handle rejection.  I need to consider the possibility that I might not get in.  My marks are nothing amazing and don't stand out as much as other peoples do.  My marks don't suck, and are not bad, but compared to others with 90 averages I just can't compete.  That is not in my range.  I already try my best and get in the 70's on most cores and in the 80's and 90's on other things.  My mom knows this lady whose son got rejected and had a 90 overall average.  I mean EVERYONE in Canada should have a right to higher level education.  Marks should not be everything, but really they are.  Marks are everything when it comes to your future.  Marks determine whether you will be accepted or not accepted.  That then would determine the career path.  One more year of high school and then I am off to bigger and better things.  I work so hard for what I want soooooo incredibly bad.  It's my dream to teach.  When I am standing infront of a high school bio class teaching bio, that is when I can sit back and know that my hard work, effort, dedication, and persistence though the challenging Math, Chem, and a variety of other subjects.  That is the one day I dream of.  I can picture it.  I can "see" it in my mind.  I don't want to anything else but be a teacher.  That is what I was put on Earth to do.  I can hear a voice in my head telling me that is what I am to do.  It's just so right.  I love school, love kids, and would love to be the one to influence and help and support others one day.  All that depends on one thing though.  If I get accepted when I apply for University.  That can make or break everything.  I have to consider it though.  I don't even know what to do if I don't get in.  I guess try again next year, but for the mean time if that happens I guess I will go along with things.  See where my life takes me.  I NEED to get in though, I don't really want to think of the other possibility of being rejected too much.  I believe that I can get in, and I want to get in.  I deserve to get it.  Ok, and now I am thinking about this way too much!  I guess I will just have to wait until the time applications come out in the fall.  Then I will go from there.

      We had done so much.  Social 30 is challenging.  It's difficult in some aspects and like a lot of people in my class seem super smart.  It kind of bothers me or intimidates me.  Mainly for that fact that we wrote a unit test today and it just took me a long time.  Some people finished really quick and scored really high.  I want to be one of those people.  No matter what though, it takes me a long time.  I kind of lost my focus near the end of the test too because everyone was being a distraction cause half of the people were done.  I felt like I was under pressure.  That probably lost me a few percent.  The test was difficult, but it was also composed of previous questions from previous diploma's.  I felt really "slow" though, like everyone was good at test taking and like I just couldn't answer anything as fast as anyone else.  I don't know if that is a bad thing, because maybe I just think things through.  I only got a 69% on the test though.  I know the information.  I know I know it.  However, I stopped my self-defeating thoughts this time and told myself that it's "ok."  A mark is a mark, and marks don't determine your future.  Twenty years from now, no one is going to care what I got in Social 30.  Anyways the questions were difficult.  The answers were all so close.  Social exams remind me of reading comp, and anyone who knows me knows that reading comp is the one thing I LEAST excel at.  Not to be degrading or anything, that's just plainly the truth.  I have more things to talk about.  My nightmares about not getting into university, my fears of next year, so much stuff.  I am really tired right now though from all the reading and homework and studying.  Summer School is a lot of work and requires a lot of effort.  This is yet just another challenge for me.  Just another challenge in which I will prove myself.  My dedication, hard-work, effort.  It will be all worth it in the end.

      I AM SO SICK.  I thought I was going to die yesterday like two hours after lunch.  I went to the third floor of sears and got a salad w/ chicken for lunch w/ a muffin.  It was good at the time.  Then like two hours later my stomach really hurt.  Then this morning it was sooooo difficult to concentrate in Summer School and I can't miss classes cause then you get kicked out.  I even had to throw up in the middle of class.  I could feel the acid coming up and I know it wasn't going to stay don't so I quickly asked to go the the washroom and pucked up green and yellow stuff.  I am thinking my salad from yesterday.  All I ate this morning was two bites from my cereal and when I felt a little bit better (not 100% better) I wanted some fast food.  I have lost a a lot of weight too going to the washroom and throwing up, so I really didn't care if I had a happy meal from McDonalds.  That was so good!!  I haven't had one of those for years cause I usually don't eat anything from Mcdonalds.  The burger was small and so was the drink - a nice portion size for someone who is sick.  My mom had to finish my fries cause I was full and I was proud that I actually finished my small burger cause that was hard to get down.  That is the only real meal I had all day.  Usually I don't drink pop either, but something in it makes me feel better.  Luckily I felt ok when I wrote my quiz today and well my unit test is Thursday so I still have tomorrow to study.  I just really want to feel better tomorrow.  I don't want to be sick now.  I CAN'T miss Summer School.  I just want to get Social over with.  I do like Summer School though.  This is the first time I have actually ever found Social interesting.  Anyways I am going to watch TV cause I have been doing all the readings and assignments for the course earlier.  There is A LOT and it takes a while!  Anyways, hope I feel better tomorrow.

      I think it's a good thing I am keeping my brain active.  I think since I am doing Social 30, when I got back to school for the regular year I won't have forgotten so much.  In fact, I recall most of the recent stuff I have learnt.  There is a lot of homework though.  I have e quiz tomorrow and a unit test either Wenedsay or Thursday.  It is so fast!  I mean it's a good thing though, cause I just have to do this and NO MORE SOCIAL FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE!!!!!!!!!!!!!  That feels so good, but our teacher makes the info pretty simple to understand and it is fairly intersting.  I also feel really smart cause like this morning no one was talking so I was answering all the questions.  I didn't have time to workout today though, and probably won't for a while.  That is just a scarific I must make.  I will have time after Summer School is done and on the weekends, except Megz and I are going to Stampede and got Rodeo tickets for Stampede.  The weekend after that I have Grandstand tickets and ChuckWagons cause I love watching the races and the show.  Anyways, I got to go read over the next chapter in the Social text cause I got a quiz on the stuff tomorrow! ;)

      I went to the gym again today, not like that is anything new.  I am excited to go to summer school tomorrow.  I don't actually care that gained weight cause I look good and feel happy except for when my Mom and I argue.  Last night I just kept thing about one thing.  University.  My mom told me that she new a lady whose son had a 90% average and didn't get it.  I am so scared.  People always tell me I should have a back up plan just in case - but I don't.  I only want to do ONE thing with my life, and that is teach.  I can't imagine doing anything else, which is why I WILL become a teacher.  I mean it's like their in a inner voice telling me this is my purpose in life and the role I am to fulfil.  I am so scared about getting into University.  I don't think I could handle rejection.  I don't know what I would do, and I don't have a back-up plan.

      I still can't wait for Monday.  I am so excited to go back to Summer School.  I had so much homework already though and it took me a while this morning to finsih it.  I really like the stuff though.  It's interesting and FOR ONCE I KNOW something in social - I LEARNED something.  I went to go work out again today for like two hours.  When I stand on my toes you can literally see how muscular my legs have become.  I was 138 this morning and then in the evening I was 140.  However, right now I am not too concerended with the weight.  I mean I drank three bottles of water today and did the full circuit of weights.  I think maybe I am reducing some of the fat in my body and just building more muscle cause I really don't see a big change in the way I look.  I feel so great.  I feel so happy.  On the treadmill I just ran for half and hour stright and just thought about all the stupid bad things that occurred of have happened.  My Goodness that is such a good way to release anger.  I love going to the YMCA.  I am addicted!  Last night Ali and went for a swim after our workout too.  That felt so good.  I also made these energy granola bar things tonight.  It was in the paper like last month and was created by a dietician who won some contest thing.  It is soooo good, and really healthy.  Man I wish all food could be like that.  LoL!!

      Today was so awesome.  It was so fun much fun.  It was so different, and cool, and just really neat.  I started Summer School today.  Already I have like tons of homework and the teacher told us to expect HOURS of homework.  I am used to doing that anyway though, so it shouldn't be that big of a deal.  Bishop Grandin is a really old school though and like there aren't many windows.  That school is like ancient but I have a really good Social 30 teacher.  I actually REMEMBER EVERYTHING he taught today and understand it all.  He is very good, and the class has so much structure compared to BOB's Social program.  There are only about 16 people in the class, and like hardly anyone talks so there are like no distractions or anything.  I love Summer School, or at least the first day.  I have my first unit test next week already and we got like five million assignment today.  I drove Alicia back to my house from Summer School and then we had the left over fries and onion rings from Peters last night.  We ran a whole bunch or erins and then picked up a vanilla cone each from McDonalds - by the way their ice cream, apples, and yougurt parfait are the ONLY things I will eat there.  The rest of the stuff is nasty.  For like an hour Ali and I sat outside on my swing.  Then we went to the gym, did half an hour cardio and the entire circuit of weights, then we went for a swim in the pool and hot tub.  It was a fun night and a fun day.  Once I got home from the YMCA I was planning to do some more social homework...lol...I am interested in Social for once (that is like a first!!!) and well then I ate my dinner at like 9.  What a day!!

      I went to the gym last night and for about an hour and fourty-five minutes today.  That is like my second favourite place in the entire world!!  I love working out and I met this really nice girl at the gym today.  I weight a few pounds more then when I left school, but when I look at my body in the mirror it looks nicer then before.  I like my stomach now cause I barely have one, my arms feel better from all the weight lifting, and my legs are just nice and not really thin like half of the other teenagers on this planet that starve themselves.  My Mom's surgery was good, but now I have to do like everything.  My Dad is flying in from Vancouver for the final time and then we are going to go to Peters Drive In for dinner.  Tomorrow I start summer school.  I am excited, but nervous.

      I love Lindsey Lohan.  This is like my favourite song in the entire world right now.  It makes me happy.  It's fun.   I love it.  What can I say, the girl makes me feel good.    It Freaks Me Out  You hate the way I'm always watching videos Eleven-thirty and you just can't sleep You think whatever I've got playin on my stereo Is so pathetic that it makes you weep  And the beat goes on when I get back home And I run stright past you to the telephone And my feet don't fit in your sensible shoes But you just won't quit until you've killed my groove  Wooo it freaks me out I've got to scream I've got to shout Wooo it freaks me out like Halloween I've got no doubt  I think your weird, it's writen on your resume You and I'm stupid and your best freind too And if I smile you think I'm doin it to get my way And if I don't I've got an attitude  And the beat goes on when I get back home And I run stright past you to the telephone And my feet don't fit in your sensible shoes But you just won't quit until you've killed my groove  Woo it freaks me out I've got to scream I've got to shout Woo it freaks me out like Halloween I've got no doubt

      My legs hurt right now. I got to the gym way too much, but I can't help it cause I need to like look good. Besides working out is good for the body. My muscles just hurt a little from too much weight lifting. I went to see Spiderman 2 on Sunday - believe it or not I really liked it. And I usually hate comics and thought the first one sucked ass. I liked Kirsten Dunst though, she is one of my favorite actresses besides Lindsey Lohan and Elisa Dushku. I wish there was more time for Summer too. Summer School caused an entire month to go to waste. I could have been having fun. I guess on the positive note I am DONE SOCIAL 30. DONE DONE DONE DONE. Oh yeah........!!! And I found the best song by Lindsey Lohan - Ultimate, listen to it sometime cause it's good. Yesterday besides working out and watching Ellen, Chels and I went for dinner. We went to Jack Astors cause we are sick of all the other restaurants around here. We have been to them like a thousand times (we eat out too much) but yeah it was pretty good. Chels thought the meal wasn't big enough, but like it was pretty big. I usually don't consume that much food for dinner, but whatev. So we also got dessert cause Chels wanted some (I honestly would not have eaten chocolate if she didn't want it) I mean really, honestly I was trying to be healthy :) It's alright though, cause I toned my body and stuff and well lost some weight, so I look good. Chels and I then made new truth and dares for my Jenga and played. I had the best time cause we are way too a like. We are wild, fun, and crazy. I can't believe some people think I am shy and reserved!! Now that is seriously funny! Yeah, it was a fun night. We were so loud my mom probably thought we had been drinking, like she thought last time. I was trying to ask her something but I mixed all the words up, and like everyone I was with was laughing their ass off, even me once I realized what I said. It was funny. No wonder she thought we were drinking, but she knows I would never drink and drive. This morning I went to the gym again - yeah like that is a surprise. Then my mom and I get went to South Centre and got some Chinese fast food. It was good. I love that new place - Bourbon St. Grill. Love it!!! After trying it at Market Mall with Melissa I wanted it again, and then go figure it's in South Centre. I also went to guess and my mom bought my this belt I wanted for my b-day (Well I think my b-day is like a week from today) but she can never surprise me anyways. Now she just buys half of my gifts when I am with her. And later on I think I have to take the papers and cardboard to recycling then we're going out for Coffee with the neighbor's. That's my day!

       Ok, so I did something totally embarrassing today. My mom was like "Vanessa, take me shopping to Safeway." So we went to Safeway and I knocked some guys basket things over while he was setting up a display. I guess I misjudged how far away it was from the cart. It also made a really loud bang. And then she was like "Geez Vanessa, can't you be more careful." Like, GRRRRRRRRR I was friggin being careful. It's like it's always my fault and well I guess it was, but I really didn't mean to. She doesn't get it. I didn't try to knock all that shit off the shelf.  I had another break down today. When the stress builds up it's not a good feeling. I always have this recurring notion that I am different. I mean yes we are all individuals, but there is something just not right. I know it, and I have known it for a long time. By now I am practically certain. People are always like aww sweetie your a hard worker and everything, and seriously your just being too hard on yourself. And like seriously people don't know shit about my life or about myself. They don't see what goes on behind the scenes, they don't see out of my eyes, they don't know!!!!!!!! I wish I could scream: Can't someone PLEASE understand!!!!!!! Your know just to understand what I am going through would greatly be appreciated. I mean right now isn't as stressful as school, but nonetheless it's a stressful time. I admit I am usually pretty happy during summer, but not today. Maybe it's the the PMS kicking in for once, but I highly doubt that cause usually turn into the nicest gal you've ever met at that time. I have always considered the possibly of having a learning disability, but everyone else seems to shrug that idea off. They don't think it could be possible. They laugh at the idea. I don't get it though, I mean why??? Why do they just automatically shrug of they idea when they no nothing about what I struggle with and what I have trouble with???? Why...Why...WHY???? I KNOW for a FACT though, something is wrong, wrong, WRONG.... I do think it could be possible and am open the idea that is it may very be possible. I guess people just really don't see or understand what I deal with and go through. I suppose I hide the things I find difficult, but I mean if I don't have some kind of learning problem then what is wrong????  I wish I knew how to talk to someone about this. I mean first lets start with the reading cause that like affects my life in too many damn ways. When I read I don't understand what the hell I am reading. It makes no sense unless I read it like ten times. Even then sometimes I just don't get the connection. When we did Reading Comp in English this is like a seriously problem. There just is NOT ENOUGH TIME to read something like ten times over. When I read something once I don't even remember what I just read. I mean no wonder I never understood how to do the math word problems. I didn't understand what the hell they were asking. During the English Final I got the biggest friggin headache of my life. It's hard to concentrate when your heads hurts. When I was doing the Social 30 diploma recently I started to get this pounding in my head. The diploma was also when I realized there was something is seriously wrong. I could not focus on the words I was reading or well trying to read. I am going to sound like a major nut case but like the words were like moving. I usually don't have problems like focusing, but this was different. It seemed like the text was too dark and the words were all too close together. I know it sounds like really weird, but it indefinitely was happening and there was nothing I could do. I just tried to focus as much as possible and infer the meaning to the best of my ability. Of course by the end of the diploma I started to get a headache, but not as bad as the English final. The more I read, the more my head hurts. I am at the point where I would rather do just about anything but read.  Then there is my job situation. I feel like such a loser. Practically half of my friends that want jobs have jobs. I used to have a job too, but only because I got it through a friend of a friend. You know how the story goes. That lasted about seven months believe it or not. I just worked hard and most managers liked me because I was kind and friendly. It didn't really matter though because no manger ever had the courage to fire anyone. Anyways, getting back to my point I have applied at every place that classifies you at the bottom of the work chain. Wendys, Burger King, IGA, Co - op, Safeway twice (diff. locations) Half of the time I even dropped off my resume to the managers, which is a must these days cause half of the people just throw your application in the garbage. Do you think I got one call for any of those places. All the fuck I wanted was a job to earn money so I could pay for the stupid gas my car needs to get me places. By all means it's not my resume, it's practically perfect and my list of extra-curriculars are astounding. It's not like I have never worked before because I do have experience. How pathetic do you think it feels to not even be able to get a job at burger king or wendys. You always need people for fast food. And everytime, no call, no interview, no job. I mean I suppose it might be the fact that I am NOT going to work every damn day of the week. Sorry, I had a life and would like to maintain at least half of the good part. These days it's always like everyone wants you to dedicate 110% of your time to work and work only. Sorry, but I won't and I refuse. I wonder if I filled out the stupid application's wrong, they were all confusing. Too many boxes and confusing words, except for the Wendy's application. Maybe they just assume people applying there aren't that smart so they need a simpler method of obtaining employment.  Then there was this day when some strange guy stopped at my house and asked me how to get to MillView Bay. Ok, I mean Millrise is composed of streets that all friggin start with Mill so you tell me how the hell would I know how to get there. Then comes my mom and pulls out a map. "Here Vanessa you figure it out." Guess what, I couldn't figure it out. I didn't feel that bad though considering the guy was trying to read the map too. To both of us it made no sense. So I suppose it isn't so abnormal to not be able to read a map. It was kind of stupid though cause it took us like 15 minutes to find the street on the map. Really, that honestly tells your nothing. Ohhhh a street name with squiggly lines all around it, which too many colors...like how the hell is that suppose to tell you where to go. Ok, so there is my next secret - I wouldn't say I cannot a map (saying you can't do something is degrading) but I would simply have to classify myself and an inefficient map interpreter. That sounds better than can't read maps. I still remember when me and my friends when to greek fest, I got lost three times.  Wow, this is a long journal entry but I feel a little bit better now. I can finally unleash some of what I am feeling. I am not sure if you would call it stress or not. I've always wondered if my childhood ever had a slight affect on me and the way I am now. I ran into a wall when I was five if that says anything. I honestly didn't see it, maybe that is why I can be such a bad driver. I just don't "see" things sometimes. I have almost run over people like four times now, and once I almost did it with four other people in the car. I swear my driving is going to scar them for life, but they said they still trust me. Go figure, they must be real true friends if they have that much trust in me. Failing drivers ed was yet another bullet shot at me in my life time. That was hit me pretty hard though. I couldn't remember any of the parts of the car and the fluids colors. At the time it seemed so stupid to have to learn that stuff, but now that I drive more I realize that it is pretty important. I waited six months before driving again after the drivers ed. My self-esteem had never taken at hit as hard as that one. I had failed things before, but this was worse because half of the world talks about how fun driving is. I think it is fun now, but it took me about a year to realize that. After eight months following driving ed I got my licensee, but NO ONE knows how much effort I had to put it. I mean more effort that ANYTHING I have ever done in my life. Anyone who knows me knows my level of effort is like 500%. I put more into learning to drive. Once Feb 2004 hit, I practiced with my mom EVERY night and MORNINGS and NIGHT practiced my parking. This went on for months until the Easter weekend in April. I swear I will always remember that day. Just the feeling of: I got my license and actually did something right for once. That is a feeling you can never replace. Only I know how hard it was to get that license that occupies its glorious space in my wallet. I also had sleep apnea when I was a kid. According to my mother I would snore so loud she could hear through walls, then for a minute it would be silent. I would be like practically lifeless for a minute. I had an operation to remove my adenoids and my tonsils were taken out. After that it never happened again, but I think that could have like had a major affect on me - like killed maybe like a couple thousand brain cells or say....affected my learning.  Call me paranoid because maybe I am. Call me crazy because maybe that's the answer. I just wish I had an answer though. To a lot of things. A solution. Something that could make me understand just why sometimes things to challenge me in ways sometimes far beyond where I ever thought my limits could extend. I don't know what's wrong, I only know what I THINK is wrong. I wish I knew what was wrong me with. Maybe I am just a teenager, maybe that is the problem. The difference between me and everyone else though is that none of my other friends and people I know and keep in contact with experience anything close to what I experience. I know for a fact they don't go through as many times of struggles and frustration as I have been through. From the outside I seem like the happy, hardworking girl who at times doubts herself. On the inside I am a confused and struggling teenager.  If we are to look back in time I also thought I was pretty different from other people. I was always the kid who didn't understand, the slow one, the misbehaved girl. I was pretty badly behaved during grade two, but only because no one cared that I didn't understand anything. I would always be ignored and I suppose you could say I wanted attention. That year I drew so much on my desk in pencil, it was completely covered. I don't actually blame myself for the horrible marks I got that year or any year after. I tried to copy off of others math tests all the time. Being a cheater in school was how I passed half of my school stuff anyways. I didn't know how to count money or tell time. Thank goodness I know now, but I didn't know how until about grade 4/5. I also used to work with some strange lady one-on-one with counting and everything. That helped, but as I got older people had no respect for those whose marks shot up when they got individualized instruction. A couple years ago I also found an old report card - it was from grade 3. I started to read the comments on it and mentioned was remediation of certain math skills. To this day I still don't know half of my math shit. It's sad to say that I still don't understand how to round even though I have been repeatedly show, most graphs I can't seem to understand or interpret so most tests that involve interpreting graphs I simply just guess, and I don't know how to reduce fractions or ratios. I just guess on all of those things and hope I am right. Somehow I manage to get through math every year by hard work, practice, and help of others. And well I can tell time by now of course, but I can't just take a glance at my watch, I have to like really stare before I know the time. Memorizing my multiplication table - that didn't happen until grade five. My parents made me work on that every night and I still don't even remember half of it. Thank God for calculators though, I don't know what I would do without one.  Then came the year I lost most of the friends that I did have. I didn't have many in second grade because no one wanted to be friends with the "misbehaved dumb girl." In everyone's eyes that is what I was. Growing up was hard for me. At times I feel glad to be a teen, because being a teenager is better than being young. Anyways, I was little miss violent in grade four but some how friends with the 'popular' kids. No one like me though especially after this time I beat up a girl named Brittany. I became quite and reserved after that spending every recess alone. It's funny though cause me and Brit still keep in touch today even though she goes to a diff. high school and are amazing friends. They year after I met Chels, my best friend and partner in shopping forever. My life changed for a while. I still almost failed half of my classes, and even Chels admits to this day: "I remember you being so bad at school." That year Chels and I were probably the two most unpopular people. Grade six eventually came along - what a nightmare. The few friends that I had previously made before I was separated from that year. Before long I became the most hated person - literally. I almost killed myself that year because at times I have to admit the verbal abuse stared to get to me. That was also the year of ultimate weight gain. Not to mention the teachers I had were horrible, they had no respect for me or anyone who didn't seem to understand anything for that matter. I tried my best, but it was never good enough.  If people wonder why I doubt myself so much...well there is the reason why. Blame my grade six teachers, they stomped all over the self-esteem I did have. I didn't get very many recesses that year either, because they always kept me inside. My English work was never good enough, they would make me re-answers to novel questions during recess. I would have to do homework again that I had 'tried' the night before. It seriously was not my fault thought that I didn't understand what I was reading. I realize that now. Everytime I would spent that fifteen minutes crying wonder why everyone else got to go out. It wasn't fair. When I stayed in at recess to do the work again, my answers were usually better than the first time only because I had read the same chapter like five times by then. This led the teachers to assume I just didn't care about work and wasn't trying. That was a frustrating feeling and made me almost not want to try anymore because no one realized how hard I worked. Because of this frustration I wouldn't complete spelling assignments and when I asked about math questions the teachers explanation never made sense. I didn't finish half of my math assignments. And again the explanation was "she's not trying." How did they expect me to finish them when I didn't understand. If I understood half of the work that year, I honestly would have finished it. I honestly would have done it. It seemed like a better option to look as if I didn't care than to look stupid. Instead of being frustrated with work though, it was easier just to not do it. Shortly after my mom met with those two teachers and to this day I still have no idea what they talked about. I asked what they talked about to my mom, but there was never a response. My mom wasn't even that upset after that meeting either. I don't know why, but to this day I think she is still hiding something from me. There is something she has not told me.  After that I was sent to the resource room for math, but it was like already passed the half way point of the year. I do admit I desperately needed help with math, but those people did not need nearly as much help as me. I am not exaggerating. First of all the people already knew the ladies, I didn't. They understood the math, I didn't. They knew how to ask for help, I didn't. There were too many kids and I was actually ignored more than anything. As far as I am concerned, the other kids there honestly did not need any help at all. They all understood perfectly well. That is when I realized that no one else struggled with all this math as much as me. No one else really had any of the same difficulties I had experienced. I mean out in the world there are definitely people like me. They are out their somewhere, but they sure weren't in that school. I would NEVER cheat today, don't get me wrong but back then cheating was the only option. I had a D in math and was afraid I was going to fail all of my courses. I was scared so I cheated. I cheated on EVERY sing grade six achievement test except math. I know it would look suspicious if like all year I practically failed math and then got like an 80%. That would just be too obvious. I copied off this smart kid sitting in front of me. He doesn't know it to this day. I got away with cheating. Most people find it a bad thing, and I do admit it is very wrong but it motivated me. I never believed I could do anything from all my experiences in the previous years. And then I realized here was this girl who just got away with cheating, you know wait a minute but if I could cheat then I could do anything.  Grade seven rolled along. My life changed. This guy Joseph that was the only one who talked to me all the time in grade six stopped me from taking my life. I mean that was a horrible year. I found out he was moving away to a country overseas. I was scared at first wondering what I would do without him, but once he left I realized that he helped me get through a rough time and now all I can do is just make friends, be happy, and try my best. So that is exactly what I did. People came from different schools and most of them didn't know me. It was my chance to start over. I made honor roll every term that year. I went from the girl with a D in math to the girl on honors. I did it without cheating. I never cheated again after grade six. I realized to work hard and to fail is always better than to cheat. And when we work hard and we succeed it is an even greater reward because only you know truly how hard your worked for something you wanted to badly. I also used to have a really bad acne prob and like all over my back too. That also why ne of the reasons why no one liked me in grade six. I was "disgusting" according to most guys. I couldn't really change anything though, you can't change genetics. Both of my parents had acne, which means 100% chance of me getting it. By grade seven though, no one really cared. In fact, today I have it under better control after trying like 5 million things I finally found something that works pretty good. A lot of guys say I am hot and beautiful now and I get hit on at the gym all the time. It's pretty funny.  I worked hard in grade eight and managed to make honor roll only once. I worked hard though and everytime missed honors because of my math mark. Always the math. I guess you could say I tried new things though. I used to be reserved, quite, shy, barely talked. I had played Soccer for many years, even made div 1 before (and yes I am still pro at soccer) Anyways, I tried out for the Senior girls volleyball cause I am a sports person. I had never tried Volleyball before. Out of the girls there were over fourty girls to begin with. I made it into the top twenty but didn't make the team. So I tried for juniors and definitely got on. I wouldn't say I was nearly half as good at it though as Soccer, but it was fun, different, and at least I made friends and talked with people. I also tried out for the badminton team, I made the cut for that. Most games I lost, but really I had fun. I am way better at badminton today than I was back then. I sucked at doubles though, I realized that. I am the dominant one...likes to take control. I rock at singles badminton.  So grade nine eventually came along. Nothing really changed much except I went into another state of depression for a while. I admit I was unhappy for various reasons. Well, first of all English comprehension was a struggle like usual, but I was a good writer. There was no doubt about that so the teacher always assumed I didn't need any help because I did good on English. Social was just one big confusion but for like everyone. Our teacher always gave up tests that were like two grade levels higher and would do stupid things on M.C. tests like made eight answers in a row all A so like half of the class would fail. It was the class where my ability to write didn't pay off cause I had no idea what was going on half of the time. Math was the worst. What a nightmare. I still remember being kicked out when I said something 'apparently' rude. I wasn't trying to be rude. Half of the teachers just thought I was doing it on purpose. Anyone who knows me knows I would NOT purposely try to be inconsiderate. I quit my job that year, the only job I have ever had in the last well about four years. Eventually balancing school and work became to much. It was just too difficult. It was either fail or quit and pass. So I quit because I wanted to get into all the highest possible classes in high school. I wanted to be with all my friends. Getting the mark I needed for math pure was by far the most difficult, but I did it. I sure proved that I could do it to. I have passed math 10 and 20 with fairly good marks now - better than the marks I got in j.h. math. I always had this knack for science though. That was one my things. I studied day and night to get the marks I got in that course. I think was only like a low 80% but that is good and I work damn hard for it. Science interested me and still does today.  It was strange though because in grade nine I also ended up with Drama as one of my options and I didn't even put it as one of my choices. I hated it the entire year, I complained about it every day but I was good at it. When the head of the board for drama or whatev her title was came, the teacher told me she wanted me to do my monologue first cause she needed to make a good impression on this lady. I never felt so good after that. Everyone - even people who never talked to me, they came up and told me that they were scared to go up now because mine was so good. I know mine was good. I realized I had a talent. Drama, acting, performing, whatever you want to call it. At the end of the year the school gave out medals to those who got the highest mark in all the classes except like comp and things like that. Then they called out: Top Drama........Vanessa Boila. I knew it too, in my mind I just knew it would be my name. I had a 98. To beat me you practically had to be perfect. I had hated Drama so much that year, and initially what most people don't know if that when I chose my courses for high school Drama is not what I initially chose. When I got my schedule mailed to me for grade ten I looked at it and was like: This isn't right. So I went to the counselors and switched fashions to five credit Drama. That was fate right there working in the hands of time. I could have not been more happy. I met Megz, we are awesome together, partners on stage. We both played fairies in A Mid Summer Night's Dream and we do tons of stuff together now. I know for a fact after high school we are going to stay in touch. There is no doubt in my mind.  Grade ten I would probably have to rate as the best year of my life. Sometimes I wish I could just go back in time and relive that year. I mean for the most part it was good and less stressful than many other times in my life. It was kind of embarrassing though when I was asked "who's your T.a." and well I didn't remember. At least I had a good excuse though. I mean we had gone through three other people before my permanent T.A. came so no wonder I didn't remember who anyone was anymore. High School was a big change for J.H. I realized that there were teachers that cared, ones that did hate me cause I wasn't 'perfect' or just didn't understand. They didn't, blame or critisize, they just accepted whatever came their way. That kind of difference goes a long way. No teacher had ever asked me about anything I was ever interested in before like Mrs. J. No one ever cared the way she cares. In High School there are teachers like Ms. L who even though they appear scary they encourage you, push you, and actually BELIEVE you can succeed. That is the biggest difference. Teachers in j.h. would just assume that I wasn't capable, but then high school came and here were a whole bunch of people who just supported me, accepted me for who I was, and believed that I could succeed.  That doesn't change the fact that I struggle with math and some other things. It doesn't change the fact that I failed half of the things in Chem. Really it's not that big of a deal. I learned a lot in that class. Directions for labs confused me a lot. A lot of times I just sat there watched everyone else cause I was confused. I wanted to understand though and I tried to participate as much as possible. Math was difficult, but a lot more difficult in grade eleven. Especially because the teacher more like ignored me pleas of "I don't understand." Everyone is like: Oh just practice and stuff. I did so bad on most of the tests except the one where she actually sat down and went through the stuff with me. Once I even told her specifically that I didn't understand and need help, and the teachers reply was: "Oh do you have ____ day free, ___ time free" but like I just simply was not available those times. Then she just said: "Well I can't help you then" and I was completely left in the dark for that unit. The schedule worked way better the first year. At least there was time to eat lunch.  In grade twelve I need to focus on getting into university and keeping up that marks. Ever since grade seven I have known I want to be a teacher and since grade ten I have known I want to do something in the science area. I don't care how difficult it is cause I am going to do. I have gotten this far now there is no turning back. I just got to keep trying my best. Trying and working my ass off is all I can do. I want to major in Bio and do a minor in Chem. Yup, that's what I am going to do. Diploma's are a stupid part of grade twelve that I don't want to have to deal with, but that is just a fact of life. Before I know it they will be over and I will old...ahhhhhh. I want to meet someone who is not into himself and an asshole. Can't someone half decent come along...???????? I miss Aaron from Halifax but chances are I won't see him again. I don't know if I should feel this way or not, but I think that I am attracted to Brent. I don't know why. A lot of people would be like: "Why him?" you know and well he is easy to talk to. Once I got to know him better I found he was pretty nice and is fun. He always says I am smart too, while most guys claim that I should have been born a blonde. Most guys like me for my looks only and that is annoying. I have always wanted to marry like a crazy hot science guy though or a teacher, or someone totally into sports. My requirements are:   Must like to go the gym often  Likes sports and puts priority of having fun first  I get to shop and cook, the guy cleans  Must want two children  Go to Catholic church on a regular basis or does not go but is eagerly willing to go  Must be a part in the kids lives, I don't want to do it alone  Must have a successful career or head in the direction towards one  Likes to eat healthy, no junk in my house - No pop! No chocolate!  Does NOT speak another language, I hate that  Does NOT have an accent cause half of the time I don't know what those poeple are saying  Likes to go out a lot and get away from the house  Likes cats  Funny and good personality  No really long hair...yuck! (Must be well groomed!)   Ok yeah that like has to be the longest post in the history or my journal writing. I think I am done now. My head hurts from thinking so much.

      My mom and I picked up my sister today and went to Doreen's condo in Canmore for breakfast, then went to Banff later on.  We shoped for a while, then went to lunch, and got lots of ice creak and chocolate from my favorite candy store where you can look the the window and watch them make the chocolate.  We went back to canmore for about an hour after that, and then dropped off Melissa, and went home.  That was basically my day today.  And well I need to go watch the news now - love the news.  And well I have no idea what I am doing tomorrow.  A couple more weeks to my birthday...maybe two or something like that.  I am looking forward to generous gift of money which I most desperatly need.  Since you know I like killed my debit card when I went shopping with chels I am like going to have no money for gas.

      Finished! Done!! No more Social for the rest of my life!!!!! No more Summer School. It feels so good. The diploma I wrote today for Social 30 wasn't even scary. For once in my life I didn't panic or get nervous. I was clam. I don't know how I did it. It was a lot easier when your not freaked out and panicked. There was also LESS people in the comp room writing the essay, and less people in the gym. It made me feel not so cramped and more confortable. I didn't feel pressured or anything. I guess because it's summer I just relaxed and took it easy. My essay was the best thing ever. If anyone marks me bad on that thing I am going to have to kill someone. I know for a fact that it was good writing. Damn good writing. The multiple choice was a little difficult for me, but that is always to be expected with those tests. I find them a lot more difficult than the writing part. Anyways I am sure I did fine. Everything always works out. Just one way or another I always find a way. It was kind of strange during the multiple choice though. I wasn't sure if it was the lighting in the gym or my eyes or something. You know those questions that involve reading an except or quote, well when I was reading those it was hard to focus. The words would like "mix" togehter and it was hard to read it and understand it cause I couldn't make out what I was reading. It was like a blur of dark spots and I like blink excessively, which can be extremely annoying for like half a page of reading. If I just tried really hard to hold my eyes open without blinking, it was better. Except, it was hard to dom or something, cause it totally sucked. But whatever, it's over now and done with. It was probably just the lighting in the gym. Other than that I don't really know how to explain it.  I haven't had a lot of time to do one of my favorite things - write poetry. I don't really care if a lot of people don't like it, cause I do. I like it, and that is just me. Here's my most recent poem I wrote, I don't know if this one is half as good as any other ones I have written, but I guess I will still put it in my diary:     Tower Twelve    Alone at night I am left to fear Darkness of this night so queer For when I reach the watch of doom two arrows then unite as one  These hands they strike in the name of vein Forgotten solidarity is but yet contained For on this night I am to discover what remains This darkness has left me on the verge of insane  Cannot uncover a way to depart from this tower I am caught up in this daunting midnight hour Chasing stairs far beyond my reach Stumbling upon an appalling fatality in which my eyes do reveal  Before me lies a rusty board covered in such scarlet stains Flooded across the broken plank my eyes do not deceive And through the air such an awkward silence lingers Misplaced is this sense once so common to me, what shall I do next?  My breath becomes grave and my figure turns stiff As I look the rusted window I can hear such a riff The hands belt twelve and the sound hammers hard I remain in the tower of doom as two arrows become one  ~Vanessa

      It's funny you know. I am the girl who is always so worried and concerened. This time is different. This time I really mean it. I keep avoiding studying for the diploma. That is not like me. As you can tell, I am avoiding it right now by going on the comp, today I went out for breakfast, then shopping with Chelsey, then out to eat, and for a walk. The list goes on. I mean I know how much doing good on this means to me, but I guess studying has not paid off in Summer School. Everytime I studied for a test I either failed or almost failed. If that is what I got on those then I mean, really why bother studying. I am not saying I didn't study at all. I just didn't study as much as usual. I remember most of the material and I KNOW that I am an amazing writer and from MANY people have been told I am very talented in writing. I KNOW that. I need to prove it tomorrow. The Summer School Social teacher loved my essays except one. The essay I know is my thing. MC is a little scary, but I mean you practically can't study for that shit anyways. All you do is read things and interpret - comprehending material...AHHHH. It will be ok though, everything always works out. Besides if I want to be a Bio major they aren't going to care if I am not a hard core history nerd (Well except Model UN cause that is just fun) and well I know it means a lot to me to get into university, but I have learned something greater. I CAN accept things the way they are now. I CAN deal with failure. After all I failed a lot of things in Social 30. No, I am not saying I am going to fail the diploma. I am simply just going to try my best like always. That is all I can do. The rest is up to the other half of the world ----> My fait lies in the good ole' scantron machine and markers in Edmonton (Which are damn well going to give me at least 80% on my essay, I am going to make it so good that we will feel I deserve nothing less. After tomorrow I can stop worrying about stupid Social 30 and Summer School. My Summer can OFFICIAL begin. I can have more fun and not worry for a while. I like that idea!

      Yesterday was so amazingly fun, but so amazing weird. I went to Bragg Creek for the first part of the day - ate a really awesome lunch and have some chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream. That was so good, and like that is the like 2nd week of eating ice cream every single day. I haven't gained a pound. I have been like hungry all the time. I practically eat like six meals a day. That is pretty sick when you think about that. Six meals a day!! When I got back I felt really stuffed from that ice cream I ate so I went to the gym. I had not been in a while so I thought it was best to go. I am in pretty good shape still, but usually I can run 30 mins straight on the treadmill no prob, but I was kind of hurting yesterday and couldn't do as much. That was only cause I haven't been keeping up with it more often than usual.  So then I like ate again when I got home from working out. I went to Wendy's to pick up Chels from work, then stopped at her house, and went to....THE PARK!! Yeah ok, it was only to talk. We just talked about what we wanted to do the rest of the night. I was like "lets go buy a game we don't have or something." So believe it or not everyone took to my idea. So I drove to Walmart and we checked out the prices, but it was all too expensive. We wanted hungry, hungry hippos but it was over $20. So then we went to walmart and checked out the prices there. Hungry, hungry hippos was more expensive, but then we found some like no name brand game. 'The Frog Game' or well Hungry Hungry Frogs!! Before we played though we were all starving by 8:00 PM so we went to Moxies for like the second week in a row. We all ordered chicken fingers and fries cause Mike was working and he is responsible for cooking deep fried crap like that. Anyway you know how they like never give you enough of the sauce stuff I asked the lady "Do you think I can have extra plum sauce with my meal" and of course she says "No Problem." A couple minutes later our meal shows up and guess what she brings. She brought a plate of FOUR extra plum sauce, but Andy and Chels didn't want theirs so they gave me theirs to eat too. If anyone knows me, I HATE wasting food and would rather eat it then leave it knowing that there our people in this world who don't have as much as we do. Anyways:   RULE 1: Don't ask for extra plum sauce RULE 2: If you are a retard and do ask for extra, be SPECIFIC RULE 3: If they bring you too much plum sauce, don't eat it ALL    So anyways I slowly worked my way through eat little container thing. One by one. So much friggin plum sauce. Too much. Where was my Dad when I needed him. I mean I sure could have used some help eating that. I am guessing I probably ate like half of the bottle. By the end of my meal I had ate four of those container things of plum sauce and one container thing of ketchup. I thought Chels was going to get sick just watching. I had a stomach ache after that. When I was driving everyone back to my place, we put on that song by Ace of Base - Cruel Summer. We sang along with it but in the words: It's a cruel, cruel, cruel summer, we sang to: It's a cruel, cruel, cruel Dinner! That was so hilarious. When we got to my place my mom thought we were all drunk. She was like "What did you drink tonight?" We went to my room and played hungry, hungry frogs for like hours. That was SOOOOOOOO much fun. I mean I have NEVER had that much fun playing any game before. It's like my new favorite - Hungry, Hungry Frogs. Best game ever I swear!! I encourage all of you to go out to Zellers and buy it! It's half the price of hungry hippos and twice the fun!
