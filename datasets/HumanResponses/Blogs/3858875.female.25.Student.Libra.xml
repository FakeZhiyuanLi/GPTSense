      i am soooooo out of control! and see the wildest things in life. I like to have my hair match my pink flipflops.  i am so impressed with lizzie's assessment, i'm running to buy her new book: decorating with Lizzie McGuire.   maybe i will. i have to decorate a new place in austin, and i kind of like the girly crafty ideas - much more fun than the staid martha stewart type stuff. and it's nice being told 'being a girl rocks' on every 2nd page. maybe i'll get chris a copy too for his new place!

      with luck on my side, i will be handing in my thesis this Friday. Wow! My supervisors think i'm almost there.  this long weekend will be one last weekend of overachievement (which is why, of course, i spent the a.m. in bed). i'm to have a new revised draft in by tuesday. I also have to get my images sorted and get permissions from the artists to use any of their quotes and images.  our department has moved to a pass/fail system as well, which takes a lot of pressure off - b/c i'm the type to fret about whether i score an 86 or 88, or whatever.

      As much as there are things about Kerry and Edwards' politics of optimism that I like, I don't think that it's v feasible in British Columbia right now.   There's a very important event this Wednesday evening at the Vancouver Public Library (see below). The 2010 Olympics don't promise much good for First Nations in our province, beyond commissioning a bunch of totem poles.  Sure, there will be the usual Che Guevera t-shirt wearing types in attendence (i hope they have good air circulation!), but i'm optimistic that if a lot of people come out to these events that good things can happen.

      today and tomorrow are the worst days of work... the days i need to tell great people that we can't offer them jobs. it's awful.    everytime i get turned down for funding and get one of those letters that says there were too many good candidates, etc etc., i never believe it. but i really mean it now that i'm saying it! and i can tell that when i say it to some people, they don't believe me.   i heard that someone else in my organization has a blog where they diss (by name!) people at work! i don't know why i'm so surprised.. i'm sure it happens all over the place but it just seems like such a stupid thing to do.

      i've stolen this post from my friend will's site. it's about two lovebirds who were separated, but the male flew back to his lady.   read the story:  urlLink lovebirds   i think that when i see chris tonight, i'll just be cooing: birds... together... fly... love... mmm... , i'll reach in for a cuddle, only to be met with a burp.

      my favourite food site,  urlLink epicurious , has a wonderful little feature called 'search spy.' if you click on the search spy, you can check out some of the different food items that other site users are looking up. they range from the banal (pasta) to the comic (lobster, not salad - which inevitably brought up a lobster salad), and often is useful for generating ideas of what to make.   i was on the search spy whilst chris was editing my thesis chapter, and someone had looked up "refried cat." not once, but twice. Because even if a recipe for refried cat doesn't come up, it's just that the search engine didn't find it.

      about two years ago, i left the hairdresser i had been going to for about 8 years. my hair is pretty difficult to deal with (v v fine), and i am too - i usually just ask hairdressers to do what they like, since i trust their judgment and don't want to admit that i want them to make me look like julia stiles.   (speaking of julia stiles, in an interview for tour guides i conducted today, a job candidate, when asked what celebrity he would like to be his guide, lucidly described why julia stiles would be the greatest guide. because she's not only beautiful and famous, she lives in residence at columbia university. so she's real, too. it was fantastic)   after i left my hairdresser (a move that it took me months to make), i saw another hairdresser a few times, but we just had no chemistry at all. so i changed salons. i've now gone through three stylists at this one salon, because they all keep quitting. maybe i should have never left michelle. i seem to have picked up some serious bad karma that i just can't shake.

      chris and i made it back safe and sound tonight. we had a great vacation in salem with will, jeani, and lacey. thanks again, braggs, for your wonderful hospitality!   lacey is the cutest, funniest, and definitely the most curious dog. a few timely whimpers and taps on the bedroom door are definitely the highlights of our trip!   it was incredibly hot - 40 degrees C on two days - so we didn't get out as much as we had initially planned. though we spent most of our time indoors, i think i may have gotten a *little* bit of colour.

      grrr. ut wants me down in austin by the 18th of august - a full week earlier than i expected. the painfully short notice is only bettered by the fact that i haven't received an iota of info regarding visa, $$... i know what kind of information i should be receiving because i do precisely this kind of work at my school. alanis could sing about this!   the stress of this move is getting to be too much. i'm so frustrated that my new department has been so lame with getting me the information that i need. maybe i'm just too upset right now to be logical, but the hoops i have to jump through are really making me rethink my decision to go down. the whole process has just had so many barriers and so much sadness associated with it (what with my funding being revoked only to be later reinstated), and i'm starting to wonder if this is a sign from the universe (or whatever) that i should just finish my master's and get a job in vancouver. then, there would be no visa, no uncertainty with leaving my current job, no long-distance relationship, and no 4-5 years without a reasonable income. i could work and be with my loved ones. i've never had a problem getting a job before. before i decided to go down, i even had a plan in place and a career goal.   am i being realistic, or throwing in the towel? i'm scared that because i'm not getting any downtime before leaving that i'll be so frazzled upon my arrival.

      having a great holiday so far, and finally getting a little time to chill at will's home. chris is enjoying the divan, and i seem to have taken ben's spot as lacey's houseguest of choice. but without the moral turpitude.  yesterday afternoon, we went to the sox-mariners game, which was awesome. the sox had an 8 run 4th inning, and managed to hold on until to the end. there were quit a lot of sox fans at the game. the park (safeco field) is really beautiful, and have this 40s/50s retro thing going on with their interior design/graphics. the stadium didn't seem to have as much atmosphere as nat bailey, where our single a vancouver canadians play. maybe cos it was a tuesday nooner.   today we checked out 4 willamette valley vineyards - witness tree, bethal valley, and two i already forget! i've also been in touch with some people in austin, who have been super helpful with letting me know what neighbourhoods to live in, etc. i think i may already have a place (!) plus steph at the office has been great with keeping me abreast of everything exciting that's going on ;)

      Took some time to celebrate  Just one day out of life  It would be, it would be so nice   Holiday starts tomorrow - it's officially today, well, officially started on Friday, but chris and i have been tying up loose ends with our theses and such. i think we're through with that - just need to pack up and wait for will to come and whisk us down to salem. (snaps to will!) whoo-hoo! the itinerary includes the seattle/red sox game (still don't know what 'ERA' means), downtime with will and jeani, visits to wineries and hopefully beach and kayaking time too. i hope to spend some time in portland - i haven't been in years but remember it as the most wonderful city.     <>already, chris and i took in  urlLink bard on the beach 's performance of much ado about nothing. it was pretty good, and kerry sandomirsky as beatrice really stood out. one of the cast members, josh epstein, went to my high school - he was a year below me. it's great to see people from Magee doing so well for themselves.

      i was thinking about starting this post off by describing how my culinary tastes are oh-so-refined.     but i thought that doing so would only come off as a shameless attempt to get foodie cred. that would be sad.     tonight's one of those crazy nights where my dinner has consisted of multiple trips to the kitchen to make tea, eat granola bars and processed cheese (not together).     I have developed a new love for processed cheese singles over the last little while. yes, the girl who not long ago refused to eat leftovers now eats like a 19 year old bachelor. i had forgotten about cheese singles for so long.  i love their tang that is unlike any known flavour in the natural world.  but most of all, i love their smooth texture and their give.     a slow bite into processed cheese folded in 3s. mmmm....

      It's only been two weeks since the federal election, and we've already had our first double-dip! And this one's from the Conservatives!  &nbsp; Nina and Gurmant Grewal are married Conservative MPs from Surrey BC, one of the 'angry taxpayer' capitals of Canada. MPs get $20K a year for their living expenses in Ottawa, and Nina wants to cash in on both of their allowances, for $40K per year.  &nbsp; Cos they're independent MPs and independent thinkers!  &nbsp; Gurmant, however, disagrees with the plan. Not surprisingly, because he campaigned on fiscal conservatism.  &nbsp; Don't get me wrong - I'm not an outraged 'taxpayer.'&nbsp;I'm pretty proud that I've managed to bend, twist, and pokes in a lot of rules here at UBC - and hate to see someone manipulate the 'system' in such obvious ways. I am also disgusted because I'm certain that at least some of the Grewal's constituants (in working-to-middle class Surrey) have been&nbsp;adversely affected by cuts to social housing and services.  &nbsp; Pity the liberals split the left wing vote in BC!

      most readers who know me have heard me talk about my ongoing contract dispute... in a 4 month job, i've been in a dispute for 2.5 months. it's been pretty ridiculous, and very stressful.   tomorrow's another milestone in the dispute - student council votes on whether i get my negotiated salary increase. if they vote yes, i get the increase. they vote on my salary because i was appointed by council to my position. anything important to do with my job or department needs to be voted on. (no, i wasn't told this before taking the job.)  i found out today that there's another potential hurdle, which may or may not materialize. I asked the ombudsperson in our organization to mediate the dispute resolution. i was under the impression that the ombudsperson would bring the motion (for my pay raise) to council - now i found out that she doesn't. the very committee who initially set my pay (and subsequntly refused to increase it) has to. They can choose not to. if they don't, the salary increase can only be brought to council at the next meeting... in late august - a week before my term ends.   you would think that they would just put the motion onto the table. but. at a previous meeting, when the council first voted on my and my colleagues' salaries, the ombudsperson asked the committee to strike out the passages about my position because it was under investigation. not only did they refuse to do so, but when she tabled that idea as a motion, the council also turned it down. i'm feeling particularly suspicious because the head of the committee took a very long time (3 weeks at least) to submit her materials to the ombudsperson during the investigation. (it's pretty embarrassing. funny enough, a lot of people in the organization complain about the university administration, but i find the u.a. people *so* much easier to work with)  everytime the situation comes up - which is roughly once every two weeks - i get very upset. i feel tight, anxious, and unable to concentrate on my thesis work. this whole thing has been so emotionally taxing. i don't have any other funding right now, though. part of me thinks - my current salary is only minimum wage, and my proposed salary is only $10/hour. surely i can live without that, and all of this stress. the other part of me isn't so sure.   does anyone have any advice?

      i think i've managed to whip my thesis introduction into good shape - it's taken some time, but I think it now makes a much more compelling read. i'm giving it to my supervisor tomorrow, and she'll fill me in on whether I'm on the right track. tonight, i pray that i don't know have to add any more stuff about my disciplinary grounding and commitments. i'll settle for 'not too much more' i've still got two body chapters to work through by Friday. Both were in a much more finished state than the introduction, however, so hopefully it won't be too difficult. with my new 10 pt font (yay!), i don't need to do too much ruthless cutting.   i tried out different writing strategies for drafting each chapter. with the first chapter (on material i'm less familiar with), i wrote almost as though i was writing in my journal. I wrote up on two or three pages on topics that i felt were relevant to the analysis, and connected them to form the essay. i also wrote nearly everything in third person: 'alice feels that _ author raises a critical point...' and then edited it into more formal voice. this strategy felt nice because it allowed me the mental space to work an idea through in a short space. i think this kind of strategy, where you are really doing the work for yourself and inserting yourself into the text, is also recommended for people who experience performance anxiety.    with the second chapter, on the material about which i'm most passionate, i did the every-college-writing-class-demands-it outline. chris lives by his outlines (and his lists) and they work for him.  it is very regulated for me and feels somewhat inorganic. i even set myself page length targets for each section (which of course i blew out of the water). i did this because the first chapter took ages to write, and my first draft deadline was looming. since i knew the material very well, the writing was fairly easy until the last section - which happens to be the few pages i've been wanting to write about since i began the MA program. my excitement about the material had too much presence on the page, and it took some serious work to find some form for that section.   i also tried to force myself to write shitty first drafts to get the words on paper, and then give them a substantial edit. i think this is a good idea, but it is discouraging to see crap from your own hand and i don't think i should so freely give the s.f.d's to my supervisory committee in future...   although i've been trying to break away from staid academic form for the last couple of years, i think i should learn to love something of it again.  i think i need to work on using form and structure to help me think through ideas - rather than spend ages writing them out longhand. in fact, the work i put into structuring my study within my proposal helped immensely in both researching and writing; i'm glad the overall structure of the thesis was never in question, which saved me from wasted hours on fruitless research and anxieties about the text's final form.

      as a child (and still now), i was either attracted or averse to things based on their packaging. i'm still particularly susceptible, more than most, to great design, beautiful graphics, and nice materials. for instance, i have troubles picking up (and taking seriously) some late 80s academic texts that have neon colours and eras and mistral fonts filling in for cover art. it embarrasses me. even at age 8, i was embarrassed for the kids at school (this is circa 1986) who wore ugly soccer shorts with thin white poly/cotton blend tshirts. ick. thus i never played soccer.   my greatest aversion was (still is) to science, though. (even though i was an avid Owl magazine reader.) and i wonder how much more interested i would have been if science was promoted through photos like  urlLink these   rather than through the rampant use of cheesy LED style fonts in all of my "science probe" textbooks.     for sure, my sister's thing with star trek (so often mocked on my friend  urlLink will 's blog) didn't help.

      yesterday, my mom held a party for my nephew brendan. he was born 2 months ago, so i'm not quite sure whether this is a shower. about 20 people came out to see him, which was great. as my mom would say, 'well, this turned out nice, didn't it?'. Okay, she actually said that, roughly 6 times. my extended family is hardly tight-knit, so it was good to see people i don't get to see very often.   my sister (brendan's mom) had everyone write brendan these 'letters to the future,' to be opened on his 25th birthday. the kits are sold at most hallmark shops and the like. I just turned 25 last october, and i don't know what i would have thought if i got a batch of messages from the late 70s (when i was born) - wow, a piece of my family heritage! this is kinda lame. or check out these old 70s typefaces. graphic design has sure moved forward since then.  or who was this person? to be followed by a long tedious explanation of how they fell out with my family in the early 80s. or how many of them would just say 'have a nice life'?  the best response to my sister's urgings came from my grandma, who when asked if she would like to write Brendan a letter responded 'why? he can't read yet.'  she wrote him something anyway.  i left wondering for whom are these letters being written? we're assuming brendan will care, but for the moment, he's just drooling. maybe he can point to them as proof that his family loved him and he's not adopted? but it'll be a little late for that - those taunts usually end about age 12 or 13. the whole time capsule phenomenon seems to date back to cold war united states, or at least that's when i think it was popularized. in my mind, i associate it with backyard emergency shelters stocked with tinned food. the time capsule provides the security that everything will be alright. perhaps when brendan hits 25, his ties to mom and dad will start to wane, and the presentation of this time capsule will be intended to pull him closer to his family.      i dont' want to think about it too much - i haven't got the time.   yesterday i realized i shouldn't be a mother - brendan sneezed whilst i was holding him and instead of saying gesundheit i said 'ew'.

      last weekend, chris, thibaut and i attended a  urlLink vancouver canadians  game. it was great. the canadians have lots of sponsors including Campbell's, who sponsor their chili dog eating contest. This happens every game, and the winner takes home a canadians hat plus two tins of campbell's chunky soup.   this contest featured two teenage boys - the contests tend to pit friend against friend - one was fairly average, and his friend was, well, a pudgy and attention-grabbing. Having stuffed the entire dog in his mouth in the first 'bite,' he was declared the winner. But upon leaving the field, he spat out the dog, and got a huge boo from the crowd. he kept the machismo going.   a few minutes later, his prize was awarded to his friend, to the crowd's roaring approval (loudest cheer of the night!) i have never seen a person deflate like this pudgy kid did.  hopefully gordon c's similarly deflating - i read yesterday that one poll puts the provincial ndp up over the liberals 44 to 33%!   pudgy kid got a prize after he calmed down (and argued with the prize people for at least 10 minutes).   boy do i wish i had this documented on film!

      now anyone can leave comments, courtesy of 'haloscan', which i've integrated into my blog.  it is a little clunky. when you click on the comment bit, the post will open in a new page as usual. the blogger box says '0' or however many comments, but on top of that are two links that read 'comments' and 'trackback'. If you click on that 'comments' link, you can say whatever you please without being anon or a blogger member. i apologize in advance for the little ads there - it's a free service.   thanks, will, for alerting me to the comments issue.   in the meantime, my linking abilities have disappeared. i hope it's not a result of hooking up to haloscan.

      If you are a (ubc) student in Term 2 of the summer session and you had to buy a 2 or 3 zone pass because UBC doesn't yet have a summer U-Pass, you can get a  urlLink subsidy . This includes grad students who are registered (but not necessarily in courses) during the summer. The subsidies are first come first serve, so get yer butt (with all the proof you'll need) to the AMS admin office soon!   Wow! something pro-student at UBC! I only hope there are enough funds for everyone to get their subsidies.

      yesterday, i got a lot of... constructive criticism on my thesis and afterwards, i felt a bit low. sure, all criticism can be helpful, etc etc, but it's nice to get a few tick marks, and i like to get things right the first time. i'm also trying to become more comfortable submitting work that's still in progress. getting panned doesn't help.    today, my supervisor got a chance to read a chapter that i had neglected to submit to her last week, and she liked it quite a lot. i feel partly vindicated and much much better. of course, thesis writing will be filled with highs and lows, and i think i need to work on managing the disappointments better and becoming more resilient to criticism. i'm currently in the editing and cutting stage, which is probably the least fun of all. I know that the process will really enhance my writing skills, which helps.   cos i feel so much better that i'm on the right track, i think i'll take the night off. (though of course the smart thing would be to work *more*, right?) chris, thibaut and i are going to the cinema.

      outlaw liss is just the most recent, and my favourite, of  urlLink chris ' nicknames for me, coming on the heels of 'boss liss' and 'lissalini'. Last week we were out cycling, and I got ticketed for not wearing a helmet. i'd been wantonly breaking this law for quite a while. to be honest, i resisted getting a helmet for over a year because whenever chris wears his helmet, he ends up with triceratops hair. but now that i've been fined, i thought i needed to take action.   i got a helmet. it sounds so minor, but i never thought i'd do it. given the popularity of the new cruiser bikes, I wish that cycling companies would come out with equally well designed accessories. i did find a helmet that matches my cruiser, and the girl at the shop assured me that i won't have the same hair probs as chris. i've tried it once now, and i think she's right. yay! although i'll no longer feel the wind through my hair, i think i'll feel more secure tearing through the streets and less sheepish when i fly by cops. i hope i get to keep the name though - it's quite endearing.   UPDATE: Last night we went on a half hour bikeride, and after a quick brushing, my hair fared just fine.

      life right now feels like it's all constants: food, sleep, work, thesis... but one of the best constants is running into my friend phil all the time. i work on campus, and he lives here (and *never* leaves). he's out and about all the time, so i run into him a lot. i just ran into phil this a.m., and was so excited to tell him about my new blog! i'm one of those types who needs assurance i'll be perfect at something to give it a go, or assurance that i can enjoy something without being great at it, and phil's one of those tech wizards who make it all seem so accessible to the masses. it was after running into him yesterday, when he was talking about developing a blog, that i felt courageous enough to start my own. i just told him about this page this a.m., and hope i get this page up in time for him to see it!

      since 1998, i knew there was this book coming out, "the storage box of tradition" by Ira Jacknis, which dealt with the relationship between anthropology, museums, and Kwakwaka'wakw art. i was pretty interested in that at the time. every few months I'd check to see if it was published, and it seemed to get caught somewhere in the publishing wheel. Once it finally came out (in 2002), it was prohibitively expensive. then, the copy in our university library system spent months in 'route' - basically getting its barcode stuck on. it always shocks me how slow academic publishing can be. of course, i'm not shocked by how long things at ubc can take. but that's a different (and *really* boring) story.   today i finally got my hands on this book (i'd forgotten about it for a while) and low and behold, it's got an entire chapter section devoted to some of the native-style artists I'm working on for my MA. I had no idea! As Jacknis' historical research is much more meticulous than my own, it'll help me fill in a lot of empirical gaps. i really look forward to reading more of this work - it seems very well written and impeccibly (sp?) researched. it's such a treat to find such a useful text!

      coming off of a particularly critical thesis meeting today and realizing that i'll be spending many more of my summer evenings writing and editing and all that, i thought i might start a blog to record the process, and anything else that captures my attention. i've also had some fun lately at work writing up a little e-journal that we send out to all of the first year students at my university, so i want to keep up that kind of casual and irreverent (sp?) writing. i'm having some difficulties - just now, while writing this - coming to terms with how posting here shatters the private/public dualism that is so entrenched in our (western) culture. anyway.  i'm a bit of a internet neophyte, so there won't be anything too groovy happening here for a while. sorry. since i'll be so caught up with anthropology for the next little while, you might find me musing on the topics that interest me the most: northwest coast art, materiality, writing, emotion. hopefully none of it will be *too* esoteric. i'll also probably write about other things i love, like cooking and other things food and drink related.   i guess i hope that this new blog will help me communicate with all the people with whom i spend too little time right now and, referring back to the private/public thing in the first paragraph, i think that writing here will help me think through lots of issues about the boundaries between private, public, and cyber spaces. i'm especially looking forward to seeing how the virtual alice develops through my posts; i love how this whole medium carries such potential to be anon, but ever so exposed.

      Last night, I was to meet some of my friends, who i have not seen nearly enough of this summer, at zizanie, a wonderful hole-in-the-wall french canadian bistro on the west side. but when i showed at 9:30, they weren't there! i think they had already moved on somewhere. Serves me right - i didn't actually respond to anybody's emails, just tucking the info in the back of my mind. I'm sad, however, that I've missed Eleanor's last evening in town before going back to Colorado on holiday. Hope you have a great one, Eleanor, and I'll see you in November!   The Zizanie people took great care of very lost-looking me. Their regular musician, a kind of one man cover band/entertainer hauled me in from outside, sat me at the table onstage, and got me some drinks. It was great just sitting back listening to the music and chatting with him and his friends during the set breaks. Thanks, Sylvain, you're the best!!!

      yesterday, I resigned from my job. Monday will be my last day. I agonized over this decision for weeks - and the worst part was, I started to really like my job near the end. We're just putting on our program now, and I do take a personal interest in it. Plus, we hired ten fantastic people to run the program.   Nevertheless, it feels like the weight of the world is off of my shoulders, and I can start to deal with more important things (like getting my papers to get into the US!)   The resignation meeting was incredibly impersonal. Because my term was coming up at the end of august anyway, I guess there was no real surprise that I was heading out. But i didn't get an exit interview or anything that I expected... not even a 'we're sorry you're going,' 'thanks for your work here' or 'good luck in Texas'. Wankers.

      a few days ago, i posted about the event at the vancouver public library in support of the Sun Peaks protests.   the  urlLink necessary voices society  has posted the talks by naomi klein, irene billy and art manuel.    they have also posted mp3s of noam chomsky and norman finkelstein's talks in vancouver over the last year or so.

      Last night at E's housewarming party, things were getting a little out of hand, so we cooled them down with a little internet stalking. It all started when D and C were talking about who in Sault Ste Marie, their hometown, they'd like to laugh at now.   if you were wondering, 4 of 6 of us were in some form of high school musical ensemble.   so Hi Lewis was the star quarterback at e's high school (in denver) and was, as marcia brady would put it, 'the big man on campus.' he was also apparently in freshman french in his senior year. E was stoked when, one day, they served detention together.   Hi went on full football scholarship to Vanderbilt, and she had no idea what happened to him. minor league football anywhere? enter google.   Poor Hi got his first outing with Vanderbilt in his junior year, and that only lasted 6 passes. in fact, his coaching staff had had Hi as their first string quarterback, but were interested in also trying a few freshman. guess they got the good role.   We couldn't find any references to Hi on college football websites or on any crazed vanderbilt football unofficial fan page - the kind that tracks every player who's gone through the system.   i'm sure that, after a single click, this post will become on of the top hits. (and i better be careful i don't become one of his!)   i'm not convinced that E doesn't still hold a small flame for Hi, and so I welcome any updates (real or fictional) on his whereabouts and doings. And also those of any obscure but decent enough to be recruited for college athletes.   the next denverian to look up: Johnny Stang.

      the simple phrase "am i blocking your view?" at the fireworks. or perhaps more wonderful: someone shouting "would you sit down already?"  the crowd was great at the fireworks tonight. almost everyone (except this one couple in white) was very considerate of everyone else around them, and we could all enjoy the show. a sharp contrast from wednesday, when one jerk insisted on standing in the middle of the crowd, so the people around him did, etc etc until we were all jockeying for positions.   tonight was the celebration of light 'grand finale' where each of the countries got 10 minutes to get their fire on.   china has been the fan favorite, according to the  urlLink ratings  on the col website, and i really like how graceful their presentation is. they had this wonderful sequence of big green fireworks that just pulsed to the music. nevertheless, i prefered Sweden (the favorite of most people i have spoken with), whose show is simply exuberant. Spain started and ended well, but their middle was a little dull in comparison. they have these very cool cracked ice fireworks, but they don't quite fit with the rest of their program.   apparently, the 'winner' was announced this evening, but it wasn't on their website. i look forward to finding out.

      President gaffes in terror speech     Speech-writers wish Mr Bush would stick to the script  In his latest gaffe, President George W Bush has appeared to suggest that his administration is forever thinking up ways of harming the US and its people.  "Our enemies are innovative and resourceful - and so are we," the US president told a high-level meeting of Pentagon officials.   "They never stop thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people - and neither do we."   His comments came during a signing ceremony for a $417bn defence bill.   White House spokesman Scott McClellan said that Mr Bush's mistakes should reassure rather than alarm.   "Even the most straightforward and plain-spoken people mis-speak," he told the Associated Press.     from BBC News

      [insert rocky theme music here]  i just finished drafting up my thesis. I'm sending it to my committee tomorrow, and we meet on friday. I really really hope that they don't have any more substantive revisions, but only a few word choices/typos/awkward phrasings. writing the last few paragraphs in the conclusion felt like drawing blood from a stone.  i still haven't found a new hairdresser - was waiting until my meeting on friday to get my hair snipped. i think i'm going to have quite a lot taken off.   learned a new word today: austintatious! cheesy, eh? a prospective roommate emailed me and used it. he also said basically nothing nice about where he lives except that it's on the bus route to UT and has a nice pool. a lot of places i've found advertised are in these gated apartment communities for students. what do students, of all people, need to be protected from? roommate searching is so much fun...

      i'm afraid there's also been a dearth of  urlLink interesting thoughts  over here at outlaw liss. i've so worn out from work, my thesis, and hiding from my racist roommates to scour the net and my brain for amusing oddities and faux rebellion.    i should be finished what will hopefully be my final draft by teh end of the night, so everything will be looking up.   speaking of looking up, the last country in vancouver's  urlLink celebration of light , spain, lights up the skies tomorrow night. the entrants have been excellent this year: china and sweden. chris and thibaut took issue with sweden's coordination with the music, but i felt like i was watching fireworks for the first time. this also means that it's been a full year since chris' family were in town!

      my roommates are having this conversation in my dining room right now, looking at a map of the city:  J: So who lives in Surrey anyway?  C: A lot of East Indians J: East Indian Gangsters C: And then there's a lot of asians in Richmond J: Yeah, and all of Vancouver, too.  .... J: All these rich people who come in with their bling bling cars. It would be nice to have people who actually work hard.  C: Yeah, well in Hong Kong, where all of the 'Hongers' come from, they have this one child rule, so the one kid gets all of the wealth from the parents.  ... J: The only times I went to Richmond was to go to Ikea and to this chinese restaurant. No english was spoken. Supposed to be the best Chinese food in Vancouver.  OH MY GOD!!! I knew I live with geeks, but i didn't realize I'm living with bigots!   ooh... homophobic too:  C: This one guy i knew had like no gag reflexes, so i started calling him gay.   C: Davie's the gay district J: The gayest place on earth C: one of the guys said, you can probably buy a lot of sausages on Davie! One of the guys didn't think it was funny, but I did.
