      I went to bed around 11:30PM and got up at 5:35AM.&nbsp; I got to catch the end of sunrise.&nbsp; It was great!&nbsp; Nice and pink.&nbsp; Tomorrow I want to get up around 5:20-5:25AM so I can see more.   Now I'm doing school, which I have been for the past hour and a half.&nbsp; This is so cool.&nbsp; Yesterday I had a violin lesson which went well, then I went to the library.&nbsp; I checked out some books, also got a cd recording of Les Miserables, and a VHS of Pirates of Penzance.&nbsp; The audio and video are due back in&nbsp;two weeks, the books in four.&nbsp; I think I'll bring at least some of the books to camp.   Vickie is coming in FIVE DAYS!&nbsp; YAY FOR YAY!   My days are more productive now.&nbsp; I'm not just sitting around anymore.&nbsp; Some things are weird, like getting used to the fact that I'm 16 and I have my drivers license (it's like, Whoa- how did this happen?) but I'm really happy now.&nbsp; I'm so moody, lol.&nbsp; Two days ago I was feeling really down (Hey, it happens), but now I'm not, and I have a feeling that I won't be for a while.&nbsp; The fact that I'm in a really good mood Pre-Camp is amazing, so imagine how I'll be while I'm there, and when I come home!&nbsp; Camp is so inspiring.&nbsp; I can't WAIT to see people.   School will continue to progress well now, and hopefully I can get a job soon.&nbsp; For a couple of weeks I was just not into anything, but things have turned around... so I am glad.   "YAY FOR YAY!" -Vickie.&nbsp; That pretty much covers it.  (Wow, this blog is so pointless, lol)

      I slept for about 7 hours last night.&nbsp; Yay!   I'm at a site...  urlLink http://i-am-bored.com .&nbsp; It's pretty cool.&nbsp;&nbsp; I found out that I read between 250-300 words per minute (Above Average?).   Here is&nbsp;a quote from Matt Groening:   "Love is a snowmobile racing across the tundra and then suddenly it flips over, pinning you underneath. At night, the ice weasels come."   ????&nbsp; Okay, then.  Here are some quotes from Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me.   "Dr. Evil: You're not quite evil enough. You're semi-evil. You're quasi-evil. You're the margarine of evil. You're the Diet Coke of evil, just one calorie, not evil enough."   "Austin: You're one groovy baby....baby."   Okay, that's enough.&nbsp; Well, one more quote. From The Shawshank Redemption.   "Warden Samuel Norton: I believe in two things: discipline and the Bible. Here you'll receive both. Put your trust in the Lord; your ass belongs to me. Welcome to Shawshank."   Yeah, I'm done now.&nbsp; Really.

      Today&nbsp;I went to&nbsp;church.&nbsp; Which was cool, I guess.   Last night, I&nbsp;was in bed from 3:30-9:30am.&nbsp; I just do not feel tired at a reasonable time.&nbsp; Still, I had 7 hours of sleep!&nbsp;&nbsp;That's what I can consider a "full nights sleep" now.  Hmm.&nbsp; I wonder who reads this blog.&nbsp; If anyone is reading, reply.

      So, I guess blogger is my school/sleep journal.&nbsp; Well, in that case, I finished&nbsp;a science test yesterday, and I picked up some job applications.&nbsp; Today&nbsp;I have school, of course, as well as chores and music.&nbsp; Like everyday.&nbsp; Later I'm going to&nbsp;hand the applications, and then I'm going to go to the music store. &nbsp;Specifically I'm looking for David Lanz, a decent violin and piano duet, and any kind of random pop, such as Vanessa Carlton.   Now onto the sleep portion...&nbsp; I went to bed around 2am.&nbsp; Then my alarm went off at 6:26am, but I pushed snooze.&nbsp; Then I guess I slept through the beeping if/when it sounded again.&nbsp; Around 8am my mom said, "It's getting late!" so that prompted me to get up.&nbsp; So... 2am to 8am... that's still&nbsp;6 hours.&nbsp; Insane, right? &nbsp;Better than 5 1/2 hours...   Updated at 3PM:  I didn't do any school today.&nbsp; Around 10 AM we went out though.&nbsp; I submitted an application to Dunkin Donuts, got a book of soprano arias from the music store, plus we went to the grocery store.&nbsp; I got some Ramen noodles, and Mac and cheese.&nbsp; Mmmm... haven't had stuff like this in a while.&nbsp; It's wonderful...

      I got up at 6:26am-6:30am this morning, having gone to bed around 1am (or somewhere around that time, anyway).&nbsp; That's 5 1/2 hours.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Just an observation.&nbsp; I guess that will come in handy at Camp.&nbsp; Now I just need to throw in some regular exercise so I don't pass out after hiking half a mile to the dining hall...   Also, in case you're wondering why this journal is so friggin BORING it's because the one I use to write my actual feelings in is here: http://livejournal.com/users/oracular_echo

       School went well today.&nbsp; I did Physical Science, which is progressing nicely.&nbsp; Tomorrow I will be doing either Sociology, Physical Science, or Algebra 2.&nbsp; Either one of those, or two, or all three.&nbsp; We'll see when tomorrow comes.    &nbsp;  I need to be done with English 2, Physical Science, and Algebra 2 by the first week or so of October.    &nbsp;  Note- Yahoo Launchcast Radio rocks my world.    &nbsp;  I finished watching the first four episodes of Tenchi in Tokyo today.&nbsp; Next I have episodes eight through 10.&nbsp; Hmmm, I guess I will have to buy the manga for in between.    &nbsp;  I changed the format and colors for my other journal.&nbsp; I love how it is now!&nbsp; Especially compared to before.    &nbsp;  I need to read more.&nbsp; I mean, I read a lot online.&nbsp; But I should read more of actual books.&nbsp; I usually do... not lately though.

       I got a fair amount of school work done today, doing Physical Science, reading about sound waves and such.&nbsp; Pretty interesting.&nbsp; I learned what "ultrasonic" meant, which helps because my dad was an "ultrasonic technician" when he worked.&nbsp; (He is now Retired/Disabled).&nbsp; So, now I understand a little better.&nbsp; Weird.&nbsp; Anyway, as&nbsp;for tomorrow, I'll be doing some more Physical Science and possibly&nbsp;Algebra 2.&nbsp; I also need to make banana nut bread for a bake sale, clean the bathroom, finish up the bible reading this week (thing I'm doing with Vickie), then work on some music.

      Definitely! Someones gotta crush on you! It's Obvious that this guy likes you, so stop doubting it! If hes a little shy and hasnt said anything, maybe you should be the one to make the first move (If you feel the same way of course). If you dont feel the same way, and he has already told you that he likes you, tell him how you feel in the nicest way possible, after all he was brave enough to tell you.       urlLink Does He Like You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      A connection? Perhaps. We shall see; We shall. A crush? A love. But far away; the Physical distance. You cannot know if it may work out. You are stuck. You strive to like everyone you meet, but sometimes they do not like you back. This one is different; Special. Worth it. There is a connection; Something. But what? Will you ever know? No. ...Maybe. Such is life,  you suppose. Please live to understand that you cannot always get what you want. But if something is meant to happen then it will happen. ...Right? We shall see; We shall. So, A connection? …Perhaps.

      First of all, this journal is pointless.  Quiz results, general updates.  I will talk about school and such, though.  If you want to read my main journal, go here.  http://livejournal.com/users/oracular_echo  I got up a little before 10am this morning for some reason.  I slept for more than 7 hours!  Wow!  lol  Now I'm just sitting, and chatting.  I think I'm going to do some writing, then some school to catch up a little.  I got a letter from Vickie yesterday.  I need to write a couple of letters this week for the pen pal club.  I may be getting a job soon, too.  Well, that's all for now.

      Vickie is here and we are having a great time.  We've been having long walks and hikes, then going around to a few places.  Plus movie viewing (older Batman movie, episodes of Tenchi in Tokyo, some Fellowship of the Ring, The Village) and playing games (Trivial Pursuit Junior, Bible Trivia, etc.)  Also throughout the day we'll do some yoga.  I named a position, "Head clamp," for obvious reasons if you'd see it.  Fun stuff.  Anyway, it's so cool to just spend time with her like this.  It's wonderful that she's even here.  Tomorrow afternoon we're going to the beach, I think, then on Monday to an art museum, and to Leif's on Tuesday.  Ideas for activities are still floating around.  Every morning (well, except for this morning) we have and will be walking to Dunkin Donuts.  Yay for half a bagel / donut / muffin.  Mocha swirl latte... yummy... yes, so we will miss things like that at Camp Heritage.  But yeah.  Anyway, just thought I'd update and give a short summary of Vickie's time here and stuff we're up to.   Happy Sabbath!

       Friday night sleep: 4:30AM-8:30AM Saturday night sleep: 11:30PM-5:30AM-8:30AM Sunday night sleep: 12:30AM-5:30AM-6:30AM  Now here I am, with striped toe socks. I was all ready to submit work to school, but the site is still down. It will either be up later today or tomorrow, I guess. So at the moment I'm reading the Bible and awaiting baby sitting a little while from 8:30/ish through ??.  Later today I need to go to the bank and like, Wal Mart, or the Mall or something. Oh, and yesterday mom and I watched Renaissance Man starring Danny DeVito. And last week I saw Cold Mountain, which was a  great  movie! Now I want the soundtrack.  Heehee
