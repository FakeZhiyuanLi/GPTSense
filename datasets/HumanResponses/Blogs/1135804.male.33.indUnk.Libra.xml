      flew down to LA last week over thursday/friday to speak at a conference called  urlLink urban youth workers institute.   over these years, i've attended my share of conferences and spoke at many as well and after a while, they all kind of smell the same.  to be honest, modern/postmodern, young/old, boomer/millenial, this generation and that generation...blah blah blah blah.  not trying to knock anyone.  i enjoying going and speaking, especially for the purpose of being reminded that God is working all around us in so many different ways.  but when, it's all said and done, i come to the same conclusion that there's nothing new under the sun.  granted, there are those you have a deeper resonation with.  for example, i flow more with those from the emergent thought process but i'm only hanging out with folks that are like-minded, am i not missing out?  am i not indirectly, doing the very thing that i'm criticizing about the modernistic thought process and church.    the one other thing i dislike about the majority of the conferences out there is that they're so damn white.  oh, wait, i should be a little more politically correct and tNIVish and said, they're so populated with the Anglo community.  it's white speakers, white presenters, white musicians, white artists, white whatever.  nothing against my white brothers and sisters but first, let me speak to the non-white folk out there:  where in the hell are you?  speak up!  to my fellow asian folk:  stop being so damn passive and typically asian-minded and step out and do you thang.  for goodness sakes!  and to the conference coordinators, shall we take just one step closer towards the kingdom of God?  let's be more intentional about building platforms and empowering other minorities and women to share their story, sing their songs, rap their flows, and share their vibrations.    so, yeah, back to the conference in LA.  it was refreshing because i would say that about 90% of the 1300+ people that were there were african-americans, hispanics, and asians.  it was so good to be in that setting again having grown up in a predominantly black/hispanic neighborhood in san francisco.  the multiethnic/cultural vision is a core vision at quest.  funny to look book at the first gathering at quest a little over 2 years ago.  there were 11 people total:  10 koreans and 1 chinese.  and as we kept beating that drum of our desire to reflect the urban landscape of seattle and move a step towards the glimpse of the Kingdom, it's been a painful process but slowly moving forward.  of the 150 people at quest, i'd say there's about 30% korean, 20% other asians, 40% angglo, and 10% others.  as we've gathered together under the banner of christ for the past 2 years, it'll be interested, as we've planned, to start discussing racial issues and tensions in the coming year.  good times.

      spend some time with some other men from the church my wife and i planted couple years ago.  urlLink quest  has been a dream church for us. by no means is it perfect and free from hurt or growing pains but the closest thing to community for us.  exciting and humbling how god is unfolding the story of the community at quest.  anyway, went fishing with these men.  hung out.  talked.  laughed. made fun of each other and as i see it, through our very lives and our commitment to live out those lives, learned how to be better fishers of people. an interesting lesson for me i thought.  we caught zero fish amongst four men (technically one but george song blew the retrieval and the rest is history), and yet, there was much to be joyful for.  simply, joy to be in the together. joy to be in the midst of creation.  joy to be amongst god's creation. i need to relax if 'spiritual fishing' isn't going as hot as i want to it to -- whatever that means.  god needs to continue and i need to submit to the deconstruction of success in my mind.  it doesn't have to equate to a big building, big budget, big congregation, or whatever big.  i can be joyful to be amongst others, joyful to be in the midst of god's work, joyful to be part of god's work and certainly, joyful because GOD is.  indeed, GOD is.

      the over-rated performer/writer/singer/poet who's still by far has more talent in her pinkie than i do in my whole life once responded in an interview with the  urlLink Rolling Stones  in this manner..."i'm just a person who is honestly trying to live my life and asking, 'How do you be spiritual and live in the world without going to a monastary?'"  and because there's been this disconnect with many modern churches with this very question, folks are leaving the churches by the thousands.  churches are dying.  70,000 churches have closed down their doors in the past 20 years in North America.  For every one new churchplant in urban locations in America, three churches are being shut down.  and so when established churches and pastors keep asking me, "Why plant a new church?", or "Why did you plant Quest?," or "Why do you have a vision for planting new churches?'" - it pisses me off.  just really pisses me off.  it's not a modern problem, or a so-called "postmodern problem, or an emerging problem - it's a human problem.  it's our problem.  it's my problem.  it's the church's problem when there's a serious disconnect when the very calling is for the church to connect people to a faith community and more importantly, to be an agent of connection to a Higher Being - thankfully a personal High Being -- God -- made that much more personal and intimate to us in Jesus Christ.  so, it begs to question. is my life reflective of a connection to Christ?  is my life compelling others to examine their connection?  is the church of which i am a part of connecting?

      if there's ever a good excuse why one's been lagging in blogging, keeping in touch, flossing their teeth, doing their laundry, paying the bills on time, taking care of the weeds, blah, blah, blah, blah...i've got a legitimate reason.  minhee and i gave birth to our third child on june 24th at 9.15 pm. jedidiah youngheum cho was born at 8 lbs and 11 ounces.  he defied all genetic possibilities and arrived big, fat, and handsome.  the handsome part, i understand, because of minhee.  from here on out, i will put the pressure of the world on this boy to live out my NBA dreams.  move over yao ming, chomama jr. in the house.  years ago, someone once mentioned that she came to believe in God once she experienced the birth of his child.  i had no idea what she was talking and obviously, in a certain extent, i will never but the absolute mystery and beauty of a child incubating in your wife's womb and then, to emerge, is simply and absolutely humbling and source of much revelation.  who says God no longer performs miracles?

      walked into the cafe yesterday to have one of our customers say, "hey, you're in the front page!"  and sure enough, was amazed to see  urlLink a picture and an article  about the church.  why or how, i do not know.  but praying that God can use it to further what he is doing at Quest and beyond.

       arrived into cannon beach today and hanging out here for a day.&nbsp; nice to have the kids walk around the beach; flew a $4.99 kite today.&nbsp; you get what you pay for.&nbsp; enjoyed the beautiful rocks along the beach.&nbsp;     &nbsp;  but why do people worship rocks and mountains when they can worship the living God that created all things?&nbsp;     &nbsp;  why?    &nbsp;
