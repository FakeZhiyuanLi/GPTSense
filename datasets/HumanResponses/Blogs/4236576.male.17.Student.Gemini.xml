      Why wont you return my calls? Why wont you see me? Tell me to go away? Why do you hate me when I love you soo much? Are you getting back at me? or are you doing wrong? Why cant we talk? What does he do for you that I dont? Does he know you better than I know you? Does he know everything about you? like how you eat, sleep, walk, EVERY motion and thought that you do? Why do you love him, not me? How can you hurt me when you say you love me so much? You dont believe in US do you? Do you really regret meeting me? Do you even care? That I'm sitting here writing to you and you will never read this because you dont care?           WHY DONT YOU CARE?

      I guess its over. I found out the truth. You never believed me that I changed. You never gave me the chance. All you did was played the game I played you in. The game you promised that we would work out. You promised me that we could work this out. I actually thought that we had something. I actually thought that when you stayed with me, that it meant somthing to us, thats why I changed. Thats why I changed. I caught you in a lie, a lie I thought you never would do. I caught you cheating on me....something I never thought you would do. I thought you said that you loved me. They say 2 wrongs dont make a right, so why are you doing this? I cant believe this.. I really cant.. I dont have a clue to do anymore. Im lost without you, and you dont care. As a matter of fact, you havent read one single post of mine yet. Just simple, you changed, I thought I knew you, but you turned out to be a cheater like me, but your happy doing it, I regret my wrong doing, but your enjoying every moment of it. In fact, your on the phone with him, laughing, joking around about how stupid I am. Well I guess I am stupid. I should of never cheated on you, let alone believe that you would give me another chance without something hidden. I dont know what to do with my life anymore now. You tell me to go back to the girl I cheated on you with. But the fact is, and you know it, there was nothing enough to ever consider putting them above you. You were my one and only. I guess my lifes lesson is no matter what you do right, if you did wrong, you will never do right. I tried so hard to make it better, but I guess you didnt want that. I feel like you took a knife to my heart and not just a stab, but you cut it into pieces. I know I hurt you baby and I tried to fix it, You actually had me believing that there was light at the end of the tunnel. You never gave up on our relationship, WHY NOW? Why do you give up when you get what you want? You wanted me to be true to you. Here I am baby! I'm right here, Why dont you want me? why have you changed? Why dont you love me? What does he have that I dont have? I guarantee that he wont ever treat you better than how I was treating you. Yes, he might not cheat on you like I did in the past, but he will never love you the way I do. I hope someday you will relize that.... I miss it all.. I miss every moment spent with you. I miss it already. I cant talk to you anymore. I wont answer your calls. I CANT talk to you. It hurts to much inside to know that if you dont want to be me when I can treat you like a Queen, I cant. I love you more than anything in this world. My love was off and one for you in the beginning, but one thing is for sure, I could never imagine life without you. I guess imagining doesnt do any good now cause im imagining that we are happy. But I guess its a dream, a dream that will never come true, cause you dont want to try. Its been on my mind lately but I have to get it out, I did something that I didnt want to tell you. The other day at practice, I saw her, The one I cheated on you with 8 months ago. She yelled across the cafeteria, that she heard "that kelly left you for good". I couldnt resist it, I couldnt let her go on believing that I was single, I knew that that would only bring me trouble. I turned around and said no thats not true, then I continued to walk.  She asked "Are you too good to talk to me now?". I turned around and said "what do you want from me?". I know you would be mad at me for talking to her so I didnt tell you. She asked if we were together. I said yes. She asked if I love her. I said no. She asked if I love you, I said "I love her more than youll ever know." and walked away, without saying a word. I walked out of that room feeling like butterflys coming from me. I felt like the best I ever had. I had set things straight for once. I didnt want to have a run-in with her ever again, so I set it straight this time. But unfortunately, I didnt have the nerve to tell you. I knew you wouldnt believe me so I just didnt tell you, I didnt lie because you never asked. Ive been meaning to tell you but all you do is get mad at me so I didnt bring it up because all you would do is leave me for it. I just cant believe its over now. After all weve been through, the good and the bad. Some people say, that if we made it through the hell we did, then we could live through marriage. I guess you didnt want that did you? You played with my heart. But like you, I cant stay, I cant stay here try to work it out. I know you were hurt. But when I cheated on you, I hurt myself too, now im hurting again and I think its best to let it go. We cant go on like this anymore. I had that feeling that there was someone else, and I was dreadfully right...I cant believe you did this to me. I cant believe it has to end like this. I loved you soo much, and I still do more than anything. I would give anything to keep you but I cant keep you if you dont want me, so ... I'll miss you soo much.. I'll think about you all the time. There will never be anyone to fill your place. It will take a long time to fix the whole you are leaving in my heart...                                Without you girl, my life is incomplete...

      Well another day gone bad. Since my license is suspended, I cant drive to see her. (Well when my parents are around anyways ;) . ) Well my parents were supposed to be picking up my sister this morning so I told her I could stop up around 10:30 /11ish. Around 10 I call her house and her grandma tells me that she is still sleepin and to call back about 12:30/1ish. Well, by about 10:15ish I find out that my parents arent leaving and I also have to go into work for about an hour at 11:30. So, I dont call her until about 12 when I get out of work and she screams at me because I ruined her plans and her day because I didnt come up like I said I could... Like all fights, its my fault, even though she couldnt get up to see me? When there was a possibility that I would come up... Today she went with a friend to a baseball game, which I believe she saw her special "friend there". She has been on the phone all day everytime I call, she then says she has to go, I know shes talking to him.. I dont know what to do. I try to make her happy but I cant get into her, I cant get the chance. The only Idea in her head is that Im a cheater and I cant treat her better. Everytime I try, she pushes me away, saying that I treat her bad. I asked her to decide today, Me or him, she thought about it, then said IDK. Thats pretty much saying "Fuck off", I dont like you anymore. I do everything for her. Yes I did my wrong but am I not allowed to treat her good? That is me. But its very hard to be me when all I get is my mistakes rubbed in my face and treated like dirt. I guess I'm ready to face the world, full of riddicule and prejudice. Instead of being a bystander, I'm a victim of profiling, for having a short period in my life where I made a few mistakes. People never knowing the true me, my future ruined...Will I move on, or have I fallen in love with this girl for good? Idk what to do.

      Well, I got the answers I was looking for :( . Tonight, I talked to her, in which she didn't want to talk to me again. I thought about if she likes someone else, then I thought who. Well I thought about it a bit. The answers came together right then. The reason she is treating me like dirt, is to give herself a reason to talk to her "best friend" Mike, who she likes. That would explain why she doesnt ever want to talk to me, wants to talk to him, and puts him over me. If she likes him, making me look bad would make herself feel better, thats why she has been accusing me of cheating on her. Soooo I called her, her line was busy, she was on the phone when she told me she was watching TV. I finally got through and she said she wasnt on the phone. I asked her if she likes him, she said no. I explained what I thought and then she admitted that she likes him. I asked if he treats her better than I treat her, she said yes. I guess she hasnt been paying much attention to what ive done for her. She said all the stuff ive done doesnt mean anything to her. She said i dont care about her and I'm not there for her to talk to. But in contradiction, I am there for her, I wasnt before and thats why lately ive been trying to be there for her, and when i try to be ther for her, shes too busy talking to him. I cant believe this. That is why she left me today, for a reason to see him. I knew he liked her, now i know that she likes him. She keeps rubbing it in my face that I liked my "best friend" way back last november or so. For some reason she feels that If i do something wrong, It makes it OK for her to do it to me. What ive done is wrong and I know that. I regret alot of the mistakes Ive made but now she is doing the same to me and I cant do anything about it. I cry myself asleep knowing that Ive been trying for nothing, trying to get to her, trying to show her who I am, and she has had her head so far up his butt, that she thinks I dont care! Yes money doesnt mean everything, but I do feel that drving 20 miles just to see her for 5 minutes, calling her while im at work just to tell her that I love her, making up silly little sayings, doing tiny little things to show that i care, do show that I care about her, but she has overrun all the things ive done to show that I care about her with these thoughts that I dont, just so she can run to him. I knew my suspicion of him wasnt just a hunch, I finally got played with my own game, after I changed my ways... I guess Im too late. I never do anything right.    Sometimes I feel so alone

      Well it's Wednesday night. Its been another bad day in our relationship. This time she had just gone off the deep-end. Have you ever felt like you try soo hard and nobody notices you? Well for once, I dont care if people notice me. I want her to notice me, I want her to realize who I am. I give this girl everything, I put her on top of the world, bow down on my knees and treat her like the Princess she is. Although, now I've had it. I have completely gone broke now. I have spent all my paychecks and have overdrawn my bank account because EVERYDAY I have gone up and seen her, taken her out to eat, drove around, done anything she wanted. All I ever got was a simple "Thank you". I dont expect money or an award or anything but I would like some appreciation. I do all this and more for her and all I get is treated like dirt and bitched at. Today for instance, I told her last night that "I might be able to stop up tommorow around 1". Well last night I painted the interior of my car and I expected to have it dry and all installed by 1 today. Well of course, I didn't have it done, and I called her about 12 to tell her that my car wasn't finished and I couldnt be on time. Well of course, she got mad at something unexpected. (Which I expected her to be mad) Well then I go out and try to have it all dry and it wasnt working. I got frustrated and put all the parts into my car with wet paint, then I drove up to see her. I showed up at her house around 4 and she wanted nothing to do with me. This has been the 4th time she has gotten mad at me for something I did that I didn't expect to happen, and I had enough, I left. As I'm leaving, she comes out and asks what my problem is? She asks me why I screwed her over for me car?, and why I put my car over her and I care more about my car than her and I just LOST it on her. I flipped and asked her why she has been treating me like dirt lately, when I give her everything I possibly can. She asked back "Why did you treat me like dirt when I treated you good before?" Speechless, I looked down and said that I "was an ASS and was very wrong" and that I regret every bit of it. She said its "not a nice feeling is it?" which was her acknowledgement of her bad-treatment to me. She then started rubbing it in my face that I was a liar and a cheater and that I will never change. In shock, I told her that she was being a bitch, which was a big mistake, first off it's not right to say that and it was mean cause she is my girlfriend, but she was being soo mean to me when I havent done anything wrong. I cheated on her back in January. 7 months ago, and to this day, she acts like it was yesterday. Protecting herself, she started assuming that I was with another girl this morning and I wasnt painting my car. I guess the paint on my clothes, the paint all over my fingers and face, and the wet tacky paint on the doors ment nothing to her. For sure it was just for her protection. Yes, I truely feel that there is someone else in her life. Maybe she hasnt done anything wrong, but she may be thinking about it. She has a "best friend" named Mike, who she never talked to until about a few weeks ago. Everynight I call her, her line is busy, or she picks up and I ask her if she is on the phone and she says yes "It's just Mike hunny, dont worry" and says shell call me when she gets off. *(Thats at about 9pm) around 3 in the morning, I'm laying on the couch, waiting for her to call. Thinking maybe she fell asleep on accident, I call her, she's still on the phone. I trust him to an extend, but how can she be on the phone with this guy for SOO long and talk about "nothing" like she says? I'm losing my trust in her because everytime I turn around shes talking to him, and she will talk to him over me. She's always on the phone with him. More than me. She tells me that she doesnt talk to me as much because I'm always busy, but she used to call me at work, call me while I was working at home, Now, I'm not really that busy but she says I am. I stay up at night, hoping she will call me, but she doesnt until about 2 or 3 in the morning, and I know shes not online the whole time cause I even checked a few times. Is she seeing him? or is she seeing somebody else? Even if she isnt seeing somebody else, I think shes thinking about seeing somebody. I feel as if she is drifting away and I'm trying so hard to keep her, everything possible. This website for one. While shes on the phone with HIM, I'm here writing stuff that I cant even talk to her about anymore cause she gets mad. I just wish she would treat me a little better. I know that you cant tell if i person has changed in only a week, but she wont believe that im different, that I am trying. She has broken a promise to me, which is killing me inside. She promised that if I tried the way I did before, that she would try. But she isnt holding up her end of the deal. She isnt trying at all. She is sitting there making plans for us that are impossible for me and then when I cant, That makes me the bad guy and I'm not trying. When was the last time she came to see me? when was the last time she wanted to spend time with me. And not her friend, go to the mall and drive, spend time with me. I found a spot I really wanted to take her to watch the Sunset, which is kinda gay but ya know, I thought itd be a lil romantic and what not but she wanted to go drive around, go to the mall, go see her uncle and all this stuff just for her. I'm trying soo hard for US, but all she wants me to try for is me to make her happy. I can seriously say that I'm not happy. All I've done is make her happy. Inside, I am happy with myself because I have done everything right, and been myself. But emotionally, I'm dying inside. I'm giving my heart to her, and I feel like she is kicking it around like a toy and she doesn't care. What happened to the girl I fell in love with? Who is she with? What happened to the girl that layed down with me while I explained the reasons I love her, the girl that I layed down with and for every letter in the Alphabet, there was a word that described her in a way that nobody else knows her. Well I don't even know her anymore. She is just a monster that is playing with my heart when she knows that I'm giving her my all. Yes it has taken me a while to get my goals straight with her, At first I cheated on her, then I didnt know what to do. But now I do, I want to be with her, I can't find anyone like her in the world. She is unique, she is, my baby. But shes not there for me in the ways she was before. Im here for her, giving her everything, but she doesnt care, shes treating me like there is someone else. I just need some answers. I'm myself, why isn't she herself?

      Its getting late in the day, getting ready to go to work soon. Still havent talked to her today. I've called about a dozen times or more but I get no answer. Is she ignoring me? is she mad because I stuck up for her last night? Is there someone else in her life? I just miss her sooo much and I'm worried, I feel alone here at home all by myself, nobody to talk to. Maybe I'm just paranoid or psychotic or something like that. Oh well, off to work I go, Alone, just another person in his daily routine. I talked to my Bro last night, hes doing good, I miss him even though hes still in the county, Denver is a long way away. I miss being out there, the 2 weeks I spent out there were alot of fun. We talked for a while, still figuring out stuff for the future. If hes going to be a Syracuse cop, what im going to do? What if he is a State Trooper? either way, after graduation this year, I'm going out there on a road trip to live with him for a lil bit while I get my college plans worked out. As it is, I'm looking at a University in Philly and they are real interested but the tutition is out of this world and i have to get a 1410 on my SAT to get in. It's tough but I would love to do it, My mind is set on going to a big college but with a lil help from our wonderful armed forces, my tutition sould be easily paid. Oh well, Just stressed out alot about alot of things lately. My life is too tense for the things I'm going through School, college, losing my license, and working things out with this wonderful girl I'm in love with.

      Let me tell you a story about I girl I fell in love with. Well first off it started kinda sketchy, she didn't like me, but I was mesmerized by her. After a few months of WONDERFUL relationship, I made the biggest mistake of my life.. I cheated on her. For 7 months after that day, life has been HELL for Us. After my lies, and her insecurity, we fell apart. Here we are 10 months, 2 days and 20 hours. Stuck in a position we wish we weren't. See in the last 6 days, we have gone on 6 wonderful dates, done things we should of done, and fixed things that were messed up my mistakes. Now, things are looking up, except my daily reminders of what I did wrong in the past. See, I put nothing above this girl, but to her, she feels that it's an act. I stick up for her, try to help her with her problems, not once ever ask for anything from her, give her me, day and night. My daily reminders of the past, the constant nagging from every1 about me being a cheater, nobody trusts me, and nomatter how hard I try, nobody will listen to me. I feel like a left out soul, an apple gone bad, a waste of peoples time, I see people and now wonder what bad things they think of me. People who do things soo horrible get more respect than me. Drug dealers, alcohics, chronic cheaters, chronic liars, BAD PEOPLE. Ever feel like your labeled wrong? ever feel that you did something by mistake? even though my mistakes were indeed mine, is that really who I am? or did I just have a bad spot in my life? Is that even possible? Can you go on living a wonderful life and have a few ugly months of your life where you go bad? where you do some wrong? Why don't people believe in change? I truely have changed back to myself, the caring loving guy that she fell in love with, but nobody will listen to my story, well thats what people think it is, they think its a story to cover up what I did, and to save my dignity. NO it's not, I just have this anger for all the people who have done that, and that doesnt make me any different, people dont believe in exceptions. This girl has stayed with me through thick and thin, been there all the time, but her patience grew thin, and now I feel that there is nothing left of her but the evil stains I left on her. I love this girl. She isn't a girl to me, she is everything to me, at times, I didn't believe so, but I believe what matters most is that I do now and that won't change. I don't want people to trust me, I want to have to earn that, but All I ask for a litlle hope in me. They say that if you have hope and faith in people, they can change and if your hope and faith is shown, it helps that person. Well all I get is put down, ridiculed, picked on, rubbed in my face that I once was a cheater. Yes, they say once a cheater, alwayz a cheater, but then again, is that alwayz true? There is a chance that one out of a million people could be purple, theres a chance that wars would end, and yes there is a chance that the impossible is possible. I don't know who I am anymore, but I know I am not who people say I am, I am proud of what I am. And I will not be known as a cheater, liar or anything that I'm not. To some I was known as the sweetest guy, a sensitive guy, and a perfect guy. I'm not here to complain, im here to tell you about my dilema, my problem that the world will not believe in that miracle, that one in a million, and I know that things cant be proven in 7 days, but if im not given the chance to show myself, then my life can be seriously turned in the wrong direction. I have done wrong, on several occasions, I can say that, but I can say that I have done things that none of you boyfriends have ever done, I'm not saying a date evens out cheating on her, but things I have done for love are original, true and so mesmerizing, that I have given advice to some about this. I just want a chance, a chance to be known, a chance to be seen, and chance to be myself, for people to sit back and say, damn, I knew he wasnt a bad kid, I can truely say, with my bad actions and my bad reputation, I have not made one friend, in fact, I've lost most of my friends because of it,  because im not trusted around people. I'm pleading for a chance, a chance to prove myself, I know that the past wont disappear but, if people keep thinking of the past over the present, how can they move on? Where are all the optimistic people in the world? Am  I just blessed with a bad rep and a surrounding of Pesimistic people or am I truely cursed with a bad rep for ever? Is it possible to change your life without moving or changing the people your around? I'm in love with a girl that doesnt know me, a girl who just knows that I can be a good guy but is constently reminded that I'm a cheater. If people dont stop rubbing it in, how can I change? Can true love have a flaw?  everything  has flaws. right? Nobody is perfect, but some people like this girl, come pretty damn close. Im asking for a chance, this is my plee
