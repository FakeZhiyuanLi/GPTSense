       Friday  This is like a school assignment "what I did during the weekend".  Took the boys camping, with A, to the Forest of Dean. Met A in Gloucester and loaded up the car, can't wait till I am back on the road, I feel emasculated and it's not fair for her to do all the driving.  Campsite (Christchurch) pretty good and got the tent up quickly.  Boys were sweet and we went to a pub in Lydbrook, the Waterside, had an OK meal and left circa 9.30 to a bleeping phone with a message from K asking to speak to kids, which they did.  All packed into the tent and told them a few stories and before too long we were asleep - not because of the stories. Swapped my bag with A as she was cold. Slightly broken sleep as always seems to be the case on the first night under canvas.   Saturday  Got up and headed off to find some breakfast, wound up in Monmouth, last time I was there was in 1991.  Found a Cafe (Monmow Cafe) and had a cooked breakfast, J particularly cranky and wouldn't eat as there were no croissants and wouldn't have toast as it was too thick - what do you do??  T in good form.  Went and got supplies for Picnics and meals and headed off the Dean Heritage Centre, very good and the boys did some rubbings which T bored of first and J started tire of. A very patient and kind.  Quite a place the forest, at one time very industrial and leading edge with strong arts, forestry and mining.  T liked the Glos Old Spot pigs and A spotted Cray fish which caught the boys attention.  Drove to where A's grandparents used to live in Rodley, boys slept.  Had a picnic in the woods of the A4426 - it rained.  Early on the day A naively suggested we would see a film if the boys were good and the weather was poor.  Despite being tired, the boys were good, J imploring T to comply when cracks appeared in his patience.  Sharakova won the tennis, I was pleased for her.  The weather was OK and after a nap, where A was very sweet and beautiful, we kicked a ball around and then went to see Shrek 2, good movie and A enjoyed it despite thinking she wouldn't.  Tried calling K before we went in and got a text on exiting telling me my phone was off, tried calling again on mob and LL but no answer. Fired up a BBQ and cooked (or rather A did) some chicken and sausages and had a good meal with red wine. Put the flagging boys to bed, kissed them, swapped "I love yous" and lay in the moonlight with A talking in hushed tones (Isn't that whispering?) and it was lovely.  I am so lucky.   Sunday  Slept better last night, possibly the wine, and had difficulty surfacing but did and took a call from K asking why the boys had not called, explained and they chatted to her.  She asked if I would look after boys Sun night when we got back and I said I need to get ready for Monday as we had been away since Fri, bit of argy bargy. I can't understand why there is animosity about taking them away and calls to get them to speak and yet when I return them she wants to go out.  Packed up and went to Symonds Yat, walked on north side of river, took bridge (Bindles) to other side and stopped for a Picnic - it rained, hard.  Soaked through but made it to hand ferry and changed the boys into dry clothes and went up to Symonds Yat Rock.  Great views of River Wye and RSPB were spotting Peregrine Falcons.  T managed to pick one out perched on a tree which impressed all the twitchers.  A bought the boys a card each and we set off for Ciren.  K rang ranting that she wanted to watch the football (??)tonight and I better not be going out(??)if she can't, and that she had bought a pirate copy of Shrek 2 and wanted to watch it with the boys and I had spoilt the experience. Strange.  Dropped two very tired and tetchy boys at the house and headed to the flat where A was miffed that O had not watered plants and had something of a party.  Bit of tension and I made polite conversation with O.  Then decided to clean windows and while doing this A mellowed with O - flat looks a lot better with clean windows!  Snatched bits of Euro 2004 final and delighted that underdog won - and what good underdogs!  Had a bath and we both went to bed clean and in clean sheets with candles which was sweet and beautiful.   Learning Points   Take a Cooker Camping Get the boys to bed in good time Plan activities in advance Tell K as much as possible well in advance to avoid hassle Must do something for A for being so lovely
