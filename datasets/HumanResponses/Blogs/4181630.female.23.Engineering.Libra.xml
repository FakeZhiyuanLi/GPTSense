      Have you ever wondered why?  Has it ever crossed your mind that sometimes bad things will happen and you're powerless to do anything about them?  Isn't is weird that when things seem to be going well, your prayer life is sorted, and God seems to be really blessing you, that that's the time that something unexpected happens? That's when something that has always worked before goes belly-up?  I'm not so sure it's weird at all... In fact I'm sure that it's not. After all, when things are bad you rely on God. When they're not you get compacent. When you're in a good place spiritually, you're sure to have left the back door open elsewhere....  like now, for example, I've been away on soul in the city and sion summer camp (WOOHOO!!!) and now I'm back at work. Second day back and I'm going pretty well, I'm actually working faster than normal and not surfing the internet nearly as much as usual. So what happens? The software comes up with an error that no-one's heard of, and that no-one, not even the developers, can decipher, as the lead developer has left the company.  But that's just the backdoor that was left open for the devil to try to influence my life. Well, he's not about to win. He can make my life as difficult as he wants, but he'll never win. In fact the more he tries, and the more I know he's there, the more I KNOW that Jesus is here.. by which logic the devil should just leave me alone :-)

      Spinning chairs are so cool aren't they?  I mean, they go round and round, they can go clockwise as well as anticlockwise; if you're really lucky they might also go forwards and backwards, and possibly even up and down!  Such a simple thing, and yet such a beautiful one!  With one chair you can get as much simple pleasure as you get from the horses merry-go-round at the fair.  I do not recommend eating boiled sweets or drinking tea while spinning

      This blog exists merely so that I don't have to remember to sign posts when commenting on other people's blogs.  Having said that it will also be a place for me to record good things and God things that happen so that I can't forget about them!
