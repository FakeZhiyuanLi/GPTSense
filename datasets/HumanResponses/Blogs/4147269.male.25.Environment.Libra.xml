      What am I going to do this week? "Whatever I want to, Gosh!" saw Napoleon Dynamite for the second time last night, and once again i am convinced that those that enjoy bashing the movie as a failed unfunny cinematic waste of film are just jealous and bitter their geek lives in highschool didn't end in the way Napolean's did, or maybe they are upset that their screen play wasn't taken seriously, or maybe they just missed the final wedding scene..... a few more sweaty hours in front of the TV practicing your moves would have done the trick. or maybe you never owned a pair of moon boots...but for anyone who loves tether ball, didn't have a date to the prom and has a liger sketched on the outside of their notebook, "Probrably the sweetest animal ever..." you will give this film the appreciation that it deserves, and for the rest of us, we just thought it was damn funny.....  this week will be spent, damning clothes that i no longer wear to the depths of a goodwill pile, in hopes of finding a new home, taking all the old cell phones, and computers to recycle and finally catching the Yankees get wooped by the Rangers, keep those bats warm boys...only to finish the week off to KC to do some old fashion nothing really.....

       It has come to my attention that I am not as young as I once was, on a rare occasion last night I hit up the local saloon for a couple of beers, and now this morning I am paying for it...it was fun, but its always the same thing, have some beers, talk chat, make fun of all the loosers that we see which in fact only just keeps us from feeling like loosers because we are the same as everyone else. and how is it every time we are out someone gets in some kind of lets see whos johnson is bigger, of course it doesnt help when a girl you are with drops the N bomb, sometimes i wonder how people still get by with such ignorance, ignorance elected bush and stupidity is running the country....      "we know you are hard, because we have seen you drink from noon until noon again."

      New, idea, well at least new to me, and plus it gives you something to type so it sounds like you are actually doing work. Slept a little late this morning, up late last night, couldnt sleep. Don't know why.... Listening to the Killers here at work, need to head out and grab a Starbucks maybe get a little energized, need to make som phone calls, looking forward to the weekend, but the tan I got at the beach is starting to itch, hope i am not peeling....
