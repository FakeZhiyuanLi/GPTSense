       Hey girls, well yesterday wasn't great for me either. I had no breakfast, shake and carrots for lunch, melba toast for a snack, but then I had 2 oreos before the game. Then for supper, I tried to be all healthy at the restaurant by ordering an eggwhite omlette, but when the waitress brought the thing out it had french fries with it! I mean, that's like ordering a vegetarian entree and getting steak on the side. I wasn't going to eat them....but I did, lol. Meh, there weren't a whole lot at least, and I suppose I can  almost  justify it, since that is the first time I've had fries in 3 weeks. I have decided I can eat crap (moderate crap) for one meal a week, so that just means I'll have to be good this weekend. I didn't work out yesterday either. I came home from the game and fell asleep as soon as my snot-filled head hit the pillow.      I am going to try and do some moderate exercise tonight. Probably walking, because I am still not feeling well. Perhaps I shocked my body last week and this cold is its way of saying, "Baby steps please, I'm used to a steady diet of white sugar and grease." I am planning on going tent shopping tonight, so that should give me a wee bit of exercise too. I keep wanting to go buy clothes, since my summer wardrobe is REALLY sad, but then I keep thinking, "Don't do that, you might have to buy a smaller size in a month!" Not likely, but it keeps money in my wallet, lol. See you all at the meeting.

      Breakfast - cornflakes with blueberries  Lunch - baked potato with sour cream  Pre-game Snack - tortilla and cream cheese, 2 fat free oreos  Dinner - (ugh) french onion soup with cheese, breaded calamari   Exercise - walking 10 minutes to and from the damn baseball field, thenhustling my tush from the plate to 3rd base while Heather screams "MOVE IT, JONES!", only to be called out at third b/c I overran the base by half a foot. >:(   Looking back, I have to say I'm a high dairy-food person. I have chocolate milk every day, and usually have a milk-based shake or cream cheese at least once, too. I try to make it 1% or lite whenever possible, though.   Kate: Creamcheese Pinwheels are simply : 1 tortilla, spread some creamcheese on it (I like lite smoked salmon), then another tortilla, then another thin layer of creamcheese (I usually have just plain lite for the second layer), then roll it up, using the creamcheese kind of like glue, and slice it into little circles. Its kind of fun and snacky, but reasonably low fat, and tortillas are fat free.

      First of all, HARSHALA, WHERE ARE YOU?!?!?  Second of all, I just realized that I've messed up my days, and yesterday was Day 10, not Day 9.  Third of all, I remembered that I had a thin-crust personal veggie pizza with lite cheese for dinner on Monday! Sharron "Food Fugue" Jones. :P  Yesterday, I had a shake for breakfast, I had a baked potato for lunch and some chicken strips (alright, I KNOW that wasn't good for me), and had a tortilla/cream cheese pinwheel and peas for dinner, with a sorbet and banana smoothey for dessert. I didn't eat much, but if I wasn't taking that multivitamin, I know it wouldn't be good for me.  Speaking of, I think the multivitamin is doing good things; my skin has&nbsp;been a little better and I'm generally feeling good. I may be imagining things, but I think my nails are growing faster, too?  I went out to Centennial Park for a long walk last night, and found out they have a really cool greenhouse out there. Kudos to Mississauga for having such a great community facility.  I had my weigh in yesterday, and according to Heather's scale, I've actually GAINED 5 lbs. I was feeling pretty bitter about that until Bindu walked up and showed me how she can make her weight on the scale fluctuate by 10-15 lbs based on where her feet were. I would like to tentatively say that I believe my jeans&nbsp;were a little looser than usual this morning, so I'm going to put my faith in the measurements on August 20th. :)  &nbsp;

      Well Girls, I finally weighed myself.&nbsp; It says I have lost 2lbs, which I'm very impressed with.&nbsp; Yesterday my tooth was hurting me, I painfully&nbsp;ate a turkey sub from subway.&nbsp; For dinner I had a torilla shell with low fat refried beans, cheese, onions, red peppers, tomatoes and some cajun spices.&nbsp; It was great!&nbsp; I had some low fat popcorn with kernels salt and vinegar spice and some cherry's.   I haven't gotten one workout in yet this week - I know I'm terrible.&nbsp; I could make exuses...but what would they do really;)&nbsp; I'm heading to the gym right now for my lunch break to do some weights.&nbsp;   I have almost no plans this weekend so I'm going to spend time at the gym and cleaning to make up for the lack of phyical excersise this week.&nbsp;   You are all doing really well!&nbsp; Keep it up.

       Not much difference yesterday. Coffee for breakfast, shake, grapes, and melba toast for lunch, apple for snack. Dinner was tuna, lite cottage cheese, carrots, and leftover canned tomatoes.&nbsp;Over the course&nbsp;of the evening&nbsp;I had a Fruit-to-Go, some raspberries, a few pickles, and a piece of cheese. I went swimming, but I didn't get a whole hour in. I guess I did about 40 minutes. I would have gone for a walk or something to make up the rest of the time, but I am getting a cold and just wanted to sleep. Darn sick boyfriend; always breathing...    &nbsp;  I'm getting very antsy to weigh myself. Hey, you know what I haven't had in a long time? A doughnut. That just occurred to me. (I used to eat them almost every day when I was in school.) I don't even want one; neat!    &nbsp;   &nbsp;

           Hi all, evidently the people around here are nosier than I thought. It is probably best to limit discussion of this blog to the blog itself unless you know how to encrypt the spoken word.        Sorry Kate, I didn’t think anyone was listening in the lunchroom. I think we should start making up stories about how much speed we have been doing to help us lose weight, and see how fast that gets around.

      Monday - Shake for breakfast, tuna and crackers for lunch, and.... okay, I&nbsp; know I had&nbsp; blueberries later on that night as a snack, but I can NOT&nbsp; remember what I had between when I got home from work and the blueberries. I&nbsp; clearly remember that Rick had something to each which wasn't what I had&nbsp; eaten, because I remember wanting him to hurry up and finish his dinner so&nbsp; that we could go to the library. Dammit, why can't I remember?! I've&nbsp; literally been sitting here for the past 20 minutes trying to remember.&nbsp; Grrr.... I went for a walk, and did some more stretching and weight lifting.&nbsp; Btw, my situps scare the bejeezus out of my cats because they can't figure&nbsp;out why I'm lying on the ground. :)   Tuesday - to spice it up, I had a banana/raspberry/blueberry smoothey for&nbsp; breakfast, had a baked potato w/ sour cream for lunch, and had two&nbsp; tortilla/creamcheese pinwheels for dinner, with some baked fish (minced&nbsp; something or other) and half a cantalope. I had a wanger of a headache&nbsp; (probably from the funky weather we've been having) so I didn't do much but&nbsp;read and play with kittens (they're going back to the shelter in 3 days! :( )   I'm getting a little bored with the shakes and tuna for lunch, so its time&nbsp; to start mixing up my breakfasts and lunches. Rick has been really&nbsp; supportive, in as much as he lets me cook my own dinners (rather than for&nbsp; both of us) and he does the dishes. :)

           Hey ladies. Well, yesterday was good. Breakfast was a granola bar, lunch was a shake and an apple, I didn’t have a snack (bad bad,) dinner was more fish in veggie sauce with some “Chinese Vegetables” Then I tried to make a smoothie with a hand mixer instead of a blender. DISASTER. I still ate the mush I created (raspberries, strawberries, milk and some sweetener,) but it really wasn’t the same. Later on I had (1%) cottage cheese and melba toast for a snack. Also, NO COFFEE yesterday, I had tea instead.         I had to clean all the bunny and rat cages, so by the time I ate and digested it was raining, and I didn’t know what to do for a workout. I hadn’t done any cardio since Saturday, so I really had to get moving. I ended up going for an hour long run/walk in the rain. I’ll probably catch my death of cold, but it was actually kind of fun. I was able to run a lot further than I thought. The burning in my calves would cause me to stop, but hopefully that will improve as I build some muscle there. This is a big step for me; I have had asthma since I was a kid, so running is the one activity I have grown up REALLY hating, and avoiding at all costs. Maybe someday I’ll be able to go for a jog and not have to walk at all.      &nbsp;            Just so you guys know, I want to keep this up until I have lost all the weight – at least 20 lbs. I would like to achieve that by Christmas, and I think that’s possible. That would mean losing 4lbs a month for 5 months, and I really think I can do that. I will keep using this blog, and hopefully I will have some company. Ryan has been informed that if I am successful, he will be getting me a string bikini for Christmas which I will be wearing everywhere we go. “Hey mom and dad…”        A little bit of motivation – 99% of successful dieters claim the first two weeks are the hardest part – nd we’re more than halfway through them!&nbsp;

      Well Ladies,&nbsp; last night I faced evil and won!&nbsp; Nick's roommate order pizza.&nbsp; Before it arrived I was stressing out hard core.&nbsp; I thought I was going to cave and mow down on pizza.&nbsp; I told Nick not to let me have any.&nbsp; The pizza arrived and all I had was the crust of two slices!&nbsp; I know it's not an entire success, but it's half way!&nbsp;   I didn't make the gym last night unfortunately - movie started at 7 so raced there after work then&nbsp; spent the night sewing.   Today has been good so far.&nbsp; Grapes and granola bar for breakfast.&nbsp; Thai chicken skewers for lunch (@ new thai restaurant in the AMC complex) with rice and spring roll.&nbsp; I'm eating some almonds as we speak right now for a snack.&nbsp; Dinner I plan on salad and stirfried veggies.

           Hi! Well, yesterday was pretty good for me. I had a coffee for breakfast, uhh a shake, some melba toast, and some grapes and strawberries for lunch, and an apple for a snack. For dinner I had Boston Bluefish (really cheap fish) baked in a sauce I made from canned, diced tomatoes, some green beans, red peppers and onions, and salt and pepper. It was really good, although I made it a little too spicy. With that, I had half a cob of corn, half a potato, and some salad. &nbsp;  Later, for a snack I had some melba toast, lite cottage cheese, and some grapes.&nbsp;       I  &nbsp;drank MORE than 8 glasses of water yesterday, took my multivitamin, and did 20 minutes of random muscle work with one of those big elastic bands. Ask me to demonstrate what I have dubbed the “Really Painful Outer Thigh and Butt Exercise” haha. No seriously, it’s hot.          I     also heard (try this at your own risk, because I haven’t tested) a recipe for fat free, carb free mashed potatoes. Sounds ridiculous, no? Well, apparently, it’s because instead of potatoes you use cooked CAULIFLOWER. My friend said it tastes EXACTLY like mashed potatoes. Apparently you put cooked cauliflower, butter-flavoured cooking spray (which sounds narsty, I’d use margarine,) skim milk and salt and pepper in a blender and go nuts. It sounds gross, but maybe I’ll try it sometime this week.         Also, I found this:   urlLink  http://www.timhortons.com/english/images/CanNutritionGuideE.pdf             It lists the calories in everything at Tim Hortons. A medium one cream one sugar coffee contains 78 calories, so I’m assuming a large double double is at least 4 times that....Yeah, 312, that's about what I thought.         Happy reading, and don’t quit! You’re doing great. Harshala, where is your post girl??

      Well ladies,   First off would like to thank you for not letting me have ice cream.&nbsp; And wanted to express my disappointment in Andrew and Bryan.&nbsp; Their lack of support is disheartening considering they should both be doing this as well.&nbsp; Let's keep them out of it as much as possible.   My week was quite successful and I was proud of myself.&nbsp; I made good snaking options - fruit, cheese, veggies.&nbsp; This weekend however was a complete disaster.&nbsp; I had way to much to drink on Friday night (didn't eat to much bad stuff except the chocolate cupcake) but Saturday was a write off.&nbsp; Started with McDonalds breakfast to try and cure the upset stomach, ended in chips and licorice!&nbsp; Sunday was better, stirfry for dinner and thin crust pizza for lunch.&nbsp;   I've really taken your dedication and motivation to heart especially what Heather's man said.&nbsp; I'm not going to do all this work this month and have it not result in anything.&nbsp; So this week I'm going to be focused.&nbsp; I had bran flakes for breakfast, today I had salad and calamari for lunch.&nbsp; I'll be having a light dinner - probably more salad with some almonds and fruit for snack.&nbsp;   I'm going to go for a run after work as well.&nbsp; This is my week to really do well.&nbsp; I'm counting on you all to help me through it!&nbsp;   My Workout Plan:   Today 30 minute run  Tomorrow: 30 minute run or eliptical and 30 min weights  Wednesday: 30 minute bike or run and 30 min weights  Friday: 30 minutes of ? 30 minute weights  Saturday: 30 minute cardio - perhaps hike?&nbsp;   After a disastrous weekend I'm really looking forward to proving myself this week.&nbsp; I know I can do it.&nbsp; It's just a matter of reminding myself when I see something I shouldn't eat that it will not only add fat to my diet but it very unhealthy in other ways (preservatives etc).&nbsp;   Ok girls....here I go!

      Alright, folks... its been 7 days.   To recap my weekend:   Friday - I didn't have ice cream, nor, quite frankly, was I really tempted after hearing Bryan and Andrew snicker about which one of us was going to cave first. (That's why we had to speak up, Kate! I'm sorry!) I had a couple of fat-free oreos on the way home and had a pre-cooked skinless chicken breast with some corn chutney before the game. We lost the game, but I did run around the bases at least once when Rick hit a homerun! After the game, we went to Lone Star and I had 3 steak fajitas, light on the sour cream and cheese. I didn't have chili (which I normally do) but I did take a couple of bites of Rick's garlic toast and I had a virgin raspberry margarita (no sugar rim). Its all about the compromise, folks!   Saturday - I had a sushi lunch (c'mon, can you get more low fat that fish and a little rice?), but I had prime rib for dinner. I made sure to have the leanest cut I could get, though and I had a big bowl of swiss chard from my garden (Yay! I'm starting to harvest veggies!). I didn't even have any snack... hmm... I did better that day than I thought! I forgot my vitamin, though... but I did some walking and gardening, which got me out of the house.   Sunday - oops, I had bacon and eggs for breakfast. But, I only had 3 strips of bacon, burnt to a crisp so there wasn't much fat left on it, and brown toast. I had coffee, but only with 1 cream, and I ate my tomatoes on the side, instead of the hashbrowns. Plus a big glass of OJ. While I was cooking dinner that night, I had a flatbread with spinach cream cheese as a snack (I hadn't had anything to eat since breakfast). For dinner, I had two beef souvlaki skewers, seasoned rice and sliced tomatoes for dinner, with some sour cream. Again, no snacking. I didn't get out to exercise, although I did go up and down the stairs in my house about two dozen times doing laundry, plus lifting weights, stretching, and doing all of 11 sit ups.   So, in retrospect, how did I do? I'll give myself a "B". I didn't exercise as much as I wanted, but my eating was pretty good, and I managed the stretching and vitamin 6 out of 7 days. I pretty much avoided junk food, and when I DID go out to eat, I compromised between what I really wanted and what was good for me. I'm not sure that my weigh-in tomorrow is going to be great, but its a good start.

           Yesterday was fine, I suppose. I had two hard boiled eggs for brunch, ummm some melba toast…some random fruit I think, I can’t really remember.            Then I had a coffee. I didn’t eat anything else until supper time. I had some strawberries and raspberries, and then chicken souvlaki with no bun, and some rice and tomatoes. I ate some more melba toast later and a piece of cheese. I did two pilates tapes back to back, so that makes for about 50 mins. of exercise. I did not, however, drink enough water. I woke up this morning with mega pasty mouth. Oh, and I should point out that late Saturday night I ate the stupid ice cream sandwich, AND some licorice. I do feel guilty, but it was so good.           I really beat myself up about it on Sunday, until I realized – that’s the only “junk food” that I had for an entire week! Even though I made little slip ups here and there, I am still proud of myself. I worked out five days this week, which is at least two more days than I would have without you guys. Thanks!          This week I have decided to replace the breakfast shake with a coffee (since I wasn’t eating breakfast before this) to cut out some calories. I also think I’m going to try and up the workout to at least an hour five days a week instead of half an hour. My new motivation is having to wear a bathing suit in front of coworkers in less than a month. (Camping trip.) No offense, but thank heavens Bryan isn’t going! He doesn't need to see my chubby thighs.        Hey, guess what!! My weekly weigh-in suggests I've lost 2 lbs!! Woo hoo!

      Well I should first congratulate Kate for resisting temptation to eat ice cream yday !!! Brave girl keep it up kate dont let Lynda defeat you !!!!!! We are all proud of you....  I&nbsp;have not yet cheated on&nbsp;my diet.... on my home scale I weigh 4 lbs less I am feeling great !!!!!!  I was talking to andrew yday he said if i have lost weight by this stupid diet than I should continue rather than stop and start and confuse my body I came home and told my hubby and brother surprisingly they agreed to that they said continue for couple more weeks until you feel you cant take it any more so by popular demand ladies you will see me cating Cabbage soup for next couple of weeks(hope not) or if I get tired I will skip the soup and continue rest of diet!!!(fruits ,veggies and banan,,,,,,,,, NO RICE AND FRIED FOOD AND POTATOES) No exercise today but I was doing laundry up and down to basement I dunno how many times , went shopping for about 3 hrs I hope I had some exercise there   &nbsp;

      Well, yesterday I resisted the ice cream, (thank you very much, Lynda,) only to be taken in by two oreos.&nbsp;Then, even though I had already eaten supper, I&nbsp;was hungry after the game, and ate chicken noodle soup and a salad. Not too bad, but after that I fell asleep so there wasn't really much of a workout yesterday.  Today, I didn't eat breakfast, had a shake for lunch, ate an apple, and then for dinner had tuna,&nbsp;(no mayo), salad, lite cottage cheese, and some melba toast. Then later I had some more melba toast and some grapes and strawberries. Unfortunately, after that, I again got taken in. By a square of leftover pizza. Still, all things considered, it could be MUCH worse. I squeezed in an hour long workout - Sweatin' to the Oldies,&nbsp;lol - and had no coffee.   However, my less than perfect feeling comes from the fact that today I went to buy a bathing suit, and had to buy it from the  plus sized section . That is the first time I have ever had to buy a plus sized anything, and it was not a good feeling. Up until now I've been holding out that I am the only one who sees my chub. Apparently the good people at Wal-Mart see it too.  My boyfriend called earlier from Blockbuster, and asked if he should get candy, and I had to remind him that I was on a diet for the millionth time. Now he just came in, and put an Oreo ice cream sandwich in front of me! He says "Oh go ahead, have it." GRRRR. I got this body by 'Oh, go ahead, have it.'  Hey, I made him put it away though. So help me, I will not eat that thing, even if it means I have to throw it off the balcony. Wish me luck...

      First of all, I have to say that I enjoy the fact that Harshala's last blog&nbsp;was from around midnight last night. If I'm not in bed by 11, I'm a grumpy girl the next day! Of course, the day long diet of bananas may have kept Harshala on a potassium high; who knows? ;)   I had the vitamin, shake breaky (Gemma would be proud of me using that word!), tuna salad lunch, and had a 6" whole wheat crab salad sub with tomatoes and chocolate milk for dinner; apparently it has 6 grams of fat or less, so that was a good choice. Is anyone else finding that they're less hungry? I think my stomach is getting smaller. I went to the batting cage with Ms. Switall as well, but kind of blew things when I had a Smirnoff Ice while watching Rick ump. I had some raspberries and cream cheese as a snack when I got home and did some weights and stretching before bed.   Tonight is going to be tough... we have a baseball game at 6:30 on the other side of town, which doesn't leave much time for something to eat before hand. And then, the team will want to go out for wings and drinks... willpower, don't fail me now! But playing ball is fun and since its the end of the month, I'm really too broke to party much anyways. :)   Heather; you're exactly right. It would suck if we put ourselves through drinking shakes and eating entire banana trees, only to lose out on this b/c you couldn't get your tush off the couch. When I was eyeing the foot long meatball sub last night, I thought "I've been doing really well today; I'm not going to ruin everything I've done b/c of a damn sub". I think the longer we go with eating well and exercising, the less likely we are to be tempted by Doritos and sitting on the couch b/c we've invested so much effort thus far.   How is everyone feeling about the weekend? Are you planning on getting some serious exercise in, or do you think its going to be hard following your diet when you're so much closer to your fridge all day?

      Hey hey. Well today was alright, I suppose.  I had a (chocolate!) shake for breakfast, grapes for a snack, another shake for lunch, as well as some salad with low fat ranch, and some various vegetables for a snack. I had NO COFFEE today, and I didn't even miss it. Then, however, Sharron and I went out right after work to go to the batting cage. By the time we got there, it was probably about 6:30 or so, and I was reeeeealy hungry. I should have known that was a bad idea. Normally I eat right when I get home, around 5:30. We did pretty well by going to Subway as opposed to McDonald's or something, but I had to go for the large sub. Brown bread, turkey, (no cheese or mayo,) just turkey, mustard, and veggies. That's not that bad, I suppose, but then when I got home I had about three handfuls of cheerios mix and some pickles. Could be&nbsp;much worse, but could be&nbsp;better.&nbsp;  I didn't drink 8 glasses of water today, I only had about 5 or 6, but I did get in the multivitamin. I went to the batting cage for a few rounds, and also walked for half an hour. I did it with a 3lb weight in each hand, which I was lifting the whole way. People look at you funny when you're walking down the road doing shoulder presses, but it was a lot more fun to do that than sitting in my apartment going 'I'm so bored!"   Now to get a bit rambly. I had a long talk with Ryan tonight (diabetic and 6-pack endowed,) and he said a couple of interesting things that I think I should share. One being that the sub bread alone probably contained about 300 calories (yikes) and also that I was right in cutting out the coffee. A direct quote: "If you're going to keep having cream in your coffee, you might as well pour it in a baggie and strap it to your thighs, because that's right where it will go." A little harsh, but he's right.  I then mentioned how pissed off I would be if I did this for a full month and didn't lose any weight, and he said, "Well then don't just sit around and wait for it to fall off." I pondered this for a minute, and realized that although it was the simplest concept ever, I had been missing it. Why aim for half hour workouts if I've got enough in me for hour long ones? Why go halfway? What am I waiting for? So although I've been doing OK for this past week (better than I've done the whole rest of my life,) I think it's time to up the ante. Why waste any time, you know? Better to go as hard as you can and see what happens than to fail because you only gave it half&nbsp;the effort that you were capable of.  I also want to say I think all of you are doing so well! Harshala, I can't believe you ate so many bananas, and you're doing so well with your midday exercise. And Kate, just remember that every little sacrifice puts you one step closer to your goal. Kudos on the lack of Doritos scarfing. Sharron, way to go on the 6 inch with no cheese. I know you're not a quitter at heart, so as long as you remember why this is important to you, I am certain you will succeed.   We rock!!

       Most Excellent! Ladies, if you log into your Blogger account for our&nbsp; blogsite, and go to Settings > Email, you can pick a secret name for your&nbsp; blogger address. (ie   urlLink  sharronhelpstar.SECRET@blogger.com   ). When you've saved your changes, you can then write emails to that address (like I did with this one!) which will be posted directly to the blog!

      First of all, I have to say that if I tried to run for 30 minutes I would most likely keel over, so awesome job, Kate! As well, kudos to Heather for the bike ride and to Harshala for stomaching bowl after bowl of cabbage soup!   I did the shake breakfast/tuna salad lunch thing again and was pretty hungry when I got home last night so I had some baked pita chips with salsa, a couple of baked fillets, and some green peas. I'm not sure that my 2 coffee/ 1 large chocolate milk each day is necessarily a good part of my diet, but I feel like I need the coffee and the chocolate milk is 1%, so my calcium needs are being well met. And since a high calcium intake reduces stress levels, I just can't get worked up over it (ba-doom ching!).   I again lifted weights last night (I've got jello arms this morning, so I know I did enough), and did some serious (aka painful) stretching. I've noticed that I sound like a bowl of Rice Crispies (snap, crackle, pop!) when I stretch. Hopefully, I'm heading to the batting cage tonight and may take a walk around Centennial Park while I'm at it. The nice thing about walking is that I can read while I'm doing it.

      Well Ladies you are going to be very proud of me!&nbsp; I had a healthy dinner of chicken and greek salad.&nbsp; Then my dad was eating chips and I didn't have any!&nbsp; Not one!&nbsp; This is a big accomplishment for me.&nbsp; Rarely do I refuse a deepfried potato!&nbsp;   As well I went to the gym today.&nbsp; I didn't get by weights done but I did run for 30 minutes.&nbsp; After 20 minutes I was about to give up (I just get so bored!) when I thought of the three of you and had to keep going.&nbsp; I even sprinted for a full minute at the end!&nbsp; So there you go.&nbsp; If it wasn't for you guys, I would of stopped at 20 minutes.&nbsp; Thank you.   Heather you seem to be doing really well on your diet.&nbsp; How about substituing the apple for strawberry's or raspberry's?&nbsp;   Ok I'm off to bed.&nbsp; Lates

      Howdy, y'all. (Western themed tonight, I'm so fun.) Well, day three has been just about as eventful as the last two. I had a shake for breakfast, an apple for a snack, another shake and some broccoli and cauliflower for lunch, another apple for my snack, and then the same chicken and potato for dinner. I mixed things up a little by trading beans for corn on the cob tonight though. Oooh ahh, ha ha. I also had some salad with my dinner, which I must say was a welcome addition. I love salad.&nbsp;I had a cup of this cheerios mix stuff tonight for a snack, which Mr. Label says contains about 162 calories. I gave in and had a coffee today though, bad bad. I'm sure there is a good 300 + calories in a large double-double you know. From now on, it's tea with milk and sweetener. Forget the food, the coffee will be the hardest sacrifice for me.  I am sure getting sick of apples though. I have changed up tomorrow's menu a little bit. Also, I did well for water and vitamin today, that makes 3 days in a row. That might be a record.   I even squeezed in TWO workouts today. I did pilates before work this morning - which was probably a waste of time because I was so sleepy and stiff - and went for an hour long bike ride&nbsp;tonight at a comfortable pace. I also returned my library books. That has nothing to do with this, but I'm just so proud, lol.  Does anyone else find they are thinking about food a lot? I constantly seem to be thinking about food or exercise or drinking water. I guess it's good so I won't forget, but my brain is tired.  Actually, I'm tired! Goodnight! And keep it up girls, everyone is doing so good. We passed hump day!  &nbsp;

      Well so far it's gone pretty well for me.&nbsp; I had steak for dinner last night (but ate the mashed potatoes as well...bad girl!)&nbsp; Today I had a subway turkey sandwhich - six inch, an apple and crakers and cheese for&nbsp;lunch with cereal for breakfast.&nbsp; I plan on have salad with chicken for dinner.&nbsp;   I've brought my gym bag with me to work, so I'm not going home until I spend 30 minutes on the elipitcal and 30 minutes lifting weight.&nbsp;   I can definatly say I was disappointed in my self last night when I ate all the mashed potatoes in front of me.&nbsp; I would like to work on my restraint a little more.&nbsp;   You all sound like you're doing really well on your diets.&nbsp; I'm going to step the notch up a little more, which means no more buttery mashed potatoes!&nbsp;   I also will have to get in three more workouts this week.&nbsp; One will be rollerblading, the other two will be the gym.&nbsp;   I know I'm going to get in trouble if I dont' get my four workouts in....so I'm motivated to get through them. ;)

        Alright, so Harshala scolded me into putting up my results from the first two days... she initially tried to get me to write about the first THREE days, until I pointed out that it was 9:10 in the morning of the third day and I really didn't have much to note as of yet.     So, I've done fairly well... nutrishakes for breakfast both days, tuna and crackers for lunch with a diet pop (cheap AND low in calories/fat), and a low-calorie salad for dinner (w/ grilled chicken on Monday, baked sole last night).   I was having a sweet craving like you would not believe last night, so I made myself a poor man's cheesecake - nuked some frozen raspberries with a few ounces of cream cheese, topped with sweetner and a couple of tbsp of crush cornflakes. Pretty tasty, if I do say so myself, high protein and fibre, too.   I went for a 20 minute walk on Monday night while the hubby was umpiring a baseball game and did 20 minutes of weight lifting last night. Plus 10 minutes of stretching each night and I remembered to take a multivitamin each morning. So far, I'm on track.   HOWEVER, Heather brought her scale in this morning and I weighted myself.. holy schamoley, I'm up to 250! ARGH! Heather, like a true friend, stuttered out something about the scale not being accurate, but I have to admit, I'm not feeling good bout this. Talk about a little bit of motivation. Hopefully, by this time next week, I can weight myself again and see some improvement.

      Boy oh boy, today sucked, haha. I was fine all day...I ate the same things as yesterday except no carrots, I had broccoli and cauliflower instead.   Well, all was well, until after dinner. I went to go swimming, and only got to go for half an hour, and for some reason that made me REALLY ANGRY.&nbsp;Like, run over Mother Theresa angry. I came home and started whining and bitching and all of a sudden it hit me..."I WANT COOKIES!!!" but I didn't eat any cookies.   I ate pickled onions, that didn't quelch it. I tried to eat (a small amount of) cheese, that didn't help. I finally calmed the beast by eating a low carb bun that was kicking around for some reason. I think I have some carb issues. I am no longer bitchy, and I no longer want cookies.&nbsp;Still, can't keep that up&nbsp;every day.  Now I am going to do some pilates to make up for my damn short swim. Grrrrrr.

      Well Ladies, this has been a long time coming for me.&nbsp; I'm really looking forward to doing this with all of you.&nbsp; To tell you a little bit about myself and my eating habits, I love junk food - chips, chocolate you name it.&nbsp; I like to eat large quantities of food as well - put a big bag of chips in front of me and I could easily go through the whole bag if that little voice in my head would just shut up!&nbsp; My weight tends to fluctuate by 5-10 lbs.&nbsp; I will go on a diet and lose weight then gain it back.&nbsp; Before I went to University I weighed 155lbs, in third year I weighed 175lbs.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to get back to 155lb by the end of October.&nbsp;  &nbsp; So my stats are:  &nbsp; Height: 5'7 Weight: 167 Waist: 35 Hips: 42 Thunder Thighs: 25 Arms: 12 Ribcage: 33 Boobies: 38 &nbsp; &nbsp; My goal for the end of this month is to lose 6lbs.&nbsp; I plan to control the amount of junk food I eat, and incorporate more meat into my diet.&nbsp; I don't eat a lot of meat and that leads me to more carbs.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to reduce the amount of carbs I eat b/c I&nbsp;feel that it just sticks to my&nbsp;already big&nbsp;bones. &nbsp;I still need to have some carbs - because we all know what happens when you don't eat any (thanks to Heather's graphic discribtions) and because I love them so much I could never fully give them up.&nbsp; So my plan is to have carbs for one meal plus one snack.&nbsp; And by carbs I mean bad carbs - bread, pasta, rice.&nbsp;  &nbsp; As for my excersise routine I plan to up the now two times a week to four.&nbsp; This will include a 30 min run or elipitcal and 30 minutes of weight lifting.&nbsp; I get very bored of the gym so I will try to run outside more.&nbsp; Also with my new found love/hate for mountain biking I'm going to try and get out more on the hills.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Well that's it for me.&nbsp; Let's get this party started (expect no pop&nbsp;and chips allowed!)

      I think I did pretty well yesterday... &nbsp; Breakfast - Slimfast &nbsp; Lunch- Slimfast, one ziplog baggie of carrots and broccoli, an apple &nbsp; Snack- Another apple &nbsp; Dinner- I COOKED! Chicken breast baked in a tomato-vegetable sauce, a potato (basically boiled) and canned green beans, because I have an unholy obsession with canned green beans. &nbsp; Snack- Several pickled onions...unfortunately they made my tummy hurt because I ate them right before bed &nbsp; Here is the best part, I made enough chicken to last the whole week (although Ryan ate Friday on me...) so that I don't have to cook. I rock, I tell you. I also got in the 8 glasses of water yesterday, AND the multivitamin. &nbsp; I shirked out on working out because by the time I ate it was almost 9, and then I was full of food and sleepy. But I still have 6 more days to work in those 5 workouts. I think it's apparent what could hold me back, eh?

        Alright, I already put this in my profile, in the hopes that hiding it away on another page meant that no one would have to see, but apparently, you've all decided to air your stats, so I'm stepping up to the plate!     My measurements, in inches:     Chest - 46 (Lucky Rick!)     Waist - 42     Hips - 51 (oh god)     Thigh - 30     Arm - 14     Ribcage - 39      I THINK my weight is somewhere around 245, but without a scale, I don't really know. I'll wander back to the Development area sometime today and get a firm number... well, its more of a flabby number, I suppose. :P     My Goals  - Lose 6-8 lbs and get at least one double in a game this year. This would require me to either hit the ball a lot further than I've been doing (which means I have to work on strength) or run about 30% faster (which means I have to work on running and losing some mass).     My Plan  - generally eat smaller portions (I'm a big eater, no pun intended), drink slimfast for breakfast instead of eating bagels, take a multivitamin each day, and avoid post-baseball game binges (Wings and Smirnoff, oh, how I'll miss you!).  &nbsp;  In terms of exercise, I'm going to hit the diamond for some base running and fielding practice at least twice a week, go to the batting cage at least once a week, throw the ball around and walk around the neighborhood with Rick on my off days, and get back into weights. I'll also stretch every day for at least 10 minutes, hoping to be able to do the splits again by my birthday.   Along with my playing baseball once a week. I think that's a pretty moderate exercise scheme. I've got the advantage, too, that Rick is joining me on this little adventure. I find I have no motivation to workout unless I'm doing something fun, so the majority of my exercise will be in the form of baseball practice or maybe volleyball. Speaking of : I would like to see us get a HeppStaw Volleyball Night or two going this month as well!

      Hey folks! Well my name is Heather and I am a fellow HeppSTAWian&nbsp;and fellow chubbo, haha. I guess I should tell you a little about myself.  &nbsp;  I stand 5'9", and weigh 180 lbs.&nbsp;I would eventually like to get down to 165 - a weight I haven't seen since I was about 16. I am currently only 21, haha. I don't have any lofty ambitions of being a size 6 or anything, since, when I was a skinny-as-a-rake 14 year old, I was wearing a ladies size 8. I have a big frame, and underneath my protective coat of flab, a lot of muscle. (Seriously!) I currently wear between size 13 and size 15.  &nbsp;  Here are my current measurements:  Waist: 36"  Hips:&nbsp;&nbsp; 43.5"  Ribs:&nbsp;&nbsp; 34.5"  Tatas:&nbsp; 39"  Thighs: 26" (EACH!!)  Upper Arms: 13"  &nbsp;  I intend to take off 5-7 lbs this month, and hopefully 1-2 inches around my waist. My plan includes a low calorie diet, (including SlimFast because I'm lazy,) and LOTS of working out - 5 times a week for at least half an&nbsp;hour. Three times a week hasn't been doing&nbsp;as much as I'd like. I don't want to cut carbs, but I do intend to cut sugar out almost completely.  &nbsp;  My workouts will include pilates, swimming, walking, biking, rollerblading, softball (if that counts,) and excessive groaning.  &nbsp;  I'm not looking forward to this,&nbsp;but here goes...something!  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

       Alright, so as far as I can remember, the rules are simply : no drugs, and no dangerous fasting. If there was something else, add it as a comment.  &nbsp;  To begin, each person needs to take her following measurements:  - Waist  - Hips  - Thigh  - Arm  - Ribcage (Rib Cage? One word? Meh...)  -&nbsp;Chest (aka tatas, bongles, fun bags, lady berries, etc)  &nbsp;  As well as her starting weight.  &nbsp;  The fun begins Monday, July 19th!

       Welcome, HeppSTAWians! I hope that this Blogger format is going to work for everyone. It has the benefits of being updateable from anywhere, including your cubicle, when work is slow.&nbsp;;)   &nbsp;   For those of you who are new to blogs, blog is a contraction for "web log". Since we're (hopefully) logging our weight and/or inches lost over the next few weeks, it was an easy choice!     &nbsp;   I'll write more later on our "rules" and be the first to enter my stats and goals. But right now, I have a couple of kittens chewing on my toes, so that's it for me!   &nbsp;   Oh, and since I'm "pear-shaped"....      urlLink

           Let’s see if I can remember what I ate. Friday same breakfast and lunch. I went home and had some tuna and cottage cheese for dinner, then maybe a yogurt or something. Then while watching the game I had a few drinks of the alcoholic variety. Empty calories, I know. That was it until I went to bed I think.                   Saturday, started off with melba toast (I’m addicted) then probably a yogurt, um I can’t remember if I ate anything between then and dinner. If I did it was melba toast, guaranteed. Then I had salad, 6 chicken nuggets (baked but still terrible) and rice for dinner. I ended up snacking on more melba toast after dinner and maybe some mushrooms? I also had a coffee later on that night. Oh, and I think I had some orange sorbet that day.                   Sunday, more melba toast, some salad, a few mushrooms, and then I had a Mr. Sub turkey wrap for dinner. It was really good but I was hungry about half an hour later. I also had a yogurt after supper, some veggies, and melba toast I think, then some orange sorbet at bed time. Good grief, I’ve really god to kick the melba habit, don’t I? It’s a good thing I didn’t try to do low carb.                  I just weight myself before lunch, and I am proud to say that I actually HAVE lost some girth. To date, I have lost 6 pounds! I'm as surprised as anyone. Also, I've lost up to a half inch off my waist, (this one comes and goes depending on the time of day) ½ inch off each thigh, ½ inch from around my ribs, between ½ and a full inch from around my hips, and the same from around the tatas. (Damnit.) The only measurement that hasn’t moved is my upper arms, but I guess they can wait. I was almost certain I was imagining things getting smaller, but apparently not. Not too shabby.         G      uess what else? FOUR DAYS LEFT!!!

Well it looks like I temporarily forgot the plan as well. I had the usual for breakfast and lunch, but then for dinner I was like, you know what, I really want a sub. So I ended up having a sub. (Guess what kind, haha.) Large turkey on brown with mustard and veggies, no cheese. Of course, I got the chips for Ryan, but he didn&#8217;t want them so&#8230;I ate them. Sunchips, but still. If Mr. Sub&#8217;s nutrition information is accurate, my meal (including the yogurt I had after) was at least 800 calories last night. Yikes. Oh well, it was damn tasty. I went to the gym as well for 30 minutes on the treadmill, but I walked most of the time so I doubt I really did much good. Tonight I&#8217;m going to the doctor after work, so I won&#8217;t be able to go to the gym. Looks like I&#8217;ll have to actually get outside tonight and enjoy this beautiful summer day, haha. Remember when August used to be HOT?             &nbsp;

      Failure, thy name is DONUT.  Breakfast : omrg, 2 peanut butter cookies Lunch : Bacon Mushroom Melt Dinner : barbequed chicken and red peppers  Snack : Oh ladies... judge me not.... Rick and I went up to the Heartland in Mississauga to go to the Best Buy... I resisted when he said "Lets go to Baskin Robbins", but then we drove past the Krispy Kreme... and the "HOT" light was one... and then... *sob*  I had not ONE,  not TWO,  but THREE Krispy Kreme donuts!!!  Its not entirely my fault... I only asked for one, but they gave me two "samplers" as well. Sweet, sweet, sugary goodness, it was tasty.  Sad, sad day.

       Holy crap guys...hang in there....less than a week to go! Less than a week to meet those goals! Make these last few days count!!     Well, today it was back to basics for me. Two shakes, fruit for snacks. Fish for supper again. (It was a new kind today and was actually quite nasty. I'm not looking forward to eating the end of it tomorrow.) I did cave and have a coffee today however. Snack was a Danon Mousse yogurt and oh my lord it might be my new favourite food. Incredibly dessert-like, and only 70 calories. Um yeah so was my snack. Oh yeah, i almost forgot I had one chicken nugget since they came from Chez Sharron and I didn't know if they were gross. I liked them, lol.       I also got some herbal tea tonight (Sharron stop laughing) because Elisa always used to drink it and it smelled so good, but I couldn't bring myself to try it. So I was finally like screw it, it's only 1.97 if I hate it. I loved it though. I am going to start bringing it to work to help kick the afternoon coffee habit.      What else...I hit the gym tonight for 35 mins on the eliptical. I upped my gym coolness factor by very nearly having an asthma attack, and by walking into a treadmill. Oh yeah, I rule that place. Hopefully tomorrow will be less painful! Wow, I can't believe tomorrow is Thursday already. Feels like this week just got started...

Dinner - small portion of roast beef, carrots, peas Snack - almost a full quart of blueberries (mmmmm) and some yogurt Exercise - 1/2 hour of stretching, sit ups, and arm weights.

I did the 2 shakes fruit and veggies during the day &#8211; except for the ice cream Lynda brought! Then for dinner I had more fish with beans and rice, and salad. (I was starving yesterday.) After dinner I had some sorbet, then a few spudz later, then 2 packages of melba toast! I was so hungry, I just couldn&#8217;t stop eating. I didn&#8217;t work out, as my body is still fighting back from my ab workout on Sunday, but I did get in some quality relaxing time. I am going to el gym tonight though.

      Well the weekend was a disaster - beer, corn dogs, icecream. But I've started the week off well. Yesterday I had branflakes and rainsins for breakfast, chicken pita for lunch and veggies for dinner.  So far so good for today. Breakfast: 1/4 cantelope Snack: 1 cup brank flakes no milk Lunch: Salad with chicken and low fat Italian dressing Snack: peanut butter and almonds and icecream Dinner: Burger with half bun and also had Mr. Noodles Snack: homemade coleslaw  Exercise: 30 minutes of upper body weight lifting

       Wow is all I have to say about yesterday. I started the breakfast shake again, and it's true, I did feel much less hungry later in the day. I had grapes and an apple for snacks, and raw veggies with my lunch. For dinner (when I finally at at like, 9,) I had fish baked in tomato, red pepper, corn sauce. Yeah, I pretty much cook by throwing all the things I like together in a pan and seeing what comes out. After dinner I had a few spudz sticks and a few honeycomb. Mmm honeycomb. (The cereal, I don't keep bees.)      But my wow yesterday comes from what happened at the gym. So, as it was Monday and EVERYONE works out on Monday, I didn't get on an eliptical cause they were all full. So I hopped on ye olde treadmille and started to walk. Usually I walk for about five minutes and jog for  maybe  two, and alternate. (Yes, I'm that out of shape.) Well, I walked for just over two minutes, and then jogged for a full ten minutes. I'm not even kidding. I wasn't even out of breath, I just had to slow down because I got this funny pain in my back. (I'm assuming it was my lungs going "WHAT THE HELL??" Then I walked for a few more minutes, and then jogged for another...8 or 9 I think...I even ran for the last 3 minutes flat out. This might not sound like much for anyone else, but for me that's the equivalent of the New York City marathon. You know what else? I LIKED it. I wasn't going very fast, mind you, but it was still more than I have ever been able to do before. I could see myself becoming a serious gym rat soon, folks.

      I think I have mild dyslexia - I nearly emailed this to my "glob". :P  Alright... Friday Breakfast - um, I think I missed breakfast Lunch - Wendy's kids meal, but without the mandarin orange slices (they gave me fries by mistake and I did NOT eat them!) Dinner - 1/2 skewer of souvlaki (I wasn't hungry for some reason) Snack - raspberry sorbet  Saturday Lunch (who eats breakfast on weekends?) - sushi with miso soup and salad Dinner - Steak, swiss chard, red peppers Snack - raspberry sorbet and mango  Sunday Lunch - 2 bacon, 2 sausage, 2 pancakes (with butter and syrup), 1 scrambed egg, 1 peice of brown toast with jam, coffee, orange juice, AND A BIG TUMMY ACHE! Dinner - a little roasted chicken, rice, broccoli (from my garden!) Snack - raspberry sorbet and cantalope  You'll notice that I didn't put down any exercise... that would be because I really didn't do nything that would count as exercise except maybe going up and down the stairs at the library. I even went so far as to rent some exercise videos... but then when I got home, I found out that the cables to connect the VCR to the TV were still packed away in the basement and I was too lazy to go downstairs. :D I heartily deserve smacks, and I know it, but I'll get back on board tonight.

       Hey hey. Well, this weekend was a pretty big write-off for me. Although today I was able to get in my fifth workout (30 mins cardio and 20 mins abs and weights,) I also ate crap all weekend. Saturday I had a Wendy's salad for lunch, but I got the one that comes with the chicken strips. Then, I ate a whole lot of peanuts because for some dumb reason I bought a big bag of them bulk.  My dinner was healthy at least, salad, chicken, potato and corn, but then after dinner I think I ate a fruit to go, some sorbet, and then I went to see a movie and ended up eating some of Ryan's nibs. Not a great day overall. I was determined to make today better. I started off by eating melba toast, then umm...some more peanuts...then I had a few spudz sticks, which aren't that bad, but for dinner I had spaghetti. With salad, but still, carb nightmare. Then just now I ate about 1000 peanuts while watching this movie. I drank a lot of water with them too so I'm feeling incredibly, disgustingly bloated. Also, I have to take my inhaler. Peanuts always make me kinda wheezy...probably should stop eating them but they're soo good....lol.      Anyways, so yeah, totally blew the weekend, but what can you do. I am surprised I have gone this far without spaghetti. This week, I think I'm going back to the first week's plan of two shakes, three snacks, one meal. I seemed to snack less when I was eating breakfast, so I'll try that and see how it goes. Five workouts seems to be working for me, so I'm going to try and keep that up. Here is something interesting: The scale at the gym, the slidey one, says that I weigh at least 5 lbs less than mine does. It actually says I'm less than 170, which is shocking since I haven't seen that weight since I was like 16. It also says I've lost a pound this week, so I'm hoping that's consistent with mine ;) See you all tomorrow.

       Hey ladies! Well I don't think I did anything special foodwise on Thursday other than ate a bagel for supper instead of having something better. When I got home from baseball Ryan made me eat a handful of popcorn and a homemade muffin. (haha, made.) But I managed to get to the gym for a half an hour, so it's all good.      Friday I forgot to make my lunch, so I ended up having the spinach salad from Wendy's. That one's my favourite. (With low fat dressing, of course.) Then I had some fruit at the meeting. I went to the gym for 30 mins of cardio after work, and ended up doing a few chest exercises and some leg presses. Then some sweaty guy tried to chat me up, so I left. I had a sub for dinner, 12 inch turkey on brown with no cheese, just mustard and veggies, but I also had a bag of sunchips. 250 calories, but except for the cake I'd been good all week.       Today I am going to do some errands, so I'm not sure if I will work out or not. I am feeling good about the weigh-in on Monday. Anyways, off to do groceries and buy a not-so-ugly sweater, much to Sharron's delight I'm sure :P

      Breakfast - Shake Lunch - Wendy's Kids Meal! 4 chicken nuggets (180 calories, but pretty tasty), mandarine orange slices and chocolate milk - for $4! Dinner - 1/2 chicken dinner with veggies from Swiss Chalet (aka, the Hauer Special) ;) Snack - raspberry yogurt smoothey  Exercise - 2 baseball games. And.... *drum roll*.... I got my double!!! The guys in our league play girls shallow, so I smacked it over the outfielder's head and took off... I knew I was going to make second base before I even rounded first, because I was hustling. As a matter of fact, I spent a lot of time running the bases because I went 4 for 6 with 2 walks (Yay!), but I also think that I ran a lot better than I have all year... proof positive that something is working here. At first I though "I'm having frenchfries to celebrate, man!" but instead, I found its motivated me to stick with the plan. :)

       Where do the days go?? Well, yesterday, let me see if I can remember what I ate...no breakfast, but I was REALLY hungry so I had a plum and an apple around 10:30, lunch was shake and veggies and a COFFEE. I know, I know, but I was sooo tired. I also had a whole wheat bagel with nothing on it around 4 because for some reason I was super hungry yesterday, and I knew if I went to the gym without eating I would probably pass out. For dinner I had tuna, cottage cheese and raw veggies, then later on I had a bit of sorbet and a fruit to go.      I did get to the gym, and managed to do 30 minutes on the recumbant bike and 30 minutes on the eliptical trainer. I didn't do any weights because I am still a little intimidated by the weight room. (I don't know what the hell I'm doing; the machines have no instructions on them.) Someday soon I'll go workout with Ryan and he can show me what they are all for.   Today I might go to the gym between work and baseball, I haven't decided yet. It is a double header though, so I won't have much time to eat if I do that. Ah well, I might just do it anyway.       Harshala, I feel your pain about the bathing suit, but I find if I go swimming with a swim cap and goggles on, 1) I feel like I'm in a disguise and no one will recognize me anyway, 2) I look so stupid from the neck up that no one is looking at my body!       Also, I retract my statment about the inches lost. I measured again yesterday and it was back up to the old number, lol. I must have been sucking in. Still, I am now able to get into the shorts that were WAY too tight a few weeks ago. With room to spare! Hurray!

      Breakfast - shake Lunch - a couple of slices of watermelon, chicken breast (no skin), some almonds Dinner - lightly buttered pumpernickle bun, corn, baked fish (NOT the deep fried fish and chips I really wanted!) Snack - raspberry yogurt smoothey Exercise - nothing, nada, zip, zero, zilch  Alright, so my plan of going out to batting practice or throwing the ball around every night has been seriously curtailed by the fact that Rick's been umpiring 2-3 nights a week, but then I'm not exactly motivating myself to get going with something else, either. Fortunately, I've been very good with what I'm eating, so at least I'm not ADDING to the size of my posterior. :P

      Holy crap am I ever sore! After sitting down for an hour, I get up and feel like an idiot walking with my legs so stiff. My upper body is killing me as well, but I don't walk on my arms....but maybe I'll start considering it. It's a good feeling though, knowing that I'm sore from my lunch time work outs. I took a break today. Decided to treat myself to some sushi and miso soup. I'll be back at the gym during lunch tomorrow though. They are really working for me. It gives me an excuse to leave the office and gives me more energy for the rest of the day.  So food for today:  Breakfast: Multigrain bagel Lunch: Sushi, and miso soup Dinner: Small pizza with wild mushrooms and tomatoes, but had to have the choloate cake for dessert.  Went to Wolf Gang Puck's accross the street.  Not bad - but a little expensive.  Excersise: NONE!

       Hey hey. Well Monday I never did exercise, but food wise I did fine, same meals, a few rice chips as a snack, and I did OK yesterday too. I went out to dinner with my family, and ordered salmon. No appetizer, no alcohol. But then.... dessert.  Oh dear god. I don't know why I ordered it, I didn't really want it, but for some reason, eating chocolate mousse cake seemed like an easy way to make the family time pass, lol.  It even had whipped cream with it guys, and I ate every last bite. I tried to make up for it by going to the gym, but somehow I don't think half an hour on the eliptical burned that bugger off. After I ate it, I was like, "why did I even do that, I feel gross and bloated." Lesson learned, I guess.      So today I'm going to the gym again, and I'm going to try and get some weights in as well. I'm so tired though, that I might not want to stay that long.       This has nothing to do with this, but I would like to point out how irritated I am at the fact that there is no hot water in my building again today for the SECOND day in a row. I had to bathe with boiled water like some sort of pioneer. Note to self, shower at the gym tonight.

      OMG, I'm sore this morning. I just sneezed and I think I may have given myself a hernia.  Breakfast - banana/raspberry smoothey Lunch - some almonds Dinner - 2 wee little skewers of pork souvlaki, 1 roasted red pepper Snack - blueberries, watermelon  Exercise - well, in keeping with our whole "two weeks in, time to put the pressure on!" attitude, I did 30 minutes of elliptical AND 20 minutes of stretching AND 30 minutes of weight lifting AND crunches. I figure, if I'm going to watch The House Doctor, That 70's Show, Friends, Fear Factor, Body Work, AND CSI Miami, I should at least make it worthwhile. :D

      I'm writing today's post as the day goes on, because I find I forget what I've eaten. Writing this down is more for my benefit so I can keep track of what I'm eating, but it's also for you make any suggestions etc. If I like the way this goes, I'll do it everyday.  Breakfast: banana  Snack: Almonds and peanut butter - random I know...but that's what happens when you don't pack a lunch - what ever is left over from friday looks good! Lunch: Greek Salad, two handfuls of organic corn chips with avacado spread.    Snack: Two more handfuls of corn chips, 1/4 Cantalope   Dinner: Chicken with salad, TCBY Yogurt for dessert, Nectarine for snack     Exercise: 30 minutes of weights during lunch

      Well, it would seem that things are still percolating along nicely. I did have chicken last night for supper, with some corn and a potato. I had some orange sorbet afterwards, and damn was it good. You know what's neat? I don't really feel like I'm dieting. I just feel like I'm eating more normally. Meals instead of random food that I grab.  Also, the weekly weigh-in results suggest that I have lost more weight! Between one to two pounds. I can't believe it, I hardly exercised at all this week. Also, here is something REALLY neat....I thought my stomach has been getting flatter, so just for shits and giggles I measured.  Unless I'm measuring differently than I was before, I have already almost lost an inch from my waistline. I doubt all of that is fat loss, some of it can probably be chalked up to the random bloating and shrinking that women go through, but still, that's impressive. I think I've also lost almost half an inch from each upper arm as well. I didn't measure anything else, but my pants are fitting better all over. If I keep it up, I might just surpass my own expectations, and frankly, that would be GREAT. Talk about motivation.  So the plan this week is not going to be as ambitious as last week. I think I should stick to aiming for at least half an hour five times a week. Basically that means trying to do something almost every day. I am going to the gym tonight. I plan on doing 30 minutes of cardio, and hopefully 30 minutes on the weight machines if I can figure out how to use them!  I hope everyone is as excited as me to keep going!

      Hello Girls,  Well my weekend was better than last...that's forsure!  Saturday I played golf, then went shopping.  Lots of excercise there!  Eat fairly well except for the new york fries that I HAD to have!  For dinner I had roast beef and veggies.  On Sunday I cleaned the house from top to bottom and went roller blading for two hours.  I did have a hot dog and ice cream though!   I'm thinking along the same lines as Heather...if I want to met my goals I need step it up a little bit.  I feel on average the way I have been eating has improved.  I'm really starting to eat a heathly diet.  Keep in mind I need to have icecream and hot dogs once and a while otherwise I will go insane!  I'd like to work out more than I do.  I got my four work outs in last week and I'll try for that again this week.

       Oh boy, what happened to my exercise plan? Well Friday I had the same breakfast and lunch as always, no snacks again, then I had the same supper as Sharron, lol. I didn't work out because I was still feeling lazy and sick. Then yesterday I slept in till like, noon, ate a stale bun at some point, then had a gross burger king chicken salad for lunch, some melba toast for a snack, and then lemon pepper salmon for supper. Mmm so good. Just the fish, this tomato saucey stuff, some grilled veggies, and a baked potato with margarine. I didn't work out yesterday either, but I was up hanging out outside until like 4am, so hopefully that burned a few calories.      So far today all I have eaten is some cottage cheese and a fruit to go. I plan on having chicken, a potato and some sort of vegetable for supper, and maybe I'll go for a walk. I'm feeling better, but I'm really tired. Wonder why, lol.      I finally bit the bullet and signed up for a gym today. I now have access to all City of Mississauga community center gyms and pools. I think it's going to be good. I will prefer working out with old people than muscleheads, lol. I am really going to have to step up to the plate if I want to make my goal....there are only 19 days left!

      Yay, Harshala! I know a lot of the time I don't feel like writing in this blog, but I know if I don't, I'll lose track of how things are going. I love reading what you guys write, though... keeps me motivated. Keep it up, ladies! We're almost half way through!  Friday - breakfast: corn flakes and blueberries, lunch : a few cashews (I slept my lunch in the park!), dinner : 1 and 1/2 pork chop with tomatoes and broccoli, snack - raspberry sorbet. Exercise - busting a gut laughing. "Jello Pudding Cups!"  Saturday - lunch: cup of chili, 2 beef fajitas, light on the sourcream/cheese, dinner: clamchowder and garlic bread (yikes!). Exercise - parked at the far end of the Woodbine Racetrack parking lot (Casey would be proud of me :P) which is one hell of a walk and earned us some funny looks from the security guards, and walked around Port Credit for a halfhour, looking for a decent place to eat.  BTW: Premier Fitness is having a deal right now where you can get a 3-month membership for $89! I think Rick and I are going to check it out b/c they have an olympic size swimming pool at the one near our house. :)  I went to the Mississauga Farmers Market this morning... I love shopping for veggies there! For $20, you can get more food than you can carry. Not to mention, every vendor wants you to taste thier latest crop; its a smorgesbord (sp?). Raspberries are on the way out, but melons and tomatoes are coming in.  Speaking of which, I hope you guys like tomatoes b/c there's no way Rick and I will eat all the tomatoes that are coming in in my garden so I'll probably be bringing some to work for you folks!
