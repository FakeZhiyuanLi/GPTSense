      well i finally got things right! well when it come to the TIMEZONE of my BLOG. hahaha! I'm not that super internet junkie and all kaya i don't really explore on stuffs too much. well i finally got it right. I was in the Los Angeles Time Zone but now i'm now in manila. where i should be!  What an Introduction! TIME. it is one of the evry important things in our lives. we are all bound to follow whatever time dictates to us. For me i need to wake-up at a certain time to get to where i need to go. Meetings should be on time. Call Times for the Bands. The time of Performance that is and time to sleep. time to eat. time to call. time to text. time to blog. time to work. time to talk. time to write. time to watch. time to do whateever we want. Time to be  HAPPY  and  time to LOVE  ( at sana be LOVED din !) hahahaha!  for the longest TIME, i have been following my heart as to where my life should go. There have been the UPS and the DOWNS of course but the most beautiful thing is that i had a great TIME along the way. With the best things that has happend in my life, i'm most grateful of the people i came to be with and spent times with. Although some of them may not be there anymore, im so happy to be part of their lives and them as part of mine too. I consider everbody as my friends. Lifetime Friends. For that BADS Times, well we all have to go through these so that we'll be able to correct the wrong things that we do. These are the trying times that we should be able to make ourselves better persons as we can be.  well time to eat! and time to take a bath. then time to go to work! See yeah...  p.s. late ko na kwento ang revelation or whatever ni Heinz about this TIME of my life na i've been going through. hahahaha!

       super naging toxic ang mga days ko. grabe! pero managable naman eh. wala pa yata ito sa mga projects ko before. we had a meeting at san miguel for the Oktoberfest Event! still can't believe we got the project kahit na super rush namin ginawa yun presentation at super dami ng palpak na nangyari nun nagpresent kami. hehehe! after the meeting eh i went straight to Dish for the Launch of the Michelle Ayalde album.in fairness, dami ng press at maganda ang pagkakaperform ng lola that night. panalo!!! then napagkaisahan ang mga taga star at pina JAM with the next band. First contestant eh si Ms. A then si Sheryn then si Divo at si Johan Escanan. Nakakaloka at ang mga taga-Star eh super sinabi kay Johan na Crush ko sya. SHET!!!! kakahiya sa kanya. Buti na lang mabait at di naiilang kahit pinagtutulungan na kami!!! We then went to coffee bean sa isa pang napakahabang kwentuhan na enjoy naman. Tuesday was hectic to with the Voice Lessons of Charlotte that i need to arrange then the OPM Myx Guesting of Elements na kasabay ng Internal meeting sa Star re Oktoberfest. Nakita ko pala si RJ...ah si Raphael pala sa may Cafeteria. Kulit talaga! At di pa dyan natapos ang araw...punta pa ako bagaberde for Elements with Nina.  wow! 11pm na at 12 hours na akong paikot-ikot. Ang bad trip pa eh na-cut pa ang smart line ko dahil as usual, exceed na naman ako sa credit limit. hehehe! pigilan kse ang pagtatawag at sobrang text! Naku sa isang month yata eh nakaka 1000++ text ako. super pagod kaya sinagad ko ang tulog ng wed. 1pm na ako tumayo sa kama. not much to do kaya punta ako sa don bosco to check on the status ng JIG Event at magchika-chika sa mga friends. Haay sana talaga OK na!!!       grabe super dami ng tao sa Dish last night for Freestyle and Nina, syempre with Element kaya bantay na mana ako.hehehehe! sayang di nakaabot si Joseph kse nasa taping pa sya ng SCQ Reload. Well we still met at punta na lang sa BAgaberde. At least naabutan namin ang last set ni Nyoy at pinainom kami ni gerbel ng Baileys. sarap pala nun! at nagustuhan di yata ng lolo Joseph. Kwentuhan to the max ito hanggang 4.30am. naku napuyat yata si joseph at medyo madami din nainom...yikes! eh minsan lang naman uminom eh... Had a Great Time! Hectic but Great!!!

After nun eh i went with sheryn sa megamall for a store vist sa oddysey record bar. syempre kanta ang lola kahit di masyado maganda and microphone at sound system. Carry syempre! nakakaloka lang eh ginawa akong HOST. super Voice over lang nun una then naging host na super promote ng album ni sheryn. well ok lang, para sa aking friend eh gagawin ko yun syempre kahit walang budget. hahaha!  at hindi pa dyan nagtatapos ang araw ko....i went naman to the rehearsal of Elements with Michelle Ayalde for her LAunch.

       wow! medyo dumadami na ang nagpopost ng comments at the same time eh give messages sa tag board. super thanks!!! i'm sooooo touched. hahahaha! well these are just announcements that's part of my work:      San Miguel Oktoberfest...well since i'm in charge of the entertainment division of the event, i'll be looking for amateur/ college bands who would wanna perform for the oktoberfest. Of course all i can offer is EXPOSURE and the chance to be discovered. for those who are interested or if you know people who would wanna avail of this offer...please email me the band profile with pix and contact numbers (we'll contact you if ever). By the way, it's open to all genre, acoustic, r&b, retro, rock/alternative (sana di po masyadong maingay kse ayaw ng san miguel ng super heavy rock, sumali na lang yan sa MUSIKLABAN), hiphop, etc.      Well as you know, i'm road managing a band called ELEMENTS. They have a cut in the newly released GIG SOUNDS ALBUM...ang song nila dun eh yun remake ng "HOW DO YOU HEAL A BROKEN HEART". i hope you could support it sa MYX, the video will come out na. Vote kayo ha. LAso listyen to iFM 93.9...request nyo naman para dumami ang airplay. You could also request it sa ibang radio station but always mention na by ELEMENTS-Gig Sounds Album, kse baka akalain nila yun luma eh by Chris Walker. Thanks a Lot! See you at the Gigs...if you wanna go out....Aug 25 at Bagaberde, Aug 27 at Friends El Pueblo. We have mall shows too, SM Bacoor on Aug 21, SM Fairview on Aug 21.

       Why Follow Your Heart? well after reading the Andrew MAthews Book Series eh i have been inspired to take in that statement "Follow Your Heart".  I've been doing so for the past years and so far it has made me a better person. Although i took up engineering as my college course, i went into the Events, TV and now the Talent Management Career which i really LOVE. I think  and feel that it's the right path for me and i'm so very blessed to have found friends and co-workers who have helped me in reaching for my dreams. Long way to go but i'm sure i can achieve anything i want with Prayers, with my Commitement, perseverance and dedication, syempre with LOVE too. So all i can say is, what else "  FOLLOW YOUR HEART  " and you can never go wrong!
