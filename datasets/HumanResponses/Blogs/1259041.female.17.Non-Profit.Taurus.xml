      this morning i went jogging/walking/running, and i feel so great. and then i poisoned my body with one of Little Debbie's devil cremes. Damn you Little Debbie, and your scrumptious pastries!But, hey! i still feel pretty gosh darn good. I'm going to leave the house early so i can go downtown and read a book or something. I need some quality time with myself.

      do you ever have conversations with people that aren't there? I do. And its strange i think. It makes me feel close to insanity. Makes me feel like some creepy guy in his mother's basement- like a jeffrey dahmer type. Maybe not that bad But wierd enough to feel weird.

      today i begin my mission to lead both a healthy and active lifestyle. I start doing pilates again, and I'm going to eat more foods that contain actual nutrients. and water! water is so important! water makes me feel good, i just forget to drink it. I just have to put this out there because if i don't say it or write it down or blog it then it just won't happen, you know? I have will power, but i need reinforcement, too.  p.s.: i just spell checked this, and wouldn't you know it, the blogger spell check doesn't recognize "blog" as an actual word. funny.

      thank you spin magazine for including cds with you magazines. especially the latest issue with the yeah yeah yeahs on the cover. I can't stop listening to this one song called  somewhere only we know  from  keane . I am completely addicted. on the way back home from san francisco i had this song on repeat and then i slept to it the night i came back, and then for a few hours the next morning, and now sparatically throughout the days just to keep me going.   I wanted to write all about first friday, but alas, i have not. It wasn't especially interesting, or anything. there was some good art on display, and i ran into a few people from school and elsewhere. generally, it was just nice to be in good company. I hadn't talked to jaime in a while so it was good to hang out with him at first friday. We ran into this guy Matt that used to go to school with us when i was a... freshman? Anyhow, he's a cool guy, and he hung with us for the remainder of the evening. Then we saw michael getting gas at coastal, and- maybe it was just me- he was acting a bit strangely. however he insisted that he just wanted to know how i was doing, and that's always a nice thing to hear. eventually, jaime, his sister- cindy, kris and i went to the Denny's downtown and saw marcella performing her duties as a hostess. We ordered sundaes- hot fudge and strawberry, and somehow the two of them became one, and i was shocked to find that not only had strawberry syrup found its way into my sundae but an actual strawberry as well! (yes... i really do find these kind of things amusing.) Jaime kept making fun of our black waitress, and i laughed, but shamefully. he was just kidding, though. he's not a racist or anything. it's just that she was kind of being a bitch to us. she had a little bit of attitude, and probably decided that she didn't want to put up with some stupid punk kids and their shananigans.

      my name is monica ruth olivo, I'm 17 years old, and the only way to describe my existence is to say that it is... subtle. At least that's the way i look at it. I'm not some depressed goth kid that just sits at home watching porn and slitting her wrists or anything like that. My life has its high points, but in general I'm a bum. But hey! it's sumertime, now, so all of this is about to change.

       Terribly hungry over here... sigh, I'm all dressed up and nowhere to go. I like what I'm wearing today, I look like a school teacher from the 80s. I want to do something tremendously fun, and exciting. Victor said i could go over and watch movies and raid his fridge, but it would take me 3 hours to get there on the bus. I need me an automobile. Maybe i could go to the park and read a book. Hunger is the worst. I need a haircut. I miss my old hair... I've been trying to grow it out so that i can have hair to the middle of my back, cause all the girls at school cut their hair short, and most of the time it looks stupid. I liked my hair the way it was, it wasn't terribly short and it reminded me of the kind of haircut a fairy would have. Man, fairies are the best. When i get married i want to look like a fairy. and when i go to prom i want to look like a fairy. For every single formal event in my life i wish to look like&nbsp;a fairy. Fairies are natural beauties, and they always have so much fun and seem to be in love with the whole world. Of course I've never met one, or anything... I'm just assuming.

       a couple of nights ago i dreamt that four girls that i hate beat me up. maybe that's what i get for saying i hate people. It's been bothering me, though. These are girls that i rarely see. Somehow i feel as though i've been persecuted by them, even though we've never spoken. Theyre those kind of girls that are mean to everyone- the ones that want to spit in your face if you think her shoes are from payless, or the ones who think theyre the sexiest things on earth and walk down the hallway with their noses in the air.&nbsp;They hate you just because you breathe.

       Ah, man, it's been about a month since i said i was gonna start exercising and eating right, but that's a bunch of crap. I'm a terrible liar, and a terrible person.&nbsp;anyway, i went to the library today. I bought some old books in the library basement. These books are CLASSICS! Oliver Twist, The Tempest, Common Sense, The Glass Menagerie...Planet of the Apes- i got it all! yeah, then i went to Texas Thrift and&nbsp;decided that&nbsp;they suck. Anyhoo, now i'm at home sucking on a straw, and you know what's on the other end of that straw? A delicious lemon slush from the local Sonic Drive-Thru! If you'll excuse me I have a date with Ponyboy...

       Rilo Kiley has a new cd coming out in august.   I listened to a couple of songs from it today, and they were just so awesome. Gotta love that Jenny Lewis! They're coming to Austin in october, and I am so there. Oh yeah and The Shins are going to be playing at Stubb's in September, since they didn't play their show in july, so that makes me feel a lot better becuase i was out of funds. Hooray for music!
