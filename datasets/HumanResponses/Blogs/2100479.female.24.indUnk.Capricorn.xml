      Exercise-----------------------Weight-------Reps/Set Dumbbell Flys------------------10 each hand-6/1 Bench Press--------------------60-----------6/F Rest Straight Arm Lat Pressdowns----50-----------10/F Palms up Close grip Pulldowns--60-----------8/F Rest Deadlifts----------------------75-----------6/F?  No more deadlifts.  At least, not with the bar, maybe using dumbbells.  For some reason, I cannot stand up without feeling like I am going to loose my balance, which causes my form to go down the drain.  I think it has something to do with the way I stand.  When I am in a natural (for me) standing position, me feet are kind look like this \ / except the left foot is more out, and the right foot is just a smidge more in.  Or, perhaps, that is not abnormal, and I just need to get on lighter weights.  I suppose I can try lighter weights next time, and if I still can't do it, then switch to dumbbells.  Also, today was archery practice.  We shot for about an hour and a half before the workout.  I shoot a 35 lb. recurve with wooden arrows.  Just for the record, I moved off of the 20 yard target to the 30 yard target, and only missed the butte once.  Huzzah!   Food Consumption: Coffee with sugar and coffeemate Reuben and Fries Fry Sauce (about 2 tbs) Iced Tea Carrot Cake Taco Bell - beef grilled stuffed burrito, big soft taco water, lots of it  Hmm, I have a thing for desserts this week.  O-well.

      Panda and I are supposed to go to the exercise machine store sometime this week.  I really want a stationary bike, so that I can do some cardio on the non-weight days.  In other news, I am really starting to like the way I look.  I have noticed that I don't feel the need to pull in my stomach on a regular basis, and when I catch a glimpse of myself in a mirror, I am not frowning.  Yay!    Food consumption: Coffee with sugar and coffeemate Chicken Lo Mein Iced Tea Pecan Pie (1 slice) Taco Bell - 1 beef grilled stuffed burrito Lots of water

      Exercise-------------------------Weight--------------Reps/Set Dumbbell Lateral Raises----------7 1/2 each hand-----8/F Bent-over Dumbbell Laterals------5 each hand---------8/F Palms-up Pulldowns----------------70-----------------12/F Triceps Pressdowns----------------55-----------------12/F Dips------------------------------60-----------------3/F  Panda helped me out with my form.  Apparently, when you do these things correctly, the weight you can lift drops significantly.  It was mildly depressing, until I got to the last three exercises, and  noticed that on two of them, I had to increase the weight.  Yay!  And, because I went to 12 on those, I actually need even more weight on there!  Panda said I should be sitting from 6-10 reps, except for the dips.    Food consumption: 1 egg, over-hard 1 waffle with butter and syrup coffee with sugar and coffeemate Taco Bell - 3 hard shell tacos Maxx recovery drink, grape (yuck!) Lots of water

      I had to improvise some of today's exercises.  I don't think it did as good a job as last time, but I do feel that I got a decent workout.  Exercise-----------------------------------------------Weight--Reps/Set Leg Extensions-----------------------------------------70------8/1 Leg Extension (held two dumbbells/tried to squat)------40------10/F Calf Raises (held two dumbbells/lifted from the floor)-50------15/F Crunches-----------------------------------------------5-------47/1 Crunches (removed the weight, was awkward)-------------none----28/1 Side Crunches------------------------------------------none----15 each side/F  I am planning on doing some more research to find ways to do these workouts with limited access to machines.  Food Consumption: Slim Fast shake 2 cups of coffee with sugar and coffeemate - I should note that I am leaving at least 1/4 of this in the cup by the end of the morning. Frisco patty melt hashbrowns with american cheese cherry turnover Iced tea Cobb salad w/bleu cheese dressing Iced tea bloody mary 4 nutter butter cookies Lots of water  I've been craving sweets lately.  I think it has something to do with walking past a bakery every morning this week.

      Today I did 30 minutes of dying, I mean, medium exertion on a stationary bike.  During the workout I felt out of shape and fat, but afterwards, I felt really great!  Food consumption: Slim Fast shake 2 cups of coffee with 2 tsp of sugar and coffeemate 3 beef tacos with sour cream, lettuce and cheese rice and beans Iced Tea Chicken Club on herb foccacia bread, with chicken, ham, bacon, American cheese, lettuce, tomato, and some sort of sauce Iced Tea lots of water Hot chamomile tea  As a side note, I think I am doing really well with cutting down on the added sugar.  Yay, me!

      Today I am on the road, so I am not sure that I will have access to any type of gym.  If I do have access, I plan on working out.  Food Consumption: McDonald's - Bacon, Egg, and Cheese biscuit 2 cups of coffee with sugar and coffeemate water Frisco patty melt (it came with fries, but I did not eat them) water Spinach and artichoke dip with garlic toast 2 small bloody marys  *Later* The hotel has a really nice gym.  They have almost all the machines one could want, plus freeweights.  They also have a dry sauna, a steamroom, an inhalation room (whatever that is), a pool, and two hot tubs.  They have locker rooms, too.  Now if every hotel had facilities like this one, I would be so very happy!  Chest and Back: Exercise-----------------------Weight-------Reps/Set Dumbbell Flys------------------8 each hand--8/1 Bench Press--------------------50-----------3/F Rest Straight Arm Lat Pressdowns----20-----------10/1 Palms up Close grip Pulldowns--60-----------10/F Rest Deadlifts----------------------71-----------12/F?  I am not sure if I actually went to failure on the deadlifts, or if I stopped because my hands were hurting from the textured bar.  I forgot my weight gloves at home.  *sigh*  I did note "FM" after the palms up close grip pulldowns.  Hmmm, let me put it this way, the second word is "me".    Note the word "rest" in-between some of the exercises.  Those exist because there are pre-fatigue exercises before the Failure exercises, and I want to be sure to include them on the workouts.  For those exercises without a "rest" in between them, one is supposed to go straight from one to another with as little pause in between as possible.

      I think I need to find a way to put more cardio into this workout that Panda is on.  I just need to be more active.  After sitting around for a few days, I just want to climb a wall or something.  Maybe if I just don't do cardio in the few days following the leg workout?  I'll have to do a bit of research on that.    Panda just doesn't have that much body fat to lose.  His biggest trouble spot is right around his middle, and it wasn't that much of a trouble spot to begin with.  So the more muscle he gets, the leaner and more bulked up he gets.  I, on the other hand, have ended up with some rock-hard muscles under an oh-so-attractive layer of fluff.  *pout*  I just want to get rid of the fat quickly.  I really don't care if it takes another year to get some real definition on my muscles, but I would pay good money to wake up tomorrow and have about half the fat that I have now.  That said, I am trying really hard to watch my food.  Every once in a while, the desire for something greasy, or sweet, comes up.  I give into the craving.  I'm not even going to lie about it, but I do try to satisfy it in moderation.  I think that slowly, very slowly, I'll clean up my dietary habits, but for now, I think I am doing pretty good.  Anyhow.  Food consumption for the day:  Bowl of Kashi with 2% milk 2 cups of coffee with a total of 3 tsp of sugar and some coffeemate Reuben on Rye French Fries (I know, I know, but I was CRAVING them!) Fry sauce (2 Tbs ketchup, 1 Tbs mayo) Iced Tea (no sugar, no lemon) Chicken cooked with yogurt  (see the entry for today in  urlLink Down to the Last Cigarette  for more details) Bismati rice green beans Lots of water

      Panda's routine requires about 4 days off in between workouts.  Believe me, I need it.  I am not overly sore anymore, but I am still quite aware that I pushed myself really hard on the last visit to the gym.    I would be really doubtful that this workout is going to do any good, because of the short and infrequent workouts, but you should see the progress that Panda has been making.  It really is amazing.  I have been lax about recording my food intake over the weekend, mostly because I have not been home in quite a while, and I was pretty busy.  In general, I tend to eat less when I am home.  I am bored less, and I have less money to spend on going to a restaurant for food.  Add onto that a lack of motivation to cook something, and my junk food consumption goes way down.  Anyway, I'm going to start recording again, starting right now.  Bowl of Kashi with 2% milk (yes, I am trying to make the switch over from whole milk) 2 cups of coffee, with a total of 3 tsp sugar, and some coffeemate. Tuna salad sandwich on whole wheat 2 pickle spears Small side of Beef, barley and vegetable soup (probably 1/4 cup) 2 crackers (in the soup) Iced Tea (no sugar, no lemon) 2 cups sweet potato casserole

      I started Panda's routine.  Exercise--------------------------Weight-------------Reps-------------Sets Leg Extensions--------------------80----------------12---------------1/F Leg Press-------------------------140---------------12---------------1/F Calf Raises-----------------------120---------------12---------------1/F Crunches, regular-----------------none--------------20---------------1 Crunches, obliques, both sides----none--------------15---------------1  The Leg Extensions were pre-exhaust.  I need to use less weight, slower reps next time.    Actually, this workout didn't seem that hard when I was finished with it...Until 5 minutes later, that is.  Walking was a whole new experience, and stairs were my arch-enemy.

      No exercise today.  I am really sore from yesterday's workout.    Food Intake: 2 biscuits with gravy 1 cup skim milk Starbucks: tall (the smallest size) White Chocolate Mocha coffee, no whipped cream Taco Bell: 4 hard shell tacos cup of hot tea lots of water  I am going to start taking fish oil supplements again.  I already take a multi-vitamin every day.    The picture of myself is about a year old.  I'll get another one made soon.

      I had a really dumb idea yesterday.  I thought I would try out this workout I found in a fitness magazine.  It seemed really ambitious, but I thought I would give it a whirl.  A trainer at the gym saw it and shook his head, saying it was too much.  He was right.  Panda has been forming his own workout plan, and I think I may take a look at it, and try that one instead.  If that doesn't work for me, I'll just have to break down and set up an appointment with the personal trainer at our local Gold's.    Exercise-------------------Weight---------------Reps---------Sets Leg Extensions-------------80-------------------10-----------2 Leg Adduction--------------90-------------------10-----------2 Butt Blaster---------------87/100---------------12-----------2 Shoulder Press-------------37.5/25--------------10-----------2 Lat Pull Down--------------80-------------------10-----------2 Row------------------------50-------------------10-----------2 Incline Chest Press--------35/20----------------10-----------2 One Arm Concentration Curl-15-------------------10-----------2 Roman Chair Leg Raises-----none-----------------10-----------2 Bicycle Crunches-----------none-----------------10-----------2 Verticle Crunch------------none-----------------10-----------2 Reverse Crunch-------------none-----------------10-----------2 Exercise Ball Crunch-------none-----------------15-----------2 Side Bridges---------------none-----------------2------------2 Dumbbell Lateral Raises----8 each---------------10-----------2  No Cardio (at least I was smart there)  And, if one can imagine, I skipped two other exercises.  This was just stupid.  I spent almost two hours in the gym, worn out about halfway through.  I am definitely not doing this routine again.  Food Consumption: Bowl of Kashi with whole milk. 2 cups whole milk (one glass) 20-25 Bing cherries Side Salad with Fat free ranch (yuck on the FF ranch) Original Whopper, no cheese, no bun, with mayo mustard and ketchup Iced Tea Apple juice with creatine and glutamine (pre-workout) Isopure protein drink, 160 calories, 40 grams of protein (post-workout) 1/2 can chicken soup Lots of water 2 cups whole milk (one glass)    *NOTE  I am on the road, trying to get rid of a gallon of milk before I head home tomorrow morning.  This is not a usual amount of milk consumption for me.

      30 minutes of high intensity interval cardio on the stationary bike.  Food intake: Bowl of Kashi with whole milk One can of Slim Fast Olive Garden: two helpings of salad, two breadsticks, Tour of Italy (lasagna, fettuccini alfredo, chicken parmesean) only ate the lasagna, one bite of alfredo, two bites of chicken) slice of lemon cream cake glass of apple juice with glycogen 1/2 can of chicken soup  1 cup of whole milk  I think this blog is helping me keep some motivation, but I would really like to hear from anyone who may be reading this.  I do best when I have some sort of accountability, and knowing that I have readers who are expecting me to stick with this would really help.  Thanks!

      I woke up late.  Actually, I woke up on time, but then I had one of those dreams in which I was getting out of bed and putting on my sweats to go work out.  So I ended up missing the morning cardio.  On the first day, too.  Well, I shouldn't be surprised.  I am not a morning person.  I never have been.    However, instead of titling this entry as "Failure"  I got to title it "Cardio" because I did it tonight, after work.  30 minutes on a stationary bike, interval training, intense exertion.  It felt great.  Well, not while I was doing it, but afterwards, I felt very good about myself.  So instead of fooling myself into thinking that I can actually get up early and set my bottom on a machine, I am going to try to do this at night, just like my weights.  Food intake for the day: Bowl of Kashi with whole milk Peach V-8 Spicy Hot Cracker Barrel- 2 fried eggs, 2 sides hashbrown casserole, 2 biscuits with gravy, 5 small chicken fingers  (I know, I know) Iced Tea About 1 & 1/2 cups of sliced strawberries...Maybe a bit more, but they were about to spoil. Lots of water Apple juice with glutamine supplement

      Yesterday, I bought both creatine and glutamine supplements.  I started taking them this morning.  I am not sure that I feel any different, but I definitely feel like eating less after chugging down all that juice!    Today I had a bowl of Kashi for breakfast, along with the creatine and the glutamine mixed into apple juice.  For lunch, I ate at the Cracker Barrel.  I had the chicken and dumplings and two sides of hashbrown casserole.  I also ate two biscuits, with butter and grape jelly.  When I returned to the hotel, I had a glass of apple juice with creatine mixed in, and then I did a short workout.  After that, I had another glass of apple juice with glutamine.  I don't see how people can eat when they are taking all of these supplements.  I am so full right now that the thought of food is just repulsive.  I suppose I will get used to it, though.  I tried to go to the Gold's Gym today, but unfortunately, it was closed.  The other location was open earlier in the day, but alas, the time was nearing 5pm, and that location was closed as well.  I headed back to the hotel, so that I could use the weight room there.  Because it is a courtesy gym, and not a full-blown weight room, I could only do some of my exercises, and even some of those were improvised using the equipment in ways that I am not sure it is intended to be used.    Exercise-------------------------Weight----------Reps----------Sets Pull-over------------------------30--------------8-------------F-1 Row------------------------------90--------------8-------------F-1 Chest Press----------------------60--------------8-------------F-1 Crunch---------------------------none------------30------------F-1 Shoulder Shrug-------------------50--------------8-------------F-1 Overhead cable tricep press------40--------------8-------------F-1 Lat Pull Down--------------------70--------------8-------------F-1 Incline Press--------------------50--------------8-------------F-1  Some of these exercises were performed with different weights than last time.  I am not sure if this is due to a difference in equipment, or in not understanding how this particular machine denotes weight.  I felt like I was working at a comparable effort, so I am not that worried about it.  After all, I can get back to Gold's for my next workout.  There is one exception to the above explanation, however.  The shoulder shrug was performed with less weight this time.  I did this because I realized that I was doing the exercise incorrectly with the higher weight.  I was using my arms instead of my shoulders to do the work, so I adjusted my form, and reduced the weight to facilitate correct movement.  I am going to try out Margaret Diubaldo's cardio plan.  Until I leave SLC, I am going to use the hotel's exercise bike in the mornings.  I am not going to be working my lower body during this time, because I feel that I need more rest for the muscles when I am training them with weights.  Since cardio machines tend to use the legs to generate a higher heart rate, I this seems like a sensible idea.  Of course, I am trying to figure this all out as I go along, so everything may change next week.

      As the title suggests, today was upper-body day.  F-1 (to failure, one time) means that I kept doing the exercise until I could no longer continue to do the exercise in correct form.  Exercise---------------------Pounds---------Reps----------Sets Pullover---------------------20-------------20------------F-1 Seated Row-------------------90-------------10------------F-1 Back Extension---------------20-------------15------------F-1 Obliques side bend-----------20-------------15------------F-1 Shoulder Press---------------30-------------8-------------F-1 Chest Press------------------30/40----------17/8----------1/F-1 Tricep Press-----------------50-------------10------------F-1 Sit-up, Incline--------------none-----------10------------F-1 Crunch-----------------------none-----------20/15---------1/F-1 Concentration Curl-----------20-------------6-------------F-1 Bench Fly--------------------20 total-------15------------F-1 Lateral Dumbbell Raise-------20 total-------4-------------F-1 Shoulder Shrug---------------60 total-------10------------F-1  So I learned a few things today.  One is to mix my exercise order a bit more.  I noticed that as I came to the end of my workout, I lost the ability to complete at least 8 reps.  My muscles were feeling tired.  Next time I will mix them up a bit more, and perhaps back off some of the weight on the shoulder shrug.  I had my body fat measured using one of these little electronic thingies, and it said that I am at 28.6%, +/- 2%.  I am not happy about that, because it seemed less scientific than the calipers, and I was expecting to see a figure closer to 25.  I did find out that the University of Utah has a hydrostatic body fat testing tank, so I am going to try that out.  It only costs $25, and I know that it will be accurate.    I did not do any cardio during my workout.  I know that I should be doing some cardio, I am just not sure how much I should be doing.  Right now my plan is to do cardio on every other "off" day.  I am going to keep looking for more information on this topic so that I can make a better, more informed decision.

      Today is my rest day.  Two days ago, I worked my upper body.  Yesterday, I worked my lower body.  Today is for rest, and tomorrow I work my upper body again.  I could do cardio today, but I think my legs need a complete rest from the work.  Tomorrow, I will get my body fat measured.  I do not get on the scale anymore.  I started at 158 pounds, at 5'6" tall.  I wore a size 12.  The last time I checked the scale was more than a week ago, and it said that I weighed 154.  However, I now wear a size 8.  Therefore, I believe that I am losing fat, but gaining muscle.  I would like to be a size 6 or less, but I want a sleek body more than the dress size.    My abs are starting to come in, and I can actually see a bicep when I flex my arms.  My husband said that my back is looking really good these days.    My goal is to figure out what a healthy body fat number is for me, and then attain it.  I would like to have my muscles be obvious even when I am not flexing.  I would love to look like Margaret Duibaldo.    Yes, that would be great.

      Exercise----------------------------Weight-----------Reps----------Sets  Chest Press-------------------------50---------------8--------------2  Dumbbell Incline Fly----------------10 each----------8--------------2  Flat Bench Dumbbell Press-----------10---------------8--------------2  Lateral Raise (machine)-------------25---------------8--------------2#  Lateral Raise (dumbbell)------------10---------------8--------------2#  Rear Deltoids (row)-----------------15---------------8--------------2*     The * means that I need to increase the weight.  The # means that it was difficult to complete the sets.  I messed up and inadvertently did two types of lateral raises.  I didn't even realize it until this morning.  Silly me.  Well, that makes me feel a ton better about having a hard time raising 10lb dumbbells.    The tea drinking is going quite well.  I have yet to find a flavor from the  urlLink Republic of Tea  that I don't like.  I find that I feel full throughout the day, and I eat less when it is mealtime.  Also, I seem to eat more slowly, which may be part of the reason that I am eating less.  For example, yesterday I had a bagel and a cup of skin milk for breakfast.  I drank hot tea throughout the morning, then had a slice of pizza and a Caesar salad, with water to drink, for lunch.  I followed that with more hot tea in the afternoon, and then went to work out after work.  Finally, after a bit of shopping, I had a Greek salad from Panaera Bread, along with a glass of water and more hot tea.  Of course, I also had my nightly cup of Chamomile Lemon, to help me sleep.   I am sure a lot of the fullness is from taking in so much in fluids, but as long as I can drink something that I enjoy, and know that it has no fat or calories, I am pretty happy about that.

I added a lot of ab work that is not normally in the plan.  Also, there was supposed to be another tricep exercise, close grip presses, but I failed at the 8th rep of the first set of dips, so I figured I had worked them as much as I could.  The gym I was at did not have a seated calf raise, and I did not worry about doing double sets of the standing raises.    You may have noticed that I am not including my diet lately.  Now, don't worry, I am eating.  I have been eating a lot of stuff that is bad for me, though.  I am not putting on more weight, but I am not losing any weight, either.  I am going to be tweaking my intake a little bit to find some ways to cut out some of the bad foods, or at least cut down the portion sizes of those foods.  I have been thinking about drinking more hot teas in between my meals.  I don't add sugar, creamer, or honey to my tea, unlike my coffee.  Therefore, I can drink tea between meals to help me feel fuller, longer, and I am hoping that will cut out some of my unhealthy snack cravings.

      One of the big reasons that I am keeping a food diary on here is to feel like I have some sort of accountability when it comes to my food intake.&nbsp;   Unlike some people, I do not do it because I will eat too much, but because when I start thinking about food, I eat far too little.&nbsp; You see, I had a problem with anorexia while I was in college.   It started out because I literally had no money for food.&nbsp; By the time I did get money for proper meals, I was used to eating a little packet of oatmeal and one hotdog a day.&nbsp; Oh, and drinking lots and lots of water.&nbsp; So, when I could eat more, because I could buy more, I decided that I obviously did not need that much food to function, and besides, I had lost 15 pounds.&nbsp;   By the time I dropped down to a size 4 (on a 5'7" frame), I was thoroughly pleased with being called 'little'.&nbsp; When I dropped even more, I quit getting on the scale, did not buy any smaller clothing, and started wearing bulky sweaters on purpose.&nbsp; You see, I had gotten so thin that I was worried that other people may think I was too thin, and they would try to make me eat.&nbsp; Now, I did not think that I was too little.&nbsp; In fact, I was spending about 2 and a half hours a DAY in the gym, trying to get rid of more 'fat'.&nbsp;&nbsp;   Anorexia was in full swing.&nbsp;   I am not sure how I got out of it.&nbsp; I think that perhaps I got depressed (a side effect of not eating, by the way) and started eating because I was unhappy.&nbsp; Not that eating made me feel better about myself, but I think that getting fuel for my body did make me feel healthier.   So now, I find myself not wanting to fill in my food diary some days.&nbsp; I have actually had the thought, some mornings, that&nbsp;if I did not fill it out, then I could only eat a little bit, and no one would get mad at me for not taking in enough calories.&nbsp; *ding ding! danger, will robinson, danger!* But then I acknowledge that it is an unhealthy tendency that is trying to crop back up, and I overcome it.&nbsp;   The only down side that I have found to this is that I then figure that since I have to eat, I don't have to feel guilty about eating something that isn't good for me.&nbsp;&nbsp; But, hey, I can only work on so many things at once.   ****If you have an eating disorder, talk to your doctor.&nbsp; They can help you get help.&nbsp; If you don't have a doctor,  urlLink these people  will help you find help.****

      I have decided to no longer label my rest days.  I know what they  are.  I don't want to feel guilty for listening to my body tell me  it needs a rest.     Obviously, today, I need to  rest.  I really pushed myself last night with my leg  workout.  It was all I could do to walk to my car  afterwards.  This morning, I was not so sore as to not be able to  walk, but walking was not fun.  I am still moving in slow  motion.      Anyhow, I also woke up early, drove two  hours, and then worked for about 8 &amp; 1/2 hours, so I am beat.   I could use a night of sitting around.     Food-  Breakfast:  Oatmeal with 3 little packets of butter, 2 tsp of brown sugar  2 cups of 2% milk  Coffee with 2 sugars and 3 non-dairy creamers (did not finish     No snack...way too busy     Lunch:  Chinese, Angry Chicken (very hot, very nummie)  egg drop soup  one crab rangoon  water...lots and lots of water     Snack:  6 oreo cookies  water    Dinner: Wendy's- Tripple with cheese, and everything on it. water   Chamomille tea

      I have decided to try out Margaret Diubaldo's workout routine.  Of course, I forgot to print out what goes on what day, so I had to wing it.  I figured I would start with arms.  Exercise--------------------Weight----Reps--Sets Arm Curl--------------------30--------8-----1 Bicep Press-----------------60--------12----1 Palm-together Pull Down-----75--------8-----1 Tricep Press----------------60--------6-----1 Dip-------------------------120-------5-----1  Just for the record, the goal with dips is to use a lighter counter-weight.  So when I put 120 there, it means that I was actually dipping about 30 pounds.  For food intake, the new plan is to eat smaller portions, more fiber when possible, snack on fruit in-between meals, more water, less sugar, and less fried foods.  Food journal will resume tomorrow.

      I am taking a break from my current routine.  I am in the process of revamping my approach, and I think I'll have it finalized by this evening.  Using my husband's routine was creating results, but I was losing interest.  Having three days to sit around, doing nothing, was getting me back into my pre-exercise days.  I am also kicking around the idea of getting back into martial arts classes.  Unfortunately, the form that I used to practice, Wing Chun, is not taught in Omaha.  *pout*  So, I will have to choose something else.  But, I think that it would be great to get myself back into the group learning environment.  Plus, I just really enjoyed learning about the thought processes behind the art.  Food journal will resume shortly.  It is much the same as it has been previously, but with smaller portions, more fruit when I can find it, and less coffee.  Additionally, I am attempting to eat more often, but in smaller quantities.  I have read, and heard, that eating more often not only helps one avoid overeating, but also helps to keep blood sugar constant.  Keeping blood sugar constant is supposed to tell the body that food is plentiful, therefore, it does not have to create fat for reserve energy.  Well, we will see, now won't we?

      Exercise-----------------------------------------------Weight--Reps/Set Leg Extensions-----------------------------------------70------12/1 Leg Press----------------------------------------------140-----15/F Calf Raises--------------------------------------------150-----12/F Crunches-----------------------------------------------15------20/F  I made an increase in weight in everything but the leg extensions.  I think those are ready for an increase, though.  This workout was the first time in a rather long time that I felt like my abs really got a workout.  I think the weight I used was just fine, but I am not so good at pushing myself to not rest in between reps if my workout partner is not around.  Granted, I am not taking anything longer than a few seconds, but still, I think I am not supposed to be resting at all during the reps.  No food diary today.  Tomorrow I am going to try to figure out how I am going to change my diet around.

      That is the phonetical spelling of one sticking one's tongue out at the world.  I blew my diet.  I went to Denver for four days, and ate whatever, and whenever, and however much I wanted.  No exercise.    Perhaps I need to actually find a diet to get on.  I realize that my vices are griddle-fried foods (like the Reuben), sugars (like the cakes), and French fries.  I realize that I probably eat more in one setting than I should, and I do this because I don't have a regular eating schedule.  The only time I eat at a set time is during the work week, at 11.  I am down to about two options at this point, either figure out a different way to eat, or join weight watchers.  I think I may give this one more go on my own, but if I don't drop some of this fat, I am going to do the weight watcher's program.  I really want to get that stationary bike, too.  I definitely need to get more cardio into my routine.
