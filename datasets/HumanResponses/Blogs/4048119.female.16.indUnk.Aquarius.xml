      My family has a strange habit- they can't keep diaries. In fact, they can't keep journals or blogs either. It's a habit that has resulted in generations of people who, instead of writing down their thoughts, hopes, life experiences and perhaps imparting that knowledge to their decendents, have rathered sit their blots in front of a box and waste their life away. Well, maybe I exaggerated that last bit...   My brother was just 6 when he got his first journal. In his childlike scrawl handwriting, he wrote proudly,  "This is my new journal. I'm going to write in it every day until I'm really old and I die and then my kids can read my life."    That was his first and only entry.   I first started writing in a diary when I was 7. I got it given to me as a present from one of my aunties. It was a cute book- a little gold lock with it's little gold key, it was a hard covered book with intricate detailing and a beautiful picture on the front, complete with poem. I too picked it up and vowed to write in it every day. Just like those old people did in the movies. Problem was, I didn't know what to write about. I didn't feel I had anything particularly dark to hide, and therefore didn't feel like my diary was very exclusive. I'd much rather babble the ears off my Mum and my friends, and actually get responses, than to write in a diary that no one could ever see anyway.   So what the hell am I doing here, writing in a blog? Mm........well, I still babble to my Mum and my friends, my little intricate diary is still only half full, and it's practically against my genetic make up to be writing here..........  My Dad is a stubborn man, and like half my family will confirm, I take after him. I suppose I just wanna see how far I can go, even though everything suggests I should hate blogs.

      “I’m seeing double!” “Are you twins?” “Woah, don’t you two look alike!” “Hey twin, come over here!” “Which one are you?” “Are you Twin 1 or Twin 2?”  When you’re a twin, you face these kinds of comments on a regular basis. Quite often though, it’s the first comment, someone thinking they’re just so witty. If you’ve ever said that to a twin, never do it again. It is very lame.  Quite often people tell me they wish they had a twin sister. Quite often, on chat shows, you’ll see twin sisters who claim that they’d die if they were ever parted from the other, that they’re each other’s best friend. Wow. Where did I go wrong? If I’m not mistaking, things are nothing like that.  Since birth, whenever my relatives, family friends or anyone else would buy a present for my sister, they would also give me the exact same thing. They worried that if one got something the other didn’t, they’d get jealous. All through my life, I owned the same things as my sister, just perhaps a different colour. We would wear the same clothes, and people would comment on just how adorable we looked. When I was a little older, a friend asked me, “Do you actually like wearing the same thing as your sister?” Well Megan, no, no I don’t. Being a twin means that no one ever treats you as an individual, instead they treat you as a pair. People would actually tell me, “Oh, I can’t tell you apart, so I’ll just call you Twin.” How nice of them.  Things might have worked out had my sister and I been the same. Yes, we look very similar, especially when we were younger, that’s been established. Problem is, we are otherwise complete opposites. No joke- we are the split opposite of almost everything. Just to name a few things:  I can create art from my head, My sister has to copy something.  I’m good at English, My sister is good at Math.  I’m not a very good cook, My sister’s practically a chef.  My favourite book: Mullengro (adult fiction, crime/fantasy novel) Her favourite book: Spooking The Cows (teen fiction, diary style comedy)  I would never be interested in sewing if it saved my life, My sister has completed a meter long cross-stitch tapestry.  I’m a romantic, My sister is a hopeless romantic.  I like High Fashion, She likes Punk Fashion.  Does that give you an idea? This was one of the reasons the whole ‘give them the same presents’ thing never worked well. We like completely different things. Oh dear.  Sorry, what was that? I owe you money? No, sorry, I think you mean Belinda. No really, that’s her over there. I’m Miranda, honest.

      I spoke about my brother in my previous post. Seems like he's going to get a fair bit of coverage in this blog- he's one of those people you always talk about but never to.  One thing about my brother is that everyone's insanely jealous of him. As a baby, strangers would literally stop my mother during her shopping to squat down and admire how 'absolutely adorable' he was. Of course, this doesn't quite beat the time when Japanese tourists stopped us to take a photo of the 'cute baby Australian twins' in the airport when I was about two. But that's another story. Anyway, everyone was always commenting how cute my brother was. This carried on into his teenage years, though 'cute' was meant in a very different sense.  My brother is six years older than me, so when I was still in mid-primary school, he was in his mid-teens, going through his last years of school, the lucky duck. For a streamlined trip, my Mum would drive to the primary school first after school to pick me and my sister up, then she would follow the road to the high school to pick up my brother. This allowed me, every afternoon, to confirm that...well...my brother was very popular. Each afternoon he would be sitting on the grass by the cark park with a rather large circle of girls around him. Each afternoon it was required that he both hug and kiss each of those girls goodbye, leaving them there giggling as we drove up the road. In my eyes, back then....ew, cooties. In his eyes, back then.....well, it's pretty much the same as now. He'd get this big cocky grin on his face.  Okay, so by now I've established that my brother isn't exactly bad looking, being half italian and all, but he's also developed some sort of bond with girls where, even if he expresses no interest in them whatsoever, then still fall head over heels for him. But not only this, he's also, well, kinda famous.  By the time I hit high school, my brother had come and gone. Literally on a daily basis, some group of girls, a different group each time, would walk past then after catching a glance, then run to me. "Oh my god! Are you Mark's sister??" To which I would answer, "Uh, yeah..." leaning backwards as they leared over me in excitement. "Oh god! He's so hot/cute!" Mind you, this continued for three years as I attended high school, long after my brother left. People younger than him still remember him. Younger girls had big sisters, after all.  Might I note that my brother's  real  name isn't Mark, but it may as well be- after Mark  Philippoussis, tennis player, one of  the  hottest men I know of.  This small dose of fame wasn't only contained to the school grounds. Shopping center, nightclubs, restaurants, fast food joints, work colleagues- just to name a few- all people who looked at me, then said any of the following things: "Are you Mark's sister?" "Is your brother's name Mark?" "What's your last name? You have a brother Mark, don't you?" or, of course, the jackpot: "Oh my god! Are you Mark's sister? He's so hot/cute!!" It does seem that my brother gets around, doesn't it? Oh dear.  To add to my brother's aquired 'fame', he also seems to be best buds with a lot of famous people. He'll sit there in front of the tv, and some emerging celebrity will show up and he'll yell out, "Oi! I know him. Yeah, I went to school with him/ met him in a bar/ met him in a nightclub/ jammed with him on weekends/ went surfing with him on weekends. I'll have get in touch with him again. Hang on, I think I still have his number on my phone...."  That being said, my brother used to play in a band, the garage kind, with Shannon Noll (Australian Idol 2nd place winner) before the dude got famous. In fact, before the end of the year, when ol' Shannon's back in the city, my brother will be getting drunk with him and Shannon's cousin in a couple high end nightclubs.  My brother isn't overly excited about any of this, either. What he's really bouncing about is the fact he gets his own body guards for a night. Figures.
