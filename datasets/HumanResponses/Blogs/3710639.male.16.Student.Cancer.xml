      A short video on the MuchMusic (Canada's music station) show, MuchNews, had various people voicing their opinions on same-sex marriage.   urlLink The video.   The Canadian Election happens in a few days time, and video segments like these are appearing more and more on the MuchMusic airwaves. They've dedicated a whole show called MuchVote 2004, which contains many segments like the one linked, to get the train of political thought rolling in an attempt to get viewers to vote. I thought I'd use this entry to elaborate on what some of the people were saying in this array of opinions.   People should be allowed to get married, regardless of sexual orientation.  Care to take that a step further? You're not really doing much to change or enforce whatever opinions I may have on same-sex marriages.   Marriage is a sacred institution between a man and a woman.  What? Are you kidding me? Marriage isn't sacred. Marriage is a joke. Example, Jennifer Lopez. If a marriage is so sacred, then how come more than fifty percent of them end in divorce?   It's always controversial when groups are given equal rights.  Like when blacks were given equal rights. I'm sure that sparked a lot of controversy within the general population (and I say general because I know that  some  racist groups were highly opposed to this idea, but not nearly on the level as gays gaining the right to marriage)   God meant for marriage to be between a man and a woman.  This according to the Bible. He also meant for marriages to last a lifetime, as well as many other things (which include sex being used only as a form of reproducing and not for enjoyment) which we don't follow.   For many of us, preserving the traditional defintion of marriage is important.  "For many." "Many" also get divorces, and that doesn't preserve marriage at all.   I don't support same-sex marriages, but I think it would still be possible to carry this opinion and still support my friends in gay relationiships.  That's like not allowing a black friend in the '60s and any time previous (in some cases later) to enter an all-white restaurant because of your "opinion". Whatever happened to equality between all people, equality which stretches to the realms of marriage and beyond?   What a person does in the bedroom is their own business. As long as it doesn't affect my life, then I don't really care.  A popular opinion among morons. The topic is gay  marriage , not gay sex. So many times have I heard people expressing this opinion when somebody decides to bring up same-sex marriage.   Family has to be preserved as an insitution for the country.  Okay fine, fair enough. But how will a same-sex relationship ruin a family in more of a way then 50% of all wedded couples divorcing?  Most of us have heard people saying things like this before. My stance on gay marriage is that I don't really care about it. It is not an issue that I am particularily concerned with, and I won't give a politician a vote based on his or her stance on same-sex marriage. As a matter of fact,I probably wouldn't give a politician any vote right now. Two more years until I can do that. I do understand that there will be a lot of people out there who will base their vote on what the candidates' view on gay marriage is, but that's just stupid. How about base it on something actually important, like health care and education, and not on something silly like preserving "tradition" (a tradition which has been heavily tarnished)? Many gays are probably basing their vote on this issue, which is reasonable, I guess. It's probably important to them. I wouldn't know. The city of Toronto has allowed same-sex marriage, and when a city that large is doing it, then it's only a matter of time before the rest of the world also allows it. So bide your time, and base your vote on something important.

      The Day After Tomorrow has everything that you could ask for in a natural disaster movie: an insanely large budget that still produces special effects that are shitty, a horribly implausible plot and a poorly written script, and a love interest that has nothing at all to do with the already bad plot. Let's start out with the special effects.  I'm the kind of guy who enjoys special effects. I like going to a special-effects heavy movie with a big bag of popcorn and enjoying the eye candy (why do you think Independence Day kicks ass? Because of the plot?). This was my mindset when purchasing my "The Day After Tomorrow" ticket, and I quickly realized that I wasted my money. There was a scene early on where there were several tornados tearing up the streets of LA, and that just looked plumb fake. I'll let you be the judge.   A decade plus a year ago, the movie Jurassic Park made  dinosaur  movements look more real than this. And who the hell knows how a dinosaur moves? Nobody. People have been observing tornadoes for years, and yet I was more conviced that dinos were real in Jurassic Park than the tornados in TDAT (that could be because I was 8 when I first saw JP, but I doubt it). Plus, there was a highly dramatic scene in TDAT in which computer-generated wolves were chasing after our protagonist, Sam Hall, out of a Russain Supertanker parked in the middle of NYC. You read it correctly: wolves were chasing after the main character on a Russian Supertanker that stopped in the middle of a New York City street. Anyways, these wolves looked horrible. On to the plot.  Here is a short summary about TDAT: a second ice age is upon us. But it comes much quicker than anybody could have possibly imagined. Rapidly changing weather patterns are going on all over the world, and in the span of a few days, loe and behold, a new ice age. One of the main characters, Jack Hall, has a son, Sam, who is in New York City playing in some nerdy high school trivia challenge game. He's worried as this area will become encased in ice very quickly, and wants to save his son. Two of his bravest friends join him on his quest to NYC. They drive there, from his comfortable post in Philly, and meanwhile the snow is coming down in hoards and the temperature is well below minus 50 (celsius, because Metric kicks ass). The driver, who was so unimporant that I forget his name, crashes the ugly truck they were planning to get to New York with. So they decide to walk. Walk from Philadelphia to New York City. In cold-ass weather. But hey, he's got a son to save. So they get to New York City after a long time of walking. Unfortunately, one of the party dies, so only two make it to the Public Library in NYC, where Sam and some other people are keeping warm by burning books. And they are all saved by the quick demise of the second ice age. That's the story. Don't even ask how the Russian Supertanker and the wolves played a role in the movie, because I don't even know that myself. Let's not forget all the useless plot elements: a homeless guy teaching all the rich folk how to stay warm, because homeless guys are used to keeping warm during an ice age; a little boy with cancer whose only purpose is to be saved; Sam falling in love with some tramp who leans on his shoulder at the end of the movie, and a bunch of people running away from cold. No lie, people were literally running away from the ice age. And how about everybody gripping metal with their bare hands in ice age weather and not having their skin stick to it at all? Dumb.  Because of the love interest between Sam and that tramp, whose name was Laura (I had to use imdb to figure out her name, I didn't memorize it) Sam and his crew had to go on the Russian Supertanker parked in the middle of NYC and be chased by fake-looking wolves, and then run away from the creeping ice age. And I could have gone without seeing that desecration to all that is good in movies.

      I made this blog site hoping to crusade about something. But uh, at the moment I haven't really thought of anything to crusade against. So check back later.
