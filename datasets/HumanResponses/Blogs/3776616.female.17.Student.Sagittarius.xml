      I really haven't the faintest idea on where to start this.  I don't even really know what I wnat to say, other than the fact that I have a lot of shit that I want to get out.  I'm just...  I don't even really know what I want to say... I'm sick of everything.  I'm sick of having to lie for people, even when I know it's wrong.  I'm sick of doing what's right and being reprimanded and shut out by my friends. And most of all, I'm sick of telling the truth and hurting people.  I sick of watching people suffer, even when I know that what I'm doing is right.  I'm so tired of hurting and crying myself to sleep every night because I hurt someone, all the while not accepting that was I did was right in the long run, not wanting to accept that sometimes the happiest way isn't the best way. Life  ISN'T  fair, there's no getting around that fact...   I'm sick of fighting with my friends and hurting them, I'm sick of backstabbing and secret telling, I'm sick of fighting with my sister and my parents, I'm sick of listening to my parents fight, or having to listen to them bitch about each other, and I'm sick of having to hurt the person I love most in this fucked up world. Most of all, I'm sick of lying to myself, sick of convincing myself that eventually everything will be ok, I just have to work out a little problem right now.  I'm sick of not accepting the fact that before that problem is even gone another one is on the way, and tha my whole life will be like that, problem after problem piling up on each other until I can't take it anymore.  Of course, I have my 'Get Out of Jail Free' card -- college -- but how much good will that do?  Sure, I'm starting over, wiping the slate clean, and leaving behind this life, but what happens then?  I mean, I can't completely start over, because I'll always have links back to here -- a few of my true friends, and the fact that I can't completely abandon my family.  And what kind of disillusioned fantasy world would I be living in if I told myself that problems will never start up while I'm at college??  It's like that stupid saying "You can run, but you can't hide."  But it's true.  Sure, you can run from your problems for awhile, but eventually everything's going to catch back up to you...  And what can you do about it?    And now, with everything that's going on in my life... I don't know what to do.  I don't know who I can trust or confide on.  I don't even know if it's possible for me to trust anyone...  I can't talk to my parents...  They're always too busy, and they would never listen anyway.  God forbid they take a moment away from the computer or TV to listen to me...  I can't stand being around them anyway.  When they're both home they're usually complaining or fighting about something, and if I'm ever alone with one of them they're usually bitching about the other one.  Every car ride or shopping trip is like a campaign to get me on one of their sides, and I can't take it anymore.  I want more than anything to be out of this house.  Away from the fighting, away from my sister, away from all the comments about my laziness and how I never do anything around the house.  I'm sick of feeling ungratefull because I want to have a friend over instead of me going to other people's houses.  I'm sick of everyone getting pissed off because I want to take the car to pick up a friend, of getting told no just because I wouldn't go pick up my sister from somewhere last time they asked...  and then there's my friends.  I'm not sure who is siding with who, who will tell so-and-so, or who'll keep everything a secret.  I don't know who's going behind my back and repeating everything I say to someone else, or who secretly hates me but just puts up with me for their own benefit.  I just don't know anything anymore, and I'm scared, and I don't know what to do...  Bethany... I didn't tell her  ANY  of the Ken stuff, and I don't really know why.  I feel like I'm losing her somehow, like she's slipping away from me.  And that scares me more than you'll ever know, because I've already lost too many friends since I started high school, and I can't take losing another one...  And then there's Ken... there's only so much I can talk to him about, because a lot of my current issues involve him...  Which is hard to tell Bethany, because she's never been in a relationship before so she doens't really understand everything.  Lainie's been pretty helpful, and Mande.  And of course Sam, because he shows me things from a guy's perspective.  I just... I don't know.  Every time I think I can confide in someone something happens to fuck it all up...  And now all I truly have is my journal and my blog, and I know from emperience that those things can fall into the wrong hands...  Written words provide tangible evidence, which can be used against you in more ways than you ever thought possible.  Everything just comes back to bite you in the ass...   I don't know... I don't have the energy to write anymore right now.  So I'll just call this 'Part I'

      Yesterday was... In all honestly, I don't really know.  It started off quite boring, b/c I pretty much sat on the computer and did laundry.  I talked to Beth for a little while, but that's about it.  Then around 6:30 my dad dropped me off at Lainie's place of employment, so I hung out there w/ Lainie, Beth, Sarah, Jen, and sarah's lil' sis was there for awhile too.  Sarah, Beth, and I thought it would be fun to stalk the band while they wre out marching, which was quite funny.  Sam and Alex gave us the finger, my sis gave me a dirty look, Hanlon laughed at us, Teagan, Kaylla, and Nick all gave us weird looks, and I believe the rest of the band was just scared b/c we were following them around and 'appearing out of nowhere'  Then after we left Lainie's work we dropped Beth off then Sarah, Jen, and I drove around for awhile.  We went to Sam's to give him his Girlfriend Cookie, but he wasn't home, so then we went to Nick's.  We put a little note on it, went up to his door, rand the doorbell, then handed it in through the partially open door and ran.  As we wre pulling out of the driveway we could see Nick chasing us down the driveway w/ something in his hand, we weren't really sure what it was.  Then we went to give Alex his, but he was somewhere w/ Teagan, so we didn't.  Then we went to J-ville and wandered around Wal-Mart for a bit, then Sarah dropped me off at 10:00.  And then around 11 I texted Lainie, and we texted for over an hour... Then I went to bed b/c I felt like shit.  Ken never called me, so I guess he must've had to work really late... He said he'd probably just spend the night up at the fireworks store most of this week...  Blah... I might not get to see him again until the 5th, which kinda sucks, but at least the 5th will be a day for just me and him, no distractions.  YAY!!!

      Blog number 3...  Maybe I'll get lucky with this one and no one will find it that's not supposed to...  Third time's a charm, right?  On that note -- please don't link my blog to yours anymore, ok?  If it's not linked it'll be harder to find.  You can put it in your favorites or whatever, just not where everyone can see it.  And I won't be linking any blogs to mine.  But yeah...  I feel shitty, and I think that I might've gotten sick from the heat on Sat.  Heat exhaustion or something... idk.  Anyway, I'm gonna go back to playing on neopets (don't laugh).  Later.

      Mom's taking a nap, so I'm allowed to get on the comp... w/e...  I still have to pack, and I have to take my grandma shopping at some point today, plus fill the car w/ gas again so my dad doesn't get mad.  I was supposed to wash it, but who gives a fuck... it'll just get dirty again anyway.  In all honesty I'm too damn lazy to do much of anything... I want to call about my senior pics too, but I don't feel like it right now...  This sucks.  I hate being lazy.

      This may be my last post for a few days, I don't really know.  I doubt I'll have a chance to get on later today (currently 1am), and our flight leaves at 7 something Sunday morning so we need to leave for Milwaukee by 4, so I won't be getting on then...  My dad said I'll probably be able to use his comp while we're there, so I'll update every once in awhile.  Just to let you all know how much fun I'm having, of course.  Trapped in our timeshare w/ my sister while my dad's at work...  Maybe I'll just walk around and look for hot or semi-hot guys to pass the time.  Make a friend or two to hang out w/ for the week...  Sit on the beach, getting some small amount of sun.  We're going to Universal Studios one day and Epcot another.  YAY!  And the best part of it all is -- NO MOM!!!  Of course, she'll probably have Don over while we're gone, but as long as I don't have to listen to them have sex I just don't care anymore... if my mom wants to fuck some random guy then fine.  Our family is already fucked up as it is, why not make everything worse, right?  I mean, there's no way in hell that they don't know about the drinking, yet they still let me go to Robert's all the time.  I don't really think they care all that much.  I don't think they know about the happy smoke, but maybe, idk.  In 4 months I'll be 18 and I'll do whatever the fuck I want and it won't matter.  Not that I don't already, but... They have nothing to threaten me with.  They aren't going to help me pay for college, so they can't take that away.  If they kick me out I'll just go live in a dumpster or something, visit friends every once in awhile.  I'll be fine.  Life sucks, oh well, you get over it.  A year from now I'll be in a completely different state, far enough away that I won't have to deal with my mom and Don and my dad, and Laina, and Kait, and everything else...    but yeah  this post started off happy then I got ranted and got off on a tangent so I'll stop...

      Idk where to start everything... yesterday was a LOOOOONG day... Went to Lainie's around 12:30, hung out there until 4, went home quick, went to Sarah's to pick up pics of Derek, picked up Beth, went over to Robert's, then we went to Winner's Deli to visit Jamie. By then it was like, 5, so we went to the fair and waited for Mande and Lainie to meet up w/ us. WE got piggy tattoos at the Mercy tent, and Robert and I went on the bungee thing. That was awesome. Then Mande and Lainie got there and we went on the Tilt-a-Whirl, then me, Robert, Beth, and Mande went on the Fireball, which was awesome. Then Robert left, and we went and got drinks and stuff, and walked around to all the tents collecting as many stickers as we could. That was cool. Then we went on some more rides and Robert came back and went on some more, then we played the coin game for a little while. We lost Bethy's glasses somewhere... I feel really bad, b/c it's kinda my fault b/c I'm the one that adjusted the hat and knocked them off...  But anyway... we left around 10:30, and Me, Robert, and Beth went back to Robert's. This is where all the fun partying started..... Ordered pizza, and Richie, Andy, Jake, and Derek/Miller Time came over. Derek's cool, Hat Guy/Brian isn't. We played a game of Fuck You. Derek and Jake kept fucking me... I only had to beer bong once during the game, then I did another one later on (which, by the way, I did in like... 3 secs. Robert said stop and I didn't understand what he was talking about, b/c I didn't see how I could be finished already...). I played Duck Hunt, which was cool, b/c I haven't played that in awhile. I sucked at it though... oh well... We played tag in the back yard... Drunken tag is fun, b/c you can't run very well and everyone trips and falls all the time... Except Robert was chasing me and I fell and he tripped over me and landed right on my leg... That hurt like a bitch, then I couldn't walk, so Richie put ice on it, and they carried me inside. So then Richie and I layed on the couch and he put ice on it and we both fell asleep there. And... yeah, Lainie I want to talk to you again about the Richie stuff, b/c... idk, I still have to talk to Robert, but... Anyway, Beth and I left around 8 then fell asleep at her house. Around 11 something mom called me and started bitching me out. Apparently she didn't know I wasn't coming home last night. Wtf? I told her several times... Anyway, then I told her I didn't think I'd be able to take grandma shopping today b/c of my leg, and she yelled at me b/c apparently I should've come home when it happened so she could take me to the hospital. Never mind that it was 3 in the morning, the only thing that was open was the ER, and she probably wouldn't have taken me anyway... I failed to mention to her that I couldn't have driven home anyway b/c I was drunk, but you know... Then she gave me a list of things to do and told me to be home by 12...  Anyway... I got home, slept some, showered, did my chores, called grandma and told her I'd take her to the store tomorrow, then I fell asleep again. Woke up at 9, made some Ramen, Ken texted me so I was texting him back and forth, then I sat in my room until mom left at 11 and now I'm here... I don't really know where she's going, nor do I care, but at least I can get on the comp... w/e... I'm gonna go play some games and read everyone's blogs...

      I hate my comp... oh well, it doesn't matter.&nbsp;   Last night was fun.&nbsp; I picked Beth up at 5:30, then we put air in my tires and went to see Lainie at work.&nbsp; Beth and I went to see Robert for a few minutes so we could talk to him about parties, then we put some stuff in his car and I got Burger King, then we went back to Lainie's.&nbsp; Jamie, Missy, and Jim stopped in, then Jamie came back later on and hung out w/ us until Lainie closed.&nbsp; She took us on a Happy Smoke walk, which surprised me, b/c I thought she despised me w/ every ounce of her being, and you don't share w/ people you hate.&nbsp; But she had a sweet ass one-hitter that looked like a cigarette.&nbsp; Beth got fucked up, b/c she's a lightweight.&nbsp; I just felt good, which was nice.&nbsp; And I got cotton mouth, but that's easy to deal with.&nbsp; Anyway, while Lainie was closing I talked to Race for awhile.&nbsp; He was listening to Jamie and Beth arguing about whether Alaska was part of the continental U.S.&nbsp; That was pretty funny.&nbsp; Anyway, then Jamie, Beth, and I sat there talking until 9:30ish, I dropped Jamie off, then we went back to Beth's.&nbsp; Sat in her living room until 10, then went over to Robert's.&nbsp; Decided to go to Perkin's, and that was fun (of course).&nbsp; When we got back Andy was at Robert's.&nbsp; I walked in the door first, and Andy thought I was Robert so he jumped out from behind the couch and screamed.&nbsp; OMFG he scared the shit out of me...&nbsp; Anyway, we sat and talked at Robert's for awhile.&nbsp; Richie called, and he was drunk, so Andy turned his phone on speaker so we could all hear it.&nbsp; Then around 11:45 Andy and Robert went to Kwik-Trip, and I walked Beth home then went home.&nbsp;   On another random note -- I haven't talked to Ken since Saturday, other than texts Sun and Mon.&nbsp; And surprisingly it hasn't bothered me at all.&nbsp; Like before, if I went 2 or 3 days w/o talking to him, I'd be depressedish and miss him a lot.&nbsp; I still miss him, of course, and I want to talk to him and see him and whatnot, but I'm just so so so happy that it's not bothering me anymore.&nbsp; Like, big step for me kinda thing.&nbsp; I really do think that this two weeks of not seeing each other is going to help A LOT.&nbsp;&nbsp;   But yeah, I'm gonna go shower so I can leave soon.&nbsp; Later!

      I really wanted to go to the fair with Ken, and I wanted to go w/ Sam too, and neither of them are home this week, which really sucks.&nbsp; Part of me doesn't even really want to go, but I will anyway b/c it'll still be fun, and it'll give me something to do.&nbsp; Tomorrow, I suppose, with Lainie and Mande and Bethy.&nbsp; If anyone else shows up that's cool too.&nbsp; Meh.

      I've been thinking about this a lot the past few nights...&nbsp; I mean, I know that I want to grow up more before I get back with Ken, but I've never really thought about  what  growing up actually is.&nbsp; Is it something that I'll just know?&nbsp; Will I just be sitting somewhere one day and out of the blue realize that I've 'grown up' to the point that I want?&nbsp; HOW WILL I KNOW!?!?!?!?&nbsp; In a deperate attempt to grasp a small part of all this, I made myself a general list of some of the things I want to accomplish before I'll consider myself 'grown up' in any sense.&nbsp; The&nbsp;first thing is responsibility --- I want to prove to myself that I can be responsible.&nbsp; I want to get a job and a car, those are both necessities.&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to keep up with my homework, because I slacked off on that a lot last year, and I want to&nbsp;make sure my grades stay up, because&nbsp;I &nbsp;KNOW  that I'm capable, I'm just lacking in motivation and self-determination.&nbsp; I consider myself a fairly reliable person, and I don't think I have much of a problem with reliability, but I want to work on keeping myself organized and rationing out my time so I don't push myself too much or let other people down.&nbsp; I don't know, maybe I'm setting my goals too high here, but I suppose things can be adjusted later...&nbsp; And then there's the whole category of my future.&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to decide for sure what college I want to go to.&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to apply for college, financial aid, scholarships... all that good stuff.&nbsp; Most of the colleges I'm looking at aren't all that cheap, and w/ mom and dad not paying for any of it, I'm going to have to rely a lot on scholarships and financial aid.&nbsp; I don't want to be paying off student loans until I'm 35 like my parents did...&nbsp; Plus I want to be financially independent.&nbsp;&nbsp; Once I graduate I'm going to have to pay for everything by myself... cell phone, gas, car insurance, etc.&nbsp; And of course there's food.&nbsp; I mean, I'm planning on living on Ramen for the most part, and that's less than .10 package,&nbsp; but still...&nbsp; I'm just kinda worried about all that stuff.&nbsp; Graduating in general is just going to be big for me...&nbsp; In all honesty I'm a little scared about what my life is going to be like a year from now.&nbsp; It's going to be weird...&nbsp; but yeah, on top of those two things ^ there's some other personal stuff that I want to work on.&nbsp; Like communication, because I suck at that, especially in relationships.&nbsp; I have a hard time talking about my feelings and expressing when something bothers me, and that's caused quite a few problems for me in the past few years.&nbsp; I also want to work on my self-esteem, b/c having a low opinion of myself is going to negatively affect me in a lot of aspects of my life. *sigh*&nbsp; &nbsp;  I don't really know, but this whole topic is putting me in a bad mood right now, and I just want to be happy, so I'm going to end this.

      I forgot to post about this earlier -- when I saw Jason and Sami at Target I was telling Sami about the party where I got drunk and made out with hat guy.&nbsp; I was talking fairly loudly and said "when&nbsp;I was drunk" at least twice.&nbsp; About 5 mins later I realized that my mom was still about 10 feet away, and had been the whole time.&nbsp; Ooops.... oh well, she never said anything, and if she doesn't know about everything by now then she's just stupid.&nbsp; I've slipped up way to much lately.&nbsp; Like the other day she told me I should drink some more of my blue uv, so we were at hte store and they didn't have lemonade, and I almost said 'that's ok, you can mix it w/ sprite and orange juice and it tastes fine'&nbsp; Yay, go me, I almost opened my big mouth on that one...&nbsp; Oh well, I can't help being stupid.  So basically, there's no way in hell my parents don't have at least SOME idea of what I do.&nbsp; And as far as I'm concerned that's fine as long as they don't keep me from going places.

      I hate being female ^ ...&nbsp; I mean, they aren't as bad as they used to be, so the birth control helped a little, but it's still annoying.&nbsp; I bought Target brand tampons last night... My mom&nbsp;won't go to the W store anymore b/c it's evil, so it's all Target and Shop-ko now.&nbsp;   Speaking of Target and shopping...&nbsp; My mom and I went on another shopping spree last night after we dropped my sister off.&nbsp; I don't know where this money is coming from... I  KNOW  that we don't have this money... My dad's gonna shit when he sees all the receipts... Oh well, it's school shopping and whatnot.&nbsp; Sorta...&nbsp; Anyway, the Dollar Store was having a 79 cent sale, so I got some cool socks and candles and shit.&nbsp; We spent $20 there... go us.&nbsp; Then we ate dinner at Panda Express.&nbsp; Muahahaha, I got my Orange Chicken!!!!&nbsp; After that we went to Target.&nbsp; Found some fun stuff at the $1 Spot (mini stapler/staple remover/tape set, magnets, mini highlighters)&nbsp; Saw Jason and Sami.&nbsp; Found out that they're moving into Gregg's old place, and Gregg's moving to Milwaukee.&nbsp; At least now I know where they live.&nbsp; Poor Sami, having to live w/ Jason.&nbsp; Muahahaha.&nbsp; Then I got some more clothes.&nbsp; A red shirt w/ Ralph on it picking his nose that says "Pick Me"&nbsp; ;)&nbsp; Plus, and here's where it gets good --&nbsp; yes folks it's true,   I   got&nbsp;a skirt.&nbsp; *wiats for the shock to pass* Yes, a skirt.&nbsp; Green.&nbsp; For Homecoming and other random events for which&nbsp;I feel like dressing up.&nbsp; B/c yes, I  do  do that every once in awhile.&nbsp; Infact, I'm in the mood to just dress up and wander around right now...&nbsp;&nbsp;Too bad I'm home alone and don't really feel like showering and calling&nbsp;to see who wants to do something.&nbsp; Maybe in a little while.&nbsp; After lunch or something.&nbsp; All because of yesterday's shopping excursion. Muahahahaha.&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh&nbsp;yeah, I got a hairbrush and chapstick too, but that's not very exciting, is it?  MUAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!&nbsp; I'm so hyper I really need to do something.&nbsp; Maybe I should go to Milton...&nbsp; but I need to go to the gas station first, b/c the pressure on my tires is really low...&nbsp; Lalalalalalalalalalalalalalalala *dances around*&nbsp; The internet gets really boring after awhile.. This isn't fair...

      Yesterday was... interesting.&nbsp; I went w/ my mom up to Fond du Lac to drop the Don guy off... Saw his two kids...&nbsp;On the way back home we stopped at Culver's and slept for awhile... then we went to East Town mall.&nbsp; My mom spent $50 on me at Hot Topic.&nbsp; Camo shoelaces, Happy Bunny keychain, Blink-182 t-shirt, Cold t-shirt, and another shirt about the little men behind my eyes :)&nbsp; Plus the shoes she bought me on Sat and the pants, etc. she's going to buy me tonight... It's early school shopping, but still, I'm getting new stuff and Kait isn't.&nbsp; Only b/c my mom's mad at Kait b/c Kait's being a bitch, and she treats all her stuff like shit.&nbsp; Muahahaha!  Trav wants to have sex with Beth... That's just sick.&nbsp; I swear to god I'll kill myself if he somehow shows up at the party this weekend...

      Kait started asking me questions about Ken today...&nbsp; "Is something wrong w/ you two, I haven't heard much about him lately?" "Did you guys break up?" and whatnot... ARGH... I wanted to kill her.&nbsp; Then she starts telling me how she doesn't really like him.&nbsp; There's 'something about him' that gives her a 'weird feeling' or something like that...&nbsp; She thinks he's too obcessed, especially with the ring and all.&nbsp; She was kinda pissing me off with all the shit she was saying...&nbsp; I mean, I know she's only doing it because she doesn't want to see me get hurt, but still.&nbsp; Does anyone else feel that way?&nbsp; Do you all think Ken is...&nbsp; weird/creepy/whatever?&nbsp; I'm not going to hate you if you tell me that you do, I'd rather you all be honest with me.&nbsp; It won't change my opinion of him, b/c I know how I feel, I'm just curious as to how my friends feel about him...  But anyway... he left for Pennsylvania tonight, and I didn't get a chance to see him.&nbsp; Part of me didn't want to, just b/c of all the stuff that's happened the last few times I've been around him, but now that he's gone I want more than anything to see him, at least to say hi.&nbsp; And now I won't see him until I get back from Fla. on the 8th...&nbsp; 2 weeks from now...&nbsp; I've never gone more than a few days w/o seeing him, and the last time I saw him was Thurs. morning before he left for work.&nbsp; Blah.&nbsp; I feel terrible though, b/c I have been horribly rude/bitter/cold to him since we broke up.&nbsp; I'm using it as my defense mechanism so I don't cry when I can't see him, but it's not fair to him at all.&nbsp; My mind is still set on "You're my boyfriend we need to see each other right now" instead of the "You're my friend hey when can we hang out next?" that it should be on...&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't start crying if I can't see/talk to&nbsp;Bethy or Pookie every day, so why can't I get it in my head not to cry when I can't see Ken?&nbsp; This is so unfair... I can't handle this...&nbsp;   WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH ME????  My mom keeps bringing Ken up all the time too... I can't stand to have them ask me questions all the time.&nbsp; "Are you and Ken back together yet?"&nbsp; "How are you and Ken?" "So are you guys just friends now?"&nbsp;&nbsp; Seriously, LEAVE ME THE FUCK ALONE!!!!&nbsp; They can just mind their own business and let me tell them what I want to tell them, which is pretty much nothing.&nbsp; I talk to my friends about stuff, and that's pretty much it.&nbsp; Mostly Pookie, when it comes to Ken stuff.&nbsp; She's the only one that I showed the letters too, and they only one I really feel comfortable talking to about relationship stuff.&nbsp; Bethy just has no experience w/ relationships so it's hard for her to relate and understand stuff, Mande compares stuff to her and Fred all the time, Crazy Katie is too... light-hearted? about everything, and Sam... I just haven't talked to much lately.&nbsp; Idk...&nbsp; It's just easier to talk to one person anyway, b/c then I don't have to tell the stories over and over again, which drives me absolutely insane...&nbsp;   AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!

      * My grandma called me a fucking bitch after dinner tonight, but only b/c everyone dared her to.&nbsp; It was pretty damn funny, actually.  My mom bought me shoes... black sneakers and blue flip flops.&nbsp; YAY!&nbsp; She's buying me more clothes tomorrow... I talked her into taking me to Vanity to buy some stuff for my senior pics and whatnot.&nbsp; Plus she doesn't mind buying stuff for me b/c she knows I won't lose it, wreck it, or stop wearing it w/in a week like Kait does...&nbsp; Muahahahahaha!  Went to&nbsp;lunch w/ mom and Don.&nbsp; Went to dinner at Red Robin w/ mom, Don, Kait, and grandma.&nbsp; So I haven't really eaten at home all day.&nbsp; This has got to be REALLY healthy for me...&nbsp; Who cares????  In a little while&nbsp;I'm going to post about Ken...&nbsp; b/c I'm in a really bad mood now and I feel like ranting and raving...&nbsp; That's the thing I hate about me and happy smoke, b/c I always get super-depressed the next day... Totally unfair... But I want to play a game first to vent some frustration/confusion/anger/resentment/etc.

      Muahahaha, Robert's was fun last night.&nbsp; Robert was  REALLY  drunk, and it was pretty damn funny.&nbsp;&nbsp; And then he got even funnier after we went outside w/ the Happy Smoke.&nbsp; We played Asshole and Fuck You,&nbsp;and&nbsp;I got pretty drunk, but no where near where I was on Robert's b-day.&nbsp; It was still awesome though.&nbsp; We played&nbsp; Spin-the-Bottle for awhile, but we never really did anything.&nbsp; Me and Andy sat on the couch while Beth, Robert, and Mande (she stopped by for a little while) were in Robert's bedroom.&nbsp; I can't even remember what we talked about... It made no sense whatsoever, and ever 5 mins we were like 'What were we talking about?&nbsp; Where did that come from?'&nbsp; And every time we heard something weird from the bedroom (strange noises or comments) we'd look at each other and be like 'we need to drink more' and then we would, and it was fun :)&nbsp; I think I talked to Andy more last night than I've ever talked to him in all other conversations combined.&nbsp; I asked him if he thought I was crazy -- he said yeah, but in the good way, not that bad way.&nbsp; Then Beth and Robert were geeking out about police and shadows and people chasing them... Robert made us turn off all the lights and hide in the dark in the 'safe corner' of the bunk beds.&nbsp; Andy and I just laughed hysterically, b/c it was pretty&nbsp;damn funny.&nbsp; They were drunk enough that they were loud and stupid, and they were stoned enough that they were hallucinating.&nbsp; Muahahahaha :)&nbsp; But anyway, finally we sort of crashed around 2ish (I slept on the couch w/ Andy... Beth thought it was hilarious), then Beth and I got up at 7:30 so we could leave before Robert's dad got home.&nbsp; Sat in my car for a few mins, then drove to a dif. street and sat there for awhile.&nbsp; Then we went to Burger King, sat there for awhile, and finally came back and sat on a dif. street, where a crazy guy stared at us.&nbsp; Then a little after 9 I dropped her off and came home.&nbsp; Blah.&nbsp; When I got home my mom was in bed and someone was in the shower... and my sis isn't home.&nbsp; WTF?&nbsp; Turns out to be my mom's 'friend' Don who is trying to get a job down in J-ville and spent the night here last night and now she's taking him around town and blah blah blah... w/e, I don't care anymore.&nbsp; If she wants to do things w/ other guys while dad's out of town that's her business, not mine.&nbsp; I'll just stay out of this one...

      I'm finally home from house-sitting!&nbsp; Muahahahaha!&nbsp; It was fun, of course, but I'm just glad to be home.&nbsp; In my own bed.&nbsp; In my own house that doesn't give me sinus attacks.&nbsp; With access to a computer (although it's a bit of a POS...).&nbsp; But anyway... this is just a little overview of how my week went, even though most of you know about it or where there.   Sunday:  Play practice was from 12-3:30ish, and that went ok, although Fred was there, which kinda sucked.&nbsp; Poor Hanlon...&nbsp; Anyway, then Mande and I went to Fran's.&nbsp; Sat in the pool for awhile, which was fun.&nbsp; Played with Goofy for awhile, which was just funny.&nbsp; Then Mande left, and I passed the time idly by unpacking my stuff, making random cards, blah blah blah...&nbsp; Spent the night alone in that creepy house... Fell asleep on the couch, but oh well.   Monday:&nbsp;  Mande came over in the morning and we hung out for awhile.&nbsp; We were supposed to go swimming w/ Lainie, but her mom freaked out (b/c she showered before she cleaned Nick's cage...), so she couldn't come w/ us.&nbsp; So Mande and I went to Taco Bell and the mall instead.&nbsp; That was fun too, b/c I haven't had Taco Bell in awhile,&nbsp; and we looked at all the fun Hello Kitty stuff at the mall.&nbsp; Then we went back to Fran's and played was (3 min game!), then Ken came over and we played cards some more...&nbsp; Then Mande went to babysit and Ken and I hung out for awhile... which didn't go very well, but oh well.&nbsp; Then I went to play prac., then back to Fran's.&nbsp; Lainie and Mande came over and we watched movies.&nbsp; Pookie spent the night.&nbsp; We stayed up until 2 talking about the&nbsp;imaginary rapists Leonard and Luke, bobbing for apples, and random other things..&nbsp;   Tuesday: (The best night of the whole week!)  Pookie and I woke up around 8:45 when Mande got there.&nbsp; Dropped off Lainie's van, then we went to MFR for breakfast, which was yummy :) (even though the creepy cook was flirting w/ us... EWWW!)&nbsp; Went to the park and played, then went to the mall.&nbsp; Then Lainie and Mande went home, then I went to play prac.&nbsp; Made lots of random phone calls in ref. to the bonfire, went to Subway to get dinner and saw Sarah, blah blah blah.&nbsp; Then after play prac. all the fun started. :)&nbsp;&nbsp; I went straight to Fran's.&nbsp; Then Mande and Max got there, and we tried to start the fire but that didn't work.&nbsp; Then Heathy got there, then Robert and Beth, so Robert got to fire started.&nbsp; We sat and made s'mores and talked, then Robert tried to throw someone in the pool and it just went from there... pretty soon everyone was in the pool w/ their clothes on, wrestling and having fun.&nbsp; Sam got dropped off shortly after all the pool stuff started.&nbsp; Then Heathy left, and we hung out in the pool a little more.&nbsp; By the time we were done about half the water was in the grass, and the other half was brownish and filled w/ mud, grass, etc.&nbsp; So we drained the rest of the water, started refilling it, and sat by the fire.&nbsp; Luckily I had other clothes, but everyone else had to stay wet :)&nbsp; Then we had marshmallow fights, then played Red Rover for awhile.&nbsp; Mande and Maz left around 1, and me, Beth, Sam, and Robert sat by the fire until 2ish.&nbsp; Then we went inside and played w/ the magnets, piano, cat, food, etc. until 2:30.&nbsp; Robert burned his socks in the fire then put them on...&nbsp; Then we drove back to Robert's house, and Beth went home to say she was 'home', then snuck back out.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then we stopped at Sam's then went to Perkins, which was really awesome.&nbsp; The sign in front said 'ALL U CAN EAT PUSSY $8.99 FRIDAY 4PM-10PM'&nbsp; I noticed it and started laughing, then pointed it out to the rest of them, and I think we laughed at it for at least 10 mins...&nbsp; Then we went inside and ate and made disgusting things w/ our food.&nbsp; Robert hit his head on the light when we were leaving...&nbsp; We played the crane game, and Robert and I won matching hippos.&nbsp; They've got some pretty damn ugly pants...&nbsp; Then we went to Woodman's to get a camera.&nbsp; Took pics of us in carts, then went back to Perkins to take pics of the sign and the love hippos.&nbsp; We used up all 27 pics in the 1 hour span... Muahahaha.&nbsp; By then it was about 5 and it was getting light out, so we went back to Fran's, talked until almost 6, then crashed until 8.&nbsp; Beth had to babysit, so Robert took her and Sam home, and I fell back asleep for awhile.   Wednesday: The first half of Weds is up there ^.&nbsp; I woke up at about 11 and just sat around idly.&nbsp; Watched a lot of MTV and Fuse.&nbsp; Cleaned up the rest of the backyard from the bonfire.&nbsp; Slept some more, then took a shower.&nbsp; Went to Dress Rehearsal, which went pretty well except for Fred.&nbsp; He had a script in front of him and he still missed some of Jessica's lines... idiot...&nbsp; Then I went back to Fran's.&nbsp; Mande and Ken came over.&nbsp; We watched TV for awhile, then Mande left, and Ken spent the night.&nbsp; That went horribly, but that's a whole different story and I don't want to go into it right now...  Thursday: Woke up at 8ish.&nbsp; Packed up all my stuff, did the dishes, cleaned things up (removed the 'unwholesome' sayings from the fridge), blah blah blah. Watched TV, ate some Ramen noodles.&nbsp; Left a note for Fran, put all my stuff in ny car, then went to Milton.&nbsp; Picked up Beth and went looking for Robert, but we couldn't find him so we called his cell.&nbsp; Turns out he was going camping Thurs night, so the party wasn't going to happen... GRRRRR!&nbsp; Beth, Sam, and I all remembered him saying that Thurs worked better for him b/c Fri night he was going camping... Oh well, it doesn't matter b/c everything's straightened out now...&nbsp; Then I dropped Beth off and went to play.&nbsp; I was surprised, b/c I wasn't really nervous at all when I did my line.&nbsp; I thought I would be, b/c I was alone on the stage w/ the spotlight on me, but it wasn't all that bad.&nbsp; My mom and grandma came to watch, and Ken and Pookie and Jen.&nbsp; Pookie and Mel gave me flowers :)&nbsp; Thanks guys!!!&nbsp; Then me, Heathy, Mande, and Lainie went to Perkins.&nbsp; Had yummy pie, then went home b/c I was tired and I wanted to wash the stage makeup off my face.&nbsp;   So yeah, that's how my week has gone.&nbsp; It's been pretty cool :)&nbsp; I've got the paly again tonight.&nbsp; Beth's gonna come watch.&nbsp; Then we have the party at Robert's.&nbsp; I might go to the cast party for a little bit, but I'm not really sure.&nbsp; I'm not even sure how I'm going to make it to Milton on time tonight b/c my 'wonderful' mother failed to leave me any gas money.&nbsp; She won't be home until prob almost 5:30, then I still have to go to the gas station, pick up Beth, and get to school but 5:45.&nbsp; I don't think I'll make it to Milton on the gas that I have, and I have enough $ for one gallon, which isn't going to help all that much.&nbsp; Grrrr.....&nbsp; Idk, I'll figure things out later.&nbsp;

       I'm so confused right now...&nbsp; I don't know what to do about anything. I just want to curl up in a ball and scream...&nbsp; Ken came over last night.&nbsp; Things were fine for pretty much the whole night - we just played cards and shit - but then I walked with him out to his car.&nbsp; Oiy...&nbsp; I just...&nbsp; had a huge urge to kiss him, and he kissed me back, so it all seemed ok.&nbsp; But then afterwards it was really awkward, and I just wanted to cry...&nbsp; It's not fair.&nbsp; I still love him so much I can't stand it.&nbsp; I miss him when I'm not around him, and even when I am with him I miss being able to be close to him w/o part of me thinking that I shouldn't be doing that.&nbsp; It's not fair...&nbsp; Why does this have to be so hard?&nbsp; After the kiss we sat in his car and talked for a few minutes... neither of us really said much... this is the&nbsp;general idea of it:  &nbsp;  *silence*  Ken:&nbsp; So what do you want to do?  Me:&nbsp; *pause* I don't know...&nbsp; I'm really confused  *long silence*  Ken:&nbsp; Maybe we should try casual dating. More of the playing card games and stuff.&nbsp; We'll put the ring and the bracelet aside.&nbsp; And if you want to date other people, I have to let you. *pause*&nbsp; Because I know that's part of what this is, you want to experience other people.  Me: *pause*&nbsp; I don't know... maybe.  Ken:&nbsp; Will you think about about it?  Me:&nbsp; Yeah.  Ken:&nbsp; Ok. I'll call you tomorrow.  &nbsp;  Then I got out of the car and barely made it into the house before I started crying, which was absolutely fabulous...&nbsp; Ken forgot his phone and&nbsp;when he came back to get it I think it took me at least 2 mins to answer the door b/c I tried pretty much successfully to stop crying.&nbsp; Then I got ready for bed and stared at the wall thinking for an hour before I fell asleep...&nbsp; I don't really know what to do.&nbsp; I don't know if&nbsp;the casual dating thing will work out.&nbsp; It's just... Idk.&nbsp; I'm afraid that I'll get too involved and it won't stay casual.&nbsp; And I really do think I need this break.&nbsp; As much as I love Ken and have no idea what I'd do if I lost him, I think I need to be single for awhile at least.&nbsp; I want to stay friends with Ken though, which is the really hard part...&nbsp; Every time I'm around him I just want to cuddle and kiss him and just... be happy, I guess.&nbsp; And I know it's somewhat the same for him, at least on some level.&nbsp; And all of this makes being 'just friends' extremely difficult.&nbsp; Oiy... I think that the only way we can make this work is to try to distance ourselves in some way.&nbsp; Not by not seeing each other, b/c I don't think I could handle that, but... maybe just hang out in groups, at least for awhile.&nbsp; If there's other people there then all of my attention won't be focused on just him.&nbsp; I hope...&nbsp; Maybe us both going on vacation is a good thing.&nbsp; He's leaving for Pennsylvania on Sat and won't come back until the day I leave for Florida, so we'll have 2 weeks of not seeing each other, and probably&nbsp;not much&nbsp;talking to each other.&nbsp; Maybe that will help in some way... And then when we're both back we can just hang out during group things for awhile... And then school will start so my mind will be occupied a lot more so it'll be easier for me to think about him less often.&nbsp; And then hopefully we'll both get to a point where we can hang out just the two of us w/o everything being awkward.&nbsp; There's so many 'if's in that though...&nbsp; And I don't know how he feels about any of it b/c most of it just came to my head last night or this morning.&nbsp; *sigh* Idk what I'm going to do... I guess I'll talk to him tonight or tomorrow night, see how he feels about all of this.&nbsp; We can discuss the casual dating thing too, but I just don't know how well that would work out...&nbsp; ARGH!

      Ok, this is just my rough sketch of this week's schedule.&nbsp; Heathy calls Tues or Thurs (if you don't call me I'll call you).&nbsp; Except for the bonfire night I should prob. only have 1 or 2 people over at a time.&nbsp; If you want to come over just call me, it's all good.&nbsp; I'll be there most of the time, except when I'm at play prac., visiting Lainie, or doing something random.&nbsp; If you need a ride I can prob pick you up.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Sun - Mande during the day, no one overnight yet  Mon - Lainie Tues - bonfire :)  Weds - no one yet  Thurs - no one yet  Fri - no one yet  &nbsp;  Oh yeah, one other thing -- I probably won't be able to update my blog this week b/c Fran's computer doesn't work.&nbsp; I won't be able to read anybody else's blog either, unless I go home for awhile or go to the internet cafe or something.&nbsp; So yeah.&nbsp; Limited internet for Brit :)&nbsp; That just means I'll spend all my free time reading or playing card games or something.  &nbsp;  But yeah... that's about it, so I'll see y'all this week sometime.

      Muahahaha, I just woke up from my nap :)&nbsp; I got home from the car wash around 2:30ish and I fell asleep by 3 and didn't wake up until a little after 5.&nbsp; I'm still kinda tired but I can sleep tonight, so it's all good.&nbsp; The car wash was... ok.&nbsp; I was the first person there, so I sat in the parking lot for 5ish mins w/ the seat back and listening to music before Fran got there.&nbsp; Then we went in to talk to the guy that was there and they had NO idea what was going on... So&nbsp;the wonderfully smart 'general manager' that I talked to failed to mention the car wash to anyone else... I knew he was stupid when I talked to him, but oh well...&nbsp; Anyway, we got stuff worked out and everything set up all right.&nbsp; There were only a few people there -me, Mande, Jon, Annie, and Meghan, then Sam came at 10 and Heathy around 1:30ish.&nbsp; Some peope *coANNIEugh* were being a bit bitchy and rude the entire time.&nbsp; Mande and I were talking about it -- don't you think that you should prob. NOT be super rude to your captains?&nbsp; They have a little more power than you.&nbsp; Dur.&nbsp; But anyway, overall things went fairly well, despite the poor weather and lack of help.&nbsp; I'm&nbsp;not really sure how much we made, but it wasn't as much as last time.&nbsp; We has mushroom pizza for lunch, that was good.&nbsp; Now I'm hungry again though... &nbsp; My mom still isn't home...&nbsp; She got to Pizza Hut shortly before I left so she could eat, then she was going to run a bunch of errands and come home... She's getting me some snack foods and soda and shit to take with me to Fran's.&nbsp; Speaking of that -- I'll put up a little schedule later of all the days, who's coming when, what's going on what day, etc.&nbsp; All that stuff.&nbsp; For now I'm just going to play games on MSN to amuse myself...

      I'm so freaking tired...&nbsp; Like, I just want to pass out on my bed for a few hours, but I'd rather write in here for awhile first so I can vent a little bit.&nbsp; And I wish I had my cell phone, but I left it at Robert's and I'm too lazy/tired to go back and get it... So blah.&nbsp; Anyway, this is how everything has gone... b/c last night was kinda bad.&nbsp; At least one specific part of it... &nbsp; Went to visit Lainie at work around 5:30 ish, then went to play prac.&nbsp; Idk if it was hot in there or what, but I kinda took a downhill slide and felt shittier after I'd been in there for about 15 mins.&nbsp; Then I went to do my line and I talked to fast and couldn't remember a little part and I wasn't authoritative enough and blah blah blah...&nbsp;&nbsp;Church was grumbling, and it wasn't even like it was a big deal or anything, but I&nbsp;was ready to snap on him.&nbsp; That or just run out of the&nbsp;room crying...&nbsp; I was so fucking emotional... grrrr..... &nbsp; But yeah, prac got done at 8:45ish, then I went over to robert's.&nbsp; Him,&nbsp;Beth, Sam, Andy, and&nbsp;Jake were already there playing&nbsp;badminton in the backyard.&nbsp; So we hung out there for awhile, then we went inside and ordered pizza.&nbsp;&nbsp;We sorta just watched TV and waited for the pizza to come.&nbsp;&nbsp;Jenny and AJ both showed up.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Jake and Jenny left to go get some guy and came back with 2... hat guy and no hat guy.&nbsp; Brian and Derek.&nbsp; Minty Fresh (bad story behind that, I wish I hadn't heard it) and Miller Time.&nbsp; Call them whatever you want...&nbsp; hat guy was the sorce of all of my problems.&nbsp; Anyway,&nbsp; a little while after Robert's dad&nbsp;left we started drinking.&nbsp; We played a game called Fuck You, and that was pretty damn fun.&nbsp; Everybody fucked everybody, isn't that your idea of a good time?&nbsp; It got me pretty damn drunk... I was fine until I had to do the bong, and that's when things started to go downhill.&nbsp; But first -- how come no one went in the kitchen to watch when Robert bonged it, but when I had to the whole fucking party followed me into the kitchen?&nbsp; I hate audiences... Beth said it's b/c I'm a girl... Does that make it funnier or something?&nbsp; Idk...&nbsp; But I did it no problem, and about 5 mins later I was pretty far gone...&nbsp; And this is where my details start to get vague... B/c I can't really remember everything that happened, the order it happened it, or who was there...&nbsp; Anyway, we went outside w/ Beth's pipe and passed that around for awhile.&nbsp; Then all of a sudden I was hanging all over hat guy and he was doing the same...&nbsp; Then we fell on the grass and made out a little bit... that was pretty gross, b/c he tasted like beer (although I imagine that I did too), and he was a bad kisser.&nbsp; The main point of the story is that little asshole was hanging on me all night and I was too damn drunk to care and I guess it got bad enough that Andy was making comments to Beth and him and Beth and Richie and Idk who else were all watching hat guy so he wouldn't do anything.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's kinda reminiscent of the Christmas party at Gregg's...&nbsp; There I had Amanda, Gregg, Jim, Missy, and god knows who else watching me to keep other stuff from happening...&nbsp; But yeah...&nbsp; lots of&nbsp; "Zirkels of Love" w/ everyone dancing in a big circle in the kitchen.&nbsp; I have crazy bruises on my feet from people stepping on me.&nbsp; Plus one on my hand that appeared out of no where, and one on my arm where Sam bit me...&nbsp; But then Beth and I left around 2:30 to go back to her house... to get away from the crazy hat guy...&nbsp;NO MORE PARTIES WITH HAT GUY!&nbsp; If I ever go to a party and hat guy is there I'm leaving, I swear to god.&nbsp; &nbsp;Oiy... I don't want to go into any more details about last night, if you know about it you know about it, otherwise too bad.&nbsp; Lainie I might call to tell you some random things... Ken I might tell some stuff, just b/c I think we both need to work on the 'getting over our physical and emotional attachments' thing...&nbsp; We both have a problem with that right now...&nbsp; Anyway, that's a bit off topic. Now to today... &nbsp; Beth and I got up around 9:15ish.&nbsp; I put my contacts in, we drank a glass of water, filled some water balloons (w/ intent to throw them at hat guy if he was still at Robert's), then walked over to Robert's.&nbsp; Instead we put the balloons under Robert's car tires (muahahahaha!!!) the peeked in the window to see if anyway was awake and walked inside... Saw Robert sleeping on the couch.&nbsp; Poked him until he woke up.&nbsp; Then we went in to see Sam, and the 4 of us sat in the living room talking.&nbsp;&nbsp; Blah blah blah, that was fun, luckily hat guy was gone before we got there though.&nbsp; And eventually everyone else that was still there woke up and we just sat in the living room and watched TV and talked.&nbsp; Robert made pancakes and french toast.&nbsp; Watched more TV, then people started to leave...&nbsp; Around 2:30 it was just me, Robert, and Andy, and I was getting tired, so I left.&nbsp; When I got home&nbsp;I realized I'd left my cell phone at Robert's house... Go me...&nbsp; Oh well, I just called it and told him to take it and the disco ball over to Beth's, and then I can get my phone from Beth some time this weekend.&nbsp; So yeah, don't bother calling it unless you'd like to hold a conversation with Robert. :)&nbsp; And now I'm going to do a few more things then take a nap.&nbsp; Then I'll shower, change, make the car wash posters, and probably by then Ken will be here... It's already 4, and he said he got off at either 6 or 8, so...&nbsp; Idk.&nbsp; Argh, I just need to crash.&nbsp; Later.

      Yesterday I wa pretty much glued to the couch watching MTV and music videos all day...  I was pissed about the Fugliest Rock Star thing -- they said Chad Kroeger was fugly, and I don't really think he is but I guess you could see it that way, but THEN they tried to tell me that Sully Erna (Godsmack) was fugly!  He is  NOT  fugly.  He's pretty damn sexy if you ask me, but maybe it's just b/c I like that type... Tatoos, piercings, slightly demonic appearance...  But anyway.. .  I got up at 8:30 yesterday and other than getting up to get a glass of water, take some ibuprofen, get the phone, or go to the bathroom, I didn't get up until 6, and that was only to go plant my ass on my bed instead.  I slept for like... 5 hours during the day, then I went to bed at 9:30 and didn't wake up until 11 this morning... YAY!  But I'm starting to feel better.  I was actually able to eat last night.  My dad brought me home stuff from Noodles at 8ish, and I ate almost the whole thing, and the only reason I stopped was b/c it made me full (Tues all I ate was 15 little seashell noodles and a small piece of cantelope, Weds all I'd eaten before the Noodles was 3 olives and 2 pieces of cantelope...).  And I'm actually able to go 5 or 6 hours w/o taking more ibuprofen, instead of wanting to take 4 every 4 hours...  And now I can drink a glass of water/iced tea in 15 mins instead of 2 hours or not at all...  So yeah, I see it as an improvement.  I'm actually going to go to play prac tonight, both b/c I think I feel up to it and b/c I've already missed three and I don't want to miss any more.  If people are gone I'm not sure how long I'll be able to read their parts for b/c talking/laughing/etc. for extended periods of time makes my throat hurt more.  But anyway, after prac. I'll probably end up going to the party at Robert's, although I don't think I'll drink.  If Beth even brings the alcohol, b/c she told me she wasn't really sure she was going to.  I def. won't do the beer bong b/c that's shraing of germs and I don't want to make anyone sick.  No spin-the-bottle for me either...  Oh well...  Anyway, I have some more I want to write about but I'll do that later or tomorrow.

      The 4N6 meeting was short, but then I had to go over to Fran's so she could show me around her house and whatnot.  I start house sitting on Sunday, so if someone wants to claim Sunday night just call me.  We can eat popcorn, watch movies, play w/ the fat cat, build a fire, whatever...  She's got a little pool too, so we can go swimming...  It shall be fun :)  I have 5 or 6 nights, and people can come ovr during the day too, so...  I'll talk to everybody at the car wash on Sat. if I don't call you sometime this week.    I'm so freaking hungry, but I can't eat anything w/o wanting to scream.  I want Taco Bell soooooooooooo fucking bad...  There's no way in hell I could swallow that that.  I hope I feel better by Thurs, I don't want to miss my pics and Robert's b-day thing and all that fun stuff.  I get to see Ken tonight after he gets off work... I'm not sure how it's going to go, b/c we haven't talked since saturday.  He read my blog and posted a comment, plus we've texted back and forth a little. I suppose I probably would have answered last time he called if I could actually talk.  I don't know how well tonight is going to go, but...  *crosses fingers*  I hope we can work everything out.    But yeah, I'm gonna go take some more ibuprofen and see if I can find some soft food to force down my throat.

      When I FINALLY got home at 10:15 last night after running around to god knows how many places I just crashed in my bed...  The PA at Urgent Care said I have strep...  The rapid strep test came back neg, but she said it looked exactly like strep to her, so she gave me amoxicillin anyway.  She's going to call me to tell me for sure as soon as the other results get back from the lab... Blah this really really sucks.  I can't swallow at all (go ahead and laugh, my sis laughed at that too -- that's NOT how I meant it), and I still can't talk very much.  I'm gonna go to the 4N6 meeting today, but I doubt I'll go to play practice.  If I can't talk I'm not much help am I?  Plus I'm prob contagious, so I don't want to make the rest of the cast sick.  Otherwise they'd all be gone on the days of the play, so I'd be the only healthy person, and I'd have to run madly around the stage trying to play all of the characters...  Oiy...    but yeah, Mande's on her way here, so I g2g.  Poo-head I'll talk to you tonight, Pookie I'll call you if I feel better, and Bethy I'll call you tomorrow, k?

      Oiy vay, I figured out why I couldn't log in to anything earlier today... My mom disabled cookies last night when she was on the comp.. WTF???  Oh well, everything's fixed now, so it's all good.  Anyway...  sorry I haven't really been answering calls/talking long/calling when I said I would.  My voice won't go above a whisper at the present time.  I'm going to Urgent Care to get a strep test and whatnot, but I have be dragged to Milton for my sis's 4-H picnic thing first.  So Pookie, I might be able to stop in and see you at work *crosses fingers*  umm... Bethy I might call you tomorrow otherwise I'll just wait until you call on Weds, and I'll see you on Thurs.  Sam... idk if you read this or not, but we really need to talk.  So I'll call you as soon as I get my voice back.  Plus we can go to the gym then too, before you go on vacay, b/c I'll be leaving for Fla. shortly after you get back, and by then it'll be almost the middle of August...  Other things...  Ken I'll try to call you back when I get home tonight I'm not sure what time it will be or how much I'll be able to talk but I'll give it a try.  Mande I'll see you tomorrow at 9:15 are we supposed to bring anything or is she going to have all the cleaning supplies?  EEEEEK...  I need to stop spazzing and mom's ready to go so I'll talk to everyone w/in the next few days. Later.

      Heathy and I went to Frostee Freeze at 6ish.  That was fun, and I got my banana split that I've been craving for god knows how long.  Plus I got out of the house and occupied my mind a little...  I was talking to Jorge earlier and I said something about 'my ex' and I didn't even realize it until I went back and read what I'd written.  That was kinda weird, and it kinda made me cry a little b/c the word 'ex' has such a negative connotation and it doesn't feel entirely appropriate for me to use it in this situation...  Idk...  I have to clean up my room tonight, and fold my laundry...  Mom bought me some new clothes yesterday, a new purse, new flip flops, plus a charm bracelet.  One of those add-a-link things.  There's a Happy Bunny charm at Claire's that I want to get for it once I get more money.  They had these cute little stuffed green and purple frogs at Kohls too, I want to get one of those too, they were soft and cuddly.  So were the little hedgehogs.  And I saw Nicole Petroff.  I didn't realize that she still worked there...  But yeah, that's been the small amount of 'Bright Side' to my entire weekend...  Hopefully tomorrow is decent.  Play practice is going to suck b/c I can't really talk above a normal tone... stupid sore throat.  Mom was going to take me to Urgent Care, but what will they do?  Tell me my throat hurts, give me some pain pills, and tell me to go home.  Come back if it's not gone in a week.  So why don't I just wait and go in a week if I still have it?  I'll just keep taking ibuprofen...  ARGH.  Life sucks.  Hardcore.

      So this... this is going to be a REALLY long post.  I can guarantee it won't make sense...  This is for for me, so I can organize my thoughts; Ken, so I can explain EVERYTHING; and for everyone else who cares enough to read the whole thing...  I'm not really sure where to start this.  There isn't really a definite beginning..  Idk, I'll start w/ when Ken called me while I was at the mall...  By then I'd already had it made up in my mind that I was going to tell him everything that night.  Then he started telling me about how shitty his past two days had been, and all the bad things that had happened, and I wasn't really focusing much on the convo b/c my mind was 8000 miles away from anywhere, just mumbling replies every now and then...  And then when he hung up he didn't say I love you, which I think is the first time he hasn't in a long time, and I wanted to cry b/c I knew that he knew, and then I felt REALLY bad for wanting to dump all of this on him on top of his super shitty past few days...  So anyway, then I texted Lainie and told her that I felt bad for doing it that night, and she called me back a little later and I vented on her for a few minutes but she had to get back to work so I didn't really accomplish much I just told her I'd call her tomorrow...  So then I went home and I think I was home for like, 2 mins before Ken got there, and I was sitting on my bed about 2 sesconds from hysterical sobbing and I didn't know what to do...  I couldn't look at him knowing that he knew...  And all the words had totally evaporated from my mind.  I really didn't know why to say, I just kept my face on my pillow and tried to keep myself from crying...  Then I finally managed to semi- look at him, and he told me that he was pretty sure he knew what was coming, and he was just waiting to hear it.  The tone in his voice... he just sounded so upset, and that made me cry...  then he gave me a note that he'd written and went to the bathroom.   No way in hell would I have been able to read it in front of him, so I went outside and sat in the rocks on the side of the house, reading and crying and ignoring the mosquitos...  The letter hurt a lot, b/c... some of it was right, but some of it was totally wrong, as far as how I felt and why I wanted to break up with him...  And I wanted him to know that, but there was no way I could tell him that night.  And that's what he said in the letter too, that if I broke w/ him that night he wouldn't be able to talk about it and he'd want to leave right away.  Anyway... then I came back inside and leaned up against the wall next to him, and all I could say was "I don't know how to phrase it," and he said something like "I don't know why you have to find the right words to just say it"...  And... god, the tone of his voice... he sounded so.. hurt... angry... upset... The way he said it hurt me more than anything had the whole night, and I just blurted out "it's not just breaking up, there's so much more to it" and then I started sobbing and couldn't stop...  then he started crying too and I felt so horrible and I wished more than anything everything in life could just be perfect and fair...  Then he said that he was going to leave, and he'd call me later, and that he wanted me to write down what I wanted to say to him...  So I just wrote down my blog URL and gave that to him, told him that he could find a lot of stuff here...  I'm not sure that was the best idea, b/c all of the older stuff is missing,  plus...  I'm not really sure what I've said about him on here.  Nothing bad, I know that, just...  stuff I might've said out of frustration or something...  But I can't hide from shit anymore...  I'm honest with everything else in my life, this was the last piece of the puzzle.  He has every right in the world to know everything I've ever felt.  But yeah... after he walked out of my room I threw myself down on my bed and curled up under my covers and sobbed for god knows how long... Kait came in and wouldn't leave me alone "is something wrong brit?  is there something wrong?  what's wrong?  is it something with your friends?  with ken?" and she wouldn't fucking go away...  Finally I kicked her out and just sat in my room crying...  I couldn't find any Kleenex, so I had to use a roll of toilet paper...  I turned on music b/c music always helps me... Of course the first CD that came on was Evanesence...  That makes me cry anyway, so it just pretty much kept me crying,  but I was too stupid to change the CD... Then I texted Lainie to call me when she got home from work, then I started throwing things around my room...  so it's pretty much trashed right now... then I dumped all my journals all over the floor and got all my Ken stuff and put it in that box and shoved it under my bed...  The ring, the bracelet, v-day card, the pic of us w/ the tiger, the handcuffs, the letter (the only letter I've gotten from him in 7 months, and it was about breaking up), other stuff... everything that reminded me of him, b/c I couldn't look at it without crying...  The only thing I left out was the giant monkey, b/c it was comforting sorta.  B/c like, after I'd trown everything in the box I just wanted more than anything to hug him and cry, so I hugged the monkey instead...  Then Lainie called me a little after 10 and we talked for over an hour, and by the end of the convo I felt a bit better...  She offered to let me come over to her house, but I didn't have a way there, so it didn't really matter.  Then I tried to eat ice cream, b/c ice cream is an awesome comfort food, but I hate vanilla, and all we had was nasty tasting chocolate stuff...  Then when I hung up w/ her I was going to watch a movie, but the only movie that sounded good at the time was Sleepless in Seattle, which A) is Ken's; and B) last time I watched it was with him.  So I ruled that out, and figured that I'd just force myself to sleep instead.  Which actually worked fairly well, most likely thanks to the convo w/ Lainie calming me down a lot...  Before I fell asleep I texted Ken... apologizing for the way things had gone, and asking him to read my blog when he got a chance... then he called me, and I couldn't answer it... I hit the silence button after the first ring, then I stared at my phone for another ring, then threw it on my bed an rolled over on my side...  waited until the phone message alert beeped then listened to my voicemail...  then fell asleep...  any now today is a new day, and I haven't really done much all day...  Crazy Katie and Beth called wanting me to come over to Robert's, but I'm not really in the mood to hang out with anyone...  Lainie said she'd call me tonight.  And Ken said he'd call me today, but... idk if I can.  I'll probably just ignore his calls for a few days, until Tues or Weds maybe...  I need to get drunk so bad right now...  but I have neither money nor alcohol at the moment...  ARGH.... what's it going to do anyway?  I'll have a few hours of happy time, then everything just comes back anyway...  But now... the rest of this...  that ^ was the how, this is the why.  This is everything, folks...  100% why I feel the way I do and why I did what I did, so repeated some new, depending on who you are... here goes... mostly addressed directly to Ken...  Ken I love you so much I don't know how I can make you see that... I didn't do this b/c I hate you, I did this for so many reasons it's going to take me hours to write it all...  First off, the letter -- you were right and wrong, as far as the ring goes.  Yes, it did scare me, b/c suddenly it put ideas in my head that I never realized I'd think about this early in my life...  Just... commitment in general, especially.  I'm too immature to think about that right now, not on any level.  I still need to grow up and figure myself out.  I kinda described this in my "Ken and Sam" post...  I just feel... inferior as far as experience and maturity level go, and I don't think that's a healthy thing to have in a relationship.   I'd be a much better person, friend, girlfriend if I could just grow up and experience the world around me.    And I'm so sorry that I never told you these things right away, it was just that...  all of my friends seemed so excited and happy for me, and you just seemed so happy... I didn't want to ruin that.  I didn't want to burst everyone's happiness bubble...   And then in that first week everything hit me so hard and I overreacted to a lot of things and I just kept digging myself deeper and deeper into a hole I had no way to get out of.  And in a way breaking up kind of threw me a rope to get out of that hole, but now I'm in a completely different hole, and this time I have no one to hold and be with...  But I suppose that's what I get for being selfish and wanting to 'try out' other people before I commited myself to one person.  And I'm terrified that when I grow up and finally prove to myself that it is you that I want to be with, you won't be there anymore.  And it'll be no one's fault but my own, and that'll only make it harder to deal with...  But I suppose there's nothing I can do but wait and live life the way it is right now...  Besides the ring, age difference, maturity level things...  Those were the main reasons I need the break from you.  There's everything with me wanting to date other guys before I commit myself to one person...  And I know that it sounds selfish and horrible, like trying on clothes at the store and just returning the ones that you don't want...  You find something you love, but then you want to try a few other things before you buy it...  You can put a hold on it and leave it at the layaway counter, but that's not fair to all the other shoppers.  But if you put it bak on the rack, there's always a chance someone else will come along and snatch it up...  Oiy, I know that was a horrible analogy, but I'm not really thinking a whole lot right now, just typing.  And then there's other stuff.  Little stuff, pretty much stuff that's just in the back of my mind, but random things nonetheless.  Things that we need to addressed if we get back together sometime in the future.  And some of this is my fault, simply b/c I can't talk about things very well and I'm not very good at voicing when things are wrong...  First is the emotional vs. physical thing.  I know we've talked about this several times, and every time I bring it up you would get better about it for awhile, but then after a while things would go back to kinda like what they had been before.  Never as bad as it was in the beginning, but back nonetheless, and after awhile I just gave up on bringing it up.  It was extremely unfair of me to expect you to entirely change yourself for me, b/c there are some things abut me I wasn't and still am not willing to change about myself for you.  Like the blowjob thing, b/c I know that no matter how many times you said it didn't bother you that it really did.  You made enough comments that I picked up on that quite quickly...  but as far as that goes...  I know that it's something that I can get over eventually, but bj's in general are just nasty.  Maybe some people find drinking salt water to be appealing, but it's not very high on my list.  And I know that there's the whole 'reciprocity' thing -- you do this to me, I do that to you, blah blah blah, but...  Tell me, at any time did I even ASK you to do anything to me?  Everything you've done was upon your own free will.  I mean, of course I enjoy those type of things, but I'm perfectly happy without them, as I've tried to explain to you.  Especially when we're at my house, b/c there's too much of a chance of getting caught.  I really don't like the idea of my parents accidentaly walking in on something or coming downstairs and seeing something they don't need to see.  They'd lose respect for me, and they probably would have prevented me from seeing you as much too.  And as long as I'm living in this house there isn't a whole lot I can do about what they think of me.  It's a little late now, but I'd be so much happier if they were pretty much clueless as to what I do with boys.  I'd rather have them thinking all we do is play cards, watch movies, have water fights in the backyard, etc.  Which would actually be quite fine w/ me if that were pretty much all that happened anyway.  But I've said that countless times before, and if you haven't figured it out yet I don't know how else to explain it to you.  If that bothers you a lot maybe you should have brought that up to me every time I told you how I felt...  As far as sex itself goes... that was never a problem.  You are always so patient, and you never tried to talk me into anything.  You have no idea how much more that made me love you.  I know how much you wanted to have sex, yet you never brought it up unless I brought it up first, and never got mad or defensive or whatever whenever I gave you a reason why we couldn't at that time.  Thank you so much.    So yeah... that was that.  Please don't think the sex and stuff were the reason I broke up with you, bc they weren't.  I really do think that I need to a break to let myself grow up, and I hope to god that you'll see that eventually and not hate me for all of this.  And hopefully in a few days I'll be able to talk to you, and we can talk some of this stuff out w/o either of us freaking out (most likely me).  And hopefully none of this will be a problem later on, and eventually I'll be better at communication.  So I guess I'll leave you with one final message and quit typing, b/c I've been writing this for over 2 hours and I imagine it's getting to be a bit long...  I never meant to hurt you like this...  I didn't want to be the one to come out and say it directly.  I wanted you to see all of this ^ and see why I feel the way that I do.  I wanted you to understand and agree with me that breaking up is a good idea for right now.  I wanted everything to be as close to a mutual agreement as possible...  I hope you believe me when I say that I really don't want this break up to be forever.  Just a break, time for me to discover myself.  I don't know how long I need...  6 months?  a year?  two years?  All I can do is hope that we can stay friends throughout that time, and that when I am ready you're still available...  I love you poo-head.

      Last night I was forced to go to a Mary Kay party that was supposed to start at 7/7:30ish, but my  lovely  mother wasn't even ready to leave the house until almost 8.  Then we didn't leave until after 10:30, which was simply  fabulous  b/c I was tired, bored, irritable, and in pain (sore throat/earache, both on left side).  OF COURSE it was at her friend's house, and she had to just chatter endlessly...  Then I got home and took meds and sat in my bed in a fairly pissed off mood.  Ken had called me at 7 to see if I was back from my 'kidnapping', but dur, I hadn't even left yet.  So he was going to go to Orfordville after he got off work and then when he got back he was going to call me and make me watch him light off fireworks or whatever.  I wasn't listening all that intently to the conversation...  Anyway, 11 rolls around and he  STILL  hasn't called me, so that didn't help my mood much, b/c there was no way in hell I was still going to go out anywhere that late feeling like I did.  Plus I was pissed off b/c after reading Lainie's comment on one of my posts, plus random other little things, I felt like I had my thoughts collected enough to tell Ken   EVERYTHING  .  And now, of course, I wasn't going to get to see him.  So I just texted him 'Im going 2 bed.  we need 2 talk 2m' and hoped I'd be in the mood for it tomorrow.  Then I got ready for bed, and about 20 mins later, right before I turned off my light at whatnot, I texted him again 'I meant what I wrote in the letter', I don't really know why I texted him  that , I was just in a sharing mood and figured I'd take advantage of it...    Oh yeah -- my mom talked to Fran and everything is good w/ the house sitting thing. :)  They talked for like, 20 mins, and my mom won't tell me what they talked about b/c she said she told Fran she wouldn't.  They doesn't really sound good, does it?  And then there were my mom's replies... "Don't worry about that, she likes vodka" and "I'll check her luggage before she leaves"   Hmmm.. comforting, isn't it?  Anyway, she told me that Fran's going to talk to me after the 4N6 meeting on Tues. and give me all the details and whatnot.  So yeah, sometime next week I'll talk to everyone about spending the night and whatnot.  Today's probably going to suck for most of the day...  I have an eye appt. at 1, but it's supposed to be really short.  Ashley's grad party starts at 12, so I'm just going to go after my eye appt... I didn't RSVP, but I don't think it'll matter, b/c I'm just going to stop by and say hi anyway...  I have to go shopping w/ my mother at some point today, so she can buy me a new outfit for my senior pics...  And today's my grandma's b-day, so we'll probably all go out for dinner...  And  then  I'll get to talk to Ken tonight, which will be one big fucking party...  If he doesn't come over tonight I think I'm going to just snap.  Rattle everything I want to say off in one big long sentence over the phone.  I can't deal with this anymore, honestly...  notfairnotfairnotfair...  *runs headfirst into a cement wall*

      Went to Subway w/ Lainie.  Talked about boys and parents, that's about it.  And scaring people, b/c that's always fun :)  Then we walked down to Pier 1, b/c neither of us had been to this one yet, and Lainie didn't really want to go home.  We picked out all the stuff that we'll eventually have for our houses... :)  Themed rooms of course, b/c that's the best way :)  Then we sat in my driveway listening to music and fogging up the windows until Lainie had to go home.  Muahahahaha!    Anyway, dad's home and I'm bored, so I'm gonna go in my room.  I still need to give him an answer on whether or not I'm going to Florida w/ him and Kait. Should I?  The idea of being alone in the hotel room/timeshare w/ Kait while he's working doesn't seem all that appealing to me, but beaches and whatnot.... Hmmmm...  Idk, he needs and answer by tonight, so I suppose I'll figure it out.  Anyway, later!

      Fran just called me...  She wants me to house sit for her while she's on vacation...  Like, feed her cat and stuff, plus she said I could stay at her house the whole time.  And she said she knew that it'd probably be creepy sleeping at her house alone, especially sinc it's out in the countryish, so I could have a friend or two over at night if I wanted.  No big parties or large groups, but she has a fire pit in her backyard (s'mores!) and all that fun stuff.  So idk... I mean, it'd be cool and all, and it'll give me a chance to get some money.  Plus I'll have my dad's car that week, so it'll be easier to get back and forth from Milton and whatnot, b/c I've got play stuff all that week...  But all of this is dependent on whether or not my wonderful mother agrees to it...  I talked to my dad, and he didn't really seem to care, but he's going to be out of town for the next three weeks so...  Idk, I think my mom will eventually go for it, it just might take a little convincing.  And I don't think she'll let me stay over the whole time, but w/e...  So yeah, if I get to do this, who thinks they'll be able to spend a night or two with me?  Bethy? Lainie? Mande? Nicole? Heathy? Sam? Mystery Person?  I think I'll have.. 5 nights?  I can't remember exactly what she said...  Anyway, I'm just gonna sit and wait for Lainie to call to see if her mom is spazzing or not... Hopefully not, b/c I really do want to talk to her in person about all this Ken stuff...

      I'm just going to rant about my two main problems at the moment...  This whole Sam thing... I just don't know what to do anymore.  I love him to death and I don't want to lose him, but...  He told Mande that I don't put enough effort into our friendship, and apparently Hayley was at his house the day he and I were fighting b/c she knew about everything and said something to Heathy about it at work.  Plus she thinks that I've never liked her, which isn't true.  I just never  KNEW  her, and the only thing that I did know about her was that Sam is always talking about her, and that is seems like he's hanging out with her all the time.  And that just makes me feel like shit, b/c I feel like I'm losing him, and I don't want that.  It just doesn't make sense to me how everything could go from the way it was last summer to the way it is now...  And I'm not saying that it isn't partially my fault, but in no way am I willing to take all of the blame.  I mean, I know I haven't called him much, but then again I haven't really called anyone a whole lot.  Beth and I call each other back and forth, so we talk a few times a week, I've talked to Nicole once or twice, Lainie a little bit...  I mean, Sam tried to tell me that he was sick of being the one that called all the time, so he was just going to quit calling.  That doesn't work very well, does it?  Idk...  Maybe I'll call him tomorrow or Sat....   And then there's Ken...  I love him so much, it's just...  I  really  do need that break.  And I don't think he took the letter I wrote him too seriously.  I need to sit down and talk to him, bring it all up again, this time in conversation so I can make sure he grasps the full extent of everything...  It's just... Idk how to tell him...  The whole "Let's just be friends" thing is too cliche, but that's sort of what I'm going for.  I don't want us to be a couple, b/c I need time to be single and grow up and whatnot, but I don't want to totally lose him.  And when I say that I'd like to consider the possibility of us being together in the future I really do mean it, it's not just something I'm saying to try to comfort him or anything...  Am I being selfish throughout all of this?  Is it selfish of me to want to be single, flirt around, maybe date other guys, etc. during the rest of high school, some of college, whatever it is until I feel 'grown up'?  I'm trying to look out for both of us here, b/c I think it'd be better for both of us if we waited for awhile... My parents and family always seem a little... bothered... by the fact that he's 21, and his parents don't like me b/c I'm 17.  I'm still in school, I don't have a job or car, and overall I'm fairly immature and unprepared for commitment.  Ken, on the other hand, has job, car, etc. and is no longer living in the hell that is high school.  He's just got... experience - with life in general - that I don't have yet.  And until I reach a similar point myself I'll always feel slightly inferior to him, which I don't think is a very good quality to have in a relationship.  The thing is, I don't think he'll understand or agree with any of the stuff that I just said...  And I want this whole thing to be mutual, or as close as possible.  I want him to realize why I'm doing this and how it's better for both of us...  Is this too wishful of me?  Am I asking for something I have no chance of getting?  And then there's a few other factors in this...  like us hanging out as friends, and all the stuff that I've gotten from him.  As far as being friends goes... that's what I want, but I know that it's not going to be possible right away.  We can't break up on Friday and expect to hang out as friends that weekend...  That's kind of what happened last time...  I hung out with him WAY too soon, and the whole time we were hanging out I was just flooded with emotions... It was way too overwhelming, and I couldn't hold back my feelings.  I need to be more careful this time... Give myself a chance to get over the attraction and emotional attachment part... Which is going to be hard, and take quite some time, but I think that I can do it.  Maybe...  And as far as all the stuff I've gotten from him... I'm going to tell him to keep the ring in a safe place and save it for later...  I'm giving him back the bracelet... and I'll let him take whatever else he wants, he can make that decision.  I'll probably end up throwing whatever he doesn't take in a box and shoving it in the closet for awhile...  too many memories and emotions at once are a bad thing for me...    So yeah...  I want to bring this all up soon, or I'll lose the.. courage? that I have now...  Tonight maybe, at least bringing it up initially.  We don't have to make our final decision tonight, but I would like to talk about it...  AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH.... I'm gonna go crazy...

      Deviled eggs sound really good right now... I wish my eggs would cook faster...  I talked to Beth today.  Her sister may be psycho, but Katie's pretty cool sometimes :)  Muahahahahaha...  Anyway...  Hopefully I get to see Ken tonight... He called me around 9:30 last night and was all like "Will you be terribly disappointed if I don't come over tonight?" then he listed his reasons why, and told me he'd come over right after work tomorrow.  Of course I was just like "No, that's fine" and we said good-night and that was it.  I mean honestly, what was I supposed to say.  "No, that's not fine, I want you to come over right now."  Dur...  but yeah, I'm gonna go check my eggs..  See if I can get rid of this damn craving...

      I know this is a bit random,  but w/e...  I was thinking about what Mande said the other day about how it felt good to lie to her mom, and at the time it didn't really make a whole lot of sense to me, simply b/c I'm used to it, and it just sort of feels normal to me.  But when it all comes down to it, that's part of the reason that I drink and what not - to defy my parents.  Othat than the fact that those things are fun, I also get the satisfaction of 'ha, you guys don't know what I'm doing, but you wouldn't like it if you did'  And maybe they do know about it, I'm sure they do to some extent, but still...  I don't even think about whether or not they believe my story anymore.  That isn't really a big issue, the main issue is that I get to do the thing that I want to do, right?  And the weirdest thing about all of this is that eventually it gets addictive.  It gets easy to lie about little things, so you start lying about bigger and bigger things.  I think I've even lied about where I was going before when I knew that they wouldn't care if I told them the truth.  It was completely pointless, but it was fun nonetheless.  Does anybody else get what I'm trying to say here??  I just reread it and it doens't make a whole lot of sense to me, but oh well...

      Not really much to do...  I woke up at 10 this morning, did all the dishes (the huge pile in the sink and the stack on the counter), folded all the laundry, started a new load, put the newspapers in a bag and took them to the garage, and straightened up the living room.  It's past 12 and Kait isn't even up yet...  But of course, dad will come home and what I did won't be even close to enough for him, then he'll yell at me for something stupid, and I'll probably end up getting even more grounded than I am now, which is just fucking stupid as hell...  GRRRRRRRRRRRRR....  Idk...  Lainie still hasn't called me, even though she's been telling me that she will for a few days now.  And Idk when she works, so idk when I can call her...  Sam's pissed at me again b/c I told him all the stuff I wanted to tell him at the carnival, and he thinks we're all overreacting about the Hayley thing and it's not true at all, and...  wtf???  I'm glad I ended up doing it in IM instead of on the phone or in person, b/c I started sobbing when he replied to every thing I said.  He didn't really answer any of my questions, and the ones he did were the answers that I was expecting...  I just...  It's not fair, and I know that's a stupid line to say, b/c everyone knows that life isn't fair, but still...  I guess as long as I have something to keep myself occupied I'll be fine.  Play practice has been fun so far, although my parents haven't been all that supportive...  On the way home from play prac. last night my mom asked me what my lines were, and I showed her.  "Is that it?" then she laughed.  Then she asked me if I was on stage any other time, and I told her those were my only lines, and she just gave me this look... idk really, it just pissed me off so much.  Like, what does she expect?  I got a part in a play that I didn't even try out for, and all she can do is laugh b/c it's a small part instead of some fucking lead role.  She probably won't even fucking want to come to watch the play...  My dad already can't b/c he's out of town... I don't care really, I'd rather that they weren't there anyway.  I'd prefer that my friends come, and my aunt and stuff.  w/e...

      The 4th was awesome!!! :)  I met Beth at the Red Rooster around 12:30 and we walked over to Sam's house to watch the parade.  Then I went home for a little while, and Lainie picked me up around 3:30 and we went over to Sari's.  The little Swanson was there, and Marie and Nick.  So we walked to Kwik-Trip to get stuff to eat/drink, then back to Sari's, and decided to go to the carnival.  Lainie and I drove, but everyone else walked... Oh well, I can't help it that I'm lazy...  Then the two of us got sno-cones and sat on the swings having a forced convo w/ some stupid little girl named Rachel...  Argh...  Then we all sat on the playground waiting for Beth, Heathy, and Sam to get there.  Hung out for awhile... I tried to talk to Sam, but I couldn't get anything out... Grrr... Idk know when I'm going to do it...  This is so not fair...  But yeah, then we went over to Beth's for a little bit, then back to the carnival where we met up w/ Robert, Crazy Katie, and AJ.  Robert and Beth went on the Tumbleweed together, and so did Mande and I.  That made me kinda sick...  but yeah, I got a cheeseburger then we all sat on the wet blankets and watched the fireworks.  Then me, Lainie, Beth, Marie, Nick, and Sarah went to Mande's and her mom lit off fireworks.  Then at 11 her mom kicked us out, and everyone except me, Mande, and Beth went home. We went back to Beth's quick to check in w/ her mom and stuff, then we went over to Robert's.  They were just starting to light off fireworks when we got there, then around 11:30 ish Robert had to take Crazy Katie home and left us outside w/ AJ (Robert's sis and friends were inside drinking and cooking bacon...).  Then AJ left, so we sat in the driveway playing w/ fire until Robert got back, and then everyone else left.  Robert shot some potatos out of his potato gun, then tried to play golf w/one, kept missing, so he just started beating it w/ the club, the he got a croquet mallet and started pounding it w/ that...  he's crazy sometimes... But that's ok, b/c he's Robert :)  Then we went inside and pulled out the beers that his sis had left for him, plus the ones that were left from Fri. night and the other stuff that was left from Fri. night.  I hate the taste of beer w/ a fiery passion, and I wasn't going to drink any (I called the only Triple Black that was left, and I was going to just drink the rest ofthe Blue UV).  But then Robert decided to make a beer bong, and he told me you can't really taste it as much that way, so I figured I'd give it a shot (I'd never used a beer bong up until then...)  So he got his old squirt gun tube, a milk jug, and rubber bands/duct tape and put his little thing together.  Beth went first, and her first time she got a few swallows then spit stuff out and didn't plug the hose, so there was a little bit of beer sprayed around the kitchen, but we got it cleaned up.  Anyway, then she went again and got it, so then I went, and then Robert.  It was actually pretty cool, and it does taste A LOT better that way.  Then I drank my Smirnoff and some of the blue UV.  Mande tried a little of both of those too.  Then Beth had another beer, and by then it was almost 1:30, so we needed to leave.  Beth was drunk (3 beers, a drink or two of triple black), Robert (3 beers, drink of two of triple black) and I (2 beers, triple black, few swallows of Blue UV) weren't really even buzzed, although I did just feel nice and relaxed.  Poor/lucky Beth... She's such a lightweight, and at times it's a blessing, but other times it's a curse...  so I walked her to her driveway then Mande dropped me off at my house.  I stayed up until 4 when Ken finally got there, then I fell asleep.  I woke up at 10:45 yesterday when Beth called me.  Did random stuff until Ken finally woke up at 2.  Yesterday was supposed to be a 'Brit & Ken' day, but that didn't really happen.  After he got up we went to Autozone to get stuff for his car (he finally got his Mustang back), then we went to his house to get other stuff for his car, then we stopped at Kwik-Trip so he could show Jason... (guys and their cars...)  Finally we got back to my house and it was 4:30 ish, and I was in semi-sick, semi-depressed, semi-pissed off mood, but I agreed to go out back so we could have a water fight.  Then I came in and changed, sat on the porch w/ him until 5:45 when he left to go work on his car, then went back in my room until Mande picked me up for play practice.  That was fun even though I was in a bad mood, but then I got him and got in a fight w/ my dad about the comp, so I got grounded.  In an attemt to keep myself from totally trashing my room I went running.  Walking most of the time, running/jogging every time I felt emotion.  I just kept running until I thought I'd pass out, and by then my thoughts had cleared again.  That worked pretty well, and I didn't get home until 9:30.  No one even said anything to me...  Anyway, then I ate and Ken came back over and we sat around and now it's today.  So yeah...  Idk if I'm still grounded or to what extent I am, so Idk what I can and can't do...  I REALLY want to have another shindig at Robert's.  That was fun, and it'd be a lot more fun if I didn't have to worry about going home :)

      Oiy...  So much has been going on in the past few days, shitty and good.  I don't really have much time because we're leaving for the parade shortly-ish, and I really can't go into detail on everything right now anyway.    Friday night...  Everything got all messed up, stuff almost didn't happen, Lainie couldn't come, but in the end it was me, Beth, Crazy Katie, Robert, Sam, and Heathy.  Heathy and I scared Robert when we were waiting in his car after he got off work...  We originally had everyone in the car w/ arms and legs hanging out so it looked like we had a giant orgy, but then Beth, Sam, and Katie left so we wouldn't miss the pizza guy when he came.  But yeah... the biggest part of the night was the Spin-the-Bottle game which everyone except Beth played.  At first it was: guys shake hands, otherwise same sex kiss on the cheek, opposite sex kiss on the lips.  Then after awhile it was changed to: same sex on the lips, opposite sex w/ tongues.  We started counting when two people were kissing to see how long they would go for -- Crazy Katie and Robert seemed like they'd never end, and Sam and Heathy went for awhile a few times.  Robert and I went for like, 10/15 seconds before Katie jumped up and pulled us apart, and I'm not really sure about me and Sam.  But then shit went downhill and lots of people got quite emotional, and... Yeah.  Then Robert and Sam went back to Robert's house around 3ish, and the rest of us sat up talking a little longer then we went to bed at about 4.  Poor Heathy... she had to get up at 6...  But yeah... Argh, I don't want to post any of the other shitin here, b/c I already vented to Heathy about it at Beth's, I'm going to talk to Lainie today, and I REALLY don't need the entire world knowing all the details.  B/c some of the details are things that I want to keep secret...  Plus there's stuff that I want to talk to Sam about, but I can't tell him yet, and there's stuff I REALLY need to tell Ken and make him see and accept...  Not fair not fair not fair...  Yesterday...  it started off really shitty b/c I woke up and George thought it was cool to stop by in the middle of the night, and then I had super bad cramps.  I really wanted to talk to Lainie, and Thurs. I thought she told meshe worked 12-5 on Sat (which I must've heard worng...), so Beth and I walked down to the Red Rooster.  Now, walking from Beth's to there w/ cramps, a headache, being tired as hell, and feeling 150% shitty makes it a damn long walk, and I wanted to just collapse halfway there...  Then we got there (1:30ish), and Lainie's van wasn't there.  So right then and there I think I lost half of my grip on everything, then I went inside and Ghandi was working and he said Lainie didn't come in until 4, and I started to freak out and he looked at me weird and asked me if everythign was okay, and that's when I just totally lost it.  I ran to the bathroom and sobbed for 5 mins, called my dad and said I wanted him to pick me up, then I sat by the b-room crying until I saw his car pull up...  Went home and sat in my room for god knows how long, and took a nap...  But then around 8:30 ish I called Robert (he and Crazy Katie were supposed to go up to R&B in Madison, and I wanted to make sure he knew it was postponed).  Anyway, he asked what I was doing and I said nothing, so he asked if I wanted to come over. So he picked me up and me, him, Katie, AJ, and Richie went to his house and lit off fireworks in his backyard.  Robert was putting stuff in potatos and blowing them up, then throwing little potato chunks at me... Grrrr...  Then at 10 Jenny came over, then everyone except Richie went to Kayla Shaapveld's grad party.  It was a little akward b/c I didn't know/get along with a lot of the people there (Scott Boie...), but it was fun anyway.  Then Katie and I left and went to get Dunkin Donuts, but there was a bunch of creepy looking people stanging outside the door so we just left and came back here.  Talked for awhile, then Ken called and I talked to him, then I came back inside, and blah.  Katie left at like, 8:30 this morning.  She wants to cancel her backpacking trip, and her mom is going to freak out...  Idk...  "Are you going to the parade?" ... so help me god, if either of my parents asks me this question one more time I'll shoot myself.  YES, I AM!  Just like I said the last 6 times you asked...    I think I'm going to call Beth now, and Lainie.  Then get in the shower.  I'll see everyone at the parade or tonight at the fireworks or whenever I see you...

      On the phone w/ Lainie...  I'm SOOO confused about tomorrow's plans.  As far as I knew before, me, Beth, Crazy Katie, and Robert were going to party at Beth's, and Lainie and Mande were going to hang out...  Then Mande got online a little bit ago and asked me is we were still planning on getting Lainie drunk tomorrow night (which, by the way, people seem to have misunderstood slightly...).  So I said that I thought she was hanging out w/ you, and that I wasn't sure how much fun she'd have w/ us anyway b/c she might feel weird sitting and watching us, and that we hadn't really updated her on times or anything most of the week b/c we assumed she was hanging out w/ you.  And then... Argh, idk...  everything's all crazy-ish, and Lainie was talking too fast for me to comprehend at 11:30, and I don't think that  ANYONE  knows for sure what's going on tomorrow night, b/c everyone had what they thought was the plan in their head, but everyone had a diff. plan.  GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR... So as of right now no one really has any clue what's going on, and Lainie doesn't even know if she can get out of her house anyway...  So yeah, I'll update again on Sat, b/c by then all of this will be over and everyone will know what the plans were :)

      My tummy hurts and my muscles ache, I don't really know why.  Plus I've got cramps and I shouldn't, I'm thoroughly exhausted and I just got up 3 hours ago, and... BLAH.  But on the bright side of everything, I alreaady got my chores done for the day, I get to go get my contacts at 4, I got to talk to Ken last night for ore than 5 mins, he's going to try to get off work before 12 tonight so he can come and see me (his Mustang is supposed to be dropped off at his work today!), and... and...  oh yeah, tomorrow I'm going to Beth's!  So YAY!!  The rest of this week should be pretty cool.  *does a little dance*  Hopefully everything goes well...  YAY!!!!  I just got off the phone w/ Church!  He told me to show up for play prac. on Monday night!  I get to be the judge, which is just a small part in the beginning, but really that's all I think I could handle...  Too much stress, especially since the play is in... 3 weeks?  But yeah, it's all good.  So see, today's getting better by the minute.  I still have to get ahold of Heather, b/c she wants me to babysit her rat for her while she's on vacay.  I missed her call this morning, then I left her a message, and now I'm waiting for her to call me back. Lalalalalalalalalala...  *random jig*  Now I'm just bored...

      So I just typed everything and it deleted... and I don't feel like typing it all again, so here's the abbreviated version...  yesterday I went school shopping, got some bras and underwear and notebooks and whatnot.  Then I went over to Ken's and talked to his parents then we went down to his part of the house and he showed me his kitchen and bathroom and bedroom and living room and shit.  That was cool, then i got home at 12:30 and the parents didn't say anything so now I'm going to start coming home late every night.  YAY.  anyway, nothing's going on today, mom and kait went to fond du lac and dad and i are staying home.  fun fun

      Went to Jason's w/ Ken yesterday...  We watched Scary Movie 3.  These damn painkillers make me tired as hell, so I slept some...  I'm not taking any today, b/c of the party and b/c I don't want to fall asleep at 7pm...  But anyway... not much is going on today.  Lainie's going to drop off Nick sometime, and I have to call K-dogg sometime after 5ish.  After Ken gets off work he's coming over here, and we're going to Robert's around 10ish, when he gets off work.   So yeah, that's my day.  fun fun...

      Got my wisdom teeth pulled yesterday... that was 'fun.'  Getting knocked out was pretty cool though, b/c I got all numb and felt drunk-ish.  That was cool.  And then after I'd sat in the little recovery room for awhile and they told me I could leave they tried to help me stand up and walk.  But it felt like walking drunk, so I didn't have much of a problem, and they told me I was pretty good.  I almost said "I'm used to walking drunk, so this is pretty easy" but I caught myself.  I don't know what would have happened if I did... not much probably.  Anyway, then I came home and slept a lot, then Ken came over, we played Monopoly (I lost), then we went to bed.  So yeah.  Yesterday was fun.  I was feeling bored around 12ish and thinking that I hadn't seen Heathy in awhile, so I texted her to see if she wanted to do something.  So we went to Subway to see Scary, then we went over to Beth's to see her and Sam.  Then Sam left, and Heathy went to work, so Beth and I walked down to the Red Rooster.  We got there at like, 4:30, so Pookie wasn't there yet, but we got ice cream and talked to Becca.  Then Lainie got there, and we talked to her for awhile.  Got chinese.  Then Beth and I left around 7 something and walked to Andy's house, but he wasn't there, so we went to Robert's.  His car wasn't there, so we called him and he said he and Andy were on their way back.  So then Beth and I helped Robert and Andy clean up from the party monday night (I helped clean up after a party I wasn't even at... oh well).   Then Jenny came over and we played cards and ate watermelon.  Then we met AJ at Taco Bell.  Came back to Robert's for awhile.  Watched some movies.  Jason Perdelwitz came over... We all played Monopoly, then Jason and Jenny both left.  Then me, Beth, Robert, Andy, and AJ got the bottles out of the cornfield, then put them in Robert's trunk and burned the boxes.  Robert put a lot of gasoline on the fire... Then  AJ cleaned out his car and we burned a rug and shit.  That was cool.  Went inside and watched another movie, then Beth and I tried to sneak back into her house and the door was locked... So we went back to Robert's and spent the night there, and when we got back there was a note for Beth saying she was grounded for not coming home... So that really sucks, b/c she'll probably be grounded until school starts.  She can still prob. sneak out for Robert's parties, but I don't know what she's going to do for Jake and Millertime's party...  Anyway... don't know what I'm doing today. Ken works until 12, then he's going to Tabitha's funeral, then he's going to come over.  We might go over to Jason and Sami's.  And I need to drop off Pookie's sunglasses at her house sometime before she leaves.  I need to call Robert too, to see if Ken can come to the party.  He could get Jason and Sami to come too, if we want it to be a bigger party.  God, I'm so excited that I get to get drunk again tomorrow night... I haven't gotten drunk in two weeks...  I'm just not going to take my painkillers tomorrow.  Maybe one when I wake up, but I won't take anything after noon.  Otherwise I'll get sick.  And I can deal with the pain... once I get drunk it won't matter anyway...  That's it for now I guess.  Call me if you can Bethy.

      I'M FINALLY HOME!!!!!  Sunday night our flight was overbooked, so they were looking for volunteers and my dad got us on the list to take a bump.  They ended up needing our seats, so we got $300 each in airline credit, plus our hotel and shit.  The next flight they could get us on left at 8:10 in the morning, but then we would've had to wait at the airport until mom could pick us up at 6.  So we took the 11:30 instead, had an hour layover in Detroit, and finally got to Milwaukee at 3:30.  Then we had to sit in the waiting area until 6, and by that point dad was pissed at mom for being late, then we all had to sit in the car together until we got to Janesville, THEN we had to go out for dinner... That sucked, b/c mom talked on the phone pretty much the whole time, including a long conversation w/ her boyfriend in fond du lac, all while my dad was sitting right next to her.  That was great... We'd been home two hours and they were already on the verge of killing each other.  But finally around 9 we got home, and I just took my stuff in my room and shut the door.  Said hi to my kitties and puppies.  Called Ken and he came over.  He watched me unpack and I showed him stuff, then he showed me pics from PA, then we talked and blah until he left around 1, then I went to bed.  Woke up at 8 this morning.  Did some random stuff for awhile, then got on the comp...  I still have to call everyone... Bethy, Lainie, Sam I'll call you for sure today.  Robert...  I'll talk to sometime this week.  I need to call Nicole b/c I haven't talked to her in awhile, and I have postcards for Mande and Heathy that I need to give you guys...  My dad's an asshole...  He never renewed our sub. to the milton courier... which would explain why we never got the one w/ the play pic in it, which I really wanted.  And I like to read it b/c I know people in Milton and shit...  Another thing - does anyone remember Tabitha Braden?  I haven't really talked to her much since middle school, and then last night I found out from Ken that she died in her sleep on sat. night.  That's depressing...  Earlier this week I was thinking about going out w/ Ken to see her sometime soonish, but yeah...  Anyway...  I get my wisdom teeth pulled tomorrow... That'll be great.  Just great.  Simply fabulous.  So Weds and Thurs are gonna suck, but I'm still going to try to find time to hang w/ Lainie and everyone.  Friday night I'm partying at Robert's.  I'm feeling party-deprived.   I really wanted to go to Robert's last night, too bad my dad's a jackass...  So yeah.  That's about it for now.  I think I'm gonna go start calling people and whatnot.  Later!

      Forget my post from yesterday, I just go caught at a really bad time and had a wonderful little mood swing.  I'm sorry I made you cry Bethy I didn't mean that and you know I love you (platonically, of course).    Anyway...  Thursday dad had to work and didn't get back till almost 9, so I didn't really do much.  I didn't feel like going to the pool alone and being attacked by the people down there... God, I hate feeling like the minority.  This sucks...  Then I texted with Sam and Derek for awhile.  That was cool, b/c I haven't really talked to Derek in a loooong time, and I haven't talked to Sam since he left for Fla.  Lainie didn't respond to my texts, and Heathy couldn't text me back until she got off work.  Then my dad got home and we ate dinner, then I called Sam and talked to him for about 15 mins (I was only supposed to be on for about 10, but oh well).  Then after midnight Ken finally texted me back telling me he'd read the letter.  I was SOOOOOOOOOO freaking happy, and that lifted a lot of the tension off.  Part of me was afraid that I'd screwed too much stuff up and that he wouldn't want to try to make everythig work out and start over.  I know that I screwed up really bad and hurt him a lot, and I know that I don't deserve to have him back, so I considerr myself extremely lucky to be in love w/ someone who loves me back as much as he does.  Yesterday we went with dad while he did some of his work.  They were stores on the east coast, and we were going to go to the beach while we were in Melbourne,  but it was raining all day,  so that didn't really happen...   We ate lunch at Friendly's.  I've never eaten at one of those before...  it was pretty good though.  I had chicken strips, and I can't figure out what my obcession has been w/ chicken strips lately... Oh well, they're good, so I'm just going to keep eating them.  We didn't really do much else yesterday.  I was finally able to get postcards, and I'm going to send them out today, so you'll get them after I get home, but oh well.  Mande, Lainie, Bethy, and Sam, you'll get yours in the mail.  Heathy, Ken, and Robert... I'll just bring yours.   I wanted to buy everyone little souvenirs, but I only brought $20 with me, which isn't enough to buy much of anything in this place...  But anyway... today we're probably going back to Universal Studios and/or Islands of Adventure for awhile.  I'm going to talk my father into buying me this really cool necklace I saw, and maybe talk him into giving me money to buy stuff for everyone, but I don't know how well that will turn out.  We're eating lunch at Emeril's restaurant, b/c my sister is a big Emeril fan...  I don't get to go to Epcot, but oh well I guess...  Tomorrow we're probably doing the same general thing as we do today.  Our flight doesn't leave until 6:15, and we have to check out of the condo by 10am, so we have most of the day.  Then we get home around 8:15 WI time...  Hopefully mom is on time picking us up, and I can be at my house by 9:30, no later than 10. *crosses fingers*  She'll probably forget about us, but oh well...  But yeah, it's only 9am and I'm already up, showered, dressed, and ready to go, except for putting in my contacts.  Kait's fast asleep and dad's supposed to be back by about 10am (he had two stores he had to work at today).  Then we can leave...  So I guess I'll go try to wake her up and get her going so we can leave shorty after dad gets back.  I'll see/talk to everyone on Monday!!!

      Well, I'm officially in a super-shitty mood...  I was just in a fairly bad mood... bored, missing people back home, the Ken stuff...  and then I read Beth's blog and I freaked out and started crying...  All the stuff about the party at Robert's the other night, and the party that's going to be tonight, and all the stuff about Sam and... I don't know...  Part of me just doesn't want to go home.  I want to leave and never come back... I don't know where I'd go, I just want to go, really far away, away from everyone and everything...  And right now I'm really desperate to party...  And I'm missing all the stuff this weekend, and no one is going to be in the mood when I get back... Tues night I can't b/c I get my wisdom teeth pulled on weds so I can't drink past midnight... Then I won't really be in the mood weds night... so the soonest will be Thurs or Fri... I don't know if I can wait that long... and I know I sound like some freak crazed alcoholic or something stupid like that, but frankly I don't care what I sound like.  I'm in a REALLY bad mood, feeling a bit of party withdrawl, which is worsened by all the talk of partying, and I don't know how much longer I can stand this... GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRr  sorry... forget everything.  fuck it all

      Vacations are fun, but it kinda sucks being cut off from everyone else... I tried to call Beth last night but she was busy so I guess I won't get to talk to her until I get home... Plus I'm missing the party tonight, and I'm not sure what she decided on what will and won't be done tonight (as far as alcohol, happy smoke, other, etc.). I'm not depressed about missing the party that much, even though it's different than our other ones b/c it's at Beth's and they don't have to hide out in the basement, I'm just depressed if they do the shrooms w/o me, b/c I wanted to be w/ Bethy and Robert and them when we all did it together for the first time... Oh well, I guess it doesn't matter all that much. If they do it, they do it. If they don't, they don't, and we can do it as a group sometime later... Other things... Lainie has only responded to like... half the texts I've sent her. Heathy hasn't replied at all, and I don't have her address, so I can't send her a postcard. The only person that I've really had contact with is Ken, and there's so much other stuff connected with that...  oiy, forget all of that.  Anyway, I've been pretty much having fun here.  Monday night we went out to Boston Lobster Feast.  All you can eat lobster, crab legs, shrimp, etc.  I ate too much... only 2 lobsters, somecrab legs, shrimp scampi, fried shrimp, cocktail shrimp, london broil, crab cakes...  Then I ate cake for dessert... Tuesday we went to Universal Studios.  I lost my sunglasses... GRRRRRRR  The MIB ride was pretty cool.  You get to shoot aliens! :)  Yesterday we went to Islands of Adventure.  That was better, just b/c there were more rides.  The water rides were awesome, especially when we first got there b/c there was almost no wait at 10 am,  even though it was already hot as hell.  It was good for us though...  Anyway... I got a cool necklace.  It's a silver dragon's claw w/ a red marble in it.  There's another one that I want to talk my dad into buying for me when we go back, but I'm not sure if that will work out...  w/e...  Today... dad has to work until around 6 ish, so I don't really know what I'm  going to do. It's nearly 11 and I haven't showered yet, plus Kait is still sleeping.  The crazy maintenance guys were just here, and I didn't understand a word of what they were talking about b/c it was either heavily accented irrecognizable english or rapid spanish... oh well, hope it wasn't too important.  Anyway, I'm going to sign off and shower, then get dressed and ready and make some lunch.  We'll probably go somewhere when dad gets home...  I'm going to send postcards out tonight, hopefully.  I'll get home before they do, but oh well, they're still fun to send :)  Pookie -- I love you!!! Bethy -- I love you too! (platonic).  Have fun tonight! Ken --  I miss you!  Love you, and can't wait until I get home. Heathy -- why aren't you responding ot my texts??  I need your address! Mande -- Have 'fun' watching the brats!  See everyone later...

      Having fun in Florida...  I haven't really done much.  Kait and I met this girl named Erica on the plane on the way down.  She was like... 12?  Idk, she was cool though, and gave us someone to talk to though.  Then we got picked up (stupid rules about minors flyin alone... I hate having somone watch over me all the time.  I'm 17, I don't need a babysitter to get on and off an airplane)  We went to Planet Hollywood for lunch... came back to the timeshare, sat around, then went to Super Wal-mart for groceries and whatnot.  I got elastic cord so I could finish my anklet.  It's really cute :)  Today Kait and I are just lounging around while dad's at work.  Eating, watching TV... meh.  Anyway, I'll update my blog as much as possible while I'm here, two or three more times this week.   I love you all!!  I miss you Bethy and Pookie and Ken!  And Bethy, you HAVE to call me after the party and tell me how everything goes!  You should call me during the party too, if possible.  I won't be able to talk long,but...  Anyway, gotta log off, later!!!
