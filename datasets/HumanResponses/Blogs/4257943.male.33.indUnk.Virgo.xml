      I took my car into the shop today to have some work done on the electrical system.  I had to leave it overnight, so I decided to pop in on my girlfriend at work.  She just started a new job and she's been exhausted after each shift.  I wanted to maybe brighten up her day a little.  So I take two buses and a train, then walk about four blocks to get to the restaurant she works at, only to discover she was given the day off.  Dammit.  Two more buses, the train, and another walk to my apartment.  Total time wasted: three hours.  The first thing I'm buying in Vegas is a new car.  Well, I mean the first big thing.  I figure I'll probably go to dinner or buy some groceries before I buy a car, but you get the idea.

      I've set up another blog to post some of my photos on. I'll be posting pictures of Vegas on this one, but when I shoot models the pics will go on the other site. I may also post some stock photos on it. Here it is:   urlLink http://briansphotos.blogspot.com/   I plan on buying a digital camera soon. In the meantime I'll make do with my camera phone.

      My buddy Nick moved there about two months ago. I'll be living at his house when I move down. I drove to Vegas last week and crashed at his place because I wanted to check out the city. I've been there a few times before, but I was on vacation and all I cared about was partying. I didn't worry about the important things like: Is there a Quizno's near my house? How close is the nearest movie theater with stadium seating? How many crazy people are there walking the streets?  The answers are yes, I couldn't find one, and at least one. Saturday afternoon, we were walking down Freemont St. When we stopped at a crosswalk, this guy behind us yelled, "How come all these people think they can come here to our country and not speak American?!" He said it like we'd been talking for awhile, and he was just picking up where we'd left off. Like if some guy walked up to you and said, "Yeah, well she should have called if she was going to be late!" So I look at him: ratty denim shorts, no shirt, wrap around sun glasses, white trash hair cut, tattoos, and a tan so dark he looks like the Mexicans he's complaining about as we walk across the crosswalk. Now I could have let it go, and maybe I should, but I just had to say, "We don't speak American. There's no such thing. Most of us speak English, you know, the language from England. And since there's no official language in America, they don't have to speak it to live here." --- 'They' being the Mexicans which are apparently taking over our country. Sneaky Mexicans, coming up here and stealing all the jobs that none of us want. Go home to Mexico! Oh but can you leave your food, culture, and music? We like those. --- When I said this, he looked like he was about to hit me. Then he screamed, "What are you? A Mexican?!" and stormed away. I turned to Nick, who had backed away a good four or five feet and said, "I am so moving here."

      I will be moving to Las Vegas within the month. I'm setting up this blog to chronicle my adventures.  I hope I don't get in trouble. After all, "What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas." What if there is some kind of Vegas secret police that enforces this. There I'll be, typing away at my keyboard at 3:00 AM, when guys, dressed all in black, burst through the windows and confiscate my PC.  Note to self: must wear more than boxers during late night posting.  Stay tuned.
