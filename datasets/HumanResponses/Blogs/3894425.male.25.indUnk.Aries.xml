      is there a way to get back to college? relive those days? is there a way to getaway?  i've had many jobs in my life. thrown papers. shoveled asphalt. i've seen people that no one else has seen again. i've walked over 25,000 people, sometimes more then once. i've carried groceries and crushed cardboard. i've delivered papers and eventually designed them.   i've worked with many different people. i worked with convicted convicts and holy rollers. i've worked with GEDs and PHds.

      my daily life. i goto work at 7, come home at 11 to let the dog out. dog pees, sometimes poops. I'm back inside by 11:20. i eat lunch and let the dog back out to either pee or poop.   i'm back at work by noon. i work until 4 and then it's back home. home till the next day at 7. i have a wife, which makes being at home not so boring.  i do graphic design, as does most people on the internet with blogs and with macintoshs.   i'm a cliché

      i work with old women. yes, old women. i do graphic design with old women.  I have a theory. it involves said old women. i have a theory that old women are the strongest and loudest critic of software. if it doesn't work right EVERY time and the SAME way from version to version (even if it is going from version 5.0 to 7.0 they want everything the same).  old women should test every product before it is put on the market. only one thing would be sold. dollies.

      Waiting for your dog to pee so you can goto bed is like watching a bad movie; you don't care how it ends, you just want to see the end in order to goto bed.  • Need to find a new job • need to find a new job • Need new employment  ---might have to start tomorrow.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Carl wasn't a lonier, he just had no friends. Carl wasn't single, he just couldn't find a date. Carl wasn't anything, he just couldn't be someone. Carl was a victim. Carl was his own demise. Carl wrote everyone off before they had a chance to speak.   Carl had no more options.

      I have a dog. His name is Jack. Jack thinks he is people. Now, we all know that dogs are not people. But, he feels he is, though he can't vote (not old enough).  He also feels the need to sleep between me and the wife. Which I think is great.

      This is a new space. A new world. A new place to play.  Somehow I feel this will be left to die in a pasture someday. only. long then. the cow.

      Jack, my dog, ripped into the napkins today. Apparently up on the microwave cart isn't out of his reach.

       I have two old watch boxes on top of my shelf. I keep little trinkets in them. Little scraps of paper and WWII nickels.    Some of the things in them are of no value to anyone but me.  • An old Micro Machines car I found while home one time.   • A ring from Iran my grandfather brought back from WWII.  • A $1 chip from a casino I would frequent in college (I think that's the only money I went home with that night.)  • A pin from a tractor pull my dad and I went to when I was about 6.     I hold on to these things because they allow me to hold onto the memories they contain. They are like little boxes in their own right; big enough for just one memory. But memories are huge.     I guess I'm a little like Joe Pesci's character in  With Honors.  Except I don't keep rocks.

       	 		 		 This is I-270 south in St. Louis, MO. I'm sitting on a overpass in North County. There is just something magical and calming about pictures like this. With the hectic pace, even at 9 p.m. The noise is comforting. I've since moved from this area. Where I live now it's much quieter. I miss the noise. The sound of human existence. Comforting me from afar, but near at the same time.   Also, while taking this photo I wondered if someone would turn me in as a terrorist photographing a way to blow up the bridge. Luckily no one was thinking like me. 		 		 		 			 urlLink     			 				 			 urlLink DSCN0795 			 			Originally uploaded by 			 urlLink tunruh .

       	 		 		 Sometimes when life has you down, you feel there's no where you can go.  Somtimes when life has you down, and you think there is no one out there.  Just stop and look, with a dog if you must, and see the good that lives outside. 		 		 		 			 urlLink     			 				 			 urlLink tonyjacklookingoutside 			 			Originally uploaded by 			 urlLink tunruh .

      We got a satellite on Saturday. It pretty much rules my shorts.   But, with it comes a discovery. The discovery of new music categories. Apparently there is Hard Rock, Progressive Rock, 90s Rock, Heavy Metal, Smooth Rock and about three others.   Really?

      ever have the feeling like you need to get something done, but you didn't have a definite idea about what it is that needs to be done?   i have a problem with no having something to do. some project; it doesn't have to be big, just something. cleaning the house. taking the dog out. organizing my mags. buying something. somebody's birthday.  even finishing a book or mag. sometimes when i run out of reading material i get anxious. i always need something more to read. something more to intellectually digest.   maybe i'm just odd.
