      The first thing I see in the morning, the last thing I see before I fall asleep. When I close my eyes to escape the pain your face lingers there. Love has made me a fool I am too tired to express what I feel...perhaps tomorrow

      The cat leapt out of the bag. It was completely out of my control. Control and I used to be one in the same. Not over others, but over myself. I know I gave that up long ago when I made the choice to live. It's interesting at what times old ghosts choose to return to haunt you.  I know that the decision was made with my best interests in mind. I partly was wishing for it to be done. I was also partly praying that it would never have to be brought to the surface. At least not now. It's not like it wasn't common knowledge before...I shouldn't have underestimated his intelligence. He knew all along.  If our hearts are in the same place, hypothetically speaking, why are our souls not even in neighbouring cities?  His name feels as though it's emblazoned eternally on the tip of my tongue. Constantly tickling me, daring me to splurt it out. Scream it at the top of my lungs. How is it possible to love a name the way I do?   I'd planned to spend the night drinking myself farther and farther away from you. I ended up falling asleep at the memory of you. Drifting away slowly, to find myself once again in your tight grasp.  How ironic that you don't want to live on the moon, when that's where I spend most of my time dreaming that&nbsp;I am with you.   Jiggy passed out...I mean...fell asleep before the fun began last night..I was left to watch hicks be funny and basically sink their own ships. I don't care who you are that's funny right there...Even though she fell asleep and left me to my own devices , without her I wouldn't last long.

      I knew this would get more difficult to deal with, but I never expected to feel like my heart was locked tight in a vice. With every smile, he forces my body to sink lower into the ground. Every laugh tightens his grasp around my heart. I'm rapidly losing what used to be a solid grip on my world. I try so hard to not float off into my fantasy where there's nothing else but a mutual love and complete bliss. This is no time for melodrama and surprisingly this is not a typical Lauryn overreaction.&nbsp;Bottom line: I've got it bad.  What will I do when he finds out? What if I can never bring myself to tell him? It might be better if I just left well enough alone and led him to believe that our friendship was all that has ever existed between us. I'm pretty certain, however, that we'd both know that was a lie.  I can't wriggle my way from his sure and loving grip. How he held me that day makes me believe that I am the one he sees when he looks into her eyes.  Everything is timing and my clock seems to be eternally late.

      I feel as if my heart and lungs are being simultaneously crushed. I've never felt this way before and I'm not sure I could stand feeling this way ever again. I honestly feel as though all life glides through a huge hole in my soul. I'm enjoying as much as I can but it hurts to live.  Jiggy has helped keep a lot of the pain at bay just by simply listening and helping sort through the tangled knot I've created. It also helps that she knows how I feel...  I spent some time with J today and that truly rocked my socks. We tried to hang out at the library in the kids section, but the evil, constapated librarian asked us to relocate to the teen zone where we had more room to roam. She told us that we were "scaring off the children". What child, I ask you, would want to enter into her layer of doom and opression! It truly bothers me that adults can't let kids just be kids and let us play. We may be nearing adulthood but we're not there yet! GRRRRR!&nbsp;  &nbsp;

      Colatteral is why I am an actress. I need to tell him.

      To think of you is inevitable. It doesn't matter how hard I try to occupy myself, I can't get away from you. My mind is let of it's leash and roams towards you. It smells your too firmiliar scent from afar and winds its way towards you without my control. It likes your taste. It's not a taste that it can satiate easily. I wonder where your mind wonders...if it ever goes in search of me. It's only been a week and a half and already revisiting our haunt sends shivers up my spine. It was strange, all the nostalgia that was flung into my face simply by walking through the doors. I'll be going there alone during the year. 'Our trio's down to two' next summer. I hate wishing my life away but I can't refrain from thinking ahead and how it's going to be different next summer and then the summer after that when I find myself alone... with only your spirits there. I'm working with Jaryd all week at the Epcor centre, supervising the kidlets at noon. So far so good. Noisey, but good. Kyler is a sweetheart and is definitely unique. (and a unic) I spent the weekend at her house and went to my first ever football game (we won 49-27) where there was quite an acomplished half-streaker (only had boxers on) and 5 rowdies + 1 fist fight, watched and fell in love with The breakfast club, and decided that Jon Hughes is a genius.  I'm off to dream about you .

      I didn't expect to see them there...or together for that matter. It was very strange. I don't want to be with him and I'm not jealous that she's with him. It just forced me to see that I am single and solitaire. I'm not one to feel that she needs to have a man in life to complete her. It would be nice, though not necessary. I feel defeated
