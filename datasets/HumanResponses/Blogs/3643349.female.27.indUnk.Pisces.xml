      alice alice  alice the caterpillar was ever so wise. what a question...a question whose circle smoke surrounds and confuses.  a haze of unanswered thoughts.  so many thoughts that loop into an eternity of patented single word responses.  i am woman; daughter; wife; artist; dreamer; lover... and what do any of those single words actually say- they say mockingly directly to the source "who are you?"

       when the mouth is silent, why does the mind circle things that are mundane like a vulture?    point in case:    i was sun bathing on my rooftop yesterday, and it became a matter of great urgency to catalog the past ten new years eve's chronologically.    mind you this was no small task.    obviously&nbsp;a pressing issue&nbsp;that was worthy of the better part of two hours of "relaxation".    so i proceeded....     &nbsp;   let's see- i know that two were spent in new york city, two in chicago, two in d.c., and there was that one on the beach in maryland....     &nbsp;   let's&nbsp;start with the two's shall we.     &nbsp;   new york    yes, yes, one was with a group of friends out at some club down in soho...that was fun.    the other was more intimate- only three of us out to an early dinner, then a neighborhood bar on the upper west side.    ok- i've got it.     the threesome was post friend fall out  -    placing it some years  after  the inaugural apple dropping group outing in the late nineties.    glad that one's straightened out...     &nbsp;   onto chicago     &nbsp;   (this one got complex.)    both new year's in chicago were spent at local restaurants (similarities from the onset)    one,&nbsp;the clock struck twelve while dancing at&nbsp;a club in the loop...    the other, the magic hour hit while&nbsp;playing kloodle&nbsp;with friends in front of a&nbsp;fireplace.    and to make things even&nbsp;more difficult to figure out-    i was fairly sure that these two were consecutive.    (for this one i had to lap up&nbsp;as much of my brain as i could- which&nbsp;wasn't easy since the heat had already melted it down and it was seeping through the cracks in my lawn chair)    then-    it hit me.    the reason that Magnolia's (one of the restaurants)&nbsp;was such a special outing- was because we had just moved to the&nbsp;area....    GENIUS!    - predating it  to the second restaurant in the same area!     whew.     that was some thinking.....    it really is a good thing i love to speak.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
