      Dont you hate it when people are big ASS FACES? with big sticks shoved up there asses? Well i guess you run into those people every day. It just gets annoying after awhile. seeing the same people day after day. especially ones you dont want to see. Or doesnt it piss you off when you say something to some and there reply is just something stupid or you wanted them to say more. BUT NOO, they are too cool for that. Maybe its just me, I am a big loser. But people piss me off. I could name a couple for example. But I wont. Lets just say that when i see them i want to punch and scream at them... wow i must sound like an evil bitch.... Im not... i just keep it all inside. I believe that school is almost over. then it will be heaven. to an extent. could it be possible to not want to see someone but want to at the same time? Well it is to me. Because that is the way i feel. I hate it. Anyways i bought Thursdays first album! Now I own all three. and i bought some kickass shoes. that i have eyed for a very long time. They are green old schoolers. I like them very much. Now im going leave.... Goodbye Hannah

      Public Display of Affection.  it is gross.  get a freaking room.  no one needs to see that.  It is really quite unneccessary to hold hands all the time.  it's not like the other person is suddenly going to RUN AWAY or something.  And no one wants to see you shoving your tongue down someone else's throat.  that's just sick.  can't people keep your hands off of each other for like TEN MINUTES!!  And don't touch each other in inappropriate places while in public.  And don't make out on corners where people can see you.  It is all just wrong.  have some compassion for the people who have to see it.  no one wants to see that.  vicky

      Well this is the very FIRST entry. Just to say that my friend Vicky and I will be posting various things on here. Probably about anything. I figured this was a good place to share the many thoughts that I have. Also there will probably be postings that make no sense. But alot of things don't. Especialy when Vicky says something. The creation of this title was very simple. I asked two friends to say each a word then I put them together. It was odd how it makes sense. I like it.  But I would like to say is why are girls so stupid? Being a girl I don't know why I said that but yeah. There are tons of fights, talking behind the backs, PMS could be a major cause. I dont know. I wish that girls could just punch and the fustration and all the stupid fights will disapear. But that rarely happens. Anyways I should stop myself from rambling on.   Hannah

      My summer so far. Well there are many different ways i can say this. I still see the same people over and over. I know i have a choice, but they are my friends. So yah. Nothing interesting has happend far. Just the insane family. My brother for example. AHHHHH... Im not going to begin to explain. Just the moods that he sets me in. The rage i tell you. I just want to scream. ( I just did, and it felt good).   Last night i had people over for a friends birthday. We sat by the campfire. it was interesting. Thats when i came to reliese, that you cant aviod or escape gossip, nor talking about people behind their backs. EVERYONE does it. Its a cruel world that we live in. Then it makes you wonder:   This is how i see it: You talk or gossip about someone when they are not there, most of the things you say are not nice. You probably do not like what that person does, or just them. But you see while you talk about that person, they could be doing the same about you. Saying cruel things. But  you can't get mad at them, because you are doing the same thing. Things you would not hear. This happens all the time i belive. Or what if the person you say those things to, goes and tells that person you talked about. Its just an on going cycle.   I am also begining to think that summer doesn't make a difference on how i feel. But i dont know what i feel. And i dont like it. Its odd. Really starting to creep me out. I just want to know. I am good at times, but other times im just like fuck you. and im like the second way the majority of the time. I sit there and listin to peoples conversation, while saying in my head, "You have no idea". I would like to voice my opinion, but my voice just gets drained out by the others. Or what i say makes no sense. And when i have to chance to, i freeze up. Then that opportunity is no longer. Thats why i enjoy this whole "Blog" idea. It's a place to explain what your life is about, and how you feel, and its your opinion. Even though many people may not read it, its just out there for people to know, to give them an idea. And thats a good feeling. It's wierd the way it is.   Hannah

      I was reading some old posts. It was interesting. Anyways I came upon one were it said something about a planet, with crazy annoying bitchy people. So i decide im going to continue on that. But it wont be directly on annoying bitchy people.     See this planet... It needs a name... How about Planet of the Freaks, Staring Freaks! . Yes that is what it shall be.   Planet of the freaks has an assortment of people. Freaks are what the people are called. You see the freaks are well, you know freaks. This is a planet we all live on. But a planet that is different from all others. It’s a lot like Earth, but it isn’t. It couldn't be. Earth is supposed to be perfect down to every single detail controlled by someone else, you are puppet.   The planet of freaks is far from perfect. We control our own actions, and make our own futures. We turn which direction we want to. We sing, say, the way we want to. There may not be a problem with this, and it may sound perfect, a "Free" land. Do what you want type deal. But Planet of the Freaks is not perfect remembering this.  See whatever you do, you have to be careful, to make sure someone isn't watching you say or do this and that. You are judged by all that you do. And your actions, what you say are looked down by others; it isn't good enough to the other freaks. Freaks stay in there own groups, whether it is a high class group (which still is not perfect), middle class or a low class group. Every single freak is picked on, in the little simplest ways. Freaks die, freaks starve, freaks kill, freaks judge, freaks drink, do drugs, freaks litter, freaks cry, rant, freaks are sometimes happy (usually you don’t find this sort). This Planet of Freaks doesn't seem so wonderful does it? All freaks need a place to escape to, a place to be alone. But not on this planet. There is no escaping.   At this point earth seems like a distant wonderful place compared to the Planet of the Freaks. But you see there is one small detail if you haven't figured it out. Earth if you look deep inside is not perfect, you are still controlled by a puppet to everyone. Earth is the Planet of Freaks.    Hannah  Yes that may not make sense. But eh does it look like I care?

      My house is cold, and my fingers are about to fall off. Nothing much is new. I bought Punk-O-Rama yesturday. Its pretty good. Except for a few songs. But yeah. I have been studying for math. Im going to fail. Math is evil. And the exams tomorrow... I ponder how im going to do? Im really contemplating a few things in my life right now. Im not really going to into a great deal. But school is almost over, and things may get better. Hopefully. And my parents are going to take away the internet for the summer. So they think. Because my little brother is obsessed with it. and allows no one to go on without a big argument. I guess not many people read this, but then again there are few people who know about it.

      How could i think he was talking about me? Nope he was talking about someone else. I should have thought about it. Im so stupid, it almost makes me want to laugh. But i want to scream. Hah... FUCK, FUCK, FUCK. so stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid. i dont care anymore. nope i dont care. Its always about "Her". Always...  I know this person is far from perfect. most people are. i just need to get this out. I dont want to like him, not at all. But i do. Im sick of thinking one thing, when its totally about something else. Im sick of this place. I NEED TO BE HAPPY. so much shit. just stacking its self into messy rows.   You think that you are happy. But are you really? Because if you are happy, is there something that you know will not make you happy? or are you usually happy for like 5 minutes, then it all changes? Or when everything seems to be going right, but something has to come in ruin it all? So many odd little things can do that. I think im going crazy. meh.    For one to understand where i am comming from or to understand me, i think they had to of expierinced similar things. Not many people have. so if you havent. i dont care. i wouldnt care otherwise.   A year ago I wouldnt have felt this way. I had myself figured out. Thought i knew everything. I told myself i wouldn't be someone that i am today. Its funny how things work out. Im in a state of figuring out if im good or not. Because im not sure how I am right now... Its an odd feeling. Like am i happy, or mad. I want to feel relaxed... like i have nothing to worry about. I fear i will never feel that way. But i am learning how to live like that... How to take control and fix things.   I just feel like crawling into my bed and going to sleep. Hey anyone who reads this, leave a comment. i want to know how many people acutally read this shit that i write and what they think about it. i dont care how many people read it though. numbers are not important. Just would like to to know.   Hannah

      Today is sunday and it is raining. I feel like crawling in my bed and going to sleep. how lovely. but you see its 5:37 and if i were to fall asleep now, i would wake and not be able to sleep the rest of the night. I have this headache, i believe it came from stress. I have so much studying to do. but i dont feel like doing it today. so i will study tomorrow. I hate headaches, but im begining to ignore them, i get them all the time. I have also slowed down on taking advil or anything of that sort. because if i do, it doesnt do much...hmm... I am confused about something. Something that I shouldn't be confused about. See yesturday i was have a conversation with a friend. it was a good one, even though it was basically me sharing how i feel, (because he has nothing to share with me..haha). anyways he as well has a "blog" And wrote something like this hmm it was something about the conversation he had with a couple of people, and if it would things change between him and these people. What does that mean? WHAT DOES IT MEAN???? the insanity. (i probably did not spell that right)Does mean like change to be better friends, or change to be less of friends, or awkwardness... im not sure, i would just like to know. Haha i make myself laugh. Laugh i tell you LAUGH. ok now. I just want to know what that means. im such a freak. but thats alright with me. The rest of my family is upstairs watching t.v. as a family. its kinda creeping me out, because that never happens, but im going to go join them. its a once in a life time opportunity. and i will pretend thats all good. and it will be good.

      Interesting times... probably not to you. But i was talking to a friend, i explained myself and other things more then i have to anyone. It felt good. Good that someone knows. I think they understood it too, which felt kinda good. Everything is just so complicated, so complicated you cant even explain it. Its funny how one thought can lead right to another and continue to many more thoughts. Or how one thing can have so many different meanings just from the thoughts or feelings of different people. How one simple thing can mean so much. People are wierd. When you think of people, you can think of so many different things. Its crazy. Today has been an alright day. In a split second tonight i went from happy, feeling good, to straight pissed at the world. but now im not sure how i feel. I dont know if im happy or not. Its kinda odd. i just need school to be done. i have 4 days to study for finals. i havent started studying yet. but i honestly dont care. I feel like im going to puke. And i have a headache. and its not makeing it anybetter being on the computer. But im going to go to bed soon. its wierd how i feel right now. because i dont know. and its making me mad. And i know that no one is perfect, No one is. People just annoy me when they think that they are better then everyone else... and then make them feel stupid when they have to say something. haha. hmmm... goodnight.

      It is saturday. I just woke up and am listening to Alexisonfire. "Watch Out" It's amazing. There is less screaming, but it is awsome. Control and No Transitory are really wicked ones. It's really cold in my house, and my fingers are about to fall off. Im not in a really good/happy mood this morning. Im not sure why. Im getting the point were i am just fusturated with people. All people, and all the annoying little habits, and annoying little things that say or do. I need to relax. But its like i'm always sitting on the edge, ready to fall Or that the bottle is ready to burst. Oh man its really cold in my house. But that is ok. I will probably write more later. I have relised that no one leaves comments, maybe because im some annoying complainer. Meh oh well.  Hannah

      School is near an end. Joyful that seems to be. See at the end of the year it can get kinda stressful. Studying for finals. Finals that i am probably going to fail, because i am a slacker. Plus all the homework you recieve. I have about piles of homework to complete, but i'm not going to do it, well not all of it. Also people around this time of year seem to get bitchy and annoying. OH WELL SCHOOL IS ALMOST OUT.  Yesturday the funniest thing happend. In science my fag of a teachers button was undone. It was so sick. his white fat hanging out of it. it was sick, but funny at the same time. He didnt know his button was undone, but the whole class did and there was alot of laughter. Then science became boring and I feel asleep.  Lately it seems i have pissing or annoying one person or another. Anything i do makes on person mad or annoyed with me. Maybe because i complain and take things to seriousily. Or maybe because i get annoyed and mad at a person easily. School has become a huge war zone i must say. Everyone is warping against eachother. Everyone is talking about you behind your back. Its like were living in some far insane planet. A planet of freaks, bitches, and annoying people. Haha. I think it may at the end of the school year disease. Hmm... Ponder that.  So my sister is sick, and she believes that she can continue to boss people around. But you see boss them around more then usual. Then if someone usually me doesnt do something for her she becomes an evil bitch. But you see i happy for the fact that my younger brother is leaving this house for the whole weekend. How sweet is that. Completely no annoyance from him. Praise the Lord. Haha.  On friday im going to buy the new issue of AP, and this book called The Book Of Suicide Bunnies. Haha. Its about bunnies who try different ways to vanish themselves. Its like a comic type book... it will be funny i think. But anyways. i dont feel like typing anymore.   Also if you sat there and read this whole thing or the other long posts that i have wrote i am proud of you. i dont think that someone acutally would... haha.   Hannah

      Hockey is an interesting sport. One that I do not care for. What is the point of shooting pucks into nets? and most likely getting hurt for it. Well maybe i think hockey is dull, but i agree it can be intense. Especialy the hockey game tonight, Calgary and that other team. Tampa bay? See what do i know about hockey. I really dont care for it much. I think its stupid. And not worth watching. Even those hockey players have passion in it. My mind is set that hockey is stupid.  Hannah

               Everyday is a new challenge with new obstacles to get through. But there is still the past, and the obstacles to still get over with. People should get on with life and forget about what happened many years ago, a month ago, a week ago, and a few days ago. But sometimes the past is attached to you. All you can think about is the past. It’s hard to get over. So many things you don’t want on your mind just sit and stay's there. And it’s so annoying. It makes you want to scream. Makes you want to do anything to forget the pain of the past, or the future that may come. Being unhappy for a long time then suddenly not being unhappy would be a great relaxing feeling. But of course there is the past to deal with. The thoughts that buzz around your head. But sometimes you have no one tell those thoughts and your feelings too. And if you do, the person you’re telling do not understand, they think your crazy and should just move on with it all. Well its times like those you should just freak out at them. Yell harshly at them. For they do not understand what your going through.  	 It's odd the way life works. I don’t think a person would fully understand it. There is always something or someone blocking the way. Or something and someone are blocking you from moving on. For example family issues, friends, or just random things.   	Trust is a major thing. A thing that you should truly consider who you can or can't trust. Trust is a complicated thing to deal with. Trusting someone all your life and then finding out in odds scatterd way is hard to deal with. I am still trying to get over it. Or trusting a friend with a secret can sometimes be difficult. But you have the people you know you can trust and always will, and that’s all the matters, and if something happens it’s brutal, but in a way you know you can trust that person with some things. In my opinion trust is very important and there is more to it then one realizes.   Hannah

      Commencement was today. It was interesting. It was to serious for grade 9 grad. And people wore stupid dressy outfits. Like prom gowns. And other really fancy dresses. I think that is stupid. And so many people had there hair all done up. I dyed my black and red, wore old school green shoes, a skirt, and a shirt. I wasnt all dressed up. Im not one to dress to up. Its a waste of time i must say. But ohwell good for those people. I told myself that i would not cry. But when i was going home. I started to. I felt like an idiot. I cryed over many reasons. Its all so confusing. Leaving grade 9 isn't a big deal. Im not going to see the same annoying bitchy people day after day. I also wont see hmmm "him". Maybe that may be good.... LoL and bad. It was like leaving your way of life. Even though this way of life is somewhat displeasing. But you just have to suck it up and move on life. I think i should listen to myself talk. I am stuck in a muddle and cannot move on. There are too many things i have to get over, to many things i have to figure out, to many things on my mind to move on. Commencement was in a church. My teacher said we have to be respectful and blah blah about it. But we weren't using the church for "church" purposes. It was for a school event. Hmm.. Ponder that... I'm going through a time were I am trying to find myself. Know who i really am. I used be this h-core christain i believe when i was little, then my dad past away and we kinda stoped going to church. In grade 7 my friends bought me back to God. I figured i had a releshionship with him. I didnt put much thought into it. I never really used to swear, now a majority of my words are swears. Now all of sudden ( well the last long time) There is much to question about God, or a higher power. I have lost a great bit of faith in him, over various hard to talk about things. This is a question that often pops into my mind: If God wants us to love eachother and not hate, love thy enenmy, why would he create us not to so? to hate one another, and feel pain. In grade 9 this is when it started comming to me. Other believers of God believe many things such as he is the only one. but what about all those other religions that believe the same thing? Do i believe in a higher power? or the right god? Do i even believe? why did god make all those starving children, all those people who kill themselves every day, or make my dad drown in the fucking river? What is the point to all of that? Maybe to get over and fall in love with him. Follow him. Im not sure where i am believing god, or faith with him. But i know once i did, i felt at ease with him. Knowing he is there for me. But now im not too sure. There is to much shit with my family, i dont want to explain. I also know this so many people lives have changed because of god, there they're lives were upside down, and because of them there life is going great. I dont feel that. I dont know what to think anymore. I dont smile as much as i did, i dont have my self figured out like i used to. I dont do drugs, i dont drink. But i have no faith. i would not call myself a christian, if do i am lying. My family thinks im this perfect little christain girl... i go to church and stuff but it just confuses me more and more and i dont think that i am one. I dont know where i am going on this. But if you read it all i hope you understand somewhat more about me, and how it feels. Wow i went from commencement to god... hmmm... well... im tired, and im not in a good mood, i never am... sometimes over the stupidest things. Goodnight. Hannah

      You probably know that I get mad easily just over things I shouldn't matter. Well fuck im going to complain because I dont care. Have you ever liked someone so much to the point it hurt? To the point that you cry? Well maybe not. Especialy knowing that you would never be more then friends with that person. Going out with a person seriousily in Grade 9 is sick. Its not right. But you can like a person strongly. And I feel like a complete idiot. But it really fucking pisses me off. I just want to yell and scream at that person. Yell FUCK YOU, and anything else that comes to mind. Its so stupid. So unreal. Then try having that person liking your best friend alot? That doesn't bother me so much anymore, I am used to it. But the funny thing is, is that he likes my best friend the way I like him.... I think. LoL anyone reading this must think im crazy. But I'm simply expressing the way I feel. And what is wrong with that? Nothing. Life is so stupid. Sometimes I think that i should just stay home and continue to hate the world. I want to punch him. Punch so hard that it hurts. IT FUCKING PISSES ME OFF. I hate him for it to. Which isnt right, but screw it. That is all I really have to say.  Hannah

      Now im not much of a poet, but i try.   Drowning out the words of disgust  Losing all trust.  Falling seems like a way out  But it will only lead to more doubt.  How do you get rid of these killing pains?  All this raging blood flowing through your veins?  Ask how did I get myself into this mess?  It’s like asking how I will fit my self into this dress.  Thinking why people care?  Wondering if God will ever answer your prayer.  Feeling so beautiful, looking to kill  No ones notices, there’s no thrill.  Take a look at the inside for that’s all that matters  The outside only shatters.  At the end of it all, these words just hang in thin air  People only tend to glare.

      I can't stand my brother. He's warping against i tell you, warping against me. taking away everything. So hes a year and half or so younger then me, he acts likes he my age, the BOSS, like he can control everything. "Oh Hannah can do this, so why cant i" then goes on and on.&nbsp;"Hannah were like the same age i can do anything you can do, dont tell me what to do, i tell you what to do".&nbsp; He has no respect what so ever for nothing and no one. He acts like he can doing anything, push me out of the way. Be the spotlight. I have to stop thinking. Or im going to end up going crazy. Hannah

      So i just watched this movie when this girl is reunited with her dad after so long. And it made me think. what would it be like to see my dad? Why did the fuck did he have to go swimming. Why the fuck was there current? Why did he have to die?! What would it be like to see him? To say i love you dad. What would my life be like? would he love me? I just don't know. I want to see him. thats just not possible. But you know my step-dad is my dad. he has been here in my life for as long as i can remember. There may be downsides with my step-dad, and trust me there were. but hes my dad. Why kind life be simple? Why do people have to go through such pain. I just dont understand.  Hannah

      Don't you ever ponder why guys for the blonde ditzy girls who are afraid to be shown in public with no makeup, the fake girls. Maybe not all guys are like that. But this one is. I think he likes her, but im not to sure. Damn fool. I need to fetch myself a life. I do have one. But i waste alot of my time sitting here what could of happend if blah and who blah blah did so and so, of i did blah and blah.&nbsp; AH fucker. At least this other person who i did like, i dont like anymore, and i happy for it. Guys should die. DIE. haha.   I also ponder why no one makes comments. I want to argue with people. About differen't random things. Maybe because&nbsp;not many people read this. Well not many people know about it. Hmph, well also another thing is i dont want many people to know about. Mostly the people i hang out with, or people i truely despise.   Well i guess this could be an interesting topic if you are interested in the Government. See over summer holidays i was having a good conversation with my dad and this other person about the government. Before this conversation i hated the government, now i simply hate it even more. For example Pr.Bush:&nbsp;He sents 100s of thousands of u.s troops to look for weapons of mass destruction, when CIA and the FBI said that there would be none. Do you think that Iraq could aford weapons of mass destruction?&nbsp; And out of all presidents in the u.s he has had more vacation then any of them. 6 months. And weren't the majority&nbsp;of the votes&nbsp;somehow lost in the states,&nbsp;uncounted for?&nbsp; I will make more comments about this when i find out more stuff.&nbsp;But also how the canadain government scamed 1.5 BILLION dollars from us. And its funny, because they say they dont know were it went. Hmmm.... just think about that? This money could go to way more important things.&nbsp; Taxes are not going to worthy causes, the gun registration, that amount of money could&nbsp;go to our schools.&nbsp;To under privillaged childeren. The goverenment is a bunch of liars. People&nbsp;should want to pay taxes, knowing its going to a cause, not into the governments pockets.&nbsp;people should not pay taxes out of&nbsp;fear.&nbsp;Did&nbsp;you know that 40 cents out of every dollar&nbsp;for a person who pays taxes&nbsp;goes to the government? What will happen when the youth&nbsp;now grow up? Will the goverment&nbsp;take over half&nbsp;of our income? Really though what are&nbsp;we going to&nbsp;do about it. We have to do something, if the goverment is running our country&nbsp;fearing us all. Am i going to half to&nbsp;give the goverment&nbsp; the majority of my money? The goverment is&nbsp;a bunch of bitches. And we need to do something about&nbsp;it.   Hannah&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;

      Haven't&nbsp;written much in a while. And I can't write alot at this moment either. For i have to go pick the damn weeds in the garden. Atleast i am getting money. I have to pick every single little weed in the garden. WHY THE PAIN I TELL YOU.   I went to camp for a week. what a lovely time. My good sandals went missing in this mushy dirt in the lake, they were being worn by someone else. My camara fell into some water canoeing. All's i wanted to do is take a picture at this little island. My disc man almost got smashed because i left it. Maybe that was my fault. but its all i had to surive holidays with my brother and sister. So then i had to wash dishes with all the groups, every day, every lunch, breakfast, and supper!. But besides that camp was a delight. It was fun. And there was lots of freedom. For my growth in the lord, i will comment on that at another time. The people their were wicked.  Then i got picked up the friday to join my&nbsp; family on wonderful relaxing holidays. Really though the place were we stayed was beautiful, the people were snobby. The lake was wonderful. I learned how to wake board. It took me 2 days to finally get out the water. But the third day it happend. Unfortantally it was the last day we had the boat. But my dad bought the boat, just couldn't take the boat home because you can't pull a trailer and a boat at once. I met some cool poeple. Like Maxwell and Cullie. Max has a lisp. And it was utturly funny. Im going to miss them, but i them on video!.&nbsp; But then my brother started getting my nerves as always. and there was fighting. Traveling was hell. Cramped in the middle and being car sick. Normal family actions on this holiday i supose.   Well i will write more later, for my brother is in the room.   Hannah

      This morning i believed i did not like this person anymore. I now think, that i still like him, just teeny tiny bit. I dont think about it as much as i ever did, nor do i feel that i have to, or have to like him. The feeling of not starting to to like him is starting to increase. So i guess what im saying, is that im starting not to like him, alot. Which is good. Im sure he will be happy to hear so. Im going to bed. Goodnight

      Today i woke up and i reliesed that I know longer like this person. Such a great feeling it is. Nothing more to worry about. Im so happy about this. YEAH! Maybe it's the summer. No i dont think it is. because i don't like him that way anymore. Nope.  "Miss you less, with each day your gone" (The Greatest Fall Of All Time, By Matchbook Romance) Well all the days are gone, i no longer "Miss" or "Like" him. And if there was another day to see him, i still wouldnt like him. wow. this is amazing. I can't really describe how i feel. It just is.  Hannah

      His name is Brendan. And i don't know what to say. He likes to golf. He hates the majority of the girls that goes to his school. He likes good music. He also likes country. Country is Laura's favourite. Connection. Except for one fact. He does not like Alexisonfire. Because they scream. But he hasn't listend to their new album, which has less screaming. Brendan, is a nice guy. And I dont know what more to say. Hmmm.... Goodday.

Light a match to them. Burn. Im so negative. . Its funny because my friends are not. Im probably the most negative out of them. And it makes me feel out of place. But they are my best friends. hMM.... maybe oddness times 100. night.

      Work. So i got a job at action. Its pretty swell. I sit and this little hat stand, and try to sell hats. it gets boring when your working for 9 hours.  Today was an odder. And a painful one. Damn parents who except you home early. Or when your siblings have to go the bar, but then end up not doing so. I feel odd right now. Like im not sure if im happy or not.  Like nothing seems to be going right. Well it is, but at the same time its not. So im just listening to Sparta. Its beautIful. while sitting wishing i could be drunk at the moment. though i know a wonderful best friend of mine who i would not be here in this world would be so mad at me saying that. I am not a drinker so much. I have only been drunk a couple times. And i would have tonight. For its not the whole popularity thing about drinking for me. because thats just stupid. Its for having a good time. letting go of thinking to hard. Its a good feeling, to an extent.  Haha. i hope my friend doesnt read this, because her opinion means much to me. Just think though if you do read this friend ( I dont like mentioning names) Maybe you do say "Drinking is for people with no personalities" But i have been your best friend for a long time, and you know i have a personality, does me wanting to drink or having done so, say that i dont have a personality? Maybe it is to vanish my sorrows. Be happy, have fun. so i hope if you do read this, you still love me. haha.  I was thinking wouldnt it be nice living out in the woods like a nature person and to build your own little hut. and be away from civilation. Away from people. Away from thoughts, thinking. Wonderful hate.  Hannah  P.S whats your opinion on guys who act nice to you out of school, then in school act like he doesn't know you? I ask myself i do continue to talk to him?  p.s.s or is it p.p.s? I am just happy i dont like anyone.

      You know the government... Its not cool... Heres an example of whats going on the world in some of these countries. Im starting to reliese though that Canada's government is so much better then many others.   urlLink http://www.geocities.com/whydoyoukeepdeletingme/ASSLLeague.html  It talks about Child Labour.
