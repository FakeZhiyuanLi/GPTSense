      It seems like this last week is creeping by at a snail's pace! I'm ready to get OUT! It's finals week, but I'm not too stressed out about it. I mean I have worked my butt off all tri, and I have actually been studying the material. I think that I will do well. Not that it really matters. I'll probably end up going to community college anyway! Not that that is a bad thing. I would rather go to one of those, then to a University. It seems that all anyone ever does there is get drunk and party. I know that that is stereotypical, but I am NOT that kind of person. Being around that kind of stuff would only irritate me. It may even get me side tracked, which would be a very bad thing. I'm kind of reserved to the whole thing now. Schools put way too much pressure on students now. They (they being the school officials in general) drill it into your brain, at a young age, that you have to go to college and yet they make it damn near impossible to get in! I mean with the SAT's and everything else we should just stage a strike or something!

      This is the first chance that I have gotten to get online all weekend. It seems like I did nothing but work! Friday night I had to close (a fast food term). I didn't get home until midnight! Then I had to get up at 6 in the morning to go back to work! I was so tired when I got home! I was supposed to go to the drive in with some friends, but I didn't have any money. Nor did I feel like it. So the people that I am living with (my dad's best friend and his wife) had a barbeque. It was pretty fun. We played cards and I won! Well I think most of that had to do with the fact that everyone was drunk but me. It's so much fun with mess around with drunk people. That's a horrible fact, but it doesn't stop it from being true!  My favorite guy quit work a couple of weeks ago. He found a better job somewhere else, and I am really happy for him, I mean anyone deserves better than Burger King, but I also miss him. I miss him a lot. He is my "stress reliever." There is just some friends that can make you feel better when you are in the worst of moods. He can do that for me.  I guess the reason that I am so upset is because I know that it won't ever be the same. I am an innocent naive 17 year old girl and he is a 24 year old ex convict (that sounds worse than it really is). Not to mention his girl friend is very jealous of me, which I do not see why. Nothing would EVER happen! He thinks of me as a little sister not a piece of meat! Anyway, he came in to see me yesterday. I was happy to see him, but when he left it made me miss him even more! I'll have to admit that it surprised me that he came back to see me at all. I figured that he would just leave and never come back. That's what everyone does. Maybe that would have been easier. I'll get over it though. He promised to come in again, and I am fighting feelings. I want him to, but then again I don't because when he stops coming I'll be twice as hurt. It's a double edged sword. Much like everything in life!

         I am assuming that what I will be posting will not be very interesting. I have never been fond of online "journals" or even fashioned diaries. When I was younger I did try to keep a diary, but I would only write in it when I was upset or angry. That made it look like I had a horrible childhood so I threw it away. I do like to vent though. I mean, who doesn't?     Today was the seniors last day of classes. I found myself feeling more envious than sad though. I can't wait for that to be me! High school is okay, but I want to be an adult working towards a career that I am exited about. Most people aren't really sure of what they want to do after high school, but I am positive. Medicine has always been very appealing to me, and I think that it is the only thing that I would be truly happy doing. I started out wanting to be a doctor, at the age of five, but was quick to change my mind when my uncle told me that I would have to be a butt doctor. So then I thought about being a teacher for awhile, but I changed my mind in junior high. Patience is NOT one of my virtues, and one has to have a lot of that when dealing with children, or even teenagers, all day. So after that I thought that I might want to be a psychiatrist. That occupation was thrown out the window though. I don't really believe in psyciatrists/counselors. They drive me NUTS! I would not like to listen to people whine about their problems all day. I am a firm believer in figuring things out for yourself. Counselors, at least in my opinion, don't help. They just make me feel weak and stupid. Well I think that is enough for today.

      It has been a long time since I have written. It's not that I haven't had time it's just that I dont feel like it half of the time. I love summer though. It's nice to not have to worry about school. All I have to do is sleep and work. Well and hang out with friends of course!  I get to go to Cali in a week! I LOVE it down there. There has only been a few summers where I have gone to see my Grt. Grandma. She's awesome! I guess I am so excited b/c this is going to be my vaction! I won't have to do a lick of work or spend ANY money. I probably will anyways though b/c I dont like it when people spend money on me. I didnt used to care, but now it bothers me. I feel bad for some reason. Who knows? ANyways i get to go the beach, the zoo, and Disneyland while I'm down there! I'm not gonna want to come home! = ) Who can blame me? Anyone who doesn't love their grandma is just crazy!   Well I am bored of writing now! Let's see how long I can wait to write this time! Lol.
