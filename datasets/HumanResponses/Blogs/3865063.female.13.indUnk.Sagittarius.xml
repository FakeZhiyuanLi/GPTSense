      And the next genius is Katty Novillo. . She was born in Arlington, Virginia on December 18, 1990. She has showed us the impossible. She has proven that anyone can follow and accomplish their dreams. She has, in the field of psychology, found a way to get in to her patients minds. She discovered this at first when a patient hired her. This patient talked to her about his deep life scaring and bad memories. She was determined to help this patient through his tough time. She discovered a way to get into the patients mind, and help him cope with his loses and chaos. He suffered from depression and paranoia. She studied him for years before she finally found a way to get in to his head. She opened a new pathway in to his mind. While in deep sleep, the doctor studies the brain waves and determines what is wrong. She then talks to the patient and finds out what these brains waves mean to him. She studies the rapid eye movement (REM) while the patient is asleep. During REM, she studies the brain waves and what is causing him to stress over all of this. She wakes the patient before he goes in to the deepest stage of sleep. The brain waves and the dreams, help her find out what exactly is wrong. She has found out that the patient was severely mentally hurt.   Thus, I introduce you to the next genius, Ms. Katty Novillo.

      When I was ten, I took my first trip to Bolivia. I had to wake up really early and get ready. I was going with my sister, uncle and cousin. The plane ride there was so boring. All I did was sit, sleep and read an old magazine. I had to get on to three planes because one of them was canceled. When I finally got there was so mad: it was really hot and humid. When I got to my grandparents house l had to sleep in the back room with Vanessa: my older cousin. She didn't speak any English, it was really hard to talk to her, because I didn't know much spanish. I stayed in Bolivia for about two or three weeks. I didn't really want to go any where, until my sister said that I had to go, I was really mad. It was really far and took along time to get there. When we finally got there, I was grumpy, until the parade started and I was hit with a water balloon. I was surprised. So I looked at who hit me with it and it was some complete stranger. I was really kind of mad so I went and hit him back; it was carnival. It was fun, and when it finished I was completely soaked. When I got home, it started raining and tiny frogs came out. My cousins and I caught about ten, and then we let them go. After that parade, I was a lot happier and I thought every day past really fast. The last two weeks my cousin Elvira came, and she actually spoke English. The last two weeks we spent traveling. In La Paz, Bolivia, we stayed with my uncle. It was a big house and I stayed in my cousin’s house. After that, we went to my other uncle’s house. It was really hot there. It was a really boring there but some of that stuff was interesting. There was a toucan that never did anything but sit on the brick wall and there was a macaw there that yelled very early in the morning if anybody wanted coffee in spanish. I finally took the plane ride home and the plane had to land immediately because of turbulence and we spent the night at the airport, we finally got home. It was fun.

      The smell  was awful. I was at home, with my aunt and cousin. I was playing with my neice and something smelled awful. Smelled like something was rotting, but we didn't know what. It smelled so bad that  we all had to go outside to the backyard. After a while we realized that the baby's diaper smelled really bad, so they all stayed away from her,but that smell was way to strong to be coming from her. I felt really bad because she was just sitting there playing with her toy and everybody was just staying away from her. So I went to play with her. After about half an hour outside the smell in the house was not as bad so we went back inside. I was my aunt was carrying the baby and she remembered that she had something in the oven; it was completely burnt: that's what had smelled so bad.

           When I was six, I was every where, every where but home. My favorite place was the tree outside my house. It was a tree with two long branches sticking out the left side. I was always climbing that tree. One time in the summer I thought it was a good idea to jump off the tree, it was really cool. I did it all day, even though I was by myself. I thought it would have been cooler to jump from a higher place, so I did. I sprained my arm and I ripped a hole in my jeans. I ran inside and I think I was more worried that my mom would yell at me about the whole in my pants, until I realized that my arm was bleeding . There were scratches from my wrist to my elbow. Two weeks later when my arm healed, I did it again, but this time I didn't sprain anything; I broke my finger. It was the best tree I have ever known.

      What's your shirt say? Why are you going to school? What do you do at school? Do you have friends? What are there names? Who's your best friend? Where do you live? Where'd your glasses go?  What are contacts? Why do you have them on?  Why? Is there a park around here?
