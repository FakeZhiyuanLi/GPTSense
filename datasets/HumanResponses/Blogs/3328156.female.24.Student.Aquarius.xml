       Isn't it strange how upset we get if we do not get the things we want given to us. I have personally realized that I act like I am five-years-old over something that has little significance over my life and yet it seemed like I was willing to give up a perfectly healthy friendship over the most stupid things in life...and this is sad.  If that other blip made no sense to you as a reader, that is okay. We all find that ignorance is bliss at one time or another (seriously, we do). In other news, I get to start my house/cat-sitting job today. I am very excited as the house where I am at is very close to my work and the cat has the most interesting character of some of the cats I have met or cat-sat. Izzy (short for Isabella) is very interesting and peculiar, with a lot of affection to show...no Adam, you cannot put her into a box though...Last year when I was cat-sitting her I was watching Red Dragon and at the part at the end she jumped on my lap and scared the jebus out of me. Little She-Devil.  Anywho, I gotta start packing up my stuff...I was going to do it last night but fell asleep at 9, only to wake up at 1 to ppl who don't know how to keep their voices down and seem to think that the world revolves around them  Laters...Amanda

       Hey, this is my first of what will probably be many entries about what I see, do, or think, so if you don't like how this sounds you better go away now and never come back! For those of you who have stayed reading this I applaud you.  You will be wishing you didn't.   I can't believe how many stupid people there are in this world. Some mothers just chose not to quit with the drugs when they discovered that they were pregnant, I guess. Or perhaps they felt that bringing another f**k-up into this world might make it a little better....NEWS FLASH: Two wrongs do not make a right!   There are so many people out there that are constantly depending on the people around them to get them out of the s**t that they fell into in the first place, and I for one was one of the helpless victims that got pulled into it because I figured it might get me in good with whatever is waiting for me on the other side...oops...big mistake. If you see someone drowning in their own s**t, don't try to help them. Walk on, as Bono would say, and leave them to find the branch that will pull them out, or let them drown. Either way, you'll be safe from it.  Laters...Amanda

       Well, crap isn't really holy, but it will do for a title for now.  I am tired, but I have to study for my exam if I want to pass it this week. Procrastination is lovely.  So, I am moving in 11 days. It is exciting for me to be doing this whole thing all by myself...I feel like it will bring out the sides of me which have been sufficating because I have lived so long with the company of others. It will be nice to be able to stretch myself into a whole new environment for a while.   I almost killed my friend's fish this week. I almost became a murderer!!  See, it is a beta fish and the bowl was yucky so I tried to clean it, but didn't realize that I need to put de-oxygenated water in it.  Oops. I checked on the status of "Beta" the fish and so far so good.  My friend says that the fish is grumpy, but I think it is really his own feelings transfered from him to the fish...Freud would call it peojection....see, I am learning my psych stuff.   In other news...ummm...Ikea is having a sale. I need a couch. Or a futon, I am not picky. Nor am I being suggesive...that just isn't my nature :-P.  So with that I will get back to Freud and his penis, or lack thereof. Oh yeah, and if, as Freud thinks, Girls have penis envy then boys have boob envy because man oh man, if the proverbial "boobs" were on the other "chest" men would never leave the house.:)  See ya'll later Amanda

       Sorry about not updating this thing in a while, I have been busy and the place I had been cat-sitting at had the Sasser worm on their computer and it took a while to get it fixed:). I am well as well can be, seeing as the poplar trees are pollinating and making me very drowsy and stuffy.  I am moving soon. Excited? yes and no. In my time at the house I was sitting I had discovered how nice it is to live alone and to not have to worry about other people using bathrooms when I really really had to pee. I also discovered how nice it is to be independent and to be more or less free to come and go as I please. Not that I can't do this now, but sometimes I feel that I am being inconsiderate of those around me and therefore have the need to feel this independence.  Hockey is nearly over. Thursday the 3rd (today) is game 5 for the Flames vs. Lightning. Series is tied 2-2...GO FLAMES GO!!  I finally jumped on the bandwagon and bought a shirt but I fear that my leap onto this large bandwagon may have caused it to fall over. I hope not...I am not that big and there are people on this thing that are much bigger than I am:)  With that I will say adieu. Hopefully the best team will be winning the Stanley Cup (and by the best team I mean the Flames, of course):)   Amanda

       Hey, I am fine and dandy, just wandering through life rapidly wondering where my summer is going.  It is half over and I don't even have a tan to show for it :-(.  Hmmm. Nothing really new to say but thank you to all the people who have been sending me emails. They sure cheer up my day.    When I have had the time I have been taping Big Brother and Amazing Race, both which are in their fifth seasons. I can't believe I got trapped into that reality-TV trash, but it is pretty amusing to see people at their worst and most manipulative times.    Went rollerblading on Friday in the heat and got heat exhaustion and what I am lead to believe is heat stroke. I am fine now, but when I passed out on my couch when I got home I couldn't move from that place until morning and even the sun hurt my eyes.    Calgary Stampede is over for another year and I must say that this year was no different than any other except that there seemed to be less things to do unless you were wanting to waste your money on the rides. Speaking of rides, I watched a couple of friends go sky-diving last week and have confirmed my ideas of what a land loving person I am :-).  Though when I was watching the Amazing Race they were para-gliding, and that seems like a fun thing to do.....I think it is the whole falling feeling that I get when I think of it makes me scared. I am not afraid of flying per se, it is just the falling which may come with the flying that makes me nauseated.    School begins in a month for me and I am sorta looking forward to that, though it will pass after the first assignments are handed out and I will not be able to wait for the christmas break. I am not planing to go back in the winter semester as it is not necessary for me to and I feel that I have worked my butt off for the last three years so I am taking some much-needed semester off and planing to go and visit some family out in the Eastern Canada direction for some much needed R &amp; R and perhaps get a chance to fulfill my dream and go visit New York City for a few days. I'll know for sure when the time and funds come.    For now I will sign off. I want to watch Monster again, good movie if you haven't seen it.

       Hey all:) I am finally in my new apartment and I am LOVIN' IT!! Absolutely fantastic location and all that fun stuff.  Also, my email addy from Shaw has changed...now it is monkey.girl24ATshawDOTca.  Drop me a line there to let me know that it works.   What else?? OOOHHH It's that time of year again for all those folks living in Calgary.....Stampede...the one time a year that I feel an urge to listen to Country music.  Well, not that I appreciate it as much as some others of this city, however, I think that once a year does it enough for me. It was bad enough when I lived at home and had to listen to it all the time unless I was in my room or had control of the car.    Uh...what else?? so much has happened since the last post. Both jobs are going well. On July 3rd there was a HUGE rainstorm that flooded the area where VHQ is in Garrison, so the floors are all wet there now. I am just glad that I wasn't working there at the time it happened. Starbucks is good. I get three days off starting tomorrow and I can't wait. I can bond with my sofa... it was mad for a bit because I was house-sitting and not spending any time at all with it, but I believe it has forgiven me as it let me sit there comfortably this afternoon as I was off work. I keep falling asleep on the couch with the TV on, but as you all know, this is a transition that will take a bit as I am not used to having this much room all to myself. My bedroom seems so empty these days:(.  I am thinking of having an open house sometime this summer so that people can come visit me in my new pad. Probably will be before school starts again at the end of Aug. I took a week off of work to go rafting with some friends from school and take some time for myself before I have to kick it back into high gear for a while...4 months, and then I will be (hopefully) taking a semester off so I can visit some family I have been wanting to see ever since I found out that I have little cousins out there I haven't even met.  So that is all for now, I guess. If you haven't seen 50 First Dates on video yet GO RENT IT!!! I laughed so hard at the antics which Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore pulled, and they both got production rights so there is some funny stuff put in there for all the Adam Sandler fans out there.  Take care,  Amanda
