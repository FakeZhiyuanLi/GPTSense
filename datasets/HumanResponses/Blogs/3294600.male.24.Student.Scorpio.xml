      This weekend had an interesting turn of events.  Friday night I chatted with Josh and he said he wanted to get together still on Saturday.  So we made plans for him to call me at 9 AM.  I woke up early and worked more on my room and got a lot accomplished.  By noon I figured I had been stood up and continued working on my room through the afternoon and chatted on-line as well.  Dale went over to talk with the landlords to see where we stand and if I could stay another month since he was paying the rent.  Their cold-heartedness continued and they said I had to be out.  Dale and I have decided that it's fine because I can still stay here as a friend.  I'm going to write a letter stating I'm paying him $.25 per day for storage until I can figure out what I'm able to do something with it all.  About 3ish Josh signed on-line and we talked for a bit and he still wanted to get together.  So I worked more on my room (to a presentable state), shaved, showered, and drove to Burlington and picked him up.  At first we were both shy but conversation happened.  We decided to go back to Smokey Point and hang out at Dale's.  We spent time getting to know eachother amd did some cuddling (Yeah for cuddling!).    I called Dale to let him know there would be company when he got home.  I asked him if he wouldn't mind getting a DiGernio(?) pizza, but he had already left work so he stopped at a local store.  I cooked the pizza and Josh and I ate together and Dale went to the computer room and chatted.  After pizza Josh and I went to bed; there was more cuddling! :)  We talked a lot and I fell asleep in his arms.  I woke up when he went to the bathroom and then was wide awake for few more hours.  It was nice to have someone spend the night with me.  This morning (Saturday) we woke up and even more cuddling! :)  We spent most of the morning sleeping, cuddling, and chatting.  It was very relaxing, but didn't help me get stuff done on my room.  At 1:30 this afternoon we left to take him home.  Dale was stood up today by a guy (poor Dale!) and he called to let me know.  We made arrangements to grab lunch/dinner when I got bck from taking Josh home to Job Corps in Sedro-Woolley.  Josh was worried about getting in trouble for spending the night, but he didn't.  Woohoo!    After I dropped him off, since I was already in Sedro-Woolley, I stopped at Randy's house.  For those of you who don't remember who Randy is, he is the one that was supposed to get my Dad's truck and buy it from me.  Well, the phone number had been disconnected and I couldn't get ahold of him.  I knew they were planning to move so I figured I would write down the address and mail it to the address and have it be forwarded.  As I pulled up and parked, there was a car there and people in the window.  Sure enough, it was Randy.  I kindly welcomed me and opened the door and invited me to stay for a bit.  I told him I was just passing by and we talked about the truck.    He said that he never got it and my Dad's landlord sold it to someone else and kept the money, allegidly because my Dad was a month behind.  That whole transaction is SOOOOO illegal!  He can't just sell my Dad's property.  The best thing I could have done was take the truck's title, which I still have.  Randy asked me if I had a key and I quickly said, "Uh, no, I gave it to you last time I was here."  He didn't remember that at all and his wife said, "I think this is the key."  Sure enough, it was.  He said, "I was even asking around who was the quickest hotwirer to go take it."  I told him to go get it and if he has any problems, call me, I'll call the Sheriff and report it stolen and that Randy is taking care of it for me until I can get up there.  I have the title and since I'm the only person that has rights to anything of my Dad's, he had no business selling it.  My Dad's dead and his life still continues to be complicated.  We made arrangements and instead of $600 for the next two months he's going to do $300 for the next 4 months.  His wife said, "Will money order be okay?"  I tried not to laugh and said, "Yeah, that would be perfect."  We'll see if around the 18th of June if I get anything from 'em.  I came "home" and Dale and I went for Mexican. :)  I got the same table I did on Friday afternoon.  It was super yummy!  We came home and each took naps.  Our 18-year-old neighbor, Chad, was obnoxious today and knocked, called, knocked, called, over and over until finally Dale answered the phone.  Dale told him to call back later that he was sleeping.  Around 8 we finally went to Hollywood Video and got Miracle and LOTR 3 (whoopie, not a fan and haven't even seen 2).  We watched the Miracle and it was really good.  It made me miss the Silvertips so much!  I cannot wait for hockey this September!  Well, it's almost May 31, 2004 and I'm supposed to be moved out by tomorrow; that is so not going to happen.  I will stay at Joe and David's tomorrow night probably.  I was supposed to go look at a place this weekend, but Josh occupied me and I didn't get to it.  I will talk to him tomorrow an see if I can stop by on the way to Mom and Grandma's/Joe and David's.  I have two appearances to make tomorrow. ;)  I'm so popular.  I don't know where things are going to go with Josh, but he's a very nice guy, but a bit young at just 18 on April 15.  It's funny the he knows who Garret is and sees him daily.  Garret went there on Tuesday and I started talking with Josh on Thursday, I believe.  Anyway, those following my blog are up to date!  Hope this finds you doing well and enjoying your Memorial Day weekend!  Jason

      Goodness, I'm falling into a bad pattern about not updating my Blog.  Thursday was school and that went well.  I stressed about a test and studied until 2:30 in the morning.  Jackie and I figured it would be a trick test with some stuff to read carefully before.  She had given us strong hints it was one of those read everything before you begin type tests.  Well the joke was on Ilona because she forgot to print the last page with more questions and the "Don't answer questions....if you already have it's too late."  It was funny.  I think I did alright on the test, but will have to wait until Wednesday to find out.  I worked in the computer lab most of the day on batch files for class next week.  Unfortunately, I'm having problem getting the day thing to work now that I'm not in the Windows 2000 OS.  I'm going to spend a lot of time on it Tuesday since I have 2/3 classes.  I'll just go normal time to work on the batch file in the lab.  Dale met someone last night after dinner.  I guess they went and had coffee and hung out.  I'm glad to hear they hit it off well.  He's still going after the early 20's.  This guy is into older guys though, we'll see.  I stayed home and worked on homework and packing.  God I have so much of both to do.  I have a little room on homework and need to focus on moving, but really want to get the homework done as well.  GRRRRRRR!  Today (Friday), I got up and worked on my English paper and got it done about 12:10 and rushed to get ready so I could deliver it to Holly by 12:50.  The rain was horrible on the way and seems to be worst here in Smokey Point...weird eh?  I got it to her and talked for a few minutes.  She reassured me everything for class would work out.  It was helpful to hear, but doesn't make it any easier.  It felt good to get the paper done.  After I left talking with Holly I went to the Post Office Box and picked up "my mail."  I say, "my mail" because I have yet to receive anything for ME at that address, it's all been for my Dad.  That's fine I guess.  I'm going to need to start using it more after Monday since I don't really have an address after then.  I'm still going to be friends with Dale of course so there is no problem getting mail after school or whatever.  I went to Mexican for lunch here in Smokey Point.  It was super yummy, but lonely since it was just me.  There were other tables, but nothing interesting to eaves drop on.  What do I expect for Smokey Point?  After lunch I went to get boxes to move and they told me at the licquor store there are none and to check back on Tuesday's.  I was like, that does me no good.  So I don't know what I'm going to do about boxes.  I wish Dale would have gone like I had asked him to.  I also hope he's going to bring boxes from his store tonight like he said he would.  So packing and homework will be my Memorial Day celebration.  Joe wants me to come over and have BBQ with them on Monday afternoon/evening, but we'll see.  I'm living life on the seat of my pants right now and quite frankly the road burn is a pain on my ass.  If anyone knows of affordable apartments in the Marysville/Everett area, please let me know! :)  Hell, my luck I'll be hit by one of those funnel clouds or whatever spotted all over Everett, Snohomish, and Mount Vernon today.  Later!  Jason

      Today was an awesome day.  As promised, more on the laptop.  I made some whinning comments today when I got to class and Ilona thought it was funny.  For whatever reason, she had faith in me.  I don't know, I think she sees potential in me or something.  Especially since I'm taking two classes with her next quarter and I am making her web page for her.  So with about 10-15 minutes remaining in class, she saw I had put it all back together and decided to bring this to everyone's attention.  She found a power supply to turn on the laptop and announced, "Jason's got the laptop put back together, now we're going to test to see if it works."  I turned bright red, she plugged it in, and I'll be damned if the thing didn't actually work.  Everyone applauded, which made me blush but certainly built up my ego.  Jackie, Jerryn (shirt lifter) and I went to the Parks Building and had coffee.  We sat there for a while, but Jerryn wanted to go to the library and Jackie needed to get back to the computer lab so she could work on a project with (shoot can't remember her name, bad Jason).  The lady I can't remember her name is actually a lesbian.  I found out yesterday when I saw her getting out of her car.  I went down to the library and found Jerryn.  We couldn't find a place to sit so we went to the computer lab.  Mr. Shirtlifter didn't lift his shirt once during class today, but he made up for it in the computer lab.  He didn't have time during class because he was learning how to format a hard drive and install Windows 98.  I registered for my other two Fall classes on-line and we are going to have a same class in the Fall, again at 8 AM. :)  He went to class at 11 and I continued working on my essay.  A few minutes after Jerryn left, the other classmate I have a crush on, Shane, came in and sat next to me and worked on his essay as well.  We talked a bit between sentences until it got close to class time.   The rest of the day went well.  Between English and Web Design, I called Dale and asked him to pick up some boxes for me at the Liquor store so I could start packing my stuff.  He said, "Sure, no problem."    During Web Design my theory from yesterday was reinforced: copy those that already did it, is how to do JavaScript according to Richard.  We worked on menus and he pulled them from other sites.  Ugh!  When I got home I was hoping to see the boxes I asked Dale to get for me hours earlier, but oh no.  I got home and the mail hadn't been picked up and still an hour later he's asleep.  Ah well...I'll do what I can tonight.  Had I known he wasn't going to do it, I would have stopped there on the way home from classes.  So this brings me current on my Blog.  If anything interesting develops tonight, I'll made a new post, if not, I'm working on homework and packing all night (one or the other or both, not sure yet).  Peace and Love!  Jason

      Wow, I actually forgot to do my Blog before bed.  Yesterday I had a good day at classes, but stressful.  In Intro to Operating Systems I took apart a laptop and was supposed to put it back together...Yeah, not so easy.  I ran out of time so Ilona said, "Okay then, we'll come back tomorrow."  Most everyone else was working on formatting hard drives, but I got to play around with hardware.  More on that later.  In English we worked on our papers that were due today and peer reviewed.  JavaScript is somewhat clicking; it's mostly copy and paste from those that know what they are doing (at least that's our instructor's version of JavaScript).  I would have liked to have learned it from scratch so I could write my own JavaScript by the end of the quarter, but that didn't happen.  After classes I came right home and had good intentions of working on my paper.  Instead, I crashed from 3:30 to 8:50.  When I woke up, I looked over at the clock and was said out loud, "Oh shit, that better be PM or I'm screwed."  Sure enough, it was PM and I didn't oversleep.  I had a weird dream about playing football at Mount Vernon High School as a 24-year-old.  It was odd.  When I woke up I worked on homework and chatted on-line.  I first talked with Jackie's sister Stac.  I learned that Cory, the guy they were going to fix me up with, is moving to New Orleans.  He's 18 and just out and wants to go to the gay mecha for school.  I was disappointed, but not surprised.  I'm happy for him and hope he does well, but uses condoms. :)  When Dale got home and I used his car (since my window doesn't go up and down easily) to go get food since I hadn't eaten all day.  One would think this would be a simple task.  I had already decided that I was going to go to Wendy's for fries and McDonald's for a burger.  My first stop, at Wendy's, went smoothly.  The trip to McDonald's, not so much.  As I pull up to the drive thru I see all their propaganda about being open 24-hours.  I sat there waiting and waiting and waiting to order.  No one came to the speaker, so I drove to the window and saw someone standing there.  I drove around again thinking, "okay, maybe they saw me now and will actually wait on me."  Oh no, I sat there and sat there and sat there.  Finally, I decided to stop and wait 'til the person at the window eating the McFlurry came to the window.  He didn't.  He looked at me and shook his head mouthing something (I'm sure it was "we're not open" or something to the effect).  All of a sudden he disappeared and another manager-looking person came to the window and I barely heard him say, "We're closed."  I said, "What happened to 24-hours?  Your signage everywhere says 24-hours."  He opened the window and said, "We're closed."  I repeated my question about 24-hours.  He said, "That's only on Friday and Saturday."  I explained that nothing was posted indicating that.  On the window was a phone number and name of the district manager.  I called and left a message.  I drove off upset and went to Jack In the Box.  Not that McDonald's is all that, but the employee eating the McFlurry (which I wanted) could have just come to the window and told me that from the beginning instead of me waiting there.  The manager guy lied to me when he told me it was posted on the sign, there was nothing.  Had it not been for my friend John sending me cute text messages that made me smile, I would have been pissed.    Along with Safeco Field (due to prices of Mariner tickets going up over $12 plus service charges per seat and the May Day for Marriage rally) I am boycotting McDonald's.  After eating yucky fast food, I chatted a little longer and went to bed.

      After English class my instructor, Holly, came up to Terry and I to see how we were doing.  We started talking and she knows my situation with my Dad, but didn't know about having to move as well.  She overheard Terry and I talking.  I told her I am working on my papers, but when I start working on one, the other pops into my head so I'm spinning.  She said, "Woah woah woah...Here's the deal: What paper do you want to be working on?"  I told her paper five (I need to do four, five, and now six).  She said, forgert paper six's deadline on Wednesday, you're on no timeline, just work on one paper, turn it in by the end of the quarter and work on paper seven when I give it out and turn it in with everyone else.  The other two papers you can turn into me after the quarter is over and I'll give you an "I" for a couple weeks.  "Does that help?"  I said, "Yeah, but I'm worried about the other..." and she interrupted me before I could finish.  She again stressed that I have too much to worry about and that life happens.  I almost started to cry.  Terry has been very helpful as well.  She's one of the ladies that hugged me the day I came back and she had tears in her eyes.  She's offered me her home if needs be.  She has a huge house on a lot of property and it's just her.  During my break I worked on an assignment for web design, thank God because it ended up being due at the beginning of the class.  We worked on something new in JavaScript and I actually got it done in class and it worked. :)  When classes got out I headed south to Seattle to help Mom with her new TV.  An employee at Fred Meyer's loaded it into her car and so I just helped unload it and set it up.  It's a really nice TV, the sound is great, and the picture is awesome.  The only problem is George W. Bush still looks like and sounds like an idiot.  I listened to his speech, not bad plan of action, but at a great expense.  As I have said from day one, I support the troops, but not the war or the man running it.  The thing that angers me most about this war, is him sending so many of the National Guard to Iraq.  That is NOT their job; they are to protect the State from other countries and even other State's invading.  138,000 US soldiers are in Iraq at every moment and the President said it will stay that way indefinately.    God, please protect our brothers, sisters, mothers, fathers, other relatives, and friends serving in our military.  God also be with those who have family and friends in Iraq.  Amen.  After Grandma's and Mom's I went over to Joe and David's for dinner and watched "Mother Goose."  I was surprised that I liked it, but it was funny.  Joe made burgers, garlic thingys that are like asperagus, and rice.  For dessert we had ice cream and Tapioca pudding (home made).  Damn he spoils me!  This stress the last month has caused me to gain weight.  :(  Which adds more to my stress level. *sigh*  We had a pill flushing party before I left.  All my Dad's meds were at their house and we dumped them all in the toilet.  Wasn't good to keep them around anyway.  Earlier in the evening I went through a lot of his papers and threw a bag full away.  Still have a ton.  Joe gave me a Monster Engergy drink and I was on my way home.  It's 1 AM and I'm getting tired; I have another busy day tomorrow.  I want to get more homework done.  I'm hoping to get more than one paper done before the end of the quarter so I can actually relax between quarters.  She actually said I could do that, I don't have to work on it the week we're off.  I'm lucky to have the instructor I have for English.  I'm definately not going to take advantage of her generosity.  Anyway, I'm off to bed.  Have a great Tuesday!  -Jason  PS  For some strange reason Grandma this evening said to me, "How much is Dale selling his house for?"  I told her and she replied, "Oh, that's a bit too much."  I had a puzzled look on my face and said, "Um, why?"  She said, "I was going to buy it so you two could stay there."  I laughed and said, "No way!  If the property was owned, maybe."  Silly Grandma.

      Last night I was bumbed so I went to bed instead of writing.  It's funny, I actually felt guilty for not writing last night.  The Blog World has taken over me.  Besides homewor, I went up to Shelter Bay to celebrate my Mom and Uncle's birthdays.  They are actually three years and tow days apart.  I said they were two years and two days.  Maybe my Grandparents only had sex twice and according to my estimate that would be St. Patrick's Day.  My Grandma has always loved St. Patrick's Day.  Wonder if anyone but me has caught this.  I'll ask her today when I see her. lol  I had a great time.  My Uncle BBQ'd salmon.  It wasn't bad, but Mom and I don't care for fishy fish.  Skipper's is usually the only fish I like (some other resteraunts surprise me once in a while).  I saw baby red potatos and got excited thinking I could eat a few of those.  Oh no, they had to have spice on them that I hate (Rosemary).  I was polite and ate it anyway, but that doesn't mean I had to enjoy it.  Don't get me wrong, it was good for being what it was, they just aren't my thing.  At least there weren't mushrooms!!  I spent about four hours there before heading back south.  I was going to stop by my other Uncle's house to visit them and my other Grandma, but I forgot to turn on the street to get to their house and ended up on the freeway.  Had it not been on a stretch of highway where there is not exit for over five miles, I would have turned around.  Gas is too damned expensive.  I came home and chatted on-line and worked on homework, yet again.  The sad thing is, I'm still not close to being caught up.  I'm a perfectionist and these essays are killing me.  While I'm writing about one, I'm thinking the back of my head about the other.  I'm about to scream!  I went to bed early due to frustration and a feeling of hopelessness.  I'm just overwhelmed with having to move and get caught up right before finals.  I also have a final project I need to get busy on for a Batch File presentation.  There's just soooo much to do!  I registered for Summer Quarter in hopes of getting to go.  I also registered for one Fall Quarter class, but still need to figure out the other two.  Well, I better get back to more homework; I have class at noon and it's 10:17.  I'm sure I'll write more tonight as things unfold.  I'm going to Seattle to help Mom get a TV from Fred Meyer's to home.  She can't lift it and I don't want he trying.  Until the next entry, take care!

      Saturday was uneventful for the most part.  Got up reasonably early for a Saturday (8:30) and worked on homework.  I chatted on-line quite a bit.  About 10:45 I took a bath and fell asleep a couple times.  I had to reheat the water twice.  After being in the tub for 2 hours, I finally got out and took a nap; I woke up about 4 PM.  I got up and did more homework and waited for Dale to come home from work.  We talked for a bit and Bruce arrived not too long after.  They talked about realistate and I chatted and worked on homework.  You seeing a theme?  Sleep, homework, eat, sleep, homework, eat, sleep, repeat.  We decided to go to Tulalip Casino for their buffet and then a little gabling.  The buffet is over priced on the weekends and evenings at $16.95.  During the weekdays, it's only $9.95, almost the same thing.  Then to top it off, I wasn't even that hungry and definately did not get my money's worth.  We all signed up for VIP Player cards and received $5.00 cash to use for gambling if we chose to.  I used it and the $40 from the cash machine before we went.  In other words, this evening cost me $60.00.  *sigh*  Got home after 12:30 and now working on homework and about to go to sleep.  Tomorrow I am going north to celebrate my Mom and Uncle's Birthdays.  I'll probably stop at my other Uncle's and Grandma's tomorrow on the way home.  By the way, for Arion, who made the comment my Mom is 19 (silly boy), those were the dates of their birthday's.  Mom is actually 53, Uncle Dave is 55, and Rod is 24.  Night night.

      Today was a busy day in spite of not having classes.  I forgot to mention yesterday Bruce, my fraternity advisor from Eastern Washington University, made plans with my roommate to spend the night here last night.  He showed up in the evening.  Found out instead of one night here to look at property in the northend, the's staying until Sunday.  Dale didn't know this was his intent when he offered for him to stay here.  He is out during the days and stays here at night.  Dale and I went to breakfast this morning; I got my usual eggs benedict.  We then went to Hallmark so I could get birthday cards for people.  I ended up spending way too much money on my Mom's birthday, but I wanted to get her something.  I ended up getting her a couple somethings.  She'll like 'em, but the wallet doesn't. :P    We came home and I wrote my statement for court on Monday.  I'm not appearing, but I'm appealing by mail.  I called the court to notify them I mailed my statement today and that I will not be there Monday.  She told me she would put it on the docket.  I went to the Post Office and mailed it and a birthday card for Rod.  Came home, chatted on-line and worked on homework until Dale and I met Mick and Mary for dinner at La Hacienda in Lake Stevens to celebrate Mick's birthday.  We were there for about 2.5 hours and had a great time.  When we got home Bruce was on the porch.  He couldn't find the spare key hidden (bad week for keys, no I haven't found mine).  I had some phone calls and chatted on-line while Bruce and Dale talked about boring stuff, property, and so on.  Chad, our 18 y/o neighbor that walked in on me masturbating not too long ago, had his court case dismissed.  The whole thing is stupid.  Another friend Garret leaves Tuesday for Job Corpes in Sedro-Wooley.  I think it will be good for him to get away from the substances for a while.  He's a great guy, but alcohol plays too much of a part in his life right now.  I found out one of my friends Larry doesn't have cancer.  Right after I found out this good news I found out Jackie's aunt does have cancer and needs surgery on Tuesday.  Once I get rid of one bad thing, on or two come immediately after.    Dale and Bruce went to their seperate sleeping quarters and I am now heading for mine.  Saturday is going to be a great day I can feel it.  Until tomorrow, dream of better days!

      Well it was MY Friday today.  I don't have classes again until Monday at noon.  Hmmm..what to do with myself?  Oh yeah, homework.  I need to get caught up still in English and the quarter is winding down.  I can't believe how fast this quarter and year are going!  It's almost JUNE PEOPLE!  Today was good.  I am waiting to hear from my instructor on what she wants done with her web site.  She was going to E-mail me files today and I haven't received them.  I'll probably start building her page and then input the information she wants it to have when it becomes available to me.  I spent a lot of time socializing with Jerryn (shirt lifter) and Jackie today in the coffee area.  Jackie and I boy watched, while Jerryn tripped over his tongue over girls.  The boy is one horny SOB...he's a str8 me, but much cuter. LOL  Jackie was right about his butt though, but like I told her, easier access to the hole. lol *blush* JUST KIDDING!  English went well and then Web Design wasn't bad.  I was tired though at the end of the day and hungry.  I went to Skipper's by myself and had dinner.  I came home about the same time Dale did and he and I looked for my keys again...NOWHERE TO BE FOUND!  What the Hell?  It's the craziest thing I have ever experienced.  They are just going to show up in the strangest place I'm sure.  This evening I was tired and didn't go to QUEST.  I just have been looking for my keys, working on homework, and chatting.  Tomorrow for not having school, I'm sure going to be busy.  I am getting cards for my Mom (19th), Uncle (21), and friend Rod (21).  I have a lot of errands to run and many things to do.  *sigh*  Hope you had a great week!  I rate this a B-.  I would have been higher but I didn't get as much done that I would have liked to.

      Today has been a weird day.  I talked with Ilona, one of my computer teachers, and she's agreed to use her for my final project in web design.  I will be creating a page for her.  After class her and I planned for a few minutes.  Classes went well, but I'm stressed about keeping up with JavaScript and getting my assignments done for English.    After classes I went to Joe and David's and hung out at their place until Joe got home.  After he relaxed a while he cut my hair; I think it looks good.  About that time we made dinner arrangements.  Joe and I had dinner with David, Becky and Donna, Becky and David's mom, and Donna's Dad.  We went to the Bothell Main St Ale House.  We all had steak and it was really good.  On the TV's there was San Jose Sharks and the Calgary Flames.  Calgary beat San Jose to win the series.  It was a crazy finish with an open net goal in the last second of the game.  We also watched the Mariners get screwed by a bad call which could have cost them a win.  Back to Joe and David's house I went with Joe.  David took his own car.  Joe and I made a quick stop at Fred Meyer's for dessert.  We watched a Christian series called Penguins or something like that.  It was kinda funny and a good moral for younger kids.  This episode was about lying.  It was weird how the main characters were named Jason (me), Michelle (cousin, but in the show his sister), Grandma (as herself), and Karl (my Dad, but forget the character for the name).  I found that interesting and ironic.  Joe had gotten this movie from a coworker.  I left Lake City at midnight.  I arrived home, checked the mail, and what happened next is STILL a mystery.  I pulled my keys out of my pocket enough to unlock the house door.  At that point, my car keys went somewhere.  I have looked inside and outside and anywhere they could possibly be (except where they actually are).  If the are inside the house, I'm okay.  If they are outside, I'm a little uncomfortable with that.  I have torn everything apart looking for them.  I will try again tomorrow morning to see if I can find them before leaving for classes.  Thankfully I have a spare car key.  All my other important keys, minus my PO Box and another house key (for someone else's place).  Dale even helped look outside and in and not a sign of where they went.  It's more than unbelievable.  They have disappeared and it's driving me crazy.  Anyway, I can't do anything else about it tonight.  I'm going to go to bed and hope to find them in the morning (only a few hours away *sigh*).  If you see my keys, please let me know instead of stealing my car. ;)  Thanks!  Oh yeah, before I forget...Apparently Jackie's sister's friend Cory hasn't been able to access the Internet is why I haven't heard from him.  *shrug*  Who knows, still not holding my breath, but hopeful again.

      I woke up late this morning, but managed to get to class with several minutes to spare.  I was more worried about parking than getting to campus.  I managed to easily find a parking space, which surprised me; others must have been late today.      Jerryn lifted his shirt a lot again today.  I am pretending not to pay attention so I think he keeps doing it until he knows I have seen it for sure.  Not sure, just my hunch.  After class Jackie, Jerryn, and I hung out and give eachother bad times.  I called Jerryn "no-butt" today because I checked his ass out for the first time, mostly because Jackie told me he didn't have one.  He said, "I have one, I just hide."  I said, "Yeah, right, like a turtle?"  He said, "No, it's hidden by the baggie pants."  I might have to ask him to prove that.  It was nice knowing these two know me and like me for who I am.  Ironic that I had thought that on the way to the computer lab.    Reason I say ironic because Jerryn and I were hanging out in the library, when a couple or regulars joined out table.  After a while of silence, this girl all the guys at school think is hot and she got a scholarship at some college to be a cheerleader says, "You hear they're now letting gays get married in Massachusetts?"  I had no idea why she looked right at me.  She paused for a reaction, thankfully the other guy said, "Yeah."  She said, "It makes me sick; they should all die."  My eyes met with Jerryn's and he obviously wasn't pleased.  The other guy said, "Or at least put on an island by themselves."  I couldn't believe it.  Jerryn said his opinion about how everyone should be allowed to do whatever they want and so on.  The awkwardness was short because it was time for them to go to class.  Jerryn really is into this girl, at least physically.  After they left another guy came up to the table that didn't hear anything and made some comment on how hot she is.  Jerryn said, "I can't believe the hate and crap that just came out of her mouth."  I think his view of her has changed a bit.  He had class, but flashed me a smile like everything is going to be okay and told me he would see me tomorrow.  I went on reading like I did during the whole conversation 'til I finished the book.  Classes went well today.  During my web design class I removed my blinder to try to see where our instructor is coming from with our final project.  He asked if everyone was okay with what he came up with and I told him I personally am not.  I'm not interested in science that much and don't feel I would do that great of a job.  I have no reason to get to know the instructors in the Science Department because I will never take classes from them.  He said, "That's fair."  He went on to give other examples of pages available that we can take ownership of and create or repair.  I asked if a specific instructor already had a page and he said no.  I said, "I'll talk with my instructor and see if it would be okay for me to do hers."  He said great.  He went on to explain he knows we can make pages, that's not his intent.  His intents is for us to view this as having a client and taking our skills and applying it to their demand.  Which clicked.  I'm glad I wasn't a closed door to this, because now that he explains it, I think it's cool.  Before that last class of the day, I called Dale to see if he wanted to grab a bite and he said he was going to make dinner.  I told all my classmates my roommate was cooking dinner.  I have no idea why, but I did.  He made pork chops, baked beans, and bread.  It was yummy!  Now I'm home chatting with Jackie and chilling on-line about to work on homework.  I don't know how I'm going to interact with those people anymore in the library.  Even more, I wonder what effect this will have about Jerryn's interest in Miss I'm A Cheerleader.

      Dinner went well this evening with my Grandma, Uncle, and Aunt.  I went up to Mount Vernon afer spending a little while at home listening to HEAVY thunder.  I arrived about 6:30 and dinner was almost ready.  Sheila made German crepes.  Then we all went outside on the deck and chatted.  It was nice up there; sunny and just right temperature wise.  Grandma is getting old (88) and has damencia or Alzheimer's.  Her memory is strong in some respects and very weak and fragile in others.  It's very sad to sit and experience this.  We all went back inside when the sun went behind the trees and chatted some more.  Grandma went to bed and didn't even say goodnight.  I know she was excited to see me and warn out.  She knows I love her and that's fine.  She was exhausted.  I spent some time talking with my Uncle Steve one-on-one, which was very nice.  I came home and went on-line.  I'm still behind on English 101, but hopefully will get caught up soon.  This is stressing me out and I need to get it off my shoulders.  I also need to get my appeal finished and sent to the judge for that stupid lying cop in Ellensburg.  Damn homophobe or agist cop.  I had never been pulled over before and he lied by adding 10 miles per hour to what I said I was going.  I took my Pride stickers off my car after that.  Officer wouldn't even let me see the gun when I requested it twice.  This was back on March 25th, coming from hockey in Spokane.  I'll keep you informed how the appeal goes (as long as I get it sent in time and I'm not behind bars).  I'm off to bed, been a long day since I got up and read when I could have waited.  I'll finish it tomorrow between Operating Systems and English.  That's all for now!

      Today marks the one week mark of having my own Blog.  We have been very happy together minus one episode I learned from.  Since then, I highlight and copy it before I press the submission button.  Thanks again Arion and Scott for getting me interested in it.  I got tired reading Middle Passage last night and finally went to bed sometime after 1 AM.  I finished halfway through the book.  I got up early this morning to read the book.  From 7 AM to 12:00 PM (minus 10 minutes to shower and get ready and about a 10 minute drive to Everett CC) I read.  When class began, I had about 12 pages left.  Class began and I found out we didn't need the second half of the book read until Wednesday.  I was pleasantly frustrated.  I'll finish tonight and that's one less thing I need to worry about.  I looked up my grade for Web Design and I have a 97% for the course.  I missed to quiz questions and it cost me 3% of my grade...Lame-O.  After Web Design I'm going to go home and relax for a bit before heading north to Mount Vernon to have dinner with family.  I'll write more later, probably.  Hope you're having a great Monday!

      Today wasn't very eventful once I started doing homework.  I spent most of the afternoon and evening reading Middle Passage for class tomorrow.  I stopped at 12 AM and will hopefully finish it tomorrow.  I'm halfway done in a 200 page book.  I had Taco Time for dinner and it was pretty good.  They are really slow at making food.  I brought it home, chatted on-line as I ate, and then went back to reading after an hour or so break.  I'm going after classes tomorrow to take care of some more business regarding my Dad in Mount Vernon.  I'm going to talk to his attorney, pick up the death certificates (if I get up there in time), and try to get ahold of the guy that said he was going to buy my Dad's truck back.  After errands up north, I'm going to have dinner with my Uncle, Aunt, and Grandma.  Hopefully things will get figured out on what to do from here regarding school, living, Dad, etc.  Gosh what else is there to say?  Not a whole lot really.  Slow day for the most part.  No E-mail from Jackie's sister's friend. :P  Not that I'm anxious or anything.  Well I think I'm going to close for tonight.  I can't think of anything else right now.  Have a great week!

      Sorry for not writing yesterday (if anyone's even reading this). :P  I woke up in a much better mood.  I don't know what my problem was Friday night, maybe all the stress finally got to me.  I just went to bed and woke up fine.  I told my friend from class, the female, that I'm gay.  She is thrilled and instantly in Heaven and my newest fag hag.  We talked for a long time she is now trying to fix me up with her sister's friend from school.  Will keep you posted on that one.  I went to Becky and Donna's wedding reception last night.  I had fun spent a lot of time with the few people I knew there.  I drank a lot of free Bud Light and was more than slightly tipsy by the end of the night.  Joe made a toast that everyone was talking about the rest of the night, "Remember, marriage is not just a word, it's also a sentence."  We flirted with the str8 bartender that we thought was gay.  One of the other workers there was gay, but I didn't pick up on it 'til the end of the night.  I gave him my number and we'll see if he calls.  After the reception some of us went up to Sam's, a bar a block away.  We hung out there and I flirted with a table of three guys.  They were fun, friendly, and good company.  I wish I had courage to talk to guys like that when I'm not under liquid courage.  *sigh*.  Everyone was worried about me driving home so I went to a friend's house close by and spent the night there.  I got up at 8:30 with a slight headache and headed home.  I wanted to be in MY bed and resting on MY pillow.    I just rested my head no more than three minutes with my roommate Dale opend the blinds in the living room and walked by my door and said goodmorning.  He added, "Want breakfast if I make it?"  I said, "Sure."  Before I knew it breakfast was ready and I had maybe five minutes sleep.  Headache went away quickly.  I didn't drink water before bed last night, that's what gave me the slight headache.  I was going to go up to Mount Vernon today, but decided tomorrow after school would be better.  I'm going up in the evening and having dinner with my Uncle, Aunt, and Grandma.  I just realized as I typed that there is a PFLAG meeting tomorrow night in Everett and I'm going to miss it. *sigh*  Oh well...They aren't usually THAT exciting that I'll live if I don't go.  I have a lot of English homework left to do; I'll be working on that today and this week.

      The morning started out great with my roommate making coffee and breakfast.  I sat around and chatted on line for most of the morning until I went to Triangle Alliance at Everett Community College.  This is the organization for homos that is restarting and last week it was decided I'm to be Secretary, which I thought was going to be cool, and hopefully it will again.    I realized before the meeting that if I'm going to be secretary I need to get some supplies paid for by the organzation (paper, ink for printing, notebook, etc).  I checked out the prices and what was available at the bookstore before the 1 PM meeting.  The meeting began and there were a few people there, double what was there last week.  It's very chaotic with little order.  It's interesting taking a bunch of late teenagers and early 20's that are so gun ho about being individuals and leading them to agree on something in a certain way.  What is supposed to be a peaceful hour meeting turned into a two hour stressful crazy all over the place meeting (physically and topically).  I didn't get the supplies I needed because the store closes at 1 on Friday's.  After the meeting I stopped and got lunch at Paradise Burgers here in Smokey Point.  I had fish and chips; they were good and I was stuffed.  Came home to eat it and then went back on-line where I spent most of the afternoon and evening.  A couple interesting things came up on-line.  I found out an old roommate was interested in my physically, which totally took me by surprise.  It went into great detail at times.  I don't know why, but I don't feel comfortable typing everything on here.  I want to and wish I could be fully open, but I have reservations since I don't know who might stumble upon this.  I don't want anyone's feelings hurt.  Maybe I should have made a more anonymous Blog.  *shrug*  Anyway, I'm feeling defeated and frustrated tonight and I don't want to feel that way.  I'm trying to stay optimistic, but I seem to be easily annoyed.  Like right now my roommate is talking on his cell phone, which he talks loud into it, and it's annoying the shit out of me and it really shouldn't be.  I'm trying to concentrate on this, and it's annoying.  Wish he would go to the other room instead sitting in the spare room!  Grrrrrr!  Deep breath...Nope didn't work.  Oh yeah, I almost forgot.  In all this crap with my Dad, I met one of his friend's named Randy who sold him the truck he had and was going to buy it back for a small amount.  This would be the only money from my Dad's sad life.  I called today to see if I could pick up his payment.  The arragement was to pay the amount in two payments on the 15 of each month.  He has the keys and the truck and I have the title.  The number is disconnected.  I got screwed.  Why am I not surprised...actually I am.  That's why I feel so stupid.  How could I have thought this one person in my Dad's like could possibly be any different than all the other losers he knew?  My trusting screwed me over yet again.  I have the title, but what good is that?  *sigh*  Why does it seem like lately nothing is going right?  Oh yeah, because it's not with the exception of school.  Tomorrow is going to be a busy day!  I am going to a lesbian wedding reception.  They got married last month in Portland.  There are tons of family members from Idaho and other Mormon towns.  This is going to be interesting!  I hate going to things alone.  Another thing adding to my being down.  I relized tonight I haven't really dated anyone since July.  That wasn't even to the stage of love (well, on his part) when he moved to Pullman for WSU.  My last true, loving, long-term relationship ended on December 9, 2000; not that I'm keeping track.  Yeah, roommate is off the phone!  Annoyance fading.  Signing off on a bright note.  Sorry to be negative!  :(

      I just had my first negative experience with Blog life.  I just spent the last 20 minutes doing an entry, only to find "Page Cannot Be Displayed" after pressing "Publish."  Of course being a script, when hitting back, everything is gone.  Enough complaining, onto what I tried to post before, just differently written.  The day started out wonderful.  I slept in this morning, but arrived to my 8 AM class with plenty of time.  I was pleasantly greeted on campus by half-naked guys while standing in the hallway for the classroom to open.  I love spring and summer weather!  Although half-naked men are very distracting, it is strongly encouraged and appreciated.  The straight friend in class didn't tease me with his shirt raising and rubbing of his tummy once, not even twice, but yes, three times!  He knows it drives me crazy and he loves the attention.  Of course I enjoy giving him my attention.  He has wild plans for the weekend.  There are two sisters that want him to come over and "play."  I told him they have good taste in men.  He's so awesome and I love having him at school to talk with and hang out.  Between my first and second class I did homework, socialized, and read blogs (damn new addictions).  I finished a couple assignments, but mostl socialized and did E-mail.    English 101 at noon went well.  I received all the information about the assignments I need to do to get caught up.  I'm just slightly overwhelmed by all the work I have in front of me, but I know I have it in me to get it done.  Holly, my instructor, is awesome and is working with me and told me not to worry about it.  More school work and socializing between my second and third class.  I got caught up in Web Design.  Now I'm caught up in 2/3 classes!  Go me!  English 101 will keep me busy enough.  I do need to do some catching up on learning, but no assignments are outstanding.  After class came home, went to yummy Mexican lunch/dinner with my roommate Dale, and then came home and took a nap.  I was exhausted.  I got up for Quest, my Thursday night 20's group in Everett.  After check-ins we finished the second half of the movie CAMP.  It's a good movie, but a bit cheesey.  I saw it with my friend Justin when it was in the theater.    Now I'm home sitting writing my Blog (for the second time and this one isn't as good) and will probably be in front of the computer chatting and doing homework until bed.  I'm also going to go through some of my stuff to figure out what to keep and what to throw before I move.  As of today I have 18 days until I need to be out and hopefully settled into my own place.  I don't know how or where, but I'm optimistic things will fall into place.  I want to surround myself right now with optimistic and motivating people.  As for now, I'm going to copy, press publish, and hope for the best.  If anything new happens before morning I'll return.  My guess the remainder of the night will be uneventful.  :)  -Jason

      As Scott mentioned in his comment to yesterday's post, I am finding myself addicted already.  It's like having a counselor that sits there an nod their head while I talk and answer my own questions or fine people like Scott and Arion post feedback (since I think you're the only two following my blog thus far).  Today was a really good day.  I was worried about going back to school because I'm stressed about an English paper.  My first class begins at 8:00-9:25 AM.  I originally decided that I would go to my morning class and then go home and maybe return for my late afternoon class.  Jackie, one of my classmates in my 8 AM DOS class gave me a HUGE Rose!  It was really sweet.  I started talking with her on Messenger recently and she's really supportive. My instructor also had a present I was greeted back with a five minute timed test.  I got 100% on it so that's good.  I hung out with some class friends after my first class and we hung at the cafeteria.  They're really cool guys and they've kept in touch while I was away and giving their support.  I can't thank them enough!  One of them knows all about me and teases me daily by lifting his shirt up and exposing his fuzzy happy trail.  He's done this every day he's there since day one.  Even before he knew about me.  He still does it and today he had just done it and said, "The things you miss."  I was thinkint the exact same thing.  He's awesome!  I can talk about anything with him.  English is at 12:00-12:50 and was informal this week she said.  Basically it was to get together and ask questions and get caught up on things.  Holly (my instructor) went over what I missed and will have the things I need tomorrow.  I was so worried about that class, but I should be ok.  There is a test tomorrow, but she's going to give me the review packet and I'll take the test next week.    I hung out in the computer lab for a while as usual.  It was like I never left.  Before my English class I was given a hug by one of my classmates.  In the computer lab I was given another hug from another classmate in my afternoon class.  The older students missed me and inquired about me.  The younger students didn't really even seem to notice I was gone (minus the two I mentioned before).  My 2:00-2:50 class was a little hectic.  I may not be behind in assignments, but there is a lot I missed.  We transitioned from HTML over to JavaScript.  JavaScript is the reason I took the course (other than need it for degree).  I know HTML pretty well, but learned about CSS (Cascade Styling Sheets).  After class I went to the Post Office, Taco del Mar, and then drove to N. Seattle to hang out at David's place.  I was exhausted apparently and it hit right when I got on the couch.  I lied down and fell asleep and woke up hours later.  Just got done talking with Dale (my roommate) on AIM.  He's really depressed about the whole house situation and his parents.  I feel so bad for him.  I hope once he sells his house he'll be done with them and stand up to them for the way they treat him.  They don't like his "lifestyle" and want him to go to church and a counselor to "change".  Tomorrow is Thursday and I will have a busy day.  I'm going to be receive the assignments from English to get caught up.  Then I have QUEST (my 20's group I go to weekly).  Normally I would go to the Everett Underground, but it's still closed due to water damage from a fire above.  I don't have classes on Friday's, but I'm sure I will be busy packing and doing homework.  Actually I'll probably make a trip to Mount Vernon.  I really don't want to pick up Dad's ashes.  I might just leave them there until the day we go to spread them on the river.  I'm optimistic things are going to turn around for me.  Please have positive thinking about me finding a place to live and the strength to get caught up in my work.  Take care and talk with you soon!  -Jason

      Dale's parents paid the outstanding rent to bring us current, which means I'm in the clear for anything owed...PHEW!  I gave the management my 20 day notice that I will be moving out.  The first letter pissed off the manager.  He read it, ripped it up, stuck the pieces in the envelope, and said, "I don't have to take this."  Dale brought it back to me and told me he didn't like that I had written some things about him (the management) breaking rules but expecting the tenants to obey them.  I also said they have poor customer service and don't follow-up with tenants requests.  After I calmed down, my friend Cliff told me I should have only given the 20 day notice and nothing further so I took the first paragraph of the first letter and gave that to him signed and dated.  I told Dave, the manager, that I'm sorry and I put things in there that I shouldn't have because I'm frustrated with Dale's parents and the way they are treating him.  I was almost in tears, but he accepted my letter, my handshake, and my apology.  So now maybe this won't go bad on my credit report.  I also received really bad news about a friend of mine, but really can't say much because they are not ready for people to know.  It's difficult for me because of everything going on this just adds one more thing.  I want to close with some good news...I submitted my mid-term for my web design course and since I wasn't in class, the instructor said, "I will provide you with a "strong hint"."  He went on to say, "Your good work would get a 95% as is. If you make the change indicated above, you could get a 100%."  Needless to say this afternoon I made the change and I'm assuming I now have 100% for my midterm.    My friends, family, and instructors have been so supportive of me during this whole challenging time in my life.  You will hear this a lot from me, I am truly blessed with the people in my life.  My Mom told me growing up, "You'll be lucky if you have one true friend in your life."  Well Ma, I have have so many more than that!  I have even more supportive acquaintances.  I may be not have a lot of money, but I am rich with love and support.

      Today is going to be the last day before I head back to classes.  I have taken the time off to grieve and get things done regarding my Dad, but now it's time for me to take my life back and get back to some sort of routine, but not a rut.  The stress of the day is having to move out of the place I'm currently living.  My roommate is desperately trying to scrounge up money to keep his house.  I feel really bad for him because he let me live here for cheap so I could go to school.  His finances got out of control and I can only help so much financially.  I'm hoping he can pull it off, but not only are the land people after us, but his parents also are nagging him for their loan to him.  I don't like his parents, they treat him badly, and try to "change" him with their religious Bible thumping.  Now they are making him sell his home with no place to go at this point, but that makes two of us.  Last week his Mom gave me a five day to vacate notice, which is not legal, but that's the kind of person she is and she knows that my Dad died and everything.  I have religous family, but they are loving, not hateful.  Even if he can somehow pull off keeping his house, I will be leaving because my time here as run its course.  I'm tired of his parents, the financial strain, and my lack of independance this causes.  I don't know where I go or where I'll come up with the finances, but I'll probably put stuff in storage and then stay on my friends Joe and David's couch for a short time while I figure things out.  Dale's just got off the phone with his parents, and I better go find out the latest.

      Hello and thanks for stopping by.  This Blog was first inspired by my friend Scott and then pressure added by Arion.  Here I am, finally jumping on the trend.  Wow, where to begin?  The last two weeks have been hella crazy and things are starting to fall into place.  I'll try and summarize as quickly as possible...  On Sunday, April 25, 2004 my Dad had a massive heart attack and lost conciousness and never regained it.  I am his only child (adopted at birth at that), my parents are divorced, my Grandma (his mom)has dementia, and his two siblings (one brother and one sister) left the decisions up to me.  Since it is estimated he went without oxygen to his brain approximately ten minutes, there was not much hope.  I waited a week to see if he would come to, but he didn't.  Finally, on Sunday, May 2, 2004, exactly one week later, I had the doctors remove life support from my Dad.  I was there at his side when it was removed and waited for quite some time.  He lived six hours without life support and no family or friends were at his side when he passed away.  This process was one of the most complicated ones I've gone through at this point.  I am blessed to have so many friends and family members that love, support, and look out for me.  My Dad had no money or property so the cremation was a cost to me.  Dad's side of the family is helping me as much as they can to get through this on the financial aspect.  There is no service and his ashes will be taken to a place I know he wants them scattered in the mountains.  I remember from a young age him saying he wanted his ashes placed in Thunder Creek in the Cascades.  That is one decision I didn't have to make and I'm glad I wasn't left to decide whether or not to cremate.  There are a lot of other crazy twists and turns in my Dad's life that I found out when I went to his residence.  I will not go into it too much, but there was an attempt to murder him a week before his heart attack, arrested on warrant (driving on suspended license) when giving his statement to the police about the attempt, not given his medication while in jail, and so on and so on...My Dad's life was far from normal so I don't know why I expected his death and post death to be any different.  I just thank God that I'm adopted!  On top of everything else, and trying to get caught up on school an regain control of my own life, I have to move out of my current residence due to circumstances beyond my control.  I don't know where I am going yet, but I probably will put things in storage and crash on a friend's couch for a while until I figure it out.  Financial Aid for school was denied even though I made less than poverty last year.  Because I'm a single, white, male, there is little financial support available to me at this point.  I'm appealing to see if they can look at current finances, but I'm not optimistic.  Sorry to be so long winded, but I'm sure some of this will be referenced in the future; I wanted to give a little background to lessen the confusion if at all possible.  Take care and have a great week!

      Hey everyone!&nbsp; How's it going with you?&nbsp; I am SOOOOO glad it's Friday!&nbsp; This week was very stressful at school, but I think everything turned out okay afterall.&nbsp; First, Wednesday I had a test and a quiz in logic and two tests in Hardware.&nbsp; Talk about a lot of info to know.&nbsp; Well, I got a 92% on my two tests for Hardware.&nbsp; Then in Logic,&nbsp;*suspenseful drums playing* I had to memorize 18 rules for a quiz, then apply them in the test.&nbsp; During the test, our instructor graded our quizzes.&nbsp; I was freaking out.&nbsp; I figured I would get about 9 or 10 out of 18...I get it back, I got 15/18 and I don't think I could do it again to save my life.&nbsp; It just kinda came to me when it was needed.&nbsp; Then the test, I think I did alright, but will have to wait until Monday to find that out.&nbsp; It seemed too easy, so I am nervous...however, he does give partial credit.&nbsp; Will keep you posted.  Let's see, what else?&nbsp; I got bit a few days ago by something and it's really bugging me.&nbsp; It's swollen my ankle and places hurts in the muscle on my leg to just under my knee.&nbsp; I might have to get it checked if it's not better by next week.&nbsp; A classmate told me her Mom has the same thing, and she's going to the doctor for it.&nbsp; Maybe it'll save me a trip.&nbsp; She said she woudl E-mail me if I was going to die.&nbsp; She hasn't yet.  I still haven't picked up my Dad's ashes and he passed away May 2.&nbsp; The funeral home called and asked me if we were going to still pick them up.&nbsp; I explained that I'm between living arrangements and that the family hasn't decided what we're going to do yet or when.&nbsp; She understood and I tricked her by first asking, "Does it cost anything to store him there?"&nbsp; She said, "No, not at all."&nbsp; I said, "Good, then he might be there a while."&nbsp; I don't want to be one of those people that carry ashes around in the car or stick him in the closet.&nbsp; I know where he wants to be scattered, but the family wants to be involved. *rolls eyes*  Well, to the good stuff.&nbsp; I'm off to Canada for the weekend.&nbsp; It's the anual Vancouver trip with David and Beckey & Donna.&nbsp; God I love it up there.&nbsp; So in preperation for it, I have been going in Vancouver chat rooms.&nbsp; Last night after a fun night at the bar, I came home and went on-line.&nbsp; This guy and I are talking, hit it off pretty well, and then he asks for a picture.&nbsp; So I gave him my web site and he says, "Do you know Tyler from Abbotsford?"&nbsp; I said, "Yes, OMG, he's my ex."&nbsp; He said, "Have fun up here, peace."&nbsp; He wouldn't reply to my question of who he is or anything else.&nbsp; I found out from someone else his .com link and EW!&nbsp; Anyway...just kinda hit me hard considering I was just having a talk with a friend about him while driving home.  Well, I better get ready to go.&nbsp; I will talk more later and might update from Vancouver, time and Internet at the hotel working and permitting.  Have a great weekend and peace!

      Monday wasn't so bas afterall...if you don't count wanting to cry from frustration in Logic.&nbsp; Gods that stuff is confusing!&nbsp; I have NO clue how I'm going to memorize 18 rules by Wednesday.&nbsp; There is a quiz and a test in Logic that day.&nbsp; Those are coming after two tests in hardware on the same day.&nbsp;&nbsp;August 13th can't get here fast enough.  I was so tired after classes today, I came home and&nbsp;took a nap from 3:30 PM to 9:45 PM.&nbsp; It&nbsp;was much needed, but I'm still not rested.&nbsp;   Dale&nbsp;ate dinner and then plopped mine on the table and said, "Your dinner is on the table, it's there if you want it."&nbsp; He turned off all the lights and went to bed.&nbsp; I don't know what his problem was tonight.&nbsp; He seemed okay when he first got home, but he was moody when I tried messaging him on Yahoo!&nbsp; *shrug*&nbsp; Guess I'll try talking to him tomorroow.&nbsp; It probably didn't help that I messaged him and said, "Why you being an ass tonight?"  I'm looking forward to this weekend; I'm going up to Vancouver, BC with David and possibly Becky and Donna depending on how Becky is feeling.&nbsp; She had a heat stroke in Idaho and hasn't been doing too well. :(&nbsp; I really need a break from school and this might get me rejuvinated for the last two weeks of school.  Well, I have more logic to do before bed, so I should probably close for now.&nbsp; Keep me posted on how you're doing and who's actually reading this.&nbsp; I have no clue if this is just a venting place or if people actually read. :P&nbsp;   Hope all is well with you (whoever is out there).

      Hi there!&nbsp; It's 2:55 AM on Monday morning.&nbsp; I just got done with homework for Computers and boy am I exhausted.&nbsp; I spent several hours working on it today.&nbsp; I did take a break to go have dinner with friends.&nbsp; David BBQ'd for Dale, Joe, and I.&nbsp; David did an awesome job cooking ribs.&nbsp; After dinner we socialized and then finally I said, "It's 11, I have a drive ahead of me, and homework to do."&nbsp; We left a bit after that and came home and back to slaving.  Let me tell you, had I been updating my blog like a good boy, you would be sick of reading how how crappy this text book is.&nbsp; I don't mind having questions based on reading, but when the questions don't match up with the text, it's not cool.&nbsp; Anyway, I only have three weeks left and I'm done until September.&nbsp; I can't wait to give this text back.&nbsp; If I didn't have to turn it in, I would do the world a favor and feed it to a shredder.  Saturday night David and I went to a Gilbert and Sullivan production at a theater on the Seattle Center grounds.&nbsp; It was fun and there were a ton of hotties (in the crowd).&nbsp; Only one hottie in the show itself.&nbsp; Go figure....grrrr.&nbsp; They did a great job and the A/C felt awesome!&nbsp; After that we went to Red Robin (the original one by the U-District) and there was a table of 22 with several hotties. :)&nbsp; I'm guessing it might have been a dorm floor get-together or something of the sort.  Anyway, I tried to close my eyes to go to sleep but felt overwhelming guilt of not writing in my Blog.&nbsp; Maybe now my mind is clear and I can get my 3 hours of sleep.&nbsp; Tomorrow I have classes from 7:30 to 2:25.&nbsp; Again, I must remind myself, it could be worse.  Hope this finds you sleeping well (not that you're sleeping while reading this, but sleeping well while I'm writing this...you know what I mean!).  Night night and sweet&nbsp;(wet?)&nbsp;dreams!

      Well, thanks to a friend of mine (cough Arion), I'm going to start posting again.&nbsp; I probably won't pour out my heart and soul as much since I realized this is found on Google under my name.  School during summer is the pits.&nbsp; I would rather have it be a full quarter than try to stuff 12 weeks of information into 8.&nbsp; It's a lot of work and my brain can't handle all the information so quickly.&nbsp; Overall, I'm doing pretty well in spite of it.&nbsp; Logic is a bit much, but I am just aiming to get out of it with a C or better.&nbsp; My schedule is nice only having classes Monday through Thursday.  I've been a little frustrated lately by people on-line and the continued shallowness.&nbsp; It gets old after a while and I can only take so much rejection.&nbsp; If even I were comfortable with my body, others wouldn't be and it doesn't matter.&nbsp; If anyone on-line does show interest, it seem to only be for sex and that's not really what I want.&nbsp; I'm good enough for a fuck, but not good enough to date. *sigh*&nbsp; Sorry, I'm bitching...  I so can't wait for hockey to start in September.&nbsp; I'm so excited and the more I hear about the upcoming season the more I can't wait.  Hmm...what else is going on?&nbsp; Not much really.&nbsp; Just school and school work.  Got a kick out of:  urlLink http://www.JibJab.com  a couple nights ago.&nbsp; I couldn't stop watching it and laughing.&nbsp; I love it.&nbsp; There is another site I can't remember at the moment that is hella funny with a squirrel named Foamy.  Check it out and let me know what you think...I'll try to find Foamy again. :)&nbsp; My favorites are "Small, Medium, Large" and "Fatkins".  Anyway, I'm signing off for now, it does feel good to write.&nbsp; I miss writing, it's one of my favorite things to do (besides cuddling with someone).  Peace!  Jason
