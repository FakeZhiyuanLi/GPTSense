            Why does school requires acting as a part of recitation grade???        Why can somebdy act naturally and somebody can't?       Why is my name "Mendell"?       Why do others backstab other people? Discrimination?       Anyway, som much of these useless questions....        Today's one of my worst schooling days ( I've got worse non-school days : ) )... Our play, though very much unpolished, still manage to scrape a fifteen over twenty.... That's nice of our teacher, but worse thing is, I can imagine myself acting like a puppet before 35 people.... Hmmm...

      Yesteraday, I was sort of daydreaming in our car, when suddenly something popped in my head.....  It's only 2 years before I graduate from hs, what next?  Damn it!  I haven't decided where my future lies!I haven't thought about this, yet I haven't got a clue what course will I take in college? This thought bothered me for a while, then I gave up, Maybe, I think I'm too occupied with the current ongoings that I haven't even seriously considered where will I be in the next stage of life?  BUt then this thought really bothered me, and I guess, Elaine, this answers your question?  Then, something in our English exam a while ago took my attention....  THE VALUES OF EDUCATION....  "You don't recieve education for the purpose of being rich and everything, but you recieve education just to be fit in life"  "Not everybody can be the president, yet everyone does want that position, nobody wants to ba a janitor/janitress when he/she grows up, yet we need them in our society, nobody wanted to be a criminal or a terrorist when they grow up, yet, in this world we are living in, so many terrorist are existing...."  Right?  and others I already forgotten, but, yeah, I really agree with that author, he/she has the same point of view in life as mine.....  What about you guys there?  Decided on what course to take upon in college?  Ever dreamt of being a janitor?  Ever dreamt of helping others while sacrificing yourself?  Or are you just dreaming of your own individual interest only?  Come on, open your eyes to the world!  Wake up!  dmendell bloggin out

           Before anything else, I'm happy to announce that I'll be leaving for China tomorrow.... and away from the damn school, and away from the periodicals, which really gets the soul out of me.... Thank you....     One day before I leave....     Nothing really happened much, except for the plain fact that I have succeeded in our project, It's damned finish... Whew!     Another thing is that I'll not be doing anything in our project in AP tomorow! Rejoice!     And another thing accomplished today, is that I'll not be seeing that Ms. M, for weeks! Rejoice!     Ever experience riding in a jeepney while eating "spicy pork" from "ERSAO"? Well, if not, then better try it!

      After a horrible 2-day experience for me, today was relatively fine for me... I bought a book called "Bourne Supremacy" by Ludlum from NBS after a having a splendid TT dinner with my family...Hmmm.... Then in the late afternoon, I got a free homemeade pizza from my cousin, who is taking HRIM.... So lucky....  But the bad part is, tomorrow's another bad day waiting patiently for me... Monday.... I really wish I'm "home-schooled"....  Another good thing happened this day is that more and more of my classmates has known what Jed "..." are doing-"backstabbing" , like Jean and Ryan and Lady and others....  I am therefore foreseeing a war on II-5 (Jed vs His victims-Kimberly).... How interesting!!  Meanwhile here are some few quotes, check them out....  "Everyone is necessarily the hero of his own life" -- John Barth  "You can discover what your enemy fears most by observing the means he uses to frighten you" --Eric Hoffer  "Everyone thinks of changing the world, but no one thinks of changing himself" -- Leo Tolstoy  "God comes to the hungry in the form of food" -- Mohandas Gandhi  That's all for now..... Smell ya later!--(christian)
