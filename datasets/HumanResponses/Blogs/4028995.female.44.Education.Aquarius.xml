						   This week I really feel like throwing in the towel! I’ve tried blogging to my blogspot twice, and twice lost all the info I typed.  I’m doing it in Word now to be on the safe side.  My last blog was a list of woes and grievances: to recap, my social/family life is hectic, my work life stressful, and my study life depressing.  I am also suffering spiritually.  This Sunday was the second Sunday I’d missed church to work on my studies.  I feel that this is bad for me spiritually and emotionally, and as I am a church leader, it also does not set a good example for others in the church.  If it weren’t for the Joyce Meyer programme every morning at 6, my spiritual life would be very dry.  As it is, I feel spiritually unfulfilled.  I’m beginning to think I should not have done this long-distance course;  maybe I should have waited two years. I don’t think I’ll study in the third term next year.  The third term is very tough:  My Grade 12’s are finishing up and I have all the organization of their Matric final exams to sort out;  at the same time I must finalise the Grade 8 2005 intake, prepare for their information evening, sort out the prize-giving etc.  I’m really downcast about my studies this week.  I’ve tried FTP-ing the webpage I made but no links are transported.  I don’t understand this because all the links work in FrontPage. I even tried Ants’s suggestion of .htm instead of .html but nothing helps. Even my postcard  won’t work.  I managed to post my statement on Games at 8h00 on the dot, but I’m not very proud of the effort.  I only worked on it ½ an hour before closing time because I had to stay at work late to sort out the ICDL lectures.  One good thing – I wrote my ICDL theory test on impulse this Saturday and got 90%.  Anyway, I’m really thinking twice about studying more than two modules next year. I think I must work in the first 6 months and take the last 6 months off, especially as I’ll be teaching Computer Studies for the first time EVER and it will be a lot of new work to learn.  So from a sad Odette  Good night

						   Hi!    This is another Sunday I'm spending at home on assignments. I've been missing Sundays at church to do these assignments and this worries me.  I have a leadership position in the church, and although my pastor is very understanding, it's not good for my spiritual life or my example as a church leader to miss church so often.  If I don't get to watch Joyce Meyer every morning before school I won't have any spiritual strength at all.  Work pressure is pretty high.  The Grade 8 2005 intake must be finalised, and the Grade 12 exam preparations must be completed. I've also got to select my matrics for English Oral moderation on Tuesday and get them to the venue.  My ICDL candidates must be organised and encouraged to go and write the exams.  Everybody is tense at school because the year-end is approaching and the work is increasing.    This weekend was such a busy one. The Matric Farewell was on Friday evening - and I'm so glad that's over so that we can concentrate on work again! - and on Saturday we had a huge netball festival at our school;  my name was down for making pancakes from 14h00 till 16h00.  I also wrote the ICDL theory exam at 9h15 and then shot across to Westering to attend a mandatory seminar by the chief induna of the Assembly of God church in South Africa.  After the pancake making session I had to attend a family braai because my nephew was turning ten and his mother wouldn't take NO for an answer!   Anyway, enough about the personal life. Today is the day I have to ensure that my webpage is loaded to Hagar. I've also just read the unit on games and I'm afraid it's made me want to throw in the towel. I just want to rest and forget that I've even got a long distance course to follow.  So far I've managed to linke currency convertor and translator, and I've managed to get a free floating object going through the page (I still can't make it click to reveal a motivational message, though).  Today I need to finalise all of that and start on my Games module. These journals are getting shorter and shorter, but if I don't keep up the record regularly I forget all that has happened and it fades into an indiscriminate blur!!  See you later Odette

						   THis week finds me in despair.  I have fallen off the bandwagon this week.  Everything seems to be getting on top of me.  With great difficulty I managed to create the Look and Feel Website but feel very dissatisfied with the result.  Spent hours trying to find a poll that worked / connected and eventually gave up.  I was very impressed with the work that some of the students came up with, especially Ina and Helga.  I'm glad Helga won, as she obviously took a great deal of time and effort to make her design truly representative and metaphorical.  I'm sure all her links will work, too!  My next challenge is to create this webpage about Brazil.  As Brazil won the world cup last year I feel a great pressure to do something good!  Unfortunately I have never used HTML before and don't even know where to begin.  I've looked at all the websites recommended on the Sources page, but half of them couldn't download, and I found some of them too vague.  Boogie Jack seems about the best and I followed a basic tutorial in HTML.  This is a foreign language to me.    I have never been good at "self-learning".  I need to be shown / taught hw a thing works and then I can be creative with ideas based on what I've seen.  The old myth that "once you've discovered for yourself how it works you'll never forget it" does NOT work for me.  I find things by serendipity and then forget how I got there.   This course is really a lot more difficult than the othes.  I thought I would do well because all my courses so far have been basically long-distance learning and self-study.  My frustrations are that I want to know how these things work and then go and apply them.  I want to teach them to my pupils next year. I need to develop self-confidence in this area.  I really sympathised with Hambrock (Can't remember names) who was in despair over Hagar et al.  Thank goodness for Ants who continually posts useful information. I always look at his postings because there's boud to be something I could use.  So WebCT vs Hagar. Not one of them works for me!! WebCT was a disaster.  I'll know more about Hagar after this weekend, I hope, but it doesn't look promising so far. I've managed to get into my webspace but haven't even created anything to put there yet!  More later.

						   GETTING STARTED I can see that this can be a very exciting and yet very frustrating time in my life.  I'm not one of those people who can teach myself something from a tutorial or just by exploring what is out there.  I need someone to show me how to do it, and then go from there.    Don't think that if I finally figure out how to do something that I then know it forever after!  It doesn't work that way for me:  Firstly, because I probably stumbled over it by accident anyway, and Secondy, because I can never remember how to do it anyway and will have to go through the whole painful exploratory exercise again to have success.  For example:  posting a picture. I managed to get my own picture on the blog, finally (after I had posted a picture of the Blog desktop by accident!), and now I need to post another one.  Do you think I can remember how to do it????  So it's going to cost me at least another 20 minutes to go through the whole painful process again.  INITIAL POSTINGS AND CRITIQUES After I had read a number of postings about Virtual Communities I realised that I had gone onto totally the wrong track with my version:  I discussed key elements of a learning program instead of key elements of a VLC.  Lookin back, I think my posting deserved a 2 1/2 out of 5.  Critic 2 it a 3 and pointed out my problems, and Critic 1 gave it a 4, although she also spotted the problems.  I don't feel I deserved such a high mark.  I had also gone way over the 200 word limit.  In general I felt the marks awarded were too high - although I personally awarded 4 1/2 out of 5 to a particularly good posting by Helena Schoeman - so do I have room to criticise?   COURSE IN GENERAL I feel frustrated because I don't have much time to to all the work as a result of 3rd term pressures at school.  Once again, I shall find myself following the credo:  "The job doesn't have to be perfect;  the job just has to get done!"  Although the perfectionist in me rises up in horror at that phrase, I have learnt that I must compromise and submit work which is not necessarily of high quality in order to get the work done at all. (Just as an example, I haven't even read through Unit 2's instructions yet !!!! One unit at a time, I say!)

						   Technical Aspects My Support System  Mainly my support system consists of Mark, Candy and Sieg! These are my friends with technical expertise and I regularly cry on their shoulders when I don’t understand the cryptic secrets of my computer.  As two of them will soon be heading off into the wild blue yonder overseas I have to pick as many brains as possible before this happens.  What will I do if my computer crashes?  I’ve had painful experience of this happening – twice! – since I started this course.  My recourse is the school network.  I spend long, lonely hours in the school computer laboratory on Saturdays and Sundays, but the work gets done!  Broad Specs of my Computer  Computer:   Intel Celeron CPU 1.70GHz 		AT/AT Compatible 		97, 776 KB RAM 		  Operating System:	MicroSoft Windows 2000 			5.00.2195 			Service Pack 2   Internet Connectivity  Speed:	On average 44 Kb/s 		Modem connection: Softk56 Data Fax Voice Speakerphone CARP 		ISP:  Mweb 		   Applications I use Application	Details	Expertise Word Processor 	MicroSoft Word 2000 and XP 	4-5 Web browser 	Internet explorer 6.0	3-4 HTML editor 	Basic?	0 Sound equipment:  speakers, sound card, able to generate .wav files	Speakers and Sound Card; MPU-401 Compatible Midi Device	0 Graphics create/editing program 	Macromedia Flash 3?	0  Cognitive Aspects  Previous Experience with Distance Learning  None except what I’ve experienced from the beginning of this year.  I had perforce to be a distance student because I’m situated in Port Elizabeth and can only get to Tukkies three times a year.  So I’ve had enforced distance education, but haven’t really been part of a virtual learning community before.  Current Level of Dexterity using WWW  I feel fairly comfortable.  I use www.metacrawler.com a LOT because I find it suits my style of browsing.  I’ve often been disappointed with other search engines but seldom with metacrawler.  How accessible is the web for me in terms of finances?  That’s a tricky one!  Naturally I’d love to use the facilities at work (we have 24 hour a day access at school) but I prefer to work from the comfort of my own home.  With the help of the Tukkies bursary and a study loan I should be able to keep myself connected for the duration of the course!    My Typing Speed You really know how to put people on the spot!  I took Typing as a matric subject so I’m fairly comfortable with it.  It was the most sensible subject choice I made.  I typed fairly quickly at school and have still retained some of my old skill. (I typed this at 22:20 when I was very tired so I feel quite proud of my achievement!)      My Expectations of the Course  Every course in M.Ed. (CIE) has challenged me so far.  At times I resent the fact that I have to learn so many new things in so short a space of time, but in retrospect I must acknowledge that if the deadlines hadn’t been there, I would probably never have learned to use certain programs.  I expect to learn a lot more about chatting – I’ve only done this once or twice before and must confess that I’m not a natural-born web-chatter.  Perhaps I prefer to see people’s expressions so that I can react to them.  With a structured chat environment and focused topics, I expect to develop a greater level of comfort in this area.  I certainly expect to learn as much as I did with both the previous modules.  I’ve already learned to chat, and how to use a whiteboard!  I’m slowly learning about the basic components of my computer e.g. the sound cards etc.  I’m very excited about being forced to learn how to publish a blog and the various things that go along with that.  Whether I’ll be successful remains to be seen ……
