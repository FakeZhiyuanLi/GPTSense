      I have another site. I own my own domain, design and keep it up. Sometimes the posts there are well thought out and entertaining. It's constructive rampbling. But I just feel like giving that place sometimes. I will not be doing anything fancy to this blog, let not for now. No extraneous sidebar content, no fancy layouts. Just the default template and my words.   Working and going to school is for the birds. I don't understand how people do it. I am enrolled fulltime in art school and I just began working for Gap. Inc. (See how I made it sound all official and stuff?) So anyway, I had a 2 hour Color & Design class yesterday, and work immediately afterwards. I worked for about 7 hours until 10pm. then i had to be back at 8 in the morning to work until 5. My feet are really killing me. I don't see how people do it. this is really gonna kill me and it's all my fault. I keep volunteering for hours because I need the money, not for school, school is free. But I have bills. I'm kind of an adult with responsibilities and debts. And I gotta eat. And be online. And commute, etc.  And they don't pay much by the way.  More later....  (See, I could never post shit like this on my regular page.)

       Hey bitch, that ain't fair Give that horsey back his hair....   The best thing about having friends with URLs is being able to "link-drop" when writing about events like  urlLink Pride . The festivities started last Thursday when I had dinner with  urlLink Prime ,  urlLink EJ ,  urlLink Raymond  and  urlLink The Rock  after work. We won't say that  urlLink SunRay  was pissed that she wasn't involved, and we also won't say that Rocka sent us to a restaurant that no longer existed. No no no. Why go there? We also won't say that we ate at an outside table just as it started to rain.  Friday night. Rocking my low-rise bootcut jeans and a tight red "A Rolling Stone Gathers No Moss" t-shirt from the Gap, I hit it over the to  The Club . My Timbs got all types of fucked up but I was hella fly anyhow.  Ray  and  The Rock  were there, as well as non-linked friends like  NovaJr  and  Artistic Chocolate . Even  MrPhatLips  (of  urlLink Church Announcements  fame) was cutting a rug. I stayed out late enough to hit McDonalds in the daylight for a Big Breakfast Deluxe, then me and another friend of mine alienated some dudes from North Carolina. A good time was had by all.  By the time I was up and ready to meet the lovely  urlLink Steven Fullwood , it was time for him to go. I think I got in about 30 minutes with him. He saw firsthand that I am shy. A lot of you don't know (or believe) this. Examples of shyness: Sniffing around  urlLink Keith Boykin  all weekend and stealing glimpses of  urlLink Michael-Christopher . At the host hotel, I caught about 15 minutes of a spoken-word showcase. Not to perpetuate any stereotypes, but lesbians have spoken word on LOCK. The sistas I saw were just amazing. Funny, engaging, and real. The non-club events at Pride should really be cherished.  No club for  The Slim One  on Saturday night. A bruh was full and tired. I went to bed around 11:30. Don't tell anybody.  Sunday was the big meeting at the Convention Center here in DC. My friend and literary mentor  urlLink Christopher David  was there with  S-Dot  and the kids. I finally bought a copy of his book (gotta support the fam, ya know).  nOvaSlimmer  popped up not too much later to meet his  urlLink Grandpa-pa , and I also ran into my wayward, bastard, nearly ex-son  nOvaShady  who got to meet the  urlLink other grandparent .  Pretty soon,  SunRay  popped up with  urlLink Lise  in tow and we all hit it over to Fuddruckers for some burgers and conversation. There were so many of us that we had to split into 2 tables, which I rightfully dubbed  Sexy Table A  and  Sexy Table B . At Sexy Table A were (1) The Slim One, (2) Lise, (3)  urlLink Queen Sexy , (4) The Prime One, (5) Prime's good friend and (6) another young lady that joined us. At Sexy Table B sat (1)  urlLink King Sexy , (2) Christopher David, (3, 4, 5) S-Dot (and the kids), (6) Michael Christopher, (7) a mutual friend and DC native and at long last (8)  urlLink Mr. Anfanee  in all his cuteness (and lateness). I'm sure EJ has pictures of this up.  After engaging in stimulating convo with MC and CD, I had to re-up for the big party at Dream Nightclub. For the uninitiated, Dream is arguably one of the best clubs in DC and this was the first time the sissies were able to nab it for Pride. Ray and I were gagging over this dude that ended up there, clearly on the wrong night, asking "Where the ladies at?" Dumbass. The Rock was there as well, for some reason he just cannot get his ass out of DC long enough to finally settle in NY. There was grinding, sweating, macking, socializing, and by the end of the night my feet were finished. I went back to my second home and crashed.   In my opinion, this was one of the better Prides, for me at least. Mainly because I had EJ and Prime around to make me feel important and stuff, urging me to meet and mingle with confidence. It was SunRay's first Pride as well and she seemed to have a good time. Some of us aren't really for Pride these days, which is understandable. Every year there seems to be less and less to do. But for me, it's about friends and reuniting, which is always a blessing. If I try to search for more than that, I'll be disappointed every Memorial Day weekend.   P.S.  It's exactly one month away from my birthday. The  urlLink Wishlist  should be in full-effect. Don't be a jive turkey.
