      Congratulations to Rev. Frs.  Michael Goldade ;  Joseph Lester ;  Gabriel Magana ; and  David Thomas , all of whom were ordained by Bishop Richard Williamson today, in Winona, Minnesota.  (Reported in  urlLink Daily Catholic ).  If anyone reading was present at the ordination, please email us with details, and we'll pass them along (sulpicius_severus[at]hotmail[dot]com).  In the meantime, let's thank Christ through Mary that we still have true bishops and priests who make true Sacraments available to the faithful.  [Thank you to Tracy for inviting me to participate in Vox Clamantis.  I trust that VC will develop as an excellent complement to Tracy's web site,  urlLink Apologia  (also linked below); I also trust VC will chip away at the "St. Blog's" hegemony of the "blogosphere" with its commentary from the unwavering, uncompromising traditional Catholic perspective.  VIVE CHRISTUS REX!]

      Helen Westover (whose plight is mentioned in the post below), sent this notice to me -- a notice that shows the extreme importance of sidewalk counseling and demonstrating. Referring to a woman who stopped and truly looked at the picture of the aborted baby, Malachi, during a sidewalk demonstration, Helen wrote this:   "The woman who stared at Malachi was 2 months pregnant. She was driven to Good Counsel in Brooklyn, where she, and her baby, are safe.  "Malachi will one day be recognized as the one little life, the one little death, that galvanized a people, seared the conscience of a nation, and saved his own brothers and sisters."  Because of  one  woman, one sign, and a lot of determination, another woman was kept from committing murder. And the woman's baby was given life and the hope of Baptism.  I remember hearing a story of a woman who entered St. Pio of Pietrelcina's ("Padre Pio's) confessional. St. Pio, to those of you who might not know, was blessed with many of the charismata, including the gift of reading souls. He was able to know exactly what sins his penitents had to confess before they even opened their mouths. To this woman's shock, at the sight of her the Saint raged and ordered her away as he wasn't able to deal just then with what he'd seen. She asked for an explanation and was told that she'd had an abortion -- and that the son she had murdered was to have been a great Pope.   I imagine -- I pray, anyway -- that the woman repented and stayed close to Jesus after that, but consider what might have been if she'd been saved from that sin in the first place...  Thank you, Helen, and to all of you who fight this good fight every day. May your ranks swell...

      There's an anti-abortion warrioress named Helen Westover who was arrested in Yorktown Heights (Upper Westchester) for carrying a sign depicting Baby Malachi ( urlLink Malachi story ,  urlLink Malachi picture ).   Helen's an old pro at fighting abortion -- she's done it for many, many years and knows exactly how to do it and not to do it. She was well within her rights as protected by the First Amendment, but she was busted, charged with "demonstrating without a permit"(!), processed, and had her sign seized. Her court date is 10 August at 7pm in Yorktown Heights, NY, and she asks that as many anti-abortionists as possible show up -- not for support (she's a strong lady, has Mr. Christopher Ferrara as her mouthpiece, and expects things to go well legally), but to make a show of strength for the fight against abortion. There will be a demonstration afterwards.   If you live in the area, or if you can travel, please help this cause, will you?

      I can't believe this madness. I'm sure you're all familiar with Oberammergau, of Passion Play fame. Well, they have a new (to me, anyway) "installation" of "art" there which is supposed to portray  the 14 Stations of the Cross . You've  urlLink gotta see it to believe it.  And you might not even believe it after you've seen it (I'm still struggling). Click on "Exhibition Map" at the upper right, then on the Roman numerals on the image map that appears. Be sure to read the interview with the "artist" -- whew doggies! One quote, "In the new installation for Oberammergau I tried to eliminate Christian symbols more than to integrate them. For me, this context seems to be more universal. That’s why I worked a lot with light, sound, space. I had to find my own way. I was trying to be respectful, careful, but I did not want to be a illustrator of what is commonly known as the Christian story."  He's hired to make  the 14 Stations of the Cross  -- but didn't want to illustrate what's "commonly known as the Christian story"? Who hired this freak o' nature? Why? Why?  Why?

      As you probably know, Hollywood has put out yet another movie bashing Christians -- "Saved!" Of course, those involved with the project say it's not about bashing, and is actually a rather "sweet" movie with a message of "tolerance." Blah, blah, blah. In real life, the movie is apparently about a Christian girl whose boyfriend is gay -- so she sleeps with him to save him. Whatever.  Anyway,  urlLink this commentary,  "'Saved!' Provokes some Christian Wrath," includes this bit:   "Dannelly [the director] defends his work as 'ultimately a very loving film, not against Christianity, but against extremism, which is very different.' He says what is most gratifying to him are the religious viewers 'who get it.' And there have been many expressions of support."  My first comment is that this guy wouldn't know Christianity if it crawled up on his lap and laid an egg; those "religious viewers who 'get it'" are undoubtedly "religious" in the same way John Kerry is.   But I want to know why the word "extreme" has become a slur when used to describe religious attitudes and beliefs? "Extreme sports" are good. To be "extremely hot" would be Paris and Nicole's greatest compliment. "Extreme makeovers" and "extreme workouts" are OK. But to be "extremely" serious about God and what He reveals is somehow entirely "uncool."   The commentary includes this, too: ``The movie is ultimately pro-faith and does make some perceptive criticisms of evangelicals,’’ writes Todd Hertz, a reviewer for Christianity Today’s Web site. He points out the movie seeks to explore and satirize 'the sometimes hateful and hypocritical ways some Christians treat homosexuals and anyone with apparent sin,' as well as 'the Christian bubble evangelicals can live in--presenting their own awards like ‘Best Christian Interior Decorator.’ These criticisms are valid and could make some of us think about our behaviors--and that ‘bubble.’‘’  Well, I'm no "evangelical," praise God, but "Christian bubbles" are necessary, to a point, in a world in which people can get fired for saying "Merry Christmas" or for having a Bible on their desks. You think Mel Gibson will win any big awards for "The Passion of the Christ" in the Hollywood bubble (my prediction: they'll throw him "Best Costume" or something so as not to appear bigoted)? You think fashion designers making clothes for real women will get their hands on a Parisian runway? You think that  urlLink businesses that refuse to sell out  will be rewarded in a marketplace dominated by the monied types?   No, the secular world is its own "bubble" -- it's just a much larger one, sadly, and it's offensive to me that it's alleged to be the only game in town, that it's believed that the niches Christians carve out for themselves are mere "bubbles" while the secular world is "the real world."  And what is the deal with the incessant carping on alleged "Christian hypocrisy"? There is no "hypocrisy" in having standards and falling short of them; that's called being human. Of course Christians sin! Woo! Stop the presses!   Worse, though, than falling short of one's ideal is to have no standards at all, and this is what makes me mad: of course it's easy to never be accused of "hypocrisy" in the way Christians are -- i.e., being accused of falling short of one's own standards -- if one proclaims no standards. But if that's what it takes to make you feel good about yourself, secular person reading this, then keep your eye on the gutter and hand upon the wheel. You'll get to your destination for sure.

      Any comments on this Bill, H.R. 4320, the "Global Anti-Semitism Awareness Act of 2004," introduced in the U.S. House?:  urlLink Text of the Bill    Summary (my emphasis): "To authorize the establishment within the Department of State of an Office to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism, to require inclusion in annual Department of State reports of information concerning acts of anti-Semitism  around the world , and for other purposes."    Section 2 (3) even includes this: "Anti-Semitism has at times taken the form of  vilification of Zionism, the Jewish national movement, and incitement against Israel ."   And there's this in section 3 (1): "(1) the United States should continue to vigorously support efforts to  combat anti-Semitism worldwide  through bilateral relationships and interaction with international organizations such as the Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE);"   And this: Section 59 (b) Purpose of Office- Upon establishment, the Office shall assume the primary responsibility for-- `(1)  monitoring and combatting acts of anti-Semitism and anti-Semitic incitement that occur in foreign countries ...

      In case it's been missed, I added to the  Relics Page  a little entry on a most fascinating place -- the Sedlec Ossuary in the Czech Republic.   In A.D. 1278, the Cistercian abbot in Sedlec (about 45 miles East of Prague) went to the Holy Land and brought back some soil, which he spread out over the monastery's cemetery. Catholics of the area wanted to be buried there, of course, but after 30,000 people died in A.D. 1318 (the Plague got 'em), the cemetery became too full. An ossuary was built to store the bones so that new bodies could be buried in the Holy Land's soil.    In the 19th c., a woodcarver was hired to decorate this ossuary -- and he used the bones stored therein -- the bones of 40,000 souls -- to adorn the place. You simply have to see it to believe it, and you can do so by visiting this site and looking through the gallery:  The Sedlec Ossuary . Requiem aeternam dona eis, Domine...

      A blast from the past, a glimpse into the Memory Hole:  urlLink check out the highlights  from a series of reports by FOX-News about Israel, AMDOCS, spying, drug dealers, and 9-11 suspects. You won't find the reports at FOX-News any longer (magic!), and the entire investigation seems to have vaporized into the ether, rather like the investigation into the anthrax murders. Maybe they'd thought we'd forget. Let's not let that happen.

      "Should Americans be concerned that on March 23rd a bipartisan group of Congressmen attended a coronation at which a billionaire, pro-theocracy newspaper owner was declared to be the Messiah – with royal robes, a crown, the works? Or that this imperial ceremony took place not in a makeshift basement church or a backwoods campsite, but in a Senate office building?"  It seems that the "Reverend" Sun Moon has been crowned "Christ" by some of America's congress-critters.  urlLink Read more here.

      Don't know if it'll actually DO anything, but I came across an online petition to clothing manufacturers and retailers, meant to encourage them to (I know this is radical!) come up with some clothes that actually  clothe  women -- you know, dresses that aren't slit up to the Netherlands, necklines that don't reveal 90% of those new implants we're supposed to have in order to be "sexy," and so forth. So, for what it's worth, here's a link to that petition:  urlLink Bring Back Modest Clothing Petition

      Wow... came across  this little news story , which is a tad dated but fascinating nonetheless. Apparently, the ultra-charismatic "Toronto Blessing" afficianados experienced (are experiencing?) "miracles" by which their teeth turn(ed) to "gold."   And here I'd thought that miracles were for the spiritual or temporal benefit of Christians. Who'd want a mouth full of gold teeth? What purpose could they serve? Wouldn't it be better if the "miracle" replaced the need for Crest White Strips? It's all just so -- so "gangsta."

      As I acknowledge in the latest entry in Pro Multis (see links), I highly recommend a web log entitled  urlLink Deconsumption .  While primarily secular in flavor, the web log (and web logger) has good insight into the crises (monetary, resource, economic, political) that are here and/or impending in these latter days.  It's good reading, and it touches on truths about the New World Order that are not widely-discussed in other secular sources.  Our Lady of Fatima, pray for us!

      Just in case this got by you, Bush wants to  urlLink screen every citizen for mental illness  so we can all be put on SRI inhibitors, ritalin, and whatnot, thereby making the pharmaceutical companies richer and keeping dissent levels low (dissent from the neo-con agenda would, I'm sure, be seen as a sure sign of "mental illness." Why, just speaking of "neo-conservatism" is "anti-semitic," and "everyone knows" that  urlLink "anti-semitism" is a "virus"  that causes irrationality in the "goyim." Just as depression is "caused" by a too rapid uptake of serotonin and is cured by Paxil, those who don't worship at the feet of Eretz Israel could be cured of their virus by some chemical concoction or another.)

      From  urlLink AOL's news  (you probably have to be an AOL subscriber to visit that link):  "President Bush, seeking to mobilize religious conservatives for his reelection campaign, has asked church-going volunteers to turn over church membership directories, campaign officials said on Thursday.  "In a move sharply criticized both by religious leaders and civil libertarians, the Bush-Cheney campaign has issued a guide listing about two-dozen "duties" and a series of deadlines for organizing support among conservative church congregations.  "A copy of the guide directs religious volunteers to send church directories to state campaign committees, identify new churches that can be organized by the Bush campaign and talk to clergy about holding voter registration drives."  --- no truly conservative "church congregation" will support the empire. Down with Bush, down with Kerry. To paraphrase Archie Bunker (though I'm sure some smart aleck liberal would find it too delicious), "Mister, we could use a man like Pat Buchanan again." But I'd be even happier with a truly Catholic King...

      Vermont: A statue of Our Lady was draped in a flag and burned (I wonder if they'll consider calling it a "hate crime"):  urlLink Read the story   Please say a prayer in reparation:  "O Most Holy Virgin, and Our Mother, we listen with grief to the complaints of thy Immaculate Heart surrounded with the thorns placed therein at every moment by the blasphemies and ingratitude of ungrateful humanity. We are moved by the ardent desire of loving thee as Our Mother and of promising a true devotion to thy Immaculate Heart.  We therefore kneel before thee to manifest the sorrow we feel for the grievances that people cause thee, and to atone by our prayers and sacrifices for the offenses with which they return your love. Obtain for them and for us the pardon of so many sins. Hasten the conversion of sinners that they may love Jesus Christ and cease to offend the Lord, already so much offended. Turn thine eyes of mercy toward us, that we may love God with all our heart on earth and enjoy Him forever in Heaven."
