      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Footloose  ended Sunday... I'm going to miss it so much. We  sold out  9 out of 11 shows and I got to meet Kevin Bacon and Kyra Sedgwick. I worked with two equity actors. Cullen Titmas who was playing Ren (Hehas toured nationally) and Jimmy VanTreuren who was playing Rev. Moore(Appeared on Broadway's Scarlet Pimpernel and sitcom Law & Order)  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm in  Footloose  denial... I can't sleep. I stayed up till 5 a.m. cleaning my room, watching  footloose  and talking to Peter.   &nbsp;   IN THE FOOTLOOSE CAST CHAT???    Sean:  even i'd bang that shit   Angela:  cullen?   Me:  sean would bang?   Sean:  yeah, his voice is freakin' outta this world.&nbsp; i'd do whatever it took to hear that beast scream out my name.&nbsp;  hahahahahahaha    &nbsp;   August 1st – 7th  I will be in Manhattan for TVI Actors Studio film intensive workshop. If you want to get together for dinner or something defiantly let me know. I called Joanne today to start voice again. Hm... what else did I do... yah thats it. I'm going out to eat with Steph Hemroth tommorow! I haven't seen her in foreverrrrrr...

      I'm having a great time at TVI Actor's Studio. We worked on monolgoues, scene work, cold readings and standup comedy (ahh). I met a casting diector who recommended me to two agents. I also met a guy on broadway who was friends with Marshall Pailet (I did a show with him in NYC when I was 12).   I met some really amazing people. There's Sam, she's so great and soooo wild haha. And Melissa is the nicest person in the world. My dad and her mom talk all the time now at class, it's cool. Maura is so hott, Umbach girls are craZy and Robin, is just Robin. Sara, Sam, Melissa and everyone, we're all going to see Rent... yes!

      Footloose Teen Seminar!!!! I had such a great time. The sleep-over was amazing.  We started out by playing a really bad volleyball game. Then we went in the pool for a really long time. We went out to eat. Since I know Hopewell Junction sooo well we went to Titmusu? Ahh no clue, all I know is my contact was stabbing me in the eye and Kaiti saw her friends (looked 5 years younger than her but was actually her age).  ::I love the Decker::  Back at the house... my eyes started watering and I couldn't stop sneezing from Jess's cats. Me, Sean & Rob went out to get allergy medicine but it didn't really help. We got back and talked alllll freakin' night. We didn't go to bed at all. I obsessed over me wanting a chocolate milkshake (I finally got one on the way to the city) and chicken.  Rob had to leave for work at 3 AM, he came back around 6ish. Our plan was to have Emily and Kaiti to hookup while everyone else was "sleeping" when Rob came back to freak him out... but no that didn't happen.  What else? Well... I love you all. I'm going to miss you so much. We have to go see Hello Dolly together!
