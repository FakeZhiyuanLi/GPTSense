       Well, I did go to the movies yesterday! It was me, Ashley Bevan, Alicia Simpson, Alicia's boyfriend Chris, Alicia's step~sister Felicia, Nick Spinelli, and Aron Spurgeon. See, me and Ashley wanted Brandon to go...(she wanted to meet him) but I couldn't get a hold of him lol!! We had fun though lol...the movie was at 7:45pm, and went till 9:30. Then we walked to Alicia's lol...it took us like a half hour or 45 minutes, in the dark lol but it was fun. We hung out at Alicia's till about 10:30...then Alicia and Felicia had to go to Alicia's moms (Felicia's dads...confusing huh lol? I know). So then, me, Ashley, Nick, and Aron walk down to the corner where there is a park, and wait for Ashley's mom to come pick me n her up. We were down there from like 10:40 till 11:35...lol it was great...dark lol, but great. After me n AshBash left, Aron and Nick walked back to Aron's house...which is like 2 blocks over...and trust me, their blocks over there are short lol. But yeah I had fun last night!  Today...man today I woke up at 8:15, and was ready to go by 8:30...I went with my dad to go clean a dentist office. Got paid beeeotch! lol...then at 10:30, I went to Melissa's, and then we went to Eastwood Swimming Park for the P.A.C. picnic. lol we had fun...we swam in the FREEZING, I repeat, FREEZING cold water lol...then we played volleyball...then we repeated that...the second time we played volleyball...we played for a long long long time...we played with a bunch of drunk adults...it was me, Melissa, Tyeson, Aaron, Brandon, (lol me, Melissa, and 3 brothers lol how fun!!) and one adult...and then we switched and stuff lol, but it was fun. Man this one dude was so drunk lol...hahaha!  But yeah, I'm here now, thinking about a bunch of things...wanna know? Ok...I'll tell you anyways...  Brandon...just in general lol...idk why?!  Aron...same...and also thinking about last night...again idk why?!  Volleyball tryouts tomorrow...man I think I am gonna suck tomorrow, cuz I am gonna be sore, plus my sunburn! Grrness  School lol!

      Man, today seriously effin sucked. Volleyball for me was horrible! I mean since today was the last day of conditioning before tryouts, we played 2 games, and then you could either scrimmage, or work on things with coach. Well we played 2 games of dodgeball (volleyball style, which is different from normal dodgeball), then we played 3 games of Snake...(it's a serving game). After that, I went off with coach, and a group of others. I practiced setting, and then i went with group and did passing and hitting. Then we did a 'freeball' drill...and I just kept sucking...I'm just pretty mad...I don't know why I'm so upset over it, but yeah, you know. Anyways, I might go to Ashley Bevan's tonight...and then tomorrow, we might go to the movies with Nick Spinelli, Brandon, and Alicia...but who knows. Hopefully we will get to go. Oh yeah, and tomorrow, I also have a carwash for volleyball from 10am-2pm...but I'm only going from 10-12.  Well yeah, I'm gonna go now. Talk to you later...maybe...

       So far, this summer has been alright...kind of boring...but you know. I finally started talking to some people I haven't talked to in a while, like Sam, Colin, and a few others. Here are some updates...lol...  Yeah, I   think   I like Brandon...but I'm so lost and confused...I don't know what to feel anymore...  Volleyball conditioning has started, and it sucks because it's right in the middle of the day...3:30 to 5:30! grr...tryouts are August 9th to the 11th...Debo (our Varsity Coach...also known as Coach Brown), and Coach Golden (our Junior Varsity coach...who is a total grrness!)...yeah they are making cuts this year...so yeah hopefully I will make it...I think I will...but idk...  Yeah man, I can't think of anything else really...I mean I haven't really written much in here anyway, so what's it matter...no one reads these anyways...  So uh yeah...I'm gonna go...lots of love!
