      I'm trying to figure out how to get pix onto my blog. I'm having problems. I'm not sure if its me or what. Oh, well... I'll keep on trying. Also - I want to say congrats to Kevin - he just got his first real job since college! Yay, Kev!

      My parents are selling their business! For the past 10years they have been doing pony rides and moonwalk rentals for birthday parties and company picnics, etc. I loved it growing up (most of the time). I'm so sad that my kids won't have cool parties now. :-( But the business has been rough on my parents and I know it'll be good for them to have some time off. Hannah and Kyle will not know what to do with themselves. We've had the business as long as they both can remember. Anyway.... it'll be interesting to see what happens now! God has plans in store we don't even know about yet, I'm sure!     This is my Pop (Jeff) and brother Kyle posing for a pony ride picture. They're good looking men aren't they? Maybe I'm a little bias, oh well.     This is LuluBelle, she is a sample of some of the moonwalks that they rent out. She is one of the cooler ones. They were so much fun! I'm gonna miss having easy access to all this cool stuff.

      cAAre-group was great on Friday. I really enjoy our group. Good fellowship, good conversations. I can't wait until we go to the lake together. It'll be good to relax together! The girls are awesome! Most of us have known eachother for years and years and that helps make it a really laid back group. In the pix is Brittany, Judi, Jess Beth, Lauren, me, Kristie and Karyn. I love those girls! he he

      I'm a part of a care group. Its made up of out of high school, out of college, just married but not married w/ children, young people from Grace Fellowship Church. We're a great group. We are focusing on fellowship, building relationships, getting to know eachother better. We have a good time together. Here is a pix of most of our group at one of our regular meetings.

       My sister Hannah had surgery yesterday. It went well. It was a new experience for my family. We have never had anyone in my immediate family be in the hospital much, not at all for surgery. Here is a pix of my sis Hannah and I.

      My friend Jess' car is being stupid. Its broken down on her twice in four days! Yuck! I wish cars didn't have problems. But then all the mechanics would be out of jobs... dang. Oh, well... random thoughts from Wani. On a lighter note... my husband and I are going to the lake this weekend. I'm looking forward to it. In a few weeks we are taking our Care Group there, and in September the youth group is going. We like to share my inlaws' lakehouse as much as they will let us! Its so nice there. One of these days we'll get some pix up here. I went to a baby shower the other day. It was so cute! And there were like four babies there... it just feeds my need to have a baby of my own. I can't wait! Ah! But God will let me know when its my turn, I'm sure. I just wish I knew when that was gonna be!
