       hey guys. today was actually a good day. ya know. things were going well. having a good time and laughing and such. and then on the way home from physical therapy i saw one of those crosses on the side of the road that people put up for people that died. and i go "oh look mom, thats so sad, someone died right there." and as we got closer i was able to read it and it was the cross for my friend brett that died recently in a motorcycle accident. and i started to shake really bad. and i go "omg mom thats bretts." and i started crying so hard and i couldnt stop. the stop sign was still bent over that he flew into and broke his neck on. and things kept going thru my head so i came home crying hysterically and i talked to one of my good friends and that made me more sad cuz i kept thinking about it so much. so i went into my room and wrote a poem and that calmed me down. oh yah. for those of u that dont know. thats the way i deal with things. i write. but omg it was horrible. see (me complaining), i do have good days but then theres gotta be something to ruin it completely. AHHHHH !! but enough of the complaining. stephs up in orlando for the next couple days trying out for AMERICAN IDOL !!!!! she'll make it. i know she will. shes amazing. very nervous for her tho. mike can call me tonight. but i dont really know what to say to him. i just want things normal. but that cant happen. it kinda just feels like nothings going right for me right now. something go right !!! i just need someone that will just ALWAYS be there for me. ya know. anyone else feel like that ?? alright im out. more later or tomorrow. -kristin-      current mood: sad   current music: "hating every minute" -alkaline trio   current clothes: volleyball shirt and soffees

       im sorry my first entry is kinda depressing, im in a bad mood.    hello there boys and girls. i have nothing else to do with my life. so im giving those of u that have no life too something to do. lol. my life has pretty much sucked lately. but more about that another day. ive had crazy amounts of homework this weekend. kate moved out the other day and i havent seen her since then. but i went to church yesterday with the fam. and after church we went out to fooding with the gma, the gpa, uncle greg, aunt dee, stevo, and his little friend christian. i got a good laugh from them. it made my life a little bit better. im one of those people that may be feeling so horrible on the inside, but play it off and smile like nothings wrong. anyways. this morning i woke up extemely early so i could finish my homework before the day was over. gay. then went to the mall with kell to shop for shoes and dresses. nothing. oh yah i cut my hair a little. its good i suppose. i havent talked to mike for a couple days cuz his phone is broken or something. omg i miss talking to him a whole lot. my life pretty much sucks without him. we got in a little/not so little fight earlier this week. no details. but when were not okay, it kinda throws my whole life off. anyways. i think im done here. im actually gonna update it everyday this time. oh by the way, if u havent seen "the notebook, do yourself the favor. ive seen it quite a few times and i cry hysterically everytime, simply because its my life put into a movie (minus the whole alsheimers and old people and such lol). i may put some of the songs/poems that i have written on here. but i dunno cuz there kinda personal. anyways. hope ur life is goin better then mine.       -kristin-
