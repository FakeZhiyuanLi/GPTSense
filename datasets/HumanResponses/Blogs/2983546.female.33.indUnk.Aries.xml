      I weighed this morning and I am down another 3 lbs, so that's 55 lbs total lost. I am not weighing every week usually so I won't necessarily weigh next week. But who knows, maybe I will. I forgot to mention I am doing the 12 week PCOS plan for the second time around and tomorrow begins week 2. I was able to get supplements I needed finally yesterday (multi, Vit B6, Chromium, Vit C and Inositol) that I have desperately needed for awhile. Ah, if we could always afford organic, but we can't, it costs too much. We usually buy about half organic though and there is a food buying club we belong to here where we can get lots of fruits and vegetables that haven't been sprayed and they taste much better. We can get meat too that is a notch above the grovery store variety, so that keeps Kim happy :). I am looking forward to the finish of the next 3 weeks. I hope to be down to size 16! I can only dream, so who knows. We will see.

      Well, to anyone who is interested, I (ok, my husband Kim) created this blog for me to record my progress in losing weight and becoming fit. So to start off I want to briefly tell you who I am and then give you my "history".  My name is Mary Siever, I am 33 years old and my husband Kim and I have been married 9 years. We have two children, Sinéad (5 years old) and Regan (3 years old). I am a childbirth educator and a Natural Family Planning teacher (if you want more info on NFP just ask). I have been struggling with my weight on and off since puberty.  A few months ago I received a diagnosis for  urlLink Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome  (PCOS). This was something I suspected I had 2 years ago, but it took a bit to get the diagnosis because, number one, my Glucose Tolerance Tests always came back fine, number two I DO get pregnant (albeit with difficulty) on my own (i.e. I do ovulate spontaneously) and I don’t have polycystic ovaries. I also don't gain weight in the "typical apple shape" (I have a defined waist) but I learned that this didn't really matter. Insulin resistance, hormonal problems, irregular menstrual cycles and recently, excess hair growth are my main problems (well that and over weight). Weight problems are pretty common among PCOSers, however not all PCOS women have weight problems, nor do all have the typical figure, or the hair thinning (I don't have thinning hair), or the coarse hair growth, or small breasts (I don't have this either!), etc. Many women DON'T get properly diagnosed and many don't get diagnosed at all because they don't "fit" enough of the criteria. There is also a lot of misinformation out there. If my doctors, as a pre-teen and a teenager were more on the ball I may have had a diagnosis a lot sooner. However, that is water under the bridge and being older, wiser and more responsible; I take my health in my own hands and don't rely on doctors to give me a magic pill. I prefer being proactive when it comes to my health. My experience has been that I get more answers this way. This is no offence against my doctor. I respect and appreciate him because he respects and appreciates me and listens to me and really that's all I need.   So, this is the REASON I have struggled with my weight, however it is not an excuse. With PCOS my chance of Type II diabetes and heart disease increases and fertility is a long hard road. With the fertility issue, it took us 2 years to conceive our oldest after miscarrying our first after we had been married (and trying) for 10 months. When I got pregnant with our son, it took 2 cycles of trying. I thought my fertility problems were over, but they were just beginning. This was before I knew I had PCOS. We have now been trying for a year and a half with no results, although I chart my cycles religiously and I am very aware of my body. I can usually tell within a few days of my cycle if it will be a good one anyway. Hormones have been whacky the last couple of years.   Now I also prefer to go the "natural" route with pretty much everything I do. I don't use pharmaceutical drugs and only would in an emergency situation. I don't believe they are useful for healing and I have had much success with herbs, homeopathy, bodywork and other natural remedies for healing. I have been using  urlLink vitex , which is a wonderful herb for PCOS and it has given me some benefits.   But on to the weight issue....as I said I have fluctuated over the years and in recent years I was the lowest I had been in ages shortly before Kim and I got married. I had been eating healthy, exercising daily (power walking, strength training), but somehow I got out of the habit of that. I would go back and forth, improving some and then falling back into old habits. I have been a vegetarian for nearly 17 years and though I knew I SHOULD be a healthy vegetarian, I wasn't really. I began learning more about nutrition in order to "force" myself to do what I needed to do, but it wasn't easy. Much easier to eat junk food and listen to the taste buds. My portions had been increasing; I was eating more breads and pastas and ignoring what my body has been telling me. It was making me sick, tired, disoriented, foggy, cranky and FAT. The exercise I did continue to do was only maintaining my health, not improving it. I needed to kick it up a notch.   This past January I got serious. I began working out three times a week at Only Women's Fitness urlLink  . I knew I needed to eat better but I wasn't yet committed. That came about a month later. I was frustrated because I had only lost 9 lbs. I had started out at 291 lbs (I am 5"10, medium frame) and a size 24/26. I had NEVER been this big that I can remember! It was really demoralising (yes I avoided mirrors). So I was down to 282 lbs. Urgh. In February I started a 12 week PCOS program that incorporated nutrition, supplements (herbs, vitamins and minerals, not weightloss supplements) and stress coping mechanisms. I had already been doing yoga for the last 5 years so I just added this to the program. Low carb is usually what PCOSers do, but I changed this a bit and decided (with the encouragement of my Internist) to do a low glycemic type eating plan. I cut out refined sugar, white flour, junk and processed foods and for the time being, potatoes. I keep my bread/pasta/rice meals limited as well and focus on whole/multi grains.    In February I lost 12 lbs and 20 inches on my body. I went down a size. In March I lost 15 more lbs and almost 10 inches on my body and decreased another size. In April I lost a further 16 lbs and 6.5 more inches, so far bringing my total loss to 52 lbs and 35.5 inches. I am currently between a size 18 and a size 20. My nutrition has improved wonderfully and I am increasing my intensity and strength regularly. I go the gym 4 days a week, do 6 days of cardio exercise (at the gym I run on the treadmill and that is exciting. I have wanted to "be a runner" for a long time) and do weight training at the gym 4 days a week, increasing the weights I lift every couple of weeks. I do 2 days upper and 2 days lower so I can get more of a workout on each every time. I do yoga 5-6 days a week, stomach crunches 5 days a week and do exercise videos at home. I am looking to add another activity; preferably outside (well I really have to start running outside). My goal is to lose another 65-70 lbs, get to a size 10 and run a race next year.   I have found the true key to permanent fitness is proper nutrition, regular good exercise (you have to get that heart rate up) and attitude change. I won't ever go back to eating junk food or decadent desserts (my treats are sugar free, no not aspartame, candies once in a blue moon, and Tropical source chocolate bars once in awhile) or processed foods anymore. Ever. My goal is control over my health and well being. This is what works for me. I have a wonderful supportive husband and the knowledge to make the changes and the health to do it.  I will post more of my progress as I go along and as soon as I figure out how (oh Kim....) post pictures up too. Whew long post. If you read this far thanks for sticking with me :).

      I was reflecting on my "odyssey" as Kim terms it and thinking about the whole issue of losing weight and getting healthy and realised that it really isn't about weightloss. That is a definite bonus, and certainly it is the "outward" proof and sign of what I am doing. But this whole journey is truly about something else.   It is about gaining control over PCOS. I view this as a war of sorts; over this condition that I didn't ask for or want, and yet I have. It is a lifelong condition that leads to other health concerns, some more serious than others and some just more frustrating. I know that I am not as bad off as some who have it, but at the same time, my symptoms have been getting worse as I get older and taking over my health and fertility more and more. That is the frustrating and disheartening aspect of it.   So as I have been changing my health and in the process losing weight (because really it is crucial for gaining control over this) and becoming stronger and fit, I am switching the balance of control from PCOS to ME. This is what I find to be my true triumph. I am seeing some of my symptoms decrease and THAT gives me the greatest satisfaction. It was the diagnosis of PCOS that made me say to myself “Uh uh, I am NOT letting it be in charge. I am not going to give in to it, if it's the last thing I do". So each improvement, each pound lost, each inch I lose is a tiny score in this battle. I know it is going to be lifelong. So that is life. I can accept that as long as I know what it is I am dealing with. I won't ever let it gain control over me again.   Like I mentioned, I don't have the same battle that many have with it. My hormones are out of whack, but I can and do ovulate on my own. I am not dealing with thinning hair, or too much Hyperandrogenism.I don't have cystic ovaries or enlarged ovaries or chronic pelvic pain. I do have SOME (though not as bad as many have)hirsutism and insulin resistance (though it isn't detected through tests as being severe. Personal experience has shown me it is bad enough as long as I am ignoring it). So it isn't the huge battle it can be for many other women. I have heard that there are women who have completely eradicated their symptoms through lifestyle change and my goal is to do just that. Like I said I am not letting it take over my life anymore.   There are days when I feel like cursing the fact I have it. I wish I could be a "normal" woman, because with PCOS, it is a struggle to "feel" like a normal woman. Then there are other days when I am thankful I have it and not something else more serious, and thankful that I do have it because it has taught me to be more aware of my health and wellbeing. I suppose it is really how you approach it. Is the cup half empty or half full? Most days it is half full.   And it keeps getting more full as I see these symptoms deteriorate.

      Kim is away until Thursday for training in Vancouver and we are missing him but I am not going to go to comfort eating! Don't worry :) I am down a total of 66 lbs as of this morning. I am having good workouts too. We went to the gym this morning and will tomorrow and Wednesday (can't rely on any evenings as Kim isn't here)and then probably Friday or Saturday. I am going to work on improving my yoga practice. I haven't really done that yet! I wish I could work with a teacher but that's not in the budget right now. I do it well on my own and even so my flexibility has increased, so I can do it.   Nothing else to report. And nothing else I can think of to write about so that's it!

      So here are my updated "stats". I weighed and measured this morning and I am down 11 lbs in the last 4 weeks for a total of 63 lbs lost since the beginning of January, and 7 inches lost in the last 4 weeks for a total of 42.50 inches lost.   I am pleased with the results. I also increased my speed on the treadmill and it feels good to be running faster. I look forward to how my endurance will improve as more weeks go by. I am also pleased with how my body is shaping up as my muscles are developing. Weight training is important for so many things and definitely, for how one's body looks. I have to kick myself that I ever slipped up doing it (about 10 years ago and more I was weight training more regularly), and won't ever stop doing it.   Anyway, so that's the report for 20 June. I will do unofficial weighing a couple of more times in the next month and then the "official" weighing and measuring on 16 or 17 of July rather than the 18th, because I won't be able to update that day.  I really do love how I am feeling and I do think it is making a dent in my PCOS. Let's hope!

      When I first began looking into what I needed to focus on eating or not eating as a PCOSer (though I already knew that white flour, refined sugar, junk food and most processed food was out anyway, of course), most people were talking about "low carb". I wasn't too keen on it for a few reasons, the first being that I am a vegetarian and do not intend to become a meat eater. I don't believe meat is always unhealthy, but I also don't believe it should be the primary nutrition, which it seems many Atkins advocates seem to think (bacon will NEVER BE HEALTHY lol).   So anyway, onto the  urlLink Glycemic Index . The glycemic index is a ranking of foods based on their immediate effect on blood glucose levels. It isn't a "diet" program" but an explanation of how the foods are likely to affect a person, especially those who are diabetic, pre-diabetic and insulin resistant. My personal belief is that the modern western diet has created a need for this, as so many foods are being simplified and refined. So many people rely on convenience foods and have lost sight of what food is really supposed to be...nourishment for our bodies, and so many of the diseases that were virtually non-existent a hundred years ago, or at least very rare, are becoming more prevalent today. Not all are related to the glycemic index of course.   So anyway, I focus on glycemic index and on "portion" control. Or in other words I use real serving sizes now instead of the McDonald's supersizing plan. It has made a difference. My appetite several months ago was controlled by my blood sugar and insulin levels. I had little idea of how food even tasted. I had little idea of how it was nourishing me or what I really needed. Not that I was eating a lot of junk food. But I ate too much refined bread and easy to prepare foods. We don't have junk food in our house, and rarely have had it here. Same with sugar, though in the past I would indulge my sugar cravings (and sugar cravings are really really nasty. You really have to go cold turkey and not touch refined sugar and very little natural sugars to develop any control over it.)In spite of the fact it was affecting my mental and physical functioning. It's a hard addiction to break. I really feel that refined sugar is a poison and the fact that it is in SO many foods makes it even more difficult to avoid. However, it’s not impossible. You just have to learn to read labels constantly and eat most foods as close to the source as possible.  I really feel the key to PCOS control and just general good health is in eating nutritionally. And nutrition doesn't come in a box, it comes in the food that has been grown and created to nourish and strengthen our bodies. Excercise is also important, because we live in a sedentary world, where most tasks are now conveniently taken care of. So that's what my main focus is, eating nutritionally and excercising regularly and intensely. It's working :) Now to get my hormones balanced. That's not as simple as the other, but I think it is beginning to happen. I will have more of an idea if it is happening in the next month or so. Ah the fun of PCOS.

      As I already mentioned, I run at the gym 4 times a week and what I am using is a variation on the Body for Life interval training. It has really helped me increase my speed and intensity sooner and more steadily. I think I would have given up if I weren't doing it this way because by the time I have finished my cardio workout I am almost wiped out. I recover soon enough but it really pushes me to the limit. Whew. I love it though! I wish I could go back to high school and show my old gym teacher that I actually am BECOMING a runner! I hated it in high school.

      For the past 5 years, I have been practicing yoga almost daily. For the first year I did it on my own and after that, began classes, which was a smart move. For the past couple of years I have been back to doing it on my own, but with what I have learned from certified teachers and the reading I have done, I am still able to improve my practice. Of course there is lots of room for improvement.  Yoga has many benefits; physically, increasing flexibility, strength and endurance, mentally and spiritually. I find that my stress decreases when I practice yoga. Right now, I am trying to perfect the crow (Kakasana) pose. Well, actually I am trying to do it properly. I still haven't managed to lift my feet off the ground. But I will keep trying until I do it. This is what yoga is about, continually improving and growing. I certainly have since I began to practice it, I can reach further, I can hold poses longer, I relax better. It's certainly worth the effort.   I would love to start classes again, but it will have to wait.

      Last night we were taken to Cheesecake cafe for supper and I had a lovely Portabella mushroom sandwhich on focaccia for supper with a lovely green salad (and with good lettuce not the ice berg stuff). I was rather pleased with myself. Kim, my mum and my brother Sam had decadent desserts and I wasn't raging to eat any of them :) Even when my mother didn't finish her cheesecake. I am not saying they didn't look wonderfully delicious. They did, of course!  Cheesecake cafe really has wonderful desserts. Unfortunately they don't have any healthy options, or at least not according to the server, though the owner later told my mum that of COURSE they could make a fruit plate :).   Anyway, being a lover of wonderful sweet desserts like that I have overcome that particular hurdle last night.  This morning I measured my waist (not officially, I do that in a couple of weeks) out of curiousity and I lost another inch, woohoo! Total of 7 inches lost on my waist since January. Wow that feels good.   I sure hope I haven't passed on my penchant for rich desserts onto my children. Since they aren't allowed junk food or refined sugar right now hopefully their tastes will develop more healthfully. They do love fruit :) We can hardly keep it in the house.

      I am not going to just post my progress, as that will get old fast, will it not? I also want to write some of my thoughts and opinions on weight, how society relates and PCOS and other areas that I think relate to this.   I want to start with society's views on people who are overweight, particularly women who are overweight.  I have struggled with my body image for many years. I started gaining weight when I was beginning puberty (on hindsight that makes total sense with the whole PCOS issue). Almost immediately, I was encouraged and assisted to lose it and I know that this contributed to how I viewed myself (not a positive thing), because being overweight was " bad ". At least when I was growing up. I did not even get a portion of the negativity some people get. I really did not get negativity from my family, at least not overt negativity from parents or other family members because they were not mean and they loved me. However, I was encouraged to lose weight and over the years was promised new wardrobes when I got slim, so there was still the underlying attitude that I wasn't completely acceptable until I was skinny. Now I do not think this was conscious or intentional, it was just a product of society that infiltrates everyone to a degree. When I was 13 I went to the now defunct Weightloss Clinic and lost weight, I have no idea how much but I lost a lot (how could I not, I was on 750 calories a day). There was a lot of misinformation out in the 70s and 80s (and of course before that) about health and weight and what to do about it. One thing I was very fortunate in was that I knew I was a child of God and even if society did not think I was acceptable, He did. That still did not help how I saw myself physically. Schoolmates and siblings would make fun of me and I had to "ignore" it, not give them the satisfaction of knowing it touched me. Well of  course  it did. But even today it is "ok" to make fun of fat people. It is wrong to ridicule ethnic groups or the mental or physically challenged (not that there aren't people who still do this, but it is socially unacceptable), but society still allows people who are overweight to be ridiculed and laughed at and they are supposed to laugh along with it or they aren't being good sports.  Not everyone of course makes fun of fat people. However, enough do and enough allow it, that the children who struggle with their body image (and yes I know this happens to skinny people too, but not to the degree it does to the fat folks) and concept of what is attractive and what is acceptable. I have been told over the years oh how many times that I "have a pretty face". At first I saw it as a compliment, but it got kind of old, it is what people say to fat people to have something positive to say. Your body isn't pretty, but your face is. When I was growing up, plus-sized people, in particular women, are not considered beautiful. Thank goodness, this archaic thinking is starting to fade. Unfortunately, not fast enough. Children still get dragged through the mud of bullying and ridicule and then people wonder how it gets to the point where a child takes a gun to school? It may seem like a long shot, right; because teasing is something, everyone should endure. Children are supposed to develop "character" as they grow up. True. However, when that character is supposed to come through name-calling and taunting it falls short of its goal. At least now, there is more focus in schools and in family support services on positive reinforcements. However, elementary and high schoolchildren (and even many adults) have somehow skipped this training.   In school, I got it almost on a daily basis, and was told to ignore it. Well my advice is  not  to ignore it because number one it does not work and number two it allows the perpetrator to think what s/he is doing is acceptable. My only redeeming feature that allowed some admiration from my peers was that I could sing and I could sing well. This continued into high school. There were schoolmates who were constantly derisive, making some of the cruelest and nasty comments and I was supposed to continue ignoring it. I did, for the most part, as my self-esteem plummeted and I found some outlets with some friends and in activities such as music and drama and reading. I did not hate myself as much as I could have because I still knew that Heavenly Father loved me and my family loved me. However, I felt that I had no redeeming physically qualities, that I was physically repulsive and the only way to get beyond that was to lose weight. As a teenager, I did not care how I did it. In addition, I knew later that I was not alone and that there are  still  teenagers and pre-teens who feel this way. Their self worth is so wrapped up in how they look because of the media and society pushing what is appropriate (and these new reality and make-over shows just make things worse) that it is difficult to see beyond that. In addition, many do not have the positive reinforcement at home to counteract any of this.   It wasn't until I got out of my teen years and left North American society for several months (I was in Ireland) that I realised that I wasn't as repulsive as I thought and I was on the road to accepting myself in spite of being overweight. I cannot say that I reached a point where I thought I was completely attractive and acceptable being plus size. I got a lot more attention when I was slimmer than I did when I was not. One thing I did come to is that it is more important to love yourself and accept your body then it is to be a certain weight. Sure overweight can cause health problems, but a slim person is not automatically at a lower risk for health problems. An overweight person is not always a lazy good for nothing either. Of course, many factors create ill health. I have met many large sized people who are very healthy (and I count myself in that. I may be 65 lbs or so overweight but I have great endurance, strength and flexibility).   I do not know how on track I am staying, but my real point is that fat people are not less people because they are heavier. Everyone is a child of our Heavenly Father, every person has extreme value, and everyone has beauty and acceptability because of  who  they are. We judge on appearance so often and those that pay the price are the ones who cannot defend themselves, the children who day by day (and trust me this does happen) are being attacked because they do not fit what our society says is beautiful. Then something happens as they grow, they become bitter and angry and lash out or they become withdrawn and so damaged that they cannot lead happy normal lives. Of course, this does not happen to all of them, but unfortunately, it happens to enough. So perhaps it is up to us as adults to change that view. I see more self-image workshops for schools and I am  so  happy they are doing this! More and more this needs to happen. However, maybe part of the focus should be on the bullies. Stop them before they get to the point where they think it is ok to make fun of others. Where do they learn this? Maybe in the home; maybe from TV. They are not born with it.   I tell my children constantly how beautiful they are, and that they are talented, bright, smart, and wonderful. Because they are. They have so much worth and I want it ingrained in them how marvelous and precious they are before someone tries to take this away from them. Because someday someone will. You cannot avoid society. I have doubts that my 5-year-old daughter will deal with the weight problems I have because I do not think she has my body type, and hopefully will not have PCOS. It might be too early to tell though. However, no matter what she will always be beautiful and wonderful and I want her to love herself because she should. All children everywhere deserve to be loved, accepted, and thought beautiful, because you know what? They are. Every single person, every single child is beautiful on the outside and the inside. Heavenly Father does not make garbage.  Now saying all of this I am not saying it is bad to lose weight. It is bad for the wrong reasons because it will not be permanent. I am losing weight now for two particular reasons. With my PCOS I am at higher risk for diabetes and heart problems and being overweight will contribute to this significantly, and being overweight to a certain point, I cannot get pregnant. Therefore, these are the two reasons I am losing weight. Yes, I want to be slim for other reasons, but those are secondary to my real reasons and more of a "bonus". If this makes sense. :)

      At my gym (and probably most, if not all gyms) they have TVs (muted) for your viewing enjoyment. We have 3 TVs that face the cardio equiptment and though I don't pay a lot of attention to what they show, usually, this morning a couple of shows caught my eye (on at the same time on different TVs). On the one, there was a news item showing a father and son who compete together (literally) in triathlons and Marathons. To date they have completed 965 races. There is something unique about them though, the son (a grown man of 42) was born a spastic quadripilegic, non speaking and is not mobile and was born with cerebral palsy. His father carries or pushes him through it all. As I was watching this I began to contemplate some of the other challenges that many face and overcome. It is incredible what so many people do, overcoming insurmountable challenges. My struggles with PCOS are so minimal in comparison. It was so inspiring to see them. If you want to read more about them they are known as  urlLink Team Hoyt  click the underlined text.   Another show was a documentary (I believe, maybe it was news item as well), showing people suffering from physical deformities in a third world area (not sure where, I caught the middle of it). There was one woman in particular I saw who had club feet and only 2-3 toes per foot, as well as deformed and clubbed hands with only a few short fingers on each. I immediatly felt very humbled and grateful for my blessings. I think of the times I complain about my own problems and realise that I really have no right to complain. I have two hands and two feet that are healthy and able to accomplish so much. I don't have to overcome some incredible physical challenge to achieve my goals. I am so blessed to not only live in a place where I can do anything I set my mind to, but I am blessed with the physical health to do it. What more can I ask for? I just hope I can remember these people when I feel the urge to complain about my minimal worries and struggles. They truly are nothing compared to what so many have to overcome on a daily basis. Rick Hoyt didn't let his physical challenges stop him from graduating university or from entering into intense races on a regular basis. His father could likely run, swim, bike and move much faster if he didn't have the extra weight of his son, but this is something they do together, something they accomplish together and he does it with him. This woman with her clubbed feet and hands doesn't let it stop her from living her life, from smiling and approaching life matter-of-factly. These physical problems aren't something they can just pretend doesn't exist, they are something that will not disappear in this life.  I know there are people who ask why God allows some folks to suffer so severely. To be born with these challenges that seem insurmountable. But I think the reason is clear. They show us the power of the spirit and how blessed we are. It also shows me anyway, how honoured I am to share the same world with these individuals.   When we have problems that seem unfair and cruel, and see those who have more severe challenges and how they overcome them, is this not inspirational? It is to me. I have nothing to complain about. PCOS is a challenge, sure. But it is a manageable challenge and I can still do so much more. I am able bodied, I can do so much. I have no right to complain. Ever.

      From Saskatchewan where we camped near Regina with Kim's parents and sister and family for a week. It was really enjoyable. Especially spending time with family. We got to visit with Kim's dad's family too, and that was nice as well.   I got in runs Monday to Friday and did strength training 4 days and yoga 3 days (should have done more, but there wasn't much grass to work with in our campsite). My eating was pretty good too. I let myself have half an ice cream from Milky Way, a wonderful place that makes their own ice cream. I gave Kim the rest of it. My water wasn't as much as I usually drink, but I tried the best I could. This was mainly because of the outhouse, lol. So I cut off my water drinking as early as I could.   It's been a good week in spite of the change in routine! We got home last night and I was wiped. I wasn't going to do anything this evening (exercise-wise) but did 20 minutes on Level 9 on a bike at the gym. Not a huge workout, but got my energy up which was needed!

      Ok, for Friday 16 July 2004 I have lost another 12 pounds making a total of 75 lbs lost since the start of January, a loss of 8.75 inches in the last 4 (just about) weeks for a total of 51.25 inches lost since the start of the year and I am pretty much a size 16! Woohoo!! Well just about anyway. My measurements are maybe an inch all around away from it. Next goal, size 14.    It's happening :)     September 2003

      I will be posting my latest results. One bit of good news (well for me anyway) when I was running on the treadmill this morning I was able to up the speed to 6.0 for a good minute :) Ok, may not seem like much but it makes ME happy! lol

      Well I know it isn't official day, but I am down 72 lbs total. I'm averaging about 3 lbs a week, which isn't too shabby. Yes I know it will slow down, but hopefully when I am only about 10 lbs from my goal :).

      One of the most important aspects of a good workout is to weight train, especially as one gets older. It is reported that this is the most forgotten part of most women's exercise regimes.   I love weight training. I began about 11 years ago (after trying it once in a blue moon as a teenager and pre-teen) without weights. I used Tony Little's programs as suggested by a room-mate at the time. I really enjoyed the changes it made in my muscle strength and how it helped with weight loss even without actual weights.  I continued weight lifting with some light weights after we were married, for a few months, but got out of the habit and didn't pick it up again until a few years ago. I still continued using light weights but I found it wasn't making any difference for me, or at least not much to be noticeable, so I was glad to start at the gym this past January where I would have access to heavier weights and weight machines. Now I see the difference it is making and I am really pleased! My strength and shape are really improving, I have more defined muscles and I know it is helping increase my metabolism. It also feels literally wonderful! I know it helps increase my energy and improve my cardio workout as well.  There are some common myths about weight training for women and the main one is that it will increase bulk so much that she will look like a female bodybuilder. This doesn't happen! Or at least, it won't happen without some incredible time and effort and extreme weights.   There are many benefits that weightlifting can provide women (or anyone for that matter) and these are; keeps weight off, strengthen immune system, decreases body fat, benefits certain types of arthritis, decreases osteoporosis risk by increasing bone density, increases strength and endurance, increases energy, gives you a nicer body shape (sculpts your body), makes you less prone to low-back injuries, decreases your resting blood pressure, decreases your risk of developing adult onset diabetes, decreases your gastrointestinal transit time thus reducing your risk for developing colon cancer, increases your blood level of HDL cholesterol (the good type),improves your posture, lowers your resting heart rate which is a sign of a more efficient heart, improves your balance and coordination and elevates your mood.  Frankly I can't see any negatives to it! It doesn't have to be a difficult process either. You can start out with 1 lb weights and I believe you can even get half lb weights. You can adapt your workout to fit almost any body type or physical challenge. When Tony Little first started his no weight strength training program it was because he couldn't do actual weight bearing exercise due to the fact he had been in a severe car accident and was in a wheelchair for a significant period of time. So you can even start without weights by making the movements and tensing the muscles. Weight can be added as time goes on. Exercise balls are a wonderful addition to strength training as well and I am learning to make good use of them. I used to shy away from them, but I love them now! They are great for all sorts of strength and balance training, and wonderfully beneficial for the all important core training.   So it's a part of exercise I HIGHLY recommend! Have a wonderfully active day!

      Well I am supposed to do my stats this Sunday but you will all have to wait for a few days, probably Wednesday. Don't worry, I still plan on updating. I will be at the end of my second set of 12 weeks! Wow, I can't believe I am through it twice already. One more set to go!  Anyway, on a sort of unrelated but not really unrelated topic, we start school in less than 2 weeks (30 Aug). Sinéad is beginning Grade 1. And Regan is "beginning" preschool. Not officially but he doesn't want to be left out so we are "starting school" for him too. We are homeschooling and I have been planning and scheduling and we are going to be BUSY. With my workouts and school and field trips and housework and playtime and laundry and just everything we are going to be one hectic household. But in a way I am looking forward to it because I am way more organised and under control when I have a ton of stuff to do! We are planning it week by week because...well, life happens! I still have time for morning gym visits then we do school in the afternoon. I will have to wake up early though to get my housework done. But that's ok! I am excited to start homeschooling and so is Miss Sinéad. She wishes we were starting TODAY! Grandma bought her a Barbie lunchbox even though she won't really need it to GO to school but it will sure come in handy for field trips and picnic lunches. Regan even got a Spiderman lunchbox. Ah, the joys of childhood.Don't ask me why they are so infatuated with Spiderman or Barbie. It honestly just happened. I used to say that my daughter/s wouldn't be Barbie fanatics because of the whole Barbie image, but Sinéad over-ruled me and so it happened. We don't go overboard though, lol. Sinéad starts ballet again a couple of weeks into September (her 3rd year) and we have to buy new ballet shoes again! Her feet just keep a-growing. Anyway, I know this seems unrelated to my odyssey, but it is related too, because well, just because. :)

      I am getting enough protein. I just have to keep an eye on it. It isn't easy being vegetarian and trying to make sure fat intake stays moderate, lol.  Oh I am down a few  more pounds (it is slowing down, but at least not stopping completely!) I am 83 lbs lost from January. 33 to go!!!!!!

      Want a way to track your progress, everything from the nutrients you are (or aren't) getting, the calories you burn through exercise, the calories you consume? Go to  urlLink FitDay.com  and sign up for free! I began using it a year ago and then stopped for several months. Recently I am back using it because I wanted to get more of an idea of what I consume (I don't count calories as a general rule) and if I am getting relatively balanced nutrition. I am. And my calorie consumption is between 1500 and 1800 a day which is right for me (any less and I can feel it). Again, I don't believe strict obedience to calories is the key, but it can help see WHERE your nutrition is coming from. What I need to improve is my protein consumption. I am not getting enough.  Anyway, FitDay's a handy tool, so check it out!

      On "level 10" (for me) I am running at a speed of 6.2. It's only for one minute, but it isn't killing me. If you had asked me back in January if I would be running straight for almost 30 minutes and that I would be running at THAT speed I would have laughed. NO way! But I AM doing it. I am living proof that you can do ANYTHING YOU SET YOUR MIND TO! It's true. I fully believe, no I KNOW, that I will be running marathons one day and I look forward to it. Anyone can do ANYTHING they want! Set a goal and do it! You will!

      I attended a funeral today for someone I did not know long, but who had a profound effect on my life.  Ron MacDonald passed away last week at the age of 49 and just a few short weeks away from celebrating his twentieth wedding anniversary. I teach his youngest boy in a youth class at church.  Nine months ago, Ron was diagnosed with tongue cancer. He was the most resilient, courageous, encouraging individual I know. He was always friendly and made everyone feel special. In the last few months, knowing what he was going through and yet seeing his willingness and optimism to get through it all has been a great source of renewed strength for me.  I would be naïve to think that out of hundreds of people attending his funeral today, that my visit would have made any difference to him. The thing is though it sure made a difference to me. Never have I been affected by someone's passing since my maternal grandfather died thirteen years ago.  Ron will be sorely missed.

      Well, I've decided to take advantage of being an employee of the U of L and go back to school. I completed a diploma in multimedia production back in 2001, but now I am going for a bachelor's in new media. I should be done in 2006. When it is completed, I may even go for graduate studies depending on how the tuition benefits programme works.  To top it off, I will still be working full-time as well. We'll see how hectic that will be.

      I had my first real drama performance today where I interacted with other actors. Up until today, my only experience was some one-liners when I was a teenager and a 10 minute monologue back in 1997.  For our drama performance, six of us had to develop our own script that included three settings and involve a quest of some sort. Our quest was a mother is missing some money from her purse and she and her husband accuse each of their children in their pursuit of finding who took it. I played the father.  Mary and I also went to see a play called  Proof . It’s an award-winning play that appeared on Broadway about a depressed daughter of an unstable mathematical genius father. Lynley Engh did an absolutely emotional and engaging performance in portraying the daughter.  Despite director Jessie Van Rijn’s claim that the play was wholesome, I was bothered by its liberal use of the “F” word and other somewhat milder, but equally striking, expletives. Firstly, I was bothered because I find such offensive, particularly in excessive usage. Secondly, I find the use of them to be a sign of a bad actor/playwright. In my opinion, it seems like a lazy way out to use swear words for emphasis. A good actor would be able to portray the right emphasis/emotion independent of the words used.  Anyhow, these two experiences—my performance and watching  Proof —made me realise how much I may have missed by not being able to take drama in high school. Now I am contemplating switching from a new media major to a drama major. Since I won’t be getting anything practical and useful out of my current programme, why not switch to one that will at least be enjoyable?  We’ll see.

      Quite often, I hear people refer to Stanley Park in downtown Vancouver, BC, Canada, as being the largest urban park in Canada or the largest urban park in North America. I have no idea where this myth originated, but wherever it did, Vancouverites ran with it. Unfortunately, it's incorrect. In fact, it's very much so.  Below are the largest urban parks of North America that I could find that are more than 1000 acres in size.   South Mountain Preserve (Phoenix AZ) - 16,283   Rouge Valley Park (Markham ON) - 11,600   Jamaica Bay National Wildlife Refuge (New York City NY) 9,000   Fairmount Park (Philadelphia PA) - 8,900   Forest Park (Portland OR) - 5,090   Mission Bay Park (San Diego CA) 4,235   Griffith Park (Los Angeles CA) 4,107   Fish Creek Provincial Park (Calgary AB) - 3,318   Wascana Park (Regina SK) - 2,325   Chapultepec Park (Mexico City) - 2,100   Rock Creek Park (Washington, DC) 1,754   City Park (New Orleans LA) - 1,500   Presidio (San Francisco CA) 1,480   Canyon Lakes Project (Lubbock TX) - 1,450   Forest Park (St. Louis MO) - 1,370   Bays Mountain Park (Kingsport TN) - 1,300   Lincoln Park (Chicago IL) 1,208   Great Kills (New York City NY) - 1,200   Balboa Park (San Diego CA) 1,158   Cortlandt Park (New York City NY) 1,146   Golden Gate Park (San Francisco CA) 1,013   Stanley Park (Vancouver BC) - 1,000   As you can see, not only does Stanley Park not even come close to being the largest urban park in North America, it's the last on the list. It's not even the largest urban park in Canada. It's not even the largest urban park in western Canada. But to the optimistic LotusLand lover, it's likely to be the largest urban park in BC.

      Well, it been a month since school started and I must say that as a 30 year old, the experience is much different than it was as a 24 year old. I especially feel it in my new media class where, in some cases, I know more than my instructor does.  One element of the New Media programme at the U of L that really bugs me (and this may even be reflective of practices at other post-secondary institutions) is the liberal education requirements. I understand the argument behind it and wholeheartedly agree that it applies in many cases. However, I have to wonder how applicable it is to a 30-year-old new media artist with nearly seven years of industry experience. I have to wonder how applicable it is to a person who has been married for 8.5 years, has two children, and has held various leadership positions in church and in four community organisations.  The whole purpose behind it is to offer the student a well-rounded education that will turn them into critically-thinking, objective, open-minded individuals. Honestly, if I haven't learned all that by now, I'm certainly not going to learn it in school. But what can I do? Just grin and bear it.  On the plus side, at least now I can take the drama classes I missed in high school.

      When I started my education at the U of L in 1998, I really wasn't sure what I wanted to do. In fact, I just ended up taking random courses. A semester into my studies I found out that your supposed to register in a Faculty and have a major. So I opted for a major in French and was admitted to the Faculty of Arts & Sciences. A semester later, I decided I wasn't going to be able to do anything with a B.A. in French, so opted for a combined B.A./B.Ed. in hopes that I could be a teacher.  It turns out that I had to quit university for financial reasons and it wasn't until this past September that I decided to go back. After all, I was no  employed at the U of L , so they would pay for it. I decided that I should pick a new media B.F.A. degree and registered in the Faculty of Fine Arts.  For anyone who's following along in this whole saga&mdash;and I'm sure it's actually no one since my life is boring relative to societal standards&mdash;the new media degree has not been going too well and given its generic, elementary nature and my seven years experience in new media, I found it to be awfully boring, frustrating and impractical.  Well, today, I met with my advisor and I am going to enroll in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences again, but instead of a B.A. in French, I'll be working on a B.A. in Drama. What this means is that every single course I took at Douglas College in BC and here at the U of L will transfer to my B.A.. This is exciting because about half of them transfer over to my previous B.F.A. degree. I'll also be able to take par in an education that is fun. It's still impractical&mdash;unless I'm miraculously made into a highly-paid actor&mdash;but at least it'll be fun.

      We took the Scouts scuba diving tonight. Lethbridge isn't really known for its scuba diving spots since it's in the middle of a semi-arid prairie. As such, the only place to go scuba diving is the Olympic-sized swimming pool at the University of Lethbridge's Max Bell Aquatic Centre.   It really wasn't much—mostly 30 minutes of lesson and 30 minutes of playing—but it was still fun. Not only had it been the first time each of the boys had been scuba diving, but it was a first time all of the leaders had been scuba diving. While I enjoyed it, I'm glad I don't do it for a living. I suppose one could get used to it, but I had a sore nose and sore ears afterward.

      Our drama instructor gave out our midterm grades today. They were only for classroom participation and did not include our test, the quizzes or last week's performances. Anyhow, I received an A-. Pretty good for no previous training and virtually no previous experience. :-)  I also had the chance this past Wednesday to talk with my drama instructor about auditioning for a play next semester. He felt I had a good stage presence and fit well in my roles and encouraged me to tryout. He gave me some monologue books today and once I've picked one, he offered to help me perfect it.  I also talked to my boss, my new media instructor and three new media professionals. They all told me that the degree didn't matter—my boss said that he would put more emphasis on having a degree than what the major was for the degree and the others said that they place more emphasis on portfolio work. I meet with an advisor next week, so I'll decided then; however, I'm certain that I'll pick drama over new media for my major.

      We're off to Vancouver tomorrow for the holidays and we will be staying for two weeks. Last time we went to Vancouver, we spent 31 hours driving there and back, so we're flying this time around. Our children are excited because it will be their first time on a plane. While we're there we will take a ride or two on the SkyTrain and the SeaBus because we want to show the children what a big city downtown looks like and because they've never been on a train or a boat. They're really excited.

      I've decided to audition for a performance in March. The play is called  The Laramie Project  and is based on the  urlLink Matthew Shepard  story. I've only been in one play before and didn't have to audition for the part. I just showed up to a rehearsal and they gave me a part.  The director has asked that auditions be from documentary pieces. My mentor,  urlLink Doug MacArthur , has suggested I use a piece from  The Deputy  by Rolf Hochhuth. I've decided to do a piece from Act 1 Scene 1 where Kurt Gerstein is trying to convince The Apostolic Nuncio in Berlin of the atrocities being poured upon the WWII Jews by the Nazis. It's shortly after he burst into the Nuncio's office.  If I am cast, I can get full credit for Drama 3600.  The auditions are at the beginning of next month. I'm not sure what to expect, so we'll see how it goes.

      Well, today was the last day of classes for the Fall 2003 semester. Wouldn't you know it—I had to spend the last day of classes in my music class taking a final exam. The up side to that was that I was out early.   For whatever reason, I seem to be one of the first ones finished my exams than others in my class. Perhaps it's because I don't second guess myself and stress over the answers. It certainly couldn't be my overzealous studying. After all, I'd actually have to be overly zealous in my studying for that to be the case.  Whatever. I'm glad it's all over. While I am glad the university was paying for it, I still view the course as a waste of money. I have taken a personal oath to never sign up for another music class again.  Well, maybe The History of Rock and Roll.

      I was talking with Doug MacArthur today and he said that Ches Skinner, the director for  The Laramie Project , told him I had done a very good job with my monologue. It gave me a lot of confidence knowing that he felt a good job. I am confident now that considering the content of the play and my religious background, the reason I did not make the cast was because there would have been no part for me.

      I just found out that there is a Grade 11 student at Westside High School in Omaha, Nebraska, who decided to nominate himself as a recipient of the school's "Distinguished African American Student Award". It turns out that not only was he denied access to the award, but he was suspended from school for two days. The young man is white and the award, according to the school, is for black students. But here's the real kicker—he's from Africa. Actually, he's from South Africa.  If we interpreted the name of the award literally, then so long as the young man considers himself to be American, it would seem he qualifies for the award on that merit alone. In fact, it quite likely he is more "African" than any other recipient in the last eight years.  This now leads me to wonder, what exactly does the term "African American" mean? Does it mean an American with ancestry from Africa? Or does it mean someone who's black? What if the black person's ancestors immigrated (or were exported, as the case may be) to Brazil or the Caribbean or even England first, lived there for a few generations and then moved to the United States. Would the term still apply to them or would they be more aptly referred to as "Brazilian American" or "Jamaican American" or "English American"? Personally, I think the whole thing is ridiculous, and here's why.  First of all, it's a term based on colour. Someone from Egypt or Libya isn't referred to as African American unless he or she is black. Though we do have a similar term in "Asian American", it doesn't refer to people from Russia, India or Armenia. Even so, it doesn't even refer to white persons who live in places such as Hong Kong. A term like "European American" or "Australian American" would likely be met with cynicism, so why make exceptions?  Secondly, how long would a person living in the United States be "entitled" to use such a term? In other words, how long will it be until they are just an "American"? I mean, if I was apply this politically correct logic, I'd have to use something like "French—Spanish—German—Dutch—English—Scottish—Czech—Cree-Canadian". Absurd.  Lastly, why have an award that segregates? Why can the award simply be the "Distinguished Student Award"? As long as the school is going to racially favour students, then so will other students. Make all the students equal.  Don't get me wrong. I’m all for using politically correct terms that help to avoid segregation. It's just that in this case, it seems to do the opposite.

      Well, I didn't make the callback list. Initially, I was disappointed, but after some reflection, I'm now somewhat relieved. It means I won't be excruciatingly busy this semester, and it also means I have another semester to gain more acting skills, more experience and hone my talent more.  There's always next season.

      Well, it was my first audition ever tonight. I was really nervous. I've been practising for about a month and a half, and the last couple of days while rehearsing my monologue, I kept forgetting my lines. I was worried that I was going to forget them in the audition too.  I was the third person to audition tonight, and tonight was the first night of auditions. The director, Ches Skinner, had me sit on a chair and he asked me some questions to get to know me a little. Then he asked me to tell him a story and I told him about our experience in Vancouver. Then he asked me to do my monologue.  The play for which I auditioned is called “The Laramie Project” and it was developed by a theatre troupe in New York City. They went to Laramie, Wyoming, to interview residents about their reactions regarding the death of Matthew Sheppard. They then compiled the quotes into this performance. Ches wanted us to choose documentary type monologues.  The monologue I chose is from The Deputy by Rolf Hochhuth. It’s a play about the Catholic Church’s role in Nazi Germany. The piece I did was when one of the main characters, SS officer Kurt Gerstein, is trying to convince Papal Nuncio Count Césare Orsenigo of the atrocities happening in concentration camps, particularly Belzec, and for the Catholic Church to intervene.  I think it went well, but I don’t know how well I did when compared to everyone else who auditioned. The last night for auditions is Thursday, so we should be hearing Sunday or Monday who will be wanted for “callbacks” This will then allow the director to see how well his prospective actors work with each other.  I think I’m more nervous now than I was in my audition.

      Well, our first-born child—our daughter Sinéad—is now five years old. It seems odd to think it's been five years since she was born; five years since I caught her as she emerged into the world. She's lived in every house we've had in Lethbridge.  She sure has grown over the years. She's not the tallest girl—or child for that matter—on the block, but she's pretty smart. She can count to nearly any number in English (or at least to 1000) and she can count to ten in French and Spanish. She is starting to read. She can write all the letters of the alphabet and can even write words and small sentences. She is fairly adept on the computer and even IMs me ever so often while I am at work. She can hold a conversation and is quite accurate in her articulation of words and letters. She's very imaginative and comes up with all sort of stories and play scenarios.  I sure am looking forward to the next five years.

      I’m back in school. Things seem to be going well. For two of my three classes, I didn’t even have to buy textbooks and in the third class, the textbooks come to less than 50 bucks.  It’s always hard to gauge the semester just by the first day since most instructors simply review their course outline, but I think I’ll enjoy it.  My History & Development of Theatre class has four people from last semester’s drama class; my Fundamentals class has three and my Play Reading and Analysis has three. It’s nice not having all the apathetic, non-drama majors in my classes, but it’d be nice to see more people from last semester’s drama class.  The audition for  The Laramie Project  is next week. I’ll probably end up going tot the Tuesday audition. I’ve heard that only five people will be cast to play forty characters. I’m somewhat nervous because I’ve never done an audition before and I don’t know hoe poor or good my monologue will be when compared to the other auditionees. My mentor, Doug Macarthur also can’t meet with me before Tues evening, so I am on my own. I’ve been practising lots and we’ve met together before. I just hope I will do well.  Here we go.

      The trip to Vancouver was nice. The children were able to see all of their cousins and enjoyed playing with some of them nearly every one of the twelve days we were there. We also took them on the SkyTrain and the SeaBus and took them on a quick tour of Granville Street downtown and Pacific Centre this past Monday. They really enjoyed it. They installed a second SkyTrain line since we lived there and we went on it to get back home Monday. It’s hard to believe Brentwood Mall and Lougheed all have SkyTrain Stations now. Surrey Place Mall has been radically changed—it doesn’t even look the same anymore. There’s a new office tower and the exterior and interior have been completely remodelled. It looks cool, especially when the reflection of the SkyTrain shows in the glass exterior.  The day we arrived was a bit uncomfortable. There were twelve people in the van during our 45 minute ride from the airport to Surrey. It was hot in there and the humidity made it difficult to breathe easily. My parents had their thermostat at 28° that first night, so that didn’t help any either. That whole night I felt I was suffocating. I got used to it over the next day and was fine until I came home. The dry weather in Alberta the day we got back gave me a bloody nose. My nose doesn’t like the dry weather.  Anyhow, that wasn’t the hassle referred to in my title. The hassle was the stress of our trip back home. We were supposed to board our WestJet flight at 11:15 PST and arrive at 13:45 MST. At about twenty after eleven, they announced that as a result of the snowstorm (read 2-5 cm of snow) the night before and that was continuing yesterday depleted their de-icer supplies and our flight had been cancelled.  We were then instructed to travel back to the other end of the airport and pick up our ten pieces of luggage. We did this and put them on three baggage carts. Luckily, each cart had a basket where our children could sit, so we didn’t have to drag them behind us.  Then the two of us had to take the three carts down a switchback ramp to the arrivals level. That was a real hassle, but luckily a kind woman offered to push one of the carts. Once we arrived at the lower level, our luggage was loaded onto a charter bus. We were then bussed 1.5 hours to the Abbotsford airport where an alternate flight was suppose to leave at 14:00. The bus pulled in at 13:55. Luckily for us, the plane was waiting for a second bus, so we had time to grab something to eat.  We then had to load our ten pieces of  luggage from the bus back on to three baggage carts. The Abbotsford carts, unfortunately, did not have baskets in which our children could sit, so the two of us were pushing/pulling three carts and dragging two children. We had to check in all our baggage again and we finally boarded the plane at close to 15:00.  We arrived in Calgary around 17:30 MST, and after we filled our truck up with gas, we were back on the highway home around 18:15.  Originally, we planned to grab some groceries when we arrived in Lethbridge since we had eaten all our perishable food before we left. But since we arrived in Lethbridge at 20:30 and it was New Year’s Eve, none of the supermarkets were open. We ended up spending 35$ on two bags of groceries at Green’s Pop Shop.  I was just glad to get home.

      Well, I was contacted for three callbacks. Two were for this afternoon and one is for Monday morning. I guess someone thinks I'm doing a pretty good job, or maybe there just weren't enough auditionees. ;-) Interestingly enough, the third callback director when she phoned me said, "I suppose you've already had a few callbacks".  I wasn't sure if that meant that she thought I was good enough to get a few callbacks or if she says it to everyone.  I've never had a callback before so I wasn't sure quite to expect, but it was a worthwhile experience nonetheless. Anyhow, we'll see if it goes any further than this.

      I auditioned for nine performances today. It's not as intensive as it sounds. There were three groups of three directors and we only had to perform the same piece in all three groups. It was quite the experience. It's part of the semi-annual directing projects put on my drama students who are interested in directing. I'm not sure how well I did since I had virtually no practise, so I'm not sure if I'll get any callbacks. I suppose we'll see. It was a good experience even if I don't make it.

      We took the Scouts camping this weekend. We left Thursday for Camp Impessa, which is a Scout Camp located east of Pincher Creek. It's been awhile since I've been winter camping, and it was nice to have somewhat mild weather. Most of the time at Camp Impessa was spent in classes preparing the boys in what was needed for proper winter camping skills. We arrived home late this afternoon.  I enjoy camping, but my arthritis makes it difficult to enjoy Scout camping, what with all the hiking and whatnot. I could camp forever like Mary and I did on our honeymoon. Just sit around the fire cooking and visiting. That'd be the life. We're going to buy a new tent for when we go out to Regina this summer. There will be a family reunion there and we will be camping. Hopefully we can go camping as a family once or twice before then as well.

      Brian Parkinson, the instructor for my Fundamentals of acting class, asked us a few weeks ago to pick a monologue and then gave us the past few weeks to work on them. He gave us three or four times to present them to the class and then last Tuesday (03 Feb), he had us present and graded us for it.  I picked Daniel Libmann's  Cecil and Cleopaytra . It's about a retired acting coach whose day nurse shows natural acting talent. He get frustrated at seeing her "wast away" her talent and ends up giving her an ultimatum to choose to stay and work with him or to leave. The monologue I did was that ultimatum.  Anyhow, we received our marks today and I received an A-. We were graded on various items and  received 8.5 out of 10 marks on Articulation/Diction, Extremities, Motivated Movement, and Pacing. all the other points I was given a mark of 9 out of 10. This really pleased me because it gives me the confidence that I am on the right track. I've always felt that I had acting talent and this goes to show it. I'm glad I'm taking these classes because they help me refine the raw talent I was given.  Now we're working on two-person scenes. I'm paired up with Adrienne Snelling and she seems to be a good actor. We are struggling with picking a setting and character development, but I don't doubt we'll come up with something good. We did an exercise last Thursday together, and I think it went well.

      We went to the temple yesterday to finish our last collection of initiatories. Yay! What an experience that was, and now we can focus on the endowments and sealings.  While we driving through Cardston, I saw a sign on someone’s house that attempted to say who lived there. I do not remember the last name, but let us just use Leavitt. That is a good LDS name.  Naturally, when one wants to say there is more than one Leavitt, one would pluralise “Leavitt”, which would give you “Leavitts”. However, this sign I saw actually said “Leavitt’s”. Now depending on the intent of the message the sign was to present, it may be grammatically correct. Such a label would in effect mean that the house belonged to one Leavitt.  However, since this phenomenon seems to be widespread and I have “debated” this issue on more than one occasion, I can only assume that the intent of the sign was to say that Leavitts—more than one—live in this house.  Why is it that people simply cannot use basic grammar when they are displaying their language skills to the world? What really gets me is that not only do the owners of the sign participate in this linguistic debauchery, but so do the sign designers and makers.  Sigh. Just another one of my pet peeves.

      Erin Anderssen wrote in  urlLink The Globe and Mail  yesterday: An estimated one in four children show up on that first day of school, short on the basic tools they need to succeed, from simple language to fine motor skills to co-operating with classmates. The article then goes on to allude that this is often the fault of the upbringing and environment of the children. Naturally, it is so easy to put blame on the parents for not providing a challenging and sensory experience for their children’s preschool years. It is easy to blame the parents for neglecting or abusing their children. It is easy to blame the parents for being lazy and uncaring.  What is never just as easy is to question the public education systems’ (and some private systems) premise that somehow grouping children by age is the best course to determine developmental progress. This, of course, is ludicrous given that children develop at different rates. Grouping them by age naturally creates developmental problems that wouldn’t exist if children were grouped by developmental rates.  What is also equally ludicrous is that after graduation from high school, individuals are virtually never grouped by age again in the real world. School is a make-believe reality that has no resemblance of actual reality.  It is no wonder that so many parents opt to homeschool their children.

      Just when one is grateful that Conference will be free of protestors accosting attendees, the protesters decide there’s no reason to acknowledge buffer zones set up by the city.  It’s sad really, that we are not able to attend our own meetings without harassment. Having  The Laramie Project  still fresh in my mind, I am led to reflect on the protesting that took outside of Matthew Shepard’s funeral.  Freedom of speech is important, but so is freedom to worship.  "We're prepared to go to jail if we have to," street preacher Lonnie Pursifull said.  That sums it up.

      In Gospel Doctrine class today, we discussed the first four chapters of the book of Jacob. Naturally, much of the discussion was focused on abuse and polygamy. Of course, it wasn’t much of an insightful lesson; we simply touched on surface issues.  One comment the teacher made, however, made me think. She said something along the lines of, “We know that not all sexual abuse is done by the husbands. Unfortunately.”  Would she also have said “Unfortunately” if all sexual abuse was done by just the husbands? Why is it unfortunate that wives do it too? From my point of view, the existence of sexual abuse is unfortunate, regardless of the gender of the perpetrator.  Of course, I have been known to use an abnormal logic when interpreting others’ comments, so perhaps this may have been one of those times. Nevertheless…

      We saw  The Laramie Project  last night. It was rather thought provoking. Naturally, it made me, as an audience member, more regretful of and disgusted with all that happened to Matthew Shepard. However, it also made me think more of Russell Henderson and Aaron McKinney.  The doctor that treated Matthew Shepard when he was brought in had also treated Aaron McKinney for some minor injuries. He is reported to having said something I found interesting. He said something along the lines of how he wondered if perhaps God feels like he did; how we’re all children in His eyes and He feels compassion for all of us.  In a circumstance like this, in which a victim is so badly and grotesquely beaten, it is so easy to revere him and be filled with contempt and hatred for the perpetrators. At the same time, does God feel that way? Does he feel compassion for one of his children and hatred for another? Or does He feel love for each? Does he feel compassion for the one because of how he was beaten and left for dead and for the other because of how his actions were beyond anything He’d want his children to inflict on each other?  This play really helped me to think more about God’s love and how perfect it is. Granted, He likely feels disappointment at His children who commit such crimes. On the other hand, this disappointment, I believe, never changes the amount of love He has for them. When one of my children hits the other, I naturally am disappointed in their actions, but I never reduce the amount of love I have for that child. Why would Our Father be any different?  I won’t even touch the logic the judge used in sentencing both Henderson and McKinney with the same sentence, despite their actions being completely different. That’s for another time.

      I came across  urlLink this website  today that sells God Detectors. The premise is that they are more reliable to providing answers to prayers than a phone ringing, feather falling or a water stain appearing. Simply pray and watch the detector to see if it ever changes to “Yes”.  I suppose this means the Holy Spirit is no longer sufficient and reliable in providing us with answer; no longer a  urlLink comforter or teacher ,  urlLink record bearer ,  urlLink truth guider , or  urlLink mystery unfolder .  Pity. I was really enjoying his companionship.

      Jeremy at  urlLink Orson’s Telescope  recently posted regarding an epiphany he had will reading the Life of Pi. In particular, he gave the following quote:   There are always those who take it upon themselves to defend God, as if the Ultimate Reality, as if the sustaining frame of existence, were something weak and helpless. These people walk by a widow deformed by leprosy begging for a few paise, walk by children dressed in rags living in the street, and they think, 'Business as usual.' But if they perceive a slight against God, it is a different story. Their faces go red, their chests heave mightily, they sputter angry words. The degree of their indignation is astonishing. Their resolve is frightening.  These people fail to realize that it is on the inside that God must be defended, not on the outside. They should direct their anger at themselves. For evil in the open is but evil from within that has been let out. The main battlefield for good is not the open ground of the public arena but the small clearing of each heart. Meanwhile, the lot of widows and homeless children is very hard, and it is to their defence, not God's, that the self-righteous should rush. It made me ponder on how many religious people lead their lives, particularly Christians. I’m not prejudiced toward Christians—I am one myself—but I live in Canada’s Bible Belt, so I am a little biased in my religious experience.  Why do so many Christians fight (verbally or otherwise) other Christians or believers of other faiths? Why do so many Christians tear down other faiths? Why are so many Christians abusive (verbally or otherwise) to those who do not “obey the commandments”? Why do so many Christians attack abortionists or homosexuals, but do nothing to Sabbath-breakers or coveters? Why do so many Christians pay lip service to God and Jesus through their praises, but do little else to live a God-like or Christian life? Why do so many Christians study the Bible, but do very little to apply its teachings?  It all reminds me of something Nephi said in  urlLink 2 Nephi 31 .   …the voice of the Son came unto me, saying: He that is baptized in my name, to him will the Father give the Holy Ghost, like unto me; wherefore,  follow me, and do the things which ye have seen me do . (v 12)  … Follow thou me . Wherefore, my beloved brethren, can we follow Jesus save we shall  be willing  to keep the commandments of the Father? (v. 10) How often do we focus on “keeping the commandments of the Father”, but forget about doing it “willingly”? Do we keep the Sabbath holy because a prophet has told us to, or because it is our will? Do we avoid sexual transgressions because w fear pregnancy or STDs or because it is our will? Do we help our neighbours because the Elders Quorum organised a service project or because it is our will? Do we get baptised because our friends were baptised or because it is our will? Do we partake of the Sacrament because others around us do or because it is our will? Do we read our scriptures because we feel guilty if we don’t or because it is our will?  I wonder what the world would be like if everyone who commits moral acts did so because it is their uttermost inner desire to do so.

      The AP reported that a porn film director in Los Angeles, CA, USA, issued a warning for parents to ensure their children do not watch the videos he produces.  Call me crazy, but there seems something awfully odd about someone making something and then offering a warning on it. It reminds me of alcohol producers who annually issue a “Don’t Drink and Drive” message during the holiday season.  If you really want to prevent children from watching porn, don’t produce it. Produce it, and children will view it. Simple as that.

      Or is it?  On an LDS message board, someone mentioned that a CNN story on TV yesterday saw a woman interviewed regarding same gender marriages. I didn't see the story, but I understand that she made the conclusion that if same gender marriages were allowed, polygamy would be next. Apparently, she also made the allusion that polygamy, was a religious belief of our church.  The message board thread then went on to ask if anyone thought the Church would reinstate polygamy and reinstate D&C 132.  First of all, why is it that everyone always thinks of  urlLink D&C 132  as the “polygamy chapter” in the Doctrine and Covenants? Outside of the last  urlLink 7-8 verses , the chapter doesn’t even specifically mention plural marriage. In fact, 86% of the chapter speaks of other marriage related topics, such as the sealing power and celestial marriage.  Secondly, I honestly don’t see any reason why the Church would reinstate the practice of plural marriage. The needs of the Church and the society in which we live are completely different than they were 170 years ago. In addition, the principle was restored once; I see no reason for it to be restored again.  Needless to say, when the Lord told Joseph Smith that it was to be instituted, I don’t believe He gave a specific reasoning behind it. Some have speculated it was to build a might missionary force; others that He wanted the women cared for (citing the belief that there were more women than me); others that He wanted to grow the Church quickly. Even if any of those speculations were the reason, none of them would apply now.

      We were discussing chapters 31 through 33 of 2 Nephi today. One thing bugged me that always bugs me.  It seems to be a popular belief that we are baptised to receive a remission of our sins, or more specifically baptism washes our sins away. The problem with this conception is that it minimises the role repentance plays in the conversion process.  Remission of sins is not granted through baptism alone or solely on the merits of baptism. Remission of sins comes as a result of our commitment to Jesus, just as it does after baptism. For our sins to be remitted we first need to exercise faith in the Saviour. We need to exercise faith that He lives, He loves us, He overcame the effects of physical and spiritual death and that his life is an ideal pattern for us to follow.   urlLink Amulek taught  that following our faith will eventually lead us to repent. As our faith in Jesus grows our desire to be more like Him grows also. This in turn will convince us to both feel sorrow for and forsake our sins. This is done through repentance.  Following the forgiveness of our sins and commitment to be like Him, we feel a desire to express our commitment. We do so through baptism. Baptism serves as the manifestation of the covenant we make with Our Brother to follow Him.  Following baptism, we are baptised by fire and the Holy Ghost, which subsequently  urlLink sanctifies us .  You see, remission of sins comes as a result of a process. We need to have faith in Jesus, repent of our sins, be baptised and receive the Holy Spirit. I honestly fail how leaving out the other three (whether literally or intellectually) can honestly give us a remission of sins.

      Two inmates at Arizona State Prison Complex- Lewis in Buckey, AZ, took two guards hostage (one female and one male) back in January. They released the male guard less than a week later and the female guard at the beginning of the month. This week the two inmates were each indicted on sexual assault charges the female guard had laid against them.  Now that  urlLink they’ve been convicted , I wonder what’s going to happen to them. Are they going to be sent to prison? Oh, wait a minute, they’re already in prison. Maybe they’re sentences will be extended. Of course, if they kidnapped and raped while in prison, I’m not sure how keeping them in prison longer will change things. Or maybe they have a “special programme” in prisons for prisoners like this or whom the prison guards do not like.  Makes you wonder how effective prison is.

      David Sundwall, over at  urlLink A Soft Answer  must consider this blog to have some sort of credibility to it. He has given us the great honour of moving from simply "Mormon Bloggers" to "LDS Blogs". This means I'm no longer considered to be a member with a blog, but a blog for members.  Of course, I'm not sure David is much of an authority on what makes quality blogs, but it's a nice gesture nonetheless. Perhaps this isn't a bunch of incoherent babbling after all.

      The Lethbridge Herald reported ysterday that 70% of attendees to yesterday’s Catholic-public school board open house meeting voted to turn down the P3 proposal.  The P3 proposal would see funding for a new high school in West Lethbridge coming from the private sector. The high school would be jointly run on a contract/lease basis by both school boards and would include a second branch of the municipal library. The Chinook Health Region, the University of Lethbridge and Lethbridge Community College would also participate in the programmes at the institution.  Of course, since we live in a country that values its socialist ideas (health care, education, etc), many of the local citizens are afraid, for whatever reason, what such a partnership would produce.   Since the province refuses to send money to the third-largest city in Alberta for a high-school to serve a population on the Westside of over 20,000 people (including over 1,000 students who get bussed to the Southside each day), this was our only option.  Oh well, the students have been taking the bus for years now. What’s a few more? After all, they’re teenagers, so what they need doesn’t matter. Just like the Westside skate park. But that’s a post for another day.

      The Salt Lake Tribune  urlLink reported today  that a new buffer zone and a new “no standing” zone will be set up around the Conference Center for next month’s General Conference. These zones will provide more separation between protestors and conference-goers. The Church, as a result of two of its members being arrested for provocated violence last Conference, naturally wanted more of a buffer zone than has been granted to them. This is a prime example of how the government tries to compromise between civil rights—in this case the right to protest and the right to worship.  As encouraging as this new development is, what is more so is the fact that a group of local evangelical churches have banded together, calling themselves Standing Together Ministries, and, in support of the conference-goers, planned to take up room in the standing zones in an effort to limit the number of protesters outside of the Conference Center. As Rev. Gregory Johnson, director of Standing Together, says, “you have the right to attend your meetings without being yelled at or offended.”  I am always encouraged by the sight of Christian churches helping one another, but I am more favourably encouraged—understandably so—when those churches are in support of mine.

      In my History and Development of Theatre class on Monday, we started discussing the Existentialism movement in theatre. The movement is finding out the meaning of existence and grows out of response to the Second World War. However, from what I understand, the premise behind it is that its supporters felt that this meaning could not be found in religion or government because these institutions failed humanity during the war. As a result, each individual had to discover his or her own unique meaning to life.  While home teaching last night, I found a parallel between the Existentialism supporters and President Monson’s  First Presidency Message  on finding peace. In part of the message, he stated:   The consequences of conflict are so devastating that we yearn for guidance—even a way to ensure our success as we seek the path to peace. What is the way to obtain such a universal blessing? Are there prerequisites…May I suggest three ideas to prompt our thinking and guide our footsteps: search inward…? He then goes on to talk about searching inward and the merits of self-evaluation. While his message revolves around peace for our soul searching and the existentialists promote soul searching for finding meaning in life, the two purposes are closely linked. Life is about finding peace. It’s about finding peace with one’s self, peace with others and peace with deity.  I fully support and encourage the idea of looking inside one’s self—whether to find peace or to find meaning in life—because the further one goes within, the closer one comes to God.

      In a post at  urlLink By Common Consent , Karen Hall brings up the topic of how women are treated in the Church. Naturally, there is a lot of discussion and of course varying opinions.  I'm not going to be naïve enough to think that women have all the same opportunities in the Church as men have. At the same time, I'm not going to be so close minded as to think the Church hasn't been somewhat progressive when it comes to women generally and women leaders specifically.  It wasn’t but a few years ago that women were not to give prayers in Sacrament meeting. Now Salt Lake gives counsel that specifically says, “Men and women may offer prayers in Church meetings”. Not too long ago, General Conference sermons were given exclusively by male leaders. Now, sermons by stake presidents have been replaced with more authoritative general leadership (Relief Society, Young Women and Primary). Relatively recently, the mission statement of the Young Men organisation was changed to include the declaration “give proper respect to women, girls, and children.” It’s also a rare occasion to find a husband in the bishop’s office when a call is extended to his wife, let alone finding the bishop (or even the stake president) asking his permission to extend a call to his wife.  Given the experience Karen relates in  urlLink her post , I regretfully assume it will still be a while before women are treated as social equals, but in all honesty, I believe that the Church—despite having to be Priesthood-centred—is doing what it can to get the ball rolling and has certainly come a long way.  It’s still up to each individual, however.

      US Presidential Candidate Sterling Allan wrote to the Salt Lake Tribune yesterday commenting on the  urlLink PETA billboard . I’m not surprised by the letter given past conversations I’ve had with him regarding the Word of Wisdom; however, I do have some thoughts on something he said.   [The] University of Utah School of Social Work did a study about 20 years ago concerning cancer rates, and one of the findings was that Utahans are among the highest in the nation in meat consumption. Firstly, how accurate can a twenty year old study be in portraying today’s society? Are Utahans still among the highest meat consumers in the United States? Was this only a product of the early 80s?  Secondly, I assume Allan uses this citation to illustrate that members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints eat a lot of meat. However, I would be interested to know what the proportion was at that time (and even now) of Utahans who are LDS and those who were not and the consumption of meat for each.  Lastly, did the study give meat consumption as a whole for Utah, or did it give it per capita? Does it suggest Utahans eat lots of meat because they gorge themselves or because they have large families? Did it include only citizens of Utah or all the millions of tourists who visit as well?  Sometimes it bothers me when someone interprets a study, bases an argument on that interpretation, and then expects everyone else to accept it despite the absence of all other facts.

      In Gospel Doctrine Class yesterday, a person mentioned something about people going on the Internet to look for old friends and then leaving their spouse for someone else.  What I wonder is if someone is still romantically interested in an old friend, what in Sam Blazes are they doing getting married? Form where I stand, marriage is about commitment. You get married to someone no only because you love the person, but because you do so at such a level that you are willing to throw away all past romances and commit your entire life to this new person. In many cases, you are willing to be a partner in creating new creatures of life.  If someone is not willing to throw away all past romances, does that mean the person was never committed to the marriage in the first place? If so, then why in tarnation did he or she get married? What possible motive could there have been if not to devote himself or herself to the spouse?  A word to those contemplating marriage: If you aren’t willing to sacrifice it all, don’t do it. The world needs less divorces and broken families, not more of them.

      In somewhat of a follow-up to yesterday's post, it seems that everywhere I turn now, I come across another blog for a member of the Church who is liberally-minded. I don't mind; it's nice not feeling so alone. Here are some of the ones I've come across thus far. Keep in mind that some are more liberal than others. That doesn't make them bad, just "different".    urlLink Times and Seasons     urlLink By Common Consent     urlLink Orson's Telescope    Maybe now, when I get shot down for defending evolution in elders quorum, I will have a place to go for support.

      Thanks to a new blog I came across today, I found a site called  urlLink The Political Compass . It has a six-page test you can fill out that will tell you where in the political spectrum you fit based on your ideologies and answers to political, social and moral questions.  I completed the test and was told I belong in the Liberal Left. This is the same quadrant that Ghandi, Nelson Mandella and the Dalai Lama fall into. They, however, are much more libertarian and left than I. In fact,  urlLink according to the grid  I am 2.00 on the economic left side and 2.36 on the Social Liberalism side.  Does this mean I'll never be bishop?

      Someone decided that Lethbridge needs a truck stop and is going to put it in the old County Foods location on 43rd St near  urlLink Exhibition Park . Some nearby residents are upset about it citing concerns of increased noise, traffic, pollution and drunk driving (there will be a bar there). Since it technically is located in the  urlLink County of Lethbridge , the  urlLink City government  cannot do much about it. Nevertheless, Council unanimously support the idea.  So do I. There is no full-service truck stop (laundry, food, shower, gas, etc) between Montana and Calgary. There are a number of little pit-stop-grade spots along the way, but nothing in regards to what the truckers need to make their recommended every-four-hour stops.  The street is much like a freeway. It has two lanes and a huge buffer zone between the lanes and the residential areas. Most of the freeway is not surrounded by homes. The truckers who will be using the truck stop will be the ones who currently drive down 43rd since it is a truck route anyhow. The spot will be no noisier than  urlLink Whoop Up Days  at Exhibition Park during the summer. This means there is no increase in pollution, noise, or traffic than there already is.  As far as drunk driving goes, I don’t by this argument. If the opponents were able to provide some proof that truck drivers have a higher incident rate for drunk driving, then I might be convinced. However, I think that is unlikely. After all, what truck drive is willing to lose his job, be incarcerated or even risk killing someone?  The stop is much needed, and I think it’s about time. For all we know, it may encourage more development. And everyone knows Lethbridge needs more non-retail development.

      CNN and some Utah media outlets have reported that a mother of twins is being charged with murder. Apparently, she refused council to have a caesarean section operation performed. When her sons were born, one was not alive and autopsy reports state that he died in utero two days previous. The murder charge stems from this.  I’m not going to comment on the rights of the mother versus the right of the baby since this is a very specific and complex case. However, there is one thing in the CNN article that caught my attention.  “In January, the state Supreme Court ruled that unborn children at all stages of development are covered under the state's criminal homicide statute. The law exempts the death of a fetus during an abortion.”  Let me get this straight. A few months ago, she could walk into a clinic, have someone perform an operation that would kill her baby, but she would not be charged with murder. However, since she refused an operation that perhaps would have saved her baby she will be charged with murder. So, in one case, her baby dies because of a specific action to take its life and she is not charged; yet in the other case the baby dies not because of a specific action to take its life and she is charged.  Where’s the logic in that?

      I came across an article by Orson Scott Card entitled  Homosexual "Marriage" and Civilization . Naturally, since we both belong to the same church, I agree with many of his points. However, there was one statement that I found to be odd, particularly since much of the article was well-written.   So it is a flat lie to say that homosexuals are deprived of any civil right pertaining to marriage. To get those civil rights, all homosexuals have to do is find someone of the opposite sex willing to join them in marriage. Surely, Card isn’t naïve enough to think gays and lesbians just want to get married absolutely. Surely he doesn’t think the issue is not being able to get married at all. It is clear that homosexuals want to marry other homosexuals, just as heterosexuals are able to marry other heterosexuals. To suggest that they are entitled to marriage as long as they marry someone they don’t want to is a ridiculous claim and belittles the seriousness of the issue.  I don’t agree with gay marriages in and of themselves—see my  urlLink previous comments —but if someone is going to make a comment like that, it’s no wonder we’re labelled as bigots, backwards and intolerant.

      On the bus this morning, a fellow passenger was relating something someone said to him who was staying at his house. This person had told him that when he married his wife, he made a promise with God that he would be faithful to his wife if He made him rich.  Is not the purpose of marriage to show that you are committed to one person? If you love a person enough to get married, why should you need incentive to stay married beyond the satisfaction the relationship provides?  Incidentally, the man did not end up rich. In fact, he even lost his business. Some, if they were in his shoes, might cynically suggest God didn't exist or rationalise they weren't faithful enough. From where I stand, I don't see why God should bless someone with riches for something they should be doing anyhow.

      Someone posted on one of the message boards I frequent a URL to a website that diagnoses your past life. In fact, here's the URL.   urlLink http://www.thebigview.com/pastlife/   Now, I don't believe in reincarnation in the familiar sense—although I believe an individual goes through various stages of existence—however, if I did, I have a feeling I might find this website at the very least disconcerting and perhaps even offensive.   It bases the diagnosis solely on one's birth date. That is to say everyone born on the same day I was happened to be a construction worker in northern India around 700 CE and is here at this time to study psychological sciences and ancient manuscripts. Seriously? Every single person of the thousands or perhaps hundreds of thousands born on that day? Each one of us lived the same life at the same time in the same place and are here at this time for the same purpose?  Right.

      Apparently, PETA has members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on their team now. A billboard ad was recently erected in Salt Lake City, UT, that has an image of God with a staff in his right hand and a handful of vegetables in the left hand (symbolical?). The caption read, "And [animals] hath God made for the use of man only in times of famine and excess of hunger." It then gives Doctrine and Covenants 89:15 as the scriptural reference.  An article in today's Salt Lake Tribune quotes from Sean Diener and Tom Rogers. Diener is mentioned as a spokesperson for PETA, and while the article doesn't specifically quote him as saying the passage says what the billboard ad says it does, it does imply that.  I'm not sure why the Tribune chose Rogers. Other than being a "dairyman-turned-vegetarian", the article gives no indication to what significance Rogers has in either interpreting scripture or even commenting on the issue. Of course any average Joe could be used to give his opinion on the issue, but if that was the reasoning, why not pick another average Joe to give an opposing opinion. Why use an official spokesperson from both sides (Diener and LDS spokesperson Mike Otterson), but only an average Joe for one side. I'll never understand the logic in the media.  Anyhow, the end of the article has Rogers stating that LDS scripture, if taken literally, makes it pretty clear that meat should be eliminated from the diet. Using his suggestion, however, D&C 89:15—in reference to verse 14—specifies only beasts of the field, flying fowl and wild animals. No mention of poultry or seafood. It could also be interpreted to refer to all grain. That's literal.  I've said it before and I'll say it again. The scriptures do not condone an herbivore diet any more than they condone a carnivore diet.

      We went to the Cardston Alberta Temple today to do some ordinance work for some of my relatives. A few of them were distant relatives to whom I am not directly related. Of course, they need the work done as much as the next person, but I didn’t feel a real kinship with them. However, the high point of the experiences when Mary and I were able to perform work for more intimate relatives, such as my grandparents, great grandparents and great great grandparents.  It was certainly an experience worth repeating.

      I was in one of my classes today and the instructor asked the question, “What do we notice first about a person”. Typical responses were things like eyes, gender, posture, etc. One suggestion that caught my attention was race.  I offered the counter to the teacher—and simultaneously—the class, that perhaps we don’t always notice race first. My line of thinking was that if a white person, who lives in a predominately white society, walks into a room with only white people, will he or she notice that everyone is white? I suggested that the individual would not.  A fellow student—who happens to be white—offered a different opinion, arguing that he would notice it. When I asked him, “So if you went into a room with all white people, you would think to yourself, ‘Oh, my. There sure are a lot of white people in here’”, he responded with a resounding “yes”. Odd.  I’ve lived in a predominantly white society for a few decades and upon walking into a room full of white persons, I never once—as far as I can recall—have ever thought to myself, “Oh, my. There sure are a lot of white people in here”.  On the other hand, I also suggested to the class that someone would only notice race if:    Everyone in the room is a different colour than the person entering the room   One or two individuals in the room are a different colour than everyone else in the room.    Admittedly, when going back to Vancouver for Christmas, it was a interesting to experience to be back in a society that had Indians, Pakistanis, Koreans, Chinese, Japanese, and so forth. Lethbridge is a little uneven on the white side when it comes to the multicultural spectrum. Spending as much time as we have in Lethbridge made our multicultural experience in Vancouver that much more noticeable. In fact, I even turned to Mary and suggested, “You certainly wouldn’t see this in Lethbridge”. Yet, when we lived in Vancouver, it was something we took for granted and that we rarely, if ever, noticed.  Suffice it to say, I don’t think race is absolutely one of the first things we notice in a person upon seeing her or him for the first time.

      There has been a lot of discussion lately about gay marriage. Canada is in the process of redefining their laws to define marriage as involving "two persons" rather than "a man and a woman"; some states and cities in the USA are openly welcoming and promoting same sex marriages; various message boards I frequent have at least one thread devoted to gay marriages.   The escalation in emotions I see and hear in discussions does not the situation either. The fundamentalist Christians call the homosexuals of the world the spawn of Satan and accuse them of destroying the institution of marriage. Gays and lesbians label the Christians as backward, prejudiced, intolerant, and stuck in the past.   As a faithful Christian, I disagree with homosexual activity and ultimately with homosexual unions. If marriages were the sole domain of the churches, this wouldn’t be an issue for me. How churches run themselves really makes no difference to me so long as no one is physically harmed or treated inhumanely. However, for whatever reason, the state took over marriage. This means marriage is now a civil ordinance. The government is under obligation to its citizens to ensure that no civil right is withheld from a group of persons. Just as it was under obligation to allow women to vote or Blacks to participate in the same institutions as Whites, it is under obligation to allow gays to marry.  Again, I do not agree with concept of families with gay parents or with homosexuality in general. However, the governments cannot overlook the fact that they are under civil obligation to allow civil rights to all their citizens. At the same time, I pray that governments will uphold our freedom to practise our religion the way we see fit and do not force us to have to allow gay unions.

      This afternoon, Sara Turner, one of the directors who had me come for callbacks emailed me and told me I got a part. I was elated. I will be playing Ernest from Tad Mosel's  Impromptu , a play about four actors who are trying to work on a play but who keep interjecting personal dialogue. Ernest is an egotistical character who thinks the world revolves around him and is distraught when he doesn't get enough lines. It looks like it's a dynamic part that will really help me stretch my abilities.  It sure is nice to be cast for something again. The last time was for a pioneer play in Vancouver in 1997. I only had a ten minute monologue with no interaction with any other characters.  I'm looking forward to this. I just wish I wasn't going to be away from my family so much over the month. Performance is on 7 April.

      There is a  urlLink statement  on the Church’s official website for the UK & Ireland area. The statement opposes the upcoming Gender recognition Bill. The Bill supposedly makes gender changes legal (or perhaps removes any illegality) and allow the person will be able to marry someone under the proposed new gender. For example, If Robert becomes Roberta, s/he can then legally become Bill’s wife. It also supposedly will make it illegal for anyone in a leadership position to disclose the birth gender of such a person.  The statement also encourages local members of the Church to write to their Member of Parliament. One thing the Area Presidency suggests be covered in such a letter is that the bill “poses a real threat to religious freedom” and that “it runs counter to the will of God”. I understand the sentiment behind this, but based on the interpretive summary given on this page, I am not sure I understand the logic.  Firstly, how does making gender changes legal threaten religious freedom? How does it restrict our freedom to worship God how we may?  Secondly, does the bill actually say that transsexuals will be able to marry someone of the opposite gender to their new gender? Or is this an interpretation of the Bill?  Lastly, is the Area Presidency suggesting that God’s will is that it be illegal for someone to have a sex change?

      A Letter to the Editor appeared in today’s Lethbridge Herald saying that Picture Butte (pop. 1,701) needed a bridge more than West Lethbridge (pop. 20,000+) needed a third bridge. This was my response.   I am responding to Arvid Oseen's implication that the Picture Butte bridge is a higher priority than another Westside bridge. I admit there is some merit in having a bridge for Picture butte residents, yet I don't think it removes any necessity of a Westside bridge.  West Lethbridge residents number 23,000. In 15 years, the population will double and be half of Lethbridge's total population. Comparatively, the population of the entire County of Lethbridge falls below 10,000.  Current traffic flow on Crowsnest Trail from University Drive to the 1st Avenue exit is 18,733 daily vehicles. Whoop-Up Drive between University Dr and Scenic Drive sees 40,578 daily vehicles. In comparison, daily traffic on University Drive north of the CPR overpass is 2,514, and 17,390 on Crowsnest Trail east of 43rd (includes all traffic, not just that from northern Lethbridge County).  Based on these two comparisons alone, it seems a third Westside bridge would be a more efficient use of resources than a bridge from Picture Butte. Again, I see merit in both projects, but the implication that Picture Butte's needs are greater than those of post-secondary employees, students and Westside residents because Picture Butte has been asking longer is simply unfounded.

      I received a suggestion from a fellow Bloggernacker to post about  urlLink Answerbag . I’m an administrator there, so not only is this a shameless attempt at what pitiful little amount of traffic I can extract from this obscure blog that no one visits, but it’s also a way for me to explain what Answerbag is.  Answerbag is similar to Google Answers, but unlike Google Answers, Answerbag is free of charge for users to both ask questions and answer them. It works like this.  Person A asks the question, “Why is the sky blue?” Persons B, C, D and E all respond with various reasons. Then Persons F, G, H, I and J (and even Persons A through E) come along and rate the answers as “useful”, “somewhat useful”, “incorrect” or “offensive”. All answers that are not rated “useful” require that a comment accompany the rating. All the ratings a person receives are totalled and in turn give him/her a personal rating. The premise is that over time, you would be able to judge a person’s answer based on both the rating the answer received and the rating the person has.  While it has been fun to post close to 400 messages and receive close to 550 ratings, what has really been a blast is reviewing questions and answers. While most of them are tame, some of them are downright hilarious. For example, there was the time that someone was offended that I gave him a “somewhat useful” rating to one of his answers in the  urlLink Mormonism section  of Answerbag. In turn, he deliberately deleted his answer and replaced it with “Oh, go shoot yourself, Kim”. Ah, you gotta love those Christ-like members, eh?

      Some guy in the United States decided that since his ex-wife took off with the $4000 engagement ring he bought her, he’d  urlLink pawn her wedding dress  on eBay. The auction is up to 600 USD, and has over 70 bids. Impressive, but that is not the good part. He has his very own blog going on there. And it’s funny as helicopter.

      In this month’s Ensign, Elder Aleksandr N. Manzhos, an Area Authority Seventy, wrote of a young mother in Dnipropetrovsk, Ukraine. She had very low factory wages that were paid to her infrequently, and she lived in the factory’s dormitory. It was very difficult to provide for herself and for her one-year-old child. Not long after her baptism, she was preparing food for herself and her child when a young woman who lived in the same building said: “I know things are difficult for you. Like me, you are a single mother, earning low wages, with no place of your own to live. There is little hope of a good future for yourself and your child. Like me, you have a gray, dull life. Like me, you fear for your child and the uncertainty of tomorrow. But why are you always smiling and your eyes always shining? Why does joy light up your face?”  The questions made this sister stop and think about the changes that had occurred since her baptism. As she gained faith in Jesus Christ, the fear that had corroded her life had disappeared. The path back to the Father that opened before her had permitted her to have hope, which had led her to baptism and developed within her a certainty of a tranquil and happy future for her small family. By receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost, she had received a firm testimony. The false values of the world gradually gave way to the higher values of the gospel, and these higher values became a firm foundation for both thought and deed. She realized that it was precisely these changes that had given her a new outlook on the world. Long-awaited joy and peace had come into her life. Reading this cause me to reflect on my own life and the hardships I’ve faced. It also raises the question: if converts in poverty-stricken and economically fallen areas are able to gain so much faith and optimism despite their hard times, why can those of us already in the faith in relatively richer areas not have the same optimism when we are stricken with poverty? Why does unemployment or serious illness get us down so easily?

      My children and I made some Almond Crisp cookies last night. They were actually quite tasty. What little of them that were left today I brought to work to give to my co-workers. The interesting this is that when I offered them, each asked me, “Did you make this or did your wife”. If my wife was in my place, it is highly likely she would not have been asked the same question.  Have we become so wrapped up in having stay-at-home mums that we think fathers are incapable of doing homey things like making cookies? Do we still, in 2004, have this Molly Mormon ideal where the wife/mother—as part of her routine—regularly bakes cookies for the sole purpose of treating the guys at work?

      I am glad I live in 2004. I am in love with the Information Age. I am employed maintaining a website for a post-secondary institution. I am a prolific emailer. I am an administrator and  urlLink Answerbag . I am an editall editor at the  urlLink Open Directory Project . I have four instant messaging accounts. I have a Pocket PC.  I used to have to take a briefcase to church each Sunday. Now I just bring my PocketPC. When we sing hymns in opening exercises of priesthood, I bring out my PocketPC. When I have to teach the lesson in deacons quorum, I bring out my PocketPC. When I attend Gospel Doctrine class, I bring out my PocketPC. When I have to give a talk in sacrament meeting, I use my PocketPC. I use my PocketPC to take notes in stake conference, give reports in Ward Council, give the First Presidency Message in home teaching visits, and to read the Ensign and study my scriptures while commuting to work.  What used to take a whole briefcase (and more actually) now fits not only in the palm of my hand, but in my pocket, too.

      In the general session of stake conference today, a member of the stake presidency made mention of the loss of their two boys last June. They went mountain climbing in Russia, and were never heard from again. One of the things he said was that he was thankful for all the prayers and fasting members of the stake did on behalf of their sons.  This caused me to think about something. Despite the prayers and fasting, their sons never returned home and were presumed dead. Contrastingly, two years ago, all the members in Lethbridge and the surrounding communities prayed and fasted that we would receive the necessary moisture to help local farmers. Lo, and behold, the moisture came and reservoirs were filled to the highest level they had seen in years.  Here we have on instance where praying and fasting brought about a miracle and another where praying and fasting did not. Critics of organised religion would suggest that it’s only coincidence. If things go the way we want, it is an answer to prayer; if they don’t, it is God’s will. They think such an assumption is preposterous.  It doesn’t take much to see why they would think that either. There must be something more. How can we convince the naysayer that it is not coincidence? How do we convince them that we don’t just choose our miracles when they are convenient? How do we convince them that it really is God’s will?

      Over at  urlLink By Common Consent , a discussion is ensuing regarding the eternal family. I've always had a bit o' difficulty with the use of the phrase "families can be forever". Let me explain.  I am sealed to my parents. As such, I am supposed to be able to live with them in the Celestial Kingdom. I am sealed to my wife. As such, I am supposed to be able to live with her in the Celestial Kingdom. I am sealed to my children. As such, I am supposed to be able to live with them in the Celestial Kingdom. The same will happen with grandchildren, great-grandchildren, etc, as well as grandparents, great-parents etc (so long as they accept the work that has been done for them).  The premise then is that we will all live together in one place. When you take into consideration how everyone is related potentially to each other and can trace lineages back to Adam, everyone will be living together as one big forever family.  Now consider the thought that we apparently will be gods and goddesses over our own worlds. If each couple is reigning over their own world, how can all of the couple be living together as one big eternal family?  Sometimes, I wonder if the sealing is more than simply linking parents to children. Sometimes, I wonder if it is more a way to seal our exaltation.

      Earlier this week, I met with one of my deacons to review his Duty to God accomplishment before he advanced to the teachers quorum. One of the requirements he had to fulfill was to read the sacrament prayer scriptures and then write a couple of paragraphs about the purpose of the sacrament. One of the things he mentioned, of course, is that one of the purposes was for us to renew our baptismal covenants each week.  I’ve been thinking about that this week, and tonight one of the speakers in the adult session of stake conference said the same thing; we renew our baptismal covenants when we partake of the sacrament. As a result, I decided to study Mosiah 18:10 and D&C 20:77. Now I wonder if we really are renewing baptismal covenants when we partake of the sacrament.  Here’s the text of Mosiah 18:10. Make particular note of the use of the actual word “covenant”. Now I say unto you, if this be the desire of your hearts, what have you against being baptized in the name of the Lord, as a witness before him that ye have entered into a  covenant  with him, that ye will serve him and keep his commandments, that he may pour out his Spirit more abundantly upon you? Now, the text of D&C 20:77. Note the absence of the word “covenant”. O God, the Eternal Father, we ask thee in the name of thy Son, Jesus Christ, to bless and sanctify this bread to the souls of all those who partake of it, that they may eat in remembrance of the body of thy Son, and witness unto thee, O God, the Eternal Father, that they are willing to take upon them the name of thy Son, and always remember him and keep his commandments which he has given them; that they may always have his Spirit to be with them. Amen. Both use the terms “witness” and “will/willing”. Both mention that we will—are willing to—keep the commandments. Yet only the first specifically mentions the covenant. However, do we really make the same covenant each week?  Does the baptismal covenant expire each week, making it necessary to “renew” it?

      I help administer a website called  urlLink Answerbag . The premise of the site is that individuals may submit questions on any topic and other individuals may respond with answers. In addition, individuals may rate the answers. In time, others may be able to determine based on the ratings how reliable an answer is. It is the ever-cheap-LDS answer to  urlLink Google Answers .  The Mormon section is one of the high traffic areas. It is also one of the most energetic and explosive areas. This is partly due to the over-representation of born-again Christians and LDS teenage boys. One of the things the born-agains and the teenage boys do not like is having their answers rated with anything other than 100%. Their response to anything other than 100% ratings, of course, is to go and rate poorly otherwise useful and informative answers given by others.  I am a prolific poster there with my number of answers rapidly approaching 400 and the number of ratings over 500. Naturally, I have received more than one “negative” rating and it does not affect me as much as it does some of the aforementioned parties. The times it affects me the most is when I am blatantly correct in my answer and  urlLink someone insists I am not . Nevertheless, at over 500 ratings, the occasional negative one does not seem to affect my overall rating percentage, so it is no sweat off my nose.  At the risk of sounding as if I am rambling, I will get to my point. Earlier this week, one individual decided to take great offence to one of the ratings I gave to his less than eloquent response. Not only did he expectedly rate me poorly, he decided to write me an email. He informed me he was a missionary.  The first email seemed innocent enough but contained the declaration that I was prideful. It also revealed to me that he was intent on ridding the world of half-truths about the Church, and he inquired what my purpose on the site was. I politely replied to inform him that I was not prideful, that he will not be effective at ridding the world of half-truths by using the internet as his medium and that my purpose at Answerbag was to answer questions, and as an administrator, review submissions. I also suggested that refraining from childishly belittling other churches would go further to keeping the Church’s image clean.  The second email from this missionary suggested that I had received my administrative responsibilities because of a bribe; that he was now a mission president; that being an Alpha Male now replaced my pride; that I was dishonest; and that I did not give out enough referrals to the full-time missionaries. My response was an attempt to assure him that I was neither dishonest nor an Alpha Male and that I, in fact, had a gospel discussion with my chiropractor the night before. I also pointed out that based on his grammar, it was doubtful that he was a mission president.  The third email established that his purpose in writing me was to “pump me up”. He said I did not have any “balls” and that my emails to him were taking up “valuable bashing time”. He also revealed that I was the “biggest wuss” he had ever seen, preachy (imagine that, a missionary calling me preachy) and ignorant (ironically, I believe he was not using it in the true sense of the word, referring to me as unlearned). Naturally, I responded to him that I need no pumping up. I told him the he was under no obligation to read my responses in the conversation that he initiated; if he felt it was a waste of his time, it was because he was not using his time wisely. I also informed him that I was neither preachy, ignorant nor a wuss. Oh and I told him that I was not taking sides in the “war” of his, and that I was doubtful that the Lord was either.  The final email in this fiasco stated that I was now perfect—mind you it was said sarcastically—funny, still the biggest wuss, scared, nerdy, hiding, hypocritical, cowardly, fence sitting and boring. He qualified the scared declaration with the apparent fact that the Spirit revealed this to him. He finished off the email by saying he was the son of Hugh Nibley. I assured him that none of the qualities he suggested I had were one I actually did. I also pointed out that fact that Hugh Nibley is 94-years-old; however, I also pointed out that since he was a mission president, it would make sense that his father would be 94-years-old.  I love it when people decide they want to start a inflammatory discussion with me. It is always so easy to point out the holes in their logic and the fallacies in their discussion. Unfortunately, intelligent people never initiate these dialogues. I wonder why that is.

      I was talking to a co-worker the other day and he related to me his visit to his hair stylist. She happened to be a member of the church, so naturally, he asked her to which ward she belonged. Surprisingly, her answer was, “Well, we haven’t found one we liked.”  This is a rather new phenomenon in our church, but I have seen it it among evangelical friends. Normally, other Christians who do not adhere themselves to one set of beliefs will  urlLink go from church to church —Anglican to Baptist to Presbyterian—until they find one that teaches what they believe and operate programmes they need.  In the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, however, the doctrines and programmes are the same. What can there possibly be for which there is to shop? I suppose the social atmosphere and demographics may vary from ward to ward. However, I certainly hope members of the church are not basing where they go to church simply on what wards meet their criteria.  I have most definitely lived in more than one ward since we have been married, but the ward we attended happened to be where our house was located. It was not the other way around.

      I am reading  Two Pence to Cross the Mersey , by Helen Forrester. It is an autobiography of her life in Liverpool during the Great Depression.  The story begins with Forrester at twelve years of age and her father just filed for bankruptcy. Apparently, her parents had lived quite the exorbitant life, but had no money to support it. When the depression hit and they realised they could not pay any of their massive debt load, they moved to her father’s birthplace of Liverpool. When he lived there, it was a place known for many jobs, but in actuality, the Depression made it one of the hardest hit areas of the Thirties.  Nevertheless, the family of seven lived quite poorly in whatever awful circumstances they could find. It seems undoubtedly horrid just reading about it. I was discussing this last night with Mary, and we tried to contemplate how a family could get to the point where they could not afford a home. There are many people who are homeless in capitalist society—quite a number even in little old Lethbridge—but they were not always homeless. Something had to happen that presented them with the decision to be without a home. Granted, some of those in such a situation find themselves thus literally overnight, but how do those who find themselves gradually approaching this situation manage not to stop themselves?  It is overwhelming. I consider myself very blessed that I have been able to keep my family financially afloat—although there have been many times I wondered how I would accomplish this. Certainly, I am forever grateful for the system the Church has set up.

      Montréal beat Boston in Game 7! Yay!  It’s the first time in 15 years that Montréal has won three games in a row against Boston. In fact, it's the  only  time Montréal has made a comeback when trailing 3-1 in the series. The highlight of course was when Boston pulled the goalie to have six men on the ice and Zednik shot into a wide open net with less than 10 seconds left in play. And to top it all off, it was a Boston home game.  Look out Tampa Bay!

      Someone decided to  urlLink sell garments  on eBay. Actually a number of people did. While I find it somewhat offensive, I reflected on it somewhat and have concluded thus. Sure, we could ask the Church to intervene, or even as members, write and complain to eBay to remove the auctions. But to what point should a business (such as eBay) be allowed to operate without any influence from a church? It is bad enough people think the Church runs politics in Utah (some people think it runs politics in southern Alberta for Pete’s sake). We do not need a bunch of people running around exclaiming that Church has its thumb on business, too.  That being said, it is reported that one of the auctions fetched over 1000$ for the final bid. What I have to wonder is why someone would pay over 1000$ for garments when they could buy them for much less at the Distribution Center.

      In Gospel Doctrine yesterday, we studied Enos, Jarom, Omni and Words of Mormon. Something Amaleki said caught my attention. And at the time that Mosiah discovered [the Mulekites], they had become exceedingly numerous...and their language had become corrupted; and they had brought no records with them; and they denied the being of their Creator; and Mosiah, nor the people of Mosiah, could understand them. But it came to pass that Mosiah caused that they should be taught in his language. And it came to pass that after they were taught in the language of Mosiah, Zarahemla gave a genealogy of his fathers, according to his memory...And it came to pass that the people of Zarahemla, and of Mosiah, did unite together; and Mosiah was appointed to be their king. (Omni 1:17-19) Granted, this all took place centuries ago under a completely different context. Nevertheless, it sure sounds a lot like colonialism measures of the 17th-19th centuries. There seem to be parallels, for example, between the English stomping out the language of the Irish, bringing Christianity to the godless aboriginal peoples of the Americas and having a single king over them all.  Is the Book of Mormon encouraging colonialism?

      After watching the Montreal-Boston game this afternoon, and hearing about the Vancouver-Calgary game later tonight, an interesting tidbit came to mind. Every game during this season's playoffs that involved a Canadian team has gone to a Game 7 (4-3). Every game that didn’t involve a Canadian team went only to Game 5 (4-1) or Game 6 (4-2).  I wonder what meaning there is behind that?  Then again, since at least 52% of the players in the NHL are Canadian, what team isn’t a “Canadian” team. ;-)

      We went to Sven Erickson’s for the first time. It’s been six years and it was the first time we’ve gone to this restaurant for supper. It was tasty food. The children eat free during the week, so with that discount, the bill came to around 35$. It even came with hors d'oeuvres, French onion soup and a loaf of bread. I had three-cheese tortellini with sautéed chicken strips.  The atmosphere was nice, too. Classier than casual, but not stuffy.  I like going to new restaurants.

       urlLink Acting Fundamentals and Play Writing & Analysis  are now finished. I enjoyed the Fundamentals class, but I really was ‘unfond’ of the Play Reading class. Not only was today the last class, but I have no assignments left for either class.  My final presentation for Fundamentals was today and I think Laura and I did a good job. I received compliments from at least four students and our teacher told us that comparing our rehearsals he’d seen with our performance that he could tell we had watched the film. I tell ya, watching the film sure gives a person a better understanding of how slimy some people can be. I enjoyed the performance, but I am glad it’s all over now.  All I have left is the H&D calls tomorrow and the subsequent final exam on Monday.  I am looking forward to a summer of no classes.

      In a discussion on a private board, a few of us have gotten into a 200-post discussion regarding what to use to describe the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and all its related sects.  Some cite the AP Stylebook: Mormon church: Acceptable in references to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, but the official name is preferred in first reference in a story dealing primarily with church activities. See the entry under the formal name.  Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The:…SPLINTER GROUPS: The term Mormon is not properly applied to the other Latter Day Saints churches that resulted from the split after Smith's death. Others say that the public doesn’t view it this way and will call other related sects Mormons. Most popular are the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints and its splinter groups. These same people think “Latter Day Saints” is much too specific and far less used to be an umbrella term; they prefer Mormonism.  What are the thoughts of my couple of readers?

      For our acting Fundamentals class today, we watched five productions of a scene from each of five plays. One in particular was Tony Kushner’s  Angels in America .  The scene begins with two members arguing about the insecurity of their relationship and the things each of them is hiding. The wife suffers from an addiction to Valium and alcoholism and the husband is struggling on whether to reveal his homosexuality.  While I can understand how  urlLink Valium addiction  may relate to many members of the Church, it baffles me still somewhat that members of the Church are portrayed as being gay and alcoholic.  Oh well, there are  urlLink all kinds , are there not?

      One more week of school left.  I had a four-day weekend this weekend. In between yard work, celebrating Regan’s third birthday, and rearranging furniture, I managed o get some work in on my two papers. I finished the paper on  A Raisin in the Sun  by Lorraine Hansberry, which is due tomorrow. I also finished about half of the paper on Anton Chekhov’s  The Cherry Orchard  that is due this Wednesday.  Thursday I have my final presentation (Scene 16 from  Les Liaisons Dangereuses  by Christopher Hampton) for Acting Fundamentals, as well as some written work for the scene (objectives, strategies, conflict, etc). Monday is my final exam for History and Development.  I tell ya, I’ll be so happy to be done next week and to have my weekends and evenings back.

      We had our Easter service today. It was interesting. We only had two talks—one on the Passover and one on the Atonement. The intermediate and closing numbers were both duets. In addition, the Primary children sang a musical number of God’s love being extended to us in sending His Son to Earth.  Two thoughts came to mind. First, I wish we had Fast & Testimony Sunday on Easter Sunday. I think if we did that, we would have more testimonies on Jesus. Secondly, I enjoy watching my daughter sing. Regan will be up there next year.  Oh, one more thing. In Gospel Doctrine class today, we discussed the  urlLink fifth chapter of Jacob . It was one of the more boring classes I have attended. Why does this lesson always have to be a mini history lesson (i.e. this part of the vineyard means this period of time; this part of the vineyard means that period of time)? I wish someone would teach it in a way that would encourage personal application of what is taught within. After all, I am certain Zenos, Jacob and Mormon each had that in mind when including it. That is how I focused on it while I was reading it. I got more out of it on my own than I did in class.  Of course, maybe that is the whole point.

      In true Kim Siever style, my mum  urlLink wrote a letter  to the editor of her local paper. Apparently, someone left a note on her windshield chastising her for parking in a handicapped stall, despite the sticker that authorises her to do so. These disability permits are not handed out in Cracker Jack boxes. You only get them after much deliberation and tests, etc., from your physician and specialist. Reminds me of Blanche Hollenbach who was  urlLink denied a parking spot  close to her office because it was allocated to a different business and there was one for her available on the other side of the street and down half a block.  Makes me wonder how people can be so dense.

       The Globe and Mail   urlLink reported today  that Stephen Harper’s Conservative Party is very close to the Liberal Party in popularity. That is scary.  Oh sure, I know what you’re thinking; I’m just like all those “other” Canadians who think Stephen Harper being Prime Minister is a scary thought. Actually, what I find scary is that with an election looming around the corner, I have not been convinced there is a party who will do a good job. The party for whom I voted in the last election merged with the NDP.  I am not saying they are all bad. It is just that each of them supports ideologies and practices I find attractive. However, none of them individually supports all of the ideologies I prefer. Hence, I cannot figure out whom to choose.  Maybe, I will throw darts to decide.  P.S. For those of you coming to this post looking for Stephen Harper's religion, one message board user  urlLink claims  he is "an End Times Christian fundamentalist". Oh and  urlLink here's  his birthday.

      I had my performance last night. I think we did a great job. Everyone helped make it memorable for me. It was my first true performance where I interacted with other actors and to which I actually auditioned.  The audience seemed to be pleased since their applause did not seemed feigned or weak, and Mary said afterward that she thought I did a great job.  I sure was nervous beforehand. Butterflies in my stomach, frequent peeing, the whole bit. Once I was on stage and getting into it, it was fine, and I enjoyed it.  I am glad I did it, but I sure am glad it is over.

      The federal government in Canada finally  urlLink imposed an involuntary ban  on the sale, resale, advertised and importation of baby walkers. There was a voluntary ban in place in the industry since the late 80s, but the Canadian government’s commitment to making these dangerous items illegal is a smart step for the safety of children.  It escapes me to understand why so many parents insist on use contraption to entertain their babies in light of the risks associated with them. Maybe the Canadian government will get cracking on jumpers and baby swings next.

      Marjorie Pay Hinckley, wife of President Hinckley,  urlLink passed away  this evening. It seems President Hinckley’s words on Sunday were somewhat prophetic. I am sure he knew something many of us did not.  It is always sad to see someone go on, but Sister Hinckley life was obviously winding down. It was going to happen eventually. I have heard loss of a spouse is very stressful. In some ways, I hope the stress does not take more years of President Hinckley’s life so he can stay with us longer. At the same time, there will always be a president of the Church, and at some point President and Sister Hinckley need to be together.  Nevertheless, I am reminded of when President Benson’s wife died in the early 90s. It was sad then and sad now.

      Mike Johnson  urlLink claims  his survival in the Columbine shootings was because he had faith in God. Now, I'm not trying to belittle faith in God nor saying one shouldn’t have faith in God. However, with all due respect, Mike, what a load of crock.  Surely, Mike isn't saying that Cassie Bernall and Rachel Scott had insufficient faith in God when they died. After all, they reportedly died while praising God.  Surely Mike isn't saying that  urlLink Melissa Peterson ,  urlLink Clark Henry Pixton  or  urlLink Hugh W. Pinnock  had insufficient faith in God when they died.  It just plain preposterousness to assume or even suggest God takes and leaves someone based on their level of faith. After all, the bullets coming from Eric's and Dylan's guns certainly didn't know the level of faith anyone had.

Air Canada is doomed. The public doesn’t want it (despite the fact that they’re forced to use the monopolistic behemoth). Let the airlines who have solid business plans take over the Canadian airways.  Just let the sleeping dog lie and quit beating the dead horse.

      Saturday, the Lethbridge Herald announced that the Real Canadian Superstore will be opening a new store in the Big Box area of town. It will be located on Mayor Magrath Drive opposite of Costco and Wal-Mart. This means their current, tiny Real Canadian Wholesale Club store will likely be replaced. The new store will be over 14,000 sq ft.  This is so exciting. I have wanted a Superstore here for so long. Now all we need is WestJet.

      It was Mary’s birthday yesterday. I feel bad that we could not do anything for it. We had the Morning Session of conference, then we did some shopping (groceries, not presents), then I had a four hour rehearsal, then I went to Priesthood Session. I finally was back home by 20:30 and by then it was too late.  We are planning to do something next Friday for both Mary’s birthday and Regan’s birthday. We also went shopping for clothes for Mary at the beginning of last month. Therefore, while I do feel bad about being away from her yesterday, I take some solace in the fact that we did something previously.  Next year will be different.

      President Boyd K. Packer, as part of his talk this afternoon, extolled the virtues of vaccination (or as he erroneously referred to it, immunisation). It made me wonder.  Why would a leader of the Church take a stand on a volatile topic as vaccinations at General Conference, and yet none of the leaders have taken a stand in this or last conference on what seem to be the greater moral issue of gay marriages? What sort of message does that give to members of the Church?  Surely, the Church is not lukewarm or indifferent toward the issue. Surely, the Church does not consider the issue of vaccinations to be more noteworthy than that of gay marriages.  Well, maybe someone will say something this afternoon. Of course, there is always next conference.

      In Priesthood Session of General Conference President Faust reminded the brethren to set the clocks ahead an hour for the start of Daylight Saving Time.  It reminds me of when I moved from Saskatchewan (where there is no DST) to British Columbia at the age of 16. The following October, someone mentioned that I needed to set my clocks back an hour. Thinking this was an odd request to make of me, I asked him why.  “Because it’s the end of Daylight Saving Time.”  “What’s Daylight Saving Time?”  “Every spring, we set our clocks ahead an hour. Every fall, we set them back an hour.”  “Why don’t you just leave them alone? The end result is the same.”  “It gives us more sunlight in the summer”  “No it doesn’t. It’s the same amount of sunlight.”  “But you can do more during the waking hours.”  “You mean you don’t have electricity here in Vancouver?”  And so forth.  DST is a load of crock. If Arizona and Saskatchewan do not need it, why does anywhere else.

      In Priesthood Preview last night, one of the speakers posed this question to the attendees: is baptism required for salvation? Staying true to popular LDS beliefs, the response was that baptism is requried for salvation.  This is where some Christians disagree with us. They claim that baptism is not required for salvation. Since I have a reputation of bucking LDS tradition in favour of doctrine, I must say that I agree with these other Christians.  You see, the whole problem stems from a misunderstanding—both of the other Christians and the LDS ones—on what the word “salvation” means. To a Christian it is being saved from our sins and living with God again; to a member of the Church, it is being saved from our sins and living with God again.  Then where is the difference? The Church teaches that heaven is composed of different degrees of glory with God living in the highest degree. Other Christians teach that heaven is singular, with no divisions, and God lives in this all-encompassing place.  In actuality, what members of the Church are referring to in this instance is exaltation, or “individual salvation”, as many leaders have taught. For example, “The…effect is to open a way for Individual Salvation whereby mankind may secure remission of personal sins. As these sins are the result of individual acts it is just that forgiveness for them should be conditioned on individual compliance with prescribed requirements ‘obedience to the laws and ordinances of the Gospel’” (James E. Talmadge, The Articles of Faith, 87).  "Conditional or individual salvation, that which comes by grace coupled with gospel obedience, consists in receiving an inheritance in the celestial kingdom of God. This kind of salvation follows faith, repentance, baptism, receipt of the Holy Ghost, and continued righteousness to the end of one's mortal probation" (Bruce R. McConkie, Mormon Doctrine, 670). Baptism, of course, is required for this salvation. On the other hand, everyone receives salvation—or general salvation—with no regard to his or her obedience or commitment to Jesus. “The first effect is to secure to all mankind alike, exemption from the penalty of the fall, thus providing a plan of General Salvation” (James E. Talmadge, The Articles of Faith, 87).  “Unconditional or general salvation, that which comes by grace alone without obedience to gospel law, consists in the mere fact of being resurrected. In this sense salvation is synonymous with immortality” (Bruce R. McConkie, Mormon Doctrine, 669-671).  “There will be a General Salvation for all in the sense in which that term is generally used, but salvation, meaning resurrection, is not exaltation" (Stephen L. Richards, Contributions of Joseph Smith, 5).  “General salvation comes regardless of obedience to gospel principles or laws and results solely in resurrection from the dead” (Theodore M. Burton, “Salvation and Exaltation,” Ensign, July 1972, 78). Baptism is not required for this salvation. It’s misunderstanding of our own doctrines that cause not only Christians to attack our beliefs, but us to try to defend our supposed doctrines, while we in effect exasperate the situation (i.e. Faith v. Works debate).

We had our last quiz in History and Development of Theatre; it was on Dadaism, Surrealism and Theatre of Cruelty. We handed in a paper on  The Laramie Project  in my Acting Fundamentals class this past Tuesday. We have a paper due tomorrow for  The Laramie Project  in my History and Development of Theatre class. Our essay drafts are due Monday for my Play Reading and Analysis class. We have to have a play (actually one scene from  Les Liaisons Dangereuses ) memorised for my Acting Fundamentals class this upcoming Tuesday. The  urlLink Directing Projects performance  takes place next Wednesday. My final essay version ( A Raisin in the Sun  by Lorraine Hansberry) for Play Reading and Analysis is due the following Monday (12th). My final paper on Anton Chekhov and  The Cherry Orchard  is due two days later on Wednesday the 14th for History and Development of Theatre. The Monday after (19th), I have my final exam for the same class.  Phew!

The message is unrelated to her disappearance.  A local Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints congregation in Corvallis, Oregon, is organising a non-denominational prayer vigil tonight at 19:00 local time on the front lawn of the Benton County Courthouse.  Searchers will focus their efforts today on the Crystal Lake Park and Willamette Park areas.  To date,  urlLink 1200 community volunteers  have come out in their efforts to find Brooke Wilberger, and they have searched nearly 2000 acres.  Sung Koo Kim, was  urlLink released  from jail when his family posted 10 percent of the $250,000 bail set by county jailers.

This is in addition to the $25,000 provided by Borden Chemical where Brooke’s father works. That brings the total reward money to $30,000 if Brooke is returned alive.  Corvallis police had narrowed their focus to four individuals as this week ended. One of those four,Sung Koo Kim, was  urlLink picked up  on a burglary charge. He is also guilty of stealing female underwear from nearby college dorms earlier this month.  As well, apparently an attempt was made last Thursday to force another young woman to get into a car by two mean. This incident happened in the same area where Brooke disappeared.  One thousand acres have been searched to date.

      Joseph Smith said, “…the Book of Mormon was the most correct of any book on earth…” ( Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith , p. 194).  What does that mean exactly? Does it mean that nothing in there is incorrect? Does it exclude all the grammatical and punctuation errors? Does it mean that all the principles therein are correct? Does it mean that the book is perfect as many believe? Does it mean that all other books on the earth are false? Does it mean all other books are only partially correct? Does this include scientific journals? Does it include personal diaries? Does it apply to Nephi’s father dwelling in a tent (see 1 Ne. 2: 15)?  Speaking of which, what does “The Book of Mormon is the Word of God” mean? Does that man every word spoken in it is what God said? Does it mean every word in it has to do with our eternal salvation? How is “my father dwelt in a tent” God’s word?

Actually, I do not mind sharing my lane with someone; I have shared others’ lanes before. What really irked me is that stayed on the same side no matter which direction she was going. If you are sharing lanes, the convention is that you always swim on your right-hand side, going in a counter-clockwise direction. No matter which direction she was going, she always stayed on the side closest to the patio.  Some people.

      Lethbridge mayor, Bob Tarleck, announced in a press conference yesterday that he is seeking a second term for mayor in this fall’s municipal election.  Ken Chapman implied in a letter to the editor in the Lethbridge Herald yesterday that he was running again for a seat on city council. Chapman ran in the 2001 election but did not garner enough votes to get a seat.  The Lethbridge Herald reported today that Barbara Lacey, currently sitting on city council, would also be running this election. She is in her third term now.  Last election, there were 35 candidates for city council and 5 for mayor. I hope that it won’t be that crazy this year. Then again, announcement of candidates didn’t happen last time until the summer.

      I’ve had many searches from MSN and Yahoo! looking for Brook Wilberger. Given the flurry of posts yesterday as I’ve tried to keep up to date on what was happening with the story, I’m not surprised. Google would have provided many visitors, but for some reason, even though it indexed my blog yesterday for Yahoo! and MSN, it provided an index for itself from last Saturday. Very weird.  But it gets weirder. Someone did a search for “gay lethbridge steam room” and my site came up second. Better still, the description Google provides goes like this:   Elizabeth Hudson, a former prostitute and drug addict is coming to Lethbridge. ... I am gay. ... Maybe it was the 15 minutes [in] the steam room after that helped.

       urlLink Speaking of Krispy Kreme , they are slowly opening new stores in Canada. The first one opened in Mississauga about a year ago or so and now there are about a dozen in Ontario. There are a few in Québec, and Delta, BC, received one around the beginning of the year. Calgary had its first store open in March, and someone at work brought back a tray.  I had heard a lot about Krispy Kreme doughnuts, so I thought I’d try one. I must say that I like Tim Horton’s doughnuts more. Krispy Kreme doughnuts are lighter and sweeter, but they also taste greasier and have more of an aftertaste. I think I prefer my doughnuts a bit heavier anyhow.  I’ve never been to a Krispy Kreme store, but I understand that when you walk from the front door to the ordering counter, you have to walk by the processing line. You get to see the entire Krispy Kreme doughnut creating process. Naturally, your mind is so enthralled by this, that by the time you get to the counter, your mouth is watering. I think part of the taste of a Krispy Kreme doughnut is in the mind.

She wanted a blog to document it.  She had been keeping a diary of her efforts and decided to switch to an online method.  Go over and check  urlLink it  out.

      Most of you may not know what a militant person I am when it comes to birth and how the average medical personnel treat it. A "new product" called the  urlLink PushPal  was created to help women have an "easier" time giving birth. Well, the picture on the front page itself tells the story.  First, that position—lying on the back ( urlLink lithotomy )—is the worst birthing position for a number of reasons. It puts strain and stress on the perineal tissues, increasing the risk of perineal tearing. It also puts pressure on the inferior vena cava, cutting off blood supply to the baby and to the mother. Many pregnant women can attest to the fact that as their pregnancy progresses, it is difficult to lie comfortably on their back for any length of time.  Doctors invented this position to allow them easier access to mothers giving birth. I don't birth in this position; I even have a hard time lying on my side. Each time I have given birth, I have been on hands and knees, and Kim will tell you it is one of the most difficult positions in which to catch the baby. However,  I  feel comfortable and I haven't torn yet.  If OBs want women to be more comfortable giving birth, then they would be better off letting  them  decide in which position to birth. As well, the developer of this device, Dr. J. Rhee, may have thirty years experience “delivering” babies—though catching would be a better term, as I have yet to meet a man capable of delivering a baby—but he certainly does not have any experience  giving  birth to babies. Therefore, he should keep his PushPals for his own use.

      We all know what it is like. You want to try so hard to implement standard compliant code and accessible design. Your boss or client wants you to implement something that is not one, the other or both.   My Experience   My experience happened as we were planning the new design for our website. Part of the decision to implement a design was the compilation of statistics that suggest most of our users were using resolutions of 1024x768. The design that was chose included a header image that was 955 pixels wide. This meant the whole page (or at least the par that contained the content) would be 955 pixels wide.  The problem with this is that users with lower resolutions and users who do not maximise their browsers (user statistics only show screen resolution, not the size of the window) will receive horizontal scrollbars. This called for a solution.  Enter JavaScript.  I know many people would rather not use JavaScript workarounds in an ideal world, but the real world is not the ideal world.   The HTML   First, we need some HTML inaccessible HTML code.   &lt;div id="header"&gt; 	&lt;h1&gt;Header Text&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div id="content"&gt; 	&lt;p&gt;Main content&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div id="footer"&gt; 	&lt;p&gt;Footer text.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   The inaccessibility lies in the CSS that assigns the three containers (header, content, footer) a width of 955 pixels.   The JavaScript   Now we need the magic code. First we need Scott Andrew LePera's  urlLink addEvent function . This allows us to add multiple functions to an event handler.   function addEvent(obj, evType, fn){     if (obj.addEventListener){         obj.addEventListener(evType, fn, true);         return true;     } else if (obj.attachEvent){         var r = obj.attachEvent("on"+evType, fn);         return r;     } else {         return false;     } }   Next we need to add an onload handler. This will check the size of the window and change the three containers to percentage based widths if the window width is below 1000 pixels and change it back to 955 pixels if it is over 1000 pixels.   function percentageWidths(){ 	if (document.body.clientWidth  		document.getElementById("header").style.width = "95%"; 		document.getElementById("content").style.width = "95%"; 		document.getElementById("footer").style.width = "95%"; 	} } function fixedWidths(){ 	if (document.body.clientWidth > 1000){ 		document.getElementById("header").style.width = "955px"; 		document.getElementById("content").style.width = "950px"; 		document.getElementById("footer").style.width = "955px"; 	} }   Next, we need an on resize handler. This will call the appropriate functions above when the window is resized.   addEvent(window, 'resize', function() { 	if (document.body.clientWidth  		percentageWidths(); 	} 	if (document.body.clientWidth > 1000){ 		fixedWidths(); 	} })   Lastly, we need an onload handler. It does the same as the previous handler except checks the window's width when the page has loaded.   addEvent(window, 'load', function() { 	if (document.body.clientWidth  		percentageWidths(); 	} 	if (document.body.clientWidth > 1000){ 		fixedWidths(); 	} })    Conclusion   As I said previously, this solution is not ideal. However, given the constraints of the situation, it will do for now. Maybe next summer, I can convince them to go with a design that is more flexible in nature.

      Someone I know is expecting a baby, and her estimated due date was last week. The doctors told her that if she does not go into labour by this Wednesday, they would induce labour artificially.  Why do doctors induce? Why do some mothers readily accept induction as a matter of course?  Firstly, it seems to me doctors induce because the baby is in the uterus too long. This is based on the estimated due date. However, the calculation of the EDD is dependent on the date of the last period. This of course, makes absolutely no sense whatsoever since a woman gets pregnant when she ovulates not when she menstruates. The assumption is that ovulation takes place 14 days following the previous menstrual period. Certainly, every doctor knows that there is rarely a woman out there who even ovulates 14 days after her last period. Why, then, do they insist on using an archaic, inaccurate method of determining when a baby is "supposed" to be born?  Secondly, do doctors and mothers really think that if a baby does not come out by a certain, predetermined date, the baby will stay inside the uterus and grow there indefinitely? What is this, an episode of  Alien ?  Ridiculous.

      On 01 March 1842, Joseph Smith wrote a letter to John Wentworth, editor of the Chicago democrat. The letter was a summary of the history and beliefs of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Part of the letter has become to be known as the Articles fo Faith. The twelfth on reads  We believe in being subject to kings, presidents, rulers and magistrates, in obeying, honoring, and sustaining the law.  That is all fine, but there are a few instances in the Book of Mormon when the citizens do not subject themselves to the political rulers and do not sustain the law. Take for example, the people of King Noah. The Lamanites were advancing on the city of Lehi-Nephi, and King Noah instructs the men to leave the children and women behind and flee. Some of the men do, but later kill the king and burn him at a stake.  Granted, King Noah was wicked and a corrupt leader, but it begs this question: at what point do we no longer need to subject ourselves to the laws of corrupt leaders? Was the government of Soviet Russia corrupt enough to warrant it? What about East Berlin or so-called “communist” China? What about Cuba? What about democratic countries led by corrupt politicians?

      Why do so many people need you to hold their hand in order to fulfill their home teaching responsibilities? Why do they need to be babied?  In the last six years, I have had roughly ten home teaching companions. Of those, two made appointments without me having to phone them to remind them. If I didn’t phone the other eight, no appointments would ever have been made.  I thought when you were an adult, a husband and a father, you were supposed to be responsible.

      A few people I knew will often buy things on sale, even if they would not normally buy them. To justify these unusual purchases, they say something like, “But it was 50% off”.  Let us say something normally costs ten dollars, and the store put it on sale for five dollars. Of course, it looks like a great deal. Now, let us say you never buy this item. However, because it is on sale, you decide to. You just spent five dollars you would not normally spend.  How is that saving money?

      I wonder sometimes if political correctness goes too far.  I often find I am trying to correct myself when using the term “high councilman”. I often want to say, “No, it’s ‘high councilperson’”.  Then I remember that only men sit on the high council.

      I was reading in Mosiah 19 today where King Noah and some of his men flee from the Lamanites. Some of the men stayed behind and they “caused that their  fair  daughters should stand forth and plead with the Lamanites that they would not slay them” (v. 13).  I was thinking about this, and wondered, “What does  fair  mean”. Does it mean fair-skinned? Does it mean beautiful (as v. 14 goes on to imply)? Does it mean without blemishes? Does it mean ethically equal?  Why are we always so quick to assume it means white skin?

      During the Sacrament hymn today, the priests took longer to prepare the bread than it took for the rest of the congregation to sings three hymns of the Sacrament hymn. Naturally, nearly the entire congregation put their books away after the third verse. However, since the priests were still preparing the bread, the chorister decided to sing the last two verses, which are usually unsung.  The chorister, however, never gave any indication that she wasn’t going to conduct the last two verses, which led me to have two questions.  1. Why are members of the church so opposed to singing that they sing as few verses as possible? 2. Why do members of the church not pay attention to the chorister to see if she is going to sit down or continue to lead music?

      Today’s Annie’s Mailbox  urlLink featured  a woman writing in distraught about her son’s wedding. It is obvious her son has fallen in love with a Mormon girl, become converted and they are getting married in the LDS temple.  Naturally, she is disappointed she can’t attend the temple to see her son married. The kicker is that the bride’s father said that the reception would be for immediate family only. So not only are all of the groom’s cousins, grandparents, and friends not allowed to see him get married, they can’t even come to his reception. His brothers apparently refuse to come to the reception since they cannot come to the temple.  I have no problem with family and friends who are not members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints not being able to attend the wedding at the temple. After all, many of my friends and family could not come to ours. However, the bride’s father went a little overboard with respect to the reception. He should have at least considered that since many people won’t be able to attend the wedding, the reception would be the only opportunity for them to participate in this once-in-a-lifetime event.  I was a little perturbed by the response of Kathy Mitchell and Marcy Sugar.   You cannot reason with someone whose religious beliefs preclude associating with anyone who thinks differently. Why not host a separate reception for the couple, inviting whomever you wish, perhaps when they return from their honeymoon? Many parents do this for children who elope, and we think it is a lovely way to include those who could not be at the ceremony.   So, are they saying we are unreasonable? Do they think our beliefs preclude us from associating with anyone who thinks differently; that we are all mindless drones who think the same? No wonder people think we’re a cult.

      On a mailing list I am on, a fellow list member  urlLink asked  for everyone to put out what misunderstandings are common in the Church. Some of the usual ones were mentioned (infallibility of our leaders, unchanging church, etc), but  urlLink one thing  someone said caught my eye. Mostly because I’ve been contemplating this very thing.   If something  bad  happens to  me , it is because God is testing me. If something  good  happens to  me , it is because I am righteous. If something  bad  happens to  you , it is because God is chastising you. If something  good  happens to  you , it is because you are living right.   I am not sure how many members believe this, but I have definitely heard these sort of thoughts expressed (though not all at once as above).  Why do we feel this way? Better yet, how can we tell the difference between chastisement and testing?

      The Chicago Tribune  urlLink reported  on Sunday’s Priesthood broadcast.   Hinckley said of tattoos, "If you have ever considered such an idea, pause and ask the Lord about it," adding that the human body is a temple of God. "How can any boy who blesses or passes the sacrament have a tattoo?"   How does having a tattoo affect the administration of the sacrament? Does an adult with a tattoo unable to pass the sacrament? What about a convert who already had a tattoo?  Technically, I have a tattoo. A classmate stabbed me with a pen back in 1988 and the ink has remained ever since. Can I not pass the sacramenet?

      Hudson’s Bay Company, likely the oldest company in Canada having been in operation sin 1670, is working to eradicated sweatshop conditions internationally. George Heller, its CEO, met Wednesday with retail executives from around the world to address the problem.   Mr. Heller says the sweatshop file was one he couldn't let go of, partly because no matter how much his company tried to verify and correct conditions at overseas factories, it never was enough. He was constantly open to criticism by human rights groups of abusing cheap labour to lower his prices. That got him to thinking that only global efforts in monitoring factory working conditions were going to make a dent.   Last June, Mr. Heller addressed a United Nations committee in New York, urging world retailers to set up an independent group to ensure they make their products following basic principles of worker and human rights.   Now why can’t  urlLink other companies  do it like this?

      Wal-Mart recently introduced a pilot programme in some of its stores in the Dallas, Texas, area. The programme was to introduce radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags, which unlike bar codes can be read from a distance without a direct line of sight. Of course this would mean an improvement on theft control, product recalling and inventory stocks.  However, in order for this technology to be used, its suppliers need to replace the bar codes on its products with RFID tags. Since Wal-Mart has enough financial power to make up  urlLink 2% of the USA’s GDP , if they want a supplier to introduce a new technology, the supplier introduces it or Wal-Mart gets a new supplier that will.   Since Wal-Mart announced the pilot program's January deadline for its top 100 suppliers, an additional 37 suppliers volunteered to meet the deadline...  Wal-Mart aims to be using the technology with all of its domestic suppliers by 2006. International rollout will begin some time next year...   I’m usually one for embracing technology, but not at any cost. I am bothered that a single company can influence hundreds of other countries to fundamentally change the way they do business. It’s one thing to have a panel of industry experts and leaders come together and implement standards in business practices, but having a single company strong-arm everyone else is quite another.

      The Deseret News ran  urlLink a story  today about a woman who finally received her high school diploma at 38 years of age. She had run away from home when she was seventeen. She was pregnant at the time and eventually gave up her son because she couldn’t’ care for him. She eventually became involved in drugs and prostitution. She was also the target of racial discrimination at school and church before she ran away.  The thing that really got me though was:   School stopped being a priority, and at 17 she was pregnant and flunking. She finally had a talk with her mom about a friend who had gotten pregnant and didn't know what to do. Her mother told Chase that if she herself ever got pregnant she would be kicked out.   Ah, the love of a parent.

      An LDS couple in Utah  urlLink aborted their baby yesterday .  Apparently, the baby’s internal organs were growing outside of the body. Obviously, there was no hope for this baby. Aborting a baby like this is not the same thing as aborting a baby with Down’s syndrome.  The thing about it though is that they could not go to the hospital. If any hospital staff performed the procedure, they would be considered criminals under a new Utah law. This law makes it illegal for state-funded medical institutions to perform abortions in pregnancies that are not a result of rape or incest or do not threaten the mother’s life.  This baby fit neither of those three.

      While preparing for my home teaching message that I had last night, I came across a quote by President Gordon B. Hinckley that created some questions in my mind. The quote was actually used this past general conference by Bishop Keith B. McMullin in the Saturday afternoon session.   It is the privilege, it is the opportunity, it is the obligation of every Latter-day Saint to gain for himself or herself a certain knowledge...that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, the Redeemer of all mankind.   My question is, why is it an obligation? I understand why have a privilege to gain this knowledge or an opportunity, but why are we obligated to gain this knowledge?   That testimony...is the most precious possession that any of us can hold.   Why is it the most precious possession? Why is this testimony more precious than our children are? Why is it more precious than the love our spouses have for us?   ...whenever a man has a true witness in his heart of the living reality of the Lord Jesus Christ all else will come together as it should.   How does having a true witness of the reality of Jesus make everything else in our lives come together?

      The Calgary Flames is now in the finals. They have a chance at their second cup and Canada’s first in 10 years.  Iginla made his tenth goal of the playoffs in the first period, bringing he score 1-0. Gelinas took a sweet pass from Conroy and scored in the second off a faceoff to bring the Flames to a 2-0 lead. Three minutes later, San Jose scored and made it look like they were on their way back.  The kicker though was the last goal that counted for the Calgary Flames. With only a few seconds left in the game, San Jose’s Korolyuk tried passing from behind the Calgary Flames net to a teammate in an effort to hopefully tie the game and bring it into overtime. However, no on was where he passed it, so the puck flew down the ice. Since San Jose was losing, their goalie was pulled to give them a one-man advantage. With the goalie gone, the puck slid nicely into an open net with only one second left in the game.  The game ended 3-1 for the Calgary Flames.

She is coming to talk about the Alberta Government’s Bill 206. The Bill allows police officers to seize vehicles of johns.

There is something piercing of reading about a person emerging from the depths of hell to achieve what normally would be an obscure accomplishment.

She is coming to talk about the Alberta Government’s Bill 206. The Bill allows police officers to seize vehicles of johns. Hudson thinks this is a Band-Aid solution to a much bigger problem of addiction, poverty and psychological problems.  After reading the announcement, I decided to do a search of Elizabeth Hudson. I came across  urlLink an archived article  from Vancouver’s  Westender . It is an interview where Elizabeth Hudson discusses her viewpoints on different issues. One response stuck out in my mind.   The day that I got voted president of my son's preschool, that's the day I knew I'd passed. I'd made it. I'd done it.   There is something piercing of reading about a person emerging from the depths of hell to achieve what normally would be an obscure accomplishment.

      I forgot to blog on this when it came up last month, but a  urlLink post  at Dave’s Mormon Inquiry reminded me of it.   But the biggest blow to the music industry came when [Federal Court] Judge [Konrad] von Finckenstein addressed the broader question of whether there was evidence of a legal violation that would justify revealing the private identities of Internet users. He concluded that sharing music files doesn't constitute copyright infringement at all.   Judge von Kinckenstein  urlLink went on to say  that having music files in a shared directory does not constitute file distribution. He clarified that file distribution consists of such things as sending the files to others or advertising that you have files available. In other words, your actions need to be aggressive, not passive.  It seems, in Canada, at least, it is not illegal to download music.

      Looks like missionaries are  urlLink newsworthy .   Elder Wilson and his friend, both missionaries with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, were surprised how quickly [gas] prices have risen.  "I just looked at the sign and saw 93.3 cents a litre and said, 'Whoa, when did it go up that high?'"   Welcome to Canada.

      While continuing in my read of Abinadi’s sermon to King Noah and his priests I came across his citation of what is now Isaiah 53. In particular, verse nine stuck out to me.   And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death…   This got me thinking of how our life is here on earth. Often we strive so hard not just to support our families, but to be affluent. We often prejudge people for their actions as well.  When it comes down to the end,however, every one of us—poor and rich, wicked and righteous—will be rotting, maggot-infested flesh. If we’re all going to be the same at the end, why can we all not be the same now?

      Speaking of  urlLink Abinadi and the Ten Commandments , he mentions the following: Honor thy father and thy mother, that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee. What does this mean exactly? What does it mean to honour our parents? Is it more than just obeying? If we do honour them, what does it mean that our days will be long? Does it mean we will live a long time?

      Calgary Flames won again. I was getting worried with San Jose winning the last games; I thought Calgary’s Cinderella streak was over.  Iginla, Nilson and Conroy led the Flames into a 3-2 series lead with each scoring a goal against the scoreless San Jose Sharks.  They may have a chance now. This is the Calgary Flames’ first time in the playoffs in fifteen years. It has been just as long since they won their only Stanley Cup. Maybe it is time.

      I was reading Abinadi’s opening admonitions to King Noah and his priests and saw something interesting when he begins talking about the Ten Commandments. Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing in heaven above, or things which are in the earth beneath. (Mosiah 12:36)   We have all seen this before. The thing that stuck out to me is the phrase “Thou shalt not  make  unto thee any graven image”. I have heard often that sometimes we put money or a job before the Lord and that it can be construed as idolatry, or worship of graven images. But Abinadi only states that we should not  make  such things.  Perhaps this is so closely tied to the previous commandment that there was no need for further clarification. Thou shalt have no other God before me.

      We received a new bishop yesterday. After 12 years of serving in a bishopric, Bishop Ron Tanner was released. His youngest son was only four when he was first called as a counsellor in the bishopric. He was a good bishop. He was insightful and always had a good heart. It will be sad to see him go.  Bishop Steve Kutanzi was taken out of his calling in the high council to become the new bishop. His youngest son is in my deacons quorum. He requested Bishop Tanner’s second counsellor, Craig Whitehead, as his first counsellor and our ward mission leader, Chris Bennett, as his second counsellor. Chris is a year older than I am, and this is his second bishopric.  I knew the change was coming, but I expected it to be after the summer. I did not expect Bishop Kutanzi to be called, but the Lord knows what He is doing. It will be interesting to see what kind of a bishop he is. All the bishops we have had thus far have been different from each other.

      Last week, while I was doing dishes, Sinéad came up to me and told me of an experience she had with which she was terribly concerned.  urlLink Magic School Bus , which happens to be her favourite show, apparently had been cancelled from the  urlLink CBC Kids  line-up.  As a result, she decided it warranted a letter to  urlLink CBC . My name is Sinéad and I am 5 years old and I love CBC Kids but I wish you would please put back Magic School Bus because it is my favourite show in the whole world. Thank you. What a good little liberal.

      The first counsellor in the bishopric phoned me last night and asked me to give a talk next week. The topic is the restoration of the Aaronic Priesthood.  The problem is that I do not want to give a typical recitation of John the Baptist’s appearance to Joseph smith and Oliver Cowdery on the banks of the Susquehanna River. I want to do something different, something that will uplift and improve the congregation.  If you were asked to give a talk on the restoration of the Aaronic Priesthood, what approach would you take?

      Sinéad performed in very first main stage ballet production. The piece was Coppélia, a ballet about a dollmaker’s doll who comes to life. The premiere of the ballet first occurred on 25 May 1870 at the Paris Opera with music by Leo Delibes and choreography by Arthur Saint-Léon. Sinéad played one of the Sparkly Rainbow Dolls.  Naturally, we were excited when she came on stage. She did a good job.

      The Métis Nation of Alberta phoned last week and told me they could not find any proof of Métis lineage. I was not surprised; I gave up hope of being able to receive status as Métis long ago. I have both Cree and French heritage. Twenty years ago, that would have been enough to be declared Métis.  Understandably, the  urlLink Métis National Council  has since established  urlLink a firm definition  of the term Métis partly to help the public realise the Métis are a distinct people with a distinct culture. They also did it partly to discourage just any person claiming Métis status. Métis means a person who self-identifies as Métis, is of historic Métis Nation Ancestry, is distinct from other Aboriginal Peoples and is accepted by the Métis Nation. I once self-identified as Métis. I was attracted to their music, their dancing, their language, their history and their cuisine. Now, I’m distancing myself from it all.  I try to be content in being a half breed.

      The Daily Herald ran  urlLink an article  today about organ donors. The article starts out discussing an LDS family. The father, when asked if he wanted to donate his daughter’s organs, said he opposed organ donations partly because he didn’t want to imagine his daughter disfigured body, but partly because he thought it was against Church policy.  It’s not, but it brings up an interesting thought. Would you donate your organs if they were healthy? What about considering cremation instead of burial?

      Or, at least,  urlLink they will be .  It turns out that customers—or should we read shareholders—have "commonly requested...image ads". So, being the nice new public company they are, they comply.  One of the reasons I enjoy Google is the lack of items competing for my attention. When I use a search engine, I am looking for websites, not products.  How long will it be before the implement pop-up ads? Or worse, use the thousands of AdWords ads on websites everywhere to deliver banner ads?

      The Church has released a  urlLink new website for LDS music .  It included a Macromedia Flash based music player that allows you to choose songs with parts, words, or just music. You can print songs, change keys, change tempo, and get extra information about the song.  You can also download MP3 versions of the hymns and Primary songs, submit your own music, learn how to lead music and learn basic music notation.  Looks like a pretty cool resource.

      Charles Mix, who is nearly 50, was found on the lawn of a Richfield, UT, meetinghouse last year eating hamburgers with a five-year-old girl he had kidnapped and molested. The judge decided to give him a  urlLink sentence of 350 years .  No, that is the right figure, three hundred fifty years. Granted, I agree what he did is horrendous, and I am no legal expert, but what is the point? Why give him such a long term? Would a 40 or 50-year-old term not suffice? Either way, he would be dead before finishing his sentence.  I do believe I have never heard of other child molesters and kidnappers getting the same sentences.

      Ever since I came across  urlLink 1 Ne 19:10 , I’ve wished I could read the words of Zenos, Zenock and Neum. While reading scriptures this morning with Mary, I realised that we do have some of their words.  Excerpts from the words of Zenos can be found in  urlLink Jacob 5  and  urlLink Alma 33:4-11,13 . Some of Zenock’s words can be found in  urlLink Alma 33:16 . Summaries of the words of Zenos, Zenock and Neum can also be found in  urlLink 1 Ne 19:10,12,16 ;  urlLink Alma 34:7 ;  urlLink Hel 8:19-20 ;  urlLink Hel 15:11 ; and  urlLink 3 Ne 10:15-16 .One must assume that these words were taken from the brass plates Nephi obtained from Laban. Although, I do find it interesting that in Hel 15:11, Zenos is said to have prophesied of the restoration of the Lamanites. Why would he make such a prophecy if he had never been in the New World?  What is also interesting is that the Book of Mormon contains excerpts from more famous ancient prophets like  urlLink Joseph  and his father  urlLink Jacob  and even the words of  urlLink angels .  It’s amazing what you learn when you pay attention to the names of the speakers.

      I made some changes to The Blog.  I’ve incorporated both Blogger comments and Haloscan comments. The immediate benefit to this is that the Haloscan comments I had before switching to the new system are no longer gone. If you hate pop-up windows, prefer comments on the same page as the post or have a Blogger login, I recommend using the Blogger comments. If you prefer not having to register with Blogger, try the Haloscan comments. Be forewarned that once Blogger offers a way to import comments from other systems, the Haloscan comments will be gone. ;-)  Another feature I added is on the month pages. Each month page now has all the post titles on the right hand side. Since some months can have as many as 150 posts (given my current rate of posting), this will be an easy way to jump to a specific post.

      Members of the Church in Southbury, Connecticut, participated with congregations of many other local faiths in the annual AmeriCares HomeFront day. Each year on the first Saturday in May, teams come together in more than 100 towns and cities across Connecticut and eastern New York State, working to make homes safe, warm and dry.  In Southbury, volunteers representing most of the town's faith communities gathered in the early morning and worked throughout the day, repairing a modest, three-bedroom home belonging to a single mother with three children.

      The Calgary Flames beat the San Jose Sharks tonight. They now lead the Western Conference finals two games to none. Funny thing is that both games were played in San Jose.  I was only able to watch the last 15 minutes of the third period, but it was enough to see Nieminen and Gelinas score 4 seconds apart from each other to clinch the game at 4-1.  I only wish I could have seen Nilson make his record-breaking goal for Calgary 20 seconds into the game.

      Canada has recently seen a hike in gasoline prices that has attained as high a prcies as more than a dollar per litre. Many critics of oil companies suggest that the companies are out to gouge the consumer. Dane Baily, Vice-President of  urlLink Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers  was quoted on  urlLink CTV News  tonight (00:09:25.26) as asking, “Why would we move our prices in a way that frustrates our customers?”  Let see. Because you can? Gas stations have this practice that if one company raises prices all the other stations in the area/city follow suit. This isn’t like shopping for pork or a new coat. If you don’t like the price, tough; it’ll be the same everywhere else.  A better question would be, “why wouldn’t we move our prices in a way that frustrates our customers”. What possible incentive is there for oil companies not to raise their prices at will?

      Well I guess they are right.

But as I said, I do have many thoughts and opinions, mainly regarding my family, parenting, birthing, natural living and the Gospel of Jesus Christ. So one of these days I will get around to writing about them. Right now I have to make supper and attend to my children.

      The Baron brought up a  urlLink good point , as usual, about the breaking of covenants. He brings up the premise that God will be more concerned that we willingly broke a covenant/a commandment than He will be regarding in which church we made the covenant or learnt of the commandment. For example, he illustrates that a Catholic who uses birth control knowing it is against Catholic beliefs will be held similarly accountable as a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints who smokes despite knowing that our church teaches against it.  This point brings up an interesting thought. Many people in and out of the Church maintain that we believe only those who are members of the Church will enter into celestial glory.  Why is that? Many people have lived on the earth who obviously never joined the Church yet will gain exaltation. Adam, Moses, Noah, Jeremiah, Elijah, Peter, Paul and Jesus are all examples.  If membership in the Church is not a requirement, then it must be something else. My bets are on the commandments and, as The Baron pointed out, the covenants we make.

      The City of Lethbridge released their  urlLink new website  today. While it is an improvement on the last one, there are some issues I have with it.   They made the common mistake of not declaring a background colour. Therefore, those with browsers not using white as a default background colour will not see the intended white as the pages’ background.   Too much information is tied up in PDFs. There is no reason why most of them cannot be converted into HTML. It’s particularly frustrating for those whose systems, for whatever reason, take forever to load up Acrobat  Too many links open up brand new windows. If I want a new window, I will open a new window.   Every page has /home/ as part of the URL. Why do people do this? It makes absolutely no sense and is not intuitive at all to users trying to browse via the URL.   It is 2004. There is no longer any excuse why tables should still be used as layout or why images should be used to represent text. For that matter, there should be no need to have to create a separate printable page. Why would someone want to double their website size just to be able to provide printable pages, when standards-compliant, CSS based code can do the same thing with the browser’s print button?   The website is not very usable on a PDA which really sucks since I have been waiting for a long time to be able to have bus schedules on my PDA that do not require horizontal scrolling.   It’s a big improvement, but it certainly has a long way to go. Especially considering it’s stuck in a mid-90s design mindset.

      Tried going for a swim today, but after a five day weekend and three weeks of battling a lingering cold, I didn't get much out of it. Unless of course, you count the light-headedness, nausea and diarrhoea. :-)  I will try not to push myself so much tomorrow.

      Blogger made some changes and in the process made it too tempting for me not to change my template. In the process, I “lost” all former comments. I still have them, but Haloscan requires a person to pay money before one can export them and Blogger has no way to import old comments yet. Sorry about that.  The plus side is that there are no more popup windows for comments and each post has its own page now. This is cool for search engine entries and for better reading of comments.  Besides, it even looks cool. :-)

      In Sacrament today, one of the speakers cited examples of prominent mothers who we should use as the ideal. One of the persons he mentioned was Heavenly Mother.  How did this doctrine/belief come about? There doesn’t seem to be any scriptural evidence regarding it—nothing specific anyhow. Is the only basis for our belief in a mother in heaven solely based on the premise that since God is our father, there must be a mother?

      While reading the final chapter of King Benjamin’s address today, I came across something quite interesting. And now, because of the covenant which ye have made ye shall be called the children of Christ, his sons, and his daughters; for behold, this day he hath spiritually begotten you; for ye say that your hearts are changed through faith on his name; therefore, ye are born of him and have become his sons and his daughters. (Mosiah 5:7) Up until this point, it was my impression that it was through baptism that we became the children of Christ and he became our father. Now it seems that all that is required is the covenant. This goes hand-in-hand with the idea that remission of sins does not come solely from baptism, but rather from a process that begins with faith in Jesus and ends with the baptism of fire (the Holy Spirit).  I wonder then, what significance does baptism hold. Is it is simply symbolic. Is it nothing more than reminding us of the old life we leave behind and the new one we take upon ourselves? Is it nothing more than a way to show the world that we have entered into a covenant to serve Him?

      Something King Benjamin said stuck out while reading my scriptures just now. And I would that ye should remember, that whosoever among you borroweth of his neighbor should return the thing that he borroweth, according as he doth agree, or else thou shalt commit sin…(Mosiah 4:28) This reminded me of a  urlLink Salt Lake Tribune article  that stated: The American Bankruptcy Institute, a nonprofit organization that tracks bankruptcies nationwide, lists Utah as the leading state in the number of bankruptcies per household. For the year ended Dec. 31, 2002, one in 38 Utah households sought some form of bankruptcy protection. By another measure, Utah was fourth behind Missouri, Indiana and Nevada with 616 bankruptcy filings for every 100,000 residents. I am not naïve enough to assume that all of those individuals are members of the Church, but since a large percentage of Utahns are members, it is easy to assume that many of those filed for bankruptcy are also members. Why then do they—and those members outside of Utah who file bankruptcy—not follow King Benjamin’s counsel?

      Someone came to our blog yesterday from Google again. This time the searched for the term “siever blog”. Naturally, we came up first.  It was someone from the Calgary area. I just can’t figure out who it was. Was s/he  looking for my blog? Was s/he looking for the blog of someone else named “siever”? Had s/he seen my blog before but couldn’t remember how to get there? Did someone tell them her/him about it but didn’t give her/him a URL? Oh, the questions.  Enough with the narcissism. I’m actually surprised they remembered how to spell my last name.

      While reading my scriptures this afternoon—I am on vacation after all—I came across something that made me ponder. ...I would that ye should remember, and always retain in remembrance, the greatness of God, and your own nothingness, and his goodness and long-suffering towards you, unworthy creatures, and humble yourselves even in the depths of humility...And…if ye do this ye shall always rejoice, and be filled with the love of God, and always retain a remission of your sins; and ye shall grow in the knowledge of the glory of him that created you, or in the knowledge of that which is just and true. (Mosiah 4:11-12) Is this the only way to be filled with the love of God grow in the knowledge of His glory? Is the only way is to realise that we are nothing, that we mean nothing; that we are inherently unworthy?  If what King Benjamin says is literal, how do we get to that level of humility? How do we get to the point where we realise we are unworthy and we are nothing? How do we get to the point where we can remember it?  For that matter, to what does “nothingness” refer? What about us is nothing? The meaning of our life? Our purpose on earth? Something else?

      A special education teacher who doubled as a basketball coach in a New Jersey school issued a “ urlLink Crybaby Award ” to a thirteen-year-old player at a season end players’ banquet. The boy was humiliated in front of dozens of teammates and their parents.  What was this teacher thinking? Did he think an emotionally unstable, hormonally charged teenager would take the public criticism in good humour? Did he think this was going to be constructive in making the student a more productive player?  Sure bring new meaning to “special education”.

      Dr. Janice Shaw Crouse wrote a  urlLink recent article  in Meridian about the awful effects feminism has had on today’s society. In particular, she warns of the erosion it has introduced into traditional families.  She starts the article by showing how Aryanism and communism have been the reason for the destruction of millions of Jews, Kuraks, Ukrainians, Chinese and Cambodians. While I agree with the premise that Aryanism consists of racist principles, I have to disagree with Dr. Shaw Crouse’s presumption that communism was the reason for the others dying. Communism itself was not responsible; it was the corrupt leaders hiding behind the guise of communism. It is no different from a corrupt leader killing innocent citizens of another country under the guise of capitalism and democracy. Democracy and capitalism are not to blame, but rather the corrupt leader. For feminist thinkers, traditional marriage is the ultimate oppressor of women... I do not agree with this absolute declaration. It is true that some feminists view marriage and even sex as oppressors of women, but it is only some. I know quite a number of feminists who are married and enjoy healthy, monogamous relationships. The sad part is that this half-truth is what stands at the heart of her article. …they declared that abortion on demand is a basic human right…they defend the 45 million murders of unborn lives by abortionists... This is one thought that I have heard many times; it really shows a person’s ignorance. If there’s one thing I’ve learned from working in a technology department in a university is that a PhD is not a sign of absolute knowledge or intelligence. Nevertheless, why is it that people always equate pro-choice activists with abortionists? Someone can support a freedom to perform an action without supporting the action itself. Feminists demand that childcare arrangements be federally funded so that the rearing of children can be turned over to childcare providers and thus not be burdensome or interfere with a woman's career aspirations. What would Dr. Shaw Crouse suggest widowed and divorced mothers do? Does she suggest they stay at home and live off welfare? Or does she think that these already underpaid working mothers fork over childcare costs from their grocery funds? Feminists are determined to mainstream lesbian and homosexual lifestyles. Huh? How is someone who supports equality for women and women’s right automatically associated with mainstreaming homosexual lifestyles? Sure, I accept that some feminists are lesbian, but many (if not more) are heterosexual. This statement makes absolutely no sense.  Dr. Shaw Crouse goes on to bring forth numerous statistics to prove her hypothesis. Unfortunately, the statistics are quite biased. For example, she claims, “More than 50 million women lived alone at the end of the 20th century”. How many men live alone? How many of the women who live alone are feminists? What are the ages of these 50 million women? Does it include 18-year-old college students? Does it include 80-year-old widows? Does it include 40-year-old divorcees?  Feminism has given women the right to vote; women (married or single) the right to work; women the right to be free from sexual harassment. It has provided women with much more liberation than any other principle has.  As I said previously concerning communism, feminism isn’t the cause of all the calamities she claims it is; rather corrupt feminists are.

      Over at  urlLink By Common Consent , Dave throws out the idea of a  urlLink cruise ship temple . The premise is that the temple would be set up on a cruise ship and when it docks at international ports, local members could visit. Brings a completely new meaning to “taking the temple to the members”.  Shortly after President Hinckley  urlLink announced the newer small temples , I remember someone putting forth the same idea on  urlLink WW-LDS . If I remember correctly, I do not think I agreed with it then. I am not sure I agree with it now. The idea has an air of disrespectfulness.  Mind you, I think Dave’s comment was somewhat tongue-in-cheek. The old WW-LDS post wasn’t.

      Apparently, a recent Church News article (24 April 2004) reported that a sixth quorum of the Seventy is to be organised. It was created by splitting the Fifth Quorum of the Seventy (US & Canada). The Fifth Quorum will now be comprised of North America Northwest, Idaho, Utah North, Utah Salt Lake City, Utah South and North America West areas. The new quorum will consist of the North America Central, North America East, North America Northeast, North America Southeast and North America Southwest areas. Incidentally, there are now more than 260 Area Authority Seventies spread through the six quorums.  It seems another Canadian Area Authority Seventy was called to take the place of Blair Bennett (whose son lives in our ward) of Edmonton.  "Terrence C. Smith, 56, Raymond, Alberta; medical director, Raymond Care Centre; gospel doctrine teacher in the Raymond 1st Ward; former stake president, high councilor and bishop. Married Rita Irene Regehr; eight children."  In addition, not to be one who feeds the rumour mill, but someone on a mailing list to which I subscribed commented that later this year the North America area presidencies will be dissolved. One other person confirmed a letter has been sent from the First presidency to local leaders outlining this. Can anyone verify this? FWIW, the Church News article above stated, in part: [Elder Earl C. Tingey] said 13 Area Authority Seventies will serve in area presidencies in international areas starting in August.

      Jim, the bus driver, told me today that  urlLink LA Transit  has decided to implement a downtown-university shuttle service. Currently two buses run a forty-minute round-trip service from downtown to the U of L, around the Westside, and from the U of L back downtown. On the Westside, both buses run virtually different routes. Their downtown trip is identical however. I have maintained for years that it made absolutely no sense whatsoever to have two buses going downtown.  What it means now is that there will be three buses (or perhaps two since 20-30 minutes will be shaved off the trip downtown) servicing just the Westside with a dedicated rout downtown. It also means that there will now be three or four routes that no longer go downtown unnecessarily (the LINK, #7, #8, and perhaps #10).  First the LA transit implements the LINK, providing bi-directional, cross-route service, and now their eliminating duplication of routes. What are they trying to prove? That they are trying to be efficient? That Lethbridge is not just a Podunk city?  Now, if they could just provide an express route from the U of L to the College.

After this weekend, we were bumped to 186. The 186 isn't even our main page; it's a page on one of our sub-sites.  I wish I knew what was going on. If nothing else, it just goes to show that the keywords meta tag means absolutely nothing when it comes to placement in Goggle.

      While reading my scriptures this morning, I came across something interesting in King Benjamin’s address. It is at this point that he is relating the words spoken to him by an angel. For behold, the time cometh, and is not far distant, that with power, the Lord Omnipotent who reigneth, who was, and is from all eternity to all eternity, shall come down from heaven among the children of men, and shall dwell in a tabernacle of clay… (Mosiah 3:5) What I found interesting about this is how the angel says Jesus would dwell in a tabernacle of clay. Is this to be taken literally? Was the Saviour’s body really made out of clay, or does “clay” mean something different?  What is even more interesting is that King Benjamin said the following in the previous chapter: Ye cannot say that ye are even as much as the dust of the earth; yet ye were created of the dust of the earth… (Mosiah 2:25) Is King Benjamin saying we were literally created of the dust of the earth rather than in an embryonic state? Does “dust” refer to something different?  And what is the most interesting is when we compare these two verses (and others) to Genesis 2:7. And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.

      I held my first father’s interview today. Sinéad is five and I thought it would be a good time to start. She has a relatively busy life—especially with enrolling in grade one this September and having a ballet recital next Saturday—and always has questions about life and the gospel.  I didn’t have father’s interviews growing up (or at least not often enough to remember any), so I didn’t have anything to use as a guide. I decided to start with her saying a prayer. Then I asked her to tell me what was happening in here life. She told me about how she loves to draw, and her ballet recital and trying to be kind to her little brother.  I sensed this as a way to offer some counsel. I asked her in what ways she was trying to be kinder. She responded by giving a recent example when he was crying for one reason or another and she comforted him. She also said she would try not to hit him anymore. I then asked her how that shows kindness. She responded by saying it shows love to her brother and that she is being an example to him.  I asked her if she had any questions about the gospel and the only thing she asked was how the Church started. We happened to listen to the dramatised church history tapes today, so I used them to give a basic understanding of how the church started. We talked also how the Church was started 174 years ago and that next year will be Joseph Smith’s 200th birthday.  Then I closed with a prayer.  Pretty harmless. I’ll get better over time.

      When Mary and I were having companion scripture study last night, I came across a verse attributed to Korihor. Ye say that this people is a guilty and a fallen people, because of the transgression of a parent. Behold, I say that a child is not guilty because of its parents. (Alma 30:25) Korihor's statement was found in the midst of others proclaiming the absence of Christ, accusing the Church of keeping the people in bondage, and claiming the ordinances to be foolish. This would then give one the impression that the above statement made by Korihor is negative.  Yet, isn’t that what we believe today? A child isn’t guilty because of his/her parents; that s/he takes responsibility for his/her own actions? On the other hand, some in the world suggest that often our actions can be a result of our upbringing.  So, what is Korihor saying? Why did Mormon include this statement?

      I left for Vancouver today. The flight was nice since I had only enough time to disembark from the plane from Lethbridge and board the plane for Vancouver. When I arrived in Vancouver, I stopped off at the bathroom and had a drink from a fountain. By the time I arrived at the baggage claim, my suitcase was waiting on the carousel, and my dad had just arrived to pick me up. You couldn’t ask for better timing on a trip.   Apparently, Sinéad misses me dearly and has cried a few times since I left. Regan still does not comprehend the idea of me being gone for a few days. He thinks they are going back to the airport to pick me up soon.  It’s nice to see my family again. I saw my newest niece today for the first time in person. She sure looks like her dad, Jody.  It sure is humid and I’ve had a bit of a sweat since I left the airport. I’ll get used to it though.

      I am flying out to Vancouver tomorrow for some training on  urlLink Macromedia ColdFusion  advanced development. The training is actually Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, and I will be coming home on Canada Day.   I had a choice to go to either Vancouver or Toronto. While I have never been to Toronto and was tempted to pick that one, I decided to go to Vancouver. I am staying with my parents, so the University of Lethbridge will not need to pay for my accommodations or meals. They are paying for the training and airfare. They will also reimburse me for the twenty bucks I spend on the bus and  urlLink SkyTrain  rides. This way, our Technology Services department in the  urlLink Faculty of Management  will be able to afford to send someone else on training with the money they saved on accommodations and meals.  I am not sure how often I will be able to post, so feel free to check back often and still go through some old posts.  My family will sure miss me since this will be the longest we have been apart. Naturally, I will miss them, too.

      Given the flurry this month in some of the blogs and portfolio sites I visit about doing redesigns, I thought I would go for yet another redesign of my portfolio site.   urlLink Version 7 of Kim Siever’s Portfolio  not only looks better, it is more semantical and there is less code than the previous version. As well, I’ve also added more screenshots of  urlLink websites  I’ve done, listed my  urlLink drama work , included some  urlLink poster work  I did and put up some past  urlLink logo designs .  One other feature I put together was a small  urlLink collection of articles  I’ve written for website design. There are two now, but I hope to put together more over the next little while. In particular, I submitted my third article to a well-known online magazine for website designers. If it is published, I’ll include a link there as well.  I have a couple more minor tweaks first, and a couple more minor things to add, but it is up now.  I hope that this will satisfy my redesign craving for a while.

Disappointingly, they have decided to abandon development of their own reader in favour of  urlLink MarkMyScriptures  and  urlLink Yanceyware . While I am excited the out of date section has been updated, I was looking forward to the Church putting out their own, updated reader with better features than MMS and YW provide. Ironically, the new Handheld Library page does not include files for the scriptures.  Oh well.

      I have a beard.  Well, ok. It is a goatee. However, this past winter, I let all my facial hair free to grow, as it desired. With all the talk in the Bloggernacle about beard growing, I thought I’d chime in with an experience.  In my stake, there is an unwritten, vague, widely interpreted rule regarding beards. Some bishops have interpreted it to mean a man cannot hold a calling if he has a beard. Some has have interpreted into to mean a man cannot hold a priesthood leadership position (e.g. elders quorum president, high priest group leader) if he has a beard.  Nevertheless, at the beginning of the year, the ward clerk in one of the wards asked about my beard in the context of this non-specific rule. I told him no one has asked me to shave it, so I see no reason to. He then asked me if I would shave upon being requested to do so.  I sit here thinking now about the whole issue. I can understand how drinking coffee, having casual extra-marital sex, stealing a car or promoting the pleasantries of plural marriage might bring to mind disobedience to God’s laws. However, how does not shaving a beard when a local policy suggests to amounts to the same thing?  One might suggest that not doing so is not being obedient to the words of the leaders. Supposedly, this is the same thing as God’s laws since that is how church members interpret  urlLink D&C 1:38 . I have to wonder then if the brethren asked me to pick my nose regularly and I did not, if I would be considered a heretic. If the brethren asked me to exchange my black, wingtip oxfords for a pair of oxblood, cap-toes and I did not—yeah, right, of course I would—if I would be considered disobedient?  Honestly, what is the big deal? How did having a beard come to be so controversial as to be outlawed in the temple and the cause of dismissal from callings?

      Many Christians outside of Mormonism claim we, as members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, are not Christian. It is a convenient way for them to dismiss what we believe and to avoid having to admit the possibility of any truth in our message or beliefs.    Professing belief in Jesus as Christ or following the religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus. ( The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition )   Despite the fact that we proscribe to the logical definition of “Christian”, they insist that we follow a different Christ and thus are not Christian.  The Jesus I follow was born to Mary in Bethlehem. He is the Son of God. He performed countless miracles during his ministry. He taught that we should avoid acts of retribution and replace them with acts of generosity and forgiveness. He died on the cross at Calvary. He suffered in the Garden of Gethsemane. He rose from the dead on the third day.  Do other Christians believe something different from this? Does at mentioned above not suggest to the sane, intelligent reader that one who believes in such is indeed Christian? Even is s/he is a Mormon?

      There is  urlLink a post  over at T&S discussing a newly found tablet. I have no problems with that, but I do have a question regarding the use of the term "pre-existence" in the post title. Since I don't want to detract from the nature of the conversation over there, I thought I'd post here.  I don't want to come across as a nitpicker, but doesn't "pre-existence" imply "before existence". Since we existed as spirits before coming to earth and as intelligences before being created as spirits, to what does the term "pre-existence" refer?

      Since I am going to be riding to work every day  urlLink starting  in two weeks, I decided to exchange my swim schedule for a stationary bike workout this morning. I will be gone to Vancouver all next week, so I am going to try fitting in a bike workout each day this week. I am also pushing myself hard to make sure my legs are in somewhat good enough shape for the commute.  Anyhow, while I was getting ready for the shower and taking off my sweaty garments, I was reminded of something. Some people say that garments are too sacred to wear while doing a sweaty workout. Others say that they are too sacred to leave them off for the hour you are working out.  What does everyone else think?

      I decided that I am going to exchange my morning transit commute with a bike ride across the Old Man River. I made this decision for two reasons. Firstly, it will save us an extra 50 bucks a month (particularly, since bus passes will be raised to close to 50$ this September). Secondly, it will allow for a more natural more intense exercise programme.  I am going to start the first Monday in July since I have the Thursday and the Friday off. We are going to use the money I would have spent on a buss pass on fixing up my bike and—if all goes well—getting me a pannier.  We’ll see how that goes.

      Mary and I went to the Cardston Alberta Temple this morning to do some work for Grandma and Grandpa Siever. In March, we did their baptismal and initiatory work along with that of around 50 others of my relatives. Walter Siever and Lydia Abel were the first ancestors for whom we’ve done endowment work.  It’s been over nine years since Pepère’s baptism and endowment work was done, so now all of my deceased biological grandparents have had their work done.  How exciting!

      Mary has been telling me for the last few years that I have grey hair. I could never seem to find them. Conveniently, she would tell me they were in the back of my head, so naturally I could not see them in a mirror.  Anyhow, I saw one on the top of my head Wednesday night. It appears she was telling the truth the whole time.  I do not mind growing older; I am embracing it. It sure puts things into perspective though, particularly since I was home teaching with someone last night who has been home from his mission for seven months and married for “two months and one week”.

      When I went through the temple to receive my endowment a number of years ago, I met in a small room with my mum, my two ushers and received some guidance and instruction before the ordinance. The person who gave me instruction and council told me that I should not let my garments lay around on the floor.  I saw a person I know use the bottom of his garment top to clean his glasses, as someone would do with his/her t-shirt.  Is one right and the other wrong? Is there somewhere in the middle we should be?

      Over at BCC, John Hatch  urlLink asks the question  “In what ways is the Church doing better in recognizing local customs and culture?” I don't have any answers, but I wanted to add a question that goes a bit further than that.  It's been nearly four years since English was outnumbered by all other languages spoken in the Church. It is predicted that in roughly 15 years, Spanish will be the most widely spoken language in the Church, with English being an ever-dwindling second.  How will this affect the demographics and administration of the Church?

      Julie M. Smith  urlLink posted  a question over at T&S asking I there are any profession members of the Church just  can’t  do. It has garnered a number of responses thus far, most of which I disagree with. For example, the ones I disagree with include:     Brewer   Tobacconist   Evolutionary scientist   Gay-wedding planner     I'm not so sure that members of the Church  can't  work in industries that promote breaking of the Word of Wisdom. So long as the individual is not drinking beer, why  can  s/he not work in a brewery? So long as the individual does not smoke the tobacco, why couldn't s/he harvest it for the tobacco company. For that matter, what of the trucker who ships the products, the grocer who sells them or the manufacturer who creates their packaging?  So long as the person does not violate the Word of Wisdom, I see no reason for them not being able to hold jobs with such companies.  I, too, see no reason for a member of the Church not to be an evolutionary scientist since evolution is not against church teachings.  Nor do I see why a member of the Church  cannot  plan gay weddings.  I had a similar post on being an  urlLink LDS actor .

      In a message board I frequent, some discussion came up about Adam and Eve and their transgression. After some study, I came upon the following thoughts:   "And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat" (Gen 3:6)  What is interesting here is that it doesn't say that she partook of the fruit because she wanted to disobey God. Rather she saw that the fruit would make her wise—or as the footnote suggests—give her insight.  Naturally, gaining further insight or wisdom is not inherently bad; our church encourages us to gain further knowledge.  I wonder then if the transgression Eve committed was less the partaking of the fruit. I wonder if her transgression was more relying on her own faculties to gain further light and knowledge rather than waiting for God to give them to her.  I wonder of the parallel with her son Cain. We all know Cain gave a sacrifice to the Lord. I do not think the Lord rejected the sacrifice because it was a sacrifice. After all, his brother Abel offered a sacrifice often that was always accepted. I wonder if what the Lord rejected was the fact that Cain offered a sacrifice only because Satan commanded him too (Moses 5:18).

      As I mentioned in  urlLink an earlier post , LA Transit is making some changes over the next yar. Most of them are route/structural changes, but there are some fare increases as well. Some of the route changes include:     Smaller, community buses on smaller routes with lower ridership   An express route to the Lethbridge Community College   More cross-town routes replacing all downtown routes   Only one bus to the Westside starting in the fall   Change to 30-minute service from 20-minute service during daytime     Some of these changes I have been supporting and advocating for years. Lethbridge Transit had been stuck in the archaic form of thinking that every route needed to come downtown despite the fact that the vast majority of riders ended up transferring to another bus instead of staying downtown. Until this past fall, there was no cross-town service. In addition, too many routes were coming downtown from West Lethbridge. This was far too inefficient of transit resources. Finally, there was direct link between the University of Lethbridge and Lethbridge Community College. The proposed changes will address all of these concerns.  I do not automatically support a reduction in service times, but considering the size of Lethbridge’s population base, a 20-minute service is not realistically feasible. Much larger urban centres do not have a base service time of less than 30-minute services. Anything less than 30-minutes is usually on very high-traffic routes.  Regarding the fare increase, one of the most popular arguments against it has been the reported 200,000$+ surplus of LA Transit. Opponents of the fare increases have stated that if there is a surplus, it is evidence that riders are being charged too much. I’m not a proponent of absolutely increasing fares for increasing fares’ sake. However, I also did not here these same opponents claiming riders were not being charged enough when Lethbridge Transit was running a deficit.

      John Hesch  urlLink posted  about a substitute teacher who viewed porn in class that some students inadvertently saw after coming to his desk.  The students apparently went to the principal’s office and  urlLink reported  that the teacher “"was looking at bad things on the computer”.  I’m not saying the children did anything wrong in reporting the teacher, but I have to wonder about the use of the term “bad things”. It seems in religious society, sex and the naked body are viewed as “bad”. I’m not so sure they are absolutely. In certain contexts, the naked body is very beautiful and even minimalistic. In certain contexts, the act of sex is an intimate and sacred event.  I have met a number of people who teach their children about chastity with blanket statements like “sex is bad. I think that is wrong. I think parents have a responsibility to teach their children that it isn’t the act of sex or nudity itself that are wrong; it is their existence outside of certain contexts that is wrong.  Believe or not, I have met a few people who felt a pang of uneasiness, shame or even guilt when they encountered sex for the first time, after marriage.  That being said, I also know some people who looked so forward to having sex after they were married for sex's sake that their reverence for the event was almost nonexistent.  So on one hand there’s no much innocence, shame and naivety, yet on the other had there is so much baseness, carnality and irreverence. How do we come to the middle?

      I have heard of open house, but  urlLink this  tops the lot.  Joshua and Kimberly Colton of Amesbury, Massachusetts, organised a number of speakers in the summer of 2002 to speak on various gospel topics in their home. They provided an open invitation to the public through newspaper and television ads.  Their website does not say how successful it is, but the local paper—  urlLink Merrimack River Current  —specifies that they are holding the lectures every Thursday.  When I was a ward mission leader—and when I later served in the stake mission presidency—I helped convince the stake mission president and the stake president that we needed to hold an open house. The first year saw over 100 people attend in three meetinghouses. Every year since then, it has been dramatically more successful.

      I came across this scripture today and—given my recent posts on the separation of church and state—thought it would be applicable here.   We do not believe it just to mingle religious influence with civil government, whereby one religious society is fostered and another proscribed in its spiritual privileges, and the individual rights of its members, as citizens, denied. (D&C 134:9)

      Twenty-four years ago yesterday, the priesthood was provided to all male members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints “without regard to race or [colour]”.  It was this decision that has made Brazil and many parts of Africa such hotspots for Church growth. Without this revelation, the temples in Accra and Aba would ever be a dream.

      So, Dr. Laura has a  urlLink new book . Just reading the title raises an eyebrow. Reading the summary is like travelling in a time machine back 50 years.   In her newest book, Schlessinger…unabashedly [asserts] that man is a "very simple creature," who needs only "direct communication, respect, appreciation, food, and good loving'" to respond with devotion, compassion and love, this controversial marriage and family therapist claims that every woman can achieve a deeply satisfying marriage if she adheres to certain fundamentals men require. Preparing dinner, caring for the children without complaint, greeting her husband with a kiss and engaging in sexual intimacy instead of "tearing down a husband's necessary sense of strength and importance" can result in the harmonious marriage women crave.   Is she serious?

      Now  urlLink this  is interesting.  A number of churches (including Episcopal Church, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, the Alliance of Baptists) have written a letter to the US Congress telling the government to not pass laws that reflect a narrow religious view. In particular, they refer to the proposed amendment to the US constitution banning same-sex marriage.   [Also] signing the letter were seven Jewish groups, led by the Union for Reform Judaism, two Quaker groups and three Sikh groups. Also included were the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), the Washington office of the Presbyterian Church, USA, and the Unitarian Universalist Association…Americans United For Separation of Church and State helped coordinate the project.   And then Richard Land, head of the Southern Baptist Convention's ethics and religious liberty commission, goes on to say:   To say that this is an attempt to foist one religious viewpoint on everyone else is just nonsense.  This is a moral issue .   It seems that this is exactly what the group of churches is saying. It is a moral issue, albeit one based on only Christian morals, and they are saying the State should stay out of moral issues founded upon a single—or at least a minority—religion.

      The Calgary Flames lost tonight. It was a good last five minutes, but Nikolai Khabibulin wouldn’t let any more shots go through. Yet another year has gone by with the Stanley Cup not residing in Canada. I guess we’ll see if it will be twelve years.  As far as I am concerned, however, Calgary won it on Saturday, despite officials not counting Gelinas’ goal. If they had counted it, there would have been no overtime and it would have been Calgary’s fourth game.  Another sad day in Canada today.

      My children sat with me at the start of the game tonight between the Calgary Flames and the Tampa Bay Lightning. Before the game began, they had a bunch of pre-game footage. Part of the footage included two young women in skimpy red clothing jumping up and down singing some sort of chant.  My five-year-old daughter turns to me and asks, “They’re not dressed very modest, are they”?  “No, they’re not”.  “We dress modestly, don’t we”?  Yes, we do.

      I was reading in Mosiah 26 last week, and I came across something I had read many times before, but which I found interesting nonetheless. Alma and his people along with Limhi and his people have all be joined together with Mosiah and his people in Zarahemla. In the previous chapter, Mosiah had given Alma the authority to organise the church throughout the land of Zarahemla.  There were a number of people in Zarahemla who would to join the Church and who made it difficult for members of the Church to remain committed to the religious convictions. Naturally, Alma, as a spiritual leader, was disturbed by this growing phenomenon. Not knowing how to handle it, he approached King Mosiah.  King Mosiah’s response was fundamentally that he had given Alma authority of the Church and this was a spiritual matter. King Mosiah dealt with political and secular matters. He thus told Alma to find a way to deal with it. Certainly, these people were doing something that was hard on the believers, but they broke no laws, so why should Mosiah do anything?  There seems to be parallel to our day. Sometimes, we are quick to want to prosecute people if they do something that is against the teachings of church, even if that which they do is legal. Why is it that some members of the Church are so apt to want Church ad State not to be separate?

      We were all taught in Seminary and Sunday School about the teenaged antics of the sons of Mosiah and Alma, Jr. We learned about their efforts to sway people from the Church. We also learned about  urlLink the visit  they received from an angel that called them to repentance with a thunderous voice that shook the earth.  I wonder though why the angel specifically addressed his words to Alma. Why was Alma the one who went into the trance/coma? Do we have any indication that Alma was more “evil” than his four partners were? It certainly is not because Alma, Jr, had any more of an important work to do than the sons of Mosiah.

      Our gospel doctrine teacher phoned me today asking if I would give a sort of presentation in class next week.

She wants me to put together a five-minute monologue in the spirit of this month’s national election based on the text of the  urlLink fourth chapter of Alma . She wants me to do a sort of campaign to convince the people to let me hand over the post to Nephihah.  I guess I get to act over the summer even if I’m not in school.

      Well, Calgary didn’t make the Stanley Cup tonight. The series is going to Game 7, which really bites because they should have won tonight.  The puck went over the goal line in the third period after it deflected of Gelinas and under the goalies legs. Only one camera shot actually showed the puck over the line, but it was from above and so couldn’t tell if it was simply in the air over the line or on the ice over the line. But c’mon, if it went under the goalie’s legs, it was travelling on the ice.  What a joke.  Well, the last time Calgary won the Cup, it was at an away game. Here’s hoping for the Tampa Bay game on Monday.

      In yesterday’s issue of AskMen.com Newsletter, the weekly question was, “In your opinion, what is the main purpose of marriage?”  The first responder was quoted as saying the following:   There is absolutely no purpose of marriage other than to raise a family...Other than children, I don't think marriage is that important.   Do people really believe this? Do they truly feel that there is no other purpose to being married than to raising children? What about the trust and commitment a marriage develops in the partners?  What does everyone else think? What is the purpose of marriage?

      Now that the mass searches for Brooke Wilberger are being replaced with groups of investigators and trained searchers only going out on solid leads, I’ve decided to start posting regular posts again.  This blog received a lot of traffic this week. Tuesday was a record day. I had 574 page loads and 310 unique visitors. Of those 310, 282 were first time visitors. The most common search term, of course, was “Brooke Wilberger”. Oddly enough though, most of those searches came through MSN and Yahoo! where I was placing second or third. Google kept caching to old copies of the blog from the 22nd of May, before Brooke disappeared. When they finally indexed the current copy of the page, it would only last for a day. Hence, I rarely received visitors from Google. That is ironic actually, since before Brooke’s disappearance, virtually all of the traffic from search engines to my site was from Google.  Not sure if this experience has provided me with any new returning visitors or not, but I hope I did a worthwhile service with the posts I provided regarding Brooke.  Here’s hoping she is found soon.

      Going through the press releases and news articles this morning did not seem to bring up anything new in the Brooke Wilberger case. However, it did give me an opportunity to pause and think about my own family.  Every day I come home from work and find my children and wife at home alive and well. Most days I think nothing of it and never have the chance to reflect on what a blessing to me this is. That which the Wilberger family is experiencing is something I wish I would never experience. I hope that I will never take my own family and their presence for granted.

      In another blog, someone brought up the  Canadian Health Care Is No Model for U.S.  article written by Jay Lehr, Ph.D.and published by The Heartland Institute and The Galan Institute.  It is good to some degree, but there are a couple of points I wanted to comment on.    "The Canadian system is built around a compulsory public insurance regime that provides most medical and hospital services free." Lemieux adds that the system is not, of course, free for the Canadian taxpayer. Twenty-two percent of all taxes raised in Canada are spent on its health care system.   Left out here was that citizens in Alberta and British Columbia are also required to pay monthly premiums. Also left out is the fact that public funding accounts for less than three-quarters of the total funding for health care. 27.3 percent of the funding comes through supplementary insurance (such as Blue Cross), employer-sponsored benefits or from the users’ own pockets.   In Canada, it is illegal to seek or convey private medical assistance.   This is completely false. There are plenty of medical services that are not funded by the government. Examples include dentists, optometrists, chiropractors, cosmetic surgeons, massage therapists and some services and surgeries provided for by private clinics. Canada has both private and public medical services available.   Physicians are told by the government how much they can charge for their services;   This is a half truth. Compensation for physician services is negotiated between the provinces and the provincial medical associations on the basis of fee and utilization increases, subject to various forms of individual physician or global ceilings.   The supply of medical services in Canada is completely rationed, with no significant private alternative.   Interesting. First, Mr Lehr states that it is illegal to seek or convey private medical assistance, but then he implies such assistance exists, albeit to an insignificant degree.   My own personal contacts with Canadians support a recent article in the Montreal Gazette, in which a Canadian woman described the frequent rudeness of unionized Canadian medical staff as compared to the "kindness, discretion, and professionalism" of staff members in U.S. hospitals.   In that case, the humanitarian attitudes of American medical workers must be phenomenal because my experience with Canadian medical staff has been filled with kindness, discretion and professionalism. In fact, earlier this week I had to go see two different specialists—to which I might add took my doctor less than two weeks to schedule the appointments—and on both occasions, I felt very comfortable and we even had jovial conversations.   Americans...should have no interest in seeing their health care deteriorate to the level of Canada's "free" system.   How lovely. Now our system is dilapidated.  Mr Lehr started out with a good idea, but sure seems to resort to a lot of rhetoric and individual experiences. The article seems to be little more than a scare tactic.  Canada’s system needs improvements. Absolutely, but the USA does not have a perfect system either.

      Simon Southerton, geneticist and author of  Losing a Lost Tribe: Native Americans, DNA and the Mormon Church , has  urlLink taken up a crusade  to "[examine] church teachings that American Indians and Polynesians have a historic bond with ancient Israelites." He does so by using DNA research and applying it to current popular opinion of members of the Church and writings of some scholars with the Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies.   This seems to be a thorny issue for Southerton. He left the Church because there seemed to be no conclusive evidence that supported the widely held notion among Latter-day Saints that Pacific Islanders and indigenous people of the Americas were descended from the Lamanites.  First, I find it unbelievable—actually, I can believe it, but it still is dumbfounding—that someone's conviction to the Church can be swayed by scientific evidence. The Book of Mormon is not a scientific journal. It does not establish scientific fact and does not even heavily support scientific theories. It is nothing more than a spiritual record—interspersed with select historical information—of a distinct, isolated group of people.  Second, there is no indication whatsoever in the Book of Mormon that the Lamanites and Nephites were completely alone in the Americas. To say otherwise is nothing more than speculation. It is entirely plausible and even likely that the Lamanites and Nephites encountered—and even mingled with—other peoples already present in the Americas. This alone would reduce any existence of Israelite DNA. As well, it is entirely plausible that the Lamanite population died off or were exterminated; after all, the record of their history is incomplete.  Third, popular belief among Latter-day Saints does not equal doctrine. Just because many Latter-day Saints hold on to the archaic notion that all people indigenous to the Americas are descended solely from Lehi, does not make it church doctrine. I wish more people would understand this one principle. Tradition is not doctrine.  The Book of Mormon is primarily a religious book containing teachings and doctrine about God and Jesus Christ. To treat it primarily as anything else is to treat it as a very shaky foundation.  That being said, it only take a smidgen of logic to see that DNA research does not disprove the Book of Mormon. One would think a scientist like Southerton would understand that.

      Fine. I admit it. I am envious. I envy all the famous designers. Why do I envy them? Because they have their own books.    urlLink Dan Cederholm  has  Web Standards Solutions ,  urlLink Eric Meyer  has  Cascading Style Sheets: The Definitive Guide ,  urlLink Jeffrey Zeldman  has  Designing with Web Standards , and  urlLink Mark Pilgrim  has  Dive into Python . Those are just the ones that come to mind.  I like to think that I have my head on straight when it comes to using CSS for design. I like to think I can code in HTML, JavaScript and ColdFusion as well as I can design. I like to think that when I create a page, I do so in a way that puts the user’s quest for knowledge ahead of my desire to flaunt my talents.  On the other hand, no one contacted me to do a Blogger template. I’ve never had a big name company (like ESPN, Fox, Warner Bros, and Tupperware) approach me for doing a website. I’ve never been published on A List Apart. Those whom I consider the prominent web designers have never contacted me and said, “Kim, I loved the new site. Very inspiring.”  Am I simply mediocre in my abilities and projects, or am I just invisible to everyone except my family and a handful of Bloggernaclites?  I want to write a book. I want to write a book that others will consider the foremost reference for that particular topic. I want to write a book that other designers will pick up and say, “I can’t believe I never thought to write a book like that.”  Can I? Is there one area of web design where I excel? Is there one area of web design for which I could write reference material that others would find useful? Is there one area where people would be more likely to approach me for advice?  I wish I knew.  Sure, the money would be nice if the book was successful. To be honest, however, I want to write a book to prove to myself that I am more than an average web designer. I want to prove to myself that I know a lot about one thing more than I know a little about everything.  Am I just being dreamy?

      As some of you who are more familiar with me, you may be aware of my uncanny desire to design new websites constantly. The bug bit again.   Rather than trying to determine a niche to fill and research the necessary information to make it successful, I decided instead to build a sub-website on our family site.  I’ve been anxiously engaged in family history work for the past few years and with the temple work I did  urlLink earlier this year , I have become even more converted to genealogy. As such, I decided to create  urlLink a website  where I can post photographs, stories and biographical information about my ancestors. I started it yesterday and only have two ancestors (Willy Siever and Josef Loskot) so far, but I thought I’d announce it to get a head start on the Google indexing.  Oh, and a special thanks yet again to fellow LDS designer  urlLink Cameron Moll  for the inspiration in the design I used.      urlLink http://people.uleth.ca/~kim.siever/family/ancestors/   Since IE has poor PNG support, you may want to use a modern browser other than IE to view the site.

      We are leaving early tomorrow morning to go camping in Sherwood Forest, outside of Regina, Saskatchewan. I will have no access to the Internet so my blog will be unattended for a few days. In fact, if my time in training in Vancouver at the end of June was indication, I might not be contributing much even when we get back on the 26th.    urlLink Sherwood Forest  is a country club/campground where my family spent every summer during my early teens. It is only 13 kilometres from Regina, so often my dad would simply commute into work from the campsite during the week.  I haven’t been there since we moved to Vancouver in 1989, so I am really looking forward to it. It will be nice to see how much has changed. It will also be nice to gorge myself on all those chokecherries.  For anyone who’s interested, we will be attending the Lewvan Ward in Regina this Sunday and the moose Jaw Ward the following Sunday. In the very slim chance someone from Moose Jaw or Regina who is a member of the Church is reading this, feel free to introduce yourself when we show up.  See you all in a couple of weeks.

The band split up in the mid-70s after only two records, but those two records influenced both the later punk scene and the popular glam-metal scene of the 80s. British rocker Morrissey convinced the Dolls to reunite for a special appearance at London’s Meltdown festival last month.   Kane had met with many difficulties and trials over the years and about 12 years ago joined the Church. When the band approached him about reuniting, he was working at a family history centre in Los Angeles.   The funeral will be held tomorrow at the Santa Monica Blvd chapel.

      A retired schoolteacher  urlLink challenged  five prominent business and government leaders of Brigham City, Utah, to spend two hours in a wheelchair downtown. The results were eye opening.    The leaders learned the difficulty of using public washrooms, trying to reach faraway produce or frozen goods in the grocery store, inaccessibility to facilities only available by stair, getting passed doorways with too-high thresholds, and opening the door at the Tabernacle.   Sharon Ross, a member of the Governor''s Council for People with Disabilities, has also conducted these sessions in Cedar City and Roosevelt, both in Utah.   I wish getting website developers to embrace accessibility issues was just as easy. Sigh.

      According to John the Beloved, the last words Jesus spoke during his mortal life were “It is finished”.    When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost. (John 19:30)    I wonder, however, to what “it” refers. What is finished? Does Jesus mean He was finished suffering for our sins? Does He mean the redemption part of the Atonement was complete?   Paul suggests that in  urlLink 1 Cor. 15:3  that Jesus died for our sins. If that is true, then it appears that the death of Christ was part of the redemptive portion of the Atonement. That being said, it could also be interpreted to mean that Paul refereed to the dying process (suffering on the cross) and not the actual point when Jesus “gave up the ghost”.   Any thoughts?

      It turns out that FOX TV seems to have a problem with the Canadian anthem. For whatever reason—they cite lack of time—they made the decision to  urlLink axe the performance of “O Canada”  from Tuesday’s Major League Baseball All-Star game.   And Gord Downie was singing it to boot.   Apparently, there was enough time to broadcast Muhammad Ali  urlLink dragging out the balls  to be used in the ceremonial first pitches.  Lack of time? Yeah, just like Ranger fans last spring booing the Canadian anthem right after the Canadian soldiers were killed in Afghanistan was nothing but good, ribbing fun.

      As a website developer who specialises in CSS-based designs, I obviously hang around (i.e. read blogs of, participate in mailing lists with) other like developers. One of the legitimate concerns many—if not all—of them have is the relatively less support Internet Explorer has for CSS 2.1. Part of the reason for this is the fact that the current version of IE is nearly three years old, while every other popular, standards-compliant browser has had a major release within the past year.   A common issue such designers have is users having the ability to resize webpage text to meet their level of reading comfort. All modern browsers have resizing capabilities; however, some have more powerful capabilities than others do. For example, IE can only size text to five sizes (smallest, smaller, medium, larger, and largest) while Opera can resize text and images from 20% to 1000% of the original size. As well, IE can only resize relatively sized text (i.e. em, pt, cm, in, %), while other browsers can resize even absolutely sized text (i.e. px).  Given the common and predominant disapproval of IE’s relatively low support for CSS 2.1, many people often attribute IE’s inability to resize absolutely sized text as a bug. Some even go as far as saying IE is broken in this regard. I  strongly  disagree with this notion.  IE is not broken. It does exactly what the designer tells it to do. If a designer specifies s/he wants a font sized based on 12 pixels then it renders the fonts based on 12 pixels. In actuality, it is the other browsers that are “broken” since they incorrectly render the text in an effort to allow users to resize text.  I repeat, IE is  not  broken.  That being said, pixel-based text is a bad practise for copy. Any user coming to your website should be able to resize at least the copy text. This ability should not be hampered at all, and should be independent of what browser s/he uses. Ideally, all text should be resizable, and images should not be used to solely present text.  In conclusion, the inability to resize text in Internet Explorer is  not  the fault of Microsoft engineers; it’s the fault of inconsiderate website developers.

      Doug Bowman brought up a  urlLink good point  about the apparent lack of women designers out there. Specifically, he laments the lack of women designers keen on and experts in standards compliance.   I took the time to re-evaluate who I visit regularly and noticed women were missing from the list. I haven't added anyone to my list of non-LDS blogs, so I scoured around for a couple of good sites. However, I wanted sites that looked good and gave good design advice. I found a few that were one or the other, but in the ten minutes I could afford to look around, I came across two pretty good ones.  The first was  urlLink Eris Free  and the other was  urlLink Helen Hearn . I'm always willing to add more, so if you know of anyone, please let me know.

      I did better today on my bike commute. I managed to make it 30-35 metres further than I did last week. I know it does not seem like much, but given that it was uphill and my bike has only ten speeds, I consider it an accomplishment.  The break my legs had over the weekend must have really helped.

      While reading in Alma 17 today, I came across an interesting scripture.   And they had been teaching the word of God for the space of fourteen years among the Lamanites, having had much success in bringing many to the knowledge of the truth; yea, by the power of their words many were brought before the altar of God, to call on his name and confess their sins before him. (Verse 4)    This scripture then brought to mind a few others.   But, behold, my beloved brethren, thus came the voice of the Son unto me, saying: After ye have repented of your sins, and witnessed unto the Father that ye are willing to keep my commandments, by the baptism of water, and have received the baptism of fire and of the Holy Ghost, and can speak with a new tongue, yea, even with the tongue of angels, and after this should deny me, it would have been better for you that ye had not known me. (2 Ne 31:14)    Neither did they receive any unto baptism save they came forth with a broken heart and a contrite spirit, and witnessed unto the church that they truly repented of all their sins. (Moro. 6:2)   It seems then by these scriptures that one is required to repent of one’s sins before being baptised. But then other scriptures come to mind.   Behold I say unto you that this thing shall ye teach—repentance and baptism unto those who are accountable and capable of committing sin… (Moro. 8:10)    Wherefore, he has given a law; and where there is no law given there is no punishment; and where there is no punishment there is no condemnation; and where there is no condemnation the mercies of the Holy One of Israel have claim upon them, because of the atonement; for they are delivered by the power of him. (2 Ne 9:25)   Scriptures such as these suggest that a person can only be held accountable for knowingly acting against the commandments or laws of God.  A question comes to mind. Once someone learns about and accepts the gospel, is it necessary for the person to repent of previous wrong actions despite the fact that s/he committed them independent of knowledge of the commandments?

      Members of the Church, from time to time, are asked  urlLink the question , “Are people excommunicated because they’re gay”. Obviously, the right answer is someone should not be—and in most cases is not—excommunicated because of how they feel. In addition, they would be excommunicated if they were involved in any sexual activity outside of marriage. I have even  urlLink used  these as my answer when given this question.    The Lord's law of moral conduct is abstinence from sexual relations outside of lawful marriage and fidelity within marriage. ( Church Handbook of Instructions , Vol. 1, p. 157)   However, this answer lends itself to another question. What of those homosexuals in Québec or Massachusetts who are married? Would they be excommunicated if they are having sexual relations—albeit homosexual—within a lawful marriage?  If so, then why is the above answer so commonly used? If it’s not an issue of sexual relations within marriage, why do we use that to veil our answers?

      As Daniel brought up over at  urlLink Wump Blog , the Church has issued  urlLink a statement on marriage  in anticipation of SSM debate.    The First Presidency of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints issued the following statement today. This is a statement of principle in anticipation of the expected debate over same-gender marriage. It is not an endorsement of any specific amendment.  "The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints favors a constitutional amendment preserving marriage as the lawful union of a man and a woman."   I’m obviously not surprised that they issued a statement, nor am I surprised with the position they took. However, I found the wording intriguing.  Why did they choose the word “favor”? Why did they choose to favour the amendment rather than endorse it? Why did they not include opposition to any amendment changing the definition of marriage? Does the favouring of marriage as a union of a single man and a single woman mean the Church has no intention of reintroducing plural marriage in the future?

      The Church  urlLink announced  yesterday that it plans to have Doubleday Books publish a new version of the Book of Mormon starting this November.   The hardcover book has a  urlLink new, cool design cover  using some sweet colour and font choices. Doubleday has also introduced some other changes designed to focus more on the Book of Mormon as a book for reading rather than study. For example, the new edition will no longer have footnotes. However, it will also have a seven-page Reference Guide with background information on the Church and some of its teachings.  These changes should make the Book of Mormon a more approachable gifts for friends and family who do not belong to our faith.

      As I mentioned in an earlier post, I changed my commute to work on Monday from a public transit commute to a cycling commute. It’s been a challenge considering all traffic to and from West Lethbridge needs to travel down into and up out of the Old Man River valley. It seems that despite my cycling efforts in the gym previously, nothing is quite like riding up a genuine hill, and it will be a while before I an make it all the way up without dismounting. Having a bike with only ten speeds doesn’t help any either.   Yesterday’s ride in was picturesque and I wish I had my camera. There was fog all over the Old Man River and riding on the pedestrian bridge over the fog was quite spectacular.  This morning’s ride was un eventful; although, I didn’t get quite as far up the hill as I did yesterday. However, most of the day today saw a downpour of hail and rain. We’ve had rain every week since the snow stopped (sometimes every day or two) ranging from drizzle to hard downpours. However, up to now, we’ve had nothing like what we had today.  I tried waiting out the storm, but it was no use. I left at quarter to five and walked down most of the path behind the university. I mounted my bike when I was clear of all the switchbacks. I managed to cover the same distance going up Whoop-Up Drive as I did yesterday, but my walk up was spent in a downpour. When I finally came up to Scenic Drive, the downpour changed to a slight drizzle, which made my ride the rest of the way home more bearable.  What an experience. At least, our river valley is nice and green and we’ve only had to water our lawn twice this year.

      It’s bad enough that the marketing efforts of baby formula makers has resulted in many perfectly healthy and breastfeeding-capable mothers to choose bottle feeding over natural, God-given breastfeeding as the primary nutritional source for their babies.   Now, Mead Johnson—the manufacturer of Enfamil A+— urlLink claims  their formula has been clinically proven to provide young children with higher early mental development scores. What mother (or father) does not want her baby to be smart? What parents do not brag about how further along developmentally their child is compared to others? It is disgraceful that a company has decided to prey on this natural desire just to give themselves some sort of competitive edge.  It does not make a difference of course that the so-called study included a very small simple group of only 56 babies or that the study spanned a very small timeframe of only one year. Ironically, the ingredients Mead Johnson claim offers this advantage are found in breast milk at 10 times the amount found in their artificial alternative.  Mead Johnson’s actions in this regard are not only unethical and predatory, but they are scientifically irresponsible.

      In Alma 48:8, we learn that Captain Moroni fortified the Nephite city of Ammonihah by building a very tall ridge of earth around it. It was so tall, in fact, that “the Lamanites could not cast their stones and their arrows at them...neither could they come upon them save it was by their place of entrance”.   How is this possible? How can earth be piled so high that someone could climb to the top? Whenever I have piled dirt, the higher I pile it, the further the bottom spreads out.  Some suggest it may have been made out of cement, but verse 22 says the Lamanites were digging down the banks. This suggests it was just earth.  I just don’t see how a bank of earth could be built without someone being able to climb to the top.

      Throughout First Nephi, Chapter 22 (see vv  urlLink 2,15,17,23 ), Nephi makes reference to the prophet. Who is “the prophet”? I cannot seem to find any direct quotes in the Old Testament that match what Nephi says “the prophet” said, so it seems somewhat unlikely that he refers to an Old Testament prophet. It also seems unlikely he refers to Zenock, Zenos or Neum.  Any thoughts?

      Someone I know forwarded me an email that supposedly originates from some feel-good, pro-Conservative, blue-collar, middle-aged man from Edmonton. In it, he tells everyone to not vote for the Liberal government. Here are some problems I have with his rant.     In 35 of the past 37 years, Canada has been ruled by:  (1) Pierre Trudeau - a multi-millionaire lawyer from Quebec.  (2) Brian Mulroney - a multi-millionaire lawyer from Quebec.  (3) Jean Chretien - a multi-millionaire lawyer from Quebec.  (4) And now we are going to vote for Paul Martin - a multi-millionaire lawyer from Quebec   Uh…Brian Mulroney was a Conservative. Apparently, whatever problem being a millionaire from Québec puts forward extends beyond the Liberal party. Of course, that is leaving out the fact that Paul Martin is from Windsor, Ontario.   Stephen Harper says that the Conservative party will:  (1) Reduce my taxes.  (2) Pay off the national debt as fast as they can.   Intersting. So, Stephen Harper would decrease the amount of money coming into the government coffers, yet somehow magically apply more money to the debt than is currently being applied. Oh, wait. I forgot. He’ll cut services; increasing the following problems Mr. Robberstad cited, such as the following:   My personal expenses have increased. My waiting time to see a doctor has increased. My concerns for my family's safety have increased. My costs to educate my children have increased.   Great plan.  I already voted. However, I based my voting decision not on one-sided, biased chain letters. Rather, I based my voting decision by studing party policies and picking a party that most closely matched my values.  Oh, and read the comments in  urlLink this blog  for other Canadians who think this message is fishy.

      While reading in  urlLink Alma 39  today, I reflected on the popular LDS notion that any sexual sin is more heinous of all sins after murder and denying the Holy Ghost. The first few verses of the chapter seem to refer to a specific type of sexual sin.     ...thou didst go on unto boasting in thy strength and thy wisdom.  ...thou didst forsake the ministry, and did go over into the land of Siron among the borders of the Lamanites, after the harlot Isabel.  Yea, she did steal away the hearts of many; but this was no excuse for thee, my son. Thou shouldst have tended to the ministry wherewith thou wast entrusted.  Know ye not, my son, that these things are an abomination in the sight of the Lord; yea, most abominable above all sins save it be the shedding of innocent blood or denying the Holy Ghost?   Is Alma saying that the sin, which is an abomination, was forsaking the ministry for his sexual desires? If so, how has LDS popular thought regarding this evolved into including such things as masturbation and immoral thoughts? How has unclean thoughts, for example, become more serious than stealing?

      Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday were spent in class from 08:30 to 17:00, making for some very long, mentally exhausting days. The heat and humidity didn’t help either. The classes were very intense and I certainly learned a lot about ColdFusion. I am looking forward to implementing some new tools on the Faculty of Management’s website tomorrow.   I was up Thursday morning by 05:00 so that my dad could drop me off at the Vancouver International Airport after he opened up the job site on the BCIT campus. I was home five hours after arriving at the airport. We spent the day visiting as a family and doing groceries. I was exhausted, so didn’t stay up too late.  Friday and Saturday were spent mowing the lawn, weeding the garden, trimming some trees and working on the truck. I also did a bunch of work on my bike to get it ready for my commute starting Monday. We bought a pannier, a bike pump, a spoke wrench and a bike lock. We also took my front tire in to be repaired. The guys at Ascent Cycle put in a new tube and replace the rim tape. I ended up adjusting the centre bolt on my front brakes to tight, so had to get that fixed as well. I also adjusted my gears and took the bike for two test rides. As well, when I was trying to pump up my rear tire with my new pump, the stem came too far out of the rim. The part of the tube that stuck out ballooned until it popped, so I had to purchase a new tube.  I think everything’s ready to go now, and we’ll see how my first run will be tomorrow.

      As Jeremy  urlLink reported , world-renowned musician Tal Bachman left the church. Apparently, it  urlLink has taken  the former Sunday School teacher two years to come to this decision. Technically, he still is a member because he has yet to formally request name removal through a letter to his bishop.  Nevertheless, one thing in the article really caught my attention.    I came to understand that, much to my shock, many of the foundational claims of the church were not based in reality. I struggled so much with that, and kept trying to un-know what I kept uncovering, that at the end of two years I felt so burdened and so confused and puzzled. I kept going to these church defenders that I'd always trusted and trying to find out what the explanations were for what appeared to be smoking guns. And there weren't any.   Why is it historical accuracy is such a big issue for so many people who left the Church? Why do they put so much weight in the accuracy of events happening exactly as described?  These same people, for example, often have no problem accepting that the creation of the world did not happen in six 24-hour periods. However, when they’re faced with the fact that Joseph Smith allegedly wrote a couple dozen versions of the First Vision, all of a sudden it’s too much and the whole Church is a sham.  Sigh.  In all honesty, who cares? Who cares if the First Vision was with God and Jesus Christ or if it was three angels? The point is that the heavens that were closed for millennia were now open. The point is that the Lord opened the way for a church run by revelation. Who cares if the world was created in six days, six thousand years, or 4.5 billion years? The point is that it was created.  Some naysayers may read this post and say, “Who are you to question his decision? Who are you to be an expert on questioning doctrines when you’ve lived the sheltered life of Mormonism?” To such things, I respond by saying that my life has been far from sheltered. I have had my share of worldly indulgences. I have had my share of questions.  In fact, I came to the point where my faith was seriously shaken as well. You want to know the difference between my experience and others like Tal’s? When my faith wavered, it wasn’t because I read that Joseph Smith was a boozer or that Brigham Young was racist. It wasn’t because I found what appeared to be inconsistencies between the Book of Mormon and the Bible. It wasn’t because my bishop couldn’t answer my questions.  It was because I doubted God’s existence.  That’s right. It wasn’t my faith in a single book. It wasn’t faith in the character of a prophet. It wasn’t faith in the sociability of my home teachers. It was faith in God.  The point is when you question your faith, think about what you’re questioning. If you are offended by someone and decide to never come back to church, think about where your faith must lie. If you come across some abhorrent thing Joseph Smith did and decide to leave the Church, think about where your faith lies.  Think about where your faith lies.  It was a very hard and depressing experience I went through. However, I am very grateful for it. The experience has really solidified my faith and I have become stronger as a result. Because of this, odd events and doctrines that would normally offend or shake someone’ faith do not phase me. I am now able to question things freely.  Think about where your faith lies.

It invokes images of high school juniors in a basement pushing out 25$ FrontPage websites. It gives the business world the impression that I started web design just yesterday. It is amateurish, unprofessional and—frankly—idiotic.  So, stop calling me it. I am not a webmaster. I am not a web guru.

      I have been working my legs too hard over the last couple of weeks with my non-stop cycling. Last weekend certainly was not enough time to let me legs recuperate. I decided to drive to work this morning in hopes that a third day will be enough to get my legs back to normal.  Anyhow, while walking from my truck to the University of Lethbridge on one of the new paths, I was reflecting on how the path has a lot to do with web design.   Before the fall of 2002, students travelling to the University of Lethbridge from the corner of University Drive and Columbia Boulevard had two choices to get to the University. They could travel down Valley Drive and then turn at the West Lot, travelling across the West Lot until they got to Anderson Hall or the PE Building. This was the longer option. The second option was to cut across the field, over the berm and across the Far west Lot and West Lot. This was the shorter option—albeit muddier in the winter and when it rained.  In 2002, the University of Lethbridge decided to pave the path students had worn down across the field and over the berm. They also added lighting. This made sense. After all, why not create a paved, lighted path right where people will use it?  As I reflected on this, it caused me to wonder why so many people do not do this when setting up information architecture on a website. So many websites make it very hard to find things. I do not know what the developers were thinking when they put it together, but I do know what they were not thinking. They were not thinking about the value in holding focus groups and watching how visitors use the website and what paths they try to access information.  So many developer think, "Oh, this looks cool" or "This looks good to me", and give no thought that it needs to be cool and work; it needs to look good to you and everyone else.  If there is one thing website developers need to get into their thick, obtuse, close-minded heads, it is this:  websites need to work for your users more than they need to work for you .

      Microsoft released Windows XP Service Pack 2 yesterday. Part of the service pack includes updates to Internet Explorer.   On the plus side, IE now  urlLink comes with  a native pop-up blocker. It also requires user authentication for drive-by downloads. Another cool feature is the “Add-On Manger”, which is similar to Firefox’s extensions manager.  On the minus side, these improvements are only for Windows XP users. As well, there appears to be no change in its level of compliance with web standards. Of course, there is still no tabbed browsing.  The  changes are welcome, but I do not know why IE is so intent on letting the competition slowly gain market share. Microsoft seems unusually content in its current market share of the web browser market, but its failure at innovation and adoption of web standards and consumer-drive conventions is causing a slow but steady exodus to better products.  I will stick with  urlLink Firefox  at home.

      Dar Heatherington announced he resignation yesterday.   She decided that even though she disagrees with the city council’s tactics, she would resign to reduce the stress on her family. Coincidentally, her last day is also the day of her sentencing trial.  As far as the Lethbridge municipal elections, this is the first inkling Lethbridge citizens have of an guaranteed empty spot on city council. As I noted previously, Bob Tarlek and Barb Lacey have announced they are staying on. I also noted that Ken Chapman seems intent on trying for a space on council again. Maybe he has more than one platform this time.

      A cyclist in Lethbridge was charged with a traffic violation yesterday. I would have posted a link to the Lethbridge Herald article, but their website sucks and the article is not there. Even if it were, it would be gone tomorrow.   Anyhow, the person was northbound and ran into a car exiting a parking lot on the west side of the street. In other words, he was driving on the left hand side of the road. He has been charged with not keeping to the right hand side of the road.  Serves him right. Cyclists are not immune to the rules of the road. We should not be riding on the sidewalk. We should not be riding on the wrong side of the road. We should not ride through a crosswalk. We should not ride through a stop sign or red light without stopping. The list goes on actually.  Oh, and to top it off, the person was not wearing a helmet. So now, my tax dollars are paying for his care and stay in the hospital. All a result of his stupidity.

      After two years as a counsellor in the young men presidency (and as acting young men president in our ward), I received a new calling today.   I was called as the ward clerk. The previous ward clerk lost his job and relocated to another job in a different city. He actually moved in June and the high councilman contacted and called me on Thursday. A bit long, but apparently the stake presidency and high council meet infrequently in the summer months.  Technically, I am still serving in my previous calling, as I was not released. The bishopric has a person ready to call, but were waiting to hear back from the stake regarding my call. Apparently, they didn't have enough time to contact this individual before today to call him. As a result, I have not been released.  I hope the release will take place next Sunday, as there is a four-day Scout camp coming up next week and I would rather not having my arthritis aggravated from it. If I do go, I'll end up limping for 3-4 days after I get back because of the arthritis, and I may not be able to bike to work. I guess we'll see.  For the interest of anyone who cares, here is a list of the callings I’ve had since we've been married.  Elders quorum presidency, second counsellor (Surrey First Ward)   Elders quorum presidency, president (Surrey First Ward)   Ward mission leader (Lethbridge Ninth Ward)   Stake mission presidency, secretary (Lethbridge Alberta West Stake)   Young men presidency, second counsellor (combined Lethbridge First and Second Wards; also served as acting young men president in Lethbridge First Ward)   Assistant stake clerk (Lethbridge Alberta Stake)   Ward clerk (Lethbridge First Ward)

      I received an email recently from Dr. Grant Hardy, an associate professor and chairman of the History Department at the University of North Carolina at Asheville. It was in regards to the post I made about the new Book of Mormon design by Doubleday Books.   Dr. Hardy actually designed a different version of the Book of Mormon called the   urlLink The Book of Mormon: A Reader's Edition  . And this one seems to be even more intriguing than the one Doubleday’s putting out.   urlLink Doubleday’s version  looks cool with its new colours and fonts and will be an easier read with it’s new footnote-free reading, but  The Book of Mormon: A Reader's Edition  also has some cool features that really excite me.   The Book of Mormon: A Reader's Edition  uses as its base the 1920 text of the Book of Mormon. It includes familiar paragraphs, quotation marks, topical headings and multi-chapter headings. Poetry in the Book of Mormon is formatted in poetic form. Quoted text is indented, biblical prophecies are italicised and the verse number have been made smaller.   It also features a hypothetical map based on internal references, an essay on Book of Mormon poetry, a full glossary of names, genealogical charts, a basic bibliography of Mormon and non-Mormon scholarship, a chronology of the translation, eyewitness accounts of the gold plates, and information regarding the lost 116 pages and significant changes in the text.   Dr. Hardy also offers a brief but comprehensive explanation of the Book of Mormon and its history.  Oh, I can’t wait to get this one.

      My boss came into my office yesterday with a special gift. It was something I’ve been wanting for a very long time (okay only since this past March).   It was  urlLink Web Standards Solutions  by  urlLink Dan Cedarholm . I’ve been following Dan’s blog ever since I came across a few of his articles on  urlLink ALA  ( urlLink Mountaintop Corners  and  urlLink Faux Columns ). He always has some quick and slick CSS tricks that I enjoy testing and even implementing.  When I first came across his blog, the thing that really drew me was the  urlLink SimpleQuiz . It consisted of over 15 questions regarding how to code a specific element (such as a list of chocolate bars or breadcrumb navigation) in HTML. Each question was comprised of four suggestions and then he would ask his readers which of the four solutions they would pick. After each question received a significant number of questions, he’d post the findings.  It’s a very useful resource for knowing what the semantic method for coding specific elements.  The nice thing is that his book is set up the same way. At least what I have read so far seems to be. However, even better than this is that after each “quiz” in the book, Dan provides extra credit pages related to the answer. For example, for the list question, he provides a number of different techniques (such as Mini-Tab Shapes) to stylise a list.  I am not at all disappointed that my boss decided to let me have it. It is an amazing resource.  Now if I can just convince him to let me have  urlLink Defensive Design for the Web  by  urlLink 37signals .

      I took a  urlLink survey  yesterday that asked questions regarding religious beliefs. The idea is that after you’ve taken the quiz, it will analyse your answers and tell you which religious movement your beliefs more closely resemble.   Not surprising to anyone—well except maybe those who think I question too much or who consider me a heretic—the quiz said my 100 percent of my beliefs corresponded with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.  Here are the remaining findings.  Jehovah's Witness (97%)   Bahá'í Faith (94%)   Orthodox Judaism (83%)   Sikhism (77%)   Mainline - Liberal Christian Protestants (72%)   Mainline - Conservative Christian Protestant (71%)   Islam (70%)   Jainism (69%)   Liberal Quakers (62%)   Hinduism (60%)   Eastern Orthodox (58%)   Roman Catholic (58%)   Reform Judaism (57%)   Seventh Day Adventist (57%)   Orthodox Quaker (56%)   Unitarian Universalism (55%)   Mahayana Buddhism (52%)   Theravada Buddhism (51%)   Christian Science (Church of Christ, Scientist) (39%)   Neo-Pagan (36%)   New Age (33%)   New Thought (25%)   Taoism (25%)   Secular Humanism (23%)     Scientology (21%)   Non-theist (19%)  Some interesting results. For example, I find it interesting that my answers put me closer to Baha’I, Judaism and Sikhism than it does to mainline Christian Protestants. I also found it interesting that my answers put me closer to Islam, Jainim, Quakers and Hinduism than it did to Catholicisim.

      I downloaded Firefox two days ago. What a cool browser.   I ditched Internet Explorer at home a few moths ago for Netscape. Every time I opened IE for the first time, it would take nearly a minute to load the first page. That was simply unacceptable and since I could not find the problem, I simply switched to another browser.  While I was using  urlLink Netscape , I became addicted to tabbed browsing. It has come to the point where I detest using IE at work because I always have to open new windows instead of new tabs. There were some other cool features as well.  I heard a lot about  urlLink Firefox  and decided to try it. It was a nice download; less than a minute on DSL. It automatically imported my Netscape bookmarks, favourites, links and passwords. Very cool.  After I installed it, I checked out all the  urlLink extensions  that were available. Wowee. What a find. Now, not only do I have tabbed browsing, but I have the following:   Tabbed browsing manager   Drag and drop tabs to the order you want   Undo closed tabs   Target="_blank" links open in new tab   URLs typed in address bar open in new tab   Links clicked on from email or IM open in new tab   Some other cool features include GMail notification, spell check (similar to IESpell), web developer toolbar, auto search by typing words, view source for a selection of text, mailto links open in the e-mail application I indicated as my system’s default application. The list goes on.  I am never going to another browser.

      George W. Bush gave an address today "at the signing ceremony for a $417 billion defense spending bill". During the address, he  urlLink said something  that seems odd, and that many anti-war supporters would consider accurate.    Our enemies are innovative and resourceful, and so are we. They never stop thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people, and neither do we.   Is this guy for real? Does he write his own stuff?

      An experience earlier this week established for me that electronics manufactures need a lesson in usability and accessibility. It also helped solidify my conviction to make my websites more accessible.   We rented a  Hello Kitty  DVD Monday for our children to watch. As usual, I turned on the TV, popped in the DVD and went to switch to "Game" mode, which allows the output from the DVD player to display on the TV.  Nothing happened.  I started my troubleshooting A/V products process.  1.	Repeatedly pres the button 2.	Press random buttons repeatedly 3.	Move closer to TV 4.	Repeat steps 1-3  The process put me no further ahead to determining the problem. This left me to think either the batteries were dead or the TV was malfunctioning. Here is where things became frustrating.  My remote control does not have a batter indicator. My cell phone does. My PocketPC does. My digital camera does. Nearly every electronic device I own that runs on batteries has a battery indicator to let me know when the batteries are low. The remote control did not. Why is this a problem?  First, I had no forewarning there was a power supply issue with my remote control. Had I known the batteries were getting low, we could have bought some batteries when we were out shopping earlier hat day.  Secondly, without any forewarning, I am doomed to experience a barrier at the exact time I do not want it. I want to use the DVD, but because of this unforeseen barrier, I cannot.  It is no different from a wheelchair-bound customer no being able to get past a store’s front step or a blind person not being able to read text on a website that is only available in an image. As I wanted to watch the DVD, both of these individuals also want something. The wheelchair-bound person would like to purchase something from the store and the blind person wants information from the website. Yet because of barriers unforeseen by businesses, the three of us cannot access the things we wanted.  This is only one part of the frustrating equation.  If I am using my computer and the mouse stops working, I can usually navigate through many application with only my keyboard. The software creators allowed more than one method of input.  Not so with the TV manufacturer. There is no "Game" button on the TV. In fact, all I can do with the TV is turn it on or off, scroll through the channels one at a time linearly, bring up the settings menu and raise or lower the volume. Most of the features of the TV, however, are only accessible with the remote control. If the remote is not working, then the TV is only partially accessible.  Since I couldn’t check if there was a problem with the TV—although someone could argue given what I’ve mentioned there was something inherently wrong with the TV—my only other choice was to take the batteries out of our phone (we had no other AA batteries in the house), put them in the remote, go back to the living room and try the remote again.  Luckily it worked. But did I have to experience all this frustration just to find out my batteries were dead? Is it any wonder why I support accessible websites?

      Eve Tushnet, a freelance journalist and editor of the Web site marriagedebate.com, recently had  urlLink her review  of the book titled  Gay Marriage: Why it is Good for Gays, Good for Straights, and Good for America  by Jonathan Rauch printed in the New York Post. He review brings up a good point, or at least a noteworthy point.    "Gay Marriage" is at its strongest discussing couples — and at its weakest discussing children. The chapter (there's only one) on children is tellingly titled "Married, Without Children." It deals exclusively with claims about sex and procreation — pointing out, for example, that infertile couples can marry — while remaining silent about motherhood and fatherhood.   It seems to me that many of the opponents of SSM maintain that marriage is designed for procreation, and, as such, indirectly responsible for a moral and upright society (through child raising).  Yet, I am wondering if this is not the case. It would seem to me that marriage is not about children. It is about two people who love each other and want to provide for each other’s mental, social, spiritual, physical and emotional needs. On the other hand, it would seem families—not marriages—are designed for procreation and the indirect establishment of moral and upright societies.  After all, there are many marriages without children and many families without marriages (e.g. single mothers, divorced parents) or that exist not as a direct result of marriage (e.g. adopted children).  At the same time, this sort of separation may bring up new issues.

      Speaking of record-breaking, I broke another personal record on my way home today.   As I  urlLink mentioned yesterday , during this morning's commute, I dismounted at the fork. I was actually surprised I made it, since I really had to push myself to make it around the bend.  I hoped given how hard it seemed that I could make the same distance on the way home that I did yesterday.  By the time I went past the guardrail on the way home up Whoop-up Drive, I knew I could probably make it to the same spot I did yesterday. When I arrived at the spot, I still felt I had it in me to go a little further, so I decided to go to the next streetlight (about 30 metres or so). When I arrived at it, I figured I could make it to the next one.  Then it hit me. There were only three more streetlights until the top of Whoop-up Drive, so I decided I would go for it. Sure enough, I made it. My legs were killing me by the time I got to the top of Whoop-up Drive, but I did it.  I couldn't believe it. And here I thought yesterday that I could probably get to the top of Whoop-up Drive by the end of the month. Little did I know it would be the next day.  I think I'm going to take my chances with the gravel-like Northwest Lot path tomorrow. It's pretty hard underneath and the gravel is pretty shallow, not like a real gravel road. I'll be going pretty slow anyhow since I'll be in the lowest or second lowest gear at the fork. Even if I do fishtail, I won't bite it.  At the same time, the way to the University of Lethbridge is a harder climb since I have to start at the river bottom. At least with Whoop-up Drive, I can start on the pedestrian bridge, which gives me a better advantage.  I don't expect to make it to the top tomorrow, given that it's steeper and longer, but hopefully—if the gravel doesn't beat me—I can make it significantly further than the fork.  Oh, the day when I don't have to dismount.

      The police said that Mark Hacking's co-worker said that Mark Hacking said that he killed his wife. Or so the media is reporting.   The way I wrote it sounds semi-ridiculous, but that is exactly what it is. I am not questioning the reliability of the witness—the police seem confident in his/her reliability—but I wonder sometimes if the public is so blood-thirsty and revengeful that the media is doing what they can to feed it. Even if it means using a third-party confession, rather than a first person confession as an indication of guilt.  This brings me to my next point. Given the  urlLink mounting collection of evidence  against him—including his co-workers alleged testimony—why has Mark not confessed himself? It is a possibility that the police have yet to approach him with this information, but it is unlikely. It is also a possibility that Mark is holding out for some reason.  If he is convicted—which is not the same thing as being arrested—on aggravated murder, it makes me wonder something. Actually, even if he is not convicted, a host of other parallel cases make me wonder the same thing. Short of having a mental disorder, how can a man get to the point where he wants to kill his wife?  Maybe that is just it. Maybe he does have a mental disorder. Granted, I have been known to have told the occasional lie in the last three decades, but none of them have ever consumed me to the point that my whole lifestyle revolved around them. None of them have ever consumed me to the point where I would be willing to do  absolutely anything  to make sure the lie is not uncovered.  I love my wife. I love her very much. We have a great marriage. Given that we have seen a number of friends and acquaintances have their marriages fall apart in the last ten years, we regularly feel grateful we have been able to weather many of the same problems these couple have faced. We have never yelled each other. We never swear at each other or call each other names. Our disagreements are always civil. The thought of ever killing Mary is completely unfathomable to me.  Does this mean that if Mark did not have a mental disorder, then the other explanation is that his marriage was a shambles? It certainly does not seem that way. From all accounts, their marriages seemed blissful.  Whatever the reason, the whole situation is somewhat depressing and genuinely discouraging.

      Today was a good day. It was a record-breaking day.   I managed to make it to the fork today, which is about 50-60 metres further than I have ever made it before. I could have made it further along the path that goes up to the Northwest Lot, but the road is much deteriorated and consists of nothing more than a thin layer of asphalt covered by eroded asphalt, amounting to a lot of gravel. Gravel is the enemy of the road bike.  The path to the 6th Level isn’t much better since it amounts to nothing more than steep switchbacks. I would have made it maybe a metre or two.  Instead I simply dismounted at the fork and walked up the Northwest Lot path as usual, but this time content knowing I beat my record and significantly reduced my travel time.  I had some gear problems that I fixed over the weekend, so I think that really helped make it up the hill. As well, I found last week that if I swerve from the right side of the path to the left side of the path, I could make it further up the path than if I approached the incline head on.  I think I will stop at the fork from now on until I can acquire a mountain bike for the gravel or until I feel sufficiently fit to tackle the switchbacks.  UPDATE: On my ride home, I managed to increase my distance covered to include an extra three street lights. I estimate this to be about 90 to 100 metres. Definitely more than I expected, and it gives me encouragment to think I may be able to make it to the top of Whoop-up Drive—without having to dismount—by the end of the month.

      I received an email this afternoon from a reporter with Salt Lake City’s KUTV. S/he wanted information on Mark Hacking.   Apparently, the media is a bit impatient for real news and are grasping for anything to report. This reporter claims there are rumours that Mark left his mission early and asked me to provide “solid information about...what happened during his mission”.  S/he gave no indication why s/he was contacting me or why s/he considered me any sort of source for this information. I can only assume it was because s/he came to my LDS Canada website. S/he must have assumed that the Canada Winnipeg Mission covers all of Canada and/or that all 160,000 Latter-day Saints (including me) in Canada know everything that happens in the eight missions and more than fifty stakes throughout the country.  I am not sure what disgusts me more: the media’s attempt to pull Mark through the mud (I am refusing to assume he is guilty with only circumstantial evidence) by extrapolating on rumours of his past, or the ignorance of this American reporter to the structure of the Church in Canada.

      Today is a holiday in Canada. Each province calls it something different. Alberta calls it Heritage Day and there are ethnic/multicultural based events throughout the province.   We decided to spend the holiday by spending most of the time as a family. We also went to the Lethbridge Heritage Day Festival at Enmax Centre. We’ve been going since Sinéad was a baby. I believe there were only two years we didn’t attend.  One of the most popular parts of the Lethbridge Heritage Day Festival is the various food booths. They open up at 11:00 when the doors are open and all the popular tables are out of food by noon. The last couple of times we’ve gone, we’ve arrived too late and missed the good food.  We arrived at 11:25 this morning and had our pick of the tables. We decided to avoid the Italian and Hungarian tables since the line-ups were very long. From a distance, I saw The Dutch Canadian booth, and  urlLink being Dutch myself , I decided to go over.  There was not a whole lot for Mary—given the restrictions she’s implemented in her diet—so she didn’t have anything. Sinéad, Regan and I each had a bun with beef  kroketten , which very tasty. I also had a piece of a spice cake that had a licorice flavour.  I’m glad we went. I am very glad we bought some food too.

      I've redesigned my blog and thought I'd post this for anyone who didn't notice or anyone who's reading this on an RSS feeder.   Nothing against Doug Bowman; he's an excellent designer and I love his stuff (especially his photos). However, I felt that as a designer, I should be using my own design and not a template developed by another designer.  So there you go. For those interested, I used a photo from our camping trip for the top image and used the colours from above for the colour palette.  If I feel so motivated, I'll post the photo I used for the inspiration.  UPDATE: Here's the photo I used as the source for the banner image.     From left to right are Sinéad, her cousin Senthia, Regan, and their cousin Terry. Senthia's brother Darien and father Curt are in the background. It's at the pool at Sherwood Forest, near Regina, SK. The original image is 2560x1920. I used a 640x100 area near Regan's shirt and water wing.

      During Alma the Younger’s sermon to the poor of Antionum, he extrapolated on the foundation of what faith is.   ...faith is not to have a perfect knowledge of things; therefore if ye have faith ye hope for things which are not seen, which are true.    I wonder though how this can be. If something has to be true for you to have faith, how can you know that thing is true? Wouldn’t such knowledge nullify the faith then?  Let’s take for example the existence of God. By Alma’s definition, God needs to be true—or exist—in order for me to have faith in Him. Yet, how can I know in advance He exists—is true—before I have faith in Him?  You might say, “Joseph Smith, Moses and others saw him and testify of him”. Absolutely, but I wasn’t there with them, so I have to have faith in their words or testimonies. However, that brings us back to knowing something is true before having faith in it. I would need to know that what Joseph Smith, Moses and others claimed were true before I can have faith in their words.  I have no problems with faith amounting to a belief in something that cannot be seen. However, throwing in the “truth aspect” seems to be throwing a wrench into the whole definition.
