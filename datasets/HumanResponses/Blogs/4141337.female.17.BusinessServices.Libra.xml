                Family is hard to live with, but you could never live without them. I have the whiney brother, the mom in college, and the working daddy. Yeah my mom works too. My brother and I get along pretty well, we don't fight (very often). I love being part of my family, but don't tell them that. I mean I have my hateful days.......er....um.....well......weeks, but anyhow... they somehow put up with me. I am proud to have my daddy. Yes, I publicly say daddy. He tries really hard, and a person has to give him credit because I have not been a perfect daughter. Hey who is perfect? I appreciate the family that God has gifted me with. Eventhough I don't like it my parents tell me to do the dishes, or clean my room (oh that one gives me goosebumps), but I do love them and I hope to one day marry someone just like my daddy. Have children similar to my brother, maybe a little less aunrey, and I'll keep my mom around so she can help me raise my children just as well as her and my daddy have raised me and my little brother. Not everyone has parents like mine, and sometimes I take them for grantid, but nothing can replace the love that I have for them.

                 My best friend is Stephanie. Most friends come and go as they please, they use you then go on their way. Stephanie is different, we have been best friends for almost 9 years now. I love her to death. We have been through so much together. Through thick and thin, she has always been there for me. She stands behind me 100% all the time, sadly even when I'm wrong. I support her 100%, again sadly when she's wrong. Though were hardly ever wrong. (wink, wink). We have already decided that we will always be there for eachother. Something that separates me and Stephanie from the wrest of the world is that we hardly ever argue. We talk out and issue and work it like that. Our friendship is strong, and very important to me. I plan to always be there for her. I believe in our friendhip, and I trust our friendship. People like her only come around once in a lifetime. So while I'm enjoying my best friend in the world, everyone else can have crappy ones. A person, I don't remember who, once told me that "A friend is the person who walks in the door when the wrest of the world has walked out." Stephanie lives in the doorway, and I never complain. If a person tried to tell me that she isn't a good friend, then I would have to ask them what a good friend is.
