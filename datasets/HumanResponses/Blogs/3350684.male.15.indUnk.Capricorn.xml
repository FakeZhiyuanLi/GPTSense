      well, first post.. me is damn lonely, bored and tired... y dun i have any luck wif gals? m i really tt bad? well, maybe its because of my ugly and boorish looks and also cause of my sucky character, but since no one tell me, i can't noe for sure... well, actually it is suppose to be a happy day, afterall, its 2 weeks before the exams finally come to a close.. but then again i haven't been studying for the 2 weeks; i m online all day.. i m addicted and i need some counselling.. and since i nv study, i dun tink i will get good grades.. haiz.. they have been dropping since the start of tis year.. well, last time i got an A for my physics but now it had dropped.. common test- 4/30, cool huh? my bio also got last in class.. chemistry, well i got an A1 but it is an weak A1, so there is a risk of dropping.. my other subjects huh? well, lets not mention it.. i tink i better give up on gals and become gay.. but then again, i always thought i was one.. hmmz lets move on.. my targets and dream for tis year? well, firstly i hope to do well in 'O' levels(impossible because i play everyday), and also to build up a muscular body(to make gals, especially tt b**** drool).... well, i promise i will put in effort!
