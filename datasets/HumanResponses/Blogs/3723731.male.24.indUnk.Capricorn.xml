      So I was just sitting here thinking..."Where in the heck did June go???" I serioulsy don't know how time flew so fast. It just seemed like yesterday was June 1st. I swear the summer goes by entirely too fast! Anyway, so here's the rundown of what happened today. Got up and went to work and did entirely too much paperwork. Then after I got off work I came home and changed clothes then met Pete at the gym to lift. Tonite we worked on legs and lemme tell ya it HURT!!! My legs felt like rubber and I could barely walk! Then after working out I came back home and changed clothes and freshened up so I wouldn't be sweaty and smelly anymore. Then I headed back to Pete's place where I had this amazing Ziti that he made! It was so good and definitely hit the spot after a good hard workout! After dinner we both went over to one of our former co-workers house to load up a treadmill for our other co-worker Ramey. And this treadmill was heavy! And since my legs were already in bad shape it made it that much harder to haul around! After loading it up we followed Ramey back to her house and unloaded the sucker. By this time Pete and I were extra wore out so we told Ramey goodbye and headed back home. Although this doesn't sound like the most exciting day in the world it was definitely a humorous day! Oh the sights Pete and I saw driving around in beautiful Marion and Gas City! People make me laugh so much!!! :o) I am now doing laundry and waiting for it to dry so I can fold it and then head to bed. Unfortunately I have to be up at like 6:00am tomorrow cuz I have a mandatory meeting and then I'll be gone with one of my clients all day because he's going to a children's home. Well I'm done writing for now. Hope you all had a great day! Till next time........

      Saturdays are a beautiful thing! There's no other day of the week when you can sleep in, get out of bed at 11 or 12, eat something, lay around, watch some tv, read, or do whatever you want and have no schedule pressing or have appointments to be at with people breathing down your neck! And I love Friday nights as well! Last nite was a great nite. I got home from work, took a little nap, and then Amy called and wanted to know if I wanted to go out with her and Mollie to Kokomo to eat at Panera and then get some coffee at Starbucks. How could I pass up that offer?! I couldn't say NO! So we went to Panera and ate and lemme tell ya'll that if you haven't ate there you need to cuz it's awesome! Then after that Amy wanted to go to the "Shoe Carnival" to find some new shoes (as if she needed another pair!). And can I just say that I hate the "Shoe Carnival"?! Granted they have a great selection of shoes, but I hate the atmosphere in that place! First of all they have this oldie music playing at a high volume that just drives me crazy. Then they have this person who interrupts the music I can't stand announcing that they have this great sale going on blah, blah, blah.... This announcement never fools me, but for most people in the store it does. After the announcement is made people go running around like chickens with their heads cut off grabbing as many shoes as possible. I wish I had a video camera to tape them all so they could see how smart they look. Ha ha! This running and scrambling around then leads to why the store looks the way it does....Shoes are strung everywhere, boxes are half open, you can't find the size you need cuz everything is mixed up, etc. Does anyone know what I'm talking about or am I just plain crazy?! And it doesn't matter if I'm in that store for 5 minutes or or an hour I always come out of there in a bad mood and in desperate need of some Prozac or something! Hey if you like the store take no offense to what I just said. I'm just simply saying that I can't stand that place!!! Anyway, after that we went to the mall and looked around which put me at ease somewhat. And then for the best part of the nite...STARBUCKS!!! I am addicted to that place! And I always get the same thing, a caramel frappucino...mmmmm!!! And I like the atmosphere of that place too...Laid back music playing, cool decorations inside, and the wonderful smell of coffee everywhere! So while we're in there drinking our coffee and chatting and having a good time Amy needed to go get a napkin or something. So she gets up to get the napkin and when she comes back she just starts telling the most random story about some guy staring at her with a pot of coffee in her hand or something. After she finishes the story I have no clue as to what she just said, but I wasn't going to say anything and just pretend that I understood, but Mollie speaks up and was like "What the heck are you talking about?!" And then I lost it! I just bust out laughing cuz Mollie said exactly what I was thinking! Amy became confused at this point because in her mind her story made perfect sense. Mollie and I on the other hand thought she had stepped into a time warp and was transported to another world where this "experience" happened to her. So Mollie and I continued to laugh for awhile while Amy remained confused. It was GREAT! Then we drove home and I chilled for awhile back at my apartment and read some of my new Relevant magazine and chatted to some friends on AIM and then I hit the sack and didn't wake up until like 10:30 this morning. BEAUTIFUL!

      So this is the first time I've ever done anything like this so it's all new to me! So please be patient with me as I learn how to master this amazing technology! Ha ha! Anyway, so work was okay today. Had a few rough moments which is to be expected when you do social work for a living. But only by the grace of God do I make it through each day and come back for more the next day!! After work I usually go to the gym and lift with my good friend Pete, but that didn't happen tonite. We were both feeling tired and lazy so we just decided to skip tonite. Have no fear though cuz we're definitely hittin' it hard and heavy tomorrow nite and for the rest of the week as well. Tonite I had Amy and Mollie over to watch our weekly favorite show of "Newlyweds". I'm not sure why I like that show so much....I think it's because I think I'd act like Nick if I were married. He's just so honest and says what's on his mind and I think that's the way I'd be too. Anyway, it's a funny show and for the most part it's clean so I like watching it. Well hopefully I'll be getting some pics and stuff on here real soon to spice things up. Any comments or suggestions would gladly be welcome! Hope to hear from you all soon! :o)

      So I went and saw "The Village" Friday night and I'm not sure what to think of it! I mean it just didn't seem like typical M. Night Shyamalan stuff to me. So has anyone else seen this movie and if so what did you think of it?! Let me know cuz I'd love to discuss it!!! Well that's all for now......I'll update this thing soon cuz I haven't written in forever and I apologize for that! I'm gonna do better! :o)  Okay I gotta jet! Peace!

      Well this has been one heck of a holiday! It started Saturday nite when I went out with Pete, Meggan, and Amy. First we all went to see Spiderman and that was an awesome movie!!! Ya'll definitely gotta go see that if you haven't yet! Then we went bowling which was quite an adventure. See it's been forever since I bowled! A bunch of us went bowling after prom one time, but everyone was just goofing off and not taking it seriously so we really didn't bowl like it's supposed to be done. So I had no idea of how to play the game or anything when we first started so everyone got a good laugh at Kevin trying to bowl. Luckily as the game went on I progressively got better which made me very happy! :o) We played two games and I came in third on the first game and then I came in second on the second game we played! So overall I was very pleased with my effort and how well I did considering I had never done it before. And I have to admit that I kinda played dirty....I was trying to psych everyone else by saying they'd throw the ball in the gutter or by telling them that they weren't as good as they thought they were. Yeah, yeah...I know that's bad, but I had to do something cuz everyone else had bowled before! Needless to say it was great fun! We all laughed and had a good time and everyone walked away happy :o)   Well after all that hard work bowling we decided that we were hungry so we went and ate at Applebees. And the fun continued....we all had a good time eating and talking trash to each other about what good bowlers we were. We also celebrated Pete's birthday because he was gonna turn 28 on Sunday the 4th! He's on old man, but he's cool nonetheless ;o) After eating we all parted ways and I came home and hit the sack cuz I was tired and wore out!  Then on Sunday I decided to stay home and have some time alone with God myself. It was a great time and God spoke to me so clearly. I had all these things on my mind and these questions that needed to be answered and during my time with Him he took care of all of those things. I just love spending time with the Lord! He's so real and cares so much about His people that He'll meet with us whenever and wherever we'll allow Him to. Then I went out with Amy and her mom, David, and TJ for lunch and had some awesome barbecue chicken pizza from Mancino's....mmmmmmm! Then we all went straight to the Gas City 4th of July Parade and let me say that that was the most exciting parade I've ever been to! (yes that was a sarcastic statement!) I guess that it was a good parade for Gas City, but I 've seen much better. Although the parade wasn't that great it was still fun getting to spend time with Amy, Teresa, David, and TJ. We all had a good time together and laughed a lot as usual. :o) After the parade Amy and I took TJ home and then came back to my apartment to watch "The Mothman Prophecies". This was a good movie! Definitely kinda freaks you out since it's based on actual events. Check it out if you haven't seen it yet! Amy then went to a cookout at her friend's house and I hung out at the apartment and talked to my best friend back home, Jeremy, for awhile and then talked to my amazing friend Becky for awhile as well.  Now for the scary stuff...Amy comes back and picks me up and we head to see the fireworks that Marion does every year at the park. Amy, me, Steve, Jolee, and Aaron all rode together and followed Jolee and Aaron's parents to see the fireworks. We all had a good time talking and watching the fireworks. And let me say that getting ate up by the mosquitoes was a great time too! Mosquitoes are such evil creatures!!! I definitely feel no remorse smashing them when I feel their intolerable bite upon my skin! Anyway, after the fireworks we were all inspired to go get our own and shoot them off. We went to this place off the bypass and as soon as we walked in we were greeted by this pleasant man screaming that they were closing in 13 minutes! So we hurried around the place and got some sparklers, bottle rockets, killer bees, and some funky spinner things. And can I just say that the names of fireworks has come a long way since I was a kid. Some of the names of these fireworks were just ridiculous! One firework was called "We are America, We Kick A**!" Doesn't that just inspire you all?? I mean I shed a tear after reading that wonderfully patriotic title! There was also another firework called "Bad A**". Does anyone else find this odd cuz I sure do?!?! After buying our fireworks we went back to Jolee's and decided to shoot them off by her lake. This is the point where some of us (if not all of us at one point and time) almost lost our lives! First we start off with some sparklers that seem pretty harmless, but lemme tell ya they are not! When those things light they explode in heat and light and I think every single one of us burned the end of our thumbs. Then we decided to do bottle rockets. Well instead of putting them in the sand by the lake and letting them take off like they're supposed we all decide to light them and throw them (not smart I know!). So we're start lighting them and throwing them and everything is ok until Steve decides to hold one and let it take off from his hand! Well the thing takes off and the fuse backfires in his face shooting hot sparks into his eye and onto his shirt. Well needless to say he immediately grabbed his eye and groaned and someone (I can't remember now) ran over and took care of his shirt that was still burning and now has holes in it. Of course he tried to play it off all cool like he wasn't hurt, but I know that burning hot sparks in your eye would not feel good! So after we saw that he was semi-okay we continued playing with the bottle rockets. Since we were near a lake we decided it would be fun to throw the bottle rockets in after lighting them to see if they would explode under the water. So we started doing that and found out thta they did. This was kinda fun cuz it looked like someone was setting off bombs under the water and they when they exploded the made this cool sound and let off this green light. So we all decided that we would all light a bottle rocket (or two) and throw them into the water at the same time to simulate "war". Well we all lit them and tossed them in, but Amy didn't toss hers in right and the thing turned around in the water and came flying right back at us. The thing flew right between Steve and Aaron and exploded right behind them. Amy thought this was quite amusing, but I did not! I particularly don't like the idea of a bottle rocket exploding in my face. Needless to say this happened more than once so we told Amy she could no longer participate in the bottle rocket "war". Then Jolee and Aarron decided to light a box of sparklers at once and Aaron almost lost his head cuz those things exploded all at once! And there are more stories I could tell, but I think you get the point. After the night was said and done I thanked the Lord for saving my life numerous times and rested well knowing that I had escaped death. Ha ha!
