      Here is a copy of an e-mail I sent to my pastors and a few other people in my church:  I spent a lot of time writing and putting this together, I know its long but I would really appreciate it if each of you would take the time to read it for if nothing more, better understanding why I disagree with our church’s stance on homosexual marriage. Challenge what I have written, look up the Greek and Hebrew, re-read the scriptures, listen to what God is telling you. No matter what your position is on this, I hope that this helps you better understand the other side of the issue and better understand why you believe the way you do.  Thank you,  J.R. Caines    As some of you know, I do not agree with the churches position on the legality of homosexual marriage. I have received all the letters, the e-mails, sat through the announcements, now I want to explain my reasoning for disagreeing. I do agree that homosexual activity is a sin, just as much as any other sin, but it makes me sad to see it becoming such a main focus of the church lately. Jesus speaks openly and often about feeding and clothing the poor, about giving up everything, about love and grace, but he never once speaks about homosexuality. I ask you, what then should be our focus, as people who are set aside to live Christ like lives?   As you know, Biblical ignorance has become epidemic in the United States. A recent study quoted by Dr. Peter Gomes in his The Good Book found that of 1,000 Americans polled, 38% were certain that the Old Testament was written a few years after Jesus’ death and 10% thought Joan of Arc was Noah’s wife. Many people even thought that the epistles were the wives of the apostles. Often even people who love and trust God’s Word have not studied the particular Biblical texts carefully or prayerfully enough to prove or disprove their own assumptions.   For example, they don’t know that: • Jesus says nothing about same-sex behavior. • The Jewish prophets are silent about homosexuality.  • There are just six or seven verses out of the Bible’s million verses that refer to same-sex behavior in any way, and none of them refer to homosexual orientation as we understand it today.   Yet the assumption that the Bible seems to condemn homosexuality has been passed down from generation to generation with very little personal study or research. The Apostle Paul says, “Test all things and hold fast to that which is good.”   So, what may (or may not) the text be saying about homosexuality?  The following verses are used by some people to condemn homosexual relationships. Read them first to understand what they say about God, and second to understand what they might be saying about homosexuality.  1. Genesis 2:21-25 -  Let’s start “In the Beginning...” I’m so tired of reading signs carried by protesters that say: “It’s about Adam and Eve, not about Adam and Steve.” In fact, the creation story is as important to Adam and Steve as it is Adam and Eve. Whatever you think about homosexuality, gays and non-gays alike need to know and celebrate the truth at the center of this story.  This story is primarily about God, a story that the author included to show the power of God—God created the world and everything in it. We can also learn from this story that ultimately God is our Creator, that God shaped us, and said, “It’s good.” Isn’t this the heart of the text? Now what does the creation story say about homosexuality? Some people think that because it is “natural” that a man and a woman together are necessary to create a new  life, that gay or lesbian couples are “un-natural.”  They read that into the text even though the text is silent about all kinds of relationships that don’t lead to having children: • couples who are unable to have children • couples who are too old to have children  • couples who choose not to have children   • people who are single  Are these relationships (or lack of relationships) unnatural? There’s nothing said here to condemn or approve the love people of the same sex have for each other. So, I believe that the creation story says a lot about God’s power and presence in the universe and nothing about homosexuality as we understand it today.   2. Genesis 19:1-14 - The Story of Sodom - Now, let’s go on to the second main Biblical text used by some people to condemn God’s gay children. You remember the ancient story of Sodom. First, what does the story of Sodom in Genesis 19 say about God? Once again, this story is not primarily about sex. It is primarily about God. Some people say the city of Sodom was destroyed because it was overrun by sexually obsessed homosexuals. In fact, the city of Sodom had been doomed to destruction long before. So what is this passage really about? Jesus and five Jewish prophets all describe the sins that led to the destruction of Sodom and not one of them mentions homosexuality. Even Billy Graham doesn’t mention homosexuality when he preaches on Sodom.  In Ezekiel 16:48-49, the prophet says, “This is the sin of Sodom; she and her suburbs had pride, excess of food, and prosperous ease, but did not help or encourage the poor and needy. They were arrogant and this was abominable in God’s eyes.”  Today, heterosexuals and homosexuals alike do well to remember that we break God’s heart when we spend all we earn on ourselves, when we forget the poor and hungry, when we refuse to do justice or show mercy, when we leave strangers at the gate.  There are a lot of gay folk who are Sodomites (and a lot of straight folk as well). Sodomites are rich and don’t share what they have with the poor. Sodomites have plenty and want more. While millions go hungry and homeless, naked and sick, Sodomites rush to build bigger homes, buy bigger  cars, and own more property, safer stock portfolios and more secure retirement accounts. I pray for the day when our church can is willing to stand up against that kind of Sodomites because it is clear that is what Christ was more concerned about. Whatever sexual truth you can get out of this passage, be sure to learn this central, primary truth about God as well. God has called us do justice, love mercy and walk humbly with our Creator. Sodom was destroyed because the people there didn’t take God seriously about the poor, the hungry, the homeless or the outcast.  What does the story of Sodom say about homosexual orientation as we understand it today? Nothing. It was common for soldiers, thieves and bullies to rape their fallen enemy to assert their victory and to dehumanize and demean the vanquished. This act of raping or threatening to rape an enemy is about power and revenge, not about homosexuality or homosexual orientation. It is still happening today as you may have noticed by the news the last few months.   3. Leviticus 18 and 20 - In Leviticus 20:13 you will read these words: “A man who sleeps with another man is an abomination and should be executed.” On the surface, this could leave you feeling rather uneasy, especially if you are gay. But just below the surface there is an important truth about God that has nothing to do with sex. Leviticus is a holiness code written 3,000 years ago. This code includes prohibitions against round haircuts, tattoos, working on the Sabbath, wearing garments of mixed fabrics, eating pork or shell fish, getting your fortune told, even playing with the skin of a pig. (There goes football!)  “Abominations” (TO’EBAH) are offensive behaviors in a certain time and place; something people in those times considered tasteless. So what’s a holiness code? It’s a list of behaviors that people of faith find offensive in a certain place and time, in this ancient case the code was written for priests only, to set the priests of Israel over and against priests of other cultures.  To the Jews an abomination was not a law, something evil like rape or murder forbidden by the Ten Commandments. It was a common behavior by non-Jews that Jews thought was displeasing to God.  Jesus and Paul both said the holiness code in Leviticus does not pertain to Christian believers. Nevertheless, there are still people who quote that one verse about men sleeping together from the ancient holiness code to say that the Bible seems to condemn homosexuality.   4. Romans 1:26–27 - In Romans 1:26–27 the Apostle Paul describes non-Jewish women who exchange “natural use for unnatural” and non-Jewish men who “leave the natural use of women, working shame with each other.”  This verse appears to be clear. Paul sees women having sex with women and men having sex with men, and he condemns that practice. Let’s go back 2,000 years and try to understand why.  Paul is writing this letter to Rome after his missionary tour of the Mediterranean where great temples were built to honor Aphrodite, Diana and other fertility gods and goddesses of sex and passion instead of the one true God that the apostle honors. Apparently, these priests and priestesses castrated themselves, carried on drunken sexual orgies and even had sex with young temple prostitutes (male and female), all to honor the gods of sex and pleasure. The Bible is clear that sexuality is a gift from God. Our Creator celebrates our passion. But the Bible is also clear that when passion gets control of our lives, we’re in deep trouble.   When we live for pleasure, when we forget that we are God’s children and that God has great dreams for our lives, we may end up serving the false gods of sex and passion just like they did in Paul’s time. And in our obsession with pleasure, we may even walk away from the God who created us and in the process cause God to abandon all the great dreams God has for our lives. Did these priests and priestess get into this mess because they were lesbian or gay? I don’t think so. Did God abandon them because they were practicing homosexuals? No. Read the text again.  5. and 6.  I Corinthians 6:9  & I Timothy 1:10 - Paul is exasperated. The Christians are fighting among themselves in Ephesus and Corinth. (Sound familiar?) In Corinth they’re even suing each other in secular courts. Paul shouts across the distance, “You are breaking God’s heart by the way you are treating each other.” and instructed “You know very well how to treat each other from the Jewish law written on tablets of stone.”  The Jewish law was created by God to help regulate human behavior. To remind the churches in Corinth and Ephesus how God wants us to treat each other, Paul recites examples from the Jewish law first. Don’t kill each other. Don’t sleep with another man’s wife. Don’t lie, or cheat, or steal. The list goes on to include admonitions against fornication, idolatry, whoremongering, perjury, drunkeness, revelry, extortion. He also includes “malokois” and “arsenokoitai.” What’s a malokois?, What’s an arsenokoitai? Actually, those two Greek words—malokois and arsenokoitai—have confused scholars until this very day. We’ll get to them later when we ask what the texts say about sex. But first let’s see what the texts say about God.  After quoting from the Jewish law, Paul reminds the Christians in Corinth that they are under a new law, the law of Jesus, the law of love that requires more of us than not to murder, not to commit adultery, not to lie, cheat or steal. Paul tells them what God wants is not strict adherence to a list of laws, but a pure heart, and a good conscience, and a faith that isn’t phony. God doesn’t want us squabbling over who is “in” and who is “out.” God wants us to love each other. It’s God’s task to judge us. It is NOT our task to judge each other. So, what do these two texts say about homosexuality? Are we on that list of sinners in the Jewish law that Paul quotes to make an entirely different point? Greek scholars say that in first century the Greek  word malaokois probably meant “effeminate call boys.” The new Revised Standard Version says “male prostitutes.”  Greek scholars don’t know exactly what arsenokoitai means. And a good part of this tragic debate is that we don’t know. Some scholars believe that Paul was coining a name to refer to the customers of “the effeminate call boys.” We would call them “dirty old men.” Others translate it as “sodomites” and never explain what that means. Then, in 1958, for the first time in history a person translating that mysterious Greek word into English decid ed that it meant homosexuals; when in fact there is no such word in Greek or in Hebrew. But at that time, a translator decided to make the decision for all of us that placed the word “homosexual” in the English-language Bible for the very first time.  In the past, people used Paul’s writings to support slavery, segregation and apartheid. People are still using Paul’s writings to oppress women, and to limit their role in the home, in church and in society. We all need to look more closely at that mysterious Greek word arsenokoitai in its original context. I find most convincing the argument from history that Paul is condemning the Roman custom of married men (arsenokoitai) hiring young boys (malakois) for sexual pleasure just as they hired young girls for that purpose.  Anyone would join Paul in condemning those who use children for sex as much as they would join anyone else in condemning the threatened gang rape in Sodom or the behavior of the sex-crazed priests and priestesses in Rome. So, once again, this passage says a lot about God and nothing about homosexuality, as we understand it today.   The Bible is a book about God, about God’s love for the world and the people of the world. It is the history of God’s love at work rescuing, renewing, empowering humankind. It was never intended to be a book about human sexuality. Certainly, you will agree.   A young Jewish scholar asked Jesus, “What is the greatest commandment?” Quoting the prophets, Jesus replied, “The great commandment is this...to love God with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength, and the second command is like it, to love your neighbor as you love yourself.” “This is my commandment,” Jesus said, “that you love one another, as I have loved you.” On this the Bible is explicitly clear. Even if we disagree about what the Bible seems to say about homosexuality, we can agree that above all else we are commanded by the Scriptures to love God and to love each other.

      Okay, I do not want to turn this into anything, so if anyone responds to this, please do not use any harsh language towards Relevant or any member of that community.  The other day someone posted a thread talking about wanting to leave Relevant for a while to get away from people who are critical and rude and negative about other people’s posts. Then someone else responded to this leaving by pointing the finger at other people, blaming the "nOObs" (which he later edited) and later blaming me (which I have found to be a misunderstanding in the first place). I pointed out that it was post like this that were the very cause of people leaving Relevant, posts in which new people are made fun of and people act in a negative manner towards each other. Then I was blamed. I decided to take a break to let myself cool down as to not say anything I would regret. I came back today to read some posts (not post) and found myself banned. In my confusion I IMed one of the mods or admins (doesn’t matter who). I was told that I was a "problem child" and that they were "taking care of the problem". I am very sad about this because I love Relevant and the people on those boards, they all mean a lot to me. If anyone really was offended by any of my posts I am very sorry, it was never my intention. I had thought I had made significant steps towards being a more understandable person on those boards; I even had a bunch of conservatives agreeing with me on homosexual marriage ;-) But oh well. I will miss you all.

      I just bought this album last night. I really am enjoying it so far. The story telling album concept that Pedro is known for is not as strong in this album, but he still makes very blunt points about the state of society and the problems with "religion".   "you were to busy steering the conversation toward the lord/  to hear the voice of the spirit saying shut the fuck up/  you thought it must be the devil trying to make you go astray/  besides it couldn't have been the Lord because you don't believe he talks that way/"  - Foregone Conclusions  If you like David's song writing style, I would higrecommendmend this album.

      It is amazing what God uses to open our eyes. I was fuming in church yesterday after my pastor made comments about "standing up against homosexual marriage". Thoughts about political agendas not belonging in church, thoughts about what church we could go to if my wife and I left this one (my home church). It just makes me so angry.  Then out of the same mouth that had made these comments, the answer to my anger. He preached on letting God heal your hurts. About not hiding your anger, not running from your anger, and not festering in your anger but letting Christ take care of it.   Psalm 23 The LORD is my shepherd, I shall not be in want.  He makes me lie down in green pastures,  he leads me beside quiet waters,  he restores my soul.  He guides me in paths of righteousness  for his name's sake.  Even though I walk  through the valley of the shadow of death,  I will fear no evil,  for you are with me;  your rod and your staff,  they comfort me.   You prepare a table before me  in the presence of my enemies.  You anoint my head with oil;  my cup overflows.  Surely goodness and love will follow me  all the days of my life,  and I will dwell in the house of the LORD  forever.

      DAVID GRAY - Let The Truth Sting  The hour is out of joint black sun has risen and the river of words is flowing on through  the cages of tradition and they're handing out emptiness we'll take it cos it's given  free with this plastic innocence  and these standards of living  Questions lighted questions burnin' holes into my head hanging like shadows o'er the sun staring out like the eyes of the dead and sometimes my soul flickers when the wind of change blows cold over the mire of repetition down the corridors of rigmarole  What I say, what I think what I put down in ink I'm only trying to find a way to understand and I mean no harm I'm just searching for calm in the storm of mankind  Do you find it there  in the sea of faces that drowns you everyday or in the silence and rubble and empty spaces where children and rottweilers play is it buried in the praise given so cheap with a meaningless movement of the jaws in the looking glass  that flatters you or in the rattle of hollow applause  Blind circle, moon and sun body willing, mind undone one pain ending while another begins lies, ruin disease into wounds like these let the truth sting  From the hub to the limit through the urban hollows out into the poles of the extreme  to echo through the numbness of these godless minutes in the shadow of delusion's regime  And here watching the night as it opens like a flower and the day starts to rust feeling time pound like a silent hammer on this empire of dust and I'm thinking bout the bullet and the TV screen, the dollar, and the clenched fist and if we're searching for peace how come we still believe  in hatred as the catalyst  Oh through the borderline in front and behind one pain ending while another begin lies, ruin disease into wounds like these let the truth sing yeah  let the truth  And I feel it from the pit of my stomach into the ditch of my mind inside the chambers of my heart as I stare half blind at these walls of cardboard at this space that I've rented at your beauty that is crumbling though you try so hard to prevent it  On and on body willing, mind undone one pain ending while another begins lies, ruin, disease into wounds like these let the truth sting let the truth sting let the truth sting

      I was sad that Dennis Kucinich spoke early in the day and I was unable to watch it. Instead they gave a good slot to the babbling idiot Al Sharpton, I can not beleive they even let that guy speak, he makes the democratic party look bad, shut him up!  Here is a quote from Dennis' speech:  "I was mayor of Cleveland, and I tell you have seen weapons of mass destruction - - in our cities. Poverty is a weapon of mass destruction. Joblessness is a weapon of mass destruction, homelessness is a weapon of mass destruction, racism is a weapon of mass destruction, fear is a weapon of mass destruction.  We must disarm these weapons and we must turn the military budget into books, schools, teachers, housing, health care, job creation and stronger neighborhoods."  Thats good stuff, you can read the whole thing  here .  John Edwards speech was okay, it was nothing I have not heard him say 50 times before though, but good non-the-less, he is a good man.

       urlLink Barack Obama's speach  was amazing, it gave me chills. This man needs to run for presidnet someday, I think our country would be much better off with people like him in office.     "We are connected as one people. If there’s a child on the south side of Chicago who can’t read, that matters to me, even if it’s not my child. If there’s a senior citizen somewhere who can’t pay for her prescription and has to choose between medicine and the rent, that makes my life poorer, even if it’s not my grandmother. If there’s an Arab American family being rounded up without benefit of an attorney or due process, that threatens my civil liberties. It’s that fundamental belief—I am my brother’s keeper, I am my sisters’ keeper—that makes this country work."  -  Barack Obama  I also noticed that Ron Regan's speaking voice sounds exactly like his dad's. Thats all.

If I really wanted to be happy, I would seek God. Oh, but God is abstract! It takes effort to reach God. So I settle. I settle for weak amusements that require no effort. What a lazy fool I am!!" - CS Lewis

      Edgar was Mariners fans' best friend Steve Kelley / Seattle Times staff columnist  Remember the day your best friend came up to you in the elementary school hallway and said his father had been transferred and he was leaving your hometown for good?  Remember how sad you felt?  That's how yesterday was.  In a crowded interview room underneath Safeco Field, Edgar Martinez announced that, after 18 years as a Mariner, he will retire at the end of this season.  It wasn't a death in the family. It wasn't a tragedy. But it hurt anyway.  It was one of those inevitable time passages you know in your head will come, but you hope in your heart will get postponed this year and next year and the year after that.  "Today feels a little bit like a funeral," said former Mariners reliever Norm Charlton, who played with Martinez in 1993, '95-97 and 2001. "You pay tribute to Edgar the same way you do for a war hero, but you try to turn it into a celebration, not a time of mourning."  Everything good that has happened to the Mariners has had Edgar Martinez's imprimatur.  He is this franchise, the one player in the team's history every fan feels he or she knows. They lazily chant his name "Ed-guuur," every time he comes to bat.  He is a neighbor who just happened to win batting titles. He is that smiling face who became the greatest designated hitter ever.  He is the Mariners star who delivers his lines with perfect pitch in almost all of the team's award-winning commercials.  In Seattle, he simply is Edgar.  "His legacy will be felt by this organization for many, many years to come," Charlton said.  When all of the other Mariners left, Edgar stayed. Through the worst of times and into the best of times, when he could have moved, he didn't. In 1992, when the team was horrible, Edgar led the American League in hitting. In 1995, when he helped save the game in this city, he won a second batting title.  "His name is synonymous with the team," Mariners president Chuck Armstrong said in his eloquent tribute. "He is what Cal Ripken was to Baltimore, Tony Gwynn was to San Diego and Ted Williams was to Boston. It is impossible to picture Edgar in anything but a Mariners uniform."  He will forever be linked with the greatest moment in team history, the double down the left-field line he hit off Jack McDowell that beat the New York Yankees in the fifth and final game of the 1995 American League Division Series.  On that night, Mariners manager Bob Melvin was sitting at home watching like every fan and marveling at Martinez.  "It was perfect Edgar," said Melvin, a former major-league catcher with seven teams, six of them in the American League. "You know he's looking out over the plate. The ball's a little bit in and he pulls his hands in and reacts to it. I still get goose bumps when I see it.  "I've been behind the plate many a time where you think you've finally set him up so you can get him inside, then he pulls his hands in and whips one down the left-field line."  Edgar has hit 305 home runs and 510 doubles. He has driven in 1,244 runs and has a career batting average of .312.  He is so respected around the league, players on every team call him Papi.  "It is a term of endearment and respect in Puerto Rico, and Edgar has earned it," said Mariners vice president Lee Pelekoudas. "He is the kindest, humblest man you'll ever meet."  This is Edgar Martinez:  It is early in the morning in the Mariners' spring-training clubhouse in Peoria. He looks everybody in the eye when he smiles and says good morning. Then he disappears into the training room to mix up a protein shake. A reporter asks him how it tastes, and he smiles and says it tastes great.  And the next morning, he not only makes a shake for himself but he makes one for the reporter.  Of course I'll remember "The Double" that beat the Yankees, but I'll also remember the two home runs he hit in the fourth game of that series. He had seven RBI in that game. Without them there wouldn't have been The Double.  Even more important, I'll remember the small moments.  The tears that welled in his eyes when he talked about where he was and how he felt when he heard his idol, Roberto Clemente, had died.  I'll remember many times waiting by his locker stall as deadline ticked closer and closer — waiting not because he was voraciously chowing down his post-game meal but because he was finishing his elaborate and exhausting workout routine.  Edgar always was the best weapon the Mariners had, in season or offseason.  "I was trying to get Ellis Burks to come here last year," Melvin said. "Ellis had pretty much made up his mind that he was going to Boston. He had played there before, and his wife's family was from there.  "But I said to him, 'Hey Ellis, I want you to think about one thing. If you come to Seattle, you'll be able to spend a year with Edgar Martinez. If you were an art major, it's like spending a year with Picasso.' He called (former manager) Dusty Baker that night and said that affected him so much he had to think a little more about it. That's the effect Edgar Martinez has on guys."  Burks thought seriously about spending the year with Edgar before he surrendered to his family's wish to be back in Boston.  Although Edgar Martinez is the last person who would want a fuss made over him, we should feel fortunate he announced his retirement this week. Now we can come to the stadium these last two months and cheer him as if he were our neighbor and give him the thoughtful long goodbye he deserves.  We can say, "Thanks, Edgar."  Thanks for enriching our lives with your skills. And for making it feel, at times, as if you really were our best friend.

      I was thinking about this song the other day from U2 - All That You Can't Leave Behind. The song is basicaly a pleed to God to let him see the world how God does, because when he looks at the World all he sees are the bad things.  When you look at the world  What is it that you see?  People find all kinds of things  That bring them to their knees   I see an expression  So clear and so true  That changes the atmosphere  When you walk into the room   So, I try to be like you  Try to feel it like you do  But without you, it's no use  I can't see what you see  When I look at the world   When the night is someone else's  And you're tryin' to get some sleep  When your thoughts are too expensive  To ever wanna keep  When there's all kinds of chaos  And everyone is walking lame  You don't even blink now, do you?  Don't even look away   So, I try to be like you  Try to feel it like you do  But without you, it's no use  I can't see what you see  When I look at the world   I can't wait any longer  I can't wait till I'm stronger  Can't wait any longer  To see what you see  When I look at the world   I'm in the waiting room  I can't see for the smoke  I think of you and your holy book  When the rest of us choke   Tell me, tell me What do you see?  Tell me, tell me What's wrong with me?  As I was thinking I pictured a little glob in my head and I was looking down on it seeing all the bad things, armies marching across nations and planes crashing into buildings, ect. Then I started thinking about God and how he could let it go on. Then it hit me, if you look really close you can see why, you have to look past the surface, the nations, the things that go on on a major scale, look past all that to the little things. To people who love their children, to great friendships, to little boys helping old women across the street, to people smiling at oneanother as they walk past at the grocery store, to people working in a food bank, to people giving there time, and lives to help others. If you add all these things up, there is more good in this world then there is bad.  This was really encouraging to me, thought I would share.
