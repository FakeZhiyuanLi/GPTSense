      Today I went to work, and my boss responded to me. Then she was nice to me all day, but not to any of the other housekeepers that we could see. Hmm! I'm very thankful for her treatment to me, but it bothers me that others weren't treated all that well.   Well, I'll just keep praying for the whole thing. Somethin's gotta give, I say!  Earlier this week one of my uncles had a massive stroke. The amazing thing is that now he's up and walking with assistance! Plus he's trying to talk and is looking a lot better than my mom thought that he would! I can't go and visit him because of the distance and I can't get time off work because of our staff shortage. However, I'll just keep praying for him and for my aunt. I'm just totally amazed by his recovery! Of course he could still have a stroke and stuff and things could happen, but, still, God is good and has touched him wonderfully!  Just had to share. Good stuff! :)

      Hey! Just wanted to come and blow off some steam, I guess, although I don't really know what exactly to say. Yes, I trust in God and know that He's always there, and, yes, He does get us  through , and not necessarily out of, tough situations. However, I'm struggling today.  I work in housekeeping in a hotel and I don't mind the work. It's not what I want to do for the rest of my life or anything like that, but it's not bad work, even though it is tough and can be extremely busy at times.  The problem with it is my boss. If anyone has any good, constructive ideas on what to do, please let me know! I pray for her every day and it's helped  my  attitude at least. Sometimes I really notice an improvement in her, too, but it's still hard.  See, my boss is hard to get along with. A lot of mornings I go to work and she doesn't even speak a single word to me. Not a one! Not until I have to call down and tell her that one of my rooms is ready for the next guest. Even then, she's short with me and makes me feel small. I know it's nothing that I've done and I don't take it personally - usually - because she's like this with everyone. At other times she's as bright as sunshine and nothing seems to get her done.  Man, is it ever hard and confusing! I've talked to a few people about it. Mostly, though, I pray about it and pray for her. I pray that my attitude will change and that I'll keep working hard regardless of how she is. As I've said, my attitude's changed for the better. I just keep being cheerful, as much as I can, and work as hard as I can so that she doesn't have anything real to complain about me.  It does no good to go to the higher ups because they do nothing. They know how she is with us in housekeeping. With others who work there, too, and even with some of the guests at times! I can't tell her off, either, because I believe in respecting the position a person in authority holds even if I can't respect the person herself. I don't feel comfortable with telling a person off, anyway.  Anyway, just had to vent, I guess. It was really hard re:her today and I'm feeling a little better now that I've spilled my guts. Still, if anyone has any good, creative,  constructive , positive ideas I'd love to hear 'em.  Thanx and have a great day.

      Music is really amazing. There're so many different kinds for every mood and personality and taste. God knew what He was doing when He created it! Of course He did, though - He  always  knows what He's doing.  Since the last days of July I've been coming here to my church often to play the piano and to sing. I'm going to be helping with Sunday evening services this fall and want to get into the spirit of it all. So I come and play, not having a piano of my own. I love the mental challenge of learning a new song. I find it so exhilarating when I've conquered that new mountain of notes! Of course, if I know a song before I learn it on the piano it's so much easier. Then I find, though, that I don't always play according to the notes and the timing of the way it's written. I've found that I've learned a lot of songs differently than how they're actually written. Still, that's fine. If I'm playing on my own I can add my own little twist to things. As long as the message and the basics of the song don't change too much.  Today I got some news that doesn't thrill me, and for the past month or so there's been a few things on my mind in relation to work and some other stuff. These things all fade away, though, when I sing. When I sat down at the piano this evening, it all lost its power to cause me distress. I was lost in the music and in the words and nothing mattered except singing to God.  Music's always had that effect on me, even though I haven't always used it as therapy. However, now that I'm rediscovering it, I'll not forget too quickly.   There are a few songs I've discovered in the past year that have really helped me. Just the titles alone on some of them move me. "Jesus, What A Beautiful Name." "Ancient Words" (about the Bible, which I love). Those are just two. Then there are some of the old standards that I grew up with and which still have the power to move me in the right direction. "The Old Rugged Cross." "It Is Well With My Soul." "How Great Thou Art."

      Hi! I'm new here. My sis-in-law told me about this place. I think I'd heard of it a while back, but never thought to try it out. Well, now, here I am, and blog I will!  This is called    Mimi Of The Arctic    because that's who I am. "Mimi" is my family nickname, and what children call me, and I live in the Arctic, here in Inuvik, NT. It's not barren tundra here and there are tons of trees, but it is still the arctic and well above the Arctic Circle.  I have lots of thoughts on many different things, all based on how my life has gone.  For as long as I can remember I've wanted to do what Jesus wanted me to do. My mom taught me how to pray from a very early age, although I didn't always want to. When I was five I "asked Jesus into my heart" and have never regretted it.  There was a time in my life when I asked a lot of questions, such as "Why am I a Christian?" Was it because of my own decision and God's calling on my life, or was it to please my parents? Well, this last part was kind of silly because my dad wasn't even a Christian when I was five, although he did join the Family when I was eleven. When I was in grade twelve I started asking the questions and eventually came to the conclusion that it had nothing to do with my parents. It was between God and me and I rededicated my life to serving Him. This is quite a simplified version of the whole thing and I may talk about it more another time, but not today.  I'm definitely not saying that my life's been a bed of roses since. On the contrary! Oh, it's not been too terrible, either, and it's actually been very good for the most part. Still, God allows things to happen, and choices have been made. However, I'm in a new phase in my life and here I choose to remain, up in Inuvik where I'm forming relationships with people who have no prior knowledge of me before here. Oh, I didn't live what anyone would call a terrible, awful, criminal life, but it's been a fresh start for me here, away from the town in which I grew up and was slowly feeling a pull away from. So now I'm away from it and I feel wonderful!  Harbour - that's the theme I chose for my blog. To me, it was the best and was the one that appealed to me the most. I've always found peace by water. That's one reason I was totally thrilled to see that my current apartment face the East Channel of the Mackenzie river. Oh, what a wonderful view! Then when I came here and saw the theme which I chose, I knew that was the one I wanted.  I love to go for walks by the river, or whatever water's close at hand. I've always loved the water. Swimming's always been one of my favourite things to do and have no fear of water, although I do have a healthy respect for it. After all, it doesn't pay to take unnecessary risks. Still, put me near water and I'm happy.  There's something even better than the water here on earth, though, and that's the flood of the Holy Spirit over a person filled by Him. That Living Water only found through Jesus Christ is truly something else! It is in Him I find my safe harbour where I can wait out any storm and be refreshed.  There're many times I've turned to God, not knowing what else to do, and He's always brought me through. Jesus never promised us He would take us out of our troubles. Rather, He promised us a way  through  them. There's a huge difference. No, I don't like going through trouble and I'd avoid it if I could just as much as anyone else. However, I've learned a thing or two in my life, and one of them is that trouble helps form a person's character. How you deal with it really shows who you are. You can turn all bitter and take it out on the rest of the world and never real deal with it, or you can turn to Jesus and let Him help you through it. As I've already mentioned, He most likely won't take you out of it - although that has happened at times - but He will give you the strength to make it through.  Please turn to God and let Him be your harbour.
