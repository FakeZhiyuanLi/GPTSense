          urlLink    I don't get it ... M. is tired and exhausted from working so much (I can understand that) but for some reason we don't seem to be on the same page today. I don't know if it's because he's looking to be left alone and I'm looking for some company or what. We argued a bit about something ridiculous and he was being a total butt (and  not  the HoneyDew kind) and when I asked him why he wasn't listening to me he accused me of WHINING.     Good grief I hate that word. It makes me feel like a pesky-weakling with nothing better to do than complain about how bad their life is. I'm NOT at all like that. I'm not always peaches and cream and when something bothers me, I say so. When a man says that a women is 'whining', what he's really saying is "I don't have the mental capacity to carry on this conversation." They want out and the only way to do that is to insult.  Ok ... I'm done venting now. Not long after our disagreement, M. took my hand and kissed it and held it close. Good Lord, I can't stay mad at him. I used to be able to .. but now he's so far burrowed into my heart that I have no control over it anymore.   I do love him ... so very very much!    urlLink    M.

      Well, the day is slipping by and M. isn't home yet. I didn't think he would be getting off around 2 or 3 like he said. Silly boy. I've gotten all my house work done and have the laundry in the washer. For the past hour or so, I've been playing Cribbage on Pogo. The challenge this week is to win ten 121 point games. I've six so far. I'm better at the game than I thought I would be. I got a badge for that game back in January, but had to go and reread the rules to refresh my memory. I say A. on Pogo too but she wasn't on MSN and so I figured that she didn't want to be disturbed. I'm not sure how she's doing with her pregnancy and her feelings. I never know what to do. I told her if it doesn't go well, we'll scream at the world together. Just raise our heads and cry out at the unfairness. I hope they don't try again though ... it just can't be good on her body.  I did our finances today and we're doing pretty ok. I hope it stays that way. If I can manage to keep us on budget until next cycle, then I think we'll have what we need to buy the airconditioner. Thankfully the weather has been ok so far. Even if I had an AC, I wouldn't be using it right now. It's unusually cool for this time of year.      I also have to make M. get up on the roof and fix the leak over the back addition. It's leaking pretty badly .. to the point that it worries me when it rains. He should already have all the material he needs. If too much of the drywall has been damaged, then he may need to purchase a few sheets before he's done. We'll see. He assures me that he's got plans for getting it fixed. I think I'm just a worry-wart.   urlLink

      I was so happy to have my baby home lastnight. After he took a shower, we turned out the lights and just talked for a little bit. We then started kissing and touching each other - but I soon pulled away because he had to be up and read for work in only about 3.5 hours. I don't like the thought of going all day at home knowing that he's dragging butt at work because I kept him up too late. It was really nice to lay together IN THE DARK of the night instead of by the light of day. Tonight I would imagine that we'll go to bed pretty early. Today is Inventory day (D-Day) for him and there is no telling when he'll get home. I'm hoping it'll be around 2 or 3pm. I'd like for us to have dinner together. I'm sure he'll be very happy when this is over.  Today is Wednesday and after I finish up here, I will go and see the new challenges on Pogo. I played poker lastnight and was on a winning streak. Which is good because I needed to earn back the $5k I lost earlier in the day. lol.  I talked with A. for a little while lastnight on MSN and she was kind of upset ... Seems she was all happy that she hadn't started bleeding at all throughout the day and then when the evening hits, it starts up again. This is the second pregnancy she's had since I've known her and the last one only made it a short time. I wonder when they will decide to stop doing this to her body. It's not healthy and the more it happens, the more likely it's GOING to happen. I just never really realized how difficult it can be to hang on to your pregnancy. I guess I have always taken it for granted. I have no problems staying pregnant and I don't ever have any health issues. I can move around just fine and carry on with life as usual. Except for the mood swings. lol. Anyway, I wish her well - but I'm not going to emotionally invest in this until I know it's going to stick.

      My baby is home sweet home! And even EARLY! I put clean sheets and pillow cases on today and it's going to be a VERY good night indeed! No more sleeping alone! I can hardly believe how happy I am. ^_^

      M. and I were talking last night about if we thought we would ever do this again with any other friends. Not that we actually  have  any other friends. We pretty much keep to ourselves. The only other two people that we have associated with are B. (A different one) and A. (a different one) Hmmm ...  B  -  A  -  B  -  A  ... do you see a pattern here?? Anyway, I felt an attraction to B simply because of his attitude and the fact that he's not ugly. He's stocky sort of with an attitude like he's King Sh*t. It's his confidence that draws me I think. He put out the signals as well by always touching me and calling almost every day. At the time though, we hadn't even considered having sex with our friends. lol. It seemed so outside our thinking. As for A, she's to tiny ... I would be afraid of her getting hurt. lol. Also, she's so small that M would probably be able to do things with her that he can't do with me and that would make me feel bad. At one time I would have been ashamed of that feeling but I've learned that matters of the heart aren't always rational and they don't have to be to be important or justified. M would feel the same way if I did something different with someone else. Aside from all that though I don't think the safety of our current situation could really be duplicated. It has all just fell right into place and things like that are hard to recreate. And maybe down inside, I don't really want to recreate anything??

      Whew, I've gotten a lot done today. I'm looking forward to M being off at midnight tonight. No more sleeping alone! I can hardly believe it's been six weeks already. It'll be nice to get back to something normal. Also, we'll be able to have more late nights with B and A. The last two times that we've been together has been really great. There for awhile, I thought that perhaps we were getting board with each other. Or that perhaps M and I were moving on without them. I think in reality though, we were still finding our places with each other.  I've often wanted to call my sister and tell her about this whole thing, but I can't think of a way to bring it up on the phone. LOL. It just doesn't seem like something that you would say "hey guess what?" If she ever comes for a visit, I know it'll come up.     urlLink    Me, B. and A.  B has such a cute butt! Cute isn't even the right word. It's just down right sexy ... reminds me of Honeydew Melon. How funny! lol M. has a great butt too. I've always loved it. I'm a Be-Hind person and didn't even know it! Thing is, I felt that A. really started to notice B. rearend after I said something about it a few times. I could be wrong, but one thing this has done for certain, is help us to discover things about our partners that we either never knew or just forgot.    This whole experience has really helped me to get in touch with my sexuality, which in turn has built confidence which has made for a better sex life with my husband. I sometimes wonder if it has had the same affect on B. and A.? I would like to hope that they've been able to grow from this ... but I would think that it's a little more difficult for them because they don't live alone. They can't just talk openly like M. and I can. In fact, sometimes when I'm over at their house, I'll say something just like I do here and A. will have to tell me to watch what I say. I just forget so easily. At any rate, I think I look forward to our next meeting. Sometimes I do experience jealousy ... it largely depends on my mood.

      We became friends with B and A earlier this year. Once we got to know each other and discovered that we shared a lot of common ground, we began hanging out with each ALL the time. Every waking moment was spent in the company of each other. Fortunately, they have a young daughter that is around the age of our youngest one. It didn't seem that it could be more perfect. B even came over and helped my husband build a new wall in our house to create a third bedroom. So that our girls could have their own room. We ate dinner together, watched movies and were hardly without each other. We got the sense from them that they 'liked' us in a much different way than just friends. After about three weeks of intense friendship, we all decided to watch an adult movie together at our house after the kids went to bed. We did it in our bedroom so that one of the children wouldn't wake up and see something they shouldn't. Anyway, the movie wasn't on more than 20 minutes or so and things started heating up between the couples. To make a very looong story short, we began making out and having sex with our spouses right in front of each other. Then, before I knew it, the husbands were pushing me and A. together and she looked at me and said "aw come on, try something new." So, I did. We kissed and touched each others breasts and then before I knew it, her husband (B.) was kissing me. Then we split off with the other spouse and had sex. Then we all collapsed into a pile and marveled at what we had done. I don't want to give too many details as I'm not sure if it's appropriate here.   It was an amazing experience. M and I have been married for 14 years and they have been together for nearly 9 years. We all four come from long term relationships and so to be with another person outside of our marriage was really strange. Especially right there in front of each other! I can tell you this, if you can undress in front of three other people, make out and have sex with all three, it does wonderful things for your self confidence! This happened in Mid-March and here we are at the end of June. We've been together as a foursome every single weekend since then and sometimes once or twice throughout the week as well. It's really been amazing. I've learned a lot and I could have never predicted the impact it would have on my marriage ...

      M. (husband) got hom around 8 this morning and will have to go back to work at 3pm, work until midnight, come home and then return at 5am and stay until 'whenever.' Good greif, I'm glad inventory is almost over. This is the last week we'll have to deal with this. Then our lives can get back to somewhat of a normal routine.   As for now, I'm going to have to get to the store so that M. can have the car when he wakes up. See ya ...

      I can't imagine why I want to post myself out on the internet like this. I've always kept to myself. However, I've had such a remarkable past few months that I'm just screaming to share it with someone. I couldn't possibly tell anyone I know; but, we'll get to that later. At any rate ... Hello World.   12:40pm  I thought I'd write a little personal information about myself. I'm 33 and have been married to the same person for 14 years. We fell in love with each other 18 years ago; when we were just fifteen. It's been an amazing ride since. We have two daughters, one is 4 and the other is 12.   We finally bought a house a couple of years ago and have been doing repairs on it as we can. We only paid $24K for it. Can you imagine? It needed a new roof though but we did that ourselves for about $800.    urlLink        I say "ourselves" but my husband did all the work. lol. I just kept the Lemonade flowing. I did help to pick up the shingles though. Boy, what a job that was!

      I haven't cried in a long time. A very long time in fact. Matt has given me no reason to. I've come close once, a few weeks ago but I fought it and I won and we worked things out soon after. Tonight though, I lost. I know it's silly but I have had this stupid idea stuck in my head that as long as I don't cry, we're doing ok. We're movng forward and not slipping back any. I've thought that if I cried at all, the delicate layer between our world and all the loneliness and anger of yesterday would be eaten away by the salt in my tears. That my tears would wash away all the happiness that I have felt and that they would be a calling card for the slow decent ...... back.  I will close now and finish this tomorrow perhaps. Matt and I are on more stable ground now but I am still fighting those tears. Too many have already fallen for my liking but I could not stop them. I will revisit this later, as I have more to say.   (the next day)   Things don't seem as bleak today as they did last night. Matt and I were able to get out of the mess last night and go to bed with peace and we awoke holding each other. I'm still not sure what went wrong though. I am inclinded to think that I should have not said anything but that surely WOULD be a step in the wrong direction. I'm just so afraid of being hurt ... Actually, it's not the being hurt that scares me, it's the betrayal that I fear. It wrenches my gut into knots even thinking about such things. *sigh* But that's no way to live and I know that. I trust in Matt and what we build with each other on a daily bases.  The funny thing is, even sitting here now, I still feel like crying. Matt is mowing the yard and the girls are doing their own thing. I still feel a heaviness in my chest for some reason. It's the doomed feeling I get when something near me is spinning out of sync. I haven't felt that in a long time and I confess that I haven't missed it one bit. As I've always done when I feel the knocking, I will lay out the whiteboard and wait and see if something comes into focus. I've always hated the waiting more than anything else. EOTSFN

      I haven't written in a while ... I've had so much going on it's crazy. I have some very interesting things to tell you but they'll take a back seat for now because something else has brought me here this morning.  I dreamed about J. last night. It was him and a friend that I've never met. For some reason I was establishing a relationship with the friend and J was with another girl. We were in a big house by some cliffs surrounded with trees. At one point, I almost slipped off the cliff, but saved myself at the last minute. Then it changes to all of us being inside the house in the living room and the girl J is with is gone. I'm initially sitting with the guy who I think is my new boyfriend, but soon the pull towards J is irrisitable. All through the dream he and I have kept our distance from one another and haven't talked much or interacted in any way, but there has been a heavy tenseness between us. Finally, it's too much for us and we come together in the living room, we kiss lightly at first and then it's like all the walls fall and we emerse ourselves in each other with hurried hunger. We are all over each other and we are at the verge of crying together. It's a painful mix of elation and heavy sadness. Almost a mourning of sorts. We fall back on the couch and strip our clothes and are about to have sex when his girlfriend walks in. She's not happy at all and starts to yell at everyone. My "boyfriend" tells her that she's just got to understand that we (J and I) have to get it out of our systems and reach our closure. Which is weird because secretly J and I knew all day that it would be our last time together. The dream goes on for a few minutes and then just seems to stall. I wake up puzzled as to why I dreamed about him after so many years.   My imediate thought is that I've somehow equated something with B to J. Or rather, something about the situation. When I woke up, for the briefest moment, I missed him. I missed the being buried alive feeling we had ... But it passed and I started reflecting on me and M. I have those same feelings with him now and they aren't built inside of a glass house. They are strong and are being sewn into the fibers of our souls.   I know that I will ponder this dream all day long, trying to lay out the pieces and see how they fit together. I'm trying to tell me something and I want to hear the messege. I just went back and reread this and perhaps the longing towards being with J is actually reflecting my journey with M. We have opended so many new doors lately and it's things that I have ached over for so long. Perhaps I'm not equating B with J - but M with J. Understand? The almost falling off the cliff is me saving myself in both situations before it goes horribly wrong. The yelling woman is my brain telling me to just STOP IT. lol. And maybe the boyfriend on the couch who would sit quietly by and watch his girlfriend fall into another man is B. He's passive enough for certain. Is it B on the couch watching me and M ... or is M watching me and B? That is almost laughable because I don't have those feelings towards B. The making out with him is nice and I enjoy it, but it doesn't have HUNGER - it doesn't have that "I'm going to die if I don't feed from this person right now" feeling. I think it has to be B on the couch, it's the only thing that makes sense. Maybe the yelling woman is A also .... because I know she is jealous of me. She wants everything I have. Not my things exactly but she wants her life LIKE mine.   M just called from work to say Hi and that he loves me. He is amazing. I love him completely.

      Fourth of July was really great ... we spent all day at B and A's and I made cherry creamcheese tarts. As requested by A. =-) I think she really likes them. lol. There weren't as many people there as were in invited but it was still a very nice time. Everyone got SO worn out. The guys especially because they always do jumps and things in the pool. Plus, the heat can wear you out as well. I did get a lot of time to talk with A's sister. She had a lot to say about dogs and the different breeds and their care. I am thinking of getting a dog and it was nice to pick her brain for a while. Plus, it helped us to get to know each other. I wonder if A. felt weird about that at all.   We had another get together on Saturday night. It was really great actually. I was on my back, B. as near my face, bent down where I could reach 'him' ... M. was going down on me and A. was going down on him. It was really wonderful. At one point, B. pulled himself from me and we were kissing and he was right there in my face while I came from what M. was doing. It was like having something hot and cold at the same time. The temperature not being the focus, but the vast difference between the two. Like night and day.  It was the weirdest sensation. M. didn't cum with A., he saved it for me which is a whole OTHER story. He was so wired by the end of the night because he saved himself ... it was an awesome experience. He literally woke up the next morning  Withering  M. just came to bed and so I need to wrap it up soon. He's sleeping right here beside me.  Anyway, it was nice to have them over again. It had been a good two weeks between get togethers. I didn't spend much time with A. that night. I went into this whole thing being very much Bi-Curious. Now I'm totally decided. I LOVE MEN. I have a whole new appreciation for them, the way they look, the way they move .... everything. Speaking of, M. is growing his hair out for me because he says I play with his head much more often than when it was bald. I can't really argue with him there. I love to run my fingers through B.'s hair and I would love to be able to do that with M. as well. B is on vacation all this week and doesn't want to wait until Sunday to get together. I'm thinking of making time for it tomorrow night. Wednesday and Thursday they have company over. Although, today A. started cramping and we think she's losing the baby. If that's the case, I can't imagine her wanting to do anything tomorrow night.   After swimming today, I went to their room to get my bra and put it on. A and B were in there and we all three just started getting changed and put together. It was nice to be able to be so comfortable around them to do that, but it was also kind of exciting being in THEIR room. We've never done anything in there. I don't know why I didn't turn and face B. or try to touch him in any way. I guess I was being sensitive to A and her possible loss of the pregnancy. I would have liked to touch at least a little bit, maybe sit on the bed and take him into my mouth for a minute. Wrong timing though I think.  Lets see, what else .... Oh, I wrote my Mom today. I haven't heard anything from her since she moved to Tx. Not an email or anything. I do have her new phone number and I was thinkin of calling her. I wrote her today and told her about the updates we've done in the bathroom and how the kids are fairing over the summer. I hope she replys.   The bathroom, I painted the tub a deep wine color and M. carpeted the floor. Just those two things make a world of difference! The next thing is putting up a beed-board type stuff and installing the new sink. I'll have to include pictures. I wonder if I have a before picture of the tub. I don't think so, shoot .. I should have taken one. Oh well.  Well, I think I'm out of here now. I'll go get something to drink and then head off to bed. It's only 10:20pm but the morning comes early around here. Especially for me. I think once we get the new airconditioner (hopefully this weekend) I can stay up in my recliner while M. goes to bed early.                                            See ya ...

      S. (my 12 year old daughter) asked to ride her bike up to the school today to meet one of her friends. I gave her an hour and a half and she just called and asked if her friend can come over and stay for dinner. I said "ok." What continues to amaze me is no matter how many books I stack on her head while she's sleeping, she still continues to grow. (My mother used to say that) She's becoming such a little person ... although not so 'little' anymore. She's wearing bra's and noticing boys and talking on the phone all hours of the day. She'll be starting Junior High this Fall and whether I'm ready for it or not, there are all kinds of new and scary situations just itching to confront us. *gulp*  M. is taking a nap right now, he just couldn't make it all the way until bedtime. I guess it's going to take more than one day to get back on our regular schedule. When he gets home tomorrow though, he'll be off for the entire weekend. =-)   B and A have invited us over for a Fourth of July cook-out and pool fun on Sunday. Of course we'll go. Also, tomorrow is B's birthday. I couldn't order him what I wanted to because of having to replace the AC in the house. Hmmm .. I'll just have to be creative and give him something *else for his Birthday. *wink. Seriously, a card and peck on the cheek will have to suffice. His vacation starts tomorrow as well. So I'm expecting some late nights for sure this weekend. Although, I think A's brother is in town and if that's the case, then they'll probably stay home. And, I think A. might be having issues with her pregnancy and perhaps not feeling very frisky. We'll see ...

      M. went to bed around 9pm ... shortly after the kids. Although I wanted to go with him, I just couldn't sleep that early. I stayed up by myself until about 10pm and then decided to try to get some sleep. I took a shower and lay next to him and held his cock in my hand while I fell asleep. He would stir now and then but never come fully awake. After about an hour, I turned over and he spooned me and held my breasts. He then started playing with my nipples and it felt so wonderful! It just went from there and ended with him being inside of me and me cumming so perfectly. It was a wonderful releases! He came shortly after and we then walked to the kitchen, naked, to get something to drink. I don't know but for some reason that really meant a lot to me. The fact that we didn't split right afterwards. Walking alone with him with nothing on, after pleasing each other so completely, was very touching to me. It's the small things I guess that can sometimes mean the most. And he knew it too, because he pulled me close to him in the living room, standing in darkness, and let me savor the moment just a little longer.

      We went to (S)'s orientation for school today. She had a really great time and managed to alleviate all of her fears. lol. She was worried about 'this' or 'that' and I told her it would all work out and she would see that Junior High isn't as complicated as it seems. She's very happy and that of course makes ME happy. =-)  I was playing Canasta with A. last night and I reminded her that she said she'd watch (T). for me tomorrow while I took (S) to school. She gave me this long pause and said "well, ummm ... how later? Mom is off tomorrow and I'll .... umm .. have to see if it's ... umm, ok with her." She didn't  actually say it that way in the chat, but that's how she made me feel. She didn't just say "ok" like she did originally. She then called me this morning and told me that it would be fine with her Mother to bring her over this evening. And that I shouldn't forget to feed her before we come over or to at least bring some dinner with me for her. My first thought was how many times they have eaten here without any forethought and how often I feed their child without thinking about it. I don't know, the whole thing just seemed weird to me and I got a funny feeling. Later in the day, (B) asked to come over on the way to the store. Once they got there, she seemed in a bit of a hurry to leave. Especially when (B) moved to sit next to me. I'm not 'saying' anything really ... just that it felt weird ... different than it has ever before. Also, the other day I told her about how I thought that (B) does a really cool thing with his hands when we're having sex. I couldn't really explain it very well, other than to say that I just liked it. He even asked me later what it was exactly because he really had no idea he was doing anything special at all. Well, since then ... (A) has called him "magic fingers" around me. She goes ON and ON and ON about what wonderful fingers he has. I just find it funny. It's like the butt thing, she doesn't notice it at all until I make a comment about something. I think in reality she knows she'll never be me or have what I have and so she tries to make me jealous of the things SHE has. It's weird .. and I'm saying that word a lot tonight. lol And by the way, I took (T) with me to school.  Bev came over several times today and guess what I notice? She's flirting with me. I don't think it would ever go anywhere .... not like at the yard party but I think she is intrigued by what happened and likes to have that open relationship with me. She likes being a little bit flirty with another female. It's totally fine by me because she's a good person inside and I like spending time with her. We have a lot of fun together. It's funny ... she's less attractive than (A) in the face, but her personality goes W A Y beyond that of (A) and that makes her MORE attractive in the end. Maybe there IS something to that whole thing about "it's what's on the inside that counts".  I called (M) at the Hotel this evening. He seemed happy to hear from me. He said he's been working hard and being good. He said that he's going to go have a beer tonight and that made my stomach clentch a little bit. There is an ever present small fear that I'm stupid and don't see what is really going on sometimes. I fear that I have closed off my 'receptors' and am no longer willing to see anything outside of my perfect little bubble. It's not a big fear though. I mostly think it's just the fear of totally letting go and having pure Faith in someone. If I am ever to achieve that, I wish it to be with (M). He is my everything and we are headed for wondrous times. I will tell you this, it's been nice to sit at home after it's dark and the world is settling in for the night and not feel a darkness in my center. To not feel like there is something terribly wrong. He should be home tomorrow afternoon. Let's hope.  Last night when I went to bed, I was a little frightened by all the noise in the house. I had to lay there for a bit with the light on because I was too scared to turn it off. I thought about the fact that I could call (B) and ask him to just come and lay with me so I'd feel safer. Not touch me in any way or snuggle, but just to be in the same room. I didn't think of (M) because he's so far away and it's not possible for him to be here. The thought of (B) though and that I COULD have him come over, made me feel better. It actually helped me to go to sleep. I don't want (M) to think that I was choosing (B) over him, it's just that the possibility was what made me feel better, not actually the person.  I talked with my Mom today. I almost told her about my hair, but I had company coming in and out and didn't want to distract from the conversation once I told her. I think I'll take some pictures and send them while I tell her all about it. That will be fun! She's doing fine I guess. She said that Daddy will probably have to have surgery soon on his neck. He has some bone spurs that are getting bad and keeping him from being able to turn his head. I hate the thought of my parents winding down. Tick-Tock-Tick ........ Tock.  I saw something on (M)'s computer that bothered me a little. I was writing emails and thinking of sending my sister some more pictures and I thought about Amy and that I should write her. So I got on (M)'s computer to get the address and I see that he has signed some of his letters to her as "Kazs" or something like that. I can't remember exactly. The thing that I guess that bothered me was the casualness of the signature and the fact that I had never heard him refer to himself in that way. I felt like it was a small secret thing between them that I'm not part of. It just made me feel weird. And, I'm not totally convinced that he would be faithful to me under the wrong circumstances. See how I am? Ok, just stop-it. I'm not even going to go there. I trust him and have faith. Especially after all that we have learned in the past few months. We are so different than we have ever been. I love him.  Ok, I warned you that I would write a lot this week. What else is there to do when the only thing keeping me company are the voices in my head? It's 10:30 now and perhaps I'll go play some games on Pogo. See ya ....

      Ok, so Tay comes over today and asks to charge a cell phone, because you guessed it, their power got cut off. So no problem, we find a plugin and she's on her way for an hour. Later in the day though she comes over with what looks like a hotpocket or something and asks to heat it in the microwave. I pause but then relent. On her way out, she asks to borrow the plate it's heated on and I say "ok, just bring it by later sometime." Well, time goes by and the night is coming and I figure I have to do some legbreaking to get my plate back. I see Tay and her Mom pulling up in the driveway and ask Sarah to go ask about the darn plate. Tays Mom flipped out! She started cussing at Tay about "we don't need their shit! We got our OWN shit! What were you f*cking thinking?!" She goes off on Tay so hard it makes her cry. So what does she do?? She makes Tay go get my plate AND one of theirs to give to me.  Ok, lets think about this ... .... .... .... .... nope, I just can't see where that makes any damn sense at all. lol. I just stood their looking at this plate that is from another house and wondered what the hell do I do with it?? I mean, how is that a lesson of any kind? So, I now have this strange orphand plate that seems like it's from another universe. I've been obsessing about the plate all day long. lol. It doesn't go anywhere and I don't even like where it came from. So, like, what do I DO with it??  I'm thinking perhaps I'll paint on it and hang it on my door. It'll say "next time, bring a bowl."

      Don't know why but something is trying to take up residence in the house. It's been coming and going for the past week and it's getting more intense. Whatever it is, it's pretty straight forward. It uses what it knows and makes it's self known for some reason. I don't know if it's good or bad yet; it just kind of freaks me out when it makes things move. It stays around me when it's active ... if it does something tonight I'm going to start asking questions. Funny thing though, I've had my mirror out less than a month and now I've snagged something. Good point self ... I think I'll be putting the mirror in it's cloth tonight before bed and see if that helps. It doesn't help that I've gazed into it several times lately without cleaning it first. Bad form ...

      Matt left this afternoon for Harrison. He has to go help a store that is opening in three days. He and the store manager from here and one other employee are going. He will be gone until Wednesday night. Today is Sunday night.  ** He just called and checked in with me. I love that he did that. He wasn't all lovey-dovey because he was borrowing his bosses cell phone. They are going to go down to the pool that the hotel has. Man, I feel lonely and it's only the first night. *sigh  Anyway, I know that there is no reason to worry. Everything seems to be on the up and up this time. I hope it stays that way. I can't imagine having to worry like I did last time he went out of town. It sucked really badly. Mostly, I'm just bored.  B. IM'ed me earlier and asked me if I was getting close to my period. I thought that an odd question from him. Apparently, A. started today and she is "laying wagers that I start today or tomorrow." Good Lord. I asked B. why he asked me that and he said that A. told him that my nipples were tender. The truth of the matter is, I just didn't want her touching me there lastnight, so I feined being a little sore. She's too pushy and touches me like a guy would. An uneducated one at that. lol. She's got little tact or idea about how a woman likes to be touched. At least me anyway. Who can say about others. Anyway, it was funny. I told B. that I was tender from the nipple clamps ... lol. I just didn't want her touching me. I'm going to HAVE to find a way to tell her that I'm not interested in her. Preferably before we go to see SlowVein this month. Like Matt said, "I'm going to see a show, not BE the show."  I miss him already. This sucks. But I'm glad he gets to go and get out of town for a bit. I know he loves opening new stores. Oh well, perhaps I'll go play some Pogo. I have a feeling that I will write quite a bit in the next few days. ttul.
