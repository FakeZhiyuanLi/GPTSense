Hmm, not much else I can say lol. Oh, I'm starting my Web designer course on Monday... good fun :D  Doom 3 is almost here, can't wait... Just can't wait... feck I'm so bored, and games seem boring, 'coz I'm looking forward to Doom 3 so much...  Well, I guess that will be all for now.

      Haven't posted for a while.   I've got a new friend, Faye :D hello *waves*. You can see her journal as well by clicking the link in the friends list on the right.   I've been playing Americas Army quite a lot now. I mean the game you fool, visit  urlLink http://www.americasarmy.com  for more information. Anyway, it seems at about 6pm everyday I can't seem to login to my account, which means I can't play online :( For god sake, I was enjoying the game. Stupid Americans! Fix it lol, I want to play.   Doom 3 is nearly here as well. 16 days to go until it comes out. I am gonna get mine from  urlLink http://www.mx2.co.uk  because they have the special edition there for about Â£24 which is a deal and half lol. *sigh* Another great thing about PC games, they are much cheaper!   What else am I doing...ah yes, slowly putting things on Dark Rose:  urlLink http://www.darkroseweb.tk  I made a web template for it. But I must tell you that it was Chrono's idea (he's a friend, look in my friend's list). You can have a look at the template  urlLink here . Now you can see why I said it was Chrono's idea :P   I'll try and post more when I get the time, my sister is still into PC gaming :( It's nice, that another member of the family has the same interest as me, but I'm gonna get annoyed if I can't use my PC when I want, and we only have one :(   That's all for now. Buh bye!

      OK, I changed the stuff to red again... &nbsp; Red is my favourite color and blogs are personal things, so I thought I'd have the links and titles and stuff red. So ner :P &nbsp; I'll post a photo of myself (instead of that bear lol) so that you can all see how minging I am... well I might, I'm scared of paedo's... Well who isn't? It's just that I'm 16, that's all, so at this age I am gonna be scared. I'd probably scared as an adult as well, 'coz if I had kids, I'd be scared of them... Now I'm just rambling. &nbsp; Well you will soon know if I decide to or not. &nbsp; Oh yea, I think it's time I told you about UKIT. UKIT is, a traning institute that I go to. If you read my post 'Home sweet home!', in the 6th paragraph, you will see what qualification I am studying for. Well, UKIT is the name of the traning institute that I go to. I am currently doing a basic course in IT though. They made me do it, I have to study Microsoft Office and other basic things before I start the actual web designer course. Still, it's pretty easy though, I'll wizz through it (geek lol). &nbsp; Well, I have to study now, so I'll add more later when I get home... If I can get my sister off... hmph :(

      I constantly change the theme of my PC. It's currently a blue thing, so I've decided to make my blog as well... &nbsp; God, looking outside it's awful lol, I'm gonna be depressed...JOKE! &nbsp; I'm soo bored as well, someone add me/talk to me on MSN or something. I got no games as well! Well I have but I'm waiting for Doom 3, which comes out 3rd August... My god I can't wait, that game looks great. Got 94% in PCGAMER US, don't know what it will get here in the UK. &nbsp; Oh yea, console gamers suck :P &nbsp; Just thought I'd add that. Now I'm off, to play games most probably! &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

      Got home ages ago but my sister was on the PC :( Damn, she's been getting into computer games recetly :(   Now I have it to myself!   What shall I do now? My exams are over so I can play games now and I'm also working on my site,  urlLink http://www.darkroseweb.tk    It's not finished yet, in fact I've hardly started it! If you are a web  master/designer then bookmark it for when it's done, it will have  resources and tutorials for you people like you! Also I might need help  with it, I mean I need people to submit some tutorials/resources as  well, as I can't manage the whole thing.   I am doing some tutorials as well however, and don't worry, I'll be a  professional. I'm studying a course to get the qualification "Master  CIW (Certified Internet Webmaster) Designer/Developer". I haven't  started the course yet, but I still know some stuff. I guess I'll be  starting it in about a week or two. However, I do know some stuff about  web design. I'll put what I learn on the Dark Rose site and share it  with the world!   Also visit  urlLink http://www.thewastelands.2ya.com .  It's my mates forums and it's full of nonsense!! But it's good  nonsense, please register and post, it needs more people like you!  &nbsp;  Please feel free to add me to your MSN:  urlLink mrkill47@hotmail.com  I need to talk to people!  &nbsp;  What else do I want... n00b serveres for Battlefield 1942 and Desert Combat. I bought it while I had exams and didn't get a good chance to play them properly, now I wanna learn em :P Post a comment on some n00b servers or something or e-mail/contact me on MSN.  &nbsp;  Right, that's all for now, I'm thinkin of adding some abckground music to it, you know, for that more personal feel... But it will probably depend on the mood that I'm in.

      I really can't stand sites that have bad coding practices and don't use tags properly. Also, doing stupid things like tables for layout, putting main content in iframes, pop-ups (come on, who doesn't hate pop ups?!?!?!).  I was doing a practice paper for my CIW exam. One of the questions was:  "What block-level element will affect an entire paragraph and it can be an empty tag?"  The choices were:    &lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;  &lt;HEAD&gt;   &lt;BR&gt;  &lt;P&gt;   I guess &lt;HEAD&gt; doesn't count, as that doesn't appear on the screen when viewed with the browser, so it can't be that. &lt;BR&gt; is not a block level elemt, it's a text level element, so it's definetly not that.    That leaves us with &lt;blockquote&gt;and &lt;p&gt;. I decided to go for &lt;p&gt;, as this puzzled me. How can a tag be an empty tag AND a container tag  at the same time !  Well, &lt;p&gt;was the right answer and I know why. In HTML 4.01 transitional, you don't have to close the &lt;p&gt;tag, the browsers these days forgive you! But it's bad coding practice and a profesional company like CIW ( urlLink http://www.ciwcertified.com ) and teaching you this! That bloody outrageous! No wonder there are so many sites out there that don't work, or have crappy designs. People need to learn some web standards!!  OI, CIW, if you are reading this, visit  urlLink http://www.w3.org  and  learn something!   Chris... [/rant]  Don't worry, I'll be fine... Feel free to talk to me on MSN if I'm not busy.... :)

      Sorry 'bout the title, just couldn't think of anything...  OMG, at my CIW course, they teach you to use table's for layout...disgusting!! lol  Also the way they write their code is awful...anyway, it's lateish and I don't want to go into that now.  Hmmm, what can I say, nothing special happened this week.  Doom 3 comes out on 3 days, I will buy my special edition then.  I'm also working on a new layout for the Dark Rose site ( urlLink http://www.darkroseweb.tk ). It's not up yet, as I am still working on it, and I want to make sure it looks half decent and it works right before I put it up.  Someone from The Wastelands ( urlLink http://www.thewastelands.2ya.com ) has suggested that I make a Counter-Strike template, so I will. Probably not tonight, or tommorow. Maybe the day after.  I'm a lil hungry now, so I'll go get some food...or starve to death while I play computer games :P :D

      As you know I've started my CIW course... I started the Networking fundamentals part...it's hard, it's a hell of a lot of information to take in!! But this is the hardest part, when I get to the actual web design part, then it's gonna be easy.  Hmm, I also learned that my grandad died recently.... on either Thursday/Friday... Why am I only hearing about it now? Well, he was cremated yesterday. My dad wanted to go to his funeral (it was his dad), but he couldn't, because we ahven't got the money, the house isn't sold yet. Also the money was also spent on my CIW course... So, I'm gonna make sure that money will be put to good use, and pass this course and get this qualification.  Hmm, I'm really bored and tired right now, the course is really tiring. That's all I'm gonna say for now.
