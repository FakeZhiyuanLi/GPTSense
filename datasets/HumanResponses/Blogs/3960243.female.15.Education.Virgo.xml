       Today is sure a fun day man .. Went to ZodiacLadies's organised event at Paradigm together with Felicia, Mei Xian, Melissa and Vivien .. Once the dancing marathon starts, the 5 of us rush to the dancefloor and dance .. Haha .. Danced for 3 whole hours non-stop .. The groove just makes us continue .. Though very tired wearing the high heels .. =P This is such a rare chance man just to dance whatever with your good friends .. Also release stress from upcoming exams .. It's been fun .. Hehe .. Anyway we made 5 friends .. Sharon, Florence, Shearlyn, MeiMei & Carwen .. (i guess their names are spelt like that) They are all so sweet gAls especially Sharon and MeiMei .. Hee .. Hope to know more friends in the future .. Too bad not all like to talk alot if not sure very high ... The next dance party i'm sure to be there .. Haha ..

       Starting of school already quite happy ... Just to see my friends chit chatting around laughing all over makes me feel great .. =P In class keep eating .. Haha .. Siti brought food for us .. So me, Nilufer, Cassene and Siti sat at the back eating snacks while listening to the lesson .. Got a lot of laughter as well .. We keep cracking jokes regardless lame or non-lame i just know we laughed a whole lot today .. Miss Ong's "All you give is waste and take in resources, it's not even good&nbsp;for fertilizing." Haha .. Think of it can make me laugh again ... Mood's getting better day by day .. Hope it won't change for some time .. Exams around the corner i must buck up but nowadays just feel very tired ... Wanna sleep .. Must try overcome this laziness as well .. =) Anyway Dannie and i are ok .. We chatted a while during Maths lesson he lend me his papers to copy .. Can see he's also kinda stress up by Vivien and Xin Yue .. Just hope he won't tire out himself ...

       I feel better now .. During PE lessons had a lot of fun with my friends playing&nbsp; basketball .. Must enjoy these times as there will not have another chance to play together like this after we graduate .. =) After sweating so much all worries just suddenly gone .. After school, I meet Gary my good friend and my ex .. Just feel like seeing and chit chatting with him .. I love talking to him though sometimes he always very "guai lan" but know he's just joking ... We went to Pastamania have lunch saw some of his friends ... That Yao Long so "guai lan looking" =x Anyway just have a walk after lunch then saw Melissa, Vivien & Shi Min .. They all keep making fun of Gary .. Haha .. I just stand there&nbsp;chatting with&nbsp;Shi Min .. A day just gone like that .. Feels so damn good .. Yeah !

       I can't sleep at night .. I forced myself too but i can't .. I don't know what i'm thinking about for the past few days .. I just know it hurts inside me .. This feeling i can't describe about .. Everyone's asking me what happen .. I wish i can tell them but i can't .. I myself don't even know .. Now Dannie's angry with me i also don't know why though i apologise to him .. We didn't talk at all today in school ... I'm fine with it .. I can't just let my life go on like that .. I got to find a way out of this .. No matter what .. I must now&nbsp;control my temper .. Don't let my friends worry about me .. I feel so alone in this world .. There's no one i can talk to .. Even if there is he might not wanna talk to me .. =s "The book of relationship says we will always hurt the ones we love"

       Went to play basketball at Blk 806 with Ben, Daniel, Desmond, Alex and Kelvin .. From 4.45pm till 7.45pm all the way we play and had lots of laughter .. Before i went to meet them i wasn't in the mood but i really cheered up when i see them .. =P Then i saw Yong Jie, Xue Yao, Fabian, Shao Ping and Kai Li roller-bladding but Yong Jie very lonely and sad so i tried to cheer him up but fail ... After playing, all went home only left me, Daniel, Ben and Kelvin go 883 eat dinner .. Then went to Blk 875 there chit-chat talk about own problems and joke around ... =) This is the life just to hang out with friends and relax .. As for Gary that thingy i just wanna make up my mind .. I won't patch with him .. It's best being his good friend ... (WILL TRY NOT TO CHANGE MY MIND!) Reach home bathe use the computer waiting for my dad come home .. Who knows my mum quarrel with him .. * sigh* i cried .. very scared didn't know what to do .. Their arguement lasted for 10mins then went in the room suddenly quiet .. Don't know what's going on inside ... Life's in a mess man .. Always up and down ... But still the sun goes up every morning ...
