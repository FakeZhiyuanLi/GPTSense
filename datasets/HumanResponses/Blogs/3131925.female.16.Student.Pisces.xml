      Today couldn't have gotten any worse. After a huge fight with my mom I had to go shopping around with her (oh joy) and listen to her bitch the second I get to her house. She hurt her arm so I had to drive and we went to Taco Bell by some ghetto place and I started to go around the parking lot, and all of a sudden I hear this loud scratch and my moms priceless car is teteering on a 3ft fucking rock. Because my moms car is so freakin long and I couldn't see over that blind spot I didn't even notice the damn thing. First my mom says back up, then forward and I"m like HEY WE'RE NOT ON THE FUCKING GROUND IT DOESNT MATTER! Then all these Mexicans show up at start staring, perfect time for me to just cry and run away hidding my face lol. I get out of the car to see it cause my moms car was like..not able to open, and I see this huge rock and the whole step thing under her car door is completely smashed in and the paint is all fucked. Finally some guy just lifted it off of the rock and my mom just sat in the car asking me how bad it was over and over and I just got back in and we drove off. Some guy said it was AT LEAST 500 dollars worth of damage...shoot me now. Then I get to the grocery store and I'm paranoid about my dad and what he's gonna say about the car but my mom was totally care free like nothing happened and told me not to worry, which of course made me panic. We got to her house and my dad was about to pick me up and my mom called him beforehand to tell him about the car so we just hung out in the yard talking. He came over and looked all pissed and just kinda stared at me then my mom got kinda pissed for him being all mean. I was surprised he even let me drive his car back home lol and halfway there I asked him if anything else was on his mind cause he was so pissed and he mentioned he got my mom's mail for me and in it was, of course, the infamous report card. He pretty much told me my life is going to shit along with everything else then just dropped me off and left. So now I'm here after a long weekend of just being bitched at, wishing it was finally SUMMER!

      Seems like everyday is just getting worse. I was supposed to go over to Clint's or him come here and watch a movie but instead I got grounded. Turns out I can't go back to school because of some unexcused absence and they think I'm ditching..yeah a whole absence, wtf. So mom called bitched me out, then my dad decided to just not get in it so I had to sit home all day and do nothing. I talked to Clint and I felt kinda bad cause it seems like I'm always telling him I can't do things but it's cause I'm never really allowed which sucks. My knee feels like it's getting better but looks like it's getting worse, don't see the plus in that. Today was the softball tournament in Simi Valley which I didn't go to, hope we won. Seriously over all this stupid drama between everyone, seems like theres maybe 5 girls on the team tops that are just chill and cool the rest out of the 14 are just bitches( and if any softball girl sees this and gets mad cause I'm "talking shit" GET OVER IT IT'S THE TRUTH AND YOU KNOW IT)...so yeah. I miss summer vacation and goin to the beach and surfing with Clint, everything was so perfect, especially going to the fair with him and all my friends. For those few months I actually forgot about everything that brought me down and had the time of my life. I'm really missing the days when I was back in 6th grade at Hollywood Beach School, where I had Carlye as my best friend and her mom was alive, Carlye and I would go to the beach every weekend for hours from when we woke up till sunset, and everything we did for fun wasn't going and getting drunk or high. I feel like I have a shitload on my mind but don't even have the words or time to put it all out. Well I'm gonna give Carlye a call and take a walk on the beach to calm down. OFFICIALLY STRAIGHT EDGE...and then I woke up huh Deanna lol.    Always and Forever known as DanieLSD

      Well today was alright. Had to go to school which meant waking up early so that sucked. I have no idea why but my pants ended up being written all over but turned out "tizzite"-Randi lol so I didn't care. All day I was stressing over stupid shit and realized I didn't even have to after the day was over. I heard that there was gonna be a Dunes party but half of the time we try and go it either never starts or gets broken up in a couple hours. If I would have gone I would have taken Randi, Deanna and Lauren..pretty much whoever wanted to go. Then it was time for softball and cause of my knee I couldn't do crap so I had to just sit there and watch, and of course once I get there Jillian's already there..oh joy. Whole time I was paranoid one of us would say something then we'd just end up fighting but I couldn't cause then I wouldn't be able to play period. Her and Abby started talking and Abby pretty much said I suck so now she's on my shitlist, sad thing is, is she knew I was right there and thought she said it quiet enough yet after she said it I just glared at her until she left..mwhaha. Seriously over the whole bitchy attitute, no wonder I'm such a bitch most of the time, people always manage to piss me off. I left at three and took the bus home, and of course my mom calls like the second I get there and tells me I might be expelled for God knows what..so yeah might now show up on Monday. THEN I came online and started talkin with Marie who tells me the Dunes party is gonna be tight and all this shit so of course the one time we don't go it's gonna kick ass UGH. I keep lookin back on all the times I did go out and party or drink and sadly I remember like a quarter of them if that, if it wasn't for me writing stuff down the next day I doubt I'd remember anything. I'm really trying to be straight edge, no drinking no drugs(doubt drugs will be a problem) but it's really hard, always getting the temptation here and there which sucks major ass. I can't wait till summer, no school, away from parents cause I'm too busy out and about with people, and most of all...JD. Well that's about it, I'm mad tired so I'm off.

      Well, today is Easter and it's also one year from today that Teresa passed away. All I'm thinking about is what it would be like if it never happened. Maybe Carlye would still be living here and we wouldn't be doing the stuff we do for fun when she comes down to visit. First day of spring break Jessie decided to have the gang stay the night at her house but unfortunatley Clint couldn't come cause he was on this camping thing. Samantha ended up coming and she brought along Finus. It's still hard to believe that one of my best friends has become this whole other person, and pregnant at 15. We all decided to go to the corner store and get some vodka then head over to the beach. Along the way Doofy tagged along with us and we all just sat down and started passing the vodka around. I planned on drinking but once I saw Carlye and Marie drink and saw Allen and Jessie leave, I figured I'd be the one to drag their asses back to Jessie's. Marie and Brandon ended up walking back to Jessie's and Carlye and Doofy lagged behind us for awhile and then they were gone. When we finally got to Jessie's everyone was just chillin watchin a movie. At 2 we all got tired or passed out (whoever drank). Jessie and I stayed up a little later talking about everything that was on our minds while hearing Marie snore lol passed out up against the closet door on the floor. Later on we heard pounding on the door and it was Carlye trying to sneak back in, then we all passed out again. We woke up really early and decided to go over to the Jetty Surf to get some food, then I got bored and decided to leave. Wasn't one of those wild nights but it was definetly a different one.

      This weekend in all has been..different lol. On Sat I was just hangin around and Jessie called me sayin some fat bitch Erin was tryin to kcik her ass so I drove over as fast as I could be she was gone. Carlye, Marie and Jessie were all outside, they said that Jessie's mom told them to leave. So of course the bitches that we are, went off to look for them lol. We walked over to Jetty Surf and chilled outside on the tables. Then Jessie said they were coming and all you could see was 3 girls cause they were down by the corner store and they started walking our way. Right when they got by us I realized that one of Erin's friends was KATELYN, stupid little freshman bitch who tries starting shit with me at school but is way to much of a pussy to say it to my face. At first we just watched them walk by then Carlye got up and spazzed out and started calling her a fat bitch and stuff and we just laughed lol. Then one of Erin's friends tried talking and Marie told her to shut the fuck up and Katelyn wasn't saying anything but she bothered me so I yelled at her and she was like, wtf I didn't even say anything lol. Then of course after we left..we bumped into them again..and again..and again..and once more again lol. Funny thing was, was that they were such pussies that they would wait until we not only crossed the street, but we were also over 100 yards away from them. So on and off we'd be screaming shit back and forth. Then later on we wanted to go over to Kathrines and get fucked up or w/e and she wasnt there so we walked back to Jetty Surf..and on the way we saw them lol. Three of them and Three of us walking along the sidewalk, and of course you know no ones going to move. Me and this bitch bumped shoulders hard, and Marie's hit Katelyn's, and I think Carlye moved cause we all know Erin's just nasty lol. I WOULD HAVE DONE THE SAME CARLYE!  Then the bitch I bumped shoulders with actually told me don't fucking touch me stupid bitch, so I said hard not to when your fat ass covers the entire sidewalk where the fuck am I supposed to go..and she actually said around..wtf lol. Then of course once we were 200 or so yards away, they decide to talk shit. We went back to Jessie's and chilled and thought..why the hell didn't we just turn around once we all bumped shoulders and start hitting em?! So we went back out but this time, we decided to go over by their house. We could see their house a few streets before and we saw them peeking around the corner then the three of them sat on the curb like it was all casual when it WASNT lol. We didnt say andthing and turned down tony's street and OF COURSE AS ALWAYS, once we're almost by the beach at the end of the street, she decides to call Marie..grandma. hahahaha. So we chilled on the beach then decided to just go back to Jessie's. But we had to walk by their house just cause we wanted to start shit lol. Once we got to their house there was a car with headlights on and we're all thinkin..these fucking bitches are prolly gonna try and start it up and scare the shit out of us or something, so we all told eachother, DONT FLINCH..but once we got there it was the bitch that hit my shoulder in the car with her dad and another guy outside of the car sayin, "the girls dont wanna stay here anymore." HA! Pussies..we intimidated the shit out of them. Now I just can't wait for school tomorrow. It can only make things that much more interesting.

But tonight I'm goin on Strand, gettin wasted with the girls, theeen buyin some more vodka to bring to Clint's.

      Where to begin...this weekend was a blast. Carlye came down so I stayed at Jessie's to visit her. We roamed around Strand lookin for stuff to do. WQe ended up going to Cathrines and her and Mexican were watching the Wizard of Oz trippin out..funniest thing ever. Then we roamed around and went to Uncle Ray's and chilled there for awhile and Shantel tripped and left and me and Carlye went back to Jessie's and slept. The on Sat. I went with Adela to Main street. Interesting times. We walked everywhere, saw mean girls lol, and then went to the beach where we saw this couple in their 40's or so playing with dolls and taking pictures on the jetty lol..so yeah after that we left. Then later that night Carlye, Marie and Shantel called and wanted to chill so I packed my shit and went back over. We walked over to Jetty Surf Cafe and saw all the Strand guys there..KENNY TOTALLY CHECKED OUT CARLYE..it's casual lol. Then Matty came and got us some..ahem and we headed back to Shantel's haha. Then we went out and roamed around again until 10 and went back to Jessie's and chilled cause the cops were out everywhere. Then Ashley called and come and picked us up and started driving to some beach house on Hollywood Beach for a party..stole her moms car and only had a permit lol but she drove good so nothin happened. We showed up to the house and no one was there so we chilled and waited and talked..then Shantel got really sick so we left. Once we got to Jessie's Carlye decided to go look for Kenny so Marie and I chilled then went to sleep. Now I'm sittin here..tryin to remember as much as I can lol and I don't think I remembered it all...but yeah. But it sucked cause I didnt get to talk to Clint ONCE, kept missin is calls and he'd miss mine so I'm actually anxious to go to school on Monday. Back for some more drama.

      Things seem to be getting better with Clint. Those sorry ass freshman though still follow me around and give me dirty looks. He makes me happy but thinking about it all just makes me more depressed. I realized how much I missed talking to Shaydon. Today in softball all we did was chill by the track (of course noe run) and we talked about stuff and then we did on the bus. It frustrates me to think that I used to be so happy like everyne else I see but now im just kinda..there. I don't feel how long days go by anymore, to me a day is just a day. I was lookin back on Ashley's party, or what I remeber of it lol. Hsd a blast and wouldn't have changed a thing about it. Clint and I went to the strawberry festival..big mistake lol. Payed 9 bucks to look around for 30 min then leave. But we got to talk about random stuff which I guess was good lol, kept eachother entertained. I wrote him a note on how much I wanted us to last and I wasn't sure how he's act toward that but he said he knows we'll be high school sweethearts and be together forever, so in a sense it feels like a huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders. Tomorrow is a minimum day thank God, I'm so over school, only reason I go is to see Clint for the sorry hour I do. MAY 28TH!! Almost here, 1 year..never been with someone this long and never been so in love with someone either. Can't wait to spend the weekend with him and just relax..speaking of which, I've been doing that since I got home so I should go and start my hw..later                               OSL

      well today started off boring and seemed really long. then i got to talk to clint and that made things better. he went over to my moms and gave her flowers and a card for mothers day tomorrow, i think its really cute at how seet he is to her and tries to get along with my parents. apparently he stayed there for an hour telling her everything that went on between us and how he didnt really know what to do. he asked if we could go for a walk to the beach or something so i said ok and he came over around 8 30. when we got to the beach we just kinda stood there, and this kinda freaked me out but i was like thinking in my head, if i should stay with clint god really needs to give me a sign lol and sure enough...a fucking firework goes off and its all pretty lol. he told me how much he loved me and how sorry he was for hurting me and i told him it was fine, time to move on, so we just talked about random stuff and started to walk around shores. it was really weird cause it was like pitch black but like every 5 min i'd see a cat and i think it sketched clint out lol. like the first one i saw i got freaked out cause its head bobbed up then down really fast so i jumped back and he kinda jumped lol. we got back at my house like at 10 and we just talked about school, friends, everything. he told me about his life in texas(sorry for all the texas people but it just sucks), and i just told him about mine and me growing up in oxnard (deprived from the world? i think so lol). after 11 he figured it was time to go considering he was grounded and wasnt even allowed out, so we tried calling him a cab...well turns out oxnard doesnt have one under cab in the yellow pages..ITS UNDER  TAXI . so i felt really bad that he not only walked all the way over to see me, but now he has to walk for about an hour in the freakin cold back home with all those sketchy mexicans out lol. i remembered how i told him that he had the advantage over me because he knew i'd never break up with him, and that i used to be completely independent and i would never have someone have as much control as he does over my feelings...turns out he does and now im completely useless without him. but hearing him tell me that he wants to spend forever with me and he never wants to lose me and have him just hold onto me for awhile made me feel SO much better. so once he left i stood on the balcony and watched him walk away till i couldn't see him. turns out we'll make it to our one year and waaay past that : )

      Well this week has definately been a long one. Sucked major ass. Basically found out that my b/f Clint is a pathological liar who thinks that he can get away with it but not with me. It seriously pisses me off to know that I've been lied to more than once by him so now I have no idea what to do. The other day I told him I needed a day to think about it, and I wanted to stay with him but I didn't want him to feel like he could just do it and get away with it all. Mainly bugs me because he knew about Anthony and how I wouldn't let someone just take advantage of me like that or try and play me, which is exactly what he did. At school it was really awkward cause we both didn't know what to say or do so we just kind of stayed away from eachother. Earlier today I told him I'd give him another chance but if he fucked up then I'd just leave, simple as that. Then when I got home I was in my room listening to music so I didn't hear the door but my dad came down and told me someone was at the door for me and I'd never guess who. Sure enough it was Clint with some flowers and a card, he came over to talk to me about everything. We talked for awhile and hearing him tell me how uch he loves me and how he wants to spend forever with me made me wanna push my pride aside and just hug him and hold onto him, but i just kept staring at the floor listening. Once he left I gave him a hug and a kiss on the cheek and he told me he didn't wanna lose me and I told him he wouldn't..whether I gave in too easily or not I'll find out..

      Summer's been ok so far..no school so can't complain. Grandparents came down for like 5 days and Clint met em. Really glad schools over cause I've been able to see him a lot more than just lunch and passing period or w/e. On friday we decided to go to the youth's all nighter thing. We saw dodgeball which was like sold out so there's me and Clint's sittings in the very front row lol...of course with Katie in the back calling me lol. It was a ok movie. Jessie, Allen, Bean and Melanie all saw shrek 2 which of course started once our movie ended so me and Clint walked around and went behind coldstone's and talked and played go fish cause i suck at cards and don't know how to play any games. Then Ashley Franklin called, after all the drama with her sneaking out her mom made her try living with her day in San Diego (and she's not even next to sea world how lame). So we finally get back to St. John's and it's sucking..really bad. All little people except for our lil group. Clint didnt bring a blanket or anything so it's my blanket that fits one person over both of us and a bunch of little kids screaming at like 4 in the morning, so Clint mentions beans car..we get our shit and go out and everyone assumes clint's gonna get ass in that P.o.s. lol i'll spare you details lol BUT HE DIDNT..now grandparents are gone and i can finally go out, party, hang out with anyone i want all i want.

      Yesterday was the last day of school, it went by ok i guess. I scared the shit out of Catlyn before which was of course very thrilling for me. I failed my damn world civ final..how..i don't even know. I went to Clint's for dinner and we just kinda hung out and talked and..stuff lol which was really nice. 1 year and almost a month, how we did it I don't know lol but I'm really glad we did. Last summer it kinda sucked cause he had to go to Texas for like a month and he called almost every night which was good, but not as good as being in his arms talking about things from tree stars lol to us being together far after high school. After that I went home and just kind of hung out. Then Carlye called me and told me that her and Ashley wanted to go to this party by my house so they'd stop by as soon as Ashley snuck out. So at like 10 30 I hear all these knocks on my window and sure enough its them, so I went out on the balcony and talked to them and they said they'd be back in 30 min to get me, but I was too tired and wouldn't ahve gone anyways. Then 20 min later, Jessie's mom calls and tells me some psycho mom called asking where her daughter is cause she found pillows under the covers of her bed..so I'm like oh shit, Ashley got caught. And Jessie's step dads in the background swearing and screaming about god knows what and I told her that when they came back I'd tell them to go back home. So I waited till a lil after 12 and they didn't come back and I fell asleep. ALSO, Carlye is offically known as "the Devil" hahaha.

      Things Carlye and I learned last night: -No such thing as straight. -No reality, you make your own reality, there is none if you're dead. -Only animals see colors that we can't see, like Poom. -Can you, may you. -Rory sound like you'd be roaring if you moaned his name. -Ashley = Kashley. -Shane West V PONY = Boney = Boni = Boner. -Katie = Crake baby, always call randomly when fucked up. -Someone's always on Shantel's balcony. -Guys + girls = NADA! Especially Strand Rats. -E.T. almost got me and came through the fucking computer. -Marie was abducted by aliens, raped and impregnated then given an abortion, then they put a tracking divice in her, like Truman Show.  It was one hell of a night, always interesting on Strand with the girls..can't wait till summer! More partyin to do of course..

      This weekend was pretty good. Friday was rally schedual so we got out early..can't complain. Then I got hold of Marie and her and Brandon were hangin out at Shantel's and said to come on over then we'd find Carlye. So I went and we roamed around lookin for Carlye for like..an hour then I said she's prolly gettin high with who other than Darren, but no we looked there after like 5 other places and when we got there of course she came out all happy and with food lol. So we walked around tryin to find people who could buy us..stuff lol. Once we got it we went back to Shantel's we started the party and we were lookin through the 6th grade yearbook and I started signing it lol and then we saw Samantha's picture and started talking about her..and then she called. Very trippy, and I talked to her for awhile and then we went out and about. Then we walked over to Jetty Surf Cafe and saw some people and it was Kristen Burke with some other people and we talked for like ever. Then ASshley F. came up and said McKenna left for a party without her lol so she dragged Carlye around looking for someone who could take her. We found out it was past 10 so we tried to get back to Shantel's without the cops finding us which we didn't thank god. Marie passed out right away and I layed down. Then someone knocked on the door and it was Axel, Kenny, Carlye and Ashley and they all came up and so there were 7 of us on a double bed lol. Axel was tryin to get all close to Ashley and Kenny was like all over Shantel and I was right next to thems o that wasn't cool. Shantel finally told them to leabve at like 12 or 1 couldnt see the clock lol and Kenny of course was like, "hey wanna come over to my house" and kept like raping her but she said no and what was really weird was that carlye said yes. Kenny tried tellin us that he wasn't the type of guy to "hit it and quit it" and I got pissed and told him bullshit you just went from Carlye to Shantel right when she was in the fucking room. and Shantel's jaw dropped and Ashley and Axel started laughin lol. So they left and then it was just me, Marie(still passed out) and Shantel layin down. I woke up early and left then later on went to Clint's and watched a movie..kinda lol. And today..well just kinda chilled and did nothing and I just remembered I have to read a book and take notes so I'm gonna go...FUCK MONDAYS!

BLACK!) so yeah anywho, carlye finally went back home after days and days of partying, it was fun. that guy lance from paintball wont stop stalking me, he calls me on 3 different numbers now and realized he can text to..need a new phone and number or somethin.OH so yeah yesterday i went to mc donalds cause I'm cool like that and i was just startin to go over the bridge and these guys in thsi durango or somethin kept tryin to talk to me but ya know..windows are tinted and THEY themselves don't even realize that lol and i have my sunglasses on so they can't even tell i'm looking at them so they swerved a lil closer to get my attention, so i looked over, laughed, and sped up behind this shitty car at a red light and i realize this huge red truck like tailgatin me and then they go next to me in the next lane and i look over and this chick driving is giving me a dirty look and they guys like flippin out at me yet..both of our windows are up and my music is kinda loud, so i looked up to the shitty car again and turned my music even louder. light turns green the car infront of them speeds up but noooo they have to drive right along side of me, i didnt even bother to look but at the corner of my eye i could see the red car. so i'm almost home and i'm still behind this piece of shit car lol but no ones infront of them yet they stop next to me yet AGAIN, so once the light turned green the piece of shit car went over into their lane and i sped up like 90 and they stayed behind...for a good 5 seconds then they came into my lane and zoomed up to me and i slowed down a lot and right when i was about to turn and they were behind me i flipped them off and they honked as they went by. i STILL don't know what i could have done to even piss them off that damn bad but w/e....people just hate me cause i'm drivin a mercedes benz and their ass is stuck in a piece of shit like the one i had to follow practically all the way home HA! oh yeah and nice "get together at clint's house on sat" his mom's gonna be out at her bfs..VOPOP!!

       Well yesterday I went to Urban Quest to watch Clint and Allen in a paintball tournament which they really sucked in but that's ok lol. I got hit too, fucking paintball went through a hole in the screen and got my back so&nbsp; i whiped it off on Clint. When I got there this guy Lance kept hitting on me and asked Clint how he knew me and he said g/f so I came in and said EX g/f as Allen went ooooooooooooooh! lol It was cool watching, there was a team of like 13 year olds named G SPOT lol. So me and this guy Lance kept talking, he goes to St. Bonie's and has like a 1,500 gun...why do boys do that? He was sweet and all but not my type, but he had the characteristics that Clint was definately missing. Allen and I are like brother and sister so when we yell or call eachother names we're just joking but sometimes it gets out of hand and Clint never like stand up for me even if its with his other friends and this guy Lance jumped in and was all sweet about it and told Allen to just chill..as Clint stands there looking at the&nbsp;dirt like&nbsp;there's fucking  gold hidden in it lol WHAT THE HELL! But yeah Jessie showed up to watch Allen, glad she came cause I felt kinda awkward being there. Right after Jessie left I did too and as I pulled out the dude Lance liek trew himself up on my window so I rolled it down and he was like, heeeey you missed my last game I kicked ass and we won..so I was like oh sorry maybe next time. He mentioned me going paintballing with him and Allen next weekend so I said ok and when he asked for my number I gave it to him..CAN ANYONE GUESS WHERE CLINT WAS LOOKING AT THE TIME???? If you guess the ground..YOU'RE FUCKING RIGHT! Once I left Allen told me the guy was acting like I gave him my number cause I dug him but I don't lol. Then Clint called and mentioned going out to talk n such so we ended up going bowling. Course we didn't talk cause we have issues like that..the people that work there put us right next to them so as they got strikes we got gutter balls n all lol. I won both games by the way. Then as we were about to leave Clint kept messin with the buttons and said the screen woulding work, and then he told me to look up at the tv thing and it said somethin like "please, I want another chance," and he went into this speech about us being together forever annnnnd of course I broke lol and kissed him and said I'd go back with him. It was a fun day but I got totally sunburned all around my neck and chest..and it's a gay sunburn not in places where it'd make me tan and look good for a tank top noo lol, oh and my neck has the tanline of my Tiffany necklace...looks totally gay lol. OH and I got to see Savannah a few times, she's adorable as always, she bought one of those kermit crabs at the mall with a pink painted shell lol, she leaves at like 4 in the morning or somethin...Mom and dad decided to be bitches to me today, everything I did or didn't do for my dad was wrong..and everytime I even mentioned what my dad did to upset me she'd go into the whole "well why don't you live with me..that ass took you away from me blah blah blah" everything to pretty much depress me, so THANK YOU

      ok sooo Clint dumped me, single yet again, maybe it'll stay that way maybe not but so far nothings working itself out. Last night I went to silver strand with carlye and jessie and for awhile we just chilled at jetty surf not really knowin what to do, then carlye and i realized we both had 10 bucks, so we got this guy to buy us some "stuff" and we went to this house their builing looking over the harbor and it was me carlye and shantel since jessie had summer school. Then we decided to see who all was at jetty surf and all the guys were gone so we walked to the beach and drank more and did cartwheels n stuff in our bras lol and carlye ran around while some sketchy person sat kinda far away from us. then we walked back and now all the strand guys were going to the beach but matty said a lot fo cops were gonna be on strand so shantel and i went to uncle rays..had some fun there lol, talked about furniture and shelves with memory lol, then how bad it would suck if you've never seen what you really looked like lol. Then after that it was almost 12 so I went back to Jessie's who of course was talking to allen so I got my shit and went into Jakes room and passed out. then 2 hours later jessie wakes me up and tells me carlye's at jetty surf cafe and can hardly walk and keeps passing out..and then decker comes in and laughs at me lol(random) so i'm like yeah ok w/e and pass back out, then jessie wakes me up and i go into her room and pass back out while carlye's sick in the bathroom. jessie had to get up at 6 in the fucking morning and she turned on her brightest damn light so i was awake the whole time, then i passed back out lol YET AGAIN and woke up to jessie gone but carlye coming in asking if she could lay next to me and how she was still drunk lol. So in all it was an interesting night, i forgot about clint and how sweet he's being at the momento, which isn't sweet at all so it was fun, and now it's the weekend..

      So last night Clint, Savnnah, Will and I all decided to go bowling..and me with my awesome directional skills...got lost lol. But we got there and did bumper bowling..I somehow completely suck lol got a couple strikes though. Will won the first game and I won the second...oh and Will fell on his face lol I felt bad but I called it cause he was bowling all funny lol. After that we went back to his house and just hung out, then Clint and I went to dairy queen for food and I dropped him off and I went to McDonald's..what a dinner. Thing's are getting a lot better between me and Clint which is really good but apparently not so well for Jessie and Allen. During school it was always me and Clint having the issues and so close to breaking up and now during the summer when everything should just be chill and fun..they fight all the time and actually did break up. For once I'm seriously not looking foward to school, usualy I get bored of summer and wanna see my friends but seems like Junior years gonna be a bitch and my friends are gonna be gone..still no Carlye, Jessie and Allen broke up, Zacks gonna be going to Pioneer and then Bean...well no one knows about bean..NICE CAR JACKASS! lol OH my license finally came in the mail...funny pic lemme tell ya. I'm sure I'll be pulled over enough for all the cops to stop and look at, and then of course laugh. Still no partying...at all. Straight edge..go me lol. Well gonna finish gettin ready hopefully see Clint along with Savannah today (no matter what you say Clint she's a cutie) so later on

      DRINKING AND DRIVING  "I went to a party, mom." I weent to a party, and rememvered what you said. You told me not to drink, mom so I had a sprite instead. I felt so proud of myself, the way you said I would, that I didn't drink and drive, though some friends thought I should. I made a healthy choice, and your advice to me was right as the party finally ended, and the kids drove out of sight. I got into my car, sure to get home in one piece, I never knew what was coming, mom something I expected least. Now I'm laying on the pavement, and I hear the policeman say, "the kid that caused this wreck was drunk," mom, his voice seems so far away. My own blood's all around me, as I try hard not to cry. I can hear the paramedic say,"this girl is gooing to die." I'm sure the guy had no idea, while he was flying high, because he chose to drink and drive, now I would have to die. So why do people do it, mom knowing that it ruins lives? And now the pain is cutting me, like a hundred stabbing knives. Tell sister not to be afraid, mom tell daddy to be brave, and when I go to heaven, put "Daddy's Girl" on my grave. Someone should have taught him, that it's wrong to drink and drive. Maybe if his parents had, I'd still be alive. My breath is getting shorter, Mom I'm getting really scared. There are my final moment, and I'm so unprepared. I wish that you could hold me mom, as I lie here and die. I wish that I could day I love you, mom so I love you and goodbye..

      hmm lots to tell. yesterday my dad went out of town so i had the house to myself and i thought why not have clint stay the night. so he told his mom he'd stay at zacks then i picked him up and came back to my house. i remembered i had a shitload of popov left and i was like, well we gotta get rid of it, so him and i basically split half a bottle of popov...yuck. clint saw all these leftover fireworks and wanted to take the sparklers to the beach and we were already drunk(obviously) so once we got there we lit em and i ran around and i hit the water and freaked out lol and clints just standing there with the sparklers burning him lol. so we came back, drank more then watched 13, at that point i don't remember anthing else. we stayed in the guest bedroom since the beds huge and i was ready  to pass out but clint wasn't and we got in this deep convo and i ended up crying telling him everything about my life and how it sucked, why i started cutting..everything and then he started crying to and i felt bad. then somewhere down the line i wake up and its barely light outside and clints just laying there looking at me and he was like, lets go watch cartoons lol so i got up and nothing was on but then we found THE GOONIES, and this is where i get way fuckin sick. from 6 30 till now 9 30 i have been doing nothing but fucking throwing up, and i NEVER get sick i'm the one that's not sposed too huh Carlye lol. so now i'm gonna go lay down, doubt it'll help cause i'm usually not that lucky, clint if you see this i'm really sorry lol last night got dramatic and this morning...well yea lol love you
