      My best friend in the world has turned on me  She says she loves but I don’t think she does I wish I were dead She says she wants to hang out but she never calls She used to sit next to me and trust me But it has changed  I used to be her best friend in the whole world But that has changed And whenever I think about it I cry  I actually cry  She said she was sick  So I made her a card (I even got Tommy Gus and Angela to sign it) And got her a beautiful flower from the store But when I called to see if I could go drop off her presents  She wasn’t there she had gone to the store with her other friend- her better friend (Even though she is always going on about how she doesn’t want to spend her money) And of course she didn’t call You can’t say this is jealousy  Because you know that this is hurt I wish she were here  And I wish I were dead (Not that she would care) And now my tears splatter the keyboard

      i hate this i am hiding this life the real me and no body knowss it i wish they did then they would ask me to talk to say what i want to say and then i could stop saying jst what they want to hear and mabye i could say what i want to hear and then mabye i would be happy with my self i wish i were me and not what they want to see it is sssooooo anoying trying to act like this just so they  can be happy of corse this kinda what every body wants for me to try and ft in and hid the real me because i go agaonst everything that my parents wanted me to be i hate every thing that  they hold so dear like stupid basseball ur camping or fishing.  they say that i have pinko liberal ideas what evr that means but i thnk that what i havve to say is right i think that we should try  to save the whales instead of helping themon thier way to extinction and they say it merely nature well it isnt it is more than that it is killing what god has so graciously given to us and putting it to ite death that isnt how they see it but that is how i do which is just one way thatwe are differnt
