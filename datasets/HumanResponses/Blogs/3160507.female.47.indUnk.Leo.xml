						   As far as I'm concerned the last ones standing should have been Fantasia Barrino, Jennifer Hudson and LaToya London. America should  NEVER  pick a person to go on because of race, creed or culture, let alone because they come from their local area! A person should be picked on their talent, stage presence and charisma! Ending word....  Fantasia!

						   At last week's mass our pastor talked about the receiving of communion. It was his belief that no one be denied that Holy Sacrament. He said it is not for him to judge, that is between the receiver of Communion and their maker. It seems the Catholic Churches Bishops don't all agree. Which is a shame. They should take heed from the Lord's actions for he never turned away a sinner. He made comment that they (sinners) needed him more than the non-sinner. Isn't that the truth, you don't treat the healthy you treat the sick. Now I know there are many who are feeling a bit aggressive at the Catholic Church right now. Mine is not against the Church itself but those who have not done right by the Church. Whether they are the committer of the sin or they are the ones who didn't take those who sinned (against others) out of the public workings! In my eyes both have sinned against humanity. But the Church as a whole, with so many millions of good people in association with it are not at fault. I don't agree with everything the Catholic Church says. I cannot abide to what doesn't sit true in my heart. The Catholic Church has to many times been a judge and this is something Jesus tell us not to do. I don't believe in abortion, but it is not for me to vote in a law, to what I believe is between a woman and her maker. For it  IS  her body to do what she wishes with. I am not to judge. The Catholic Church would totally disagree with me on this. What can I say, I'm "pro choice", and I  don't  believe in abortion, but that decision is for myself! I go to the Catholic Church because it was the religion I was raised on, so I am comfortable with the mass. But I believe any truly Christian service is fine, for I'm a Christian, that happens to go to a catholic Church. The Lord didn't start Christianity as many different sects. If you follow the Lord all you can be is Christian. Names are just labels, to be Christian is to follow Jesus!

						        How can people be racist, still in this day & age. If you think about it logically, being a racist isn't really too smart. You shouldn't be discriminating because some has more or less pigment in their skin and the texure and curl or lack of it is different from your own or your loved ones. Or because they might be a man or woman. That's like saying all purple velvet is good and all blue velvet is bad. Sounds pretty dumb doesn't it? You should always discriminate because of a person's character, morals & values are bad or evil. I'll take a church going family man over a con-woman/theif any day, dispite any race or color they may be. Yet racism still goes on today. I have had a close friend tell me, she still finds security follows her through a store because she happens to be black. This hurts me because I know how it makes her feel. She's such a wonderful person and I love her and as with anybody you love, you hate that she still has to endure any unhappy event like this. Even if it's only from "sometimes". I can hardly remember the last time something like that happened to me? Maybe when I was a giggly teenager acting as though I should be followed by security. Here we are in our forties now and it still happens to her. Be a little bit wary of  any  stranger, for even the nicest person can be a con man. If the feeling that you are better than another because of your color or race, stop and think about, what good reason do you have to treat this person as if they were below you. Are they acting obnoxious or rude, did you see them do something that wasn't in your own value or moral system. If you answered no to any of these questions, don't discriminate. Treat them as you would like to be treated. For God made  ALL  people! We  ALL  originate directly from him, which plainly means we all came from the exact same place! I'm not saying you shouldn't recognize differences, but celebrate those diffences! Learn from them. And also recognize the sameness and celebrate that also!

						   I'm just curious, what makes a truly good person? Is it what they do or what's on their minds? Here's why I ask.  Today I went to the store and used my ATM card, I asked for cash back. The clerk was busy talking to me as she handed me the twenty dollars I requested. She then bagged up my goods. She re-opened the register and then asked me, "Did I give you the cash back?" Immediately I said yes, but there was apart of me that thought, "Gee if I say no, I'll have an extra twenty bucks!" Point is I always try to do the right thing. I'd say 99.9% of the time I do the right thing. Usually if I did something wrong it wasn't intentional. Point is doing the wrong thing sometimes crosses my mind, even though I never end up doing it! Does a truly good person never have those wrong thoughts in their minds? Or is being a truly good person, what they end up doing. I don't know that's why I asked.

						    urlLink    me at 36   I was ten years younger here. I'm of Italian decent with not other races or nationalities here, that I know of, but I do suspect others. I have been mistaken for Native American and Geena Davis which I don't see. One time a native American man came into where I was working and started to talk to me in his native tongue. I looked at him strangely, I'm sorry I don't understand. "Shame on you! Don't you know any of your native language?" He said to me. I looked at him and said, "Well I know a little Italian, but that isn't Italian." He stood there for a moment with his eyes brows turned down, kind of studying my face. "There must be some Indian in you?" He asked. "Nope, just Italian!"

						   "Return from Tomorrow" was written by George G. Ritchie. It's a great book. It delves into what is not known. It's about a man who is clinically dead for twenty minutes. I'm interested in this subject because both my father and my maternal grand father had out of body experiences. I'm also interested in spiritual growth. The traditional ways to God are antiquated. As people we have progressed intellectually much from 2000 years ago. So should our intellect on spiritual growth and God should also be processing. If you don't believe in God, all I can say is I feel sorry for you because you honestly don't know what you are missing. I can't exactly explain it to you, but it's a richness and feeling of Love that envelops you. It makes you strong, I know, It makes me strong. It was amazing, as I lay having a heart attack, knowing I could die, I was not at all in fear of dying. I knew I was not alone and Love Himself was there with me. If anyone is interested I can tell that storey later. Anyhow back to the book tell the 3 different realms he was privileged to have seen. Boy so much he said made sense. Like the first realm he witnessed. It was the realm I think we call hell. As George says in the book The bible was interpreted into many languages from aramaic. Some translations weren't always correct. In hell they will be "tormented" not "tortured". Just as it says to "fear" the Lord, I more interpret it as be in "awe" of the Lord. Anyhow...(again), he saw tormented souls still craving their addictions, such as alcohol, tobacco, violence, perversions, but basically unwilling to fulfill those addictions. And only focused on that. How sad not to focus on love, like of the people you knew and missed on earth. He talked of a second realm that seemed very wonderful, "with music you never heard on earth". That statement rang so true to me because it's what my Grandfather told me about his out of body experience.  My granted told me this storey while he was dying of lung cancer. He was still home at the time but we all knew it was a mater of time. I was in my early twenties at the time. I was over my Grandpa's house with my Mom, she was there helping out. He was sitting in his chair and some how the conversion came around to his health. He said, "I'm not afraid of dying honey. I'm just not ready to leave yet". I asked him why not and he told me he was worried about my younger cousins, (under 10 years old). Their parents were in the mist of getting a divorce.  I also asked him why he wasn't afraid to die. He told me he had died once already. At this point my mother over heard and walked through the room scolding me saying something like "That's enough of this kind of talk". So intrigued and desperately wanting to know. I snapped back, "Mom this is something I really want to know about!" Grandpa said it was okay and proceeded to tell me this. "When your mother was young I got sick with meningitis and they told everyone that wasn't going to make it." He said. "I remember Ellen your Grandmother's sister there, holding her hand out to me. I looked at her and said what are you doing here your dead?" (My Aunt Ellen had died long before my Mom was even born. He had gotten hit by a car when she was only 15 years old. My Grandpa was dating Grandma when Ellen died). Grandpa now told me, "Ellen said," "I know, come with me." "as she held out her hand to me. So I took her hand and we were going so fast! I said to her, "aren't we going to run out of breath?" Ellen looked at me and said, "Not here." He said they were in a tunnel and heading for light. "Next thing I know I see my mother and father and some relatives who I didn't know, but I knew they were my relatives. And I saw a little boy I knew but who died in grade school". I asked, "How did you know it was him? Did he still look like a little boy?" He said he no he wasn't still a little boy, than yes he was, he said he couldn't explain it because he didn't have any words to explain it, but he just knew it was him. He said there was music unlike you have ever heard on this earth. And colors he had no names for. He said there was beautiful flowers never seen on earth. He said it was all so hard to explain everything because he just didn't have words to explain it. I asked how he knew it was real, "couldn't it have been a dream?" "No" he replied, it was more real that being on this earth feels real". Wow, I couldn't even comprehend that! "How could it be more real than here on earth?" "I don't know but it was," he said. Then he said next thing that happened is a Being all white came to him, Grandpa some how maid hint that it was Jesus without coming out and saying it. He said the Being told him it wasn't his time yet and he must go back. Grandpa told me he didn't want to come back it was so wonderful there, but when he thought of his family and their need for him, he had to go back. Next thing he knew he was back here in his sick body.  It seemed during this time while this was all happening to him, his body took a turn for the worst and they thought he was dead they gave him this horse tranquilizer (which now people use as recreational drugs) which somehow saved his life. Some people may say it was the drug. Knowing my Grandfather like I did I know it wasn't. If you knew him you would have to agree with me. He finally said that when he dies this time around he wants Ellen there and also his granddaughter Kerrie there too. (Kerrie was my cousin who died tragically at 15 of asphyxiation by a leaky exhaust of a car). My mother came in and let us know that she really wanted the discussion to end, so it did. When My Grandfather finally succumbed to lung cancer, he laid in his hospital bed unconsidered, with both arms stretched toward the ceiling. We, the immediate family, argued whether he was reaching out for Ellen and Kerrie or just trying to put his hands behind his head like he always did. Hey if he's was strong to hold them in the air then he was strong enough to put them behind his head. I knew he was reaching for them. My Dad had an out of the body express also, but he didn't seem to get as far. My Dad lost his arm when he was a construction worker. Seems he was sent out to fix a stone crusher. Seems there was no "lock, tag and try" back then. For those of you who don't know, "lock, tag and try" is something you do when working on machinery or vessels that might cause you some harm. You lock it out so it can't be used, you tag it so anyone who goes to use the machinery knows what's gong on and you try to use it or turn it on to make sure it can't be. Then you can safely work on it. Well like I said in those days they didn't do that yet, so as my dad is reaching into the store crusher to check the belt some one turned it on. The other guy that was working on it wasn't paying attention and some one slipped by him and turned it on. Well I was told when I was older (I was only 6 when it happened) that his arm was mangled to the point that it was to his knees. Stand up and put your hands to your side, to you knee is pretty bad! He said the guy that was with him was so panicked he was trying to push him through the machine instead of pulling him out. When they eventually did get him out that same guy kept putting the blanket behind my Dad's head as he lay there as my father kept taking it out and putting it under his own feet to help keep himself from going into shock. He knew to do this because he was a medic in the army. Well I guess my Dad told my Mom not to let the doctors take his arm. My Mom said that the doctor told her if they didn't take his arm my Dad would die. So my Mom gave them the okay.  My Dad says he remembers being on the operating table. Next thing he knew he was watching from the ceiling, seeing the tops of the doctors and nurses heads. He says he remembers the doctor giving up and one doctor sitting on the operating table, lighting up a smoke (yah a smoke,it was 40 years ago!) and saying, "Who's gonna tell the family?" My father says after a small discussion one of the doctors lifted an eye lid an observed his pupil. Seeing that there was a small amount of movement of his pupil a doctor alerted the others that there might still be a chance. Next thing he saw was one of the operating room staff stick something in his leg and the next thing he knew he was back in his body. Upon seeing one of the operating room doctors a at a later date, he told him of this experience. The doctor said it was impossible until my Dad told him what he observed, I'm sure flooring the doctor.  Back to the book (again...geez). The third realm...Well if your that interested read the book!

						   Ahhhh....Sorry it's not about lust! It's really about animal feelings.  I know there are many who believe what I believe, that animals have feelings. Many though are so many surprised at the realization that animals can have feelings. Something scientists seem to be just finding out about. This is what real animal lovers knew all along.  I think feelings are a sign of great intelligence. Sure animals can't do math equations, but what do they need to know that for anyway!  When you connect with an animal beyond the words that mean obey, you know that connection is spiritual. See, our feelings are the spiritual. They can be good or bad, but they are on a spiritual level.  So you may ask, "Does that make animals spiritual"? My answer from my heart says yes. How could God let you love an animal so much and then not let you reunite in the spiritual world?  God is Love and everything that Goodness implies. God will not disappoint, this I know to be true because I feel that truth in my heart. Some people call this a "gut" feeling. That "gut" feeling is Truth, Goodness and Love leading you in the right direction, protecting you. God is Love, Truth, and Goodness.  So you can say that your "gut" feeling is God protecting you. If you really look, you'll find God everywhere, even in our animals on earth. All animals have feelings treat them with respect always have mercy for them. Help them when abandoned or hurt. Be kind to them. Great rewards can come out of that. All that is living is made from one fabric, all connected somehow.

						   No mail because Ronald Reagan's funeral! Give me a break. Hey I don't remember this happening when Richard (I am not a Crook) Nixon died, although I very well could be wrong. I didn't like either one of them. I liked the "walking skeleton", Nancy even less. I bet Nancy and Martha Stewart are good friends. Don't they seem like they would be? Aren't they wealthy, snobby, better than the rest of us, kind of gals. Heck when Nancy & Martha probably looks at the American public, all they sees is hired help. I know sometimes I can be a bit harsh, hey, they have family & friends who love them and I say "Good Thing!". Anyhow back to the no mail cuz of Ronnie's funeral. Do you think they'll be no mail when Clinton dies? Or could it be maybe not because he got impeached or that's right, so did Nixon. Nope there'll be mail that day. I'm sorry but I really do think that's a poor excuse to get a day off. Man... if you work for the federal government you get all the good perks. Why not? The government is so big now, it thinks about feeding itself first, Iraq next and the rest of us in the USA last. Don't get me wrong I do love this Country and what it stands for. It's just getting to big to support itself. I think our government must simplify a bit. There are some crooks in our government, but the wind will blow weed seeds in the best of gardens.  I honestly don't think Reagan's funeral was a need for the federal government to take a day off. I don't think he'll be remembered like old Abe, Georgie or JFK.

						        Don't we live in the age of technology. Not only that people are so sophisticated. Even a guy "Kev" talking about this "Gentleman's club he works at, (no less!), has some writing skills about him. Although he claims only having a year and a bit of college. He writes, probably, pretty much like he speaks and for the most part, he speaks pretty well. Sometimes he'll write a sentence and there you will hang, shrugging your shoulders and saying to yourself,"WHAT?", (he is being clever, I hope?). I really do enjoy reading his Blog (a lot). How would I ever know about such stuff? I doubt I'd ever be in that kind of place, being a married woman and it ain't my bag. But to read about is fun and "Kev" keeps it interesting.      He uses the word fuck somewhat. But I, myself would rather hear or see the word fuck, bitch, bastard, asshole or any other word that doesn't take the Lord's name in vain. It still ain't to nice but hey everyone's different, right? Don't expect it too much here. Although I won't promise never to use an expletives, just not G.D. or J.C. here. I have just started to explore the other blogs.       So I really haven't delved deeply into any one quite yet. Still skim'n along, checking them out. So many so little time. I've been using Blogger's suggestions so far. They try to keep enough variety of subjects, so everyone can pretty much find a with their interests. There were other but their subject matter just wasn't of interest to me, so I just buzzed by.      One by Jerusalem Wonderings I think the name was, I just came across it today. I read enough to know I'll be back there!      Wow there are people out there doing only what I can dream about, at least they are kind enough to share these life events. Jerusalem is the number one place I want to go. Wish I had more to offer. Being a housewife really isn't too exciting. Oh I'm sure I have a few things that I could tell you, that you might find interesting, But hey, that's just gossip anyway. Ok "Kev's" might be a little gossipy, but just a little. Like I said where else could I ever see this part (A "Gentleman's Club), of our American culture.      One called Andy Kaufman returns. It started off pretty good and I do think he was doing great until he blew himself in. He caved into the complaining emails. There were some of us who got it. Sorry I didn't leave you a positive note, but I have a life, however boring that life might be, as least to you, not to me. That's why I have another blog with Beauty Secrects in it. Not many will read it put hopefully I may reach a few and help them while there young as well as older.      You know what....I'm going to make brownies now, with Peanut butter chips and some nice chocolate frosting. Boring but fun. see ya!

						   To me going to Church is important to thank our Creator for all that he has given to me that is good. I have much to be thankful for. But even more important is my relationship with God, Jesus, Holy Spirit. It is so much different than attending worship. It feels different and wonderful. It's a true happiness inside. It's a feeling of truth. I do know that "He" is always with me and loves me, it's a truth in my gut I cannot deny. I felt that truth as a child. As I grew I seem to loose touch with that truth as other things became more important, they shouldn't have. But as I became older I felt something missing and I didn't have that core happiness as I had as a child. It took some years but I found my way back to "Him" and that core happiness is back. I did it by talking to him silently about whatever. I for his help when I felt I couldn't cope or was afraid or sad. God always listens and always helps.  Edgar Cayce once said, "For all prayer is answered, don't tell God how to answer them". That is something to always remember. If you trust "Him" the out turn will always turn out for what "He" knows it right for you, not what you think is right for you. Maybe it didn't turn out the way you wanted, because maybe it was a lesson that needed to be learned. You should also remember that death on this earth is not the end. If you have lost a loved one, maybe you are sad because you miss them. But if you believe in "His" Goodness, Grace and mostly "His" Love. You needn't worry for you will be reunited with those loved ones. I know of people who blame God for what man has done. Example: Parents I knew had lost a daughter to a car accident and few years later lost their son the same way. They are bitter and blame God. In this time they needed God more than ever, but they turned away. It wasn't God who drove the opposing car that caused the accident, it was a person. Remember man has free will. So the person in the opposing car had the free will to make a bad judgment call that caused the accident. If you always turn to "Him" even the worst things can turn out well. I turned to "Him" when my marriage was in complete turmoil, it was an excruciating time in my life, but I prayed and talked to "Him". It is 14 years later and I am married to the same man and we are totally happy. A few month ago I had a heart attack, but I was never afraid, honest! I didn't like the pain and I knew I could die, but I knew "He" was with me so I had no fear. Surprisingly enough that event only brought me closer to "Him" and made me love "Him" even more! I can't quite put it into words or explain why, but that heart attack was a blessing, many good things came out of it. Many doubts I had disappeared, I was filled with more love for every being and everything. I'm not rich monetarily, but I am where it counts, spiritually! Make God number one in your life, I can guarantee you won't regret it.

						   I just watched a TV program called "Washington Wives" on one of those discovery/history channel type of things. Well the true meaning of that program was lost on me, when I saw that the 2004 presidential candidacy make hundred of thousands of dollars in a matter of days for their campaigns, ending up being millions of dollars. That just floored me! If people would only give like that to real charitable causes (and I don't mean the ones that telemarketers and the company's make more than the cause, there are a handful of real charitable causes that do use the telephone for donations, do your homework don't just give to any charitable organization that calls, use your computer, newspaper or public library should help find some good and real charity). Any how getting back to the subject If all that money that they used for campaigning, was given to those who really need it, we wipe out a hell of a lot of hunger and poverty in this country. We could give even the poorest a good enough education to give them a chance at a better life. I mean that money could give schools back their sports or arts programs or build up places for young people to go, like parks with tennis courts, basketball courts, a clean public pool. The possibilities for the good use this amount of money is endless. Yet these candidates need the money for television commercials, and for traveling around the country is big wonderful buses that probably cost hundred of thousands of dollars. They spend millions on their campaigns. And if there are two or more of them raising this kind of money...That's a lot of money! Their using this money to smooze for who knows for what? Pay that TV corporation millions for an ad, so that all the executives in that TV corporation get their $100,000.00 bonuses. I hear these candidates complain of an exhausting schedule. Yes I'm sure it's an exhausting schedule. But wouldn't you be more exhausted scrubbing someone else's house for $5.45 per hour, because you've graduated from high school but still can't read. Or waiting tables all day and hoping you make enough tips to cover the rent, let alone save for college. Don't you think you'd really be exhausted then. We really know how to squander money in this here USA, from the government on down. I hope one day to inherit one of those $54.99 (per) screw(s) the government paid for military use, put I won't ever pay that price unless I have a screw loose.  We need to quit squandering our resources and our money. We really need to buckle down and work on making this nation and world a better place. We really need look at our government and make improvements. This nation is a great nation, but that doesn't mean we don't need improvement.

						   My cousins son died yesterday. He was 20. The family is saying it was a heart attack, it was a drug over dose. This was my cousin's only son. I feel really bad for him. My Aunt is having an awful year. We found out a few months ago her eldest son is dying of inoperable cancer. He is 50 years old and has suffered from mental disease for 25 of those 50 years. She broke her arm a short time ago and my uncle burn his leg badly around the same time.  Actually this has been a bad year for the whole family. I had a heart attack 6 months ago. I'm only 46. My Dad is been suffering from depression and heart problems and has been hospitalized a few months ago. My Mom had a very large lump in her breast at the beginning of the year. Luckily it was a fibriod tumor only. But she is having problems with her kidneys. My nephew broke his finger badly and had pins inserted. My cousin had a hernia operation, she's still recovering. My 94 yr. old grandmothers health is starting to fail and her 94 yr. old boyfriend had severe pneumonia. There are lesser problems with family members... We are all doing fairly well dispite all the stuff that's been going on.
