      When the people you work with give you a going away present, you know you have been appreciated. When the present in question is a lamp, you know that the job was boring as fuck. When you are excited to receive the lamp in question, you know that a life of statistical number-crunching is not for you. Otherwise, your life will be filled with nothing but exciting new lampshades.  These past nine months working in Financial Aid have been the epitome of the pleasant office experience. If I had to stay in it another day, I would shoot you. But it’s the last day, the next-to-last paycheck, the desk-cleaning and the awkward questions about whether I could stay on just two more weeks and the awkward explanations that I need a month to, you know, fucking sleep for once. When I walk out of this office, it will be with a smile.  But the job has given me power. Nobody can fill out a FAFSA with the skill and poetic numbersmithing that I now can. You want a Pell Grant? I’ll pull some strings, nig. Want to get turned-down for the Parent Plus loan? I know a couple of easy-riding hooligan banks that will take the case. In short, I am a much, much whiter version of Herbert Kornfeld.  But now, to celebrate! An associate of mine has purchased a mysterious substance known as “B Plus,” which we will subject to rigorous scientific testing this evening. I have (perhaps unwisely) purchased an audio recorder to document said thorough testing. Transcripts may or may not be available in the future, depending on whether or not magical melting demons try to eviscerate my heartjelly.

      I'm a little disappointed in myself for not understanding the point to the new  Catwoman  movie. I consider myself pretty good at being able to spot which nerdy movies are going to be good ( Bubba Ho-Tep ), and which are going to be fucking awful (the new  King Arthur  movie, which looks like the screenwriters generated character sheets for each character "Lancelot totally gets the duel-weapon proficiency, but we'd better give him light armor!"). But the CW preview kept throwing me off. They looked fucking awful, but it was a different kind of fucking awful. Despite having played D&D pretty much constantly for eight years of my life, I couldn't figure out what was going on.   Until I saw the latest CW preview. The preview cuts to two investigators trying to figure out Catwoman's Modus Operendi, when one of the detectives explains, "This person is very self confident (paraphrase)."   Oh. I get it now. I'm not supposed to like this movie. It's not for fat, weed-smoking man-nerds like myself, but rather for fat, rasberry-vodka drinking femme-nerds, to teach them that one day they could become svelte vixens so long as they believe in themselves and don't listen to that asshole football player who makes fun of your forearm scars.   So there you go, nerdy bitches of the world; I make my peace with you. Leave us to our Fritz Leiber books and our Yes CDs, and we'll leave you to your Redwall books and Fleetwood Mac CDs, and we'll both be happy. But really, stop cutting yourself. Now. And crystals, even the pretty ones, aren't made of magic. That is all.

      It has been very pleasant working with you for the past eight months, and I'm quite sorry that the football coaches yelled at you today because one of their players isn't getting his Work Study check. Please keep in mind that, should you need my services, I will only be working at the university for a month, and do not care about damaging my career. Also, I own a hickory stick, should the coaches be immune to diplomacy.   Yours,   Unsober.
