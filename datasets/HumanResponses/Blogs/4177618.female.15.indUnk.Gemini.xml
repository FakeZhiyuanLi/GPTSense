      Yup. That's right, I actually talked to him yesterday. However, I think I might have pissed him off, despite what he says. I don't know! I really want to apologise... but I'm afraid. Of him being angry with me. I just.. don't like being on anyone's bad side. But if I apologise, I'll have to clarify what I meant, but I'm not sure how to do that...  I hate this.  -----  Session Start (Fri Aug 20 00:05:25 2004 Me: Alright, so I have another, if slightly more stupid, question. Kyle: hit me! Me: er.. well, that wasn't wuite what I had in mind, but.... Me: :D Me: Anywho. I was wondering about, if you could only be remembered for one thing, what would it be? Kyle: wow Kyle: thats a big question Me: yeah, I realized that after I actually thought about it Kyle: i dont know Kyle: i'd hate for it to sound like a cliche... but i'd like to inspire someones life. even if its just to one person Me: ... what else were you going to say? Kyle: i dont know Kyle: its a really dep question Kyle: something id have to think about Me: well, you could always think and get back to me Kyle: yeah Me: a reason to keep in touch, which we haven't really been doing too much. Kyle: what about you? Me: me? I only thought about it for a bit, but I think I'd want to be remembered for being myself. Like... I dunno. Being able to inspire people would be nice, but I can't see it happening, if only because... I dunno. Just being myself I guess.... Me: of course, that would mean taking the good stuff, like any maturing and goodness I may have had, with the bad stuff, like how much I still had to do to meet even my own standards. Which are pretty loose sometimes. Especially when I'm around the people who don't expect me to be as mature as I should be. Kyle: right...but the thing is... this question is like asking what do you hope to achieve in yout life Kyle: i think its something that slowly answers itself with time as you get older Me: I really hope so. Kyle: its pretty much like asking what the meanig of you life is Me: I suppose... and as I was trying to get my mind around saying, I think it's just to... mature, and learn more about yourself and life... and that's still not quite what I want to say. I just can't put it into words. Me: And that doesn't explain why we do this... why do we have morals? Me: heh. that sure got my mind moving, I suppose. Kyle: i know Me: ...you were going to add on again Kyle: was i? Kyle: lol Me: well, it looks like it. the thing keeps saying that you're still typing, but nothing else ever comes up. Me: so... what exactly are the lyrics for And Still? Me: ..I must seem like a stalker sometimes. It's not on purpose, I swear. I'm just really curious about your band. Kyle:  (I'm cutting them out 'cause they're copyrighted, methinks.)  Me: ah. I can hear it now. Heh. Funny how that works. Kyle: i know Me: of course, it isn't the best quality recording, but that's perfectly understandable too. Did you write it on your own? Kyle: yeah Kyle: you gonna buy the CD Kyle: its 5$ Me: mm. And I seem to recall you saying that you had no idea what romantic love was like.  Kyle: and there are 5 songs Me: I totally will, but I don't know when I'd ever get the chance Kyle: lol Kyle: i dont Me: lol Me: you jsut write about Me: just Me: it Me: that was some horrible grammar.... Kyle: i dont know... that songs just about how someone can hurt you so bad but you'll still love them Kyle: is a really simplified summary Me: yes, I suppose. it just seems to be about love Me: maybe I"m just overly romantic. craving roses and stuff. heh. Kyle: no Kyle: its about love Me: but not romantic love? Kyle: no, it is... but its not about real love... its like loving something that not only you'll never have but that will hurt you Kyle: but as much pain as you go through at the hands of this love... you still love Me: ... yeah... a very realistic concept. Unfortunately. Well, depending on your outlook, I suppose. But the ideal world isn't about to come along. Me: So, when will I get to buy the cd? Kyle: at a show  Me: oh yeah? when's the next one? Kyle: not sure Kyle: i'll keep you posted Me: heh. alright. yet another reason to keep in touch. Music. Me: hey, do you want a card for your birthday? Kyle: nah no need for that... thanks for the message on nexus Kyle: :) Me: yeah. sorry if it sounds kinda cheesy. I sound like that a lot when it's two in the morning. which it normally is for me. eheh.... Me: I need a better sleeping pattern. Kyle: lol Kyle: thanks for offering though Kyle: for the card Me: well, if you change your mind, I'm sure I can think of something to draw for you. I'm still lacking in much inspiration. which makes me very unhappy, in general. Me: you know, I still associate "hear you me" with you. I dunno why. Kyle: lol Me: yeah, and it's a pretty depressing song to be associated to, too. Kinda stupid, especially since you're not dead or anything. I guess it has to do with it having been your display name at onep oint or something. Me: wow, I've been talking a lot. again. Me: you never complain. why is that? Kyle: lol Kyle: cause i dont mind it Me: don't mind what? my mindless blathering? yeah, but... you never complain about anything else either Kyle: lol Kyle: i complain about a lot of things... Me: but not to me Me: which is bad, because I'm one for fair exchange Me: not that I can force you or anything, but it would make me feel better. Less guilty about dumping all sorts of stuff on you all the time. Kyle: i dont mind it... its all good Me: are you sure? Me: never mind, of course you are Kyle: lol Me: we really don't know each other that well, do we? I mean, we know about some of the weird stuff most people don't even care about, but we only know general stuff about our normal lives. weird. Kyle: thats cool though Kyle: its like we skipped all the small talk Me: skipped to what, though? Me:  would you actually consider me a friend or something ilke that? Kyle: yeah Kyle: of course Me: you really are something else. most people our age would look at me funny and run  away. Kyle: i hate those people Me: yes, but you've been friends with them in the moderately recent past. Mr: unless that was more of you being incredibly polite and putting up with whatever they threw at you... for a time. Kyle: who are you talking about Me: Well, I suppose this is a rather prejudiced view, too, because I haven't really gotten to know them since your friends grew up, but... most of your friends actually would have done that, last I knew them moderately well. Kyle: who? Me: Of course, since I've known a bunch of them since elementary, we all have this old image that would probably take some thinking to break down, and while I've realized that you wouldn't actually be friends with people like that, I just get the feeling that they wouldn't like me anymore, and I'm rambling again. But mostly, just the people who went to EMP for elementary. Me: and I think I might have just really offended you. Kyle: no Kyle: not at all Kyle: i dont agree with it completely though Me: well, feel free to correct me. I'm dying to know that I can give up that image. Kyle: i dont know... ive gotta go to sleep though Kyle: have a good night! Me: figures Me: alright, g'night Session Close (Fri Aug 20 01:28:18 2004)  -----  And now I'm afraid to talk to him. Goddamnit! I hate this whole situation! Why can't I jsut get over it and be satisfied with being his friend? And why the hell did I bring up anything about his other friends? AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRG! Fuck.  And he's the only other one online right now. Goddamnit.  Alright. I did it. I just don't know what he'll say.

      So, I'm beginning to question this method of getting over Kyle. Because all it's really doing is reminding me of all the reasons I had the crush in teh first place. I mean, there is no real emotional reason to give up on him.  However, if I don't give him up now, I'll be stuck with this feeling of loss, as has happened before when I lost touch with the guy I obsessed with. Of course, that was Ian, and I was in grade 5 at the time, but it was still very uncool. I miss Ian, too. I want to know how he turned out. He should have graduated this year.  But that's not the point. This is supposed to help me get over him, and I really, really need to, don't I?  Don't I?    Goddamn.

      Session Start (Wed Aug 18 22:52:31 2004) Me: hey Kyle Session Close (Wed Aug 18 22:58:32 2004)   Session Start (Wed Aug 18 23:04:14 2004) Me: hey Kyle: hey Kyle: ! Me: is summer school over yet? Kyle: yeah Kyle: it was only july Me: that's good Kyle: i got 78 Me: not bad Me: in fact, pretty good for having to shove it all into one month Kyle: its good for me... especially for math Me: mm Me: so you've seen American History X? Kyle: yeah Kyle: with edward norton Kyle: so good Me: yup Me: agreed Me: a bit depressing at the end, but that's life, I suppose... Kyle: yeah... i liked how it ends Me: er.. with the kid getting killed? Kyle: cause its real.. it doesnt end well and thats the way things go. but i liked the very end how he ended it with a quote Me: Yeah, I suppose. And the quote was good, Me: but still depressing. Me: and Big Fish, I see Kyle: thats the point though Me: that reality sucks, but we have to live with it? Kyle: i think  thats what they were trying to achieve Kyle: exactly Kyle: and die by it Me: I suppose. Me: you really liked english class, right? Session Close (Wed Aug 18 23:18:23 2004)   Session Start (Wed Aug 18 23:36:27 2004) Me: should I bother asking where you went? Kyle: computer shut off Me: oh. not cool. Me: Moody Blues! I didn't realise anyone else had been corrupted by their father's taste in music. Me: I'm also reading your nexus profile because my internet is not letting me look at other people's. Kyle: hahah Kyle: the moody blues rule Me: mm Me: so, what makes you think you can't get women? Kyle: lol Kyle: because i cant get them Me: pft. I suppose you have certain ones in mind, because otherwise, I could list quite a few who have had a crush on you in the past year Me: or we could go for a less uncomfortable subject. diong any shows anytime soon? Kyle: nah... Me: mm. too bad. Me: so I see you guys changed your name Kyle: yeah Me: probably a good thing, because the old name is probably copyrighted Kyle: yeah... but its kind of a gimmick Kyle: it seems Me: changing your name? Session Close (Thu Aug 19 00:05:07 2004)  -----  Yeah. Another episode of idiocy on my part. I shouldn't have asked him. Not only does it make me seem like more of a stalker than I hope I am, it just itches to have me insert that I am on that list.  But no. Why the hell didn't I say it?

      The following is brought to you by a few long hours of changing names so as to make the following conversations readable. Comments may be inserted when possible.  -----  Session Start (Sun Apr 25 19:24:50 2004) Me: hi Kyle: hey Kyle: whos this again? Me: Miriam. Kyle: mirriam ayles? Me: yeah... Kyle: really? Me: is there a reason why it shouldn't be? Kyle: lol Kyle: i didnt think it would be Me: understandable Kyle: lol... awesome(H) Me: er... thanks. Kyle: so hows it going? Me: not bad. you? Kyle: same deal Me: anything new going on in your life? Kyle: not really Kyle: but i g2g eat Kyle: later Me: bye Session Close (Sun Apr 25 19:33:10 2004)   The first conversation. Amazing. I'm honestly amazed I ever worked up the courage at all...   Session Start (Mon Apr 26 20:21:40 2004) Session Close (Mon Apr 26 20:21:45 2004)   Session Start (Wed Apr 28 19:04:50 2004) Session Close (Wed Apr 28 19:05:05 2004)   Session Start (Wed Apr 28 22:05:23 2004) Session Close (Wed Apr 28 22:06:17 2004)   Session Start (Fri Apr 30 22:18:46 2004) Session Close (Fri Apr 30 22:20:28 2004)   Yes, there will be more such pathetic-ness later on in this, trust me. I may have had some guts, but not that many.   Session Start (Fri Apr 30 22:20:45 2004) Me: hi Kyle: hey Me: how's life? Session Close (Fri Apr 30 22:28:19 2004)   This happens a lot, too. Questions asked, and never answered. Especially one question, but that comes later.   Session Start (Fri Apr 30 22:35:50 2004) Me: do you mind if I ask you an intellectual question? Kyle: no Kyle: lets hear it Me: heh Me: well, I was actually wondering about your views on religion. Kyle: i think people should be free to believe in whatever they need to believe in. personally i dont believe in any religion. i find it kind of pointless trying to make up answers to  questions that have no answers.  i dont know why i'm here and it really doesnt matter to me. as long as i'm here and im livivng, i'd rather not spend my life worshiping a book. a book which was based upon the word of abraham and his theory of creation. religions can be a good thing. they set morals and values for people who would otherwise comit crime and do terrible things, it provides comfort for people needing to know that everything will be alright in the end and it answers peoples questions and keeps people from worrying so much about everything.  it could also be a bad thing because many wars are started because of religion and many people die and kill in the name of their god. Me: mm. Me: and somehow, that doesn't surprise me. Kyle: lol Kyle: what do you mean? Me: well, you just don't seem likethe kind of person to follow something religiously. But you are the kind that would other people have free will too. and I agree completely. Kyle: anything you would add? Me: not really Me: thank you for that. Kyle: hahaha... i enjoy this type of thing Kyle: better then small talk Me: true Me: it's nice to have to use my brain occasionally Kyle: always Kyle: cept im pretty dumb so its not the same case Me: your self-confidence is so over-whelming Kyle: how? Kyle: lol Kyle: oh wait Kyle: sarcasm:) Me: that would be it, yeah. Me: ^-^ Kyle: well its kinda hard to hear the sarcastic tone when you're typing Me: true Me: and it would help if you actually knew me. I'm sarcastic more often than not. It's a bad habit. Kyle: lol Kyle: sarcasms good in moderation Me: mm. but it normally makes me sound... bitchy is reallythe only word that comes to mind. Kyle: depends how you say it, you can say it to sound insulting and you can also say it and sound humourous and like a joke Kyle: from the sarcasm ive heard from you, you usually fall intot the second category Me: well, thanks, I guess. Me: I normally try for the second one, if I actually think about it. Me: My mouth tends to open before my brain realises what's going on Kyle: lol Kyle: interesting Me: it's true though. especially during sports, like soccer. I tend to say the stupidest things. Or crudest. Or both, occasionally. and now I'm rambling. Kyle: lol Me: yeah... so.. do you have anything interesting to say? as I think I might either bore or scare you if I continue. Kyle: lol Kyle: im not a very interesting person Me: sure you are. if you can at least pretend to keep up with me while I'm rambling, I'm sure there's something interesting going on in your mind. Kyle: well Kyle: im writing a song Me: that's more than I can do. I'm so bad at poetry. Me: what's it about? Kyle: thoughts about next year Me: mm Kyle: leaving essmy, leaving people, losing friends when i get into a new school Me: you get it! Kyle: im pretty much picturing all my good friends going off into different groups and leaving me. which is a terrible thought because ive never had such good friends Me: yeah. don't you hate growing up sometimes? Kyle: yeah for sure Kyle: i really hope that i dont lose friends or change somehow for the worse Me: that's what I'm most afraid of right now. I can just see me drifting away from everyone I'm so close to this year. It's really scary. Kyle: my sisters in grade ten this year and both happend to her Kyle: yeah Me: where are you going next year? Kyle: PK Kyle: you? Me: Old Scona. It's in Edmonton, and it's pretty much the brain school of alberta. I am actually scared. Kyle: thats gonna be tough Kyle: i feel for you Me: yeah, thanks. and no, that's not sarcastic. Me: Are you the only one going to PK? Kyle: haha, no, pretty much all my friends are going there. i know you have it way worse, but i think it'd be terrible if everyone drifted and i'd have to see them everyday only to be reminded of friends i once had Me: .. Me: you really do think poetically, you know. Kyle: lol, or logically Me: and I do have one friend with me Me: well, I suppose you could call it logic, but emotions are rarely logical, so... Kyle: lol Kyle: maybe they cant be explained... but theres always reasons for feeling emotions Kyle: although at the time you feel them, you sometimes dont know it yet Me: I guess. Me: Have you considered psychology when you go into university? Me: you're just really good at describing this stuff. Kyle: nah... doesnt really appeal to me Me: okay. Me: so what does appea to you? Kyle: i dont know what i wanna do really Me: no kidding. Kyle: music, but its hard to make a descent career out of that Me: exactly. Unless you make it big, you're going to need at least one other job Kyle: i like working with computers too Me: really? Me: I never really thought of you as a computer person. Kyle: why not? Me: I dunno. It just never occured to me. It should have, though. You do have logical thinking, apparently. Me: and computers are basically logic, with a bit of luck sometimes. Me: do you ever have questions you wish you had the guts to ask? Kyle: haha... yeah, all the time Me: why don't you ask them? Kyle: fear i guess... of rejection or judgement Me: ...you really do work for the image you have, don't you? Me: that was a really stupid question. Me: sorry. Kyle: hahah Kyle: what do you mean? Me: well, it's just that you make it seem so easy. Do you realise that no one actually hates you? Kyle: hahaa Kyle: people hate me Me: who does? name three. Me: oh god, this is such an overdone conversation, never mind. Kyle: mark, dave i know for sure Me: really? Me: heh. Kyle: yeah Kyle: i dont know if mark hates me... but he resents me quite a bit Me: I would offer a high-five, but that's kinda difficult over the internet Kyle: for everything ido Kyle: haaha Kyle: not anymore Kyle: with the emoticons Kyle: anything is possible Kyle: (h5) Me: I don't like to use emoticons Kyle: but its a hi five Me: okay, fine Me: (h5) Kyle: YES! Me: wow, I feel so.. corrupt... Me: ^-^ Kyle: lol... its not corruption... more just letting go, for some good hi fives Me: I guess. It just doesn't feel right to be saying I'm doing something when I'm not, though. Me: even if it is just a high five. Me: do you ever feel really stupid? not because of anything like math, though. I mean stupid because you're getting upset over something that's really nothing in the big picture, and you know, but you can't help but get upset?  Me: and again with the rambling. Me: I think I'll just stop typing. Kyle: everyone feels like that sometimes Me: yeah Me: and the words won't come out right now. Me: this is really weird. I don't normally talk like this to anyone... Kyle: lol Kyle: yeah Me: does this happen to you alot? people telling you stuff, and you probably don't really care either way? Kyle: sometimes people tell me stuff... but i always care Kyle: its stupid to just not care about people Kyle: i cant do that Me: mm Me: charisma and empathy. that's what you have. Me: I'm jealous. I have no charisma.  Me: andI should really stop listening to depressing music. Kyle: haha, i dont really have charisma, and why would you say you dont? and no. never stop listening to depressing music Kyle: just balance it out with some ska and punk Me: heh Kyle: and other happy music  Me: I'll try. Me: and I would say that I don't have charisma because I'm really not that good with people. Notice how I'm one of the more unpopular people in our school. Which is alright, I guess, because it means I'm allowed to be myself for the most part. Why do you think you have no charisma? Kyle: haha... popularity business is bullshit Kyle: people take that for way too much Me: true, but sometimes, I just wich people wouldn't look at me with contempt Me: wish Kyle: everyone gets that though, no matter who you are, or what you stand for, or what you are there'll always be people like that Kyle: wether it be through envy, or even just someone thinking theyre better then someone Kyle: but in that case you can life right at them, cause they know nothing Me: heh. yeah. Me: I"m not sure if you're telling yourself this at the same time, or if you're just being my logical side Kyle: people look at me the same way, although it maybe for different reasons, theres always people who arent gonna like what you are. and those are the people you gotta ignore cause frankly, they're just not worth thinking about Me: yeah. Me: I really hate labels, and the social spectrum, and the way we can't deviate without being looked down upon.  Me: god, I've got to stop whining at you Kyle: i agree completely  Kyle: labels serve no purpouse other then to divide Kyle: and once you've been judged, you're pretty much regarded the same wether or not you try and break out of that label Me: you've tried to break out of your label, haven't you? Kyle: yeah, although i dont really see myself as a label and ignore otehr peoples labels for me so theres nothing to really break out of Kyle: but in grade 7, i was a completely different person Kyle: i had actually no friends Me: true Me: I remember Kyle: and i was labeled... i tried to break out of it, and it worked... now i dont really care, my attitude towards everything has completely changed since those days Kyle: for the better though Me: that's a good thing. If you still had that mentality now, you would be worse than Mark and Dave Me: I'm actually glad you're different. Me: it means one less person to try to ignore. Me: what's a good ska band? Kyle: mad caddies Kyle: operation ivy Kyle: mighty mighty bosstones Kyle: reel big fish Me: heh Me: thanks Me: so, any whining you need to do? I'm starting to piss myself off, and it'd be nice to know I'm not alone. Kyle: maybe another day, i gotta go now... so have a good night! Me: okay Me: I might see you tomorrow at the Ender thing Kyle: g'night Kyle: you going? Me: if Adele got me a ticket, yeah Kyle: yeah Kyle: abbey dropped them off at her place today Me: cool Kyle: i was with her Me: heh Me: yeah, I saw you going to Brad's with her Kyle: yeah Kyle: but i'll see you later Me: yeah. but you were going to bed Me: g'night Session Close (Sat May 01 00:08:30 2004)   This will now be known as the "big conversation". That's right. The conversation lasted from 10:35 until 12:08. An hour and a half. Most of which was spent carefully stopping myself from telling him that I had a crush on him. Yes, you'd better believe it. So many times, I almost told him. And it's only blatantly obvious. And I could say so much more about this, but for the sake of the already extreme length of this post, I'll refrain from further comment.   Session Start (Sun May 02 20:34:43 2004) Me: hey Me: I just thought I'd apologise for whining at you on Friday Kyle: lol Kyle: dont apologise Me: heh Me: too late Session Close (Sun May 02 20:36:31 2004)   And then, and hour later...   Session Start (Sun May 02 21:29:46 2004) Me: so how'd you like the show? Kyle: it was so good Kyle: you go? Me: yup Me: we missed the first half because we were waiting for someone who didn't show up Kyle: you see me? Me: no, I didn't. I saw everyone but you. And Abbey. Kyle: haha Kyle: shitty Me: mm Kyle: i was in the mosh pit o the hardcore pit the whole time Kyle: *or Me: yeah, I figured. I was on railing/wall thing at the back once we gave up and came in. Kyle: haha Me: go me the unadventurous one, right? Kyle: lol Kyle: did you catch enders set? Me: yup. I loved it. Forgot to buy the cd, though. Me: so how's that song you're writing? Me: unless you're done writing it. Kyle: its ok Kyle: im not done Kyle: the musics all done though:) Me: oh good. Me: what's it going to be about? Kyle: losing something Kyle: or someone Me: to death? or something else? Kyle: no Kyle: change i guess Kyle: mistakes made Me: ah. Me: being human. Kyle: yeah Me: I wish I could write songs. I just never know how to say it. Me: wow. I'm reapeating myself. Me: and mispelling stuff too. goody. Me: so why don't you update the pretty in pink website anymore? Me: my mind wanders alot. sorry about that. Kyle: cause durells the one doing it Kyle: and hes lazy Me: heh Me: he's not even in it though Me: although, if none of you know html, I guess that makes sense Me: so, how much Jimmy Eat world do you listen to? Kyle: lots Me: mm. nice. Me: have you heard "hear you me"? Me: it's about losing someone too. Me: but to death, not change. Kyle: yes i have Me: did you like it? Kyle: yeah Me: that's good. Session Close (Sun May 02 22:06:27 2004)   And five minutes later...   Session Start (Sun May 02 22:11:15 2004) Me: so, my mind is wandering again. if you could ask anyone one question, and recieve an honest answer, what would it be? Kyle: lol Kyle: thats a tough one Kyle: i cant answer that really Me: heh. Me: that's a first. Me: do you have an art request? I have yet to recieve one I'd be perfectly willing to do. I did them anyway, but that's beside the point. Me: or not. that works too. Session Close (Sun May 02 22:28:28 2004)   This just shows what an impatient bitch I can be.   Session Start (Sun May 02 22:42:49 2004) Me: so... do you not have a request, or are you jsut ignoring me? Session Close (Sun May 02 22:44:07 2004)   Very impatient, apparently.   Session Start (Sun May 02 22:44:35 2004) Kyle: oh sorry Kyle: i was gone Me: ah Me: getting ready for bed Me: ah Me: sorry Me: never mind, then. I'll try to muster up some imagination on my own. ^-^; Session Close (Sun May 02 22:49:12 2004)   Extremely impatient. Someone kick me, please.   Session Start (Mon May 03 20:37:07 2004) Me: You used it as a name! Me: That just made my day, thank you. ^-^ Kyle: hahaha Kyle: yeah Session Close (Mon May 03 20:39:53 2004)   Yes, he had changed his name to "may angels lead you in, hear you me my friends", which are(obviously enough) some lyrics from the song Hear You Me, by Jimmy Eat World, which was mentioned in one of the conversations above. And yes, it did make my day.   Session Start (Mon May 03 22:23:36 2004) Me: sorry to bug yuo again, but I'm really curious about your songwriting process Kyle: ummm Kyle: well its easier to write the music first, then you have a basic idea of what the lyrics should sound like and what they should express Me: makes sense Kyle: then i find a topic, usually something thats happened to me in the past or just recently or sometimes its a situation i can see myself in Kyle: sometimes its not even about me, its about someone else Kyle: it depends Kyle: then i find a structure, and build on that Kyle: not every songs written the same way so its kinda hard to generalise it Kyle: but thats one way Me: okay Me: so that's how you're writing the current one? Kyle: yeah Kyle: the music inspired a rhythm which helped words flow easier Me: yeah. sounds like... well, some sort of abstract fun, I guess. Session Close (Mon May 03 22:52:52 2004)   Yeah, I still can't write songs worth a damn, as far as I'm concerned. ^-^; I dunno. Maybe I haven't actually tried. I am the Slacker Queen, after all.   Session Start (Tue May 04 22:33:20 2004) Kyle: hey Me: hey Kyle: i got a question Me: shoot Kyle: for the setting paragraph, can you use vague character refferences Kyle: ? Me: depending on how you phrase it Kyle: what would be a good way to phrase it? Me: well, it depends on what you're referring to Me: writing depends on all sorts of stuff, apparently. Me: what's the sentence? Me: wow, I feel so useless... Kyle: i wanna explain about the knowledge it took for tengo to break free from the setting of the farm into the city   Me: hmm Me: that's a hard one Me: let's see... Kyle: can you help me apply knowledge to the setting Kyle: i'm really having a hard time with this Me: no kidding Me: I'm suddenly really glad I got lazy and chose change. Kyle: knowledge is easy Kyle: just not for setting Kyle: the entire stories based on knowledge and realization Kyle: i just cant apply it to setting Me: maybe if you tried to attach it to social setting? Me: or mood/atmosphere... Me: it's just kinda hard to apply something intangible to a physical setting Kyle: yeah Me: well, I have no idea what you do or don't have written so far, so I can try to just throw ideas in the air... Kyle:  it talks about how the on the farm the black people knew little about the injustices and the opression that was going on in the city but the people in the city were aware of this but were confined by law. so change or improvment was hard to achieve. then i talk about apartheid and hw it made it difficult for a black person to get an education  Kyle: my theme statement is "knowledge often leads to a greater understanding of the injustices in society and a desire to rectify these injustices."  Me: good theme. Me: hmm... black people on the farm had an especially hard time gaining knowledge, as they had to leave their families to gain and education in the city. Me: minus the typos. Kyle: lol Me: that might work as a transition between farm and city... unless I"m going off in the wrong direction Me: and then you could possibly start in on the details of the city. or township. *shrug* Session Close (Tue May 04 23:22:51 2004)   That's right. The only time he started the conversation, he wanted help on English homework. I think this says more about what he and his friends thought about me than anything in the "big conversation". I dunno. I hope not, but...   Session Start (Wed May 05 19:29:08 2004) Me: so how goes your setting? Me: paragraph Kyle: its good now Me: oh good Me: was I any help, or did you figure it out on your own? Kyle: you helped quite a bit Kyle: thanks a lot Kyle: :) Me: no problem Me: ^-^ Session Close (Wed May 05 19:32:14 2004)   I fish for compliments way too often. Yet another bad habit. Gnerk.   Session Start (Tue May 11 22:53:03 2004) Me: hey Me: what events are you going to be in tomorrow? Kyle: no idea Me: heh Me: well, what are you good at? Kyle: nothing Kyle: haha Me: heh Me: right Me: what do you like to do, then? Kyle: nothing Kyle: i can do shotput and discus Kyle: and i guess 100m Me: oh wow, your enthusiasm is overwhelming Kyle: and longjump Kyle: and 800meteres Kyle: woah Kyle: thats not how you spell it Me: true Kyle: meters Kyle: i guess Me: yeah Me: this is the one problem with immersion, you confuse alot of words Kyle: yeah Session Close (Tue May 11 23:25:15 2004)   This was the day before Track Day, the day in which all of the junior high students at our school go out to the nearest track and spend the day going through track and field events. The ones who place in the top three of any event go to districts. I didn't go anywhere. Kyle did. Amazing, the things life throws in your face.   Session Start (Sun May 30 00:33:42 2004) Session Close (Sun May 30 00:33:56 2004)   See? I told there would be more pathetic-ness. And this doesn't mark the end of it. Oh no, it gets worse.   Session Start (Sun May 30 01:11:20 2004) Me: I have another "intellectual" question, but this one you might not want oanswer Kyle: lol Kyle: ok Kyle: lets hear it Me: what is love? like, is it psychological dependance or is it actually something of the "heart", or something like that? Me: There's actually going to be something written out of this, but it might not have your answer as part of it. Kyle: im not sure exactly how to describe love. ive never felt it myself. and people who have, or claim they have always seem to be exagerating it. as if "being in love" is some sort of state Me: mm Kyle: i guess you could say its a dependance... but thats not really a definition. its more of an affect of the emotion Kyle: i think its just strong feelings you have for someone. caring, always wanting the best for someone and always willing to sacrafice anything in order to make that person happy Kyle: for me, love is an emotion. to others its almost like some sort of force Kyle: love is a tricky subject and its meaning is blurred. i think i'll know when i feel it though Me: okay Me: thank you Kyle: lol... sorry i cant be too much help Me: well, you're better than the dictionary Me: not difficult Me: but sitll Kyle: i just dont really understand it. its hard to explain an emotion that i know nothing about Kyle: i love people Kyle: but like romantic love is completely foreign to me Kyle: but i love my family and close friends Kyle: iunno... love isn't something i think needs to be defined Kyle: for a few reasons Kyle: love means different things to different people Kyle: and its hard to find words to describe such a powerful emotion Me: okay Kyle: :) Me: ^-^ Me: and now my mind is working too fast. I suppose that's a good thing, but it's slightly confusing. ^-^; Session Close (Sun May 30 01:32:03 2004)   Yes, that's right. I was asking him about love. On the morning of my birthday, to boot. I can't believe I actually did that, though. Although it's true that I was trying to write something from it. I wonder if I'll ever finish it? Mm... doubt it.   Session Start (Sun May 30 01:37:59 2004) Me: well thanks. I'm gonna go try to sleep. I"ll see you on Monday. Me: g'night. Session Close (Sun May 30 01:38:50 2004)   Session Start (Wed Jun 02 16:48:44 2004) Me: so how much are tickets? Kyle: 7:) Me: okay Me: thanks Session Close (Wed Jun 02 16:51:13 2004)   He always advertised for upcoming shows in his display name. This is in reference to a show that never actually happened. That'll be explained later.   Session Start (Thu Jun 03 22:19:54 2004) Kyle: what times grad at? Me: it starts at six, I think Session Close (Thu Jun 03 22:28:17 2004)   As demonstrated previously, the only times he started the conversations were when he wanted to know something, whether it be homework or times for our grad. Such a boost to my confidence, I'm sure.   Session Start (Thu Jun 03 22:28:32 2004) Me: so has anyon asked you to dance yet? Kyle: no Kyle: lol Kyle: i think im just gonna go alone Kyle: i like it like that Me: that's good Kyle: yeah Me: well, do you mind if I claim a song? Kyle: hahaa, nope Me: thanks. ^-^ Kyle: but i will be dressed like a fool Kyle: just so you know Kyle: but you gotta come and get me if you want a dance Me: yeah, I had heard a few of your comments... Me: I'm sure I can find you. If you'll really be dressed weird, it probably won't be that hard. Me: oh! I thought of another question Me: if you could hear people's thoughts, what would you do? Kyle: what do you mean? Kyle: know what other thought about me? Me: well, if you could just pick one person, and be able to hear everything they thought. about everyone, not just you. Kyle: who would i chose? Me: anyone Kyle: i still dont really get what you're asking me Me: hmm... ok. if you could hear anyone's thoughts, who would you pick? Kyle: keifers Kyle: cause hes a funny guy Kyle: and i bet he thinks really funny things Me: lol Me: true enough Kyle: you? Me: I think I might go with Adele, if only because I want to know if her thoughts switch from english to french as much as her speech does. ^-^ Me: of course, she would beat me up if she ever found out... Kyle: lol Session Close (Thu Jun 03 22:47:00 2004)   Again, I same close to admitting my crush. Also, I feel the need to mention that, while he was indeed dressed differently, he actually looked really good. Top hat included. I wish I could have kept it. But no. I didn't even touch the hat. Or him, actually. As seen in the next conversation.   Session Start (Sun Jun 06 20:04:14 2004) Me: you know, every time I found you, you already had a dancing partner Kyle: hahaha... how many times did you find me Kyle: all 4 times? Me: six, I think Me: four? Me: really? Kyle: yeah Me: yeah, it would have been every time, then Kyle: cause when a slow song comes on i wait like 10 seconds then if i dont have anyone to dance with i ditch and leave the gym Kyle: cause standing there without a partner isnt fun Me: ah Me: I have noticed that in the past, yes Kyle: lol Kyle: is it obvious Kyle: i try to do it subtly Me: well, it's normally because I've done the same thing Kyle: ahhh... well join the club:) Me: the only reason I didn't do it most of the time this time is because I was either looking for you or making other people dance instead. because I had courage, apparently. Kyle: lol Me: yay! I'm in another club! there seem to be alot of those... Kyle: nice Me: yeah Session Close (Sun Jun 06 20:14:29 2004)   Yes, that's right. I didn't dance with him. I know I should have. I am such an idiot sometimes. I just... didn't. I'm such an idiot.   Session Start (Sun Jun 06 20:32:29 2004) Session Close (Sun Jun 06 20:32:37 2004)   Session Start (Thu Jun 10 23:14:31 2004) Me: so where did you get your top hat? Kyle: classy's in west ed Kyle: 35$ Me: cool Me: I'll have to go check it out sometime Session Close (Thu Jun 10 23:15:13 2004)   Yes, the top hat. I must get one for myself some time. It was a nice top hat.   Session Start (Sat Jun 19 00:29:51 2004) Me: so what's this I hear about pretty in pink doing a show with ten second epic? Kyle: oh yes Kyle: july 10th Kyle: st albert community centre Kyle: but i g2g Me: okay Me: g'night Kyle: sorry, i'll talk to you later miriam Session Close (Sat Jun 19 00:31:08 2004)   I swear, when I read that he had said my name, my heart almost jumped out of body. I was so shocked. No one ever says my name(except teachers), especially on msn. Especially not him.   Session Start (Tue Jun 22 21:45:58 2004) Me: hey Kyle: hey! Me: Anything new in the land of Kyle? Kyle: not really... think i failed the math test and i cant find good enough equipment to practice with for the two big shows we have coming up Me: it's just math. Just make sure you do well on the other two, you'll be fine Me: and what two shows? Me: I know about the one with ten second epic... Kyle: then this battle of the bands on the 9th Me: oh really? Me: cool Me: who else is going to be playing at that one? Kyle: iunno Me: heheh Kyle: i havent seen anything Me: so you'll just find out when you get there, huh? Me: sounds like fun Me: what equipment are you missing, anyway? Kyle: an amp Kyle: a guitar amp Me: hmm Me: doesn't Luc have three? why don't you steal one of his? Kyle: we're using them all Kyle: we need one more Me: ah. Me: good luck with that. Me: random topic jump.... so I hear you're anti-Bush. Kyle: indeed Me: any specific reason, or just his entire career as a politician? Kyle: theres a lot of reasons Kyle: how he lead his country to war on a lie Me: mm Kyle: is a big one Kyle: and all the messyness that goes on between the bush admin. and the saudi arabian government Kyle: bush was all for overthrowing hussein... but saudi arabia isnt governed fairly either, but you never hear about it Kyle: because the saudis and bush are close Me: mm Me: I never thought of it quite that way Kyle: yeah... theres other reasons Kyle: like how he wasnt even elected by the people and he has the power to send people to their death, or to kill others Kyle: iunno, im not really thinking good so i cant really make good points Kyle: but yeah Kyle: those are some Me: mm Kyle: i dont like how he does things... but im also anti-nationalist Kyle: i think globalisms a good idea Me: indeed Kyle: its impossible Me: yes it is Me: I was about to mention that Kyle: but its the ideal situation. i'm no nationalist though. i just think of myself as a global citizen... and other nations as people... not foreigners or enemies. i think of them as human beings. for get races they're people not skin colours or nations Kyle: *forget Me: indeed. Kyle: its easier that way Me: I suppose it could be.... if you ignore all propaganda... Kyle: well if your not a nationalist and dont buy into all that patriotic crap, its easy to ignore it Kyle: i dotn eat up everything someone gives me Me: heh Session Close (Tue Jun 22 23:36:29 2004)   Yes, I heard that he was anti-Bush. From Luc. The one with the amps. Also one of his best friends. I remember that I had made a snide remark about Bush, and Luc looked at me and told me I should talk to Kyle. I almost burst into uncontrolable laughter, as did Jessica and Cassandra, who were present at the time. Ian, Luc and Kris kinda blinked at us when we looked at each other funny. And might I add that this conversation further proves how much of a great guy Kyle is. Honestly.   Session Start (Sun Jul 04 01:16:31 2004) Session Close (Sun Jul 04 01:18:35 2004)   More pathetic...   Session Start (Thu Jul 08 21:38:41 2004) Me: hey, good luck at your shows Kyle: thanks Kyle: you gonna come out to any of them? Me: I want to Me: but I can't find anyone to keep me company Me: and I'll be in Vancouver for the last one Session Close (Thu Jul 08 21:46:19 2004)   Session Start (Thu Jul 08 22:18:10 2004) Session Close (Thu Jul 08 22:18:20 2004)   Session Start (Thu Jul 08 22:18:21 2004) Me: where's the show going to be on Saturday? Kyle: st.albert community hall Kyle: on peron Kyle: with TSE and ender Kyle: and a bunch of other good hardcore and metalcore bands Me: nice Me: how much are tickets? Kyle: 8 Me: 'kay Me: thanks Me: I might show up to that one Kyle: wesome:) Kyle: *awesome Me: yup. ^-^ Session Close (Thu Jul 08 22:33:36 2004)   And nice too. It would be easier to give up on him if he had been unpolite at some point. But no.   Session Start (Sat Jul 10 00:31:28 2004) Session Close (Sat Jul 10 00:31:33 2004)   Session Start (Sat Jul 10 00:49:10 2004) Me: how was your show? Kyle: it got cancelled(N) Me: oh, really? Me: that's depressing Me: why? Kyle: yeah Kyle: cause it was outside Me: oh Kyle: and they had all those warningd Kyle: *warnings Me: mm. well, the weather hasn't exactly been sunny all week, so... Me: oh! you never mentioned when tomorrow's show is... Kyle: doors at 6 show at 7 Me: okay Me: I'm assuming there'll be tickets at the door? because otherwise, I'm gonna be wandering around with nothing to do... Kyle: yeah Me: except maybe go to the library... heh. I'm such a nerd. ^-^ Me: anywho. how's your summer been so far? Kyle: not good Kyle: summer school(N) Me: no? Me: ah Me: which subject? Kyle: math 10 prep Me: mm. how much homework? Kyle: so much!!! Me: mm. need help? I might not be able to, because I don't know what the material is, but explaining it might help you... Kyle: nah, it susually pretty easy Kyle: just super long Me: mm. Me: well, you do have ten months' worth of material to cover in three weeks... Me: or five months, I guess, as it would be a half-year class, right? Me: sorry, rambling again. Me: can you give me something to draw? even if it's just some random thing off the top of your head? I'm really drawing a blank, but I need do something... Session Close (Sat Jul 10 01:07:35 2004)   Yep. This is the show mentioned much earlier, that got cancelled. Also, mention of summer school. The only mention of it, might I add. Also, the ever-repeated question of a request. Because I honestly wanted to draw something for him, even if he never got it. But no.   Session Start (Sun Jul 11 01:36:27 2004) Me: did you have fun at the show? Session Close (Sun Jul 11 01:38:24 2004)   Session Start (Sun Jul 11 02:20:47 2004) Me: hey Kyle: hey Me: did you have fun at the show? Session Close (Sun Jul 11 02:27:08 2004)   I never did find out if he had fun at the show...   Session Start (Sun Aug 08 16:49:33 2004) Kyle: who is this? Me: Miriam Me: still Kyle: oh right Kyle: i forgot Me: heh Me: that's okay Me: so how's your summer been so far? Session Close (Sun Aug 08 16:55:19 2004)   A month later. And he didn't remember me.   -----  That's it. That's all of the Kyle File to date.  And probably all there will be for a while. He finally came on today, for the first time since that last conversation, but I didn't talk to him. I'm such an idiot. Maybe I should have told him about it anyway.  But I found him on Nexus, which took a while since he changed his username. But I sent him a message, about general stuff. I don't think he plans on replying, either.  Idiot.

      I couldn't cry.  I was in bed last night, listening to Hear You Me, by Jimmy Eat World. Now, it's already a depressing song, as it's about losing someone you love. But that wasn't what I was thinking about.  I was thinking about grade nine, and all the people I'm going to miss. Specifically Kyle Mathe.  I've had a crush on him since Christmas, even if I didn't realize it until the beginning of February. When was the first time I realized it? Hm. Not sure. I think it was the time in science class when he was muttering The Good Fight, by Dashboard Confessional. I turned around to ask him if he actually knew the words, and he just looekd at me before asking the same. I replied that no, I only knew what it sounded like, and mentionned that I tend to hear the word fire(which is not actually in there, I'm just weird).  I have plenty of other memories accumuated throughout the half-year that followed. It would take too long to list them, though. I can try anyway. I feel the need to rid myself of them. Or at least, I hope that's what will happen.  The gobstoppers, and science classes feeling entirely too self-conscious.  Occasional conversations about music, particularily emo.  Sitting behind him in French, drawing the back of his hoodie(Dead Kennedys). Being jealous of Carly for always having his attention. Being jealous of Abbey for being one of his closest friends. Many a conversation on MSN, most of which began and ended without a word. Wishing I had the guts to talk to him, even on MSN. Valentine's Day dance, wishing I had the guts to ask him to dance. Sitting in the front of science, looking at the opposite corner to see him curliing his hair around his hat, even while wearing his hood up. Air bands... Gym class, me always wondering where he was, him always showing up ten minutes late. Gym class, him going up against Marc Majeau as the final high jumpers in our class. He lost, despite having stopped holding his shirt down as he ran(Dunno why he did it in the first place. Carly and Jen told him to stop, so he did.). Many a lunch staring at him in the hallway, with his friends all around him as he got stuff from his locker, and me sitting around with my hallway friends. Looking for him in the morning as I walked into the school, and my heart jumping into my throat every time he was there, and being letdown every time he wasn't. The Pretty in Pink/ Ender/ Blazing Violets show. Heh. That was a good night. The Ender/ Ten Second Epic show at Red's, even if I didn't actually see him there(I saw Quenton though. That was weird.). Also the conversations that came before and after it. The hour and a half long conversation on msn(to be posted later), in which much bitching was done on my part and consoling on his. I am such a bitch around him sometimes. I hate myself for it, too. The french class when we decided who would do the toast to friends, where he was actually silent, for once. Heh. (It was actually Kevin and me that did it in the end.). The french class in which I became an open hypocrite, because I mentioned that I liked Dare You To Move, by Switchfoot, and he countered that he liked Meant To Live, by the same, better. I then turned to Carrie and said that yes, I preferred Meant To Live as well, but realized that I was becoming a hypocrite, and added that I wasn't sure how Dare You To Move went, as I had not heard it in a while, and Carrie sang a bit, and I said that yes, I liked that one too. The night before grad, when I asked him to save me a song. The grad celebration. The dance after the celebration, in which I danced with quite a few boys, and whenever I did try to find Kyle, he was either not there(as I found later), or had another partner already. He was popular, after all. The month that followed, containing me wishing I could tell him I liked him, him probably not being oblivious but acting it, as I am always blatantly obvious when I like someone, whether I want to be or not. The second last day of school, where I had my yearbook(grade eight's, because our school is stupid) with me, specifically so I could get him to sign it. It took me until the last moments of our life in that school before the exams, after all the desks in Mme Larose's room had been moved to the gym and most of the class was already gone. I asked him if he could sign it, he said sure, and mentioned that he should do it because I was going to "the school for people who are not smart and can't do math and stuff..." and then he turned around to sign it, probably because I looked a bit hurt. And if I didn't, it's only because of some sort of self-control I didn't know I possessed. I had hear that I'm going to "that school" or the "smart people school" or whatever else they came up with since May, which is when it became widely known. The thought still almost makes me cry. It's not like I want to leave them all... Seeing him and a bunch of other people in the mall, and not eating the rest of my hamburger until they went away(they took their sweet time, too.). The Pretty in Pink/ Ender/ Ten Second Epic show in the community hall. Him sitting on the other side of Adam while TSE played, singing along as if he were alone in the room. Heh. The most recent conversation, about who I am. He had forgotten again.  Yeah. That's not even all of them. Those are just the ones I remember right now.  I'm going to miss ESSMY. Why did I do this to myself?
