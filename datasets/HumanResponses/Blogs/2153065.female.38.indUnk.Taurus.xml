             Author:  Martin Clark  Genre:  Fiction/Mystery/Humor   Review:  I'm utterly blown away by the wit and creativity of Clark as showcased in this book.  While it is a long read, 345 unapologetic action-filled pages, I started it last night at around ten and finished it this morning at ten.  It was so enthralling that I refused to go to sleep until I'd finished it.  { Warning: no real criticism or analysis follows as this is a book I WANT you to read.  No synopsis for you, bub .}  Clark casts a brave band of f.u.b.a.r'd misfits (a judge, his brother--the philosophist [translation: poor asshole living in a trailer], a doctor, and the happily-married friend) as the adventure-goers (though they smoke so much weed it makes me wonder now if any of the plot actually happened or if the characters were merely hallucinating).  Our brave band of merry men find themselves everywhere from just across the Virginia border for lotto tickets, Charleston, West Virginia, Climax, North Carolina (yes, a real place) and Salt Lake City, where the plot thickens (trite description, I know--shush it).  The characters were well-developed, the dialogue didn't drag on until the cows came home, and Clark didn't try to interfuse some moralistic theme into the works (As of late the convention of teaching lessons in novels really pisses me off--just tell a story and move on.  If I wanted salvationist reading I'd go to Wal-Mart and buy  Left Behind ).  What I really enjoyed about the book is that the protagonist Evers actually gets revenge on his tramp skank skeezer (excuse my French) of a wife in the end--I appreciated that Clark gave the reader the satisfaction of that rather than including some absurd plot twist just for the sake of innovation.   How  he inevitably gets his revenge encompasses the back half of the book (which explains why I didn't make it to bed).  I kept trying to guess what was going to happen, which is typically disgustingly easy in most books, and found myself surprised each time.  I must admit that the humor is tongue-in-cheek: if you don't understand sarcasm, you'll hate this book (because you won't get it).  I must further admit that while the book was written by a judge, don't expect anything in it to be clean.  In fact, it was downright vulgar and I LOVED IT!  Religious zealots beware.   Verdict:     This is the sort of writer I aspire to be: at no point did I secondguess the quality of the book.  The story was solid from beginning to end--the man is sharp as a tack.  Go pick it up in paperback as a summer beach read.

              Author:  Melanie Sumner  Genre:  Mainstream Fiction   Review:   "Never judge a book by its cover," the old adage goes.  I did, and I'm sorry.   The School of Beauty and Charm  was an impulse grab at the library.  I didn't read much of the jacket synopsis, other than to know it was by a Southern woman writer (my academic concentration).  I added it to my pile, regardless of the odd cover art which at first created in me some doubt as of the competence of the book.  This book may be the most well-written and thoughtful works I've engaged in to date.  The writing was clean and cohesive with little waste.  While there was nothing excessive about Sumner's descriptive passages, I came away feeling like I had somehow heard of the characters before--as if they were living in my town and I'd heard gossip about them through the grapevine on occasion.  Sumners has a gifted ear and is obviously a seasoned studier of people.  She spins dialect idiosyncrasies and social norms into the make-up of the characters so well as to be describing people she knows in life.   The School of Beauty and Charm  tells the story of the Peppers family: "new money" in the Counterpoint, Georgia social scene (they are, in fact, po' white trash ascended to semi-prominence).  It is the coming-to-age saga of the protagonist Louise is a delightful, down-to-earth, troubled (read: normal) teenager who rebels by going through such interesting phases as "redneck tart," "bohemian," and "carnie."  She hates her parents.  She loves her parents.  Her mother is a Christian (a Southern  Baptist  Christian--uh oh!).  Her father is a sheep whom follows the nagging shepherding of his wife.  There's so much to be understood in the text that I could read it again and again and each time come away with a different explication of why something occurred in such a way: the stuff good "literature" is made of.  The many twists in plot are so unexpected that at times, I sat agape wondering, "How'd she think to do that?  Bravo!"  Inevitably the book is a discussion of whom Louise chooses to love and where she finds them.  My favorite happened to be the fire-eating Zane whom himself is so sexually repressed that his final action in story floored me.  I'll admit that I didn't get the title until I got to the very end of the book, and I'll leave it to your discretion to determine whether you'll want to learn for yourself what the school actually is.   Verdict:     Top honors: it takes a while to get into the meat of the plot, but is absolutely worth reading.

             Author:  Clyde Edgerton  Genre:  Mainstream Fiction   Review:   Those whom have read  urlLink my blog , and more recently this location, have understood that my relationship with Edgerton's books is usually hit or miss.  I keep going back and reading more of them because a) I have a fierce loyalty to North Carolina writers, and b) I really enjoyed his   Walking Across Egypt   and   Killer Diller  .  That said, I must confess that I really disliked  In Memory of Junior .  ["Hate" is such a strong word and I shall reserve it for a book that really makes me grind my teeth in disgust.]  This, as well as other Edgerton books, are marked as being humorous.  I found nothing to laugh at in this work.  While  Lunch at the Piccadilly  was lighthearted in its handling of old age and the inevitability of death, I found  Junior  almost tacky.  I didn't bond with any of the characters,so I won't bother picking them out here.  They all seemed ridiculously shallow and so poorly expounded upon that they seemed to be almost afterthoughts in the writing process.  For once, this Edgerton title has a conclusive ending, however by the time I got to it, I really didn't give two shits (excuse my French).  The humor in this book is almost sterile compared to the gut-busting bawdiness of  Egypt  and  Killer Diller .  I miss that.   Verdict:     If and when Edgerton publishes another book, I'll be the first at the library to check it out.  I'm uncertain whether I'll read his remaining titles I haven't tried, especially  The Floatplane Notebooks  as it again deals with death.  I'm not prepared to bore myself in this manner again.  I will probably engage  Where Trouble Sleeps  on my next trip to the library, though.  Good authorship is unpredictable but Edgerton has to be bound to have a comeback soon.

       Author(s):  Sophie Kinsella   Genre:  Women's Fiction     Review:  I like reading Sophie Kinsella’s books because they are a lot of fun.   Can You Keep a Secret?  is no exception.  Emma Corrigan is a 20-something marketing assistant who has worked at the Panther Corporation for nearly a year.  She anticipates earning a promotion when her boss allows her to represent the company on a business trip to Glasgow.    Unfortunately, the meeting doesn’t go well and as Emma frets about her career on the return flight to London, the plane encounters turbulence so violent she becomes convinced she (and all the other passengers) are about to die in a crash.    Her tongue loosened with a few too many drinks and the fear of her ultimate demise, Emma clutches the hand of her seatmate – a handsome American – and begins spouting her many secrets.  Secrets running the gamut from trivial (the g-string underwear her boyfriend gave her is too small but she wears it anyway) to more damaging (She lied on her resume; she has doubts about her relationship with her boyfriend, who resembles a Ken doll) and many more.    Many, many more .  But the plane lands safely and Emma bids farewell to the stranger who bore witness to her confessions.  Later, she’s horrified to learn the man on the plane – who knows things even her best friend doesn’t know – is Jack Harper, owner of the Panther Corporation.  Some of the funniest moments in this book are when Jack uses his knowledge of Emma’s secrets to tease her in front of oblivious coworkers, friends and family.  Ms. Kinsella has a light, comedic touch and I constantly giggled at Emma’s escapades.   For example, when Emma anticipates a romantic tryst with Jack, she worries she’s less experienced in the bedroom than he is.  She reassures herself by comparing sex to ballet, quoting her ballet teacher’s instructions to keep the toes pointed out and always wear a smile.  While the author provides a good characterization of Emma, she’s very similar to Becky Bloomwood of the Shopaholic books.  This is not necessarily a bad thing because both Becky and Emma are very likable, awkwardly funny characters.  The secondary players are characterized in a satisfactory fashion, but I always find myself wishing the heroes were more fleshed out.  Jack Harper is handsome and has a wry sense of humor – which is great for scenes showing the initial attraction between him and Emma – but I don’t really get a complete sense of who he is.  The book is a bit longer than necessary and if the author had weeded out some of the secrets (I think Emma really gets carried away on that fateful confessionary flight) and some of the histrionics toward the end, the story would be a perfect light-hearted read.    Verdict:    I’m a Sophie Kinsella fan and I love romantic comedies that are  actually funny .   Can You Keep a Secret?  is one of the more successful books in the genre and I recommend it.

             Author: Neil Gaiman   Genre: Fiction, Fantasy     Deposition:    I, like so many other Gaiman fans, first fell under the spell of his intricate storytelling via his  urlLink Sandman  comic series.  His writing has only grown and matured as he has moved into the world of the novel--one of his earliest coauthored by another of my all-time favorites, Terry Pratchett.  I'm not one of Neil Gaiman's legion of slavering fangirls, though--his novels in particular have been hit or miss with me.  I have felt that his writing, while so intimate when wed to stunning artwork, can be a little cold and detached when applied to characters we cannot see.  That, however, was before I read American Gods, a work I find superior to every other novel he has written to date.   If I reveal very much of the plot here, some important revelations will be ruined for the interested reader, and I wish to preserve the effect of this riveting tale.  That said, here's the bare bones version... a man named Shadow finds out that his wife and his best friend have been killed in a car accident just as he is released from prison after three long years.  Said friend was also slated to employ him, so Shadow's entire life is upturned, he has nothing to go home to anymore.  On the flight home for his wife's funeral, he is approached by an enigmatic gentleman who calls himself Mr. Wednesday and seems to know far more about Shadow than a perfect stranger should.  Mr. Wednesday offers Shadow a job, and we soon discover that there is much, much more to Mr. Wednesday and his associates than meets the eye.   I know.  I sound like the back cover of the paperback version--I haven't told you much that said summary doesn't reveal.  In more general, less plot-spoiling terms, however, this is a story about gods brought to America from immigrant believers, bereft here when their believers dwindle, left to make their own way.  But America created its own gods along the way, as well, deities of a new age, a technological age--and, well, any reader of mythology will be able to tell you that gods are just not any good at sharing.   This novel offers something that has seemed hard for Gaiman to come by with his novels--a deeply sympathetic main character, as well as a whole host of others that actually inspire feeling in the reader.  That is precisely what I think he's been lacking, and American Gods is far from detached or cold.  Its primary fault, however, lies in what it expects in a reader.  Read much mythology?  Have a fairly good grounding in comparative religion?  If you can answer yes, you'll get much more out of this book than the reader who must answer no.  In fact, without a little independent research, anyone unfamiliar with the deities of various world mythologies and faiths will miss quite a lot, fail to comprehend a good many references.  (There are one or two self-referential moments, too, just for Sandman fans.)   Overall, I loved this book, quite truly.  It moved me... portions of it still honestly haunt me a bit.  And I realize the significance of this will be lost on anyone who hasn't read it (there's more incentive for you), but I will never look at a roadside attraction quite the same way ever again.  Verdict:

             Author:  Pamela Duncan  Genre:  Fiction/Women's Lit.   Review:   I chose  Plant Life  to read after doing an Amazon search for books set in North Carolina.  This one specifically deals with the "plant life" in the west-mid-western area of the state where old textile mills are slowly becoming extinct.  While the theme is concerned with the strength of a woman's spirit, it is not exclusively  for  women.  It is by no means a fairy tale, though the ending van be considered pleasant.  The storyline focuses on a recent divorcee named Laurel whom escapes her life in the city and returns to Russell--just long enough to figure out what she wanted to do, supposedly.  Anything would be better than running into your ex-husband (three weeks gone and already re-married) in the grocery store every Thursday.  Laurel is far from the stereotypical character in women's lit that looks to take revenge out on mankind for screwing her over or dumping her.  However, her indecisiveness and tentative reactions made her less than fully likeable for me.  I did appreciate her strength in handling rejection by suitor Joe and found her outburst with her ex-husband's new wife Deedee in the store to be quite realistic (I felt embarrassed for her).  Those moments of embarrassment made her seem like a true woman: imperfect.  I found Duncan's secondary character asides to be mostly dull and lacking any information necessary to supplement a vigorous plot.  Though well-intentioned, these reminiscences spun the older generation of woman characters do little to help the reader get into the heads of them.  The secondary characters, particularly Maxann, were conceived well enough to not need the additional background provided in the memory asides.  Duncan's gentle capture of local dialect proves that her ear is well-honed to the sounds around her.  I could hear Maxann drawling, Idalene chastising, and Pansy speaking as if they were in the room with me.  I enjoyed the small details that Duncan obviously planned long and hard.  The Lurch-like attendant in the rest home that thinks he still works in a funeral parlor and becomes frightened each time a patient moves is so creative as to have to be a real event in Duncan's life.  Although it seems that Duncan avoided anything too "dirty" or controversial (i.e. sex) to the point of being painfully obvious, it was nice to read a book where I couldn't predict that ending (for instance: the reaction of one character who gets shot in the stomach by her drunken husband).  There were a few "broken links" in the story that while made me think "You go girl!" at the time, made my mind race at the end.  "Well, what happened?"   Verdict:     Mostly, I enjoyed  Plant Life .  At times it was tough to wade through all the flashbacks.  I would have enjoyed it more 100 pages shorter and perhaps with an epilogue that seemed less a jagged edge: this one was sort of "Thelma & Louise" for my cut-and-dry taste.  It puts a period where a comma should be, though you can't help but to smile to wonder the characters' futures.

             Author(s):  Clyde Edgerton  Genre:  Mainstream Fiction/Humor    Deposition:    So again we find ourselves in (imaginary) Listre, North Carolina where a new cache of characters keep popping up in Edgerton's world.  In this (his most recent) novel, Edgerton in about 250 pages expresses the humor residing in having the audacity to be relieved that an elderly family member has passed on.  Carl's Aunt Lil must stop driving--she runs red lights, is overcome with brief spells of aphasia ("Which one is  he ?" she wonders at her nephew), and can't really see over the dashboard.  However, since the government saw fit to give her a license and hadn't taken it away yet, she would keep driving until they did.  Fortunately for Carl she passes before he can put his foot down.  Is that what we all fear?  Having to be the one to snatches away what independence the elderly have left?  Although making a point was unlikely to be the purpose of this book, Edgerton softly compares which way is better to go: falling from the toilet pulling a call cord for help, or in a car with old friends running red lights--laughing.  The crop of secondary characters tend to outshine the primaries in Edgerton books and this one is no different.  I found the eloquent, yet grating, Reverend L. Ray to be an absolutely brilliant addition to the storyline.  He reminded me of a ill-conceived cross between Al Sharpton, Jesse Jackson, and...well, Colonel Sanders:  " O God in us all, may we embrace the rooms of refuge food.  Real food, cheap food, food served by people with wet rags under their arms.  I eat; I cheat.  I forge; I gorge.  I taste; I waste.  Waffle House, Huddle House, Puddle House, Muddle House... " he begins his blessing.  The cursing one-eyed Beatrice, little Maudie, and Clara that spend their time on the front porch of the "convalescent" home with Lil evoked for me memories of Huck Finn and Mark Twain.  How they yearned for adventure and ended up finding it when they least expected it!  I found the theme to be soothing rather than morbid: relief comes from death.  Edgerton did a good job of finding humor in old age and seemingly in the process comes to terms with his own aging.  Verdict:     I liked it--it was a good quick read.  I believe it to be yet another Edgerton book that would be better viewed onscreen rather than in absorbed through print.

       Author(s):  Agnes Selby  Genre:  Biography    Deposition:  Constanze Weber Mozart is a woman who has been much maligned in the past as a featherbrained spendthrift at best and a murderous slattern at worst. This book attempts to find middle ground, but ends up portraying Constanze as a woman who martyrs herself to her husband's legacy at the expense of her children, her second husband and, ultimately, herself. Besides being a dry read, it is also not very well researched. The author’s first mistake is believing that people are interested enough in Mozart’s wife to shell out $30.00 on a scant 238 pages. Her second is trying to build a case on very few recorded and reliable facts.  A lay person will probably not notice many of the inaccuracies and contradictions in this book, but they will tire of the repeated bits of information employed by the author as padding. Too, even a nominal fan of Mozart's music knows there is no Donna Laura role in the opera, Don Giovanni (one assumes the author meant Donna Anna), while those who take this composer more seriously know that it was at a rehearsal of the C minor Mass (not Idomeneo, an opera) in Salzburg, where Mozart broke down in tears and fled the company, which included his wife. The C minor Mass was produced in Salzburg in October of 1783 while Wolfgang and Constanze, who had been married for one year, visited Leopold Mozart. Idomeneo was produced in Munich in January of 1781, four months before the couple even began their courtship. These are not small details and one would expect a self-proclaimed authority to be more conscientious. A month or two after this book went to print the author wrote me a defensive email after visiting a Mozart website I maintained at that time. On it I had given the names and birth/death days of the five Weber siblings, which included a brother, Johann. Selby wanted to know where I had obtained that information -- she had never heard there was a brother -- and I was only too happy to tell her that it was easily found in one of the most respected books on Mozart ( Mozart & His Circle, Peter Clive, Yale University Press, 1993 ). There is nothing worse than lazy research, especially when the author claims to have spent ten years painstakingly collecting it.  The author cannot seem to come to an agreement with herself on the financial state of the Weber family, either. On one page she describes the family as living in "abject poverty" while on another this is changed to "near poverty". On still another page the Webers are wining and dining the famous Mozart in their home for weeks on end. Moreover, I would like to ask, if Fridolin Weber was so poor that he was by necessity the sole music instructor of his daughters -- the stellar Aloysia, the spectacular Josefa (who later debuted the role of The Queen of the Night in The Magic Flute), and Constanze, who "had often been the first to sing Mozart's arias so that he could, with her help, judge their effect", why did he not take up a career as a voice teacher rather than a lowly, underpaid theatre prompter and music copyist? It is documented that Aloysia was trained by Theobald Marchand. And while both Aloysia Weber and Karl Thomas Mozart (Constanze's eldest son) are deemed as bread-winning adults at the age of sixteen, Selby calls Constanze at that age a "little girl" and refers to that time of her life as her "childhood" thus justifying her subject's convenient memory lapses during interviews she gave while living in Salzburg after the death of her second husband.  Constanze is called in one moment a "soothing influence" who provided "peace and tranquility" for her gifted husband, to be described in the next moment as a woman who "enjoyed a good fight". She is depicted as a widow living in Dickensian poverty the year following Mozart's death, but the author's own information shows, with a little simple adding, that during that year alone Widow Mozart received well over four times her husband's annual salary and had many of her husband's debts paid by charitable individuals and organizations. In addition, the pages fairly hum with phrases such as "may have", "must have", "might have", and "it is reasonable to assume" when the author would press us to see her subject as she does. Frankly, if Selby were an attorney she would lose her client’s case due to conjecture, hearsay and lack of evidence.  This book attempts to show Constanze as a muse, a virtual Sheherezade to two husbands, but what it succeeds in revealing is a woman who is levelheaded, shrewd, ambitious and dismayed by her extraordinary husband's erratic lifestyle and behavior, but unable to do much about it. It also reveals a Constanze Mozart who is mercenary, materialistic, dour, controlling and pretentious, and who played favorites with her sons, putting her eldest as far away from her as possible both geographically and emotionally, and probably would rather have not been bothered by the youngest until he grew up and could be of some help to his twice-widowed mother and of use to her "selfless" crusade.  I am sure that those like Selby, who prefer to think of Constanze Mozart as a tragic Madonna and a martyred wife of a beloved genius will read this book and gloss over its inconsistencies. Others, however, with no holy icon to bear up, will see her as a woman struggling against the patriarchal system at any cost, which devotion in the end reveals her to be all too human, left alone with only her memories and the faithful who pilgrimage to the shrine she created to her husband. And although it was not the author’s desire, this book makes it all too clear that Constanze Mozart merely completed her detested father-in-law’s earlier managerial scheme, that is, to leave the future a scrubbed and sanitized image of a genius who was, after all, a man of his times.    Verdict:

             Author(s):  Gloria Naylor  Genre:  Fiction; Af-Am Literature    Deposition:  I typically determine which books I should bother to read by considering the ones I've read before.  I had read Gloria Naylor's  Mama Day  and thought it to be a wonderful book: powerful in its mysticism and a wonderful warning about the behaviors of humankind.  I was less impressed with this work.  The main characters, Bailey and his wife Nadine, are underdeveloped and less than fully likeable.  The short sketches of backstory provided to give the reader insight are...well...boring, to put it mildly.  The plot is constructed by assigning secondary characters their own chapters and letting them tell the story of how they arrived at the "magical" cafe.  There is no beginning, middle, or end so the reader comes away feeling like they've been preached at by a reverend who doesn't recount a parable well enough to make a point.  The one device that moved me in the work was the Ethiopian Jewess whom was added to disrupt the flow of activity in and around the cafe.  She arrives late in the work and inevitably proved to be all that I cared about.  As a walking contradiction she made me think, but given the context of the surrounding novel, I was unsure of what I should be thinking  about .    Verdict:     Naylor was trying to make a point.  As open as I was to receiving it, it never reached me.

       Author(s):  Lynda Curnyn   Genre:  Women's Fiction     Deposition:  If you’ve read Lynda Curnyn’s  urlLink Engaging Men , you’ve already met Grace Noonan, the heroine of Bombshell.  Grace was one of Angie DiFranco’s confidantes, confined to the outer fringes of Engaging Men.  In Bombshell, Ms. Curnyn tells us Grace’s story.  After her boyfriend Ethan reacts selfishly to a condom “mishap”, Grace gives him the boot and focuses on her career as a marketing professional at a cosmetics firm called Roxanne Dubrow (think Estee Lauder.)  Her thoughts also focus on her birth-mother, who has not responded to the letter Grace sent to her months ago.  Grace is lonely and bitter and the story follows her dating foibles, her job stresses and the angst of feeling unloved.  I did not enjoy this as much as Engaging Men.  Grace is simply not very likable.  She’s entirely too serious.  She’s humorless and keeps to herself – refusing to confide in friends and loved ones.  It’s no wonder she’s lonely.  Because Grace constantly rejects those around her and makes little effort to help herself, I found it difficult to care what happened to her.  There’s lack of characterization of all secondary characters – they become so much background scenery as Grace stews internally about her woes.  Later in the story, Grace meets Jonathan Somerfield at an art auction.  Since this was at a critical point in Grace’s story, it was vital that Jonathan be a strong, memorable character.  He was so passive, wimpy and unsuitable for Grace’s personality, there was absolutely no chemistry.  Which leads me to the narrative.  The story is told in first-person point-of-view – a format I typically enjoy.  But Grace internalizes so much, her thoughts became such a depressing burden, I had to resist the urge to skip ahead to scenes containing dialogue.  There are a couple of redundant, gratuitous sex scenes and numerous shopping scenes that had me rolling my eyes and yawning.  Grace Noonan’s story just isn’t interesting or engaging enough to carry an entire novel.    Verdict:

       Author(s):  Mary Robison   Genre:  Mainstream Fiction     Deposition:  Through a series of stream-of-consciousness ramblings and brief dialogues, we become acquainted enough with Money Breton to know she’s got troubles.   Lots of them.  Thrice-divorced Money is a script doctor who has been fired by previous movie studios and clings disinterestedly to her current project.  Her daughter, Mev, is going through methadone treatment.  Her bored friend Hollis hangs out at her house, offering pithy nuggets of useless trivia.  Boyfriend Dix is clingy to the point of stalking.  Her cat has run away.  And throughout the story, Money occasionally (and reluctantly) references a horrific event her son Paulie recently endured.    Ms. Robison’s writing style is like nothing I’ve encountered before.  Although the story is segmented into chapters, there is no traditional flow of plot.  Each chapter consists of brief paragraphs – sometimes as short as a single phrase – or bits of dialogue.  Through these snips of thought and interaction, we do get a good characterization of the narrator.  She’s troubled, neurotic, and full of anxiety.  She’s lonely.  She loves.  She’s lost.  Somehow, this skeletal-style of writing manages to tell a story.  It’s a jerkily-paced story that will turn off readers who prefer conventional novel formatting.  While this style provides excellent characterization of Money, the secondary characters lack definition.   Because of the sparseness of text, the book is a quick read.  And while there are plenty of conflicts, not all are resolved.  There is no real plot or resolution.  This story is simply a slice of Money Breton’s troubled life, exposed for the reader.  I liked the book and the writing style.  The story felt real to me.  If you’re open to a different story format, check it out.    Verdict:

             Author(s): Clyde Edgerton   Genre: Mainstream Fiction     Deposition:  After reading two Edgerton duds ( Raney  and  Redeye ) it was a pleasant surprise to find that his first novel attempt was a gem.  Because I'm a complete and total idiot I read this book and its sequel in reverse order.  However, I found that my blunder didn't spoil the plot in the slightest bit.  The two plots were completely individual--you needn't read one to understand the other.   Egypt  tells a story of an old woman named Mattie who's "slowing down."  At 78 she fears she's getting careless and senile, however has too much pride to give up the lifestyle she's become accustomed to: watching her soaps at 1 PM everyday and making sure no one knows it.  She won't even keep a dog because she's so set in her routines that she fears she won't have time to mind it.  You know the sort: those Southern women whom would tell strangers fixing their shutters or delivering their mail what time they should stop by on a given day so that they can have a hot slice of pie waiting for them when they come by.  Those strangers will inevitably show up, too (wearing a bib and carrying a paper plate and piece of tin foil to take some home with them).  Mattie reminded me so much of my ever-servicing grandmother that I had to cringe.  The monkey-wrench that gets thrown into the works is Wesley: a juvenile delinquent who oddly enough is willing to change his heathen ways in exchange for a piece of "the best pound cake ever" and the ability to take a hot bath.  This blend of sinner and saint in novels is nothing innovative, but the extent to which Edgerton stretches it out it seems to be almost hyperbole.  (I can assure you from my own experiences that it's not!)  I loved this book.  There's so much of the North Carolina I know in it that it makes me giddy.    Verdict:        If it's at your library, check it and the sequel  Killer Diller  out.

      As an avid reader, I'm often suspicious of the reviews I find listed for books at retailers like Barnes and Noble or Amazon.  What incentive do these people have to praise every single book that gets uploaded into the system?  Surely there has to be  some  if they fail to ever criticize  anything .  I don't fall into the trap that most reviews attempt to lure us into.  I'd rather read for myself and form my own opinions.  That said, the purpose of this weblog will be to get a variety of opinions on different types of books: fact  or  fiction.  At times my fellow judges and I may even read the same book simultaneously--it should be interesting to see what happens if we do.  Consider this site in its infancy, over time our archives will build up and we'll have a veritable cornucopia of reviews for you to peruse.  Right now, we'll play catch-up and post what we can when we can.  We're all adults here.  If the occasional f-bomb gets dropped, you've been forewarned.  We're judges: not saints.

              Author:  Ann B. Ross  Genre:  Fiction/Southern Women   Review:   Although the Miss Julia series has been around since 1999, I've only recently learned of them in the past year.  In choosing between a Ross and a Lois Battle title (I had already read at least one Battle book and knew it would be a good pick) at a local bookstore, I opted to purchase the Battle.  I came across the Miss Julia series again when doing a search on Amazon.com.  It was recommended as one of those "If you like...then you'll enjoy..." books.  So, I decided to try one.  I looked for them at my library and discovered that the first book in the series was checked out.  I didn't want to hop into a later book without knowing what started it all.  The next trip to the library was no more fruitful:  all  of the Miss Julia books were checked out, and I learned with some snooping, by the same person.  I finally got a hold of "Miss Julia Speaks Her Mind" and read it in the span of about four hours this morning.  The spunky, colorful characters reminded me a bit of the local flavor in Fannie Flagg titles.    My love of Southern (American) women writers' fiction was steadily built up by the anticipation of reading this title and the other books in the series.  From chapter one on I discovered I would not be let down.  Ross has a keen ear for conversation and captures movement and the spirit of personality quite well.  Miss Julia, a widower living on inheritance, has a monkey wrench thrown into the normalcy of her life.  The disruption of her double-crossing hypocritical husband's mistress stopping by her front door and dropping of her illegitimate son as Julia's cross to bear makes for one very interesting plot when taken into account with scheming Presbyterian pastors and a psychologist whom claims that Miss Julia has not only been ravaged by senility...but, nympho- man -ia.  I loved this story.  Although at first I thought, "Oh no!  Not another one of those stories where bad things happen to good people!"  Then I realized that I can think of very few stories that  aren't  like that.  Although my heart broke when I considered what Julia had to endure, and suppressed the desire to flip to the end to make sure everything would be fine.  I read on and was satisfied with the events that occurred and the tangibility of them all.   Verdict:     I can't wait to stalk the library for the next book in the series.

       Author: John Updike   Genre: Mainstream Fiction     Review:  You have to work hard to forget Jack Nicholson from that movie, but you must. You must! The book isn't better or worse, just different.  I like the way John Updike writes, but I do acknowledge I need patience sometimes. For the first 30 pages we're getting to know the three witches and the town of Eastwick without anything actually happening. Then on page 34, Van Horne enters and it gets fun. From there forward, the ride is great. Van Horne is an opinionated blowhard, his mansion has character, the small-town gossip is juicy, and there's lots of sex. Sex, sex, sex. Everyone's having affairs with everyone else. Jane, Sukie, and Alexandra have sex with Van Horne, as well as with a handful of Eastwick husbands. There's a murder, a suicide, deception, a hot tub, cello music, pastries, the beach, snow, alcohol, and dogs. I just love dogs.  I love the way Alexandra, Sukie, and Jane undergo their dramas and leave their children to fend for themselves (we know they have children, but when they're mentioned, it's made clear that they're a nuisance). It reminded me of my own parents when I was a very young child.  Details make this novel, but here's where patience comes in. When Jane plays the cello, we get pages and pages about the pieces, about Bach and sixteenth and thirty-second notes and different movements and the calluses on Janes fingers and how the music made her *feel*. On the other hand, we're told in passing that after a night with Van Horne, both ends of Alexandra's perineum ached. That's all we get. Come on man, let loose! Tell us what happened! If you can describe the cello, surely you can describe how Alexandra got her ache (yes, yes, I know, but I wanted to be there to *watch*, dammit).  A good book. I liked it.   Verdict:

       Author(s):  Jodi Picoult   Genre:  Mainstream Fiction     Review:  When Sara and Brian Fitzgerald’s youngest child, Kate, develops leukemia and their oldest child isn’t a match to provide life saving transfusions and marrow, the couple gives birth to another baby.  The new child, Anna, has been pre-designed with genetic traits to match her sister Kate’s.   Originally, Sara and Brian plan only to use the stem cells in Anna’s umbilical cord.  But as the years pass and Kate repeatedly relapses, more fluid, cells, blood, platelets and grafts are taken from young Anna.  By the time Anna is 13, 16-year-old Kate’s kidneys begin to fail.  Sara begins making plans for Anna to donate a kidney, but before this can happen, Anna visits attorney Campbell Alexander – a lawyer who has defended minors in previous cases.   She wants to sue her parents for medical emancipation.  He takes her case pro-bono.  As the case goes through court proceedings, Kate’s body begins shutting down and she’s hospitalized.  The story premise intrigued me because although still controversial, it’s not unheard of and has become quite common for children to be pre-designed in the embryonic stage to fit certain genetic qualifications the parents desire.  And having one baby to save another has happened before.  And what about those genetically engineered children, forced to donate parts of themself to save a sibling?  Are they loved less?  Is their own health put at greater risk?  Are they ever given the  choice  to donate?    Ms. Picoult had the opportunity to really explore the emotional effects of being a genetically designed donor sibling and quite frankly, she blew it.  There are many reasons why this story failed to meet my expectations.  Though it starts with Anna’s point of view, the author also uses narrative of the four other family members – Sara, Brian, Kate and big brother Jesse.  She then throws in narrative from the attorney, Campbell Alexander, and the court appointed guardian, Julia Romano.  Next, Ms. Picoult makes the mistake of thinking readers require a romance to soften the intensity of the subject matter.  Thus, we discover Campbell and Julia have a romantic history.  Then she adds a medical mystery about Campbell – he has a “service dog” but is not blind.  She saves the reason for Campbell’s service dog as a surprise twist in the end; at a crucial point in the hearing, no less.  If you took out all the plot gimmicks and extraneous narrative, this story would still be flawed because instead of being about Anna’s motivation for wanting medical emancipation, her struggle to become independent and how it affects her relationship with her family, this becomes a mish-mash of secondary character subplots.  Anna’s real motives are not that straightforward and when I learned what they really were, I felt as if I’d just read a 420-page script designed for a Lifetime For Women movie of the week.  Because so many voices are used to tell the story, they blend into one.  There’s little characterization of the primary players involved.  The narratives didn’t fit some of the characters – for the most part, Anna’s voice seemed well beyond her thirteen years.  Then, in the very last chapter, she suddenly developed teen colloquialisms that seemed contrived.  I believe Ms. Picoult did heavy research and put a lot of effort into creating this story.  But, she chose to cop-out by not facing the true emotional ugliness in a situation like this.  She candy-coated it and catered to readers who need their hands held rather than those of us who can endure raw, bitter emotion.  I recommend this only if you enjoy the syrupy, bittersweet fare often found on The Lifetime Channel.    Verdict:

              Author:  Douglas Coupland  Genre:  Mainstream Fiction   Review:   Miss Wyoming is the cookie-cutter story of a ex-beauty queen's rise to quasi-glory and her roller coaster trip back down.  And then back up again.  The protagonist is a beauty named Susan Colgate whom grew up under the thumb of a faded flower of a mother who needed a proxy to live vicariously through in order to have some action in her life.  *yawn*  Flipping through the pages, I couldn't help but to feel like I was reading an instruction manual on how  not  to write a unique plot.  Plane crash: sole survivor?  Check.  Mysterious love child?  Check.  Woman falls in love with a less-than-Prince-Charming-gorgeous beau?  Check.  The humor was staler than picked-over pastries in a Starbucks glass display case.  The one redeeming quality of this book is that the secondary characters had personalities more creative and laudable than that of the two carrying the plot.  I could read a story that included them as the main players and probably would find it amusing.   Verdict:     Wake me up when it's been edited--oh wait, it's already been published.

       Author(s):  Claire Cook   Genre:  Mainstream Fiction; Women's Fiction     Review:    Must Love Dogs  is one of those slice-of-life stories where - if the author is adept enough - ordinary events are realistically portrayed in a humorous light.  Claire Cook is one of those successfully adept authors.  Sarah Hurlihy is a forty-something preschool teacher who's been divorced for several years.  Her lively Irish-Catholic family push her to start dating again.  After her first attempt to date hilariously misfires (she responds to a personal ad and the man she arranges to meet for coffee turns out to be her widowed father), Sarah reluctantly allows big sister Carol to place an ad for her.  After years of having no social life, no dates, suddenly Sarah's life becomes chaotic with choices.  Should she date the father of one of her students?  What about men who responded to her ad?  And there's the gentleman in the dog park - though Sarah doesn't have a dog, she borrows dogs to use as props in her dating endeavors.  Despite the title, the story has little to do with dogs.  It's about stepping blindly into the dating world, being unsure of what exactly makes a good match in a partner.  Sarah finds herself using her failed marriage and the somewhat successful marriages of loved ones as basis for comparison.  But because each relationship is different and each potential mate comes with his own set of compelling idiosyncrasies and annoying flaws, Sarah must first suffer a series of embarrassing mistakes before the choice becomes clear.    I liked the humor - there were situations that made me laugh out loud.  For instance, Sarah goes to great lengths to dress nicely for a date after school but then her pants are smeared by a student bearing an object created by Sarah's father's girlfriend.    This is entirely Sarah's story, so her character is completely defined for the reader.  The secondary characters are less defined, but they each have their quirks that make them unique and memorable.  Because of this lack of definition, though, the choice for which suitor is best for Sarah isn't entirely clear.  If I had a complaint, it would be that in the end, Sarah's choice seems to be the lesser of previous evils.  This is a light-hearted story - often amusing; sometimes touching but always real.  Don't let the cover deceive you - it isn't "chick lit" - it's a story about relationships (romantic and familial), dating and starting over.    Verdict:

             Author(s):  Peter Mayle  Genre:  Fiction  Review:   A number of years ago I discovered the writing of Peter Mayle when I read  A Year In Provence . Then came  Toujours Provence  and I was completely hooked. He’s the kind of guy I feel I could pay a call on (should I ever find myself in the south of France) say "Hey Pete! How’s it hangin’?" and grab a wine glass from the cupboard. He probably makes all of his readers feel that way. That’s probably why he gets inundated with visits from strangers every summer, too.  I was hesitant at first to check this book out of the library. In fact, had I found it in a book store I would have probably compared the length to the price and returned it to the shelf without buying it. Now I want to own it because it’s one of those books I’ll want to re-read on some snowy afternoon by the fire. Mayle’s books just touch me that way.  During my Virginia Woolf feasting days long ago I found an obscure little book of hers titled  Flush . In it she told the story of Elizabeth Barrett Browning’s lap dog. It was charming and I still have it on my shelf. Mayle’s book goes a step further. He tells his dog’s story, but through the philosophical mind of the dog himself. It is, in a word, a dog’s autobiography. And it’s an enjoyable read.  Boy, as the dog is named (who is described as "a dog whose personality is made up of equal parts Boswell and Dr. Johnson, Mencken and A.A. Milne"), writes about his earliest days when left alone with his eleven siblings after his mother mysteriously disappeared, then goes on to describe his hungry and lonely youth on the farm of an abusive Frenchman who would rather he be a hunting dog. Boy preferred to watch ants. His tale then takes us to his happy placement with the Mayle family and their two dogs whom he calls, "The two old bitches." Boy appreciates Proust, contemplates Camus, and although he is ultimately perplexed by human behavior, he is an astute observer.  After his story is told Boy shares his observations on such subjects as human behavior, cats, tennis balls, and everything else that enters a dog’s reality. He concludes with  Advice To The Young Dog , a numbered list that includes such wisdom as, "Never bite vets, even when attacked from behind by a chilly thermometer. They mean well."  If, like me, you’re a Peter Mayle fan, you won’t be disappointed with this book. If you haven’t read any of his work, you should begin now. That is, if you can look at the stresses and complexities of everyday life with a certain lopsided acceptance.    Verdict:

              Author(s):  Terry Pratchett  Genre:  Satire/Fantasy/Humor    Review:   Terry Pratchett is another of my all-time favorite authors, and it is my personal opinion that he is the greatest living satirist who writes in English.  That's pretty high praise, I know, but every single one of his books skewers another aspect of the human condition in a tragi-comic way, within the confines of his fantasy Discworld.  His wit is drier than the Mojave Desert and very, very British, but the points he makes are actually quite thoughtful and insightful ones.  While he is fairly acclaimed in his native England and has been named as a mentor or great influence on the works of other prestigious modern writers, he has more of a cult following here, across the pond.  If you are going to join the cult of Pratchett,  Small Gods  is an excellent place to begin.  It is one of his less whimsical works, though it is fraught with the wicked wit for which he is known.  I've read (and reread) nearly every book in his substantial oeuvre and I consider this to be the very best--I was even assigned this book in college as part of an advanced English class (score one for me, since I already owned it).  Our unlikely hero is a novice monk named Brutha.  He is studying to be a priest of Om in the land of Omnia, a brutal theocracy ruled by the high priest, or Cenobiarch.  Brutha is just a simple fellow who gets his greatest enjoyment simply tending the garden at the Omnian Citadel... and it is here in the garden that his god manifests in a rather atypical form and begins to speak to Brutha, appealing rather desperately for his aid.  You see, Brutha is actually the very last true believer Om has, despite this vast, wealthy and brutal theocracy formed in his name.  To paraphrase an example used in the book, s donkey may start out believing in his master, but if the master beats him time and again with a stick, well, the stick may soon eclipse the master himself in the prayers, respect and fear of the donkey.  So it has gone with mighty Omnia, with the people of Brutha's time living in desperate fear of the Omnian Quisition.  Brutha's faith has always been pure, steadfast and relatively unexamined.  When he discovers that Vorbis, cruel leader of the Quisition and its torturers, has schemed and lied to manipulate Omnia into a holy war against neighboring Ephebe (an obvious parody of ancient Greece), he finds himself unwittingly swept up into the whole mess, his naivete slowly eroding.  With his nearly helpless god (a god's power is directly proportional to its number of believers) along for the ride in a box around his neck, Brutha begins to take matters into his own hands, and what happens will shape the history of the entire Discworld.  This story is about the power of religion to manipulate people, to keep them from thinking for themselves, and examines the concept of 'blind watchmaker' gods--gods who do not consider themselves responsible for what their followers do in their name, gods who never realized it was actually important to guide or nurture or do anything, really.  It is about the danger of theocracy, fundamentalism and religious extremists, as well as other people who would manipulate faith for their own aims; the difference between what is actually true and 'fundamentally' true, as well as whether or not the ends justify the means.  Incredibly timely for our current world situation, and not a book that will fail to make you think, in other words.  Unlike some of the other Discworld books, this particular novel is relatively self-contained, and doesn't include too many of Pratchett's oft-returning characters.  Those who have read other Pratchett will recognize some self-referential moments, sure, but you don't ever have to have read a single Discworld novel to thoroughly appreciate this one.  I really couldn't give it higher praise, and please, if you don't read fantasy novels, don't let that deter you from this one.  It could as easily be about our own world, and there aren't heaps of high-fantasy dragons and elves and enchanted swords and other such fantasy standbys.  The professor who taught the science fiction class I took in college (the same fellow who used  Small Gods  in that other English course) said that science fiction (and arguably fantasy like Pratchett's) is just an attempt to understand our own world through the creation of others.  Discworld is possibly the best example to illustrate that point that I have ever seen.  If you never pick up another Discworld novel, read this one.  You will not regret it.     Verdict:

       Author(s):  Edited by Steve Bender   Genre:  Reference/Non-fiction     urlLink       Review:    I'm stepping out of my normal fiction review to comment on a couple of reference books I picked up from the library. After five years of having to purchase overpriced college textbooks I tend to have a bitter taste in my mouth when it comes to non-fiction (or assigned reading, for that matter). This book, however, is top-of-the line and thoroughly enjoyable.    The Southern Living Garden Book  is a must-have for anyone whom calls themselves "Southern" and piddles around at all in their yards. Not only does it describe in detail the habits and maintenance requirements of what are considered Southern Heritage plants but also the ones that have been imported from other parts of the country and the world and successfully grown in Southern climes.   The book specifically deals with the Upper South, Middle South, Lower South (of which I am a proud native), Coastal South, and Tropical South. As the preface states, there are no guarantees to the zones in which it recommends plants may be grown, only guidelines. I have already decoded the mystery of naming two unidentified flower species in this yard based on images and information stated in this book.   The layout is handy for the researcher looking up ideas for special effects, naming mystery plants, or getting general reference information on over 5,000 plants (listed alphabetically by scientific name). The indices in the back help demystify some scientific names. There is a glossary of common gardening terms, diagrams, and more suggestions than I'll ever use. I am giddy with anticipation of visiting the botanical gardens listed in the back and ordering catalogues from the resource guide.    Verdict:        The Southern Living Garden Book  is an absolute gem for the Southern gardener. Although I don't normally purchase books when they can be checked out of the library for free, I'll be adding this one to my personal shelves and plan to use it as my green thumb bible.

       Author(s):  Roger Phillips & Martyn Rix   Genre:  Reference/Non-fiction     urlLink     Review:     The Random House Book of Bulbs  is a guide I picked up to help find some ornamentals I could plant now to bloom this fall. Although the glossy photos and exotic species detail gave me opportunity of dreaming big, the book as a whole fell short on my need for specific cultivars that would bloom in my climate (temperate)&nbsp;for my soil type (clay mixed with garbage and rocks).   The items are listed in order of blooming regardless of where they bloom. For anal retentives whom need things delineated in alphabetical order don't even bother checking this book out as you'll be frustrated with having to consult the index every time you desire to look something up: obnoxious.   I felt this book would be more useful it had divided the bulbs into their specific genus (lilium, narcissus, crocus, etc.) and then went into further detail about species. It certainly would have been easier for a novice to intermediate gardener to find specific plants by their images that way.   The cultivation and care information is limited. You would think that in a book called  Bulbs  it'd be a bit more instructional, eh?   My recommendation for future printings of this book is that they put a hard cover on it, remove the index and preface, and make it a coffee table book for die-hard gardeners. Random House is normally excellent for publishing reference books that everyone can use and understand but this one falls short on ease of use.   I'll keep looking until I find a bulb book that is more instructional and less scientific.&nbsp;&nbsp; This book is absolutely perfect for people who carry magnifying glasses in their front pockets.    Verdict:    &nbsp;

       Author:  Ann B. Ross   Genre:  Mainstream Fiction    Reviews:        urlLink        Miss Julia Throws a Wedding     Well, they've gone and done it: Binkie and Coleman, that is.&nbsp; This installment in the series spins the tale of all it takes to get a very pregnant liberal lawyer and her adoring paramour down the aisle.&nbsp; While the focus is on Binkie and Coleman the idea of two other unions is bounced around to tease the reader&nbsp; of what is yet to come.&nbsp;   I particularly enjoyed the fact that Ann Ross makes it evident that Miss Julia and Hazel Marie have a real Mother-daughter bond (as strange as it seems) in this book.&nbsp; The comic hijinx of the stand-in minister were a nice touch as well.       urlLink       Miss Julia Hits the Road     A sleazy slimy landlord has money on the brain and is intent on evicting the residents of Willow Lane and installing a water bottling plant on the property.&nbsp; In order to save the homes, which have been purposely condemned and set for demolition, Miss Julia must find a way to raise $250,000 to purchase the land.&nbsp; Miss Julia, and many other fifty-and-overs from the Presbyterian church, soon find themselves on the backs of motorcycles playing the strangest poker game they'll ever be a party to.   Ann Ross gets a bit randy in her references to male anatomy in this installment: it was quite humorous to read of how Lillian's snowball bush...erm...sprang to.&nbsp; Ross is quite adept at taking very modern situations and ideas and incorporating them into Miss Julia's very conventional straight-laced lifestyle.&nbsp; I would imagine that it is very difficult to create a character who can get herself out of sticky situations with such grace.      urlLink        Miss Julia Meets Her Match     This is the fifth (but not final) book in the Miss Julia series.&nbsp; In it, the scatterbrained plans of a overzealous Christian to build the Walk Where Jesus Walked religious theme park create chaos in the form of one harlot employee whom has apparently slept with every married man in town!&nbsp; Miss Julia, aiming to protect Little Lloyd from hearing of what sort of man his father really was, must shut this woman down and get her out of town before she has the opportunity to open her mouth and demand extortion money.   Although the book dragged a bit in the middle I was grateful to read the off-the-wall resolution which gave me an opportunity to root for Miss Julia  and  Mildred Allen's reaction to the town harlot's confessions.&nbsp; It was so outlandish to read of such a thing happening yet I have no doubt in my mind that it could.    Verdict:    Read all five and also number six when it comes out this fall--they're great at taking your mind off the "real" world, if only for a minute.    &nbsp;

       Author(s):  Karen Brichoux    Genre:  Women's Fiction (Chick Lit)     Review:  The first time I saw this book in the book store, I read the back cover and decided that it wasn't for me.  However, after recently reading (and thoroughly enjoying) the author's latest book (to be reviewed by me later), I went back and checked  Coffee & Kung Fu  out from the library.  I wish I hadn't bothered.  My initial instincts were right.  Nicci Bradford is another single-gal-in-the-big city, searching for Mr. Right, searching for a satisfying career.  Nicci is a big fan of Kung Fu movies, especially any starring Jackie Chan.  In fact, she's so big a fan, that she can name a Kung Fu movie to  match any of her real-life situations.  (This got tiresome  real  fast.)  Nicci meets Rob, a rich, handsome client of the advertising agency where she works (proofreading brochures.  Yawn.)  He sweeps her off her feet, takes her sailing, takes her out to dinner and they have fabulous sex.  And that's about it.  She and Rob don't talk and Nicci experiences serious doubts about the relationship.  At the same time, she's fascinated by Ethan, a clerk at the local coffee shop.  She feels a connection with him even though she's only seen him the few times she's entered the coffee shop.  The relationships of Nicci's loved ones crumble or begin revealing their flaws, increasing Nicci's doubts about her own love and life.  The story was told in such a flat narrative that I found nothing about Nicci to keep my interest, let alone garner my sympathies.  Nicci is just plain boring.  Her keen interest in Kung Fu movies seems more a gimmick to make her seem quirky, original, but it ends up feeling contrived.  And I really dislike Kung Fu movies and have no interest in any movie involving Jackie Chan.  So it was a real struggle to identify with the heroine and read this book through to the end.  Secondary players receive no characterization.  They blended together, had no identifying quirks or mannerisms to distinguish one from another.  Some of the scenes that were supposed to play out as heated and emotional were written in a stereotypical manner - something you might find in any random, generic women's movie of the week on the Lifetime Channel for Women.  The plot unoriginal (which wouldn't be so bad if it was handled in a unique manner.)  The resolution was predictable and unsatisfying.    Verdict:    Skip this but don't give up on the author.  Her book  urlLink Separation Anxiety  redeems  this  lackluster effort.

       Author(s):  Nick Hornby   Genre:  Mainstream Fiction     Review:  Before Helen Fielding's  urlLink Bridget Jones's Diary  kicked off the whole "Chick Lit" boom, there were just contemporary slice-of-life dating/relationship stories of single people in their 20s and 30s.  Enter Nick Hornby.  I admit I saw the  urlLink movie  first, which takes place in Chicago rather than London and stars John Cusack as the hero - a 30-something music purist/commitmentphobe.  Despite the change in country, the movie version remains faithful to the novel and I'm glad I read this book.  The story begins when record shop owner Rob Fleming has just been dumped by his girlfriend Laura for the guy who used to live in the flat upstairs.  Thus begins Rob's miserable journey to explore past relationships, why they failed and how his fanatical love of music has directed the course of his life.    Rob is a list-maker.  He and his two quirky employees frequently make  Top Five  lists of movies, music, food, relationships, etc. to pass the slow hours in the record shop.  Taking his list of The Top Five Most Memorable Break-ups, he revisits each ex-girlfriend to ask her why she thinks their relationship didn't work.  But this rehashing of history isn't enough to enlighten Rob about why  Laura  left and where his life is headed.  He must face certain realities and stop "keeping his options open" as Laura has accused him of doing.  Hornby's story is full of humor, character, lists and lots of music.  Each time musicians and their songs were mentioned, I yearned to play samples for background music as I read.    The characterizations were always realistic and quirky but not comically overdone.  It's an ages-old tale - boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back - but Hornby's rendition is wry, wistful and true to life.  If this book had come out a few years later, it would be labeled by publishers as "Lad Lit" in the current marketing ploy aimed to sell male-point-of-view relationship stories to the same "singletons" who embraced Bridget Jones and the like.    But Nick Hornby's  High Fidelity  can stand on its own as a fun, quirky, honest story about love, without the marketing ploys.     Verdict:

                                      Author: Ann B. Ross   Genre: Mainstream Fiction/Mystery/Humor    Review:   Those keeping a close watch on my reading habits may have noticed that I'm drawn to reading clusters of books by the same author.  The truth is that I can't let go of characters I liked and  must  read every book where their name is uttered or else I feel in some way incomplete.  I believe blame for this malady may be placed on my mother who purchased for my very first  urlLink  Baby-Sitter's Club   book back in the day.  That book started a sick obsession with fictional characters--so much that I wished that I was one of them.  Oh, to be a baby-sitter with insignificant problems and yearly vacations...*sigh*  Sick obsessions aside, my adult tastes have changed every so slightly, and while I no longer get my rocks off on teeny bopper three-hour novels, I do scratch and bite over books like the  Miss Julia  series because I still am unable to let go of characters I like.  Although I'm not typically a fan of mystery novels, I didn't realize this  was  one until after I finished it--a little temporary brain-fartitude for ya.  While in the first book in the series,  Miss Julia Speaks Her Mind  established that the Southern woman's place is  not  one of Civil War era of servitude to everyone but herself,  Miss Julia Takes Over  is a humorous reminder that taking the high ground is harder but will create less dirt to sweep under the rug.  As a woman, I also caught Ross's subtle hint that jealousy may be a useful tool in driving a lady to  beat the crap out of some skank  acquire the gentleman of her choice.  For those more interested in Lillian, Lloyd, and Hazel Marie, they return as well with their usual mannerisms and quirky conversational traits.  I could just wrap them up with a little bow and love them and squeeze them and ... name them "George."   Verdict:     Fine literature?  No.  But I love Miss Julia.  I can think of a couple of people just like her...  It's a good beach read.  Incidentally, if you go to the beach, I'd like to come.  I promise to be very quiet.
