        It's been a very busy week. I've been hanging out with Nelson and Ashley as usual. I practically spend all my time with those 2. LoL =P Anywho we spent one day at a camp Ashley used to work at so she could see her kids. It was cool. Nelson and I chilled and walked around while Ash did her thing. I learned how to play Noriko Matsueda's "Eternity" on the keyboard. LoL Afterwards we got kicked out and ended up hangin out with Ash's friend Liz in New Hyde Park for the night. We went to a diner and ate. Then Ash's dad came and picked us up. We dropped Nel off and I got picked up at Ash's. Ummm, then tuesday I went to work with my father. It was pretty cool and I'm glad he thinks Im such a good help. I don't know how he does his job. LoL Insane. Anywho, then I came home and watched Summerland. Damn right they better bring it back later this year! Wednesday I went to work with dad again. We went to the city for a bit and ate lunch and then we went to pick up some materials. Afterwards he dropped me off at my barber shop. While I got my haircut I was chit chattin w/Mark (my barber) Dex and Dre the other barbers there. Convos with black ppl are great. No joke. These guys are histerical man. We just talked about female celebrities and movies, and music. Then they did their Trinidadian accents. LMAO. I got my haircut and walked home because someone has been using my car lately. Ahem. I came home to get ready and organize everything for plans to six flags. We were supposed to go today but the weather in Jackson was pretty rough, bein the jerk that Iam I forgot about Nat's health. And plans for transportation got messed up too. So yes Six Flags has been delayed. Till Sunday. I refuse to go without Nat Nel and Ash. Nooo way dude. Anywho, I'm probably chillin wit Nel tomorrow, not sure. But later today I'm working with my dad again. I hate waiting for things tho LoL, Friday and Saturday are gonna be dreadfully long since Sunday I'm goin to SF. But anywho, that's all for now.

        WOW Long ass mother f*ckin day. It was unbelievably awesome tho. Well last night I got dropped off at Nelson's house. I practically live there now. LoL But it's all good, his family is like family. So we went to Bay Terrace. We went to FYE and bought Kill Bill Vol. 2 and then we went to K.B. Toys but didn't find what we were lookin for. LoL Then we went to Peter Pan Games. Ash played Pac Man and Me and Nel played some game with the shooting and the guns and what not. Our hands were hurting like hell afterwards. We walked back to Nel's house and we chilled in the livingroom to watch KBV2. We ate chinese food and we just hung out with his family and Chanty's friends. Then we watched the Chappelle Show on DVD and Ash left. We went to sleep and talked about funny ass shit. LoL Stupid Nelson. We woke up this morning and got ready to go out again. Me and Nel hopped into the Land Rover and I drove to Ash's house to pick her up. We drove back to Nel's house and we all got into the car with Nel's mom and dad. We drove to the NBA store and Armani Exchange in the city and then it started pourin like crazy. We got a cab and headed to the Bowery where Nel's parents were. We checked out some cool light fixture stores. Afterwards, some things came up and we had to make and emergency exit. Nelson Sr. gave me the keys to the land rover and I drove Nel and Ash from the city all the way back to Bayside. We took the williamsburg to the BQE into the LIE and to Ash's neighborhood. We stopped at McDonalds and ate it at Ashley's house. Me and Nel had a chat with her dad and it was cool. Awesome guy.  Then we got back in the car and we drove Ash to work. After that, the party really started!!! Me and Nelson drove ALLL OVER FRIGGIN QUEENS. HAHA. We drove to Utopia to College Point to Bell Blvd To Fresh Meadows to Francis Lewis and in circles and circles. It was SO FUN. We just acted like idiots and yelled out the window at people. Then we headed to coldstone and surprised Ash at work. We got some ice cream and a milkshake. We left and headed back to Nel's house. We watched the special features on Kill Bill 2. Later in the night we drove to Bell Blvd and picked up Nelson's parents. Then we went to Nel's new house and dropped off his mom. She went home on her own. Nelson and his dad dropped me off at home, I took a shower, and i got a bangup headache. LoL Exciting day. Seriously one of the best. anyways, tomorrow shud be another thrilling day. LoL   PEace!

         Wutup? Well yesterday I woke up, just hung out around the house and then I went out to lunch with my mom and got a sandwich from SUBWAY. Best damn sammich I ever had. Then I went to Juniper Valley, took my road test, and got my license. SWEEEEEt-ah! Um then I went home, played MVC2 for a bit. Afterwards my mom came home and I drove over to the movie theatre on Main Street. I saw Alien Versus Predator first. That movie had some sick fight scenes. Definitely the icon of crossovers. Then I went to 7/11 and got some food. After that I saw Yu-Gi-Oh. That was soo not a kids movie. There was no blood or shit like that but it was pretty violent. I think cause the US made the movie, we kinda let loose with the language and action. Good change tho. After that my mom came back with my car and we drove to my sister's apartment. I wasn't feelin too well so I had some soup and then me and my family watched the opening ceremony for the olympics. There are WAAAY too many ethnicities in this world. OY! I was madd tired and asked my family if we could leave. So we got in the car and left. I listened to some music in the car and when I got home I talked to Natalie who was ecstatic about me passing my road test. LoL Then I had a chat with my buddy Rich. I was exhausted and just called it a night. I woke up this morning and watched cartoons. I had pasta for breakfast. Hehe. Yea. I was tryin to set up plans with Nelson and Ashley for earlier today but I haven't been able to leave the house, so we're aimin to do suttin later tonight. Then monday is the last day of summerschool for me and Nel. WHOO! We did it bro! LoL Then tuesday, dunno, wednesday, I'm gonna go git a haircut. Thursday morning, SIX FLAGS!! So far a few people have confirmed but the others are still getting things straight with their parents. It's gonna be fUn. I can't wait. Yea umm...thas it. PeAcE!

         Hey people wutup? N/m here. Today was interesting tho. Me and Nel went to class and we just chilled w/everyone and talked. We acted like total idiots. Afterwards we managed to get out early. We parted ways by Blue Bay and then I drove to Juniper Valley to practice for my road test. The most weird thing happened, I saw some dude walkin and it was my good ol' buddy richie! Haven't seen that kid in awhile. We talked and what not and we def gotta hang out sometime. It's funny cuz I had a weird feeling I was gonna see a familiar face today and it turned out to be his. LoL Anywho, tomorrow is my road test, afterwards I'm probably gonna go to mainstreet and catch 2 movies, Yu-Gi-Oh and Alien Versus Predator. Then this weekend I have to try and confirm the plans for my six flags trip and speak to Nat and Kayla, seein as how me, Nel, and Ash are pretty much on board already. Thas all for now!     -Peace and what not!

         How's it going people? I hope all is well with everyone. Anyways, yesterday was really great. Me and Nelson went to class like usual. Afterwards his sister Cindy picked us up and drove us to Ash's house so we could pick her up and be on our way to Jones Beach. Then all four of us went back to Nelson's house, got our stuff together and just chilled out for a bit. We listened to Blink and looked at some pictures that Ash had on her cam. Then Nel's mom called us down and we all got ready to leave. Me, Nel, Ash and Nel's mom went in the mercedes. Cindy, her daughter and Chantelle went in Cindy's car. They picked up Chanty's friend and then we went to KFC to pick up our meal for when we got to the beach. It was quite a hassle gettin into the parking lot but we managed. We set up on the sand and we all ate like savages. Nelson you took the drumsticks you bastard! LoL Then we decided to go in the water. We got our asses kicked man, especially me. I got thrown under and whipped like three times. I got busted up on my arm and my neck tho. It was fun. Me Nel and Ash started huddling together to see if we could stand strong against the waves. Everytime one came along, Nelson would shout SHIELD! LoL ass. A big ass one came along and me and Nel jet. We left poor Ash behind, sorry dudette! Then we built a mini jacuzzi in the sand with arches and tunnels and shit. We named it mount boobular. Don't ask. It was fun. We took pictures and just laughed and joked around. After awhile we went back in the water and washed off. One of the waves almost pummeled Nel and Ash. OUCH! ::SLLLAAP!:: Then we got ready to leave. We packed our shit and got in the cars. I had a convo with Nel's mom about me Nel and Ash, while they were just chillin in the back seat. We made a pitstop at Waldbaums and had a loooong ass convo about many things LoL. I fear what my two friends may do for my 18th birthday or the next one. OY! We got to Nel's house and I got picked up right away. My mom went to pick her car up and I drove by myself the rest of the way. But that day at the beach was amazing guys, thnx alot for bringin me along. We gotta do it again! but first SIX FLAGS!!!! WHOO!   -Peace and what not.
