      I recently received 5 projects, and those 5 projects have to be handed in soon. However, that is not the problem that leads to boredom in school, the main reason to school boredom is because of tests. Tests tests and more tests, the Common test is just round the corner but there are still projects coming in. Sigh*  Today, Got back my maths paper, quite surprised actually. 21/35. Initially, thought that i would fail. Quite happy.  Feelings of the day. Confused. Have to hand in projects. Happy. Weekends are round the corner. =P

       Today started off with the usual morning run...  then it was chinese nothing much during zhang's lesson  during recess i was really pissed off at SOME people like w and p. They ask me for my homework because they wanted to copy them when i havent even finished it. They were going" Can i borrow your geography and physics i havent finished it." Then what about me??? Have they even spare a thought??? Not that i did not want to lend them my homework is just that they kept asking me over and over again until i hit the last straw. I walk out of the classroom, speechless and went to study on my own.  Then maths, nothing much except tha audrea gave some sarcastic remarks.  Physics, sigh teacher was like if you all dont shut your traps then you read the whole chapter by yourself. No point teaching.  English, nothing. Geography. AHHA! i couldnt stand Mak's face so horrible, monotonous.  Culture it was blah blah blah AGAIN.  They DNA science. Not really attentive this time round. KL was spraying alcohol on my hair arms and legs. I sprayed her back of course.=P    Reflection And Questions       &nbsp; Why did he choose her and her instead of me and her as group members? Why? He is a very good friend, is it because of the rumors??  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
