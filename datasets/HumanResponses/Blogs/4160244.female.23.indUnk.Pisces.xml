      Goodmorning ya'll It is a new day today. So beautiful, bright and breezy. It's just awesome to think how the LORD is in control of all these things! What a wonderful Creator we serve! Anyways, back to my topic. It's funny how at times we feel that we are unable to do the task that God has given us. For example, evangelism, telling the lost souls in the darkness about our precious redeemer and savior - Jesus Christ. Personally I know that this is and should be my burden to tell people what GOD has graciously done for me through Christ but it is sad that at times I don't have enough courage or boldness to speak up for Christ. I feel so weak. I feel weak today especially because I do want to go out and meet some new people today. There is this specific place where I often go and am trying to build relationships with new people so that I may win some for Christ. I do know one thing that my task is to go and share with others, and GOD will do HIS part of saving the lost just as HE did in Acts 2 and saved three thousand souls!! What a Comfort to know that our LORD is Faithful and gives us the strength. It is good to know that His strength is perfect when all my strength is gone. If HE is glorified through my weaknesses then I am blessed to be HIS child and servant. So please pray for me and for each other. We as God's children and His servants must serve HIM faithfully. I hope it made sense what I tried to share with you folks. May HIS Peace rule in our hearts and calm our anxious thoughts.

      Wow! It's been almost a week since I last wrote in here! It's so easy to get caught up with the different things that are going on in your life. O well, I am here now! Lately I have been thinking about our God and the various ways that He is described as . For example, the Book of Romans talks about GOD as being the God of righteousness (3:21), of righteous judgment (2:2,5), God of both the Jews and the Gentiles {of all} (3:29). It speaks of Him as being the ONLY ONE (3:30), eternal (16:26) and Only wise God (16:27). Our God is awesome and is able to strengthen us (16:25). He is the God of Peace (15:33), and God of Hope (15:13). How wonderful it is to belong to Him and to take refuge in the shadow of His wings (Ps 36:7)! He is the Lord Almighty (Gen:17:1) and we are to abide in the shadow of the Almighty (ps. 91:1). This morning I read 2 different verses that encouraged me and I would share them to encourage you.  "Is anything too hard for the Lord?..."  Gen 18:14  "...All things are possible for him who believes."  Mark 9:23      May the God of Hope fill you with all joy and Peace

        Now playing: Be thou my vision   Today is a very beautiful day here in St. Catharines, I think. :) I got a few things done but as soon as the afternoon arrived, I went for what I thought would be a "little" snows but it got to be pretty big actually. I had an awesome sleep but I felt bad. :( O well, next time it shouldn't happen. So I read Psalm 37:4 today. What a wonderful verse with a great promise! This verse had always been very encouraging to me. It says, " Delight  yourself     in     the  LORD  and HE will give you the desires of your heart." I had to stop and think what it means to delight in the Lord. I came up a few thoughts. It's perhaps taking joy in the Lord, rejoicing in Him or being happy in the Lord...that sort of idea. But then I wondered what it means to take joy in the Lord. There could be so many ways to answer that but I thought of one way and it is to take joy  in  Him even where things seems to be going in some other "directions". It's like what the psalmist says in Psalm 46:1: " God is our refuge...therefore we will not fear thought the earth gives way, thought the mountains..." It is to take total confidence in who our GOD is and what He can do. Also we take joy in or delight in Him by obeying His commands which shows my total obedience to God. Once we seek GOD and truly understand even a little bit, we come to realize by the power of the Holy Spirit that we'd want to obey God and hate our sin. As it says to hate what is evil and to cling to that which is good. Only God is good and we are to cling to Him. The last one I thought could be delighting in Him by enjoying HIS presence. Taking pleasure in just being with HIM as we devote ourselves to Him. That would also include our prayer and devotional time with Him. O it's so true what the Psalmist says in Psalm 16:11 : "In your presence there is fullness of Joy; at your right hand there are pleasures forevermore."  Ruth the Cook, signing off.

        Now Playing: Billy Joel, Piano man    Alright,  I am going to write a bit about cultures...I think. :o) Today I spent quite some time reading " urlLink Cultural Anthropology ". It's right on in evaluating and observing various cultures/their thoughts, ideas, values and so on. Since I come from pakistan and am in Canada for the purpose of studying at  urlLink Kawartha Lakes Bible College , I can see and understand the differences between the 2. The Book talks about how at times we don't even take time to think and observe why the certain cultures act/think/eat (and so on) the way that they do. Rather we act in ethnocentrism - the belief that one's own culture is superior to all others. Or viewing the rest of the world through the narrow mind of one's own culture. I remember in the past where people have asked me questions regarding my culture and at times they have just found some of the answeres to be quite weired eventhough they were quite normal to me. Instead of understanding, what often happens is that people consider certain cultural practices to be "uneducated" or "uncultural". O it would be so nice if we'd, instead of making our judgements/assupmtions, understand and take time to observe why certain people do things in a certain way or different than us. I think, observing different cultures help one understand his/her own culture. This also helps us appreciate the various people/cultures/styles around us.    One thing that I really do want to mention is that I am blessed with a wonderful husband,  urlLink Matthew . I thank God for him. I really appreciate the fact that he understands me, my culture/my people and is willing to learn about us all and be a part of us. This is something that both my dear family in Pakistan          I and         greatly appreciate. So wonderful!   Anyways, I should get back to my work. I just thought to share how neat cultures are and how much fun it is to observe different cultures/their beliefs and values and so on. I pray that we'd appreciate our cultures and learn from eachother - the good things!   In Christ alone,

        Now Playing: Elton John, Your Song        Asalamwalekum friends! :o) I really enjoy reading blogs by my buddies  urlLink  AndyMack  and  urlLink  Justin Gurr . Hmmm...I always wonder how and where to start! O yeah, um... we (my husband and I) watched " urlLink X-men 1 " on Sat. That was so cool. It sure would be neat to know how to do those cool tricks. I wouldn't mind having the metal come out of/through my fingers...I guess. :o) Anyways, enough about the movies I should get back to my real "title"/ topic. So, yesterday was a day of great conviction for me. At-least that is a sign that the Holy Spirit is still at work :o) Do you people ever wonder why GOD is so good and gracious to you? I do and I did yesterday. Just seeing the displeasing things that I do, I wonder why GOD would not cast me away? Why does HE keep putting up with me? He doesn't have to be merciful to me but HE does. The sermon yesterday was somewhat about humility. Being nice to people instead of demeaning them or belittling them. Man, I am guilty of this! I realize that this world is so self-centered including me. All I want is to please myself. I wonder how often we think of others. I am not by any means trying to put anyone else down but I am speaking about a human nature that I have and so does every one else on this planet who claims to be a human. :) As long as you get the point. Anyways, God's Word is full of HIS great and encouraging promises and therefore we aren't to put ourselves down but to BE very gracious and thankful to our LORD JESUS CHRIST who gave Himself up for us. What an example to follow!! I don't know, all I am trying to say is that God is SO patient with us. I am so glad that our GOD is a GOD of grace and mercy. Peace and Joy and ALL comfort. He is not a GOD who'd leave me and forsake me. His promises are what I am to cling to. He is our Hope. What a comfort in knowing that through Christ, God sees me as a righteous person! What a vast understanding to comprehend! This is what lately I have been challenged with. GOD'S Grace is marvelous and VERY BIG! Ok, that's all for now. May God rule in our hearts as we claim HIM to be our KING Peace out ya'll :o)

						   But I know who holds the future.   Today is the first day in ages that I can say I had no contact with Andrew.  I emailed him, but haven't gotten a response as of yet.  Even still, today I could not get the guy off my mind for the life of me.  I was praying about him, dreaming, thinking.  I don't feel antsy tho.  I feel peace, such inexplicable and total peace.  That it's ok to love and care about him.  It's ok to dream about our future.  That is, in my opinion the entire point of courting/dating.  It's verifying that two people are meant to spend their lives together.  As for me, it's very possible that he is  the  one .  I wouldn't even give dating him a thought unless i could see God taking us places.  So now we're on the train waiting to see where He will take us.  I can't wait!!!  God's holding our future securely in His hand: I can trust Him with it and have no worries!  But for now it's back to the grind of work :) good night!!

						   On any given night shift you are given many opportunites to think and think and think about things that are going on in your life.  So I've been thinking through many things tonite.  My thoughts are jumbled to say the least but at least they're there.  In this relationship that I have with this guy (which began six days ago) there is a definate seriousness about it on both our parts.  We have yet to hit any rough water and I know that when we do it will be taken seriously and honestly.  We both are praying for guidance and God's will in our lives.  I care about him so much.  He wants God's will but he said he'd also like to keep me around forever.  It all depends on where God wants it to go.  I care about him so very much and I'm anxious to see where God leads us!

						   Egad!  Life is soo crazy!  Last night I went over to my friend, Andrew's house to chill.  hehe He's a lot like me in the sense that when he has something important for him to say, it takes him a while to get out.  So he hums and haws for a while and then finally asks if holding hands warrents a re-examination of our relationship.  I say "Ya probly..."  So we talk for close to 1 and 1/2 about where we stand and what God has been guiding us in and the like.  So at the end of the night we agree to go to the next level.  Instead of seeking God's will in our lives individually, we're seeking God's will for our lives together.  So in laymans' terms, we are practically dating.  He was soo sweet.  He thinks it's  going to be too much fun having me around.  :)  I feel the same way about him.  He's very sweet and we are excited to see what God has in store for us :):)

						    Now playing:   Be thou my Vision   Hey there folks!  This is  urlLink Ruth Cook , Kim's friend. We used to be cleaning-buddies at our school at  urlLink Kawartha Lakes Bible College  in PTB. Hm...so I am wondering how much should I "talk" about my friend here! Ok, I think I won't expose the "bad" stuff but perhaps just a few good things. :o) Alright, here we go! Kim, I think is a wonderful girl, sister and a friend. We have had great times at the school last year. We both loved and enjoyed our cleaning responsibilities, I think. Eh Kim? Um...Not only that but then it turns out that she is also in my what we called it,  Cell-group.  Then I thought to myself, how am I ever gonna cope with this girl. She is everywhere. You know what I mean? By the way, I was only kidding, I honestly thought that it was wonderful to have Kim in my Cell-group. Now you may wonder what that's about. Well, at  urlLink KLBC , we had little groups divided among ourselves. We'd meet once a week. Just to see how everyone in the group is doing and what concerns that they might have and needed to be prayed for. So it was wonderful to have a little group like that. Sometimes we'd just hang out and have fun. Sometimes we'd pray and so on. Anyways, she was always a help. I found out one thing that she is a prayer-warrior. A person who takes time to pray for other. Over the past year, I got to know her personality and she is a wonderful friend and I love her! Besides, she is so cool and plays piano and sings songs. One thing that we'd have in common was that we'd be sinning whenever we'd clean coz other wise it gets boring. If you know what I mean. Anyways, this is all for now. I appreciate that Kim invited me to share this blog with her. How awesome! Hehehe...I can make so much trouble now! Just kidding. Ok, ya'll take care. Peace out

						   So yeah I told myself that I would never be a sentimental girl on this "blog" but I have no where else to outlet what I'm feeling so you're stuck with it.  Tonite I babysat for some friends of mine who also happened to set me up with a boy that I'm interested in (it's a mutual interest).  So I thought it would be a hugely akward night, but it wasn't!  He called me and asked me what time I was going and stuff and I ended up picking him up.  Ugh...I'm not the sentimental type but this has been a month of breaking into the unusual for me.  So we watch Muppets Treasure Island and it was super hilarious as always.  The kids are in bed and we just sit and talk  (six inch rule in place).  Then we went and filled my tires up with air after visiting with the kids' parents for a while.  I take him home.  No big deal.  He had told me on the way home to not be afraid to "rip it up" (aka sing out loud, very loud).  He appreciates my voice and loves hearing it.  That made me blush a bit.  Then he moves to say goodnight with our normal handshake thingy and he then takes my hand and holds on (six inch rule  not  in place).  We have and are going very slow in our relationship.  We arent' rushing to become something the Lord doesn't want us to be.  So we just sit there holding hands, enjoying the company.  So for now, we're still waiting on God, and trusting Him to guide us accurately and completely.  If you need something to pray for me, it's primarily my relationship with this man.  This has implications that have the potential to touch the rest of my life.  I want God's will Good nite and I'm sorry for being so "girlie" Kimberly

						    Have you ever noticed how life can take you by surprise?  The past two months have been filled with so many changes in my life I don't know where to start.  It started with my parents helping me buy a car.  Then I moved for the fourth time in just over a year.  Then I got a cell phone, a haircut and many other minor things that slightly effect one's life.  People say that change is good and I'm inclined to agree.  When everything around us is changing we have no option that I've found besides throwing ourselves completely on the loving kindness of God.  He's carried me through some of my darkest days and I cannot explain to you how reassuring that is.  The next year is filled with uncertainty, about school, work, and accomodation, but I know that God will have it all worked out and I just need to follow Him.  The rest of my life is an  enormous  question mark in my mind, but I know that it is a perfect plan in God's, so I will trust Him with it.   --Jeremiah 29:11
