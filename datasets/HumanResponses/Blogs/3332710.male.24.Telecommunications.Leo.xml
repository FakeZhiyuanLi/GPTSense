        Alright now, please understand that firstly i am just a human, being a little boy, a single life in the big real world. I don't really know of whom or whatsoever person will think about what i am about to write. But my intension are as always the truth with no hard feeling towards anyone at all. I had always been sincere to people whom i have met but sometime this kind of thing will just come and go. So in words to say i have not yet found a actual soul mate yet, only wish i could have.  &nbsp;  I had always though the present girl during the time of the relationship will be a life soul mate. But as obvious this doesn't turn out ot be true. I had always put in my very best for my relationship. But as most of everyone disappointment I had always fail to keep up the relationship. There is no one else to blam except for myself. I know i had been trying my best to keep my temper but we if you can't keep you just can't. But what i say right now i am more clam than ever.  &nbsp;  Talking about temper, sometime this wonders me you know. Why? well cause every thing happen for a reason. Some reason you just cannot explain. But well i do sometime thing that temper in a way are good for you. It do provide you with the abitlity to achive something someone else is not willing to give, or forgot to give, or careless enough to forget. But well i really don't know how to explain but that only to explain as that, every thing in this life have is good and bad or have it's pro and cons.  &nbsp;  So let's comeback to the subject.  &nbsp;  How can you tell?:  Can i say this? I wonder. you know sometime you don't actually know who is your girlfriend and who is not. I have a lot of firend whom is a girl, very very very close. So close that most people think we are in relationship. But simply we are the best of friends. So well all i could say are that I know my true first girl by the way i really feel and my planning ahead which i have lie for both of us. (to some extend most will be vannish as right now we are broken off)  &nbsp;  My girl:&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;  *** To be continue... (Hopefully not forgotten)

        A Golden Retriver !!!    urlLink  http://www.textamerica.com/user.images.san/76/IMG_415776/Thumb/_0702/T40407020740191.jpg    urlLink   urlLink http://www.textamerica.com/user.images.san/76/IMG_415776/Thumb/_0702/T40407020648531.jpg        &nbsp;  Hey strangely enough I just can't seem to fit the image to this Blog. =( Hope this will not last long. Oh well what to do, right ! =)  &nbsp;  So what now... ohh Yes my dog. My lovely cutiest dog ever. My Golden Retriver. His name is 'Maximus' (Named after the Greatest Roman General, General Magnus Clemens Maximus) * with no intension of insulting him cause i love his work. 'Maximus' also have a nick name in Thai called 'MeePoo' (Named with relate to Winnie The Pool) Reasons? Well the story is that when i first got this dog I have no idea of the name which were to use. However my maid decided to call him but the name of 'MeePoo' which ofcourse the name kind of stick to all my relative. Which shortly after that then I actually found what I wish for and dicided to name him by that name. For someway the dog only respond by the name of 'MeePoo', I wonder why... Or Maybe I too never call him by that name only had told him once or twice.  &nbsp;  'MeePoo' is a very very lovely dog:  Whom stay among my other 5-6 dogs (lost count) of which we locate him in a 'TownHouse' Building on the top floor (6th floor). As due to that simply Bangkok land are so expensive due that Bangkok is the capital of Thailand. My family have got so much dog not just all at once only, you know one at a time. A time where my mom visit some place and found a poor street dog then she dicided to take care of it. The dog somehow represent exactly delicate to each and every one of the family members of mine. My Dad, Mom, Brother, Sis...  &nbsp;  'MeePoo' is about 1yrs old now:  (Still don't know the life span of a dog) He is still very young to me. Still i do remember when he was a puppy, a Golden Retriver Puppy living in Bangkok, where it is hot in temperature. Do you know what he do to get rite of the heat? He somehow manage to get himself to a waste basin (don't know what you call it in your country) and stay there !!! Please Please no one put him there (Wish I could have a photograph) and yes the toliet is completely clean, an unused toliet.  &nbsp;  'MeePoo' don't actually know exactly how to love or share love:  Always, amongs other dog with the family. Most dogs would want to be love by the owner other dogs was afraid that everyone would love 'MeePoo' more than them. As 'MeePoo' was the last dog ever to arrive in the family. They would try anything just to get attention from the family. Jump around, Fight, Act Strangly, etc... But stood there is 'MeePoo' whom don't really care. As never had i see him do something to get the attention. But yes ofcourse my dad will take him around in his car. To pickup my mom or what ever. Do you know in my father's car, A Mercedez Benz, is completely mezz up. From the lather seating to the Dashboard are completely ... urr ... well not in their original shape. But well, my dad doesn't seem to care, nor anyone else. We still adore him. and Yes very much by me.  &nbsp;  'MeePoo' is amazingly loyal to the owner:  Wait sorry not owner but owner's parent. hehehe... You know once my dad need a surgery in Bamrungrad Hospital (a world hospital) and some how the disgrace of his sons & daughter, we couldn't find time to send him there. (cause some are working in the cruel would, both in Bangkok &amp; in rest of the world). So well my dad decided to drive there himself with 'MeePoo' so once arrive to hospital. Dog aren't allow in hospital so my dad lower down the window abit and told 'MeePoo' to stay quitly and not disturb anyone and off he goes to the operating theater. Once he was discharge the guard whom was instructed by my dad to watch over the dog while he was away, told my dad & my family that the dog was in such a good behavior that he though there was somthing wrong with the dog. We then understood that he actually understand what we tell him. *** Most of us whom are in Bangkok did go to visit my Dad once he was out of the operation theater and was resting in normal patient room. We have no idea that my dad brought the dog there with him...  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;    *** To be continue... (Hopefully not forgotten)  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;

        One thing i got to tell you are that, if you ever wonder why i set the heading of this blog in this way well let me explain. I belive everyone have their piority to things in their life. Most of these things are Family Career Friends Lover Self... Right before a year of this i use to arrage it in terms of Lover Family Career Friends Self. Why? well i don't know how to explain this but to that i guess i never knew whom would be my true love. I don't know what love is, I don't know how love can heal or hurts us, I simply have no clue at all. I only know that if i ever would have a lover a true love i would adore and take care of that person with the best ability i could ever provide. Even in relationship of over 3 person i still keep this in order. Only to find the truth of the real love then decided to re-arrange the way of thoughts.   But still the order are me being the last perosn of the chain. why? well i guess i am not truely a person whom can scarifies but to the expend that i can forgive and forget, ability to give more than take, I love helping people, even if this means i will have non. But who knows maybe i will rearrage it again once i proceed with life...   My family, career, friends - why are that always the top of the line and why are they in the exact same order? Well. cause these are the most important person whom will have an aspect in my life. if one chosses to fall out i wouldn't know what to do. Family are always the piority as these are the person whom had broght me into this world alive, to teach me, to guide me through things. Career are people whom also can teach me in the working enviroment which will enable me to gain more experience. Friends are people whom can comfort me in due of need time and vice versa.   Leaving Lover the one whom actually shift around... will this is not due to that i do not actually take these as a piority. But instate i truly adore these, but however things make me realize that these will not get me anywhere as i have never found the person whom will stay with me the rest of my natural life. I have to say if i ever find this person, and i mean truly finding this person i will put her in the highest level ever possible. Only that to say ... of not expecting much ... hopefully when she comes she will comes...

I probally guess it will have it's time to come, but not soon. So well here is my beginning. What this is is only about my life and what i have experience with people whom i had meet in the morden cruel world. I don't know how to make this sound exciting or easy to read, only thing which i will know and input are that it will come directly from the bottom of my heart. (Hey that sound like a song) hehehe. Hopefully this will not be something of which will intrest me a couple of weeks or worst days till i drop the subject.
