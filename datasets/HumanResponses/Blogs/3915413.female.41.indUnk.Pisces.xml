      First time I've had a minute to myself in the morning since we came back from vacation. The littlest one has been a restless sleeper and his "mommy radar" is on high. Seems I can't sneak out of bed in the morning without waking him up.  Vacation was wonderful, though. Just what we all needed. A week by the lake, visits from family, good weather....who could ask for more? Everyone swam a lot, sunburned a little, and relaxed. I read a couple of books. The husband napped. Isn't that what you're supposed to do on vacation? In my opinion it was dang near perfect. The 3+ hour ride home was pretty good. Little one slept almost all the way. The other 4 got along without fighting. Everyone pitched in with unloading the van, but it was mostly up to me to return everything to its rightful place.&nbsp; I actually have 2 small suitcases I've yet to unpack.  As great as vacation is, it is always nice to return home.&nbsp; The dog was happy to see us, and maybe the cats were too, but they're tougher to read.&nbsp; :)&nbsp; I was happy to see my hens again.  My garden went a little haywire while we were gone. Squash vines grew right onto the lawn and tangled themselves in the long grass.&nbsp; Weeds kind of took over in some places, and my sad little row of peas look like they've been stolen away by the munching bandits. I actually have more weeds in that row than peas. And what few peas I have are the scrawniest I've ever seen. I don't think I've ever had a garden as pitiful looking as this one.&nbsp; I dusted yesterday for varmints but I think it's too late for that.&nbsp; For all the time I've spent planting, weeding, watering and tending my little vegie patch, I doubt it'll even pay for itself this year. I'll have to be more vigilant next spring and evict the pests before I even think of planting. Of course, I have my hens to blame for my spinach patch disappearing. They got loose one day and took at that before I discovered they were out. At least it was my garden and not the neighbors', though. That would have really been bad. Their garden is picture perfect, with straight rows and tidy beds, peas all climbing perfectly on the wire trellis, tomato plants in protective surrounds growing tall and producing small green fruit already.&nbsp; Ah, well, I better leave that subject alone before my garden envy gets the best of me.&nbsp; :)  Today is Friday. Usually the husband and Son#1 get home on Thursday night, but this week they stayed an extra day to finish up a job down there. I'll be happy when the work is local and we'll be back to supper every night together.&nbsp; It sure makes for a long lonely week when part of your family lives away. Son#1 goes back to college in a few weeks anyway. He saved enough money over the summer to pay off his loans from the first semester. It's good he's thinking ahead like that. He won't be starting off his adult life under a huge cloud of debt and student loans. The husband and I both had a few years of student loans to pay off when we got married. Now I have my own to pay off, since I've taken some more time off school.... One of these days I'll get back to my own education.&nbsp; Maybe when the little one goes off to Kindergarden I'll have time to take classes again.  Fell asleep with the TV on again last night. Woke up a few times to coverage of the Democratic Convention blinking in the dark. The volume was down so low I could barely hear it, but I did catch a little of what was said. Kerry sounds like a good candidate for President, but then again how do you believe a politician? Our current president lied to us (weapons of mass destruction), the last president lied to us (although I really didn't care whether or not he slept with the intern, but I didn't like being lied to about it).&nbsp; Do all presidents lie? Nixon. Kennedy. Reagan.&nbsp;They all&nbsp;lied. Maybe it's an occupational hazard. It's so hard to tell who will do a good job in that position, but I'm really tired of the way things are going and I just don't trust the guy in charge now. Of course having a son in the military is one more reason to be concerned about the reasons he gave for going to war. He's been dishonest about the whole thing. He needs to find another job.&nbsp; Preferably one where he can do less damage.  It's going to be a beautiful sunny day with temps in the low 90's. I've got a to-do list a mile and a half long but it probably won't get done.&nbsp; :)&nbsp; The laundry will dry very fast today for sure. Especially if there's a slight breeze.&nbsp; The lawn needs a little mowing around the trees, planters, and close to the house. I paid the neighbors' boy $10 to give it a run on his ride-on mower the other day. Just the middle, I told him. I could get the rest with my push mower. It took him a fraction of the time it takes me. But then again, where else could I get such a good exercise work-out? :)&nbsp; It rained a lot the week before we went on vacation, plus I came down with a 2-day flu. The lawn didn't get mowed like it needed to, so by the time we got home the grass was pretty deep. It really doesn't bother me too much though. I know it'll get done eventually, and it's only grass for heaven's sake.  The house needs some serious tidying up this morning. I didn't clean up the kitchen before bed like I should have. But I was low on energy (imagine that), and just wanted to put my feet up and rest. It will only take a few runs through to get it under control again. Pick up a few stray toys, fold the blanket one of the kids left on the couch, throw the dishes in the dish washer, run the folded laundry to the kids' rooms, and that ought to do it. I'll run a broom over the floors real quick and it'll look just fine.  Daughter#1 has guitar lessons at 1:00 today, and Daughter#2 has yoga at the same time. I'll drop #2 at the yoga studio (she can be a little early) and then take #1 to her instructor's house. I'll have a half-hour to run to the feed store before picking her back up. My sister-in-law will bring #2 home after yoga. Aside from picking something up at the grocery store for supper, that will do it for my in-town errands. Maybe I can take the kids to the lake this afternoon so they can beat the heat.&nbsp;  Daughter #2 will be up soon and begging for company. It's her day. She is allowed company 3 days a week. She lost her Wednesday company privilege&nbsp;for bad behavior, so she's really pressing for company today. And I must admit, besides a couple of slips, her behavior has been on the good side. I feel like an ogre for taking away her company day, but it's about the only bargaining chip I have that works.&nbsp;  My big-priority job today is sitting down with the checkbook and bills. If I don't do it real soon, they'll come and take me away.

      6:30 am and I've answered my e-mail and deleted the 70 some odd junk mails. I'm still a little weak from 2 days of the flu. I never get sick, but I guess I was due for some down time. The kids were pretty good; the older ones took care of the younger ones for me. My son's girlfriend came over last night and warmed me up some soup--the first thing I was able to eat all day. She brought me a big bottle of ginger ale too.&nbsp; And ordered pizza to feed the troops. Then she took the kids to task and made them help her clean up the house. After 2 days of Mom being down for the count, it was a mess. I have good kids, but none of them would take the initiative to pick up things. It's like they don't notice the mess. Me, whenever I opened my eyes and saw how bad things were looking, I'd just roll over and close my eyes again!  Tomorrow we leave on vacation. The past 2 days would have normally been spent getting ready: packing, getting the car serviced, leaving directions for my nephew who will care for the animals while we're gone, etc. But now I have just one day to get it all done. I'll have to be like Wonder Woman to accomplish all this in one day. There will be a lot of designating going on.  Vacation is the same every year. We spend Saturday at my husband's college fraternity reunion. We've gone every year since the very first one 19 years ago. We take our tents (we need 2 big ones for all 7 of us) and camp out that night. The next day after cleaning up the facility we rent out, we head to the lake to stay for a week. My sister and her husband rent out this cabin for the entire summer and they only use it on weekends and the occasional week off from work. So they schedule in family and friends throughout the summer so everyone can enjoy this beautiful, peaceful place on the lake.  We're all looking forward to getting away. My husband's job is coming to an end and the stress of meeting deadlines and tying up loose ends is tough. Construction is a hard business, and because we're in a small town, most of the jobs are away. So he lives in a house 2 hours away during the week and comes home on weekends. Our oldest son is home from college for the summer, so he goes along with his Dad to earn money for the school year. Plus he pays for his own education, what isn't picked up by the Army and grants. It's expensive because it's a small private college, but it's a good school. He made Dean's list the first semester, so I'm hoping he'll do the same this fall.&nbsp; This will be the first time in 2 years that he's been able to go on vacation with the family. The last 2 summers he was away on Army business. First to basic training in Missouri, then to AIT in Virginia. The last time he went with us we went camping on Moosehead Lake in Western Maine. It was very remote. The wild animals drove us nuts at night. They were so tame. They had no fear of campers at all. The fox would come right up to the picnic table while we were eating. And the danged racoon one night stole a bag of chips and spent a good half hour wrestling with the bag and making all kinds of noise with it. Finally our oldest son had enough and wanted to go to sleep, so he charged out of the tent to scare it away but the coon just stared at him and didn't move. It was a big coon and our son wasn't about to tangle with him, so he went back in the tent and eventually the little beast left the bag and went off to haunt another group of campers. I love camping, but I'm happy that we'll&nbsp;be&nbsp;spending most of the week in a cabin on the lake.  &nbsp;

      Up early just to get a cup of coffee in relative peace and quiet. I know once the baby gets up my time is no longer my own. Sometimes he gets up before I can finish my first cup. It's like he has Mommy radar. I honestly don't remember the other children being as demanding on my time as he is. I doubt he's any different really, it's just I'm a bit older now. I also know that there will come a time when he won't want to spend his every waking moment in my presence and I'll miss having him near me. I've often thought that raising the kids is the easy part; it's letting them go that's hard.  I learned that bit of parental wisdom when our oldest son went off to basic training two years ago. I thought I'd prepared myself. I figured that at 18 he was ready to go off on his own like that. Well, maybe he was...but I really wasn't. I dropped him off at the armory on Father's Day that year. I remember it was raining. And eventhough I spent the day with our other three children shopping for a present for their Dad, I felt terribly lonely for the one that wasn't there.  I think that summer was the longest one I've ever spent. I waited for phone calls and letters, and counted days. And I wasn't the only one. The kids did too. I'm sure my husband missed him too, but maybe it's easier when you're working 60+ hours a week making a living to support an ever-growing family. I was due with #5 that summer. I mowed the lawn every week and fought the weeds in the garden eventhough I was too big to bend over. I fed the chickens and collected eggs and went on with everyday life, but I thought that summer would never end. I was never so happy to see September in my life.  The day I went to pick my son up at the airport an hour away it was hot. I took my youngest daughter with me, as the older two were in school. We were so excited to be bringing big brother home. As it turned out, he practically walked right up to us without us recognizing him. I sent my boy off to the Army, and they sent me back a man. No kidding. I didn't recognize my own son. My 5-year old spotted him before I did, and that was when he was practically on us. He was in a suit and tie; something I hadn't seen since his violin recital when he was in the first grade. His head was completely clean shaven. He just looked so different. I didn't care. I was happy to have him home, at least for now.
