      So i'm finally home after a fun filled week in Norwich, New York. It was a nice little vacation/visiting family. My Uncle's house is on a small lake, but it was a little too cold for us to swim in it. It was in the middle of the country so the closest store was Wal-Mart, and then Price Chopper. It was kinda neat not really having to worry about what i look like or anything cuz its not like i'm going to see anyone i know anyway, but i did get ready a couple times just to make me feel better! The weird thing was that whenever we'd go to price chopper or wal-mart, people would ask if we're from out of town... i dunno what gives it away, maybe we didn't have as many holes in our jeans or something... hehe, i guess everyone knows everyone in a small town.    On the way up there i sat by this guy who was i guess around 35 and he talked a lot. Keep in mind it was 6:00 in the morning. He asked me all these questions about growing up and told me that i should do whatever makes me happy for my career, and not base it on money. He was nice, i guess he just wanted to talk to someone. Afterwards, he went up to my dad said that he raised a good daughter. I guess that's nice, i dun really know what i said...   My uncle also has this huge rotweiler (however you spell it) and i would normally be scared of it if i didn't know him, but he's the best dog ever. He's like a huge teddy bear and it just made me want a dog really really badly now.   So tomorrow I've got 4th of July Parade (but the parade is on the 3rd) practice from 8:30-10:30. That should be exciting. I think it's stupid that we have to practice walking in a straight line in step, but i guess it's good that we do so we won't look stupid. Hopefully the parade won't get rained out since i hear it's been raining all week. Oh well, i'm home now and it feels very good.  ALSO, i'm almost done reading the book "The Notebook" so i can watch the movie soon. It's a very sweet love story. I do like love stories. It's kinda sad tho, i'm excited to finish it! This is my first book to read just because i wanted to... i feel so smart! :) And i always thought that i was a little bit of a slow reader, but it turns out that i only read slow when the book is terrible... very interesting...  Welp, i suppose this is enough for y'all to read for now. I missed all of you!!  -Lisa  Song: "Across the Sea"- Weezer

      So today is Father's Day and it was fun! We went swimming and made steaks and other good stuff. I got my hair wet wheni swam today too! I don't really care if i get my hair wet while swimming, its just that i have a lot of hair so it gets really heavy and annoying when i do, but swimming is more fun when you go underwater and have 'how long can you hold your breath' contests. I won! All that flute playing helps. :)   I'm leaving on wednesday for upstate NY! How exciting. The only thing, is that i hope that our family doesn't get sick of eachother. Sometimes when we are in small places for a week, we do get a little snappy. It should be fun though, its very pretty up there, there's mountains and everything!   I've decided that i will start on my senior overalls soon before my summer gets all busy and crazy. It should be fun and erin said she would give me her paint and stuff cuz she doesn't need it anymore. Senior years are expensive with the SR pictures and stuff.. its craazy.   I guess that's it!   Have a good night everyone!  -Lisa  Song: "In Other Words" - Ben Kweller

      So Shelly is making me update this right now... i'm not sure it will be that good, but we'll see.   Today i had to teach flute sectionals today. That went good i think. I didn't really know what to do, i dun wanna pretend like i'm a teacher or anything, cuz obviously i'm not, so i just give them tips that i know. They seem to be doing a good job, i'm excited! The squad leaders still kinda treat me like i'm stupid, and i'm like yes i do know what i'm doing, thanks.   After that, my dad was trying to figure out camera lighting and stuff w/ james so they took lots of pictures of me. I didn't smile for half of them, it gets boring after a while.   Then i went shopping at the grocery store. This butcher man kept telling me that the meat was in the back of the store and asking me if i got any meat yet. It was kinda funny. I also found Aero bars from Europe at Kroger! I got two and ate them w/ my sister. It was very exciting!   Then i drove my dad to the car dealership. Finally, he has his car back, no more complaining about my driving and now i can actually listen to music in my car.   We went and visited my great grandma in the hospital after that. She's so funny, she just keeps telling all these stories and memories she has about her cats and birds. She can't really hear what we're saying to her either because of her hearing which makes it more interesting. I dunno if i wanna get old. It seems like things get worse because your hearing goes, your eyes go, she said her tastebuds were going, you get sick, can't move around as easily, and worse of all your friends/spouse die. She doesn't complain though, maybe its not so bad. I guess it just depends on how you look at things.   Those are my thoughts for tonight.  Goodnight!  -Lisa  Song: "Always On My Mind" - Phantom Planet

      So I haven't updated in a couple days, sorry about that. But, its my plan, if i don't update for awhile, it'll make all of you appreciate it more whenever i do! Lets see, Monday, i went to the zoo with James. That was a lot of fun! I really like white tigers, but they didn't have any on Monday and most of the animals were laying down cuz it was HOT, not because I was there like james told me. They did have tarantulas though, I could've done without those. Then we cooked my family dinner and it was surprisingly very good!   Tuesday: My sister and I spent the day w/ my dad. We went and got him a new suit at men's warehouse and then we ate lunch. After that, we went to SpeedZone which was fun. I don't really like running into people while driving GoKarts, but apparently other people liked running into me. After that, i saw 50 First Dates at the dollar theater and it was 50 cent tuesday! Well, everyone else knew this information as well and it was very crowded. We had to sit on the second row which wasn't too bad, but near the end my neck did start hurting a little. A lot of people laughed really loud, which isn't a big deal, but it was a very dramatic laugh/scream which was kinda funny. That was a good movie, kinda weird sometimes, but good and cute. So the next movie i wanna see is Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.   I've been sooo tired lately and i was guna sleep in tomorrow but we have flute sectionals, so that isn't guna work out. Maybe Friday i will sleep in.   So i've had to drive my sister and dad lately cuz his car is in the shop and today as i'm driving on the highway my dad tells me that my driving seriously scares him. Can't say that isn't the first time i've heard that. But, I've never gotten a speeding ticket or in a wreck. Oh well, people just need to trust my skill.. :)  That's it for today!  Bye!  -Lisa  Song: "Automatic Stop" - The Strokes

      I had a really fun time today. First, my family and i went and ate at IHOP and then we drove to Royse City to see where my dad will be working next school year. Yes, in hick Texas, but thats ok. After that, we went and got two new fish which was kinda fun, i guess. After that, i had to drive my sister to 2 different GameStops to find some kind of memory card thing. We were the only girls in there at both stores. What is it with guys and video games??  After that adventure, I went out with James for the night. We went and ate dinner at BJ's Grill... I didn't like the fod that much... well.. besides the dessert which was very good. Then we came to my house and cleaned off the shoepolish on my car (because my dad has to drive it next week and told me i had to) which took soooo long, but most of it is off! Hooray! In the process i got tons of bugbites on my legs. THEN, we met up w/ melissa and charles at sonic. We caused a little bit of a disruption, but it was more fun that way.  That was my whole day, which doesn't sound as fun or long written down... but it was. So right now my parents are at a concert @ the smirnoff center... how funny. My dad's in a (classic) 'rock' band, and now they're at a concert. But thats ok, its Chicago and Earth, Wind, and Fire... in case any of you kids know who those guys are.   have a good night everyone-  LISA  Song: "Down" - Ben Kweller

      So today got off to a slow start... by a slow i mean sitting around doing nothing until 4 o'clock. Then I went shopping w/ my mom which was very exciting. During all of my sitting around, i did get to explore the polyphonic spree website ( www.thepolyphonicspree.com ) which got me SO excited for their new cd (Together We're Heavy) coming out in July. I can't wait!!   So back to what i did yesterday, since today was not that interesting... I went to the flute party which was ok but my car did get shoepolished. I dun really mind that, but i do mind it saying "Boners Rule" and "Boner Time". The "boner" was referring to tromboners, or trombones... I bet thats what all of you thought of first, too, right?? Yeah, i didn't think so. Thats also not what old men at stopsigns think of first when they are laughing at me.   I also went to a barbecue at Grapevine Springs park which was fun, minus all of the spider/ant things. It also did take a while to light the grill (like 30 minutes) but it was fun seeing and talking to friends.   Now, i am not doing anything besides updating this. Shelly told me to update it yesterday cuz its entertaining... i'm glad i can entertain you guys w/ my boring life. I'm not sure i have much more to say.   have a great night guys!

      So yesterday was an exciting day. It was James and my ONE year and TWO month anniversary. For our one year we wanted to eat at Melting Pot, but we were poor cuz it was around prom time, so we decided we would eat there yesterday instead. Oh, the food was so good, and we had a lot of fun. As a matter of fact, i think i still feel full from last night.   The only bad part was that i guess people thought no one else could hear them talking, (cuz the booths are really secluded) and they kept talking about being high all the time, and this other little kid said that his mom was stupid cuz she was canadian. It was kinda funny.  Today, i have the exciting and wonderful flute party... hopefully it will be just that, exciting and wonderful...  I guess i'll go and be productive... and thanks you guys for your supportive comments... but, melissa, i'm beginning to think you comment on MY blog more than you update yours... hehe... and leah, i wouldn't know about your blog because my computer won't let me read it cuz it has bad words i guess.

      So I didn't make the Fort Worth Youth Orchestra either... and i'm beginning to wonder, if this is what i wanna do, why am i not even good at it now? Like, sure, i'm good at it for my school, but i don't seem to be anywhere else. Does this mean that i'm just not meant to play flute.. cuz i really love doing it. I guess i'll just have to try hard this year.   I took a long nap today and it felt really good, usually i just feel worse when i wake up, but i def. needed this nap today.   Oh yeah, i got yelled at by mason for the first time as section leader today... well, it wasn't me personally being yelled at... but it was exciting! You know, the usual "flutes aren't counting loud enough" and something else... hehe...   -Lisa  Song: "Do You Realise" - The Flaming Lips

      Today was pretty good. We didn't have to go outside @ camp today because it was raining so badly so we just stayed inside. After camp i went shopping with my sister which was also fun just cuz shopping is always fun, and my sister is fun as well. I got some clothes and i'm excited to wear them! haha... then i went to get gas.   It seems like gas stations make me really dumb because i always do something wrong when i'm there. Usually, i just drive away w/ my tank still open and people give me strange looks. Today, on the other hand, I must have forgotten which side my gas tank was on or something because i pulled in (very nicely) and got out and put my card in, and then realized that my gas tank is on the other side. So, i have to cancel everything and drive around in circles until i could get my car in the right position again beside a different pump. People did look at me kind of funny, but oh well. I don't really like getting gas.  Oh yes.. i also watched "Made" where that 'popular' cheerleader girl tries to become a skateboarder. It was interesting, but she was talking about how she didn't want to be popular anymore and would much rather be "a band nerd or something like that" and only have a few close friends. And i'm thinking... hrmm.. i'm in band, does that only mean i'm allowed a few close friends cuz i sure hope not. I think i have a few more than 3 good friends. Oh well...   Goodbye everyone, and thanks leah for your nice comments!   -Lisa  Song: "Mr. Blue Sky" - Electric Light Orchestra

      I know its really late and i'm exhausted, but i've been wanting to do another post for a really long time (a whole day)... so here it goes:   I had my first day of freshman camp as section leader today. It was fun! But, even though i'm older than them, freshman girls can be intimidating... i felt weird just going up and introducing myself and having them laugh at me. I started off the day rough by being late to our leadership meeting, but mason didn't seem to notice or care... can't say i didn't mind that. Supposedly i'm supposed to get 3 hours of detention.. but oh well. Collin was like 15 minutes late... sometimes i wish i didn't care like him. Then i had to teach people outside. Sometimes i feel like my squad leaders think i'm either really stupid or just retarded cuz they seem to coach me and tell me what to do a lot. I'm really not stupid... it may seem like it sometimes, but its just cuz its kinda funny sometimes, i don't really think i am. I just wanna be like hey, i have a brain as well... yay!.. lets see... then playing...  that girl who's supposed to be really amazing was good, but not as good as others were saying.. thats a relief. I came home and watched some tv... then went to see harry potter. that was fun... but i dunno if i either missed some things by not seeing the second movie or i just didn't like it as much... who knows... we found things funny that weren't really supposed to be funny... but who cares.   there's this bird that sits on my window sill every morning and all day long. Sometimes i'm ok w/ its constant chirping, but lately its just bothering me cuz he just keeps chirping and won't stop. I mean, you'd think it'd have something to do all day besides make noise.. oh well. Its funny that i'm not so tired anymore after i've started writing this.  I guess this is enough for you guys to read for now. BTW- thanks for the comments guys, it makes me feel special!   adios-  Lisa  Song for right now: "Brand New Colony"- The Postal Service (i dunno why, i think it was the last song i heard before i got outta my car so its stuck in my head)

      So looking around at everyone's info, i do notice that many people have these blogs. I was holding out for a while because i didn't want to "follow the crowd" but, now that its summer and now that i have much more free time, i've decided that I'll make one. I dunno tho, i kinda prefer talking to actual people sometimes. Well, we'll just see how i like it.   Today I have a flute lesson, and maybe memorzing the steps to marching so i won't fail that quiz on Monday and won't be able to teach... haha... what a bunch of crap... Welp, i should start getting ready now...   bye kids-  Lisa

      I just realized i haven't updated this thing in almost a week. Lets see... since last post i've finished leadership camp, taken some practice senior pictures w/ my dad (which turned out pretty good), got my senior overalls (now i just have to make them), and i got my hair cut yesterday. It's just a little shorter and a few shades darker now... a lot closer to my actual hair color.   Today is my last free full day of summer. Wow... i can't believe that... i think i'm kinda upset now. Tomorrow is the first day of band camp and it won't be as bad because it's wednesday and we don't have night time band camp.   All of my friends are back in town and it's very nice! I do love them because they're a lot of fun and we laugh a lot and i like it!   I just went to walmart w/ leah to buy her new rims for her car (because one had fallen off so she only had 3)... and the rims that saturns come with are very very plastic. we changed them in front of my house and it was funny because we're both not very smart when we're apart, and when you put us together we're still not very smart. our hands got all black and we felt like mechanics, but it was funny because she thought that pliers were called a wrench, so i was looking for a wrench and it took a while. And to make it even funnier... she just informed me that as she was driving home, before she even got out of my neighborhood, the rim that I put on fell off and rolled down the street so she had to park her car and get it. and we were so proud of ourselves....  I guess that's about it...   Bye!!  -Lisa

      I was thinking and i just realized that A LOT of my good friends are out of town! How sad is that. I only have a few left this week. It's not like i'll be able to hang out w/ them anyway cuz i'm going to be busy these next couple of days, but still... the thought of the others gone is sad. :(  Anyway... i saw 'mean girls' tonight with my sister. It was very funny... they thought of some really cruel things to do! I'm glad that my friends don't secretly hate me and that they don't try to ruin my life... thanks guys! I appreciate it!   Leadership camp (aka try to kill them by running and doing crazy pushups camp) is getting better by the day. It's actually not that hard w/ the exercises and stuff, i'm just outta shape.   I'm getting my hair cut on monday... any suggestions on what i should do will be appreciated!   I guess that's all that i have to say right now...   bye guys!  -Lisa  Song: "Dead Leaves and the Dirty Ground" - The White Stripes

      Oh yes, i am home after a week at Pine Cove! Wow... i have learned and grown so much in just one week, it's amazing. I wish i could write on here everything that i've learned... but it's so much that one: it wouldn't fit on here, and two: i can't even remember everything. A week at a camp where everyone passionately loves the Lord is just amazing, thats all i can say, amazing! I feel like i have grown and changed to much in a good way, and i'm so excited to see where all of this takes me!   I also think it's amazing how close 7 strangers in a cabin can grow in just 7 days. I seriously love those girls and its so crazy that just 7 days ago they were strangers to me. God works in such awesome and wonderful ways and it's so neat to step back and look at everything he's doing!   I just got a little taste of what being a senior feels like, and it really does make EVERYTHING, even simple things, 100 times better, just because you're a SENIOR!! But, it also makes things sadder because its the last of everything. Last week was my last week at Pine Cove as a camper... that is so sad. I'm considering being a counselor there over the summer... it's just hard because i couldn't put down my flute for 5 weeks and not practice, especially if that's what i'm going to continue doing in college... i guess i'll have to see about that when it comes.   That's my mini summary over my FABULOUS week last week. I am so ready to go out and get the new Polyphonic Spree album "Together We're Heavy"!!! I"ll do that sometime today, hopefully.   Well, that is all i will say for now... it does feel good to be home, though. I do love my bed!  Bye kids!  -Lisa  Song: "I'm Always In Love" - Wilco

      I've had a really good time these past couple of days. My friends are fun! I had flute sectionals yesterday which actually was fun because we played fun games instead of actually practicing music for a little while. I liked it and hopefully they did as well. I took my sister to her oboe lesson after that. It's really boring just waiting around for an hour, i don't like it. I hung out with shelly after that because shes in mexico right now! We had a lotta fun together!  Today i went up to the bandhall again and helped do random things. The tasks he asks us to do are funny. He gave us a ring full of keys and wanted us to check and see which doors around the bandhall each key went to. That's so random, not to mention he had like 4 of these full key rings. Then we put some labels on folders, BUT mr. pace gave us each a bag of m&ms which made it so worth it... haha. After that i went and ate lunch w/ leah and because she works at rainforest cafe she gets a 50% discount at a couple restaurants so it's cool. We ordered way too much food (we didn't realize it was that much) and took home a lot. We felt kinda stupid, but it was funny.  i just realized how terrible my life is going to be once full band camp starts. somehow i forgot that i really can't hang out with anyone once it starts up because it's from 8-12, and then 6-8 something. i only have a few hours in between that where i'm just really tired, and then when i get home at night i'll just want to sleep because it's exhausting. thats crazy. i hardly ever see my family during that time too. that stinks...  i guess that's about it.  and you know, i wouldn't mind a few comments every now and then to make me feel special. :)  adios- Lisa  Song: "Nothing Better" - The Postal Service

      why is life so complicated. seriously. i wish i knew the answer to my questions or even if what i'm doing is right. i mean yeah yeah i know that we're not supposed to know the future and it would make life even more complicated... but sometimes i don't care, i wanna know. i don't want to wait for the things that take time...   i mean, am i just being impatient?  isn't it funny how love can make things so screwed up and terrible, but at the same time it makes life worth living...  it's just that a lot of people have been asking me for answers to their problems and it sucks that i can't tell them 'if you do this, it will get better...' etc. i don't like it when i have to be like... i'm really sorry i dunno what to tell you.   tell me, how is it possible to not even be sure of my own feelings... i mean if anyone would be sure of them wouldn't it be me? yet, i am so completely confused.   wow... that was a lot of different thoughts at once, but if feels good to get them out. sorry that you guys had to listen to my venting, but i feel better if that helps any.   ok, well i'm done for tonight, or this morning. it is kinda late.   bye- Lisa  Song: "Trouble" - Coldplay

      Well lets see, i've been kinda busy lately. I've seen a few fireworks shows in the past couple of days and done some things.   I just wanted to tell everyone that i'm so grateful for having the best friends in the world. They really do care about me a lot and I am so very lucky to have them. Thanks guys, you really do mean a lot to me. Also, my family is wonderful as well. God has blessed me with the people he's put in my life. I hope that i'm as good of a friend to you guys as ya'll are to me.  Hrmm... camp is coming up soon and that should be fun, lets hope.   Ughh... after pine cove camp, it's leadership camp, and then it's full band camp, and then it's welcome back concert, and then it's my senior year of highschool. It's guna start getting busy!   I have a lot of mosquito bites on me from being outside these past couple of days. But that's ok, fireworks are fun to watch, but bad Richardson community band is not so fun to listen to.   well i think that's all i have to say for right now  bye guys  -Lisa  song: "What Ever Happened?" - The Strokes

      I just realized the other day that some of my friends are actually moving away and going to college soon. Like in the next week soon. How sad is that? I'm really going to miss all of you, even if i haven't seen some of ya'll this summer, just the thought of you guys being in a different city or state is quite sad i must say. I just wanted to tell all of you new freshman that i love you and i hope college is fun and that your roommates are very nice!   Come support me at the welcome back concert tomorrow (friday) night at 8pm at the CHS football stadium! I get to announce all of the flute's names so make sure you cheer really loud!!!  Thats it for tonight! School starts soon which means no more band!!!   Bye!  -Lisa  Song: "Suitcase Calling" - The Polyphonic Spree

      I'm thinking since nobody commented on my last post that i don't have any classes with anyone i know. Thats fine, i can make new friends... and sit by myself... and not talk to anyone. Nahh just kidding it'll be cool. The only part that ever worries me is lunchtime. I know that the odds are that i will know at least ONE person in my lunch, but still... its scary! Even when you're a senior!   I think i'm either getting sick or i am just extremely tired. Both are not so good. The weird thing is that i will be tired in the middle of the day, but not at 11:30 at night like right now. I'm wide awake now, but i was definately dragging all day long today. I did get to go shopping for some school clothes though and i got some super cute jeans and a few shirts! My mom said her goal was to keep me away from belts and shoes, since i have way too many of both of those. I did find two belts that i really like at american eagle. I'm thinking i'll sneak those into my birthday present from my parents. What can i say, i just can't resist buying belts.   Anyway, I usually would tell y'all what i've done all week, but i think its pretty clear to anyone who knows me what i've done all week. I'm really guna try and make this post not mention B-A-N-D in it at all because i realized that i have talked about it a lot and i'm determined to have a life outside of it! You know, for like 3 hours a day during the week and then the last half of saturday and all of sunday i'll have a life outside of it. :) Actually, i think i just broke my goal because i was just talking about band, i just didn't actually say the word. Oh well, can't say i didn't try.   So my parking spot is not so good. A two lane "road" is all that makes my spot a senior spot insteada a junior spot. Oh well, if you think about it, no spot is a bad spot. I mean, my spots last year were the ones by the tennis courts, and this one is definately better than that, so i'm happy. Plus, it's my parking spot and nobody elses which makes it neat too!   Summer is almost over and i can't believe it went by that quickly. I just realized that i never took my books and binder outta my backpack. It's still sitting on a chair in my room. I should clean that out sometime soon.   Ok, well that's all i feel like saying for right now.   -Lisa  Song: "Always On My Mind" - Phantom Planet  P.S. - I am trying to figure out a good bible verse to put on the back of my senior overalls and i have a few already picked out, but if anyone has a favorite and would like to make a suggestion please comment and let me know! :)

      Hello friends!   I decided to put my schedule in here because my profile doesn't fit that many words in it... its weird. So anyways, this is my schedule for those of you who would like to know... if you have a class with me comment on here and then we can be excited together!   Also... i'm only putting 1st trimester on here because 2nd and 3rd are messed up and i need to get them changed eventually.   BAND - Mason GOVERNMENT - Hogan BCIS - Redding COMM. APP.. - Kunkle FLEX!!! (which will be spent doing band related things anyway...)   I'm thinking its guna be really easy because i only have one core class. I shoulda just taken AP Government... oh well. Maybe i'll just practice a lot or sleep or something.   Well... band is really hot and i have spend on average 9 hours a day there this week... its crazy. 7:30- 1... and then 4:30-8:30. Oh well... tomorrow is wednesday which means after 1 o'clock.. the rest of my day has nothing to do with band!!! yay!! wednesdays are my new favorite days!!!   Adios!  -Lisa  Song: "Gone" - Ben Folds

      Yay!!! This is the only day since wednesday that i haven't had to go to the highschool and march around and let me tell you... it feels great! Too bad i could only sleep in until about 9 this morning... i was hoping i could do better than that. The funny thing is that even when i don't have band, i have to do other band related things like my flute lesson which is today... so i never really get away from it.   Last night i saw napoleon dynamite... and it was hilarious, i think i might have laughed the whole time at everything. I do think a lot of things are funny, too, but it really was good. At first i was kinda confused, but eventually you get it. So many lines from that movie are greatness... it will definately be something they will talk about on "I love the millennium" or something like that on VH1 in many years. I wonder what they would call that show... there's "i love the 90's" what would it be... "i love the 00's", "i love the 2000's"??? thats weird... i guess they'll have to think about that...  shelly and i have gotten a little further on our overalls... hopefully they'll be finished by the first football game AND hopefully they'll be cute as well!! i'm sure we'll do a good job!   i also went to the annual band leadership party yesterday which was fun! the funny thing is that we are such band kids because our games are like... "DRUM MAJOR DUEL ON THE DIVING BOARD!!" and "SECTION LEADER DUEL"!! funny stuff.   ok, well its time to begin my sunday! its funny how its almost been a week since the last post and not much has happened in my life besides band... how sad.   Bye guys!!  - Lisa  SONG (i forgot this last post!!): "Do You Realise" - The Flaming Lips  "Girls only want boyfriends who have great skills. You know, like nunchuck skills, bowhunting skills, computer hacking skills... "     haha... oh so true napoleon, i mean, those bowhunting skills really get me!
