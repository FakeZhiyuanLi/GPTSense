        First diary entry.... 14 August...    And so to my first diary entry proper, having set up this blog and put up the cast and crew lists....   A fortnight ago there was a technical meeting held between myself and my principle designer Dave Norwood with the following members of the crew: Gordon Hamlin, Alan Prior, Jill Saunders, Lesely Francis, Lorraine Shuker, Phil Ashbey-Crowe, and Maureen Melville - actors Don Hirst and Chris Saunders also attended to lend their expertise.  I remember when I directed my first show with Harlequins ( urlLink Antigone  in 2002), we had a very early meeting with the crew because it was quite a complex play; but no way was it THIS early. As I post this, the show is still 2 months from rehearsals and there will be two more productions staged at the Theatre before we go in ( urlLink see here ). But this is an even more demanding piece given my self-set target - TO CREATE THE MOST IMPRESSIVE, ENJOYABLE AND PROFITABLE SHOW IN THE HISTORY OF THE HARLEQUIN PLAYERS. What have I let myself in for.....  I've had my first actual nightmare about it - the one in which I am Terry Gilliam in a 'Lost in La Mancha'-style maelstrom of disorganisation and inadequate funds. But its early days yet and the theatre's treasurer (Nick Hughes) hasn't yet seen a lot of the plans, so there is still fun to be had before the pain sets in...  Speaking of Terry Gilliam, that brings me to another  'Python  spin-off, a filmed version of 'Wind in the Willows' directed by Terry Jones. I've seen this film 4 times now and sincerely hope that some of my cast (Chris Saunders' 'Mole', and Amy Norwood's 'Chief weasel', to name two) will watch and learn a thing or three from this hilarious, if schizophrenic, movie. I like the way Steve Coogan plays Mole as Mouse-like and fragile but HATE the way this jars with the cartoony (not to mention ancient) Rat played by yet another  Python  Eric Idle. I know that my Rat needs to strike fear into a series of adversaries and it wont work if all that the Weasels are afraid of is that he might burst into a song about how great it is to have a 'dong' at any moment. I have been able to cast Gary Prest in our production, a physically strong actor who I'm sure will dominate the little fights that the animals occasionally encounter. Yes, see the film as research, but do me a favor - tell me who this is supposed to be entertaining, the children or their parents who remember that Brian was  not  the messiah!? I really detest film or theatre which has no conseption of who its audience is...  I seem to have drifted from the tech-meet (sic) that I started to blog about at the start of this post, but then thats blogs for you!  To resume, the set design is currently going through a horrendous number of re-revisions due to some sightline errors that Dave's first model presented. We have in mind a giant semi-doughnut, but we now need to give this a sloping Right-to-Left effect so that the characters can get from one level to the next. The bonus of doing this is that the Wild Wood (which is stage left) shall be revealed. We are putting in a permanent platform for our musicians (oh that's another thing, Patrick, the MD, doesn't have any yet...) and trying to resolve the Toad Hall issue by using pop-ups. Toad Hall is not seen as an interior until near the end of the play, and I didn't want to neglect it; hence an interesting idea (forwarded by Don Hirst at the meeting) of creating a giant pop-up set is under consideration.... watch this space....  We were able to kick around some ideas for costumes too but I wont go into these at this time. The main thing is to get measurements and information to the costume ladies...  Finally, I am bursting to get my teeth into the sound plot. I want Patrick to accompany the songs and provide a few instrumental links here and there, but I would also like to use recorded music behind some of the scenes (e.g. to send the traveling caravan party to sleep in Act 1, or to add a background to the fights). Whilst all my shows are musically complex, this is the first time I have ever directed a play with  songs  in. I have therefore opted to go all-out and use classical music (of which I know next to nothing) entirely for these background bits and scene changes. In making theatre, it is always fun to crash through whatever boundies you through once existed in your mind.  Hell, I might even drop in a dance sequence somewhere! So sorry regular-Jon-Kerr-production goers, no Radiohead album tracks in this one! Prepare yourself more for  Eine Kleine Nachtmusik...     I'll love you and leave you for now, but do return soon for another update.  Jon x
