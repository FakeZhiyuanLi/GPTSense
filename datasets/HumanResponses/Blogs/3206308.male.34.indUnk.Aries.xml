      Have a good weekend y'all.  I'll be finishing off some shoeboxes, entertaining the kids, watching an old 76ers/Lakers game with some mates and as always, enjoying the company of my gorgeous wife.  Hopefully Carlton can get a win over the Dees and make my weekend complete!!

       NBA Update:   The Sacramento kings have just knocked over the Dallas Mavericks, 119-118, to close out the best of seven series 3 games to 1.  Mike Bibby killed em, scoring 36 points.  The previous 3 games in the series were a defensive struggle so it's good to see the Kings back to their scoring ways.  Go C-Webb, Go Kings!!  Minnesota - YOU'RE NEXT!!

      How many stuff-ups in a week can there be?    First up some public disclosure.  I think George Dubya Bush is a fruitbat.  I think the reasons for the invasion of Iraq were dangerously false, misleading and deliberately construed to garner public support in a situation where the real reasons (which I believe to be strategic Mid-Eastern presence, access to oil infrastructure and good ol revenge) wouldn't have been digested, even by a flag-waving post 11/9 American and allied public.  Be that as it may, there's now a responsibility to clean up the mess and make sure that the country the 'coalition' leaves behind will be a better place for the effort.  The (remaining) integrity of the world's greatest superpower is at stake, not to mention the ongoing lives of millions of people living in the country, so you'd think the US would be making every effort to make good on it's pre-war promises of reconstruction, security and nationhood for the people of Iraq.  Since then we've had a group of US-friendly dudes installed as Governing Council and a whole bunch of reconstruction contracts for friendly nations (read: business opportunities) at what I'm sure are realistic prices, amongst a whole bunch of other eye-poppers that have been covered well enough by others.  So what's the latest trend amongst the well-meaning US-led coalition?  Remember, we have the Iraqi's best interests at heart!   Stuff up no 1. - Lets re-design the Iraqi flag!   Chris Allbritton has a  urlLink great post  on his website dealing with the foolishness of this manouvre.  In summary, to the Iraqi people it's being taken as another element of thier identity and existence being imposed on them by their 'liberators'.  Also, check out  urlLink Riverbend (girlblog from Baghdad)  for some local thoughts on the event:   I also heard today that the Puppets are changing the flag. It looks nothing like the old one and at first I was angry and upset, but then I realized that it wouldn't make a difference. The Puppets are illegitimate, hence their constitution is null and void and their flag is theirs alone. It is as representative of Iraq as they are- it might as well have "Made in America" stitched along the inside seam. It can be their flag and every time we see it, we'll see Chalabi et al. against its pale white background.    Stuff-up No 2 - Let's have some liberator-style fun with the prisoners!  I'm pleased to see that a lot of US authorities came out pretty quickly to condemn this.  The photos I saw on the news last night and on the web news services such as  urlLink here  and  urlLink here  were evidence of a total abuse of power by the US officers and staff charged with the supervision of Iraqi prisoners.  Now, all the  urlLink Right   urlLink Wing   urlLink Death   urlLink Beasts  out there will probably start harping on about 'how us Coalition-haters would probably prefer to have Saddam back torturing these people - at least these people were just having some harmless fun with the prisoners'.  Not so, I'm glad Saddam's gone, even if I didn't agree with the fabricated premise for going in to get him.  But you'll never convince an occupied people that you have their best interests in mind whilst you treat their kin the way these photos depicted.  And right now the Iraqi people need a whole ocean's worth of convincing.   An update: Sure enough,  urlLink Tim Blair has gone down the predicted road

      Had my first experience with mixed sporting codes last night.  Watching my 16 year old play a game of U18s basketball against another team with a girl playing point guard.  Now bear in mind, on the program it says U18 boys competition.  And there she was, 5 ft 0, running aroud among these 6ft plus giants during the warmups.  In my preconcieved mind I figured she was a mascot or something, maybe one of the players' little sisters, but come game time there she was on the team, and as a starter!  She played around 30 of the 40 minutes of the game, sank at least three 3-pointers, dished a bunch of assists, ponied up to set screens and jumped into the middle of packs to grab rebounds.  I was amazed and my mind was changed.  Much respect.

      Call me a prude, but a night of getting the togs off and masochistically manipulating the manhood isn't my idea of fun.  Turns out the majority, actually  all  Hobartian blokes agree as the Puppetry of the Penis guys had a hard time (pardon the pun)  urlLink getting anyone to turn up to auditions .  Funny though, as I cruise around Hobart at lunchtime getting harassed for a buck for every cause under the sun, there's evidence of there being more than enough  urlLink tossers  going around.  You think they'd have a flood of applicants really.

      Occasionally I get a funny one on email that's worthy of reproduction.  Such is the case here.  A nod and a wink to Kriggsy for this one:    This is an actual essay written by a college applicant. The author, Hugh Gallagher, now attends NYU.  3A. ESSAY: IN ORDER FOR THE ADMISSIONS STAFF OF OUR COLLEGE TO GET TO KNOW YOU, THE APPLICANT, BETTER, WE ASK THAT YOU ANSWER THE FOLLOWING QUESTION: ARE THERE ANY SIGNIFICANT EXPERIENCES YOU HAVE HAD, OR ACCOMPLISHMENTS YOU HAVE REALIZED, THAT HAVE HELPED TO DEFINE YOU AS A PERSON?  I am a dynamic figure, often seen scaling walls and crushing ice. I have been known to remodel train stations on my lunch breaks, making them more efficient in the area of heat retention. I translate ethnic slurs for Cuban refugees, I write award-winning operas, I manage time efficiently. Occasionally, I tread water for three days in a row.  I woo women with my sensuous and godlike trombone playing, I can pilot bicycles up severe inclines with unflagging speed, and I cook Thirty-Minute Brownies in twenty minutes. I am an expert in stucco, a veteran in love, and an outlaw in Peru.  Using only a hoe and a large glass of water, I once single-handedly defended a small village in the Amazon Basin from a horde of ferocious army ants. I play bluegrass cello, I was scouted by the Mets, I am the subject of numerous documentaries. When I'm bored, I build large suspension bridges in my yard. I enjoy urban hang gliding. On Wednesdays, after school, I repair electrical appliances free of charge.  I am an abstract artist, a concrete analyst, and a ruthless bookie. Critics worldwide swoon over my original line of corduroy evening wear. I don't perspire. I am a private citizen, yet I receive fan mail. I have been caller number nine and have won the weekend passes. Last summer I toured New Jersey with a traveling centrifugal-force demonstration. I bat .400. My deft floral arrangements have earned me fame in international botany circles. Children trust me.  I can hurl tennis rackets at small moving objects with deadly accuracy. I once read Paradise Lost, Moby Dick, and David Copperfield in one day and still had time to refurbish an entire dining room that evening. I know the exact location of every food item in the supermarket. I have performed several covert operations for the CIA. I sleep once a week; when I do sleep, I sleep in a chair. While on vacation in Canada, I successfully negotiated with a group of terrorists who had seized a small bakery. The laws of physics do not apply to me.  I balance, I weave, I dodge, I frolic, and my bills are all paid. On weekends, to let off steam, I participate in full-contact origami. Years ago I discovered the meaning of life but forgot to write it down. I have made extraordinary four course meals using only a mouli and a toaster oven. I breed prizewinning clams. I have won bullfights in San Juan, cliff-diving competitions in Sri Lanka, and spelling bees at the Kremlin. I have played Hamlet, I have performed open-heart surgery, and I have spoken with Elvis.  But I have not yet gone to college.

      Well I'm pretty pleased.  The Kings have won one on the road.  That's the Sacramento Kings of the NBA (basketball for you sportingly challenged types).  It's  urlLink playoffs time in the NBA  and the Kings, who have been roundly criticised over the last few weeks, are playing the Dallas Mavericks.  Prior to today the Kings were leading the 7 game series 2-1, with both teams having won their home games.  A series doesn't really start however until one team wins on the road.  The Kings are now up 3-1 going back to their home floor for game 5.  Go C-Webb!  Go Kings!!  Basketball is my ultimate sport of choice, with Aussie Rules (Football) a close second.  With the playoffs in mind, here's the Swader form guide.  Likely Second round match ups:   LA Lakers vs San Antonio Spurs  - Spurs win in 6 games.  Not only have the Spurs got the unstoppable, boring Tim B Dunkin, Antoine Parkere and Manu Gino-bili - they've got the ultimate playoff trump card - Big Shot Rob - Robert Horry.  When was the last time an NBA championship was won without either Steve Kerr or Robert Horry?  Waaaaaay back in the early-mid 90s (though possibly 99 - haven't looked it up).  Forget Kobe, Shaq, Karl and the Glove - it's the Horry factor.   Sacto Kings vs Minnesota Timberwolves  - Kings in 4 games.  This will be the Wolves first time out of the first round so I'm expecting a hangover to go deep into the off-season, writing the second round off completely.  OK, maybe they'll win one.   Deloitte Pistons vs New Jersey Nets  - Pistons in 7 games.  This will be the hardest series to call.  The Pistons have been unstoppable defensively and the Nets have the best run'n'gun point guard in the league.  They haven't been so good prior to the playoffs, but they fear nobody.  I'm looking forward to this one!   Indiana Pacers vs Miami Heat  - Pacers in 5 games.  Much as it pains me to say.  Miami have the 3rd best rookie of the year, Dwyane Wade, who is an absolute gun and for family reasons, I'd love to see go all the way.  Not this year though.  The Pacers have managed to stay underneath the radar somewhat all year.  Even with the best regular season record in the NBA people don't view them as a chance as the Pistons improved so much on Feb 20 when they got 'Sheed after his one game at Atlanta.  Pacers in 5, but  go Dwayne !!!   East Finals  - Pacers to beat Pistons in 6, or Nets to beat Pacers in 7.  I dunno!  West Finals  - SA all the way.  Will beat the Kings and shatter my dreams of C-Webb holding the trophy.   NBA Finals  - San Antone.  There endeth the NBA season and over the horizon is the expansion draft and the birth of the  Charlotte Bobcats  - 30th team in the NBA.  but that's for another time.

      Well, it looks like our home building experience will start as of today!!!  Just got word that our finance has been approved so the block of land we offered on at Old Beach here in Hobart will be ours in 30 days time.  the block has brilliant views over the Derwent River.  It's on a bit of a slope (but then again so is the rest of Hobart) so house design is going to be interesting.  I've looked up some designs for pole houses and found one bloke in particular,  urlLink John Koch , who lives in Victoria and has had quite a bit of experience designing and building pole houses.  I've got a CD of John's work coming in the mail sometime soon.    The title to the block does have a covenant though, stating that we must build brick and tile, so I'm going to have some arguing to do with the Titles Office to get that particular condition removed.  Should be do-able according to the local council and the solicitor.  Just a the first of many hoops I'm sure we'll have to jump through.  I can't wait to get started on the actual design.  A good kitchen will be a must (as I'm the head chef!) as will be a studio space for PJ to paint in.  Have had some good ideas thrown in by an archi-mate such as floor to ceiling one-way glass for the toilet.  A view from the throneroom!

      It's funny how when you're shooting some free-throws, you can make a bunch of them until you start counting them.  Then it's all over.  Pretty much anything I can do, I'll do OK at until I start noticing the fact that I'm doing OK at it.  PJ and I are recording our backgammon games at the moment.  We play at least a 3-game series every night over dinner.  We started keeping our log on May 9 (our first wedding anniversary) and since then, she's ahead of me by 20+ games.  Unbelievable.  Prior to this log being kept I could do no wrong.  I'd be rolling double 6's and double 5's at least once a game.  I'd be blocking, evading the rack and setting up my pieces without a care.    Now, I can't take a trick.  We struggle through to the point where the game finally becomes a race to see who can get their pieces in fastest and PJ just breaks out with doubles all over the place.  Very frustrating.  I wish the same rules (i.e. about falling face-first when you count your wins) applied to St Kilda prior to last weekend's footy!  Just a mild rant about a slightly frustrating part of life.

      That's one of basketball commentary's catchcries for Vince Carter, another one is 'Air Canada' - which is what we'll be flying to Vancouver later this year by the looks of things.  Went and booked the tickets this morning.  We were hoping to go with Japan Air Lines and stopover at Tokyo, but all seats were taken.  Didn't realise you had to get in so quickly for these things, but that's an inexperienced traveller for ya.  Anyway, we're booked, and PJ's rellies in Canada are taking care of some arrangements over there for us.    Taking a week through the rockies in a motorhome, driving on the wrong side of the road (yikes!).  I'm also hoping to get down to Seattle as well for some summer league hoops.  Heaps of family to meet and places to see.  Can't wait.  Should be a ripsnorter of a trip.  Just don't think about the dollars, right?  What good is a salary if you don't have something to pay off?

      From an issue of Time Magazine to come out this week,  urlLink via The Age :    A Pentagon email said US Vice-President Dick Cheney coordinated a huge Halliburton government contract for Iraq, Time said today, despite Cheney's denial of interest in the company that he ran until 2000.   The March 5, 2003 email, from an Army Corps of Engineers official, said top Pentagon official Douglas Feith got the job of shepherding the contract, according to advance copies of the newsweekly that hits newsstands tomorrow.   Feith had approved the multibillion-dollar deal "contingent on informing WH (the White House) tomorrow. We anticipate no issues since action has been coordinated w(ith) VP's (vice-president's) office," said the email obtained by Time.   The newsweekly said Halliburton won the contract three days later, although no other bids had been submitted.   Exactly how these hawks manage to sleep at night, I'm not sure.  It maybe that they have others down the food-chain that carry their consciences for them.  Slip this one into the same file as the 'Saddam poses an immediate threat', 'Cheney and Bush give unrecorded testimony together' etc etc files.  Pure mutton, dressing as lamb.  I think they're hoping we all get to the David Ferry stage (from Oliver Stone's JFK) - 'I'm so f***in tired I can't even think straight'.  UPDATE - surprise, surprise part 2 - Cheney has  urlLink denied any involvement  in the deal.  He'd probably deny his own birth if it was revealed his mother was a Democrat.    The "coordinated action" referred to, the senior administration official said, was "that of publicly announcing the contract decision that has already been made."  The heads-up would have been given because of Cheney's previous involvement in the company as chief executive officer, and the anticipated controversy over the noncompetitive bid, the official said.   I  urlLink keep   urlLink reading  about Iraqi professionals, companies and labourers further enraged by the fact that they cannot even participate in the rebuilding of their own country.  The words  'noncompetitive bid'  can't help.

      I swear, if it was safe to do so I'd insist on being paid my salary in cash and then store it under my pillow, just so I could stay away from banks!  I feel like joining a gun club and taking my chances with the burglars rather than paying a cent in fees to those two faced gargoyles.  We're settling on our block of land today, we've bought a building block out at Old Beach, just north of Hobart.  I have my mortgage and a small personal loan with a credit union here.  Due to the new purchase, we're refinancing the mortgage with another provider.  My current mortgage provider, the little credit union, won't release the title documents until both the mortgage and personal loan are paid out - mongrels!  What in the name of tropical fruit does my personal loan have to do with my mortgage.  It's a PERSONAL loan you idiots.  Unsecured!  And so now this pack of anal-retentives has just made a $600 dent in our family holiday plans later this year because they don't understand the terms of their own dealings.  Can I say it loud enough - I HATE BANKS!!  Fee-sucking, customer-munching scumbags.

      The PM has come out to  urlLink assure us all  that he's taking some action on the cases of alleged Taliban wannabe's David Hicks and Mamdouh Habib.  He's made some inquiries.  John Howard, Dubya's man of steel and Australia's man of (in)action.  Ideally, I'd like to see Hicks and Habib brought back to Oz, tried and jailed here, for the rest of their lives - if appropriate.  If they've done wrong, then they deserve to cop the full stick, but they deserve to cop it here, not at the hands of Dubya.  This guy is a false, incompetent, war-hungry and floundering president (small p intentional), and is holding 2 Australian citizens as enemy combatants - a term conveniently made up to suit circumstance - to be tried in what will basically end up a kangaroo court.  Unfortunately, smiley Ruddock has indicated quite clearly that we have no law here that we could try them under.  I agree that making the criminal code retrospective to suit these two is an undesirable precedent.  However there must be something that can be done in order to express Australia's unhappiness with the procedures so far.  Even those who have already made up their minds about H&H should agree that the Australian Government should do everything it can to ensure that it's citizens are treated fairly, and within a transparent system.    British citizens have come out of Gitmo.  The US has accommodated them when pressured by Britain to do so.  Why can't Australia pressure it's "coalition partner" to allow Australian representation, so that we Australians interested in their welfare can be assured that they're getting a real, bona-fide fair trial. Even the military counsel appointed to Hicks has stated that this trial process will be, in essence, a legal joke.    At the moment all I can feel confident in is that these hearings will be convenient pre-election publicity for Dubya.  A display of his action-man status against terrorists.  John Howard should be doing more to ensure the fair treatment of Australia's citizens, even if it means he loses his 'man-of-steel' bathroom privileges when he visits the Whitehouse.

      Some good news to start the weekend off....  One Nation has  urlLink finally swallowed , having pulled its top lip over its head some time ago.  Hasta La Vista, Pauly!  A spammer has been  urlLink sentenced to 7 years !  Spamsational!  Petrol prices could start  urlLink dropping  again, if the OPEC boys do the right thing next week.  Jihad Jack Roche has  urlLink changed his plea to guilty  over the plot to blow up the Isreali embassy.  I wonder if the prison food will be as good as when he had dinner with Osama?  John Kerry has a nice  urlLink crack at Dubya  on his 'National Security Tour'.  Have a good weekend one and all.  I'll be plastering, sanding and booking airline tickets.  Ciao.

      Just catching some of the Lakers/Wolves game on ESPN.   urlLink Michael Olowokandi  has played 5 minutes for 0 points and 3 fouls.  5 minutes and he's back on the pine.    I know he's not the biggest waste of money in the NBA (Tim Thomas, Vin Baker, Shandon Anderson etc etc) but the numbers are enough to make you wince.  Kandi was signed for 5.4 million per season for 3 years.  He took 285 shoots during the regular season.  That's an Xbox game shy of $19,000 per shot for the season.  Seeing he's a crappy shooter, despite being 7ft and 280 pounds, it's actually around $19,500 per point scored.  He played only 43 games, netting $125,000 a game (my house cost $114,000 only 2 years ago).  I would have played for just $18,000 a shot.  UPDATE: Kandi has now played a total of 9 minutes, still has 0 points, but now has 5 fouls.  Money well spent.  As indicated  urlLink here  a few days ago, Kobe's come back from Colorado rejuvinated and ready to play - 27 points for No.8 and there's still a quarter to go.  Mailman's in a good mood to, nearly has a triple-double already.

      Thanks to Osama, Jamie Durie and Paul Clitheroe, Tasmanians have never had it so good.  Tourist numbers are at all time highs, people are doing up their houses in record numbers, and selling them at record prices.  All is rosy, eh?  Tassie has arrested some of the population drain that had us hamstrung for years and is now approaching the 500,000 mark as many of the tourists realise what a brilliant spot to live this island really is.  I know how they feel, I was one of the mainland immigrants myself, back in 1995.  Came here to do 3 years of uni and never left.  So what’s the problem?  Well, for starters, whilst property prices have doubled in the last few years, incomes have risen only modestly in the same period.  The cost of housing has gone through the roof in most areas thanks to a bunch of mainland investors buying off the internet and paying well over top dollar just because the comparative price of a property in Melbourne or Sydney made the Tassie property look like a bargain.  I’m now getting cashed up for the fire sale of over-capitalised properties that will occur starting in around 12 months time as the new landlords realise they can’t get the $250 p.w rents they need to service their loans.  The money simply isn’t here to sustain it.  The public housing shortage is an issue for another post, but let’s just say Housing Tasmania has done pretty well out of the boom too.  The state government has made a nice little political earner out of these improved conditions.  After years of having to squeeze blood from a stone to get any good economic news, the influx of tourism and the building boom has had Premiers Bacon and Lennon riding high on the crest of a wave that was very little of their own making, and will quite possibly see them caught standing like a deer in the headlights when the time comes to actually manage an economy in seasonal decline.  An example: in order to capitalise on the increasing demand to visit Tasmania, the state government made a wise decision and traded in the old ferry for two newer ferries to service the route between Devonport and Melbourne.  These boats have been well received and utilised and the publicity for the government has been extremely positive, and rightly so.  A problem:  they then decided to try and satisfy demand that didn’t exist and purchased a third ferry to run between Devonport and Sydney.  I don’t know who prepared the feasibility study for the $105 million purchase of Spirit III, but I have a feeling he may have been Greek and had an uncle that needed to sell a ship.   urlLink The Mercury  reports today that the government business case for the purchase included a forecast of 115,000 passengers for the year.    Let’s do the numbers.  So far, in the 95 trips made since the service started in January, it is estimated that around 25,000 people have made a trip on Spirit III.   The government has been pressured to admit that Spirit III has averaged ‘less than 400 passengers per trip’.  The actual numbers make it look more like around 265 per trip, but saying less than 400 is, I guess, not inaccurate – it’s just some distance from accurate.  However, lets take the government’s optimistic figure and do some calculations.  If it did transport that many people (400 per trip), we’d be looking at 38,000 passengers, which would represent a 10,000 passenger shortfall compared to government’s original business case of 115,000 annually.  The 25,000 estimated passenger numbers represent a 23,000 passenger shortfall.  The ferry is only carrying barely over 50% of the government’s scenario, and we should mention at this point that the ferry has a capacity to carry 1400 passengers per trip, which means that it’s only been operating at 19% capacity.  Imagine how Paris Hilton would feel if her inheritance hotels were only operating at 19%!  The Melbourne-Devonport run carries some 80,000+ cars per year.  So far, in its first 4.5 months of operation, Spirit III has brought just 6,000 cars into the state.  Is there a picture emerging here?  We have cut-price air travel now.  People who want to take a driving holiday around Tasmania will either fly in for $300 and hire a car or drive to Melbourne and jump on the boat there, which may be quicker than getting on the boat in Sydney anyway, and a shorter time at sea for those who get seasick.  The clincher to the question of Big Red Lennon’s economic management on this issue?  The boat was purchased, not leased.  So now we Taswegians have got to find a way to make it work or the boat may as well be a 2000 tonne anchor around our collective necks.

       urlLink Reports abound  today that the Howard government will legislate to effectively ban gay marraiges in Australia.    Mr Howard said the Marriage Act would be changed to include the commonly accepted definition of a marriage as the voluntarily entered-into union of a man and a woman to exclusion of all others.   There's also a bit in there about laws to stop gay couples adopting kiddies here or overseas.   urlLink Michael Darragh at Living In Australia  seems to think that that particular effort will be easily thwarted.  Maybe, maybe not.  Whatever your stance on this contentious public issue, I think that this is the Prime Minister taking a stance that is once again contrary to public opinion, but true to his conscience.  I've little doubt that Johnny is a conservative Christian type and hence, this legislation comes as little surprise (especially since Dubya mentioned it a few months ago, too).  Line this up with a budget-bribe, determination to continue an unpopular commitment in Iraq, backflips on parliamentary super and travel guidelines and one could see a PM with either a tremendous amount of spine, or in terrible disarray.  Certainly, decisions are not all being taken just to appease the public's pulse as felt in the party room.  Of course, there's still no election announcement yet - at the time of writing, anyway.  Maybe Johnny's trying to get some hard issues out of the way so he can concentrate on the candy prior to the vote.  At least this is one act that Latham won't claim as being stolen from Labor.

      Well, it seems the Orlando Magic have won the NBA Draft Lottery and therefore the right to take first choice in the draft, which will be held later in June.  And whilst its a good thing I suppose, it's not going to be the hum-dinger that was the 2003 Draft class.  (I almost sound like a country and western singer, lamenting the old draft whilst my wife leaves and my dog dies!).  The Magic are tipped to take consensus No.1 pick Emeka Okafor.  Don't know much about him as college ball ain't that easily accessed down here.  But that goes to show how different this year's class is from last year's, though.    As featured in  urlLink Frank Hughes' column  on ESPN, we knew all about LeBron last year as well as a fair bit about Carmelo and his No2 pick sparring partner, Darko (I think I knew more about him then than what I do now - In the dark on Darko).  The fact that I can write about these guys with single names like these folks - 'Madonna', 'Cher', 'Ronaldo' or 'Pele' - and you might know who I'm talking about lends credence to the class of 2003's rookies.  And I haven't mentioned Chris Bosh, Dwyane Wade (go cuz!) Udonis Haslem, Josh Howard or TJ Ford yet.  OK, now I have.  So go Magic, hope you get something good.  Got to be better than last year.  And if you don't, then you can always hope that Grant Hill gets better (ha!) or that the Lakers fire Phil Jackson - Shaq might get as upset as he's predicted, leave L.A and come home.  Other NBA thoughts:  Pleased that Adelman is staying in Sacto - one more year boys!  The Wolves better watch out.  Down 2-1 already and game 4 coincides with Kobe being in court.  He always seems to have a blinder after returning from Colorado.  Must be the altitude or something.  Malone should have been suspended.  Vince Carter should get traded.  To Sacramento.  I'm outta here before more thoughts get less lucid than they already are.

      Chris Albritton is staying near the Australian compound in Baghdad, which had a car bomb explode nearby just a few days ago.  He offers  urlLink this narrative  about the event.  This story just in itself points out the value of Chris' mission in Iraq.  To have someone there on the ground who gets the details, without the corporate media spin, is well worthwhile.  I hope that the work he is doing and the reasons why are appreciated by those around him.  Stay safe, Chris.

      I was perusing the works of the good  urlLink Lord Sedgwick  this afternoon, and a click on one of his links led me to a story on fat film makers.  By this I mean the makers of film, who are themselves overweight, rather than film makers of any description that make films about fat.  Anyway, the link was to a piece of  urlLink chip wrapping from the SMH , in which the author (Padraic P McGuinness) was having a go at Michael Moore winning the Palme D'or at Cannes.  Now, fair enough, use your interest piece on slobby film makers to espouse your politics if you must, but this?!:   There is little doubt that the inspiration for the inexcusable treatment of Iraqi prisoners by American soldiers came from filmmakers like Tarantino and their counterparts in the American pornography business.   I am speechless.  I am without speech.

      Just spotted the new Grizz logo on  urlLink NBA.com .  Clicked on the Grizz site and got  urlLink the full treatment  from the Logo himself, Jerry West, on how the logo is so representative of Memphis etc.   "The new logo is a simple, timeless design that will symbolize winning, tradition and the future of Grizzlies basketball. This logo is unique to Memphis, marrying the tradition of basketball with the history of the city to create a logo that the team, organization and the fans will embrace."   I dunno, Jerry, methinks the only grizzlies in Memphis, perhaps the only grizzlies that have ever roamed in Memphis, are in the  urlLink Memphis Zoo!   The colors look alright, and I'm sure the uni's will too when they come out next month, but if you're going to reinvent you're corporate presence, why not get rid of the name that is so obviously linked to the team's former home in Vancouver.  Other teams have done it, the Bullets, the Royals etc etc.  Perhaps the Memphis Elvises! You could get new rhinestone uniforms and make all the players wear porkchop sideburns!  Hmmm, perhaps  a little less conversation  is in order. (oh, that's sick)

      Not mentioned enough, highly likely in the current climate because they don't have so much oil, is Africa as a player on the world stage.  African nations have endured an historical struggle, internally and externally, with poverty, famine, cultural and literal subjugation as they strive to establish a regional identity beyond that of 'a good place to go for a safari'. The rise of the Middle East as an agressor towards (or respondent to, depending on your outlook) the west made me think of the similarities to be found in Africa.  Mixed religion, lack of resources, perceived exploitation of existing resources etc etc.    Northern Africa has traditionally been a training ground for terrorist activity and as this continent begins to emerge in importance, I think it'd be good for the west to gain a foothold and promote partnerships in the area - true partnerships that will advance the African people and demonstrate the goodwill of the west in doing so.  It's not like there's a shortage of things to help out with.  There's continuing poverty and hunger, AIDS education, public health and hospitals (there has been a new  urlLink Ebola outbreak  in Sudan as recently as this month).    So good luck to the  urlLink Africa Union  as they  urlLink establish a new Peace and Security Council  today.  Hopefully they can establish and promote a unified desire for peace and security in the region and act as a conduit for relations with the rest of the world.

      We had a bye in the local basketball comp last night, so we hired a court for an hour and had a 4-on-4 game amongst ourselves.  At 34 I'm the oldest on the team, the youngest being my 16 year old stepson.  A year ago I'd have my way with him on the court either offensively or defensively, but what a difference a year, some coaching for him and too many Mint Slices for me can make!    The little mongrel (well, not that little, he's at least 6ft 2 now) blocked me twice and managed to drop a few jump shots over my outstretched defense.  I did manage my share of scoring last night too, but the worm is definitely turning.  I predicted around December last year that I had until June 2004 to beat him 1-on-1, after which I'd never beat him again.  Better line that game up pretty soon and take photos to document the occasion.  Either that or start taking my own health and fitness a bit more seriously.  It's tough being happy at seeing your young fella's progress when it's at the expense of your own!

      One of my occasional pastimes is to scan the  urlLink Al Jazeera  website to check out the news as it’s presented to your average Mohammed.  Interesting tidbits from today’s scan:  The fact that an  urlLink Iraqi pipeline was blown up  near Kirkuk had nothing to do with people carrying explosives, trying to blow up a pipeline.  It was the CPA’s fault for not providing enough security.  Tehran has  urlLink warned the US  over its presence in Iraq.  No mention of the potential consequences of this warning and  absolutely  no confirmation that the warning was delivered by  urlLink Ahmed Chalabi .  A story entitled  urlLink 'Abu Ghraib to be demolished’  is all about General Sanchez’s alleged oversight of prisoner abuse.  All-Jazz have taken the opportunity to link two stories, one of which they'd be pleased about and the other they get to rehash, which serves their purposes nicely.   urlLink CNN maintain the party line  that he’s being ‘rotated’.  Perspective is always interesting.  Spin is universal.

      A report on  urlLink ESPN  leads me to predict financial prosperity, yet basketball mediocrity, for some team in the East in the near future.  Problem is, I'm not sure which team.  Michael Jordan is touring the world promoting his Jordan-ness as it appears on clothing and sporting goods.  He said this week from Taipei that owning an NBA team is for him, a priority.  "My mission is to own a team, and I will go through every length to try to obtain that goal", he said. "Until someone's ready to sell a team, I can't steal a team, I can't take a team,  I have to be patient "....Jordan didn't specifically name the teams he is interested in buying, but said most of those he was investigating were on the East Coast. I wonder if the patience he's talking about is like the patience he showed with Kwame Brown.  He took the guy as a No.1 draft pick when he was Chief Exec at the Wizards and then rode him like a cheap donkey for two years, absolutely crushing the kid's confidence.  Kwame was 17!  Imagine at 17, being thrown in at the highest level the sport has to offer, and then getting hounded by the greatest player in the history of the game.  Jordan does have a bit of a record when it comes to being a mongrel to work with.  Anyone interested should get a copy of Sam Smith's book,  The Jordan Rules .  It chronicles Chicago's first championship season back in the early 90's and whilst no-one could ever question MJ's basketball greatness, you definitely come away with the feeling that it'd be better admiring this guy from a distance.  So now Mike wants an eastern team for his own.  Maybe the Cavs.  Old Mike and the new Mike teamed up together.  It'll cost a pretty penny though, Lebron has sent stock in that club through the roof.  The Nets would have been good too, as Mike was born in nearby Brooklyn, where they're due to move to in a few years.  But alas the Nets have just been sold (although adding Mike's name to the owner's register sure would help them with the local real estate problems they're having in trying to build a new stadium in Crooklyn - " Let us demolish your house and we'll bring Mike over to swing the wrecking ball! ").  Philly might be on a downturn in the next few years and therefore maybe ripe for a bargain.  If it happens, you heard it here first.  Hard to imagine him leaving the basketball operations to a hired hand.  Even if he did, who'd really want to work for him - you'd always be looking over your shoulder.  Doubtless someone will take the job though, Mike is a magnet for people and money.  Conference finals predictions: LA Lakers in 6 Indiana in 7  It's all got so ho-hum for me now that Dwyane and Chris are out of the playoffs.

      Dubya's about to get on TV to  urlLink make another speech .  Oh no.  Things are embarrasing enough already without adding fuel to the fire by letting George open his trap in public.  Seems the US's old mate, Chalabi,  urlLink fed them what they wanted to hear  prior to the war in an attempt to build the case against Iraq.  In doing so, it looks like he may have been in cahoots with Iran.  The Iranians must be laughing their heads off if this is true.  They've managed to use their enemy's lust for ousting Saddam as leverage to help them to their own ends.  From The Age:  Ahmed Chalabi, the one-time White House favourite who has been implicated in an alleged Iranian spy operation, sent Iraqi defectors to at least eight Western spy services before the war in an apparent effort to dupe them about Saddam Hussein's illicit weapons programs.  US investigators are now seeking to determine if the effort was secretly supported by Iran's intelligence service to help persuade the Bush Administration to oust the Baghdad regime, Tehran's long-time enemy.  Present and former US intelligence officials said other evidence indicates that Mr Chalabi's long-time intelligence chief gave Iran's Ministry of Intelligence and Security highly classified information on American troop movements, top-secret communications, plans of the US-led Coalition Provisional Authority, and closely guarded material on US operations in Iraq .  If that ain't bad enough, there's a  urlLink smoking gun memo  floating around giving credence to  urlLink Sy Hersh's story  about the Abu Ghraib abuses being known at the top levels of military intelligence.    Hersh contends that Donald Rumsfeld let loose his military intelligence dogs after Sept 11 in a 'special access program' called Copper Green.  This unit had top secret, black-op clearance to get whoever they had to in order to expose Al Quaida back when the War on Terror (TM) was justified.  This unit was recently allowed to operate in Iraqi prisons, their tactics being mirrored in what was seen in the photos from Abu Ghraib.  Now a memo has been exposed that supposedly indicates knowledge that military intelligence operatives had taken over nearly all aspects of the running of Abu Ghraib (and I don't think their area of responsibility was limited to chosing the menu for the inmates).  The head of coalition forces in Iraq, Lieutenant-General Ricardo Sanchez, issued an order last October giving military intelligence control over almost every aspect of prison conditions at Abu Ghraib, with the explicit aim of manipulating the detainees' "emotions and weaknesses ". Don't know about you, but I really think the US has enough on it's plate without letting the Smirking Chimp out of his cage.

      Glad to hear what is old news by now, that Michael Moore  urlLink won the Palme D'Or  at the Cannes Film Festival over the weekend for Farenheit 9/11.  Luckily the award has nothing to do with  Disney .  I first saw Moore on  The Awful Truth  a few years ago and immediately took a bit of a liking to his unique ways of exposing some credibility issues amongst corporate America.  A particular favourite was when he took a choir of throat cancer sufferers, complete with electronic voice boxes, to sing Christmas carols in the head office of one of the big tobacco companies.  Sometimes I think he hits some cheap targets, but he was pretty much on the money with  Bowling for Columbine  and I'm looking forward to seeing Farenheit.  The RWDB blogs are having their usual Moore hitout, although perhaps a bit quieter that normal.  Yobbo was actually complimentary to Moore in one section of  urlLink his post , but then fell into line and called him dickhead.  urlLink Paul and Carl  revert to their usual name-calling,  urlLink Slatts  is silent and Blair, as usual, calls Moore a liar (firing another blank from a very big gun) and  urlLink finds a small incident and makes it a focal point  in another pointless piece of tripe.  A small further note on Blair - in  urlLink one post , he has a crack at Nick Berg's father, who is negative towards the war in Iraq.   Michael Berg:    I am sure that the one who wielded the knife felt Nick's breath on his hand and knew that he had a real human being there. I am sure that the others looked into my son's eyes and got at least a glimmer of what the rest of the world sees. And I am sure that these murderers, for just a brief moment, did not like what they were doing.   George Bush never looked into my son's eyes .  Tim Blair:    He never carved your son’s head off, either.   I think he has the right to an opinion on the issue, Tim.  What you wrote was real sensitive, eh?    Tim's next post is entitled  urlLink 'Symptoms of a Sick Society' .  Enough Said.  Shut your piehole, Tim.  UPDATE: My apologies to Yobbo, mentioned earlier in the piece.  The article on Yobbo's site was actually written by his co-blogger, Chris V.  Cheers.

      Traded the PS2 for an Xbox.  That got the kids out of our bedroom, where our new PC had become very popular after the demise of the PS2.  Strategic move.  Also bought a new bed.  We've had our matress on the floor for the last 12 months, so it was nice to blow the payrise/tax cheque on something useful instead of just paying bills.  Got a fantastic timber piece from Robert Latham here in Hobart, with a nice cash/floorstock discount to boot!  Priced some airfares for our trip to Cananada later in the year.  There's some substantial price differences out there.  From JAL and Singapore airlines at around $2200 to East China Air and China Air at $1560 and $1800 respectively.  How can they charge so much lower and still get us to the same place safely?  Hmmmm.  Methinks maintenance might be a lesser priority.  Air Pacific is looking good at around $2100.  The final decision will be between Air Pacific with a stopover in Honolulu and JAL with a stopover in Tokyo.  Also got to play some soccer with Stu, Bon, Janey and little Mitchy.  Made some chocolate muffins, did a gig down at Bes Mudi (a restaurant here in Hobart).  Whew - a good weekend indeed.

      Lots of stuff going around about the Oz elections, especially how Peter Costello won't get to smirk his way through this one as Little Johnny is going for the record.  Pete's really stuck between a rock and a hard place.  It's highly likely that his financial oversight and loyalty have been amongst the underpinning strengths of Johnny's PMship.  Yet he may not get a chance at the golden ring himself.   urlLink Lord Sedgwick  has a wonderful piece of photoshop work showing how Johnny looks when he doffs the pinstipe suit.  True enough, like Kylie Mole, if Johnny gets his way he'll go, he'll go....well, he'll just go.  And unfortunately for the treasurer, he may not stop.  Truth is, Johnny could go on as PM so long that we'd become waaaaaaaaay too exposed to Costello's smirks and quips to trust him as PM (we're only waaay too exposed at the moment).  Personally I'm not sure I'd trust him to walk my dog.   urlLink Crikey  is punting on an August 7 election.  Not necessarily an august prediction given the reasons noted - we are a sporting public.  John Howard is going to set the election date according to the best timing for his party.  He's waiting for the budget bounce, which should coincide with all those eligible swinging voters, er, families getting their $600 cheques.  He won't leave it too late though.  The Olympics and footy finals will distract too much, and as he's behind a little in the polls, he does need to get the electorate's attention a bit.    He also doesn't want any blowback from the American elections later this year.  The Australian public, whether it be through the spread of the internet or the war in Iraq, seems to have in general, a greater awareness of US politics, and wariness of the implications US policies will have for us domestically.  War commitments, FTAs - soon Dubya'll be enlisting our help for his public speaking problems (a task for which even we are too under-resourced).    John W has unquestionaly tied himself to George W, which is good for him in a way as it makes him look sort of, well, statesmanlike.  He may be an idiot, but Dubya's the idiot IN CHARGE.  The problem for Johnny is that as George goes, so will Johnny to an extent, but without the mega-millions in advertising to sell himself or  urlLink computerised voting  to bring home the bacon (watch that issue grow around November/December this year!).  Polls and commonsense are indicating that George is going south, and I don't mean to Crawford, Texas.  If you sleep with dogs, chances are you wake up with fleas.  All this pontificating does raise the question again as to why we don't have fixed election terms.  Tim Dunlop addresses the issue pretty well  urlLink here .  Come on Johnny, take the game out of it.  Doesn't part of your manhood want to take the taxi-basher on  mano-a-mano ?  No element of surprise, just you and Marky Mark in a steel cage with nothing seperating you but a ballot box.  Gough Whitlam handling the spit bucket in one corner and a picture of Menzies for you to spit on in the other.  Okay, maybe that wouldn't work.    If there's one thing we deputies can learn from the big Sheriff, it's fixed election periods.  Everyone then gets to dance to the same tune.  Peter Costello can order a painter in for his portrait (then put it in the shed again, with all the others).  Iron Mark can give the rabbits in the cellar a specific time period to get his tax policy ready.  As a public, our cynicism can be dialled up in the 6 months prior, as all the pre-election lollipops are offered from Canberra.    See, it works for everyone.

      Found myself surprisingly awake at 4.30 this morning, so I turned on the tube.  To my pleasant surprise, there was a friendly on between Brazil and France.  The game was being played at Stade-de-Ponce in Paris to celebrate FIFA's 100 years of screwing Australia out of the world cup finals (as if we'd do any good anyway).  Now, I only get interested in soccer for the big tourneys.  World Cup and Euro.  Nothing much else about soccer really gets me going.  But this one had the makings of a pretty good game.  Both teams are choc-full of creative talent and both seemed to have their best players in.  Brazil had Ronaldo, Ronaldinho, Ronhaldinhodaldo and Rinhodinaldho, amongst others.  France had Thierry Henry, Zinadine Zidane, Pepe le Pew and David Trezuget.    This could be alright, I thought.  Wrong.    Bloody soccer.  Rarely fails to disappoint you.  These are the two best teams in the world, the most creative players, dangerous strikers, all with surprisingly conservative hairstyles.  So what did this game give all the early morning watchers?  A   nil-all   draw.  The game's been over for several hours now and a check of the  urlLink FIFA website  reveals no game report, not even an official score.  THEY can't even be bothered to write about it.  I am once again convinced that  urlLink Australian Rules Football  is the official sport of heaven.

      Reports today of the  urlLink US killing up to 40 people  in western Iraq.  As usual, there are two polarised points of view on the incident.  The Americans have come out to say they pinned down 40 foreign fighters in house, took some gunfire and returned with same, assisting said 40 foreign fighters in shuffling off their mortal coils.  They said Syrian passports were found along with wads of cash and satellite communications equipment.  This certainly appears somewhat damning for those summarily snuffed, although I guess they  could  have been wealthy Syrians attending a wedding, who wanted to beam some pictures of the happy occasion back home.  A local, quoted on Al-Arabiya television says they were all wedding guests and most were women and children. I don't necessarily want to appear this cynical, but why is it that its  always  mostly women and children killed?  Whenever I see pictures from the middle east on TV, its always men running all over the place, in large groups, jumping, pointing, shouting.  Why is it that these soldiers, helicopters, smart bombs or whatever else  always  miss these large groups of men and hit just women and children?  The locals also claimed that there may have been gunfire from the wedding as it's a traditional Iraqi thing to fire off a bunch of rounds from your kalishnakov in celebration.  Why?  Really, why?  Let's explore just a few reasons that the Iraqi's might want to put a stop to this practice, at least for a while.  a) it must scare the women and children.  I mean, they must be jumpy enough already with these consistently inaccurate infidels all over the place.  Surely a wedding must be a time where they can just relax and enjoy things a little.  And of course, it's the  men  doing the shooting isn't it!  b) how much of a tradition can it be?  We're talking about the 'cradle of civilisation' here, remember?  These people have lived in this country for tens of generations, but now it's some deep seeded custom to fire automatics off at wedding?!  Wasn't there a safer custom before automatic weapons were around?  Here's a hint for anyone from Iraq who may ever stumble accross this blog - despite Dubya's incessantly stupid 'Mission Accomplished' stunt, your country is still a  war zone .  There's jumpy Americans all over the place, so large groups of gunfire, when a 'whooppee!' would actually suffice,  are not advised .  It makes them anxious, which just puts your women and children at more risk because these Yanks couldn't drive one of their SUVs into the side of a barn, much less target a 10ft square of ranting men with weapons.  Sheesh.  I'm not normally this blase about tragedies, but Tony Randall died the other day and he always made me so happy, so even in the event of death(s) I'm trying to look at the funny side as I dish out my 'father knows best' 20 cents worth.

      G'day,  Just finished the drive from Launceston to Hobart, and am greatly saddened by the demise of the Sacramento Kings.  Seems KG proved himself to be the big ticket after all, shooting 32 and getting 21 boards whilst holding my boys to just 80 points for a 3-point win, and  ergo  a series against the Lakers to decide who becomes NBA champs (what, that pesky Eastern Conference thing, fuggeddaboudit!).  Can't say enough about how disappointing this outcome is.  The Kings were tops all season but had trouble gelling when C-Webb came back, coinciding with the injury to Bobby Jackson.  Hopefully they can keep the playing group somewhat intact, get some more help off the bench and back up again next year.  Too dosappointed to write more.  Hate to say it, but the Lake show may go all the way.  Oh, and before I forget, there's a new Australian Standard pertaining to bridge building, AS5100-2004.  Now you know.

      Well done lads.  The Miyyami Heat bowed out of the NBA playoffs earlier today, losing a defensive game 6 to the Indiana Pacers, and thereby popping their thongs at the tune of 4 games to 2.  Cast your mind back 9 months and the Heat were meant to go Nowhere.  Not even that far.  Pat Riley, who I believe is solely responsible for the high price of oil around the world, stood down as coach just 4 days before the season started.  They had an untried, although promising rookie, a recruit from the west coast with a drug history, and a core of undersized vets.  They were also getting over the loss of favourite son, 'Zo Mourning, to the Nets.  Start the season - 0-7.  That's pretty close to Nowhere.  Fast forward to All-Star - 25-36.  Better.  But not playoff bound.   That's wins in the first column and losses in the second.  They were 11 games under 50% with more than half the season gone.  The Heat found some character and managed to put together 18 home wins in a row prior to today's loss.  Enough to get them the 4th seed in the playoffs, a series win over N'Orleans and a hell of a lot of respect against the Pacers.  And they became one of the critics' favourites to watch as they ran the floor and just chased the playoff dream with hearts bigger than Phar Lap (an Aussie-ism).  Lamar Odom kicked the weed in favour of some serious home cookin.  Dwyane Wade filled stadiums with awe, hope and promise.  I even read Ralph Wiley on ESPN saying he might be an equal no.2 choice now with Melo.  Maybe more promise for the future, given that maybe Melo has a higher possibility of adding pounds, but not speed or strength.  My boy D-Wade is all pure athlete.  Kudos to the Heat.  Here's hoping they recruit even better this off-season, get a BIG man in the middle and take it a step further next season.  AND HERE'S HOPING that every Sacramento player on the floor gets into KG during game 7 to let him know that the MVP took 2 shots and backed off one of their bench players.  Gotta stand up sometimes.  Shake him down boys, then off to LA LA Land.  Giddyup!!!  GO KINGS

      Once again, the AFL has  urlLink overlooked  perhaps the greatest player of the modern era in its annual hall of fame nominations - the mercurial Gary Ablett.  Gazza was first eligible for the HOF in 2001 and every year since, he has been nominated by the Geelong Football Club.  Every year the AFL has turned his nomination down.  I remember jokes abounding years ago about God running around heaven, pretending to try and play like Gary Ablett.  He was without doubt one of the most exciting players ever to slap on a pair of boots and take the field in anger.  He carried the Geelong footy club on his back for nearly 10 years and brought thousands of people to games every week, pouring THOUSANDS of dollars into AFL coffers for years.  His goal sense was unbelievable.  His ability to get the ball in the midst of a contest was uncanny.  He was one of the few players who could get a whole crowd excited (regardless of their allegiance) just by being near the ball.  Gary's had some hard times, well publicised by the media, and not needing to be rehashed here.  But surely the HOF is about honoring the best footballers in the business.  How many of the blokes in there already have some skeletons in the closet that we never knew about?  Gary's baggage only got so much press because he was so loved, and in the modern era, so scrutinised.  And so now the AFL has declared itself moral judge on the character of it's constituents.  They should stick to administering footy, and let a panel of footballers vote on the nominees each year.  Gazza'd be in in a flash.  My suggestion - email the goats at  urlLink AFL  headquarters and let them know what you think.  Thank goodness we have Junior around for next 10-15 years to keep us entertained.  UPDATE:  My attempts to email via the AFL website were thwarted by the excellent Telstra technical service provided on the AFL page - i.e. the contact link kept falling over.  I'm sure if you email the  urlLink Geelong Footy Club  direct, they'd be glad to pass your thoughts on to the Commish.  SECOND THOUGHT - Further to watching Talking Footy last night, I'd just like to add that Steve Price is a Muppet.  A sad small caricature of real life.  A bonce, a buffoon and about as authoritative on footy as a pink hankie.  Get off my screen.

      OK, I know it's french, not italian.  Big deal.  What   is   a big deal is the latest Italian police car, kindly donated by the generous Helmuts at Volkswagen, owners of Lamborghini.  The Italian plod  urlLink now has a racy new Lambo Gallardo  to use on the highways for emergencies, such as high speed pursuit, organ transplant delivery, pizza delivery, and when that Luigi guy in his pissant Alfa tries to drag them at the lights.  Down here in Hobart I've seen a police Saab, police Mini and a police BMW.  I think they'd gladly trade all three (which were short term donations by dealerships - free advertising) for an afternoon doing the sprint from Launnie to Hobart in 40 minutes!!

      Damn shame to see the Spurs fold to the Lakers in 6 games.  Don't know what it is about Phil Jackson's teams - they always seem to turn up with their gameface on when it counts.  My boys, the Sacramento Kings, were facing elimination today against Minnesota, but managed to  urlLink dominate the Wolves  to force game 7 in Minny.  Now it's time to finish of these pretenders and set up the dream Western Conference finals series against the Lakers.  L.A. beat Sacramento in a 7 game series a few years ago, which was marred by some shocking referree calls.  Sacto have all the incentive in the world now to beat Minny and have a shot at putting the Lakers to the sword.  This is the stuff that basketball rivalry dreams are made of.  Beating the Lakers with their 4 hall-of-famers.    That'd be almost as good as beating Collingwood in a grand final by a point.  Almost.

      We sat down for our annual feast of European songs last night on SBS with the Eurovision song contest.  Unfortunately, we missed the first hour, which included the lion's share of the performances.  We got to see from the Belgians onwards, which suited PJ just fine, as she was born in Belgium.  That left us with only 8 of the 24 entries to view.  Of the 8 we saw, the Turks were definitely the best, even though I can understand the Greek guy beating them out for 3rd place - he had the Ricky Martin factor.  The Ukranians topped the poll, with what Des Mangan (more on him in a moment) reminded us several times was the highest vote count in the history of Eurovision.  This was perhaps pushed on by the fact that there were 36 countries voting, the most in the 49 years of the contest.  Do the maths, Des.  There were 24 performances in the final, but 36 competing countries (some eliminated in a semi final a few days before).  I wish I'd seen the entire show.  It looked like the usual smorgasboard of decent songs sung by half-good singers (the Ireland entry), bad songs sung by really substandard singers (the Russian entry) and good songs sung by really good singers (The Turks).  Of course, as usual the winner was the best performer of a half-decent song, and after seeing the performance, I'm not too surprised the Ukranians won it.  Pretty energetic song and a good stage performance.  Ruslana wanted the performance  urlLink to help us all forget  about some of the Ukraine's more sombre moments: "I would like you to forget about Chernobyl," she said, referring to the 1986 nuclear accident that has long marred Ukraine's image. I'm sure all the locals in Chernobyl had three arms raised in triumph when she won.  Now if you're an Aussie, the presentation of Eurovision is half about the performers and half about the commentary, traditionally presented to our screens by Terry Wogan.  I assume it's cheaper just to take the pictures and sound and provide you're own commentary, so SBS bought in cult-movie presenter Des Mangan to provide the colour.  From the limited amount I saw, I've got to say I was impressed by Des.  Particularly his line about the Icelandic performer (Jonsi) being called 'Jonesy'.  But....well....he's not Terry Wogan and listening to the Eurovision song contest without Terry Wogan is a bit like listening to an AFL grand final with Eddie Maguire calling it, when you know that Bruce McAveny could be calling it instead.  It sucks.

      My 16 year old plays in an under-18s basketball competition.  It's a good league, structured to actually teach the guys the game properly, rather than the old hacks league I play in.  These guys have coaches, training, learn the fundamentals of the game, including sportsmanship.  Last Thursday, we went along to watch the game.   It all came down to the last posession.  The Gunners (our guys) were down by 1 point and the clock was to start with only 1 second to go.  The inbound pass from the baseline came to one of our guys who, amazingly, made a shot from half court!  We all rose as one and cheered our socks off for the kid.  An amazing shot to win the game.  Nobody heard the buzzer go off as we were all cheering so loudly.  Except the opposition coach.  She must have heard it go off as she was on her feet, straight to the refs, claiming a clock malfunction or something, and she convinced them!!  They agreed to run the play again and of course, our guys couldn't get another shot to go.  She must be pleased with herself.  The shot was well and truly within time, and yet she chose to deliberately argue the point and thereby rob a kid of the memory of making a dream shot to win a game.  Her players never blinked.  They'd played courageously the whole game to fight their way into the lead and I don't think either team would have begrudged the other a win prior to the coach going off her nut.  None of them argued about the shot being in on time - because it WAS!  But she chose to give her guys an object lesson in poor sportsmanship by her actions.  How many of us have memories of sporting highs like that one.  One point in your sporting life that you can hang your hat on and say 'I did it!'.  They don't come along often, but they do come to all of us eventually.  They shouldn't be robbed by someone not even on the floor!  Can you get a shot off in 1 second?  But of course.  Just ask Derek Fisher of the LA Lakers.  Fish got a shot off yesterday with 0.4 of a second remaining to beat the Spurs in game 5 of their 7 game series.  And you heard it predicted  urlLink here  first!  Not that I can brag too much as I also predicted the Pistons to hold on against the Nets, but as I type, the Nets look like they might upset Detroit at home, leading 97-94 in OT.  (Chauncey Billups made a 43-footer to tie the game - I bet Lawrence Frank didn't dispute it!!)

      Did anyone else see the film of Paul Wolfowitz  urlLink being questioned  by Senate Armed Services Committee yesterday?  Talk about having a good old squirm!  Reminded me of the film earlier in the week where dormer Aussie diplomat William Brown  urlLink was convicted  and sentenced in Bali.  The pictures of Wolfie, determined to look away from his questioner, hoping for the ground to swallow him up, looked exactly like the frustration showed by Brown as he pumped his fists and yelled 'Bastards' at the court.  I think Wolfie would have liked to do the same thing.   A satisfying, if small, case of the chickens coming home to roost.  On other Iraqi thoughts, who exactly IS calling the shots over there at the moment?  The other day we have the Smirking Chimp in Chief being  urlLink quite resolute , as Presidents should be after one of their citizens are brutally killed as Nick Berg was.   "Their intention is to shake our will," Bush said. "Their intention is to shake our confidence," he said. "Yet by their actions they remind us of how desperately parts of the world need free societies. ... We will complete our mission, we will complete our mission."  OK, fair enough, standard stuff from Dubya.  But then, around 24 hours later, we have  urlLink Paul Bremer and Rummy  saying that they might pull up stumps and this mission could be a failure.  Pope Paul:  "If the provisional government asks us to leave we will leave," he said, referring to a post-June 30 administration after the handover of sovereignty. "I don't think that will happen but obviously we don't stay in countries where we're not welcome,"    The Don:  Speaking ahead of his surprise visit to Iraq on Thursday, Mr Rumsfeld said on the transfer of authority: "Will it happen right on time? I think so. I hope so. Will it be perfect? No ... Is it possible it won't work? Yes."     So who exactly is writing the script and running the show?

      Well, the final instalment of my most influential CDs is in.  You may recall at an earlier post, I alluded to the fact that I couldn't restrict this to a top 5, which it initially was supposed to be.  From 5 to 2, here are the previous 4 influential CDs in my lifetime:  5.  urlLink Born in the USA  - Bruce Springsteen 4.  urlLink Apocalypse 91  - Public Enemy 3.  urlLink Blood Sugar Sex Majik  - Red Hot Chili Peppers 2.  urlLink OK Computer  - Radiohead  So, time for Number 1.  Or Number 1's as the case will be.  Let's call them 1a and 1b.    1a. Batman Soundtrack - Prince   I was inclined to put one of Prince's other albums here, but in the end, I had to go with Batman, even though like Springteen at No 5, it doesn't get a listen anymore. So why at No 1 then?  I loved the Batman movies, the first 2 (directed by Tim Burton) at least.  Having enjoyed the first movie so much, I decided to check out the soundtrack.  The song that converted me to Princedom was Batdance, the 'overture' for the movie.  I grew up knowing this guy Damien, who was a huge Prince fan right through the 80s.  Playing guitar myself, I was big fan of Van Halen and all the guitar-hero type bands and I used to stir Damien about how poofy Prince was etc etc.  All the usual sort of garb spouted by a teenager that didn't bother to actually check the guy out, just went on the image (which was, and continues to be, shall we say, arty).  All that changed when I heard 'Batdance' and the rest of the album.  I was starting to gain an appreciation for musical forms other than heavy stuff at the time, and I think this album came to me just at the right time.  When I got hold of this album, Batdance gave me the guitar chops I needed to hear, and the rest of the album opened my ears to the R&B/funk sound that I hadn't experienced before.  As usual, enjoying this first-time experience led me to snap up all I could from the Artist, and I was rarely disappointed.  Prince can play.  He is a guitarist amongst the best I've ever heard.  Not just speedy licks and tricks like on Batdance, but tasty melody-stye stuff as well.  Yeah, he is wierd, but Prince is a musician's musician.  He's written more hit songs than I can list here, plays incredible bass, keys and percussion, and if you're into vocals, his falsetto and harmonies are just unbelievable.  My affinity for Prince's music continues - I bought his latest, Musicology, last weekend.  I've purchased some of his wierder stuff as well, like Exodus, which wasn't officially a Prince release due to his contractual situation with Sony at the time.  Instead it was released as an album by Prince's band - the NPG.  I also have his Rave Unto the Year 2000 Concert video, which is whole lot better than I thought it might be, and features guest spots from Lenny Kravitz and others.  Prince allowed me to explore music in a new way; to challenge my own perceptions of what songwriting and music are.  His work confronted my identity as an Australian male and allowed ideas into my thought processes that wouldn't have become so prevalent except for that exposure.  The concept of intamacy expressed in music, for example.  Maybe for you, that's old news, but for me at the time, it was pretty revolutionary.    And as I write this I'm thinking maybe that's why his first band was called The Revolution.     1b. Couldn't Stand the Weather - Stevie Ray Vaughan   I first heard Scuttlebuttin on Channel Nine's Wide World Of Sports program back in the 80's.  I just thought WOW!, who is that playing?  Never really had the resources to check it out back then (were talking seriously pre-internet here).    A mate at school, David Watson, allowed me to borrow a few of his tapes.  There was a tape amongst them called 'Couldn't Stand The Weather' and you could imagine my delight as I slotted it into the tape deck to find the same tune I'd heard on Nine a few years before.  As if that wasn't enough, the rest of the album just blew my mind.  Stevie Ray Vaughan was a musician, who like very few at any given time, can both define and redefine a genre of music within his tragically short career.  Stevie was a blues guitarist like very few others past or present.  Powerful driving blues music, or incredibly sensitive ballads.  Grooves.  Riffs.  Howling vocals.  Stunning solos.  Stevie could do it all, and after he was done he'd wink, tip his hat, and just wait for the next cat to come in and play.  If you've never heard him, check out his rendition of Little Wing, or Riviera Paradise.  Look up Stang's Swang, Voodoo Chile and his signature classic - Lenny.  What you'll hear are the most incredible set of fingers playing the world's best electric guitar at the highest level ever achieved.  My tip: turn off the lights, lay down and play Riviera Paradise.  The song will blow you away.  Stevie Ray Vaughan died in a helicopter crash after a gig in Colorado.  I remember the morning, waking up to the news on JJJ.  I nearly didn't go to work that day.  I did in the end, but I took all my SRV tapes and hooked them into the phone system, so that everyone that called Telecom's Coburg office that day got SRV whilst they were waiting on hold.    Thanks for lending me that tape, Dave.  My 16 year old stepson now has a huge poster of Stevie in his bedroom.  I think we were around 16 at the time you lent me the tape all those years ago....

      Well, I clearly laid it on the line with  urlLink this post .  $600 and my vote in the next Oz election could be had.  No bones about it, no pesky ideologies to be considered.  It was love for sale.    Moneybags Costello chose to throw plenty of cash around, but none of it to me, stuck as I am in the no-mans-land of earning a little too much, but not quite enough.  I truly am middle class.  So, on Wednesday I threw down the gauntlet, suffered the humiliation of exposing my own greed for some green:  So that's why I'm placing my vote on the market. Starting price - $600. I'm not necessarily even after the full $1200 that Pete and Johnny are willing to part with. $600 to start and we'll see how we go. Manboobs-Mark. Bobby Brown. Heck, even Andrew 'The Cure' Bartlett. My inbox is waiting for your offers to fill my coffers .  What do I get in return?  Storybooks for the kiddies but NO BLOODY TAX POLICY!!  Did no-one tell the leader of the Opposition that he's the alternative Prime Minister?  Did no-one tell him that last night, his right of reply on the budget, was his BIG chance to pony up and declare his hand?    People were watching, Mark!  It was televised and broadcast on the radio!  People had gotten to like you a little.  The Aussie larrikin streak.  The 60 Minutes story with the manboobs and you playing with the kids, taking them to the track for a punt.  Lot of potential for growth in the electorate, Mark.  We need some substance from you, but there's lots of potential there.    And so what do you come along and tell us?  You don't have a tax policy yet!  Is there anyone working at Labor HQ?  There are people out in the community with economics degrees, Mark!  Surely one of them would be good enough to spend a few weeks, locked up with a thermos and a calculator, so they could do the sums for you.    48 hours isn't enought time?!?!  It wasn't like Pistol Pete sprung the timing of the budget upon you, is it?  I mean we all new it was coming.  There must be Parliamentary tea towel or something that gets issued every year with important dates on it.  Surely if you knew it was coming too, you'd realise there was an expectation that you'd reply, with something that would propose a viable alternative to the love-in Ol' Smiley dished out the other day.  Hint:  You   can   start working on your reply   before   the Treasurer offers his wallet to the nation.  The ladder of opportunity?  I think you just walked under it, Mark.  I think you just walked under it, stepped on Andy Bartlett's black cat and busted a few mirrors on the way.  Now, where's Bobby Brown's phone number?

      Ah, I remember teaching Shaq a thing or two about de-fence all those years ago.  Big Diesel ended up with 'Spalding' imprinted on his head from the dunkalicious schoolin he was getting courtesy of the Swadedaddy.  OK, not true.  But whether-he-likes-it-or-not cousin of mine,  Dwyane Wade  of the Miami Heat DID manage to slice through the lane in Game 3 vs Indiana and dunk it right on the head of MVP aspirant Jermaine O'Neal.  Get on to the  urlLink NBA  or  urlLink ESPN  websites and get a look at the dunk.  Ooooooo-eeei!  Miami have held their solid home court record intact and levelled the series with the Pacers at 2-2.  The trouble for the Heat now is to win one on the road.  Game 4 held some promising signs as Jamaal Tinsley was tech-ed out of the building and Ron Artest snuck back in time for a 2002-style flagrant foul on my cuz.  Maybe the Pacers are starting to show some cracks.  In the other game today my Western conference boys the Sacramento Kings held together, with a 28 point show by C-Webb, to win at Arco and tie their series with Minnesota at 2-2 as well.  All the 2nd round series' are tied at 2-2 at present.  With the exception of the Kings/Wolves series, every team in the 2nd round has won their home games.  I'm predicting that there'll be a few upsets in Game 5 of each series as some underrated lower seeds look to take some initiative in what is essentially now a best of 3 series for all concerned.  Sac to win in Minny. Miami to win in Indy Lakers to win in San Antonio Detroit to hold court against the Nets.  Go Kings and Go Go Go Dwyane Wade - do the family proud son!!

      From the Odd Spot in Melbourne's  urlLink Age  newspaper:  A Paris policeman, pulled over after a car chase, was wearing only a pair of fishnet tights. He faces a trial for drink-driving and prosecutors say he has admitted being a part-time prostitute .  Imagine if Pierre was the arresting officer in  urlLink this case , from News Ltd's web service:  A COURT in the emirate of Dubai has jailed a 26-year-old Indian for a year after he was caught breaking into a house wearing only shoes and a backpack, a newspaper reported.  Police saw the naked man, identified only as A.T. scaling a wall of a villa in an exclusive area on October 13, Gulf News said .

      The story continues.  The countdown of the most influential CDs in my life.  Previously:  urlLink No.5 - Born in the USA - Bruce Springsteen   urlLink No.4 - Apocalypse 91 - Public Enemy   urlLink No.3 - Blood Sugar Sex Majik - Red Hot Chili Peppers   Today:    2. OK Computer - Radiohead    The sonic wonder of this album is an absolute feast for the ears.  Before I got this album I didn’t know that music could be this innovative and inspiring.  And what’s more it was one of those delightful albums that doesn’t hit you with a sledgehammer to get your attention.  It was a true sleeper in my life, allowing me to come to it rather than trying to woo my ear with promises it couldn’t deliver.  An album of pure musical integrity.    I got the CD as a birthday present in March 98 and I don’t think I  really  got into it until mid 99 at the earliest.  The effects, the amazing things that these guys can do with guitars, the power of Thom Yorke’s vocals.  The haunting mystery of ‘Karma Police’ and the power of ‘Electioneering’.  An album just so full of emotion and incredible musicianship and creativity.  This album, for me, spawned an interest in other in bands that wouldn’t have arisen if I’d never heard it.  Bands like The Verve and Coldplay. I've also picked up Radiohead's other work, which is is just as incredible (with the possible exception of  Pablo Honey  - which hasn't grown on me yet).   This whole Radiohead experience also provided a common platform during an important period of my life, sharing this incredible band with bandmates of my own during the development of our musical sound.  Unfortunately, two of those bandmates made the pilgrimage to Melbourne in April to see Radiohead's second show, only to have it cancelled on the day, due to Thom Yorke falling sick.  He wasn't the only one spewing, I reckon!

      If you've never seen it before, jump on to Chris Allbritton's website,  urlLink Back to Iraq .  Chris is a freelance journalist, who has been soliciting donations to get back to Iraq to do his job from there.  Well, today's the day, he's off to the Middle East and will be regularly posting his observations on his weblog, as well as articles that don't get picked up by major publications.  A courageous, considerate and professional journo, who is hopefully taking all the required precautions and more in order to live in relative safety and report happenings over there.  Travel safely, Chris.

      Treasurer Peter Costello jumped in for his 9th (and 'best ever') budget last night, a financial love-fest that even ended with a command from 'Ol Smiley to go home and get into some horizontal folk dancing as part of your patriotic duty to Australia.  I've got to admit, I'm pretty much convinced (along with most) that the whole exercise was a big lube job prior to an election to be called quite soon.  Tim Dunlop has a pretty good piece  urlLink here  about the Government's discretion as to when elections are called.  Can't disagree with the notion that fixed election periods would take some of the gamesmanship out of things.  Money-bags Costello is going to dole out $600 cheques to around 2 million families, as well as another $600 down the track.  That's $1200 a vote for those folks.  Cheap!  As I earn a little too much to qualify for FTA (or don't want Centrelink probing every hair on my butt before they pay me the 20 cents I might be entitled to) and not quite enough to benefit from the bracket creep adjustments, action must be taken.  Don't get me wrong, I don't think it was a bad budget last night.  As long as I don't get hit by an interest rate hike, and as long as I'm not overrun in the local mall by 16 year olds and their new $5,000 babies, I think I can cope with the whole thing and focus on the benefits that many needy groups will get, well overdue for some of them.  But facts are facts, there's nothing coming my way from this document.  Nix, Nada, Zero.  But there's plenty of cash being thrown around and dammit, and I want some.  $4 billion, that's BILLION, over the next 7 weeks and there ain't a 50 in there somewhere for me?  So that's why I'm placing my vote on the market.  Starting price - $600.  I'm not necessarily even after the full $1200 that Pete and Johnny are willing to part with.  $600 to start and we'll see how we go.  Manboobs-Mark.  Bobby Brown.  Heck, even Andrew 'The Cure' Bartlett.  My inbox is waiting for your offers to fill my coffers.

      The continuing saga of the 5 most influential CDs in my life.  At no5 was  urlLink Bruce Springsteen - Born in the USA  At no4 was  urlLink Public Enemy - Apocaplypse 91     3. Red Hot Chili Peppers - Blood Sugar Sex Majik   The Chili's were so much fun.  The music was so energetic and I just drank it in, even if  Keidis' vocals irritated me sometimes - I don't think he really carries a slower song that well.  But let's face it, the Chili's music ain't so much about the lyrics as it is about the band.  Not for me anyway.    To me the Chili's will always be about Flea's bass playing and John Frusciante's guitars.  At first I thought it was all about Flea.  Sort of how I thought Guns and Roses was all about Slash and Axl, then when Izzy left their songwriting went with him.  Same with the Chili's.  When Frusciate left for a while (One Hot Minute) things just seemed to go downhill a bit, and no matter how good Flea's slapping and popping was - you can't beat a bunch of great songs with a bunch of sub-standards, no matter who plays them.  And Blood Sugar was an album just chock full of great songs.  'Give it away' was actually the first RHCP song I ever heard, even thought they'd been around for yonks beforehand.  I loved it.  Got hold of the CD single, which had some remixes on it that were really cool as well.  But after I heard 'Suck My Kiss' I was sold.  I went and got everything I could get my hands on.  'My Lovely Man', 'The Power of Equality', 'Greeting Song' etc etc, all pretty much defined what I listened to for the first few years of the 90s as I got into more RHCP, Fishbone, Nirvana etc.  It was a great time in music, and for me it all started with the Chili Peppers and Blood Sugar Sex Majik.

      Tim confines  urlLink his budget analysis  pretty much to a criticism of someone else's analysis (which, it's noted, is pretty much all I'm doing as well at this point), including this wonderful offering: I hate this kind of reporting, which ignores existing tax rates under which the tragic childless sub-$50,000 earners pay tax at a lower rate than those earning more. The fact that this rate isn’t further reduced means, according to Burton, that they get “nothing”. Now Tim, let's get into a simple bit of mathematics here.  Say I earn $50,000 per annum and my boss earns $80,000 per annum.  As of July 1 this year, my boss will get an effective payrise of $21.00 a week.  I get nothing.  The fact that I pay less tax than he does is simple mathematic logic based on the fact that I earn less than he does.  The fact that I get 'nothing' out of these tax cuts is by virtue of the fact that......I get nothing out of these tax cuts.  You 'hate that type of reporting', Tim.  Well, I'm not particularly fond of your effort on this subject either, more commonly referred to as good ol' BS.  Better adjust the reporting-integrity standards otherwise there might be a serious case of 'credibility creep'.

      It just keeps getting better this week for Collingwood-haters.    The final outcome of a collapse against the might blues at the weekend:  lopped whatever hopes they had for the finals this year,  it seems that Figjam Buckley could be out for 6-8 weeks now, rather than the original 3-4 that normally goes with a hammy.  the 'Moonah-flasher', Brodie Holland, was outed by the tribunal last night for misconduct (i.e. trying to leave his boot-sponsor's logo on Scott Camporeale's bonce)   Life is sweet.  I'm getting out the paint can, Kate.  What address should I post the wooden spoon to?

      OK punters, part two of my 'Most influential CD's' series.    At Number 5 was  urlLink Bruce Springsteen - Born in the USA     4.  Apocalypse 91: The Enemy Strikes Black – Public Enemy   This CD came to me via JJJ back in the summer of ’91.  I think I was parked at Macleod shopping centre, back in Melbourne.  Probably still driving my yellow Holden Gemini at that stage.  The first song I heard was ‘By the time I get to Arizona’ and it Blew. Me. Away.    The intensity of Chuck D’s voice was almost tangible as it broke through the speakers like a bomb.  This was my first real experience with artists whose sole purpose seemed dedicated to addressing social issues.  Now, I’m not going to pretend to have become a Black Panther or whatever, but Chuck D’s passion was infectious and this album opened my eyes to two whole new genres of music – the first being hip-hop and the second being the music of bands like Rage Against The Machine, who aren’t afraid to make music that addresses social issues, despite whether or not it’s commercially responsible or popular to do so.  I was fortunate enough to see P.E. here in Hobart a few years ago, performing at the union centre at Tas Uni.  It was incredible.  There with a bunch of mates, soaking in sweat, screaming my head off and believing that we could have formed an army that night if we needed to.  As an interesting aside to that night, I bought a T-shirt at the gig and wore it with pride for 1 night – after which I accidentally washed it with a new red jumper, which happened to leak some dye in the wash and turned my big tough Public Enemy S1W T-shirt a lovely shade of pink.

      CNN have commissioned  urlLink a poll  where Americans were surveyed regarding the recent Iraqi prisoner abuse scandal.  Thankfully the poll indicates that 73% of those surveyed thought that the abuse as documented these last few weeks was unjustified.  But in a slightly unnerving piece of mathematical genius by yours truly, that would mean that 27% of those surveyed think that parading prisoners around naked, piling them up as human pyramids, faking electoruction scenes and sicking dogs onto them is, well, OK I guess!  Additional good news for 'Yo-ho-ho' Rummy Rumsfeld is that only 48% of those surveyed thought he should bear any responsibility at all for situation.  That's less than half Rummy!!  If you've got one of those "The buck stops here" signs on your desk, then whip it down and write in at the start: "50 cents of...".  Once that's done, you can get back to studying Kim Jong Il's house plans.

      I know it probably flogging a hors...a deaded horse...or something like that, but I stumbled accross this site and couldn't resist extracting a few quotes from the Dubyanator.

      Once again, punching well above our weight, Tasmania is about to turn out a member of European royalty, when all the mainland seems to be able to do is churn out personalities based on  urlLink home reno's ,  urlLink manufactured music  or  urlLink underworld killings .  Mary Donaldson is about to become Australia's own Princess Di.  And just like Di, every utterance from the good lady's mouth is being waited on by the media for reportage to a growing base of wannabe Danes here in Oz.  Today, the NEWS conglomerate is featuring  urlLink a piece  bringing to the light the startling fact that Mares was saddened by the death of her mother.  I mean COME ON!  Please please please can we maintain a bit of decorum here and let our little princess chickadee live in peace.  Stop publishing this fluff and give us some actual news to read.  My advice to Mary - if you and Fred ever visit Paris, stay well clear of any tunnels.  As a slightly more interesting aside, it seems the piece was written by Mary herself.  I might email a copy down to the English teachers at Taroona High School and have it marked!

      OK punters.  This isn’t your ordinary ‘desert island discs’ type list.  You know, the ‘what 5 CDs would I want to have with me if I was stuck on a desert island forever?’  This is definitely not that type of list.    This is a list of the most influential CDs I’ve ever owned.  Whether they signposted a particular period in my life or changed the way I thought about music, these CDs all made a mark during my 34 years so far.  Some of these I don’t listen to anymore, but they’ve been the foundation, the bridge to a new sphere of musical and social enjoyment.  One a day for the next 5 days (well, maybe 2 today so I can get it done this week!)    5.	Born in the USA – Bruce Springsteen   This pick is fittingly first to be listed.  Not because it’s a favourite CD.  In fact, I don’t even own a copy of it anymore.  This album was released some time in the early 80’s.  The exact time isn’t that important really.  What happened when it came out though was.    I’d been playing brass instruments from the time I was about 10,  And all this time I had pretty much no interest in popular music.  It seemed like a lifetime wihout the radio or anything current, but it was probably a year or 18 months. However long it was, I really didn't have an interest in popular music at all.  Until this album came out.  Dancing in the Dark caught my ear, and whilst on holidays in Lakes Entrance that summer, I bought the cassette (remember those?).    Well, I was reborn.  Don’t know why, but every song on the album just seemed to reach out to me and after a long period of nothing but brass band music, it was quite a rebirth.  Imagine a 15 year old getting sentimental over ‘Bobby Jean’.  Or pumped up over ‘Born in the USA’ (which is ironic now given my questioning of the USA’s current foreign policy leanings).  I’ve never been a huge Springsteen fan since, but I guess sometimes it only takes one effective moment to garner a lifetime of respect. A huge album at the time and a huge album in my life.  UPDATE:  I wrote this last night, but this morning I can't separate my top 6 into just 5 places.  So whilst this is a clear #5, the #1 position won't be so clear, so I'm going to make it a top 6, with a 1a and 1b.  It's my blog, I can do what I want!

      Ah, just had to post again to make sure the point was made about how good it was to beat Collingwood on the weekend.  As a Carlton supporter, my genetic makeup has been altered over the years.  Like all Carlton supporters (and most supporters from any club except Collingwood) I've developed an inbuild hatred for the Magpies that pretty much transcends reason.  Added satisfaction:  Looks like Figjam Buckley might have rushed back a little too quickly from his hammy and strained it again.  Another 3-4 weeks Nathan?  Ooooh diddums!  Added satisfaction II:  Looks like most pundits are calling Collingwood's season as over.  At the hands of Carlton!  Woohoo!!  Said one correspondant on the  urlLink AFL website :   – this was meant to be the day the Magpies kick-started their 2004 season.  But instead it is the Blues celebrating their third win of the season while the Magpies remain rooted to the bottom of the ladder with just one win from seven rounds. Rooted indeed!

      Published widely in the national dailies today was a  urlLink story  outlining the dispute between little brother East Timor and big brother, trying to benevolent (but don't mess with our business) Australia.  It seems there's a bit of a border dispute going on, which wouldn't be so much of an issue except there's money at stake.  Lots of it.  Barrels a day of it.  At stake are energy revenues from a lucrative gasfield located between the two countries.  East Timor's Big Banana, Xanana Gusmao, has claimed that we're trying to steal candy from his baby by staking our claim at the edges of our continental shelf.  International law is likely to draw a legitimate border halfway between Oz and E.T, which would place 90% of the Greater Sunrise gasfield in E.T's territory.  Currently, under the terms of the joint venture, Australia enjoys 80% of the revenue and E.T 20%.    Now i'd think in all fairness that some terms more sympathetic to E.T's plight would be understandable.  They're a new nation, without infrastructure and with the ever-present threat of poverty and hostile neighbors in Indo.  So what do we do - remind them who helped win their independance and then tell them all to stop whining about bullying whilst we relieve them of their resources.  The Big Xanana:    Mr Gusmao said the money at stake was vital to his nation's survival.   "It is a question of life or death, a question of being continually poor, continually begging or to be self-sufficient," he said.  Says a sympathetic Alexander Downer:   "I think they've made a very big mistake thinking that the best way to handle this negotiation is trying to shame Australia, is mounting abuse on our country, accusing us of being bullying and rich and so on when you consider all we've done for East Timor,"  Your empathy and generosity is overwhelming, Al.  We helped you out, took heaps of international kudos for doing so, but we're the big guys here and we're calling the shots so don't stuff around with us where there's money at stake.    No wonder you lasted a full five minutes as Liberal leader back in the day.

      I learned several new lessons over the weekend.  Simple, but true.  1.   Don't laugh at inappropriate times, it may get you killed if you're being tortured.    PJ and I were playing backgammon at the weekend and she didn't appreciate me laughing when I rolled double 6's when she was rolling all 2s and 1s.  She reminded me of the damaging effects laughter could have in precarious situations such as torture.  2.   Don't underestimate the Carlton Football Club .   What a win over the old foe, Collingwood.  27 points down, 6 minutes into the last quarter, and the Blues pulled out a brilliant win.  Mr 16 year old did remind me however, that all we managed to do was come back and beat the team on the bottom of the ladder.  Oh well.  3.   No matter how bleak the situation appears, there's always hope .   See no.4.  And no.2 as well I guess, though no.4 is in no way related to no.2.  4.   Pray at the start of a bleak situation, not at the end .   Amidst a difficult family time, there was a marked turnaround after the simple prayer of a very faithful woman.  A situation for which we are very thankful.

      Hey Folks,  Check it out.  The new, blacker, more sinister and mysterious Green Interior!!  Actually, I just thought the new template was pretty cool.  Now I've just got to figure out how to manipulate it a little and get my blogroll on board etc etc.  I like the previous, Greener Green Interior, mainly just because it was green.  This one is a little more me though I think, so thanks to the geeks at Blogger for setting this up.  Bloggerised comments too, WOW!  Happy Bloggers Day, Blogger!

      Nice to see the Reserve Bank considers the housing market here in Oz to be  urlLink finally coming off the boil .  Things have been nuts for a while now, especially here in Tassie.  I was lucky enough to buy my first home 2 years ago, before things started heading up in a big way.  Things have been going north in the housing market all over the country for a while, but Tassie took a long time to catch up.  Now that it has, it's just been crazy.  We've done little to our place and when I had it valued last month, the bank valuation (as opposed to an agent's valuation) came in over double what we paid 2 years ago!!  Of course, with established houses going up and up, building becomes a more attractive option, but the builders have been going off too, with some quoting in excess of $12,000 per square.  Chill out boys.  As noted in an earlier post, we've just bought a block here in Hobart to build on, so hopefully the market continues to cool and we can get someone to build us our polehouse for a reasonable price.  On another matter, I wonder if  urlLink this bloke  was a builder, seeing he had so much crack in his pants!

      Joining Bil and Mo Skaf in the rapists cells will be Graeme Slattery,  urlLink convicted today to 14 years , 11.5 of them without parole.  Slattery imprisoned a woman for between 1996 and 1999, forcing her to perform all sorts of acts for his amusement.  Bubba's waiting Graeme!!

      There's only one positive out of the Skaf brothers latest saga.  At least the trial system is being monitored and a fair trial ensured.  Bil and Mo Skaf were the Sydney brothers previously convicted for their roles in a series of gang rapes.  Unfortunately, during their trail, two 'maverick' jurors ignored a judge's direction and went to visit the crime scene and conduct their own re-creation of the events.  This action has seen the convictions  urlLink overturned  and a retrial will have to take place, forcing victims to once again relive the horror of these events.  It's cold comfort, but at least the trial system is ensuring a fair trial for all, even the bad guys.  The court announcing the retrial even called the incident regrettable.  Hopefully it'll go without a hitch and these preying pimples will finally get their date with Bubba in D block.  Hell ain't hot enough for scum like this.

      As has been reported elsewhere in the blogosphere, Michael Moore's latest documentary 'Farenheit 911' has had it's planned release stalled by Disney.  Disney owns Miramax, the production company that has bankrolled the film to the tune of some US $6 million.    As usual, the righties out there in blogland have claimed a victory for capitalism in Disney asserting it's moral right to quash the distribution.  Using the usual fatty boombah taunts, the stormtroopers over at  urlLink Blair's place  have all jumped into line.  Now did they read the short version at  urlLink The Age , or at  urlLink News Ltd ?  Or did they go to the longer, fuller, more detailed story at the NY Times (ref below)  As the owner of Miramax, Disney has the right, in a contractual agreement negotiated with Miramax's executives, to veto releases under certain circumstances.  Examples cited in the  urlLink NY Times article  (free reg may be required) are NC17 ratings or budget blowouts.  Miramax asserts that this isn't one of those circumstances covered in the agreement and is hoping to negotiate the release and distribution of the film.    As you would expect, Moore's camp is crying foul, with his agent claiming Disney's chairman, Michael Eisner, asked Moore to pull out of the deal with Miramax as it would endanger tax breaks enjoyed by Disney in Florida.  Some of you may remember that Florida is the home state of one Jeb Bush, whose brother in particular and family in general get a fair pasting in the film for having some rather suss ties to Saudi Arabia.  A Disney spokesman, whilst not referring to the agreement, stated that  Mr. Moore's film is deemed to be against Disney's interests not because of the company's business dealings with the government but because Disney caters to families of all political stripes and believes Mr. Moore's film, which does not have a release date, could alienate many.    Genuine resistance, or shrewd publicity from a media company in some trouble?  You can be the judge.  Regardless of Disney's stance, the film will get out there somehow.  Looking forward to seeing it, right before US election time I reckon.  Should be interesting.

      What a brilliant day in the NBA playoffs!!  First up, the Miami Heat, with my boy Dwyane Wade (I'm claiming him as a cousin, despite the lack of family resemblance),  urlLink roll over the New Orleans hornets , winning their 7-game first round series 4-3.  What's the big deal?  Miami were the 3rd worst team in the NBA last year.  This year their coach resigned four days before the season started.  Under new coach Stan Van Gundy the lost the first 7 games of the season and one quarter way through the season they were languishing with 5 wins, 15 losses.  Hard work and a good run with injuries has seen them claw into 4th place in the east and now a spot in the second round of the playoffs against the Indiana Pacers.  Go Heat!!  Next, MY BOYS, the Sacramento Kings have knocked off the Minny T-wolves in  urlLink game 1  of their 2nd round series.  Minny may have the MVP in Kevin Garnett, but the Kings still have the Most Valuable TEAM of passers and scorers.  I just noticed the Google ads before, advertising the Dallllllas Mavriks, due to my NBA post below.  Time to right balance and get some Kings ads.  Sacramento Kings Sacramento Kings Sacramento Kings  That'll do it.  No-one's going to click on the ads anyway.  Go Kings!!!!!

      What would you say about a place if there was an authoritative opinion-giver there, supposedly within in the domain of free speech and people were banned from dissenting?  Even after the opinion-giver admitted some wrong?  Suppose the authority said something and several dissenters were whipped in prose, quite less than elegant, put together by the body that provides access to the authority.  What if, while banning the dissenters from ever dissenting again, the controlling body suggested (quite publicly) that you, as a person, a dissenter, a 'troll', were a bit of a sexual miscreant with a liking for some of the kinkier sides of the act?  Where did this happen?  Mahathir's Malaysia?  Hitler's Germany?  Nope, it happened in the comments section of  urlLink Tim Blair's website  today.  That Andrea Harris is quite a controlling little woman isn't she?

      I got an email from Stu about this, and  urlLink Tim Dunlop  has a bit of a crack at it as well.  It's the supposed top 20 guitar riffs of all time as published by Total Guitar magazine.  The list is as follows:  GUNS N' ROSES - "Sweet Child O' Mine"  NIRVANA - "Smells Like Teen Spirit"  LED ZEPPELIN - "Whole Lotta Love"  DEEP PURPLE - "Smoke On The Water"  METALLICA - "Enter Sandman"  DEREK & THE DOMINOES - "Layla"  METALLICA - "Master Of Puppets"  AC/DC - "Back In Black"  JIMI HENDRIX - "Voodoo Child"  BLACK SABBATH - "Paranoid"  OZZY OSBOURNE - "Crazy Train"  FREE - "All Right Now"  MUSE - "Plug In Baby"  LED ZEPPELIN - "Black Dog"  VAN HALEN - "Ain't Talkin' 'Bout Love"  AEROSMITH - "Walk This Way"  CREAM - "Sunshine Of Your Love"  QUEENS OF THE STONE AGE - "No One Knows"  GUNS N' ROSES - "Paradise City"  RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINE - "Killing In The Name"  Tim has a few complaints about the lack of Rolling Stones riffs and about the fact that Smoke on the Water got a guernsey before Black Night.  Agreed, Black Night is a better riff, but 'Smoke' does have a sentimentality to it that anyone that's picked up an electric guitar can relate to.  It's one of the first riffs that anyone learns to play.  My qualms with the list:  Master of Puppets on the list at all, let alone at Number 7!!??!! Paranoid - c'mon!  Ozzy's TV popularity has got to have influenced this. Ain't talking 'bout love - I was huuuge Van Halen fan back in the day, but this ain't their best stuff.  What about Panama?  At the end of the day (a saying which was also a recent poll winner) who's really fussed?  Riffs are one thing, musicianship's another.  A riff's a lucky thing sometimes.  A guitarist is noodling around trying things out and ooops!  'I can make something out of that!'.  I'd rather listen to a well placed, melodic solo than the same riff over and over.  They have their place, for sure.  'Killing in the Name of' is a great warm up before basketball.  But if I was doing the 'marooned on a desert island' list, I think I'd be going for some variation rather than riff power.  Just my thoughts.  A hint for guitar lovers.  Get a good stereo.  Get a copy of Stevie Ray Vaughn's Riviera Paradise.  And Lenny.  And Life Without You.  Now turn off all the lights.  Sit down and just listen.  He was the best there's ever been.

      The first snow of winter is falling this morning.  I thinks its going to be DVD time.  Times like this I wish I still had a wood heater!  Damn electric things are noisy and nowhere near as warm.  Yep, a heater, the Star Wars trilogy and a bag of Barbeque chips. Beeeeeeeautiful!  But probably won't happen.  Mr 13 wants to go out into the cold and try out the new jump he built for his bike.  Such is life.

      Kev Mullet is out front of his house, fitting a new Holley 650 carby to his EH Holden.  The subwoofer is pumping in the boot.  It’s new.  Kev got it from Supercheap along with the six-stacker, four 3-ways and two tweeters, all for $600.    A few weeks ago he had an extra $1200 in the account. Not really sure why, so he went down to Clive Peeters and picked up a new DVD surround system, one of those really good TEAC units, to go with the widescreen TV he’s paying off on instalments.    Maree, Kev’s missus, got in on the loot and got herself a new vac (good for keeping the shag pile looking good) as well as that Princess Diana commemorative plate she’s been after for ages.  Got a certificate of authenticity and all.  The kids, Shane and Shania, they’re only little tackers and don’t really know much about money.  Shane’s got a little bit of an idea that a slab costs around $30, but he’s only 4 so the figures don’t really mean much.  Anyway, they’ll love the new DVD player and Shane loves to ride in the EH.  Kev checked the mail last week and there was a cheque in there.  Another $1200!!  Came with a letter from some chick named Patterson.  ‘Congrats on the way you’re populating this great country’ it said.  ‘Here’s some funds to keep the little sprogs happy, and don’t forget that there’s an election coming up.  Cheers,  Kay’.  “Cripes” says Kev.  “I’m more flushed than last night’s parmigarma!”  So off he went and got the Holley.  There’s a 3 inch exhaust he got from his mate Murray sitting in the shed.  Got that with the cash as well.  Murray reckons it’ll bolt straight on, even if it is off a WRX that Terry chopped up last week. Murray wouldn’t bullshit him after the hiding he copped last time, when his plants went missing from out the back.  Couldn’t sit straight for a week.  Damn it was funny though.  While Kev’s working on the Holley, a white Statesman pulls up.  A guy steps out from behind the wheel and comes up to him.  “Ah, Mr Mullet?  My name is Timothy Blair.  Please prepare yourself for the arrival of our President, ahem, sorry, Prime Minister.”  Timothy heads back to the Statesman and opens the back door.  Somewhere in the background, a choir sings and trumpets sound.  Out from the bowels of the Statesman comes a slightly smallish, balding man.  “How’s it hangin’” asks Kev.  “Ah, all right.  Kevin, isn’t it?”    “Yeah, you can call me Kev if you like.”  “OK, Kev it is then. My name is John Winston Howard.  My advisors call me ‘dubya2’ around the office, but you can call me Mr Prime Minister, or even John if you like.”  “Yeah, I’ve heard of you.  John Laws talks about you all the time.  I love Lawsy.  Straight shooter.  Whatcha doing around here, John?” asks Kev.  “Oh, you know.  I was cruising around and I like to talk with my citizenry and there’s nothing like a good chinwag with a fellow Holden driver, or so I’m advised” says John.  “Yeah, I noticed the nice ride you’ve got there.  Shane’d love a spin in that one.  Who’s the ponce driving it for you?  Don’t you like driving?”    “Oh don’t mind him.  Normally I’d prefer to teach a man how to fish rather than just give him one, but this guy’s beyond help, so I just gave him a job to shut him up.  He keeps asking if he can drive the Touareg in the garage, but the advisors tell me I have to be seen in the Statesman” says John with a knowing grin and a wink.  “The EH here, it’s a Premier, so I ‘spose it’s sort of like your car’s granddaddy!” says Kev.  “She’s going to rip along now with this Holley on her.  Can’t wait to get the exhaust hooked up.  Shane’s face’ll fall off at the lights when I hit the go-pedal.”  “Well, Kev, that’s one reason I wanted to drop in and see you. Centrelink…”  “Oh, those bastards!!  It’s fair dinkum compo!!” shouts Kev.  “Now hold on Kev, I’m not here about that.  I know they like to know how much you’re earning and what undies you’re wearing and all, but they’re just trying to help you get what you’re entitled to.  Anyway, my advisors at Centrelink tell me you might have got a double dose of our generous Family Tax Assistance Bonus.  How are the tin-lids, by the way?  Keeping the weight down are they?”  “Yeah, they’re all right. Shania’s going to be a right looker when she grows up, just like her mum.  The bonus thing you mentioned, is that the moolah I got in the bank and the cheque I got in the mail last week?”  “Yes, Kev.  Look, we decided to reward the Australian people, who live in a great democracy free of terrorism.  People like you have entrusted us with a great responsibility to manage the economy and we’ve done such a good job that we decided to give some money back.  You’ve got some kids and as far as I know you’re enrolled to vote, so we slipped you some cash.  We’ve got plenty of it.”  “I’ve seen you’re ads on TV” said Kev.  “We’re nice people in the government, you know.  Medicare, violence against women.  Fat kids.  Everyone likes it when you look after the kids.  You know, we’ve taxed the crap out of you and so now we’re hell bent on spending it to tell you how we’re spending it and how nice we really are.  I mean Amanda Vanstone, she’d give you the blouse off her own back if you asked her.  Mind you, if you’ve seen her back, you probably wouldn’t ask, but she’d do it.  Anyway, about the payment, unfortunately it looks like we might have paid you twice by mistake.”  “Bugger!  Last time we got $20 too much and I had to sell my youngest, Shandi, just to stop getting thrown back in the klink!  Look, all I did was just go to the mailbox and collect the cheque.”  “Well, see that’s the problem.  Someone shouldn’t have sent the cheque as you’d got your payment direct in the bank” offered John.  “That’s not real good financial management, John”  “Well no, it is actually.  Look at it this way - We’ve returned a hell of a lot of tax money to the Australian people.  That was a nice thing to do.  As it turns out, well, we’re just a heck of a lot nicer than we thought we were.  It’s not really a competency thing, Kev.  We’re just being nice.  We’re so good that we’re now asking Australians like you, free from terrorism and overpaid, to build your character and return the overpayment.”    “Well, that’ll be kind of hard, John.  I can’t get a refund on the exhaust or the Holley and there’s no way that Maree’s going to give up the Lady Di plate.”  “Certificate of Authenticity?”  “Hell yeah!  Franklin Mint mate!!”  “Mmmmmm.  Wouldn’t mind one of those myself.  Ah, royals!  Look Kev, truth is, we’d really like the money back, but the law doesn’t say you have to give it back.  If it did you’d be talking to a real estate agent right now to see how much a 40 year old weatherboard house is worth in the current market.  You sure you can’t repay?”    “It’d be pretty tough, John.”  “You’d be helping to defeat terrorism if you did.  Did I mention Medicare?  Look mate, If you can’t manage, what say we just forget about the whole thing and you just mention it quietly to a few mates at the pub – you know, ‘John called in and helped me tune the new carb.  Great bloke.’ That sort of thing.”  “Should I tell em you’re being real nice, but want the money back?”  “Ummm, no.”  “What about the good financial management stuff and the double payment bit”  “Ummm, I don’t think so.  Have you ever been to Iraq, Kev?  I’m sure Pete Cosgrove could use a good mechanic over there.”  “No, I don’t even like the beach.”  “Petrol’s cheap there you know.  You could run the EH on only a quarter of your pension instead of the half you’re paying now.  Say, what’s that playing on the wireless there?”  “Midnight Oil mate!  Like it? (sings “The You-Ess Forces Give The No-ood”)  “Blair!  Blair!  Start the car please, and shut up about the Touareg or you’ll be driving Ruddock around Lakemba in a Mini Moke.  Thanks for the chat Kev.  Be alert but not alarmed.”

      On June 23, the son of late President and B-Movie star, Ronald Reagan, was  urlLink interviewed recently on Larry King Live .  Here's a partial transcript, which will speak for itself.  Begins with Reagan being questioned about part of the eulogy, where he spoke of his father not wearing his religious heart on his sleeve, unlike other Presidents:   Reagan: I know. I wasn't watching TV much after I delivered the eulogy for a few days. But after a couple of days I started getting calls from people saying, boy you really stirred something up, didn't you? I thought, well, what? Well, you know, the stuff you said about Bush. I said, I didn't say anything about Bush, why would I mention George W. Bush in my father's eulogy?       No, no, no, no, the stuff about the religion. I thought, ha, funny, you then everybody thought I was talking about George W. Bush. And then I heard - everybody thought I was talking about George - but people connected with George W. Bush thought I was talking about George W. Bush. And then I began to think, maybe I was, I just didn't know it.       King: Do you think he wears his religion on his sleeve? He certainly refers to it more than your father ever did.       Reagan: Well, you know, there was that answer he gave to the question about, did you talk to your father about going into Iraq? No, I talked to a higher father, you know, the almighty. When you hear somebody justifying a war by citing the almighty, God, I get a little worried, frankly. The other guys do that a lot. Osama bin Laden's always talking about Allah, what Allah wants, that he's on his side. I think that's uncomfortable.       King: Do you have thoughts on the war?       Reagan: Sure, I have thoughts on the war.       King: And what do you think?       Reagan: And I think we lied our way into the war.       King: You think it's a mistake?       Reagan: Absolutely, a terrible mistake. Terrible foreign policy error. We didn't have to do it. It was optional. And we were lied to. The American public was lied to about WMD, the connection between Osama bin Laden and Saddam, which is virtually nonexistent except for fleeting contacts. But they're still trying to pull that one off now, Cheney and all are out there flogging that.       King: Can I gather from that, that you will not support this president?       Reagan: No, I won't.       King: Will you support his opponent?       Reagan: I will vote for whoever the viable candidate is who can defeat George W. Bush, yes.

      Some of you may have read the blurb to the left, regarding the naming of this website.  I own a 1979 Saab 99 Turbo.  The 99T was the first successful Turbo vehicle made for the mass market.  I love mine to bits.  It's Arctic White with a mint green interior.  Very quirky and individual.  Mine needs some work, but I love it nonetheless.  An opportunity has come up to buy a 99T previously owned by a mate.  It was the first 99T imported into Tassie and is in pristine condition.  Moreover, it's being sold by his estranged wife at a bargain basement price.  Decisions, decisions!!  A/ - the moral dilemma of buying a superb car once owned by a fellow  urlLink Saab Car Club  member and now being sold by his ex.  B/ - the financial dilemma of an impending family holiday.  Aaaaaaaaaargh!  Here's the subject of my next few sleepless nights:     And just to prove I keep good company, here's another Tasmanian getting the keys to her new Saab.  Mary and Fred got a free convertible in Carlton club colors courtesy of Saab Denmark.  Lucky buggers!

      Just picked up on this story this morning.   urlLink The Bracks government in Victoria has prepared an education blueprint as a possible model for Education in Australia.   Under the model, education as a whole would be funded nationally, rather than by the states. Currently the states look after their own primary and secondary schools and the Feds look after the Uni loafers.  I've a feeling this has been leaked and is being reported to gauge some public opinion prior to Labor considering it more seriously as a national agenda.    Under the scheme, schools would have to achieve "good results" as a condition of receiving public funding.   The paper said the link between funding and performance management and accountability were crucial and schools should be expected to meet explicit outcomes. "It needs to be clear at the start of a funding period what a school is receiving funding for," the paper says.  "The accountability and reporting arrangements would improve the incentives for schools to do the most with the resources they have available and would provide better information on which Australian families could base decisions about their children's education."   I can't wait to see the reactions of various educationalists around the country to this one.  The paper was prepared for the Bracks Government by the Allen Consulting Group.  A quick Google on this mob indicates that they provide "high-quality advice in two broad areas: economics, public policy and regulation; and public affairs, stakeholder and issues management."  I've a feeling that the incoming Labor government may need some 'issues management' if it implements an education policy requiring KPIs for teachers and class performance.  I work in the education sector and get around to a lot of schools as a requirement of my job.  There's a lot of places doing it pretty tough.  The thing that groups like Allen Consulting probably don't take into account is the role of parents in a kid's education.  The schools that are most likely to fail under a performance based scheme are those in poorer areas (i.e. those more in need of funding).    For example, in these areas some schools are running breakfast programs for their kids as they don't get breakfast at home.  Now this isn't an issue of the schools just providing something at taxpayer's expense that the kids should get at home.  It's a real student management issue.  If the kids don't get some tucker into them at the start of the day, they run amok for the whole day and are unteachable.  In these areas, many of the parents themselves are functionally illiterate and can't help the kids learn to read and write (lets forget about maths all together).  Experts say you should start reading to your kids before they are even born.  The stats show that kids that can already read and write before they get to school have an enormous advantage over those that can't.  Some parents do go to these lengths to educate their kids.  My own two stepsons were beneficiaries of these efforts on their mother's part and both are great readers and students in general.  The trouble is, in these schools that are most likely to be penalised under a performance based system, the parents don't have the foresight to know the importance of these issues.  And even if they did manage to have the foresight, they don't have the skills to teach the kids at home.  A big proportion of these parents are actually harmful towards their kids in the lack of discipline installed at a young age.  To penalise these struggling schools for what goes on (or doesn't go on) at home is not going to help, especially when all they're doing is failing to meet a set of KPIs dreamed up by a set of Melbourne-based consultants sitting in comfy leather chairs.    It is an incredibly cynical policy proposal and I'd be pretty surprised to see such a policy adopted by the same bloke who advocated giving newborn kids some books to be read to them by their parents in an effort to achieve superior scholastic results.

      Remember when Major O'Kane was not allowed to testify before Senate hearings into the Abu Ghraib prisoner enquiries?  The Prime Minister came out at the time and said that Major O'Kane was not at the level of personnel that would normally be asked to appear before that sort of enquiry.  Never mind the fact that he was the person on the ground with all the facts.  Normal procedure was normal procedure, and would be followed.  Well, another normal convention is that the military is not a political device.  It takes it's direction from the government of the day, regardless of party.  The government uses the military for defence or humanitarian purposes.  It's considered inappropriate to have the military spruiking for you if you're a parliamentarian.  That much is obvious.  It's also inappropriate to use images of the military as political advertising to promote yourself as an MP who'd like to get re-elected.   urlLink The Age ran a story this morning  claiming that Liberal Party candidates were breaching convention, and a direct request by Australian Defence top banana, General Peter Cosgrove.  General Cosgrove specifically requested that defence personnel not be used for political gain by either party.    He told a Senate hearing on June 1: "There is a convention that is well understood that we seek to avoid an overt association of a military person in an image or in any other way with a political activity. If it were to be used for unmistakably political purposes, we would not want that to be done."    The Age story this morning indicated that the Prime Minister and other MPs are distributing newsletters featuring photos of the appropriate Liberal with military personnel.   urlLink John Dubya has rebutted The Age  by saying there's nothing wrong with having your picture taken with servicemen.   It was ridiculous to suggest it was improper for members of parliament to pose in pictures with military personnel, he said.   "That is a ridiculous charge," he told reporters.   "The photograph in question is publicly available on the defence website.   "All members of parliament from time to time get photographed with members of the military."   Now, technically, J-Dub's right.  There isn't necessarily anything wrong with MPs having their photo taken with military personnel.  What IS wrong,  against convention and in direct contravention of the request by General Cosgrove is the use of these images to promote the candidate, as has been done in this instance by the PM himself and a bunch of other candidates, including Parliamentary Secretary, Peter "sink tha" Slipper:  "I am not aware of MPs using defence personnel in political advertising," he said.  Sounds more like the Iraqi information minister a-la April 2003!   Another instance of the Libs penchant for trying to dance between the raindrops.

      I wonder if little Johnny's been reading items from Dubya's recommended reading list?  Upon having a surf of my regular blogs, I came accross this on  urlLink The Exploded Library .  It's a great precis of the Texas Republican Party's operating platform.  And it's scary stuff if you download  urlLink the PDF  and flick through it.  One little and comparitively insignificant snippet that I reckon John Dubya and Erica Betz would have loved to read together in a fireside chat setting.  (I think they'd love it so much they'd get GQ-smooth Benny Nelson to withhold school funding if the schools didn't jump into line - or has that already happened?)   Pledge of Allegiance in Public Schools –  The Party believes that students should be taught flag etiquette and should be led in the Pledge of Allegiance, the Texas pledge, the national anthem and patriotic songs on a daily basis to ensure that the loyal and patriotic spirit of Texas’ and of America’s heritage is preserved and passed on to our children.   Other sections of the document call for the expulsion of the UN, opposition of any current edicts that protect the environment, protection for anyone that opposes homosexuality on the basis of faith (i.e. it's OK to go poofter-bashing if you're a Christian).  There's a bunch of doozies in there, which  urlLink Morgan has edited and summarised  in her efficient librarianly manner.  Check it out.

      I was at our local shopping centre last weekend, just before I took off for Sydney.  After visiting Eastlands, I lobbed into town for some clothing to take on the trip.  Both the local shops and the city were jam packed with grinning shoppers, clutching at bags of new loot that they were taking home to play with.  I thought to myself, could this be the first instalment of the $600 family payment being let loose on Hobart's retailers?  Turns out it was.  Whilst some families received the payments as a welcome relief from some of the pressures facing them (re bills, rent, medical etc), a lot of folks were just lining the lounge rooms with TVs or their pockets with new mobile phones.  The smart shops all had 'sales' on with signs all over the place.  For example, Electronics Botique, which sells PC, PS2 and Xbox games, was chock full of trakkie-pantsed punters willing to part with their twelve $50 notes.   urlLink The SMH has an article on the phenomenon , which will be relived early in the new financial year as "Buy my vote" part 2 gets underway.  Some snippets from the SMH:   In Bourke, Sally Bryant, a council community worker, said she had seen no negative impact on residents. "Most people have been strapped for cash because of the drought and the lack of casual work. They've looked upon this money with gratitude."  The Moree Champion newspaper said children's runners were "walking out the door" of a local shop and sales went "through the roof" at Harvey Norman. The Telstra shop reported sales jumping from two or three a day to 15.  In the Northern Territory, Aboriginal leaders and welfare workers said some parents had spent the money on gambling, alcohol and drugs.  Michael Berto, chairman of the ATSIC council in Katherine, said the payments had triggered increased violence. "This is definitely a result of this payment coming all at once . . . the Government should have handled it better."

      There are a bunch of RWDB's out there that give the impression that they'd love to see another star on the USA flag.  The extra state added would be Australia.  Seems that they are indeed as elite as they're writings hint at.  An AC Nielsen poll published in the SMH i've purchased this morning (sorry, no time for a link) indicates that only 3% of those polled think our relationship with the US is 'not close enough'.

      Some pointless things from the conference I'm currently attending.    There are 3 delegates from Nigeria.  Excpect email scams to be subject to much better corporate governance from now on.  There are around 1500+ delegates here in total.  Most are from Australia, NZ or the US.  Only 2 have the surname 'Smith'.  On the lighter side, there is one named John Holmes and there is no-one at all with the surname 'Bush'.  French keynote speakers are funny, even when they're talking about restoring shareholder confidence (which is by no means a funny subject).  They just talk funny.  Like an hour of Allo Allo.  At around 11 this morning I took a photo of a council worker sweeping water from a decorative fountain here in Darling Harbour. He's still there, still sweeping.  It's 4.40pm.  That water just won't sweep up!

      Have to give  urlLink Swanker  City 2 thumbs up for last night.  Came out of my first I-Max experience (which was brilliant) and there was a free concert out on the water.  There was a barge out on Darling Harbour with a Beatles cover band.  Must have been a couple of thousand people watching the show, dancing around.  Everyone happy to be there and having a good time.  The band even had the Sgt Peppers costumes going and they played for ages.  Special hello to Geoff this morning.  Hope you found this site OK. Poke poke.  Watched 'Sunrise' this morning and they were talking to an 'expert' on whether the Al Qaida figurehead killed in Saudi would be a big blow to the organisation.  They really don't get it, do they?  1st keynote session about to start, so I gotta go. Ciao.

      The reason for the Sydney trip is a conference.  It's an international conference in my professional field.  As always at these things, there's a bunch of trade stands with people giving stuff away in order to attract your attention.  Still popular are the soft squishy 'stress relievers'.  I have a football, lightglobe and a phone stand in the shape of an armchair.  I've also scored numerous pens, a pack of golf tees and even a fly swatter!  Booty baby!  Off to I-Max to look at the Titanic in 3D.

      Well, 24 hrs in Sydney has confirmed that I'm a smalltown boy now.  Who would have thought that only 9 years in Hobart could wash out all the big city life?  Sedge: I thought they would have cleaned up the place a little for the G-G's arrival!  And who would have thought it to be as cold here as it is in Hobart.  I've been freezing my butt off here in town.  Everywhere you walk, you're in shadow and the wind is pretty cold.  The diversity is good, have to admit.  Plenty to see around here. I'm going to try and catch an I-Max movie tonight.  Had a wander around town this morning and I've gotta say, it's big, but I haven't seen anything here yet that I can'tget in Hobart, except perhaps for a dodgy LA Lakers jersey at Paddy's Market that had a NHL (Hockey) tag on it.  I'm based at Darling Harbour so Chinatown is a stone's throw away.  Went for a stroll through there last night and no sign of triads anywhere.  It's the crowds that get me though.  The traffic is just nuts and all angry.  Horns blaring at every intersection.  There's people absolutely everywhere, which suits a lot of people but bugs me.  Like I said, I'm smalltown now.  OTHER NEWS - called home and PJ told me the former Premier of Tasmania, Jim Bacon, died today (or maybe yesterday).  That was very quick.  He only resigned as Premier a few months ago, due to an inoperable lung tumor.  Ciggies will kill you.

      In my little blogdescriptor to the left I mention the rising real estate prices here in Tasmania.  For example, I puchased my 3br unit here in May 2002 for $114,000.  It's recently been valued at $235,000 (not by an agent, by a registered valuer).  Property was underpriced here for years up until the 1st home buyers grant came in.  Market traffic picked up slowly, then very quickly leading to a climax in October/November 2003, where properties were being sold as soon as they listed.  Here's some examples from this week's Real Estate Guide, published by The Mercury as an insert to each Friday's paper.  I did a little research to find the prior sales prices of these properties, which are all currently for sale.   urlLink Waimea Avenue , Sandy Bay - 4br concrete block house, selling for offers above $750,000.  Last sale of this property was in 1994 for $200,000.  That's a 275% profit in 10 years.  Not bad.   urlLink Risdon Road , Newtown - 3br weatherboard house, selling for offers above $410,000.  Last sale of this property was in August 2003 for $335,000.  A profit of $75,000 or 22.4% - not bad either.  But the sale prior to that was in Feb 2003. Those smart vendors bought it for only $235,000, making a $100,000 42.6% in 6 months.   urlLink York Street , Bellerive - 2br brick unit, selling for $300,000 (yeah, a unit!).  Last sold for $116,000 in 1993. That's 159% in 11 years (not as good as Sandy Bay, but not bad either).   urlLink Kirala Court , Berriedale - 6br brick home, selling for offers above $235,000.  Last sold for $132,000 in July 2002.  That's $103,000 or 78% in 2 years.  One of the results of this huge rise in prices, which has basically happened just in the last 18 months, is a bunch of people buying in a rush.  Many mainlanders have been buying over the web without having seen the property and, I'd imagine, with a limited knowledge of the local market.  Rentals can't always be achieved sufficient to cover the mortgage payments.  In plainest terms, some people have paid more than they can afford.  Like the owners of a place in  urlLink Lloyd Street , Carlton, an eastern semi-rural beachside area in Hobart.  This family paid $180,000 for their 3br brick home back in February 2004, and it's now back on the market at a range of $160,000 to $180,000.  Hope they get what they need.

      This thought scared me last night.  John Howard at age 47 - leader of opposition, PM aspirant, well regarded as a parliamentary performer, former holder of significant portfolios and a voice and communication style that was about as irritating as a bucket of sand in your jocks.  Kevin Rudd is 47.  Hasn't been leader of the opposition yet but considered having a crack at it when Crean stood down. Other than this, the resemblance is quite similar.  Eeeeeek!!  I think Johnny was 55 or 56 when he became PM, which means we have around 8 years to have Rudd pensioned off.  Either that or I'm moving to Canada.  I caught a little of Lateline last night, with 'tightface' Kevin Rudd waxing lyrical on the 9/11 commission report.  Rudd was beating the horse about how the report doomed the entire Liberal Party and their families, pets, workmates and the future progeny of all these, to listen to Celine Dion on a loop for days on end for the rest of their lives and other associated cruel and unusual penalties.    Basically, a lot of what he was saying was right, but my problem is when Rudd says it,  I just don't want to listen .  He just reminds me so much of the smart kid at school who you wanted sooo much to have his head flushed in the dunny.  I'm sorry, I'm normally a very tolerant man, but this guy just gives me the irrits.  Maybe we could get this guy   to show him some of the inner parts of Marrickville and introduce him to 'the common touch' (gloves optional).

         That Dick Cheney He so brainy Count his pennies For a day that's rainy    Couldn't resist.   urlLink Corpwatch have prepared an investigative report  into the funds received and services provided by Halliburton as part of the reconstruction of Iraq.  This is the same Halliburton that once employed Vice President, Dick Cheney as one of it's senior administrators.  The same Halliburton that recently won an uncontested tender for more services - a tender that was OK'd with the VPs office prior to being awarded and made public.  Go read the report and see for yourself why I'm naming Cheney the 'misplaced mullet' (i.e. stinking rotten fish).  Here's some appetisers:   In testimony submitted to members of Congress, one truck driver explained in detail how taxpayers were billed for empty trucks driven up and down Iraq and how $85,000 vehicles were abandoned for lack of spare tires. A labor foreman said dozens of workers were told to "look busy" while doing virtually no work for salaries of $80,000 a year.   [...]  Critics say that the Halliburton's contract with the military has been especially problematic because the company has what is called a "cost-plus" contract, which means the company is repaid for all expenditures, plus a percentage fee and possible bonus on top of that.  Davis refused to allow testimony from five former Halliburton employees who had additional evidence of waste, fraud, and abuse. Instead, Henry Waxman, the highest-ranked Democrat on the committee, released their statements to the public.  One statement came from David Wilson, a Halliburton employee charged with delivering supplies by from Camp Cedar II in southern Iraq to Camp Anaconda just north of Baghdad between November 2003 and March 2004. He explained that his supervisors didn't care what was being transported, so long as the trucks drove as many times as possible from one end of the country to the other.  "The paperwork I carried had no details about the contents of our cargo - basically all they were looking for was the number of trucks with freight on them (but) a related problem was that KBR would run trucks empty quite often," Wilson said. "Sometimes they would have five empty trucks, sometimes they would have a dozen. One time we ran 28 trucks and only one had anything on it. There were several times when we had empty trucks both on the way to Anaconda and then on the way back to Cedar II. I don't understand why KBR would have placed our lives in danger that way for no reason."   [...]  "As every other trucker working on those convoys will tell you, KBR had virtually no facilities in place to do maintenance on these trucks. There were absolutely no oil filters or fuel filters for months on end. I begged for filters but never got any. I was told that oil changes were out of the question. KBR removed all the spare tires in Kuwait. So when one of our trucks got a flat tire on the highway, we just had to leave it there for the Iraqis to loot, which is just crazy. I remember saying to myself when it happened, 'You just lost yourself an $85,000 truck because of a spare tire. We lost a truck because we didn't have $25 hydraulic line to assist the clutch.'"  Another former Halliburton employee, Mike West, said that prior to Halliburton, he had working as an area manager for Valero Energy with a yearly salary of $70,000. "When I heard about a chance to earn more with Halliburton, I called them up," he said. "After just a few minutes, the woman said I was hired as a labor foreman at a salary of $130,000. I didn't even have to send in a resume."  [...]  "One day, I was ordering some equipment. I asked the camp manager if it was OK to order a drill," West said. "He said to order four. I responded that we didn't need four. He said: 'Don't worry about it. It's a cost-plus contract.' I asked him, 'So basically, this is a blank check?' The camp manager laughed and said, 'Yeah.' He repeated this over and over again to the employees."   What's that smell?

      I'm Swade, and here's  urlLink the news :    The Federal Opposition says a report from the official investigation into the September 11 terrorist attacks "blows apart" Prime Minister John Howard's argument that the invasion of Iraq is part of the war on terrorism.  The US investigation into the attacks on the World Trade Centre and the Pentagon has found there is "no credible evidence" that Iraq helped Al Qaeda in any operation against the United States.   In other news, the Pope confirms that he is a Catholic and scientists find that bears do, indeed, take their dump in the woods.

      I'm hoping I can put the whole Abu Ghraib thing to rest after this post, but I've a feeling that there's more to come.  There's a really frustrated electorate out there.  Whether it be Medicare, foreign affairs, tax cuts (ahem) or a whole slew of other issues - the people of Australia want to see some actions that aren't aimed four-square at management of public perceptions.  Another problem facing the government is that as each new spin story joins the sorry queue of public policy, the electors become more and more cynical.  Sometimes, somewhere, amongst all this PR bull, a bit of the truth comes out.  Senator Robert Hill is now being fitted for his political casket after  urlLink apologising yesterday  for misleading the Prime Minister regarding the timing of Australia's knowledge of prisoner abuses.  Seems that reports concerning these issues started filtering through in June 2003.  The key player in this affair has been the mysterious Major George O'Kane, who must now be getting kitted up for entry into the Army's equivalent of the Witness Protection Program.  The PM has said repeatedly that Major O'Kane won't be appearing before any enquiries as it's not normal practice for someone of his rank to do so. The PM's spreading the crap rather thinly on the bread in the hope that we won't smell what he's feeding us, but make no mistake, this is another Canberran bullshit sandwich.  OK, it's not normal practice, but is it inappropriate?  Is it forbidden?  Is there a law that can stop the truth from being presented to this Senate inquiry?  You see, we could trust the evidence being presented by Senator Hill, except for the fact that he's just admitted misleading his boss.    I've always thought that Robert Hill was a pretty good operator.  He came accross to me as an honest and somewhat compassionate individual.  I still hold to a certain amount of this belief, but I do think he's missing some of the cajoles to manage an armed force.  I think that maybe he was dudded by some army management types and didn't have said cajoles to demand that pertinent information was passed up the chain.  Now as the minister responsible he's rightly being raked over the coals for not having his house in order.  The frustration over the spin and secrecy within the government, mentioned at the top of this post, is further enhanced by stuff like this:   Through a spokeswoman, Senator Hill last night told The Age he believed he had not misled Parliament and would not resign.  The spokeswoman said the reports that Senator Hill received in June and July covered a range of issues faced in Iraq. "It mentioned it (Amnesty's abuse concern) in passing, they were incidental references," she said.  The reports Senator Hill received  would not be released , she said.   Abuse comes in many forms, including neglect.  I've a feeling that this government has been neglecting the preservation of our national identity and integrity a little too long.  Change is in the wind, Johnathan.

      I love basketball.  I love the team aspect of the game and I love the fact that even though I have a team around me, I'm still 1 of only 5 players on the floor for my team.  Everyone's a part of a bigger whole and yet everyone's individually important at the same time.  This is a fundamental part of the philosophy of basketball for me.  You have individual skills, team skills, individual battles on the floor and team battles.  Strengths and weaknesses to exploit and have exploited.  So I turn, once again, to the 2004 NBA champion Detroit Pistons.  In a league filled with stars, playing against a team boasting 4 future Hall Of Fame players, the Pistons were unglamorous workmen.  There's not much I can write that can parallel  urlLink Bill Simmons' column at ESPN today .  Here's an excerpt:   The Pistons played harder. They found every loose ball, controlled the offensive boards, kept beating the tired Lakers down the floor. They never stopped coming, never stopped "going for it." It was like watching one of those old fights from Roberto Duran's prime, the way he would keep coming and coming after his opponent, always moving forward, never letting the other guy breathe. Eventually, the other guy would cave. Just like the Lakers did.  The Lakers weren't ready for them. Maybe they had the best two players on the floor, but the Pistons had everything else: chemistry, bench players, coaching, you name it. Much like the Rams-Patriots Super Bowl, everyone kept waiting for the favorites with the recognizable stars to impose their will, but the underdog kept landing haymakers and making plays. Usually, the team with the best player wins the series; in this case, Detroit's defense was more dominant than any single player in the league. So they deserved to win the title. They're a worthy champion.   More importantly, the sanctity of the game was restored. A team like the 2004 Lakers shouldn't win the title, not with so many involved for the wrong reasons. Shaq and Kobe have been co-existing uneasily for years, like two people trapped in a bad marriage, neither of them displaying the guts to ask for a divorce. Malone and Payton swallowed their pride for supporting roles on a potential champion, then folded like accordions when the team actually needed them. Phil Jackson kept holding on for a chance to break Red Auerbach's record of nine titles, even though he stopped breaking a sweat years ago. (His team was jarringly unprepared this spring.) Even the organization has been mailing it in for years -- it hasn't developed an above-average starter, much less an All-Star caliber player, since it traded for Kobe eight years ago.   These guys didn't care about each other. They didn't like playing with each other. They didn't play hard until you practically stuck a gun to their heads. They thought passion came with an on-off switch. With the season slipping away before Game 4 of the Finals, five of the veterans pulled the coach into a bathroom and threw everyone else under the bus. The message was clear: Every man for himself. The exact opposite of 12 guys coming together as one.  And then you had the Pistons. Years from now, they'll remember their journey just like Isiah remembered everything during that TV show  (a replay of a 1988 game where Isiah Thomas saw himself, for the first time, scoring 25 points in a quarter on a sprained ankle during the playoffs),  when the memories came flooding back, when the footage of a 10-year-old game brought him to tears. As Isiah described it, "Seeing that, and feeling that, and going through all that emotion, I mean, as a player, that's what you play for. That's the feeling you want to have."   Exactly.   Maybe we can't understand, but the 2004 Pistons certainly did. As one of the remaining 19 NBA diehards on the planet, I'm just glad that order was finally restored. There's hope for this league yet.

      Yeeeeeeeeessssssssss.  As predicted here on Green Interior - The Detroit Pistons have opened a can of whoop-ass on the LA Lakers.  Unbelievable!  A team from the East has won the championship.  Go Big Ben.  Go the 'fro.    Go Pistons! (except Chauncey Billups with that stupid 'mo).  In other basketball related news, ESPN columnist Ralph Wiley passed away from heart attack, aged 52.  2 weeks ago he was asked on an ESPN chat when the East would win a championship.  His reply: "in about 10 days".  One of the best writers in the business, you can check out R-Dub and Road Dog  urlLink here .

      Thought I'd dredge this up, just for the fun of it.  One of David Letterman's old Top Ten lists:   Top Ten President Bush Excuses For Not Finding Weapons of Mass Destruction   10. "We've only looked through 99% of the country"  9. "We spent entire budget making those playing cards"  8. "Containers are labeled in some crazy language"  7. "They must have been stolen by some of them evil X-Men mutants"  6. "Did I say Iraq has weapons of mass destruction? I meant they have goats"  5. "How are we supposed to find weapons of mass destruction when we can't even find Cheney?"  4. "Still screwed up because of Daylight Savings Time"  3. "When you're trying to find something, it's always in the last place you look, am I right, people?"  2. "Let's face it -- I ain't exactly a genius"  1. "Geraldo took them"  PS - I caught Letterman last night.  Is there anyone more annoying on this planet than Paris Hilton?  Note to Paris - confidence is good.  Humility is better.

       urlLink Backpages  is pushing the August 7 election date again.  If so then it's policy time and what better time for new Labor recruit, Peter Garrett, to show off his enviro-nous than with the  urlLink announcement of the government's energy blueprint  for the future.  What?  Oh, yeah - Garrett isn't actually elected yet.  OK then.  I'll take it on.  First up I have to acknowledge publicly that I have no meaningful experience whatsoever with the energy sector.  I've changed a fuse once.  I plug stuff in to power points at home.  But that's about it.  So here's the take of a politically cynical idealist.   urlLink GEOSEQUESTRATION  is the new word of the day and the centrepiece of the government's energy strategy.  It's the process by which carbon dioxide and other waste gases from the energy-generation process are compressed into liquid form and then pumped deep underground where they are absorbed/stored in porous rocks.  This means drastically reduced greenhouse gas emissions and therefore a reduction in the threat of global warming.  What else does it mean?  It means we can keep mining fossil fuels for at least around 1600 years (the assumed storage time-capacity of a proposed geosequestration site in Gippsland) It means that the renewable energy sector has basically been cut off at it's knees in its infancy in Australia.  It means once again that big business (120000 employees, $24 billion in exports) is being fed even more tax breaks that it needs to keep on keeping on whilst a developing industry that has a real long-term outlook is being shelved.  What else does it mean?  The possibility of an environmental disaster cannot be overlooked.  It's happened once already (see the link above).  1800 people asphyxiated.  This example was one of a flawed storage site, which wouldn't happen again, correct?  Well, Chernobyl, Exxon Valdez and Union Carbide weren't supposed to happen either, but they did.  Like I said - I'm an idealist.  I don't understand why we have to grow an already huge fossil fuels sector when a more environmentally responsible alternative is planned, viable and working well in it's infant stages.  Wind energy is viable, but needs investment.  Solar energy is viable, but expensive to the individual (unless they live in one of the unannounced select areas that will qualify for the bone tossed to greenies in yesterday's blueprint).  So why snub work being pursued in many other progressive countries in order to go full-steam-ahead on fossil fuels?  Jobs, money and John's old mate George. Didn't I read somewhere that George has some ties to the energy sector?  The US consumes, by far, the biggest share of energy reserves in the world per capita and wants to just keep on doing it, regardless of the costs.  Call me silly.   The Government has identified 65 potential geostorage sites and is working closely with the Bush Administration to develop the controversial technology.   Joined at the hip again.  George has been proving for his whole life and especially in his presidency that energy is an important thing.  Oil is his baby.  Coal is ours.  Extraction methods are known and economies of scale have built up over the years.  They get quick results on energy, then they can line the country's pockets and everyone will be happy.  In years to come our great-grandchildren may be living very different lives, but at least we got to drive a Hummer.  Look, I understand that there's 120,000 people employed in the sector and that it's a huuuuuge export earner for this country.  I'm not advocating a cut to any of that.  Keep it at that level or grow it at an appropriate rate.  It's just that this blueprint seems to me to be aimed at the exponential growth of the fossil fuel sector, at the expense of developing a fledgling industry that is cleaner, greener and has enormous potential.

      Here I go again, confidently predicting the result of an NBA game.  Detroit will finish off the Lakers today, making heretics of all commentators the world over.  Who'd have thought that a team from the East could win the NBA title?  Well, it WILL happen today.  For the record, I'm about 0-10 with my predictions this year.  Believe it or not, I actually won $900 in a month a few years ago betting on NBA games.  Bought myself a nice Nikon camera (which is now worth about $300 thanks to the digital revolution). How times change.  Kobe predicted a game 5 Lakers win the other day, so it's me vs Kobe 1 on 1.  Check the ball, homie.

      I had a wonderfully politics-free long weekend.  Took Mr 13 year-old bowling.  Saw the Pistons win game 4 in the NBA.  Helped friends move to their new house by the beach.  Carlton beat Hawthorn in the AFL.  PJ beat me at backgammon, but that's good too.  So in keeping with happy, simpler thoughts on things, here's my political wrap for last week:  Garrett - good Powell - bugger off Armitage - grow a neck, then bugger off Bush - Get a new job Howard - smarten up Latham - still waiting on policy Merlin - you idiot  p.s. Replace Rumsfeld!  Vote 1 - Piston's coach Larry Brown for  urlLink Secretary of Defence

      Dick Cheney has been the subject of a few posts here at Green Interior (by the way, do you like the new dots?).  Seems the inevitable confirmation has come that  urlLink not all is being played above board  when it comes to handing out multi-million dollar contracts for work to be done in Iraq.   The Pentagon has acknowledged that Vice-President Dick Cheney's chief of staff and other political appointees helped make the controversial decision on a $1.8 million contract for the postwar recovery of Iraq's oil sector.  The decision to award the contract to the energy giant Halliburton overruled recommendations of an army lawyer. Eventually it resulted in the awarding of a much larger $US7 billion ($A10 billion) no-bid contract to Halliburton. Mr Cheney ran Halliburton for five years before he was nominated for vice-president.    This guy stinks like a misplaced fish in a stationwagon.

      The Detroit Pistons are doing what a lot of people wanted them to - Beat L.A. - it's just that nobody saw it coming!!    The Pistons pounded the Lakers today in Game 3, to take a 2-1 lead in the best of 7 series to decide the champs for 2004.  I've predicted L.A. to win in 5 games, then pushed it out to 6 (which can still happen, by the way).  They've trumped almost everyone so far this series.  And I mean almost everyone.  ESPN's predictions page recorded the playoff predictions of 14 of their senior basketball writers.  How many of them had to Pistons to win?  Only two.    Talk about unbelievable!  Get this:  Karl Malone missed 10 games in 18 years with Utah.  He's missed 39 this season and his knee is so dicky that he's probably hurting his team by being so 'manly' and playing on it.  Mailman had single digits again today (5 and 4) and 'Sheed just seems ready to abuse him at every chance.  Kobe makes an herioc game-tying shot in game 2, kills em in OT and is the hero once again.  Only 2 days later he's shot no baskets by halftime and gets held to 11 points for the whole game.  Kobe, an non-factor?  Shaq only got 14 shots all game.  Kareem Rush had 8.   What ?  And this:  No. 5 draft pick Dwyane Wade - starting point guard and hero in Miami all season and gets to the playoffs.  Largely regarded as a future star.  No. 3 draft pick Carmelo Anthony - universally hailed as a future stud after lifting the Nuggs from 17 wins all last season to the No.8 playoff seed this year.  No. 1 draft pick LeBron James - the King.  Now owns Cleveland.  Rookie of the year.  Starts every game he plays and at 18 is the team leader.  No. 2 draft pick Darko Milicic - sits all season on the bench.  Has played 159 minutes - all season.  A season goes for 82 games at 48 minutes a game.  That 159 out of a possible 3936 minutes.  Let's say he's been unsed sparingly, ok?  Well, 2 more Detroit wins and he gets fitted for an NBA championship ring.  LeBron, 'Melo and Dwyane must be laughing their heads off about that one!  Note - Darko got 2 minutes in today's game, so he's earned it, OK?

      A few years ago I had the old box of tapes in the car.  95% of my good stuff was on CD but I still had a few things on tape that I hadn't got around to replacing.  Anyway, I was living in North Hobart at the time and one night, some mongrel broke into my car and took the box of tapes!  There was nothing else of value in the car, so they took my tapes!!  How much would they have been worth?  The only tape to survive (and hence the only tape I own now) was the soundtrack to the movie 'Beat Street'.  It's a crap tape except for Beat Street Breakdown, which is still streets better that half the cRAP that's released nowadays.  Why am I telling you all this?  Well, Sanity had a sale on today, including CDs in blank cases for $7.  I managed to re-purchase Let Love In by Nick Cave and Greatest Misses by Public Enemy.  Woo hoo!  I'm on an express train to 1990 baby!  They had some other stuff that I almost purchased just to give to needy musical ears.  Imagine picking up OK Computer for $7!!!  I'm off to listen to Janglin Jack!

      First up, the Garrett thing.  This is why I, and an increasing number in the community are becoming disillusioned with the federal Liberal Party.   urlLink What's actually happened with Peter Garrett's votes  is something that I suspect only he knows.  Anyone else, and this wouldn't be an issue.  But the fact that it's a prominent Australian who is seeking to enter into political life, and the Libs all of a sudden get their snipers out to shoot him down.  We have the PM going on radio saying he (i.e. Garrett) is obviously "not very passionate", with his school headmaster look firmly fixed for the cameras (those radio cameras come in handy, eh?).  We have Eric Abetz, Special Minister of Spin, calling for a full enquiry to be conducted into Garrett's voting past, and calling for Garrett to "release his enrolment and voting record since 1994."  Now fair dinkum - if this isn't political snipery at it's best then what is?    I wonder what I would do if he called on me to do that - I don't have a voting record tied up in string to release to anyone.  I go to the booth, I vote.  The record of my vote goes in the box, the record that I turned up is kept by the AEC.  What do I have to release to anyone?      You've got a problem with the electoral roll, Eric?  Concerned that not all votes are being counted?  Then audit the  entire damn electoral roll , or the enrolment system.  Don't waste our money or time with your attempts to shoot down one of your political opponents.  If Garrett didn't vote - fine him.  Like anyone else would get fined.  It doesn't preclude him from running for office, does it? So shut up with the sniping.  It doesn't change my mind about his value to this country.  We're talking about a man who has consistently advocated peace, disarmament, environmental responsibility and reconciliation and somehow these have become ideals that must be shot down before they're allowed to enter the parliament.  In other Abetz news -  urlLink The Mercury run a story this morning  that he's signing off on a 3.5 million dollar contract for the provision of Aussie Flags to the Government.  Senators and members will then be able to give the flags out to community groups so that we can fly the flags and display our patriotism.   Flying the flag at every occasion should be vigorously promoted, says patriotic senator, Eric Abetz....."It sends a strong message about Australia.  Oatlands in Tasmania tends to fly the flag a lot, and it is great when you drive through and see the flags flying"   What's next?  Government sponsored yellow ribbons to tie around government sponsored old oak trees?

      The good news story of the day....  Just got an email from an old workmate of mine who's started a new job with the Tasmanian Cricket Association.  She's working for Boonie!  Dead Set Legend!  Imagine spending your 8-hour day with an Aussie legend, at one of the most picturesque cricket grounds in Australia - and getting paid for it!  She even gets into all games at Bellerive Oval for nix!  Cool.  I've suggested she don a false moustache, steal his keys and take the Boonie-Beamer over the bridge at 150k's, but she's reluctant.  Always nice to hear good things happening to friends.

      The continuing saga inside the mind of a swinging voter….  It looks like  urlLink Peter Garrett is all set for preselection  in Kingsford Smith, despite the protests of local Labor poobahs.    It is interesting that  urlLink he hasn’t been registered to vote for 10 years .  Can’t say I’m overly impressed by that fact.  The guy does want to play a part in the political process doesn’t he?  Shouldn’t he have played the simplest of parts in the last 10 years by enrolling to vote?  Embarrassing?  A little.  Damaging?  Not really.  It’s being fixed prior to formalities being entered into, which is better than what Pauline Hanson managed.  I expressed my initial views on the potential recruitment of Garrett  urlLink here .  To summarise, whilst I am hesitant about high profile candidates being gifted a seat, the recruitment does fill a hole in Latham’s progressive ticket.  The more I’ve thought about this, the more I like it.  One of the things I’ve come to like about Mark Latham’s leadership is the fact that he seems to value the important grass-roots issues without applying the gloss of reputations or salesmanship so often trowelled on by the incumbent government (viz Johnny’s appearances with Dubya last week).  My impression is one of an Australian striving to advance Australian interests and putting a great deal of importance on Australia growing within it’s own identity.  I get no impression that Latham would jeopardise our alliance with the United States.  I get some impression that John Howard would like to imply jeopardy as a potential outcome.  Same with George Bush.  Latham has stated unequivocally that the alliance with the United States is one of superior importance to Australia, and let's remember that it's not insignificant to the US as well.  To this point, read some sensible commentary (finally!) from a right-wing blog, which has some convincing and non-snarking information about this issue.  Scroll down and read MarkL’s (pure coincidence, I’m sure) comments  urlLink here  at Blair’s house.  The impression I do get from Latham is that Australia will preserve this important relationship, but not because we’re the US’s pet and were simply trained to do so.  Australia can, and should, act in step with this alliance wherever possible, but we also have the sovereign right to form our own foreign policy and disagree with Uncle Sam from time to time.  I believe that Latham is all for Australia growing up some more and being willing to say what we believe without having to consider what The Man will make of it first, which is the impression I get from Howard, Downer & Co at the moment.  Input Peter Garrett to the mix.  Another independent thinker, who I reckon scares Labor as much the Libs at this initial point.  ‘Big Red’ Lennon, our Premier here in Tassie, was on the radio last night saying how he has no worries about Garrett becoming an MP.  He will have to abide by Labor forestry policy if he gets in, so where’s the issue?  You could almost see him looking over his shoulder as he said it.  Fact is, Garrett represents another infusion of fresh ideas into a party that was largely indistinguishable (to the average punter such as myself) from the Libs when they floundered under Crean’s leadership.  Whilst Garrett’s ideas on the environment might be way left of the current Labor position, his motives are true, he’s articulate and thoughtful and his input will inject some real life and expertise into the debate, and this can only be for the good.  My only remaining worry about Latham getting in – Crean in charge of the national wallet.

      Just lifted this from  urlLink ESPN's Marc Stein :   The latest evidence that Los Angeles is more of a Laker town than ever before in the city's history came in Sunday's Los Angeles Times, which contained two special sections. There was a 12-pager devoted to the passing of former president Ronald Reagan, who also served as California's governor ... and a 44-pager to preview the NBA Finals.   Forty-four.   Yeah baby!  It's the NBA finals, reminds me of Ronnie's finest acting job - "When two tribes go to war..."

      Well, I had a post all ready to go in the event that the Lakers (who I'd re-name 'The Lackers') lost game 2 of the NBA finals.  Instead, Kobe's managed to extract the digit and pull L.A. out of playoff hell, salvaging a win to tie the series at 1-1.  Now they've got to get a win in Detroit.  How about Luke Walton's game, huh?  And will someone get the defribulators on to Gary Payton?    I hope someone I know taped this one.  I'm currently watching a tape of the 1990 All-Star game.  Awesome.  Magic, Michael, Bird, Olajuwon, Drexler, Pippen, Ewing, Mullin, Barkley, Stockton, Parish, McHale, KJ, and a rookie by the name of David Robinson.  Hoops heaven.    UPDATE  :  One of the problems with not seeing the games here is that whilst you might marvel at a shot like Kobe's to tie this game, you don't see what led to the shot.    Apparently Shaq had the ball on the last play.  Now, this is a big thing.  The Lakers are down by 3 with 10 seconds to go and Shaq has the ball.  He's made one 3-pointer in his whole career and shoots 53% from the foul line.  Memo to Big Ben Wallace: FOUL HIM!  Put him on the line.  He makes one out of 2 (maybe), you're still up by 2 points and you have posession.  You have possession, great free-throw shooters and about 8 seconds between you and a 2-0 lead in the NBA finals with 3 games to play  at home .  David Aldridge at ESPN provides the whole scene  urlLink here , in an article espousing why Larry Brown's Pistons might still overcome this loss to take game 3, and maybe win the series.

       urlLink CNN have realeased details of a poll  conducted by a Saudi national security consultant in 2003.  Of the 15,000 people polled, almost half approved of the sermons and rhetoric put forward by Osama Bin Laden.  Thankfully, the numbers drop dramatically with regard to approval of Al Qaeda's attacks, some of which have taken place in Saudi Arabia, and less than 5% thought he should rule the Arabian peninsula.  Wouldn't this all be pie-in-the-sky if Dubya had hunted him down in the first place rather than taking on the irrelevant, soft target in Iraq?

      In consideration of recent questions posed at the  urlLink Road to Surfdom , I noted with some interest that the 50th anniversary of the ANZUS treaty was marked by a  urlLink joint statement  between the United States and Australia thus:   President George W. Bush and Prime Minister John Howard today commemorated the 50th anniversary of the U.S.-Australia alliance.  The two leaders reaffirmed that the alliance is an alliance between two peoples, tied by bonds of law and language, united by a history of shared struggle and sacrifice in defense of freedom and democracy, and finding new strength in the challenges of a changing world.  The President and the Prime Minister agreed that for fifty years, the friendship between the United States and Australia has advanced the cause of stability and security within the Asia-Pacific region and indeed throughout the world. The aspirations we have shared, for peace and prosperity for all, remain as firmly held as ever.   The statement reaffirming our buddy status was dated September 10, 2001.  24 hours later the alliance would be put to the test as jets were flown into the World Trade Centre buildings, the Pentagon and thankfully, a field in Pennsylvania where the loss of life was restricted to those aboard the jet.  It's been easy to view the commitment between Australia and the US through a narrow filter taking in only recent events in Iraq.  On that score, I believe that Prime Minister Howard has taken our country on a journey based on loyalty, but hampered by blindness, some of which was caused by either poor or even 'sexed-up' intelligence, and some of which takes root in our need to unequivocally support our mates in a fight.  The precursor to all this though, was September 11.  To look and judge only on the Iraq conflict without considering the events of that day is to do somewhat of a disservice.  On that day, enemies of Western society took an action that could not be ignored, and thankfully, wasn't.  The War on Terror (TM) began and countries all around the world were galvanised in their commitment to rooting out and eliminating the perpetrators of this unprecedented attack.  Afghanistan was invaded and the Taliban displaced - all good and right things as the evidence pointing to their protection of OBL was clear and known to all.  Mullah Omar - exit stage left.  Enter Saddam.  And this is where the whole thing turns pear-shaped.  A lot of countries expressed considered skepticism about the plan to attack Iraq.  Evidence of WMD looked good on a powerpoint presentation to the UN but hard evidence was thin on the ground and many countries were OK with coming out and saying so.  They took a kicking for doing so but I suspect that time will respect them for exercising their independent thought and thereby not accepting the US's reasons for invading Iraq.  The main question at issue here is What levels of honesty to we demand from our political leadership?  You see, I have no problem with Saddam being in custody and out of power.  I sincerely hope that Iraq will be better off without him, despite  urlLink the turmoil that seems to be ongoing there .  What I  do  have a problem with is the dishonesty with which the case for war was presented to the public.  It's a problem for me that my country's leadership never seemed to publicly question the intentions of the US or seek consultation with countries that did dissent, as to why they dissented.  We don't have a huge intelligence capacity here so we just relied - lock, stock and barrel - on information provided by our big cousins.  To summarise - Afghanistan was right.  It was based on clear evidence and supported widely throughout the world.  It was a consequence of Afghani support for an act of terror committed against the citizens of the United States.  Iraq was wrong.  It was based on dodgy evidence, supported by few and whilst it was officially the consequence of Saddam breaching some UN resolutions, the realities of oil reserves, geopolitical strategy and a good old family grudge loom large over the whole operation.  And this is my current problem with Mr Howard.  His total, unequivocal, unquestioning loyalty to the ideals of George W. Bush.  Thankfully, with the passing of these two men, the nature of their relationship will pass also.  No matter the color of the government in power, as long as both countries remain as democracies, the relationship will continue and both countries will benefit.    The current views on Australia's role as espoused by Mark Latham are, I think, a refreshing expression showing a willingness to think independently whilst still respecting the relationship and its foundations.  Prior to our jumping into Iraq, Australia had displayed signs of a growing maturity within international circles.  We were emerging within Asia as an economically and politically stable partner.  We were able to play a major role in the emancipation of East Timor.  We rightly supported and participated in the war in Afghanistan.    These weren't "tough-guy" decisions.  These were mature decisions based on what constitutes right and wrong in the sphere of international relations.  These were the decisions that a mature, thinking country makes.  In making the decision to follow Bush on his pre-emptive-of-nothing tough guy mission, John Howard became the 'Man of Steel' in the mind of the President, but unfortunately for Johnny, the President doesn't vote here.    I'm not sure that the alliance between these men is enough on its own to sway voters away from John Howard, but it's a significant factor in how people perceive him and their willingness to listen to, accept and absorb policy.  As domestic affairs regain their importance in preference to international affairs, this will become a significant factor to a hamstrung government.  I think the US-Australia alliance is a good thing.  We share a cultural heritage, language and a love for our free way of life.  Each allows the other access to friendships and developments that are of real value to both parties.  We can share economic markets and open doors to trade that will benefit both parties.  But the US-Australia alliance should never become the bottom line of our international relations.  We should pursue relationships with China, Indonesia and Europe that parallel our commitment to the US, however Mr Howard seems to value our place in the mind of the President more than anything.  Previous governments have recognised the significance of Asia and our role in the region.  I seem to recall a growing acceptance of Australia as part of the Asian region in the past. That recollection seems to fade with each joint appearance by the "Two Dubya's".

      When I saw the headline, I thought of Jeff, small forward for the Freo Dockers, but alas...  ...from the "this shouldn't be funny" files:  The farmer is involved in a  urlLink bungled getaway from a drug lab raid  on a trail bike.    The trail bike's rider, understood to be Mr Bourke, was found a short time later with a self-inflicted wound.   He was airlifted to Gympie General Hospital by the Sunshine Coast Energex rescue helicopter before being transferred to Royal Brisbane Hospital where he was last night in a critical condition, being treated for a gunshot wound through the eye into his head.   Mr Bourke was sent to jail in July, 2002, after pleading guilty to charges arising from hiding more than $1 million worth of stolen heavy machinery on his rural property.   The case made headlines when a prime mover, a crane, trucks and other items worth a total of $1,127,500 were found on or around Mr Bourke's farm - many of them buried.   [...]   In another twist to the family saga, Mr Bourke's older brother, Wayne Charles Bourke, was jailed for two years in October, 2002, after being found guilty on counts of stealing, unlawful use and receiving after a botched attempt to steal an excavator in 2001.   The $250,000 excavator, which had been loaded on to a prime mover and trailer stolen from a Main Roads Department depot at Stapleton, clipped an overhead bridge on Brisbane's outskirts during the attempted getaway, causing more than $50,000 damage.

      The artist-formerly-known-as- urlLink J-Lo has married  after a six month fling.  It seems like just last week that Bennifer was still on again/off again.   urlLink One President dies , dominates the news, and a an ex-PM  urlLink pinches a headline  of his own.   urlLink Hugh plays Peter and gets Tony .   urlLink David Flint resigns  whilst the PM is overseas and hence can't check with Jonesy if it's OK.  Two former Carlton players in Beaumont and Murphy now blue whilst playing for other teams....Dermott Brereton assures us that he had  urlLink nothing to do with it :   The suggestion that I was responsible for sparking Saturday's melee is ridiculous, and yesterday's news media reports to that effect were wildly inaccurate.   ...then effectively admits that he had something to do with it:   What I did say was pretty typical stuff for a football director. As a couple of the younger players and a couple of our leaders went past me on their way back on to the ground, I quite calmly said: "Don't let Essendon physically put anything over you or your teammates again, let's draw a line in the sand."   I can almost imagine the Zen-like state of the rooms at halftime as you said the words, Dermott.  By the way, if you didn't see the fight, it was a corker!

      There was news over the weekend that Midnight Oil frontman, Peter Garrett, may stand for preselection in the safe Labor seat of Kingsford Smith.  This was greeted with mixed feelings in the blogosphere.  Tim Dunlop  urlLink expressed caution  and I agree somewhat with the scepticism over celebs being delivered in safe seats.  Over at the  urlLink Backpages , 'Capers' makes the interesting point that if these people are such vote-attractors, then why do they need a safe seat in order to get into Parliament?   urlLink Mark Latham is 'tickled pink'  over the notion of the bald bard suiting up for Labor.   "Peter Garrett is certainly an idealistic person and we need more of that in federal politics," he said on Channel 9.  "We need more idealism, people who want to do big things for the country, particularly on important issues such as the environment."   And that, I reckon, is the key.    National security and international relations are emerging issues in the unofficial-election-campaign-not-quite-underway-yet.  The government, whether it likes it or not, is vulnerable on Iraq and our non-questioning loyalty to the US.  Nobody's mentioned a particular breed of dog yet, but there are some thoughts brewing a-la Blair being Bush's poodle.  Perhaps Johnny would be his Shih-Tzu? As much as Johnny would like the focus to be on economic management, that seems to be a backseat issue at the moment (probably because all is going relatively well).  The nation isn't fearing too much economic woe in the medium term, so the spotlight heads to the other issues of life and the world we live in.    One of those issues, only a small blip on the radar but gathering momentum, is environmental management.  There were  urlLink protests in Melbourne  over the weekend, attracting more than 10,000 people, regarding the logging of old-growth forests here in Tasmania.  I've a feeling that Marky Mark is sensitive to the electorate on the issue and the drafting of Garrett gives Labor some instant cred on environmental issues.  Logging is a sensitive issue as it involves not only the protection of nationally significant forests, but also the livelihoods of thousands of people in the industry.    It's going to be a delicate path for Manboobs to walk.  Being a Labor pollie and trying to be protective of the forests down here is going to lead him head-on into a tiff with local Labor.  The forestry industry in Tassie is basically a state-supported monopoly with Gunns Ltd the benefactors.  Tasmanian Premier, Paul 'Big Red' Lennon, is an unashamed Gunns supporter and won't take too kindly to being told what to do in his own patch.  It's not confirmed whether he is a Midnight Oil fan or not.  Interestingly, Lennon has recently sold his house in the 'burbs and gone bush.  So on one hand, we may end up with federal Labor trying to woo the green vote with restrictions on logging precious areas such as the Styx and the Blue Tier, and on the other we have state Labor, who may have already ordered a new conference table to made from a Styx Valley eucalypt.  I'd love to see Latham, Lennon, Garrett and the Greens all sorting it out over a beer and a ciggie in the Premier's lounge.

      In local news, the idea of development is once again stomped on by local pensioners and tree hugging wilderness freaks.  Fair dinkum, it's a wonder that photographers can even get a film developed here in Tasmania.  If you've never heard of Crescent Bay, then you're not alone.  Seems like hardly anyone has, but as soon as someone  urlLink plans to slap a tourist-oriented attraction  there, all of a sudden it's written up as being as precious as a diamond and more picturesque than our most photographed beach, Wineglass Bay.  (Binalong Bay is Tassie's best spot, by far)  Surely the ferrets that live nearby should realise that a well planned, properly designed attraction of well defined scope will bring bucks into the area whilst making little environmental impact.  The experience at Wineglass should tell them that.  Local Richard Briggs is opposed to the development.  Seems his brother sold the proposed developers the land parcel as it was "useless, unsuitable for farming and useless for development as it was zoned for coastal protection".  Dick wants to hand the land over to his kiddies as there's been 3 generations who have been able to enjoy walking to the beach from there.  Big deal!  They can still walk to the beach, only now they'll be able to get a drink along the way.  Apparently the local council will have to rezone the land to allow the proposal.  Here's hoping th vocal locals get drowned out in a flood of common sense.  Jugheads.

      I love AFL footy.  Even when Carlton lose I love AFL footy.  Unlike Eddie Maguire, I don't need to struggle with my objectivity - I have none; I love Carlton and will be unashamedly biased in their favour.  So it was great to see the Blue Boys rise up, 7 goals to 2 in the final quarter, to beat Adelaide at AAMI Stadium on Saturday arvo.  Bloody brilliant.  Fevola booted 7 goals, including a monster from the boundary line to finally put us in front.  The Blues have struggled for a few years so a win like this one is something to be used as inspiration for the future.  I imagine we'll be struggling for a few years to come, but a big win like this (esp after a 100+ point thrashing last week) gives some hope.  Next week we play Hawthorn, who managed to get themselves in the papers again this weekend, but for all the wrong reasons.  They lost by 74 points to Essendon, but even that's not close to being a headline.  The big story for the Hawks was the fight with the Bombers in the 3rd quarter.  Saw it on the footy show this morning and believe me, there will be some suspensions and fines to pay from this one.    The best part was seeing Justin Murphy (E) and Simon Beaumont (H) going at one another.  Both are former Carlton players.  Beaumont is an absolute goose.  Every team has a player like Beauie from time to time.  As soon as he gets his hands on the ball, you know his skill errors or poor decision making are going to see the ball into the opposition hands within 2 posessions.  In the early 90s for Carlton it was Mark Athorn.  Later, Beaumont came along and it was Athorn all over again.  Hopefully Murph let him know exactly how crap a backman he was prior to giving him the 'Liverpool Kiss' and planting a nice right-handed haymaker.  Expect a few weeks for both players.  The big individual loser will be Richard Vandanberg, who was laying in like there was no tomorrow.  Mark up win number five for the Blues next week.  Relating to the Eddie Maguire barb at the top of the column, seems Eddie has been measured and found wanting.  Unfortunately I can't find a link, but an article in today's Sunday Tasmanian quoted an RMIT study, which analysed a couple of Eddie's commentaries of Collingwood games.   If you're unfamiliar with AFL, Eddie is the omnipresent media king at Channel 9 and Collingwood Football Club president.  Actually, if you're unfamiliar with AFL football, how have you made it this far into the column?  Surprise, surprise - it seems Eddie shows a bias towards favourable Collingwood commentary when calling Collingwood in Friday night games on Channel 9.  In calling a Collingwood vs Brisbane game in April, Maguire made 18 pro-Collingwood calls about unpiring decisions vs no pro-Brisbane calls.  In a separate examination by News Ltd of last Friday's Coll vs WCE game, he mentioned Collingwood 27 more times than West Coast (19 extra mentions in the 2nd quarter alone) and umpiring comments were 9 to 1 in favour of the Maggies.  To quote Dr June Senyard from Melbourne Uni:    "He continually puts the Collingwood brand name out there."   No kidding.

      Apparently  urlLink Ronnie flipped his slippers today , aged 93.  A biography as printed in The Age follows:   During his long but unremarkable Hollywood career, the suave actor churned out 59 films, including his best remembered movie in which he starred opposite a chimpanzee called Bonzo.   Reagan spent 27 years as a radio sports commentator until he was noticed by a Warner Bros agent who arranged for a screen test that led to a studio contract and his first movie, Love is on the Air (1937).   In two years, he made 18 films. In only one did he play a villain and that was in his last movie, The Killers (1964), in which he slapped US actress Angie Dickinson around.  Though he never made major star status, he did play with great actors such as Humphrey Bogart, Edward Robinson, James Cagney, Errol Flynn and beauties like Bette Davis, Olivia de Havilland, Ginger Rogers and Barbara Stanwyck.  He also played opposite some puckish characters like Shirley Temple in That Hagen Girl (1947) as well as with his simian screen partner in Bedtime for Bonzo (1951).  With his tall stature, clear voice and winning smile, Warner studios tried unsuccessfully to cast him as the new Robert Taylor, a 1930s and 40s matinee idol.  Two films stand above the rest in Reagan's long filmography.   In Knute Rockne - All American, (1940) he took on the role of dying football hero George Gipp who spurred his team with a line that went on to become Reagan's political rallying call: ''Win one for the Gipper.''  And in Kings Row (1942), Reagan played a playboy who wakes up in a hospital bed after a sadistic surgeon cut off his legs and asks: ''Where's the rest of me?'' a line which became the title of his 1965 autobiography.    Apparently he was also a politician of some note, but it's the weekend and I don't feel like writing about politics.  Of his film career, I will say I particularly like his starring role in the  urlLink Frankie Goes to Hollywood  film clip for "Two Tribes".

      Little Johnny went to Washington for a pep talk today.  Seems he got in George's ear about how that pesky bully, Mark Latham, was planning to withdraw Australia's military commitment to Iraq.  Big Brother George got out his War-On-Terror (tm) Thesaurus/Speech guide and let  urlLink Marky Mark know about it .  On Latham's idea to have troops home by Christmas:    "It would say that the Australian Government doesn't see the hope of a free and democratic society (in Iraq), leading to a peaceful world. It would embolden the enemy who believe that they can shake our will. You see, they want to kill innocent lives because they think that the Western world and the free world is weak, that when times get tough we would shirk our duty to those who long for freedom," Mr Bush said.    To quote virtually all RWDB's out there...."yawn".  Dubya seems to trot out the same old patriotic crap everytime he opens his piehole.  I reckon if he were to suffer a vomitous reminder of the freedom fries he had for lunch, the evidence would be red, white and blue.  He farts the 'Star Spangled Banner'.  Here's a hint for you, George - nobody thinks the West is weak.  The terrorists think you're a camel's anus. Your 'allies' are actually in your corner, but those without uniforms in their closets think that whilst the US is a great place to visit, maybe you and yours are just a little misguided and stupid sometimes (but you're entertaining).  Well, Manboobs has a right of reply, so  urlLink reply he did :   Mr Latham said the Government's failed policies were hurting Australia in five ways.  He said they had made Australia bigger terrorist target and diverted resources from the real war on terror.  The prisoner abuse scandal had given the terrorists a significant win while the government had sent young Australians to war to find weapons of mass destruction that didn't exist.  "The war in Iraq and instability in the Middle East have contributed to record high petrol prices that are now hurting Australian motorists," he said.    Points for 'diversion of resources' and 'missing WMD's'.  Half points for 'terror target' and 'abuse scandal'.  'Petrol prices' was silly, Mark.  Lift your game, please.  What Latham did say that made real sense was that Australia's withdrawal of troops does not signal the end of our support for the reconstruction of Iraq. We created some of this mess, so it's only fair that we fix some of it.   "In these circumstances the best role Australia can play in Iraq is through humanitarian, economic and civilian aid, not a long term military role," he said.   This seems to me to be a sensible stance.  Support in practical ways that will be crucial in the rebuilding of Iraq, without exposing our diggers on the ground unnecessarily.  Latham also expresses a desire to preserve the US-Aus relationship, despite disagreement on troops in Iraq,   "The alliance is bigger and stronger than the mistakes made in relation to Iraq," he said.   "I look forward to the day when we can put the mistakes of Iraq behind us and a Labor government can work with the United States to further strengthen the intelligence, strategic and cultural relationships between our two countries.   "Labor strongly supports the alliance but not as a rubber stamp. Nothing President Bush has said today changes our hopes and expectations about the future."   A sentiment I didn't hear from Bush.   Postscript :  other than being there when Dubya spat his dummy, note how none of these stories are about John Howard.

      Let me put my Tim Blair Hat on for a moment......  It would seem that lying President, George Bush, is now  urlLink catering to the demands  of those he once sought to spank.   President Bush deleted the word "crusade" — considered an inflammatory reference by Muslims — on Wednesday as he recalled Gen. Dwight Eisenhower's message to Allied troops before the D-Day invasion at Normandy, France, 60 years ago.  [...]  In that message, Eisenhower said: "Soldiers, sailors and airmen of the Allied Expeditionary Force! You are about to embark upon the Great Crusade, toward which we have striven these many months. The eyes of the world are upon you. The hopes and prayers of liberty-loving people everywhere march with you."    Bush quoted Eisenhower's greeting, omitted the next sentence with the words "Great Crusade" and picked up with the line, "The eyes of the world are upon you."    Bush has been careful to avoid the word "crusade." In September 2001, he said through his spokesman that he regretted using the word, with all its historical connotations of religious war by Christians against Muslims, to describe his campaign against terrorists.   Careful indeed.  Wouldn't want to offend these guys with speeches, would we?

      Just checked ESPN this morning, all this stuff going around about whether Kobe or Rip Hamilton will dominate the  urlLink LA-Detroit Finals series , starting Sunday.  Are they kidding!?  Talk about searching high and low for a headline.    Rip Hamilton runs all day.  He's the energiser bunny of basketball and went on a scoring tear against the Pacers.  Problem: he's about as strong as a strand of cotton soaked in starch.  Against Indiana he spent most of his time running past Reggie Miller, who at 37 isn't quite the athlete that Kobe is.  Kobe is going to tear Hamilton to shreds.  Stephen Smith on ESPN Motion talks about Rip running around to get his open shots, but it ain't so easy to get good screens past Shaq and Mailman.  Yeah, one's an O'Neal but that's about all Shaq and J-O have in common, and the other Laker in the paint ain't exactly a Jeff Foster (even if he is 40 years old).  Good luck Rip.  RIP.  The real battles to watch in this series will be the Wallaces against Shaq and Malone.  In particular Malone vs Rasheed.  Machismo vs Schizo!  'Sheed is going to be taunting him about his age, how much he can't jump anymore and all sorts of crap just to get in his head and Big Karl won't be backing off an inch.  Look for the tech count in this matchup.  In  urlLink another NBA story , I saw a headline saying Knick forward, Thomas, was heading in to surgery.  I thought it might be Tim Thomas heading for brain surgery after having a crack at Kenyon Martin during the playoffs, but turns out it was Kurt Thomas, getting some quack work on his hand.

      Illiteration is a wonderful thing.  Anyway, reports drifting in that  urlLink CIA boss George Tenet has chucked it in .    "Today, George Tenet, the director of the CIA submitted a letter of resignation," Bush said in a hastily convened public appearance on the South Lawn of the White House. "I accepted his letter [then I danced, sang and took his picture off my dartboard]."   The CIA has copped some flak in recent years:    The CIA's reputation has suffered several blows under Bush, including the failure to detect plotting for the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.  In the run up to the war in Iraq, hawkish conservatives accused the agency of not being aggressive enough in its assessment of Saddam Hussein's supposed weapons of mass destruction.   War and politics are wierd beasts, huh?  Here we are all going off at Dubya for starting a war over WMDs that don't exist, and Dubya's hawks are going off at the CIA for not being tough enough on WMDs that don't exist.   I have a feeling that Tenet's personal reasons include having to wash hawk-droppings off his shoulder on a regular basis.

       urlLink The US and Britain are co-sponsoring a resolution  that will seek to "confer legitimacy on Iraq's new interim government and the continued presence of U.S.-led foreign forces after the occupation ends June 30."  This is good:   Several Security Council countries want more specifics in the resolution on the U.S.-led multinational force to ensure Iraq has the right to determine the length of its deployment and its mandate. They also want to spell out what the "return of full sovereignty" means to ensure that the U.S.-led occupation ends, U.N. sources say.    This is not so good:    "With this draft, the Americans have come a long way, but there is no pool of trust," said a senior U.N. diplomat familiar with the discussions who requested anonymity because of ongoing discussions.   Some countries are "not saddened" to see the United States squirming to get international backing for its plan to hand over political power June 30. Although the Security Council wants concessions, some also want to see the Bush administration "suffer," the official said.    Come on lads, play nicely please.  It's not your comfy UN office that's at stake here.

      Nice to see  urlLink River  posting again from Baghdad...  Congrats to Aussie Jen Hawkins,  urlLink Miss Universe ....lets hope there's no Klingon chicks that disagree with the decision...  Had a great gig last night at the Prince of Wales here in Hobart.  Rearranged all the tunes unplugged style.  Discovered a whole new way to play...  John Howard looks silly on his  urlLink power walks .  He should get a treadmill and just stay indoors...  Talking Footy is going to continue its demise as a relevant football show for as long as they retain Steve Price on staff.  I'll say it again, the guy is a muppet, a caricature of real life...send Channel 7 an email to get rid of him by clicking  urlLink here ...  Congrats to Michael Moore for securing  urlLink distribution for Farenheit 9/11 .  Big hat tip to the Weinstein brothers for having the cajoles to finance distribution.  Let's see if " urlLink nobody will see his movie " as claimed on Blair's blog...  UPDATE:   urlLink Paul and Carl have the best take on Johnny's visit to Cali , which apparently has nothing to do with LPG and whole lot more to do with acting...

      Tim Dunlop has posted a query on  urlLink The Road to Surfdom  as to why people might vote for Mark Latham at the upcoming Australian elections coming later this year.  Note - why vote  for  Latham as opposed to voting  against  John Howard.  I'm  urlLink on record  recently as saying I'm not sure I want Howard replaced as PM.  Those reasons given were pretty selfish, based on the current good fortune I and my family enjoy in the current climate.  Personally, the status quo is good  for us .  Given that confession, I'm still considering my vote, based on the good of the country and my own sense of what's right and what's wrong.  So what areas do I think Latham has impressed with?  Education.  I'm not a teacher but I work in the education sector, as does my wife.  Specifically, she works with adults who can't read and write (and you can pretty much forget about 'rithmetic).  We have kids coming through our education system now that will be around third generation unemployed and third or fourth generation illiterate.  Latham's policy on reading programs for adults and kids sounds so simple that it's open to ridicule.  I even made a joke of it  urlLink here  out of my own frustration at his budget reply.  It is a serious issue, however.  Literacy levels in this country have been in steady decline for years now.  My nephews are 10-13 years younger than I, and the writing skills required of them as they completed matriculation were way below the bar set when I was at school.  The level of literacy has been on a downhill trend for a seriously long time.   As simple as Latham's policy sounds, the solution is quite simple.  Show people the importance of reading.  The ability to comprehend and discuss.  Give people the chance to discover things about themselves.  My wife sees this happen regularly within the literacy program that she runs.  Forty year-olds that initially can barely spell only their name and address get genuinely excited when they receive their first library card!  Young Dads that can finally read to their toddler kids.    This may seem like small stuff but it has a trickle-down effect and it is fundamental to our future workforce.  What are the countries with the highest literacy levels in the world and how is their standard of living?  Sweden, Canada, Netherlands, Germany, US.  All countries with relatively high standards of living and all with the highest literacy levels ( urlLink 1995 figures ).   urlLink More recent OECD surveys  include New Zealand, Australia and Ireland amongst the most frequent readers, but this area is something that needs to be maintained, and at the moment I fear it's slipping.  Latham's Labor seems to have offered me an enticing carrot in their education ideas.  Affordable, effective life-long learning is an investment, not a cost.  The attraction is compounded by Brendan Nelson's cynical $700 offer for literacy tutoring, but only if the states meet the government's demands re: reporting of literacy levels.  I agree that states should report more on literacy levels, but to withhold the funds on this basis - the kids who need it are the main victims.  Surely there's another way to pressure the states into literacy reporting.  I guess this approach leads to another problem I have with the Liberals.  Latham represents to me a fresh opportunity to implement some good ideas and policies.  The amendments to parliamentary super were just a small example of his willingness to tackle some sacred cows that were protected by pollies in the past.  The Libs seem almost too comfortable in their leather chairs.  Jack-boot politics and policy.  Costello's smirk/yawn.  Arrogant payoffs to the affluent swing vote coupled with summary dismissal of issues that only eventually become important when they're pushed.....and pushed.....and pushed (e.g. PMs recent admissions to misleading re: Iraq prisoners)  I'm no political guru or detailed policy analyst.  I just like what I see when I see it, and am looking forward to seeing a few more of Labor's policy ideas.  In particular, I'm wanting to hear about social justice, environment, water policy and infrastructure.  I'm hoping that there can be something positive to vote for, instead of a whole bunch of things to vote against.

      I heard on the radio this morning the Little Johnny Howard is heading off for a trip to take in the US, UK and France.  The US trip will see Johnny meeting up with The Governator, Arnold Schwhatever.  Johnny and BHP Billiton chief Donny Argus are going to try and convince Arnie that Australia would be much in his debt if he'd allow us to build a big LPG platform 20 clicks off the coast of L.A.  Funny how The Age has a story, before he's even left, that the locals are saying  urlLink "thanks, but no thanks"  to the idea.  First up, they think it would be prime terrorist-bait.  Not out of the question in the risk-averse society we're becoming.  L.A. is a big city, and a LPG platform might make a decent sized blast.  Malibu council seems to think so, they voted unanimously against the idea.  The unmentioned second, pure unadulterated speculation on my part: couldn't Halliburton do something like this?  If not Halliburton, then surely Dubya's got some contacts in the mining business that would be well placed to build an LPG platform offshore!  "These damn Ossies tryin to play rooster in our henhouse?  Thanks to the courageous actions of our mining workers, this LPG will flow in freedom"  Maybe Johnny could challenge Arnie to an arm-wrestle for the rights?

      As I write, Kobe and co. are dismantling the Minnesota Timberwolves and preparing them for their summer holidays.  Looks like the Lakers will do it in 6.  That'll give Shaq n Kobe ring no.4, The Glove and the Mailman those all important, career-capping first rings, and most notably it will be ring number 10 for the Zen Master, Phil Jackson.  Mind you, you'd think Bubbles the chimp could get at least one with the personnel he's had at his disposal (MJ, Scottie, Rodman, Shaq, Kobe, Malone, Payton and Madsen).  I'm thinking now that the Pistons will take Indy out in 6 as well.  I predicted Indy in 7 early in the series, but that home loss in game 5 may have been the backbreaker for the Pacers.  The Pistons 'D' just seems to be too strong.  Combine that with Rip Hamilton's latest scoring streak and you've got a potent team.  So can the best defense in the game beat a great bunch of champion scorers and defenders?  There's an old saying about a champion team beating a team of champions.  You'd be pretty game to predict that in this case though.  Can Tayshaun Prince keep his playoff mojo working against the offensive juggernaut that is Kobe Bryant?  Can the two-headed Wallace dragon keep the Diesel from the basket?  Can any two mere mortals stop Shaq from doing whatever-the-damn-well-he-pleases?  This is what we have to look forward to over the next few weeks.  I think it's going to be a pretty good series, if it comes off.  The Pistons have been the best team in the East since the trade deadline, where they picked up Rasheed Wallace.  Whether they're good enough to quell the Lake-show at the business end of the season is another matter.    The Lakers are vunerable.  They only beat the Spurs on a pretty flukey shot with 0.4 seconds remaining.  If Fisher missed that shot, who know's what I'd be writing about today.  Perhaps the Lakers could have beaten the Spurs in 7, but I doubt it.  They're making pretty decent work of the Timberwolves.  The T-wolves have been courageous and the question will always be how much better they could have been with Sam-I-Am healthy, but as a Kings fan, I can tell all the Wolves fans first hand how many championships those questions will bring - none, zero.  They're vulnerable alright, but the Pistons are going to have to work it like crazy to take advantage of that vulnerability.  No predictions from me - I'm just going to enjoy the show.    Oh, OK, Lakers in 5.  UPDATE - as usual, I've opened my mouth too soon - Kobe has 3 ealy fouls and Shaq has 4 at halftime.  Wolves rallying as we speak.  Just sets up another dramatic Laker victory for the record books, eh?

      Perhaps this government of ours will learn the hard way that trying to put it over the people isn't appreciated.  I'll preface this with the admission that I'm not sure I want to see the removal of the Howard government from Canberra.  This is probably quite a selfish viewpoint to some extent.  I think they've managed well economically.  I and my family have prospered in that we have secure employment, the kids are fed, bedded and clothed.  We've purchased a home that's delivered a nice capital gain.  When things are this peachy, you're always reluctant for change.  So why would Mr Average Joe be willing to stomach the idea?  Because at some stage you've got to stand up and say that 'this is wrong'.  Despite the loss of stability that it might cost you.  The latest 'this' to apply to the above statement is the revelation that an Australian serviceman  urlLink did indeed visit Abu Ghraib  to investigate Red Cross reports of prisoner mistreatment.  This visit occurred on December 4, 2003.  Major George O'Kane, the officer in question, actually first visited Abu Ghraib in August 2003, then followed up with his visit in December after the Red Cross report came out in October.    Senator Hill has claimed in Parliament that he didn't know anything about prisoner abuse at all until he caught a CNN story in January.  Little Johnny has claimed several times that he knew nothing about the incidents until pictures started filtering through in April.  Check out his interview with Melbourne's Neil Mitchell  urlLink here at Crikey .  The PM's best defense seems to be a consistent Bart Simpson cry of 'we didn't do it, nobody saw anything, you can't blame me'.  News to the PM - NOBODY IS SAYING AN AUSTRALIAN ABUSED A PRISONER.  Can your interviewers say it any clearer, Mr Howard??  What people want is an honest answer about when the matters became known, and if you or your ministers, as representatives of us (i.e. the nation that, by a majority, elected you) did anything about it.    We'd like to think you did the right thing.  We'd like to think that an Australian saw prisoners being abused and was able to report it without that report being trashed, gagged or otherwise forgotten to save either your, or Dubya's, embarassment.  And if that did happen, we'd like the truth to come out.  This seems to be happening, only we have to get it from avenues not connected to you.  Its reported in The Age this morning that Major O'Kane won't be allowed to appear before the Senate enquiry currently underway.  His colleague, Air Commodore Simon Harvey, has appeared and revealed some information about the visits.   A senior Australian army officer visited Iraq's Abu Ghraib prison last year to investigate allegations of prisoner maltreatment, a Senate inquiry has heard, contradicting statements by the Prime Minister and defence chiefs.  Major George O'Kane, who visited the notorious prison five times, was yesterday barred from giving evidence to the Senate estimates hearing by Defence Minister Robert Hill.   But the head of the Defence Legal Service, Air Commodore Simon Harvey, told the hearing that Major O'Kane went to Abu Ghraib on December 4 to "address issues of mistreatment allegations" and draft a response to the Red Cross.  Defence officials confirmed that Major O'Kane received two Red Cross reports in October and November detailing mistreatment of Iraqi prisoners and later provided them to Australian officials.   The reasons for the December 4 visit were reported back to military commanders in Canberra, Air Commodore Harvey confirmed.    Perhaps Air Commodore Harvey would care to run for office?  Actually, I'm probably more of a Falcon man myself (if I had to choose an Australian car).  Point is, when is this government going to stop.  It's like they have a cancer and they don't want the kids to know, so they keep glossing things up, hoping they can beat it when what's most likely is they'll just drop off the twig.  The kids are more grown up than you believe Mr Howard.  We can handle the truth.  Can you?  UPDATE: It appears that the  urlLink Dept of Defence have discovered they misled the PM  by not providing all the information.  Gen Cosgrove and 'top official' Ric Smith have apologised unreservedly to the PM.  No word from Senator Hill, maybe he's sleeping with the fishes in Lake Burley Griffin?

       urlLink Australia cuts and runs     Air traffic controllers coming home: Hill   whilst the  urlLink French are the first to deploy troops .&nbsp;&nbsp;   French President Jacques Chirac this morning ordered the immediate mobilisation of French troops stationed in Chad because of the "seriousness of the humanitarian situation" in Darfur, just across the border.  "Without waiting for the response of the interational community the defence ministry" had taken several steps, including the deployment of an "observation force already in place"  See, spin is easy when you try. 25 million Republican dimwits can't be wrong.

      If you check out  urlLink Tim Blair's   urlLink contributions to the Reason blog-coverage of the Democratic National Convention in the US , you'd realise that there's obviously been nothing interesting to write about.&nbsp; Tim's posts are the usual snark without substance.&nbsp; They were initially so infrequent that I was wondering if he was really there.&nbsp; When he does post, it's usually pretty irrelevant anyway, save for the  urlLink applause points in John&nbsp;Kerry's speeches , which were actually relevant and interesting (an anomoly coming from Tim).&nbsp;  That pleased me as there are few things I'd like to see in this world more than the downfall of the Bush administration.&nbsp; It pleased me as the Dems had their act together and looked like a chance of coming off pretty well polished, unified and determined to send the Chimp in Chief back to spelling classes in Texas.   But it only takes one little thing.&nbsp; One little thing and they'll seize it and make the whole damn thing look rediculous.&nbsp; So what was the one thing?&nbsp;  urlLink The balloons .&nbsp; Or the lack thereof.&nbsp; They didn't seem to fall on Kerry's night of nights, and convention director Don Mischer got pretty flustered, as heard by millions on CNN:    'No confetti. No confetti yet. Go balloons. Go balloons. More balloons. All balloons. All balloons. Come on guys, let's move it," began a relatively calm Mr Mischer.&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon afterward however the DNC director begam to panic.     urlLink     "Jesus, we need more balloons. I want all balloons to go, goddamn. No confetti. No confetti. No confetti. I want more balloons. What's happening to the balloons? We need more balloons. We need all of them coming down... balloons.   Go balloons, balloons... what's happening balloons, there's not enough coming down. All balloons - where the hell - there's nothing falling,"   Mr Mischer said, before finally exploding: "What the f... are you guys doing up there?"   Oops.&nbsp; Sorry John.

Disappointed I'm not  urlLink in Japan  playing my bass. Glad to be moving to a more spacious office in the next few months. Loving my wife. Rapt to be off to Vancouver in the next 2 weeks! Sick of report writing. Happy with  urlLink reports on the Democratic National Convention . Wishing I could pound into  urlLink Bush-loving snarkers . Enjoying the lingering taste of 2-day old spaghetti (always better the 2nd day). Hoping for an election here in Oz soon. Dreading the Arts Tas grant application I have to write tonight. Loving the music  urlLink we 'll record when we get it.

      Sighted Marky Mark on 110% Tony Squires last night.&nbsp; I'm surprised it wasn't front page news as Mark made a derogatory joke about Dubya.&nbsp; They put a doctored photo on the screen that looked like a surprised George and a turkey, which happened to have its head lurking around the Pres' crotch.&nbsp; Mark made a quip about 'thanksgiving' that had them all in stitches.&nbsp; As I said, surprised it hasn't been set upon by the Libs and their media machine.   Speaking of George (and taking a line from Doc Holliday in 'Tombstone' - "Poker doesn't seem to be your game Ike, maybe...."), I'd like to see John Kerry challenge him to a spelling test.   Something I got from  urlLink Niall , you can  urlLink email Marky Mark here if you'd like Labor to vote against the FTA .&nbsp; Personally I think we've only been sold the shortened version of the FTA and I think the long term ramifications for this country are hidden in the detail.&nbsp; I've heard a few horror stories from Canada and Mexico about NAFTA and I think the same sorts of things could happen here (e.g. 9000 net lost jobs in the Canadian car industry).&nbsp; I believe that all the deals struck within this agreement are going to be geared well and truly in US's favour and with the PBS at stake here I'm not sure I want let it go without adding a voice.&nbsp; So I emailed him via the link.&nbsp; Feel free to do so too.   &nbsp;

       urlLink The real Mark Latham's website  went into overdrive when Aussie actress Rachel Ward intimated she was falling for the new Labor leader.&nbsp; Now  urlLink Toni Collette has indicated she has a fantasy vision involving the alternative PM  as well.  Ignoring the monotesticular truth about Marky, she's issued a challenge for him to prove he has the "balls" to reject the government's proposed Free Trade Agreement with the US.   "I think if Mark Latham said no to the FTA and got in, people would stand up and applaud him for just having the balls to be a visionary and not feel as though he is having to answer to somebody...If he is going to be a leader, he has to show that he can lead - that would be my  f  a  n  t  a  s  y "   emphasis added .  What is it with this guy?  More importantly though, what's going to happen with the FTA?&nbsp; There is increasing concern about certain important elements within the Agreement and the next sessions of Parliament will be interesting.&nbsp; When the FTA first came out it was pretty well received, but as time goes on and more people with the skills get to analyse the document, the more doubts there are coming to the surface.&nbsp; Surely the government isn't going to address them without provocation, so we'll be relying somewhat on Labor and others to bring this stuff to the surface.&nbsp; Hopefully we can get some straight questions and answers but I won't hold my breath (see post below "The way they do the things they do").

      Another post on my concerns over the communication methods used by the current government as this country moseys on up to the polling booths (deliberate Texan 'mosey' reference).    urlLink ABC news reports  on Senator Kate Lundy's concerns about the FTA, about which Labor is yet give an unqualified stance.&nbsp; Senator Lundy is worried that the FTA, as it currently stands, will not allow the Federal government to regulate local content on Australian TV and as such we'll be a whole bunch more Americanised as shows from the US get more airtime. At issue is not only the watering down of Australian culture but also the local TV production industry.   This is a fair concern and it should be fairly easy for Rod Kemp, Federal Arts Minister to lay Sen Lundy's concerns to rest.&nbsp; All he'd have to do is answer the concern by showing how the provisions of the FTA allow local content to retain its stature.&nbsp; Simple question and answer, right?   Mr Kemp's reponse:    He says Senator Lundy's comments show divisions within the Labor Party.  "They're trying to give mixed messages to different audiences," Senator Kemp said.  "To business audiences, I believe they're trying to give a message that they're supportive and some of their key spokesmen are saying that. Privately, at functions like this, they're giving a different message.  "This is a party in confusion over a major issue of public policy. The Labor Party and Mr Latham have now got to make a decision about where they stand," he said.  And pollies wonder why we get cynical when we can't even get a simple answer to what should be a simple question.&nbsp;   Mr Kemp, what is 2+2?&nbsp;    "Oh, I think the need to ask that question shows that there is obvious deep divisions within the Labor party.&nbsp; I think Mark Latham needs to come clean on what he thinks 2+2 really is and whether he had any sordid experiences with 2+2 when he was at school, on the bus, in a taxi, at uni, at Liverpool Council, at his ex-wife's birthday party or at any other time that may be of interest to the media, oops sorry, the electorate" &nbsp;   Aside:  "What do the Americans say it equals?"

      Alex had a go at Spain and the Phillipines the other day.&nbsp; Apparently their decisions to withdraw troops from Iraq have placed Australia firmly in the terrorist's sights.&nbsp; Now, regardless of whether I agree with decisions of the Spanish or Phillipino governments (which I don't),  what the hell is he on about ?  If Iraqi terrorist sympathisers are on our case, it's beacause we're involved in the conflict, not because others aren't.&nbsp; This is one of the crosses the PM is willing to bear and you have to as well Dolly.  The other interesting tidbit from  urlLink this morning's news on the argument :&nbsp; Spain and the Phillipines have had a go back at Dolly.&nbsp;   Spain described the comments as unacceptable, saying it withdrew from an unjust and illegal war in accordance with an election promise. Philippine national security adviser Norberto Gonzalez said Mr Downer was being "narrow-minded". Philippine President Gloria Arroyo yesterday rejected criticism in her State of the Nation speech. "The Philippines has no policy that demands sacrifice of human lives," she said. "I cannot apologise for being a protector of my people."   Then Kevin Rudd offered his opinion on Alex's tactics and all of a sudden, Big Al doesn't want to play.   Mr Downer declined to respond to the criticisms yesterday. His spokesman said he did not want to get involved in a slanging match.   So it's OK to start a slanging match, just don't get involved in it.&nbsp; The man from Mayo has got to go.

      How could they have got it SO wrong.   4 apartments were  urlLink autioned on The Block  over the weekend.&nbsp; All four had similar reserves, yet the downstairs apartments both outsold the upstairs by over at least $65,000.&nbsp; The 2 upstairs apartments had the highest reserves of $795K and $800K respectively, and only just managed to reach these prices...and no more.   I'm not sure what was more fun to watch, smart arse gay renovator and self confessed bitch&nbsp;Steven realising that he and boyfriend Richard had made exactly Zero dollars, or seeing new-age nutbag renovater Kirsten smack on the fakest smile ever seen on TV when they realised they'd been pipped by $1000 for the top prize.   Both sights made my night.&nbsp; But the real big story for the show is whether there'll be another one after what must be seen as a disastrously bad result.&nbsp; Let's face it, the thrill of the last series was not only seeing the people and the work, but also seeing the big profits come auction day.&nbsp; The hope that we, too, could do something up and make a good buck out of it.&nbsp; Two of these couples did all that hard work for a sum total, together, of nothing.&nbsp; Matt and Jane at least came out of it with a free wedding and a car for being popular, but for the boys, there's nothing but angry thoughts about Jamie Durie and a tradie's nail gun.   I'm not going to hold my breath for a Block III.&nbsp; Instead I'll brace myself for a housing downturn as people realise the markets really are cooling off.

      I can't not mention  urlLink this article  by Robert Manne, Professor of Politics at LaTrobe University.&nbsp; In it, he gives a very succinct summary as to the politics of lying and Australia's unflinching adherance to US policy - all viewed through the prism of the recent Flood report.   On September 11 John Howard took personal control of Australian foreign policy. He followed from this moment one exceedingly simple idea, namely the importance of absolute loyalty to the United States. As in the Old Testament Book of Ruth, from this time wherever the US would go so would we; its policies would be our policies; its triumphs and disasters would be ours.    It's a compelling essay and recommended reading.&nbsp; Now go to it - chop chop!

      Well, it seems the advertisers and marketers have won the struggle.&nbsp; Those of us that can think and reason rather than just look and dribble are being swamped by the TV-tide.&nbsp; Washed over by the images of perfection and the insistence, despite all evidence to the contrary, that it's the 50's all over again.&nbsp; More diverse, aware&nbsp;and technologically driven, but just as peachy.&nbsp;   Now it seems the&nbsp;decision as to who is the leader of the biggest power in the free world  urlLink may come down to looks .&nbsp; And the sad part is that the winner may be George W Bush - who certainly ain't no oil painting!   The linked report from The Age indicates that John Kerry is being beaten in the polls (possibly with an ugly-stick) and this beating is somewhat due to his less than extraordinary visual appearance.&nbsp; He has been referred to in various places as 'Lurch' and 'The horse' (which I'm sure is only in reference to the long face!) but the reporter above brings some new ones into the fray:   Matt Labash, of the Weekly Standard, says he looks like a "long-faced Easter Island statue" or like a tall, talking tree from Lord of the Rings.   Jokes aside, this stuff sucks.&nbsp; The current President doesn't take his job seriously already and now the media seems to be making a joke out of the entire campaign.&nbsp; They're&nbsp;turning it into a beauty contest between two blokes that aren't going to make any women, with the possible exceptions of their wives and mothers, take notice.&nbsp;   Maybe I'm getting too stuck up about this.&nbsp; Maybe I should relax.&nbsp; When you think about it, the President's job as exhibited by Dubya isn't that far removed from the Miss Universe job.&nbsp; You have the old Pres on inauguration handing it over to the new guy.&nbsp; They travel around and open hopsitals, visit schools (9/11) and all sorts of other functions.&nbsp; I bet Australia's current Miss Universe - Jennifer Hawkins -&nbsp;is a more proficient public speaker than George.&nbsp; The only difference is that George gets to carry "The Football" with the nuke codes.&nbsp;   I think I'd trust Jennifer more.

      I don't know if it says more about Beirut or Iraq, but Chris Allbritton just took a vacation from his journo work in Baghdad and thoroughly enjoyed a relaxing  urlLink vacation in Beirut .&nbsp; I seem to remember Beirut as a non-friendly destination for yanks.&nbsp; How times change.   In other travel news, my  urlLink bandmates  have taken off for Tokyo this morning for a bunch of performances.&nbsp; They have a stand-in bass player for me as I have neither the time or the money for the trip.&nbsp; Grrrrr.

      John Howard is  urlLink appreciative of the Flood Report's professionalism .&nbsp; And it's "forward looking character" - I wonder why.  He&nbsp;emphasises the following:   Mr Flood notes that prior to the commencement of military action, the only government in the world that claimed Iraq was not working on, and did not have, biological and chemical weapons or prohibited missile systems was the government of Saddam Hussein.   According to  urlLink Mr Howard on the 7.30 report , Australian Intelligence was 97% based on intelligence from Britain and the US.&nbsp; I'd suggest that the Prime Minister, and perhaps Mr Flood change the word "claimed" to "knew".  That's the whole problem - The combined intelligence of the US, UK and perhaps the weapons inspectors at the UN should have stated something other than "he's got an arsenal the size of Richard Armitage's pants!!"  Remember, Colin Powell went in with a Powerpoint presentation specifically showing what were supposed to be munitions dumps, labs and mobile lab-trucks, sites that had been covered over with sand berms and all sorts of naughty behaviour.&nbsp; This doesn't sound "thin, ambiguous and incomplete" to me.&nbsp; It sounds very damning, very pointed and like the perfect case for war.&nbsp; And it's the US intelligence that we based our decisions upon.  Johnny - again on the 7.30 Report:   Well, none of us are possessed with the benefit of hindsight at the time we take decisions. There was a strong assessment (about Iraq's WMD program) made by ONA at the time.   And a few minutes later:   We had a strong assessment from ONA. Did you ask me did I go through all of the hundreds of pages of intelligence? No....Kerry, if you're saying to me, "Does an intelligence agency tell you that there are always reservations, there are always doubts, there are always caveats?" Of course they do. In this particular case, the assessment made by ONA was, as I have described it. Now we factored that in.   So on one hand, the case put forward by ONA was a strong one, even though it was based on "thin, ambiguous and incomplete" intelligence and was accompanied, as always, by reservations, doubts and caveats.&nbsp; The PM didn't obviously didn't need the evidence (he didn't read the intelligence), just the opinion.  And of course, despite the fact that prior to the war he couldn't justify going into Iraq for the purposes of regime change alone, it's now OK to justify the war on the grounds of regime change alone.&nbsp;   I mean I haven't so far, in the last few minutes, I haven't talked about the fact that the country, Iraq, is infinitely better off without Saddam Hussein as president.I argue...It is an irrefutable reality in my view, and I believe this very strongly, that if we had followed the view of the Labor Party here and the view of the French and the Germans and the Russians and left the thing to the United Nations, Saddam would still be running Iraq and still murdering people.   His justification: if we as commentators are going to ask that he re-examine the decision for war&nbsp;superimposing the reality&nbsp;of there being no WMD's, then he's allowed to superimpose the&nbsp; reality of 'no-Saddam' in his answer.&nbsp; Never mind the fact that once the decision for war was taken, Saddam had more chance of staying in power than I have of giving birth to&nbsp;a T-Rex.&nbsp; This surety could never be claimed in the instance of the supposed WMD program based on the 'intelligence' used to sell this sucker.  Translation:   Even though I said it wasn't ok to go in just in order to kick him out, it is actually ok. &nbsp;  We now know there aren't any weapons and there weren't any at the time we went to war.  We're all safe from the threat that these weapons that aren't or weren't&nbsp;there pose to us.&nbsp;   And&nbsp;he was a nasty pastie.&nbsp;   And no one lied or conducted ANY policy-driven analysis.&nbsp;   And the intelligence people didn't tell me directly that the evidence was flimsier than my grandma's boobies".  And he was a nasty pastie.  And George W can spell - he didn't mean IraN at all when talking about Iraq.

      It'll be interesting to see where, if anywhere,  urlLink this story  goes.&nbsp;&nbsp;    The saga of "Jack" Idema, the American arrested for running a private interrogation centre in Afghanistan, has taken a new twist.&nbsp; He has claimed he was acting with the knowledge and agreement of US Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld's office....."We were working for the US counter-terrorist group and working with the Pentagon and some other federal agencies," said Idema, whose full name is Jonathon Keith Idema, before the opening of a court hearing in Kabul on Wednesday.     "We were in contact directly by fax and email and phone with Donald Rumsfeld's office," he said. "The American authorities absolutely condoned what we did. We have extensive evidence to that . . . We're prepared to show emails and correspondence and tape-recorded conversations."    &nbsp;  Idema, who has made no secret of the fact that he is hunting for Osama bin Laden, who has a price of $US25 million ($A35 million) on his head, was arrested with two other men 11 days ago for allegedly detaining eight Afghans in Kabul.

      Finally some more concrete idea as to an election date here in Oz.&nbsp; The PM in waiting, Peter  urlLink 'the python'  Costello,  urlLink dropped some hints  this morning on Sydney radio that the vote will likely be in September or October.&nbsp; I'd say it's only a very small chance of being in September given the sporting events of that month.&nbsp; October is the more likely time.&nbsp; Why cheese the electorate off any more than it needs to be by making them go to the polling booths during the finals?   The timing makes sense too.&nbsp; Before the US election&nbsp;and it's potential backwash in November.&nbsp; The Libs are most likely hoping the current poll trends will continue.&nbsp; Latham has stalled a little and the  urlLink recent scaling down of earlier policy packages , whilst fiscally responsible, may appear to be a bit of a backflip to your average punter.&nbsp; Look for Johnny and the attack dogs to make the absolute most out of this, not only in policy terms but also in the timing of events.&nbsp; If they can get Latham on the back foot over these policy downgrades then that's just going to play more into the hands of the election spin doctors.   And that's the frustrating thing about the entire Australian political debate at the moment.&nbsp; It's 60/40 at best in the perception/reality stakes.&nbsp; 60% of the equation is the perception that is taken in by the electorate.&nbsp; This is shaped not only by a party's release of the policy, but also by their opponent's attack on it.&nbsp; The reality of the policy's contents play about a 40% role in the absorption of the detail.   It's one of the reasons elections annoy me so much.&nbsp; As soon as the time is coming near you have to brace yourself for the electoral junkmail that seems to flood your mental inbox from all directions.&nbsp; Glossy brochures, TV and radio ads, interviews etc etc.&nbsp; And no matter how much each party advocates a smear-free campaign, it rarely happens.&nbsp; Happily, I haven't heard much (if any) smear from the ALP yet.&nbsp; The smear coming from the Libs is well enough known and needs no further coverage here.   In all honesty, my political position is somewhat uncertain.&nbsp; I prefer the ALPs social initiatives with positives hopes held for health and education.&nbsp; I also think they are more likely to pursue a responsible and balanced foreign policy.&nbsp; I continue to worry about their economic management credentials however.&nbsp; Simon Crean has been doing a pretty good job of staying out of the limelight since Latham took over.&nbsp; Probably a good idea.  I remain very disillusioned by the current government.&nbsp; They have tied themselves so closely to the US administration that I fear a little for our place in the international community.&nbsp; Whether we are the US's lackey to any degree or not is a matter for longer discussion than I'd manage in this post.&nbsp;  urlLink Chris at BackPages  has progressed beyond us being the pet poodle (which requires exercise and feeding) to us now being the US's pet rock.&nbsp; I don't think we're there yet, but we are heading down a road of at least appearing to be lock-step in tune with all US foreign policy matters.&nbsp;   This is OK if we had some prominent public debate about some of the issues, but I don't recall hearing a whole lot about  urlLink yesterday's ICJ vote  on Israel's version of the Berlin wall until after the fact.&nbsp; For the record, Australia voted  for  the wall along with Israel (duh), the US, Palau, Micronesia and the Marshall Islands.&nbsp; As Chris Shiel points out (see earlier Backpages link), the latter three are basically US lilypads in the Pacific and have their foreign policy directed by the US.&nbsp; So counting out Israel, there was basically the US and Australia in disagreement with over 150 countries.&nbsp;   Vote with the US?&nbsp; Fine.&nbsp; Just give us the reasons because the perception out there to be had is that we are the US's pets.&nbsp; And I, as an Aussie, don't want to be a US pet.&nbsp; Especially when the US is running around the world looking for defeatable enemies rather than real ones.&nbsp; But I digress.  Basically, apart from fiscal responsibility, I can barely think of a measure that would make me pleased with the direction taken by the Howard government in the last few years.&nbsp; Our hospitals are fairly well stuffed.&nbsp; Our universities are headed that way unless you've got bundles of cash.&nbsp; Our rural communities are less cohesive than years past and will soon be less communicative once Telstra's privatised.&nbsp; We are regarded as internationally independant pretty much just by ourselves and by the US (who are apparently the only important people we have to convince).  I'm an average punter that's voted Liberal all my life so that reads like a pretty damning indictment to me.&nbsp; We'll see what happens in a few months time.&nbsp; Hopefully it won't take any longer than that.&nbsp; Memo to John:&nbsp; I  do not  want to see your face over the summer.

      Jenna Bush had just been studying Politics 101.&nbsp; They'd been watching a video of one of her Dad's speeches to the UN, or Congress, or anyone who'd listen actually.&nbsp; So, when she greets a bunch of journos and photographers like this she's just following the family line really.&nbsp; I'd expect her to be writing policy speeches next.     The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

      Shaq took up residence in his new castle yesterday as he was  urlLink introduced to the people of Miami  as the Heat's new starting centre.&nbsp; And boy, was he happy: &nbsp;      Shaquille O'Neal arrived in the cab of a semi-tractor, pulling a trailer with the words "Diesel Power" on the side.   The Miami Heat threw a public celebration for O'Neal, and entitled it "Shaq in Black."   O'Neal climbed out, used a plastic water cannon to douse fans and walked along a red carpet to the steps leading to the entrance of the AmericanAirlines Arena, where he pledged that another celebration is in the Heat's future.   "Remember this -- I'm going to bring a championship to Miami," O'Neal said. "I promise."    He was in good humour too, regarding the welcome:    O'Neal said he appreciates the way he has been embraced by the city of Miami.   "That has nothing to do with basketball," he said. "That's just because I'm sexy."   I'm hanging out to see who else the Heat can recruit now.&nbsp; Then it'll be my cuz, Dwayne Wade, Shaq Diesel and the team going all the way in the East and hopefully all the way to the Larry O'B trophy.

      Enjoyed 'Talking Footy' last night more than I have all season.&nbsp; For starters, and this is one of the only reasons I've kept watching this show all season despite is lacklustre performance, there's no Eddie Maguire in sight.&nbsp; The collingwood connection was there though, as Mick Malthouse was the special guest.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Mick Malthouse is one of the few coaches that is really worth sitting down and listening to.&nbsp; I used to think he was a pretty cold customer, but he is a man who is very very passionate about his footy.&nbsp; And an excellent communicator to boot.&nbsp; He issued a challenge in the paper to Adrian Andersen, one of the AFL head honchos, to come and sit in the coaches box, even spend a week getting emotionally involved with the club, the players, the fans etc and not be passionate when you speak after a game.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Mick's been fined recently for saying things critical of the tribunal and wants Andersen to try and do his job dispassionaltely.&nbsp; His breakdown as to why this could never happen (i.e. someone in Andersen's position experiencing Mick's job) was very well thought out and delivered with a huge heart.&nbsp; This man loves his job, his club, his players and his family. &nbsp; But the&nbsp;BIG hurrah comes from the the loss of The Muppet.&nbsp; Steve Price was nowhere to be seen last night.&nbsp; They didn't give any illness or vacation excuses, so i'm hoping that they've seen the light and dropped this cretin for good.&nbsp; I don't know how you Sydney radio people put up with him.&nbsp;

      Whatever you may think of him, last night's  urlLink interview with Bill Clinton  on Enough Rope made me realise just how much the world lost with the ascension of George W. Bush to the top job.&nbsp; Bubba's ability to&nbsp;do the simple things, such as&nbsp;think and speak at the same time, renders 'W' to almost comic-book status. &nbsp; The Supreme Court has a lot to answer for.

      This will be interesting. &nbsp; Regurgitator are going to  urlLink record their next album completely enclosed in a glass case  in Melbourne's Federation Square.&nbsp; Apparently Quan's been thinking about it for a while.   "Unparalleled artistic accountability wrapped up in a landmark meta-cultural experiment or a weeping pustule of cutting edge, quasi-real situation marketing-anti-marketing fodder covering up poorly crafted music? Quite possibly. I have no idea. That's why we have to do it."   Whatever. &nbsp; Should still be interesting.

       As reported in   urlLink  The Age    this afternoon, Fahrenheit 9/11 is breaking records in Australia  prior  to actually being released.&nbsp; I'm looking forward to seeing it with all the family.&nbsp; Mr 13 is already suss about what's going on in the world around him and I'm sure he'll find this interesting.     &nbsp;   Tissues for Ray Bradbury, please.&nbsp; Ray was widely reported on the RWDB blogs as being mad about Moore basing his film's title on Bradbury's book 'Fahrenheit 451'.     &nbsp;   urlLink  Said Ray   :      "Michael Moore is a screwed asshole, that is what I think about that case," Bradbury said according to an English translation of    urlLink   the story.      "He stole my title and changed the numbers without ever asking me for permission.....Who cares?  Nobody will see his movie . It is almost dead already. Never mind, nobody cares."      That was back in early June.&nbsp; Two months later and the doco has busted all records for the genre in the US and has done the same here in Oz without officially opening yet.    "Its incredible," Sydney's Hayden Orpheum Picture Palace general manager Paul Dravet said. I am just so surprised by the diversity of the audience, from kids to older adults absolutely incredible. We have had sold out sessions and queueing problems all weekend and every single session is getting rapturous applause."     Yeah, no one will see it, Ray.&nbsp; Time for a nappy change now.

       No blogposts to speak of for a little while as I've been busy getting my band's website back on line.&nbsp; We had some arguments with our previous ISP about how much we owed them for hosting services and as such, they cut us off and we've been arguing with them ever since.&nbsp; Their name is Trumpnet and i'd personally recommend that you cut your own throat with a blunt saw before giving them your business.    &nbsp;  Thankfully, our mate Preecey has started up his own hosting setup (if I had a link I'd give him a better plug) so we are online again.    &nbsp;  The band is called Daystream.&nbsp; The website is here at   urlLink  http://www.daystream.com.au    and it's got pics, soundclips etc etc.&nbsp; I've still got to update the content as it hasn't been operating since December 2003, but i'll get around to that soon enough.

       When I'm not speaking on the international Ice Carving lecture circuit, I'm usually conducting 'big man' coaching to NBA hopefuls.&nbsp; If i'm not on the court then I might be working on my spectacular range of studded underwear.&nbsp; If I am done with that I'll probably be hanging with the family at home and when they've had enough, I play in a band.    &nbsp;  We're called Daystream and I'll get our lamo website re-established   urlLink  here    some time in the near future.&nbsp; The link is to the front page of our very old site, only resurrected last week.&nbsp; No pictures back up there yet.    &nbsp;  Anyway, tonight we just kicked some butt in the Wrest Point Hotel Casino band competition.&nbsp; There were four bands in tonight's heat.&nbsp; Fortunately we got to play last, whcih always helps in these things, but we did play pretty well anyway.&nbsp; I reckon it would have us by a nose&nbsp;past The Humans, who played a pretty good set as well.    &nbsp;  Each band did a short set, only 25 minutes.&nbsp; The set was supposed to include 2 covers, but we only did one as we only got notice yesterday that we were even playing.&nbsp; We do all original stuff, so coming up with just one cover to play was hard enough.&nbsp; We ended up playing Come Together by some hack band from Liverpool that used to play around the traps years ago.    &nbsp;  Unfortunately The Humans chose to do 'On My Mind' by Powderfinger, which was also played by the band before them.&nbsp; Oops.&nbsp; The Humans sounded heaps fatter though.    &nbsp;  Feeling pumped.&nbsp; $400 better off and another gig at Wrest Point coming up in the near future.&nbsp; Woohoo!

       Ah, it's good isn't it?&nbsp; Free speech.&nbsp; The ability to write what you think and express how you feel.     &nbsp;   Unless what you think and what you feel is critical of the government of the day.     &nbsp;   urlLink  Johnhowardlies.com    has popped up and is written by a former, read that again - FORMER Labor party staffer and boy, is   urlLink  Erica Betz getting steamed   !!&nbsp; The content is independantly written, not prepared by the Labor Party, but by a resourceful gent who knows the political system.     &nbsp;   Apparently his company contributed $4200 to the Labor Party in times past.&nbsp; Big Deal.&nbsp; According to Erica this makes him Latham's mouthpiece and he's operating in contravention of the Australian electoral laws.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   Crap on, Erica.     &nbsp;   By your logic, no person or company in Australia that had contributed a penny to a Party would be allowed to have an opinion.&nbsp; If this site was&nbsp;a backroom publication of the Labor Party then you might have a point.&nbsp; The combined facts: a)&nbsp;it's written by someone who knows the game well enough, and b) he doesn't like you and yours, don't make it against the law.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   Watch out Chris, Erica's coming to shut   urlLink  Back Pages    down next!!   &nbsp;   Erica's thinking that if he waves enough flags and throws enough muck, then people might&nbsp;be distracted by&nbsp;the non-issue rather than take in and think about the content.&nbsp; Erica, you're not big enough to run interference, mate.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   Now shut up and log on.&nbsp; You might even learn something.

      Bush has to go.  Unfortunately I have to trust the American people to vote him out.  Yesterday we saw  urlLink another scripted scene .  In front of the specially produced 'Protecting America' backdrop (who makes these, by the way?  And what happens to them after W passes through?  Anybody seen one on Ebay?), the chimp in charge again said how good it was that America's intelligence was all rooted and how it's sensible and appropriate foreign policy to invade a country when you don't like them and they've had a go at your daddy.    "Although we have not found stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction, we were right to go into Iraq," Mr Bush told an audience at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory where some components of nuclear materials from Libya are being held.  "We removed a declared enemy of America who had the capability of producing weapons of mass murder and could have passed that capability to terrorists bent on acquiring them."     North Korea is a declared enemy of America.  Anybody see "Access of Evil" last night on SBS?  If George has seen it then I'd imagine all the John Smith's of the National Guard still in the USA are packing their bags and getting their passports ready for a Korean stamp.  All the beautiful, motivational, patriotic language was in evidence as well:   "Today, because America has acted and because America has led, the forces of terror and tyranny have suffered defeat after defeat, and America and the world are safer," Mr Bush said.    Continued careful stage management took him to the nuclear materials repository where he could look all presidential whilst being handed Libyan weapons components.  He looked very knowledgeable on the matter.  I thought he was going to try one of the components on as a hat.  I keep stating it, but only because I have to until he's (or they're) gone.  My main opposition towards Bush & Co (read John Howard) is this:  you went to war based on a lie.  You followed policy-driven anlysis that told you what you wanted to hear and you committed, forever, the lives of 1000+ of your coalition people plus unconfirmed thousands of Iraqi lives to the pursuit of your lies and fearmongering. The fight to be had was in Afghanistan, where the REAL terrorists were residing and hiding.  You took the easy foe instead.  You proved nothing except your own military capability and your inability to assess a situation with a kindergarten level of accuracy. Greetings with flowers and chocolates??    Debate over the rationale for war has regained the spotlight in recent days as the presidential campaign has accelerated.  Although the Senate report focused blame on the Central Intelligence Agency, Democrats have blamed the Bush Administration, saying it pressured intelligence analysts to reach a foregone conclusion about Iraq and failed to question the analyses before declaring war.    Dubya, you're a small minded schoolyard bully with too much money and too much time on your hands.  Dubya called Saddam a madman yesterday.  But he was a madman with no teeth.  I'm thinking we have a madman in our corner as well and he's armed up to the eyeballs and fixin for a fight.

      NBA superhero and living legend Michael Jordan has reportedly expressed an interest in buying into the Miami Heat.  I have one thing to say about this:  STAY AWAY MIKE!!!  You see, unless he's in his 20's or early 30's and playing for you, Michael Jordan is a curse for basketball teams.  He's great for team owners, but kills basketball teams.    He poisoned the Washington Wizards.  As general manager of the Wiz, Jordan rode the team like a rodeo cowboy.  He drafted a 17 year old High School, Kwame Brown, talent as the No. 1 draft pick and then proceeded to crush his confidence.  As a player with the Wiz in Comeback II, he took too many shots, insisted on starting when he was more suited to playing off the bench and once again crushed his teammates in the locker room and on the court.  After Comeback II was over and he retired for good, he was supposed to return to the head office in a management role with the Wiz, but was sacked as the owner finally recognised what this guy did to his team and then built up the cajoles to say 'no' the greatest name in basketball.  His reputation in Chicago was one of doing the same.  Sam Smith's book,The Jordan Rules, tells of a bunch of times where he just rode teamates into the ground and if they didn't have any game whatsoever to answer with, they were finished.  The good thing for Chicago was that Mike was at his peak and could carry just about anyone on his mighty basketball shoulders.  In Washington he was well past his peak and therefore the effects of his degredation of team spirit showed on the court.  Sloppy, incoherent play and two seasons in a row where a team with Michael Jordan on it couldn't make the playoffs.   urlLink Now he wants to buy into Miami .  Miami had a stellar year last year.  With an undersized team, Dwyane Wade - the rookie sensation point guard - managed to lead this team into the playoffs thereby exceeding all expectations.  They have a chief exec in Pat Riley that knows basketball's heights and beleives in the coach he's appointed.  They have a coach with a great pedigree that stepped up to the plate in difficult circumstances last year and did a sensational job (and got rewarded too with  urlLink a contract extension ).  Miami have just given up a heck of a lot of talent (Lamar Odom and Caron Butler) in order to prize away  urlLink Shaq from the Lakers .  They're a decent forward away from being a lock for the East finals.  All this potential and Mike could kill it all.  Mike, come aboard if you must, but stay up in the suites and away from the locker room. Stay away from my cuz, Dwyane.  Stay away from the big Diesel.  He knows his game. Just bring in the money so Riles can trade for a decent power forward, OK.  I love your highlight reels, I just hate your management style.

      Look, I'm quite happy for the economic prosperity we've enjoyed over the last bunch of years to continue.  I'm in a decent, well-paying job, have a home to pay off and am enjoying a lifestyle, which includes Swedish cars, playing in a band and photography (all of which can be $-consuming hobbies). I just wanted to make it clear that I take no enjoyment in playing the 'harbinger-of-doom' role.  With that over, WTF is  urlLink The Age going on about this morning ?!?!?   Australia's long economic boom is set to continue for at least another year - with low unemployment, low inflation, low interest rates and  spending restraint by the Government  as it fights for a fourth term.  The Age twice-yearly survey of private sector economists has found broad agreement that the economy will continue to prosper in 2004-05.    Those tax cuts for the over-$52,000 set and the $600 payment to kidded-families were examples of the government's RESTRAINT?  With the election still TBA I'm sure we might see more surprise exhibitions of restraint prior to whacking day.  $300 for everyone above age 18 in a marginal electorate that has, say, a heartbeat?  Then there's this:   The panel of 20 leading forecasters from business, finance and academia predicts that Australia's economy will grow by 3.6 per cent this financial year, before slowing slightly to 3.45 per cent in 2005.   Economic forecasters are the only forecasters lower on the forecasting totem pole than weather forecasters.  We get a bunch of 'economic forecasters' here in Hobart each year going about their day jobs at the Annual Psychic fair.    But this is my favourite part.  One paragraph reads thus:   The survey reflects general optimism about the economy's ability to withstand looming challenges.   The next paragraph does pretty much everything to contradict it:   World oil prices are high because of tensions in the Middle East, world interest rates are rising, the housing boom is unwinding and parts of the country are in danger of falling back into drought.   Smirking-Smurf Petey Costello is busy warning that a change in government would mean higher interest rates, unemployment and budget outcomes (Petey says 'deficits').    Well, pulling on my economic forecaster's pointy hat, let me predict that regardless of who wins government, we're going to have higher interest rates, unemployment and budget outcomes.  Interest rates are at around the lowest they've ever been.  The US interest rates are on the rise and spending here is at an all time high - are we going to LOWER rates in this environment?  Not likely.  Unemployment may indeed rise, but it's more likely that a significant rise would be the result of honesty in the disclosure about participation (I'm assuming a Labor win here).  Maybe there'll be better stats that don't count a 10hrs pw casual as 'employed'.  Like I said, I'm happy for the good times to continue, but I take the 'boom' theory posed by these 20 economists with a "Lot's wife" style grain of salt.  Memo to The Age, if you get a room full of 20 economists again, just lock the door and send food occasionally.

         What is it with Democrat Presidential candidates and music?   urlLink JK threw a big fundraising concert , netting $9 mil for the campaign coffers.  Various luminaries were present including spaghetti sauce king, Paul Newman, as well as the likes of part time actors Chevy Chase and Sarah Jessica Parker (who is part time dumb).  On the plus side, and confirming my preference for the Dem side of US politics, the concert featured the musical genius of The Dave Matthews Band.  Other acts included Bon Jovi, John Mellencamp, John Fogarty, Mary J Blige and Wyclef Jean.  A mixed bag to say the least.    I'm not sure which performer allowed Kerry to join in on the Gibson 335, but it's a fair bet it was more likely to be a 3-chord Fogerty tune rather than a Dave Matthews ditty in 5/4 with 7 key changes!  Best line in the report - Chevy Chase on George Dubya:   "This guy is as bright as an egg-timer"

         urlLink I wrote a few weeks ago  about a potential car purchase I was thinking about making.  Well, the deal has finally been done.  The car above is now part of the Swade family of cars.   urlLink I wrote yesterday  about the anticipated joy of driving the new baby home.  Unfortunately I didn't get possession of the vehicle until this morning.  Couldn't do it last night for unforseen reasons.  Now the crunchtime-question is what to do with the green interior vehicle (a 1979 99 Turbo)?  It should be a simple case of buy one and sell another, but I'm pretty emotionally attached to this car.    It was the first turbo I ever bought.  It was bound for the wreckers due to a blown gearbox when I picked it up out of the paper for $400.  I got the gearbox replaced and a new turbo fitted and boom - she was up and running a treat. 12 months later I started hankering for a 900, so I sold 'green' to buy an 86 900 Turbo.  PJ and I both loved the 900, but secretly I always missed the 99.  Fortunately I had maintained contact with the guy who bought it from me and when he was interesting in selling again, he gave me first dibs on it, so I snapped it up.  We've been together again happily for the last 18 months until this scarlet lady has come along and peaked my interest.  Now I have to contemplate selling 'green' again.  Anyone want a good project car to work on?

         The state of Utah, known for its tabernacle choir and huge Mormon population, has  urlLink just pulled a free agent coup  and landed a Boozer, Carlos Boozer, from the Cleveland Caveliers.  Can't tell you how disappointed I am at this outcome.    First up, Carlos was the '2' in a great young '1-2' punch.  LeBron James was the '1' and together I think they would have been a sensational guard/forward combo for years to come. Secondly, it's another quality big man gone west.  The west has got too many of these dominant big guys.  With K-Mart looking at heading west as well (a chance for Denver to pick him up) it's a real drain for the East.  Even if Miami do the impossible and trade for Shaq, the ultimate big, they'd be giving up their recruiting coup from last year, Lamar Odom, to get it done.  Maybe the Cavs can clear some space and go after K-Mart instead. LBJ and K?  Now that's a match I'd like to see!!

      Isn't it great how you can pass a person in the street and not have any idea of the things they may have endured or enjoyed over the last hour/day/week/year?    One Saturday in May last year, PJ and I were just a couple in a pottery shop in Sheffield.  Just 24 hours earlier we got married and shared a beautiful evening with close family and friends.  At 5.30pm today I'll be just another guy in a car on the bridge, but 20 minutes earlier I'll have just completed a purchase of what is for me, a dream car.  A wish fulfilled.  A very happy camper.    I wonder how many other happy campers there will be on that bridge and what made them so?

         Dick's Head   Richard Armitage has again been  urlLink shoving his nose well and truly into Australian domestic affairs .  Not merely content to comment on party policy, as the yanks have been in the past, Armitage is now claiming and tacitly promoting divisions within the Labor party.  This is a disturbing trend we're seeing from the US.  We've all seen the bits in the movies, like JFK, where the CIA or military intelligence guys are accused of helping in the overthrow of this government or that.  I don't want to draw too long a bow here, but why all the interference in our domestic political situation?    Well, it's a pretty thinly veiled fact that the US government sees more common ground with John Howard's regime that what they would with the alternative government here. They can't invade us or sneak a 'black ops' team in to maintain the status quo, so they're having to do it the nice way and fire some diplomatic shots over the bow of the Australian voting public.   "You know as well as I do the Labor Party is split on this issue," US Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage told Australian reporters in Washington yesterday ahead of a meeting of Australian and US foreign and defence ministers.   Citing recent meetings he had held with unnamed Australian political visitors in Washington, Mr Armitage said it was clear there were deep divisions within Labor.   "They were private discussions and they'll remain private but I must say it looked to me like the party is rent down the middle," he said.    Now, before little Johnny says it, I know he was responding to a question from a reporter.  But what was the question - "Mr Armitage, what is your opinion on the state of the Labor party in Australia?  And who stole your neck?" Or was it something like "Mr Armitage, who will win the State of Origin series tonight? And by the way, who stole your neck?"  Private discussions? Unnamed Australian political visitors? "You know as well as I do"?!?!  I haven't seen one hint of Labor being divided on this issue.  This is international political interference by a big player into a small player's house.  It's yet another reason why the US government has got to go.  These guys are out of control.  They are literally trying to build an empire.  They dress it up with rhetoric about freedom, liberty, justice and independance but it's really all about obedience and subservience.  "Follow us and you'll be rewarded. Here's a Free Trade Agreement.  Keep following us or we'll treat you like New Zealand."    Give Howard and Bush successful elections this year and we are well and truly only 3 or 4 years away from being a true quasi-US state. They're  urlLink already working  on a way to "defend" it (the best defense is a good offence).  How long until these guys are all, literally, on the same side?

      Michael Moore has been  urlLink written up The Age  as wanting to see regime change in Australia.  His film Farenheit 9/11 should be released here pretty soon.   Moore said Mr Howard's decision to get "in bed" with Mr Bush was "disgraceful", and he hoped that after seeing his film Australian voters would seek "regime change".  "I get a lot of mail from Australia," Moore said. "I probably get per capita more mail from Australia than from any other country. A lot of angry Australians, I never realised how angry, and I don't think just because they are living in Australia, right?  "No, I mean, I realise, it's like, you're living on an island, but you're also a country, but you're also a continent. So I know there's a lot of confusion there, right? But what's confusing to me is, how is it that someone like John Howard could get in bed with George W. Bush?   "Not to give Mr Howard too much credit, but he at least appears to have half a brain. Half, I said. Half. I'm being generous. But, I mean, what is he doing with George W. Bush? It's really disgraceful.    Unfortunately Mike's not sounding too convincing here.  I appreciate his concerns and to a large degree I'm in agreement with him.  But Mike, stick with what you know, especially if it's a live interview being written down word for word.  I don't think Australia's political plight is Mike's strong suit.

      I've  urlLink blogged before  about the government's tight-arsed attitude in it's latest energy policy.  So go  urlLink read this  and tell me again why we shouldn't be chasing down windfarm technology at a rapid rate of knots (pun intended).  To sum:  New windfarm based around Portland in Victoria. $280 Million investment 400 jobs created Enough power to supply 100,000 homes 700,000 tonne reduction in greenhouse emissions Potential exports of $100 Mil annually.  So why aren't we developing more of this?  Oh yeah, that unproven geosequestration thing that'll keep the current big energy players happy.

      Plenty happening in the NBA since the Pistons did the impossible a few weeks ago.  In good news for our household,  urlLink Streetball legend Rafer Alston has agreed to go play point for the Raptors .  This is fantastic news and should hopefully persuade "Half Man, Half Amazing" Vince Carter to stay in Toronto for a little longer.  Vince got snooty after the Raps drafted some 6'11" dingbat out of need for a center.  With Skip coming in to run the point it should free up Jalen Rose to play shooting guard.  It's still nowhere near a championship team, but may hopefully get them into the playoffs next season.   urlLink Who's going to get Kobe ?  If it aint the State of Colorado, I reckon he'll stay with the Lakers.  Shaq's going to split so it'll be Kobe's team now.  They can offer more cash mo' than anyone else and with a respected coach like Rudy T coming in, I reckon they'll convince Kobe to stay.  I reckon the Lakers might need a backup point guard though.  I'd be surprised if Houston didn't go after Derek Fisher.  Fish is a reliable point and cheap for what he brings to the table.  Value-for-money will talk loud to Houston execs who'll have T-Mac to pay as well as a pretty big figure for Yao after next season if they want to keep him (what are the chances they won't??)    There's some talk of Brent Barry going to Houston too.  Who's going to be left in Seattle next season?  They'll have cleaners suiting up if the mass exodus continues.  Atlanta have a new coach.  Wow.  Unfortunately for Luke, their franchise player is currently Jason Terry.  Not exactly a cornerstone.  I think the Bobcats are currently in a better position than the Hawks.

      I feel quite satisfied this morning  urlLink reading about the deception of Steve Price .  I've referred to Price previously as 'The Muppet', based on my belief that he is only a small, fuzzy caricature of real life.  Thank goodness he doesn't broadcast on Hobart radio.  I saw Price yesterday on Sunrise, when he claimed to have the name and number of a man who had seen Mark Latham's fictitious bucks night video.  Like the typical journo out to make a name for himself, he took the story on air, on national TV, without having checked his source.  Turns out the whole thing was a prank.  From The Age (link above):    Price described how a caller to his show on 2UE the previous night had "revealed" the video's contents: Latham sitting with a stripper in his lap pushing her breasts into his face.  Price had a busy morning, also spinning the tale to Melbourne listeners of 3AW's breakfast show.  Pity it wasn't true, not a word of it.   Price had been offered a bait and taken it. Hook, line and sinker.  Last night, The Age spoke to the mysterious caller.  Identifying himself as "Paul Smith, of Sydney", the man said that shortly before 6pm on Monday he had left his mobile phone on a table at work while he went for a toilet break.  According to Smith, a workmate used the phone to call Price, going on air as "Paul" and telling of how he had seen the video of Latham's bucks night.  "When I got back from the toilet, my phone was sitting there on the table so I picked it up and I'm on hold somewhere," Smith told The Age.  "This bloke comes on and tells me he's a producer with Steve Price's show and he wanted to check the details of the story I'd just given on-air.  "I could see my mates laughing in the corner and thought I'd go along with it so I asked this bloke to ring me back in five minutes."  Smith says he re-told the story to Price's producer and "I just thought it would end there. A bit of a silly joke."   No retraction has been issued.  This whole feeding frenzy has me a bit miffed.  Price should issue a no-holds-barred apology for his egotistic effort.  The other things that have been coming out, e.g. about journos ringing Latham's wife's dancing teacher from 20 years ago etc etc.  Someone has got to be accountable for this tripe.  I reckon journalists should only protect their sources if divulging the source endangers the source's life.  Other than that, a man has a right to face his accuser.  Latham has been called a bit of a sissy as he's been a vitriolic MP in the past.  Fair enough, but at least the people he's had a go at know it was him who was firing the shots. This junk we're reading about now, whether it is being generated by a Liberal dirt group or just by some media types looking for a day in the sun, isn't news and isn't relevant to the upcoming election.  And isn't that the point?  Latham is running for PM, not bishop of the national church.  I'll repeat again, Steve Price is an audience-hungry muppet.  The sooner he gets right out of the national media, the sooner we pull the national IQ back to a respectable level.

      Channel Seven's Sunrise program is a running it's own electoral campaign, entitled " urlLink Vote For Me ".  VFM is their way of putting power to the people.  They're asking for everyday Aussies to send in their 3 minute stump speech. They will assess them and select a handful of people to receive some political advice etc etc and then they'll give them some airtime to promote their cause in getting elected to the senate.  No plans for the green interior to join this exercise (wrong house, senate has a red interior - though  urlLink I may have a red interior  too by the end of the week) but it is interesting to see the stir it's causing in the halls of influence.   urlLink Barry Jones has resigned as one of the political advisors .    They had Bronny Bishop on the show this morning, smiling away as she dismissed the whole campaign as an illustration of how the senate should be harder to get into.   "Don't want any ordinary Aussies getting in there with no party agenda!" .  She actually said at one point that Liberal MP's are quite free to cross the floor at any time and vote with their consciences, implying that therefore independant candidates aren't really required in any case for the excersising of independant thought.   Really?!   Can't wait to see the next time Ms Bish crosses the floor other than to go to the 'ladies'.  They also had some Labor goose on there as well, but he was truly not worth writing about.  But I will.  His opposition to the campaign was solely based on the fact that VFM's candidates would be beholden to Channel 7 and therefore pushing 7's barrow at every opportunity.  Goose.  They are scared of an independant doing a Harradine and actually being considerate in holding a balance of power.

      What do you do at 12.30 a.m. when you’re all alone in a Launceston hotel room?  Bask in the glory left over by a recently departed Prime Minister rapt with the idea of slimming our youth?  Hire a car and join the locals doing blockies?  Or address part 3 of the electoral queries posted at  urlLink The Road to Surfdom ?  I could sleep, but instead I’ll take the third option.  So what are the sort of issues that I’ll consider important prior to my vote in the coming Federal election?  The prominent thing that keeps entering my mind as I consider the sitting Government and the alternative is the lack of integrity I see in the Liberal/National coalition.  The blind following of the US into Iraq when the real War on Terror ™ was there to be won in the hills of Afghanistan and the subsequent justification on the grounds of regime change have left a bitter taste in my mouth that just don’t seem to be able to shake.  And I’m a traditionally conservative voter.  But there are other concerns too.  I’m concerned about the continuing privatisation of our institutions and the debilitating effect this may have on the ability of all Australians to participate in our society.  I was lucky.  My university education only cost me $7500.  If I’d completed it back in the late 80’s when I should have it would have been free.  My 16 year old stepson will now face a cost in the tens of thousands to do an equivalent degree in a few years time.  He’s come from a family that have been able to afford him a decent preparation, both educationally and socially, for such an experience.  I fear for those who haven’t been so fortunate.  I’m concerned about our country becoming a victim of its own success, where the accumulation of private wealth totally consumes the ideal of building up the community spirit that we should all foster and enjoy.  I’m concerned for kids that will be second, third or fourth generation illiterate in a society that only established formalised high school education for all in the last 100 years.  I’m concerned that a cultural and intellectual elite will get more and more focused on itself and isolate those already marginalised in the community.    I’m concerned that accountability, real and tangible accountability, will only be available to shareholders, rather than stakeholders.  I’m concerned that we will become one of the dumbest Western nations in the world simply because we imposed targets on schools that they could never meet and thereafter reduced the funding that could enable them to reach decent standards in the future.  I’m concerned that even these current educational standards are being lowered to cater to apologists that want everyone to feel good before they actually achieve something.  I’m concerned for the decay in family values and the family system.  I’m sick of  pretending that everything’s all right when it isn’t.  I’m sick of spineless men that can only provide dominance rather than leadership and I weep for the leaders that we won’t have when I’m old if we don’t stop selling our future down the drain.  I’m concerned for the environment that we live in.  Will we have enough water to go around in 50 years time?  Can jobs now replace forests in the future?  I don’t know enough about these issues to have an adequately informed opinion so I have to trust those who claim they do.  But when they are private business with an eye on the dollar or a Government unwilling to challenge an environmental monopoly, how much can I trust them to act or speak in the public good?  I’m concerned for our place in the world.  We live in a region that we no longer seem to reach out to.  We only seem to fear our northern neighbours.  We differ on religion and other beliefs and yet we share a commonality in geography that behoves us to reach out and create dialogue and encourage trade.  We decline the opportunity to think for ourselves and jump when The Man says ‘jump’.  We have an alliance with the most powerful nation in the world and we invoke that alliance in every policy decision that may come within cooee of it, regardless of the harm it may cause to our national identity and sense of self.  My vote will go to the party that will provide me with some answers to these concerns.  Some may label these as small target issues.  I prefer to regard them as real concerns.  Real concerns that have to be addressed every now and then if we care about how we live and our place in the world.  These are some of the issues that give us an identity and some character.  Anyone can earn a buck.  It’s how you earn it and more importantly what you do with it that indicates character and I’ll be looking for some indicators that answer these concerns.

      I caught Lateline last night and the interview with Major Michael Mori, the military lawyer charged with the defence of Australian, David Hicks.    Now let me get one thing straight at the outset.  If Hicks is guilty, then lock him away for whatever the maximum penalty is under the appropriate laws.  I have no issues with criminals doing the time if they do the crime.  Better to get them out of harm’s way when the harm is threatened against a society respectful of the rule of law.  Some of you that saw Lateline the night before (Wed) would remember our esteemed President, John Howard, waxing lyrical about Australia’s respect for the rule of law – more on that in a moment.  The problem with the impending trial of David Hicks, so succinctly illustrated by Maj Mori last night, was the fact that the hearing he will be subject to is going to be a farce by the standards of modern international justice.  I can’t claim to have been overly familiar with the technicalities.  I’m still not to any huge degree, but there were several things that Maj Mori illustrated last night that scared me as a member of a civilised country with an interest in equal justice for all.  For example, the evidence rules that accompany this hearing.  In a modern courtroom there are rules that govern what is admissible in court.  Evidence that is gained illegally cannot be used against the accused, in order to enhance the fairness of the trial.  The theory is that the court is possibly about to deny this person their personal liberties, so let’s be sure about what happened before we do it.  It attempts to ensure that the justice delivered is based on the facts of the case, which are established by legally obtained evidence.   In the hearing system that will decide the fate of David Hicks and who knows how many others in the next few years, evidence will be allowed that would not be allowed anywhere near a modern courtroom.  The prosecution will be allowed to enter hearsay.  The military honchos in charge of Guantanamo Bay did not allow the recording of interrogations, yet the purported responses will be allowed as evidence in the hearing.  Theoretically, David Hicks could be found guilty of acting in the Rockford Files and having AIDS based on the fact that during the interrogation an officer munched on a packet of Fantales, with the actor’s name chopped off the top of the wrapper.     The responses gained during interrogations could have been the result of sensory deprivation, torture or other inadmissible means and then be used against the accused.  The prosecution is under no obligation to indicate the means used to gather the statements made.  Am I the only person in Australia or anywhere else that can smell what these hearings are shovelling?  Apparently not.  The British Attorney General has come out in condemnation of the hearing framework, saying that it would deny the accused parties proper justice.  Just this morning Tony Blair has come out and said the same thing.  Maj Mori was very direct in saying that the only country outside the US to come out in support of the framework adopted for the military hearings is Australia.  Australia.  Land of the wee and home of the slave.  As I mentioned earlier, John Howard was crowing last night about Australia’s respect for the rule of law.  But how can we respect the rule of law and yet turn our eyes from the improper application of the law?  Howard and Philip Ruddock have both been queried on the Government’s attitude towards the treatment of Hicks and Mamadou Habib, as well as the impending trial of Hicks.  Consistently they’ve towed the party line and claimed that they’re satisfied with the assurances they have received both about the fair treatment they are getting, and the fairness of the trial that Hicks will face.    Why is it so damn impossible for Ruddock to get on the phone and demand some answers of substance as to why an antiquated kangaroo court is being used to decide the fate of an Australian citizen?  Why can’t he provide an answer to that question for us?  Where is the moral fibre in just jumping into line with big brother when all common sense, civility and worldwide legal opinion suggests that we do our fellow Australian citizens harm by doing so?  I’ll say it again.  If Hicks, Habib and all the others out there have done wrong, then throw the book at them.  But at least do it properly.  At least have the courage to stand up and say when something is wrong.  These trials are set up to the nth degree for an American Government to claim progress and success in the war on terror and once again John Howard will allow Australia to play a part in the charade.

       Couldn't resist a little more  urlLink Dubyaspeak . This is the editor's top ten:    I've been to war.  (you have?!?)  I've raised twins. If I had a choice, I'd rather go to war.   I am mindful not only of preserving executive powers for myself, but for  predecessors  as well.  You teach a child to read and he or  her  will be able to pass a literacy test.  No, I know all the war rhetoric, but it's all aimed at achieving peace.   My mom often used to say, "The trouble with W" -- although she didn't put that to words.   In 1994, there were 67 schools in Texas that were rated "exemplorary" according to our own tests.    I know what I believe. I will continue to articulate what I believe and what I believe -- I believe what I believe is right.   Africa is a nation that suffers from incredible disease.   I understand small business growth. I was one.   Families is where our nation finds hope, where wings take dream.

      Tim Dunlop over at  urlLink Road to Surfdom  linked to  urlLink this article , and I think it's worth a read for anybody with a mind to question the events and statements leading up to The War (you know the one).  Solid investigative journalism, with all links attached.   psssst. Did I mention before that the yanks shouldn't re-elect Bush?

      Remember Abu Ghraib? One of the OTHER things that was so very wrong about the conflict with Iraq. I recall a bunch right wing sites in discussion about the delicacies of the Geneva Convention, and how the Iraqis are still better off with their new-found western exposure and how there were certain intelligence requirements for some prisoners to be 'softened up' to gain more intelligence.   urlLink Right .  (Iraq War poster child, Lynndie) England, 21 and six months pregnant, sat mostly expressionless as two military investigators described a  c  a  r  n  i  v  a  l -like mentality among soldiers at the jail where mistreatment of detainees and sexual high jinks were carried out with equal giddiness.  "From the get-go, it seemed like it was just a joke," the lead investigator, Special Agent Paul Arthur, said of England's description of the mistreatment in two sworn statements. "They didn't think it was that big a deal, they were just joking around... kind of to vent their frustration."  But he noted that England did not express any frustration. "She said it was more  for  f  u  n  ."  England appeared to suppress a smile :-) as investigators described a videotape showing her having sex with Corporal Charles Graner, who prosecutors say was a ringleader of the abuse and England says is the father of the child she is carrying. And this was pretty much OK'd by Rumsfeld, cabinet member of the compassionate-conservative-moral-high-ground-right-wing US government.  Any Americans that might read this: DON'T RE-ELECT THEM!!

      Labor have agreed to the FTA with two conditions. The first concerns local media content. The second concerns 'evergreening' potential with regard to the PBS. The Prime Minister has agreed to modify the deal in terms of local media content regulations.  However it seems that when it comes to the PBS, any condition asked for, even if it only sets down specifically what various laws are supposed to do anyway (and is therefore harmless, pointless etc) means that  urlLink Labor is against the FTA .  The amendments represented nothing more than a symbolic olive branch being extended to the left-wing of the Labor Party and the union movement as compensation for the deal passing through caucus, he said.  " They're either in favour of the free trade agreement or they're not ," the Queensland MP told reporters. So on one hand, when it comes to local media, you can ask for a concession and you're OK. But if you ask for a concession on pharmaceuticals, you're against the FTA. And Anti-American.  Why?

      The US team came sixth in the World Basketball Chamionships last year.  SIXTH.  Full of NBA players and it came SIXTH.  Want some perspective?  NEW ZEALAND came fourth.  The US has won 3 straight gold medals and gone undefeated in Olympic competition since NBA players started filling Olympic teams in 1992 (the Dream Team).  This year they've had a hard time getting big name NBA players to join ranks.  The average age this year is only 23.5 years.  None of the big guys see the Olympics as a challenge, apparently.  Well WAKE UP America.   urlLink Your team got beat by Italy today .  Maybe this will set the cat amongst a bunch of complacent pigeons.

      Tony Abbott has his own personal PBS - Pathetic Bastard Syndrome. Anyone see him on  urlLink Lateline  last night? Go read the transcript and see if you can manage to decipher one peice of his commentary that isn't pure political froth and dribble.  The protection of the PBS is a fundamental question that he once again played petty politics with. The frivolous lawsuits that Labor is trying to protect against are already happening in the US. Apparently our patent laws will be enough to stop this from happening. What, the US doesn't have any patent laws? Why's it happening there, then? Under our gargantuan patent laws, the drug companies can get fined $6,000 for lodging a dodgy lawsuit. $6,000. I bet they're trambling in each of their $60,000 alligator skin shoes.  Julia Gillard asked a pretty straight forward question. If the government is straight-up about protecting the integrity of the PBS, then why won't it allow Labor's proposed amendments to go through, and thereby get it's FTA through this week?  Abbott's response: the amendments are unnecessary, unworkable (no reasons given as to why) and by the way, Mark Latham's anti-American.  I remember a time when it was bad to be called Un-Australian, but Anti-American? Is that a label that is supposed to make the average punter wince? Are well so Americanised already (sorry, Americanized) that this is supposed to be an affront to our sense of patriotism?  I hope Latham sticks to his guns on this. The PBS is crucial to thousands of Australians and it's protection is paramount. This is the thin end of the wedge for the drug companies, not just here, but also as a lever for them against other governments around the world. Australia's PBS has been examined in a bunch of other countries, with a view as to how it could benefit their citizens as it has ours. In lobbying the most powerful economy in the world to implement similar FTA's, they have an opportunity to put a quick stop to said governments implementing a PBS of their own.  The lads have drawn a line in the sand and I've a feeling the winner of this battle will win the office. We'll see. I just hope the average Aussie can see through the Anti-American crap being slung by PBS-affected gits like Tony Abbott.  I'm sending an  urlLink email off to Latho  now to spur him on.  UPDATE:  Sailing Close to the Wind has invented a Lateline/Tony Abbott drinking game.  Considering  urlLink the rules , I'm surprised he had the motor skills to type the post.

      I can do very little to add to  urlLink Michelle Grattan's analysis  of today's Labor caucus decision to pass the FTA.  It was a political necessity.  However, one hopes that he will show some savvy and  urlLink fight and fight and fight  for the protection of the PBS.  This is what scares me about the FTA.  The backdoor loopholes that the US may exploit to stifle our markets here.  Frivolous lawsuits by pharmaceuticals to stall production of generics and other such actions.  And once they're in the door, forget about getting them out again.    The NAFTA of the mid 90's saw Canada partially preserve it's power generation industry.  However if the US is ever in crisis and needs to get some power from Canada, that door, once intially opened, remains open and Canada is obliged under the agreement to continue to supply energy to the US - REGARDLESS of it's own national requirements.  There was too much bipartisan support for this not to go through, but someone's going to get hurt somewhere along the line.  Of course, we won't know who until Johnny's well and truly re-elected, and maybe then some.

      I've posted on this subject before, but never found as good an article as this one for support and research.  I work as an auditor.  As a result, I like to see evidence to support the assertions made by a set of financials, or the assertions made by a person playing a particular role in an organisation.  It worries me when there isn't a paper trail to trace events.  One would think that in a setting such as a Presidential Election in the greatest democracy in the Free World, the issues of accountability and accuracy in the voting system would be of significant importance.  Especially after Florida 2000.  You'd expect that, right?  Is there anything more fundamental than getting the result right?  Apparently there might be. A whole heap of votes in this year's US Presidential elections will be counted on electronic voting machines.  Around 36 million of the votes counted on these electronic machines (around one third of the total number of votes expected in the elcetion) will not give a voter receipt that can be recounted if there's a conflict in the number of votes.  This leaves the door open for either party to legally challenge the electoral outcome, a scenario that becomes more and more obvious, especially if the decision is a close one.  But even scarier is the potential for the vote to be fixed.  I'm going to leave out the conspiratorial parts of the article, but the threat of a non-traceable vote looms for both sides of the political race.  The potential for fraud and error is daunting. About 61 million of the votes in November, more than half the total, will be counted in the computers of one company, the privately held Election Systems and Software (ES&S) of Omaha, Nebraska. Altogether, nearly 100 million votes will be counted in computers provided and programmed by ES&S and three other private corporations: British-owned Sequoia Voting Systems of Oakland, California, whose touch-screen voting equipment was rejected as insecure against fraud by New York City in the 1990s; the Republican-identified company Diebold Election Systems of McKinney, Texas, whose machines malfunctioned this year in a California election; and Hart InterCivic of Austin   urlLink The entire article  is nine pages, too much to reproduce here, but go read it.  We may hear more on this issue come November, by which time it may be too late.

      Picked up this tip from Newsradio last night (on the way home from seeing Fahrenheit 911, funnily enough) and I think I might do an update from time to time until the US election is run and won.   urlLink Electoral Vote  is a website where you can check out the ongoing breakdown of polls taken on the US election.  The guy who runs it enters all the polling information into a spreadsheet and presents the results.  The hopeful result is one that aggregates all information and therefore balances out the various biases in the polls conducted and reported to the public.  Results are broken down state by state as well.  It helps to know a little about the US electoral college system, but fear not, he has a primer on the site to bring you up to speed.  FYI, he currently has the result as:   Kerry - 289   Bush - 232

      From  urlLink The Age  this morning:        Prime Minister John Howard today defended the record $5.2 million overseas travel bill he has racked up in the past two years. Mr Howard reportedly spent $3.9 million on taxpayer-funded overseas trips in 2002 and another $1.3 million last year. But he said every trip was justified and overseas travel was an unavoidable part of his job as prime minister.     "I have had to do a lot of travel and people who criticise that ... I'd ask them to point out which trips were unnecessary," he told ABC radio in Townsville....    "Is it unnecessary for me to go to the APEC meeting in Bangkok last year which resulted in the signing of the free trade agreement with Thailand?"  -   No.     "Was it unnecessary for me to go and see China's new leaders?"  -   No, that's OK.     "Was it unnecessary for me to go and visit (United States) President Bush on several occasions, and including most recently to go to Congress and lobby for the free trade agreement?"  -   Visiting George? Once for the FTA and how many times to hold Saddam's pistol? Yes, unnecessary and NOT OK.       And some more detail, from   urlLink The Australian :    A 10-day tour of Indonesia and the US in January-February 2002 cost taxpayers more than $1.1 million, or   $101,000     a day  . That included bedding down at the legendary five-star Willard Hotel in Washington....Another 14-day excursion in June-July 2002 to Singapore, Germany, Italy, Belgium and France produced a bill of more than $1.3 million, or   $97,000     a day  ....The UK and US are Mr Howard's destination of choice and he visited the UK six times and America four times during the two years. He made three trips to Britain during 2002, staying at the posh Claridges Hotel in London.

       I saw Fahrenheit 911 last night.  If anyone's been reading this, they'll know I'm hoping never to hear George Bush's name again after January 2005.  As such, my interest in this film was quite high to say the least.  My first impression is one of some disappointment. The stories were all there, but it seemed to me that perhaps Mikey tried to cover too much in one sitting.  It seemed a little incoherent in the direction, like 'there's one hell of a lot of stuff to bring up here, lets get a little of all of it and throw it together'.    For example, the time spent on the Marine recruiters scouring Flint for potential recruits and the time spent in Flint highlighting the delapidated state of some areas just seemed to take up time and would have possibly been best saved for some companion TV-doco or something.    I guess it will hit home harder with the American audience, which is of course, the primary target.  Any hopes that Mike had that this will have an effect on the Australian election are a bit vain.  The story was all there to be told and I think it's very important that Moore made this film.  I'm glad I saw it and I'm glad that my 16 year old stepson has seen it.  I'm really pleased that a lot of others will see it and be forced to think about the chimp in charge.  I can't see it changing anything for your average Republican in the US.  There's too much emotive lefty stuff in there that will just raise their defences.    It is a good film, an important film and it definitely is worth seeing.  I wish it was better, but it's still an important film despite its limitations and I hope a lot more people go and see it.

       I saw a street theatre performer once here in Hobart. It was during our fantasic Taste of Tasmania food festival, which is held around Christmas/New Year/Syd-Hbt-yacht-race-finish every year (the 3 are indistinguishable for importance here). After giving what was a pretty good show, Mr Performer was doing his pitch for payment and one of his lines was "and kids, if you ask your parents for some money to put in the hat, and they give you less than $20, then THEY DON'T REALLY LOVE YOU!!" It got some good laughs, I'm sure it got him paid too.  It seems the  urlLink PM and Trade celebrity Mark Vaile are trying the same line . The PM says that Labor's decision to wait on the Senate report is nothing more than an alibi, whilst Mr Vaile has done the predictable:     ''They had representation on the joint standing committee on treaties that has already made its recommendations to the parliament and this claim that `We're waiting for the Senate inquiry to report before we make a decision' is just an excuse for not making a decision.      ''It brings into question the ability to lead this nation by Mr Latham.''     Ho Hum - if daddy doesn't give you a free trade agreement, then HE DOESN'T REALLY LOVE YOU. In other Liberal Party news, Fashion Minister Brendan Nelson ( urlLink thanks GG ) refused to confirm reports that Mr Latham was spotted by his staff wearing blue socks with brown shoes.... "but I'm sure if he was, it would be yet another indication that he is not fit to lead this nation"  said a pouting Mr Nelson, dressed in suit and shirt by Versace, tie by Cardin and shoes by Jimmy Choo (a little fetish he hides quite well).  In all seriousness, I'm actually pretty pleased that there is some consideration being given to the pro's and con's of the deal. We all know that Johnny would bend over backwards to take anything Dubya handed him, so why shouldn't there be some considered examination. The Yanks seem to want it pretty bad, so they aren't going to take it off the table in a hurry. So let there be a responsible decision, rather than some street theatre ultimatum.   Suits me.
