       from: brett mills sent: thursday, january 29, 2004 14:40 pm subject: my adventures part 1     Hello everyone   Thanks for the emails and kind wishes.   I have arrived in Japan.  I caught a bus from the Osaka airport into the heart of Osaka.  Then a train to Nagoya then a train to Shin Gifu (which is the city where I live, then a train from Shin Gifu to Chajo, which is the kind of the suburb where I live.  Chajo is actually the train station name.  I am having trouble typing on this weird keyboard.  There are English letters with Japanese characters and the space bar is a lot smaller than a `normal` one.   Anyway.  I have met some nice people that are showing me around.  My falt mate is moving out on Sunday, so I will probably have some one new soon.  There are two girls that live upstairs from me, so that is good.  There names are Jess and Emma.  urlLink Jess and Emma    I went grocery shopping yesterday.  Very interesting.   I have orientation on Monday in Nagoya, and from there I will be told where I will be working.  Probably in Gifu.   Anyway, I must go now.  I am happy.  It doesn`t seem real yet.  Hopefully it will soon.   Chat later Brett

       from: brett mills sent: saturday, january 31, 2004 19:01 pm subject: my adventures part 2   Well Hello everyone.  It has been a fun few days.  Today was my first day where I did it all by myself.  I definately needed to do that.  It has built up my confidence to do more now.  Today I caught the train from my station Chajo and went into the City, Gifu.  I knew what platform and I Knew how much, but when the train arrived I had no idea if that was the one to catch so I just asked the conductor "Shin Gifu?" he nodded and then I went from there.  Everyone is so friendly and so well dressed.  The conductors on the train have immaculate uniforms with White Gloves.  Not like good old Queenslad Rail.  Everyone likes to stare at me.  I know I am good looking but I had no idea just how good looking I must be.  When  I walk around I think of Where`s Wally.  I am the only Westerner around in Gifu, I swear.  So anyway, after my train ride into Gifu, I caught another train to Nagoya (about 25 minutes away)  Nagoya is the fourth largest city in Japan. From there I then caught a Subway train to Sakae.  This is the exclusive part of Nagoya, with shops like Tiffany and Co, Louis Vouton (I am not sure how to spell that one) etc.  This is where my Orientation will be on Monday. I met up with some people that I met at the airport.  We all just wanted to see where we had to go on Monday.  We had a bit of a look around the area and then I headed home.  I am now in the 24 hour internet cafe, which is just around the corner from where I live.  The last time I was here it cost me 400yen for 1 hour and a coffee (That`s around $5) so I thought that was pretty cheap.  I am supposed to be going out for drinks tonight with the girls from upstairs to meet some other Nova staff.  Yesterday I went for a bike ride into Gifu.  It was mad.  There are no rules over here.  You just ride with the cars or on the foot paths, crossing in front of cars.  No helmets required (Yes Dad I will be careful)  Bikes are the only things that people here steal.  The girls upstairs from me have stolen a couple of bikes.  They have even had there bikes stolen and then brought back the next day with notes on them to say thankyou.   There are bikes everywhere.  I will probably end up buying one.  They are quite cheap.  I will however get a lock for it.   So I haven`t really done anything fantastic or seen any castles or anything like that.  There is a castle in Gifu that I might go to tomorrow.  I have been to a shrine that is at the end of my street.  But it is a crappy one.  I did go to an Isakia (Not sure how to spell that either)  It is a small restaurant pub type of thing, with my flat mate (who is moving out tomorrow, so I will be living by myself for a while)  The front of it just looks like someones front door.  It is amongst units and houses.  Inside there is seating for about 20 people.  They have Karaoke.  There was only 4 other people there.  We ordered some noodle dish.  I couldn`t read the menu but my flat mate could.  Then another older couple came up to us and gave us some Sake.  It was very nice.  They asked a few questions, of course I had no idea what the hell they were talking about.  They were so friendly.  I start orientation on Monday and from there I will be told where I will be working.  I will also get a mobile phone then.  I feel lost without one at the moment.   OK.  I must be off now.   Thankyou for all the emails.  Keep me informed of what is happening over there.  I know the weather is hot.  It is FREEZING here.  Hopefully it will snow soon.  I will email again next week.   Bye for now Brett

       from: brett mills sent: sunday, february 8, 2004 20:37 pm subject: my adventures part 3   Hello again everyone.  Well it has been a busy week.  I had orientation on Monday (All went well).  Met some great people.  Then I had three days of training Tues, Wed and Thur.  That again all went well and I passed.  A group of us that met at orientation all went out after our training and got a littled P`d.  It snowed while we were out and I made snow balls and threw them at people.  The group of people are from America, Canada and a few from OZ, so it was the Ozzies that were acting crazy in the snow.  I then had my first day of  real work on Friday and then finished my working week on Saturday.  It`s a pretty tough job at the moment, aparently once you have been there for a few months, it becomes quite easy.  I will tell you about the job later.  Today (Sunday) I went to Mount Kinka which is near the Gifu City (where I live)  We climbed the bloody mountain, which took about 1 hour climbing up a rock pathway.  I was a little stuffed by the time I got to the top.  On the top is Gifu Castle.  It`s pretty nice.  It has an amazing view, and there is a museum there with Samuri Masks and swords and stuff.  We were too lazy to  walk back down so we caught the rope car thing.  Like a cable car.  That took about 2 minutes to get down. Tonight I am quickly checking my emails at the local internet cafe and then I am off to a house warming party.  urlLink Gifu Castle   urlLink Samurai armour   If anyone wants to send me any little letters with CHERRY RIPES in them, please feel free.  Did you notice the subtle hint in that last sentence.  My mobile number is ?, now with this phone, it also sends emails.  If you want to send me a quick email that I can reply to straight away it is ? (I think that`s the correct address)  I can`t send text messages from the phone, I can only send emails.  I may be able to recieve text messages from you guys, someone give it a go.  (I am not sure  what extra numbers you need before my number though.  Anyway,  I have to leave now, because I have to go to the housewarming.  Thanks to everyone that has sent me emails, it is great to hear what is happening at home.  For all of you that haven`t replied, its time to get typing.  Just kidding.  I may be back tomorrow.  I have to go to the bank and open an account.  That`s going to be fun, considering they don`t speak english.  I also have to get (wait for it) an Alien registration card.  All foriegners have to register at the local council as an alien.  DODODODODOD.  I will update you all on what I am actully here for, my job, later.  I am safe, I am happy, I am having fun.  I hope you all are too.  Chat later Bretto

       from: brett mills sent: monday, february 9, 2004 22:30 pm subject: my adventures part 4    Thanks for all that sent a text message, but unfortunately I didn`t recieve them.  I also made a mistake with my phone email address.  it is (?)  So if anyone wants to send me a quick email to say hi, that I can reply to straight away, you can do it to that address.  Today, I became an alien. YEAH, and I opened a bank account.  No dramas. I also went and had a massage.  FOR FREE.  Not sure if I have mentioned this before, but there is an electrical store that has massage chairs in them.  You sit down and it is amazing.  It goes from the neck down to the feet.  Words can not describe it.  They are demo chairs, and everyone does it.  The shop keepers never come up and ask you to move on, or if you are interested in purchasing them.  I was there for about 1/2 an hour.  I can still feel it now.  The chairs cost around $2000 so I don`t think I will be getting one.  I haven`t done anything else yet.  I have Sunday and Monday off work.  I work Tuesday to Friday from 5pm to 9pm and Saturday from 1.20 to 9pm.  The lessons are 40 minutes with a 10 minute break in between to plan for the next lesson.  There is a structure to follow, ie. introductions, warm up, etc but the actual lesson is up to me.   We have text books and each student has a file.  You just need to pick a page/lesson that they have not done before.  I am getting to work 1 hour before I start just to plan my day, but most of the teachers who have been doing it for a while, arrive 10 minutes before and just choose a lesson and go from there.  There is no time to chat and have fun yet.  I need all of my 10 minutes just to get ready for the next lesson.  It`s fun, but hard work at the moment.  Lucky I am only part time.  I do 5 lessons during the week and 8 on saturday.  Full timers do 8 lessons everyday.  So compared to them, I have it easy.  The good thing about it is that outside of work, there is no stress.  I don`t need to worry about the job.  GREAT!!!  Thats about all for now.  I don`t have any major plans this week.  Lots of things I want to do and places I want to go, but they will have to wait until the money starts coming in.  Must keep an eye on the budget!!!  I hope everyone is happy and healthy.  Keep the emails coming with information on your adventures.   Till next week or beyond  Bye for now Brett

       from: brett mills sent: monday, february 23, 2004 15:04 pm subject: my adventures part 5    Hi to all  I have attached a picture of my bike.  I bought it last week. It cost 6275 yen about $75.  Brand New.  I didnt speak any Japanese, the guy didnt speak any English, but we managed to communicate, he put it together for me and I rode off.  I am free.  I have my own set of wheels.  It is great.  I can now explore different areas.  I have even put Aussie stickers on it.  urlLink My bike   So anyway, not much else has happened.  Work is fine.  But I feel as though I am on a holiday.  I only work for 4 hours a day and 8 on Saturday, so it is great.  I just have to start getting out of bed at a resonable time.  I am too lazy curled up in bed with the heater on.  Its great.  I know, everyone has told me how hot it has been in OZ.  Well here the weather has been OK.  It is starting to warm up, but I still wear my scarf and jacket outside.  My flat mate moves in on Thursday, so that should be fun.  I am going to Nagoya to visit some friends on Wednesday and have a good look around.  Apart from that nothing else too exciting to report.  I do have one weird story to tell.  So in Japan, it is illegal to Gamble.  But there are heaps of Pacinco places (not sure of the spelling) They are like poker machines, but you somehow use ballbearings.  Its like a verticle pinball machine.  I havet been yet, but when I do I will let you know more info.  Anyway, there are also Slot machine places, again like poker machines, but you dont use money.  So last night I went to a slot machine place, put 1000 yen in a machine and I got all of these tokens. (about $12)  I put them in the machine and started to somehow win.  The people that work  there were helping me, by trying to speak English but I still couldnt understand them, so they pushed buttons and then I followed.  Then all of these tokens started coming out of the machine.  I was there for about half an hour and I had filled the bottom of the machine twice.  So then I was over it.  I took my tokens up to the counter.  they then gave me a piece of paper.  I moved to the cash register type thing (remembering there is no word communication happening here, they just point) the person at the cash  register gave me these crappy toy things.  I didnt really get to have a good look at them, because he then pointed me to the door.  I walked out the door and there on the left,  of course completely seperate from the main building, was this tiny shed type building with a small window, about 30cm x 10cm, with a curtain.  I opened the window placed my crappy toys on the bench and out from the curtain poked this "hand", Only a hand, it took my things and handed me 10000 yen, (around $130)  I walked away with a very big smile.  What a JOKE the whole NO GAMBLING thing is.  I think the way they  get around it is the "HAND" is basically buying the crap off me.  They probably then sell it back to the Slot machine place.  So basically, my bike was free and I have a little money left over.  Not bad for a half hours work.  (BUT IT WASNT GAMBLING, because, that is illegal).  Thats about all I have to say now.  I hope you enjoy my story.  Thank to all who have kept me informed with whats happening at home.  Keep the emails coming.  Hopefully I will get email at home soon.  Have fun.  and I will chat later.  BYE Brett

       from: brett mills sent: tuesday, march 9, 2004 0:08 am subject: my adventures part 6    Hello all.  Well let me see what I have I been up to.  Not much really.  I went to Nagoya on Sunday.  Went to Nagoya Castle, which is huge castle in the centre of the city built on the ground (not on a mountain like the one in Gifu.)  That was fun.  I decided to explore this one alone.  Spent a few hours there, walking around the castle, which is a museum and walking through the gardens.  I also went for a walk to the Nagoya Art gallery and Science Museum, but didnt want to pay money to see those things, so I just went to the free things.  Then went to Sakae, which is part of Nagoya city.  Had a bit of a look around, picked up some Tim Tams, vegemite, Cadbury chocolate (Still waiting on those cherry ripes) and a bottle of Hardys Chardonnay.  Have to say I think I am getting over wine.  I have a taste for beer now.  Went to some friends place for dinner, ordered pizza, which was a bit of an effort (the whole language thing) but it was delivered and it was sooooo nice.  Certainly better than Pizza Hut.  Even though it had Mayo and Lettuce on it.  Had a few drinks, listened to some music and caught the last train to Gifu and then walked home.  A good day.  Lots of walking and today my legs a little saw.  urlLink Nagoya castle   This Sunday I am off to Kyoto, which should be fantastic.  I am going with Emma, (girl from Bris who lives upstairs) and her Japanese friend.  It will be good to go with a Japanese person who can explain everything to us.  The flat mate is OK.  He is 38 and American and so far not much fun. I think I had my hopes up too high and was expecting someone younger and cooler to hang out with.  Oh well.  Well see how long this lasts.  I am thinking of moving out of Gifu and into Nagoya where a lot of my friends live.  Work will still pay for the transport cost into Gifu for work.  There is a huge apartment complex in Nagoya where a lot of foreigners live and there is a lot more to do there.  I am going to give it a month or so, but this is a possibility.   Emma is possibly going to Hawaii in June and has asked me if I want to go.  I am thinking about it.  It costs 80,000 yen (around $900) for 5 nights including airfare and accommodation.  Definately something to think about.  Was also talking to some friends about going to Osaka in May for a couple of days, and then of course I want to go to Tokyo.  So much to do.  I have to start planning these things though so I can start saving for them.  I get my first pay next Monday.  About time.  I am going to call tomorrow about Japanese lessons.  It cost about $2 for 90min and I will try to do them atleast once a week.  Everything else is fine.  Still having fun.  There are a lot of people leaving here at the moment so there will be lots of new people to meet.  Food is OK.  Havent tried anything too weird yet.  McDonalds is still my favourite and the burgers come out fresh.  Not all dried up like at home. YUM.  Everyone keeps paying out on me on how much McDonalds I eat.  Oh well. Its safe.  Thats about it for now.  My bike is still great.   Work is great.  SO NOT stressfull.  I love it.  Will email again soon.  I hope everyone is happy and healthy.  Keep the emails coming.  I love hearing about things at HOME.  Brett

       from: brett mills sent: wednesday, march 17, 2004 12:19 pm subject: my adventures part 7   Well hello everyone.  It has been a fun filled weekend for me.  Let me start with Sunday.  SUNDAY I went to Kyoto.  That was a beautiful city.  I went to a temple called Sanju-Sangen-do.  There are 1001 Gold statues and a Large Golden Buddah in the centre.  It is huge and very amazing.  There were these statues of Gods also.  Then Name translates to 33 lengths.  which is the length of the building that the statues are housed.  It is HUGE.  Every one of the 1001 gold statues are different in some way, yet they look exactly the same.  Its hard to explain but it was amazing.  Then we went to another temple shrine thing.  Dont really know the difference but anyway this was huge too.  I even went up to a Buddah and prayed. (I KNOW, me and religion, me and praying) Dont worry Bec I havent converted from our special religion.  I then went to a street of small shops and bought some amazing souveniers.  urlLink  Kiyomizu Temple in Kyoto    We then spent over an hour on a bus infact we went around in circles, because the Japanese people we were with didnt know where we were.  That was a little disappointing as the majority of the day was spent on public transport.  It took 2 hours on two different trains to get to Kyoto and then we caught busses to the temples.  I will deffinately go back again.  I want to have a look at Gion which is the Geisha district, although it is quite  hard to see them.  Gion is where the book `Memoirs of a Geisha` was set.  So Sunday was a full on tiring day, but I had a great time.  MONDAY Well this was probably one of the best and strangest days I have had.  Some friends were going to a festival and I thought I may as well tag along.  It was a fertility festival, or as all of the thousands of Westerners were calling it, the Penis festival.  There were little stalls with food and souveniers and everything was in the shape of penises.  Very strange.  It was not disgusting, as this may sound, it was just something that most of us  did not understand.  What happens is there is a procession from one temple to another and in the procession, a group of men carry a 3metre wooden penis (have a look at the picture attached).  There are special dignatories walking along also and other people carrying small penises (let see how many times I can say that word in one email, sorry Grandma if you are reading this)  Then at the end of the procession is a big barrel with Sake and they give a cup to anyone who wants one.  Or as there were a lot of westerners there, several cups.  As well as a few beers, I probably had 5 cups of sake,  very nice, but as you could imagine, during the day drinking in the sun, I was a little worst for wear by the end.  We just kept following the sake and asking for more.  This was not a festival for just adults, there was a school group of 10 year olds there watching, and lots of older Japanese people and heaps of us westerners.  At the end, the penis goes into the temple.  But I`m not sure what happens then.  urlLink  Me at Penis festival     urlLink  The 3m Wooden Penis    urlLink  The Sake Tree    Then everyone stands in one area and these people throw Mouchy (not sure of the spelling, it is a japanese food, that you heat under a low temperature.  It is made of rice I think, but it is basically like flour and water.  I dont think it is very tasty.)  It is as hard as a rock and they throw it from up high.  If it hits you in the head, It would definately hurt.  I managed to catch one, with a beer in my right hand I stuck my left hand up and I got it.  My hand was a little sore after that.  Not sure what it means, maybe it means I will be really fertile??????  After that we then went back to Gifu and had more beer and dinner.  I had to leave at 9pm, because I had a headache.  So I just went to bed.  It was certainly an eventful weekend.  I worked my usual 4 hours yesterday (Tuesday) and now I have another two days off, so I am off to Nagoya to see some friends, and celebrate St Patricks day.  Not sure what I will be doing tomorrow, I am staying overnight in Nagoya.  So I discovered a Japanese festival, I was told this was one of the best festivals around.  I hope they all have free sake.  Coming up to Cherry Blossom time, there are going to be a lot of festivals, so I cant wait.  Well thanks for reading about my little adventure, I hope everyone at home is happy.  Keep the emails coming of what you have been up to.  Chat Soon Bretto

       from: brett mills sent: tuesday, march 30, 2004 11:00 pm subject: my adventures part 8    Nothing much to report this week.  It has been 2 months since I landed in this beautiful country.  I am still enjoying myself and I feel really at home in Gifu.  Although I am still thinking about moving to Nagoya.  We`ll see what happens.   I passed my probation period, so that means more money and still no stress. I love saying that don't I.  Sorry for all of you back at home who are stressed out right now reading this.  Went to Karaoke on Sunday night with about 20 other people for a couple of teachers that were leaving.  It was lots of fun, everyone singing actually screaming to a heap of different songs.  I have been working and sleeping mainly this week.  I love sleeping in when it is cold and the weather has been a little rainy so even better for laying in bed watching DVD`s.  Speaking of DVD`s, I have now stuffed my computer, it will only play region 2 DVD`s, which means I can only watch Japanese movies.  So when I get home I wont be able to use it.  I know someone at work who is going to have a look to see if he can change it.  Oh well It`s OK for the next 10 months anyway.   I bought myself a stereo system for $90 which is great because I can now listen to music instead of watching TV that I have no idea what is happening.  I am probably going to a nice park on Sunday, which will be good as it is the start of the Cherry Blossom season.  I will be taking lots of photos of that.  Cherry Blossom season also means lots of festivals, and hopefully that means free sake in the sun again.  YEAH!!!  Well that's about all.  Short and sweet just like the Japanese girls.  Hope you are all Genky (happy)  Chat later Bretto

       from: brett mills sent: friday, april 16, 2004 22:13 pm subject: my adventures part 9   Konbanwa (Good evening for all those who don't understand my new language)  Lets face it, I don't even understand my new language.  It has been a while since I sent a group email, so let me see, I will start from the start of April.  April is the season of Cherry Blossoms, beautiful flowers on trees with no leaves that are pink and white in colour.  They only flower for about 2 weeks so you have to get out and quickly have a look.  They were beautiful.  I took some great photos.  They of course are all gone now, they seem to disappear over night.  urlLink  Cherry blossoms    I haven't been doing a lot, I was sick with the flu for a couple of weeks, it just wanted to hang on there. Just when I though I was getting over it, I started to loose my voice.  I didn't totally loose it which was a blessing for the people around me, because everyone must hear me!  I have started to take Japanese lessons, I have done three now and I am finding it a little mitsukoshi (difficult, well I think that's what it means) I go to lessons on Wed and Fri at 10am which is a little annoying because it cuts in on my sleeping time.  The lessons cost a grand total of $2.50 for 1 1/2 hours.  Its great.  Hopefully I will be able to speak the language soon, but in the mean time I will continue to point and hope they understand me.  Work is still the same.  It is getting easier and I am having lots of fun.  I taught my students nagging yesterday which was a fun lesson, asking one student to ignore the other and then that person had to keep pushing and asking questions.  Everyone was laughing.   I went to a night club last week, one room was hip hop, which I so do not understand and the other was techno which was a lot of fun.  All the Japanese were on the dance floor just moving a little and there was me in the centre dancing like a spastic, arms up in the air doing a bit of a waltz, apparently the Japanese people behind me were watching me and trying to copy my dance moves.  Move over John Travolta here comes Brett.  I haven't been to any Karaoke for a while but when I do Grease Lightning is of course my favourite song to sing.  I even have a few moves.  The flatmate is OK.  Well we don't really talk much, he goes to his room and I go to my room.  When we do see each other we talk, but we don't share any common interests, except of course chocolate, which is the international language for YUM.  I am still thinking of moving out and I will probably have a look at some places on Sunday.  It just takes a bit of effort and I really couldn't be bothered, plus I don't know how I would actually move my stuff.  You cant take big bags on the trains as there is simply no room.  We`ll see what happens.  Easter was a non event.  Mum sent me some cherry ripes and Timtams, which was great.  But as far as Easter and Japan are concerned they have no idea about it.  I tried to teach my students but really me and religion don't mix so I failed.  I just told them we eat chocolate on Sunday but I don't know why.  I was planning a trip to Tokyo in a couple of weeks but the people I was going to go with pulled out.  I am still going to look into it and may end up going by myself.  I would catch the Shinkansen (Bullet train) as it only takes a couple of hours as opposed to bus which takes about 8 hours.  The only down side is that it is very expensive, so I will have to start saving for that one.  The weather is starting to warm up, which is great, I even managed to find a park a few weeks ago that had grass, so I laid down and watched people.  There is no grass in this country, so when you find some, you must claim it as yours, before some else does.  Mind you, you will be sharing that patch of grass with 72 other people but so long as you have enough room to lay down, its all good.  I`m going for a day trip on Monday to some place with some friends.  Not sure where, but I`m sure it will be fun.  I will hang out in Nagoya on Sunday (that seems to be a thing I do a lot at the moment, that's where most of my friends live, so that's where I want to move to)  I am going to a fleamarket and will hopefully pick up some interesting and cheap  souvenirs.  Well that's about all, no other plans, and I haven't done much else, have been to a few restaurants / Isakia`s (Japanese type of pub)  Have been eating a lot of sashimi (raw fish) and Sushi and I even managed to make sushi for a party I went to.  I would like to learn how to make it properly, maybe I should take a class. I wont be able to understand them.  hmmmm  maybe I will just make it the way I do, its a lot easier and less hastle.  OK, Must be off, I have been here for a few of hours now, I will hopefully have email at home next week, I have been waiting for about 3 weeks already, so I am not holding my breath.  But when or if I get it at home, I will be able to update you all of my adventures in this amazing country more frequently.  I hope everyone is having a great time at home.  Of course don't forget the emails next Tuesday the 20th of April.  I have already found two big grey hairs, I am getting sooooo old.  Keep me updated of your adventures and any world breaking news, as I still don't understand the news here.  Chat/Email later.  Bye for now Buretto san

       from: brett mills sent: friday, april 23, 2004 14:30 pm subject: my adventures part 10   Hey everyone  Just a quick message to say thanks for the birthday wishes.  I had a great day and night.  I made all my lessons revolve around birthdays and I made the students sing happy birthday to me.  It was very funny.  After work I went to an Isakia (Japanese Bar) where we had a private room with Karaoke.  There was about 20 people I didn't actually know all of them, but we had a great time there singing, eating and lots of drinking.  After that we went to Shidax which is a Karaoke place with private rooms, where you pay one price per hour and get all you can drink and sing.  We stayed there until 2.30am and then walked home.  The next day I was fine, I slowed down a bit at the end.   urlLink  Me, Hally, Allisyn and Kylie    urlLink  Me and Allisyn singing VOGUE    Last week I went to Nara.  It took about 3hours on train.  There was a huge Koen (park) there with free ranging deer, that you can feed.  I visited lots of shrines and temples.  It was a beautiful day.   urlLink  Nara Koen    This weekend I am off to Hiroshima which is about 8 hours on a bus.  We will be sleeping on the bus Saturday night and arrive at 7am on Sunday, spend the entire day looking around where the first atomic bomb hit Japan, visiting the Torri (Shinto Gate) that is in the middle of the water.  It is apparently a very moving place to visit.  After that we will catch the 11pm bus back and arrive home Monday morning.  Its going to be a very long day.  I was going to go to Tokyo this weekend, but the people I was going with pulled out.  Oh well, this will be good too.  Its on my list of things to do while I am here.  Japanese lessons are going good.  It is very hard, but I am getting there.  Still a long way to go until I can have a conversation.  I need to do lots of practice at home.  For all those that can understand Japanese, my last email I wrote that Japanese was MITsukoshi.  I actually meant MUSakoshi (Difficult) Mitsukoshi is the name of a department store.  OOPS.  OK, must me off now.  Running out of time.  Hope everyone is cool.  Chat soon Brett

       from: brett mills sent: tuesday, april 27, 2004 1:20 am subject: my adventures part 11   Well this weekend has been long, tiring, amazing, sad and in all a great weekend.  It started on Saturday: woke up at around 11am, breaky, got ready for work and then off I went.  It was an OK day, just the same realy with McDonalds for lunch etc.  After work I got changed and off I went to Nagoya.  Arrived around 10pm ish, picked up some beer for the trip, of course cracked one open before the bus even arrived and then at 11pm I caught the bus (which would be the longest bus ride ever) to Hiroshima.  About 8 hours of trying to sleep in a slightly reclined seat.  Not Happy Jan, OH well it was cheaper than taking the bullet train although about 7 hours longer.  Anyway arrived in Hiroshima at around 7am, found a little cafe and had the wake up coffee, well I didn't actually get any sleep, but I needed something the perk  me up.  We were to spend the next 14 hours walking around.  After breaky we, (friends from orientation, Allisyn, Kylie and Brad) caught the tram to the a Ferry terminal then hoped on the 10 minute ferry to an island called Miyajima.  This island was amazing, it would be so nice to live there.  There was deer walking around freely, many lanterns along the water front, a shrine, pagodas and of course the thing that everyone comes here for, the floating (well its not really floating) Torii (Shinto Gate and the symbol of Shintoism)  This Torii is in the middle of the water and is definately a must see if any of you ever come to Japan.  urlLink The Torii   After looking around the island and taking many photos, we headed back to Hiroshima.  We visited the A Bomb dome, which was one of the only buildings left standing after the first ever atomic bomb was dropped in August 1945.  It is now for ever preserved in the Peace Memorial park.  This park is so tranquil, with many monuments to Visit and reflect what tragedy these people went through at the time.  There are many people looking around, some   sitting on the banks of the river playing guitars, singing, or just relaxing.  The weather was perfect.  There is also an amazing museum that tells you all about the bomb and surprisingly it tells you both sides of the story about the war, not just that America dropped it but also about Japan's roll in the war, with Pearl harbor etc.  The museum is very descriptive with  many photos of what people looked like (not a happy site) also there is a watch that stopped at the exact time, peoples reflections that actually lived through it, and also parts of bodies.  Needless to say  there weren't many dry eyes in the place.  Again definately a place to visit in Japan.  urlLink A bomb dome   After looking around the museum and monuments in the park, (probably around 5pm) we decided to grab some beer and head back to Miyajima to check out the sun set.  That was amazing, I managed to get a photo with the sun setting in the middle of the torii.  Also at this time, the water was at low tide, so I walked out to the torii and had a close look. BEAUTIFUL.  urlLink The Torii at sunset   This was the end to a perfect day.  We headed back to Hiroshima and had dinner.  We had okinimiaki. I don't know how to explain it, I guess it is a flour, egg, cheese, prawn omelet type of thing but with less egg, so its not really an omelet.  It was nice and is pretty much a standard thing to eat here.  urlLink Okinimiaki   We then headed back to the bus, around 10pm and headed back to Nagoya.  Another 8 hours, this time I managed to sleep, although it was uncomfortable. Arrived in Nagoya at about 6.30am, hoped on the train back to Gifu and climbed into bed.  Well that is about the extent of my weekend.  A very long and exciting day.  I'm off to work tomorrow as usual.  I don't have any other big trips planned for a while, I think I need a rest.   Again, I hope you all are great, sorry for such a long email.  Chat soon Brett

       from: brett mills sent: tuesday, 1 june 2004 2.25am subject: my adventures part 12   Well hello everyone  It’s been over a month since my last group email so I thought I had better pull my finger out and let you all know what I have been up to.  I’ve been here for 4 months now, and I am still loving it.  The country, the job, the people, the free time, the travelling.  Everything.  Be prepared this is a long one.  You might want to print it out and read it at home.  My last email was in April after my trip to Hiroshima.  I haven’t been to any other exciting cities since that one.  I’ve just been hanging out in Gifu and Nagoya.  I’ve been to a few parties, and a few bars.  Lots of people here are starting to leave, so there are plenty of going away parties.    The two girls from upstairs are leaving so I will have new neighbours in a few weeks, plus my flat mate is moving out in two weeks so again another new flatmate.  Hopefully I will have more in common with this one, but I’m not getting my hopes up.  As for me moving to Nagoya with Allisyn (girl that I met at orientation), that has now been squashed.  She has decided to move to Osaka.  That’s great for her, but I was a little disappointed.  More the fact that again I got my hopes up and something went wrong.  I have now decided to live life for me, and do what I want to do when I want to do it.  Chances are if I move to Nagoya, other people will move away and I will be alone.  Gifu is fine and with the new people moving in, it should be pretty exciting.  urlLink Allisyn    Saturday we had a party at the regular going away place, Warra Warra, in Gifu.  Lots of other teachers plus plenty of Japanese students.  After that, as usual, we went next door to Shidax (the Karaoke place).  Then at about 2am, I stumbled home.    Last week I went to a house warming party.  It was a quiet one with just a couple of beers.  Anyway I met this Japanese guy who works for an English Language school.  He told me he was looking for part time or substitute teachers, so I gave him my details.  Today I had an interview, and I should know by the end of the week if I will get some extra work through him.  It’s an easier job than the one I have.  No real structure, casual clothes (with slippers of course) and just talking for 55 minutes, teaching the students some new vocab and correcting grammatical errors.  My job with NOVA is fine.  Its just the same old boring job.  I am definately glad I am not full time, as it becomes very monotonous.  I now have a regular kids class every Thursday.  Just one kid and I always ask him what day is it today and he looks at the card I have with Thursday on it and says TUESDAY!  Oh well hopefully he will realise soon.  He is a lot of fun, even farting in class (CHARMING!)  We had a party a few weeks ago with all the teachers of my school and the Japanese staff that work there.  It was at Shidax, so a lot of drinking and singing and heaps of food.  It was good to see people outside of work, especially the Japanese staff who have now opened up to us at work.  urlLink Staff and Teachers Party   urlLink Doing YMCA   The weather here is starting to get hot (atsui).  The other day I was in my perfectly climate controlled air-conditioned room (the joys of not having to pay electricity bills, you can use the air con all the time), anyway, I had a bit of a hangover so I got out of bed at about 1pm, I walked outside and the heat hit me.  It was like being in an oven.  No air, overcast and very hot.  Its not even summer yet, so I can just imagine what its going to be like in the peak of summer.  People tell me that this heat is nothing.  In summer they hand out plastic fans with advertising on them, and everyone just stands around fanning themselves.  I was told that people wear their suit jackets in summer to hide the sweat marks under their arms.  I had better get used to it, and you had all better get used to my complaining about the weather.  Last week I went to my first Japanese shopping centre.  It was like Toombul shopping centre with a Toyota car sales section with about 30 cars inside.  A bit weird.  I bought a work shirt and tie, plus I went to this shop that is like a Myer and bought some fireworks for $10.  So we went down to the park a few nights ago and let them off.  They were just small fireworks and colourful sparklers.  It was fun.  We were next to the lake, just in case something went wrong.  urlLink Fireworks   urlLink Me with fireworks   I thought I would also tell you all about my thoughts, views and experiences on a few Japanese things, now that I have been here for a while.  TRANSPORT: Japanese transport is fantastic.  Almost everything is on or within close proximity of a train.  There are three train companies, JR is the main company and runs everywhere, I think its government run, Kintetsu that looks after one part of the country and Meitetsu that looks after another part of the country.  I use Meitetsu.  There are a few bad things about the trains however.  It is expensive!  It cost me about $7 for a one-way trip from Gifu to Nagoya, and I do that at least once a week.  The Shinkansen is the bullet train (I haven’t been on it yet) but everyone uses it to go far distances.  It would cost about $125 for a one-way trip from Nagoya to Tokyo.  So I had better save up for that trip.  Another bad point is the fact that the trains finish at around 11.30pm, so when I go somewhere on a train at night, if I miss the train I need to have a back up accommodation planned, or if I am close to home I just walk.  The trains are always busy.  At 10pm it’s like peak hour in Brisbane central.  They have mastered running the trains.  They are always on time and everyone lines up in front of the doors, waiting for them to open.  No pushing in.  When you get in however you get pushed as more and more people are packing in.  You have about 5cm between you and the next person, and this is in Nagoya.  In Tokyo you have even less space than that.  There is a subway system in Ngaoya and all other major cities that is also fantastic.  The most amount of time I have had to wait is 5min, but again it’s expensive.  urlLink Train Drivers   Taxis are strange.  They are all old boxy Toyota Corolla type cars with doyley’s on the seats, and the taxi drivers all wear shirt and tie with a hat and white gloves.  Very professional.  The back passenger door is automatic.  When you go up to the taxi or when you are about to leave, the driver automatically opens and closes it.  Of course there are also busses and Gifu still has trams but they are getting rid of them next year.  I haven’t been on a tram, but I did catch a bus in Kyoto, which was the same as at home but smaller and cleaner.  SHOPPING: As I said earlier I went to my first Japanese shopping centre.  That was fun, but they are very few and far between.  There are plenty of department stores in the cities, but they are different to the ones at home.  A lot smaller and they basically only sell clothes, no electrical items or CDs etc.  Also in the subway’s is a whole other world underground.  Food shops, clothes shops everything you need.  You could easily spend hours and hours underground looking around at these shops.  It’s a maze and every time I am there I get lost and need to find an exit and go upstairs and work out where I am.  JAPANESE PEOPLE: What can I say.  They are amazing, friendly, helpful and seem to treat westerners with a lot of respect.  They are still stairing at me a lot, which is starting to get on my nerves.  It doesn’t matter where I am, people are not just looking at you but stairing.  You couldn’t even think about scratching yourself or picking you nose as some one is looking at you.  Most people want to learn English, hence all of the millions of English schools here and the ability to get private students and charge them $30+ per hour to talk.  I haven’t been able to find a private place with no one around, except of course my bedroom.  There are people everywhere.  Not just one or two but hundreds.  One bad point, well its not really bad, just different, they are such a reserved group of people.  It takes a long time for them to open up and tell you partly what they are thinking.  My students are only just now starting to tell me about their private lives.  FOOD: Different, nice, oishi (delicious) and unusual are the words to describe Japanese food.  Sometimes I just really want a turkey and salad panini, but I have to settle for Sushi.  Don’t get me wrong, I LOVE sushi and sashimi and it has become pretty much a staple in my diet (my supermarket sells fresh sushi for about $2 for two rolls), but sometime I feel like eating something like I used to at home.  I have been to a restaurant where you choose kebabs of meat, fish or vegetables that you roll in batter and cook in you own deep fryer built into the table.  Very nice.  Plus I had Okinimiaki in Hiroshima (see my last email for that one), and sometimes I crave a box set of miso soup, pickled radish, rice and a meat dish with a green tea.  Usually I just eat “Normal” food.  Bread, which only comes in a packet of maximum of 8 slices, cereal, sandwiches of tuna and salad or toast with vegemite.  It is so easy to be a vegetarian here (so long as you eat fish) as red meat is so thin and it is very tokai (expensive).  I do of course, as I did at home, still rely on McDonalds as another staple in my diet.  I usually go there at least once a week.  The burgers in Japan actually look like the ones in the pictures and they are fresh.  They don’t sit under the heat lamps for 5 minutes.  urlLink Sushi and Sashimi    I think that’s about all I can talk about (thank god, I hear you say).  I don’t have any plans to go anywhere in the near future, I still need to go back to Kyoto, and I want to go to Osaka and Tokyo.  I am thinking about going to China in January, but we’ll see about that.  Japanese lessons are still happening and are getting a little easier.  I can make sentences now. WOW!  I am still having difficulty learning the alphabets and trying to write them too.  I am thinking about doing some classes on something Japanese.  Maybe meditation or calligraphy or origami.  Not sure I will have to look into that.  As well as the job interview I had today, I have also advertised myself to get some private students, so hopefully I will be rolling in the money soon. Ha.  I hope everyone is having fun at home.  Please continue sending me updates on home and your lives.  If you have some spare time you can also check out my website: brettsmills.blogspot.com here you will find my past emails and photos, plus listen to triple J live and visit some of my favourite websites, like Big Brother of course, which I am currently watching while typing this email at 2am.  Have fun and I will chat or email again soon  Bye for now  Brett

      from: brett mills  sent: wednesday, 28 july 2004 1.47pm  subject: my adventures part 13   Well Hello everyone.   Another month has past which brings me up to 6 months living here in Japan.&nbsp; I have now extended my Visa for a further 6 months, so I wont be home until January next year or possibly even a further 6 months after that. July 2005.   It has been a busy month, and I thought I would write to tell you all what I have been doing. There are lots of new faces around, which is great and I have had to say goodbye to a lot of close friends. The girls, Emma and Jess, who lived upstairs have gone back to OZ. It was sad to say goodbye to them, but they seem to be having a good time getting on with their lives at home, as am I here. My flat mate moved out, no great loss there, although we were actually starting to speak to each other in the end. I now have a new flatmate. Eric from America. Yes another annoying American. He is actually pretty cool and we have lots of laughs together. He has become a close friend. Two of my friends that I met at Orientation, Kylie and Allisyn have asked to be transferred to other cities, so they will be leaving in September. Allisyn and I have become quite close these past few months, so I will be sad to see her go. I will be sad to see Kylie go too.  urlLink Emma   urlLink Jess   urlLink Eric   urlLink Allisyn and Kylie   My adventures this month have taken me to Innuyama, which is a small city near Gifu, where I live. It has the only original castle in the country.&nbsp; The only one that was not destroyed in any wars or fires etc. So that was nice to go to. I also visited another temple in the area and went to my first Tea House for green tea. Delicious.   urlLink Innuyama Castle   urlLink Emma and Motto   I also went to a bbq with some friends in a park. Very interesting and fun. Of course over here, grass is a rare thing, even in a park. There is just dirt, so no laying in the sun on the grass here. At the park were a heap of kids playing soccer, so we Gaijin (foreigners) decided to join in. It was so much fun running around with them, then at half time they came over to our spot and had some drinks and chips. Parents would drive past and tell the kids its time to go, but they said no, I will come home later. The parents were fine with it. They were safe with us. I think.   urlLink Playing Soccer in the park   I went to a Japanese cultural festival and watched Karate, made some origami, learnt the art of tea ceremony and flower aranging, which was a lot of fun too.   urlLink Tea Ceremony   urlLink My Flower Arrangement   I went to a Sumo match a couple of weeks ago. 5 hours of watching big fatties try to push each other outside a rope circle. Of course it was more interesting than that, but thats the basics of the game. It is actually quite fun to watch, especially toward the end when the really good wrestlers come out and put on a show for the crowd.   urlLink Sumo   One thing Gifu is famous for is the Commorant fishing. This is a hundreds of years old tradition, where two men dressed in special clothing go out in a woden boat and about 20 Commorant birds that have a ring around there neck and rope that the fisherman holds onto. The birds then catch fish, but due to the ring, they cant swallow it. Another guy gets the bird and takes the  fish out of its mouth. Quite cruel if you think about it, but as it is a traditional thng, I guess its ok. &nbsp;A few of us took some beers and fireworks and sat on the pebble bank next to the river where they do this and watched and let of our firworks. You can go out on a different boat that follows the fishermen to see up close what they are doing. I am planning that in the future.   urlLink Commorant Fishing   Last week I went to a small festival which was to celebrate two stars that come together. It was a four day event and I went on the final day. I watched some dancing and looked around. It was like a small carnival in the streets of a city. Again, lots of fun.   I have now started my second job teaching in Nagoya. I work for 2 hours on Monday night and 1 hour on Tuesday morning. Its pretty easy and the students there are a lot of fun. There are no kids, just adults either doing it for a hobby, for work or to travel. Its about $25 per hour plus  they pay for transport, so thats good. Although I was supposed to go in one day to pick up some paper work, but totally forgot. They rang me and said where are you, just then the penny dropped and I apologised prefusly. Not a good start. But they seem to like me now.   Speaking of work, Nova has been annoying me a little lately. It all started a few weeks ago when a Japanese staff member came up to me and said sign this. Nothing else. I read it and it was to work at another school for two days a week for 1 month. I didnt mind doing that, but was quite annoyed that no one asked me to do this or atleast had the decensee to speak to me about it. That month has not been extended to 2 months. But I actually like the school, so its all good. Then last week I was told that I am going to be transferred permantely to another school. Again, no talking to me about it, just here it is, this is whats happening. This is a different school to the help ship that I am doing two days a week. I know all the teachers there, so agian it should be ok. I just wish they knew how to treat people with respect. Maybe I should do a lesson on that.   Anyway with the school I work at two days a week, it is a big kids school. So there fore I have to teach classes of up to 8 kids ranging from about 5 to 12. The small kids are good, the bigs kids are also good, but the ones in between have been causing me a little bit of stress. They dont listen.&nbsp; Im sure they have never been disciplined in their lives. They dont speak English. They can speak a little but they think it is funny to speak in Japanese about me, like calling me Bukka Sensai (Stupid teacher) CHARMING.&nbsp; Im sure you are all aware how happy I am about that. This week however has been my first break through with them. We actually had a bit of fun. Although they still like to hit male teachers in areas that are a little sensitive and they like to try to shove there fingers up your umm..... (im sure you know where) One kid tried this yesterday and I turned around and looked at him and said WHAT ARE YOU DOING and jut shook my head. He then said something in Japanese and I decided we should all sit down now. I have heard horror stories about that little trick. Apparently it is the thing to do. I have no idea. My new school, which I start next week, will take me about 1/2 hour to get to instaed of my usual 10 minutes, and is also the biggest kids school in the area. So that should be fun! Its in a shopping centre and there is McDonalds so atleast there are two benefits. I am going to miss a lot of my students from Gifu. And they will miss me too. Im sure.   On Tuesday morning at about 1am. I experienced my first earthquake. I was both excited to have experienced this and also scared. It lasted about 4 seconds, and was so weird the way the entire building felt like it was made or rubber. I was laying down reading (YES I AM READING) and all of a sudden it hit. I was yelling out to Eric. WOW, THERES AN EARTHQUAKE! He is from Callifornia so he wasnt as excited as me. He's used to it.   I decided that after 5 months of not having a hair cut and with the temperature becoming hotter and hotter, that it was time to get my mullet cut. The curls were also becoming very annoying. So I asked a student where to go, and she suggested a place near where I live. I found the place, tried to speak some Japanese, they tried to speak English and evetually I pointed to a picture and said this will do. 1 hour, a shampoo, cut, shampoo, little conversation, a massage and $50 later, it was done. I was happy. It was quite weird. When you get your hair washed, they put a  blanket over your legs, and a cloth over your face. Then after they cut they massage your head and then your neck. I was laughing through the massage as it was a little unusual, but relaxing.   urlLink My Curls   I have plans in a couple of weeks to go to a Fireworks festival in Gifu, which is one of the biggest displays in the area. And there fore attracts thousands of people. I have bought a Yukata (Summer Kimono) and if I do say so myself, I look quite smashing in it. I figured, everyone looks at me anyhow, so I may as well give them something to really look at.   urlLink My Yukata   I am also going, hopefully, to Mt Fuji next month and if I am fit enough, will attempt to climb it. That should be exciting.   I&nbsp;now have a webcam, so if anyone is on MSN Messenger, send me a message and we can have a chat. I also now have Yahoo messenger and AOL messenger. Just send an email to my phone brettinjapan@c.vodafone.ne.jp when you are on line and I will log on.   I hope you are all cool. I am boiling. The temperature is in the high 30's and will probably get hotter. Thank god for Air conditioning.   Let me know what you have been up to.   Chow for now   Brett
