      You know, I was watching Boy Meets World the other day ((yesterday probably)) and it was the one where Tapenga finds out she has to move, then right when Cory was going to run away to her [new] house, he opens hs door and *there she is* Well, that didnt go over too well with his parents because they thought the two of them were too young to feel the way they said they did. But once Tapenga's aunt came to pick her up, their views changed. Why? Because they were hit with the cold, hard truth. There was this amazing true love in front of them and that's not something you can deny-ever. No matter what the age is, anyone can be in love.   Anyways, only 4 MORE DAYS!!!! =D yay! So so so excited! And Exactly ONE MONTH till Scotland!!!!=-o WHAT??!? YESS! I can tell I'm getting close because I got my money holder thing, and applied for a credit card, and am learning how to convert the money and OY! it's SOO CLOSE! --remember to give me your address if you want mail from me while I'm gone!--   peace.n.love!    btw))I was over-worried last night, all is well, I was forgiven!=)

      well-- this is my first {blog} entry... and i'm going to try to keep this thing up, but  we'll see  how that goes!        Mom's in madison today and i'm supposed to be cleaning the house, but i'd really  rather not.. so who knows! Stephan's camping until  Sunday=(  Which means i really REALLY don't have much to do!        Last night I got a nice little  unexpected  ((except for the call 15  minutes before hand)) visit from a good friend I havent seen since February!! That was quite nice! It made me realize that I miss my old crew..*sigh* So I tried to talk to +msr+ today but as soon as i IMed her, she  put an away message up,  but I kept talking thinking she might put it down when she realized i was trying to talk to her-- no such luck. i basically just told her i wanted to hang out sometime and that it'd be great if she called, but somehow i  doubt  that'll happen =-/               ah well, i should probably get going-- i s'pose i'll do some laundry for my mom!=)  [peace.n.love]
