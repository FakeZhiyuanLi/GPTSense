      i thought i won't jump in the bandwagon of bloggers but i guess i'm sucked into at last. just needed some place to express myself. writing is too tiring. typing is better, i guess. cheers to the latest blogger in the world. what a sucker!  i just watched dawn of the dead today. well i was bored throughout the whole movie except for some parts. overall it was kinda boring. 28 days later was much better. these zombie movies made me start thinking about life. if it really happens, would i be a survivor or would i turn into one at the early stages? if being a survivor means to suffer, then i would rather die. so i would choose neither.  i miss my life. i hate doing the same thing every single day. wake up at 6am. take the stupid penguin. change to my no.4 or tunic. wait for the day to end. change to my CV. take the stupid penguin. go home or meet yati then go home. then sleep. there's no time for me to actually to progress to a new level. i could learn new things if only i have the time. learn how to drive, ride a bigger bike, curl a ball like david beckham, cook new stuff, draw, edit pictures and videos and lots more. if only i have the time. i feel lazy every single day. the abrasion on the left side of my body and lack of transportation doesn't help. can't wait to ORD.  it's always about National Service. i admit it. i hate National Service. even more than the Jews.

      another day of truth. i found out today that my gf of five years has simply nothing in common with me. even though i had my suspicions, today was the day it really struck me in the head. well, i think i over exaggerated. we have little in common. sometimes i think i'm not being fair to her. and vice versa. she really does deserve someone more stable in life than me. i am a piece of crap shit boyfriend after all.

      like i said in my last blog.. it's all about national service. does everyone in life go through depression? i know i do. and here i am feeling that same shitty feeling even though nothing bad happened to me or to the ppl around me. i read that depression is a disease and it can be treated. maybe my cure is to escape the clutches and chains of the government and be free. i heard sfb is going to sponsor half of the budget if any foreign director came to singapore to shoot. but they won't support any local filmaker. i heard they want to turn this country into an art city and sport city but again they won't support it. strict censorship. how to be artistic? strict education. how to be champions in sports? the singapore pledge has the word equality mentioned. how can i sign for the saf if they show no justice and equality? navy - muslims are out of bounds. air force - no muslim fighter pilots. army - none in combat engineer, or scouts or commandos(maybe one or two). are we not good enough? reason they give - our neighbourong countries are muslim countries. so does that mean when there's any war against these countries, we won't fight for singapore?   how can i love a country which won't trust it's own citizens?

      other people's blogspots are well designed. me. i just don't bother. anyway this thing is not for the general public. if they come across then it's their problem. like i said this is my e-diary. in this modern world, almost everything starts with an e hyphen. e-mail, e-transfer, e this e that. the world is becoming a robot.  funny though, the government gives the reason that the decrease of duration of National Service is due high technology. and not public pressure. i say, whatever. no matter how wrong or how right, they have the last words.  i need something refreshing in my life. something to jumpstart myself. rejuvenate. i need a magic rejuvination potion. i wish i had magic like in the Land of Xanth. my dream place. a place of absolute wonderful imagination by Piers Anthony. where magic, not money, rules.  these are the things that bother me in life. losing. money. future. negativeness. redundancy.  simplicity is the best.

      do you know what's fair in life? nothing... how can a person with a lower education than poly or a levels serve only 2 years national service? while the more educated ones serve two and a half years? what kind of crap shit is that? the more educated should be the ones serving lesser because they are the ones who need to go out there and make the nation prosper. they are the future of singapore. the lesser educated can wait which means they can serve longer.  i'm sorry if this offended anyone. i'm just jealous that my friend who enlisted the same day as me have been released from service last thursday, June 10 2004. we could have been released together but noooooo.. i have to serve six more months because i got mighty rank of coporal which i'm totally not proud of!  got a great idea from bean today. he just rekindled my memory of claiming("squeezing") money from the SAF for my injury. yes. he got $7+k. cool huh? well now it's my turn. if i can't be happy serving 6 more months and be in a fucked up place, i might as well get lots of money for it. cross my fingers and hope for the best!

Allah shall protect all of us.   i'll try to find a PC over in Taiwan. then maybe i can email ppl from there. actually i'm not excited over this trip. everything is so rigid and controlled, from what you wear to airport to what you do during r&amp;r.   army... what else is new?

      hello blogspot. nice of me to drop by again. i'll be gone in 4 days. i really need this trip. bad or good, at least i can get away from the all the problems and redundancy i have in singapore. just a few minor things that i'm not confident of with this trip. first up, i'm afraid of flying. this will be my first time. hope it doesn't crash. second, the covers in taiwan. it's gonna be fucking hot out there in the jungle. man... how i'd hate for the trainees or permstaffs to get heat exhaustion or worse... heat stroke. well all you can do is pray. last thing of my concern is the r&r. more specifically, taiwan mafias. let's hope i won't get kidnapped or get shot in the head.   i want this year to end fast. i'm afraid of dying.i have this thought i won't last long enough to start&nbsp;the next year. that's why i'm afraid. if i tell this to anyone they will, for sure, say that i'm talking nonsense. so if the unfortunate does happen, i would like to tell that the person (which could only be farah gendut coz she's the only one who knows bout this blog, but i don't think she'll bother now) reading this that i have no hatred for nobody. i do not mean to hurt anyone in anyway whatsoever. all debts for me and by me, please let it be permissible by islamic laws. last but certainly not the least, please forgive me for all my sins and pray for me. thank you.   nowadays it's difficult for me to find a positive topic to talk about. o.r.ding soon is not positive enough. o.r.ding is just like p.o.p. u are happy on the day but u will live to regret the coming days, weeks, months, years of suffering.   i was asking myself when i was walking her home, why do i want to distance her away from me? i still love and care for her. there is no doubt bout that. i always feel the pressure to make her happy. it's difficult to give someone happiness when u are seldom happy yourself. i can't give someone a dollar if i only have fifty cents. then i think of this phrase, "emotionally burdened"   am i just giving excuses? or is it true.. emotionally burdened..  that's what i'm going through right now.

      this is to remind me that i've just watched one of the best blockbuster movies made in hollywood. nothing has left gasping for more. i was so amazed by the movie that i wished it had gone on forever. ladies and gentlemen, please, even if you're the poorest of the poor, steal some money and watch Spiderman2.

      ever since news of the deduction came out, my hatred towards national service is subsiding. even though the system is still an unfair one. picture this. your boss wants to know your every movement via sms. msg me when u go. msg me when u arrive. msg me this. msg me that. he would say. and if we don't? we are fucked! so here i am walking off to my friday prayers last week and smsing him at the same time. he replies and i quote, "till this day u haven't told me personally" i thought what the heck.. crazy bugger.. so i just off my hp intending to explain myself. guess what happen when i met him? i didn't have a chance to do explain. he fuck and fuck and fuck until my rectum is swollen! not even a chance to moan. goddamn superiors. thanks for telling the world that as long as you're not higher ranking or in appointment, you are a NOBODY... what a way to teach the young kids how to build character.. thanks ah!   why do i always torture myself? here i am sitting in front of this pc knowing that i can sleep and have a good rest. but i chose to stay up and godeh2 with my pc because i know i'm only at home for a few hours. so why waste it with sleep? but i will wake up late regretting not having slept earlier.                                     .i.d.i.o.t.
