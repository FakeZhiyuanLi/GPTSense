      The 3rd day of the holiday weekend and it continues to rain.  Thank goodness Jim mowed the lawn on Friday.  Anyway, I suppose it forces us to stay inside and continue packing for the move.  We keep filling boxes, but there is always more stuff to go in there.  Here is a cute picture of the cats helping us pack from earlier in the weekend.         We would like to attend  urlLink Brat Fest  today (the final day), however, the rain might just keep us at home all day.

      My favorite whois lookup:   urlLink Whois Source - Wildcard Domain Search Lookup   My favorite domain registrar:   urlLink GoDaddy.com: : Low cost domain names, domain transfers, web hosting, email accounts, and so much more.   Note: I could not use the Blog This button to put both links in the same message.  The second on was manually pasted in.  Tips anyone?

      On this holiday weekend we find ourselves continuing to pack for our upcoming move.  The purchase of our new house and sale of the current house went swiftly and now we just await the big day.  We find it difficult to stay motivated although since we don't keep a lot of crap in general and did a total cleaning of the house back in March, I don't anticipate many problems come moving day.   urlLink Kitty-Cam  will of course be a minor casualty of the move.  We anticipate a solid two weeks of down time.  After we are settled in, we would like to explore taking a  urlLink cruise  for our 10-year anniversary.  We have done this a couple times already, so it may be time to consider other travel adventures.  We'll see....

      On May 9, we ordered a small pub table with 2 matching chairs from  urlLink Ashley Furniture .  We specifically requested to pick up this item no earlier than June 16 due to our move.  Yesterday we received a phone call that our item was in.  I called, explained that we could not pick it up until June 16 and that seemed to be alright.  Today, we received another call from them telling us it was in.  Again, I called them and explained the situation.  This time they would not budge telling us we'd have to pay a storage fee if we didn't pick it up sooner.  I told them we'd be in tonight for it and expressed that I was very disappointed in their customer service saying that for just one week they could do this for us.  Also, this isn't a huge couch or anything, but a small table that is disassembled.  I also told them I would be telling my family and friends about this experience and how dissatisfied I am with them.  So, you have been told!
