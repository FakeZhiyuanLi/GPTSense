I took the 4-Wheeler down to Cherokee today.&nbsp; Took well over 100 pictures, even though I couldn't see the screen on the camera due to the glare of the sun, I still think some of them came out alright.&nbsp; I've been promising my Uncle Gary I would take some pictures of the place I hunt up here, so I finally did.&nbsp; Enjoy.

      Last night I was sitting on the back porch and saw a doe walk up over the hill and just stand there.  20 yards, tops.  It never happens like that during deer season.  It's like the damn things just prance around all over the place and then at exactly 12:01am on October 1st they decide to become elusive.  I had a shot at one deer last season, and the cap on my muzzleloader didn't blow.  The hunting Gods hate me.  Anyways, I decided since I can't shoot one right now, might as well get a few pictures, since, as we all know, I have a serious addiction to my new camera.  So Angela and I are sitting on the back porch for maybe 10 minutes when a doe and a fawn walk up over the hill.  I start snapping pictures like crazy until Angela scares them off.  Lucky for her, she has other good qualities to balance her lack of driving ability and a seemingly endless talent for disturbing anything I am trying to focus on.  Once the doe and fawn shag ass back into the woods there is another doe and fawn working their way over the hill.  I take some more pictures, look to my left, and see a small buck coming across the field.  He wasn't very big, but his antlers were still in velvet, so it looked kind of cool.  In total I took a little over 150 pictures of them.  Out of those 150, there are only about 10 that I like.  Damn my perfectionist streak.  Regardless, I posted my favorite shots for all to see.  Just click................... here:   urlLink Deer Pictures   Until then...

       urlLink Welcome to Gmail   I just spent $6.00 on an e-mail account.  I know, it sounds crazy.  There are all kinds of free e-mail services out there, and I have an account on most of them.  But dammit, this is gmail we're talking about!  For those not aware, gmail is Google's new e-mail service.  They give you 1Gig of storage and all kinda other goodness.  Sounds good, right?  Of course it does.  But, there is a catch.  Gmail is still in the Beta stage, so accounts are not available to the public.  Only a select few have an account and the only way to get an account is to have someone who already has an account to invite you.  I know, it's complicated.  Anyways, I've been wanting one for months just to say I have one, and now I do.  God save eBay.  My new account is:  urlLink rpemberton@gmail.com    So feel free to e-mail me and help me get my money's worth.  Until then...

      Alright, yesterday my wife, Angela, and I went for a drive around the lake.  I wanted to get some sunset shots off of Diamond Bluff and a few other places.  So, we decide to go into Tannenbaum first since it's the closest place.  Angela says there is a restaurant down there that has a deck I should be able to get some good pictures on.  This was mistake of the day #1.  First of all, there IS NO RESTAURANT.  At least, not anymore.  It seems that the place was bought and closed SEVERAL years ago.  Yay for my perceptive wife.  So, an hour and a half, a few wrong turns, and many near-death experiences later, we make it back to the highway.  From there we head to Diamond Bluff.  Now, I always assumed Diamond Bluff was some tourist spot with a place to park at the bluffs and take pictures or whatever.  ha.  No.  It's a damn "Restricted" subdivision.  I still got a few decent shots, but the highlight of the entire day was possibly scaring the shit out of some rich bastard that lives on top of the hill in the subdivision.  I won't go any further.  Without further ado, here are the pictures:  urlLink Greers Ferry Trip

      Well, I decided to finally do something with this website.  It hadn't been updated since shortly after the wedding.  So, from here on out, this will be my blog.  Blog = Weblog = Random stuff I decide to put on here.  Just in case you didn't know.  Anyway, the other day I got a new camera.  It is seriously bad ass.    Check it out:   urlLink Minolta DiMAGE Z1   In the past 3 days I have taken well over 400 pictures.  I think I have found my new hobby.  As soon as I can get the coding worked out I'll post some of the pictures on here.  Speaking of pictures, Jon and I went fishing yesterday.  We hadn't been fishing together in a long ass time.  We couldn't find any of our rods so we ended up going to Wal-Mart and buying a couple Zebco 202's.  Yes, we were desperate.  We get to Lake Ashbaugh, make a few casts, and I catch a fish.  This is an amazing feat for several reasons.  The main reason is the fact that the lake was just drained and killed off last year.  We were shocked there were already catchable fish in the lake.  We caught a few fish, took some pictures, Jon lost what can only be described as the Lake Ashbaugh Monster; snapped 10lb. test like it was nothing.  Oh, Jon caught a damn Dragonfly.  Don't ask me how, but it happened, I have the pictures to prove it.  Speaking of, I'll have the pictures of the trip up ASAP.  Until then, I'm gonna go steal one of Bill's smokes (cause Marlboro Ultra Light 100's are just ghey) and get some sleep.  Until then...

      Since there is a posibility Tommy and April might read this, I won't give out the results due to the fact that some serious bodily harm would most definitely come my way...  But let me just say this...  I hope the Pride refs die.  Now.  *throws stuff against the wall*

       urlLink Sherdog.com - Serving up Heaping Fistfuls of Mixed Martial Arts   I don't know why I haven't mentioned Sherdog on here sooner.  But, Sherdog.com is my favorite website of the moment.  If you are a fan of Mixed Martial Arts, or fighting in general, you need to check out this website.  The site has tons of information, interviews, pictures, video, etc.  Their forums are also top notch.  Several pro fighters post on there.  The most active ones being Bas Rutten, Quinton "Rampage" Jackson, Enson Inoue, Dexter Casey, and Lee Murray.  You can't beat that with a stick.

       urlLink PRIDE Final Conflict 2004 Card Finalized : "Tournament"  I am oh so excited.  My predictions:  Nog over Sergei, Fedor over Ogawa...... And I just can't call the final.  Let's look at it this way.  Nog will obviously have the tougher first fight.  I'm looking for Fedor to end Ogawa's existence in roughly 2 minutes, give or take.  Sergei is a very decent fighter and I think he will give Nog a hard fight if he can stay away from the "Top Team Special."  Unless Nog can finish Sergei quickly, regardless of his stamina, he is going to be somewhat gassed by the time the final match rolls around.  If I had to pick it.....  Nah, I can't do it.  It's too close.  As for the other matches:  Randleman over Waterman  Silva over Kondo  Aleksander over Mirko....  Yeah, I said it, WHAT!?!?!  If I'm wrong on any of my picks, I'll accept that.  We'll see on the 22nd.
