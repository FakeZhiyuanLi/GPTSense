       urlLink    urlLink       NBC Image Teammates Erik Vendt and Michael Phelps celebrate after going 1-2 in the 400m IM. ATHENS -- In his short but brilliant career,  urlLink Michael Phelps  had done just about everything imaginable in the pool prior to Saturday night. In the final of the men's 400m individual medley -- his first of what could be as many as eight events during the Games -- Phelps experienced something new. He earned the title of Olympic champion for the first time, winning the event in a time of 4 minutes, 8.26 seconds. In the process he broke his world record by .15 of a second and shattered Tom Dolan's Olympic mark, set four years ago in Sydney, by more than three seconds. The 19-year-old Phelps, who holds the world record in the 400m IM along with two other events, led the whole race and spent the final 350m below world-record pace. American  urlLink Erik Vendt  took the silver, chasing down Hungary's  urlLink Laszlo Cseh  in the final 50m to finish in 4:11.81. "I'm perfectly happy right now," Phelps said after stepping up to an Olympic podium for the first time. "I said I wanted one. I have my one now. Now I just have to stay focused and go out and swim my races." Phelps still wasn't ready to proclaim his goal in Athens to be seven gold medals. He did, however, admit that getting the first one out of the way should help down the road. "I'm a little bit less nervous," he said. "I've got one off my shoulders and can relax a little bit." He can't relax for long. Sunday he will swim in the 200m freestyle preliminaries and semifinal, setting up what could be an epic matchup on Monday night with Australia's  urlLink Ian Thorpe  and  urlLink Grant Hackett , plus Dutchman  urlLink Pieter van den Hoogenband . The three challengers have eight Olympic golds among them. "It's going to be a great race," said Phelps. "I've always wanted to race against Thorpe, before either one of us is done." In addition, Phelps will likely swim in the final of the men's 4x100m freestyle relay on Sunday evening, depending on how U.S. men's coach Eddie Reese wants to play it. While Reese told NBC he hasn't decided who will swim the relay final, it is unlikely that more than two U.S. swimmers competing in the morning will swim fast enough to beat out Phelps.  Men's 400m freestyle If Phelps is on the verge of becoming swimming's biggest star,  urlLink Ian Thorpe  showed Saturday he isn't eager to relinquish that unofficial title. Continuing his seven-year winning streak in the 400m freestyle, Thorpe edged countryman  urlLink Grant Hackett  by .26 of a second to defend his Olympic title from Sydney. The victory concluded a controversial odyssey for Thorpe in this event. He initially failed to qualify after falling from the blocks in the preliminaries of the Australian Trials, but received a reprieve when teammate  urlLink Craig Stevens  ceded his spot, allowing Thorpe to compete in Athens. The incident was admittedly tough on the Aussie sensation, and Thorpe grew teary after touching the wall. "Yes, I was emotional," he said. "I didn't realize how much this event meant to me. I am more excited now that it is off my shoulders." Klete Keller came in third.
