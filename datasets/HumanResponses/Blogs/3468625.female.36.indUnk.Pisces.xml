       29th May 2004  Easy day today it being Saturday. Got up late, had an appointment with the hairdresser to have my hair coloured...Came home had a late lunch....Went into town shopping....Bought a couple of DVDs then came home and watched Return of the King.  Its amazing how a new hair style can make you feel so much better. My hair feels great and there are no longer any annoying grays reminding me hold old I'm becoming staring at me each time I look in the mirror.  M&S Cou pizza for tea (6.5 points a REAL find) and a chocolate pudding with chocolate sauce for dessert (another Marks & Spencer find at only 3 points).  A bit lazy on the exercise front. I was going to go swimming but after I'd had my hair done it seemed a bit foolish to then go and dunk my hair in a load of chlorine.   Building up for a big day tomorrow...Loads of points in hand so that I can enjoy the BBQ etc.   I probably wont post tomorrow as will be out all day and staying over at friends for the night, but I will post an update on Monday.

       28th May 2004  Today is a bit of a challenge. Late last night I was advised that I would be taking over some project work from a Guy who is leaving today. That guy works in Leeds - and I needed to travel to Leeds today to get a hand-over. Why is that a challenge? Well because I am the sort of person who likes to get into a routine and once in a routine I need adequate notice to break out of it and for me a last minute notice is not enough. It makes me break into a sweat of how I will manage to maintain points - will I have to eat out....Will I have enough will power to overcome my inner daemons? I need time to mull things over in my mind and come up with the best solution.  I am not spontaneous - particularly when I am dieting - will I ever feel that I can go out and not worry about it and maintain a healthy weight? I don't know, but I certainly hope so.  Anyway following some careful thought yesterday evening, I have come prepared with my breakfast and lunch, which I can eat on the train (breakfast on the way there and a late lunch on the way home). When traveling its all too easy to grab quick snacks - even a sandwich bar is perilous for me as I find myself standing there trying to work out the lowest point option. Like I said this last minute stuff is tough for me.   20:30  OK I survived, having the food with me was great, although I did not have the salad I had lovingly prepared for my lunch, as I went to the staff canteen with the chap who was handing over to me....But I had salad (I didn't want to appear too geeky by opening up my lunch box). Even after my evening meal I have 4 points to do with as I will - so I may treat myself to something yummy whilst watching the last Episode of friends.  Another 'high' point is the amount of walking I managed to do (I managed to get lost finding the office in Leeds!). I carried a pedometer today and it registered over 16000 steps which is great - although my legs are rather tired now.  I can go to bed tonight satisfied that I have done my best with the day....If only every day could go this well - if I could bottle it I would.

       27th May 2004  I have set up this site to journal my dieting journey following the last 28lbs for me to get my goal weight. 18 months ago I weighed in at 266lbs (thats 19stone 4lbs in England). A trip to Mexico where I could bearly do up the seat-belt on the airplane and where I felt uncomfortable and frumpy in every item of clothing I owned was the final straw. On my return I joined Weight Watchers and have succesfully lost over 70lbs.  At my best (November 2003) I had lost 90lbs and I have been struggling ever since to get back to that weight and to make it to my goal. This year has seen a series of losses then a series of gains with my weight slowly but surely increasing. This has got to stop and I need to take myself in hand.  Today I weigh 172lbs (13stone 8) and have 29lbs to go to get to my ulimate goal of 143lbs(11stone 7lbs.) Thats a weight I haven't seen since I was 21.  On my dieting journey I have learned a lot about myself and how to lose weight. I know HOW to do it, but I am finding the actual DOING very hard indeed. However I am hoping that by keeping this blog I will focus more clearly on my aims and give me somewhere to share with others the sucesses and failures for my final mile.  Today is a good day so far. I have walked to the station and I am in control of my eating.   I am currently eating 18 points a day (my normal quota is 22points) as this weekend is going to be difficult due to it being a bank holiday weekend and I am trying to save some points up for a BBQ on Sunday.  My aims this week are to take each day as it comes, stick to my points (18 every day except for Sunday), drink 3-4 litres of water a day and to  exercise .  I commute to work via train, and therefore I walk to the station and back every day - a round trip of approximately 3miles, however I am trying to increase my level of activity in the evenings once I get home. Yesterday was a good day - I went for a run. I am working towards being able to complete 5K, and I know that this sort of exercise can only help me with my weight loss.  So what more can I say? I will post here every day (or as much as I can) to update how I am getting on, and share my ups and downs to goal.

      Glad to report that today things are getting better. The binging seems to have stopped and I am back with it counting points. Taking things steadily again. Hour by hour. The first few days are always the hardest no matter how much I want to do this.  It is interesting how quickly I can get back into the ‘zone’ once my mind has firmly made itself up that that is what it wants to do. I am not sure how these triggers work – yesterday morning I was still eating badly, even though for days I had been wanting to eat healthily. Then like a switch going off in my head I am ready to get on with it again. I wish I had the key to that switch…..  I must try, though to go for the slow but steady, healthy approach losing 1-2lbs per week. Its hard because I want to lose the pounds that I have put on quickly. I will just have to accept that this is not going to happen if I REALLY want to get to goal…and I do.

      I feel like a stuck record....Just when you thought I was getting it together.....  I don't like myself very much at the moment. I have lost the plot completely. So much for 2 weeks ago saying that it was a 'blip'.  I am still struggling to get control of my eating. I am at breaking point. I hate what I am doing to my body but I can't seem to stop.  All the feelings of self loathing that I used to feel about myself have re-surfaced. For example I buy a large chocolate bar, eat it in secret, then immediately regret it. Every evening I go to sleep thinking tomorrow will be a better day, but that tomorrow never comes. I seem to have no control over the urge that made me eat the chocolate bar in the first place.  I could even take some comfort if it was just a large chocolate bar, but normally its that plus a large bag of crisps (or  bag  s  of crisps) plus biscuits, plus sweets plus my normal food. All of it (apart from the normal food) is eaten across the day  so although I might feel sick and bloated, I never get to the point of being sick ( I couldn't do that anyway) and its always eaten in secret. That is, not openly, I don't believe that I am managing to hide this from the people sitting around me totally. My husband definitely does not know the extent of the problem.  In a few weeks time we are seeing some friends that we've not seen since Christmas when they were amazed at my weight loss. I sat there all smug saying that I still had 18 pounds to lose and that after Christmas I would get back to it. I haven't and I hate the fact that I haven't done what I said I'd do.  I feel like a failure again. (I know I should go & read some if my earlier journals to remind me of what to do, but I feel so down & they only serve to make me feel more of a failure at the moment)  Between now & then I could lose the few pounds that I've put on since Christmas, however we have a holiday in between so it will be hard going.  The good news is that this morning I called hubby and admitted what I have been up to, that I have been binging, that I have been eating in secret, that I am unhappy and that I am scared that this is the end. That I will just keep eating and get fat again. And all of this was in the corridor at work. There I was with tears streaming down my face (again) and trying not to look as though I'm crying. It would almost be funny if it wasn't so tragic.  Have I learnt nothing in the last 2 years?......Doesn't look like it at the moment, does it?.  Hopefully now I have opened up and admitted that I have lost control and look for support, it marks a change in my attitude. Its time to stop wallowing in my self- loathing and do something to make a change.   Hubby was very supportive. He finds my binges hard to comprehend - he only eats when hungry - but he is getting better at helping me in the early days after I've gone off the rails. Sometimes he'll nag me before I'm ready to admit there's a problem and that leads to arguments. It has to be me going to him. I have to admit to myself first that I can't deal with it alone.  Anyway, today, once he realised how bad things had become (he admitted that he knew I wasn't doing well cos I'd gone quiet on the whole subject of losing weight) we talked through how to get me back on track and losing weight. Which was a great relief.  One of my main problems is my lack of activity. I've got out of the habit of exercising again. I need to develop a routine of doing something once I get home from work. At the start of this year I started a new job which is over 60 miles away from my home town and I commute there on the train. I have to get up an hour earlier than I have for the past 10 years and I get home at least an hour later. It doesn't sound much but it has affected me more than I thought. I used to go to the gym or go out for a run on my way home, but I no longer pass my gym on the way home - its 20 minutes by car in the other direction! Its no excuse, but I just haven't managed to get into a routine of getting into the car and going to a class. All I have wanted to do is go to bed.  So as of today, hubby is going to help me to do more in the evenings and help with the eating. He also wants to lose a little weight (just some vanity pounds).Today we're going to go out for a walk round our local area, and once we get home I have to make my lunch for tomorrow - a Weight watchers pointed meal.   Tomorrow we will be going to the gym and then its pub quiz night. On Thursday we have a French lesson, but I may see if there's a class I can go to after that.  That's as far as I've got. I know that once I have managed to get started I'll be off.   I would also like to lose some weight on holiday this time - maybe we'll see. I will have to think of some strategies so that I can do that!   16:00   Its taken me most of the day to finish writing that much! Its now getting close to the end of the day and since my outburst this morning at about 11am I have stopped the binging. For my lunch I had a healthy tuna salad with a pear. I have chewed on some gum but nothing else!  I feel so much better already. I'm still not feeling 100%  - I need to keep going for a few days before I'll start to feel that, but it's a start.  I do not feel yet like going back to my support group or to the ww boards.... I'm always there moaning about how badly I'm doing. I need some private time to get it together again.  Wish me luck. I need it.

      I think I’m starting to get back on my feet.  I had a relatively good day yesterday – I didn’t stick to my points but I did manage to eat healthily without stuffing my face all day.  So a victory to me.  Today has been harder so far, although I am coping. I’m not looking for a big loss this week 1lb would do me.  That’s the sort of loss I should be looking for at this stage in my weight loss game rather than the leaps and bounds I have made of late.  I will keep on doing what I’m doing and see what difference it makes.

      So today is another ‘fresh start’. I weighed in this morning & I’ve put on 6lbs in 2 weeks so I am non too pleased. I’m not surprised, just angry with myself that I let my eating get out of control and frustrated that I still have binges.  When I set out on my weight loss journey, I managed months on end without having a binge. I was focussed on what I wanted and thought I had managed to stop the binging pattern. In the last 6 months all the old patterns have returned. The only thing that is better is that I do not allow them to go on for too long as I do not want to end up as fat as I was.  The thing is, I have relaxed. I feel so much better about myself and there is a part of my mind that doesn’t think that it’s necessary for me to diet any longer. I am hoping that I can hang on long enough to where I am now on the grounds that EVENTUALLY I will be able to find the strength and method to carry on. I am no longer in a life threatening place, I can sit comfortably on any airline, I no longer snore, I am healthier and fitter than I have been in years. Therefore is it necessary for me to continue on this journey and be a size 12 rather than a size 16. I am very aware that, for a lot of women this is where they would start out; with a couple of stones to lose. The difference is that I have been a lot heavier than this and my current weight is not an impediment. I have so much confidence that I would even wear a bikini. Anyone who has never been a size 20 (lets face it I was a size 26, squeezing into a size 24) and over will never understand how happy I am to be just a size 16. Plain and simple, I am happy to be in a ‘normal’ range of clothing.  That, in essence, is my problem. I am happy where I am. There is a large part of me that does not honestly believes that being a size smaller would make me feel any better or make that much of a change to my life. I know that I am still in the ‘slightly overweight ‘ range which means that I am still at higher risk from many diseases, but compared to my risk 2 years ago, I have come a long way.  However there is another part of my brain that thinks that I should keep going plod onto goal, I just need to find a way for me that works. Today has been relatively good so far – I have had breakfast (porridge), tomato soup for lunch with 2 bread rolls, a couple of rice crackers, a handful of dried fruit, a handful of plain mixed nuts, some cherries and a banana. I have no idea what that adds up to in points, but apart from the soup its all healthy food ( the soup was Heinz cream of tomato. Yum Yum).  There has been no sweets or chocolate (which after the last week is amazing) . I just need to keep this going this evening. I am hoping that approaching eating in this way – providing my body with different/whole foods will keep me on the straight and narrow.  So enough today. I could talk round this subject for hours. I will find a way of doing preventing the binges and slowly crawling towards my goal.

      I knew that this site was going to be about my ongoing 'struggle' to get to goal, and I'm certainly struggling at the moment. I'm still not back on track, I've lost the will to do this and I don't know why.  My head wants to do it, by my heart doesn't. Like I said yesterday, there is no way I want to get fat again, and I do want more of the losing weight stuff, but I just don't want to have to go about it the hard way any more. I'm not sure that I can face counting points and berating myself every time I go a little bit over. At the same time when I am following the points method I know that I will lose weight and make sensible decisions.  There needs to be a middle ground. I think that I would like to stop counting points and change what I am doing to making sensible choices and losing smaller amounts of weight. I know other people manage to do this. Even if I only lost 1lb a month that would be 6lbs lost sensibly by the end of this year.  I'm not sure how to approach this. At the moment I am a locust, ploughing my way through anything, munching my way though volumes of food that ought towildebeest wildebeast; I am binging ( And I don't even want to say what I am managing to put away, hiding it from others) and I need that to stop otherwise I will end up back where I started and WW gives me the control to manage it.  If only I wasn't a binger. WW is great for keeping me in control, and I thought that it had taught me not to act in self destructing ways, however the minute that I release that strict control I just head off again into bad habits. I guess that to get myself going again I need to start off with WW and get myself back in control and then perhaps I can look at ways of changing what I am doing and find a way to stop myself sabotaging my efforts again  I need to make the decision to pick myself up again and to not let this binging session win. That's all it will take me. Making the decision to stop and stop I will.  Tomorrow is WI day, I'm not sure if I will WI or not (the shock of seeing how much weight I have put on in my weeks binging may have the desired effect of shocking me back into it, then again it may not), but tonight I will get myself organised to bring my breakfast, lunch and any snacks I feel I may need to work. I will go to the gym tomorrow evening and try and get myself back with it. Organisation is one of my keys to success. My body is ready to get back on track..I just need to convince my mind and heart that it is too.  Ok, winge over. Only I can do this, only I can make it happen so I will get off my slightly enlarged backside (thanks to all this eating) and make it so.

      After a busy weekend, I’m back. I have struggled a little this morning to keep my eating under control, but so far so good-  Trying to keep at the forefront of my mind that I will be going on holiday in 3 weeks time but I am back to taking it one day at a time and seeing how we go.  Anyway, back to the weekend. I went to the ball held annually by my previous company (I managed to scrounge a ticket from one of my old friends there). It’s a big night out and we get to dress up in posh frocks and look all together gorgeous. I wore the dress that I had from last year which I love. It’s a halter-neck with an a-symmetrical hem-line. Its slightly big on me now (even given the fact that I’ve only lost about 4lbs in the last year) and hangs on me really well so I feel great in it. Its times like this when I LOVE the fact that I’ve lost weight – I remember a few years ago when my husband persuaded me at the last minute that we should go (I had been trying to put it off because I was fat) and I felt horrible in my dress which was about 2 sizes too small over which I had put on a jacket to cover up the fact that it was too tight and so I was too hot as well. I felt fat and ugly and wanted to hide in the corner. Now it is different. I want people to see me  - OK I’m not model skinny, but I am a decent size for my height (I’m a UK size 16 (US size12) and 5foot 10 inches). I love it when someone I haven’t seen in a while praises me on my weight loss.  The company is a large multi-national & is one of the biggest in the UK and it knows how to throw a party in style. This year over ten thousand people attended the event (yes you did read that correctly) which was held in a giant marquee at Blenheim Palace near Oxford. To cap off the event we were delighted with a mini concert consisting of Madness, Sheryl Crowe, Blue and Sir Elton John. Fantastic! On top of that there is a disco, a funfair, karaoke, free food and a subsidised bar – safe to say everyone drinks far too much.  Thanks to my old company for that and to my friend for taking me. I tell you what, its times like that which remind me how great that company was to work for.   I am now trying to climb back on the wagon after 5 days eating crap. I figure today my target is not to drink any alcohol and to try and stick only to eating my meals e.g. no snacking. If I can manage that for a couple of days then I will start managing my points again. My body wants me to stop eating these self harming foods now so it should become a relatively easy exercise. Also I want more of the good stuff about losing weight. The freedom it brings due to improved self confidence which allows me to go out and hold my head high, is better than any drug. It’s a feeling that I don’t think I will ever take for granted.

      come back another day....  I have not posted for a couple of days, thats because I have not being doing as well as I hoped.  I thought I had the demon attack under control, but then they rallied (their holiday has given them new strengths) so unfortunately I'm still trying to cope with them, although I may have my incentive for getting them to push off.   MY MOTHER IS COMING ON HOLIDAY WITH US  .....shreeks and runs away pulling hair out  Actually both my parents are coming on holiday with us, but its my mum that I have the problem with. Things have been a lot better between us since I have lost weight, but she is the only person who can make me feel about 5 again and treat me as such. I put it down to her having been a primary school teacher for too many years.   Don't get me wrong, I love both of my parents to bits, its just that when I was overweight my relationship with my mother deteriortated as she couldn't understand how I had become so overweight & why I didn't do something about it. Its was just down to will power wasn't it? Anyway she used to worry about my health and I can understand why but it was a subject that became very taboo between us as her comments were not helpful - telling me that I was going to get diabetes and have a heart attack may have been her way of shocking me into doing something but it actually had the reverse effect. I had to want to make the change myself and what I actually needed was some unconditional love.  Gosh that was hard to admit - the need for unconditional love- I am a sensitive person and can boo at the drop of a hat, poking a stick at me and making me feel worse about a situation I was trying to ignore made me want to retreat further inside myself. Luckily one day something changed inside me & I changed with it.  That aside,I know we will have a great time with my parents on holiday. We have been away with them many times before to France and there is a comfortable routine that we get into, mainly revolving around shopping eating relaxing and trying to drink the French wine lake dry.....so I will need to get a few pounds in hand before we go so that I can relax and enjoy.  That means that the demons really will have to go. I have a big event tomorrow - my old work's ball, so I will cut back as best I can before that, and then on Sunday I will be back with a vengnece.

      Today is not going well. My inner demons returned from what-ever extended break they have been on, leaving me to revel in the delights of getting thinner, and then wham they’re back!   This morning I woke up did my usual ablutions which always includes a quick weigh in to make sure that things are going OK. Today was not good, the scales were 3lbs up sticking at 13 stone which is my weight of last week. (On Saturday morning they were showing a lovely 12 stone 11lbs)…Where has that come from. OK I went over my points on Sunday, but not badly and every other day I have been fine.   It was then that the demons burst into the bathroom screeching around my head like a herd of Banchees. Prodding and poking at my self worth and confidence.   ‘HA HA'  they cried, 'All this dieting is useless, you’ve done your best all week and you’ve not managed to lose any this week! You may as well give up now. You’re not going to lose this week so why bother sticking with it today.’   OK so it wasn’t my official WI day. I have to admit I am a  scale whore . A not very nice term (which I have picked up from other blogs ) which completely describes my addiction to seeing my weight loss on those damned scales and allowing my mood and actions to be dictated by them. However I’m not going to lose 3lbs magically over-night am I?  So the demons have won today…they have send me off on an eating spree. I’m not proud of this, but I was hungry for high point food – biscuits, crisps, chocolate – you know the food groups. I have already consumed 2 of those lovely moist, crumbly large chocolate chip cookies that you can get from supermarkets.   I’m not proud of this fact, but I’m also quite accepting this for what it is. I do not think that this is me going out of control for days on end. I just needed to eat crap for a while. If that means that tomorrow shows no weight loss so be it. I have lost 9lbs in 2 weeks, and I have been counting points and being a born again weight watcher (=weight watchers bore) for the last 3 weeks so it had to catch up with me eventually.  BUT, I promise that tonight those demons will be sent on a one way ticket to somewhere where it will take them at least 2 weeks to find their way back.  The furthest reaches of Siberia appeal at the moment or Antartica. With any luck they’ll freeze to death! I’m not so foolish to believe that they’ll be gone forever – they have the homing instincts of your most intelligent pigeon (lol) – but I do find that mentally sending them far away helps for a time.  The urges to eat are already subsiding the writing of this has helped along with the injection of some saturated fats and sugars courtesy of biscuits and crisps. Tomorrow   will   be a better day!

      What a fantastic weekend -  weatherwise that is. Glorious sunshire all day yesterday and a chance just to sit and enjoy our garden which we've spent so much time lovingly tending.  We are lucky in that although we only have a regular sized garden. we are not far from the countryside and therefore we do get a lot of wildlife and it was wonderful to watch the birds flying in and out and splashing aound in our bird bath.   On the eating front I did OK. Friday and Saturday I was way under points, however yesterday I managed to go over for the first time in ages thanks to 3 glasses of wine, a couple of mini chocolate bars and a 'meeting of minds' with the peanut butter and bread late in the afternoon.   Still I don't think I will have done too much damage to the weight loss, despite the scales showing a 2lb gain this morning. I know this is a temporary glitch and it will come off again by Wednesday (official weigh in day). Back on the water again this morning in a hope to flush some of those toxins out!  Back to work to day, and I know you know how much I loath that! The saving grace is that its only 4 weeks till I go on holiday again (yipee!)so i guess I can plod on for a few more weeks. It would be great to go away and my clothes to be all too loose. In four weeks I could loose  8lbs, which would bring me back down to my lowest all time weight!  I mustn't count my chickens before they're hatched should I?

      You may remember in an earlier post I mentioned that hubby and I were hoping in the near future to start a new life in France. We love France, we love the lifesyle the amount of space, the wine (need I say more)...But there is one BIG problem...The language!  Both of us did French at school although I failed my 'O' level and hubby didn't take to exam level. At the end of my time at school I hated languages. I had enough trouble with English and ensuring that my grammar was correct (As you may have noticed). I  never  thought I'd end up wanting to live in France.  However, after university I went on holiday with my parents to France and loved every minute. Since then we have been back at least every other year and since we made our decision that we would like to live there we have been back 3 times in the last year.  Now you would think that in that time our French would improve, well it has but still not enough that I can confidently hold a conversation with a French National. I can usually plan what I am going to say for the first 2 sentences and then after that their response throws me and we get lost and the conversation dries up.   So the answer to this problem is to get help and we have now found a French teacher who will tutor us for an hour a week at our home. She came for the first time last night and although we didn't do much this week - it was about meeting her and getting to know her, it was a start. I am very excited about learning the language properly and being able to go on holiday next time and hopefully being able to hold a conversation  Why is she going on about this when the purpose of this blog is dieting? I hear you ask.   The point is this. When there is something that we are not able to do we ask for help. Learning new academic subjects on your own is not easy. It takes a very special person to be able to work autonomously (ooh look at me using bit words!). The same goes for weight loss, when we need help we should ask for it. Joining a weight loss group or an on line community, where people share their experiences and offer strategies and methods for helping with losing the weight is a great way of getting taught at very little expense.  In my blog reading of the last few weeks there are people sharing their experiences of maintaining as well. Maintaining terrifies me - weight loss is easy in comparison, however I look forward to a new journey of learning and discovery once I get there.    A few weeks ago, my diet world had fallen apart, I had lost the will to lose weight, I wanted to be able to eat as I used to...Well part of me did. The other part hated the person I was becoming again. Thankfully my self loathing won and I went crawling back to my support group and asked for help. They reminded me of what I was doing, why I was doing it and how far I had come.  They reminded me to take little steps and to set short term goals. They acted as a teacher for me. They helped me to get back to where I am now; comfortably managing my every day life losing weight and enjoying it too!  Just proves that even after 18 months everyone can learn something. I am by no means an expert - If I was I'd be making millions teaching others. But we can all act as mentors and teachers helping each other to learn the skills and tools we need to take us to our goals.   Whilst we're on the subject of learning, I went to a motivational course which was set up by work a few years ago. They talked about learning as a child and how if we tried something and it went wrong we didn't care, we just tried again and if that didn't succeed we tried another way, or sometimes we walked away, and came back to it another day and miraculously it worked. Do you remember those times? I do. We hadn't been told that not being able to do something for the first/second/third or however many times it was, was failure. It was learning.  If we adopt this attitude with weight loss then we will succeed. Do not take a fall from losing weight as failure. Examine what happened, decided what if anything you can do to change what went wrong. If necessary ask for help and then start again it is not failure it is learning!   Happy learning.

      Glad to confirm that I have lost another 4lbs this week. That brings me down to 182lbs (13stone). I am really pleased with this. When I focus on losing weight I can realy shift the pounds. The problem is that sometimes there are other things that I want to focus on such as having a good time. I was reading another Blog  urlLink the adventures of diet girl   ( A really funny read if you have the time) and she was saying how in the early days dieting is easy, but once you've lost a few pounds, you start to get a social life which means more eating and drinking and therefore losing weight gets harder and harder.  I certainly recognise this sort of pattern. Hubby and I certainly go out more now - not necessarily to the pub, but simple things like meeting up on a Friday after work and going to the cinema. In my fat days I hated the thought of even going to the cinema because that would mean that I'd have to find something to wear, and then thinking the whole time that people were staring at me because of my size. Of course I would never have admitted that at the time - I made excuses like, I'm tired, or I don't fancy it tonight (HA HA that sounds like my sex life at the time too)  The thing about being overweight its that its a viscous circle - the fatter you are the less you want to do things, therefore sitting at home not burning calories (and probably eating more - I'm not judging anyone, just explaining what I did). Once you have lost a few pounds and get confidence back (even being able to fit comfortably into your current set of clothes  - however big they are - can make a VAST improvement to confidence)then all you want to do is get out there and do things.  So the answer is to anyone who may yet be struggling to break the sitting at home cycle is to try and get out once this week - go for a walk, or drive to the cinema, allow yourself a small popcorn and a large diet coke, and get out there and start enjoying. you'll soon find the more you do the more you want to do!

      Not much to relate today. It has been a lovely weekend with just the right amount of activity and sitting around relaxing.  I'm very proud of how my diet is going  - I have stuck with my points all weekend which is excellent and I know I am going to loose weight this week.  This week should be interesting, as I am going to be much busier at work and normally this pushes me off the rails, but we'll see how I go.

      Survived the meal out with colleagues - had quite a good time actually - lots of laughing. I still can't get over how differently people treat me now that I'm slimmer. There's far more eye contact and people seem comfortable having a laugh with me. In my larger days, it was all people could do to keep me in the conversation, let alone make eye contact.   In the evening we went to see Harry Potter  Prisoner of Azkaban . I was a good film. I wouldn't say I was enthralled, but it was enjoyable. Had a small popcorn which I shared with Roy and a diet coke rather than a larger box as normal.  Today I have been to the gym, which was really tough - I couldn't cope with the running at all. I felt exhaused after 10mins so no 5K today!, however I still did 30mins aerobic, followed by some weights and then went swimming and did 10 lengths and folowed that up with a sauna, so at least I have done something.  I've not been got at by my deamons for a couple of days which is a bit suspect - they must be on holiday or something....ha ha.

       3rd June 2004   Went to the gum last night as planned. Was feeling good. Didn't have loads of energy at the end of a long day, but my body felt ready to move. Anyway, my NSV (Non Scale Victory) is that I managed to run 5K! That's the furthest I've EVER managed in one go. I feel so elated. It is not so long ago that I could not run for more than a minute.. In fact it was only this time last year that I managed to run for more than one min at a time.  I'm still taking the running thing slowly. I don't run fast and I am still building up my stamina. I probably will not be able to replicate the 5K run for a few days (whilst my legs recover)but I now know that my body is capable of such a feat.  On the eating front I didn't do so well yesterday, but not for the normal reasons. I actually didn't eat enough. My total came to around 15 points yesterday and given that I should have been eating 22, I'm a bit mad at myself. Add to that the bonus points that I got from the running, I'm probably well under what I should eat to remain healthy.  The knock on from this is that today I am ravenous. I am trying to maintain a cool calm exterior, but inside there are all sorts of battles going on fighting the inner demons. I know I have spare points, but I don't want to loose control. It could be a BIG slippery slope if I allow my demons off the leash for any length of time. I am also very aware that I have the meal to face tomorrow lunchtime, so a few points in hand will always come in useful. My attempts to obtain a copy of the menu have been thwarted somewhat as the fax machine is currently out of toner. (Oh come on this is the 21 Century). I suppose I could find another machine and get them to refax...If I don't have the fax by tomorrow morning then I'll try again.  Anyway its time for lunch now. Off to go for a walk to stretch the old legs - they're rather tired after yesterday, but it is a nice tired, not an ache, but a feeling of being used. I can feel the muscles working which is good.

       2nd June 2004   Today is the dreaded Weigh In - although as I have worked hard this week,, I was actually looking forward to stepping on the scales and I was well rewarded -  a 5lb loss ! That was a welcome sight I can tell you. I am back to having lost exactly 6 stone! (84lbs).  I am feeling very strong and positive about weight loss again. its just a case of getting back into the habit. Apart from a small challenge on Friday ( a work lunch/party), there is no reason why I should not manage to have a good loss again this week.   I am returning to 22 points for this week although, depending upon how Friday goes I may need to cut back a little next week to make up for it.  As I have had plenty of warning about the lunch on Friday, I have managed to come up with a strategy for coping - I'm going to ring them today and ask them to fax over a copy of their menu (or get the organiser of the meal to send it to me). I will then be able to work out the healthiest option so that I do not look like a complete freak once I get there.   Have already decided not to drink alcohol - will use the excuse that I have to drive later and will stick to diet coke and water. With any luck that should be anough to keep me within points.  A busy night tonight as once I get home its off to the gym for a work-out and then out to a quiz night at the local pub. Not sure when we'll fit food in, but I'm sure I'll manage!

      God it is so hard going back to work even after a long weekend. I always feel grumpy at the thought that once again I'm heading into the office where I will fester for 8 hours until such time as I come home, not seeing much daylight, breathing in other peoples germs through the air con, and staring at a screen all day. Well there is always the lunch hour, but as I work in Slough, you can imaginge that its nothing to get excited about.  So why don't I do something to change my life? Well hubby and I are trying. We would love to move to France where the pace of life is that much slower and run our own business (renting holiday homes).   The problem is that we can not yet afford the size of property that we would need to run a gite business and it is important that we have a property where we would be able to earn enough from rental to enable us to live. Lets face it we are still young and therefore we will need to support ourselves for a number of years (hopefully).  Still we have something to aim for and that makes the going to work worth it.  It was a tricky day today...had an attack of the inner demon who wanted me to go off on an eating spreee, but wasn't going to give him the pleaseure after doing so well all week.  WI tomorrow. I am looking forward to seeing how I've done this week, particularly as I've tried so hard.

       31st May 2004  Had a great day yesterday. Before the BBQ we went to Winchester farmers market which is held every month. It was excellent - wonderful fresh food, direct from the producers. Rcommended for a day out, a good place to get fresh organic food at prices comparable to the supermarket but cutting out the middle-man which means that the profit goes to the well deserving farmer. Found some excellent fudge which I ate far too much of - I have frozen what was left so that its out of sight!  At the BBQ,  I do not think I did as much damage as I could have done, thanks to a bout of gallstone pain in the middle of the afternoon. It lasted for about 2 hours and put paid to my eating and drinking for a significant amoutn of time, although, once over I did feel like I could join in again with the drinking if not the eating!  I have suffered with Gallstones for about a year now (my first attack was this time last year) and I am witing for an appointment to get them removed. I have been waiting for 6 months and have recently gone back to the botom of the queue due to my appointment arriving whilst I was on holiday - Apparenlty I should have infomed them that I was going to be on Holiday!?! As most of time I am on a low fat diet and watch what I eat its not too much of a problem. Then I go to an event such as a BBQ and remember the pain!  Still it was a good reminder to get back on the diet this morning - and I have. not managed to do any  formal exercise for a few days but I am pleased with the way I am eating and my 'general activity' level is high. I know that doing more exercise will help, however at the moment where every day sticking to my points is a bonus I do not want to push it too much.   So in all a good weekend for a bank holiday weekend. I am very proud of the fact that I managed the situation rather than let it overcome me and throw me off the rails. I have another challenge on Friday - a work lunch on Friday. Will have to see how I can manage that too.

      I’m having a shit day at work today. I have a project/task which I really do not enjoy & it’s reared its ugly head today. Had a brief chat with the ‘project manager’ this morning and he appears to be quite definite what it is I’m supposed to be doing, but I’m not sure if&nbsp; I understand what that is. If you see what I mean. When he’s talking it all seems very easy, then once I’m on my own I haven’t got a clue where to start! Anyway the whole thing is getting me down. Its not the best use of my skills&nbsp; - I have asked my resource manager to re-assign me, but I’m still waiting to hear the outcome of that. Anyway, I only have 8 more weeks of this misery left, so I suppose I should be grateful.   However the good news is that I haven’t allowed this to affect my eating, I’m still plodding along nicely and not getting too wrapped up in my points.   Went to the gym last night and then had a good pub meal after – scampi and chips again. I’m hoping that by keeping having these occasional higher pointed meals I’ll keep my body fuelled. I think looking back I have been guilty of putting my body into starvation mode hence my problems. I just so want to lose this last stone and a half. Bizzarly I feel fat –I have a big ring of fat around my tummy which needs to go! I just must ensure that I do it slowly!   Anyway, I’m rambling so I’m off.

       I am gob-smacked. This week the scales are showing a 3lb loss compared to the last time I weighed in – that’s after a 2 week holiday! Safe to say I am very, very pleased with this.  I am continuing to eat healthily, although today I became aware that I must try and eat more than I was eating on holiday. That holiday has taught me that I can eat well, feel satisfied and still lose weight.  I am going to continue to lay off the alcohol for a while. Up to next weekend at least when we have friends coming over for the weekend and I have no doubt that the alcohol will be flowing!  Been doing some investigating into our (short term) move to France. It appears that its not worth us trying to let our house whilst we’re away which is a shame as it would have covered our mortgage payments but unless we can do a private let its not looking likely.  So the start of another week wwing. I’m glad that I now have a finite time to lose as much weight as possible&nbsp; - I could be up to a stone lighter than I am now by the time we go which would be fantastic. I just need to keep my eyes firmly on the future.

      So I’m back from holiday and its time to update this blog of mine again. Why is it when you’re looking forward to a holiday the time seems to go so slowly, but once you’re back its seems to have gone so fast? Anyway this time I really did not want to come back. Why? Because we have finally found a property in France to buy. I can &nbsp;already feel the start of a new life to beginning to open out for us.   I have dreamt of living in France since I went on holiday with my parents after graduating from Uni. I didn’t have anywhere to go with friends – couldn’t afford it anyway, so my parents said I could go with them (they paid, bless them) for 2 weeks in a little cottage in Normandy France. We had the BEST time. It was a period in my life when I was slim – very slim, I was also young, and had no stresses from exams etc. OK it was hardly the sort of holiday a ‘normal’ 21 year old enjoys, being no-where near a bar let alone a night club, but I really enjoyed just hanging out with my parents as an adult, sitting in the sun reading books and making friends with the local wildlife (including the mice in my room).   Since then we have been back to France on numerous occasions and I just love their way of life. France is not so hot that everything is Manana as it might be in Spain or Mexico, but they are so much more relaxed. Life is not so fast paced.(I do not include Paris or France’s other big cities in this vast generalisation, I am talkling about rural France) Its like stepping back in time 30-50 years. People live in small communities where they care about each other. Madame goes out and sweeps her front step every day, The old men sit in the Tabac and put the world to rights. They still eat Baguettes!  Their markets (and supermarkets) are full of fresh locally produced foods. I never eat as well as when I am in France. The rural areas are poor though, and many of the younger people rush off for the bright lights of the city – who can balme them. If I had been bought up in a small rural community where the highlight of the week is an English car driving through the village I would have done the same.   Anyway, back to our house. It is perfect. It is in the Haut Garonne department, right in the middle of the Pyrenees. The house nestles in the mountains (If I can ever work out how to do it I may even add a picture!.)&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;  I wonder if that’ll work?&nbsp; No obviously not!   Anyhow, we have a plan to take 3months off work to go and renovate it and then next year return to work and save up more money so that we can eventually move out there to live!   I am one excited little bunny.   Oh yes on the food front. Things are going well. Holiday food was basic but tastly on the whole. Loads of salad and french bread. That type of thing, however I did drink one hell of a lot! - a sneeky peek at the scales this morning was showing a loss, but hwo knows what will happen on Wednesday I shall wait and see and I promise I wont allow the scales to depress me again!.   &nbsp;

      I didn't get to post yesterday as I was very busy at work and then had a nightmare journey at home of which the less said the better (safe to say it had to do with trains, unusual weather conditions for the time of year and the inability of the british tranport system to cope with a little rain).   However, thanks to hubby, I got home safe and sound at around 7:30, but was out again at 8 for the pub quiz....so as you can see pretty hectic.  That aside, yesterday was a good day. I have put the past firmly beind me and I lost 2lbs compared to my WI 2 weeks ago which I'm really pleased with.  Off on holiday this evening so this is likely to be my last post for 2 weeks as we are going to a remote part of France, where we'll be lucky to get a phone connection let alone internet!  I promise I'll try and be sensible whilst I'm away - I've packed my running gear and hope there'll be plently of walking to do.   See you in 2 weeks!

      I told you I’d ache. Every single muscle in my body is screaming to a greater or lesser degree. I’m so glad I went.  Body Balance is basically a cross of 3 disciplines: Tai Chi, Yoga and Pilates and is working on core muscle strength and flexibility. Although I managed most of the standing and ‘hip opening postures’, the ones involving stomach strength and back strength were really really hard – safe to say I have no stomach muscles currently.  The best bit, however was the last 10 minutes when the lights are switched off and we just get to lie on the floor and relax – now that I can do.  I really believe that this class is going to do me some good. I just need to make sure that I go back to it once I return from holiday. I can’t wait!   On the food front things are going OK. I had an NSV yesterday as I allowed myself a small amount of ‘real’ chocolate after getting back from the class without feeling guilty and the other part of this NSV is that I stopped after my allowed amount – no over-eating or binging again :-). Although I am pointing again, I am not getting too stressed about it. For instance last Wednesday after the gym we went to the pub for a meal and I had Scampi and chips - not normal ww food, but I figured that as I had been good all day, and I had been to the gym I could cope with it. Its all about balance!  I now have the uncertainly of the holiday to deal with, although I refuse to get too stressed about it.  When we are in France we tend to eat much as we do at home – the only increase will be in the volume of alcohol (when in France…..etc). So what if I put on a few pounds (I’d probably put them on if I was at home anyway). My main aim is to come back from this vacation feeling fully revived and raring to go.  Only 2 more days of work. Hurrah! Looking forward to getting out of here!

      Better! I have finally forgiven myself for my failings and I am glad to report that the eating has settled down again and I am no longer feeling the need to binge. Until today I have not been ‘pointing’ as I wanted to allow my eating to subside to a normal pattern which it appears to have done.  I hopped onto the scales on Saturday morning (very un-official WI) and was delighted to see that the scales were reading 12 stone 5, and although yesterday was quite high in points I hold out great hopes for my WI this week, that it will at least have stabilised.  I know that some of this is down to my lovely hubby who has been creating me lovely low fat meals (from the ww cook book). They have been absolutely delish! For instance last week he fed me sweet and sour chicken on noodles (the left overs I had for lunch the next day), Butternut squash and Boursin risotto, and on Friday, Pan seared Salmon on a bed of sun dried tomato couscous with a green salad. The best thing about these meals was that they were really filling and I could almost feel them doing me good as they contained lots of lovely nutrients.  I have also been bringing lunch to work with me – a bowl full of homemade, chunky Minestrone soup (made by my own fair hands) is very very filling. That, with some fruit this afternoon, is getting me through the day with no hiccups (so far)  Anyway to compliment this ‘new and improved’ me, I am going to get myself to a class this evening. I was talking with a friend today (and I know she’s a friend as she’s not shy of giving me a kick when required!) and I was saying that when I get back from holiday I was going to get into the routine of going to a class on a Monday evening – her response was ‘why don’t you go tonight, get an introduction then you can have 2 weeks off to recover!’ and after my usual prevaricating, I have agreed that she’s right and that I should make the effort this evening…so Body Balance it is! I have a feeling that I will ache tomorrow.

      Two quotes that I have picked up for other blogs today say it all for me:   Have Patience with all things, but chiefly have patience with yourself. Do not lose courage in considering your own imperfections but instantly set about remedying them - every day begin the task anew.        St. Francis de Sales .  and    Many of life's failures are people who did not realise how close they were to success when they gave up.      Thomas Edison .

      For some reason the blog i posted yesterday is refusing to load.  So I will try again this morning.  My weigh-in this week went well - another 2lbs lost bringing me back to under 13 stone (181lbs) which makes me feel great. I don't hold out much hope for losing this week though as we have friends staying for a long weekend and other friends coming over for a party on Saturday so I will find it difficult to keep track. My bit aim for this week is maintaining my weight. For me that will probably mean cutting back big time next week - what ever works eh?  Have been eating very late at night this week for a number of different reasons, but didn't sit down to eat last night until about 10pm and awoke this morning feeling ravenously hungry so have secumbed somewhat to the demons already. They needed sugar and I have supplied that a plenty this morning in the form of fig rolls and toffees (!). I need to keep an eye on them to ensure that they don't take over again and ruin all my efforts again - but with only 7 more weeks to go I don't think that is going to happen.  Not much else to report at the moment. I have sorted out my work problem to a point (and told the guy I will be leaving at the end of September) so I feel much happier.  Looking forward to a lovely hot weekend in the sun. Going to try everything in my power to avoid a hangover and eat sensibly.

      Oooops I forgot to post here yesterday! Don’t know why, I guess I was just busy.  Anyhow the good News is that I have lost another 2lbs this week, bringing my weight to 12 stone 13lbs. (181lbs) The first time I have been under 13 stone in quite a while – since March/April time I think. However this time I’m there in a more controlled fashion and with a clear goal in sight.  I have another 7 weigh ins before we move to France and this is like the all time longest time I have EVER had off from school or work. I just hope that the time doesn’t go too fast!  Do you think I could lose a stone before then? I’m certainly going to try, and if not, well what the hell!

      I was listening to my Mp3 player at work today and realised I was listening to 'Stronger'  by the Sugababes. I love the words in this song - especially those in the second verse:   Sometimes I feel so down and out Like emotion thats been captured in a maze I had my ups and downs Trials and tribulations I overcome it day by day Feeling good and almost powerful A new me thats what I'm looking for   Its so appropriate - I have been down and out so many times with this diet, but each time I come back stronger. Each time I go down I hope it will be the last but who knows, but being in control does make me feel powerful.  Weigh in tomorrow; I'm looking forward to it, because I know I have been in control - I have eaten my points (well nearly all of them) and drunk my water and exercised. I feel excited that for the second week running my weight will show a loss.  Other news worthy information; I have reached my  2 year anniversary  of losing weight with ww and getting healthy. I am very proud that I have kept going like this.  OK its not been easy and I have put on a little, but I have not put all the weight back on like I would have done in the past. I am managing my weight and I still have my eye on getting to goal (one day I'll get there).
