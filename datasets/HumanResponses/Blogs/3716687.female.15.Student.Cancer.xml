        *Sighs*   I don't even know where to start on this wonderful week.  But I can sum it up in this.  I've gotten closer to two of my old friends, and spent most of the week with them.  I've found a church that I feel like I will spiritually grow at, and is exactly what I am looking for in a church, and youth group.  I saw Mike yesterday and it was great seeing him again, ripped converses and all :).  So many more things, that I don't have the time nor energy to write.  But more shall come soon children.  -Allison

      I got a letter today from Mike.  Ha....he sent it Sunday a few hours after he got to triple r. I can always count on him to surprise me one way or another.  I went to the doctor yesterday and they said that everything with my foot is fine. It's healing the right way and I am now allowed to go out and walk....and go to the beach!  Speaking of the beach...Nicole is coming at 3 to take me there. She's gonna teach me how to surf tonight....at least try to, then back to her place, and then we're gonna cruise the strip...or just drive around because we've got no where better to be.  I bought the A Perfect Circle cd last week, it's awesome. Between listening to that, Copeland and the Beatles, I've made it through that past week.  Until I learn to surf and recieve more sweet letters,  I'm out.

         I have a doctors appointment for my foot in several minutes.  If my idiotic, imbusilic brother could just grab the freaking concept of picking up his godforsaken toys I wouldn't have been stuck inside this house all week.  Things have been extremely hard for me lately. My grandmother was diagnosed with malignant liver cancer, being stuck inside the house, Laura moving, waiting for Caitlin to come home, Mike being away for so long, and the kids at vacation bible school...I really need some extra patience.  Nicole and I are going surfing tomorrow after vacation bible school, then maybe paying a certain someone a visit where they're working for the next few weeks...We'll just see how things go.  I'm out.  Love you guys, as much as it may seem like I don't.

        &nbsp;  So it's been a while.     &nbsp;  Where to start, I honestly don't know. So I'll go on as I see fit.    &nbsp;  Several weeks ago we found out my grandmother was diagnosed with malignant melenoma in her liver. How she could have skin cancer in her liver, I don't know. But, she starts treatments for it today, and on Friday my mother, siblings and I will go down there to take care of her for about a week and some odd days.     &nbsp;  Back about 3 weeks ago my mother had a physical, and the doctor's are concerned that she may have colon cancer. So she will be having&nbsp; a colonoscopy done right after we come back from North Carolina.     &nbsp;  My birthday was last week, and so was missions. The morning we left for the trip, we pull into the Calvin parking lot, and I see a van that looked familiar, but not familiar from the church, I figured that it was some poor homeless family sleeping in their car, since we have several who do so in the parking lot.    &nbsp;  We pull up to the front of the church and the van follows us around. All of a sudden I hear my brother and sister scream LOOK! IT'S MICHAEL!    &nbsp;  Needless to say, he was there to surprise me for my birthday with a rose and my gift. I just couldn't believe it. But then again, I can almost never believe anything he does. What a wonderful guy.    &nbsp;  On missions we worked for a man named Mr. Burns. He was a retired baptist minister who had fallen deeply into poverty, and we were there to repair his house. Honestly, it would have been better to burn the house down and start from scratch. But, we couldn't afford to do that. We worked until thursday, and came home on Friday.     &nbsp;  Saturday I went out to breakfast with my family, went to Barnes and Nobles where I bought the Lovely Bones (my favorite book) and to 17th street surf shop. We came home and I went to the movies with Caitlin and Ross. We saw King Arthur which I must say was pretty good.    &nbsp;  Yesterday was church where I saw Michael the last time for 3 weeks, but I do say I thouroughly enjoyed his father's sermon. I knew that he'd start writing sermon's about me the second time I went there....    &nbsp;  Well, I'm off to take a shower and go on with my day. I've missed all of you terribly, send me an e-mail sometime this week or give me a call if you want to do something when I get back.    &nbsp;  I love you all    &nbsp;  Allison

      Needless to say this has been an awful week. It's been more than that.  Let's use the term  hellish  to describe it.  I am sick of our old church. That's right, I will no longer claim Calvin Presbyterian as  my church  anymore. Anyone who was involved in youth group or the 4th of July "program" knows why I am leaving, and there are very few words that describe the joy of getting out of that congregation.   Today Nicole comes and gets me, we go back to her house, and take our time because we think that kempsville is right next to Lynnhaven. Well guess what.  It freaking isn't.  It tooks us almost a half hour to get to the movie theater, where we were supposed to see a movie with mike and several other people. But, as soon as we get there (which was 20 minutes late) we're told that the movie sold out. SOLD OUT!!!! Of course I'm pissed off and had already had a countless amount of dissapointments this week, and was on the verge of tears. Nicole said come on we're going to the beach.   After 20 minutes of driving and some old school Weezer, I was calmed down quite a bit. We parked at Nicole's Aunt Mita's house, and walked with surfboards in arm down to the beach.  Now, the time I had gone surfing before didn't work out very well because it was extremely flat. But, today there were decent waves. I stood up twice, and bruised myself a thousand times that. I did alright for someone who's only surfed once. I do say, it's addicting.  I come home to my grandma's house and ate some sushi (which at this point I'm thinking hey, things are gonna look up). Yeah, well they didn't.  I get a call from my mom saying our choir director, whom I've already told that I would not be at our old church for a rehearsal before the program because I'd be at my church, has decided that he  is  going to have rehearsal at the time I'd be at my church. After an hour and a half of being told to shut up, stop talking about it and being threated to having any contact with my friends taken away, my mom finally said it's your decision, do as planned. I don't give a flying cracker if I upset the stupid choir.  I've made every single rehearsal, I'm the only one who has, and this really isn't my responsibility.  I was volunteered by my mother to play in this program.   Enough complaining about the crap going on, I'm out.  -Allison

      The past few days have been ridiculously crazy.   I've been helping my grandma with my grandfather a lot lately, have had really stupid rehearsals for nothing at my old church and haven't been able to spend time with most of my friends (except megan) this week.  Mike comes home early this weekend, I'm very happy. I got a wonderful phone call this afternoon about the spawns of satan that he takes care of. Poor kid.  Wow, I'm talking to Tony, a really old friend from Norfolk Christian. His cousin just recently died in Iraq and he went to the funeral today. Please keep him and his family in your prayers.  Well kids, It's getting on the late side and I'm slowly wilting.   Good night.  -Allison

       I'm home guys.      But not for long.      Tomorrow I'm cleaning all day until about 2:30, then I'm meeting up with Michael and his mom at starbucks so we can catch up, I mean it's been 2 weeks or so now since I've seen him.      Then I'm off to my lesson, and back home to pack.      Tuesday I'm going to warped tour all day long. Then waking up  early  wednesday morning to go back to Nags Head with Nicole (what a mess that was to work out between our parents).      I come back from that on saturday or so, and sunday is church.      I'm home until next friday, and then I leave again for another 10 days to look after my grandmother again.       So....guys, I'm not really gonna be able to hang out with anyone for the rest of the summer. I'm really sorry, and I hate not being able to do anything with anyone, but I guess that's just the way that life goes.      Well, I need to get some sleep, it's been a long week, and I don't wanna look like a zombie when I see Mike tomorrow :)      Love you all,      Allison
