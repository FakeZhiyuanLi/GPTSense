      I'm not sure if mum is going to kill me because I didn't get home last night until 12, after she went to bed and I told her I'd only be 20 minutes at 9:30. But she has been pretty good with those things lately. I'm really bad at losing track of time, or ignoring it, lately. It's kinda a bad habit to get into.   Well so far this morning I haven't done much. I feel bad about yesterday, maybe I did over reached a little to Jen's comment in Elle's blog but that's just part of who I am.

      Well today is pretty cruisy... Mum made me a scarf it looks so cool, actually she made me 2. They're purple and out of that feather wool stuff. Oh so warm...  Today is raining and miserable but I think we really need it and its going to make the garden look pretty again- silver lining.   I feel so tired yet so awake so the weather is actually pretty appropriate. I went to sleep at about 4:30 this morning. I really need to learn to go out earlier :P but it wasn't my fault.   I'm looking forward to the tigers v parra game even though I will be incredibly out numbered...

      For the past month or so all I wanted to do was a Medical Science degree at Sydney Uni to then go on and do a post graduate medicine degree. I was set on this being what I wanted to do and what I wanted to aim for the HSC. Mum came home last night and confused me again. She had been talking to some Med 3 students and they suggested that I don't do the med science degree if I wanted to do medicine and that I should instead do Pharmacy, chiropractor, or physiotherapy. They said that that way I could support myself with a career when I do the four year medicine course. Now I'm confused.  the other option that was suggested to me was to do Medicine straight away at University of Newcastle who still offers it as an undergraduate course. This would be good because personally the prospect of spending 7 years in uni isn't really appealing but I don't think that I could move away from home to go to uni.   This is so annoying just when I thought I knew what I wanted to do.

      Today was just one of those nice days. I didn't even attempt to do any study and just took the day off to unwind. I went for a nice drive to Moss Vale and Wollongong, it was very pretty and there was good company too :). The weather could have been better but you can't win them all.   I have tonight off work so I might continue my nice bludge that I have going.   I have a HEAP of yearbook stuff to do... There are profiles that need to be typed up, it's so tedious but I really want to get it done by REALLY early next term so there is no stress.

      Well so the kids have finally gone home and I have some peace and quiet. I should probably study and will feel guilty about it later, but you get that. I have to go to work tonight, work isn't too bad most of the time. I am still really tired from last night though, kids REALLY tire you out. I think I will be waiting SEVERAL years before I even consider having kids.   Well these holidays are already almost half over and I wonder where they have gone. I don't seem to have even put a dent in what I wanted to get done these holidays, but I always thought that my list was a little unrealistic. The teachers are all saying to make sure we're having time off, so I guess that's what I'm doing. I think I'm going to need it before next term starts, which is the serious stuff. I can't believe trials are so close. Everyone always says that they're harder than the HSC so I want to do well just to prove to myself that I can do well in the HSC. I'm sometimes so jealous of people who just don't care about school. I want to not care sometimes but it is not in my way, or my nature...  I'll have a good day off tomorrow. A nice long weekend and then I can work most of the second week. That should give me enough time to alteast start to study for trials. I know myself that I have to put more time into study and that I have been lazy so far this year... but it's just so damn boring.  Oh well here goes trying to study, wish me luck!

      Well I guess there is a first time for everything and this can be my first blog...   Well today has been good... it is after all holidays but i still have so much work to do. My step sister is down from Mudgee, going to the State of Origin while i get to look after her three kids with my lovely step dad, Les. So this pretty much means i miss the best game of football... oh well, i'll move on and soon be over it.

      Ok I know I've been a bit of a slacker and haven't posted.  Exams are so stressful but they'll almost be over and so will the HSC, that's what i figure with how fast this year has gone. AND with the completion of the HSC it brings about lots of celebrations including being 18 YAY for me lol.  I think my Chemistry exam today went alright but english yesterday is another story. I totally didnt answer one of the questions (King Lear) and just crapped on for a couple of pages. really pathetic. But there is nothing i can do now and I have time to work it out before the HSC... i just realise how much work i will have to do for english and how many practice questions.  PDHPE is tomorrow... i should do ok but not as well as i could. but thats always the way right.  well i better get to studying...
