       Jewel  I can feel you wrapped around me like warm silk. Your breath like jasmine, your eyes like burning blue flame. Your heart beats so close to mine, our bodies so close. Your touch is electric, your kiss is life. Holding you, being held by you is dying and being reborn.  I look into your eyes and see, see that I am in truth, the luckiest man alive.  Know you are loved, know you are cherished and valued highest above all else. Know I am so deeply in love with you. You cannot re-start that which never ended.  I Love You - Darlin Jewel  ME

       Howdie!!  Well this day is done, man am I tired - I was at work at 630 this morning. Yesterday I imaged the deputy directors pc with XP and today was the first log on for him so I wanted to be there when he logged on. Everything went just fine, lucky, lucky, lucky. Anyway by the end of the day I was tired.  As I type this I'm listening to "The War of The Worlds" original broadcast, neat.  Simple post today as I am tried.  Love you darlin Jewel.

       Wednesday Update  alright,  I survived another one! Did the usual stuff today, worked on busted PC's, wrote a file that automatically updates all our workstations, both XP and 2000, that one was over 400 lines and takes about twenty minutes to run, but I did it!!!  It's getting cooler, yea!!! In fact walking home was cooler than  walking to work this morning at 6:30.  I have some wonderful incense burning on my alter, it's Amber Resin, it smells like cake frosting, but it is wonderful. I know it pleases me and I'm sure it pleases the Gods as well, but if nothing else I like it...  Just had a most wonderful flash of you MJ, thank-you for the viz. ;)  So that's about it from here for now, more when it happens.  Love to all, but all for you Jewel

       Sean Update   Well here's the story, I went to court with my son, Sean, he's been avoiding school and court imposed work days and almost everything he's supposed to do in favor of running around smoking weed and hanging out with his girlfriend. Today was his court date, we show up at 10 like we're supposed to, and wait until after 11. They call us into court and the judge starts reading Sean's list of charges, that took almost three minutes in it's self. The he (the judge) asks Sean if he has anything to say and the boy starts into this I don't think (correctional) camp is the way to go, I was thinking of community service, I'm trying to get a job and... The judge cut him off and started reading his record, that took almost 5 minutes. At the end of that the judge looked at Sean and said one word, NO! Then he looked to the district attorney and told her, put this in your record, "CAMP" Then he ordered Sean to be placed into custody and held until November 12 when it's decided just exactly they are going to do with him.  Now you have to know I do love my boy, he is after all my son and heir. But I hate to think this is the legacy I'm leaving the world. Sometimes you just have to say enough, it hurts though, it hurts a lot.   Kira and Dawn Update   Ok, it looks like they are moving back to Hanford the first part of November, came as a surprise to me, but in all I'm not so very sad about it. Don't get me wrong, I love them, but I'm getting used to peace and quiet in my house, that and being able to go to the bathroom without an audience (Jewel you are excluded from that). It's been 12 years since I had a two year old in my house, ARRRGGGHHH!!! Hehe, and we wonder why some creatures eat their young......   Aw what the heck - An Amber update   She is doing fine, she went and got a tummy jewel for her pierced navel, a nice piece of body jewelry though, understated but not too demure, wouldn't be in keeping with her personality.   And finally - a Gordon update   I love you Jewel. ME

       Good Morning !!   Welcome to Monday, It seems strange for it to be so light out, but that will change. Soon I'll go to work in the dark and come home in the dark, this is a long boring time of year.  Tomorrow I go to court with Sean, not looking forward to that I can tell you, but it needs to be done.  Well, have a great day everyone.  Love to you all - especially you Jewel. ME

       "When I Look To The Sky"   When it rains it pours and opens doors And floods the floors we thought would always keep us safe and dry And in the midst of sailing ships we sink our lips into the ones we love That have to say goodbye   And as I float along this ocean I can feel you like a notion that won't seem to let me go   Cause when I look to the sky something tells me you're here with me And you make everything alright  And when I feel like I'm lost something tells me you're here with me And I can always find my way when you are here   And every word I didn't say that caught up in some busy day And every dance on the kitchen floor we didn't dance before And every sunset that we'll miss I'll wrap them all up in a kiss And pick you up in all of this when I sail away   Whether I am up or down or in or out or just plane overhead Instead it just feels like it is impossible to fly But with you I can spread my wings to see me over everything that life may send me  When I am hoping it won't pass me by   And when I feel like there is no one that will ever know me there you are to show me     So there you go then. Happy Sunday.

       Hello, Welcome to Sunday  It's been a nice weekend so far, don't you think? It's been quite warm here for October, in the mid 90's. Just a word to you Jewel, Love. I hope everyone enjoys their Sunday, remember set the clock back an hour, Or you'll be the first one in to work....... ;) - Homer Simpson -  "...Damn railroads..." Oh well, I made steak and eggs and toast for Sunday breakfast yummy, good old fashioned artery clogging goodness. Tonight we will have a good beef soup, I've been wanting that for awhile now. I also have been looking for a good pecan pie recipe, found a couple on the web one in particular sounds good, maybe I'll make it on Tuesday and take it to work, were having a tech pot luck on Wednesday, should be good.  Oh I have to go to court on Tuesday with my son, Sean, he's been not going to school and when he does go, he's being just the most delightful shade of shithead, so Tuesday we go to court, that is if he decides to come home, he's been gone since Friday.  If you haven't already -   DO NOT HAVE KIDS!!!!   - if you have, I'm sorry, believe me - I'm right there with you.  Well that's about it from here - for now. Off to enjoy mind numbing football entertainment.  Love to all - but especially you darlin Jewel. ME

       Happy Samhain !!  I was just reading something I wrote a while ago and thinking how nice it was. Here:  How many times in your life will you hold an angel? How many times will you see her wings spread out on your bed? To hold her and to touch her, to see her smiling down on you. To smell the sweet fragrance of her perfume hours after she leaves. I once held my angel. Saw her spread out before me like the sunshine. Heard her sweet cries of joy, and looked into her eyes. Held her hand and felt her love flowing into me. Look into her eyes and see the long awaited joy. Hear her speak and know you are in the presence of love. I once held an angel. Saw her wings. Heard her speak. Touched her skin. Sometimes I wonder, wonder why, wonder when, wonder if. Sometimes I cry. Sometimes I am empty. Sometimes I see angels.  For you my angel - Jewel

      Good Morning! I never get over people talking about "Hump Day" Maybe it's because I'm simple, but I always equate "Hump Day" with some kind of overt sexual innuendo. Whatever..... I suppose it's something I'll just have to deal with.  What a beautiful Sunrise it was this morning! All pink and salmon colored Just wonderful. I had the hardest time getting to sleep last night, my body was so tired, but my mind just would not shut up! I was standing out on the porch smoking a cigarette and my oldest, Kira, came out and asked what was wrong, I told her and she said for me to do what I used to tell her to when she'd have a bad dream. Picture yourself as a red ribbon floating in a blue sky.  What a wonderful relaxing thought. Red ribbon in blue sky, floating so peaceful and free. Blue sky.  Sigh............  Love to all, but especially you Jewle.  4 days to New Years!!

      Hey howdie! Well Monday went, and that's always good... Everything here is ok I guess. Kira and Amber are getting along great. It's nice to see the two of them not fighting. I was watching Amber playing with Dawn lastnight I was happy to see the two of them just playing and acting like Auntie and Neice. Sean on the other hand, I don't know what is to become of him. He acts like he is bullet-proof, but try as I might I can't get him to understand he is getting ready for a BIG fall, 22 months in the boy's correctional camp, if he does not straighten up his act and go to school, his probation officer is tired of his act and truthfully so am I.   On a lighter note, Saturday is Samhain!! Whoop!! New Years!! Looking forward to that I can tell you. No real plans for it, no one to celebrate with :( Oh well, I will survive I guess. Anyway, that is the news from here.  Later all. And my Love to you darlin Jewel

      Well, here it is Friday! Whoop!  Anyone out there have, pardon the spelling, exesama? I tell you it's no fun. I have it on my hands and my legs and feet. The dermatolagist prescribed some ointment I use it twice a day, it's crap. Makes me feel like I'm  suffocating, my skin can't breathe, that and it's slimey. Oh well, another day in wonderland. Love to you all, especially you Jewle. See you later.

      Just dropped by to say hi. I'm still here. I've been working on a method to deploy the service pack 4 for windows 2k across our network. I've got it working fine on the main backbone, the fiber links, but when it gets to the T-1 lines, brother what a mess!! Yesterday I ran a test on 6 machines across a T-1 line, the "clients" "concerned" about the length of time their machines were taking to shut down, just powered off in the middle of the update! Even after I had called them and told them in advance that the shutdown would seem to take a long time and to just let it run. Blech! Oh well..... Ya gotta love 'em, the law says you can't kill 'em. Besides, if it wasn't for them, I'd have nothing to do.  Peace out all - Love to you Jewle ME

      Some things in this life you just can’t change, Some things just have to be the way they are. You live a life you think will be the best you can do. You walk alone and wondering in this life of wonders Asking only to be loved and to love, to love and be loved. Walking this road you are an alien in your own world Someone who is not anywhere but is everywhere at the same time I found you, you found me – who’s to say how it happened  Some things you just can’t see until it’s just too late When all the love is gone, who will save you? Maybe you’ll find some thing that’s enough to keep you But if you find yourself alone, come home, come home. Well there are some things in this world that don’t make sense But if you look, look into your heart you’ll find me there – waiting  There is a hole in me, a hole – a scar in my soul that I hold very close It’s where you touched me, it’s where we were in love It’s where I go to when I’m feeling down and alone I touch you and hold you there, deep in my scar, deep in the abyss Of these feelings I’m not supposed to have or to talk about Touching your face and feeling your love so close and warm around me  I’m really not crazy, really, maybe if you look deep enough, you’ll see me How I used to be, how I want to be, how we could be, oh damn baby See a different side of me, how I used to be, how we could be  You could say I’m just a little unwell, well that’s just the scar talking.

      Yesterday's rain was intense! The lightning and thunder were an added bonus. At one point it was raining so hard it blocked the reception on my satellite TV. I like it when it rains, as long as I am warm and cozy in my house. Although I do enjoy a walk in the "light" rain, that can be fun.  Well I hope everyone enjoys their Sunday. Maybe more later. Love to all - But more to you Jewel ME

       Server 2003 training update  W00T!!! Ok, so it's two days of "these are the neat things in our new product" training, what the heck, it's two days away from the office, no phones no "OMG" the whole world is on fire and only you can put it out!!!  Only trouble is the place where we are holding the training is SO bloody cold!! Damn I wore my coat almost the whole day, and my hands were freezing all day, I swear it was warmer outside than it was inside.  Ah well, the price we pay for advancement I guess.  I do truly LOVE this CD, Matchbox 20 - more than you think you are - especially tracks 3 and 7, WOW what angst, what pathos, I love it.  Speaking of what I love.... Jewle you gotta know this is coming your way, I love you - with all my heart. Night all, ME

       Hello  I know I sent this as an E-mail, But it bears posting here - I do hope it was not the offending one darlin.   Lay all your troubles down...   A slow dance, you and me Our bodies moving together In sweet rhythm across the floor Music playing but a background to our closeness,  A supplement to our close world. Holding you, you holding me, as we move across the floor Being wrapped up in you, you in me, I look into your eyes You into mine, the music softly moves us. Darling I see in your eyes the love of a thousand lifetimes The caring gentle love I have waited for waited so long for. Dance with me darlin; let the rest of the world take a break Let this just be the two of us, let this just be you and me for a minute Just you and me for a time, Jewle I love you; I love you so totally, so much. I just want to be in your light, to be held in your beautiful loving light.

      Well yesterday was one of those rare days here, it snowed. Not just a flake or two, there was ten of them!! No, we got about 8" to a foot of very wet, heavy snow. And the city and county shut down. It was chaos. Where I work there were 9 out of 50 people. Trees are broken everywhere and the gutters are blocked with frozen snow, oh to top it all off it rained almost all day!! The runoff is so deep in places that walking is out of the question. And still I see people driving like it's the Daytona 500! Blech! Somedays I just shake my head.  Love to you all - My heart to you Jewel

      I've just been thinking, maybe not the wisest of actions. I was wondering about time lines. You know, what "they" say about reality and such being parallel, I was wondering about what it would be like to be able to cross into another time line. To be able to carry the knowledge you have now into another reality, kind'a like sliders, you know the T.V. series. What would it be like to be able to go somewhere where you and someone you love more than life it's self had the chance, the time to be together? To be somewhere where you two lived as one, with no other thing to worry about. What would that be like? I wonder... Like I said, it's not always a good thing when I start to think. ME

      Well it's been a while hasn't it? Sorry for the gap, but I just haven't been in the "blog" state of mind. Actually I haven't been in any state of mind at all. Just letting the days wash over me like a fog, guess I need to come up and take a look around huh? Well it's Christmas day, whatever, I celebrated Yule on Monday that was nice - quiet celebration just some candles and introspection. Had dinner with two of my kids. Just a quiet domestic scene. I got to have lunch with my Jewle on Tuesday, that was nice, just being with her, seeing the way she lights up when we are together, knowing I light up the same way, holding her hand, smelling her scent, it just feels so very good, so right and proper. *sigh* I was watching the news about the Mars lander Beagle - oops! Well I guess they'll keep trying until they get it right, but I wish it would have worked right the first time, feel sorry for them - all the hard work and planning. Ok, well I guess that's about all from here, more when I get some kind of sensory input to tell you about.  Peace to you all - My everlasting love to you darlin Jewel ME

But you know that, I could see it in your eyes I could feel it in your kiss as we said good-by, I could tell by the way you trembled and your heart was racing. I have this feeling you are just as taken with me as I am with you, huh? Ah sweet mystery of life at last I've found you.  Have a great day my love, know you are blessed and so very loved.  Peace to all, but my heart and body and soul to you my Jewel ME

      Ok, now that I'm on a roll here is another fire story. About six months earlier there was a great lightning storm along the mountains just East of the town, this was a regular occurrence, but this storm was very nasty. There was about, oh I'd say 100,000 acres of empty sage brush, cheat grass and tumbleweeds where the fire started. The fire for some reason moved from East to West, against the wind directly into town. Well seeing as the population of Winnemucca was only 2500 at the time, every person who could swing a shovel was put to work on the fire line.  The fire would burn and then jump and start somewhere else, I later understood that cheat grass roots act like a kind of fuse, allowing the fire to burn underground for as much as twenty or so feet before springing up somewhere else, well the BIG men were driving caterpillars and cutting fire breaks as fast as they could trying to stop it, but the fire was racing ahead of them just as fast. My friend and I decided that we needed to go get some water for the crew, as it was very hot and dry work also we knew the town water supply was just over the ridge in a canyon in a cave... We gathered up all the containers we could find and set off for the water. The door was a two inch thick sheet of steel, and bolted shut, but being resourceful youths we got the bolts off and went in to the cave, how can I tell you the difference in the temperature?? The cave must have been 70 or so degrees, where as outside it was over 100 and the fire made it even hotter, it was heaven. My friend and I began filling everything we could with that cold water to take to the cat operators on the line, just as we started to leave, about ten men came rushing into the cave slamming the door shut. Thank God you guys had this door open they shouted, Why? We asked, because the fire is buring right over us!! We could feel the air pressure change and the temp rise just a bit, but not more than ten degrees, the noise was like a wind blowing by, then it was gone. When we opened the door, the ground looked like a smoking Moonscape, all grey and nothing but ash. We slogged that water to everyone we could find, they all thanked us too. I remember that night, the Sun had set long ago, but we were still at it, there was a Pinion pine burning along the ridge, me and about six of my friends were standing around looking at it and a man drove up in a truck. He threw a six pack of 24 ounce Budweiser's and some shovels at us, and yelled, go to it until it's out!! We laughed and drank beer and threw dirt on a burning tree for the next four hours!!! But we put that sucker out!! Ah well, memories...  Love you Jewle. ME

      I want to tell you the story of the great burning of the Hotel Winnemucca. When I was a teen, I guess I was 16 or 17, I used to work for the city crew, the city of Winnemucca, as a member of the city crew you were a part of the volunteer fire department along with all kinds of other things, but about this time of year, several years ago, I was just finishing my job as marquee changer at the only theater in town, when I noticed smoke coming from the hotel. I was not alone in this discovery, as there were several people standing around pointing up at the plume of smoke rising from the building. In a few minutes the head of my department arrived and so did the rest of the fire department, we stood for a bit discussing what we should do, then before I knew it we were on the top floor of the building, kicking down doors and yelling "get the FU&k out  the building's on fire" we went down the floors kicking and screaming until we came to the ground floor, the sight there was so surreal, people still sitting at the gaming tables playing cards and shooting craps, it was so wrong, but we yelled at them that the fire was right behind us and to get the hell out of the building. We ran across the street, and manned the water hoses, and began to pour water onto the burning building, let me tell you about winter in Winnemucca, it was about ten or twenty below zero, you get the point?? Ok, well it was by this time two or three in the morning, and it was VERY cold, I manned a water cannon for about two hours, just pouring water on the side of the building, trying to keep the fire from spreading, the sight of the elevator shaft dropping into the basement was really cool, I have never seen so much compressed gas go up like that in my life, all the soda and beer and co2 kegs lighting up all at once, I swear, it blew the elevator up out of the building about thirty feet!!. Ok well anyway, there I was hosing down the side of the building, and my relief came, he tapped me on the shoulder and said ok, let go and I'll relieve you. I couldn't, my hands were frozen to the cannon!! At least three inches of ice held my hands to that damn thing, he had to go get a hydrant spanner to break the ice off my hands!! I don't really know why I thought of that, but there it is anyway. Love to you all, but my heart to you darlin Jewle ME

      “Is that a Marlboro?” I asked, hoping against hope. “Yes, you want one?” Oh brother did I, “yeah” I said; “You want to hear a story? It’s a good one” I said, sparking up the butt. The flight attendant nodded, sitting down across from me, ignoring the smoke from the cigarette. “You see it all happened like this…”  I don’t know how we ended up on the same flight, going to who cares where, but there we were. The flight was long and boring, but we just sat and didn’t really say much, each in our own little worlds. About ten hours into the flight, the weather started getting really rough; you know “cast away” kind of rough. The plane was bouncing and rolling all over the sky. After a while the pilot came on and told us we had to ditch and to get ready for water landing, well the lady and I got into position, and readied ourselves for a rough landing, did I say rough? Well brother you have never felt anything the likes of it, the whole world came crashing down on us and the water was everywhere, flames and noise and crying, you’d think the whole world was ending, and for us it almost did. Well after a bit we found ourselves swimming in the wide open ocean, just the two of us. The plane was gone without a trace, nothing, just us in the wide ocean, swimming for our lives. After a bit we could hear the sound of waves breaking on the shore, nothing better to hear I can tell you than that sound, well we struck out toward it and after a bit found our selves washed up on the beach, coughing and sputtering, but alive.  I can’t really say how long we laid there, just so tired and glad to be on land. The sun was high up when we woke and started to move around, we were pretty tired and weak from the swim and the crash and all, so we didn’t really move too far from that spot. After a bit I got really thirsty, and started to look around for some fresh water, the Lady followed me, I guess not wanting to be alone and maybe she was thirsty as well. We explored around and after awhile we found a small stream of fresh water and man did we sink to it, drinking all we could, and then washing the salt off us, boy did that feel great! Laying back on the bank letting the water and the warm sun lull us into sleep, we nodded off for a bit. When I woke up, the Lady was moving around just inside the jungle, looking I guess for food or whatnot, I went up to her, taking her arm I said, look we need to get shelter and a fire, you understand me? She just looked at me, her eyes so big and green, man those were the loveliest eyes I have ever seen, she didn’t say anything, just pointed off into the forest, I looked where she pointed and I could see some kind of structure, we walked over and as we got closer, I could see it was some kind of pillbox, you know left over from the war, well we went inside and started looking around, there was all kinds of stuff still in boxes and cans. Food and supplies for a whole army it seemed.  I was really stoked with the find, I laughed and cried and told Her everything would be fine, I don’t know who I was trying to impress, but it made me feel a lot better. As we explored our little cache, we found everything we would need to survive on that island, everything… That night we made out camp, there were a couple of bunks and we made ourselves as comfortable as we could on them. As I was drifting off I said – good night Lady, sleep well, and not for the last time did I say it.  Every night I would light a signal fire, hoping some rescue attempt would be out there looking for us, and every night I would return to the camp, silent and dejected. The Lady would just smile and offer me some food, I don’t think for the first month She ever said a word.  We had been on that island for about three months, one night we were sitting in a glade, just looking up at the big full Moon, the fire crackling in the background; The Lady looked at me and for the first time She spoke. I’m happy to be here with you she said, and leaned over and kissed me, on the cheek. Very polite and chaste, just that, a quick peck and it’s done. I was stunned, the first words She says to me, and the kiss as well!! Man was my night turning out OK!  That night as I lay in my bunk, tossing and turning, trying to get Her out of my head, I thought well why not? Go ask if She felt anything like I did, you know – horny.   I stood by Her bunk and watched as She slept, her breasts rising and falling, the relaxed and peaceful look to her face, her dark hair spread out on the pillow. Damn, I could not bring myself to it, I just couldn’t. She looked to peaceful to wake up, instead I just stood there and watched Her sleep, cursing to myself; I retreated to my bunk and fell asleep. That night, as we sat by the fire, I got up my courage and asked Her if she, you know, was feeling any kind of feelings. She looked at me with those beautiful eyes, and said, I’ve been waiting for you to ask me that. She stood and took off Her top, literally dropping the whole of what She was wearing onto the ground. Her body was firm and tight. Her breasts high and Her nipples hard. I stared, I’m sorry to say, I stared like a schoolboy, but Her body was fine and every part of Her spoke of sensuality. Her sex just covered by the briefest of hair. I was amazed, but also VERY excited.  She knelt down in front of me, taking my pants off, She began to stroke my extremely hard member, I damn near came then and there, but She gently took me into Her mouth and began to suck me, gently and very deeply. I was coming in no time, She milked me emptying me into Her mouth, I took Her hips and moved Her over my mouth and began to lick Her, my tongue driving deeply into Her sweet folds. She moaned and rode my tongue, Her soft hands stroking me, urging me back to hardness. She came and came, Her juices running down my face. Moving around, She straddled me, taking my very hard and throbbing member in Her hand, She guided me between Her silken thighs and into Her body. Oh my God! The incredible feeling of being inside this wonderful woman’s body was awesome! The way She rode me, the way She clenched and stroked me with every muscle, was amazing! We spent the rest of the afternoon making love on that shady spot. All our energy was spent pleasing each other right there.  At last we fell apart, too spent to go on, I was shaking, She was gasping and trembling. We lay together, holding each other, just being so close and warm.   I have no idea just how long I slept there, but when I woke up it was night. The fire was still burning, but I could not find Her, I called and called, but She was not to be found, I got kind of frantic, what if She had got lost or hurt or something? What would I do? I spent the rest of the night looking for Her but never found Her.  The next morning you guys found me and here I am. All rescued and better, right?? But to tell you the truth, I’d rather be back on that island, I’d rather be back there with Her.

      Heaven bent to take my hand And lead me through the fire Be the long awaited answer To a long and painful fight  Truth be told I've tried my best But somewhere along the way I got caught up in all there was to offer And the cost was so much more than I could bear   Though I've tried, I've fallen... I have sunk so low I have messed up Better I should know So don't come round here And tell me I told you so...  We all begin with good intent Love was raw and young We believed that we could change ourselves The past could be undone But we carry on our backs the burden Time always reveals The lonely light of morning The wound that would not heal It's the bitter taste of losing everything That I have held so dear.  Though I've tried, I've fallen... I have sunk so low I have messed up Better I should know So don't come round here And tell me I told you so...  Heaven bent to take my hand Nowhere left to turn I'm lost to those I thought were friends To everyone I know Oh they turned their heads embarassed Pretend that they don't see But it's one missed step You'll slip before you know it And there doesn't seem a way to be redeemed  Though I've tried, I've fallen...  I have sunk so low I have messed up Better I should know So don't come round here And tell me I told you so...  But then again, I love you darlin, ME

      Hey darlin, I want to tell you a little story about my day today. Every word is true just the way it happened.  This morning as I walked to work, I was talking to my self and fretting about the sad state of my checking account and how I thought I had budgeted it right down to the penny, then the doubt crossed my mind "What if there is some unexpected surcharge or something. It would just crush my house of cards." As I walked I thought, "Well maybe I can ask someone at work to borrow $10 and put that in the bank as a buffer." I resolved that was what I would do. No more than thirty seconds after I said that I looked down on the sidewalk and noticed a receipt, it looked odd so I stopped and took a closer look. There was a $10 bill and three $1's, 5 quarters and a penny. I looked at the receipt thinking if it was a Safeway receipt and the person had used their club card it would have their name on it and I could try to get it back to them. But no, it was a Dollar Tree receipt (the irony was not lost on me), I chuckled a bit, then noticed where I was standing, Right in front of the cross at the Methodist Church. I paused for a heartbeat and looking up to the sky said "Thank-you". I went on in to work and told everyone I came across the story, everyone said "Some one's looking out for you." Too True. At 9 I went to the bank to deposit the windfall, as I stood and told the teller the story, he said that only happens very rarely. I asked him what my balance was and he said $.61, my heart leapt into my throat, I asked about the two checks, one for the rent and the other for the power ($575 and $69 dollars respectively), he said, they both cleared, you made it by $.61. Now I have $14.82 and a deeper feeling of peace knowing I am truly being watched over.  So that was my day honey. Know you too are loved and cared for, and thought of and cherished. ME

      Just sitting here reflecting over the past year. Some good things and some not so good, wondering how much detail I should go into.  On the good side - I got to see my daughter and grand-daughter for about two months. Maybe also that I got to see my sweetest one for a brief time also - the memory of that still rocks my heart (thank-you darlin) I got to see some very beautiful sunrises and some stellar events that were truly wonderful (thank-you Gods) I still have hope, faith and joy in my heart. I still have a roof over my head and heat in the house and sometimes we even have food! W00t!!  On the not so good side - War, famine, pestilence, natural disaster, and the DRM/RIAA movement (BLECH!) Moments of doubt and self-persecution, times of unfettered longing for that which I just cannot have. Times of self-loathing and doubt, times of fear, times of being just a lump of clay on the river bank of life.  However, I would call 2003 a balanced year.  My love to you all - But my heart is yours my sweetest one.  Always, ME

      Sometimes all you can do is just hold on. Sometimes all you can do is just be there. Sometimes all you can do is love with no hope, no hope at all in your heart for that to come back to you. Sitting alone, being empty, wondering if it is all some kind of joke. Seeing people in love, holding each other and feeling like I want to choke. Feeling like I am so alone and not knowing what the hell. Knowing I have to hold on, cause only time will tell the story. Knowing knowing, knowing. Swimming in the deep dark sea of your love my darling, swimming in those deep dark seas. I hope to see another day of your love, I hope to feel your arms another day my love. I walk down your street in my mind, I see your house and hear your voice. I see you standing where we made love, arms wrapped around yourself, swaying to the music playing in your head and I cry, I cry - tears of sorrow, tears of joy, tears of madness and tears of pain. Sometimes all you can do is just hold on. Sometimes all you can do is just be there.

      So today I spent just kicking back and not doing a whole lot of anything, I have had the last four days off and tomorrow will be number five. I got a Valentine card for Jewel, I think she'll like it - I know I cried when I read it, but then again I cry at anything now-a-days. Just sitting here wishing I was with her, nothing out of the ordinary. Getting ready to go to bed, maybe to dream about my sweetheart. But otherwise - nothing to report. Be well all, my heart and soul to you darling Jewel. Always, ME

      One thing, Oh Please!! Get over it!! I'm sorry, did the director of the FCC find himself (ok here comes the obligatory pun) "titalated" by the almost 1/4 second exposure of a woman's breast?? How ANAL is that?? I think the guy should take some time one sunny day, go into the bedroom with his wife, lock the door, strip naked (the both of them) and with the full light of day shining on them, have a frank and open discussion about the human body. Maybe his wife can explain the confusing parts, you know, show and tell - used to work fine when I was a small child. If he cannot explain to his children that "yes darling, that was a woman's breast" without feeling some un-holy urge, then I think he needs to have his meds upped. He certainly has NO place in telling the rest of the nation, "I'm outraged and YOU should be too." Sorry - BALLS!!! Just my two cents worth. Love you darlin Jewel (and I love your confusing parts too- hehehehee ;) Always , ME

      Here's a good place to visit. It's Super Bowl Sunday!! I'm off to a party with several people from work. Should be fun - I invited you too Jewel, but oh well. It's not really about the sports darlin, it's about getting together with friends and just having a good time. Ah well, maybe next year huh? So here is the next Sabat. Imbolc - February 2nd - Also known as Brigid or Candlemas, this is the time of growing light and new beginnings.  New seeds and plans for the future are planted and we will watch them grow throughout the year.  The new light brings inspiration.  This is a good time to write poetry.  Love to you all, but as always, my heart to you darlin Jewle ME

      Ok, I have been sitting here thinking about the phrase "making love to me" or "make love to me" or any of the variations of that phrase. Ok, Please... In this case the word "to" indicates ownership or possession, I would be actually masturbating and using your body to do it with, not a mutually satisfying arrangement huh?? But use the word "with" and you get a totally different situation, With - now we are in this together, you AND me, you matter, in fact my personal motto is - "you always cum first" :0 hehehehe. Just a twisted and totally open thought from the brewers yeast infected grey cells that I call my brain.  Peace to you all, but "you know what"  to you darlin Jewel  -"With" -  Hehehehehe ME

      Here is a new short story I just wrote. I composed it on the way back from Sacramento - (2 hours of nothing to do but dream)  “Ladies and gentlemen of the planet Earth, allow me to introduce myself, my name is Elord Wallen Jones. I was born in the year 1957 in a small California town to two undistinguished parents.” These were the words that began the world shaking preamble. “I have entered into a contract with the nation of Kenya to build for me a grand and functioning spaceport. To this end I have delivered to that nation’s ruling government the sum of $500 million U.S. dollars with the promise of $500 million dollars for each successful completion of the construction schedule, not to exceed the sum of One Trillion U.S. dollars. This is due to my need for a free port on this planet, one to which and from which my ships can come and go with their cargos and conduct free trade with the entire planet. Let me assure you, I am from this planet, not some alien born invader.” I glanced around the control room on my ship, nothing but quiet and assuring eyes from my staff, emboldened I went on; “The area I have selected will encompass over 100 square miles and will be fortified and defended to the utmost. Let me assure you this is not an offensive move, but a defensive one instead. Some of the ships in my fleet are very large, I believe you have satellite scans of the construction under way, and can clearly see some of the docking rings are well over 25 kilometers in diameter, let me tell you this, the actual size of the ship is four times that diameter. You are no doubt doubting and skeptical of my claims; I know I would be if I were you. Let me show you some of these ships.” I turned aside and whispered off camera; “721.” Suddenly hovering over the North American land mass was a ship over 100 kilometers across, again I whispered “934.” Again ships sprung up, hanging in space like giant jewels. “You should now be seeing a small representation of the fleet I have. I ask you again not to be afraid. I am not a conquering enemy, bent on the destruction of humanity; instead I come with the offer of our ultimate salvation.”  I waited for a few moments before going on; “Ladies and gentlemen, let me say that I found the secret of the drive and cloaking device in 2007, I built the first inter solar ship in 2012. Since then I have been secretly recruiting volunteers from every nation to go into space and work together to take our first real steps into the cosmos. In 2015 we built the first ship capable of intra galactic travel. We have been mining the asteroids and well into the Oort cloud. We have smelting and refining plants inside the orbit of Venus. Our manufacturing output is many times that of all the industrialized nations put together. We have colonized the Moon and Mars; we have colony stations on several of the larger asteroids. In all I would say there are over a million of us living throughout our solar system. As we speak, there are four ships exploring the nearest galaxies, their progress is reported in real-time to me. To date we have found 27 sentient species in this galaxy alone. Twenty six are at our level of advancement; the other is more advanced. They have no fear of us, nor do they wish us any harm, quite the opposite; they have warned us of another species that is quite xenophobic. We have the maps of their domain and direction of travel and have seen that they are quite happy to be going away from us, so we leave them alone – they leave us alone.”  “I know, at this point you’re saying – this guy’s an idiot, this guy is just trying for his ‘Warhol’ moment, well let me assure you that is not the way of it. I am indeed serious, in fact I make this offer; all of the governments of the world, gather you’re most distinguished and prominent scientists together in your nation’s capitols, say three weeks from today, and I shall demonstrate to them that all I say is the truth. Each one has been sent a package, a small device that will transmit a signal to me to let me know they are assembled. When I receive this signal, they will be transported to my ship for the demonstration. They will report back to you and you can make your decisions from their reports. I know you must have questions, but let them all be answered in three weeks time. Until then I bid you all adieu.” Camera cut to black and I’m spent.  “What do you think they’ll do?” someone asks, “well, to be honest, I’d go to the highest stage of alert and target our ships with everything they have” I say glancing over to the sensor array – which by now is lighting up like a Christmas tree – “See? They’re already starting. Cloak all ships and await my orders” Silently as they first appeared, the ships vanished from sight. “All ships change positions to defensive grid twelve.” Silently the ships, great and small shifted orbits until none were anywhere near where they were, all safely beyond the Moon.  Someone asked me, “Sir, how will you tell when all the scientists have been assembled?” I winked in a sage and oh so wise move, “I sent each one of them a small package, each one contained two objects, one strange and one familiar. I know the odd one would be disposed of, by security or a well meaning secretary or whatever, but each object contained a set of nannites, each sent signals to me with the whereabouts of who ever touched it, I am tracking each set of signals. When the time comes, I’ll bring everyone aboard and then we’ll begin the fun.”  Who said time flies when you’re having fun? Well it must not have been someone waiting out the world. I can tell you that was the longest three weeks of my life. Finally the waiting was over. We move the ship into orbit and began receiving signals from my little spies. One by one, group by group, we transported them aboard and began the show. For the most part, the scientists were all too willing to go along and pretend they had seen all this coming well in advance, and my ships just proved what they had been saying all along, yada, yada, yada. The security and other personnel were, well let’s just say, they were not so believing. We seemed to have picked up several Special Forces and secret service agents in our little net. Let me tell you they are hard to convince. We had moved the ship to our lunar base, and were conducting interviews there. One of the more reluctant Special Forces officers has run me out of every explanation I had. He was determined that we were in some sound stage on Earth and that the whole thing was just some put on. Finally, out of patience and options, I transported him into an airlock, just inside the base – on the other side, beyond the force field, was nothing but lunar vacuum, that and the fact that it was night time and the temperature was -200C.  “Sir, you have asserted at every turn that we are on some elaborate sound stage somewhere on Earth. You have resisted every demonstration I have to offer, except one. Check around yourself and make sure there are no wires or anything else upon which you could be suspended. Go on, check” Rather dubiously he did. “Now jump up in the air, the artificial gravity is not on in the airlock.” Let’s just say, His Airness himself could not have cleared that vertical leap. “Now, do you see the shimmering wall?” Yes he replied, “Well what do you think is out there?” Nothing but the sound stage… Oh come on, this guy is busting my nards – “Well ok then, it’s a sound stage, maybe there’s some sort of vacuum just on the other side of that ‘picture’ of a lunar landscape; right??” Maybe; you could be really smart that way… (Oh man this guy was just asking for it….) “Alright then; you who know it all, why don’t you stick your arm through that wall and tell me what it feels like? I’ll warn you though, the temperature on the other side of that wall is -200C and there is no atmosphere so your arm will be exploded and frozen in about three or four seconds, most likely we’ll have to amputate it – nasty mess that… But you’re so set on this being a fake, go ahead and step out that door and walk home then. Go on – do it.!” Hesitation… and more hesitation. Finally I give him and out; “Say, do you have to go to the bathroom?” WHAT!! He asks, “No, really, do you have to go? Look around for a container or something and fill it up, go on. I promise we won’t watch (snicker)” Well, alright….. Zip, whoosh, ahhh!!; “Ok, got it then?? Good. Now step close to the door, don’t touch it but just close to it. Now toss that cup out the door. It should freeze and float across the surface instantly. Ready? GO!” Well you can see his face from there, frozen pee floating across the lunar landscape. “Are you happy now??” I asked. Well – eh – ok – can I come back to the interview room now??  It was about three or four days later, I was talking with one of the new crew.  “We have some interesting discoveries about those other races I spoke of before. It seems as their DNA is almost exactly like ours, accounting for genetic drift over the ages, they could be our long lost brothers and sisters. We have been excavating deep into the Moon and have found something unbelievable. Would you like to see it?” – “Yes very much.” – “Very well.” We took the elevator down and down and down, thousands of feet under the surface, until we came to a vast chamber. The center was lit by a dim light that seemed to come from everywhere, as far as the eye could see, there were glowing banks of cylinders, millions upon millions of them. You could see where some had been removed, but there were still lots of them remaining. The overwhelming object though, was a giant crystal, clear and beautiful, spinning in the light. Nothing touched it, nothing was anywhere near it, it just hung there and spun silently.  “We have done some extensive radiocarbon dating of all this, It’s off the chart. We estimate it’s over 10 Billion years old. I mean the whole universe is only supposed to be 15 Billion years old, and our solar system is only 4.5 Billion. But this thing is almost as old as the universe it’s self! I have wondered about this, wondered and pondered and questioned everything I have ever known for an answer. Just lately I think I have one, tell me how this sounds. In the beginning…”  You see? Once there was an advanced race, they wanted to ensure they would not fade from existence, they created Her. She was able and capable of traveling vast distances. When She found a planet that She thought would make a good home, She parked Herself in orbit and waited. She gently steered those comets and other planetary bodies that had what She needed into our fledgling Earth, giving us water and gasses and all the other things needed for our little planet to support Her cargo. Shielding us with Her own body, She protected us from the worst of the cosmic rain until Her little planet had developed to a point where Her cargo could gain a foothold and then She seeded us. Over and over again until life took.  Why, if this is so far fetched, is the Moon featured so in every culture’s history as the Mother? Why does the same side of the Moon always face us? She is waiting for us to say something, I know it, we have decoded the uppermost of the crystal, it covers our ‘electric-age’ but before that it is incomprehensible.  We spread across the universe, we carry the message. Let us make Man in Our image, and it was good.

      I tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone. But I've been alone all along. darlin, Tell me it's the same as it's always been Just us, just quiet glances in passing, the longing look. Tell me and I'll believe you. There's darkness at the gates love, there's fire on the rooftops. Tell me and I'll believe you, tell me anything, I'll believe you. How have I come to this place? Ask me no questions, I'll tell you no lies. Same for you? I think so, there's no limit to the feelings I have for you. Damn I must be out of my head to feel this way, what right do I have anyway?? Sorry darlin, just a passing thing. Damn the darkness, damn the fire. Be well, be blessed. Be yourself. I'll be along shortly. ME

I took a nap today, from 10 till 2, but I'm yawing and sleepy right now, man I hope I can kick this thing - don't want it at all. Darlin, I really want to be with you, you know what I'm talking about. Honey just a few hours of your precious time. Ok, ok, I'll drop it for now. Hope to see you sometime in the coming week.

      I've never seen you looking so lovely as you did tonight I've never seen you shine so bright I've never seen so many men ask you if you wanted to dance They're looking for a little romance, given half a chance I have never seen that dress you're wearing Or the highlights in your hair that catch your eyes I have been blind The lady in red is dancing with me cheek to cheek There's nobody here, it's just you and me, It's where I wanna be But I hardly know this beauty by my side I'll never forget, the way you look tonight  I've never seen you looking so gorgeous as you did tonight I've never seen you shine so bright you were amazing I've never seen so many people want to be there by your side And when you turned to me and smiled, It took my breath away I have never had such a feeling Such a feeling of complete and utter love, as I do tonight  The way you look tonight I never will forget, the way you look tonight The lady in red The lady in red The lady in red My lady in red   And then he whispers this;  (I love you.)   Man, I mean I just get all weepy.  I love you darlin, Always and forever. ME

      Listen as the wind blows across the great divide, the night is my companion, solitude my guide. I go now to sleep. To dream, to hold you once more. Nothing is more real than you my love, nothing more real than you. I will be the one, to kiss you so hard I'll take your breath away. I will be the one, to kiss you so hard I'll take your breath away. Close your eyes dear. Longing for home again, I'm alright, It only hurts when I breathe, it only hurts when I breathe. Home is a feeling I buried in you. It only hurts when I breathe. I'm sorry 'bout the attitude, I'm so terrified of no one else but me, and you won't go away. Reach down your hand in your pocket, just pull out some hope from your pocket, for me, just some hope. I'm alone and waiting for the welcome home. Well it's just me, and I just can't seem to get myself to go away, just pull some hope from your pocket. That's all I ask, it's been a long day, just some hope, just a place to go, lord. It might as well be my fault, darling, as long as it's raining, it's 3 am I must be lonely. I really have no idea, I'm free floating here, bear with me, she swears the Moon don't hang quite as high as it used to. Baby, it's 3 am I must be lonely. She thinks that happiness is a mat that sits on her doorway... It's 3 am I must be lonely. So here I am behind blue eyes, discover, yes discover, the truth. I am alone here behind these eyes. I am not a bad man, my dreams are not empty, I have lonely hours, I have days of pain, don't we all? I love you, my fear and anger cannot show, I am just the man behind "smilin" blue eyes. So lonely, so lonely. This feeling, goes on and on, but I'm sorry, don't worry - I'm not telling lies. My dreams, not empty, my thoughts not empty, I am not greedy, I only want one. Life is a bitter sweet symphony, you have to know it, Life is a song, a play, a feeling. You can't just bury yourself in the burnt emotion, the pain and hollowness of past pain. Be with me on the only road that takes you to where you want to go. I'm a million different people from one day to the next, and I can't change my self if I wanted to. There's nobody singing to me now but you, nobody but you. Be with me in this bitter sweet symphony. Be with me. Go with me, be with me, hold me in this the final hours. Be my light, be my hold on this plane. Love you, Love you, Always, ME

      Breathe   I played the fool today I just dream of vanishing into the crowd Longing for home again Home, is a feeling I buried in you  I'm alright, I'm alright It only hurts when I breathe  And I can't ask for things to be still again No I can't ask if I could walk through the world in your eyes Longing for home again Home, is a feeling I buried in you  I'm alright, I'm alright It only hurts when I breathe I'm alright, I'm alright It only hurts when I breathe  My window through which nothing hides And everything sees I'm counting the signs and cursing the miles in between  Home  Home, is a feeling I buried in you, that I buried in you  I'm alright, I'm alright It only hurts when I breathe I'm alright, I'm alright It only hurts when I breathe, when I breathe Yeah, it only hurts when I breathe, when I breathe Oh,it only hurts when I breathe  "Breathe - Melissa Etheridge From the "Lucky CD""

      I'm still young, but I know my days are numbered 1234567 and so on But a time will come when these numbers have all ended And all I've ever seen will be forgotten  Won't you come To my funeral when my days are done Life's not long And so I hope when I am finally dead and gone That you'll gather round when I am lowered into the ground  When my coffin is sealed and I'm safely 6 feet under Perhaps my friends will see fit then to judge me Oh when they pause to consider all my blunders I hope they won't be too quick to begrudge me  If I should die before I wake up I pray that the Lord my soul will take but My body, my body - that's your job  Won't you come To my funeral when my days are done Life's not long And so I hope when I am finally dead and gone That you'll gather round when I am lowered into the ground  I can't be sure where I'm headed after death To heaven, hell, or beyond to that Great Vast But if I can I would like to meet my Maker There's one or two things I'd sure like to ask  Won't you come To my funeral when my days are done Life's not long And so I hope when I am finally dead and gone That you'll gather round when I am lowered into the ground

        Just what the hell do you mean, Pagan?? Ok, been there done that. Lets look at it like this, Paganism is religion without training wheels. Your god(s), are alive and living within you. You are the direct reflection of that belief. NO ONE can tell you how to worship and give honor to your God(s), NO ONE. To try and do this is nothing short of political control of your natural God(s) given right to worship it (them) in the manner of your choosing. Take back your rights!! Take back your right to the God(s) that give(s) you peace and joy and harmony and light. Feel your God(s) move inside you to worship in the way of your choosing.  Pagans - Why cast the circle in this direction on this day but not tomorrow? Why do you give the responsibility for the pleasure/displeasure to another? Take off the training wheels and pray to the Gods YOU love.  Christians - Your God is the God of love, yes?? Your God is the "unconditional" God of forgiveness, yes?? Then why is there one condition for His eternal love? Sorry - had to throw that one in there.... Your God loves you, no matter what, you live in the new testament(Grace)- for God so loved the world He gave His only begotten Son... Not the old (law) For your God is a Jealous God and will not suffer Any other before Him.  In the words of a street punk and law violator (much like Jesus...), "why can't we all just get along??"  Ok,

      Well my dearest one, It's time for me to go away for today, I've been up since 4 this morning. I'm tired and it's time for me to go to bed. Hope you had a wonderful day. Please know that I am aware of the depth of your love for me. Please know I am also aware of the pain our being together causes you. Bless you my darling for the hurt you endure for my sake, bless you also for the love I see in your eyes. Sweetest Jewel, you are truly blessed, truly special among all humans. I hold your love so close to my heart, so close to me. You move through me like light it's self. Be blessed my dearest love. I hold the light that shines from your eyes like the air I breathe. You are love in the flesh, you are kindness in the flesh, you are caring in the flesh. Darling, you are the hope, the faith, the reason for life it's self. Know you too are loved, cherished, valued and desired. Always, By, ME

      "Hands"  If I could tell the world just one thing It would be that we're all OK And not to worry 'cause worry is wasteful And useless in times like these I won't be made useless I won't be idle with despair I will gather myself around my faith For light does the darkness most fear My hands are small, I know But they're not yours, they are my own But they're not yours, they are my own And I am never broken Poverty stole your golden shoes It didn't steal your laughter And heartache came to visit me But I knew it wasn't ever after We'll fight, not out of spite For someone must stand up for what's right 'Cause where there's a man who has no voice There ours shall go singing My hands are small I know But they're not yours, they are my own But they're not yours, they are my own I am never broken In the end only kindness matters In the end only kindness matters I will get down on my knees, and I will pray I will get down on my knees, and I will pray I will get down on my knees, and I will pray My hands are small I know But they're not yours, they are my own But they're not yours, they are my own And I am never broken My hands are small I know But they're not yours, they are my own But they're not yours, they are my own And I am never broken We are never broken We are God's eyes God's hands God's mind We are God's eyes God's hands God's heart We are God's eyes God's hands God's eyes We are God's hands We are God's hands

      You cannot quit me so quickly There's no hope in you for me No corner you could squeeze me But I got all the time for you, love  The Space Between The tears we cry Is the laughter keeps us coming back for more The Space Between The wicked lies we tell And hope to keep safe from the pain  But will I hold you again? These fickle, fuddled words confuse me Like 'Will it rain today?' Waste the hours with talking, talking These twisted games we're playing  We're strange allies With warring hearts What wild-eyed beast you be The Space Between The wicked lies we tell And hope to keep safe from the pain  Will I hold you again? Will I hold...  Look at us spinning out in The madness of a roller coaster You know you went off like a devil In a church in the middle of a crowded room All we can do, my love Is hope we don't take this ship down  The Space Between Where you're smiling high Is where you'll find me if I get to go The Space Between The bullets in our firefight Is where I'll be hiding, waiting for you The rain that falls Splash in your heart Ran like sadness down the window into... The Space Between Our wicked lies Is where we hope to keep safe from pain  Take my hand 'Cause we're walking out of here Oh, right out of here Love is all we need here  The Space Between What's wrong and right Is where you'll find me hiding, waiting for you The Space Between Your heart and mine Is the space we'll fill with time The Space Between...

      I sat there on the coast of Marseilles My thoughts came by like wind through my hand How good it'd be to hold you How good it'd be to feel like that again How good it'd be to feel like that again  Would you be remembering me? I ask that question time and again The answer came and haunted me so I did not want to think it again I did not want to think it again  You make it hard for me to forget I haven't stopped loving you yet  When I left the coast of Marseilles I hadn't done what I'd come to do I spent all the money I'd saved And still did not get over you No I still did not get over you.  Ah Jewel... You make it so hard to forget. This is from the album "Son of a son of a sailor - Jimmy Buffet 1978"  The song is called Coast of Marseilles

      Oh Babe, My heart is pounding, my anxiety level is sky high, my pussy... oh yeah she's very wet, yet again! I was holding my breath waiting to see what was coming next. Oh yes, I was wishing I was there with you while I read this. I could so totally see us doing this.   This was... oh Gordon, baby you've got me hot & horney. I'm going to have to go take a nice long shower now.  Oh gasp I'm soooo horney & very wet!!!   I absolutely love the way you think & how beautifully you put it into words. Oh man, I'm tingling sooo badly. Yes, oh God yes, I DO want to do it again. I'm gonna read your next few letters, then I'm hittin the shower. Oh wow,!  You're a totally awesome lover!!! I'm so happy and proud to call you MY LOVER!  You'll be sleepin good tonite. And in a bit, I'll be calling out your name & sleepin right next to you. Thank you love.  Thank you for this vision, &amp; thank you for sharing.  I love you. Sleep well love, Her  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  I'm naked darling. I'm sitting here writing this and my cock is so very hard and so hot, you know how that feels don't you love?  I am thinking of you and I together. Our clothes are lying in a pile on my chair. Our bodies are pressed into one on my bed. We kiss and touch each other. My hands exploring your wet pussy, gently stroking you and rubbing your clit. Your hand is sliding up and down my hard shaft as we kiss and lick and nibble each other.  I gently begin to kiss my way down your beautiful taut body, until I get to your hot, wet pussy. Sighing, I begin to lick and suck you into my mouth, tasting your hot musky juices, I lick and suck you faster and harder, I slide one - then two fingers inside you and begin to massage your g-spot, only this time I don't stop. Faster and harder I get with you until you are squirming and coming one right after another. I position myself to where you can get your hand around me, and you are pumping my cock for all it's worth, your pussy still quivering and coming with each lick of my tongue. You guide me into your mouth and suck me, deep and strong while you climax again and again, almost urging me to come in your mouth. Taking me so deep, and so fast down your throat, your fingers stroking my balls and the base of my shaft as we please each other. I cant stand it anymore darling, I feel myself beginning to come in your mouth, you do to and bury your mouth down on me, my hard shaft coming deep in your mouth, you slide your hand up and down, milking me, draining me.  We lay for awhile, catching our breath, kissing and touching. We begin to kiss and pet again. Our passion rises and we draw closer and closer together. Our hands begin to explore, until we are both beyond patience, and you guide me between you legs and into your hot, wet, waiting pussy. I slide inside you, filling and stretching you. Your hips arch up to meet me, forcing me deep into you. I push against you, feeling you spread around me, I can feel your cervix open to me as I fill you deeper and deeper. I watch your eyes and your face as you get lost inside the emotion and feeling of our love making.  I watch you come again and again as I begin to drive into you harder and faster, my hard cock filling you so deep, and so completely. You have another explosive orgasm, I whisper to you to turn over. You roll over onto your hands and knees, I kneel behind you and enter you from behind. I watch as my hard slick shaft slides in and out of you. I feel your pussy sucking and milking my cock. At last I can feel the burning of my come rising up and wanting to fill you.  I lean over and thrusting deeply inside you, I whisper " darlin, I'm coming inside you. Do you want me to fill you up?" You thrust back hard against me and tell me "Oh Gordon, oh God honey, YES! I want your hot come inside me, fill me up, come deep inside me baby!"  I loose all thought of timing and control, and begin to wildly pound my cock into you, feeling you come again and again around me as I push my self into you to the limit, and then shoot my hot thick come inside you, wave after wave it flows into your wet, hungry body. We convulse again and again as we climax together.  After awhile, we begin to relax, and I slide out of you. We lay together happily spent and exhausted, my come is running out from between your legs. Its turning me on again. Do we want to go again??  There - How was that? I know I enjoyed it. Wow I am your lover, ME

      Humans, love 'em or hate 'em. Damn the seven faces of humanity. Faces showing compassion, faces showing piety, faces showing concern, faces showing interest, faces showing understanding, faces showing pain, faces showing love. Not one of them is the real face of humanity, not one of them. there is only one face that fits humanity, only one. The face showing contempt and utter disdain for anything outside it's self.  Damn the seven faces of humanity.  I would refer you to a good song - "Talkshow host - by Radiohead"

      That's about the way I have felt for the last few months. You know, things like getting out of bed, breathing -  those complex social things. I'll be damned if I'm going to put up with this shit. I have been the front line support for the current regime, my department right or wrong, it's my department, you know that sort of thing. Well so the fuck much for esprit de corps, so much for honor and duty, so much for personal sacrifice in the name of the common good. Screw 'em. I've been shown the reward for service and I'll tell you what, screw people. 98% of them aren't worth the powder it would take to blow 'em to Hell. I think someone should create an "Asshole" virus, the rest of us would have a WHOLE lot more room and a lot less stress.

      I want to scream, I want to shout out!!  I just have no idea what about.  Really, there is SOMETHING in me that wants to be heard,  wants to be recognized, wants to be held and comforted.  Wait a second.... It's me!!  I want to be held, I want to be close and comfortable,  I want to feel as though I am loved.  Loved and cherished and cared for.  I want to be the light of someone's eye,  that part of her that she cannot live without,  I want to BE with someone.    I want to be loved and held,  does that make me wrong or somehow bad?  I don't think so, I think that makes me human,  you know, human....    It's ok, I guess, I guess.  So I have "faith" - The substance of things hoped for and the evidence of things not seen.  "Faith"    Where are you?  I miss you, I long for you, I am so alone and scared in the dark.  Come find me, oh please, come find me.  I'm alone and scared.    But I - I don't mind - no I don't mind,  No I don't - I don't mind.  So take, take me home, 'cause I don't remember.  No, I don't remember.    Just come take me home.

      Well here it is, Saturday..... 'Ya gotta love Saturdays, so quiet and slow. I'm switched over to Firefox and Thunderbird, not the cheap wine but the e-mail client. I'll let it run for a while and see how I like it. Seems to be ok so far, I haven't found any sites that don't accept the Firefox browser yet. I had some doubts that the bank site would, but was plesantly suprised when I was able to log on and do some banking. I'm getting ready to play with my other drive and wireless NIC and see if I can get Red Hat's "Fedora Core 2" to see the wireless card, that has been the biggest drawback for me switching to Linux completely. If I can get this setup to work, then I'm switching. Well, have a great day. Be good to one another, be good to yourselves as well. Always, ME

      Hi, Amber and I went to the fireworks display tonight at the convention center. What a mass of humanity! Before the show I sat next to a man and his family who are from Pakistan, talking I asked him what he thought about the day (Independence Day), he sat quiet for a minute and then said "you seem to enjoy it"... Badoom - rim shot. Oh well, I guess we can't all be poet warriors. The event went well, except for the police parking a VERY LARGE pickup truck right in front of us. Amber and I walked around to the other side and stood and watched the spectacle, a very nice display.  Jewel - I hope your barbque went well, leftovers?? Yumm, I suddenly have a hankering for ribs and corn on the cob and potato salad and watermelon, then some more ribs and some more corn - any room left will be dedicated to beer, in short the perfect American barbque.  I remember as a kid the wonderful times we had when my Mom and Dad and Pappy and Nana would all get together and my Dad would grill burgers and ribs and corn, oh my what a wonderful time we would have. Sitting out on the porch eating watermelon, the juice running down my arms, spitting the seeds across the yard. Simple, child times; times when there were no cares no troubles no worries, just fun and simple pleasures.  Oh and not to forget the homemade ice-cream, quite possibly the finest confection ever designed by humans - period.

      It has come to my attention that the original posting was rude and also that a person would have to have an account to post comments. I apologize and have retracted the comment. I will see why you would have have an account to post a comment. Again, I do apologize.

      ALANIS MORISSETTE  "Everything"  I can be an asshole of the grandest kind  I can withhold like it’s going out of style  I can be the moodiest baby and you’ve never met anyone  who is as negative as I am sometimes  I am the wisest woman you've ever met.  I am the kindest soul with whom you've connected.  I have the bravest heart that you've ever seen  And you've never met anyone  Who's as positive as I am sometimes.  You see everything, you see every part  You see all my light and you love my dark  You dig everything of which I'm ashamed  There's not anything to which you can’t relate  And you’re still here   I blame everyone else, not my own partaking  My passive-aggressiveness can be devastating  I'm terrified and mistrusting  And you’ve never met anyone as,  As closed down as I am sometimes.  You see everything, you see every part  You see all my light and you love my dark  You dig everything of which I'm ashamed  There's not anything to which you can’t relate  And you’re still here   What I resist, persists, and speaks louder than I know  What I resist, you love, no matter how low or high I go   I'm the funniest woman you've ever known.  I am the dullest woman you've ever known.  I'm the most gorgeous woman you've ever known  And you've never met anyone as, as everything as I am sometimes.  You see everything, you see every part  You see all my light and you love my dark  You dig everything of which I'm ashamed  There's not anything to which you can’t relate  And you’re still here   And you’re still here  And you're still here...

      A while back - about a year or so ago - there was a project launched to send a spaceship into a 1000 year orbit around the Earth. The creators of this project asked for submissions to go onto that craft, hopefully to read by our decendendants in some distant future. This is my submittal to that wonderful quest:  To whoever and whatever may be reading these words – Greetings from a long time ago. I guess you might say I am your ancestor, maybe I am your age-old suppressor, and whatever the case I am long gone. I hope the world in which you live is beautiful and green, I hope the world in which you live is loving and generous to you all. I hope your world is kind and wonderful. I hope you are happy and healthy. I wish you to forgive the mess we left you all, we were blinded by greed and lust, and not the good kind at that. There were a lot of very concerned people in my time, people who wanted us all to stop the madness, stop the raping of our beautiful, wonderful little jewel. But, to the sadness of us all, we just went about our self-centered lives and kept destroying and hurting our Mother until She has no choice but to take us out of the picture. Ah – sigh – what a waste, what a waste of time and energy and faith it all has been. My wonderful, beautiful ancestors, hold to the truth of what I have been able to glean from my life, indeed I feel I have had many lives. These truths are as follows – Love each other as you love yourself, if it harms no one (and YOU are one) then do as you will. In my time I was what was called a Pagan, a believer in the ancient Gods, a person who was in touch with the eternal creative power of the Universe at least that what we thought we were doing, who is to say what is truth. I hope you have wonderful powers that allow you to move between the stars at will, I hope you are all but Gods in your own right. Be blessed my kindred, know you are walking in the eye of history. Know also those who went before you are thinking of you; know that some of us love you. I will leave you with some words of another wise person of my time, just in case things are not so beautiful or wonderful there, here is what that person said; I look at that dot and I think that’s here, that’s home, that’s us. On that dot everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever lived, lived out their lives. The aggregate of all our joy and suffering thousands of confident and mutually exclusive religions, ideologies and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love every mother and father, every hopeful child, every inventor and explorer, every revered teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every superstar, every supreme leader, every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there on a mote of dust suspended in  a sunbeam. The earth is a very small stage in a vast  cosmic arena. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that in glory and triumph they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of the dot on the scarcely distinguishable  inhabitants of some other corner of the dot. How frequent  their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one  another, how fervent their hatreds. Think of those who  derived their self-esteem from dividing the dot into two hundred still littler patches. Our posturing, our imagined  self- importance, the delusion that we have some  privileged position in the universe are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in a great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from  ourselves, it is up to us. It’s been said that astronomy is  a humbling and even character building experience. There  is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. For me  it underscores our responsibility, our profound responsibility  to deal more kindly with one another and to preserve and  cherish that pale blue dot the only home we have ever  known.

       Thanks to z0iid at computercops.biz for this beauty;  I am amazed at how people assume that safe mode is really "Safe"!  There are several viruses and spyware/adware that will run even during safe mode.  For the sake of argument (since you obviously believe that safe mode is actually "Safe"!), lets say you are accessing someones computer remotely (as many paid tech's do), OR the computer will not boot into safe mode - which is very possible!  A easy fix that has always worked for me (and I can't believe no one else has posted this before!) is as follows.  **Note, you should already know from research which registry keys are infected - btw, this is not your usual, "delete the registry key" fix!  1.  Navigate to the infected key, usually located in the RunOnce folder, or Run folder.  2.  Right click on the FOLDER that the key is located in.  3.  Choose permissions.  4.  DENY ACCESS for ALL users, including Administrator and SYSTEM.  5.  You will no longer be able to see the infected key.  **You are NOT finished yet!  6.  Restart the computer normally.  7.  Navigate to the file(s) that was/were previously undeletable (Tv Media, etc).  8.  You will now be able to delete the folder.  9.  Go back into registry,  change the permissions back to what they were.  10. The infected key will now show up again, but since the files are NOT running and have been deleted, you can now delete the key.   All of this can be accomplished without ever having to boot into SafeMode.

      Yep here it is, a fix, Thank-you to all those who Gooled for it, here is my personal experience; Here's the way;  On the pc while it's infected, open the registry and go to  HKLM-software-microsoft-windows-current version-run once, find the  executable (it will be TVM.EXE) and note the path. Reboot into safe mode - command prompt only. browse to the directory you noted go in it and delete everything in that directory, should be an .EXE and  two .DLL's, then go up one level. type dir /x to get the dos name for the directory and then delete it  using the dos name. browse to documents and settings go into the user's profile cd to local settings ( just type cd local settings, it won't show in the  dir list 'cause it's a hidden folder) then go to the temp folder then into the temp internet folder and delete  everything in there and then go up one level and clean out the temp folder. Reboot in normal mode - when the desktop loads, you'll get an error  about can't find c:\program, that's good. Download and install a spyware cleaner ('cause this thing breaks 'em  when it installs) and clean the pc.  So there you go, hope you never need to use this info, but if you  do, you'll be glad to have it. Oh, the symptoms were - strange pop-up windows opening and she couldn't  close them, poor system performance (up to 60% cpu usage with nothing  running!), her search page was re-directed and her home page got changed.
