      Everyday that I jump on my bike and ride through the abandoned wastelands of Detroit I find myself smiling like a toddler riding his bike for the first time. It is my momentary leap into youth even if it is past broken glasses and broken dreams of a city that once was proud and courageous. In its people I see sadness and tears deep in their wells of thoughts. Each building cutting into the sky is a reminder of the dreams that never reached their destination. But for the moment that I am on my bike I look at the world through a child's eye and bid hello to every stranger. It is my small attempt while I am a child to make a difference--to let people know that they are not alone with a friendly hello and a warm smile. My bike journey must end and the reminder of what is left of Detroit comes back quickly. The broken glass, the littered nightmares, and smeared graffiti all paint a landscape that is hard to bear. Every time I stare at this artwork, I am propelled to ride my bike once again and live that dream of a child's life even for a moment....

      So I find myself with less and less time everyday to blog. I am drawn once again to the struggle. Although right now it is not in the same way as it was when I was younger. Right now, I am busy reading about Hindutva, about revolutionary struggles form the past--I am sharpening my intellect. I am determined to create a better world or at least make a contribution to the struggle.  I have been giving thought on where I will be in a few years. I know if things work out, I will have had spent some time in New York and time in S. Asia and the Middle East and possibly a quick stop over in Europe. I am looking forward to the new experiences and adventures that lay in front of me and am anxious to get on with them. Although I have desired peace for long, I am not able to be content with it either. Maybe it is a product of youth or fear of old age, I do not know...  Last night my brother and his friend called and told me they watched Moore's film as well. They told me they cried after the movie because they felt bad for making fun of the activism I have been involved in. It was a wierd feeling hearing him tell me that....  PS  I am not sure if folks are interested in my political commentary... Are folks interested in political stuff? Most of my time is now being spent on that.

      I want to chime in with my own thoughts on Moore's film.  I do agree with Shemon that Moore isn't nearly harsh enough on Democrats who gave Bush unprecedented powers to wage war.  At the same time, the American public is only ready for so much.  And Moore's stated goal is to ensure that Bush does not get a second term in office.  His film (hopefully) works well to that end.    I thought the most powerful part of the film was the sequence with the recruiting officers in Flint.  What assholes!  I remember getting call after call in high school from jerks like that who tried to pretend like they had my best interest in their mind.  Bullshit.  The movie should be seen for that sequence alone.

      I saw Fahrenheit 9-11 as well a couple nights ago. I thought the movie was pretty good but there were some glaring political weaknesses. The easiest one was Moore's softness on the Democrats--the democrats are the reason the war on Iraq and the war on terror have become legitimate. Without the support of the Dems the war could not have happened. It is sad that most people leaving the theatre will end up voting for Kerry--a man who wants to send 40,000 more troops to Iraq and escalate the war on terror--it is reminiscent of LBJ in Vietnam, and we all know the price Americans and Vietnamese civilians paid in that American imperial escapade.  When the movie discussed civil liberties in the US, I also notice that Moore did not mention the discrimination against Muslims and Arabs which really angered me, but then I took a step back and gave him the benefit of the doubt. It seems this movie was geared towards Americans specifically, to say to them: that not only are "other" people being screwed by American policies, but so are YOU. In that framework the movie becomes all the more powerful and relevant. He was appealing to people's self-interest which I can support to an extent. The movie did have an element of internationalism when he showed the carnage in Iraq and the suffering the occupation has caused.    I think the most powerful part of the movie for me was the beginning when members of the House of Rep. could not find one Senator to cosign their statement. I do not know what it will take the American people to see that the current political system has failed, but that was as powerful as any image or moment. Again the role the Democrats played in the Senate is worth paying attention to--they are supposed to be the party of opposition.

      So I saw the Fahrenheit 911 movie last night and it left a tremendous impression upon me. Regardless of your political persuasion, this is one for the ages that I feel may have a greater impact on the November election than people may initially think. This administration has done a masterful job of obfuscating the national debate on Iraq and terrorism by misinformation, and lies, and best-case scenario promises and for the 2 hours I watched this movie I felt that finally, there was some clarity to these issues.   The connections that he makes between the Bush and Saudi family, although not new, are so necessary for the American people to see and understand. What I found especially interesting though was the connection Moore establishes between Hamid Karzai - the President of Afghanistan - and his links to the Kal group, a major US defense contractor. A major criticism I've heard of the film thus far is that Moore himself does not really draw any firm conclusions with respect to the Saudi-Bush-defense contractor links that he draws, but I don't know how much more painfully obvious he can be. Although said to be fought for altruistic reasons to liberate Iraqis and protect Americans, it's extremely clear that 911 was the golden opportunity for the people in power and their friends to make a whole lot of money. And when there is money to be made, those interests typically supercede those of the American and Iraqi people. It's the reason why Haliburton is getting no-bid contracts which is screwing American tax payers out of hundreds of millions of dollars. It's the reason why official body counts of Iraqi casualties have purposefully not been kept by the occupying forces, so we can forget about the actual human toll for American greed. The right has glossed over these types of issues and discredits them on-face as conspiracy theories or as un-American. And that's why i appreciate this movie so much, because it forces us to finally consider the facts seriously.   There was one scene in particular that just sent chills down my spine and made me want to crawl under my seat and hide. It was the one of the Iraqi mother crying because she had lost her family. It was as pure a display of emotion as I have ever scene in a movie and I just couldn't take it. She kept asking why she had to lose her family, cursing in Arabic the United States for what they had done to her family and country. And sitting in my seat i felt so culpable for what had happened to her as if it were me that was personally responsible for the loss of her family, because I am an American. Perhaps if this war had truly been fought for altruistic reasons I wouldn't have felt as bad for her, but really her family died for the benefit of Bush and his cronies and it absolutely frustrates and infuriates me. I guess that's why I hope to one day be involved in the foreign policy decision making apparatus of this country, so that people in America and other countries won't have to suffer for the greed and benefit of the elite of this country.   Or perhaps I’m just delusional in thinking that could ever really happen...

      So Shariq asked me an interesting question: What is an anarchist community?  That is something that I can easily describe over some good coffee, but to explain it in written language is a challenge. It is an important question, and something I want to answer, but the problem is that I am picking up my political work again.   I am involved in an organization called the League for Direct Democracy. We are having our summer conference in three weeks. I am giving a presentation on Hindutva and it's effects in the US. The group is thinking about organizing Desi-Muslims and Hindus against this political movement. But a lot has to be studied because it might not be something that is very useful in mobilizing folks. It takes a lot of my time researching stuff and thinking about its application to US politics. That is why I am not sure if I will be able to put together a good response to Shariq's question.   In one sense the gathering of like-minded folks at this summer conference is what an anarchist community would look like--a community where everyone is working for social and economic justice and the right of people to be self-governing.   Plus I am also working on a grassroots student newspaper called Radical Detroit. We just published our first issue two days ago. Now it is time to start distributing the paper on campus and in the city.  Hopefully in a couple days I will have a coherent statement on what an anarchist community would look like.

      There are moments where I understand the joy of life as if I am on a cliff overlooking the setting sun over an ocean. One of those moments came at my job, where I sat down with two kids--a boy and a girl--who could barely speak English. We worked diligently for two hours on English.   Working with the two kids brought feelings inside of me that have been dormant for a while. I looked at each one of those kids with such care and affection as they tried so hard to learn this new language. They would both comment occasionally in their native tongue-Arabic...  I had a glimpse--a window--into what it means to be a loving teacher who wants the best for all the students that walk through his classrooms. The last time I felt that was probably when I was pre-student teaching in Dearborn. For some reason, I really enjoy working with Muslim students. I can't explain why, but it something I am sure will be bubbling in my thoughts for a while. I left work yesterday with the biggest grin and brightest of hopes.

      I mostly had some random thoughts today:  People use all sorts of reason to justify their belief that God does not exist. One of the reasons is that the idea of a God is used throughout history as something that manipulates people, and so it is better not to believe in God. So then could it be said that since rocks are used at times to kill innocent people it is better not to believe in rocks. At least this line of argumentation that atheists use does not hold.  So this weekend I went to a socialist conference and it inspired me in a weird way--working toward building a community, but not just any community, an anarchist community. They have existed in the past, not too long ago and I would love to have that kind of community in my life. I am going to my organization's conference in a couple of weeks and am very excited to feel a sense of community for at least the weekend. It will be a small gathering of revolutionaries, but at least we will all be sharing a common dream and strategy to achieving that dream.  That is all for today.

      On What is Right:  I am going to speak from a revolutionary anarchist perspective because there is a huge difference between an activist and a rev. anarchist. The reason is because many activsits are liberals with a kind heart which is very different from revolutionaries with a kind heart. Many of the problems you have seen with activism is a derivative of liberal politics which I am opposed to. So from the revolutionary perspective on what is right is dependent on what brings about social and economic justice in the long run. That is the fundamental guiding principle of ethics in revolutionary politics in a sense. I am aware that the sense of rightousness is different between Islam and revolutionary politics and that is an important political difference. For example: revolutionaries are against patriarchy (oppression of women) in its totality meaning that women have the right to have sex with who they chose without the social stigma of being a slut, afterall  men (including Muslim men) have sex with other women and live to brag about it. Women have the right to be independent of men socially and economically. Women should not be in essence forced to take care of children just because the husband wants to work. Women have every right to fullfill their dreams and desires and revolutionaries work to build a world where women are free of legal and societal constraints such as the ones we see in the United States and in other parts of the world. Women control their own bodies and can wear anything they chose to wear without judgement wether it is the hijab or a revealing dress. Women cannot be treated as sexual objects. And from an anarchist perspective these things cannot be decreed from above as laws but need to be argued on the ground level so there is an actual change in people's politics towards the question of patriarchy.   Why these positions? That is probably the next question and a valid one. Because looking at history and seeing how oppressive forces use the oppression of women to advance their own agenda shows that the only way those oppressive forces will be defeated are by the complete liberation of women. You see the actually play out in revolutions (wether national liberation or actual working class revolutions) in Iran, in Palestine, India, European countries, and of course the United States. In all these places, at some time or another, women were told to sit on their demands for social and economic justice and each time women were the first ones to suffer. Women are also told to play subservient roles precisly because they are women and are expected to take care of the kids or are not supposed to do x,y, and z which hurts the struggle for social and economic justice.  Shariq said: But a muslim, is concerned with working to that end, with the absolute knowledge that if he doesnt make the change, it wasnt meant to happen yet.   I do disagree with Shariq on mulitple levels on this statement, especially the last part of the sentence, "it wasnt meant to happen yet." That statement is a trap because it can box in people's thinking into saying that if slavery is still around, black people are not meant to be free and they should accept their role, until God deem's it is their timme to be free. And we actually see oppressed people using that line of thinking that if they are oppressed, then God has wanted it that way.  I also need to mention that I am a strange anarchist in the sense that anarchists generally do not believe in God, and so I am an anomoly since I believe in a higher power. The reason revolutionaries do not believe in God is once again based on how God and religion in general is used to divide people on religious lines, and used to mask the differences between the haves and the have-nots. The latter difference is critical because all Muslims do not have the same interests. The interests of the rich Muslims do not coincide with interests of poor Muslims. Looking at the needs of Canton Muslims and the needs of urban Muslims is a good example. But the one example that really brings out the class difference is the 2000 elections when the majority of Muslims voted for Bush. They voted for him knowing that he would give them a nice tax break and that is where class comes into play. So the Muslims who voted for Bush ignored the plight of poor Muslims in this country and obviuosly the plight of Muslims in Palestine, Iraq, etc etc. (There are a lot of other reasons religion is problematic but I will stop here for the sake of this discussion.)  My viewpoints are biased: they always are in defense of working and poor/ oppressed people. (Everyone has a bias. Anyone that denies their bias is either ignorant of it or lying. Revolutionaries are the first to admit their bias lies with oppressed people.)   So why do I hate cops? We can look at it at two ways. The personal: I have been to countless demonstrations where I have seen peaceful protesters beatup by the police. The police were not there to protect us or anything of that sort. They were there to protect the million dollar buildings and to intimdate people who were dissenting. I have seen and read even more countless stories and accounts of violence on PEACEFUL demonstrators. In Washington DC, I have seen the police with my own eyes encircle hundreds of students, and beat them and then cart them to jail. These were unarmed civilians who were peacefully demonstrating. I have seen the police with my own eyes crack skulls. And of course if people fight back I will defend that right with every ounce of political and physical strength I have. That is one of the reasons activists get burned out because of the intensity of these clashes with the police. The legal consequences they face, the psychological problems, the pyshical pain inflicted on them all take a toll.  I highly recommend that people interested in learning about police brutality and the nature of the police visit some of these websites:  http://sf.indymedia.org/news/2003/11/1658211.php  http://www.refuseandresist.org/police_state/art.php?aid=1273  Notice this picture with head injury and the (most likely) revolutionary covering the face. The police not only are armed with the latest methods to inflict pain, but they also carry camcorders to document who goes to these protests.  http://ftaaimc.org/en/2003/11/1349.shtml  Here is a booklist if you are more interested in the topic: http://www.criticalresistance.org/creast/resources.htm   Lastly, one of the best ways to learn about the theory is to read history. When you look at history in revolutionary periods or times of massive social upheaval, you see the State using the police smashing movements for social and economic justice. This is seen in every part of the world, including the Muslim world, which is something to think about...  (This is why it is absolutely critical that Muslims join some struggle because only then can see how the ruling classes, the police, the army, corporations etc actucally work. Currently most Muslims watch tv or read the newspaper and base their judgements on that which is obviously biased toward the ruling classes. The glaring exception right now is Iraq where the US cannot keep the flow of its own crimes from reaching the media, so although the war was meant to bring democracy, we are now seeing that democracy flourish in the cells of Abuh Gharib.)   The historical viewpoint: history has demonstrated the purpose of the police; they protect the rich and powerful, the state and corporations. Sure poor folks call the police when they are being robbed and that is a contradiction and simply the reality of not having neighborhood committees of safety or something along those lines. But in all progressive movements that we have seen in history, the police plays one role, and that is to crush it by any means necessary. And we also see at certain times sections of the police actually breaking off from the police and joining progressive movements. The political meaning of that is huge because why should the police have to quite their own force if they are not already protecting the poor and oppressed? The implication is that the whole time the police were protecting the rich and powerful and the social movement showed certain sections of the police force who they are really protecting; especially when cops see their hungry mothers or cousins on the other side of the line; of course they are going to join the social movement. Why did the police attack anti-war protesters, protest after protests?  Why does the police use violence to breakup peaceful labor strikes? Who are they serving?  So in the case of Detroit, the police use the excuse that they are protecting peole in the city . How does Islam relate to the police on a political level?  Where is the Islamic position? That is what I mean by Islam and the post-industiral world. I do not believe Islam gives us the tools to understand these things. The police in this country has locked up 2 million people; 25% of the world's prison population with only 5% of the world's population. Who are those people: Mostly minorities. And what are they doing their time for: They are in jail for non-violent drug offenses. Instead of putting them in jail why not treat them instead and help them come back into society? I will not answer all the questions here but some other things to think about are: What are the political reasons and consequences of such incanceration? What affect does it have on the American political landscape? Why do they put so many people away in this country? All these things are not coincidence, but purposeful political calculations by the American elite/ ruling classes. Was Abu Gharib an accident: Af course not, they have been practicing those torture techniques on American prisoners for 200 years--which is well documented. They practice the torture methods on poor Americans in this country and use it in other countries... I will stop with that note...  We should remember George Orwell's words in this time of history that war is peace and peace is war. Many things we see are not what they seem. Where do we get our information from, the mainstream media. Who owns the mainstream media? The rich and powerful. Their interests lie in a stable society and the police insures that stability at all costs.   Lastly, Shariq raised a lot of points and I know I did not answer all them well. I think from now on, I will only reply to only one point at a time just because of time contraints and I would like to go in-depth on whatever issue I talk about. And sorry if things are not as polished; I am in Chicago attending a revolutionary socialist conference.  with respect shemon

      Sorry I am posting a respone to a comment on the main page--blogger is screwing up tonight. But if you want to follow the conv just go to this link http://bol-desi-bol.blogspot.com/2004/06/why-this-now.html#comments.  First, thanks for the interest Shariq, it is greatly appreciated. Also whatever I am going to comment on—I just want to be clear—is with respect. I am going out of my way to say this because the Internet is this weird space where emotions and tone are rarely effectively communicated.   So…..  I am not looking at life and things in general from a Muslim perspective. I stopped a long time ago. I look at everything in life from an Anarchist lens which might seem like we are comparing apples and oranges but is not the case.   Shariq: We know that things happen according to Gods design, and situations wont stop until God wills.  I have always believed God is in the wrong if he has allowed this suffering to take place. That was well before I was an Anarchist and that is one of the reasons I never bought into Islam or other religions. My instincts tell me that is not right. I don’t care if there is a heaven and people will forget their suffering on Earth. You cannot and should not forget the past. That is a putting a veil on our existence. And I know many Muslims always say you cannot possibly understand the reasoning behind God and coincidently that is always their excuse for not doing anything to help others or helping themselves (besides the usual I am going to become a rich doctor). I would much rather burn in hell with revolutionaries who did not believe in God or were not Muslims, then be in heaven with  Muslims who prayed five times a day but did not go on the front lines to fight for social and economic justice.   I think Shariq mentioned one of the reasons why activists burn out, but there are many more. At least in my case, it was due to not taking care of my own personal life and a community that looked down upon what I was doing. Regardless of the importance of doing what one wants without letting the opinions of others effect you, humans are still social beings, and when aunts and uncles and your own parents remind you that you are a fuck up just because you chose to be a teacher in the inner city, you wear your hear long, go to protests, spend time doing political work instead of studying for the MCAT—it really sucks and can be the soil for alienation.  Shariq: A Muslim, on the other hand, isn’t so much concerned with changing the situation as he is with doing what’s right.  Activists are concerned with what is right as well. But most revolutionaries ( I am going to speak from that angle because not all activists are revolutionaries.) base their sense of right on working class politics which is radically different than Islam or other religions. If Islamic morality and sense of right was inspired from the divine, then revolutionary “morality” and a sense of right is derived from the practical social and economic conditions of the day and how it affects working people. I think that is one of the reasons Islam has largely been incompetent in the post-industrial world because it has not been able to understand capitalism and how it works. Also most revolutionaries do not believe in an afterlife or God, so what they have on Earth is everything, so I can understand when they do not see improvement in the conditions of humanity, they burnout.   Regarding alienation:  My alienation from the Muslim community began when I saw that the community’s reputation was more important than having a drug program at the Masjid, when a “respected and wise” brother told me that some things are better hidden. My alienation began when people would only go to Friday prayer and I saw it meant nothing to them. My alienation began when the Imam did not once mention what was happening in Iraq, Palestine, in the United States and demand that Muslims make some sort of fight. My alienation began when I saw the racism of Muslims. I have a very long list.  There was a time when I tried very hard to become a Muslim and I did not find what I was looking for.   My alienation began when Muslims only became doctors for the money. This one is worth commenting upon because a whole array of shady business is derived from this ambition. Muslims basically want all the “western” economic status—they don’t want to be like NIGGERS. That is the driving force of this need to be rich—I would argue it is a general racism towards poor people and especially black people. But Muslims still want the cultural and religious standards. This is one of the reasons many Muslim kids do not buy into Islam because they see the hypocracy all the time--in the Masjid drive way, in the gossip of their mothers, etc etc.   I can honestly say mainstream Islam is used to prop up the neo-liberal policies of the United States Government. Sure I know of some radical Muslims who have dared to live Islam; I am curious to see what their outcome will be.   with respect thanks for your contribution Shariq!

      Anonymous said: As for the girl, dont worry too much bout it. Sometimes things have a way of workin themselves out.We females dont always initiate things which scare us becuase of our own nature that so dearly craves security. She might feel the same way but might need some time to come around. Its kind of the way we work. Hang in there and keep ur head up.   I really thought "anonymous's" thoughts were interesting considering the conlusions I have reached with my lost love. After a lot of thinking and taking long walks, a part of me tells me that it was for the better. I had really lost myself in politics once the war started. I became a political machine with no concern with the beauty of life and to me that is very important because that is one of the things I am fighting for--for humanity to retain its understanding of life's beauty. Losing my love showed me what what I had lost in myself--my own humanity. Something that still bothers to me some extent to this day was when I originally broke up with her. I heard her cry for a hour and then she hung up. After that I kept doing my research on Hindu Nationalism and I do not think that reflects well on my humanity at all.   I have been greedy all my life. I have endulged in all the emotions "God" has given us. I have been green with jealousy, delirious with happiness, and intoxicated with love, filled to the brim with joy, and the same with sadness. If my life was a canvass, it would be covered with all the colors of those emotions and with any painting, too many colors will only confuse the artist to the point of insanity. I have for so long been lucky enough to experience so many emotions that my own canvas is heavy with paint.   Breaking up with my love has given me the time to stare at the canvass of my life and I know how lucky I have been. (I am not sure where I am going with this ramble now... hehe) But I think my point is that whatever happened was for the better. It was a broken heart that has helped me realize my own humanity. My own understanding of love has grown deeper and richer. Whoever I chose to love in the future; I will have more to give them then before. I know my own cup of love has been carved deeper due to my experiences of the last three years and that is why I have no regrets. It will be another journey and I believe that it will be even more beautiful for my lover and myself then it was in my previous relationship. I have learned love is not the end of all things. That it is infact truly a journey in understanding oneself and your partner. In that sense, I have come to understand myself on a more meaninful level and so love has been a powerful teacher for me. I do not know if I am being clear about things.  I would also like to dispell any illusions about myself right now. (This is wierd because I am now engaging in conversations with people who I do not know. It is not just a journal anymore, but a true blog where I am interacting with people over the Internet; another product of my new course.) I do not want to come off as a perfect romantic or lover. I am 100% sure that I hurt my love's feelings in the past and that I disspointed her at times. I know I have committed many sins (from an Islamic perspective) and continue to commit some of those sames sins--drinking, smoking, drugs, endulgence, etc etc. I just do not want to lie about who I am.  I also know that she has made the decision to start fresh herself... ... ...

      I heard on the boat Wet feet splashing And felt faces dusk with hunger My heart a pendulum between her and the street What strength broke me free from her eyes Loose from her arms She stood tears clouding her grief Behind rain and window pane But unable to cry: Wait I'll go with you! - Miguel Otero Silva

      Something which I should be honest about is the act of blogging. I do not see myself blogging indefinitely. I know I am doing it right now because I am not very politically active. I know at a certain point, I will most likely stop due to lack of time and a different focus.   For all the thoughts I have had on life, love, spirituality, peace of mind; I am well aware that the search for those things can be a trap as well, as it is a never ending search. I do not think it is very responsible to spend a whole lifetime solely in search of those things. The reality for me is to reach a point where these urges do not bother me again so I can get back to activism. Of course I will pursue these matters but not to the point where I cannot do research and organize. There is a part of me that is anxious to organize and I am going to try to get back in the swing of things sooner than later.   I do feel that my time in Michigan is numbered. I do not see myself staying here much longer. I am going to do my best to finish school and then do some traveling in the U.S. and in India. I need to get away from everything that has happened the last three years. I took some important steps today in the hopes of leaving Michigan. I will be graduating in December of '04 instead of May '05.   My urge for wanderlust will hopefully be fulfilled over the next years. There is a part of me that says I will not find a community until I understand myself better. I just do not think I can come to terms with myself by staying in Michigan. I need to leave an Indian community that has never respected me or my family. Since neither my mom or dad were a doctor or engineer, they could never one of the gang in the community.  Part 2 coming soon…

      So it is like 2am and I am writing this blog just because I have no one else to share my thoughts with.   Yes the Pistons won tonight!  With that said, I have two things I would like to talk about.  1. Cops 2. A conversation with a friend during halftime.  1. My friend and I drove to downtown Detroit after the game and what angered both of us was how the DPD shutdown all the exists into downtown and even closed some of the main arteries leading into the city. It is one more reason why I hate the police with such a passion. Here was a chance for Detroiters to come together as a city (in the physical sense) and the police did not allow that. That makes me so angry!!! Not only do the police protect the rich and powerful, but now they do not let everyday folks come together in their own city--so much for the land of the free. I will admit after some backstreets we found our way into downtown and found it packed with cars and energy, but little foot traffic considering the Pistons won the NBA Championship. And of course the media was reporting that not much was going on in the city and focused on pleasant Royal Oak.   2.  I had a conversation with a close and very loved friend in New York City. I just wanted to reflect on it because I value the time I get to spend with him--even if it is over the phone. He is someone who I respect and admire for his dedicated work for a better world, as a human being, and as a free spirit, and he is a comrade--an anarchist like me. Our conversation was another reminder of the heavy price so many activists pay for their dedication to a better world. After  years of paying attention to Iraq, civil rights, capitalism, and all sorts of other issues, he--like myself--is paying attention to his needs and is piecing his life together. Do not get me wrong, I do not want to sound as if activism does not have its rewards. Being involved in the struggle has been one of the most beautiful journeys I have known. But it is none-the-less one with its price. Khalil Gibran said it best, "  The deeper that sorrow carves into your being, the more joy you can contain." For all the sadness that has fell upon my friend and myself, it has only carved a larger container for us to hold our happiness in.    I will pray for him tonight that he finds happiness in all the decisions he makes. He has earned it.

      Salutations.  I'm humbled to be a part of such a grand experiment.  There's a lot of wrong and disharmony in the world, a lot of puzzles of life to figure out, and if nothing at all I hope to use this forum to rant and share my various views, as inchorent, unconventional or inconclusive as they may be.   With that being said, I enter my first post:  My love for the Pistons runs deep which is why I've been on pins and needles all day today. Lots of people are Pistons fans nowadays, but I rooted for the pistons since back in the late 80's when the original bad boys had those heated playoff matchups with Jordan and the Bulls...this while living in Chicago. I actually watched the games when the Pistons dawned those nasty teal jerseys with Grant Long as our starting power forward and still remember what I was doing the day we lost Alan Houston and Grant Hill. So for me, tonight is kinda like the night I lost my virginity and prom night and the first night of college...well, not really, but you get my drift.  And I know how sports works. Just when you think you can dot your t's and cross your i's, conventional wisdom gets turned upsidedown and events akin to the splitting of the red sea seem to take place. Pistons fans got a taste of it in Game 2, which is why I fear that if the jugular is not fully severed tonight and LA wins, we could be in for a long and painful series. And it is Los Angeles, and if disney has taught us anything, its that miracles can happen and that animals can actually talk. Ultimately though I think that the Pistons as a team are noticably better and more cohesive as a unit, which is why i think they'll pull it off tonight. Being up 3-1 I think the pressure is now more so on Detroit, because history indicates that they are suddenly the favorites in the series now, so it will be interesting to see how they play.   All this Pistons success though begs the question, where is Hammer?   That's all i got for now.

      So one of the creative actions that I am planning on doing is to write creative poems about life and love around campus. I plan on doing it under the penname of Brown Chenee (Brown Sugar). Since I am not into my hardcore political frame of mind right now, and am more reflective about life, I think I should share those thoughts with people. It is an experiment to see what kind of difference it will make. After all taking back public space from the university or corporations is an important part of the anti-globalization movement.  Here are some of the poems I am thinking about chalking:  Like a dying rose so too will pain wilt away. Clean rains will moisten the heart's hunger. Red Roses of Love will bloom again. Pain's ashes become a new desire's fertilizer. Blacker the ash... Redder the Rose...  Here is another one:  Lost in my thoughts, Swimming in my past, Dream's desires are a painful fire.  And another one:  Have you ever felt black rain? It only pours when lover's hearts are torn asunder. Lust and fate take all they can plunder. Rumblings of heartache's thunder, No rhyme can fix the heart's broken blunder.  And the last one for today:  When i talk to you, all i can think of is how true my feelings are for you.  When i look at you, what i hear, is something that takes away my fears.  In those echoes of my heart, lays the truth of you.  Behind each beat awaits something for you.  All i can do, is ask you to brush aside the curtains of my soul, and look inside.  I could not help myself with one more:  The present has no meaning for me. My thoughts, heart, and dreams are in the past dreaming of her. All that is left of me in the now is my skin, bones, and flesh. I am yesterday trapped in the living body of tomorrow.  ----   So some of these poems I do not think really belong to me as their inspiration rests in the soil of the love I had. I suppose if I represent a flower (or a weed depending if you like the poem), she would be the gardener. If those words were buried inside of me, then it was her love and care that brought them to the surface. (And obviously the poems reflect different emotions at different times in my life.)  So back to this chalking experiment, I have no idea what affect it will have on the campus if any. But I would like to think it would inspire other lovers to look deeper into their relationships and to take joy in their love as well. I am sure if I keep doing this, some of the poems will be political as well, although the one political poem I did a year ago on Palestine, I thought at least, was awful so maybe I will keep those poems in my head J

      It is driving me insane. I am skimming  urlLink Haaretz  and watching what is happening in Israel: the final phases of trapping the Palestinians in Bantustans and yet I cannot manage to delve into the articles and analyze the material like I normally would.   I would like to think I have worked everything out in my head and heart, but things keep popping up--images and memories and feelings which I cannot throw out like a deck of cards. The truth is I am not a political machine like I thought I was. I am flesh and blood with a beating heart that also loves and longs for company--I am human. As silly as it sounds, in my younger days I thought I could transcend those petty mortal qualities but I cannot. I am also learning that it is not a crime to be human either--that I am allowed to relax and unwind even though I am constantly tormented by the injustices I see in this world.  I had my first day of work in a week. I am working in Hamtramck, which is this city composed of Yemeni, Polish, Bangladeshi, and African American folks. I went to the training site which was near the American Axle Plant and it was a reminder how urban children are robbed of many things that suburbanites take for granted. Watching the kids play in the concrete jungle with a pollution spewing factory is a reminder of the failures of this society and capitalism in general. Here are my thoughts from sometime ago. Although the article was originally written for the South End, it has ended up on a Columbia server:  urlLink My students will not sing the National Anthem.   And how could I not mention, being a Detroiter and all that the Pistons are playing for the NBA Championship tonight. What I get a kick out of is seeing all these folks talk about the love for Detroit yet most of them could care less about the population or do even less to help the people in the city. It is true that sports have turned many black athletes into sheer zoo animals. As long as they perform they are accepted. Of course if they dare to speak their mind on social or economic issues they would be bad entertainers.   I am curious to see what happens tonight. I hope there is no rioting because Detroit is not a city that needs it, unless of course people take their rioting to the yuppie neighborhoods of Troy, Canton, Bloomfield Hills etc. I could support that and partake in it as well. However I do not see that happening and nor do I see the rioting having any other face than mostly a mad drunken stupor. I am sorry to disappoint my radical friends, but it will probably not turn into an anti-war or anti-capitalist riot no matter how much I or other radicals want it to.   Besides this romanticization with riots is not good politics. Rioting I think is the expression of the disorganized. When people have not been organized and they reach a certain boiling point they riot. They have no clear voice other than random acts of violence. I do think militant action has its time and place, but it would certainly not look like rioting. In the end, I hope tonight is a peaceful night where people can escape from the terrible problems that lingering in Detroit.  Hopefully tonight I will catch a bit of the game and stare at the stars as well--that would be a good night!

      Is it just me or have there actually been more people of South Asian descent on television?  I'm especially noticing this in television commercials.  For example, there is an ad for some chewing gum with a South Asian (looking) guy and a White woman making sexy talk about chewing gum.  We're on the fast track now!

      I think this small ramble explains why I write so much best:  I have given much thought to life. I don't have much wealth or beauty or pride to show. All I have are my thoughts on life.  My thoughts are something that I have "invested" a lot of my time and energy over the years. They are the only solace I find in times of distress which I find myself in quiet often. Especially after reading books like Siddhartha, The Alchemist, and The Prophet; I realize the importance of thinking things through and understanding sequences of events which are sometimes called life depending on who you are talking to.   I have come to learn to that we cannot understand everything that happens in our life. That somethings are beyond our comprehension and we must settle with not knowing why this or that happened. As painful as that can be, it is also the beauty of life in that humanity has not solved everything there is to know through mathematical equations and scientific formulas. If that ever happened I imagine life would be awfully boring and sold as text books for every person to decipher.   Although I am pulled to get back to my political work once again, there is a part of me that is resisting with all its might. I suppose it can be described as the battle between responsibility and nostalgia (I am not sure if nostalgia is the correct word, perhaps it is simply heartache.). I am anxious to get back to organizing but I am preoccupied with myself most of the time, reflecting what has happened over the last three years, thinking about her and what life will be like for her in the years ahead. And to be honest I am afraid too, for I do not know what life will be like for me. So many plans and a world centered around her and I is now just left with me which is a lonely feeling.   Then there is the part of accepting the fact that this has happened to countless men and women--broken hearts/ lost loves. It is partly my own fault for feeling the way I do. I am too idealistic and romantic about my life--wanting everything to be tale for the ages. I need to learn that all lifes, including my own are amazing adventures regardless of what happens. But I have conditioned myself to expect the unexpected and the unbelievable, and now I am paying the price for it. I have told this myself many times before but have yet to understand my own words (which shows how far from being wise I am):I have come to value so much again that I had forgotten in my political/ activist days. In the rush to stop two wars--one against Afghanistan and the other Iraq, I forgot all the details of life.... Before I go any further, I think that the following will explain things much better than anything I can write. For whatever I am writing right now is from my heart's memory.   Instead I will post something I chalked for this girl on the campus she goes to. It explains things much better. The point is that for me, my life took this path of love to show me how important everyday events were as well, the trivial things like finding happiness in doing the dishes or cooking dinner, or doing laundry--that is one thing that touched my heart when I met this girl was her joy for life which I have not seen in anyone else. It was something special which I do not know if I will find again... so anyways here is what I chalked.  Once upon a time there was a girl and a boy  They were both lonely  They were both young and looking for someone who could understand them  As fate would have it, this boy and girl would meet on this very campus  At first they were both shy and would meet once in a while to talk about life, family, and their dreams  As time went on the boy and the girl would talk every night   As the days turned into weeks and the weeks into months the boy realized how beautiful and amazing the girl was  She would make him laugh and she would bring out the best in him  The girl found herself realizing the same things  They would meet at cafes and would talk for hours and would look into each other’s eyes with a longing that neither have felt before  The boy would look into the girl’s beautiful eyes and it would speak to him of a world that he wanted to live in   The two would spend hours talking to each other, learning all the details about each other’s wants, desires, and dreams till the crack of dawn  They would share in each other’s fears and hopes…  In their conversations they found a flame that never existed before..  They found love of a type that transcended anything they knew before…  One summer night, also a long time ago…  The boy told the girl he loved her while they were sitting on a park bench.   It was a perfect night..  The reflection of the stars were on the lake and their dreams were painted in the night sky. The wind played music with the girls hair and the stars danced in her eyes.  They boy knew that night this is the person he wanted to live the rest of his life with  The girl said nothing that night to the boy But days later she too, in a letter the boy still holds dear, told him about her love for him  He remembers the first lines of the letter:  “You are the sparkle in my eyes, the shine in my hair, the life in my breath…it is your voice that I hear in the whispers of the wind…”  And they both made vows never to leave other’s side no matter what happened—both knew that long and difficult days were ahead.. both knew many things in the world did not want them together…  But they dared to love one another no matter what the price… even if it would be their own hearts…  The boy and the girl found themselves in a love and in a world that escaped all the horrors of this violent place we call earth  They shared in each others happiness  Borrowing one other’s happiness in times of sadness  Time would go on and the ever growing world watched as the boy and the girl fell deeper in love and vowed to love one another till the end of time…  But sometimes the world is crueler than the saddest pictures of hunger…  The world became jealous of such love… and began a plot to tear their love apart…  Wars were made and a mother’s love was lost  And the boy found himself drawn into the sadness and violence of the world…  He fought to make a small difference, hoping to stop such violence and sadness….  He fought everyday… with both eyes on the world… as it bled in the day and wept at night…as children went hungry… and women lost their children… and fathers their families…  The boy found himself lost in this world trying to help everyone he could running away from his own sadness  In the meantime the girl found herself growing further away from the boy  The boy did not know.. and could never tell at times.. for he was lost himself for a long time… even the callings of his love were not loud enough on the what appeared to be the deaf boy..  He always thought the only world to fight for was the “out there,” never realizing that the world in his heart was just as important  Over the course of months and months the boy and girl tried so very hard to fix things…  But the relentless world would not stop with its plot..  It kept plotting and conniving to keep the two apart  First with the girl’s family who hated and despised the boy for all that he was  And then with the community that did not understand their love  And then the saddest moments happened when the boy’s mother passed away…  Instead of finding solace in their love, the boy ran to fight all his demons against the world…  The boy forgot the most important thing of all… their love… and left it in the hands of the girl…  She did her best to carry the burdens of two loves in her heart.. but she was only a mortal… and time would take its toll…  Eventually she too would falter.. .as the boy did long ago…  No one is strong enough to carry the their own heart and another’s, even if it is their loved ones…  After some time the boy and the girl went their own ways… deciding that neither could endure the heartaches anymore  At first the boy did not understand… even as he listened to the tears of the girl  But as time went on… the boy realized what he had lost…  Not just his love… but his dreams and his hopes… his commitments and his vows.. his happiness and his sadness… he had lost his love….  But the boy could not forget what this girl meant to him… and promised himself not to give up so easily…  The boy learned much about himself while he was alone..  He learned how much he loved this girl and what he would do for her… how he would love her… and much he wanted to love her again.. and crown her his princess again…be her pagla again.. if only she would let him  The boy learned he could not save the world, if he could not save his own heart…  The boy felt inside the girl still loved him but was only scared of what might once again be a broken heart.  Inside the boy knew this time that he would give everything for this girl and be happy… if only the girl could see his heart…  The boy found himself longing for the girl’s love again… for her companionship… and her care.. her smile… her smile and her honesty… her happiness and her sadness… for all her perfections and imperfections built like a queen  The boy knew the girl needed some time on her own and he was willing to wait.. but he wanted to let the girl know that his heart is still hers and that he would wait for the girl to return it to him if she ever wanted to see the boy again…  The boy knows how brave the girl has been in the past… and he asks her to be that brave once again so he can take care of all the hurts he has caused her heart… and so they can forget those hearts and live their dreams together…  The boy used to chalk to stop a war and now the boy chalks to stop the love of his life from leaving forever…   --------------------------------------------------- And since I am a (bad) poet, I am gonna throw in my poems in this blog to, so for anyone that is reading this, they are gonna have to suffer through them.  I have seen and felt many things. I have felt flowers on my fingertips and thorns in my heart. I have seen darkness in man's heart and the dawn of beauty. I have felt the sun on my face and its burning fire in my passions. ...  ---------------------------------------------------  I feel I don't have to carry the weight of my thoughts on my shoulder after I blog...

      Ok, so I'm very quickly beginning to realize that I might not have  quite  as much to say as Shemon, but regardless I'm going to keep at it.  This attempt at community is important to me because although I have always recognized the fundamental  sense  of aloneness that comes along with trying to live differently, I now realize that it does not  have  to be that way.  Each day of living differently is filled with insecurity.  I've been enormously lucky that I have people around me who are willing to reveal their personal struggles and make me feel less alone.  Until this point in time, I've been rather reluctant to reveal what I personally am struggling with.  But the sense of community that I desire will only come when I put everything out there and hope for the best.  It's gonna be tough, but I'm going to try.

      I feel I have so much to say. It is rare when we can have a conversation even among friends that moves our spirit or creates new dreams. Most of the time we are stuck in the swamp of the mundane or trivial. Although both have their importance’s in life, the essence of life is lost when we are trapped in that swamp. Right now in my life, my soul thirsts for new dreams and thirsts for tranquility. Foolishly I have sought that in others for many years, but the reality is, it is only in myself that I have any chance of finding it. But introspection is a deadly game that can lead one to becoming an introvert, insane or (the other side of the coin) one can blossom into what their soul truly wants to express which I imagine is fulfilling one’s dreams.  I have been a private person most of my life. Locking most of my thoughts between my two ears as I found few receptive to the questions I had and things I had to say. But between going insane with too many thoughts in my head and taking the chance on a lame blog; I opted for the latter. Eventually my sanity and search for peace has led me to this of all places. Why? The answer will only unfold over time. It brings a smile that I can share a part of myself that has been locked up for so long.   I have been debating whether to put my journal on the blog. Partly out of curiosity: to see the response of others, to see if others think like I do, and to release the maelstrom inside of me. I have written over a thousand pages in the last four years covering college, drugs, jail, death, adventure, and love and I am tired of burying all my emotions in my own soil. I almost think if I plant them on the Internet, they will grow. But into what, I do not know.  I have a feeling I will be writing often for sometime on this blog....

      So after talking to Samip, I realized how I lack a community and probably never have had one where I felt politically or spiritually close to. Sure I have felt emotionally close to them, but the other two components are missing. At least in my attempt to find some place of belonging, I have turned to the Internet for now. It is a sad reflection of the world where people who desire inner peace and social and economic justice have nowhere to go--not their local communities and not even progressive circles to find solace.  I do not know where this blog will lead, but I do know for now that this is the medium I have chosen to express my thoughts and emotions. No longer are they solely political as they have been for so long (Check www.southend.wayne.edu if you want to see my political stuff. I was a columnist from 2002 to March of 04 when I resigned over a freedom of speech issue).   I do hope this blog helps other desis who are lost in their own communities and are not content with the American Dream, or should I say Desi Dream of becoming a doctor (money printing maching), reproducing, and dying. I would like to think there is more to life than those three acts.   Now I find myself single, without my love of three years, where so many of our plans for the future were spelled out. It is a painful lesson not to plan everything in life because things don't fall exactly where we want. But in this new "life" I hope to pursue many of the non-political dreams I had. Hopefully, politics will always be around the corner, as I am tired of seeing the hunger and the death, and am tired of being a victim of this society's downfalls as well. Hopefully in a better world, wanderers, strangers, odd-balls--call us whatever you like--will no longer have to dwell in cyberspace, but be able to walk freely with happiness

      I guess I wanted to say two things.  1. I went rollerskating with the kids at work today. It was soo much fun. I fell down like a hundred times and of course the kids laughed and made fun of me. Regardless, I loved being with them and seeing them smile for the whole time. I think they finally had a chance to be kids; away from the pollution and psyhological pain of home and the city. I fall in love with them in different ways every single day....  2. I was reading Anon 1's post and I just wanted to make a comment on the trivial moments and things of life. I do not think think there is much in life that is trivial, whether it is washing dishes, cleaning the toilet, or the shoes a person wears. I think these things add up to make the world a better place. It is just that people like me have been consumed in our rage and anger at the bad things in the world and that drives us to almost insane limits to change things. I think in our firey passions we burn the very roses and dreams that we want to build in a better society. That is why I think it is the people who remembered the trivial things that will be critical in reconstructing a better world after the "Big R" (revolution)... hehe  It will be there sense of humanity, laughter, and tears that will be the foundations of a better society. I believe that with all my heart. I know a lot of revolutionaries would laugh at me for believing such a thing, but I do not want to live in a cold world where it is too trivial to laugh to silly jokes and silly bloopers. Those things are what I fight for every single day... And it is those things that I try so very hard to make time for. It especially becomes important when dealing with family. I know in the past I did not treat my grandma good. Everything was too important except for her, but now I try always always to smile and listen and be patient when she needs a few more minutes and I revel in joy in those moments when I can be in wonder at how life proceeds.... so let us not discard the trivial things... in life...  lol :)

      So last night was strange. I hung out with a friend around midnight. We can call her Joe. Joe was telling talking about my brother and some of the problems he is going through. She was telling me how isolated he feels from Indian folks right now and how he feels he is wasting his time in everything he is doing. We talked for a long time and I just listened. I was kind of surprised but more worried then anything else. I have been where he is at and it is not a particularly fun place. I need to talk to him and understand exactly what is happening.   It is strange... everything that is happening as if the Indian community is drawing me in, but this time by the call for struggle...   -------------------   Lots of anxiety today.. thinking about my brother, about my mom, and...   I was reading a piece from "Our Feet Walk the Sky," and it made me sad because it was about a wedding and it was clear the importance of a mother in such an event. I wish Mom could come back even for a day or two take part in my wedding or my brothers, but she will never do that. I miss her so much. She really kept the family together and she was really strong. I could wish so many things right now that I did when she was alive, but it is too late. It makes me sad knowing that I will have to spend the rest of my life without her.   I have been clouded with a&nbsp;lot of emotions lately, but have forced them down because I have my pamphlet due at the end of August and there is tons of works that still needs to be done. I can't spend time away from political work like I did in June. It is hard. Sometimes it feels like someone is rubbing sandpaper on my heart and soul and I just have to grind my teeth and bear and go through with the work that needs to be done.   I dont know what kind of person will result from that kind of self-torture. I imagine it is not a healthy or good process, but I really do not see a way out.   Everything inside my head is a jumbled&nbsp;mess. I cant even write my thoughts down very clearly...The only time I can focus is on political work and it takes an iron will to do that.............. ...   Working on this pamphlet with a focus on patriarchy has been very difficult. So many painful memories that are close to the heart are surfacing, but I feel my best political writing is coming out of that pain and I owe it to so many young Desis and Muslims whom it might help... There is a part of me that cannot wait for it to be done. I do not know if I have the strength... to do this pamphlet... I can only pray to God that he/she grants it to me...

      So I am posting the rough rough rough draft of the pamphlet on patriarchy. I was supposed to do it on Hindutva but fate, life, God, my past (call it what you will) compelled me to start writing on this. I have found that in a matter of days I have been able to put this together compared to what it took months of research to put a few pages of the Hindutva pamphlet.  Of course I am still going to do some research on patriarchy, but the meat of the pamphlet will hopefully be an organic piece that young Desis can relate to one level or another. Obviously it has a lot problems—grammar, sentence structure, some of the thoughts end abruptly, some of the paragraphs are out of order the politics might even by unclear, but I will fix it. For example, the context of Islam there is are a lot of good/radical views that can help women and young men understand how badly patriarchy sucks, and in effect be used to fight patriarchal practices ( I think I will use Islamic texts in the pamphlet to fight patriarchy), I just want this in my journal….  Another part of me wants to email my old love and ask for her help. She is the only person on the plant that can complete this piece. I know how class, family, tradition, patriarchy, the war affected me and our relationship, but I cannot be sure how these things affected her and only she can provide that insight….   I will not post for a couple days cuz this post is gonna be lengthy…  I am reminded of what Frantz Fanon said ( I will paraphrase it) &nbsp;Each new generation has to decide if it will betray the struggles of the past generation…or continue the struggle..  -----  I was in love for three years with a Desi woman that I believed I would spend the rest of my life with. In those years I experienced struggle, love, joy, and sadness and it is those years which have helped me develop an understanding of what it is like to be a woman in the Desi-Muslim community. In understanding our love and the reasons we went our separate ways I have come to conclusions that shape my views on the problems of the community. Not only are my views theoretical on some level, but they are also grounded on the practical day to day struggles her and I had to endure under her parent’s watchful eyes and the community’s hypocritical moralisms. I do not regret what transpired between her and I, for the knowledge and wisdom that journey parted on my, I hope to part to others in an attempt to create a world where women and men in our community will never have to endure the trials we were put through. It is the most personal and meaningful political discoveries that have come upon me thanks to life’s taughtful methods of pain and joy. In the following pages, are the conclusions that I have reached after thinking for months about what divided our love.  I cannot speak from a women’s perspective nor write this pamphlet from that perspective. I can speak of the experiences I have had and the conclusions I have reached watching women being treated like steak, ground beef, or pork to be sold to the highest bidder in the Desi community. Not only have I seen women treated in such a manner, I have had my own partner treated in such a way by her parents. Not only did it affect her, psychologically, but it also affected our relationship and myself. I will leave it for other women to speak about how patriarchal behavior affects women. I will discuss how patriarchal behavior affected our relationship and myself.  All of us have felt the knot in our stomach whether male or female when our parents measure as not a total human being: the compilation of our success, failures, our tears and joys, and our dreams and nightmares. We have all felt the our dreams trapped in our parent’s ambitions for us to become doctors or engineers. And some of us have let our parent’s trap define the outlines of our life. Others how ever have broken that box and have been left alone to pick up the shattered pieces and make sense to what was our families. This essay will attempt to give direction to those shattered pieces and reassemble them in a way that projects a world were all of us can live our own dreams with the acceptance of our parents. By no means is the path this world easy, but I would argue that not only do we owe it to our selves, the shattered pieces, but to the unborn children in the Desi community so they will not have to ponder who to break out of their parent’s dreams oneday as well.  Going to a Desi wedding is an interesting experience. It is similar to going to a friend’s stock broker or financial manager. If you probe deep enough into the marriage you will often find that love was not the reason the two were married, but a financial accommodation. TO be more precise, the man was a doctor and the girl was light-skinnned, not touched, and beautiful. Sometimes it can work the other way too, where the girl is in a more powerful economic position but that does not happened too often. What is usually the case when the girl is a doctor is that she is married to someone else who is a doctor.  I don’t have any disagreements with doctors marrying doctors or engineers etc etc, but what I do rebel against is the fact that many of these kids circumvented their ambitions just to make their parents happy and this is one of the places where I have my differences. Our dreams belong to us and not our parents to toy and tinker with. It is their fault that they cannot accept our desires and whims. The obvious argument is of course that our parents know what is best for us. I could not disagree more. I have listened to these parents and seen what they base good character and values on. The look to see if the man or woman is a doctor and if the family comes from an economically stable background. They base their judgment from formal family functions and events where everyone that comes is putting on a show, for what else is a wedding, or birthday party in the Indian community than a place for our parents to look for possible mates for us in the future.   It is when we feel this sting, when our parents tell it is better to become a doctor that we have to make that decision of living upto our dreams or abandoning them. It is a defining point in our lives because I belive it represents our character and projects it in our future actions. Will we forever conform to what is wrong in life or will we have the continued courage to stand up for what is right and to make that fight no matter what the cost.  The socio-human relations that are created when parents impose their dreams or ambitions between us and parent becomes perverted and affects both in different and similar manners. My partner’s parents could not see her other than a cum dumpster for a rich man to deposit his seeds of germination. They could only see her as a way of continuing the family line. They could only see her as an object to be married off to the highest bidder and the knew these bidders over formal get together and visits. They could never know what these young men thought when they were not around or how they behaved in the presence of peers. They only knew the show that young Desis put on in front of their relatives—the great circuis that has become our lives because we have not dared to be forthcoming that we are no longer the product of our parents and India, Pakistan, or Bangladesh, but the products of something far more complex. Not only are we created by the new cultural forces that our parents cannot grasp such as hip-hop, mass media, Bollywood, academia, but also forces from the past that have been purposely forgotten.  The identity of the Desi-Muslim is constructed in such a manner that we are led to believe that we can only be doctors or engineer and everything else falls short of what a true Desi should be. The reality is however that we are more than either of those two occupations. The proof is in the working class communities that are in Chicago, New York, and Hamtramck. These communities defy the stereotypical Desi identity.   Marriage  I have been to countless….  Conclusion In reading day to day struggles of S. Asian women, I noticed that many of them ended in defeat and in those readings I reflected on my own struggles against this form of oppression and came the conclusion that in the simplest of analysis, my own separation with my old love was a defeat by more powerful forces such as patriarchy, tradition, and _________.   One of the biggest problems I noticed in the struggles of the women and of men is that even after success, we rarely consolidate them and reflect on them, and more importantly rarely do the manifest themselves into an organizational form that challenges what oppressed us directly. We let our struggle remain buried in the personal and not let it transform it into a broader political and organizational struggle.  When I was reading “Alone and Exploited,” I realized that the varying expressions that resistance and self-management can take and yet it is overlooked by women. In this story a young women…. But it is her ability to manage her own affairs, especially financially that break the other contradictions such as her psyhocological shackles to her husband and fears of breaking tradition that set her free. Although it is not clear what this woman will do at the end of the story, it is obvious that in her struggle to have a better life for her husband and her life….  I have also learned about relationships that they at no point are they perfect and to expect a man or woman to behave in that manner is unfair. What can be expected is that each be vigilant in demanding the most egalitarian relationship possible. There were times where I know I was patriarchal toward her, but if there is one political residue that I know I left with her was to constantly challenge anything I said and it is that which she did. And if some of her final words before we broke up are true then it was my overbearing and political aggressiveneness that led to the breakup as well.   It is true that coming to this country have altered the form patriarchy takes place. Generally women are not told to stop their education after high school. Some of the old forms of oppression are blunted because of the economic realities of this country. Some of the old forms of oppression persist and create painful experiences that are either leave the woman with a sense of empowerment or continued defeat.   For example, my partner was never told not to go to college, but she always had on her mind what kind of career  Although I am left to do this pamplet alone now and not without my partner, I believe it is critical that I analyze the past and reflect and politicize the most personal, joyous, and painful experiences of my life because I believe that many other young Desis are living exactly what her and I vhea lived. Although we could not overcome the forces against us, both of us walked away as fuller and deeper human beings able to hold more joy and sadness because of the experiences our love had carved into us.   “Our Feet Walk the Sky”  Some of the stories I have read remind me how brave my partner was and will hopefully continue to be. I have read some stories were young Desi woman told their heart desires to leave their life because of the disappointment their parents would have int heir selection of a life partner. Some have told me that my partner was weak for not fully standing up to her parents for me. But I have realize that she fought that in her own ways and I know how it tore her life into shred in making those fights. I wanted her to completely abandon her parents and walk away from her family because they could not accepot her heart’s choice. She could not make that decision and I belive that it was the right path. She had to make such a fight in her family.   Family We cannot abandon our family and the extended community that exists. It is our space and our right to assert ideas that are different from tradition that we do not agree with. Without a doubt it is a painful experience for it brings up things we do not want to talk about. The way our fathers treat our mothers, the way our brothers get away with more than our sisters—the list is long…  Perhaps the greatest legacy of tradition and patriarchy is the chastity of women and there one aspect which manifested itself during and after my love and I broke up which I would like to talk about.   …. After we broke up, she was forced to remind me that I should never mention what happened between her and I to anyone. I had to give back everything of ours, photos, clothes, and even the memories that I loved. It is a strange sense of violation to have one’s memory purposely erased for the sake of convenience. Of course to some extent it is for her convenience, but the root of the problem is not her but so much as the mentality in the Desi community that girls should be pure and not touched. If my love’s identity was ever discovered and all our intimate nights revealed, then she should surely die a widow. I feel this is a crime not only to her, but to my own sense of who I am….  Did she think about and reflect on our relationship after we broke up, or was her first task to erase all files titled “Shemon?” I do not know. I know I spent months reflecting on our relationship and trying to make sense of it and I continue to do so today recognizing that in one sense it was one of the most important political fights in my life. Although at the time I never recognized it as such, but I know we were always up against a variety of forces. It just happened that our relationship found its troubled days when the war on Iraq was impending and my own gaze was not on my heart, but on the impending destruction of a whole nation. And that it has changed me in ways more than the anti-war movement, antir-racist struggles, or the Palestine solidarity movement ever did. &nbsp;Will she ever share our love with her future husband? With her children? In what ways is she denying her own human existence and experiences? In what ways is she limiting her own self-development spiritually, emotionally, and intellectually? I cannot know the answers to these questions because I am not her and I also have taken a completely different route so to even speculate would be conjecture. Will I be erased completely from existence?

      I have started reading "Our Feet Walk the Sky." It is an collection of works written by all sorts ofwomen of the S. Asian Diaspora. It is one of the most insightful, touching, and heart-felt political books I have read. All of the pieces in the book are true experiences of women struggling against all sorts of issues in the context of the S. Asian community. The first short piece was about a young Muslim girl whose father had two wives. It was tormenting for me to read of the pain she went through...   Other pieces talk about rape, spousal abuse, psychological abuse, some talk about defying the odds and winning against the community--all are a testament to the monster that is patriarchy. I am not sure why this has touched me so much. Maybe because I was involved in the fight against patriarchy with my old love and it is fight that is close to the heart. Maybe the stories of these women bring back my own memories of fighting my parents, running away from home, drugs, jail--the trauma and the experiences that follow such risks and which I have a bond with these women who I have never met.   It has even changing the way I want to write the Hindutva pamphlet I have been working on all summer. The pamphlet is due at the end of August and in some ways I still do not know its precise direction and meaning… There is so much I have to say to young Desis…   Don’t stop fighting for your dreams…  Don’t stop loving yourselves and your own ambitions…  But don’t loose sight of your community…  I will stop because… because… I feel the tears of yesterday’s memories inside of me that remind me of my past and I look back at with aged eyes…   I think I will share bits and pieces of the book in my journal because the readings because I feel the sadness of this book on my face and smile.   I liked on the lines in the first poem...&nbsp; the poem is by Gaurangi Kamani   I was the rain of Surat  You were the Rajput Rock   ------------------------------------   Another piece titled Parvati by Natasha Pratap...   I am reading it right now and am happy I can write down my feelings. It is the tale of a very poor but courageous women whose husband is a drunk. She is trying to raise a child, however she cannot send him to school for financial reasons. She teaches him as much as she can, but more importantly she constantly teaches him with love the importance of being honest and good. This woman, Parvati cleans people's bathrooms.    I will also put up what I have written regarding patriarchy in the Desi community tomorrow… I want to have that in my journal because it has not just been a political fight for me, for it was also wrapped with memories of my old love and what we fought and dreamt for… It was fight to save my own heart and dreams…

      So I went to my cousin's graduation tonight and I saw my old love.I will have to admit she looked more beautiful than ever and it tested my abilities to stay focus on what I have committed my life to. I just brought a reminder of deep sadness to me... that... is difficult to describe. I feel this mountain of emotions and love inside of me and it yearns to release itself all the time. Many times I can contain it but at other times it erupts and floods my consciouness. With her I found an outlet for this and she absorbed all the love I had to give. With that said I find that my well of love is deeper than I could have ever imagined and I thirst for my new love to draw those waters again. I thirst for that feeling and that dream of love which is no longer part of me life. I wait for the moment when I will find it once again so I can see what waters are drawn. I do not know who will draw my love's well in the future, but I am anxious for that coming of the day. Until that day comes I know a part of me will always be wanting for someone...   Late at night, it is an odd feeling of "alone-ness" that I find myself bathed in. It is indiscribable in many ways. Of accepting what has come to pass and realizing the events in my life that have unfolded the way they have had a deeper meaning than I would have known previously. My thoughts are entangled in my emotions and memories and so my thoughts are muddled at best,but in these moments I find myself; and must find myself in the hope that somewhere in this world there is someone who will draw my water's well.  I do not know for how long I can allow my well to be undrawn for I can feel that the water level rises every day and I do not know what will happen when it will overflow. What will happen only the future and fate will reveal to me. For now, I keep my eyes set on a better world and a dream--in these thoughts I hope I can find the love of my life once again, whoever and wherevershe is... I wait for her...  125 am  I am not a political robot...a machine... I have come to learn my own humanity in the course of a broken heart and that is the greatest lesson the love I have had and lost taught me. It is that which is buried inside of me and reaffirms the existence of my being and life. I have emotions that swell deep in my heart and run deeper in my words. It is a reminder of all the blessings that God has given me,in joy and in sadness he/ she has made me who I am...  145am  there is a part of me that says it is time to close this journey and stop blogging. i do not know why...as if i am ready... to move on... but to what...  I feel that the person who I will fall in love will have to be someone who was born in the struggle like the way I was forged and carved in the struggle for a better world.When the experiences of violent protests, politics, massive rallies mark our humanity,it is on a profound level that is only comparable to the witnessing of birth and death itself.Only someone who has felt the pains of struggle can possibly understand what I have went through and what and why I am willing to go through in the future. Only she can fit my in a manner that will complete both us...  212am  tonight my emotions and thoughts sweat as if they are in the amazon jungle. drenched in my own energy and thoughts of the present and future. political ideas buzzing pass my mind and dreams racing through my heart i cannot fall asleep no matterhow badly body desires it so...

      So here is where having a blog comes in handy.  I was wondering what other Muslim folks reading the two articles I posted thought. I think it is an important issue and possibly will come to be an imoprtant development in the larger American Muslim community and so I am asking...  &nbsp;

      Here are two articles on the powerful role women are playing in the Islamic community in the USA. It is too early to tell if this will develop into more than just sporadic resistance to injustice inside the Muslim community, but without a doubt I think these two articles represent the sentiment of a lot of women in the Muslim community. What I am thinking&nbsp;might, might, happen in the next decade is a resistance to the corruption of Islamic clergy and the Muslim community as a whole, especially the hypocrisy. This is what Islam is about... hehe  urlLink Muslim Women Seeking a Place in the Mosque    urlLink Woman's Mosque Protest Brings Furor in the U.S.

      It is amazing to have the friendship of someone who you can be yourself with. Rarely does one meet such a person in life. My short ode to Hawra.  &nbsp;  A while ago, anonymous asked when and why I got involved in activism. I always enjoy sharing this story with others cuz it is a testament to how even dorky people can involved in something so amazing such as the struggle to free yourself, and humanity from the chains of capitalism, racism, and patriarchy.   &nbsp;I&nbsp;was involved in social welfare work since I was in high school via Special Olympics, reading to little kids, and soup kitchens. It was 911 that changed turned me to revolutionary politics. I saw what happened, and naively expected the Bush administration not to go to war with Afghanistan.&nbsp;When they went to war, I was finally able to connect all the other instances in my life when politics did not make sense and understand the importance of systemic political change. I ran into radical papers on the Internet that covered the uprisings in Argentina which quickly turned me to an anti-capitalist. &nbsp;I will never forget the faces of people when I told them I am against the war on Afghanistan. I used to flyer dorms at Michigan State Univ. and Univ. of Michigan. People looked at my like I was crazy. Luckily though, I also met people who agreed with what I said.&nbsp; I remember those days with joy and laughter as I tried to change the world with such naivety and youth….I suppose the rest is history.

      Everyday I discover why I love my job. The kids where I work tried to braid my hair. It hurt a lot, but it was fun having them mess around with my hair. They made fun of me cuz my hair is not like black folks and they got a kick out of my constant squirming as they braided my hair. In the end, they could not do it because my hair was too silky and they did not have a comb. One of the little girls, Deserai, is set on braiding my hair. She will be mad if I end up shaving it this weekend... hehe &nbsp; &nbsp;

      I have been buried in political thought lately. Only a few moments pass by where I think about something other than politics. But, I need to heed my own advice that I pass to others as if I am an old-wise man. I was telling a friend that so far in history; anarchism, marxism and other leftist ideologies have failed to provide a philosophy of life&nbsp; which religion has&nbsp;done rather well. Although I have found a philosophy of life that has given me meaning, I know how easily it can be buried in the mounting importance of the political change that this world needs. I cannot lose myself in the political world as I did before...  &nbsp;  I saw Big Fish and it reminded me how someone's philosophy of life can change their whole life.

      I hope the posts of the last few days shed some light into why I am the way I am. I believe in something greater than myself--not only dying for it, but also living everyday for it and fighting for it.   &nbsp;Although the last month might seem odd considering I took time off from politics, it was the right decision. I needed to clear my thoughts and reflect on the events of the last 2-3 years. Now I have come back to politics with a sharper sense and a clearer direction....

      Well if this blog is to have any meaning, I should post the email my friend sent to me. I know if I was not doing this blog and actually writing in my journal, I would print the email out and tape it to the pages. So on that note... here is my friend's email with some editing of course. (I will aslo post how and why I became active during the course of the weekend.)  &nbsp;  Shemon:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;  I'm sure we will speak soon about political matters relatively but let Me express some personal thoughts for now.&nbsp; Thank you so much for&nbsp; attending the&nbsp;conference.&nbsp; It impressed me very much how in short notice you took&nbsp; that long train ride to Rochester. It meant more to me than you could ever&nbsp; know.&nbsp; I did not want to leave you there so early. I wish we could have waited&nbsp; all day till nightfall and kept you company until your departure. &nbsp;   I know you have had a very difficult year with your mom passing and&nbsp; separating from your girlfriend *****.&nbsp; Such a year would make most&nbsp; folks go to pieces to the point of retreating from new friendships and&nbsp; commitments. Your strength under adversity has reassured me in a very difficult&nbsp; period for myself, that my own commitments have not been in vain.&nbsp; And for that I wish you a thousand virgins AND a can opener (smile). &nbsp;   ****’s trials and tribulations has always been a cautionary tale.&nbsp;&nbsp; From the anxiety of growing old , single, and poor to the need to solidify&nbsp; my long term economic and relationship prospects without compromising my&nbsp; own political commitments, he's been my Yoda in many regards.&nbsp; My friend&nbsp; ***** in London has been another personal oracle.&nbsp; I previoulsy have seen him&nbsp; slip into mental illness (no exaggeration) as a result of his partner&nbsp; separating from him and listened to him renounce every political commitment he every made as if being toasted in the flames of hell.&nbsp; Consequently despite complaints I have been bearing witness learning greater and greater pyschological, sexual and economic discipline for a world however small I hope to midwife with some special people. &nbsp;   I have tolerated being toasted in the flames by **** (hopefully I can go on being extra kripsy after she has finally declared "oops")&nbsp; and academia a very long time as a result of bearing witness to these elders.&nbsp; I always listen and have patience for my political elders and break with them only under involuntary conditions.  &nbsp;  But please remember, contra your previous assertion, I am not YOUR elder, but of YOUR political generation.&nbsp; We shall rise and fall together in the same peer group.&nbsp; Your forceful voice of passion and poetry and political brilliance leave me no doubt.&nbsp; I have been convinced that a community without your kindness and integrity would be a much degraded place without you. Whatever I could possibly teach you, it is you who continue to illuminate aspects of a better place which I really want to be a part. Thank you beloved.&nbsp; I'll continue to do my best to be worthy of such a fine neighbor in our block party of the future. &nbsp;   And after a short pause for the cause now back to our regularly scheduled rants...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      I am almost scared of saying it. I have found a community that fulfils all my needs. I am scared because once you have something it is yours to lose. That is something I will not allow for what part fate has left that power to me. This community is a place where my spiritual, emotional, and political needs have found home and I want it to grow.  -----  Yesterday was an amazing day. I hung out with a friend/ political comrade. (We can call her Hawra) Hawra is someone who I have been close to for the last two years. I have wept with her, laughed with her, and fought battles with her. She finally moved back to Detroit for the summer and we had dinner to celebrate the occassion. I am so lucky to have her in my life.  I sent this email to her after we had dinner:  I guess I just wanted to email you tell you how happy I was tonight. I loved hanging out with you and laughing together. It seems like it has been such a long time since we spent some time talking. I hope you did not get annoyed by my consistent remarks to LDD. To be honest it is an organization where I have found something I never thought I would--community based on politics, love, compassion, sadness, laughter, and a myriad of other human tribulations. I hope one day you and I can both share in that community, but that conversation is for another day.  Anyways, I missed you a lot this summer and I am so happy to see you again and to have you in the neighborhood. I know I have not said this enough, but you are just the BEST!!

      Something happened on Monday that consumed all my thoughts. I recieved an email from a friend and political comrade that carried such weight, conviction, care, and passion that it touched a place in me that few things have. It touched a place where words are yet to be born and it is there where his words found a place to reside. In the shadow of his words, everything that I could say about life, politics, and the human struggle to survive seemed to fall short. I just wrote him back now...  ---------------------------------------  I am wondering if it would be ethical for me to post his email on my "journal blog"? I would obviously change the name and stuff.... What do other folks think?

      For so long I have chased dreams, movements, friendship, and love  That chase has led me through sadness and joy all in the span of a few seasons--autumn leaves and hot summer days passed before my eyes…  In those seasons I ran into laughter and tears, playfulness and hardship, companionship and loneliness, death and life itself.  Once I almost had a community, but it was only of friends...  In my chase, after the days of burning love when I thought no community could be found…  It is exactly that, which finally what I arrived to, with all the joys of sunrise and the grandness of falling stars…  In this community I found myself laughing not only with friends, but with people I have never laughed with before…  Political comrades who I not only would die for, but would also be willing to live for from the very first breath of the day to the last heart beat of my life.  The water that gave birth to my flowers, words, and smiles in the past belonged to her, but now the rain pours from this community as if I am in a tropical storm that soaks the soil to the very core of its being…

      July 9  I move in the direction of the train into the future of which I am uncertain of...  My whole life and soul bet on the greatest gamble I have taken...  My thoughts are clouded with nostalgia like the sky is with darkness...  My eyes drink the moon light with a desert's thirst.  ---------------  July 12  I am back from the LDD Conference (the revolutionary anarchist organization I am a member of). I have never seen that kind of revolutionary talent assembled in one room before. I believe it will only get more impressive in the upcoming months. The people who came to that conference each brought something unique to the table that when put together is a formidable organization. The question left to us is can we translate that potential and talent into a living organic movement. I believe this can be done.   I felt a part of a community this weekend and I feel as if I belong to one even though we are scattered across the United States. I look forward to the day when we can live in the same area and work on a common project.   I have never been so excited about an organization in my three years of activism. It was a sight to behold, this weekend.

      I feel hope and better days ahead...  My own dedication to change is sinking roots deep into my being.  Words are not able to express what I feel, but it is a tingle at the fingertips, and the rush of thoughts every single day, and a smile racing through the streets that point me in a direction.  I think I know where I am going, but I have given up trying to know the precise destination. As long as my journey does not end in a life of meaninglessness I will find happiness.   I am the sole measure of my life's success and worth and that is the most difficult task ahead- to measure my own life's success on my own judgment.  PS I will be at my organization’s conference this weekend in Punn Yum, New York so no blogging till Monday. I hope my blog-mates will hold the fort down!!

      I wrote this several days ago...  The flowers I grow in my heart's garden  In the seeds were the beginnings of my dreams  My dreams found hope and sank roots deep into courage which sprouted strong stalks with leaves and petals of love and compassion  The flowers bursted with laughter and hope for the bees to feast on and even in the dusk of my flower's beauty laid the joy and sadness of my journey's end.  --------  What keeps me going... Months's after losing her, I find more than anything else, it is Mom's death, memories of Brazil, and protests, and faces of children that remind me of what and where I want to go in life...  ---------  More later...

      I went to a small anti-war protest today. It was composed of your usual radicals. Everyone was hawking his or her political line which got annoying after a while. It was sad that more Americans (including Muslims and Desis) were not at the protest.  Well enough with the complaining!  Here is something that might interest Desi readers:  urlLink Youth Solidarity Summer . I recommend Desis to check the website out. This conference is a progressive forum for young Desi radicals to share ideas and experiences so we can better organize our Desi communities. I am attending the conference this year and am excited to see the kind of work being done around the country in the Desi community.   In the future I would like to come back to Detroit (after doing some traveling) and attempt to organize the Desi community in the metro-Detroit area.  I think the main group putting on the conference is the Samar Collective. Here is their online magazine:  urlLink Samar   Here is a Desi organization in New York City:  urlLink DRUM (Desis Rising up and Moving.    ps No posts from me on Sunday or Monday because the library is closed so no access to the Internet :(

      Someone in my extended family passed away yesterday and the service is tonight. Of course I was asked to go, however I do not know the person and I have always felt that people's lives have been trivialized by the way I have seen Desi and Muslims treat the affair. After the service, the next questions/ conversations are: lets go to the mall, nice shoes, blah blah blah. There is no reflection on the person's life or the significance of death.   I would like to think the concept of death would leave a profound impact on people, but it is something that people make a joke out of and willingly accept. I think someone's death is a place to reflect on the person's character and to discuss who they were and to discuss broader issues of life and death, and to think about our own place in that continuum, but I have never heard people bring up such topics, so I try to avoid funerals and services like the plague. I will think about the person who died when I am walking today, when I am eating, and sitting down--about what this loss means in the personal spheres and the grand scheme of things. I will try to take one more step in understanding humanities' journey that leads to death and begins a new after death.  I think that is why I took mom’s death so differently. I was naïve and thought that the world would stop, but it went on with its business. I thought people would look at her death and understand what it meant—I have always looked at her death through a political lens. I do not think it was cancer per se that killed her, but the environment that she was in for so many years: she worked midnight shifts, we lived near a factory in Livonia, and the stresses of everyday life in this country. Later on in my life I found out that women who work midnight shifts have a higher rate of cancer and I found out the factory we lived near released massive amounts of toxic chemicals into the air. Mom’s death was one more reason to be involved every waking moment to make this world better so other women would not have to go through what I went through and so other son’s would not lose their mother. I will never forget the last words she whispered in my ear as tears rolled down my cheeks: ayhh mara bacha.   I miss Mom everyday. I hope she has found peace and is happy with what I am doing. I cannot wait to see her again.

      Yesterday was months wrapped in the curtain of a sunrise and sunset....  Riding my bike to work the lyrics of the city sang in my mind. But the wind quickly erased whatever my heart composed. I suppose riding my bike again, I will run into those lost words, and I am sure they will be a little different than the ones that first came to mind.   At work, everything came together. The children worked hard on the projects my teaching partner and I assigned. We laughed and talked about so many things besides school. It felt like a small community even it was temporary.   In the evening, I hung out with an older revolutionary from the 60s and as always, it was an amazing night, talking politics and life with him. Besides getting drunk, he eventually sobered up and drove me around the city. We went through the ghettos of Detroit and Highland Park and saw prostitutes, pimps, little children riding their bikes at 1 in the morning. He showed me the memories of a city long ago hidden in abandoned crack houses and empty lots--the homes of famous revolutionaries from what seems to be so long ago. But I was quickly reminded that those people were not from ages ago, but a living reality as my friend had known many of them such as Ahmed Shawki, General Baker, and others who were involved in the revolutionary struggle in Detroit. It was a beautiful ride through the city. While much of it was asleep, there was still much restlessness. The wind as always carried scents of past struggles...  I had the weirdest dream this morning. I imagined that I traveled back in time to the first days that I met my love and lived those days again till the day we went our different ways. And then I went back in time and lived those days again and I kept doing that till I was very old. Eventually I met my love in the present and she asked where have you been and I told her that I was with her the whole time. The dream ended there... I do not know what it means, except that it left me with a feeling of sadness...

         I have so many thoughts after this week that I will try to write on the scraps of my memories. So many emotions and thoughts coursing through me I cant help but be sentimental and nostalgic.              I learned so much about myself, humanity, politics, and social relations.              Myself:              I still…              I feel like crying sitting at the subway all-alone with none of the yss participants. As I travel once again—in a journey that is yet to be understood, another part of me knows I am not alone. Only time and space separate me from the past, present, and future—that my community were the anarchists that died in spain, the people in iraq resisting the occupation, and the better world so many of us have hinged our life on. I know I am contradicting myself but these are my thoughts… separation is always painful….              I loved being with the kids outside the yss conference, drinking with them, laughing with them, and discussing politics. I know I had my issues with the conference’s politics but even with those disagreements it was the human relationships that changed how I saw the yss organizers. It redefined who I am….              Once again I learned that politics alone does not determine my life but people’s personalities, their laughter, character, smiles, tears, frowns, and all sorts of other habits—perhaps through it is their dreams for a    better world and their willingness to fight for it that makes them my friends…              I want to write more, but I am emotionally overwhelmed…

      I am looking forward to the end of this conference. although i have met some very nice kids who are pretty sharp, the conference was like a beginner's intro to activism which was not very helpful for me. Three years of organizing and reading have left me a little ahead of the rest of the class and even some of the damn "teachers"/ organizers.  I have not thought about much except for politics and how I am dying to build a political community that is self-governing and believes society can do that as well. I am so excited for that...

      i just got home... my bones ache... but i want to write about so much cuz i dont want to forget..  the brooklyn bridge... i walked over it with 3 other s. asians... it was beautiful at night... perhaps if i was alone i would have cried at how amazing nyc looked... i dont know  i read 2 very personal poems for the talent show which was a big step for me... at least...  i loved talking to soo many young kids about revolution, freedom, life, love, and politics...  it made me happy today.. but i am exhausted...  i still thought about what happened last night and i am sad about it...  i talked to my friend, HK, she knows who she is... and it was good hearing her voice... as always...  i have to wake up at 8am tommorow...  i dont feel sad, but i dont feel happy.... melancholy... i dont know...

      How do I describe something which I cannot openly talk about on my public blog....  at 122am i feel so sad about what happened to two very close friends. it hurts me sooo much... and... my whole face is covered with sadness and it is times like this that i dont want to have a public blog anymore because my emotions are masked by the public face of this journal...  no... not my emotions, but perhaps the details... my emotions might seem erratic but after the phone conversation i just had with my friend and found out what happened i am so scared and sad about the future...  i am sooo scared of being alone... that i will never meet anyone in my life that will have the passion and the dedication to what i have thrown everything of myself into...  all my thoughts that run through my mind are of concern for my two friends and the fear that i might be alone for the rest of my life--that i will never be in love again... it just puts a blanket of sadness so heavy that it smothers my dreams not just for a better world, but a happier world for myself where i can have kids one day and a wife i can love with all my heart...  i am not sure what will become of me... in that sense...  i am scared...

      So I left my uncle’s place at 8am and just came home around 12ish at night!!  It has been an exhausting day defending and advocating various ideas. I cant describe the experience clearly but it has been a measure of how I have developed politically. Lot of kids younger than me asking a lot of good questions. But a lot of older folks disagreeing with me as well…  Way too damn tired to write much else… gotta be back at the conference at 9am tommorow….  Hmm….

      I know my writing will not keep up with my thoughts this month. The car ride alone left a sea of thoughts to write down, but I have too much work to do to write everything down.  I know an emotion that I have been feeling ever since I came to my uncles place is how much I miss my mom. He really takes care of me and it reminds me of how mom took care of me. It is funny that being in New York, the most profound thing I have noticed is that and not the thousands of new faces and new places that I have seen. I know I am lucky to have some people in my life that worry about me like that. I have a cousin in Michigan who makes me feel like family. He knows who he is. I don’t tell him often enough how much I appreciate his friendship, but I think we both have an understanding. Sunday the Radical Desi conference will begin, lasting a whole week. I am excited…

      So I am leaving for NYC around 12ish today. I am anxious to see what happens, especially at the Republican National Convention. Everyone is expecting a lot of violence from the police. I have a feeling it will be a very painful experience. I am worried... deep inside about what will happen. I know the days are marching closer to Aug. 29-31 when possible a million people will be protesting against the convention.   I think what I am trying to say is I don’t know what will happen in the upcoming month… how else will I be changed? What will I see? Where will I go while I am in NYC? Who will I meet? What will I feel? As always I am greedy for life and cannot wait to experience the New York night…  My thoughts are consumed not by the present, but by worries and hopes of the future. In that vain, I cannot find words right now that can express my concerns for tommorow...

      I thought Anon 1’s comments on the articles were interesting and I am not trying to tear them down or anything. In general I agree with everything Anon 1 has to say. I just think I owe her a response the comment she put up, especially after I asked for some feedback.  I think she hits the point that most men are not comfortable with women who have strong personalities and character. I would argue that is mostly due to society and the way patriarchy functions in this world. The systemic problem of patriarchy can only be tackled by struggle in a manner that tackles the issue head on. Of course there have been many instances in history when the equality of women has been proven in struggles that are not against patriarchy per se. For example when women in strikes are just as militant as men and they break the perception that women cannot be equals with men in militant actions. The same can be said in the academic world—in our classroom settings, but the problem with the academic world is that it is relegated to words and people are not always moved/ their perception of reality is not always moved by a strong argument or a great mid-term paper. Nothing changes men’s perceptions and women’s perceptions of themselves like actually being involved in some sort of struggle when they can actually feel empowered and take control of their own lives.  A comment Anon 1 made that left me a little confused was: “Also it is not haram for men to see women otherwise there would be no need for hijab.(Honestly what are you gonna wear a hijab for? To cover from the walls in your home?)”  So do you think women should wear the hijab?  From my perspective I believe women have the right to wear the hijab, but the hijab should not be the measure of their piety. In that same line of thought, neither should whether a woman wears jeans, shorts, or a skirt be a measure of her religious dedication. I would argue there are a lot of other ways to measure someone’s commitment to religion and God. Of course in our society the only way a women can prove her worth is by covering her body, then she is falling the word of God. So again the battle field becomes the women’s body and her appearance which I do not agree with.  I really have not thought about whether the woman’s actions were productive or not. To me it seemed they were and were rather appropriate. But Anon 1 raises a good point on how to conduct yourself when doing things against the grain. I think that will require some more thought on my part. Off the top of my head, I don’t think that she should conform to any standard of clothing and should stick to what ever makes her feel comfortable.

      In a weird way I have learned that the most private part of my life--the part that I covered up in public, my love for my old love was one of the most powerful political experiences I had. Obviously I am not narrowing down the relationship just to a political experience, but it tested my perspective on life, it taught me how to be happy, and how to experience sadness. It showed me the depths of myself and another human being... The reality is (I believe) that the experience I had can help others understand patriarchy, themselves, Islam, and the Desi community. I am not saying it will change people's lives, but at least it will help them see some things clearer depending on each person's understanding of what I have written. That is why I am not worried about sharing my most private thoughts online at this point. I have decided that after my pamphlet is completed, I will post that on this blog and stop blogging. I feel that this specific journey will come to an end at that point. So August 31st is the approximate deadline....

      I just wanted to say sorry to Anon 1 if she felt I offended her with my "lol" in one my responses. It made me laugh in the good way that people are discussing this blog. It is not the laughter of cruelty or contempt, but the laughter of joy and satisfaction that came from my work. I hope that makes sense. It is comparable to when folks cry when they are so happy.  I did not mean to pick on ya either regarding the "trivial" things in life. I just have been doing a lot of day to day stuff that is trivial but just as important as political stuff. Perhaps it is coincidence that it is about the same time that your post appeared on discussing trivial stuff.  Also, it seems my own writing and emotions need a break. I have not had much to say lately because of my focus on politics and I think for now I have spilled a lot into my journal.... I dont know if I will be as consistent as I have been in the past--writing almost everyday.  I do know I want to reply to Anon 1's post on Women in Islam. It has been on my mind and I will make time for it in the following days.  take care

      So sometimes even my big mouth has little to say. I took some time off from political work and had fun with a cousin of mine. We can call him Frank. There is much I have to say about this cousin, but I will save that for a later day :)  So I guess you could say I was enjoying the trivial things in life all evening Friday and all day Saturday!!!!  :)
