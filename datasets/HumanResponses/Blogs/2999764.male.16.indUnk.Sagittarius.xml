      So, I was thinking about Jake Knapp yesterday, and I realized that he helped to play my trumpet (that doesnt sound like much) I remember he would ALWAYs compliment Kyle on how he played, and he would ALWAYS tell me, that I sucked, and that i wasn't loud enough, and that got me mad, and everytime he would be there to listen to the band play, he would do it again, and again, and everytime i tried to get better so he would FINALLY compliment me, that finally happened, a few practices before state or somewhere.  He would always talk to me online, jake was a GOOD person, and will always be remembered.  He touched everyone's life in a different way.  So, yeah....That makes me realize that life is precious, and that we need to not take things for granted and be thankful for all of the things we have in our lifes.  I'm so grateful, for my friends and my girlfriend, my family, EVERYTHING. Life is short.  We need to live life to its fullest, no matter how hard it may get.    Just some random thoughts, from over the past few days.   Peace

        PASSIONATE LOVER. You love to love, always looking for a relationship. You cannot live without it. Your lover must be passionate  and you want that you and your partner melt into each other. He/She should not try to take the domination . You dont want a relationship without passion, and the sexuality plays a big part. The first moment you meet him/her is one of the most important. There has to be something between you , you cannot explain. From the first moment on everything must fix. But when this passion disappears you disappear to. For you it is better to leave than to see your love restrained.  PLEASE VOTE, I want to know what you think about my quiz, I worked hard on it.You can always message me or tell me how I can improve that quiz. Ill sure write back.    urlLink   	~THE big LOVE TEST!! What do you need? With PICS! For girls and boys!~     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla     So, im in love, thats all i need to say...I AM IN LOVE!!!  I have nothing else to say...

      SO...it's been awhile since I've updated.  So let's see what's happened since the last time I updated.  Band is done now...until August..(Indian Sands)..This years show is pretty cool, I have a SMALL solo..but it's cool.  Band is fun, I had alot of fun on all of the trips.  I worked ALL day today... 11:30 till 6:00, what a long day.  Samantha came to eat lunch with me on my break, that made me really happy.  I love her, we are so much better now...I feel like, things are brand new, and are perfect.  I love her!!!  The fourth of july was awesome, parades sucked, but afterward was the best.  I went to summerfest with sam for a little bit, but it was nasty there, so we left, but then I went out with my friends for the rest of the night. It was awesome.  So far summer has been great, and there's still so much more summer left.  Right now everything is PERFECT.  I'm going to see DAVE MATTHEWS BAND !!! I'm so excited.    Well, I'll update more later.  {peace}   I LOVE YOU SAMANTHA

        Last night was fun, I went out with Tj and Dan, and then later on that night, we met up with Sam and Katie. It was fun..I had a really good time.  Today i woke up at 7:30, and I got ready, and i went to the high school, to meet a new trumpet player that just moved here, who joined band. He's small, and short, but I hear that he's a pretty good trumpet player. That's good though, we needed another trumpet player. Now we have 8!  : -)  Samantha, and I went to lunch today at Noodles. It was REALLY good. I got a huge bowl of mac n'cheese it was pretty good, and the bread was GREAT. mmmm :-) Samantha and I are good now...and I'm happy.  Tomorrow is my last day for Driver's ed, we have our test tomorrow, and it's really easy, the teacher went over the EXACT test out loud with us, and it is easy. After that I'm going to the DMV to get my Temps, which is cool. I heard that the test is easy, so I'm not nervous, but I AM excited to drive :-).  Saturday morning, we leave for camp Indian Sands, and we don't get back till Tuesday night. Hopefully we'll get alot of work done. It should be really fun. I'm excited.  Well, I'm going out tonight, I'll update later.

      This is been a long morning, I woke up at 8:00...that's really early.  I went to driver's ed at 9:00, and I fell asleep during the class...haha....I only have two REAL classes left, cause on Friday we have the "Final Exam" as the teacher says.  So, that's really good.  I think I'm going to go in to the DMV tomorrow or Thursday to take my Temps test.  I'm excited to start driving!  I work tonight till 9:45.  Gay...hopefully I can get off at 9ish or so...hopefully.  Work is retarded...it's really really depressing and boring and stupid...lol.   I can't stop thinking about Samantha(  Well, I'm going to go finish a movie with my brother. Then I'm going to wait till Samantha calls me.   PEACE

      Last night was fun, Samantha told me she met Guster..that's really cool! I wish I could've been there.   We had a cookout in Dan's backyard, it was really fun.  We went to Pick n Save to buy some buns, and meat and chips.  We made some really really good burgers.  Today I have driver's ed, and then I'm going to Mayfair to return a shirt to get a bigger size.  Then hopefully Sam and I are gonna go see a movie :-).  Well, I gotta go eat breakfast, and get ready to go.   Peace
