      This DNC seems to be going great, they have all kinds of great visions for the future of the nation... too bad they have no actual plans as to how they will accomplish these tasks.&nbsp; Could we really put someone in charge of the country who has not&nbsp;attended something like 38 out of 44 meetings in his current position.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are all kinds of comments regarding the stupid remarks made by Bush, and I will agree he does tend to trip over his own words as well as make less than correct statements.&nbsp; However, let's look at a few of the things that Mr. Kerry has said:   May 2004: Kerry claims " When Bill Clinton left office, not one young American was dying in war anywhere in this world."&nbsp; I guess those American's involved in the War on Drugs in Central and South America do not count, and neither do the American troops being killed elsewhere in the world.   In First Dem Debate, Kerry Strongly Supported Presidents Action In Iraq. KERRY: George, I said at the time I would have preferred if we had given diplomacy a greater opportunity, but I think it was the right decision to disarm Saddam Hussein, and when the President made the decision, I supported him, and I support the fact that we did disarm him. (ABC News, Democrat Presidential Candidate Debate, Columbia, SC, 5/4/03)   In 1991, Kerry Supported Most-Favored Trade Status For China. Sen. John Kerry said yesterday that he is breaking party ranks to support most-favored-nation trade status for China  I think the president has some strong arguments about some of the assets of most-favored-nation status for China, Kerry said. (John Aloysius Farrell, Kerry Breaks Party Ranks To Back China Trade Status, The Boston Globe, 6/15/91)   In 2000, Kerry Voted In Favor Of Permanent Normal Trade Relations With China. (H.R. 4444, CQ Vote #251: Passed 83-15: R 46-8; D 37-7, 9/19/00, Kerry Voted Yea)   Now Kerry Criticizes The Bush Administration For Trading With China. Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry said on Monday Americans workers were paying the price for President Bush's weak stance on trade with China and other countries.  On the bus tour, Kerry singled out the Bush administration's handling of trade with China and said that country was manipulating its currency. (Caren Bohan, "Kerry Pledges Aggressive Trade Stance," Reuters, 4/26/04)   These are just a few of the many vacillations and thoughtless comments made by Kerry recently. As for his running mate who has made his fortune through some viable lawsuits, but mostly through frivolous and overplayed lawsuits which have hurt the medical community deeply. Doctors are currently having to pay tens of thousands of dollars for insurance to guard themselves against lawsuits, many choosing not to practice any more, and others to deny new patients. Currently the situation in Dallas is evidently to the point that women who do not currently have a OB/GYN are almost unable to get an obstetrician, and will have to end up having their babies in the emergency room with a doctor who has no previous patient knowledge. I am not a doctor myself, I don't even work within the medical profession, but I do have several friends and family who are doctors and nurses. Having the opportunity to gain the insight to these professions has also given me a greater insight to the political underworking dealing with health care. All in all, the Democratic health care agenda would have extremely detrimental effects if implemented.   I am currently unemployed and will be making a relatively diminutive salary once I do gain employment, so I may fit the current Democratic demographic stereotype. Well at least the stereotype that the democratic party has positioned itself with. However, I am still intelligent enough to look at the facts and make an educated decision. Yes, there are many things that I believe W could do better, but he is a far better option that the Billionaire, indecisive N.E. aristocratic cardboard box of a competitor.
