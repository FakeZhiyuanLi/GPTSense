        This writer is attempting an appeal, and if the complainer has a solution it leaves the door open.  I cannot imagine what happened in the first place.    Please do not simply bad mouth the club or the staff. We always want to learn from you, our customers, and we welcome the opportunity to make changes and improve our services. If you tell us that something is wrong, we will take quick action to put it right. We realise that there are times when we cannot satisfy everyone, but we will do everything possible to help, even if we can’t find a perfect solution at least it might go part way to solving your issues with the club's administration and we can all get on with enjoying the facilities.

        That vocal minority again?   Be vocal about the kinds of things you expect. Participate. Don't let the vocal minority dictate the policies that effect the majority. Understand that like any restaurant or public venue, your Club can have a bad day. Let management know when this happens. Be understanding but firm that you expect better consistency. You are part of the Club family. Don't be so eager to air the dirty laundry. Do not allow emotion to dictate your actions. Never take it upon yourself to discipline or "dress down"an employee. Don't become part of the problem. Report inappropriate behavior to management.

        I thought it was widely understood that Women had same rights as men?  Martha Burk and her attempt to pressure Augusta National Golf Club into admitting its first female member is not getting much attention here as Masters week began Monday with thousands of golf fans streaming onto the course to watch the first of three days of practice rounds.  On Tuesday, Burk, chairwoman of the National Council of Women's Organizations, will announce a new initiative to change the club's all-male policy during a 1 p.m. news conference at the National Press Club. She said in an interview last week she also will be enlisting the help of a nationally prominent attorney well-versed in dealing with strategies to combat racial and gender discrimination, and will introduce him at today's session

        Organized groups need rules?  I am confident that in your deliberations that will not happen. The Club has to insulate itself from the POTENTIAL of harm that could come from having people who don't feel they should be bound by Club rules. We have heard from those who don't feel they should have to be members of the Club in order to particpate in a Chapter--THEY DON'T LIKE BEING TOLD WHAT TO DO!! It is a preposterous assumption that there will be a mass exodus from the Club if required membership for Chapter Members becomes a rule.

        Considerations   The depreciation method  1. Straight line 2. Declining balance  Depreciation start date Recovery or salvage value  The asset's life expectancy   Straight line method  The cost less estimated recovery value spread over the asset's life:   The Original Cost               =   5,000 - Recovery Value                = - 1,000     (4,000)  / Divided by life expectanc  y    / 2 years   (2,000) ============= Depreciation                    =   2,000 per year  This shows that an item purchased for 5,000 has a life of 2 years and a recovery value of 1,000.  The annual depreciation can be calculated at: (5,000 - 1,000) = 4,000 divided by 2 = 2,000.    Declining balance method  This uses a depreciation factor and calculating depreciation using the factor reveals a greater deduction during the earlier years and less during the later years.  The effect also causes a lower income tax payable in the earlier years which is why its popular.

        This was sent by an irate librarian.  If your job involves finding something you would expect some organization, but doing what is best for one is not everyone.   "An inventory hasn't been completed in this library in several years, so I am making it a priority. I've read the articles which say they are not necessary, but when you find as many mistakes in your catalog as I've found, I disagree.  I don't think it matters when you do one, though year end or year beginning. Do what works best for you. I've been working on the catalog all year and sort of inventorying as I went along, but I'm excited about closing down checkouts for a period of time and using my 4 aides to help me complete the inventory."

        Rivets, Bolts, Nuts and Fasteners   There are 6 million parts in the 747. Three million parts are fasteners, and about half of those are rivets.    Airline cargo handlers use the 747's lower-lobe baggage and cargo handling system to load or unload 85,000 pounds (38,500 kg) of baggage -- the equivalent of 3,400 pieces of luggage -- in less than seven minutes. The wing area of the 747-400 is 5,600 square feet (524.9 square meters), an area large enough to hold 45 medium-sized automobiles. The diameter of the 747 engine nose cowl is 8 feet 6 inches (2.6 m).  Four World War I vintage JN4-D "Jenny" aircraft could be lined up on each of the Boeing 747 wings.   To find # per pound, take 1000 divided by fastener lbs per thousand which is a normally published value.  To find cost ($) per pound, take cost per thousand divided by fastener pounds per thousand.  To find plating cost per thousand, take weight per thousand X plating cost per pound.     Washers  Unlike other fasteners, steel washers are sold per pound while stainless are sold per piece.  To find cost per thousand for steel washers, take cost per hundred weight divided by pieces per pound (published) X 10.  I am impressed with that, now I wonder if a building has more parts?

        Item Code, Item Description Part Number, Skew Number Catalogue Number and Catalogue Description The UOM and the UOM Description   Ordering is not an easy process for either the consumer, the retailer, or the  manufacturer. Unidentifiable part numbers and manual processes can lead to late delivery and possibly lost in transit. Using the current fax, phone, and mail-based processes, which are essentially manual processes, an estimated 60% of parts orders today need some type of clarification - unreadable fax, wrong or missing date of delivery, item out of warranty, missing reason for replacement, or the part cannot be determined based on the description.   When details need to be resolved manually, time is added to the process which may increase costs and customer dissatisfaction.  End result - an unsaleable inventory.

       On an income statement, the Cost Of Goods Sold or COGS is the cost of purchasing raw materials and manufacturing finished products.  Equal to the beginning inventory plus the cost of goods purchased during a period minus the ending inventory.  Also called cost of sales.   Represents an expense, separate from Expenses on an income statement. It is the cost of merchandise sold to a company’s customers during a specific accounting period.

       Looking at an income statement, the gross profit margin is a measurement of a company’s manufacturing and distribution efficiency during the production process. The gross profit shows the percentage of revenue / sales left after subtracting the cost of goods sold.  A company that yeilds a higher gross profit margin than its competitors and industry is boasting to be more efficient. Investors tend to pay more for businesses that have higher efficiency ratings than their competitors, as these businesses should be able to make a decent profit as long as overhead costs are controlled.  To calculate gross profit margin, use this formula:  Gross Profit ----------(divided by)---------- Total Revenue

       Physical inventory procedures include comparing the inventoried quantities with the quantities in stock records to check if there are differences. If the inventory and stock record quantities match, post the inventory and date of inventory in the stock records. Also, enter the inventoried quantity in the stock record to reflect the on-hand balance. If differences exist,  stock control personnel should reconcile the records. Reconciliation is the process of resolving inventory discrepancies. Reconciliation process consists of several  steps. It is dependent  upon the type of material, cost, and the circumstances that led to a discrepancy. The reconciliation process may include conducting a preliminary or a causative research. It also includes processing inventory adjustments or adjustment reversals and  maintaining supporting documentations. A major difference exists when the physical count of a stock item differs from the confirmed stock record balance by 10 percent or more. A minor difference exists if the count differs less than 10 percent. All ships treat inventory differences for SPECIAL MATERIAL as major differences.

        I thought this was an interesting piece about the UK global inventory project GIP.  That is what I could call 'counting pins', but I think we are just as picky.    1.  UK National Inventory Project - an Information Society projec   The Global Inventory Project (GIP) aims to produce a multimedia inventory of national and international projects, studies and calls (where appropriate) relevant to the promotion and the further development of knowledge and understanding of the information society.  The GIP will build upon and complement ongoing national and international initiatives. The first phase of the project will focus on the creation and implementation of an index and directory system based upon national inventories of significant selected activities being planned or currently under way in the G7 partners.  The inventory will be expanded to include activities of non-G7 countries in order to create a "true and totally open planetary resource" of knowledge, ideas and possible solutions.    2.  The market for smartcards in healthcare is forecast to be 200m cards over the next five years.   Manufacturers, however, see the healthcare sector as a sub-class of egovernment and are promoting multipurpose cards for everything from health to driving licences and evoting. Even European governments are contemplating combining card functions such as ID and health or even banking. This has brought public concern over confidentiality of information and the feasibility of managing multiple applications on one card. The concerns need to be addressed before there is more widespread rollout of multi-application cards.

These are considered liquid assets, since they can be converted into cash quite easily. There are various means of valuing these assets, but to be conservative the lowest value is usually used in financial statements.  Definition 2   The securities bought by a broker or dealer in order to resell them. For the period that the broker or dealer holds the securities in inventory, he/she is bearing the risk related to the securities, which may change in price.   See Also  first in first out, last in first out, asset, asset conversion loan, book inventory, dealer, drop shipping, floating lien, perpetual inventory, property inventory, shrinkage   Book inventory   What stock on hand should be according to the accounting records. There might be small discrepancies between book inventory and actual stock on hand, especially in larger companies when it is difficult to keep a very precise record of stock on hand.

        Some know how to maximize their tax situation already, but worth the read if you do not.     Taxpayers used to be able to write off a business meal with a customer at which no business is discussed.  This ended somewhat abruptly for many business people who had become accustomed to the perk.  We all have to eat, afterall.  Tax rules (and it depends on where you are) state:  an expense for any entertainment associated with business is deductible as long as it either precedes or follows a substantial and bona fide business discussion.  By ensuring business is married to the entertainment, 'before', 'after', or 'during', taxpayers could eat (well technically) for free.  Also, a business discussion during a meal can allow you to write off other business entertainment.  As an example, McSale takes McClient out to lunch.  They play golf but no business is discussed that day.  The next day, they meet again for lunch and discuss a new line of products.  McSale can deduct the 2nd day lunch but gets no write off for the Monday lunch or for the greens fees because there was no business discussion before, during, or after that lunch.  If McSale has deductible and nondeductible meals then he should ensure other entertainment happens before, during or after those deductible meals.  The deducatible meals and the business discussion are therefore both eligible for write off.  As a marketing tool, wouldn't it be possible to promote coupling McSales to McClient and even generate the occasion, the rules, the cost?  If clubs promoted the notion more ostensibly, we could see a new wave of revenue yielding ideas - and another win-win-win for McSale, McClient and McGolfClub.

       In the general ledger, adjustments to an inventory asset accounts may be increases in value (appreciation) or decreases in value (depreciation - for wear and tear). Increases in the resale value of assets will appear as a positive difference between the latest resale value and the new one.  Decreases in resale value will appear as a negative difference which will reduce the value in asset account.  The following varies depending on local tax rules but essentially depreciation is a portion of the cost that reflects the use of a fixed asset during an accounting period.  A fixed asset is an item that has a useful life of over one year. An accounting period is usually a month, quarter, six months or a year.  If you bought furniture for your rental property on March 1st, for $5000 and it was decided that the furniture had a useful life of two years, using a one month accounting period and the “straight-line” method of depreciation, the cost to be depreciated would be $5000 divided by 48 months, or $104.17 per month.  The information you need:  1. The type of item (furniture). 2. The start date for the item (March 1st) 3. The cost ($5000). 4. Life expectancy (two years). 5. The method  The useful life for rental inventory is important in deciding whether the net profit of a business is higher or lower.  Rental inventory depreciation is a direct cost against rental revenue.  Book depreciation is based on the useful life of an item, and the local tax rules will indicate what is 'useful life'.  If you are concerned with applying costs to generate net profit you will use book depreciation - higher the write-off, the less tax.    Small businesses that aren’t always able to generate an exact value for net profit tend to lookup the published useful life for the asset and apply that.

      Officially called "lawn tennis", to distinguish it from older forms of the game "royal tennis" and "court tennis" which are played indoors, is a racquet sport played between    1. two players (singles) or 2. two teams of two players (doubles).   Tennis is played on a 78' x 27' (78' x 36' for doubles) court, which is divided in the middle by a net, such as that each side measures 39' in length.   Players attempt to hit a tennis ball with a tennis racquet such that it bounces in the opposition's side of the court and the opposition is unable to return it. A legal return is made by hitting the ball over the net, after not more than one bounce on one's side of the court. Each point is started by a player who initiates play by "serving" the ball into a designated area on the other side of the court. Tennis is an Olympic sport which is played in many countries around the world.   A tennis match is won by the first side to win 2 out of 3 sets or 3 out of 5 sets. Traditionally, matches played by ladies last 3 sets while those played by men last five. However, at many lower-level tournaments 3 sets remains the norm for all, while at a few tournaments, ladies play 5-set matches as well. A set is won by the first side to win 6 games, with at least 2 more games won than the other side. A game is won by the first side to win 4 points, with at least 2 more points won than the other side. Points are awarded as follows:    0 points - "Love"  1 point - "Fifteen"  2 points - "Thirty"  3 points - "Forty"   Scoring  The server's score is always announced first. If the server has won 2 points and the receiver has won 1 point, the score would be "Thirty-Fifteen". A player who wins a fourth point is awarded a game, unless each side previously had 3 points. This score, corresponding to "Forty-All" is called "Deuce". The player who wins the subsequent point has a score of "Advantage". If this player also wins the next point, game is awarded. Otherwise the score reverts to "Deuce".    Tournaments  Tournaments are often organized by gender and number of players. Common tournament configurations include men's singles, women's singles, doubles (where two players of the same sex play on each side), and mixed doubles (with a member of each sex per side). There are also often tournaments for specific ages, such as for youth and seniors.   In most tournaments, if the game score in a set reaches 6-6, a series of points called a tiebreak takes place. The first side to win 7 points, with at least 2 more points than the other side, wins the tiebreak. The score of the set is recorded as 7-6. However, in several tournaments, no tiebreak is played during the final and deciding set (third or fifth set, depending on the length of the match); rather, the set is played until one side leads by two games.    Shots  A tennis player usually has several types of swinging shots at his or her disposal: the forehand, backhand, volley, overhead smash, slice, drop shot, and lob. When a player serves the ball to the other player at the beginning of each point, he or she will use either a flat, top-spin, or slice serve.    Backhand  The backhand, useful for chasing shots from the opposite strong hand, can be employed with either one hand or two hands. Two hands offer the player more power, while one hand can utilize a slice shot, applying backspin on the tennis ball to fool the opponent. A small number of players, most notably Monica Seles, use two hands on both the backhand and forehand sides.    History of tennis  Unlike most modern sports, lawn tennis has a very short history, and its invention can be precisely dated. In December 1873, Major Walter Clopton Wingfield devised the game for the amusement of his guests at a garden party on his estate at Nantclywd, Wales. He based the game on the older sport of indoor tennis or Real tennis, which had been invented in France in the 12th century and played by French aristocrats down to the time of the French Revolution.   Wingfield borrowed both the name and much of the French vocabulary of royal tennis and applied them to his new game.   The word "Tennis" comes from the French "tenez", the imperative form of the verb tenir, to hold: it thus means "Hold!" This was a cry used by the player serving in royal tennis, meaning "I am about to serve!" (rather like the cry "Fore!" in golf).  Racquet comes from the French raquette, although it ultimately derives from the Arabic rakhat, meaning the palm of the hand.  Deuce comes from the French expression à deux le jeu, meaning "to both is the game" (that is, the two players have equal scores).  love comes from the French l'oeuf, the egg: a humorous reference to the egg-shaped zero symbol  The convention of numbering scores "15," "30" and "40" comes from the French quinze, trente and quarante, which to French ears makes a euphonious sequence.  In 1874 Wingfield, seeing the commercial potential of the game, patented it, but he never succeeded in enforcing his patent. It spread rapidly among the leisured classes in Britain and the United States. It was first played in the US at the home of Mary Ewing Outerbridge on Staten Island, New York, in 1874.   In 1881 the desire to play tennis competitively led to the establishment of tennis clubs. The first championships at Wimbledon, in London were played in 1877. In 1881 the United States National Lawn Tennis Association (now the United States Tennis Association) was formed to standardise the rules and organise competitions. The U.S. National Men's Singles Championship, now the U.S. Open, was first held in 1881 at Newport, Rhode Island. the U.S. National Women's Singles Championships were first held in 1887. The Davis Cup, an annual competition between national teams, dates from 1900.   In 1926 a group of American tennis players established a professional tennis circuit, playing exhibition matches to paying audiences. For 40 years professional and amateur tennis remained strictly separate: once a player had "turned pro" he or she could not compete at the major titles. In 1968, however, commercial pressures led to the abandonment of this principle and the "Open Era" began, in which all players could compete in all tournaments and most players made their living from tennis.   Tennis was for many years predominantly a sport of the English-speaking world, dominated by the United States, Britain and Australia, although it was also popular in France: the French Open dates from 1891. Thus Wimbledon, the U.S. Open, the French Open and the Australian Open (dating from 1905) became and have remained the most prestigious events in tennis. Together these four events are called the Grand Slams (a term borrowed from bridge), and winning the Grand Slams is the highest ambition of most tennis players.   Since the beginning of the Open era and the establishment of an international professional tennis circuit, fed by revenues from the sale of television rights, tennis has spread all over the world and has lost its upper-class English-speaking image. Since the 1970s great champions have emerged from Germany (Boris Becker, Steffi Graf), the former Czechoslovakia (Ivan Lendl and Martina Navratilova), Sweden (Björn Borg), Brazil (Gustavo Kuerten), Russia (Yevgeni Kafelnikov) and many other countries. Recently African American players such as Venus and Serena Williams have become a force in the game.   Many of the greatest players who ever lived played in the days before Open tennis and are now completely forgotten by modern sports fans. Among them are Bill Tilden, Ellsworth Vines, Fred Perry, Don Budge, Bobby Riggs, Jack Kramer, Pancho Segura, Frank Sedgman, Pancho Gonzales, Ken Rosewall, and Lew Hoad. For many years most observers considered Tilden to be the greatest player who ever lived. In the 50s and 60s, there was general agreement that Gonzales had replaced Tilden as the best to ever step on a court. Whatever the case, any one of these 12 would be more than competitive in today's game.

      Golf, like other sports, is played professionally in many different countries. Organizations usually called "tours" form tournaments, find sponsors, select participants, and set rules and standards. There are many different tours around the world, including the European Tour and the Canadian Tour, as well as the Champions Tour for pro golfers 50 years old and up, and the LPGA tour for women golfers. The most widely known is the PGA TOUR (correctly rendered in all caps), which attracts the best golfers from all the other men's tours. This is due mostly to the fact that winning a PGA TOUR event results in a six-figure (sometimes seven-figure) paycheck; in turn, PGA TOUR wins can mean endorsement deals, automatically provide the winner a minimum two-year exemption to play in other tournaments, and supply the prestige earned by beating the best of the best.   The Majors   The four biggest tournaments in professional golf are called "majors" and they are played at roughly the same time every year. The four majors are:  The Masters U.S. Open  The Open Championship (British Open)  PGA Championship  The Masters has been played at Augusta National Golf Club in Augusta, GA since its inception in 1934. The U.S. Open and PGA Championship are played at various courses around the United States, while the British Open is played in the U.K.   Winning a major is the crowning career achievement for many professional golfers. Most will never accomplish this very difficult feat. Jack Nicklaus, who is widely regarded as the best golfer of all time, has won 18 majors. Tiger Woods, who is possibly the only contender to Nicklaus' record has won 8 majors, all before the age of 27. Tiger has also come the closest to winning all four majors in one year (known as a "grand slam") when he won the U.S. Open, the British Open, and the PGA Championship in 2000, and then the Masters in 2001   Most business golfers either cheat at golf, if they are poor golfers, or play under their ability, if they are good, since it is considered most advantageous to lose to one's superior, but within fewer than 6 strokes.

       urlLink http://wiki.tatet.com/Bowls.html  Crown green bowls is a variant of lawn bowls played in the north of England, in Wales, and on the Isle of Man. It is played on a lawn from 30 to 60 yards square. The centre of the lawn is 8 to 18 inches higher than its edges.

      It was played in ancient Egypt, Greece and Rome and spread to Europe by the 10th century. Played on a grass plot, the green; players roll balls (bowls), about 5 in. (13 cm) in diameter, at a smaller ball called the jack.   "Some confusion exists between the games of Lawn Bowling which does not use pins and the entirely unrelated game of Ten Pin Bowling, which does use pins. Both, however, rank among the most popular participant sports in the world. Today, more than 100 million people in 80 countries participate in bowling."   Lawn Bowls  - an outdoor game in which players roll balls, called bowls or woods, over a flat lawn. The object is to get as many as possible nearest a target called the jack. The game is played mainly in the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa and to some extent in the United States, where it was introduced by English settlers in the late 17th century. There is an indoor variety of lawn bowls and other forms more popular in continental Europe. Among the latter is boccie (or bocce), played in Italy and also in the United States. World lawn bowls competition is administered by the International Bowling Board, which was established in 1905.   The Lawn (or green)  - must be at least 40 yd (at least 36 m) square, surrounded by a ditch 12 in (30 cm) deep and 12 in wide, enclosed by a sloping bank. The green is divided lengthwise by strings into six "rinks," or alleys, 18 to 21 ft (5.4 to 6.3 m) wide. Bowlers must stand with at least one foot on a rubber mat in the center of the rink being played; the back edge of the mat must be 4 ft (1.2 m) from the ditch. Matches may be played by either individuals (singles) or by teams of two to four players (pairs, triples, and fours).    Dimensions  - Bowls may not be more than 16.5 in (41.9 cm) in circumference or 3.5 lb (1.6 kg) in weight. They are made of wood, hardened rubber, or a synthetic composition and are flattened (biased) slightly on one side so that they roll with a curve. In singles and pairs, each player has four bowls while in triples, each player has three bowls and in fours competition, there are two bowls per player.   The white ball  Bowls are rolled alternately by the opposing players toward the jack, a smaller white ball, 2.5 in (6.3 cm) in diameter. Each bowl nearer the jack than any bowl rolled by an opponent scores a point. Bowls are termed dead if they travel less than 15 yd (13.5 m) from the mat, come to rest outside the rink, or go into the ditch without touching the jack. Bowls that hit the jack on their initial roll are called touchers; they remain potential scorers wherever they land. An end is completed when all bowls have been rolled. Matches may be played for a certain number of ends, usually 15 or 17, or until a particular points total is reached, 21 points in single game

       Tennis courts  A tennis court shall be a rectangle, 78 feet (23.77 m) long and, for singles matches, 27 feet (8.23 m) wide. For doubles matches, the court shall be 36 feet (10.97 m) wide.   Fastest 147 Snooker break  The fastest 147 break in a professional snooker tournament is 5 min 20 sec, by Ronnie O'Sullivan during the World Championships at Sheffield, England, on April 21, 1997. He made his first century break when he was just 10 years old and later became the youngest player ever to make a maximum break in a tournament aged 15 years 98 days. In 1993 he was named Young Player of the Year and then Player of the Year in 1994. He is famous for playing with his left hand even though he is right handed!    Fastest ball sport  The fastest projectile speed in any moving ball game is approximately 302 km/h (188 mph) in Jai-Alai. This compares with around 270 km/h (170 mph) for a golf ball driven off a tee. The word Jai-Alai actually means "merry festival" in Basque and professional Jai-Alai in America started in Miami in 1926. The game originated in the Basque area of Spain's Pyrenees Mountains over 300 years ago.   Fastest men's pool ball potting  The record time for potting all 15 balls is 26.5 seconds, by Dave Pearson (UK), at Pepper's Bar And Grill, Windsor, Ontario, Canada, on April 4, 1997. On May 25, 1998, Dave completely cleared 10 tables in 10 minutes in Las Vegas, Nevada, USA.   Fastest century in Billiards  Walter Lindrum's world record for the fastest billiards century is 46 seconds, set in Sydney, Australia, in 1941.

      Between every hole, is a skins game.  The game consists of throwing the golf ball from a spot designated by the winner of the previous skin (original spot will be chosen by the winner of last year’s skins game, or the winner of last year’s match play if there was no winner for last year’s skins game) to the specified tee marker of the next hole (also determined as described above).   For every player that lands on the tee box (any part of the golf ball in contact with the short grass of the tee box), a putt off to the designated marker will take place.   a) The putt shall be made with the club the player will use to hit the tee shot b) No player may take a read of the putt. c) Each player may take enough time only to target the putt. d) No objects may be moved to give the player a clear line to the target.  Player must go around or over the object. e) If a ball comes to rest against an object, the player may take one club head’s length from the object (like miniature golf) f) The player’s word will be taken as to whether contact was made with the tee marker or not.  Hmmm?   The player that hits the marker in the fewest number of putts wins the skin.  In the event of a tie, the skin is halved, and pushed to the next tee.  In the event of a tie on the last tee, the skin will be settled on the putting green, where the winner of the last skin will determine the putt.  No handicaps will be applied.   The club the player chooses to hit the tee shot, and thus the skin’s shot, may not be changed after the first skin’s shot is taken.     Scoring  1.    Each player will be responsible for his/her own score. 2.    Should a player need advice, he/she may seek it from playing partners.  In the event of a dispute, the rules book, which will be provided, will have the final answer.  All disputes will be settled after the round, as to not hold up play.  In the case of a dispute, asterisk the hole, make a note of the dispute, and resolve it after the round. 3.    Each player must sign his/her own card, and each card must be attested w/signature.  Attesting merely checks the player’s math, it does not validate each hole’s score. 4.    Should it be found that a player’s score was incorrect, the player is duly disqualified from the match.   Side Games - Long drive  a.    On the day of the best ball, the players will determine a long drive hole. b.    On the day of the singles match, the person who drives the ball furthest down the fairway wins. c.    All of the ball must be in the fairway in order for it to qualify. d.    The ball qualifies so long as it is in the fairway. e.    If groups are split up, a tag will be used.   Side Games - Closest to the pin (KP)  a.    On the day of the best ball, the players will determine a par three that will be used for the closest to the pin competition b.    The KP game will take place on the day of the singles match. c.    Whoever hits it closest to the pin, wins. d.    If groups are split up, a tag will be used.

       Single Elimination  - This is the simplest style of tournament.  If you win, you progress.  A single defeat, means you're out of the tournament.  The tournament ends, when there is just one player (or team) left, who remain undefeated.   Double Elimination  - This is similar to single elimination, except you are only removed from the tournament, after two defeats.  After your first defeat, you go into the "dungeon" (the part of the tournament, for those who have lost once).  In the final, one player who is undefeated, will play someone who has lost 1 game, so the undefeated player needs to lose two games in the final, to lose the tournament.   Swiss System  - This is different to the elimination tournaments, because everyone plays in every round.  The tournament ends, when there is only one undefeated player, so the tournament length is not certain, before it begins.   True Swiss System  - Like the swiss system, everyone plays in every round, but the number of rounds is set before the tournament begins.  This means that the tournament winner might have lost games, or there might be co-winners (which means, there is no outright winner)

      The golf tournament business is huge because of the many ways to make money.  In recent years, the charity golf tournament has surpassed the raffle and the carnival and become the popular accepted way to raise money.  Only gala balls and some wedding parties can make more money, and that is because of the cost versus income ratio.  Over half a million charity tournaments are played each year, according to information from the National Golf Foundation, and more than 60% of planned tournaments are for charity.   That money comes from players' fees, auctions, raffles and sponsoring.  How much money is raised depends on how hard the organizers work.  Unique, first time tournaments net from $5,000 to $50,000 and annual tournaments, in the $100,000 area.  The work is in attractng golfers, getting sponsors and negotiating the course fees.  The trend for fund-raising golf tournaments started about 25 years ago.  Its popularity is due to golf's availability as well as its large following of baby boomers.  Baby boomers are estimated to be a mainstay for golf courses until 2012.  Eighty five percent of golf tournaments are identical with respect to how they are organzied and operated - the registration fee, the prizes and the scoring.  The remaining 15 percent comprises different or unique tournaments, and that can be reflected in the food, unique prizes or the reason for the event itself.  Some tournaments are founded around a good cause charity, some around a commemorative event, and others by having celebrity players.  Celebrity golf tournaments are not always accessible because of the price tag.  The price to play with well-known people is substantially higher -- about $1,000, as an example, compared with a regular green fee rate of $50 to $100.  Also, many of these tournaments are private.  Organizing a celebrity tournament may be more trouble than it's worth.  Having a big name player or host can be too expensive.  Charities, on the other hand, can usually have a good golf tournament by arranging a good party instead.  They tend to be relaxed and less competitive - golfers enjoy being with other golfers, and for a good cause.  For golf courses, a tournament means guaranteed income.  Courses can often schedule tournaments for week days, making weekends more expensive.  Some courses are booked solid, the majority if not 100% of their business is tournaments.  The appeal in promoting tournaments is obvious.

      Despite progress over the last century, private and social clubs still exclude persons from membership because of race, gender, sexual orientation, religion or national origin.  Because of 'exclusionary policies', such persons are denied access to business and professional contacts that are normally developed and advanced in private clubs.  Despite pressure and negative publicity, and federal regulations preventing federal personnel from participating in these facilities some elected and appointed officials for federal appointments have maintained their memberships.

      Private clubs in certain parts of Canada can expect a surge of membership applications now that they are fast becoming the last havens to allow patrons to down a beer and puff a cigarette.  Managers report that some very old clubs which opened more than 50 years ago have been receiving enquiries about memberships and smoking rules.  Several bar patrons at one club told the city council that they would consider joining the 'smoking club' if the council banned smoking in the city's restaurants and bars.

      It is the intent of this club to limit rules and regulations to the minimum required for the enjoyment by all its members and guests.  Enforcing rules is in the hands of the Management and the Management reserves the right to alter these rules  The Management will provide sufficient notice of any amendments.   Membership entitles the member's spouse and any children aged 25 or under to club membership privileges.  Any notice of change of status must be reported thirty days in advance.   A membership is subject to the member's compliance with all rules and regulations at the club.   Membership  entitles you to reserve facilities. Policy will be adjusted to reflect membership growth and membership type.  Members requiring 'Leave of Absence' may request for a minimum period of siz months and a maximum period of three years.  Members may only take one 'Leave of Absence' from the Club within a five year continuous period.  The member must give thirty days advance written notice to the club of his intention and the member must be paid up for all dues and charges for the Management to consider this request.

      In order to not delay the pace of play each group must keep up with the group ahead. All rounds of golf are expected to be played in 4 hours - or less.  If the pace of play is not observed the offending group of players will be informed by the assistant on duty that the infraction has been noted and more, that their booking privileges may be restricted or denied if they have multiple infractions against them.    Have a great game! The Management.

       Marshalling is everything from enforcing the rules to putting out fires, but primarily controlling the play of the course 'for everybody'.  The number of players that can get started, when they start, how fast they play, how slow they play and then ensure play is enjoyable - is to a very large extent controlled by how well the course is marshalled.   Managing golfers on the golf course     Prior to tee-off, speak with each group - its also good customer relations!  Many problems can be headed off by explaining the course, nuances, the course policy and the reasons.   If it appears that a group has fallen behind, time them on a hole.  This will identify a slow group properly, you can quote their rate of play.  Do not penalize a group before talking with them (they are patrons afterall).  Instead, identify to them a problem they may have run into (i.e. lost ball or O.B. - Out of bounds). Its also possible they know the course very very well, so some tact is called for.  Once a group has fallen behind, warn them that they are out of position and must keep up with the group in front of them.   If the course has a beverage cart, ensure sales are made after the play of a hole and near the next tee box. This will assist flow of play.   All marshals should work with the flow of play rather than against it. When new at marshalling take the time to learn ths shortest circuits and the easiest play.   If, after all best attempts, golfers still do keep up with the pace of play, request them politely to allow the quicker groups to play through.

       Local rules allow a faster group to pass a slower group on the same hole.    This usually happens because golf etiquette provides for a slower group to allow a faster group to play through. The slower group may allow the pass to occur at any part of the hole they are currently playing, but usually it happens when the faster group is waiting at the tee box for that hole. The slower group will usually stand to the side and wait for the faster group to finish before resuming play. Sometimes Play Through is requested by the marshall, who tells the slower group to stand aside.

       Simultaneous Starts  Some courses may start a group of golfers on hole number 1 and another group of golfers on hole number 10 at the same time - in order to accommodate more players starting at preferred tee times.   When this is practiced, pace of play is very important, and the course officials must block out all tee times for the equivalent of the nine hole pace to avoid overlap when groups cross over from each nine. It is not unusual for the first groups out to finish ahead of the normal pace and have to wait when they make the turn. To make this practice acceptable requires excellent course marshalling, as well as setting the proper expectations for the players.   Traffic Jam?  Still depending on the local rules, someone coming off hole number 9 usually has the right of way when continuing there round.  This means they would have been able to tee-off before someone starting their first tee-box.   More Cross Over  Its common practice at many clubs to optimize cross overs to the extent that golfers could hit off on all tee-boxes at the same time.  Therefore, possibly 18x4 (72) golfers starting at 8:00am arriving at (Start hole + 10) approximately 2 hours later (10:00am).  A cross over block could consist of less than 18 holes and for 27, 36, 45 hole clubs, more!   Shotgun Tournaments  A shotgun start allows for a tournament to be completed in the time it normally takes one group to finish 18 holes.  Its a way to tee-off all groups of players simultaneously from different holes.  Supposing 18 groups of foursomes, then each hole on the course will serve as the starting hole for each group. Group A would start from No. 1, Group B from No. 2, etc.  Each group would begin play at the same time - hence a "Shotgun" start.   Example Cross Over Schedule  All play will begin on #1 or #10 tee as prescribed by the Golf Professional.     December, January, February  1st Crossover    9:00am to 11:00am daily  2ndCrossover    1:30pm to 2:00pm  3rd Crossover   N/A   March  1st Crossover    8:00am to 10:00am  2nd Crossover   12:30pm to 2:30pm  3rd Crossover   N/A   April to September  Straight tee times          6:30am   October  1st Crossover    7:30am to 9:30am  2nd Crossover   12:00pm to 2:00pm  3rd Crossover   4:30pm to 5:00pm   November  1st Crossover    8:00am to 10:00am  2ndCrossover    12:30pm to 2:30pm  Nine holes only until time change

       Can anyone volunteer to describe how they would perform a cross over on a paper tee-sheet? What did pro staff do before computers?

       A course handicap   This is a number that tells golfers how many strokes they are allowed to take during a handicap round, and it is not the same thing as handicap index.    A handicap Index   This is a numeral, to one decimal place, that represents a golfer's potential for scoring. A handicap index of 14.5 indicates the golfer may shoot somewhere around 14 or 15 strokes over par. The handicap Index is not an average of a golfer's scores, but rather a calculation of what the golfer might shoot on his or her best days. This is calculated through a complicated formula that usually requires a computer. Golfers who carry a Handicap Index usually obtain it through their local club who also keep track of the golfer's round scores and will issue a handicap card with the index stated on it.    A slope rating   A slope rating (the word is trademarked by the USGA) is a measurement of the difficulty of a course for bogey golfers relative to the course rating. The most important role of slope is leveling the playing field for players of different skill levels.   For example, Player #1 and Player #2 both have handicaps of 16. But Player #1's handicap was calculated at a difficult course while Player #2's at an easy course. The course those two players meet at to play will have a slope rating that can be used to determine how many strokes each of them receive (Player #2 will get more than Player #1), thus ensuring a fair game. Slope is used in the U.S. and Canada, but other golf associations are starting to adopt it   Average slope rating is 113. The slope rating is measured by the governing handicap authority for each set of tees on a golf course, and a course may have separate ratings for women.  The minimum slope is 55 and the maximum is 155 (slope does not relate specifically to strokes played as course rating does).  Slope is important in calculating scores that must be posted for handicap purposes.    A course Rating   The course rating tells scratch golfers how difficult the course will be  The slope rating tells bogey golfers how difficult the course will be.    Par   Par is a value that represents the number of strokes it should take to play a hole. The value assigned to represent par is always comprised of two putts and the number of strokes it should take to reach the green. The total of all par values gives us the 'par' value for the course.
