      Femta still shows that I'm at my "highest" phase of fertility.  I thought that it would be cool to try maybe every other day, but Liam has been nothing short of amazing, EVERY NIGHT!  Oh my... I'm feeling pummeled, poor me.  But I think he finally understands how important this is to me, to us. Starting a family is the next step in the natural progression of our marriage.  In the hopes that this month will be the one, I've thought over several names but the only one that Liam and I can agree on is Meilani Michelle.  I'm assuming that most men want the first son to be named after them, so I'm only concentrating on the girls' names. I know that thinking about names could prove disasterous, but I must remain positive throughout this ordeal, no matter what happens  I'll see my neice for the first time ever this weekend.  I'm sure that it will be a joyous time.  Until I become a mother, it is my hope to be the best godmother and aunt around.

      CD#10  Femta (my trusty ovulation calendar) reports that today is "very high", so it's time to get this show on the road.  So beginning today, I'm going to have to convince Liam to have sex every other day for the next 14 days.  I figure I'll take it easy on him, poor guy.  I really can't wait until this is over and we've conceived.  Our sex life is shot!  There's no spontaneity anymore, it's a chore.  Gone is the beautiful union of two people that it was in the beginning of our marriage.  We've been through a lot trying to get pregnant, embarassing doctor visits, needles, specimen cups, poking, prodding.  I've saved up some money to treat him to a great dinner at an expensive restaurant!  He'll deserve it by then anyway  I was diagnosed with PCOS in September 2003, and I've had a failed IUI that November.  After discontinuing birth control pills, I've had irregular periods, but after researching my problems (weight gain, increased hair growth) I've learned more about myself and my particular problems.  My OB/GYN never said anything to me, it took a visit to a specialist, a Reproductive Endocrinologist.    Dr. Brown is a wonderful guy, he confirmed that I was indeed "fertility challenged", but that I would be pregnant in the next 6 months.  I'm glad that he was so confident, because my husband and I lacked confidence needed to make it through this long and intense journey.  No more are the irregular and annovulatory cycles.  Diet and exercise have improved my cycles to 28 days and I'm ovulating every month.  Now to catch the elusive egg  ~~~~~~~~~~~ O
