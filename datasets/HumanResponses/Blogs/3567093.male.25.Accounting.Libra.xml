						   It has been a week since the passing of President Ronald Regan.  Seven days have been filled with bitter sweet moments and memories as this nation says farewell to one of our heroes.  These are grounding moments of reflection for the country and for us as individuals.  They give us pause for self-evaluation and they provide for us a window of insight into the impact one man can have on the world.  True heroes are rare.  Ronald Regan was one of my heroes.  Regan contributed heavily to the image I hold in my minds eye of what true leadership looks like.  It has been a privilege to be reacquainted with much of those images over this past week.  His departure from public life left an empty stage upon which he has returned for a final farewell to a nation that loved him. Those who aspire to great things are lucky to have lived after Ronald Regan. He left for us a clear example of the value and importance of passionately working to improve the world.  Reflection on Regan's life yields to those who are searching, a sure way in which to affect lasting and valuable change.  I believe the late President would have advised those of us who are planning to lead this country forward to chiefly and genuinely care about our fellow man and to passionately pursue those things that are righteous and true.  The political stage needs more candidates who have the strength to do so.  Regan's strength and the example he set should be a model for us all, it demonstrates the impact of living a life of true purpose.  Let this lesson be one which resonates within our hearts and inspires us to do the same.
