       It said on the news today that we were experiencing a perfectly normal English Summer and that it was only the fact that we had a seen a couple of year's of exceptionally fine weather that had lead us to believe that this Summer was truly awful - something about 'rose tinted spectacles'.      Trouble with English Summers is that this makes outdoor events somewhat of a gamble. Today, however, was a day for tea, scone, jam and cream. A truly English, and very Conservative, constituency event. It is when you attend events such as these that you realise that this consitutency that I am fighting really is Conservative. In fact what has been quite remarkable is the way that the sitting Lib Dem MP has been able to paint himself as a Conservative despite his parties overt left wing stance on taxation and Europe - still such is life and I suppose my job is to convince the many that voted for him that true Conservatism can only be found here!      Back to the tea - weather held off and much chat about the weeks by-elections. In fact there was plenty of optimism that the significant Kingston and Surbiton victories at the June elections and the Lib Dems proving their vote is declining in the South and rising in the Labour heartlands will mean a good victory in this part of London.      The party on the ground is actually in good heart ( although too much cream might create bad hearts!) and this is what will be important in Kingston and Surbiton come the General Election.

        Had a meeting this evening with some residents in Tolworth who back on to the allotments behind Ladywood Road. They have a legitimate complaint that the allotments are an absolute mess. But the problem is worse than that!

       Daughters yesterday and wife's today - Birthday. Great day in London as a tourist on a tourist bus with family. Dinner in evening.  No sure if anyone caught this on the news yesterday but whilst this initially sounds like a good idea you cannot help worrying about some aspects.   urlLink  Elderly urged to take in jobless.    As it is I sometimes wonder if this would not be a better thing for students rather than the unemployed. The unemployed want a job and students are frequently occupying privately rented housing that could be used for others.  We also have   urlLink  'A' level exam results   . For once I am going to agree with some of what David Miliband says. It is a great shame that every year exam results come out we denigrate the achievements of the students. However, there are caveats to this. I hear a lot from teachers who tell me that children moving from school to college or university end up having to play catch up on subjects such as maths because they are not of the required standard. Maybe that always happened but many think not.  The simple fact is that the world and the skills needed to succeed in the world have changed. Frankly, if the exams we are asking children to pass now are not different or improving then they should be. Students today have an array of tools available to them that were not there even ten years ago - computers, the internet etc. Schools have changed and students are changing as well. A colleague of mine calls them 'MTV' children who can sit in a room and have the TV, radio, computer etc whirring and still read Shakespeare. Does that mean that standards are falling? No; but it probably means that the exams and the pedagogy need to change. It may mean that we need to see the sort of realignment of exams that took place with the GCE/CSE merger. However, I am very worried about an incoming Conservative Government wanting to inflict more turmoil on education. Not that it does not need it but change brings uncertainty and this Government has spent its entire period in office meddling and changing education.  So to all those students in Kingston who have received or will receive their exam results I offer congratulations and hope that the exams that have been passed will offer the greatest chances for them to excel in their adult life.  Oh, and happy birthday to my wife.

      Today is my youngest daughters birthday - she is 2. Bit of a drama on the present front as the store (who shall remain nameless) told us the present was in stock but forgot to mention it was in Northampton!! Fortunately as she is 2 whether it is here today or tomorrow hopefully will not scar her for life!   urlLink The party announced a new policy on the motorist , ending the attacks that are unfairly being launched. The trouble is that the law abiding motorist gets caught up in these draconian road measures and the poor motorist who pays, along with smokers and those who drink, probably the highest level of taxation and fines in the country. In return he gets crumbling road surfaces, road humps and pariah status!  Spent an early evening getting soaked whilst delivering.

       Had a fun evening with a groupf of Conservatives in Chessington. They had been particularly active during the times when we made a clean sweep in Chessington and took all the Council seats there. Lots of questions and answers on policy and what the party needs to do to get themselves into a position of winning the next General Election. Great evening with great company. Most exciting aspect is that they all want to participate in campaigning and help out. This means a starting team of 25'ish in Chessington!      urlLink  The party announced it's policy on phone masts   . Phone masts are a running sore in local government. Whereas Councillors get to decide planning applications for almost everything else because of some quirk they do not on phone masts. Phone masts cause the most public concern because of their association with health problems etc. They can also look damn hideous. There is a building on the A3 near Tolworth that looks dreadful with about a dozen of these things stuck on top and with no attempt at concealment. This is a good policy and I hope that one day we will extend our planning policy to stop the meddling of the Mayor for London and John Prescott in the planning process.

         In this world nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes.    Benjamin Franklin, Letter to Jean-Baptiste Le Roy, 13 Nov. 1789             According to the  urlLink Shadow Chancellor  this is becoming more and more true under this Government. In places like Kingston it is beginning to have a serious impact on the inheritance that we leave our children. The simple problem is that the Inheritance Tax threshold (the sum at which we get charged) has obviously not been rising as fast as house prices. In 1997 only one Borough in the country had average house prices that qualified for Inheritance Tax; today there are 86.       A very interesting perspective on this comes from the Adam Smith Institute who have calculated   urlLink  "Tax Freedom Day"    the day at which we, the workers, start earning for ourselves and stop paying the Government.      This whole issue of course links to Labours General Election commitment not to raise income tax and yet still pay for the massive investment in public services. Instead of income tax rising all the other taxes have had to rise instead and the most painful has been Council Tax. Now of course the Lib Dems will jump up and down and say "Local Income Tax". Is it the answer? Will it not merely lead to only the low earning and the very rich living in Kingston? The calculation I hear is that those earning over £30k per year will pay more and yet you need to earn over £55k per year to get a mortgage for a starter property in Kingston. My fear is that it would squeeze out the families we want to see live in Kingston.     In any case there is a difference between having "the ability to pay" element in any taxation and the need for Local Income Tax. Remember there was no pain in Council tax before this Government came to power. Maybe what should be happening is that the two main parties should be looking at how to reduce the burden of taxation overall rather than just focusing on one element - Council Tax / Local Income Tax. There are those who also argue for a   urlLink  local sales tax    but for the life of me I cannot see how the implementation of such a scheme would work in practice.      But for now we are stuck with this Governments policy on taxation, tempered by the natural tax reducing inclinations of the Conservatives and the tax and spend of the Lib Dems.      I think there is probably an issue over who wrote the death and taxes quote first. Whoever it was did not, I imagine, believe that taxes beyond the grave would be higher than those this side of the grave!

       Finished up delivery in a few roads in Old Malden this morning and then took children out to Richmond park to let them run off some energy. Great walk around the Isabella Plantation; another great park on our door step. My Grandmother loved the Isabella Plantation and it would have been her 90th birthday today.  Noticed for the first time the new 20mph speed limit in the park. Cannot believe how silly it is. Firstly a car going 20mph takes longer to go through the park and therefore spends longer in the park polluting. Secondly I have to tell you that going at 20mph there must be a greater chance of losing concentration and just staring out the side window whilst driving. It is so slow it almost seems like a toy town ride. Still, the Royal Parks Agency are also the body responsible for the Diana Fountain fiasco (as it is in their park and they gave permission) which says something about their competence to run anything! It is time for Councils to at least have a say in the running of these parks, although in the case of Kingston I know there are some residents who would not want the current Council administration in charge of anything!!  Also dropped into the Korean Fair on the Fairfield this afternoon which seemed lively and very food orientated. Still, food is where most cultures meet!  This evening we took our French guest (Linda) out to dinner as she leaves tomorrow - escaping the mad house that is the Davis'. Been good to have her here and good for the children to have an extra pair of hands to distract them.  Finally there was a very interesting radio 4 (Own correspondent) this morning about Russian planning blight. Sounds more and more like Ken Livingstone.   urlLink  They posted it on the BBC website.

       Quite a slow day really catching up with paperwork and administrative stuff that accumulates around you. Also my week of tax return filing. Always leave it till August when I supposedly have more time to put all the information together.  Have a catch up for you on my blog about the   urlLink  Tolworth allotments   . It would seem that pressure is beginning to pay off. I have had it reported that someone turned up to cut the scruffy grass and then went away again after making a feeble attempt to cur back some of the jungle of weeds. Trouble is someone has now decided to dump a tree they have cut down. I will post some picture to the Blog and you can have a look as to whether you think it is acceptable for the Council to say "nothing to do with us!".  Remember this was where last year the Council ran an action day for the residents to clear up the area around their homes. Having cleaned it up they went away again and did nothing. The residents think that given how much tax they pay this is unacceptable and it should not be for them to go around clearing up public spaces. What is your view?

       A very busy work day today.       This morning spent in Haringay at a school where we are working as part of an intervention team and this afternoon in meeting around a project called "Networking for Transformation" and the future provision of IT in schools.      This evening spent another two hours delivering to homes around the Fairfield.....      Not sure whether any of you have picked it up but there is a story on this evenings BBC online about   urlLink  Princess Diana's driver (Henri Paul?) having his blood tested again.    It also mentions the Al Fayed accusation that his son and Diana were killed as part of some conspiracy. This is tough but surely the time has come to let this rest. There is a part of me that can see Al Fayeds point of view, and were I to lose a child I am sure the truth would become an obsession for me. But there is also the fact the you have to move on and however much you may want to bring them back it will not happen.      On a lighter note have you seen the story about the   urlLink  McDonald's happy meal    that comes with a free pedometer. Apparently they have been overwhelmed with the demand and have had to order more. Very interesting that it takes a private company to implement the Government's objective of healthy eating! Could be a model for other political strategies? Makes you wonder who has the real power?      Finally I gather that spending on education has risen by   urlLink  26% since the mid 90's.    Can anyone explain what this is about? If this is the case exactly where have standards risen by 26%? I am involved in education and surely the issue is not what is spent but where it is spent and just maybe if it was spent a little more wisely then taxes would not need to be as high as they are. If this is the case then why are schools budgets suffering as bad as they are? Why are schools about to suffer a crisis in their IT budgets (as they tell me they are!)?       There must now be a concerted effort by the two main parties, whether in Government or not, to increase the productivity of schools budgets by whatever means possible. The alternative is that spending on education spirals out of control with no demonstrable benefit.       I have an interest here. Some politicians spout on about this subject without any knowledge but I have children and despite this spending increase I see the problems that the schools still face every day.

       Seems like the Police theme is going to last right up to the next election.  Spent some time today out on a ward audit with the Safer Neighbourhoods team. Police Sergeant, Council Officer and myself doing a drive and walk around the ward identifying areas where there is the potential for trouble and where action can be taken to improve the safety and environment of residents.  It was a fascinating time discovering potential issues around the Berrylands Station and walking through virtually unknown alleyways off Surbiton Hill Park. Also looking at the problem of the green triangle at the end of Alexandra Drive. What it actually demonstrates is that whilst Berrylands is in fact a pleasant and safe place to live there will always be an unpleasant side to the most sedate area. Unsurprisingly many of the local issues are low level and involving young people and clearly there is a big job for the Police in engaging with this problem.  I am confident that our Police, despite all the constraints, are doing as well as they can. Release them from the bounds of bureaucracy and do away with the avalanche of initiatives and who knows how law and order in our communities might be transformed? I noticed that today the Government tried to spin the law and order debate back their way by launching another new idea. Who are they kidding? Can't stop spinning!   urlLink  Arrests for all offences proposed     Also had a meeting with council officers on the grass-cutting contract and the dreadful state of the recycling site on Raeburn Avenue. I have been promised new lights, signs and some new cleaner recycling bins as a way to improve the environment around the site. I shall keep my eye on this one!    Spent a couple of hours delivering this evening – another stifling warm evening despite the slight breeze.

       Today was police day. On the homefront I met our new Borough Commander and nationally the party was launching our policy of zero tolerance policing and the end of 'sociological mumbo-jumbo' blurring the distinction between right and wrong.  Our new Borough Commander is a change for the Borough. She seems very focused on the problems we as a Borough face but is also open to new suggestions on how policing can be improved in the Borough. She is also experienced in Kingston having worked here before. It was a valuable first meeting and I feel a new approach to the actions the Police can take to tackle some of the serious issues we have over anti social behaviour and drunkenness, especially in Kingston town centre.  Whichever way you put it the Police have an impossible task. The Government have introduced "safer neighbourhoods" as a way of getting more localised and visible policing and yet as I have   urlLink  mentioned in an earlier blog    there are inherent risks in what they are doing and how they are doing it. At the same time they are expected to put more police on the streets to tackle anti social behaviour and fill in more forms at the same time.  Which is I suppose where the   urlLink  Michael Howard speech    comes in. It is frankly incredible that from March next year the Police are expected to fill out a form every time they stop someone - this is ludicrous. I hear all the cries about how civil liberties are likely to be abused and how will we know that the Police are being even handed in the way they deal with ethnic minorities etc etc. But are we really going to be surprised when the Police are not on the streets because they are filling out forms to provide ethnic monitoring, or the nurse is not attending to someone in casualty because they have to fill out a form to show they are meeting some target? Does everything that public servants do need a form to monitor it? Is a form the only way we can be sure that the ethnic minority groups are not being stopped more than others? There has to be a better way - and in the meantime we should let the Police get on with their job and the nurses and doctors with theirs and if the other parties do not trust these people to do this then they should be honest and say they 'do not trust the Police'. In any case there is a vast difference between 'stopping' and 'searching'. Currently if the Police 'search' someone they do need to fill out a form and this would continue. What the Conservatives are against is extending this form filling to every time an officer 'stops' someone.  Hysterically of course the Government jumps up and down and screams about it all and how MH cannot possibly afford this - which is total baloney. Given how much taxation has risen in this country and how much this Government is spending of our money it is a nonsense. I say "cut the forms and keep the Police".  The Lib Dems? Well once again they managed to condemn the whole thing as a   urlLink  disaster    clearly indicating they think filling out forms is a good idea. They also put out what they called a 'well worked set of proposals' which basically amounted to adding in more cost for a bunch of national quangoes called a   urlLink  National Police Agency, a National Border Force and a Financial Crime Directorate.    More forms, no more Police except they might offer 'softer' jobs for those nearing retirement to stay on longer. Please....We have had this silly approach for too long. We know all about the Lib Dem Plans to   urlLink  not jail first time burglars    and giving prisoners the right to vote, what people write to me about what they want done is more Police and fast, fair and forceful enforcement of penalties.  So a good Police day all in all and finished the day off with a trip to the cinema to see Harry Potter - great movie - but after all that crime maybe all I wanted was a bit of escapism!!

       What a humid day it has been. The threat of storms but nothing materialising. Really pity my wife that during the Summer holidays, with four children, when it rains it is so diffcult to keep them amused without it costing a fortune.      Sources tell me that tomorrows   urlLink  Surrey Comet    will be an interesting read - not sure what but something about opening out a debate and internal strife within the Lib Dems. We shall see! We hear so many stories of the rows and dissent within the local Lib Dems that we have lost track now. Still a good platform is building for us to fight the local elections in two years time.      As rain held off did some delivering this evening into the Grove ward area. We are getting a pretty good response over there for what was a pretty solid Lib Dem area once. A number of new party members and deliverers. Clearly things are improving for us locally even though the polls are not moving nationally.

       Great Day today. Some delivery this morning and then entire family round to lunch - Brother from Manchester and youngest brother and wife from Lidd. Spectacular day, threatened all sorts of rain but came to nothing.   Exhausted at end of it but good to get family together more than once during a year.       Long day tomorrow sorting out the appalling Council grass cutting contract with council officers as well as trying to do something about the recycling centre at Raeburn Avenue This issue has become even more ridiculous and has almost nothing to do with recycling anymore as the degree of private dumping of fridges etc has reached ludicrous proportions. Real quandry though - we all support recycling but.... there must be a better way of doing it. Perhaps if the door to door recycling was better we would not need these static sites?

       Bit too hot to do things quickly today. Attempted a fast delivery of leaflets around Grove ward and then felt too hot. Will go back Sunday evening and complete.      Took the children out cycling through Bushey Park and back along river and then a slow evening.      Noticed the issue about fireworks. Doubtless lots of organisations and parties will be trying to grab this as their success. Fact is there is a lot of ill feeling surrounding fireworks and their innappropriate if not dangerous use. Actually think the regulations have got things broadly right although, if I heard the radio report right the idea that you single out special events (New Year, Diwali etc.) but give them each seperate curfew times does seem a little potty. Still, I am sure we all believe that our MP's know what they are doing!! Also a little unsure about the six month's in jail bit! Seems a bit steep when so many seem to get off so lightly for doing much worse.

      I am sitting here watching the closing moments of Big Brother.  Politicians moan and complain about how they wish they could get as many people interested in politics as they are in Big Brother. The fact is of course that policians do not really put themselves on the line in the same way the contestants of BB do. Open, naked honesty cannot ever suit some politicians - especially the naked bit!  But there is a difference between honesty and blatant opportunism that gives politics and politicians a bad name. Let me give you an example.  The Lib Dems have claimed that they want to give all elderly people in England free personal care. In fact a Lib Dem MP called Gidley has said: "Britain’s elderly should receive free personal care, unrestricted by discriminatory criteria." You can see it on their website -  urlLink click here   And yet in Kingston the Lib Dem Council is considering implementing a means tested tax for domiciliary care; care for those with terminal diseases or those too old to run simple tasks for themselves. In fact they might charge up to £400 per week for those with most savings and the highest need for care. This is outrageous, but not only am I outraged but so is Age Concern Kingston and the Kingston Centre for Independent Living. But this is the nature and style of the Lib Dems, promising the popular knowing that it is not deliverable without pain - like the idea of a local income tax. But it is also just so damn mean. Can the Lib Dem Leader of the Council really believe it is fair to say "it is fairer to charge wealthy people for the cost of their care than charge everyone through council tax." Surely that is what a caring society is about, using taxes to care for the frail and vulnerable, not just the poor?  Instead of standing up for these people I gather from  urlLink Lib Dem Watch  that our own MP was leading the jeering and the abuse thrown at the Labour candidate at the Leicester East by election whilst he was trying to give his vixtory speech.  And now it has grown even worse as the Kingston Lib Dems attempt to betray an election pledge to provide a day center for the elderly in Chessington and instead build a dementia unit on the site. A centre that they might move again in a few years - what happened about caring for people!  I am sorry to sound negative, I am not personalising this, but hypocrisy should make people angry. Being elected brings responsibility and if you are not able to stand up for people: rich, poor, young, old, drug user, alcoholic, whatever, then you should not stand for election.  So what are they going to do with the Big Borther house at the end of this series? Maybe there are some politicans that ought to spend some time there and get to know what real people are like! Maybe being publicly voted out of office for the way they behave in the house might sharpen up their acts a little?

      Another hot day. Not so much hot as steamy! Clearly not as steamy as it must have been at the FA board meeting today!  I noticed today a wonderful example of Lib Dem nonsense. They attacked the Conservatives for arguing that some Police forces were reporting that they would have funding deficits by the end of the year. One such Chief Constable on the Today programme this morning agreed with this. And yet the Lib Dems manage to argue that our policy to have 40,000 extra policemen is half baked but then not put forward an alternative. See for yourself.....  urlLink Lib Dems have no policy on Police force   But I will tell you what really worries me about this Governments and Livingstones strategy for Police. I actually think the new neighbourhood Policing (6 officers per ward) is very good but I worry about its sustainability. The new PCSO's are great people undertaking a difficult job but.....they are not Police Officers, having no powers of arrest. The really worrying thing is that here we have brave PCSO's who are now going to be the 'Police on the Street' and yet we pay them significantly less than the poor police officer stuck in an office filling out the forms for Whitehall bureaucrats. There is something wrong here and I cannot help thinking this is policing on the cheap that is also putting the less well paid PCSO's in the front line. My Father was a Police officer for thirty years so I have a bit of an idea about the problems they face but as he says the irony is that this type of policing we were doing thirty years ago!! Nothing new there!!  Yet more deliveries tonight which worked up a sweat. Having the young girl from France staying I decided to take my wife to dinner and leave the children behind. Went to a great restaurant called 'The Italian Taste' in Victoria Road, Surbiton. Great meal, great atmosphere.

       What a day!      Had a very good business meeting this morning and really mapped out the future development of education. For those who do not know I run an education charity and one of the projects is how we can really use technology, in a sustaniable way, to transform the delivery of education - no small agenda. Sadly though not an agenda this Government gets because change relies on decentralisation to entrepreneurial head teachers rather than the over centralising instincts of Labour.      The young French girl staying with us also took her first visit to London. Our city is apparently "big", "exciting" and the "best place in the world". We cynical British sometimes forget the asset we have in London. Despite all the problems of Mayor Livingstone, and the horrors he will send over the next four years, this is a great place to live!      Did you hear the monstrous wash up from my article about the rain and delayed trains? Apparently Thames Water pumped a million litres of sewage into the Thames and now there has been a massacre of the fish we have seen populate this once foul river. What is going on? I will tell you. So desperate have the Government been to increase house numbers in london that they have built like mad without attending to the infrastructure issues that are inevitably there. My view is it is about time the developers started paying premiums to pay for the extra drainage and sewage required to accommodate these homes. If developers do not like it then do not build the homes. Do you think it will stop them?

        Ok..I admit it...rail privatisation was a disaster and the last Conservative Government made a mistake. It was not a mistake to privatise it but it was a mistake to use the method they did to privatise it. I heard on the radio this week that in fact fares will have in real terms fallen during the ten years of privatisation, whereas they rose by over 100% in the ten years before privitisation.

        I feel obliged to keep all my residents completely informed of where the best information can be found for the coming election. I would therefore urge all those who have an interest in really seeing what the Lib Dem party is about to visit a new Blog called Lib Dem Watch -   urlLink  Click here         Did anyone see the news article today that says that the President of the Royal College of Physicians (Dr Carol Black) feels that there are going to be too many women doctors and that it will weaken the profession to be too female dominated? Now, there was an awful lot said about women not wanting to do the more difficult medical specialities and that medicine would become like teaching which has mostly women and no influence (their views not mine!) but..... can this really be right? Are they saying we now need to introduce an equal opps movement for men? Mens rights? I think the heats getting to everybody.      Spent a frantic hot day at work and then an even hotter couple of hours delivering more leaflets - nothing glamorous about being a parliamentary candidate. Still it is the stuff of politics actually meeting people, must remember this time once elected and recall that keeping that contact not only makes it easier to do your job but keeps your feet firmly on the ground. But that is not just about holding special surgeries at which few turn up, but also continuing to knock on doors.      This evening was a warm evening and dinner with the family and Linda (a young girl from France staying for a couple of weeks to help out with the four children over the holidays).

       Some might argue that politics slows down in August. Not if you are a candidate fighting a large majority - quite the opposite. August is a month to get things delivered and to get things done.  So today has been a delivery day and a long hot afternoon spent in Old Malden and Grove wards delivering leaflets and survey canvass forms. Really getting a fantastic response from this with lots of offers of deliverers and poster sites - things are looking up for Conservatives in Kingston & Surbiton, despite what they say nationally.  Saw a really rather idiotic article in the Sunday Telegraph claiming that the reason the Princess of Wales fountain was not working was that some people were not treating it as a memorial but as an item of fun and allowing children and dogs to paddle causing dirt and some such. If the thing was a memorial why did they not take into account that litter might get into it. Which fool allowed them to design a monument that could be clogged by rubbish!!  The American elections are going to be very interesting and there is a very thoughtful piece about John Kerry in today's Sunday Telegraph that really stood out as exposing the mess that Kerry has got himself in over Iraq. Despite the press I understood where Michael Howard was coming from with his "..if I knew now about what I was told then I would not have voted for it position" but Kerry's position is bizarre...click   urlLink  here    and it should take you there.
