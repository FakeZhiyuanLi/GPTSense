      I needed to post something on this blog so I thought for a moment and that always leads to something. At the end of my pondering I decided to touch on Unions. Why not? The union has left a sour taste in my mouth on more than one occasion so I thought I would lash out at it today. Besides, an opinionated piece like this just may strike a chord with that straggler who wonders onto this blog some cold, rainy night and, agree or disagree, maybe I'll be able to coaxe a response from him/her and receive some sense of accomplishment for having set this blog up in the first place. I come from a long line of construction workers (pipefitters, ironworkers, etc.) My grandfather helped form the local pipefitters union and it was just expected of any male in the family to one day follow the same path. And, maybe I would have but by the time I reached employment age the union had so screwed itself with unrealistic demands and obnoxious whining that there were no union jobs to be found in my neck of the woods. Still, to speak bad of the union was considered blasphemy at family gatherings and on more than one occasion I heard the lecture on what the elders in my family did to make things better for me. And, I have to say that I respect them for that. They, and others like them, did do a lot to change the way workers are treated in this country. I applaud that. But, when at 24 years old, with a new wife and a $6.00 per hour job as a rodman on a surveying crew, I found myself being spit upon and cursed at for crossing a ridiculous picket line, I saw the other side of the union and it turned my stomach. Suddenly, those days of delivering supplies to my father while he stood on picket lines (as a child tagging along with my mother), seemed far less admirable than it did at the time. I remember picturing my father and the rest of his cohorts as heroes of some sort and, who knows, maybe they were. I was too young to remember now what the picket lines were about. But, as an adult, facing it head on, all I could do was wonder if those picket lines of long ago were just as misguided and nasty as the one I had to cross. I suppose I should explain the circumstances of this picket line (Not that you care but...). Basically, a government contractor was building a Federal prison in my community and the crew I worked on was one of the first on the scene. We arrived to find marshland that needed to be cut into roads. We began the task of wading through the mosquito infested marsh, staking out property corners and proposed roads. We did this for several months with no one else on the job. Then, as with any project, the dozers began to arrive and the roads began to appear. Some months later the contractor began to bring in other sub-contractors from various crafts (concrete finishers, ironworkers, etc.). All continued along on an even keel. I more than earned my $6.00 per hour pay as I'm certain the other craftsman earned their pay as well. Then, on one bright Spring day, all hell broke loose on our peaceful jobsite. It seems that the sub-contractor which had been awarded the electrical portion of the job had decided to bring in some electrical workers from Colorado to do some of the work. In addition, the sub-contractor hired local electricians. Unfortunately, for the I.B.E.W (International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers) the $18.00 per hour payscale did not meet their union payscale rate. They wanted $22.00 per hour (if I recall correctly). The sub-contractor refused to cave in and the war began. I showed up to work the following Monday, as I had for almost a year, and I was greeted by a mile long stretch of picket signs and protestors. Immediately, the profanity began to fly along with the accusations that I was stealing these men's jobs. I never knew there were so many $6.00 per hour surveyors. The entire crew (3 people) was taken by surprise and may have even turned around and returned to the office but for the fact that our van was then hit with several sticks and the driver was spit on. With this, we decided that if these overgrown children were willing to fight for something that was never theirs in the first place, we were dang sure going to fight for what we knew had been ours from the beginning. The driver floored the old van and, surprisingly, the picketers chose to get out of the road. We went to work and I have never been more proud of myself than I was on that Spring morning. I may have gone against my upbringing but I would be bringing food home to a new wife and providing a roof over her head. These men, on the other hand, would visit the local Employment Office to pick up yet another unemployment check because they would rather live off a $6.00 per hour surveyor than swallow their pride, put on their boots, and go to work for a company that was willing to pay them a fair wage for an honest days work. To this day, I have no use for the I.B.E.W. I can't say this for all unions but I can say it about the I.B.E.W. As I said, I don't hate all unions and I don't despise anyone who happens to be a part of union in order to earn a living for their family. If being forced to a join the union to put food on your table is what it takes then, by all means, go for it. I also realize that American workers sometimes need representation when confronted with certain demands and working conditions. But, when a worker who's pulling in $65,000+ per year in an auto plant, with excellent benefits and more breaks than any human being should be allowed in a day, goes on Nightline and gripes about a pay increase and improved benefits, all I see is someone who has lost touch with the reality of most other Americans and is willing to kick and scream until I wind up paying an extra $2,000 on my next vehicle purchase. Basically, I feel the unions, although full of lofty ideas, have missed the boat. Their arguments avoid the reality of the situation. It's really simple. Our economy is driven by entrepreneurs, people willing to take a gamble and hang out a shingle. These people then find other people not brave enough to do the same thing and pay them a wage that will allow the company to prosper so that the entrepreneur can actually benefit from his/her willingness to gamble. If the employees feel they deserve more money, they have every right to approach the entrepreneur and make said request. If the entrepreneur says no, then they have every right to seek employment elsewhere. If they have no acquired training in another occupation, they will most probably earn close to the same salary with their new employer, since the new employer (entrepreneur) is in direct competition with the former employer and has to therefore charge similar rates for his/her services in order to remain competitive. Unfortunately, when these employees finally decide that they deserve more for their skills, they form unions and attempt to force the entrepreneurs to give up more of the benefits of their willingness to gamble so that they (despite their unwillingness to take the same gamble) can receive the same compensation for their toils. Eventually, the entrepreneurs give in to the demands and the next thing you know, employees are taking 12 coffee breaks a day and refusing to do anything that could be even remotely construed as "not my job" and the clients of the entrepreneur begin to suffer the consequences. Therefore, in addition to the extra $2,000.00 I pay for my next vehicle, I will also pay more for everything else I desire or need just to keep the union members in the latest fashions. This is hogwash. I say, shut up and accept the salary your given or do one of two things:  1) Start your own business. That's what your employer (entrepreneur) did. He/she realized they would never achieve their version of the "American Dream" while working for someone else and so they rolled up their sleeves and did what it took to get them in a position to hire you to do their work for them. Your employer is not evil. Your employer took advantage of an opportunity and seized it. If you don't want to work for him/her then do the same. 2) Change careers. And, I don't mean find some government program to help you change careers. I mean when you get home at night and your dog tired from a long day at work, suck it up and stay up late to learn a new skill. I mean turn off the TV and acquire the necessary skills to lift yourself beyond the situation your in. And, on Saturday, instead of sleeping in or going to the beach, attend a workshop, take a class or volunteer with a company that specializes in the field you are seeking to get into so that you can gain the experience you need to make the change. To put it simple, take charge of your life and improve your situation on your own.  Just to be clear here. I realize unions have been largely responsible for bringing safety to the forefront for American workers and I applaud that. That's what unions should do. My own father, a union pipefitter, lost his life to leaukemia at the ripe old age of 36 due to unsafe working conditions in the refineries that dot the landscape that I call home. And, unions have helped paved the way to safer working environments for American workers so that this won't happen to another father of three just trying to make ends meet. I say thank you to the unions for accomplishments like this but I also say, don't ruin it for the rest of us by forgetting that having a job is a priviledge, not a right. Quit whining and realize how good you've got it now, because of those people who pioneered the effort. Don't make a mockery out of all they did for you by taking advantage of companies and industries that bend over backwards to provide you with benefits and services far beyond that afforded to most American workers.    There, I've tackled unions. I could go on but I'll leave it at that. After all, I can't spend all of my time working on this blog. If I did, I would probably lose my own job. Hey wait, maybe there's a union for Bloggers. I'll check on that!

      This blog is an attempt to convey my thoughts and, more importantly, give me a place to vent. I grew up in a home where "Republican" was a bad word. I, like most folks, grew to adopt the same beliefs as my parents/grandparents, etc. but, as I grew older, I found many of these beliefs lacking. This ultimately led to my abandonment of the good ole' Southern Democrat philosophy I had thrust on me as a child. I suppose the exodus was in part due to the fact that, despite what I had been taught, I didn't achieve the grand "American Dream" on the back of the donkey, nor did anyone else in my family. Oh, they may think they did but, in actuality, they achieved everything through their own hard work and determination. My grandmother preached the party line but she also told me that it was up to me to make something of myself. The contradiction was obvious, even to a child. On one hand, the government, in the form of a patriotic donkey, was going to provide me with opportunities, but, on the other hand, I was ultimately responsible for what I became. Well, I learned at a young age that the first hand was a wish but the second hand was the cold hard truth. A man is what he makes of himself (or herself to be politically correct, not something I care to do most of the time). And, the harder I work and the more I struggle, the less sympathy I have for those who don't. The more I try to make a better life for myself and my family, the angrier I get when I see someone else living off of my hard work. I grew up poor, not poor in the sense that I had to wonder where my next meal was coming from but, poor in the sense that family vacations were camping and zoo trips rather than Disneyworld and European vacations. In other words, I grew up "poor" in the same sense that most Americans grew up poor. And, I loved it. I may not have realized it at the time but I wouldn't trade it for anything. I am a rightwinger because I've been given that label. And, if part of being a rightwinger means believing that it is not the government's responsibility to guide me down the path to the "American Dream" but rather, to stay the heck out of my way so I can get there myself then I wear the label proudly.

      So, I'm blogging, sort of like jogging but without the sweat. I will ignore any illusions of grandeur here and just assume that maybe some late night, some forgotten soul will stumble onto this sight and read at least one post before turning off his/her machine and stepping back into reality. I probably won't change the world but, what the heck.
