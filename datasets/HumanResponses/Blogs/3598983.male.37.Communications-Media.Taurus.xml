      I find myself at a cross roads. It's been quite awhile since I started posting on the ooze.   When I first got here, I would quickly call myself an "Orthodox" Christian. Now I find I'm just a "Christian"  A couple of thoughts.  First, I've been meditating on this verse:  1 Samuel 15:23 "For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idol-worship"  Why does God equate rebellion with Witch Craft? What is the Craft? The manipulating and bending of reality to suite the practitioner. Seeking to re-create reality so that it benefits ME. Okay, if that is so, now my understanding is growing. Seeking power for myself. To use for and by me to benefit me.  More and more sense. Leadership is supposed to mean, influence what we see it meaning in the Instituional Church is Control. So, if I am seeking to amass, degrees, power, control, to benefit myself (all the while saying I'm doing it for the Kingdom) how is that any different than a witch invoking the 4 watch towers to close the circle so that he's safe during an invocation/incantation? How is that different than selfish praying? It's not. Thus, Rebelllion is the sin of WitchCraft. Wanting my own way, and amassing power to get it.  Also, I've given up on Tradition, cause for the most part I see it as something used to support extra biblical things, things that can be distractions....and are for the most part just Religious Recipes for Getting My Act Together. I abandon them all.   The first step in any good 12 step program is to admit that we are 'powerless' i.e., 'helpless' that there is nothing we can do to restore ourselves to health and sanity. Nothing. To me, this is the Gospel of Grace. Christian and Religion are diametrically opposing terms.  Religion is us trying to add to the finished work of Christ. It is us trying to find some religious recipe for being better than we can ever hope to be, and somehow merit the Kingdom of Heaven, which Christianity says to us is a Free Gift in Jesus Christ.   Sigh. Well there you go. Comments? Questions? Objections? I desire them all.  Peace.  Seraphim Raphael de'Angelo

      My Lamentation.  At the ninth hour Jesus Cried:  Eloi, Eloi, Lama Sabachthani?  And then He died.    Later a soldier with a lance pierced His side.  Some days I want to take up His cry, and say,   Why have you forsaken me?  What is this blessing given to those of us who believe, and cannot see?  I must confess, I often fail the test, and long to touch  The nail scars in your hands and feet  To see the side that bled  Water to cleanse me and blood the color of red  That has washed me what as snow  The closest I got was baptism, and communion, I know….  I believe in your promises, I love your Word, but you’ve got to know even though  I know your arms hold me, I long to lay my head upon your chest  And hear your heartbeat.  And while I try to follow your admonitions  I long to sit at your feet.  I’m sick to death of religion, and us trying to get it right.  When often we take up positions and instead of love we fuss and fight.  This is a Sunday morning, and nowhere I have to go…  Who can feed me with the Words of Life?  Who can comfort me with your healing touch?  Oh how I wish you now would return, I’m weary of this world you know this is so.  I want to see you, feel your hand in mine.  I want to touch you, feel you wipe the tears from my eyes.  I want to be in your presence, and be delivered from the world of death and fear  Oh Jesus my God, my God I wish you were here!  Deliver me from myself, and those I hold dear.  Lead me into the paths of righteousness, my soon coming prince of peace, satisfy me with yourself  For I believe only then, will my lamentation cease.

      I was not wanted at birth.  My mother was 15 years old when an older married man she was with got her pregnant.  I was the result of that union.  I was given up for adoption at age 3 and taken in by my mother's Aunt & Uncle.    Later, after my (adopted) dad passed away, it ws made known to me that I was adopted so that the 'problem' (me) would be kept in the family.  I believe that knowing that I wasn't wanted (and I believe I knew this in the womb) has led me to fear my being 'accepted' in Heaven.    Luke 12:32 is a great comfort to me:   Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom   Something else that was very healing, is this 'excerpt' that I want to post this, it is from a book by Henri Nouwen.   urlLink Inner Voice of Love  is the book.     Know That You are Welcome   "Not being welcome is your greatest fear. It connects with your birth fear, your fear of not being welcome in this life, and your death fear, your fear of not being welcome in the life after this. It is the deep-seated fear that it would have been better if you had not lived.  Here you are facing the core of the spiritual battle. Are you going to give in to the foreces of darkness that say you are not welcome in this life, or can you trust the voice of the One who came not to condemn you but to set you free from fear? You have to choose for life. At every moment you have to decide to trust the voice that says, "I love you. I knit you together in your mother's womb" (Psalm 139:13).   Everything Jesus is saying to you can be summarized in the words "Know that you are welcome." Jesus offers you his own most intimate life with the Father. He wants you to know all he knows and to do all he does. He wants his home to be yours. Yes, he wants to prepare a place for you in His Father's House."     Peace!

      "One day I was dreaming, or I had a vision, it really doesn’t matter which, for I know it was of the Lord. And in the dream, I was alone in a dark place, and I was afraid. Yet I didn’t want to go out into the Light.  So the Light came to me.  I saw Jesus walking through the darkness. He stood before me, and I turned away. “How can you love me, Lord?” I asked. “Simple.” He said. “Watch and learn.” He reached out His gentle, nail-scarred hand; He reached it out and into my chest. He pulled out my heart, and showed it to me. It was black, as black as death, as black as sin. And sick, cancerous with worms and maggots and words cannot describe the ugliness of my own heart.  Again He said, “Watch.” He reached; He reached His other hand into His chest, and removed His own heart. It was perfect, golden, starlight and sunlight, snug there in the palm of His hand. He took it and placed it into the empty place inside of me, where my heart had been.  Then He did something even more wondrous. He took my heart, as black as sin and as black as murder, and placed it into His own chest. I could still see my heart in His chest. A look of infinite sadness and pain flashed over my Saviors face, and then His face, His body, shown brighter than the sun, the heart He had placed inside of Himself, my heart, started to shine, to glow, it was cleansed, washed clean, whiter than new-born snow.   “I love you.” Jesus said, “Because I have felt and lived your pain. I love you, because when I enter your life, I transform your heart, your very soul, until it is perfect and as pure as mine. I love you because I made you and I died for you. I love you, because now that I am in your heart, and you are forever in mine, you will begin to live for me, just as I died for you.”  He took my hand, and together we left the dark place."  by Seraphim Raphael de'Angelo

      Hey, my brothers and sisters.   I got this email from the priest at the church where I was going:  "Dear Seraphim  Glory to Jesus Christ!  Demetra sent this to me and thought it might be helpful to you. Let me  know how you are doing when you get a chance.   urlLink http://www.bright.net/~palamas/sgpmwb/Stories/2004-feb.html   God be with you  fr robert  St. Nicholas Orthodox Church"  Would a few of you read the story at the link, and tell me what you think the story is supposed to be telling me? I was disturbed, to say the least...especially by this part:  "Now after they were married, the young man never stepped into a church, neither would he commune, nor even make the sign of the Cross. This conduct was noticed by certain neighbors who said to his wife, “Know this well, that thy spouse is not a Christian.” Therefore, one day, she said to her husband, “I have the ill-feeling that thou art not a Christian, since so many Sundays and feasts have passed, and thou dost not go into the church nor thou make the sign of the Cross. I however, thinking that thou art a Christian, agreed to marry thee. If then thou wilt refuse to go to church with me, I want to be separated from thee.”  I'm looking forward to your feedback.  Peace  Seraphim R. de'Angelo      Seraphim  "however much we hate the law, we are more afraid of grace"  --Fr. Robert Farrar Capon (from "Between Noon and Three")

      There was a lazy monk.&nbsp; He didn't keep the hours (of prayer) and didn't fast (not that he was a glutton) and didn't attend all the services.&nbsp; But he was never mean, and eveyone like him.&nbsp; When it came his time to die, the other monks of the community gathered around his bunk, and he had such a look of serenity and peace.  The monks were concerned for the spirtual well being of their brother, whom they knew was lazy and hadn't always followed the rules of prayer nor attended the church service, and wondered at his composure.  Brother, one asked, how is it that you are at peace?&nbsp; Seeing that you did not lead a very strict life?&nbsp; You didn't fast, you didn't keep the rule of prayer, the hours, nor were you faithful in church service attendance, how is it then that you are facing your end and the Judgement in peace?  the monk answered.&nbsp; Brothers, while all that you say about me is true, I will share with you my secret.&nbsp; One day while praying and reading the scriptures, I came across the passage,   "Judge not and ye shall not be Judged"&nbsp;   So while I have not done the things you have stated, I've also strived and meditated and sought with all my heart to love my saviour and never Judge my brother.  Shortly after saying this, he passed away, and the room was filled with a beautiful fragrance.  May we seek to live like this Monk.  I'shalom  Seraphim

      1 Corinthians 8:1 says this:   "But concerning the sacrifices to idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but love edifies. "   I am struck by this verse today.&nbsp; Having recently been brought to an awareness of my faults, by the Holy Spirit (and a few friends)...&nbsp; God brings me here.   Knowledge puffs up, but love edifies..   edifies?&nbsp; what does that mean?   from dictionary.com:   "To instruct especially so as to encourage intellectual, moral, or spiritual improvement."   ah!&nbsp; So if I put love first, it can encourage intellectual, moral and spiritual improvement, while if I seek to exalt myself, or seek to operate out of my flesh, my  Knowledge  (base) it puffs me up.&nbsp; Not in a real way, but in a prideful yes, even satanic I Will (isaiah 14:13) kinda way.   which doesn't benefit me or those I hang with, virtual or otherwise.   The beauty of the Christian life is that at any point, at any place, at any time....   we can start over.&nbsp; We can admit our helplessness, ask forgiveness, and return to the one true foundation.   Jesus.&nbsp; We can seek to understand and be understood.&nbsp; Cut loose the baggage, and with Paul,   "Forget those things which are behind, and pressing on towards the mark...."   so, I'm starting over.&nbsp; Pressing towards the mark.   I'shalom   Seraphim   &nbsp;

      I worked 16 hours yesterday, from 3pm to 7am this Thursday Morning.  Got home about 8am and sound asleep.  I tell you, the bed on a morning like today, is almost like a narcotic, there is not a feeling to match laying your body down when you are tired like that.  I sat with a gentleman last nite, who had surgery.  He was confused, and thought we had him in jail...and we had better let him go, so he could go to University of Virginia Medical Center to have his surgery!  (often when someone has just had surgery, they are confused for a couple of days, thus the need to sit with them, so they don't try to go home, etc...)  Anyway, he was a kind man, and it was good to be able to help him.  I was able to calm him down and help him sleep.    So I got home, like I said, and sleep like a baby, until about 12:30.  Woke, and discovered I had a visitor.  Joy.  A deep seated joy.  Peace, and Joy.  It was more than just being in a good mood.  It was more than just being happy.  But Joy.  A sense of feeling that no matter what, Jesus is well pleased with me, his sinful, struggling child.  that he takes Joy in me.  What an unexpected gift and surprise.  Joy is not a frequent visitor, I'm sad to say, but a welcome one today.  I attribute it to God's good will, and the prayers and love of my friends.  Joy  B'shalom  Seraphim

      Philo of Alexandria said that we should   " Be Kind to everyone you meet, for everyone is fighting a great battle."    I feel like I'm in one now.  I'm pretty broken today.   Our 20 year old daughter had an 'abnormal' ultra-sound. Cancer runs in our family. She see's the specialist on August the 2nd.  Our apartment's air conditioner broke, and flooded parts of the living room and the front bed-room.  and as Soon and I mean as  Soon as I got to work I was pulled to the supervisor's office.   They took my 'coach' position away from me, and wrote me up for 'not documenting correctly'...even though she then said, I know it's really busy up there.   I honestly think that the supervisor hasn't liked me for awhile now.  1, because I know computers, and she doesn't, and   2. cause I'm leaving her department to work for her supervisor in a Monday thru Friday 8-4:30pm gig. Where I'll report to her boss, and not to her.  It really hurt me. And it will be reflected in my year end evaluation. sigh.   Doing a good job is very important to me, and I try so hard. But this hospital is the lowest paying job I've had in awhile, and also one with the most politics.  I'm trying to hold on to the reality that when a man writes something about you that is not true, Heaven will not allow it to stand.  Posting this to ask for prayer, but to also discuss this 'broken-ness' thing.  The Psalmist says that God is near unto those who have a broken spirit and a contrite heart. In another place it says that a broken spirit and a contrite heart are acceptable sacrifices to God.  Why is that so? Is it that we are participating in the sufferings of Christ? (Philippians 3:10) Looking forward to hearing from you.   B'shalom  Seraphim

      Here is my conclusion on the matter.  I have abandoned the Institutional Church.  I believe that the Church is those at all times and all places those who Know Jesus and Jesus knows them. While I will occasionally visit a 'church service' I will seek instead to 'be the church' and live for Jesus.  I will accept the Bible as the sole basis of authority and final arbitrator in my life, and will lean on the coucil of some few trusted Christians. I will seek the guidance and instruction of the Holy Spirit, and as a rule believe what has always been believed at all times and in all places by all Christians.  I will take the view of worthies Like George when he said:  But it just confirms the feelings I had in my gut, particularly when I said things like " you can take the Protestant out of Protestantism but you can't take the Protestantism out of the Protestant." That you and I are restlous souls who won't feel at home this side of Heaven. We go out into new territory and we see the beauty in these lands and we learn. But we take what we learn and we move on. And in the next land we visit we can teach those of the beauty that we learned of in our previous journies while we learn of new beauty from them...  I will stick with the contention, as stated by Fr. Robert Farrar Capon that Christianity is a Relationship with the Risen Christ, and not a religion.  Love you guys.  Thanks again.

      I have been pondering this question and it has been weighing heavily on my spirit, in my heart and mind...I have some thoughts that I would like to share, that I have discovered, come to believe, that I got from a book called "The Mystery of Christ and why we don't get it...." by Fr. Robert Capon......thoughts are largely mine though. Hope that they help.    Grace . The Good News should be about grace, because the Good News is that the only Begotten Son of God became incarnate, lived and died the death I was due, and the life he lived along with his perfect death is now credited to me. That with Jesus in John we can say:    "This is the work of God,  that you believe on Him  whom He has sent. " (John 6:29)     But we usually only extend that grace on the first Sunday, when we applaud the Sinner who comes with the prayer of the Tax Collector in his pocket, but expect him,  once he becomes a Christian , to be able to  live and pray like the Pharisee in the parable by the next week...    This goes along with the tendency now to suppose that the way to train clergy to be good pastors and/or pastoral counselors is to give them some professional competence in what are usually called the 'helping' professions -- to make them trained psychologists, or knowledgeable hospital visitors, or family-system adepts, or twelve-step experts. I have no objection to such professionalization in and of itself, but I do think that in the rust to become professionals in fields that un-ordained persons are perfectly capable of handing, the clergy can and do often loose site of their principal competence as counselors -- of their calling to be authentic and authoritative proclaimers of the Gospel, the Good News of God in Christ!   Ordained persons are not commissioned to do certain things for the church that the rest of the church cannot or does not do. Rather, they are ordained as sacraments (best word I could use, sorry to go high church) or as signs to the church of what the whole church is commissioned to do -- namely, bear the apostolic witness to Jesus' death and resurrection. When you go into the pulpit on Easter Day, for example, you should not go as an expert on the scientific or theological possibilities of the resurrection. If you do your job correctly, you do not stand up there and tell the congregation that you have studied the subject and have come up with this, or that conclusion about it. Instead you arrive in the pulpit as the latest in a long line of runners, and you tell them very simply, but very authoritatively,  "Peter saw him risen...(pant, pant, pant).... and he told me to tell you."  Do you see? When you preach the Good News, you are first of all an apostle, not a theologian or any other king of learned person. (apostle means, primarily not just one of the 12, but someone who is Sent..)   But even then The Good News of what God has done for the world in Jesus, is the exact opposite of what most people, including a lot of preachers, think it is. They think it's some kind of religious recipe for getting their act together -- for solving their problems or straightening up their lives so that God will approve of them and they can approve of themselves. Above all, they think it's about getting rid of the problems of evil and guilt -- about doing something to avoid being judged, whether by God, or by others, or by themselves. But the Gospel isn't anything like that. That's all perfectly intelligible stuff the world has been capable of telling itself --and of driving itself nuts with because none of it is really possible. It's all BAD NEWS not Gospel. Religious recipes seldom get anybody's act together -- and they never get it to the point where it can't be messed up in some new way. Problems that get solved are just replaced with new ones that may never get solved. Approval depends on the approver, not on anything the approvee does: if the approver's standards are high enough, approval never comes. And as far as evil is concerned, whatever it is that God has done in Jesus, he certainly hasn't taken evil out of circulation.   Furthermore, on the face of the Gospel it seems that God isn't the least bit interested in any of that intelligible but pointless stuff. Instead he waltzes into the world and makes the weird announcement that he's simply dropped the whole business. He says he's come not to judge but to save. He says not that he's going to deal with guilt but that because of what he's done, there just isn't any guilt left. He says you can't deal with evil by resisting it, only be forgiving it. He says, in other words, that the whole of the world's habitual way of operating in those departments is upside down. And he says that in Jesus he's made a whole new right-side-up world -- and that that's the only real world, the only one that can be a lasting, happy place.   Our problem of course, is that we're so used to standing on our head, that when he shows up, we think he's the one who's upside down. If the Gospel is proclaimed correctly, therefore, it's always going to sound nuts to us. As a matter of fact, it will always sound wrong, immoral, and threatening to all the values we know and love even though they're killing us.  We want a recipe for righteousness and sanctification, not to be told if we believe in Jesus it is done.  Not that according to God, even as I struggle with the left over flesh nature, according to him,  I'm already seated in the Heavenly Places with Christ.    That and that alone should be the taproot of what it is to be a good evangelist and or pastor. That and that alone should be the reason that anyone is ordained. So that you can proclaim, Christ has died, Christ is Risen, and Christ will come again!   Another way would be to look at the Gospel as Jesus is the Ticket Master at a Stadium called Heaven, and all we have to do is get the ticket from Jesus and then we can go inside and join the party.... but what is most often presented is that Jesus runs the light company, and has paid the initial installment, but now we are on the monthly plan, complete with access fees (lots of good deeds) to be paid before you can tap into his power, and the threat of a cutoff in service if you didn't keep up the monthly payments with righteous acts.   Again, I know this is alot, but it was really quite a freeing conclusion to come to...and the book ("The Mystery of Christ and why we don't get it...." by Fr. Robert Capon.) is very good....and if there is any truth in this post, it is probably just me regurgitating Fr. Capon.   Peace on your Journey.   LOVE4THEWORD Seraphim de'Angelo
