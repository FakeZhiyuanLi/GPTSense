      yes, go Mates Of State.    Tomboy    urlLink   What's your sexual appeal?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla     Hot, eh?  I somehow rekindled a friendship with Mike whom I have not like really talked to in quite a while.  It was a nice afternoon then.  And I watched some of Doctor Zhivago, bleary-eyed of course.

      "Take Me Out" can make me shake my ass but it doesn't particularly improve my mood today. I don't feel like explaning the whole Jack/Lee situation on this blog, as I might still talk to them today.  The funny thing is...when I try to talk to them about issues they get irritated.  So yes.  No more on that. Fuck.  I don't really feel like commenting on any of my current friendships.  People just don't like me as much as they used to.  Kind of disheartening.  I'm actually looking forward to work.  I've been sitting here since 8:00, because no one wants to hang out with me.  My dad was back for a day and he left again.  I think everyone is coming back home tomorrow.  A month ago, I was planning on having parties and such while they had been gone.  Who could I have invited?  Everyone's all going to the Taste Of Chicago and such tomorrow night and happy fireworks or a Blood Brothers concert Sunday night.   And I decided I am officially in a shell.  I never deserved the friends I had anyway.  Farewell.   I wrote this on my Florida trip, inspired by the fantastically personable Sorcha:   *Interesting Phenomena* Things not verbally brought up I just seem to realize. There is only one true way to be divine. Brooding walks, others, and wailing cries. The distance from the elbow to the shoulder. You plot the male's ultimate demise. You're not my champion. Go on a brooding walk and cry. Blink or think to miss the snap. It only takes a second but I always need a map. The blinding white light. For a flash. It doesn't matter, impossible to think. Wrapped. Pushed in past breaking point. Breaking point. Breaking point. Breaking point. Breaking point. Breaking point. Breaking point. Breaking point. Breaking point. You seek acceptance but from who? Aggressive anti-socialists break through. Where are they? Wrapped. I wrestle them into the corner And wince pushing shoving my Bed over the tops. Where are they? Huh - where are they? I used a towel. Which are they? I'm ill, I've thrown up twice. Slamming into the rays. WHICHES ARE THEY? Brush up. Each dart you flung broke in two. So which are they? Where are they?  If you know nothing of 'The DaVinci Code' the previous will make no sense.  Hope everyone is having a fabulous day!!!!!!!!!!
