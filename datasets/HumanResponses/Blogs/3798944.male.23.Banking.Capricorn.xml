      Isn't it great?  Too bad it doesn't last though.  I think it's comical that they actually sell "new car scent".  I have a secret though, I know what it is... do you want to know?      Armor All Protectant Wipes       Scotchguard      Don't believe me?  In the right proportions, this will give you a near-new car scent.  I say "near-new" because it's a neat word... say it...  near-new ... did you hear how you sound when you said that?  Say it three times fast...  near-new near-new near-new .  Feel kinda like  Mork ?  Seriously, I dont think you ever obtain the absolute NEW car smell if the parts themselves arent actually new.  But the above will give you a very close approximation... you'll know the moment you open your door.  First be sure that your carpets and plastics are vacuumed and dirt/dust free (wipe down the plastics then get to work with a shopvac).  Just be sure when you scotch guard... not to get it on any of the plastics or instrumentation.  I personally get a shop towel and/or a piece of cardboard.  Butt the cardboard up against any plastic trim etc. while you spray, remember... less is more.  Use the shop towel to clean up any that might have made its way onto your plastics.  Be sure you give this 24 hours to set up, and I also recommend cracking the windows open slightly to help it along.  After that, use   Armor All Protectant Wipes   on all all of your plastics (save for plastic lenses, such as the instrument cluster, radio-face, etc.).  It wont smell new right away... but an hour or two after you've been away from it... and the scents have had a moment or two to get to know eachother... you'll open the door and go... "near-new near-new near-new".  I will then use   Armor All Glass Wipes   to finish up the plastic lense of the instrument panel, the windshield, and any chrome/billet aluminum things I have.  In my case, my rear view mirror, climate controls, HURST shifter.  Heres a secret about glass-wipes... they HAVE to be mild... and they CAN'T leave a resedue... otherwise, they wouldnt be good for glass, right?  So... here's what I do... I use them on everything!  Inside the car, even in the engine compartment... wipe it down with one of these... and you're good to go.  No streaks, no grease... all clean parts.  Don't believe me?  Give it a try...     Bruce Bonebrake, eat your heart out.

      I awoke this morning with a headache.  I think it might be because I slept a couple hours... woke up and talked to Jodi, and went back to sleep for the remainder of the night.  Why is it that getting a little extra sleep affects me like this?   Annoying.   Well... I was just hijacked by a woman here to call her husband at home and help him fix his computer... I don't really mind.  It's difficult to troubleshoot an XP system while I'm working on Windows 2000.  It's even more difficult when you figure that XP looks totally different for each user.  I can guarantee how I have my system set up is a 180 from how most people have their system set up.  I feel like wearing a shirt that says  "No, I will not fix your computer" ...hahaha.  I dont think I would do it if she wasnt such a nice lady.  Okay... I lied... I'm compelled to fix things and hate it if I can't figure something out.  In other news,  J.Gordon  is on the pole this weekend... talk about a streak!  That's his 3rd bud-pole in a row!  They fined  Tony Stewart  for his actions after the race at Infineon Raceway.  I have mixed feelings about this.  NASCAR is in shambles right now.  Tony's actions took the media's eyes somewhat off of the HUGE mistakes that they have been making lately.  He's just trying to help NASCAR out baby!  Racing is inherently a difficult sport to police, so I can't fault them for having problems with it.  I do however have problems with them making changes in mid-season.  You dont see the NBA or the NFL changing rules right in the middle of things.  I propose they have an off-season race or two.  These races would be televised and allow attendee's.  NASCAR will use these races to test new rules that could possibly go into effect the next season.     Quit using the season for your reasearch and development!      I kill jack.

      That is the constant reminder I am given every morning.  You see, my brother Jon insists on knocking on my door early in the morning... signing "work", and then signing "money".    So far everything is fine today.  I was a wee bit tired this morning but not too bad.  I watched more of the Cassini mission coverage this morning before I left for work, gotta love that NASA channel on DirecTV. I hated having to leave, I actually ended up 7 minutes late because of it.  Well, actually, I had to get gas before I could make it to work too...which is a whole other story...  I brought an engine magazine in to read on my down-time here at work.  I dont know why I do that, because I never feel comfortable enough to actually read it.  The articles that I do read, I only absorb a small portion of because I'm constantly looking away to make sure everythings taken care of.  Maybe at lunch...  Lunch today consists of one half tomato and a carb bar, supplimented with a caffein free/sugar free beverage.  As you can see, I've started making myself lunches.  'Nuff said...  Is it wrong to force a co-worker to work?  I received a fax addressed to my team... wrote this persons name at the top... photocopied it... and left it on her desk for her to do (the photocopy makes it look like it was faxed with her name on it already).  Was that wrong?  I dont know... I dont think so.  About time she did  something .  Are my blogs too long?  I know, they are.  That's alright I suppose.  Jodi hasnt called me this morning... And I havent called her as I wanted to give her plenty of time to sleep because she's been pulling these big shifts.  I hope everythings alright.  What's the deal with woman and sunglasses?  I bought a pair of Rayban's a couple months ago... I wear them when I go on road trips (they helped a lot on my offroad trip to Signal Peak, they're polarized and cut down on the glare from the hood and windshield).  This morning I wore them from home to work... with my new haircut (courtesy of Jodi), and my set of shades on... I got  big smiles  from soooo many women.  It's an obvious difference from when I dont wear them.  I get smiles just fine on my own but today they seemed to have an extra glint of suggestion behind them, rather than the 'courtesy smile' you do when you're passing someone in a hall.  I know it makes a difference because even my own mother said "Keep your shades on, you look better".  Which made me think... "Did she just put me down?".  It didnt stop on the way to work either, I had three women say good morning or hello on the way to my desk. I suppose I should get back to work...    Another day, another dollar.

      I just finished watching my second NASA "event" if you will.  The first one I watched was back in January when the MER's landed on Mars.  I missed  Spirits  landing in early January, but I watched  Opportunity  land.  Well, maybe not watch it land on Mars... but watched  urlLink NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , as the spacecraft descended onto the planet.    I must say that I found the Cassini spacecraft landing to be more entertaining.  I feel some remorse over that because I believe a terrestrial landing... would be much more complicated than getting a satellite captured by a HUGE planet.  But I digress.  The whole event seemed to go off without any problems.  It appears to be a text-book  Orbital Insertion .  I watched as the craft moved through the rings of the great planet, causing the doppler shift chart to go erratic and the NASA commentators to cut to an interview.  The mission to Saturn took almost 7 years.  The spacecraft traversed 2 billion miles before settling into a " scientific vantage point " in orbit with the planet, where it will spend its next 4 years sending valuable scientific data back to earth for analyses.   The data sent back from the spacecraft low-gain antenna was enough to calculate doppler shift and the commentator did an excellent job of showing animations and charts that approximate where the craft was.  I found it interesting to see the doppler shift chart go nuts as Cassini slipped passed the F and G rings, as it turned around and started its 96 minute engine burn.  The Cassini-Division, the large gap in the ring that you are no doubt familiar with if you have ever seen Saturn through a 6" or larger aperture telescope, was absolutely stunning in the high resolution photographs they were using as diagrams.  As the spacecraft flew passed the rings, and the line of sight from earth to the craft lined up with the gap (Cassini-division)... the signal came through loud and clear!  We have two functioning exploration rovers on Mars, and we are now in orbit around Saturn.    What a great time to be alive.

       urlLink Fed seen raising rates for first time in four years - Jun. 30, 2004     Well... here we are... so far rates are pretty good.  I came in to an improvement over yesterday of about .375 on fixed products... that's a significant improvement.  After being here for a few minutes... they announced that we would be improving our pricing by .25 on fixed and .125 on arms....  Wow !  I can only think that we are going to worsen products  AFTER  he makes his announcement at 11:15 PDT.  We'll see...  On another note, I've decided to re-learn HTML and CSS.  Thanks to this web page.  I figure a lot has changed since I've worked in this arena... so I'm looking forward to it.  I'm used to reading multiple books at the same time... all non-fiction of course... so I've decided to throw in an HTML/CSS book... and I've also decided to read a mandatory amount each day.  Oh, and I'm thinking of doing some programming again.  So I must say, This whole blog thing has sparked some creative interest.  I find myself wondering what little tweaks I can do to make the page look more interesting... or to add some functionality.  I set up a tag applet on here earlier... but removed it because I thought it looked tacky with my layout.  I like the simple dark colors... makes the user focus on the taste of the words, rather than the glitzy candy shell of presentation.  There, I've said my little esoteric piece for the day.

      Well... Since  urlLink Jodi's  getting into the whole Blog thing ... and I'm bored right now... I have decided to start a little blog page here at blogger.com.  I'm not too sure what I will publish here but I am interested in the possibilities.  I have always started my own websites... but torn them down... I'm a stickler for a great Nav. Scheme and get very irritated if it doesnt come out clear and concise.  Which is bad... it would be much better if I would at least publish the darn things before I shoot them down... oh well.. if all goes well... there might be a ReelFast.com after all (I suppose I should check to see if that domain name is available... but this is all for fun anyway, so we'll just pretend).  Anyway... on with the show.

      Let me tell you what's pissing me off lately.    People not doing their friggen job!    I'm a pricing coordinator... It's my job to price out loans based on the risk that the bank is taking.  I take a base price that the bank publishes, and adjust it accordingly for the risk.  In other words, I lessen the amount of money that the broker will make if it's risky.  I also answer general loan questions and if I cannot answer the question, I determine who can, and route the call to where it needs to go.  There isn't anything worse than having to talk to a broker 3 times, because moron won't answer their call.  It detracts from what I do, and it makes for a crappy customer experience.   --end rant--   So I finished the tree thing last night... neighborhood pickup is today.  I fell out of said tree... I didnt  fall fall , like break my ass fall... I landed on my feet.  I call it a fall because a stupid branch got caught on my lower back and tore me a nice 2 foot long scratch.  Oh well, at least it doesnt sting anymore.  Friday is finally here.    HELLO WEEKEND  !  I don't know why I look forward to weekends so much lately.  I think it has to do with the fact that I have no sick leave left, and it's only July.  That and I have no vacation left save for the one that I've already scheduled in September.  Yup, I can look at a calendar and pretty much guarantee that if I'm not dead, I'm at work M-F.  On another note, a friend that I used to work with emailed me.  She's getting a divorce and just wanted to talk.  Turns out that Mr.Divorced has been beating her.  Apparently he waited for her outside her house and assaulted her in the front yard last week.  I can't believe people sometimes.  It's sick to think of the stuff that goes on out there.  Makes me wonder if their kids are alright.

      Yesterday after work I immediately went home and started working on the yard for 'neighborhood pickup day' this Friday.  It wasn't that bad of weather for doing this kind of work.  It was warm, yes, but not hot.  I have a little left to do today but it shouldnt be too bad, just some clean up work to the pruning that my father did in the tree... which reminds me, I wanted to look at chainsaws at homedepot...   After I finished all of that, Jodi picked me up and we went shopping.  We went to Bestbuy and picked out something for  urlLink Jeff .  Trying to figure out something to buy this guy is very difficult because he doesnt have many simple interests... kinda like me in some ways I suppose.  Anyway, after that we went to dinner at good ol' Denny's.  The service kind of sucked but the lady was really nice about everything and the food was decent.  We went home and veg'd for a minute or two, and then I forced us out for a bike ride.  We rode about a mile or so, not very far but it was fun.  Jodi needs to build up her stamina, she gets her leg's burning very quickly, and can't keep her speed up.  She'll get better soon because I'm going to keep on her about it... the first few weeks... ride probably 2-3 times a week... nice and simple... after that, we're going to start stepping it up.  Right now we're still in the adjusting phase, where we need to adjust the bike to better fit her.  My bike is pretty much squared away but I want to get a heart monitor/cyclometer to monitor my progress.  We'll see.  Yesterday they sent emails out to everyone asking them to report to the Feather River room (all the conference rooms here are named for rivers or other body's of water), or some other alternate room.  Depending on which one you were called to... you were either told that they were laying some people off... or that they were laying YOU off.  I was in the  *safe*  room.  They laid off a bunch of people.  I wouldn't call it a straight up "lay-off" though, it seems more like they were told to cut back on the work force and they "trimmed" the under-performers.  The person that I've historically had problems with at work is now gone.  I must say that it is everything I thought it would be. I know that sounds mean, especially when I step back to look at it from my readers' stand point, but my readers haven't worked with this woman.  This evening I will finish up my tree work and read another chapter of Algebra (I neglected to mention that I'm studying mathematics again from pre-al up to calculus).  If there is time, im also going to read some more web developement material and more of my physics book... I really need to learn how to speed read.

      Here we are, Wednesday.  That's pretty cool I guess, since I didn't have to work Monday.  So far this morning I haven't felt too good, upset stomach.  I think it's from the spicy hot wings I ate last night, I really should just cut that out of my diet all together.  Hot wings are just so good though!  We have the  Neighborhood Pick-Up  thing this Friday.  Which in case you don't know, is when you put out all of the stuff you don't want anymore out on the curb, for the dump trucks to come and cart off for you.  Things like Lawnmowers, broken dishwashers, wood, clippings, etc... pretty much anything that you would have to take to the dump personally because it doesn't fit in your garbage can.  So, of course, my mother wants me to tear everything up in the yard... prune the tree's... cut back all the branches... get rid of the wood pile I started from when I tore down the shed and the patio over-hang.  Fun.  I've been thinking about this Detroit trip... Jodi informs me that they dont have internet access over there.  I dont know about this.  I haven't been without net access in years.  I wonder if I'll go through withdrawls.  Probably, since I'm already thinking about it!  I did set up Audioblogger for the site... so I will be providing updates with my cell phone... now the question is, do I bring my laptop at all?  I'm thinking no, if I dont have net access... what's the point?  I average around 60 pieces of email a day, about 55 of which are spam, so after 6 days * 60 letters = 360 letters/ 30 of which are good pieces of mail.   Back to the pit...

      Sorry I haven't been able to post for a few days... busy and all.  Work pretty much stinks right now, just because of the interest rate hikes and such.  But anyway, I just spent a fatty load of money at Southwest Airlines.  Yup, you guessed it... my vacation in September, I'll be going to visit Jodi's family in  urlLink  Detroit, MI  .  Can we possibly pick a more remote location? I doubt it.  I'm really looking forward to the flight.  Last time Jodi and I vacationed in  urlLink  Vegas  , and that was a very short flight but I thought it was fun.  I liked watching the shadows of the clouds trace over the land.  I was amazed to see that I could still make out relatively small objects from high above the clouds.  I could clearly see my house, yard, and fathers car in the driveway.  Oh, and the freaky part... was the way the wing kind of flexes up and down in the turbulence a good foot or so... I wasn't expecting that.  So now all that's left is to get a rental car that'll be there when we arrive. It's Detroit right?  Rentals should be cheap.  I plan on going to a few car museums... maybe doin a little camcorder/shutterbug action.  We'll see, Jodi has me paranoid about the "throwers", you know... the baggage handlers.  She even had me re-route our trip around Phoenix because apparently they're infamous for baggage loss.  I would hate for them to lose any of my electronics.  The only thing that scares me... is that I did a search for "Things to Do in Detroit"... and it came up with two response:      Henry Ford Museum      History of Henry Ford Tour      Do you think I'll get busted for packing an ear of corn in my luggage for Francine?  Probably violates some produce law... "Didja bring any produce? No?  Thank you, drive through."

      Happy July Fifth everybody.  Yesterday I spent most of my day under the hood of Jodi's car,  again .  Lets go down the list of new things on it thus far:     Torque Converter Control Solenoid    New Carburator Seal (FELPRO)    Four Quarts of Oil (Had to drain out over 7 quarts...)    Four Durso fork tipped spark plugs    Distributor Cap    Distributor Rotor    Water Pump    Ignition Wire Set    Camshaft Cover Bolts    New Coolant    Waterpump bypass hose    Starter motor    Timing Belt    Serpentine Belt (drive belt)    A/C belt (even though it no longer works    Black Froggy Seat Cover     Why did I have to drain 7 quarts out? Well, it's a question of technique really.  You see, when you check your oil with the engine oil dipstick... the engine must be cold, or have been sitting OFF for at least 10-15 minutes.  When the engine is running, the oil is where it needs to be... pumped up in the lifter valley, swashing around through the crank area. It is NOT in the oil pan.  And where does that dipstick go?  It goes directly into the oil pan to check the level of it.  So you see, if the car is still warm, that means gravity hasnt had a chance to pull the oil back down to the pan... so it will measure low almost every time (until you put way too much oil...).  Camshaft cover bolts?  Get this, after putting everything back together, setting the timing and the such, purchasing an Anaerobic Sealer for the camshaft cover which all together (it has a primer that needs to be applied first) comes out to about $30 bucks... I have my bolts laid out, and my torque wrench set to 18 Ft/Lbs just like the manual says.  I figure I'll play it safe and torque them down to 10 Ft/Lbs and then go back and torque them down to 18.  What goes and happens?  The head off a friggen bolt breaks off.  Long story short, without that bolt the enginge was squirting oil out of the camshaft cover seal (it's an overhead cam).  They don't sell these bolts anywhere because #1, they're metric. #2 they have a fine thread pattern.  I found some similar ones at Kragen except they were way too long... I cut them down to the proper length with my Dremel.  So far, so good.  Yesterday I had Jodi go to the store after work to buy stuff for hamburgers.  "What do we need, honey?".  I told her to get some hamburger that was 15%-20% fat (yes, we're grillin fatty burgers!), some herb butter - if they have it and some fresh herbs and sticks of butter if they didnt.  So, she comes home as I'm finishing the barbecue set up (read: Light the fire) and does a great job parallel parking.  She then brings up the groceries and is showing me what she bought when she yells "o-Shhhhhh"... What's wrong? At this point you're asking yourself, what's this got to do with the car?  Jodi forgot to buy   hamburger   for our hamburgers... Anyway, she insists that she'll just run to the store and be right back.  So I say okay and bid her farewell.  She runs out the door and I go out the back sliding door to check on the fire.  I see her downstairs, she jumps into her car and goes to start it... twice.  All I hear is a loud CLUNK sound.   And then, as she's starring up at me ont he balcony all sheepishly... I see her try and turn the key again... it wouldnt start.  Long story short, Chaulk that list up to 2 starters... and probably a good 25+ hours under the hood of Jodis car.  Please dont break anymore... I can't handle the triple digit heat under the hood again.

       It's really just an issue of motivation, Bob.  If I work my ass off... I don't see another dime.   Today is Spirit Day.  So far, it has pissed me off because they blocked two full rows of parking... which means that since I normally park in the second to last row on the east... I now parked in the very last row on the west side.  They had some rally a few minutes ago but I chose to stay at my post and do my job.  Am I wrong?  It's not that I dont like rally's or anything like that.. but I don't get excited about stuff like this.  When all the hoopola is over, I'll still be two rows farther back, and in the same cubicle that I was yesterday.  And with all of the layoffs... what's the point?  Why not save some of the money that they spent on dunk tanks and food... and keep someone on for a while longer?  I've never been one to jump into the fray like these people do.  It doesn't amuse me like it does them.  I don't hold it against them or anything like that, just a simple difference.  What IS annoying is people that insist that I'll "have so much fun" doing things their way...  No Annie !  Leave me alone, do what you want... I'll do what I want.  I'll participate when I want to.  Anyway, no major upsets with the brokers this morning.  I figure it's going to be pretty quiet.  I ended up taking a big fatty underage to the bank this morning so that broker is happy (see  yesterdays blog ).  I got paid last night... that's good.  But get this, I check my account this morning... and there is a .01 charge from somewhere in IL!!!  What is that about!?  I havent called my bank yet, I think it might be something that I bought online and they're just checking funds... but I always thought they had ways to do that without it being issued to the account.  Right now it's a "pending transaction"... so we'll continue to monitor it through tomorrow... and then call the bank depending on what it is.  I hope nobody got my cc# somehow... I'll be so irritated.  I did my workout last night.  Even though I'm still sore from the squats that I did on Monday.  I still did my squats just with zero weight on the bar... I feel better today, only slight soreness.  I think if Jodi gets off in time and everything that we might go for a bike ride.  That sounds like fun.  This getting up early thing is kinda cool... I get up at 6:20, shower and get ready for work... then I clean the kitchen.  Yes, I clean the kitchen every morning... for the last two weeks at least.  And you know what I've noticed?  No complaining from my mother anymore.  I also have taken a liking to doing the backyard durring the week as opposed to weekends.  So now I do all the stuff I dont want to do durring the week and that leaves my weekends open for fun stuff!  Too bad my fun stuff partner normally works the whole time.  Anyway, before I start cleaning the kitchen I pour myself a cup of coffee.  That way by the time I'm finished, it's cooled enough that it wont scald my tongue into a rough piece of leather.  Once I'm done with all that, I just hang out with my dad and mom for a while.  This morning we went outside on our swings in the front yard.  It's amazing how fresh the air is in the morning... even here in  Sacramento .  I think I'll do that again tomorrow, everything seemed so peaceful and relaxed.  I guess my mom swings out there every day after I leave for work.  This weekend Jodi has Sunday off.  I think we're going to start the day biking around the American River Bike Trail.  Not very far I'm sure... but it should be fun.  After that I dont know what we're doing.  We've talked about going to s.f. but I'm not sure that there is anything to do there anyway... and I've got bills to pay so I dont really want to spend much money.  I was thinking of getting some seafood and grilling it (it'll cost less than driving to s.f. I'm sure).  Or maybe just staying home and smoking something... maybe make some pulled pork or something... I dunno.  Last time we were in Monterey, I had some smoked Salmon and it was pretty good.  I pretty much leave it up to Jodi to decide what to do most times.  And she kinda leaves it up to me... lol.  If we're up to it, I think we might bike from Watt avenue to old sac or something like that.  We'll have to wait and see.  I bet that there is a lot of people out there this weekend.  I'm anxious to see if anyone catches a Salmon... given that tomorrow is the Salmon opener on the Sacramento river.

       SUCKED!  I come in, and log onto the ACD line ( automated call distribution ... stupid since I'm the only one here to distribute calls to right now...) First call of the day...  MAJOR F UP !  I dont know who made the mistake... but it was someone on my team... I know it was  Jeff  or  Tou ... I just forget their userID's... UGH!  So I'm gettin ripped a new one... and all I can think about is " understand his pain... make it yours... figure it out... " How lame is that? Just hand me an Ikea catalog and put me to bed.  I know I'd be pretty friggen pissed off if I quoted my borrower 7.375%, when the final rate was actually 8.375% and nobody from the bank called me and told me.  And to top it all off... the borrower is an attorney.  When the broker locked online, it should have said plain as day " pricing fail, please contact a Bank of America representative "... which I'm sure it did... so they are partially to blame.  I don't buy that " The computer made a mistake "  B.S.   Computers don't make mistakes like that...  they just run programs .  Anyway, so I referred him to his Account Executive... because ultimately that's who's going to have to figure out a way to massage the system back down to the quoted rate... (read: take an underage to the bank) and I sent a request to secondary for pricing at the lower rate... I actually have to quote 5.750% since they have a 1.625% risk adjustment for the 80% first, 20% second program.   Yesterday Jodi and I went out for a little bit... we went to   Arden Fair Mall  .  I bought some tools... in case anyone is thinking of giving me a present,  Craftsman  is the way to go!  I'm easily amused by tools for some reason... I dont know... wood working or mechanical HINT HINT.  Anyway, back on topic:  They have a Bonsai store!?  I thought this was VERY cool.  Do I think they will make it?  No.  They don't sell any Bonsai tools, which was a disappointment to me... (see how I segued into that?) and their primary stock is Bamboo plants...  yeah Hiiiii ... Last time I looked... Bamboo is a  WEED  that Bonsai Masters do not work with.  I wouldn't mind one of those Bonsai kits that they sell on the web.  I actually looked into doing it for a while.  Selected the toolset that I wanted and everything... I found out that they actually have public workshops once a month here in town.  Anyway, long story short... I never got around to placing the order.  Some day.  It's weird having Jodi drive me around.  I'm not as nervous about it as I was before, she drives fairly well.  I find myself looking to the side and checking out buildings and stuff... where as before I might as well have been driving due to the level of attention I was giving her driving.  She has a tendency to drift a bit, and not think the situation through to its full extent... ahhhh to be a novice driver.  I dont know if me getting her a radio was a good thing or not... now I fear her driving into something/someone while looking at the face of it.  I know she's much more relaxed behind the wheel now though.  Previously she wouldn't even look away or take her hands off the wheel... now she's changing stations... changing cd's... has her hands in the TOTALLY WRONG possitions... which I still correct her on.  Anyway, she's making good progress.  Before you know it, she'll be driving me up to Signal Peak and using engine compression to drive us back down... ALL PRO.  I've been at work 51 minutes now... I've talked to 1 A$$hole and 3 nice people.  That's a 25% average for the day so far... I'll let you know how this average holds out.

      Here I am blogging at work.  Today has been a long day but it's about to get better.  I'm going out with Jodi later, so that should be fun.  Last night I started my Iron Man training program... basically a weight training regime constructed for beginners by the Iron Man muscle magazine.  I feel pretty good today.  I noticed that after sitting at my desk for a while... the soreness from the workout yesterday has turned into stiffness.... at least it goes away after walking a little bit.  Get this crap... I've gotten into an arguement with secondary today.   What/who's secondary you ask?   Secondary is the department/are the people that monitor the work I do to make sure that the bank isnt exposing itself...to make sure we're using prudent business practices and staying within guidelines.  Not the kind of people that a Pricing Coordinator wants to piss off.  Well, I went ahead and did it.  I know my calculations are correct... and I submitted the loan to them for review and approval and they keep turning me down.  Now guess what they did? They're doing the ol'  Japanese Lettuce Inspection  on it... What's that?  That my friends, is a bad movie quote in which they reference the inspectors leaving the lettuce on the dock to spoil before doing their inspection... so it is sure to fail by the time they get to it.  I have been waiting for a response from secondary on my submission for nearly 3 hours.    Get this, while writing my blog... I get a response from them... they failed it... again... and what did they say was wrong with it this time!?  They said that I forgot to put the cost of the extension in...  LISTEN UP MORONS... I'M REQUESTING A FREE EXTENSION!!!   How do you charge for something that's  FREE ???  This weekend Jodi and I are planning to do a little bit of bike riding.  I'm hoping to do a portion of the American River Bike Trail.  Last time we rode there... her pedal kept falling off... granted that bike cost a small fraction of what this bike went for... so I expect zero problems.  It's pretty cool because at Performance Bicyle they will tune the bike at no charge.  This includes all basic maintenance.  And I didnt notice that big of a price difference between them and their competitors.  The only issue that I have personally is that I like to work on stuff... so I'm torn between the whole DIY aspect, or take it in to the professional.  I think I'll let them do all of the initial adjustments but then eventually take that over for myself.  Anyway, I gotta get back to my argument with secondary.   UPDATE:  Secondary finally passed it! I've been working on this stupid lock for over 6 hours today!

      Yesterday I worked on Jodi's car again.  This time it was a creature comfort issue.  I bought her a  JVC cd/cd-r/cd-r/w/MP3/WMA Player  and planned to install it.  The installation went pretty well.  I had to take the dash off which was relatively easy, just a matter of having the right tools.  I was disappointed with the mounting bracket that crutchfield sold me.  Granted, they didnt make it, and granted it's an industry standard bracket for this type of car... but the attention to detail from whoever machined it just wasn't there.  They drilled the mounting holes off about 1/4", and it was supposed to come with 3 screws 1 clip, someone reversed that and gave me 3 clips and 1 screw.  So, of course, I had to go to the hardware store and get myself a couple of screws.  While I was in the dash I noticed that the antenna wire wasn't up to industry standards.  I had to go to pepboys (I hate pepboys) and buy an adapter.  Once I was done installing the radio... I put the dash back together and it was good to go.  I burned a few hundred songs onto a cd for her to listen to.  If you dont have an mp3/wma player in your car... I'd highly recommend it.  Even if you don't download music... you can rip the songs from your cd's into mp3 format... then store the original.  No more worrying about scratches etc.  If you scratch the disc you're using... just burn another one!  Feeling good about the installation I did on her radio, I decided to tackle the air conditioner.  You see, when the water pump went out before... it had a direct leak path to the a/c compressor.... so basically it flooded it out and burnt up the wires to it... so it was continually popping fuses.  I didnt bother to hook the a/c back up to the car (didnt connect the belt) when I put everything back together because I had every indication that it wasn't going to work at all.  Anyway, on a hunch, I cut the wires back at the bulk head, and spliced in my own.  I rewired everything that connects to the A/C and then worked the belt on there (that was no easy task).  Once everything was together, I fired her up and tested it out.... It's sooooooooooo cold!  You just GOTTA love Freon!  I just hope it doesnt get a leak or anything... then it will have to be converted to an R34A, and as most of you know... it wont be nearly as cold.  That was about it... I'm looking forward to Detroit.  I dont know if this countdown thing on my sidebar was a good idea though... seems to make it feel drawn out ;-)  I'm definitely looking forward to the trip though.  So much stuff to see.  I suppose I should make peace with Mike... I didn't make a big effort to befriend him last time I met him and I doubt I will now.  But I think I'll give him the benefit of the doubt.  I dont think Francine is ever coming back to Cali.

      It's 2:22 in the morning...Friday morning.  Jewel has woken me up 3 times now with her damned digging.  I have scolded her, put her in her play ball, and given her a time out.  If this keeps up... she's going to find herself at animal control real quick.  Tomorrow is going to be terrible... and I owe it all to my furry friend.  SOMEONE STOP THE DAMN DIGGING!

      Yesterday I didnt quite complete everything I wanted to do after work.  I did stick to weight training... which I was happy about, but I didnt go and buy materials to make my new work bench.  Oh well... that seems very much like a weekend job to me anyway.    Today has been interesting so far.  I woke up this morning around 4:30AM because Jewel was trying to tunnel through the plastic floor in her condo.  I was  furious!  I got up out of bed and smacked the side of the cage where she was and told her to be quiet.  Then I laid back down and there was silence.  For abour 3 minutes... and then she started again.  So I sat up in bed, weary from sleep... went over to her cage... smacked it again.. then put my hand in there and moved her away from the "digging spot" and patted her on the head a little... she flipped over on her back to play.  I went back to bed, and closed my eyes... and fell asleep to the sound of Jewels little nails digging to China.  Kids.  Weight training was fun as usual.  I think that I'd do much better if I had Jodi there though.  I enjoy things better when I have someone to share it with.  Take cycling for instance.  I could very easily ride by myself... but it's 10x more fun when Jodi's there.  Go figure.  We went for another ride around A.R. the other night... I think we need to get headlights because Jodi hit a branch that was in the road and it hit her knee a little bit.  She's alright, it just scared her I think and maybe scratched her a bit.  Anyway, just from the few rides that we've taken... I can see a drastic improvement in her riding!  I dont know if it's the adjustments that I made to the bike or her determination, but riding up the hill around the backstreets (slight incline, maybe 2.5-3.5 degrees over 1/4 mile) seems to be much easier for her.  Previously she made it about a .25 of the way up the hill and was huffin and puffin and searching for gears that would make it easier for her (or so I assume).  This last time she made it about 4/5's of the way up the hill before slowing down.  I try and encourage her when she's riding out in front of me... I dont know if she takes this as encouragement though as she usually yells at me.  The conversation goes like this:  me "You're doin' good honey, you gotta push it"... she responds " I AM  pushin' it!".  Afterwards Jodi was on a bit of an endorphin high.  Very agressive.  She went off on my over stupid stuff for the next 10 minutes or so... before she calmed down.  I get the same way after lifting weights, I feel really mean and pissed off for a while.  Is that normal?    Yesterday we went to Performance Bike and I bought a frame pump for my bike, and a cargo holder for Jodi's bike.  I already have a cargo holder on my bike.  To make a long story short, we get home and I immediately installed Jodi's cargo bag onto her bike... to which she responded with a greatful remark "Hmmmm, that looks WAY angled"... see the encouragement I get?  I buy it for her, I install it... do everything but ride it for her... anyway, I'm looking at my bike sizing up where I want to install this new  pump .  I take the pump out of its little point-of-sale box and start looking at the brackets that they have given me to install it on my frame.  After examining the bracket for about 5 minutes, I realize that it's broken.  How annoying!  So now it needs to be taken back and exchanged... makes me wonder if it's a defect in the manufacturing or if someone messed with it in the store.  I'm leaning towards the latter since the pumps all looked kind of picked over.  It's a really nice model with a brushed aluminum look.    I've noticed that after my workouts I can eat a horse.  The previous sentence pretty much sums up what I felt like in the evening yesterday.  Sooooo hungry.  Even after Jodi made dinner I was still hungry... even after drinking a half gallon of water from my P&ucirc;r filter I could still eat that horse.  I dont know how I'm going to deal with that... I'll have to read some training guides and see what they say about it.

      Okay... so it aint the  Lion the witch and the wardrobe ... but it's an interesting title none the less.   Yesterday I worked on Jodi's car some more... I drained out the crankcase oil and took a good look at it... I let it drain down a pan sideways so that any metal pieces/filings/shavings would stick to the edge of the pan.&nbsp; Nothing.&nbsp; The oil was certainly dirty... but definitely  not  filled with shavings.&nbsp; I then began removing the exhaust system since this runs under the oil pan and must be removed to access the crank area.&nbsp; After a while of trying to remove the exhaust flange from from the collector, I took a good look at the oil and decided that there wasnt enough in the pan... like it had been leaking from somewhere.&nbsp; But jodi's car has  NEVER  left an oil drip in my driveway... nor in her parking spot at her apartment.&nbsp; Regardless, I refilled the system with some oil I had on hand.&nbsp; I like to keep materials for two oil changes in my garage... which reminds me that it's time to buy some more.&nbsp; Anyway, so now Jodi's car is running on  high performance Mobil 1 Synthetic Oil .&nbsp; I disconnected the primary wire from the Cap so that the car wouldnt start no matter how long you turned it over.. and I turned the engine over with the starter a few times... to work the oil into all of the nooks and crannys at a relatively low speed... just an extra precaution so that the engine didnt sieze up on me or anything when I started it.&nbsp; After that, I reconnected the Cap/Coil and fired her up... she rattled for a second, just like always... but this time it was much quieter.&nbsp; Even more so than when I originally changed the oil.&nbsp; Anyway, oil pressure built up nicely and she's running fine.&nbsp; I suspect some bearing damage, that's what's causing the slapping sound at start up and hard acceleration... and I suspect that the rear main seal is leaking which is causing the rapid oil consumption/loss, so we're going to try a commercial oil sealant additive, that promises to make the seals swell and close the gap around the crank.&nbsp;  We'll see...    Today I came in and went directly to a conference call/meeting in the  Feather River Room .&nbsp; After sitting there for a few minutes on hold waiting for the "chairman" to start the conference... my manager walked in.&nbsp; I didnt notice anything when she walked in, but when she started to sit down next to me... her fly spread open WIDE... and I kinda you know...made my eyes all big and looked away.&nbsp; Apparently Tou saw it also and had the same reaction as&nbsp; I did... she read our faces really well because she kind of started laughing, looked down fixed it and said "I was really running late this morning...".&nbsp;&nbsp; So I said... "Yeah, we can see that".&nbsp; Anyway, we went about the rest of the day not saying anything until a few minutes ago.&nbsp; I said something to her and called her " the   Flash   "... she turned soooo red, it was hilarious!   Today I was thinking of going and getting some supplies to build a workbench.&nbsp; I lack a significant working area in the garage, other than the top of my tool chest project center, so I thought I might build a bench on the patio in the backyard to work at.&nbsp; First things first though, I have to lift weights when I get home since it's Wednesday.&nbsp; Then I need to go to  urlLink Performance Bike  and Lowes and possibly Costco.&nbsp; I just dont know what order to put it all in.&nbsp; None of it, save for the weight training is really important, it could all wait until later.&nbsp;&nbsp; I think I'll mow the lawn later too.   I feel like I've been pretty productive as of late.&nbsp; Every day I've been doing the dishes before work.&nbsp; I've been taking care of my ferrets and keeping them entertained (even though Jewel's new passed time is to scrape her nails across the plastic floor of their multi-level condo), I've been eating breakfast consistently (to which I add a fresh ground  urlLink Flax Seed  to), I've been eating a sensible lunch and a sensible dinner.&nbsp; Couple that with working out M-W-F and cycling on offdays... and working on Jodi's car on off days too... I feel pretty good about myself ;-)   I've noticed a definite increase in energy.&nbsp; In the passed, if I'm on the couch and thinking to myself "I should really get up and do something" the response my body has come up with was "snoooooore"... lately I've turned that around and as soon as I'm feeling like that, I flip it back and get up.&nbsp; I've organized my tools in the garage 3 times because of this ;-)&nbsp; Each time I work on Jodi's car... the tools get greasy and out of place somewhat.&nbsp; That and I get bored with their placement and try and think of new and intuitive ways to organize them... such as instead of Metric tools only... breaking them up by job type "tune up" drawer... "gear maintenance" drawer... stuff like that.&nbsp; I do know that I am fully out of space already and I still have a bunch of tools in my room.&nbsp; I must say that this tool chest is probably one of the best gifts I have received.&nbsp; It's cool because it's just a place that I can work at/on whenever I want.&nbsp; Anyway, I think I'm exceeding my max-daily-blog threshold so I'll have to sign off.&nbsp;    I hope you enjoyed reading about the Car, the Flash, and the Workbench.

      Well... after having an awesome weekend... Jodi's car gave out on us.&nbsp; It lost oil pressure... dropped down to about 20PSI.&nbsp; At first I thought it was the oil pump... but after researching and thinking about it more and more... I think it's one of the crank bearings... one or more.&nbsp; After finding all of this out yesterday, I was too defeated to work on the car.&nbsp; So I took Monday off from working on the car, and I suppose I'll be working on it tonight.&nbsp; I'm supposed to work on it with Jodi later.&nbsp; I'm hoping that the engineers who designed the crank were smart enough to use a soft metal bearing... one that wouldn't score/mar the surface of the crank too much.&nbsp; I hate that it's just a wait and see situation... but what can I do?&nbsp; I'm hoping that the main bearings are okay and that it's just the connecting rods.&nbsp; Judging from how everything else has gone with this car... it's going to be a worst-case scenario.&nbsp; I'm hoping to just get it back in running condition and then sell it off for a different car.&nbsp; It seems that whoever rebuilt this car last didn't pay enough attention to detail. &nbsp; Work has been pretty lame.&nbsp; I dont know if it's because of the heat... because I'm tired... because I'm worried about Jodi's car or what... but I just dont want to be here right now.&nbsp; And they switched my hours back so that I leave at 5:30 instead of 4:30... so I'm sure today will drag on like crazy... I've been here only an hour! &nbsp; I've started my second week of weight training.&nbsp; I drafted up a training log and printed it out.&nbsp; I have been filling it out and then transfering the data to my laptop.&nbsp; Of course, the data right now is kind of boring because I'm doing the "break-in" sets and weights... so the weights aren't very high and I'm keeping the reps at 10.&nbsp; I can already feel an increase in strength though.&nbsp; Not so much in my arms or anything, but in my quad's.&nbsp; I can already see a size increase and definition on my shoulders and biceps... not bad for only a week!&nbsp; I can't wait until I can stop this break-in period and start in with heavier weights!&nbsp;  &nbsp; Jodi and I rode our bikes around AR last week... that was fun.&nbsp; I'd like to get in some more bike riding... but haven't been able to find the time.&nbsp; I think Jodi still thinks of this as a "slow and go" thing... while I'm only doing it for the excercise value.&nbsp; I wonder how she's going to respond when I get my heart rate monitor and start working to keep my heart in its target zone.&nbsp; We'll see, I'm sure she'll rise to the occassion.&nbsp; I offered to buy her a heart rate monitor but she turned me down.&nbsp; It was a good one too, it had a chest strap that transmits your heart rate wirelessly to the accompanying watch.&nbsp; Oh well.&nbsp; I did remove the odometer/speedomer from my mountain bike and plan on installing it on Jodi's bike.&nbsp; There's just something cool about seeing how fast you're going. &nbsp; Salmon season opened!&nbsp; I dont think anyone is fishing yet... but Salmon season on the Sacramento River opened on the 16th.&nbsp; I got my gear out and started cleaning my spinners and making sure they run straight and true.&nbsp; Hopefully we can get Jodi a Salmon this year.&nbsp; Oh yeah, that reminds me... I'm bidding on a new Salmon Rod... something that's easier for Jodi to fish with.&nbsp; I better go check my bid...

      I took a stab at writing a tiny space-related article.  What'd yal thing?  I think I need to work on the flow of things but it wasn't too bad.  Space articles are more difficult to write because you have to blend facts in there and normally people aren't too keen on numbers and stuff.  Oh well, I tried.  Yesterday I went to sleep before 11PM... Now I feel bad after reading Jodi's website.  She says she was "lonely" last night.  Which is kinda crap because normally when she comes home like that, she talks to me for maybe 20 minutes... and then goes "Honey... I go nigh nigh... seepy..." and that's it.  I really shouldn't feel guilty over it.  Now that I'm weight Training, I need my sleep more than ever.  I've noticed that I have a lot more energy now that I'm lifting weights and riding my bike.  I get up in the morning and no longer feel sluggish.  I sit up quickly and am ready and rearing to go.  It's actually kinda neat.  Oh, and another thing... the heat doesn't bother me anymore!  I noticed that I can be out in the hot temperatures for a much longer time before even starting to break a sweat... very cool  since I've always been the first to break a sweat.  I upped the weights on all of my excercises and started to feel pain in my left forearm when doing bent over rows... so I dropped the weight back down on that excercise... no sense in hurting myself to lift another 15 Lbs.  Yesterday I practiced over and over again with my flight simulator.  I was practicing 180 degree turns.  I would take off from the runway... and make a banked 180 degree turn to the right, flying passed the runway, banking back 180 to the left passed the runway, 180 degree left again...followed by a final right 180 banking turn and landing the plane down on the runway.  By the end of my 1.5 Hour training session... I was doing it consistently!  I realized a few things while flying the plane that helped me out... that and I think developed some neuromuscular memory in my thumbs.  I realized that rather than distinct manuevers such as banking left and then correcting right... the manuevers should blend into each other... once I started doing this everything smoothed out and my flying improved.  I'm flying a simulated "trainer" plane, one that is more forgiving and fly's slower... but the controls and everything are the same as larger and faster planes.

       Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida    The  ME rcury  S urface,  S pace  EN vironment,  GE ochemistry, and  R anging mission ( MESSENGER ) is set for launch on August 2, 2004, 2:16:11AM EDT.  It's destination: Mercury, the first rock from the Sun.  The Messenger vessel will fly by Earth, Venus and Mercury several times to deplete its energy sufficiently before attempting orbital insertion on March 18th, 2011.  Mission Controllers are confident, but note that orbiting a celestial body is no easy task,  "Too slow and your probe will drop into the planet's atmosphere and burn up. Too fast and you'll fly off into space, stuck helpless in a solar orbit for billions of years."  remarked Matthew Cavagnaro of NASA's John F. Kennedy Space Center.

      Yesterday I lifted weights like I was supposed to... then I mowed the lawn and did the dishes.  Jodi and I went to the new Walmart over on Watt avenue... the place is pretty cool.  I dont think I've ever seen a store with wider aisles.  I mean, they are so big that it actually looks kinda weird.  I suppose they designed it like that so they can start their stupid pallet stacking that they always do.  I dont understand how they get away with that.  I would think Cal OSHA would have a problem with raw pallets being out by the people like that.  I guess not.  A friend of mine, Erin was crying this morning... apparently she's losing a lot of money in the stock market.  I think it's cool that she's playing the market like that.  It's a risk you take... but she actually bought some stock that I had contemplated at a time...and then ruled out because of it being too high a risk.  I'm talking about SIRIUS Radio.  I hope it does better for her.  Pleasant Hill loan center is closing soon... and they are switching their new file transactions over to our Rancho Cordova site this Monday.... so the office is a buzz with preparations.  I guess we're supposed to be doubling the amount of stuff we do now, something like that.  I need to find a woodworking project or something for me to do this weekend since I guess Jodi works both days.  I really wish she would change that, it would be too cool if we had both days off together every weekend.  I guess I can look at the bright side... I probably save money this way!

      I received my  Great Planes: Real Flight R/C Simulator  yesterday.  I tried it out a little...  AWESOME !  Basically, the software has a collection of real model planes you can buy... and the planes respond/act exactly like their real world counterparts.  Couple that with real world physics, and an actual r/c remote control unit... and you have a very realistic experience!  I have read a lot of independant testimonials from R/C Pilots online and lots of them say that they have learned to fly from this simulator, and are better pilots for it.  So... I was looking at R/C planes... the cheapest of which are R/C Gliders... but I thought "Where can I fly a glider around here?".  To make a long story short, I found a Sacramento Gliders Club that operates just passed west sacramento!  They welcome people to come and spectate, and once a month have a beginners training class.  Depending on how I do with this simulator, I might make a run at it!  I think Jodi would like it to... so I'm gonna drag her along if her schedule permits.  Today is an extremely slow day at work.  Rates are terrible... I'm glad Janice and Lawrence got in when they did.  Jodi must be really tired from helping them move... normally she calls me around 8:30AM.  It's about 11:20AM now and she still hasn't called.  I didn't even make her ride her bike yesterday...   Today is a workout day... I can't say that I'm looking forward to it and I can't say that I'm dreading it either.  It's just so hot outside that it's difficult to stay focused on proper form... try focusing on doing perfect form squats while a drop of sweat crests your eyelid and burns your eye...   I suppose I should get back to researching my glider... ooops... I mean... gotta get back to work!

      I'm so tired this morning that I can't even think straight.  I went to make a cup of coffee, tore open my Splenda packets, and ALMOST poured them into the garbage can... then I realized... WHAT AM I DOING!!!? LOL  I can't say that it was Jewel keeping me up last night... she's been nice and quiet as of late.  I found out that if I turn the light on in my room for like an hour before I go to sleep... she'll wake up and play in her cage... and then be tired and go to sleep when I go in there and turn it off.  It's a win win situation.    Last night I had some low-carb icecream... last night I paid for it and I continue to pay for it today... stupid stomach cramps.  Nothing like sitting here and feeling your stomach turn.  I dont think I'll ever eat that Neopolitan crap again.  Stupid icecream.  I bought myself a cyclometer last night... It's a really nice one from Cateye.  It will record my trip distance...speed...average speed... total bike distance (odometer), lap times, intervals, etc.  And it does all of this wirelessly!  No mess of wires hangin' down the bike!  So basically it has a bunch of crap that I dont know how to use yet or will ever use... I mean... who wants to ride laps on a bike?  Isn't part of the whole biking experience to be able to "be out there" and just "in it"... riding around lookin' around?  Anyway, I wonder when it will arrive... I can't wait to install it on my bike... going to look way cool.  I read some reviews from "cyclometer junkies" and they say that they become obsessed with "improving the numbers"... constantly looking to better the numbers.  We'll see how I react to it.  I just think it's very cool to know how fast you're going and how far you've been!  I also purchased a new Lamiglass hand crafted salmon rod.  It's an 8'6" blank with deep amber thread wraps, covered with a dark rootbeer sealant (you can only see the color if you look at it at a low angle in full sun).  To go with this beauty, I bought an Ambassadeur D series reel.  This reel is state-of-the-art when it comes to baitcasters.  I added it all up and the whole combo comes out to just a hair over a half pount total weight!  That should be a blast to cast all day... let alone catch a Salmon!  The rod has a nice smooth bend to it with a very sensitive tip... I purchased this one because I wanted to be able to feel the spinner blade revolving around the shaft as I brought it through the water... to make sure it's working.  Salmon season opened on July 16th... I can't wait until they start heading upstream!

      I did it.  I finished building the workbench that I've been blabbing about... did I say "blabbing"?  I meant "blogging".  Anyway, it was a pretty easy project... The only real difficult part was working in the 100+ degree weather we've been having.  By the time I was done, my shirt was soaked with sweat.  Oh well, small price to pay for the finished project.  My mom was "very impressed" with the outcome.  She said "Wow... it even has a shelf!".  Too funny.  Now I'm looking at wood projects that I can do on my workbench.  So far I'm interested in a Zen Garden (read: rock garden) that I can make and put on my desk.  I dont know, it requires a router and I dont have one of those... so we'll see.  Good excuse to buy another tool.  I think I want to stick with stuff that I already have tools for... so I'll have to keep looking.  This weekend was fun.  Jodi and I went to Denios on Saturday.  It was a very hot day but I had fun.  We don't ever really buy anything there... but it's good excercise and I like the interaction and stuff.  I met "Bill", a seller/dealer there that frequents Boston Market... He's a NASCAR fan... so we talked about NASCAR for a while.  I thought that was cool because Jodi is the only person I consistently talk about NASCAR with.  He called Jodi a "walking NASCAR encyclopedia", I thought that was a great compliment considering this is her second year of watching.  Jodi's really good with remembering names and things that happened for some reason.  She can't seem to remember anything else... but certain aspects she just latches onto and won't quit.  Kinda strange.  It's been a week with no car problems from Jodi so far... it's scary isn't it?!!  I wonder if she checked her oil this morning like she was supposed to?  I bet she didn't.  See what I mean...remembers everyones car number and what sponsor they have... but can't remember to check her oil.  I also bet that she forgot to see the office of her apartments.  That girl.  Anyway, works getting kinda busy lately... so I better get back to that.

       Ferret Amnesty Bill   Senate Bill 89 was just given a hearing date of August 11th, 2004.  It has been on the Appropriation Committee's suspense file back since June.  If you don't know how a Bill becomes law... I invite you to go to the site above and start back at the beginning when this bill was drafted.  You can see how it went to each committee and was voted on... and what the effect of that is.  The bill still has to clear this committee, before it goes to the Assembly floor to be voted on... if we get a enough 'Ayes' then it will go to the governor... where it can potentially be signed into law.    Quoted from another site:   I just heard that the Governor's office is asking the public's opinion on our ferret amnesty bill. I absolutely urge you all to call in your support for this bill as soon as possible. Follow the prompts and select the one that asks for you opionon on legislation. I just called but I want you all to listen carefully in case it changes. To respond to legislation, press #2, then listen for SB 89, press #3, then to support SB 89 press #1. Please have all of your friends and family call in. This is, I believe good news but we must answer this loud and clear!  The Governor's number is:   (916) 445-2841   Please call!  It's a totally automated system, and completely anonymous.  Have everyone in your family call...friends... whomever you can get to listen.  There's something wrong when Californian's are criminilized by owning something that is legal in ALL but one other state! (HI).  Thank you for your time and support.

      Wow... today has been   HECTIC   to say the least!  We haven't been this busy for about a year!  I hope it's a sign of things to come.  The other guys are already complaining that we need an additional person on our team... I say no... give me a raise and I'll keep quiet.    For whatever reason, they decided to make our rates  VERY  good today.  As in 1% better than yesterday almost!  That's a   CRAZY   swing... I've never seen it move that far.  We now have Pleasant Hill brokers calling us.  Pleasant Hill brokers arent as convinced that locking online is the way to go as our brokers are.  Meaning, where as 80% of our brokers lock online... 80%+ of their brokers lock by fax... so that means  LOTS  of quick typing and fast calculations.  I'm amazed how I used to dread doing math back in highschool... I didn't ever hate it like some people... but I just never completely grasped the full fledged concept of it all... ohhhh to do things again.  Anyway, now I do calculations on the fly... check and recheck my work just to make sure... and I'm correct almost all of the time.  I'm happy that I've arrived at a point where I can just eyeball a situation and give you a yes/no answer as to whether this is going to qualify or isn't... or what it would be at this rate as opposed to that... honing my skills if you will.  Alas the day is nearly over, twilight threatening the warm rush of lock requests that bathed us like liquid sunshine in a panicked brook.  It was good. And as I sit here blissfully slipping into tranquility, I can't help but wonder how many people will have a house now because of something I have done?  How much money will they save, how much money have they made, all because of something I did.  It's simple work, but meaningful none-the-less.  I'm very excited about this weekend.  Not because I'm going out of town or anything like that... but just for the sheer R&R... It has been a LONG week full of twists and turns...and changes up the yin-yang and hoo-haa... I'm glad it's over... I'm ready for my wight training tonight... ready for my weekend that begins in exactly 59 minutes.    I've been looking at Boxer puppies lately.  I want to move out and rent a home soon.  I'm ready to go.  The only thing I have a problem with is Jodi's schedule.  With her schedule as it is... I'll go to work when she's asleep... and I'll be asleep when she's coming home.  Kind of like the hands of a clock that come so close but never touch.  I suppose this will give me plenty of time to do the things that I want to do.  And that's what sucks... I'd rather do stuff with Jodi than by myself.  I suppose I'll get over that... maybe I'm too attached.  My hobby's and interests have taken me to a point where they can't be contained in my little room on Privet Drive...My weight training stuff is slightly hampered by the shape of the yard and things on the patio... my telescope is WAY too big... my desk is WAY too big... bikes... computers... aquarium...drafting table...ferret cage... where does it end!  Anyway... I'm just looking to pay off the 1 G on my credit card... go to Chicago... and get ready to move out... I'm thinking October.  We'll see how it goes.

       urlLink Reuters | Latest Financial News / Full News Coverage   If you havent read the above article, please take a moment to read it.  It seriously irritated me.  Done reading?  Good, what did you get from this?  Basically that we are unique and that all of our study's so far show that even though we have identified 120 other systems of planets orbiting around stars, that none of them have earth-like (read: terrestrial) planets around them.  Right?  Good. That's fine.  What the article   FAILS   to disclose however, is that current technology  LACKS THE ABILITY  to see objects that "small".  You have to remember that these gas giants that they speak of, are almost incomprehensibly huge.  We're talking about 30+ the size of earth!  That would be like flying over a city... and saying "Oh... there arent any people in this city, all we can see are sky scrapers".  If they had binoculars (ie, better technology), they would be able to 'zoom in' and see the people.  So this story is ridiculous, all they can see are the sky scrapers.  But fear not my friends... new technology is on the way!  With the invention and perfection of Adaptive Optics... we should be able to see planets MUCH smaller than we can now.  If we were to view our Solar System from a couple million light-years away... all you would see is a star (our sun, sol) and Jupiter... you might be able to detect Saturn... but you would think "oh, no earth like planets here.".  When Adaptive Optics step in...that picture changes.  You see, when you look up at a star from a ground based telescope... you magnify things.  You magnify what you are trying to see... known as the "Target"... but you also magnify anything in between you and said Target.  But wait, what's in between me and the Target?  AIR!  Not only that, but pollution... water vapor... heat waves!  Tons of stuff.  So what happens is that you magnify all of the bad stuff along with the good.  Adaptive Optics is a sytem where a computer senses these distortions... and converts them into mirror and lense movement.  For instance, you're looking through a telescope at a bird 100 yards away... heat waves are rising off of the field and you can still see the bird... but the waves make it blurry...then clear...blurry.... then clear.  The adaptive optics computer will sense these and phsically BEND the mirror... to cancel out these effects!  How amazing is that!  The mirrors are flexed to cancel out a large amount of the distortions, rendering a perfect or at least much more acceptable image.  Hubble produces such beautiful pictures and it doesnt have Adaptive Optics, why should we bother?  Can you figure it out on your own?  Hubble sits delicately in space in a geosyncronous orbit.  Come again?  It's LOCKED in possition, RELATIVE to the earth in SPACE.  There isn't any AIR too distort it's images... there isn't any Pollution to mess things  up... No "Heat Waves" to distort.    Anyway... works over... I gotta go home now... it's 5:30

      Here I am again... I dont know why I keep coming back to this place... LOL.  PAYCHECK!  Anyway, I was kind of annoyed this morning when I got onto the freeway.  You see, I pass over the bridge on Bradshaw and catch 50 East every morning... when I'm at the apex of the bridge, I always look over my shoulder at the oncoming traffic, and judge their speed... and try and project who if anyone, I will have to pass/coordinate with to get onto the freeway.  Today there was a blue van... with speckles.  Speckles means that the car was driven frequently in the bay area and so the paint is fading/sanded off on any area that the salt hit or that the salty air flows over while driving... i.e. the leading edge of the fenders... leading edge of the hood etc.  Anyway, so I go to get on the freeway, I used to just turn the wheel hard with my hands locked in possition... nowadays I turn onto the onramp and re-place my hands at the top of the wheel.  Reason being that one time my truck almost did a 360 when I got onto the freeway and it was no easy task getting it back online (I still did it though)...anyway... I timed it so I would pop out in front of him.  For whatever reason... he decided to speed up... and get all up on my ass... that just pissed me off... it's the slowlane a$$hole!  Anyway... so I kept him going slow... just to piss him off... I drove up to a Semi that was in front of me... switched lanes... then backed off the gas so that I pinned him in his lane...behind the semi... unable to switch lanes... I know... I know... simple pleasures really ARE the best.  Today is my second hard workout day.  I'm looking forward to it.  My first hard workout day (Monday) I went too easy on several excercises.  My target max rep is 7 or 8... I was reping a consistent 12 on most excercises... go figure.  I think I'm going to try and bench press 110Lbs today... Considering I used to be able to bench 300Lbs in highschool... and I can only bench 110Lbs now... I suck.  But I'm much more dedicated to my workouts now than I was in highschool... so I'm sure I'll surpass what I used to do eventually.  According to the stuff I'm reading... these next 7 weeks should show a tremendous increase in STRENGTH... maybe not muscle mass... but in sheer strength.  We'll see.  I told myself at the start of this thing... I'll do the 10 week beginners training program and see where I'm at and if it's worth it.  Time will tell.  I want a dog.  Not right now, but in the future.  I love my ferrets... but lets face it, unless they pass that stupid bill (SB89) into law, it's going to be incognito for my ferrets for a LONG time.  Which is really annoying.  But anyway, ferrets get along great with other pets... cats and dogs... so that should be fine.  I have always wanted an American Boxer.  Jodi was unsure of this breed... but I showed her some pictures and stuff and she quickly changed their minds.  I think I'll read up on them somemore.  It'll be a while before I have a place for my own dog, but I believe in planning and getting things right from the start.  I want an extremely high quality dog.  Have to check pedigree's and the such.  Probably get on a waiting list.  I don't think I would want to breed though... so much work.  But the rewards are definitely there.  My parents breed high quality pugs and pomeranians and have made a pretty chunk of change.  But when you think about all the hours they put into care and into feeding/showing the pups... I'd say they just barely broke even.  We'll see.  I'm not to fond of the "operation"... even though both of my ferrets are fixed.  I'd want to take the dog to classes and stuff of course, I've always wanted a dog that was well behaved.  Anyway, there really isnt much to talk about today.  I'm going to work out tonight and then go out with Jodi. I need to do some shopping and stuff.  I'm running out of shampoo... hmmm, come to think of it... once you buy it... aren't you always running out of shampoo?  Not like it's in the bottle pro-creatin'.  Anyway, just some stuff I need to pick up... I can't wait to get out of here.  Jeff made some mention of starbucks and got me all riled up.  But so far he hasn't gone... and I know I'm not going.  Back to work...

      Well... yesterday (or today, depending on which coast you reside on) the Messenger Probe was sent up into space!  It was delayed a bit due to "lightening storm potential"... apparently the Cape has some muggy weather... Glad to be in sacramento!  I must say the weather has been great the last couple of days!  Yesterday I lifted weights like I said I was going to... I switched over to the heavy weight sets... Weird, even though I'm lifting more weight... I feel like I'm doing LESS work.  What I mean is that before I was lifting say, 30 Lbs 10 times... now I'm lifting 50 Lbs 8 times.  I mean, the contraction feels stronger in my muscles (translate: muscle burn, feels like it's going to explode or tear).  I must say that I am slightly disappointed about it though.  Here I am the next day, and so far I feel ZERO soreness.  I also noticed that durring a couple excercises my lower back got extremely tight.  This bothers me a LOT because it makes me worry that I might do some damage or something... I'll be lowering the working weight set on those excercises... no sense in pushing it too hard and injuring myself.  I am quite happy with my bench press though.  My target bench press was to be 100 Lbs, for 8 reps.  I was able to lift it 12 times before muscle fatigue.  I would do more reps, but I am kind of scared to since I don't have a spotter.  There are a few excercises like that.  I was also proud of the fact that most excercises... I did 2 second counts, 2 seconds to lift, 2 seconds to put it down.  So... all in all, that went well.  I need to sit down and re-evaluate the amount of weight that I'm going to target however.  My target heavy-work-set is fatigue at 7 or 8 reps.  Most of my excercises I was able to get 10-12 reps, which suggests that I need a heavier weight.  We'll see how it goes tomorrow.  On another note, I realize that I need more sleep.  I've been getting the same amount of sleep that I've gotten for years 6-7 hours, but feel much more tired durring the day.  I think I'm taxing my system too much.  I also need to get out on my bike and ride.  It's pissing me off that I have the debt in my account but very little mileage on my bike to show for it.  So... anyway.  Today isn't too bad so far.  I do feel extremely tired and for once I used the snooze button on my alarm.  I went back and laid down like I was going to go to sleep... but after laying down I felt guilty and got back up... tired.  My shower felt really really good.  The hot water relaxes my muscles a lot... guess that's why people like hot tubs ;-)  So the bad part about that, is that it makes me sleepy ;-)  Oh well... I still dragged myself in here.    I purchased some lense cleaners for my sunglasses yesterday.  I cleaned the lenses off last night with it and shined them up with this MicroFibre shame lookin thing.  They came out so clear that it was almost scary.  I must say that the quality of Rayban lenses is very good from what I can tell.  When wearing them... if it wasn't for the edge/peripheral vision of the frame, then I couldn't tell that I was looing through a lense at all (disregarding the color change of course)... the images are so clear and no distortions at all.  I am very satisfied with that purchase... which is saying a lot since I am not a sunglasses advocate.  I've actually considered buying a second pair... love 'em.  I suppose I should get back to work... not a whole lot going on... I've been taking calls and stuff in-between writing.  I brought myself cubed steak and eggs for lunch.  I really wanted a vegetable or something, but we didnt have any at home.  Just some tomato's and zuchini's... I suppose I could have brought the zuchini in here... I dont like to eat tomato's by themselves like that.  I left a bunch of broccoli in Jodi's refrigerator yesterday... I think we'll be eating it tomorrow since she gets off at 8 I believe.  I need to get a full schedule from here as I need to take my truck in because it was recalled (stupid windshield wiper motor needs to be better sealed against the elements).  Back to the pit...

      This weekend was lame.  Jodi worked both days, so that pretty much blows anything that I want to do out of the water since she works shifts that occupy all of the daylight hours.  Other than that, I cut the tip of my thumb off.  Total rookie moove too.  I was chopping some onions, while trying to melt some butter and I needed to work on the dish washer (the latch mechanism wasn't functioning properly).  So while I'm thinking about that... my stupid self goes and nips the tip of my thumb... bleeding ensues... Jodi watches.  I had to have her finish cutting the onion... but was kind of annoyed that I actually had to ask her.  Here I am will blood starting to run down my hand... oh well, after that she took care of me.  She put a special "finger cuff" style bandaid on it.  I like 'em, they make my finger look kind of like a little nun (it stays open on one side, so the bandaid looks like a head cover).  Anyway, I started reading Harry Potter: The Goblet of Fire.  I'm about half way through this book and I'm pretty happy with it so far.  It seems to be a more 'adult' story, compared to the previous books, and it seems to have a decent pace to it so far.  I watched ShipShape Boating on Sunday.  I know what you're thinking, "Why are you bothering with watching a boating show?  You don't own a boat, Rudy."  The answer?  I will own a boat!  So far I've learned how to install a VHF radio, how to repair damaged hulls, which anchor type to use and how to rig it, and yesterday I learned how to repair and maintain a boat trailer.  The show also covered how much "tongue" weight your vehicle should have with relation to boat and trailer, which incidentally is 8%.  They said you should take your boat/trailer to a DOT (department of transportation) office that is equipped with a scale and weigh the whole craft/trailer... then roll it back and weigh just the tongue weight (lower the hitch wheel jack and leave that on the scale).  He showed how to adjust the trailer for proper weight placement... most of it was just a matter of removing some bolts and shifting the unit.  All in all it looked pretty easy, he even covered bearing replacement and grease packing... what a messy job.  For reasons unknown, the counter on my sidebar has disappeared.  The only thing I can figure is that their website is down right now... but since it's still down this morning... that means that it's been down for about 12 hours that I know of... kind of a long time for a domain to be down without anyone noticing...   Today starts the Pleasant Hill loan center transfer.  It also marks the beginning of my "Heavy Training" worksets.  Pleasant Hill was closed, and all of their business is coming here.  I expect today to be relatively crappy because of this... just meeting new people and learning their little quirks and stuff.  I start lifting to fatigue today.  I'm kind of nervous about lifting to fatigue because I don't have a spotter.  I figure I'll only work to fatigue on excercises that won't kill me if I drop the weight or the bar or whatever.  According to the Ironman program that I'm following, I'm supposed to do one warm up set with 50%-70% of what my "heavy work set" is going to be... then go all out with the heavy set.  If I can lift the weight more than 8 times... it's not enough weight and I am to increase it the next workout.  According to them, I should be able to lift the weight 7 or 8 times max.  We'll have to see how this goes.  It's still a relatively simple workout... actually, it's kind of easier than what I was doing before if you look at it from a rep standpoint...  I'll be doing less reps.  Anyway... I suppose I should at least open up my LPS interface program so that it looks like I'm working and not writing a book.  Later

      Well... here we are... It's Finally Friday!  Last night I went to sleep almost as soon as I got home from work... I barely remember Jodi calling and waking me up a time or two... I woke up this morning bright eyed and bushy tailed!  Feels good!  Did the dishes, made lunch, breakfast... and out the door I went.  On the way to work some moron lost control of his car about 100 yards up and scraped the side of it against the middle barrier on the freeway, NASCAR style... So of course in my mind, I picture the car potentially skating across the lanes perpendicular just like in a NASCAR crash...so I change lanes as far away as possible...he fishtails some...throwing dirt and debris all over the place...and then manages to gain control... His car now has a Darlington Stripe!  No problems with my truck though...  So here we are... playing "office bingo" today... I guess it's supposed to build 'spirit'... can't you tell?  Big news! The ferret bill was passed from the Committee on Appropriations!  This means it has passed two com.'s in the senate...and will now be forwarded to the senate floor!  If it's passed by the Senate, it will then go to Arnie for his signature and I can take my ferrets to Petsmart with me!  We'll have to wait and see...  Anyway, I'll have to be getting back to work...err... bingo...

      Last nights meteor shower was great!  We saw lots of shooting stars and I tried my hand at some astrophotography... I won't know how the latter went until later today as Jodi volunteered to take my film to the developer.  I was using Kodachrome Professional Slide Film 200 ISO.  I mainly shot images of Casseopia, Perseus, the Summer Cross, and then some images of nothing in particular...just hoping to capture a meteor streaking across the image.  I also did a 5 minute "star trail" exposure centered on the North Star, Polaris.  I would love to get into Astrophotography as I've seen some really amazing photo's done by amateurs online.  The prohibiting factor there is cost.  First of all, a telescope worthy of imaging (must have superior optics and solid/stable mount) is VERY expensive... but since I won the buzz aldrin scope from Meade... I'm good there!  The next step would logically be a CCD camera... these are coming down in price but are still up in the $2k+ range for a decent one.  I suppose I'll just keep working on my 'film' technique since that is cheaper and allows more room for error.  I'd love to be able to do long exposure photography, over 40 seconds... but that requires a precisely driven telescope.  It'll take time before I can do that.  Most of the people online doing Astrophotography live in  dark-sky  area's, so they set up their telescope and camera equipment while it is still daylight outside... and can then image the sky from the comfort of their home.  I know a couple guys that actually sit inside their house... and operate their scope from a computer.  Lucky.  There is definitely a down side to the shower last night... I am   dead tired!   I haven't felt this tired/sleepy in a long time.  I tried to counteract it by drinking a bit more coffee this morning... the only thing I succeeded at was upseting my stomache with it.  Oh, and get this... we helped out registration yesterday because they were getting buried in work... too many files coming in now... and guess who calls in sick today?  Todd.  Todd is in registration... so that means that they have too much work and are one man down.  More work for us today I guess, stupid "load leveling".  He better have a good reason to not be here today... because I feel like crap but I'm still here working away... okay okay... so I'm not working this very minute but I will be in a second or two.  If any of the prints come out decent... I'll be posting links here for all to view.  I'm hoping to be able to identify a few nebulae and star clusters in my images, if there are any... I'll post two versions, one unedited and the other with a wire frame overlay and text explaining what you're looking at.  We'll see.   Feeling so tired that I feel sick...

      Last night I went to bed extremely early.  I woke up around midnight and went outside... looked up at Perseus... and watched as two meteors streaked across the sky.  And that's just from my backyard!  I went out there later, and saw another one... all three of them were HUGE displays of white light.  I'd say somewhere around magnitude -1 or so... one of them looked just like a firework one would see durring the fourth of July.  Tonight should be good...  Mom went to Jackson last night... as of this morning she still wasn't home.  It would be nice if she hit some huge jackpot... but I have a feeling that my grandmother just didn't want to go home.  She has a problem with knowing when to stop.  I really wish my mom didn't do this kind of thing.  I'm pretty sure that she's going to be all messed up for the next couple of days... sleepy... and generally just in a bad mood.  We'll see.  Hopefully she'll catch up on her sleep quickly.  Today is Wednesday already!  This week seems to be going by pretty quickly!  I work out today and I can't wait!  I think it's very interesting to see my strength levels increasing... slow and steady.  Oh, and my vacation is just around the corner!  I don't know if I said it here before... but I timed the startup of my workout routine so that the mandatory "week off" falls on my vacation ;-)  So I don't have to worry about working out or anything while I'm over there... guilt free ;-)  I think I might go for a jog or something like that... we'll see.  So far today has been alright... I'm not sleepy or anything like that so that's always a plus.  The phones have been kind of busy this morning but not half bad.  Apparently there is an 800 line problem somewhere at MCI...and it's causing a few of our calls to be dropped... I think it's kind of funny... not good for business, but funny nonetheless.  DVD X-Copy is now out of business... the MPAA sued them and they just gave up and paid the fine... I suppose I'll have to ask someone for a copy as I don't have it.  I'm sure it'll be available online through peer-2-peer networks for some time.  Hmmmm... maybe I should buy a dvd burner for my laptop!  I was looking at the emerging technologies for computers and can't wait!  I want to build a home-theatre-pc... basically a TiVo that can do a LOT more ;-) Either that or just the end all computer that will last me at least 4 years... so basically something 3Ghz+ with a boat load of DDR and for sure PCIe... incidentally, I had started pricing things out before to build a new PC but stopped short because of the new techology's that are coming out... SATA and PCIe being the main factors.  But anyway...  I hope some of you take a moment to go outside tonight and see the meteor shower.  It amazes me how many people have no concept of the heavens that surround them or their place in this galaxy...and this universe.  I'm not telling you to get all crazy and read every astronomy book you can get your hands on (although that's pretty much what I did)... but I find it to be a worthy and rewarding persuit.  I am somewhat bummed by our city's light pollution... and would jump at a chance to live out in the country... but I still try.    Back to the pit...

       Astronomy - Astronomy Day - Nationwide collaboration a resounding success! - Matt Quandt (06/17/2004)   Just in case that article becomes a broken link... heres the part that pertains to me:  "We are excited to announce Lisa Franco of Sacramento, California, is the winner of the LX200GPS telescope. Beating all the odds, Ms. Franco also was the winner of the ETX-90 at the Chabot Space and Science Center in Oakland! Lightning, indeed, can strike twice. In an impressively generous gesture, she is giving both scopes to her brother, Rudy — an avid amateur astronomer. "If he hadn't brought me to Chabot, I wouldn't have even entered the drawing," Lisa said. "I told Rudy that if I won, I'd give him the telescope. I just never thought we'd win both!"  Astronomy day was a lot of fun... I had a great time in and of itself...and will be sure to go back next year.  I never dreamed I would win both scopes!  Very cool.  I must say that I was most impressed with the solar telescopes... I have spent countless evening looking up at the stars at faint faint objects... trying to see how faint of stars I can see with the naked eye and the such... so to look at something through a telescope that is big and bold, like the sun!  That was awesome!  They had the Coronado PST solar scope there... I want one of those really bad...  it shows the sun through a hydrogen-alpha filter... so you can see the solar prominences and the such.  I would really like to have one of their other scopes ( Coronado makes solar scopes exclusively , of which the PST is the 'economy' model).  We'll just have to wait and see.  Jodi and I will be going out around midnight on Wednesday to observe the annual  Perseid showers ... I've taken her out a few times to view  meteor  showers and they have all been slightly...how do I put it without demeaning the times we spent together... the showers were very inactive.  This year is supposed to be a very good time to observe, as it will be around the New Moon phase which will allow us to see even the faint meteors!  I would encourage my readers to take a minute to read " Basics of Meteor Observing " for hints on what to do and what to look for, then if you're up for it and want to delve deeper, you should cruise on over to " Advanced Meteor Observing ".  I plan on doing basic observations... I think it takes some of the "magic" away if you're sitting there jotting down magnitudes and frequencys and duration... Not only that, but you only have like a day or so to learn the Stellar Magnitude System...   Don't forget...any time this week is a good time to look for shooting stars... Main activity should be wednesday and thursday night... late late night/early early morning times.    Enjoy!

      I'm leaving work at 12:30 today.  I took the truck in this morning with Jodi's assistance.  I really appreciate that.  Simple job, stupid windshield wiper motor recall.  What is it about getting off early that makes the day seem to take FOREVER.  Only an hour and a half left and I'm off... seems like an eternity.  My mind isn't really into this blog right now...  Why don't I receive comments on my articles anymore?  I'm getting frustrated... I got excited because I had a comment below, and then I checked it and it was from me!  What a let down.  Anyway... I have a slight headache and work to do... both are keeping me from giving this blog the attention and thought that it deserves.  I shall try again later.

      So... yesterday Jeff felt insulted by one of the upper level managers.  They asked him a question to which he responded nonchalantly "I don't know...".  This manager then said "That's the problem Jeff, you just don't care."  Now Jeff is pretty pissed, he started looking for a job about 10 minutes after it happened... I told him he was blowing it out of proportion, but figured in my head that he would calm down by today.  He hasn't.  His job search seems to be more furious this morning... he's actually sending out resume's from his desk.  Maybe it is time to move on.  I don't know... I kind of have other plans in mind though... have to wait and see how things pan out.  One step at a time.  Today my cyclometer should arrive!  I'm kind of excited about it.  I mean, it's one thing to just ride your bike and that's it... I like to have definite information.  Like weight training for example... I like to look at the exact weight I did the day before... and compare it with what I do today or how it felt today with how it felt the day before.  I suppose I should say "workout before" because I do not work out every day.  Anyway, the "feeling" part of it is a little harder to compare since it's not a tangible item... but none-the-less... I like to have a numeric measurement of what's going on, and this cyclometer should do that for me.  Next step is to buy myself a heart monitor so I can be sure I'm working in my target heart range.    Jodi and I went to the book store the other night.  I'm looking for a nutrition handbook... not like, what to eat specifically... but general healthy eating guidelines.  So far I haven't found any books that jump out at me.  The best one for what I want so far has been Nutrition for Dummies... I suppose I'll have to read amazon reviews to see what the good one's are...   I need to build a squat rack for my excercise routines.  Why?  Because I'm too cheap to buy one of course!  No, seriously... It shouldn't be all that hard to construct one from 2 X 4's and I'm starting to really nead it.  Now that I'm squatting a lot more weight, I worry about dropping the bar and stuff.  I wish I had a spotter sometimes... but I like the focus I develop when I'm working out on my own.  I'm starting to wonder if I should or should not buy any more plates.  I purchased two 25 Lb. standard iron plates (by Macy)... I would eventually like to have an olympic bar.  It just makes more sense to me!  I hate having to balance the weights on one side while I take the weights off the other... with an olympic bench/bar... the supports are mounted wider... and the bar weighs more... so I dont have to worry about balancing it or it falling.  It takes an aweful lot of weight to make it fall.  Anyway... I suppose I should get back to watching Jeff search for a Job.

      Yesterday we were load leveling with the registration department... which is managements fancy term for "covering registrations asses"... you see, they are falling behind quickly.  We were doing some simple file stacking.  I really don't mind this as it goes by quickly, as long as it doesn't take away from my job or hinder what I normally do in any way... and it helps them out a lot.  What pissed me off yesterday... all of us, really... who were helping out... was that while we were working hard to help them... they were walking around chit chatting...surfing the web... talking on the phone... whatever...how annoying is that!?  Here we are busting our ass to do our own jobs... and a portion of theirs... and they repay us by doing less!  So we stopped helping... and today, Tracy (my manager) comes in... and she's pissed at us... because we didn't do everything.  I'm sorry... but I don't like being used.  On another note... I went and purchased Jodi a cell phone last night.  I really don't know why I do that.  Not like I budgeted for it or anything... oh, and I thought it was a lot less than it really was!  The price quoted on the display was for a 2 year committment... oh well... It's a very cool looking phone.  Not too big... but not so small that I worry about her losing it.  I do worry about her dropping it... as she's VERY prone to dropping and breaking things... but, there really isn't much I can do.  I hope she realizes that I did   NOT   take out insurance on that  phone ... so she'll have to be careful. It's a really nice phone... I wouldn't mind it... It's a GSM phone so it's future compliant... should last a while.  So Jodi goes and asks me this morning if I wanted to go out later today...she gets off at 8pm... I say yeah... and that I'll see her later... an hour later she calls to tell me she's decided to do laundry at her sisters house... hmmmm... sounds peculiar to me.  Oh well, I suppose I can find something to do... I need to mow the lawn in the back yard... and I also was thinking of riding my mountain bike a bit... I wonder if my brothers bike is good to go... maybe he'll want to ride with me.  We'll see.  I'm looking forward to the fair on Sunday... Jodi and I have plans to go.  I'm thinking of riding my bike there... as they have free bicycle parking... in a patrolled area... it's not that I'm too cheap to spend 7 bucks... it's just that I like riding my bike ;-)  Jeff is working on getting me some tickets to go to the fair... but he usually doesnt come through on that stuff so I'm not holding my breath or anything.    I also went to Big 5 and bought two more 25 Lbs. plates.  I guess that shows that I'm improving in my weight training.  Yesterday I decided just to focus on absolutely perfect form.  I was very happy with the fact that I worked out yesterday, even though I wasn't feeling too hot.  I guess I was proud of myself... because I VERY EASILY could have just said forget it... and not worked out at all.  Anyway... I gotta pee... ttyl ;-)

      This weekend went by way too fast.  I feel like I was at work just yesterday.  Jodi and I went bike riding on Sunday... Jodi did great!  We went about 20 miles total.  She complains a lot of her legs burning... and she finally divulged what the problem is... She's not using her gears.  She says that if she "doesn't feel it in   legs" that she doesn't feel like she's riding correctly.  I can understand this, but I don't really understand why you wouldn't change gears to a more comfortable exertion level... one that you can hold for a longer period of time over a greater distance.  She said she started using it towards the end of the day... but I think she was pretty much done by that time anyway.  I wonder if she has any soreness today?  I know I don't.  I had a good time riding.  I can't wait until my new Cyclometer gets here (it's scheduled to arrive on Wednesday)... I get to actually monitor my speeds and distances and everything ;-)    I need to read my bicycle maintenance guide.  Buy some maintenance stuff for the bikes... like chain cleaner/wax mainly.  I think I want to make some adjustments to my bike already... the angle of the handle bars... the angle of the shifters... oh, and I'm not too happy about my stupid frame pump... I think I might sell it and get a different one.  It squeaks and the strappy fastener thing scrapes my leg all the time... annoying.  I fell asleep at Jodi's Sunday night... ended up going home at a little after 5AM... slept for an hour and here I am.  I'm so dreadfully tired.  You know that tired feeling... like you feel sick almost because you're so tired?  I feel like that right now.  Like I'm in a mental fog.  Not good with the job I have.  I'm hoping it'll go away within an hour or so.  We'll see.  SO far it's been pretty busy in here... lots of phone calls interfering with my blog.  I better feel better by the end of the day... I have weight training tonight.  I HAVE TO train... I don't want to think what would happen if I stopped... it's always harder to start again once you've stopped.  Maybe I'll go home and go to sleep... then wake up later and work out?  I suppose that would work... well, here's hoping that I feel better soon...  Later
