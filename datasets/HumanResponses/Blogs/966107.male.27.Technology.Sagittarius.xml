       Abortion and Child Bearing in Welfare.      A very heated discussion is going on in recently in the USA regarding abortion rights and the increased payment to families on welfare on childbirth. What I mean to say here is the decision by the government to deny welfare payments to families who decide to have children when on Welfare.     There are two facets to this discussion:  1. The basic right of people to bear children, have and expand family.  2. The ability of the people to support the children they give birth to on their own.    My honest opinion goes with the state that it is not appropriate to expand your family if it is not possible to support the family on your own without assistance. This may lead to chlid abuse, lack of proper upbringing for the children, denial of the basic nutrition, facilities. Children from such families may grow up into disgruntled individuals and may pose a threat to society.    Once a family is able to support itself without the welfare aid, then the decision to have children or not to have children is entirely their own. Also second important point to be noted here is the Welfare money comes out of the taxes collected from the ordinary citizens (like you and me) and the more people are given the aid the more tax will have to be paid. It does not mean that the welfare aid should be stopped, but what I mean to say is that the aid should be given to properly to satisfy basic needs for existance.    Having children when one cannot afford does not represent a basic need for existance. Of course having children is a nice feeling. But again it is a case of must have and nice to have. We need to differentiate between these two things.    Again as noted in the discussion by distinguished people that the additional welfare money for the third child when a woman already has two children is mere $64, which is not even sufficient to pay for the months supply of diapers. But keeping in mind the bigger picture, is this amount is paid to say even 10000 families who decide to have a third child while on welfare, the total would go to  $64000  per month and  $768000  per year. This is a huge amount of money which can be utilised for some other purposes to improve the society.    The discussion is not against welfare payments to families who already have children, but it appeals the families to reconsider their discussion to have children when on welfare. A social awareness campaign should be organised instead to discussing it endlessly on the media.    The next issue of the woman's right to have a abortion should not be removed. There may be incidences that the conception may have happened when it was not desired. In cases of rape, adolescent sex etc. Even in married couples, people may chose not to have children at a given time for a variety of reasons. Abortion may give them a way to avoid having unwanted children. Everyone (almost) loves children, but social,economic situations may make it unviable for couples to have children. Making abortion illegal may create a lot more problems than the critiques hope to solve. As always there is darker side for everything. However, the benefits and needs of a greater populace should be kept in mind when taking any decision.    Religion does not tell you to have unwanted children and then desert them and / or abuse them.         Mukul Dharwadkar

         THE GOLDEN RATIO        THE GOLDEN RATIO   Along with the number PI (value 3.14) scientists and mathematicians have been fascinated by another number PHI (Value 1.618). So much so that it is called as the golden ratio. It has been said that almost all the things in the universe and the world are governed by the golden ratio or the golder proportion.  A classic example that mathematicians quote is of the rose petals. It is said that the angle between the rose petals and the bud of the flower is very close to the golden ratio. Some examples of the movements of the universe and galaxies are also widely discussed.  Contrary to popular belief, that mathametics and science are for people with very little or no sense of art, scientists and mathematicians have shown great applications or the ratio in art and ergonomics. Mathematically, a line if divided in two parts, with the ratio between the parts of the line equal to the golden ratio, then the ratio between the whole line and the larger part is also equal to the golden ratio.    GOLDEN RECTANGLE   A rectangle for which the ratio of the larger side (length) to the smaller side (breadth) is equal to the golden ratio, is very pleasing for the eye. The rectangle is called as  Golden rectangle . It is very well known that Leonardo da Vinci was a scientist, mathematician, as well as artist. His best know works,  Monalisa , and  The Last Supper  have got instances of the golden rectangles. It is said the the face of the Monalisa fits exactly in a golden rectangle. However, there are doubts and multiple opinions about the placement and the orientation of the rectangle over the face.  Many more examples can be quoted for the golden ratio. Examples of a golden triangle are also very widely discussed.    VAST SUBJECT   Mathematicians have written lots of books on this subject of the golden ratio. It would be very brave and foolish to claim that this article covers all the aspects of the Golden Ratio. My intent on writing this piece was to just serve as a primer and stir interest in the readers for this subject.  If anyone has more information or contrary to what I have mentioned, please let me know. Also if anyone has got more information and references to this, please feel free to contact me. This by no means is the end of the article. I intend to reasearch further and throw more light on this in my future postings.  You can mail me at  mukul_d@india.com

         War on Terrorism      After 9/11 America has declared a global war on terrorism. As a part of the war on terrorism, and as an effort to bring peace to the world, the USA wanted to disarm Saddam Hussien of the weapons of mass destruction (WMD).  Given the aggression shown by Saddam Hussien in 1991 by invading Kuwait, and the resolution 687 passed in the UN, and the defiance of Saddam in refusing to comply with the UN weapons inspectors, it seemed the logical thing to do.  However, after President Bush identified Iraq as a threat to american security in the axis of evil in his state of the union address in 2002, efforts had gained a momenutm to disarm Saddam or face serious consequences. Consequently a new resolution 1441 was passed by UN security council giving Saddam a last chance to comply.  Hans Blix and Mohammad elBaradei were the chief UN weapons inspectors and their efforts were bearing fruits. Disarming is a not an overnight process. It takes time. Even the nuclear disarmament agreement between USA and the then USSR was slated to take 10 years.  Granted that Saddam Hussien was given enough time to disarm since 1991, then why were the inspections stopped in 1998? Was he not a threat then? Or did America felt secure then?  What America wants to do may be correct, but the way they are carrying it out is certainly not correct. Also it raises questions about the genuineness of American concern over Iraq's alleged WMD. We all know all this is about controlling Iraqi oil, which has huge oil reserves. But according to me, it goes beyond Iraqi oil. America wants world domination, and wants to be the supreme leader of the world.  It tried to do that economically. But it found that its economy very fragile and finicky. Also the emerging economies in Asia like India and China are much more stronger and cheaper. The labour is much more cheaper with better quality. So that attempt was unsuccessful. Now US is trying to gain world domination by force. US' military might is undenialy the strongest in the world. But does that give US the right to bully its ways down opponents throat? What better is US then, than the back alley bully?  Bush has openly stated that he wants to restructure the middle east. Who has given US or more specifically, Bush the authority to do so? And for what? To serve American interests better? Not surprisingly the arab leaders are angry and afraid at the same time at the american intentions.  The war against Iraq was totally unnecessary. America wanted bin Laden. It was not able to find him out. It was a failure of the celebrated American intelligence agencies. So now they want to cover up their failures by diverting the attention to Iraq.  If Iraq has WMD in biological and chemical form, then what else can we call the American Nuclear arsenal? A child's toy? Can we ever forget the Hiroshima - Nagasaki holocaust??  I know that this piece may look ragged with no connections between pieces. But I have written down the thoughts as they came to mind.  I only hope that the War on terrorism should not become the  WAR TO TERRORISE  by the US...  Please feel free to send me your comments.

      Is the US pro-India or pro-Pakistan? A debate over the subject ran in the Sunday times dated April 27 2003. One of the commentators very rightly pointed out that the US is pro-America. How, otherwise can it justify the policy of declaring a war against terror, while supporting President Pervez Musharraf, funding Afghan war-lords who supposedly have links to the Taliban.  India has (once again) extended the hand of friendship and opportunity towards Pakistan. Commentators and analysts from various factions say that it is a right move and alos the timing of the move is impeccable. Pakistani Government has also replied to the offer with Enthusiasm and hope. The question is, will the enthusiasm last? Given the history of four wars between the countries and the deep resentment in the Pakistani people over India, one cannot help but be skeptical. It is now accepted that the road to SUSTAINABLE peace in the Indian sub-continent is through dialogue and peace talks, not-withstanding what some people on both the sides may believe. An attack on Pakistan and a war between the two nuclear weapons wielding countries will be catastrophic. Also history is witness that a peace gained by force is not sustainable. Unless the people have a deep feeling and want for peace, peace cannot be gained. Peace has to be accepted by all, not forced. People cannot live in peace and harmony if they have nay sort of resentment.  History now beckons India to be a peace maker in the region and the world without being a pacifist. Time has now come to stop toeing the US line and looking at the US for approval of our policies and actions. Every nation has its own set of priorities and it would be foolish to believe that any one would help another out of selfless service. Time now has come for India to assert her own belief in the world without any fear.  India is strong and self sufficient enough to sustain herself in the world and grow. What she needs to do is to inject some self belief into the population and divert the energy of the youth from the current pre-occupation of regional politicking towards the progress of India. We cannot depend on the politicians of India to do this. We, the people of India have to do this and I believe that we can do this. Let's wake up and work towards a common goal of progress and prosperity for India and the Indian populace. Let's wake up the sleeping giant. A giant called INDIAN.

        WI-FI: The new age of technology    I was recently reading an article in a magazine which was running Wi-Fi as their cover story. They say it heralds a new age of communication and connectivity. Actually end-user mobility has been there in the networks for a long time now. But the cost of mobility was very high, almost prohibitive. What really struck me in the article was the ease of configuration and low cost wireless equipment that is now available to end-users.  Using wireless access points and equipments a user can move anywhere around in the campus in a LAN without the hassles of carrying a mesh of cables and wires. Just imagine the peace of mind the user and the support staff will have with these. There are two standards on which this technology works: 802.11b and 802.11g. More to come on this later.

       I was just browsing the net to collect some information about the Wi-Fi standards 802.11 and I came across a really cool tutorial on 802.11 which I thought I would post it here. Please note that, I am not the author of the same and in no way am I taking credit for the same. I am just publishing it here for the benefit of bloggers who might be interested in Wi-Fi.  Also please note here that I am also posting all the credits of the authors and not violating any IPR.      A Short Tutorial on Wireless LANs and IEEE 802.11      Daniel L. Lough, T. Keith Blankenship, Kevin J. Krizman The Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University Blacksburg, Virginia 24061-0111  urlLink dlough@vt.edu ,  urlLink blanken@vt.edu , urlLink  kkrizman@vt.edu      1. Introduction   Over recent years, the market for wireless communications has enjoyed tremendous growth. Wireless technology now reaches or is capable of reaching virtually every location on the face of the earth. Hundreds of millions of people exchange information every day using pagers, cellular telephones, and other wireless communication products. With tremendous success of wireless telephony and messaging services, it is hardly surprising that wireless communication is beginning to be applied to the realm of personal and business computing. No longer bound by the harnesses of wired networks, people will be able to access and share information on a global scale nearly anywhere they venture. This article will try to answer some basic questions of why and where wireless local area networks can be used, and present a brief description of some protocols that have been developed, with emphasis on IEEE 802.11.    2. Some Motivation   Since the success of the Ethernet project at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center in the early 1970's [1] and other similar digital protocols, the basic technology has been in place for local area networks (LANs) to blossom in both the public and private sectors. Standard LAN protocols, such as Ethernet, that operate at fairly high speeds with inexpensive connection hardware can bring digital networking to almost any computer. Today, organizations of every size access and share information over a digital network; the power of networking and collaborative, distributed computing is beginning to be realized. However, until recently, LANs were limited to the physical, hard-wired infrastructure of the building. Even with phone dial-ups, network nodes were limited to access through wired, land line connections. Many network users, especially mobile users in businesses, the medical profession, factories, and universities, to name a few, find benefit from the added capabilities of wireless LANs [2] The major motivation and benefit from wireless LANs is increased mobility. Untethered from conventional network connections, network users can move about almost without restriction and access LANs from nearly anywhere. Examples of the practical uses for wireless network access are limited only by the imagination of the application designer. Medical professionals can obtain not only patient records, but real-time vital signs and other reference data at the patient bedside without relying on reams of paper charts and physical paper handling. Factory floor workers can access part and process specifications without impractical or impossible wired network connections. Wireless connections with real-time sensing allows a remote engineer to diagnose and maintain the health and welfare of manufacturing equipment, even on an environmentally-hostile factory floor. Warehouse inventories can be carried out and verified quickly and effectively with wireless scanners connected to the main inventory database. Even wireless "smart" price tags, complete with liquid crystal display (LCD) readouts, allow merchants to virtually eliminate discrepancies between stock-point pricing and scanned prices at the checkout lane. The list of possibilities is almost endless. In addition to increased mobility, wireless LANs offer increased flexibility. Again, imagination is the limiting parameter. One can visualize without too much difficulty a meeting in which employees use small computers and wireless links to share and discuss future design plans and products. This "ad hoc" network can be brought up and torn down in a very short time as needed, either around the conference table and/or around the world. Some car rental establishments already use wireless networks to help facilitate check-ins. Traders on Wall Street are able to use wireless terminals to make market trades. Even students of university campuses have been known to access lecture notes and other course materials while wandering about campus. Sometimes it is more economical to use a wireless LAN. For instance, in old buildings, the cost of asbestos cleanup or removal outweighs the cost of installing a wireless LAN solution. In other situations, such as a factory floor, it may not be feasible to run a traditional wired LAN. Wireless LANs offer the connectivity and the convenience of wired LANs without the need for expensive wiring or rewiring.    3. Mobile IP   Mobile IP [3] was suggested as a means to attain wireless networking. It focuses its attention at the Network Layer, working with the current version of the Internet Protocol (IP version 4). In this protocol, the IP address of the mobile machine does not change when it moves from a home network to a foreign network. In order to maintain connections between the mobile node and the rest of the network, a forwarding routine is implemented. When a person in the physical world moves, they let their home post office know to which remote post office their mail should be forwarded. When the person arrives at their new residence, they register with the new post office. This same operation happens in Mobile IP. When the mobile agent moves from its home network to a foreign (visited) network, the mobile agent tells a home agent on the home network to which foreign agent their packets should be forwarded. In addition, the mobile agent registers itself with that foreign agent on the foreign network. Thus, all packets intended for the mobile agent are forwarded by the home agent to the foreign agent which sends them to the mobile agent on the foreign network. When the mobile agent returns to its original network, it informs both agents (home and foreign) that the original configuration has been restored. No one on the outside networks need to know that the mobile agent moved. This configuration works, but it has some drawbacks. Depending on how far the mobile agent moves, there may need to be some store and forwarding of packets while the mobile agent is on neither the home nor the foreign network. In addition, Mobile IP works only for IPv4 and does not take advantage of the features of the newer IPv6.    4. IEEE 802.11 Architectures   In IEEE's proposed standard for wireless LANs (IEEE 802.11), there are two different ways to configure a network: ad-hoc and infrastructure. In the ad-hoc network, computers are brought together to form a network "on the fly." As shown in Figure 1, there is no structure to the network; there are no fixed points; and usually every node is able to communicate with every other node. A good example of this is the aforementioned meeting where employees bring laptop computers together to communicate and share design or financial information. Although it seems that order would be difficult to maintain in this type of network, algorithms such as the spokesman election algorithm (SEA) [4] have been designed to "elect" one machine as the base station (master) of the network with the others being slaves. Another algorithm in ad-hoc network architectures uses a broadcast and flooding method to all other nodes to establish who's who.   As shown in Figure 2, the second type of network structure used in wireless LANs is the infrastructure. This architecture uses fixed network access points with which mobile nodes can communicate. These network access points are sometime connected to landlines to widen the LAN's capability by bridging wireless nodes to other wired nodes. If service areas overlap, handoffs can occur. This structure is very similar to the present day cellular networks around the world.     5. IEEE 802.11 Layers   The IEEE 802.11 standard places specifications on the parameters of both the physical (PHY) and medium access control (MAC) layers of the network. The PHY layer, which actually handles the transmission of data between nodes, can use either direct sequence spread spectrum, frequency-hopping spread spectrum, or infrared (IR) pulse position modulation. IEEE 802.11 makes provisions for data rates of either 1 Mbps or 2 Mbps, and calls for operation in the 2.4 - 2.4835 GHz frequency band (in the case of spread-spectrum transmission), which is an unlicensed band for industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) applications, and 300 - 428,000 GHz for IR transmission. Infrared is generally considered to be more secure to eavesdropping, because IR transmissions require absolute line-of-sight links (no transmission is possible outside any simply connected space or around corners), as opposed to radio frequency transmissions, which can penetrate walls and be intercepted by third parties unknowingly. However, infrared transmissions can be adversely affected by sunlight [5], and the spread-spectrum protocol of 802.11 does provide some rudimentary security for typical data transfers. The MAC layer is a set of protocols which is responsible for maintaining order in the use of a shared medium. The 802.11 standard specifies a carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) protocol. In this protocol, when a node receives a packet to be transmitted, it first listens to ensure no other node is transmitting. If the channel is clear, it then transmits the packet. Otherwise, it chooses a random "backoff factor" which determines the amount of time the node must wait until it is allowed to transmit its packet. During periods in which the channel is clear, the transmitting node decrements its backoff counter. (When the channel is busy it does not decrement its backoff counter.) When the backoff counter reaches zero, the node transmits the packet. Since the probability that two nodes will choose the same backoff factor is small, collisions between packets are minimized. Collision detection, as is employed in Ethernet, cannot be used for the radio frequency transmissions of IEEE 802.11. The reason for this is that when a node is transmitting it cannot hear any other node in the system which may be transmitting, since its own signal will drown out any others arriving at the node. Whenever a packet is to be transmitted, the transmitting node first sends out a short ready-to-send (RTS) packet containing information on the length of the packet. If the receiving node hears the RTS, it responds with a short clear-to-send (CTS) packet. After this exchange, the transmitting node sends its packet. When the packet is received successfully, as determined by a cyclic redundancy check (CRC), the receiving node transmits an acknowledgment (ACK) packet. This back-and-forth exchange is necessary to avoid the "hidden node" problem, illustrated in Figure 3. As shown, node A can communicate with node B, and node B can communicate with node C. However, node A cannot communicate node C. Thus, for instance, although node A may sense the channel to be clear, node C may in fact be transmitting to node B. The protocol described above alerts node A that node B is busy, and hence it must wait before transmitting its packet.     6. Conclusions   IEEE 802.11 is still in the process of being adopted as a standard by the IEEE standards body. Although 802.11 provides a reliable means of wireless data transfer, some improvements to it have been proposed. For example, at Virginia Tech, research is being performed into ways in which the 802.11 network parameters can be dynamically adjusted to improve throughput [6] [7]. The use of wireless LANs is expected to increase dramatically in the future as businesses discover the enhanced productivity and the increased mobility that wireless communications can provide in a society that is moving towards more connectionless connections.    7.

      As I was saying the other day about Wi-Fi, there are two standards on which Wi-Fi works. The standard, 802.11b gives a throughput of 11Mbps (Bits) and the standard 802.11g gives a throughput of 54 Mbps. For normal end-users, this kind of bandwidth should be sufficient where the application of the wireless connection would be to access your files. emails, calendar etc in a meeting, on the move etc, for a short period of time. The response would of course be less than what the users are used to on the wired LAN, but having some access is better than not having at all, isn't it?  The main use of the wireless scenario would be access the internet. Given that the dial-up internet access still does not exceed 64 Kbps or 128 Kbps in most cases, the 802.11b standard should be more than enough for years to come. However, as noted earlier, in the office, the bandwidth requirements/ available are on the higher side, so it would make sense to go for the 802.11g standard equipments.  Also it is not required for the networking guys to enable wireless connectivity for all the users in the enterprise, the cost and other factors would be too prohibitive for that. However, we can target a few high priority users like the top managements, key sales personnel for wireless connectivity. OK now, this talks about the feasibility and the accessibility of the wireless network. We will look at the techincal part of the same in the coming days.  Till then cheers!!! Please do not hesitate to email me in case anyone has any comments on this.

        Magnetise your RAM; literally      Have you ever felt frustrated when you boot up your PC at the time the OS takes to boot up? If yes, then you can start rejoicing, as the solution is just aroung the corner.  Although the processing power of the PCs have increased manifold over the past few years, the footprint of the OS has also grown heavier so that it offsets the increase in speed and processing power. I remember some time back when the P-II 350 Mhz PCs were the latest rage with 64MB of RAM, I measured the boot up time of the PC. It took me a whole of 35 seconds. I was running Windows 95 at that time and remember that Windows 95 was a very light weight OS as compared to the biggies of today. Today also when I test the machine booting up time on a P-4 2.4 Ghz, 256 MB RAM machine, it takes more or less the same time.  Although 30 - 35 seconds may not sound a great deal, but when you are in a hurry it seems like eternity, and we are also talking about the applications processing time. The booting up process goes on something like this:  The processor starts up and the BIOS loads and passes control over to the processor   The processor reads the OS and loads the OS into RAM   The OS loads and the control is passed to the user.   This process may not be 100% accurate, but this is what takes place in a nutshell. The major time is taken up when the OS is being loaded into the RAM. The conventional RAM is a volatile one which requires electricity to store data. As soon as the electric power is cut off, the data stored in the RAM is lost.  As opposed to this, the  MRAM  (Magnetic RAM) uses magnetism to store the data. Magnetism as opposed to electricity, is not lost when power is removed. In fact it does not depend on electric supply at all. This will enable the PCs to run on less power as the requirement to give electric supply to RAMs at all time will not there.  As with all the new technologies, the question of cost comes up. Will this technology be costly. In one word, "No". The manufacturers are claiming that this technology will work at the speed of a SRAM (Synchronous RAM) at the cost of DRAM (Dynamic RAM). Given this fact made up sit up and take notice. IBM is one of the major players who are pushing hard to market this technology. You can expect this technology to hit the market sometime in 2005 as per the manufacturers.  This technology has the potential to change the computing practices forever. Watch out for this.

      I was trying to install Oracle 9i Release 2 database on my Linux (Fedora Core 1) computer at home. Consistently I was getting an error which referred to Java VM. The exact message was:  "/u01/tmp/oraInstall/jre/1.4.2/bin../lib/i686/green_threads/libzip.so: symbol errno, version GLIBC_2.0 not defined in file libc.so.6 with link time reference (libzip.so) Unable to initialize threads: cannot fint class java/lang/Thread Could not create Java VM"  I tried everything I knew and more to get around the error. But the error persisted. I tried installing the latest JRE, J2SDK and changing pointers to java directory. But the error still persisted. I started searching on the internet for the error and got a host of solutions to try.  urlLink Werner Puschitz's website  is a real treasure house on most of the issues that you might face on oracle installation. The error was that Oracle Universal installer was not compatible with the current kernel version 2.4.22. As mentioned by Werner, I set the LD_ASSUME_KERNEL parameter in the profile file (/home/oracle/.bash_profile) to an older one to 2.4.1. It can done on the command line also by running the following command:  oracle$ export LD_ASSUME_KERNEL=2.4.1  It works like a charm after that.  I thought all my installation worries were over by that time. But I checked  urlLink Oracle' s website   I saw a newer release of the database. I downloaded that and tried to install it. There I faced two problems. The files were in .gz (gzip) format.  I copied them on CDs and tried to unzip them. But got a message that the files are not in gzip format. I again searched on the internet and found out that browsers; more specifically netscape and mozilla based browsers unzip the files while downloading without any message and leave the .gz extension intact. So I renamed the files and was then able to successfully extract the cpio files to my harddisk.  After that I again tried installing the software and was greeted by another java related error which read like:  "Error occurred during initialization of VM Unable to load native library: /tmp/OraInstall2004-04-13_03-31-55PM/jre/lib/i386/libjava.so:            symbol ___libc_wait, version GLIBC_2.0 not defined in file libc.so.6 with link time reference"  Although the error looks the same it is totally different error.  To resolve the __libc_wait symbol issue, download the patch p3006854_9204_LINUX.zip from http://metalink.oracle.com. See bug 3006854 for more information.  To apply the patch, run  su - root # unzip p3006854_9204_LINUX.zip Archive:  p3006854_9204_LINUX.zip    creating: 3006854/   inflating: 3006854/rhel3_pre_install.sh   inflating: 3006854/README.txt  # cd 3006854 # sh rhel3_pre_install.sh Applying patch... Patch successfully applied #   NOTE: If you get the following error when you run rhel3_pre_install.sh:    rhel3_pre_install.sh: line 36: gcc: command not found  Then you forgot to install or link gcc, see above. This means you can't start any binaries any more:  # ls ls: error while loading shared libraries: /etc/libcwait.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory # rm /etc/ld.so.preload rm: error while loading shared libraries: /etc/libcwait.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory #  To fix that, run the echo command which is a built-in shell command:  # echo "" > /etc/ld.so.preload rm /etc/ld.so.preload  And start over again.   Now runInstaller can be started from the CD:  su - oracle $ echo $LD_ASSUME_KERNEL    # it is important that this variable is set! 2.4.1  Again  urlLink Werner's website  came to my rescue.  OK I knew I had to install the patch but when I tried the obvious place (oracle metalink) I had to get an oracle id for that. I searched the internet with p3006854_9204_LINUX.zip as the search string and came up with this website http://www.mainframeforum.com/t624262.html. It contains that patch and all the other required patches and links to them. On installing the patch, the oracle installation went off smooth.  I hope this helps someone who is facing same problems as me.

       Friends    Gems may be precious, but friends are priceless. --Unknown  Everyone hears what you say. Friends listen to what you say. Best friends listen to what you don't say. --Unknown  Friendship is one mind in two bodies. --Mencius  I was just reading through some of the friendship quote & these are some of them that touched me. I felt I identify with these statements a lot. I guess I happen to be one of those lucky people who can confidently & proudly say that   "I have a best friend".    What can I say about my best friend? She's the best one can have. I have started feeling special from the time I have met her. I feel I can be myself with her around and there is no need for pretenses. She knows so much about me that if she wants she can blackmail me with it.. But I know she won't as she is a my best friend & she is someone I can trust.  We have had innumerable tiffs & quarrels. But the quarrels never last for more than 5 minutes & the friendship has grown stronger than ever. There have been moments of doubts as what would happen when we are no longer in the same town or place. But I feel friendship does not obey the physical boundaries. Its like:  "Once a friend, always a friend".  We will always be friends as long as I live.

       Undercutting the Undercutter   A leading ERP & e-business vendor in China has recently been quoted saying that it can get things done for less money than its Indian counterparts. This follows closely on the heels of its starting a new outsourcing branch targeting the US market.  Not surprisinly enough, the average annual salaries of an average Chinese programmer is anywhere between $5248 to $9000, way below what an average Indian programmer earns in an year (average $10000), the report says.  Although China has come up into global market as a force to reckon with, its main business area still remains manufacturing, where there is minimum interaction with the West & the language is not a problem. But for a white collared job where frequent interactions are required with the client, I think China will have serious problems. After all, no one would want their software & the supporting documentation to be developed in Chinese.  Secondly, a single company cannot be called as an industry & a threat to the established Indian Software industry. It will take a long time for China to catch up with India in the Software export race.

       Zidane's Magic (?)   Had it been a cricket match; especially between India & Pakistan, people would have cried foul immediately after the match would have ended in such a tight finish and speculated about match fixing. But it was football, Euro 2004 Group B opening match between England and France.  England after leading 1-0 for all the match, inexplicably lost (threw?) the match to lose 2-1. Not doubting Zizou's genius, but to concede 2 goals in less than 3 minutes, its just too much for me to believe. All the experts also said the foul on Zidane was needless. But was it really needless or was it delibrate? Also the second infringement that resulted in a penalty. Pretty hard to believe.  Was the match fixed in France's favour? We won't know. There is so much betting nowadays in Football, I won't rule out the possibility.

      There has been a lot written about the fiasco of the Olympic torch run that happened in New Delhi last week. I was really ashamed to see the list of best athletes missing from the names of the people who were the torch bearers representing India. No doubt the Indian Olympic cause can do with a little bit of publicity, but certainly not at the cost of athletes who have sweated their blood for the country & toiled very hard to bring glory to the nation.  It was really shameful to see film celebrities participate in the run and most of them not even able to run properly nor able to hold the torch properly. Is it so hard to understand that importance of the symbol that the torch signifies? They all needed someone to hold their hands just to hold the torch properly.  I sincerely hope that the sports ministry does not do a similar 'Faux Pas' in the future & the athletes get their due in terms of recognition of their effort & monetary benefits. Is Mr.Dutt listening?

      Bangalore Diary - 20 July 2004  &nbsp;  Being from Pune, I thought I had seen them all. Pune boasts about some of the weirdest signs in this words. I am talking about the signs that you put on your doors / gates like: "Beware of Dog" or "Salesmen not allowed". But my belief was shattered day before yesterday when I saw a sign on a house in J. P. Nagar in Bangalore which said: "Beware of Coconuts". Coconuts??? How much more weird can this world get?

        Linux markets hot up in Asia     Adding to the already numerous flavours of Linux available today, Oracle has come out with Asianux, a flavour specifically targeted at Asian markets which already had a strong demand for Linux in Enterprise Server Systems. Oracle claims it is ready for the market ( urlLink http://www.computerworld.com/softwaretopics/os/linux/story/0,10801,94637,00.html ). Asianux was developed jointly by Red Flag Software Co. in China & Miracle Linux Corp in Japan. Oracle holds a 58.5% stake in Miracle Linux Corp.   So what's new &amp; different with another version of Linux coming out? The major difference that I can see is this flavour unlike others is supported by an industry heavy-weight & Oracle will definitely want Asianux to be profitable commercially as they have a major stake in its development. Oracle is well established &amp; can push their products on Asianux &amp; can promote it to their existing customers and dramatically increase it user base.   I feel Asianux is one Linux distribution to watch out for in the coming days...

      As Linux gets more and more popular &amp; finds a large user base, we can be sure that the creators of virus programs will turn their attention towards it sooner than later. Already there have been some outbreaks of virus aimed at Linux. Most notable among them are: 1. Linux/Slapper 2. Linux/Lion 3. Linux/Ramen  Not much was heard about the outbreaks of these viruses as is generally experienced with viruses that attach Microsoft systems is mainly because the Linux user community as compared to Windows users is very very small and the user base that uses Linux in a corporate environment with huge amount of critical production data is even smaller. Most of the users using linux use it as a laboratory environment for testing or as an hobby same as yours truly does.  Of the above viruses, Linux/Slapper has hit the Linux user base the hardest, with about 14000 computers getting affected by it according to one industry report ( urlLink http://www.virusbtn.com/news/latest_news/granneman.xml ). Although the number is not very high when compared to the numbers reported by Windows users affected by virus, it warns the users of the things to come in the very near future.  If Linux wants to seriously challenge Windows as the preferred desktop operating systems then the open source community and the ISVs for Linux would have to pay more attention on securing the operating system. One would be very foolish indeed to ignore the signs of things to come.

      Bangalore Diary - 28 July 2004   Some more signboards   I was wrong, I admit it I was wrong. I thought this world cannot become weirder. My belief was shattered in less than a week.  I had gone to the Income Tax office in Bangalore to file my annual returns... What a pain it is!!! Anyhow cribbing about the difficulty of filling SARAL (which incidently means easy) is not the point of writing this. When I entered the elevator (lift) to reach the 4th floor to submit my form, I noticed another weird sign on the elevator wall. It read: "Lift only till 3rd floor. To reach 4th floor, turn left &amp; walk" What else do people do in that building? Crawl, slide???? I mean how else can a guy reach from one place to another within a building??? And how does providing lift only till 3rd floor make sense in building having 4 floors? Did the architect or engineer forgot that they were building a 4 storeyed building?   If I continue noticing such signs in Bangalore then I am sure Bangalore will dethrone Pune as the Wierdest sign board Capital of the world...

      I have learnt this over a period of time. You should be careful in who you call as your best friend. Calling a person as your best friend brings in a set of expectations. A best friend tries to fulfil those expectations always no matter what & there is not phrase like impossible. A best friend is always there for you when you need someone alongside you.    I think its best not to have a best friend. You risk getting disappointed. No expectations... no falling short of expectations... no disappointment... no unhappy moments... Sounds simple, doesn't it? But its not always that simple. Once you consider someone as your best friend its pretty difficult not to have expectations &amp; you can't help feeling disappointed.    That's what I plan to do henceforth. I won't have any expectations from my best friend. This was my first weekend alone after a long long time and I felt that my best friend could have spent some time with me just to make me feel good. But it was not to be. It does not mean that I consider someone as a best friend means that that person should consider me as a best or even a good friend. Just a matter of matching the expections, no?

      I was just reading through some articles on Linux when I happened to come across an article on a distribution of Linux called  urlLink UnitedLinux  that caught my attention. Not that this was a little known distribution. I recall reading about it sometime back in 2002 but at that time, I was more interested in getting my feet wet in this industry & fascinated by Red Hat Linux (I still am...).  What made UnitedLinux different was that it was a collaborative effort from four of the big software vendors - SUSE Linux AG, the former Caldera International Inc. (now known as The SCO Group Inc.), Turbolinux Inc. and Conectiva SA. It seemed like a sure winner having such a developer base & funding behind it.  But things changed dramatically and very fast. SCO is more interested in suing people to make money rather than developing & selling software, SUSE has been bought over by Novell Inc. &amp; Turbolinux underwent a ownership change & then moved out of US market space.  Despite this Unitedlinux still is being sold & supported all the partners except SCO. But the Unitedlinux website has not been updated since April 2003. In the what's new section of its website, the last posting is of 22nd April 2003. Hardly a new posting...  So what happens to Unitedlinux in the future? Not that the whole world will come to grinding halt if Unitedlinux goes down under, but I fear that it would be sad ending to a very good project which had a lot of promise to deliver to end-users and developers in terms of a solid non-Microsoft operating system which was cheap and at the same time well supported &amp; also it does not usher a good news for similar Linux initiatives.

      India lost in the finals of Asia cup cricket tournament today, again... As per the statistics, India has lost in 10 finals, shared 2 & won only 1 in the last two years. But that is not the point. The point I am trying to make here is that the debate will again come up that whether Tendulkar is a match winner or is he just a run-machine.  Looking at the match, the memories of the Indian team in the late 90's came flooding to me wherein Tendulkar would always be the lone ranger fighting doggedly against opponents and the other batsmen kept falling at the other end like nine pins. Today's Indian side is much more reliable in terms of contribution from all the team members. But today that very thing was lacking. The scorecard tells a very sad story. After Tendulkar's 74 the next highest is 28 from no. 10 Zaheer Khan and that too in slog overs and 25 extras. None of the other star batsmen could cross even 20.  Tendulkar stood alone like a giant among dwarfs. Trying to win the match on his own. All he needed was a partner who could hold up the other end &amp; just keep on taking singles. But none of the guys could do even that. Tendulkar was making batting look so easy. Ultimately he started running out of partners, overs and ultimately his patience.  India has again ended up being a bridesmaid. No idea when India will start winning tournaments with regularity. Only God knows.
