      I can't believe mike asked me to have sex with him today...out of no where..you just dont ask somebody that..."what are you doing wednesday" wow...i totally didn't expect it..It made me realize hes just like every other guy..I was beginnin to think he might be different..but I guess not..I told him to take me home..but he wouldn't..he pulled into a parking lot and told me he wouldn't take me home until i wasn't mad anymore. so I told him if he was really sorry he'd take me home..so..he looked at me with these big sad eyes and turned on the car...and turn around and took me home. He tried to hold my hand..but...I pushed it away..and gave him a look of disgust..I could tell it really hurt him..but..he deserved it. He tried again a couple of times..until I finally said "PLEASE..don't touch me.." he kept apologizing..I told him to just not talk..so he kept quiet. when i got home...he called me a little while later..begging for me to forgive him. what a baby...he told me over and over again that wasn't all he wanted from me when he asked me to be his girlfriend..I still dont believe him..he finally got me to forgive him..but..i told him hes not allowed to touch me..or kiss me..which he claims he loves doing..and does all the time..even in front of his friends...well, I hope he suffers through every day..I told him if he touched me, I'd break up with him for good. My plan in the beginning..was just to make him wait 4 months for sex..but because of this little incident..i made it into forever. we are never having sex now...and i hope he regrets asking such a dumb question..and making me feel so horrible. Maybe thats all he really wants..maybe he's just pretending not to mind..maybe he thinks that he'll eventually get it..and then he'll leave me..whatever. I'm over him already..and we haven't even broken up..awhile ago..If we were to break up..or if he cheated on me..I'd be upset and cry for days..but now...it wouldn't affect me one bit. there are always other guys..hes not that special..I mean..he only comes up to my chin..im 5"7..he's 5"4...Its supposed to be the GUY thats taller than the girl..but...its not that way with him. Not even that..but I REALLY like taller guys..i've never dated a guy shorter than me...and theres not even any hope that he'll grow. hes 18..he's not going to be growing anymore..If he was like 6"0..I'd probably be in love with him..lol..tall guys turn me on..but yeah..hes cute in his own way..his smile..the way he kisses me...his green eyes..they all make up for it. i don't know how long this is going to last...maybe a month at the most. oh well. maybe I will learn something from this..one thing is for sure..i've become a WAY better kisser. and i know this sounds horrible but i have had sex with a lot of guys..and...not one was ever my boyfriend. not before..not after..never. Thats why I insist on me and mike not having sex...From now on, I'm not going to have sex with just..random guys..who don't even care about me. It hurts after...usually I am drunk, so I don't care...but when it wears off..I realize..this guy doesn't care about me, this guy will never care about me..He doesn't want anything to do with me..He wanted one thing, he got it..and now he'll be gone as soon as he appeared..thinking about it used to make me cry. now I just promise myself it won't happen again..thats why I am so upset that he asked me that...I'm glad i didn't already. i'd hate myself. It worries me..that that might be all he wants from me..cause before..I told him i wouldnt have sex with him cause he wasn't my boyfriend...then five minutes later, he asked me to be his girlfriend..I laughed and said no, and told him hes so stupid to actually think I'd say yes after i had just told him that..he said "no no its not cause of that" Then i TOLD him it'd be four months before id have sex with him anyway.. and he said "ok" and pretended he didn't mind..said he could wait..and now..we're "going out"..and he goes and asks me that? as if i would forget. my opinion of him..has been crushed. I love it..at the beginning of a relationship..where you don't see anything wrong with them...they seem so perfect..you want to tell everyone about them, and you do. anyone who will listen. or even tell people who aren't listening. who cares..you just love talking about them. u like them so much..but..then you begin to see all of their faults..and..you like them less and less..you realize what type of person they really are..Anybody can pretend to be someone they're not. but only for so long. after awhile, their true self begins to come out..maybe his is already on the way out. I always stop liking people..before we get to close. I think i've already begun to do that..I feel like avoiding him for some reason. I always feel that way...even when in the beginning i really like them. no matter how much i like someone...its never too long before I start to feel...pressured..and..too tied down..I feel like i have to escape..and i start to avoid them..even if i hate every second of it. i can't help it..its become a habit now. i don't want to hurt him..but..I can't control it...I hope he doesn't end up liking me too much..I wish i could tell him beforehand..that..this will never turn out to be what he wants it to be...it hasnt even been a week...and i'm already starting to fade away from him...
