      well, it's new year's eve.  we're about to enter the year 2004, which sort of surprises me because my mind still thinks we're in the 90's.  time is a funny thing.  time can drag on and on and make anything seem like an eternity...but at the same time it can speed up so fast that if you blink you miss everything.  right now time is flying by for me.  i think part of that is because i'm on break right now, and i'm really not looking forward to going back to teach bratty high schoolers.  time has also melted together...days are all intertwined and there doesn't appear to be any separation besides the few hours of sleep i get every night.  i want to go back in time and enjoy things i took for granted.  i want to recreate my past.  i'm sick of being haunted by things i can't change...and every day brings another mistake i can't take back.  it's hard to want to go forward when you know that the mountain of mistakes and regrets will keep growing bigger with every day that passes.  i'm not sure i'm ready to start a new year...not that it matters since nothing really changes besides the date.  it's just i'd like to think that i'd be off to a new start...a better start.  i hope this year is better than the last.  i'm worried that it won't be.  the thing is that all of humanity seeks out and waits for milestones to spur us on to great change. we say, "this year will be different because..." and we imagine all of the possibilities, which we convince ourselves to believe.  resolutions are thrown around and everyone asks everyone else what we're going to change about ourselves.  the same question asked at any other time of year would cause us to become defensive of our character, because the question suggests that we aren't good enough being who we are and that we must change to be the "ideal person."  instead we smile, and we come up with something to impress them.  a flipped calendar is our excuse for change, plain and simple.  this year, i won't be changing anything.  there are things, sure, that i should change, or so people tell me, but change isn't really up to me.  i used to believe in my own power to make myself into whatever i wanted to be, but the truth is that every plan i've made has failed, and there's a simple reason for that:  what life has in store for me is too great for me to try and contain with a couple of resolutions.  start exercising, cut back on the excessive spending, eat better, don't waste so much time, read more, be more organized - but those are things we should all do.  that's not life changing, i'm sorry to say.  that kind of change is left to the hands of fate, to time and circumstance, change is controlled by environment and emotion and isn't something we can possibly determine to direct.  there is too much life out there for us to control it.

      talking to kurt this morning made me feel a little better.  he doesn't think that i want shea in an obsessive unhealthy manner.  although, who knows what he tells shea when i'm not around.  for all i know he agrees completely with shea when he's around him, and agrees with me when he's around me, since he tends to do that.  he does still think that i want shea to a certain extent, but not nearly to the extent shea believes.  it's understandable for him to think this.  part of me probably does still want him to a certain degree, but i don't think it's uncommon to have a "soft spot" for someone they used to date and be intimate with.  however, like he said himself, he's a heartless bastard.  he's not at all someone i would want to have a relationship with.  now i'm questioning if he is truly someone i should be friends with.  kurt brought up an interesting point.  he said part of the reason why he still thinks i have some feelings for shea is because i still want to be friends with him besides the fact that he used me and objectified me.  this is so true...the part about him objectifying and using me.  my initial defense is that i was doing the same to him...even if that doesn't make it right at all or any better...  i really don't have a good reason for still wanting to be friends with him.  it's interesting.  we had decided to just be friends after "dating" for a short period of time because he thought my friendship was more valuable and that he didn't want to lose it, because unlike me, he didn't think that dating would bring us closer in the end.  essentially, he was right about that part.  we are as far apart as we can possibly be and still be friends.  i don't think he considers my friendship to be even close to calibur it was before.  i don't think that losing my friendship would mean anything to him.  the problem is that it would mean something to me...and at this point i'm not sure why.  i don't take friendship lightly.  i have very few close friends and even fewer with whom i would share my feelings or thoughts.  it hurts me so much every time i lose someone that i've shared so much with...but maybe it's for the best.  i guess there's an advantage to losing their friendship...they can't hurt you with the secrets they know about you.  the question is now what to do.  so, i'll be evaluating what he really means to me over the next few months...and decide if he's really worth keeping as a friend or not.  like i said before though, if he doesn't make an effort to be my friend then i'm not going to make an effort to be his friend.  i don't believe in keeping one-sided friendships.  i have such a strong desire to just move out west and start a new life.  i know this sort of contradicts what i said earlier about not taking friendship lightly, but in a way, i just want to start with a new slate.  make new friends.  lose all of my past friends.  be who i want to be and not have anyone from my past around to change anyone's impression of me or hold me back from what i can become.  i want to change how i am seen in everyone else's eyes.  everybody here has already judged me and i can't do anything to change how they see me and who they think i am.  people change but oftentimes the changes are masked by what others already know.  i'm so sick of minnesota.  i'm sick of the people...i'm sick of the view...i'm sick of the snow.  "have i turned my back on minneapolis?  ok, alright.  ...something as wrong as this mentality...just makes this place a bigger tragedy.  don't look up, don't look down, don't keep me locked up in this town...the cold, sub-creative, stupid, manipulative atmosphere.  i don't belong in your sick comedy, try making sense, try making harmony.  please don't make me stick around.  maybe it's home for you, but what about me?  laid to rest, my soul remains, an hysterical disease.  try to stop me if you please.  will it hurt to make your first mistake?  will you tell me how it feels?  cause they're always right, never wrong in spite of the painful irony.  how can this be?  maybe i'll take my own advice and just leave."

      here's a poem for you- the last did not concern you, the one on the fridge...  please accept the truth i don't want to be with you i deserve better  things got out of hand we did things we shouldn't have but it meant nothing  why do you doubt me? addicted to touch, not you so full of yourself  i do care for you... i love you, but as a friend too bad you can't see  you know so little you'll never understand me and vice versa  wish we could go back i'm sorry we ever touched it ruined you and i  we've drifted apart uncomfortable with me keep squeezing me out...  if that's what it takes for you to have peace of mind and to live with it  but i plead with you, please don't give up on me yet we are both broken

      tonight it finally came out, and i'm glad it finally came out...i've been waiting.  just as i had suspected, he believes that i want to be with him.  apparently, unknown to myself,  i am obsessed with him and everybody has noticed it.  i don't really understand what signals i send that suggest this.  as far as i know, i act about the same way with him as i do all of my other friends.  true, maybe i've been more touchy feely with him than others, but that's because he's touchy feely too.  i'm generally a touchy feely person unless i know that it bothers someone, and with him i've always assumed it was okay since he did it back.  i guess maybe people could interpret that as me liking him.  he, of course, doesn't believe me when i tell him that i don't want to be with him.  in fact, he  knows  i am denying it and "accepts" it because there are so many others that want him more than he wants them.  if you ask me, that's a little cocky to say.  it must be hard having so many people like you...  honestly, i really don't see it.  he's decent looking, not extraordinary though.  he's smart, but always thinks he's right and isn't all that open-minded.  he isn't that good of a lover, not that i think i am at all, and perhaps it's different if he really likes someone, but for having as much "experience" as he has, i think he'd be a lot better than he is.  he's mean, immature, and sexist.  he's careless with his money.  he doesn't communicate, and shoots down the efforts of anyone trying to communicate with him.  he smokes way too much.  he's an alcoholic.  but of course, like with anyone, there are the good and the bad and i feel awful only mentioning the bad.  so here are some good things...i guess i fell for him because i think he understands more than most.  and he is independent and knowledgable.  he also cares so much about his friends.  and knowing that he had felt real pain and could relate to pain that i've been through.  it also didn't hurt that he likes a lot of the same music.  i dug those blue eyes too...and the thought of someone liking me sort of clinched the deal.  even though we started messing around a year ago, i didn't actually start liking him until this summer when he started to express interest in me.  that's how almost all of my relationships start...which is probably why they end up being based purely on physical closeness.  someone likes me and my first reaction is "ugh, i could never date them!" and then all of a sudden, i start to like them back because i think about it over and over again.  i think that's actually pretty common.  not to mention that when i really started to like him, it was to the him i talked to online while i was hundreds of miles away.  i wonder if he ever really did like me as more than a friend, or if it was all just a series of lies.  it wouldn't surprise me at all if it was the latter.  i've told him lies...well not really lies...i've misconstrued the truth many times when we've had conversations - which may be why he thinks i want him a lot more than i do.  i'm a confused girl and say things i don't really mean about 90% of the time.  i'm not at all consistent...i wonder if he's noticed...it's all about trying to get morsels of information...and coming at it from different angles...i wanted to understand.  unfortunately, he doesn't give out that information, no matter what i say.  and going back to my question...i wonder if i ever meant anything to him.  and if he did like me, i wonder when he decided that he didn't want me.  and if i did mean something to him, what did i mean to him?  i want to ask all of these questions but i'm afraid that he'll lie about it or will get pissed off that i asked.  i guess that any attention i give him goes to his head and he takes it as a sign that i want to be with him...so starting now i suppose i'll start treating him differently and be more aware of my actions toward him...don't want him to get the wrong impression.  it's unfortunate that we can't act like how we used to before we got involved...but if this is what he wants, it's what he's going to get.  i wonder when cochran's moving away party was.  i think that is when i finally "got over" him for good...although there was still that physical aspect going on.  in fact, i was just about over him right after the mya incident...but then kind of tripped again.  mike is right in that my problem is i have an addiction to touch, and as much as i tell myself not to do something, i'm weak and give in.  i wish he really understood me.  i am attached to him, in a way, but it's an attachment to touch.  all of my past relationships have been based on my attachment to touch...not the actual person...but being touched by someone.  the physical relationship we've had for the past year only really meant something for about 3 months during which i developed feelings for him...only to realize that i couldn't see myself with him forever.  i knew that i didn't want to have his children.  i knew that i didn't want to marry him.  i knew that i didn't actually love him.  i knew it was a bad idea in the beginning, and i know it now.  he's not who i'm looking for.  so as we continued to "mess around," i didn't associate the closeness with any feelings of affection for him and knew that he was doing the same.  i'm sure that it meant as much to me as it did to him...i'm sorry shea, but it's the physical closeness i want, not you.  i wish he knew this.  i wish he understood this.  i wish he believed this.  i consider him to be one of my closest friends.  he's one of my only true friends.  sometimes i feel like i can tell him anything, but lately i feel like he doesn't want to hear it.  mike is my closest friend but we've drifted away some because of his girlfriend and now living together.  the difference is that i *know* i can always tell mike anything.  and i do.  i wonder why he hasn't told shea about all the conversations i've had with him where i expressed how much i didn't want to be with him.  shea insists that everyone thinks i want him in an obsessive way, but i don't see how mike or kurt could think this considering i've had so many conversations with them about how much i don't like shea and how what we were doing didn't mean anything to me.  i'll never understand.  i'm thankful for them all nonetheless.  they are all very special friends of mine and mean a lot to me.  anyway, the point i was trying to get at was that perhaps this is what people are noticing.  i do love him, but it's not at all in an obsessive compulsive "i want him" nature, it's a "i'd do anything for him because i love him as one of my closest friends" nature.  i'm looking out for him and i would truly do anything for him.

      i'm back "home" now and i've come to a startling discovery...well maybe it's not all that startling.  being here makes me depressed.  and i mean really depressed.  actually it's not even being here that does it, it's having the guys around.  they don't even need to be mean or anything...just present.  i was completely fine and happy on my way up here, and even when i got here and no one was home.  as soon as they walked in i could feel my body tense up and become withdrawn.  it's really weird how apparent it is now after being away for a while.  and to think i was so ready to get away from my parent's house.  gosh, i just can't go anywhere to feel normal.  i'm actually beginning to think i have something wrong with me.  the trouble sleeping, the change in appetite, the long-lasting bruises, the blackouts/dizziness, the depression, the anxiety, the irritability, the uncontrolled crying and emotional releases.  i'm going to try and make a doctor's appointment on monday.  i hope i don't have something wrong with my thyroid or have anemia or something.  i really hate getting blood taken, but unfortunately that's what i'm going to have to have done.  anyway, i gave the guys their presents tonight.  it didn't really make me happy, in fact it made me feel so sad i came up to my room and cried.  the thing is that only one of them got me a present and i think the other 2 felt really bad for not getting me anything.  i didn't expect anything from any of them so that didn't bother me at all, but the fact that i could tell they felt bad made me feel bad.  maybe they didn't feel bad about not getting me anything but rather that they treat me so horribly.  i think i would be alright with that.  unfortunately, i've decided i shouldn't move out until summer since i don't know the status of my job for next year...so i won't be able to give one of them the ultimate thing he wants...for me to be gone before spring break.  he never said this exactly...in fact i'm pretty sure i said it during the conversation, but he did say something that led me to believe that he wanted me to leave as soon as possible and that he didn't want me to be here at all.  it's obvious - actions speak louder than words.  his girl toy just came over.  she got a new piercing...a nose ring.  the kind that goes through both nostrils...an actual ring...sort of like what bulls have.  i still don't like her.  i just have a gut feeling that something is wrong about her.  i don't think she is good.  she gives me this "dirty" feeling.  it's not my problem though...if he likes her than i am happy for him.  hopefully she brings him the happiness he needs.  and hopefully she won't end up coming in-between our friendship...even though i think it's inevitable since i feel it's already ruined our friendship quite a bit.  that's alright...i'm independent and strong.  i'm used to all of my friends leaving me, so what's another?  i need to not let myself get attached to anybody ever again.  not as a friend, not as a lover.  i don't need anybody.

      i've known that i talk in my sleep occassionally but it's usually something that makes sense.  last night, according to my sister, i kept repeating "alpha king" over and over again in a melodic rhythm.  that's so weird.  i wonder what it meant...

      i can't decide...is it better being at home or living with the boys?  it's really a toss up. i think i've decided that it would be best not to come back home unless it's necessary.  sure, i love seeing my family...but our house is so messed up and my family really is dysfunctional.  sometimes it just really makes sense why i'm the way i am.  nobody really knows about it...and everybody thinks i have a perfect, "normal", "real" family but the truth is that we're not normal and we're far from perfect.  and a lot of screaming goes on, although that's the worst it gets.  i really hate arguments and yelling.  i've realized that i'm a lot like my dad too...which sort of frustrates me.  not that he's not a good guy or anything, but he's forgetful and is super defensive and takes everything the wrong way...and we don't get along a good deal of the time.  i hate to think of myself having those same qualities but i know i do.  i spent a good hour of my night cleaning up dog vomit.  the dog i'm petsitting for must have gotten sick today and threw up quite a few places.  not my idea of fun, that's for sure.  i hope there isn't more to clean up tomorrow.  they are coming home tomorrow so that will be nice not worrying about her being sick.  one of my new year's resolutions is to start writing in this blog the way i should be writing in it...and keep it from being a place to just complain about things going on in my life.  we'll work on that.  and one last thing...is it so bad to call it the "fridgerator"?!?!?!

      one of my favorite things about christmas is eating pink cookies.  they are so good.  i'm petsitting right now...i love dogs.  i'm happy to be "home" too and see my 5 dogs.  they make me so happy.  i desperately need to get my own puppy for up in minnesota.  it's so weird coming down here and not having any snow whatsoever.  i have the strongest urge to move out west...washington or oregon...or possibly colorado.  i miss the fresh air.  i bought one of my roommates such a thoughtful christmas gift...the one that i can't tell if he really hates me or not.  i wonder if he'll think it's thoughtful and care that i got it for him.  i ordered it all of the way from his old hometown - whitefish, montana.  i like giving presents...but i hate picking them out.  for some odd reason i've been really good at picking out presents lately.  i've been really creative when it comes to that...and writing poetry.  i think it's because i feel like i'm getting to know people better so i can actually get them things they would like because i really know what they would like.  i've never really had close friends because i moved around so much and was so shy.  that's why it hurts so much to know that these guys are starting to hate me and want me out of their lives...they are my 3 closest friends and i don't think they realize how much they mean to me and how much i want them in my life.

      sometimes i wish i had never moved in with the boys because then maybe things wouldn't be so screwed up between us.  i was such good friends with them.  now i just feel like everything we have is rapidly disintegrating.  they did give me a hug tonight to say goodbye for christmas since they probably won't be up tomorrow before i leave.  that felt good.  none of them have hugged me lately...in fact none of them have even gotten within touching distance of me.     i'm sort of sad that i'm going to be spending new year's "alone" and by "alone" i mean the guys are going to be preoccupied with their "girlfriends"...and will probably end up locking themselves in their rooms with them...and i won't have anyone to even talk to that night.  i guess there is a possibility that i'll be going to a party that one of my colleaques is throwing.  he's looking into possible date setups for me, which is cool.  i'm not sure i actually want to have a boyfriend...ever....but i suppose going out on a few dates, meeting new people, and having fun isn't bad.  i am just really at a point in my life when i don't think i need anyone and i've realized that it's more hassle and unnecessary pressure to be with someone when you don't get all that much out.  not saying this is always the case, and maybe it's different if the other person actually loves you.  unfortunately i haven't been that lucky yet...i don't think any of the guys i have dated really saw me as more than an object and none of them loved me.  i keep dreaming that i'll find someone that thinks the world of me and truly wants to be with me.  i'm certainly not holding my breath though.  and like i said before, i'm perfectly alright with being alone forever.  i'm strong...

      ah, break is finally here.  i'm ecstatic.  i think i'm heading home tomorrow...or sunday.  i haven't decided for sure yet.  part of me really wants to leave tomorrow because 1) i'll be getting away from here sooner, 2) i'll get to see my family and puppies sooner, and 3) i won't have to drive far on sunday because i'll already be home.  however, part of me just wants to stick around here a little bit longer so i can 1) clean my room, 2) play jak & daxter, 3) try to make amends with the boys, 4) not have to drive a long way tomorrow and 5) put off going home and being put to work on cleaning the house.   ugh...i have so much to do.  i desperately need to start doing my christmas cards.  i should bring some of my games home so i can play with my sisters.  i really feel like playing dominos or monopoly right now.  oh, i went to see return of the king tonight.  it was great.  of course there were quite a few cutouts from the book...and a good portion of the movie was from the two towers book.  but nonetheless, it will be a classic.  i'm excited to act out parts of the fellowship & the two towers with my sisters when i go home.  i really miss having them around...i'm certainly not as happy without them here.  krista is hilarious and kelly is just weird.  i actually sort of feel like myself around them.   oh, it will be good to see them.  it will also be fun to housesit/petsit for a few days.  remind me i have to buy ski pants and a pair of mittens wouldn't hurt either.

      until christmas break!  or i guess...winter break to be p.c.  it seems like this week has just been dragging on forever.  guess that's always the way.  i'm so excited to be away from school for 2 whole weeks.  and then the semester will end a few weeks after coming back...and the best part is that i will be getting all new classes and be able to start new with them.  i feel like my students are at the point where they hate me and i'm not too fond of them either...we just all get on each other's nerves.  i wish i was teaching at minneapolis south again.  i hate to say it but the majority of my students are rich snobs that are extremely selfish and think they are better than everyone else so they don't need to follow directions.  as soon as they are asked to do something...like the daily classwork...they whine to mommy and daddy and then they are screaming at me for all of the lies their child told them...and of course their child would never lie.  it's really frustrating.  today i was accused of being a racist by one of the parents, when the reason her son is losing daily behavior points is because he refuses to stop talking during my lectures...but of course, since he's not white, i  must  be racist.  if i had been offered a job an inner-city school, i would have taken that in a heartbeat...and usually whites are the minorities there.  tell me, would a racist be willing to teach in an environment like that?  i've also taught in hawaii and had very few white students, and i loved that.  okay, i really don't need to justify myself so i don't know why i feel like i have to.  it's a defensive thing...it sort of bothers me that someone thinks that i am acting in a way that suggests racism.     i think it's awesome to have different races and cultures brought into a classroom...it makes it more exciting.  in fact, i wish i had a lot more non-white students.  i wonder why everyone always accuses people of being racist when there haven't been any signs of racism.  is it just something people are brought up to believe?  if so, i think that is devastating.  anyway, the apartment search is going slow.  i looked at a few places online that had actual pictures and i REALLY want a loft apartment.  unfortunately that would run me about $200 more a month than i really should pay.  maybe someday...when i'm sure i'll have a job next year (i'm in a one-year position right now, filling in for a teacher that had a baby last year...although there is a retirement in the math dept. this year so it's hopeful that i'll stay).  if i don't have a job next year, i think maybe i'll take a year off and travel and take some classes towards my masters at the u.  i'm not too worried about it.  i have found a few apartments that i'm going to look into, so that feels kind of nice.  ugh...my room is a disaster...i don't even know where to start cleaning...but i guess i should get going on it...i'm off.

      alright, so the first step is admitting the addiction, right?  okay...here it goes...my name is kerry and i am a jak & daxter addict.   ah, i feel better getting that off my chest ;)  anyway, i played non-stop today from about 6 to 11.  then i came up to my room to watch donald in mathmagic land to see if i should show it in one of my classes thursday.  as i was getting ready for bed around midnight, the boys called me up.  turns out that they are stranded on some exit ramp in the cities.  so, i went to rescue them and on the way got super lost because i have such stellar direction sense.  finally, i found them and brought them home.  since i had been out and about i could no longer sleep, like usual, and so i decided to play jak & daxter once again.  i'm still not tired and it's already past 2 in the morning.  i don't know what to do.  i only came up here because they all came downstairs and told me i needed to go to bed.  nice of them to be concerned, i guess.  i said something about having insomnia and a guy that was visiting said that it's only insomnia if it is effecting your life in a negative way...and i said it was.  so the roommate that i've been "arguing" with said something about why it was effecting my life.  i asked why and he told me he didn't want to get into it.  i don't understand.  why is everybody so afraid to tell me anything?  yet another night of being kept in the dark and more confused....bring it on...

      BEING TWENTY-SOMETHING  They call it the "Quarter-life Crisis." It is when you stop going along with the crowd and start realizing that there are many things about yourself that you didn't know and may not like.  You start feeling insecure and wonder where you will be in a year or two, but then get scared because you barely know where you are now.  You start realizing that people are selfish and that, maybe, those friends that you thought you were so close to aren't exactly the greatest people you have ever met, and the people you have lost touch with are some of the most important ones.  What you don't recognize is that they are realizing that too, and aren't really cold, catty, mean or insincere, but that they are as confused as you.  You look at your job... and it is not even close to what you thought you would be doing, or maybe you are looking for a job and realizing that you are going to have to start at the bottom and that scares you.  Your opinions have gotten stronger. You see what others are doing and find yourself judging more than usual because suddenly you realize that you have certain boundaries in your life and are constantly adding things to your list of what is acceptable and what isn't.  One minute, you are insecure and then the next, secure.  You laugh and cry with the greatest force of your life. You feel alone and scared and confused.  Suddenly, change is the enemy and you try and cling on to the past with dear life, but soon realize that the past is drifting further and further away, and there is nothing to do but stay where you are or move forward.  You get your heart broken and wonder how someone you loved could do such damage to you. Or you lie in bed and wonder why you can't meet anyone decent enough that you want to get to know better.  Or maybe you love someone but love someone else too and cannot figure out why you are doing this, because you know that you aren't a bad person.  One night stands and random hook ups start to look cheap. Getting wasted and acting like an idiot starts to look pathetic.  You go through the same emotions and questions over and over, and talk with your friends about the same topics because you cannot seem to make a decision.  You worry about loans, money, the future and making a life for yourself... and while winning the race would be great, right now you'd just like to be a contender!  What you may not realize is that everyone reading this relates to it.  We are in our best of times and our worst of times, trying as hard as we can to figure this whole thing out.

      it's so cold in our house.  sure, the guys are pumped that they are saving so much on their gas bill by keeping the heat super low...but i just can't see how it's worth it.  i can't even leave my room it's so cold.  i had to buy myself a space heater...which does an okay job.  then they always say i'm hiding in my room...pouting and staying away from them...when really it's the heat issue.  silly rabbits.  i'm even shivering right now and i'm in my room but their "cold" air is pumping through the vents and my heater isn't heating it up fast enough.  gosh, i can't wait to move out so that i can have the temperature set in the comfort zone.  i've been thinking a lot about moving out and i'm getting more and more excited.  i'll be able to have plants and clean dishes all the time.  i'll be able to vacuum the floor because i'll actually invest in a vacuum.  and i'll get a puppy.  and have fish.  and everything will be clean and organized...i'll actually have space for all my stuff.  right now my room is a complete disaster and i don't even know where to start to clean it.  i just don't have enough space for everything so i can't put half of it away.  plus, i'm planning on moving closer to downtown...which means i'll be closer to places i want to go.  and that might lead to me meeting some new people, which i desperately need.  and i've been toying with the fact that the boys will never visit me and once i move out we won't keep in contact, and i hate to say it, but at times i realize that i can't force anybody to be my friend, and if they truly are my friends and want to stay friends, they will make some sort of effort...and if not, well, what's the point in having a one-sided friendship anyway?  i know one of the guys (the one with the new girl toy) really doesn't want me around...and wants me to leave before spring break even.  all i can say is that i guess he wasn't the person i thought he was, and i'm kind of sorry that we ever got to know each other better than we did before we moved here.  i've given up on trying to fix things between him and i.  as far as i'm concerned, it's up to him whether we remain friends or not...and if some girl is going to ruin our friendship, then i guess it's a friendship not worth keeping.  ugh, this is another long post.  and so far i haven't been writing in my blog how i think i should.  i just haven't really had any interesting things to talk about lately.  i could talk about how i've only spent $14 on groceries so far this month and i seriously don't have any food in the house...but am too lazy to go to the grocery store.  i wonder how long i can make the few pieces of food i have last...  okay, so that's not interesting either.  oh!  i went go-karting this weekend with one of the guys.  it was so much fun.  expensive, but fun.  the first time he lapped me twice, but the 2nd time i had got a go-kart that was a lot easier to steer and i trimmed my time by 10 seconds each lap!  i wish it wasn't so expensive, i'd go a lot more.  it was worth it though.  ummm...i also watched this creepy movie called "santa claus conquers the martians."  it was great...they made it look super old so they could just put NASA and US military footage in it and pretend like they filmed it.  the best part though was when there was a polar bear and it was blatently obvious that it was someone crawling around in a bear costume.  the back of the case even talked about what a horrible movie it was.  hehe...it was hilarious.  well...i guess i should bring this to a close.  after all, if i stay in one spot for too long, i might freeze to death ;)

      how come it's so hard for me to understand everybody else?  i used to be so good at reading people and thinking how they thought.  now i just read people completely wrong and i don't know why.  i'm really frustrated.  the person that i've shared the most with still doesn't understand me.  he's the first person i've actually tried super hard to communicate with and i just get shut out and argued with.  i don't understand.  i don't think i'm being irrational...i'm not mad or feeling bad...and i'm certainly not looking for someone to attach some meaning to why i'm supposedly feeling bad.  i simply wanted to talk about our friendship and try to clarify a few things so that our friendship doesn't get destroyed.  obviously he doesn't think there's a problem and doesn't want to try and have closure.  i give up.  i tried.  it's people like this that make me never want to share my feelings or thoughts with anyone again.  dammit, why am i so emotional lately?  this has been going on for almost a year now...there are times i can't even have a normal conversation without crying...even when it's not even involving anything that i would ever cry about.  maybe there's something wrong with me...like a tear-duct problem...do those exist?  i don't know.  i'm getting better...i think.  anyway, i've decided that i don't need to find anyone.  i'm perfectly fine being alone.  of course, if someone comes along, i won't ignore it.  the thing is that i'm independent.  i've always been independent, and guys don't like that.  what i really need is just a companion to go through life with.  someone i can talk with and go places with.  someone to keep company.  someone that cares about me.  someone who wants to spend time with me...

      sometimes i think i'm like a 5-year old...you know, the "why?" stage.  i'm constantly asking question after question without response.  nobody wants to answer my questions.  it just causes frustration.  both ways.  there are just so many unanswered questions.  i don't know why i need to find the answers.  i'm not sure what i'd do with them if i had them.  i don't know if they'd solve anything, or if they'd just lead to more questions.  i'm misunderstood.  maybe the problem is that i'm trying too hard to understand and be understood.  where do people like me go to find meaning?  i wish someone knew me.  anyway, here is just a sampling of what's on my mind....  +why are the questions that i ask people in order to understand something so difficult to answer? +why do the people i ask questions to get pissed off at me for asking questions? +why do things have to change? +why can't things go back to how they used to be? +why can't i take life as it comes? +why do guys confuse the hell out of me? +why are all my friendships disintegrating? +why doesn't anyone ever want to share their thoughts with me? +why does my heart feel so bad? +why do i feel so alone? +why am i so indecisive? +why is everybody so damn selfish? +why do guys cheat on me? +why doesn't anyone want to make a commitment to me? +why do i always fall for guys that i can't have? +why must i sleep? +why must i eat?

      should i move out or not?  maybe i'll give it a little while longer.  if this situation doesn't get better though, i have to get out.  i really don't need the verbal abuse and to be "looked down" at because i'm a girl...especially from my 3 closest friends.  if they really cared about me i think that they would treat me a little better.  tonight i told the boys that i was apartment searching.  i can't really tell if they care or not.  i don't think that even if they did care they would admit it.  i really don't want to leave, but i hate coming home happy and then within a half an hour of being around them feeling completely miserable.  i have a right to be happy, and no one should be able to ruin that for me.  i really hope the situation gets better...  okay...starting tomorrow i will start writing in my blog the way i want to be.  this isn't supposed to be a life story and drag on like this, so it will stop.  it's just so easy to write about my problems because that is what's on my mind.  plus, i'm lacking friends to talk to, so this blog is taking the place of a friend that would lend an ear.  it wouldn't bother me as much if i wasn't so damn boring and dry.  i apologize to anyone who reads any of this.  from now until then...

      I want to go see the  urlLink International Spy Museum !!  I've always wanted to be a spy but I'd be awful at it.  There's just something so appealing about having a phone hiding in the sole of your shoe...or having a lipstick pistol...or a pen camera!

      so, maybe i'm over-reacting a bit but isn't it a little soon to spend the night at some strange guys house the same night you meet him?  i guess maybe they just hit it off so well that they know they belong together?  i don't know.  maybe they are both just looking for a one-night stand?  i'm just so confused.  i only hope that i can't hear them messing around through my wall tonight.  what did feel good though is that i didn't feel like i wanted to be with him when i saw them together...not even the slightest bit...and i think that means a lot.  i think it proves that i am truly over him.  i've known that i was over him for a while, but you never really know if the feelings are still there until there is proof.  although it sort of disturbs me that all 3 of the guys are awstruck by her.  she's not even really that attractive, but i guess she is different.  she has a lip piercing and is kind of goth.  that's not why i don't think she's that attractive.  i just didn't really think she was all that pretty.  anyway, i think he said that she works at hot topic and she definitely fits the description of most hot topic employees.  she also has some kind of texan accent...and me and texas just don't get along (no offense to anyone from texas that might stumble upon this).  but i'm sure she has a great personality, which is what drew him to her in the first place.  i really can't make any conclusions about her since i don't really know her, and she did seem fairly friendly.  i just get a weird feeling about her...a gut feeling that something bad is going to happen.  what i think is the strangest thing though is that she is the girl from a dream that i had a few days after thanksgiving.  only in my dream she had long black hair...with red streaks.  but everything else is exactly her...no doubt about it.  it's really eerie.  anyway, i guess i should go to sleep.  my sister just showed me another  urlLink  pokey comic   to cheer me up.  you're lucky...2 pokey's in one day!

      if i ever happen to tell you this exists, and you read this, please know that i am really sorry about this whole physical aspect of our friendship getting out of control.  but, i also hope that you realize it’s not all my fault.  you were the initiator most of the time…not to mention that you were the one that kept insisting that there was nothing wrong with what we were doing.  so i don’t know why you’re taking it out on me, but regardless, i'm sorry.  moving on for good now, i slept so well last night.  i woke up with this incredible sense of peace.  i could definitely get into feeling this more often.  i'm really glad i got out of the house last night.  thanks matt!  we should definitely get together more often.

      i think that he’s worried that i still have feelings for him, which is probably why he won’t tell me anything about this “mystery girl” that he is meeting for the first time tomorrow…or today…whatever.  i don’t think he understands.  i wish he knew that i really don’t want to date him.  i feel bad saying it, but i honestly think that i can do better.  not that there’s anything wrong with him.  i've been over him for a while actually, even if there is a bit of flirting that still goes on back and forth.  the way i see it is that we have both been filling a temporary void and releasing built-up emotions.  i'm not attached...the physical aspect of our "relationship" means nothing to me.  and i know that it means nothing to him.  i've always been just another number, and i'd be perfectly fine if we never touched again.  don't get me wrong, i do love him...but no matter how strong that love truly is, it's not the same kind of love that holds 2 together.  i actually feel bad because i feel like i've been using him in a way.  but then again, it's not like he hasn't made me feel used at times either…  i realize now that he doesn't want me to touch him at all...not even a hug...because of his infatuation with this other girl he hasn't even met yet.  i'm completely okay with that, i just wish he'd tell me instead of being mean to me.  it kind of hurts.  sort of like rejection but not quite.  the part that hurts is that i feel like he doesn't trust me or consider me a good enough friend to know about this girl or to communicate about my actions directly with me.  i don’t even know why he considers me to be a friend if he can’t even communicate with me or share things with me.  if only he understood that the reason i'm jealous is because i'm afraid of losing his friendship, then maybe he would let me be part of his life.  i would try to explain it to him, except i don't think he'd ever believe me...  anyway, i wish him lots of luck with this thing tonight.  i hope she turns out to be the girl of his dreams.  he deserves to finally find happiness.  i just hope he’s careful, because infatuation is a dangerous thing, and the fact that they are both so “in love” with the idea of the other scares me.

      i am mad but i don't exactly know why.  i am sad but the reason remains hidden...from mine and everyone else's eyes.  i am jealous and i know exactly why.  even though it's not my place to feel that anymore...it's so hard to let go sometimes...even as just a friend.  you should know that i simply wanted to know how you think, who you are, what you believe, what you feel, what drives you, and most of all, i wanted to understand...i wish so much that i could make you see.  i want you to understand too.  i want you to know me.  why couldn't you let me in?  why couldn't i let you in?  i need answers, but the questions are ones that supposedly only i can answer.  it seems like such an easy question, "what did i do wrong?" but the answers never rise to the surface.  everyone is so damn afraid to hurt me that they keep me from the truth.  my universe is filled with lies...lies that others have told me...lies that i've told others...lies that i believe.  i don't even know who to trust anymore.  and here i'm left...alone...without any answers.  just this desire to change myself.  i'm not sure who i have become, and i'm not sure who i will become.  all i know is that i will never be the same.

      ...this insomnia has to go away sometime, right?  i miss chicago.  i miss the lights...and the feel of it at night.  i also miss montana.  the mountains are calling to me.  i feel like this city is suffocating me...i need to go back.  i will.  just as soon as i can save enough money and build up enough courage to get the hell out of here.  no one ever asks me about my childhood, and i really wish they would.  it's such a great tale.  i grew up in a world of imaginary unicorns and cardboard castles.  everything was vibrant and surrounded in beauty.  even in a place where our closest neighbors were several miles away and i didn't have any friends, i never felt alone.  if only i could go back in time - back to the times when i felt alive...  on another note, i'm sort of sad because i misplaced my dashboard confessional cd.  i'm listening to a burned copy of it right now.  it's the new cd.  i like it a lot.  it's actually gotten to a point where i can't even listen to the old cd's because i get so emotional.  i think this cd paints a more hopeful picture for me.  my "theme song" right now is actually off this cd.  i guess i'll end with the lyrics~        carve your heart out yourself.      hopelessness is your cell.      since you've drawn out these lines,      are you protected from trying times?       man it takes a silly girl      to lie about the dreams she has.      but lord, it takes a lonely one to wish      that she had never dreamt at all.       dig your ditch deep enough,      to keep you clear of the sun.      you've been burned more than once.      you don't think much of trust.       man it takes a silly girl      to lie about the dreams she has.      but lord, it takes a lonely one to wish      that she had never dreamt at all.       oh you're so sure      that i'll be leaving in the end,      you're treating me like i'm already gone.      but i'm not;      i will stay where you are, always

      wow.  today was the first really good day i've had in a while.  i accidentally fell asleep last night because i was so exhausted.  i think that since i've had insomnia for so long, my body finally just gave in and crashed.  the bad part is that i didn't set an alarm and woke up late.  thankfully i only got to work 5 minutes late and it wasn't a big deal.  anyway, today just went well (up until about 5pm).  actually, nothing special happened at all.  for some odd reason i just felt extremely happy, like how i used to feel.  i came home and went running...the first time for probably over a month.  it was incredible.  i ran the whole time, which is weird because i haven't run for such a long time and it usually takes me a while to get used to it again.  i really wanted to do something fun but i live with 3 guys whose idea of fun is getting drunk every night and playing video games.  well, at least they never want to do anything i want to do.  tonight we ended up renting movies, but they started being jerks so i'm not even sure i'm going to watch any of the movies with them.  i can't really blame one of them all that much considering he works via internet at night and can't go out unless there's internet access where we go.  another one has a girlfriend that takes up all his free time, which i guess is understandable.  and the third is just lazy and doesn't like doing things unless one of the other 2 are involved.  i guess i am just really lonely.  i don't know why i decided to move in with 3 guys...i should've known that they'd always end up leaving the girl out....and make fun of me every chance they got.  a lot of times they're just jerks.  i'm really frustrated.  i'm thinking about moving out.  this thought has been lingering in my mind ever since i moved in.  i'm staying here mainly out of convenience and because we're all such good friends...plus i feel safe here as opposed to how i'd feel living in an apartment alone.  however, maybe it's finally time to get out...

      i went to pick up one of my roommates downtown the other night and we ended up eating at old chicago.  i really like their salads...that whole almond thing is yummy.  anyway, even though i had 80 4-page tests to grade, we stayed there until a little past 11 playing pool and talking.  it was really fun.  we agreed that we really should hang out alone more often.  he told me this really elaborate story about his childhood...which was very interesting.  we also talked quite a bit about this girl he met online that he really likes.  i'm really happy for him...the only thing is that i'm starting to get extremely worried.  i'm jealous of this girl and i feel really selfish.  i'm worried that she's going to take him away from me.  already he's changed, and he hasn't even met her.  i'm not the best at putting my feelings into words.  i really wish i was a poet.  or that i could write song lyrics.  that would be even better.  music is so amazing.  unfortunately, i can't do either and the best way i can describe my life is that right now it feels sort of stagnate and lonely.  the worst part is that i'm struggling because i have no idea how to change it.

      i hate sleep...i have no good dreams, so whats the use?  nothing... it's just a waste of time.  i've had insomnia for a good 2 weeks now.  i blame it on my job and one of my roommates.   "lids down, i count sheep i count heartbeats the only thing that counts is that i won't sleep i countdown, i look around  who needs sleep? well you're never gonna get it who needs sleep? tell me what's that for who needs sleep? be happy with what you're getting"

      so...after 2 long years of thinking about making a blog and a few short-lived attempts...here i am. i've decided that i'm going to let this one ride for a while. i figure that i just need to start slowly. the thing is, i'm not sure i'm ready to share my thoughts with the world. i think the world is too harsh for a dreamer like me. i don't feel like i'm understood, which is probably the best reason to have a blog. i'm not going to let anyone know about this. for a while at least. i think that right now i'd rather have strangers read my thoughts...so here goes nothing...

      so i'm almost completely moved out of the other place.  i just have some clothes left, some dishes that the boys have been using and have to wash, my bikes, my car wash stuff, and i still need to clean up the pumpkins in the front yard.  shea was acting weird yesterday.  i went there, took a shower and laid down in my old room for a while because i was extremely tired.  a little while later i heard shea's door open and he peeked his head out to look in my room and once he saw i was there he went back in his room.  anyway, since i knew he was up i went over and knocked on his door to see if he wanted to get some lunch...he said sure and then mumbled something i couldn't understand while he went back in his room.  i started packing up my room and noticed that the stuff i had put aside because they belonged to the boys was gone.  so i decided that one of two things must have happened - i either accidentally packed them or while i was over here last night someone must've gone in my room and taken them.  i asked shea if he had seen them and he said that he hadn't.  so i figured i must've packed them.  we finally went to lunch, my treat (although he didn't even thank me), but the whole time we were there he never once looked straight at me.  he never made eye contact but the worst part is the fact that he never even looked towards me.  it was really disheartening.  i guess he must still be mad at me and is just pretending to not be.  i don't know.  anyway, he agreed to come over and see my place when i brought a load over but then right before we were going to go he decided he would go later.  i don't think he ever had any intention to go.  i don't know why he can't just tell me that in the first place if that's the case.  well, i brought a load over, looked through a few boxes that i thought the guys stuff might be in and i couldn't find them.  i finished packing up my stuff and amber came over with her van to help me move everything.  i found shea's blanket that i had been using because it was so cold in the house and i brought it into shea's room and there on his floor was the stuff that had been in my room that he said he hadn't seen and all my missing dishes.  i don't understand why he has to lie about everything.  he could have just said that he saw the stuff in my room and decided to take them so i didn't accidentally pack them.  and the dishes...why pretend he didn't have them?  was it so that they could keep them?  that seems silly to me because they weren't great or anything.  so i went downstairs and told him that i put his blanket in his room and saw my dishes so i took them and that the stuff was on his floor so i didn't accidentally pack them.  he just looked at me like he wanted to kill me for going in his room.  i don't understand.  it's not like i went in his room and took stuff that wasn't mine...or went through stuff of his...or really invaded his privacy.  he seriously has a problem.  i'm still missing my hat and i know he was wearing it 3 nights ago and mike saw it downstairs the night before last but yet it wasn't downstairs and shea pretended like he didn't know there was ever a hat even though he wore it all the time.  i'm sure he has it.  i just hope he decides to give it back before monday because i have to chaperone monday night skiing and i need a hat.  it's sort of frustrating.  i also cleaned out the pantry and took all of the stuff that was mine.  it looked pretty empty when i got done but i honestly didn't take anything that wasn't mine.  there were a lot of spices because i had bought spices to make my quacamole when we first moved in and that was before my parents brought all my stuff up.  when they brought everything, i ended up having duplicates of all the spices because they had been packed with my kitchen stuff.  i even left them some of my duplicate spices, just to be nice.  i also had a lot of stuff in there that took up a lot of room...like my granola, granola bars, cereal, canned fruits & veggies, etc.  anyway, shea came into the kitchen and went "where's all our stuff?" and i said "well, i took everything that was mine" and he replied, "who would've thought that all of that was yours."  he said it in a way that insinuated that i took stuff that wasn't mine, which is ridiculous.  then i said that i didn't take anything of theirs and if he wanted to look through my box of stuff and check that he was more than welcome to and he replied, "you can take whatever you want."  and then i said that my goal wasn't to take stuff that was theirs and he said something about how i can take whatever i think is mine and it doesn't matter if i think stuff of theirs is mine.  he's paranoid or something.  i'm not out to get them or anything, but i think he's the only one that thinks that i am.  *sigh*  well, i guess i should start unpacking or something...and get over to the guys house sometime....so i'm off...

      wow...it's already friday.  i don't know where this week has gone.  i'm excited though...i'm currently typing this in my new room in my new apartment.  i just moved in today.  i'm still a little too excited to sleep.  our place is so cool.  it's like it was meant to be too.  everything that i don't have amber has and everything she doesn't have, i have.  all of our dishes match.  all of furnishings match the apartment walls.  it's perfect.  my room is huge.  i have the treadmill in my room just because i have so much space.  i'm taking tomorrow off of work so i can finish packing/moving/unpacking.  i wonder if the boys started celebrating tonight or if they are waiting until all of my stuff is out of the house.  amber's family is sooo incredibly nice...so is drew's.  drew's family brought us a bottle of wine for a homewarming present.  they are also planning on getting us some plants, which is awesome.  i might get to housesit/petsit for drew's family over spring break, so that would be really neat.  i think i'm really going to love living here.  it was so good hanging out with people tonight.  it's definitely the start of a new life for me...a much better one...and i'm so happy.  hehe...this is such a random post...i think it's obvious i'm excited as my brain is jumping from one thing to the next so fast.  oh, this is wonderful.  i love when all of a sudden your life seems to have purpose and meaning and excitement and everything seems to go how it should.  one of the best parts of my week has been working with one of my students, eugene.  we just got new classes this week because the semester changed.  anyway, eugene is deaf and has an interpretor.  at first i was really nervous about it but it's turned out to be such a great experience.  both the interpretor and eugene LOVE my class and it really feels like i've improved so much as a teacher from last semester.  the best part is that i think almost all of my students really like me and think i'm doing a good job.  like i said, everything seems to be going my way now...all except for my friendships with the boys but the way i see it is that i've done all i can do and if it's meant to be, we'll be friends again, and if not, well we won't.  yep...well i don't really want to go to bed, or rather i can't sleep because i'm so excited so i think i'm going to unpack some more.  i'll keep writing more regularly again now that i'm all settled in my new place!  hooray!!!  :)

      i have sarah mclachlan's single (fallen) in my head right now.  it really seems to cry out everything i'm feeling right now.  i feel like i have fallen with nowhere left to turn and all of the people i thought were friends have decided i'm not worth having around.  the worst part is that there isn't anything i can do to redeem myself.  i wonder how long the boys will stay mad at me.  i wonder if they will ever forgive me.  i won't let myself hold a grudge against them and i hope that they find it in their hearts to look past all the bad things that have happened and forgive me.  i wish i could take back everything...go back in time and change the outcome of things.  i would do so many things differently.  i really didn't want to leave with things like this.  i wanted things to be fixed before i left.  time is running out.  i'm afraid of what's to come...

      well, i'm still extremely sick and all.  my nyquil has run out though and i can't take more or i won't wake up for one last breakfast with the boys so i've decided to stay up and work on a few things.  i've been sleeping constantly the past few days...i'm really confused as to what day it is too.  i thought yesterday was sunday but thank goodness that wasn't true.  it really sucks being sick and trying to get ready to move, not to mention finish up grading finals and grades for last semester and prepare for new classes coming tomorrow.  it's been quite hectic...i don't think i could have picked a more hectic week to move.  so here's the game plan:  wednesday we go and fill out paperwork & get our keys, thursday i move all my big stuff from the house with the uhaul amber's family is renting, friday i'm taking off of work and hopefully going to be able to move most of my other stuff during the day, saturday & sunday will be left to finish moving stuff and to unpack.  then it's off to school again on monday and monday night skiing.  i don't think i finished talking about my new place.  it's really cool.  the walls are all painted really neat designer colors...very trading spaces.  the living room and hallway to my room are a sage green.  my room and the kitchen are a mocha brown.  amber's room and the bathroom are a goldenrod color.  all have white trim and fantastic wood floors.  there are french doors in the living room that open up to a small balcony.   the building is a u-shape and has a courtyard garden in the middle.  it's a very nice brick building.  the gay couple who own it are remodeling it to look vintage and designeresque...hence all the bold colors.  what else?  hmm...well the only real crappy part is that the kitchen is extremely tiny and the kitchen sink is a joke.  it does have a gas stove though, so that's nice.  there is also a cute little breakfast booth built in.  i'm so incredibly excited to move in.  not quite so excited to actually do the moving part however.  oh yeah, we're also right by all the mansions on summit ave. and close to grand ave.  we're right off of snelling too so we have all those businesses to go to also.  it's just a great area.  tons of coffeeshops nearby, a bruegger's bagels, trendy little stores, hair salons, bookstores, etc.  plus, we're right on the busline too so we can get downtown super easily.  being right by st. thomas and macalaster college also means that there is a younger crowd so we'll fit in a lot better.  ah, finally, a new life...soon...just 3 more days...

      i am so sick.  i woke up this morning at 5am and i haven't been able to get back to sleep since.  i don't have much of a voice, which should prove interesting for class today.  good thing all my classes are just taking their finals.  i have come to the conclusion that i will miss these classes and i wish i would have had them for a few more days so that i could have made them brownies or something.  i wanted to do something for my wonderful ta's too but i haven't had the time.  i'll miss them.  next weekend will be hectic...moving into the new place and everything.  i'm so excited for that.  i'm excited to start a new life.  i'm looking forward to not being depressed anymore and to be around people that actually like my company and want to talk to me.  it's really sad that things fell apart so badly here.  i think an important thing that i've realized recently is that there isn't anything wrong with me.  if the guys i live with can't see the beauty that i hold, that is their problem, and as i see it, their loss.  so i've been a little emotional at times but who isn't.  and maybe i've been overly emotional, but they put me through a lot and were part of the reason i became so depressed.  maybe i was bitchy at times, but it's not like they were never mean to me, which is what usually sparked my "bitchiness."  maybe i wanted to hang out with them too much and they got annoyed, but if they can't see it's because i saw them as my closest friends, then that's heartbreaking.  i'm actually starting to cry a little...which hasn't happened for a good month.  i know i'm going to miss their friendships.  i can't pretend that i'm not.  however, i also know that i'm going to have a much better life not living here and it's what we all need.  i pray to God that eventually they will realize that i meant something to them and want me in their lives.  until then, i guess i'll have to let it go.  in my mind, i think it will be a sad goodbye...but part of me insists there won't be a goodbye and as i walk out the door for the last time they won't even budge from their seats in front of the tv.  i guess we'll see...the time is approaching rapidly...  so to continue with my exploration of self-worth.  i have thought a lot about my life lately, and it's really not all that bad.  it's bad at times because i focus on the bad.  truth is, i have a great job (even if it is a bit stressful at times) and i do have a lot of friends that do care about me.  i am beautiful, both on the outside and the inside.  i'm a truly compassionate person and care so much about everyone else.  i'm going somewhere.  i feel like my life has meaning and i'm starting to feel complete.  it's actually a really good feeling to have right now.  i am SO full of hope...

      well, i have great news!  the reason i haven't posted in a few days is because on monday i found out amber got her job.  monday night we looked at a few apartments.  tuesday we handed in some applications and got an apartment.  i'm really excited.  we got the apartment we wanted and it's extremely cute.  a little on the small side but that's part of what makes it cute.  we had actually looked at a huge one but decided that we'd rather have a place with personality.  we're going to be living right by all of the mansions on summit ave. and close to all the trendy places on grand ave.  i'm so excited.  the best part is that i'm not going to be living with these silly boys anymore.  i hope we keep in touch though, which i'm unsure of what their plans are as far as that goes.  i've been getting the vibe that as soon as i'm out that they are cutting all ties with me.  i think that would be pretty immature of them.  anyway, my clock is extremely off and i'm not sure what time it is but either way, i really should be getting ready for work so i'll post later tonight and provide details of my new maison.  :)

      so i ended up going to cracker barrel alone.  a little bit after getting there, i noticed that kurt & shea were there.  i said hi and they pretty much ignored me and pretended i wasn't there.  kurt barely looked at me, however, he did talk to me briefly.  i don't know.  maybe they were afraid that i wanted to join them...which is silly because i know that if they had wanted me to join them, they would have asked me to go in the first place.  i just think it's pretty immature.  they must really not like me anymore.  i guess i was mistaken.

      weekends seem to go by so fast...even when i'm not doing anything.  i spent most of yesterday doing stuff with my computer (installing new stuff and upgrading) and calling about apartments.  so far we haven't had much luck on the apartment search.  it's actually quite difficult to find 2 bedroom apartments.  i don't have school tomorrow...yay!  however, we do have staff development so i do have to get up early and go to the school.  i've realized that i am going to miss my classes that i have now.  as much trouble as they've given me, there are so many really nice students that seem to really care about me and like having me.  i've heard so many times this semester that this is the first time some of my students have gotten A's in math...and it's not because my class is easy.  it's actually quite hard and all of my A students have really had to work to earn it.  they are taking their finals on thursday.  i hope they do well.  i am doing so much better than i was doing a month or two ago.  however, my room is very much not feeling like my room anymore.  i've packed up almost all of my things minus the clothes and my computer.  there aren't any pictures around...nothing that brings about good memories...although nothing that brings about bad memories either.  i've been sleeping decent lately, for the most part.  i've been having less trouble falling asleep but it's been restless sleep and i've been waking up several times a night finding it hard to go back to sleep.  i've been having some pretty weird dreams too.  i'll have a dream and it will be followed by another that doesn't have anything to do with the one before it but somehow my brain connects them.  there are always strings of about 6 dreams intertwined like this.  it's really bizarre.  anyway, it's sunday morning.  the day i usually go to cracker barrel with the boys, or at least kurt.  he didn't get home until really late last night though so i don't think he's going to want to go.  i asked shea but i'm guessing he won't want to go for fear of me talking to him or something...heaven forbid.  maybe i'll just go by myself.  i also want to go see big fish, so maybe i'll go do that too.  we'll see i guess.

      okay, so i lied.  i really don't hate shea.  and i don't hate either of the other boys.  and i do consider them to be my friends.  and the truth is that i love them...and that they are my closest friends.  i don't want them out of my life, and i want to be in theirs.  i just get so frustrated sometimes that i say things i don't really mean.  doesn't everyone though?

      so i went downstairs tonight to see if there was anything of mine still down there and i noticed a pile of cd's.  suspicious that they were mine, i looked, and indeed they were.  while i've been at work, i guess shea has been taking my cd's and burning all of them without asking me.  i'm kind of upset about it.  one, he didn't ask me if he could borrow them and burn them.  two, i'm protective of my music.  i feel like i really understand and relate to all of my music and it makes me mad when people act like they can relate to it when they've never experienced what the songs are about.  not saying that he doesn't, but to share my music with someone, i have to feel like i can trust them, in a way...if that makes sense.  he's not even talking to me...this is just another way he's using me before i leave.  i'm sick of being used.

      wow...i've been so busy the past few days.  monday night i went skiing for the first time in a long time and it was so much fun.  i was chaperoning for the "monday night ski program" so i went there with a bus full of 8th graders, which was interesting in itself.  i've decided that middle schoolers want you to know everything about them...they are so open.  anyway, didn't get home until super late that night, especially since one of the kids got injured right before everyone was supposed to get on the bus.  anyway, tuesday i went driving around with 2 of my friends (one of them being the girl i'm most likely going to get an apartment with, and the other was her boyfriend) in st. paul looking for apartment phone numbers.  that was fun.  i'm starting to get really excited about the idea of moving out.  we have a whole page of numbers to start calling but we won't know if she gets the job until tomorrow or saturday.  i hope she does.  i desperately need to get out.  i had another argument with shea about the cat on monday.  i ended up telling him that i hate him and that he is an asshole.  the sad part is that i meant every word.  i don't consider him to be my friend anymore.  friends don't treat friends the way he treats me.  plus, all of these personal attacks are getting old.  and it's not just this cat thing...he's been treating me horribly ever since he met that girl, and i don't understand why that changed how he treats me.  maybe she didn't like me or something...or maybe it's because he knew i wasn't all that fond of her.  i don't know.  i think it's wrong to just ditch your old friends when someone new comes along, but he's certainly not me and i definitely can't expect anyone to believe the same things i do.  anyway, i apologized to him today but he wouldn't even acknowledge my presence so i don't think it meant much.  i really am sorry for fighting with him and being selfish about the cat situation.  after all, it is their house and why should i expect them to put my health & comfort above their pleasure & happiness?  i know it sounds like i'm being sarcastic but i'm not, honestly.  part of me wants him to forgive me and for us to be great friends again.  i know that's most likely not going to happen, while at the same time i'm not sure i want to be his friend anymore.  *sigh*  guess it's out of my hands now and i'll take things as they come.  it's his decision whether he wants to forgive me and consider me a friend or not...

      i think one of the worst things someone can do to you is physically shove you away when all you want is a hug, for them to hear the one thing you want to tell them, and for them to tell you that everything is okay.  i guess everything isn't okay, and i'm not sure it ever will be again.  i think it's possible that shea truly hates me, and i'm not sure what i did to him to make him feel this way toward me.  i really really really want to understand what i did wrong because right now i'm completely confused.  i regret everything i've shared with him.  i really do.  i wish i could take it all back.  i confronted him today about the girl's cat that has apparently moved in with us.  if i wasn't allergic to cats this wouldn't be a problem at all.  however, i am and he gave me no warning that it was coming.  so, i told him that i thought it was very inconsiderate of him to get a cat and let it have full roam of the house when he knows that i'm allergic.  i understand that it's his house and he has every right to own a cat, but at the same time, i am paying rent and i shouldn't have to be confined to my room whenever i'm at home.  i simply asked him if he could consider keeping it out of the basement since that's where i spend the most time when i'm at home.  he seemed very angry with me for bringing this up.  he asked when i was planning on moving out and i told him that i didn't know but at the moment i probably couldn't move out until the summer.  then i made a comment like "unless you ask me to move out sooner" and asked "do you want me here?"  he told me he wasn't going to answer that and get trapped.  i'm not sure what that's supposed to mean.  i take it as he doesn't want me here but he doesn't want to be the one to say it or have it be used against him in some way later.  i wish he would just be honest with me.  mike is indifferent and kurt probably doesn't want me here but at the same time probably doesn't care all that much either way.   i know i won't hear from them once i move out.  i'm almost certain of it.  of course, i'll probably run into them occasionally at a party or something but they'll probably avoid me or something.  i hope they know how much that'll hurt.

      i received a phone call tonight from my friend's girlfriend.  turns out she's interviewing for a job in the cities and wants to get an apartment and was wondering if i would be interested in finding one with her.  this is just what i needed.  i hope she gets the job.  it will be A LOT easier for me to convince myself to move out if there's someone else involved.  it's hard to motivate myself to find a new place because i'm scared of so many things.  plus, i really like her...and i wish i hung out more with her boyfriend (one of my good friends from college) because it seems like i never see him anymore.  i'd be living with a girl too...not to mention a normal one.  it would be so much fun.  i hope this all works out.  i've managed to convince myself that the boys don't deserve to have me as a friend.  i'm too nice and they take advantage of me.  i do so many things for them and the only thing i get in return is to be treated like crap.  it seems to me like i want their friendship a lot more than they want mine...so i guess it's time to start letting go.  they have already started to treat me like this stef girl they used to be friends with but cut off ties with...they don't answer the phone when i call (or just send me to the voicemail), talk badly about me, ignore me, act like i'm incredibly stupid, etc.  maybe it's for the best if we're not friends.  obviously we don't have enough in common or something.  i'm crying about this now.  i'm forever going to regret moving in here...for what it's done to me...for the friendships i won't have when i move out...for the horrible imprints i've left on the boys...for losing everything.  why didn't i listen to everybody when they told me not to do this?  just another tragic mistake made by yours truly....

      so that girl did end up coming over tonight but brought one of her guy friends with.  his name was dave (great name...my life seems to not be able to get away from people named dave...a lot of times i think i'm destined to end up with a dave).  anyway, while her and my housemate were off romping around, dave and i had a really great conversation.  the first real conversation i've had in a long time.  it seemed like we had quite a bit in common so the conversation just flowed.  at times it was a little awkward because he kept talking about his last relationship and what went wrong, but i could definitely relate to the situation and i know how nice it is to find someone who will listen so i didn't mind hearing about it the slightest bit.  he seemed really nice.  it almost made me like the girl better, but not quite.  he reminded me of the dave i was friends with last year...both punk, both had mohawks, both intelligent, same good conversation, etc.  i hope he visits again...it was fun.

      i've been feeling nostalgic the past few days.  i miss people...even bad people that have hurt me.  in particular, i miss my ex that cheated on me with my roommate.  i thought that he'd be one of the last people i'd ever want to see again during my lifetime but i've been reminiscing about all of the good times we had.  he used to love doing things i liked to do...bowling...hiking...camping...cooking...etc.  his family was also so similar to mine and he is the only person i know that could relate to what i went through growing up.  he was also a really good kisser, and i sort of miss that as silly as that sounds.  i remember arizona...and mount lemon where we went hiking and he picked all of those wildflowers for me...we reached the top and because of the elevation we were both having trouble catching our breath but we managed to climb on top of a boulder where we sat overlooking the city and he kissed me.  it was so beautiful.  i also remember stalking the javelina by his apartment and staring up at the starry sky while we talked about our childhoods.  i remember watching the wedding singer...once and then again in french with spanish subtitles...only the second time we didn't catch much of the movie.  i haven't been able to watch that movie again.  he always made me feel so attractive too and i felt like he really wanted me.  we both had so much passion.  i remember going to perkins a few weeks after we had broken up where we just talked for a long time and he apologized for everything and told me how much i meant to him and how he was forever going to regret ever telling me that he had cheated on me since i wasn't able to forgive him and he lost me.  we both cried.  we got back to olaf, sat in his car, and just like 2 high schoolers we made out in the parking lot in the freezing cold then walked back up the hill holding hands.  only we both knew it was a mistake and didn't end up getting back together...instead he kept sleeping with my roommate.  i will never forgive her.  i don't know why i feel like i can forgive him...and why part of me really wishes that we were still friends...especially since he hurt me so much.  he has permanently scarred me and i know i can't really forgive him...i still miss him at times though.  actually, i'm not completely sure i really miss him or i miss what we had...  i miss dave too.  dave and i had so many great conversations...it felt so right.  it's really too bad we never dated because i think we would have been excellent together.  but no, he had to end up being a bastard too.  he emailed me a few weeks ago and one of my housemates talked me out of replying.  now i wonder if i should've emailed him.  i think he's the only person that i've felt incredibly comfortable with and who understood me.  we really did have the best conversations...i miss those days at the coffeeshops...and going on walks...  ah, and ned.  my vegetarian punk buddy that i met on my trip to hawaii.  we had become so close.  we would have been good together too.  even if we never ended up dating we had potential to be best friends, but then he graduated and i only saw him once during the next year because he moved back to wisconsin.  i should try emailing him...i think he's in the cities again now.  i also miss one of my old high school friends that i haven't talked to since summer between my sophomore & junior year of college.  he kept ditching me to hang out with his new girlfriend and didn't set aside even one time during the summer to see me...so i stopped trying.  he im'd me new year's eve (although i wasn't around) and told me that he wished for things now forgotten to be forgiven.  i wonder what he's doing now.  time has changed so many people, myself included.  i hope time has been kinder to him than it has been for me.

      i'm so bored.  there's nothing to do around this house.  of course i could do helpful things like clean the bathrooms or the kitchen or something but i'm not really in a cleaning mood.  i could also clean up my room since it's a disaster, but i also don't feel much like doing that.  i want to do something fun...like playing a game or going out to play pool or go bowling.  i wish i had someone around here to do things with.  i need a friend with common interests.  the guys are just into magic and d&d...which are both things that i have no desire to be involved in.  occasionally they play games with me but it's a very rare occasion.  the past few days i've just been playing yahoo games online.  avalanche is a fun game.  doot do doo...  i wonder what the circus world museum is like.  every time i go back to illinois i pass the exit for it.  i think it would scare me since i have this whole fear of clowns and everything.  it has always intriqued me though.  oh, btw, i am attracted to "shiny things."  i'm a sucker for things like that.  i went to the store and needed to buy toothpaste.  that new aquafresh toothpaste in the pretty blue and yellow container caught my attention and drew me away from my usual toothpaste...unfortunately it tasted like crap, they got my money, and i have almost a full tube of toothpaste i will never use again.  my housemate is wearing a hat again.  that girl must be coming over...yay.  i know i'm not the best judge of character but i think i'm much better at picking out evil girls than i am at picking out evil guys.  there's just something very bad about her and i can't put my finger on what it is.  no one seems to agree with me and they just play it off as me being jealous.  whatever...maybe they will all change their tune when something bad happens.  she actually reminds me of my evil ex-roommate.  this housemate of mine also dated her though and claims that to be his most successful relationship...so maybe he wants to be with someone evil.  i'm beginning to like my other housemate's girlfriend more.  she actually says hi to me when she comes over and talks to me.  they've also been spending more time with the whole household lately, so i think that's good.  maybe they are right for each other...they do appear to make each other happy and i think that's really important.  it's hard for me to picture them married, but that won't be for a little while more at least.  they do look cute together...both short redheads.  anyway...enough about all of this love crap.  i'll end with a quote from my sister, "love makes people crazy and i am already crazy enough."

      my first day back to school after break wasn't nearly as bad as i imagined it to be.  it was actually one of my better days and it reminded me of why i like teaching.  i really do like teaching.  it's not a simple job though and it's easy to get frustrated by it.  i was pumped to go skiing after school as a chaperone but they cancelled it because of the temperature.  it's probably better though since i'm starting to feel pretty exhausted already and i haven't done anything since i've come home from work.  i should definitely start getting up early in the morning to exercise before i go to work...that way i'd feel more energized all day.  i'm happy...the colleague that i celebrated new year's eve with talked to me today about hanging out with them more often.  i can't wait.  i think it's great for me to get away from this house and hang out with "normal" people.  it also doesn't hurt that they actually want my company.  i don't know what's wrong with my housemates.  maybe it's just me but they seem even more mean towards me than usual.  it all really depends on the one that has the new girl toy.  in my opinion, he has changed drastically in the past month.  it appears to me that he is trying to act like who he thinks she wants...and trying to be more like her so that she'll like him more or something.  he swears A LOT more and is ruder and makes stupid comments.  he also wears hats around the house like she does, although not nearly to the extent that she does.  i've never seen her without a hat on...and i'm not sure i could be convinced that he has either.  i hope she is impressed with his new behavior, because i'm certainly not.  frankly, i just find it annoying.  anyway, the reason why i say it all depends on him is because one of the other housemates treats me at about the same level that he does, so when he's nice, he's nice to me too and when he's a complete asshole, he's just as much of an asshole.  it's like they feed off of one another and all gang up against me.  whatever...things aren't ever going to change...at least not until they mature a little and realize that they really are jerks...and i'm sure this won't happen while i'm around.  one of them had complained before about not having any friends that were girls besides me, and i think it's funny because i don't think he recognizes that unless he's dating someone or trying to get some action, he treats girls like crap and i don't know of many girls that would tolerate it.  i've been stupid to put up with it for this long.  i wonder if he realizes that he's losing another one...and i'm not sure that this can be saved.  i hope one day they look back at these times and wish they had treated me better...hopefully it won't be before i'm long gone.  so, right now i'm sitting around not doing much of anything.  there's ddr music in the background.  we have company...3 guys...none of which the guys introduced me to.  one of them introduced himself to me but i only know who the other 2 are because of name references during conversations.  that's pretty nice of them.  maybe they just want to pretend i'm not here...or better yet, maybe i'm invisible and fully unaware of it.  3 of them are currently off attempting to find a liquor store open this late at night...i think they were heading to wisconsin to try their luck there.  it would probably be a fun drive.  i like driving...to a certain extent.  i'm not really fond of driving around other people because i tend to get pissed off at all of the people that don't know how to drive and shouldn't be on the road.  however, i find driving very relaxing in most cases.  i like getting myself lost (on purpose) and then trying to find my way home (without any guidance).  i especially like scenic drives.  i'm really rambling on here.  i have nothing interesting to say but i also have nothing else to do...and it's not like anyone is ever really going to read this.  one thing i've been thinking about today is that i haven't ignored anyone for a long time.  i think i'm getting better at that.  i don't know if it's because it's gotten to the point where i just don't care enough to get that angry or if i'm dealing with my hurt and anger in better ways or if i've somehow grown out of that.  it makes sense to me that it was just a phase because the first time i started doing it was when i was living with the person who my boyfriend at the time cheated on me with.  obviously, we weren't on speaking terms and both did an excellent job of ignoring the other.  ever since then it has snuck it's way into most of my friendships at one time or another.  i've really become quite a bitter person.  i don't know why i hold so many grudges.  before i got hurt so many times, i was actually quite nice, forgiving, accepting of everyone, trusting of everyone, fun, and laid back.  it hurts that nobody seems to remember the old me...well at least no one that hasn't been a victim of my recent antics and have changed their opinion of me.  i lost so many friendships during the last 2 years of college...and i think part of that is because i realized that i can only trust myself and i'm the only person that's going to look out for me.  it's really hard for me to believe that there is anyone out there (besides my immediate family) that truly cares about me.  as a result it's been increasingly more difficult to justify keeping some of the so-called friendships i've had.  maybe i think i deserve something that i don't.  maybe i expect to be treated better than i should.  i don't know.  i keep saying that i'm not myself, which is true in my eyes.  i'm not at all the person i used to be, and i don't approve of the person that i've become.  i don't feel at all how i envision my true self to be.  part of me really wants to go back to how i used to be, but at the same time i think that it would be dangerous for me to do so, not to mention, near impossible.  by dangerous i mean that i recognize that i was incredibly naive, too trusting, too innocent, and didn't know all i know now.  by near impossible i mean that there's no way that i can go back knowing what i know and because i've been hurt so badly too many times.  it's just frustrating because i want to change and i try to change but everytime i think i'm making progress, i feel like i am pushed back by the people around me and the things that happen in my life.  i wish that karma would find it's way to me one of these days for all the good things i have done.  even though i know that nobody said life was going to be fair, i just don't understand why so many bad people have so many good things happen to them.  it almost makes me want to be bad so that something good happens to me.  okay, now i just sound ungrateful.  i know good things happen to me, they just don't seem as important as the good things that happen to others...you know...the grass is always greener on the other side.

      so last night i was taking some of those silly emode quizzes because i had nothing better to do and some of them are pretty darn amusing.  i took one quiz about why i was still single and one of the questions was something along the lines of "how did your last relationship end?"  i didn't know which answer to choose.  i kind of joked with the person sitting next to me and he was like "don't know which ones actually counted as relationships, hmm?"  i really didn't.  of the 4 people i've kissed, i think i can absolutely say that i didn't actually date one of them and that i dated 2 of them.  the other one, the last person i was intimate with and also one of the guys i'm living in the house with at the moment is kind of iffy.  he overheard the other guy and i talking and he said "i know what would be considered a relationship" but then didn't continue.  i wonder what he was going to say.  i wonder if in his opinion we had ever been in a relationship.  it doesn't matter much i guess, and it's not like i will ever find out.  i think someone should really give me a list of definitions for love terms since i really have no idea what the difference is between "dating" and being "boyfriend/girlfriend" and "going steady" and being in a "relationship" etc.  of course, i have my own definitions but i think they are warped and don't fit with what other people consider these things to be.  so i ended up not considering my last "fling" a relationship, and instead went with the person i had dated the longest and who had cheated on me with my roommate at the time.  needless to say that the results of the test came back as "you're still single because you're afraid to get hurt."  i think that's pretty accurate either way.  at the moment i'm happy being single, regardless of what everyone else thinks.  i've been kind of in the mindset that i don't ever want to date anyone again and that i'd be perfectly content being single the rest of my life.  that doesn't necessarily mean that i won't go out on a few dates with someone but my desire to be in a "relationship" (meaning dating someone seriously...perhaps being of boyfriend/girlfriend status) has dropped dramatically.  i think this is one of the reasons why i went completely against my belief that "friends with benefits" is wrong and messed around with my housemate for as long as i did...everything has lost meaning...i don't feel much these days.  i just don't understand.  i don't understand what 2 people are supposed to do with each other all of the time...and how they don't run out of conversation or get sick of the other's company or bored because they have nothing to do.  i'm really confused about the whole communication aspect i guess.  i haven't ever been in a successful relationship and all of the people i've dated have been as good at communicating as i am (which isn't good at all).  i wonder what it's like to actually be in love with someone.  i wonder how it feels.  i mean, i love certain people but i'm not "in love" with them.  i have never been in love with someone, and no one has ever been in love with me.  i'm not convinced that pure love truly exists.  none of my "relationships" have ever been defined and my mind is boggled by how this actually occurs.  every time i've tried to bring it up, the question is either reflected back on me without an answer from them, or given some kind of ambiguous answer that doesn't really give a real answer.  maybe i just date assholes that are only looking for someone to mess around with.  it's hard because i treat "relationships" like a lot of guys...i am afraid of committing, i won't be the first to say "i love you," i try not to get too attached, and i really like the physical aspects of dating someone.  it's sort of frustrating, partly because i sort of expect the guy to make the first move.  am i really that girl that no one can ever see themselves with in the future?  and why is that?  i'm attractive...smart...nice...have a bright future in front of me...creative...love animals...down to earth...of course, i'm far from perfect but who isn't?  i guess there are quite a few turn-offs...like that i'm vegetarian...i'm shy...i'm emotional at times...i'm indecisive...i'm independent...oh, and i suppose all of those traits that i have that are similar to how guys treat relationships doesn't help...  it is just so frustrating to look at other people in relationships.  most of the time, i'm completely baffled as to why someone is dating the other person.  oftentimes, the question arises, "if they can get a boyfriend, then i should definitely be able to find one."  i know that sounds a little conceited...okay, maybe very conceited...but i honestly don't think that i'm a bad catch.  i went from being the girl that everyone wanted to date but never got to because she turned down everyone that asked her out to the girl that no one wants.  i just don't understand and i think i've finally given up..."i'm sick and tired of this goddamn love crap...i'm sick and tired of this alligator love trap."

      i feel like people are keeping secrets from me.  people talk badly about me behind my back.  someone doesn't trust me.  people assume i'm doing things that i'm not.  it's cloudy out.  i believe and trust someone who has only told me lies.  someone leads me on.  i get bored with all of my music.  people make me feel like crap.  i get in a fight with my parents.  people only remember the bad things about me.  people don't believe me.  others answer for me because they  think  they know me well enough.  i lose a good friend.  i'm lonely.  it's spring but there's still snow on the ground and it takes forever to melt.  i take things for granted.  there's no hot water left to take a shower with.  my friends start dating someone and completely forget that i exist.  my friends start dating someone and start being total assholes because they see me as a threat.  i fall asleep with my contacts in.  i get sick.  i take online quizzes next to someone and they disagree with the answers i put and think i'm lying because they think they know what i think and feel.  people whisper around me.  there's nothing good on the radio.  i get in an argument with someone.  i feel like no one understands me at all.  i misplace something i need.  my room is messy and i'm super disorganized.  it's too cold to sleep.  people accuse me of things that they do.  i'm emotional.  there's nothing to do.  i'm away from my sister.  plants die.  my beliefs are attacked.  i lose sight of my values and everything seems to lose meaning.  someone takes my picture.   i share too much with someone because i'm naive and don't realize that i'm just an object to them.

      you pass people that you don't know and they smile at you.  little old men strike up conversations about the weather.  it's sunny out.  i have a great conversation with someone.  i feel happy.  i feel like i have made a difference.  people make an effort to do something with me.  someone enjoys my company.  people understand me.  i hear from an old friend.  i make a new friend.  i find old pictures from my childhood.  i have a wonderful dream.  i don't have to answer to anyone.  you first start dating someone and you get butterflies thinking about them and a feeling that maybe you won't be alone forever.  i can read someone correctly.  a song i've been dying to hear comes on the radio.  i get mix cd's.  i get new gadgets and open new cd's.  my sisters are around.  i feel energetic and alive.  i get to sleep naked.  no one is around and i turn up my music super loud and dance.  i watch a good movie.  i get snail mail.  someone has been thinking of me and does something special for no reason besides the fact that they wanted to.  people want to know about me or have an interest in me.  i build something.  i take something apart and put it back together.  my dad makes waffles on sundays.  a restaurant has deep fried mushrooms.  i beat a game.  i'm winning.  i feel successful.  people are honest.  people don't keep the truth from me because they are afraid to hurt me.  others listen.  it's a beautiful day out.  there's a thunderstorm.  karma works.

      last night was great...i mean new year's eve.  i was invited to a little get together at one of my colleagues homes with some of his friends.  i was a little worried about going somewhere to be with people i didn't know at all but it wasn't awkward at all!  in fact, i felt like i had known everyone for a really long time.  they were all super nice and it felt so right.  it was how i've always envisioned parties to be...and how friends are supposed to act.  and seeing him with his girlfriend was amazing.  they were the best example of a successful relationship that i've ever seen.  it gives me some hope.  i just felt so good being there.  i even got 2 kisses at midnight :)  i was proud of myself too because i drank wine the whole night.  considering i'm not a huge fan, and i've been meaning to drink more wine, i did good.  i think i had like 7 glasses of wine and then 2 glasses of champagne.  unfortunately, i passed out before it was even 1am.  i blame this on a mix of things.  1)  i had 7 glasses of wine and 2 glasses of champagne in a short amount of time, 2) i had 3 bloodtests done earlier that day, 3) i had only had one thing to eat all day, and 4) my doctor's appointment was at 7:20 in the morning so i had gotten up around 6:30 that morning.  not that i need to make excuses for falling asleep so early...  i hope i get to hang out with him and his friends more.  they totally seemed like people i would get along with super well all of the time...they seemed like me.  i had intelligent conversations, i was talking with everyone there, i was very social, i was good at the game we played, and i could tell they liked having me there.  and i slept really good too.  however, i won't be able to live down the fact that i slept on the couch with his old college roommate who is apparently super well endowed though.  every year they make a cd for him where the topic is his enormous penis.  it was pretty funny.  it's not that anything happened, but the rumor will still be spread around so that dirty minds can wander.  being there also helped me realize even more that the guys i live with are incredibly immature.  anyway, it makes me so happy that i had a fun night since i haven't had one of those in a long time.

      i went to church for the first time since being at olaf on ash wednesday.  it was actually a very emotional experience for me...in a way it felt like i was being cleansed.  i have sinned so much and have so much to repent for.  i've finally let go of the boys i held so dear to me.  it was hard but had to be done.  so the season of lent has begun.  i've never really given up anything for lent, but i think that i'm going to take this time and try to cleanse my life.  i need to look to my true friends and find my true self again.  i know it will be a good experience.  i feel so much better already.  i housesat this weekend.  i'm still kind of recovering from petsitting a cat.  my eyes are really puffy and i can't stop sneezing...there's cat hair all over.  i've taken benedryl but it's not helping anymore.  i really really enjoyed it though.  i got to stay in this amazing victorian house with a dog and a cat...right off of grand avenue.  i walked to the grand old creamery last night and to bruegger's bagels for lunch.  i also went to all of the trendy little shops yesterday morning, although i refrained from buying anything.  i really want to go clothes shopping soon.  i've lost about 10 pounds since i was weighed last (at the doctor's office about a month ago).  i'm feeling really good about myself right now...not that i was getting really chubby but losing 10 pounds means that all of my clothes fit me how they should now.  i haven't even been trying to lose weight...in fact, i stopped exercising after the move since i've been so busy, and i've been eating a lot more.  boggles my mind, but i'm not going to complain.  this week is going to be so incredibly busy.  monday (tomorrow) i have monday night skiing.  tuesday i'm taking a half a day off to see an endocrinologist.  wednesday night amber and i are going to juut salonspa to get new haircuts.  thursday i'm taking another half day and going to the dentist.  friday i'm eating dinner with a good friend.  also, tomorrow i'm being observed by a state person for our curriculum.  i'm nervous about that, but at the same time i'm open to helpful criticism.  saturday i'm going to be hanging out with my game buddy, drew, and amber to play some fun new strategy games.  sunday, something is happening but i can't figure out what.  i'm sure i'll find out soon enough.  anyway, i should probably get going so that i'm perky for my observation tomorrow.  fun fun fun...  goodnight, sleep tight, and don't let the bed bugs bite :)

      so...finally i have some down time.  actually i stayed home sick yesterday so i had a lot of down time, however i spent most of it sleeping and trying to get better.  i went shopping for games for my classroom after i got up at 2:30 pm.  i bought some good ones...mancala, set, equate (not sure how cool that one is), mastermind, cribbage, and scrabble.  all but cribbage and scrabble went to my classroom today.  i can't believe that my room is still not unpacked.  i moved around how it was arranged this past weekend though, so i've been busy trying to put things back into their proper spots.  basically, all i have left to unpack is my clothes...it's all laying in piles on my chairs, bed, and floor.  i'll definitely get to it this weekend (i hope).  i'm going to babysit on friday, housesit on saturday and sunday, hopefully visit with my buddy matt sometime, and maybe see the boys (if they decide to reply to the recent email i sent them).  i went to "intellectual game night" down at olaf last weekend and that was a lot of fun.  i played some new games that i seem to be addicted to right now.  i can't seem to get enough fluxx and i also played princes of florence, which was very fun (and i won!).  i've also been playing acquire a lot here at the apartment.  i'm glad that so many people i'm hanging out with now like playing games.  oh!  while i was down at olaf i ran into my junior year vegetarian hawaii trip buddy ned.  oh, i miss him!  he gave me one of the best hugs ever when he saw me...he actually hugged me like 3 times.  it was nice.  we exchanged phone numbers so hopefully we'll see each other sometime in the future.  unfortunately, he's teaching in green bay right now so isn't very close at all.  anyway, i haven't written for quite a while, but things are going really well.  the apartment is great.  the depression is almost completely gone.  my roommate is fabulous.  i've gotten out and have explored the area more and i'm finding a lot of cool stores.  i've been eating great food and listening to good new music.  i'm getting thinner.  the most important thing is that i'm really happy now.  hallelujah.

      yesterday was one of the most incredible days i've had in a long time.  it started off not-so-good...well only part was not good.  i woke up early and decided to go get some new memory for my computer.  i went to the closest store by me and they were out so i decided to bring the wireless adapter that i still had but belonged to the boys back to their house so i could go to the store by them.  i got my memory, got chai tea at caribou along with an almond poppyseed muffin (my favorite muffin), bought a sunday paper, and then headed over to the boys house.  i rang the doorbell and there wasn't really an answer so i tried the door and it was unlocked so i was just going to leave the adapter on the table or something but as soon as i walked through the door, kurt came around the corner and i think i scared him.  i said hi and he didn't say anything.  i handed him the adapter and said that i was just dropping it off.  i then said "i hope you have a good day" and he still didn't say anything to me.  when i got back home i im'd him and apologized for scaring him and/or waking him up.  no reply...and he wasn't idle.  then i asked why he wasn't talking to me and what i did.  no answer.  i started to cry again.  i hope they know how much this hurts.  the worst part is that they won't even tell me what i did.  drew told me that it probably has to do with shea's "love 'em and leave 'em" mentality.  and shea is sort of the deciding factor in that group...they always agree with him and do what he wants...so i guess that probably is the case.  i guess i should've believed him when he explained his problems with relationships and how he insisted that he couldn't be friends with someone he dated and how i'd end up hating him and our friendship would get destroyed.  i guess maybe that's the issue...he has this notion that everything is going to end up that way so it does because he makes it that way (and maybe it's not intentional).  i just really want to know what i did...and i wish someone would tell me...even if it wasn't any of them.  on the other hand, maybe i didn't do anything wrong and so they can't tell me what i did wrong because it really has everything to do with them.  it's hard because i really do miss them...dammit....i'm crying again.  why has my life been so trying?  it's not fair...i really deserve better than this.  i'm a good person and everywhere i turn people treat me like i don't have any feelings and they take me for granted.  anyway...that was a long tangent.  back to the great part of my day.  so we drove to zimmerman and met up at the birthday girl's house.  she also went to olaf but graduated with my roommate, although i had met her before while at olaf.  he house was so neat!  there was a huge indoor pool with a slide.  and they were on 15 acres so they had this incredible living room that jutted out over their yard so the view was breathtaking.  we left there and went to a rollerrink nearby.  i had so much fun skating.  i haven't been rollerskating in what seems like forever.  it's actually quite interesting how after rollerblading for so many years rollerskating is pretty difficult.  i quickly got the hang of it again though.  anyway, after a little while her brother came with a friend of his (they are both 23).  so i noticed that he had been watching me while i skated around and i went over to stand by amber and i all of a sudden did the funniest fall ever.  i started to fall backwards but i caught myself only to overcorrect it and start falling foward.  i caught myself again but went backwards a second time and then fell forward.  i ended up catching myself by putting my hands on the floor that time so i didn't get knocked all the way to the ground, but it was still embarrassing...especially since her cute brother was watching the whole thing.  anyway, i went back out on the floor only to come in right away since there were so many little kids running into me.  i sat over on one of the benches and then her brother came over and sat next to me and said "back already?"  so i explained to him that the kids were out of control and that they didn't know what they were doing and were quite dangerous because they can't steer themselves.  he agreed with me but then got called away by his friend.  the floor was starting to clear up so i went back out and skated for a while.  he was still watching me and talking to his friend and his friend kept looking at me too.  then i noticed that he started skating around and he would go really fast and catch up to me and then he would slow down but then i would speed up.  he finally caught up to me and started a conversation with me.  he introduced himself to me and wanted to know my name.  he then started to ask questions about me.  then a game started so we had to separate.  he got out in the first round and i made it to the last round but then got out.  when i went over to the group we were with after getting out he started talking to me right away and sat by me.  then we all got ready to leave and headed back to the house.  we went down to the bonfire and it was the biggest bonfire i've ever seen.  it was so hot too...everyone was down to their t-shirts.  anyway, we talked a little bit more but we both kind of drifted over to people we knew again.  then back up to the house for cake and ice cream.  as i was leaving i said bye to everyone and he looked at me with a look i've seen before but can't place.  i can't even explain it, but he said goodbye and told me that it was great meeting me and that he hoped we'd see eachother again.  i doubt we will, but i definitely wouldn't mind seeing him again!  it was just a nice, relaxing day, especially after being so emotional about the boys again.  i really do hope that we can all be friends again someday.  unfortunately, i think they see me as another "stef" and have cut off all ties with me.  it's even worse than how they treat her though because kurt still talked to her even though the other 2 guys stopped.  with me, none of them will talk to me.... :(

      so everyone makes mistakes here and there...like trying to fix a lamp, holding the part where all the wires are connected to screws and plugging it in to see if it works.  yes, needless to say, that is the mistake i made today and paid for it by getting a powerful surge of electricity up my arm and down my body.  for the majority of the day my arm was numb and tingly.  every time i'd touch something metal like a doorknob i got shocked again.  it was horrible.  i'm still not sure i have complete feeling back in my arm.  oh well...i'm sure it'll be good as new tomorrow morning.  anyway, i got a lot done today.  i got my mail and my spatula.  i found my missing shirt.  i got my car washed.  i bought a new wireless router (ours kind of sucked).  i went grocery shopping.  i ate at bruegger's bagels.  i bought a dozen bagels at bruegger's bagels to take home.  i took out all of the garbage and recycling.  i mixed some flower fertilizer and fed our dying plants.  i returned the usb hub i had bought.  i wrote valentine's cards to my grandparents and high school best friend.  i found a post office (only to find out they had already closed), bought postage in one of those little machines and mailed my letters.  attempted to fix a lamp and got shocked.  called my parents several times.  i also made keys for my tests and started to grade.  i watched say anything and the royal tennenbaums (sp?).  i balanced my accounts.  i think that's about it.  my roommate came home tonight and brought me a beautiful rose for valentine's day along with dark chocolate and white chocolate turtles (i don't like milk chocolate but i love the other two).  she is soooo incredibly sweet.  anyway, i should probably go socialize...we have a guest.  :)

      a weird dream i had hoped was real...an email that read, "kerry, come back...we miss you.  we love you and we're so incredibly sorry that we treated you like we didn't."  only it wasn't.  my inbox remains empty and still nothing heard from them.  is it the rent money?  i gave them notice i was moving out.  one had even told me that i needed to move out.  the other said he was indifferent.  the third asked me when i was moving in a way that suggested he wanted me out as soon as possible.  they pushed me out.  they treated me so horribly...i don't think anyone could have put up with it as long as i did.  the worst part is that they led me to believe that we would remain friends if i moved out and that everything was okay between us.  i'm so naive.  on another note, i feel like i have been on a vacation.  i am so relaxed and i am so incredibly happy.  although, i've come to realize that having a social life is extremely exhausting.  today is my first "free" day and it's going to be used to finish unpacking.  wednesday we had game night at our place.  thursday i went to the ice palace and then stayed up late making brownies.  friday i went to hinkley and stayed overnight at the casino with a bunch of my women co-workers.  saturday i went out to lunch with amber's family and then went shopping with them.  saturday night i went to an irish pub and listened to an incredible irish musician to celebrate drew's birthday.  it feels so incredibly good to have friends and things to do.  i'm starting to put my life back together and it feels wonderful.  i started emailing and im'ing old friends i haven't talked to in ages.  people i've let drift away from me.  i miss them all and i am so sorry for the person i have been becoming lately.  i started to not care anymore, which i think was a result of living with the boys, and things didn't seem to matter anymore.  it's sort of like everything was turning a shade of gray and i was living in black and white.  now, everything seems to be blossoming into full color and i feel so alive.  by old best friend ken is engaged and moving to rochester.  corey is doing an incredible job with his webdesigning business and is meeting all of these cool bands.  austin is going to be a father in june.  at school, i am convinced the student teacher working with my mentor teacher likes me.  i can't convince myself to be interested though.  it's not because he doesn't seem nice, because he does.  it's not because he isn't cute, because he is (although maybe too much that it scares me).  it's not because he isn't smart, because he is.  it's not because he seems to have a bad personality, because he doesn't.  actually, it feels really good for someone to be interested in me, but i think that may be the most dangerous part.  i know i'm not ready to be involved with anyone yet.  there are too many things in my life i'm still trying to put back together and it wouldn't be fair to the person i dated.  i'm also so incredibly happy right now that i'm really cautious about doing anything that might destroy that.  i've been hurt way too many times before.  i think shea was the worst.  i loved him before we even got involved.  i still love him.  but he only saw me as an object and used me.  he took everything he could from me and then just threw me away.  he's not even man enough to tell me what i did wrong and why i'm no longer worth his friendship.  he hurt me so much and he continues to hurt me.  out of the 4 guys i've been involved with, 4 led me on with no intention of staying with me, 4 lied to me (and i believed), 4 used me, 3 cut off all ties with me, 2 cheated on me, 4 hurt me an extreme amount, 4 wouldn't tell me what i did wrong, i don't think any of them think that they did anything wrong, and i don't hate any of them.  after shea, i am not sure i want to do anything "romantic" with anyone anymore.  i trusted him the most and i still can't believe that he can just take everything from me and then completely throw away my friendship.  i remember all of the conversations we had about how i was one of the few people he considered a friend and would do anything for.  i remember that we decided to stop dating for fear of destroying our friendship.  he was convinced that i would end up hating him and not want to be friends with him.  it's ironic that it seems to have worked the other way around.  i remember my conversations with kurt and how he told me how much shea loved me and that if he wasn't in love with kelsay he'd be in love with me too, and how he cared so much about me.  he also told me that if i moved out we would still hang out together and keep in touch.  he wouldn't talk to me on im today so i guess that isn't the case.  and mike.  we have been through so much together to just throw it all away.  but i guess he has megan now and that's all that matters to him.  i hate this all so much.

      i am just having a great week.  i love my classes...and i love my new apartment and my new roommate...and i love this town.  everything just seems to be falling into place...finally.  i'm meeting new people.  i'm hanging out with old friends i haven't seen in forever.  we had a "game night" at our place tonight with 3 old friends from college.  one of my old math profs was going to come too but ended up not being able to come at the last minute.  it was A LOT of fun though.  i also learned that one of my old college friends is going to be a father come july.  i'm really excited for him!  i've finally found some good people to hang out with.  i also made a friend the other morning when my car was plowed in, and i've met a few people in the apartment.  there's also the new math teacher, who is my age, and a new math student teacher that's working next door and he seems super nice and he's pretty cute too ;)  he was flirting with me today, that felt good.  he also told my mentor teacher that he was next door to one of the nicest people.  so things are looking up.  i'm contemplating whether i should go and clean up the pumpkins at the house or not.  after them stealing my utensils and hat, not washing my dishes, continuously lying to me, and not returning any of my efforts, i'm thinking maybe our friendships are completely over and that i'm not obligated to do anything for them since they obviously won't do anything for me and they are treating me like crap.  i was going to go this weekend and clean up the pumpkins and get my bikes but i'm thinking maybe i'll wait a little while.  i don't really want to go back there anytime soon.  i'm just so incredibly happy to be out of there.  i'm so lucky that there are good people in the world and i happen to know a few of them and that they are watching out for me.  anyway, it's bedtime for me.  i'm exhausted...all of this moving and shopping and playing has worn me out.  it's funny because all of my coworkers and students keep saying "wow!  we're not used to you being so happy!"  i really do have a social life now and i don't feel friendless anymore.  i think i'm almost whole again.

      things just happen and no one is really sure why and because they don't know why things went wrong they aren't really sure how to fix them and it just becomes frustrating...

      i think too much...and read into things way too much...so from now on i just won't.  i need to stop dwelling on bad thoughts and start moving on.  i care even less than before...if someone has a problem with me, that's their problem.  if they value me as a friend, they know how to find me or get ahold of me...i am done with putting in effort that doesn't get returned.  i just can't care anymore...friendwise and guywise .  i am too happy for people who play childish games to ruin it for me...

      so...i'm just about to head off to drew's families house to petsit/housesit for 10 days.  amber, drew, and drew's family left for spain today.  i'm jealous...they will have so much fun.  not that i won't, but i wish i was going to spain.  spring break was nice...although coming back after relaxing hit me like a train.  i'm so incredibly exhausted.  each day i'm getting better though.  i'll be back off and on the next few days.  i'm hoping to get some reading done and such.  i have a barnes & noble giftcard from kurt for christmas so i might as well use it and get myself something good to read.  i'm going to miss sleeping with my new down comforter...it's so cozy.  maybe i'll end up bringing it over there.  alright, well i was going to right more...like about my coffeeshop excursion and such but i will have to write about that next time...from now until then....

      wow...this is why i love spring.  it's about 60 degrees right now and the sun is shining so brightly.  started my day off by attempting to make a smoothie...unfortunately i can't seem to get them to taste like the ones i get at orange julius :(  which is, of course, what i was after.  then i filled out my new address book, which was incredibly fun because it's new and oh so cool.  next i went to mike & shea's house to pick up one of my bikes.  rang the doorbell, saw shea.  then i realized that kurt wouldn't be there because he wasn't on spring break anymore.  shea didn't seem like he really cared i was there.  asked if he wanted to go eat lunch...he said he was just about to go to a movie.  i asked if he was going alone and he said that stef was there.  stef being the stef that all three of them refused to acknowledge for the past, i don't know, like 6 months or so.  so, i guess that gives me hope that maybe someday they'll acknowledge me again.  i guess i'd still like to hear from them once in a while.  ugh, that's my heart speaking.  why is it so incredibly hard to let go of friendships completely?  it's hard because i love them and still care about them.  my brain says that i should be smarter than all of this and leave them behind since they don't love me or care about me even close to the amount that i do for them.  i know, the best thing i can do is to not think about it and just let fate work it's wonders.  yeah, so now i have a bike.  still have one over there but at least this is a start.  if i put the wheel back on, maybe i can ride my bike a little bit this weekend.  my roommate is leaving for washington dc right after work today.  drew is playing a benefit concert this weekend out there.  it'll be cool.  wish i could have gone.  need the money though...too many bills.  i just ate lunch outside in our courtyard...got a sandwich from bruegger's bagels.  it was very tasty.  i want a dog so i can name him ludo.  amber and drew are going to spain for a week and a half starting next wednesday.  i'll be house/pet sitting abby and cosmo stevenson.  it'll be fun, especially now with the weather so incredibly nice that i can sit outside and grade stuff.  yesterday was fabulous too.  it rained and it was so refreshing.  made homemade ravioli (all the way from scratch) and tomato sauce with matt last night.  it was a lot of fun.  also made these really tasty asparagus roll thingys.  mmmm....and we also watched a knight's tale (mmmm...heath ledger ;) ).  yeah, so now i'm procrastinating so i don't have to clean my room.  but unfortunately it is necessary.  i need to finally be unpacked!  okay, and with that...here i go...super cleaning kerry machine!

      just like in that movie i watched.  i need a clean slate.  i was cleaning out my email folders and came across a few from various people.  they made me cry...   from mike:  "Nothing that you do in your friendship with me is a waste of my time, it could never be so.  ...I just try to live my life the best that I can, like everyone else...Part of that is not leaving you just because we've had a disagreement, no matter how big it is.  I want you to be my friend no matter what.  ...If you don't want to be friends right now, I will understand.  I hurt you and that's just not good.  If you do ever decide that you want to, though.  I will always be here."   from kurt: "I am sure everything WILL work out for the best, even if that "best" isn't the best that we want."   from shea:  "You are super cool.  I like you a lot.  You should have my babies.  ...You are missed.  ...I'll dream of you tonight i'm sure."   from johnson:  "I promise two things: I'll always be your friend, through thick or thin as long as you'll take me, and that I'll share with you what's troubling me, as you've shared me with me what's troubling you."   from dave:  "need a hug?  stop by tomorrow, i can give you one :)"   from nik:  "I can guarantee you one thing...you’ll always have a friend :)"  "As you go on your journey through life, you’ll meet so many different and unique people.  Most of them won’t understand you or your thoughts.  But every once in a while, in your travels, you’ll meet someone who does... you’ll see it in their eyes, and know that even though you may be worlds apart in some ways...that they truly understand you.  Your lives may have been completely different...but you’ve shared the same joys, and the same tears.  And wherever you go, there will be a special place in your heart for them.  I know this because you have a place in mine. "  "I never wanted to break up with you, and I never wanted to hurt you.  I wish I could take back a lot of those things, but I can't now.  I wanted things to be so happy with us, and I wanted them to last forever.  You wouldn't believe how many nights I would fall asleep just thinking about how much I loved to spend time with you, and how I wanted to enjoy that forever with you...I'm sorry that I ruined a good relationship with a great girl.  I will probably be sorry about that for a long time to come.  I'm sorry that from now on all I will have is memories about the good things.  I really mean it... I want to cry just thinking about it. "   well...this will be the last i see of these as i am attempting to erase my memory of things that hurt me...

      i'm back "home" now...it feels so good to be here.  i miss my sisters and my parents so much...plus, i really like having a dog or five to cuddle up with at night.  i just got back from the movies.  we went to see sunshine for the spotless mind (for some reason i know that title isn't right...).  i almost hate to go to movies anymore because the seats are always so uncomfortable...i toss and turn in my seat and still by the time the movie is over my body is sore from sitting that long.  other than that i like the whole movie experience.  i think it's weird i've never been on a date to a movie.  maybe it's not so weird, especially if you think about how many "dates" i've actually had.  the weird thing about me is that i seem to get involved with my closest friends...but we never start going on dates or anything...we just start being involved...but never quite get to the "boyfriend/girlfriend" stage...whatever that is.  then we end things and never speak to each other again.  i don't think i've ever been considered someone's girlfriend.  i think that may be even weirder than the movie thing.  so, the movie was alright.  i fell asleep during part of it, but that's been common lately...i've been getting really bored with things and losing interest in just about everything.  at the end it made me cry.  i think the part about someone erasing their memory of another person sort of reminded me of what happened with the boys and i and how i felt about it.  i still don't understand but i guess it's not meant for me to understand and honestly, i've moved on and realized that they aren't friends.  i don't think i'd even want to talk to them if they did approach me.  they aren't worth it to me anymore.  especially after all that they've put me through.  the part that really got me to cry was that the girl sort of reminded me of that jenny girl...i think it was the hair and the drinking aspect of her, oh and how she was always screaming at him...and it made me think of shea and how all i ever wanted was for him to be happy and i really was happy for him that he met her, but how he could only think about how i must be obsessed with him because i wanted to continue to be part of his life as a friend.  then on the way home, i heard some songs that reminded me of the boys and all the good times we've had.  oh, how much fun we had over the summer living in the condo.  oh, and shea's birthday.  that was great.  i made duplicates of this great picture of kurt, shea, and i that we had taken at one of the bars and i was going to frame them and give them as christmas presents but i never got around to buying the frames.  and i remember sitting on the sidewalk of nicollet and shea kissing me and i made him stop because kurt was watching us.  and he told me how much he liked me and i told him that he only thought that he liked me and once he got to know me he wouldn't like me any more.  and he told me that he already knew me and that he couldn't see himself not liking me...  ugh, i still have to get my bikes.  all i have to say is that they better still be there when i go to get them.  i paid $150 for them and they are certainly not theirs to mess with.  hopefully i won't run into any of them while i'm there.  i'm still pissed off for them not sending me my w-2's, or even telling me that they had them so i could have gone and gotten them.  of course, i'm assuming that they have/had them but i think it's a very accurate assumption considering that's where my mail was being sent at that time and it never showed up anywhere else.  i can't wait for summer.  bike riding...rollerblading...reading on the grass...hopefully meeting some new people...taking that glassblowing class...doing volunteer work...relaxing...ahhhh...it will be nice.  well, i guess i should go to sleep.  i'm tired and it's been an emotionally draining night.  i hate the fact that those boys are still lingering around in my memories and ruining my happy moments even though they are out of my life...

      yay!  i have a new wardrobe!!  i went shopping today and bought a bunch of new clothes.  i figured it was time...after wearing the same 3 pairs of pants over and over again every day this winter.  i can't believe how enjoyable it was to go shopping this time.  usually it's really quite depressing and i end up crying in the fitting rooms because nothing fits right.  this time, everything seemed to fit perfectly...i even found jeans that fit me (which is unbelievable).  i can't wait to wear something new to school on monday!  i'm scared for this week to come.  supposedly we'll know which teachers aren't coming back next year because of the budget cuts by the end of the week (right before our spring break).  at first i wasn't worried about my position because we have someone retiring in our department.  however, we just received the enrollment numbers and math is down quite a bit, which means technically they can get rid of 2 teachers in our department...and i'm the newest one and only one of two who aren't tenured yet.  i also didn't know that they were cutting 22 teachers this year in the district.  ugh...at least i have an updated resume.  too bad their aren't many math openings posted yet.  well, i'm crossing my fingers that i don't get bad news...  i have a feeling that i'm going to find someone soon.  meaning someone that is interested in me and who i might start dating.  so far i don't think i've met this person.  it's really sort of a bizarre feeling.  i wonder if i'm right or if i'm just a wishful thinker.  i guess we'll see...  well, i think i'm going to head to bed.  i'm really not all that tired but i know i need to catch up on sleep and i have a lot to do tomorrow.  so, goodnight, sleep tight, and don't let the bed bugs bite!  :)

      something's on my mind.  i can't seem to put my finger on it.  maybe i'll post about it tomorrow or sunday if i remember.  i'm so happy it's FINALLY the weekend.  it certainly feels like the weeks are getting longer and longer.  my students have been wild this whole week...i think it's been because the weather has been warming up a little.  i'm afraid my vocal chords are beginning to get strained from attempting to talk over the noise.  there are only 5 more days before spring break.  i wish i was going somewhere exciting but unfortunately i'm just heading home.  my mom had surgery today on her shoulder so i hope that went alright.  i sent her flowers...i hope she likes them (i know she will).  it's her birthday in a few days so it'll sort of be like an early b-day present too.  i also got 425 worldperks miles!  i couldn't believe that!!  i guess i should send flowers more often ;)  anyway, i'm going shopping for new clothes tomorrow and i can't wait.  i'm so sick of all my clothes right now, which will change once i can start wearing all of my skirts when it warms up outside.  i'm also going to attempt to finish unpacking.  it'll be nice if i can get most of it done so i don't have much to do over spring break.  i definitely need a period of time where i'm not thinking about school or stuff i need to do.  on a completely different topic...it's funny...students in one class are trying to set me up with the cute student teacher next door.  supposedly he told them that he liked me today...which i don't quite believe he said...but it's sort of flattering i guess.  lately people have been saying things to me that make me feel pretty good about myself...like austin told me i was "remarkably attractive" the other day, while another guy we were with (who i was meeting for the first time) seemed shocked when he found out i was single and was watching me the whole night.  then there was the brother of amber's friend that was watching me and starting conversations with me at the rollerskating party/bonfire.  one of my male colleagues and the student teacher called me hot the other day.  amber let me know that when we went shopping there were a few guys that were obviously checking me out.  in a way i don't understand because even though i've lost about 10 lbs. since i've moved away from the boys, it's not all that noticeable.  i think maybe more of it has to do with the way i'm presenting myself.  i definitely feel happier and more confident.  along similar lines, the last queer eye for the straight guy episode was the best ever.  it was about a figure skating couple and it was so romantic.  it actually made me really sad that i didn't have a boyfriend...which is weird because i've been anti-romance for a while now.  i still don't want to date anyone right now, but i guess it's looking more hopeful for the future...which is more than i could say before...

      wow, i can't believe that i've been blogging for 4 months now.  it seems like such a long period of time...although it has rushed past me incredibly fast.  time is such a mysterious thing.  it baffles me.  i'm really happy with life right now and not sure if i want it to be flying by.  i've stopped taking my anti-depressents which is a really good thing in my mind.  occasionally i have bouts of crying but very rarely.  i think the only time i've cried recently was when i was down at olaf visiting with a good friend who knows the boys well, and it wasn't a big cry by any means.  although i'm off the medication, i've been getting tested for the sicca syndrome.  i'm fairly sure i don't have it, although it would make a lot of sense if i did (based on things that have been anything but normal lately).  teaching is going well.  friday was a crazy day.  not only was school still in session, which is only abnormal due to the fact there was a HUGE snowstorm and the roads were super icy, but the parking lot wasn't plowed at all and we had a power outage.  after the power finally came back on, someone pulled the fire alarm.  it was ridiculous.  by the end of the day there were so few kids there because with each incident more left.  not to mention that there seem to be A LOT of people going on spring vacations this coming week so many students weren't there anyway.  however, our spring break is still 2 weeks away.  ooooh, not this weekend but the following weekend amber and i are going to be throwing a party!  it's going to be a "green party" for st. patty's day.  we're going to make green cookies, green milkshakes/malts, green snacks, etc.  we'll also find some green beer.  it'll be fun!  i can't wait.  it's funny...i just joined the chickensox community...which is sort of like a blog in a way.  i don't feel comfortable sharing pretty much anything on it though so i'll just use it to keep in touch with everyone.  i got to hang out with chris and the other amber last night.  they had game night at their house.  amber and i brought along austin, drew, and this pretty cute german guy named steffen.  then mercy showed up a little later.  it was fun.  we played acquire, kill dr. lucky, and cranium.  i really want to go get chai tea somewhere right now but i want to go with amber and drew and they aren't up yet.  oh well.  guess i might have to do something productive...like unpack and clean my room!  hooray for that.  i hope i get that done today.  i got my w-2 from olaf yesterday (i broke down and paid them the money for it considering the boys are so frickin' immature and i figured that i would never get it from them) so i did my taxes right away.  i'm going to be getting so much back in taxes...it's really great!  it's going straight into my savings account not to be messed with.  so, i felt pretty productive yesterday.  amber and i also attempted to make over our couch but that didn't go so well.  we've headed back to the drawing board.  well, i'm off to clean my room...the fun never stops ;)

      ugh...my head hurts.  this has been an ongoing thing for the past 2 weeks or so.  nothing i take seems to help, which is unfortunate because it really makes it hard to do a lot of things when your head feels like someone is hitting it with a hammer.  otherwise things are going really well.  i had an observation today and she seemed to think i was doing a good job.  everyone has been commenting on my teaching...so that feels good.  maybe one day i will become teacher of the year ;)  that's not a bad thing to hope for...it's a big achievement.  anyway, i'm trying to decide if i want to take classes at the u this summer or take the summer off and take a week-long class up in northern wisconsin.  the week-long class sounds so fun...you stay in a cabin and take a class on glassblowing.  i'm really excited about doing that.  i could maybe do both depending on the dates.  i'm looking forward to a break though.  i feel like my life is going so well right now.  things actually couldn't get much better.  let's see...if my life was perfect right now, the weather would be warm enough to wear sandals every day since i hate socks and shoes.  i also wouldn't be getting headaches like this or be allergic to cats.  i really wish i wasn't.  i petsat for a cat this weekend and he was sooo incredibly cute and loved me so much.  i snuggled with it a lot but had to take a ton of benedryl and was knocked out every time.  back on track though...in a perfect world guys would feel.  i'm more convinced than ever that guys are incapable of feeling.  other than that, the only other thing i would change would be to either add another weekend day or put more hours in a day.  these are all trivial things though...and things i have no control over...so all in all, life is grand at the current moment.  speaking of grand....i went to a truffle shop on grand ave. the other day with amber and bought some truffles.  i'm eating them right now.  they are to die for.  i really love this bailey's one.  the amaretto one and the creme de menthe one is also pretty good.  mmmm...i really shouldn't eat them all at once...but it's too hard not to...  i should probably get to bed.  i'm tired.  yay for a half day tomorrow...and thursday.  it'll be nice.  well, until next time, be well...

      well, for my birthday i have decided that 5 months of secret (for the most part) journaling has been enough to let me venture out into the world of true blogging...where i can be searched for...where people can read my entries and whatnot...so i've started a livejournal account.  drew encouraged me, without knowing at all.  i've thought about it for a while...but i purposely started a blog here so that people couldn't search for me or happen to stumble upon me.  i'm moving on, and hopefully this will be the start of the journal i've wanted from the start...we'll see... :)

      i had such a nice day today.  i walked all over town today!  well, maybe not the whole town but my section of it.  i walked over to austin & brooke's unexpectedly...was greeted at the door by austin in his bathrobe.  with the time change it was already 1.  so, austin & i played boggle for a while.  then once brooke woke up we walked all of the way to green mill (about 1.5-2 miles maybe).  we ate pizza, which was tasty.  then we walked back and on the way home we stopped at the grand ole creamery.  just got home about a half an hour ago.  it was such a beautiful day out so i'm glad i had the opportunity to walk around so much.  sorta tired now though.  probably will be an early night for me.  i'm debating whether or not to run back to the apartment and grab some new clothes for tomorrow.  i kind of want to wear a skirt or something...i don't know.  i hate driving all of the way over there though.  maybe if i take a quick nap...

      ugh, i just saw a preview for a show called "the swan."  apparently it's a beauty pageant for all these women who get plastic surgery.  it really makes me wonder how the world got so screwed up.  everything about this show is so incredibly wrong.  it makes me sick.  why can't everybody just be happy with what God gave them?  and why can't people understand that everyone isn't supposed to look the same?  anyway, enough about that...  so i'm sitting over here in drew's parents house, their sunroom to be exact.  it's really nice to be living in a house again.  i mean i like living in my apartment and all, but i really like having stairs, 2 different doors, a yard, pets, lots of windows, and different rooms.  they come back next saturday.  i figured that while i was here i was going to start reading some books so i went to the bookstore today.  with my educator discount and the $20 gift certificate kurt gave me, i bought 4 books and spent less than $4.  actually 2 of them were in this really cool used book section of the store, so each of those were only like $4 a piece to start with.  i'll have to check in there more often...although i really can't afford to buy any more "leisure" items like books or music for a while.  my purchases included: atlas shrugged, stranger in a strange land (both of those suggested readings), maggie cassidy, and naked lunch.  i'm going to start reading tonight!  my birthday is monday.  it might be lonely.  amber and drew are in spain.  i think i might go out with 2 other friends on tuesday night.  unfortunately the twins are playing their first game monday night so a lot of people won't be around the night of my actual birthday.  i'll be going out with my coworkers for drinks on thursday night...which will be interesting considering i don't really drink anymore.  oh well...what's another birthday?  :)  okay, i'm going to start doing some school stuff...later...

      so, here i am...sitting here in front of the computer again.&nbsp; what's on my mind?&nbsp; how ridiculous this whole roommate this is.&nbsp; amber wrote me a note saying why she was mad at me.&nbsp; the reason?&nbsp; because i supposedly posted in my lj that i was annoyed with her and that she wasn't smart.&nbsp; however, if she had actually read my post...i never said anything about her.&nbsp; and it's not like i even alluded to any of this.&nbsp; she must have a complex or something about thinking she's not smart...or that other people think she's not smart.&nbsp; it's just all so frustrating.&nbsp; i'm not trying to be sneaky and write things so that people&nbsp;have to&nbsp;read between the lines.&nbsp; what i write IS what i mean.&nbsp; plus, why would i say something like that about her if i knew she was going to read it.&nbsp; anyway, so we're still not really talking.&nbsp; mainly i think we just both do a good job of avoiding each other.&nbsp; i just want to forget about the whole thing but i don't want to discuss it.&nbsp; i hate arguments.&nbsp; and most of the time i hate defending myself because i feel as if they aren't going to listen to me in the first place, and they certainly aren't going to change their mind and suddenly see things my way.&nbsp; whatever.&nbsp; i'm too happy to have to deal with this crap...so i'm not going to.   i'm leaving in a few days for michigan.&nbsp; i'm excited.&nbsp; i'm also going to go out to dinner & bowling with matt tomorrow.&nbsp; can't imagine how this won't be fun.&nbsp; friday i have a going away party for my old college roommate.&nbsp; she's heading to colorado for grad school.&nbsp; i'm excited for her.&nbsp; too bad we haven't gotten to hang out while we've lived in the same area.&nbsp; i'm going to find a present for her tomorrow.&nbsp; who knows?&nbsp; i might be joining her out there in a few years.&nbsp; colorado is one of the places i'm looking at moving to.&nbsp; that or the seattle area...or portland area...or possibly even the san francisco area (probably not though since it's an arm & a leg to get a teaching license out there).&nbsp; i just really want to move out west.   well, tomorrow is another day.&nbsp; right now, i'm going to go listen to some tunes.

       i wish that things were different.  so many things.  too many things to list.           i hate that feeling i get when i try to hold back tears and my throat closes up...and all of the muscles in my jaw begin to hurt.            i'm torn between past memories and what i know is right for me to do. i try to make connections with old friends that hurt me knowing that i shouldn't...and then they get the best of me because they make it obvious that they don't care. they still have the power to make me cry. why is it so hard to let go? i'm not as strong as i make myself believe.     and why don't people care? why don't other people feel pain? how come i seem to feel pain so much deeper than anyone else? i want answers but i can't find them. but what would i do with them if i had them?   sometimes i feel so alone. yet, there are so many times when i truly believe that i want to be alone. i think if i didn't really want to be alone i would work harder at not being alone. i ruin friendships. i don't keep in touch with the friends i do have. i don't try to keep romantic relationships from falling apart...i just let go...and then have trouble actually letting go after they're gone. i'm not making any attempt at finding someone new to start a relationship with. truth is, i really don't know how now that i'm out of college. that and i'm not sure there's really a point to it all.  maybe i don't really wish that things were different.  not many things.  just few enough to list.

       well, i got my citation dismissed for having "obstructed plates."  felt good about that.  i just woke up and it's about 2am.  i've been sleeping since around 6pm...so that seems right...a good 8 hours of sleep.  however, i'm gonna have to go back to bed.  need my beauty sleep and all that jazz since i'm going to go get my mn license tomorrow.  i've been going to sleep so early so i don't need to run into amber.  i don't know why.  i always get like this...it's like i'm so embarrassed that i did something that made someone mad at me that i hide.  it's just so much easier to avoid things than to face the problem head on.  i don't want to have a conversation about it.  my ultimate question is why she won't take her shoes off at the door!  it's driving me insane, and maybe that's what her goal is.  i'm refusing to wash the floors again.  i came to an important revelation today.  i realized that i have a control problem.  this is what is different about me.  it started happening after dating nik and he cheated on me with my roommate.  i knew something was different but i haven't been able to put my finger on it, until now.  so...instead of being controlling of my food, like most people do and have eating disorders...i need everything to be a certain way or i get all worked up.  it makes a lot of sense.  i mean, if i can control everybody else, i won't get hurt, right?  wrong.  it just makes me crazy.  but...i can see why my mind is trying it.  maybe i should get a self-help book about it.  i really would like to be like how i was before.  although, i'd of course be a little less naive and have a better eye for assholes.  there was a little bit of a storm tonight.  i was hoping for a big one.  i really like sleeping curled up in a ball and listening to the rain hit the windows.  like a cat.  hmm...i'm sort of worried about taking this driving test tomorrow.  no, not the road test...just the written one.  i'm a good driver...and it's only common sense.  however, for some unknown reason i'm worried.  i really can't afford a driver's license...but i need to get it done while i'm still off for the summer because once school starts and i start chaperoning, helping out with all of these events like math team, and not to forget grading tests and quizzes, i won't have any spare time left.  although, hopefully i'll have enough time to get a spare job on the side.  i'm thinking waitressing...or a coffeeshop worker.  coffeeshop worker sounds the best...but i don't know if i'll get hired or anything...those jobs always seem to fill up fast.  i just need a little extra money to pay off my debt before new year's so that i can plan on buying a laptop semi-soon.  AND i really need to save up more money for the summer than i did this year.  my goal is to have enough money saved up before next summer to be able to buy a laptop at the beginning of the summer.  we'll see what happens.  anyway, it's 2:20 now so i should get back to bed.  surprisingly i'm still tired.  probably from staring at this computer screen.

        wow, i've been gone a while and they really fixed up the blogger system!  i love it.  anyway, i've decided to get away from livejournal and start posting semi-private entries again.  only a few people know this address...most importantly my ultra-sensitive roommate and her boyfriend don't know the address.  somehow she always seems to read too much into my entries and come up with something that i didn't really say that offends her or makes her think that i am secretly mad at her.  it's really quite frustrating.         anyway, enough of that.  i spent today cleaning the whole apartment.  i seem to be the only one that ever cleans the bathroom.  i've cleaned it about 6 times since we've moved in (about once a month...which i admit is not often enough) compared to amber only "dusting" it and washing the floor once.  true, i don't have a job right now so i have time to spare, but i do have a lot of other stuff that i'm working on.  that's okay, at least i know it's getting cleaned well if i do it myself (NOT saying that amber wouldn't clean it well if she did clean it!!!).          continuing on though...i scrubbed the outside of the frigerator (gosh, that looks so wrong...shouldn't frige have a 'd' in it?  oh well.) and the kitchen sink...the bathtub, the bathroom floor, the toilet, the bathroom sink, the living room floor, the entry floor, the kitchen floor, the breakfast nook, the kitchen counters, the drying rack.  i also did my laundry.       i took a shower today and forgot that i had opened the window all of the way for the fumes to escape.  i went to grab the soap behind the shower liner that covers the window, so i pulled it back and managed to give my neighbors a full frontal show.  actually, i ended up just flashing my bosom and quickly shut the liner.  don't think anyone saw.  it doesn't really matter anyway though since i change with my blinds open all the time.  granted, i still have undergarments on, but still.  i'm sure if anyone was watching they can imagine what i look like without them on.         took a long nap and then watched donnie darko.  my school webpage is coming along quite nicely.  once it's up and running i'll post the link.  i have 3 baby tomatoes.  they are so cute.  kind of keeps me from wanting to eat them.  they are all on one plant.  the second plant has flowered a lot but doesn't seem to be developing any tomatoes.  i'm kind of worried about that.  it probably just needs some time.         i'm sort of hurt.  i had come up with the idea to play poker tonight with drew and his buddies.  i was really excited since this was the first time i was going to actually play poker.  well, he mentioned last night that it was going to take place today...and asked me if i was still in.  i didn't say that i wasn't but for some reason, i was never contacted today about playing.  so, i guess he's mad at me too.  whatever.  i really don't need any friends.  plus, i probably wouldn't have gone anyway, but i still would've liked for him to make sure i didn't want to participate...especially since it was my idea in the first place.         other news?  i'm not sure there is any.  this is long enough, don't you agree?!?!?!  alright, i'm going to go wallow in my own self-misery.
