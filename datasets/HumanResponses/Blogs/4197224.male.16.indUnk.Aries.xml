      Hey Yall I kow i haven't been posting regulary but that just gives me more to talk about right now.  Well i've gotten RPGmaker2003 and i've started making my FIRST videogame ever. The game isn't going to be as good graphics as the games we have now adays, the graphics of it are going to be like the Final Fantasies off of the Super Nintendo. How most of you will be like >_ I'm not going to tell any of you the story right now but as i get more into the game i'm going to let out Demos for you guys to try out and as i let out the Demos i'm going to give some informations on them and the story on them. The First Demo should be out sometime this month i wanted to let it out this week but i don't think i'm going to be able to do it seeing as i'm only one guy working on a WHOLE GAME. So by the end of this mouth i should have it done. The First Demo will have the First Town in the story and the First dungeon then let off there. If any of you are interested in Testing the game for me just post a comment to this Post ok and make sure you tell me you are interested in testing it for me. if you want to i can also add i book of yours into the game cause i have loads of open books laying around on the Maps which have no writing in them so i'll take stories, Jokes, Journals you would like me to put in, or anything that would normally go into a book.  Other then that not much has been going on. My group of friend from school have started a band that meets in Jazz Band and the Band teacher loves Rock, so it is more of Rock Band now lol. But yeah during Rock Band now my friend all Rock out during it just improving the whole thing as the rest of the class sits around lolol. But they have been like ____ you should change into Jazz Band but i'm like no i can't play anything, I can Sing but that is it i could learn to play something though but i have Choir during that period so i don't really want to change even though i do cause All my close friends are in that class so. I want to but i don't which is really a pain. I would love to rock with them but the thing is like i said i can't play an intrument. I should have Rob or Gabe teach me how to play so i can play, cause Rob and Gabe are leaving the High School next year; they are seniors. Which REALLY SUCKS but then again i'm going to be a Senior next year which well suck BIG one also. I don't want to leave high school cause i'll have no friends, which i don't have many right now anyway but still.  Well night all.  Dratis

      Ok my main Topic of talking today is going to be the Relationships i have online. I have two girls online that like me, one is named Isis and one is named Reni.  Isis is my Roleplay Girlfriend. I don't know much about her In Real Life and that her family has Health problems that take her away from the computer alot cause her mom gets sick alot. In Roleplay she is a part wolf. She is very kind and loving, we have three adopted kids Keyto, Clover, and Kiki. She will fight if she needs to though, but most of the time if someone attacks her i jump in and defend her, which she helps to sometimes but most of the time i have her stand back. Then after that we do our normal talking and cuddling. We talk alot out Roleplay and stuff but we have talked out Real Life like once or twice so. Most of the time she is on for a short time but in that short we time talk alot and both feel good, She is really cool and i like her.  Reni a know from Roleplaying also but i also know her outside of the computer. I've never seen Reni other then Pictures she had sent me, but i have talked to her on the phone. To me she is funny, and fun to be with. She is a pretty good Tomboy, and she flirts alot, mostly with me and see loves to tease me also ^_^ which is fun for me cause i tease her right back. But me and her really like each other so.  Those are the relationships i have online. I have alot more friends but does are the only RELATIONSHIPS i have. Peace all i'll post later.  Dratis

      OK my Second post this still feels kind of weird keeping a journal but anyway.  Man i feel so closed at school. The main reason being ______ which is something i don't think anyone at the school would understand. It is a small school so if i tell one person by the end of the month everyone is going to know. And most of the school is made up of Idiots who think they are call just guess they act gangster, But if any of them where gangsters they would Die so fast i would be laughing at them for months. I need to stop talking about this before i give to much away, they only thing i can say is that no one would think of me the same. I do have one friend that i think would understand her name is Rosy.  Well that is one of the things that went though my mind today. another was now boring English is and how it kind of seems like the teachers wants us to go to a religion but this could just be because we are reading a book about religion right now >_  I'm always thinking about how the girls that i like never like me. Like my friend Fiona. I've liked her since i first saw her my Freshmen year, even though she is my friend she has never shown any signs of liking me, and it is the same thing with Jade, i like her but she doesn't seem to like me at all more then a friend and that not even that much. Which sucks cause this is how it has always been in my love life which is really sad, but i know i'm not the only one who's love life is like this. Also another thing is that all of the people at the school have known each other since they where young, all but a few but they seem to find their place very fast. Unlike me I don't feel like i've found my place and i've only known anyone at this school since my Freshmen year. So i don't feel like i know anyone really good. Though i am getting to know Fiona alot, I'm not sure if i know stuff about her no one else does but she does start conversations with me on Mess so that is a big change in things.   Well that is all i'm going to say today. and the Blank spaces are places i had things but toke them out cause i don't feel you guys should know.

      Ok People Before i starts i'm going to set one ground rule if you don't like what i say SHUT THE FUCK UP, if you have something helpful to say go right ahead but other wise FUCK OFF. Ok with that said here we go.  Ok the name you people are going to know me By is Dratis, if you see the name somewhere else it is most likely me if not post a comment to me so i will know. Oh and RIGHT NOW it is a trademark of me with it 6:02 pm Thuesday, August 10th 2004.  Most of my live outside of school is taking up by the computer. I play EMUlators on the computer, listen to music, and I Roleplay alot. My Character On Roleplay has a Girlfriend right now her name is Isis, She is part Wolf, and my character is Dratis, part Dragon. Mostly in RP i just hang with friends but i need to get back to doing something other then that but anyway.  I live 20 minutes away from town and i don't own a car so like you may have guessed i have NO social life, which sucks. I do have friends though, i never get to talk to them face to face outside of school but still i have them. Alot of time i wish i lived in town but i really don't think that would change anything. So mostly i sit at home and Read Text that has someone on the other end. This sucks cause even though i know there is another person on the other side of the text none of their feelings come though.  About my social life the only thing i can say is there is none. It never changes at all. I go to school hang out with my friends then go home and never hear from them. I hear about them having get togethers and things but only after these events happen. And when i try to get ever to come over How one can ever make it, GOD DAMMIT. But with that aside my Friends are cool, I'm a Rocker so i hang out with Rockers most of them can play an intrusment like the guitar or something, i would know how to also but i don't have the money to buy one i barely have the money to buy anything at all, other then food and stuff like that. And The Lake of money is why only my mom owns a car and even the one she has is Old and messed up so. I am learning how to get a hold on the getting into first gear on it so it helps, I wish she had an automatic so we could consitrate on driving more then getting into first gear even though i know how to drive just fine. Since we are on the subject of driving most of my friends have Car but the never drive them to school just cause the Bus costs less for them to ride then their car. And for me i have more Friends then just the Rockers, it is just the rockers are my main friends, The other groups of Friends are the kind of people you see in Choir and Drama and doing it cause they like it not for the Easy A, even though it is an REALLY EASY A for them. And it is the same deal with them they have get togethers and Stuff like that but i never hear about it until after and they still aren't like, Oh Crap Sorry ____ I totally forgot about you. And they never even tell me about i just almost always hear about it, as i'm always listening on other people's social lives seeing as i don't have one. I've been listening in on other people's Social lives since as long as i can remember so i'm really good at it they most of the time don't even know i'm doing it. Well yall when i post again.
