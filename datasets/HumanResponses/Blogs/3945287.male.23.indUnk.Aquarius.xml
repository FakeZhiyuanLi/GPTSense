      The film opens with Vishnu Prasad(Tushar Kapoor), a clumsy character who is fluctuant due to his upbringing. His Mom is like a hitler who keeps yelling and the one who controls the wires at home!&nbsp; His Dad is too soft and is pigeon-hearted in front of his wife.  Nobody cares for Vishnu, everybody teases him and makes fun of him, worse of all no one notices that he even exists. Lets say, Vishnu Prasad is a nervous wreck with no fault of his own. Tushar Kapoor, screwed up the character, his face&nbsp;being wooden without any expressions!!!!!  Now comes Antra Mali, the sex bomb, atleast thats what she thinks she is! Vishnu is her secret admirer.  Kahani mein twist,  she has a boyfriend. That doesn't deter apna Hero to be her "secret admirer". One fine day, Vishu happens to see Mohini(Antra) in a coffee shop...He keeps ogling at her...in the process, accidentally winks at her...Mohini is dumbstruck...Mohin's boyfriend gives him gaalis and before even hitting him, apna Vishnu starts blubbering...Mohini is moved by this and keeps on telling her boyfriend that he is crying...  Dejected, by this Vishnu seeks comfort in a secluded place. There he stumbles upon this statue(Couldn't make out which statue)...Anyways, he starts talking to the statue and complaining that nobody needs him, mujhe tum gayab kyon nahin kar dete!!!!!! Very frustrated with himself, he goes home...To his horror, he finds out that he was really invisible. Nobody could see him.&nbsp; Vishnu seeks revenge with all of who had messed with him. I was scandalized because of the fact that there was no comedy scenes to be seen. Only some flying objects here and there showed the presence of Vishnu. I guess the director completely lost the story line at this point of time. Obviously confused, public were in the verge of being  GAYAB.   Then comes some hot steamy songs where Mohini does the Urmila Matondkar act, the camera zooms on&nbsp;her from top to bottom...Some relief atlast;-)  It seems the writer did not have enough ideas and material to sustain the audiences attention for 2 hrs and 18 mins!!!!  Cinematography, was decent considering the  invisibility factor ...But it was inconsistent at times...  Ram Gopal Varma production was disappointing overall...  I expected a full fledged comedy entertainer...In the end it turned out to be a big disappointment...It was&nbsp; a typical hindi mirch masala.  In the end, Vishnu becomes&nbsp; a national hero, helps the police to nab criminals and all!!! I cannot forget that dialogue delivery in the end by Mohini..."Vishnu tum sab ke hero ho"!!!!!  If you think u have some extra&nbsp;money u wanna spend and time to waste, please go and watch Vishnu Prasad..The  Invisible Man!!!!!   Gayab dekho ya na dekho, magar public zaroor gayab ho jaayegi!!!!  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      Its 8:40 pm and Iam still in the office..Doing What???? Checked my yahoo account 3 times and my Gmail account 4 times...  Was supposed to reach, one of my friends place at 7 pm....Was a hectic day....Three of my modules got tested without any errors...Thats very comforting!!  My roomie is still stuck with the stored procedures...I dont think we can make it...  10:45 Iam supposed to go for a movie at E Square!!! The plan looks slippery!! Still waiting for him...Its 8:51 now!!! It would take atleast 40 mins to reach her place!  Man!!! Muttonhead is still writing some procedures...Shucks...We will definitely miss the Pizza!!!!&nbsp;The FuryLady&nbsp;is definitely goin to murder us:-(  Time is ticking and hopefully we should get a bite of the Pizza!...Let me check if he is done..  Nopes...I guess...the party is over...( Gone to make a call)   Was supposed to call the FuryLady, and I dialled&nbsp;another number...How crummy can I get!!! Anyways spoke to her...Little jittery before I called up the FuryLady...Luckily I didnt get through...  Called up another friend of mine who was at the party...Told him, we cannot make it...That dumbo passed on the phone to the Killer lady!!!!!!!  Missed out on a useful information...The party was specially kept on a friday for both of us(Me and my roomie...Who by the way is still writing those procedures!)  She was fuming...She said she'll never talk to us!!! What an end!!! Called up my friend again(Can't get through her number, remember???) This time the dumbo did a smart thing by talking to me...  Asked him to take care of the situation...Which Iam sure he will:-) But the @#$%^&amp; ended thje call by saying, "You are missing the pizza"!!!!!!!  My roomie is totally upset about the whole thing..Actually he deserves to be thumped and jounced...  People say that hard work never killed anybody...How true it is...But it does make u miss PIZZA!!!  Its 9:27 now!
