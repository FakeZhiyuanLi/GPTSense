      Stupid fucker.  So I wake up this morning to go to practice and come downstairs to a lovely little message Jeff sent me on AIM. It basically tells me to stop putting things in my profile about him and if I want to say something to his face then I should call. It also says he's sorry things have to be this way but I've obviously made it clear that they do. Of course, he was much more eloquent than that about the whole thing.  Alright. I'm only half guilty.  Maybe the "If you don't give a damn I don't give a fuck" was somewhat directed at him.  But the "I'm sorry, I'm allergic to bullshit" I put as my away message was a quote from I,Robot, which I saw yesterday in the theater. I just thought it was funny.  And I'll probably tell him that the other message was about something else.   In fact, I have a pretty good idea of what I'll say. It goes something like this:  "Look. You need to stop thinking of yourself so highly. That stuff in my profile isn't about you. The away message was a funny quote from the movie I,Robot and the "I don't give a fuck" was about something else entirely, more as a joke than anything. Coincidentally, it just happens to fit the way things are between us. So what. I told you I was done, and I am. It isn't about you anymore. Although I don't see why you give a damn about what I say about you or how I feel. You never did before. I'm sorry if I make you look the ass that you are, but maybe it'd do you some good to think about what you've done to me. But of course you won't. Because it's all about you."  Or maybe I won't say any of it.   I probably won't even call.  I'm just so sick of this all.

      You say I only hear what I want to You say I talk so all the time so.  And I thought what I felt was simple, and I thought that I don't belong, and now that I am leaving, now I know that I did something wrong 'cause I missed you. Yeah, I missed you.  And you say I only hear what I want to: I don't listen hard, I don't pay attention to the distance that you're running or to anyone, anywhere, I don't understand if you really care, I'm only hearing negative: no, no, no (bad)  And so I, I turned the radio on, I turned the radio up and this woman was singin' my song: the lover's in love and the other's run away, the lover is cryin' 'cuz the other won't stay.  Some of us hover when we weep for the other who was dieing since the day they were born. Well, this is not that: I think that I'm throwing, but I'm thrown.  And I thought I'd live forever, but now I'm not so sure.  You try to tell me that I'm clever, but that won't take my anyhow, or anywhere with you.  You said that I was naive, And I thought that I was strong. I thought, "hey, I can leave, I can leave." Oh but now I know that I was wrong, 'cuz I missed you.  You said, "I caught you 'cause I want you and one day I'll let you go." You try to give away a keeper, or keep me 'cuz you know you're just so scared to lose. And you say, "Stay."  You say I only hear what I want to.   --Lisa Loeb "Stay"  I heard this song today while I was at Kohls and it reminded me a lot of what I've been going through. It's pretty accurate except for the part about staying. But most of the phrases are so true. Yeah...  The trip to Kohls was a success, however. I got a cute white tank with a green flower pin, a lightweight gray cardigan, and an awesome belt that's bright and colorful with little nostalgia pics on it.   I tried on some bras as well but that, as usual, was a failure. I mean, I tried on that one brand with sizes like "nearly A" and "nearly B."  I can even fit a nearly A.  How embarrassing.  On a better note, I've finally decided on all the outfits for my senior pictures. I picked out six just in case. They are as follows:  1. cute blue strapless dress with white polka dots 2. plaid pants and red halter 3. jeans and maroon polo 4. abercrombie track jacket and jeans 5. new white tank with flower pin and jean skirt 6. brown top with white lacey skirt and striped scarf  I'm pretty excited about this. A lot less stress, you know, once you have your outfits picked out.  I think I'll get back to watching the Olympic track and field trials now.

      Thunderstorm.   I started watching Fight Club (just picked up the DVD today) but the rain and thunder is so loud I can't concentrate on the movie.   I've got to stop eating. I mean, I wasn't really hungry but I just went into the kitchen and opened a bag of chips to munch on.   So I munched. And munched. By the handful, at that.   Which is bad.   Food is NOT therapy.   Hah. If there was anything good about me being depressed and shit after the whole breakup thing was that I didn't feel like eating. Every time I felt full I wanted to puke. Every time I thought about what happened my stomach would do a backflip.   With a round-off and a half twist.   So yeah, I totally dropped a few pounds and now I'm back to eating chips. All of a sudden, though, I realized I should be drinking fluids instead because of the bladder thing.   It was more like I realized I hadn't peed in a couple hours.   So the trusty water bottle is back by my side, though I'm not quite sure I will reach the 104 ounces I consumed yesterday. Ah, well, I don't need to run tomorrow so fluid intake isn't quite as important.   Oh. I got the results yesterday from the AP biology exam I took in the spring.   I scored a three...   ...out of five, that is!   I must say I was rather excited. I didn't know what the fuck I was doing on the test and I wasn't expecting to get a passing score but I guess you never know.   Who says bullshitting won't get you anywhere?   Actually, no one says that. We all know it's how we passed (or are passing) high school.   Which isn't to say one must always bullshit. My theory is, put the real effort into what you like to do, when you want to do it. Bullshit when you don't care. Bullshit when you want to save time.   Bullshit when the task at hand is bullshit.   Example. English teachers are big on the rough draft thing. You always gotta write a rough draft and do the peer editing and self editing crap before you can turn in your paper. But nine times out of ten the teacher doesn't even read what the hell you wrote. They just check 'em to see if they're done and give you 10 points credit or whatever. But writing always has to be a fucking process.   Well, I despise rough drafts. I loathe them. They are the biggest waste of time ever. So what do I do? I bullshit them. You can, too. Here's how:   1. Write in cursive. Sloppily.  2. Skip lines.  3. Use wide-ruled paper.  4. Make sure you have five paragraphs no matter what.  5. If you feel ambitious, write a great intro so the teacher thinks the rest of the paper is great.  6. If it's a research paper, include long direct quotes.   It's easy. Then you usually have another week or so to write your real paper. I mean, you aren't going to turn in the bullshit draft as the final one. No way. You're going to write a fucking awesome paper and get a 97% on it, but you don't have to deal with the bullshit of a rough draft. Because it's the real paper that's important. You put your heart and soul into that shit.   Rant. Rant. Rant.   What was I talking about anyway?   Oh yeah, AP bio. In short, I didn't take time to study for the exam but bullshitted the essays and was lucky on the multiple choice and I got a three. Ta da.   This means at State I can waive three biological science entry classes--BS110, BS111, and BS111L and start at a higher level.   You know, I was thinking. Here I am and I'm smart. I got a 29 on the ACT, not to mention a 35 on the English part which is in the 99th percentile. I got a three on the AP bio exam so I can skip frosh classes in college. Then I was thinking, not only am I smart, but I'm athletic. I've been all-city, all-conference, all-regional and all-state in both cross country and track. I can run in the low 19:00s for a 5k. And then I was thinking, not only and I smart, athletic, but I'm artistic, too. I've won first place at student expo three years in a row for drawing, ceramics, and painting, respectfully. So here I am and I got all this talent and brains and ability and yet, I lost the one thing that made me truly happy.   Sigh.   I know my life shouldn't revolve around something so fleeting, but I guess it was just that important to me. He was important to me. Being in love made everything different. It was new and special and I don't know. And I wonder if I'm destined to have everything everyone wants but not the one the thing everyone has that I want. &nbsp; Blah blah blah. &nbsp; Excuse the self-pity. &nbsp; I just wonder if I've lost it all for good. &nbsp;

      Well I did it.  I told Jeff I don't want to do this friendship  thing anymore. That I can't. That I am so angry, so hurt, it's impossible for this to work.  I told him goodbye.  But goddamn all I feel right now is like crying. I can't bring back all of the anger I felt before. I can't find that jealous little pang in my heart when I'd see him with Kara. I just feel miserable.  It was just like a film. I half expected to turn around and see Steven Spielberg and a camera rolling over my shoulder. We had it down to an art, really: standing at the doorway, looking into each other's eyes for the last time, one final kiss on the forehead, the fateful "goodbye," walking away, turning around for one last glance...  I guess everything still feels like the movies.  Just not the good kind anymore.  I know I had to do it or else I'll never heal. But every day there's going to be something I want to share with him, and everyday I will miss him. And I guess I wish one day he'll call me up and say, "Jen, I can't live without you" but the chances of that are slim. He doesn't need me anymore and he's always been so much better at this kind of thing. He'll move on.  I'm scared I may never see him again.  I had to do this partly because I was sick of being the one who called, the one who said "hey, let's hang out." It was so hard because I feel he never made the effort for this friendship that I did. I was the consolation prize when Kara was busy, the backup when he needed something to do. So I walked away.  I don't know if he'll ever really miss me. He's good at finding distractions to prevent thinking.  I know I'll live.   I made a vow to stop denying how I feel, however. Whether it's right or wrong there's just one thing I wish circumstances would have permitted me to say to Jeff yesterday:  I love you.

      I had just an awful run today. I was shooting for five miles but by the time I reached Minges three and a half was looking good. I forced myself to make it through four but it was the worst run I've had this whole summer. No joke. It was one of those utterly-exhausted-feet-dragging-if-I-have-to-go-up-one-more-hill-I'm-going-to-die runs where you seriously don't think you're going to make it.  I blame the antibiotics.  Which pisses me off to no end because I have to take those damn pills for ten days and the Riverfront Run is in nine. If I'm going to feel like I did today there's no way in hell I'm going to run that race. I'd rather not collapse on the course or even worse run an embarrassingly slow time.   So it can be said I came home from practice rather grumpy. And then, while I sat at the computer, angrily sipping red Gatorade, Clarissa IMs me out of the blue.  "Hey. I have a question."  I'm like ok, go for it. And you'll never guess what she asks me.  She invites me to go with her to Chicago next week to the Art Institute.  Yes, the Art Institute of Chicago. That museum in Ferris Bueller's Day Off. The one with all the famous paintings. The one she told me about last year when she went and the one I've wanted to go to forever.   Oh my God.  My mood does a complete turn around. All of a sudden I'm smiling and my heart is light and I just can't stop thanking her enough for inviting me and for thinking of me and I feel great. It was a crazy coincidence because I was in such a bad mood before and this opportunity came at the perfect moment. I mean, to a lot of people this wouldn't be a big deal (it's just a museum) but to me a trip to the AIC is exactly what I need.  Times like these make me think the big guy in the sky is looking out for us after all.

      I went to the doctor today for what I assumed was a bladder infection or UTI or whatever they call them in the business. They gave me antibiotics and pills to numb my bladder so I can pee without pain. Hah. It's rather interesting because the bladder-numbing stuff makes my urine a bright orange color, like macaroni and cheese.  It's exactly the same color as my Nalgene water bottle.  So I slept a lot today and sulked around the house because even though my body feels fine having an infection gives one the perfect excuse to mope about. No one gets on you about it because they assume you feel like shit and if they do say anything you simply reply, "Shut up. I have an infection."  It works 95% of the time.  This is all great for me because if I didn't have an inflamed bladder or bacteria in my urethrea there's no way I could go around feeling sorry for myself or being pissed off at the world.  It's not like I don't have a good reason to do so. I do.  But "my ex-boyfriend is a stupid bastard who doesn't give a fucking damn about my feelings or being my friend like he said he would and while he's off in Candyland with his new girl after a post-break-up period of less than three weeks I am seriously considering cutting off his dick while he sleeps and tossing it out the window of a moving car" won't really cut it with the female Nazis of the household who insist I just "get over it."  I suppose I can handle a little burning while I piss just to get some peace when I'm unhappy.  I didn't run today, but it's alright. I'll make up the five miles tomorrow when everyone else plays frisbee.  Although, such an aggressive game would provide the perfect opportunity to smash in Kara's pretty face or kick her in the shins.  Did I just say that?  Did I mention Jeff's new girl is my fucking teammate?  Anyway. Maybe tomorrow during my run I will be able to enjoy the sound of the wind in the trees or the solitary pounding of my Mizunos on pavement instead of Lindsay's incessant chatter in my ear. I love the girl to death but she talks so much and out of courtesy at least I feel like I should respond to what she says.  It's called conversation or something.  Dad's about to come home with burgers for dinner so at least I can indulge in some greasy cow intestine, although after watching Compassion Over Killing's documentary on farm animal cruelty, vegetarianism is looking more appealing than ever.
