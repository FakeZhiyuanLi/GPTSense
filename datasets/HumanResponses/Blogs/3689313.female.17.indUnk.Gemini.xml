      Ok, its half 1 in the morning, and i am so unbelievably bored, so I tot id make a post here, i have decided to talk about ma mates.  Now, i have had many different friends throughout my life, but i could never really call one a *true* friend. They all started turning into bitches and so stuck up and i realllly do hate ppl like that, they began to think that they are better and above me and my other mates, which always pissed us off, its happened to this one girl recently, shes really pathetic, but i wont go into it now anyway. My school friends are really sweet and i do have a laugh with them and all, but do ya ever think that like something may be missing there?? like there mad and all, but i couldnt talk to them about anything, infact, i cant actually talk to anyone about anything, which is one freakin shame! lol I did have a friend for years called sarah, and we NEVER fought! we were so close, then she moved away, then moved outta the country! then one day she moved back abd visited me by surprise! that was when i was 13, and she has moved again, but stilll in Dublin, she doesnt have the same phone number and i dont have her addy, only she knows where i live, so its really upto her to track me down! lol  well, since i joined a michael jackson fanclub ive gotten to know sooooo many new ppl, its unbelievable. Its nearly my one year anniversary since i joined, yayyyy! lol The first friend i made was  Emma , she is just mad. She is sooo sweet, and i have seen her twice,one of the times she has been to see me in ireland for 5 days, she lives in Bristol and hes 25, the age gap makes absoulutly NO difference in our friendship, and she really has been a great friend to me in the last year, she was just the first friend i made off the MB,shes a great friend, but shame she lives so far away. But we always txt, email  and msn, we talk so much crap, yayyy its so much fun!!! lol   Donna : Now theres one cool girl. I met her off MJNI aswell, shes 15 and she lives in Dublin, i was shocked to find out that there was a girl around my age living in Dublin that actually loves Michael like i do, i was so like, wooooooo! lol We exchanged numbers and we are ALWAYS txtin crap to eachother!! lol and we actually do have loads in common, we seem to have the same taste in films and yummy actors, like Johnny depp!!! mmmmmmmmmmmm Donna is so mad, and she is actually a really good friend of mine, we dont go to the same school or anythin, and we live like, hmmmmmm kinda a bit away, like it would have to be by car, but weve met up in a town a good few times, and shes just lovely. In the last year, i have began to realise the importance of friendship, i think its important that everyone has friends, friends that they share something in common with. I mean, i love my school friends but none of them like love Michael like i do at ALL, but i do have a lot in Common with emma and donna, so if yas are reading this, I LUV YAS!! xxxx I just hope theres no hidden dark evil stuck up sides to u both!! lmao  also off the MB, hmmmm.....ok theres so many cool ppl off there!!
