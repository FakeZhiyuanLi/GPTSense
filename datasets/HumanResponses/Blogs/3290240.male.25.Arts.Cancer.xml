      When one thinks to much about the past, does he think he can alter his present?  Lately I have found myself thinking about the past a lot and wondering what could have been.....pondering the thoughts of what if!        Today I cleaned up the rest of the apt and then just relaxed and cooked myself dinner...Hamburger Helper..hehehe....I'm good at that....then I just relaxed and chatted with friends.  I have a shoot for Nissan Commercial tommorow..just background work again, but hey its experience...so I'm off now...till then I bid thee farewell!

      Okay so today begins my new embarkment into life and new embarkment on a place to put all that is in my head.  I do remember that this is an online journal so nothing that will incrimidate me or ruin me in the future.  Anyways, today I was supposed to go do some background work on the set of the remake of "Stepford Wives" with Nicole Kidman, Matthew Broderick, Bette Midler, Faith Hill, and many other great starts, however, after waking up at four thirty am and getting ready to go, I can't find my keys...well I couldnt leave without my keys so I had to cancel the shoot with me.  HOwever, that is okay because I'm filming a commercial for Nissan, background work as well, you have to pay your dues as an actor to get to the big stuff...unless your lucky and just happen to be at the right place at the right time.  So then Monday I'm possibly filming background work for "Curb your Enthusiasm" not sure yet, but I do start my new job at GREYLINE on Tuesday...I'm psyched about that.  I will get to stay in class and finally make money again and stop stressing, because that is a bitch when you have to worry about this and that.....continueing on with my day I cleaned up the kitchen and organized some things and started my Baked Potatoe a night thing....to add calories.  Not sure what the plan is for tommorow will find out when I wake up tommorow....so n ow I"m just listeining to ENIGMA and enjoying the relaxation mood.  So I guess I will write more in time......

      Today was a productive day...work was boring as usual...how many people in the world really love their job..hmmmm...not me...I mean I don't hate it but it does get boring....so moving on....    TOnight Jen and I went to see "Fiddler on the Roof" with ALfred Molina...now I have to admit I was really not caring about goign to see this show, because 1. I heard it sucked and 2.  It bored me when I was a kid to watch it on tape.  However I was in the show and it was fun to do and my character was crazy..not half as crazy as the actor that portrayed "Motel" in the show...so we sit down and the stage is great with trees on the set and lighting used to be the inside and outside of the house...it was great setting...then the first number "Tradition"  one word...AMAZING...the dancing was jaw dropping and fun..the singing not half bad.  However that enjoyment was interuppted by the "blood curling scream" from right in front of me.  Seems one of the little girls sitting in front got caught up in the FOLDING chairs and was screaming for like a good three minutes...that was only the beginning of this clan that ceased to get on my every last nerve...so the show continues and the kids continue...I mean who the hell brings their entire family to a show that isnt for kids..this I would expect from "Lion King" but not "Fiddler"  however they paid $100 a seat and I kid you not there were like ten of them in the group..so their $1000 trumps my COMP ticket from  my friend SHELL.  Oh but yes it continues...so the show is going on and of course the actress that plays "Hodel" is freaking amazing...I really loved her voice, she reminds me of the actress who plays Nessa Rose in "Wicked" another amazing show....SO half way through the show of amazing dance and song numbers this lady next to me who I dubbed Jewish Bitching Lady...start singing the songs like she is freaking the star of the show...now normally I wouldnt mind but with the kids and her bitchign before the show and then singing I was about to freaking croak or make her croak..but of course I had my Jen next to me to keep me calm and she was doing a great job...now granted half the cast was like 5 foot, I could have easily done "Motel"...but another time for another day....right...one day!...so I saw Rick too he was on a date...some first date huh...so anyways then Jen and I leave and we go to COLONY where i have to say they totally RIP YOU OFF do not buy CDS there unless they are like karaoke or professional broadways because you can get cds cheaper at like BEST BUY..but what ever right....what is an extra 5 bucks....so Jen got her book then we headed home where the temp like dropped and got so cold...I talked to my smurf and called it a night...anyways moral of the story.....    "If you go to a Broadway show...DONT SING..that is why they get paid $1375 a week so they can sing NOT YOU..and DONT TAKE YOUR FREAKING KIDS IF THEY CANT BEHAVE....other than that...enjoy it!"

      So today was a slow and productive day at work...I basically started the short file project which is taking all the files from Chicago and putting them into the New York files...LOADS OF FUN let me tell you...DisneyWorld doesn't even compare.....    Then off to class where I did my scenes with J.D. and Marilyn which both were powerhouses, but I was soo exhausted afterwards I tell you this actors that do this serious major crazy drama daily must be on something....Anyways not much of a day nothing really interesting happpend so that is it now leave me the hell alone...

      So today was a good day...by most of the Americans it was Presidents Day!  However for me, the average actor in New York City..it was just a day off of work...I spent it sleeping in, then watching some tube, then cleaning up and then going to class....Today began my move over into the new class (Monday and Wednesday)  It was a mind blowing class and I really look forward to seeing where we are going to go with things.    My smurf spent his days in the urban jungle in his office working on a case load today, bet that was loads of fun, with minor interuptions by me of course:O)      SO on the way home on the subway I was coming down the steps and I saw this homeless lady and it brought a tear to my eye, she asked if I had a sandwhich to give her and I said I didnt have one unfortunately and she just stood there hunched over, she looked really sad and I just got this notion of her all alone by herself.  You know most of these homeless people are people who were released when Guilianni released them from the Mental Institutions...point being shortly after I sat down to wait  for the ever slow W train I smelled smoke and something was burning...the sandwich lady had started a fire in the middle of the subway....I mean what possessed her to do this..because she couldn't get a sandwhich or maybe she was cold.  No one will know because sadly she is not all there!      Then on the train I'm talking with Heidi and who should I see but Sharon a girl I was in a show with back in July, so of course we did the phone exchange and will we hang out who knows but it was a nice meeting....well on that note it was a great day...

      So today begins the crazinesss into my mad mad world. SO today I woke up with a special someone next to my side and it was pure bliss, however that bliss was ended by having to shower to be on the train by 9AM. Yes you heard me 9AM on a Sunday after V-Day. So the train just sat there, like it does on most Sundays and the doors were open with the freezing cold coming in because clearly they didn't see there were people inside becoming human popsickles. Finally after thawing we are on our way into the city for it is not almost 10AM and my call time for the theatre is 10AM. I rush through Grand Central to rush to the 1 and 9 uptown and guess what? IT decides it wants to take its lovely time, so now the time is 10:10AM and we are running late...sooo needless to say I walk into the theatre at exactly 10:20AM, I was 20 minutes late because of the wonderful NYC subway system.     Now back to my night last night! D.W. came over at about eight and looked so adoreable in his cute jeans and cute sweater, and his new haircut. We immediately had to hug and kiss because I haven't seen him in a full week and was just wanting to hold him. Then of course we did the whole Valentines thing, I had the room all set up with his stuff on the bed, the bed is literally on the floor so its hard to miss the stuff..he didn't see the stuff...anyways we exchanged our stuff and it was abso adoreable..we spent like an hour trying to order Italian, because every resteraunt was booked and well we didn't have reservations...what is it about ordering take out in Ditmars area of Astoria...I mean he spent like an HOUR trying to find something and needless to say we failed, failed miserably so CHINESE it was again...we are getting used to the CHINESE thing...one good thing about CHINESE is they have sooo much that they give you! LEFTOVERS! So now the time is about 10ish and its getting late..I have an early day on Sunday...and it was a LONG Saturday...I said goodbye to my car which I fought to keep in the city, but after so many tickets, snow, ice, and wear and tear it was time to send her back to Texas so she can graze in the pastures...then of course boarded the train into the city and obviously this was the idea of everyone in God's Creation because they all boarded the 11:57 AM train from Rahway, NJ to NYC, PENN STATION. I stood the entire time, no ticket was ever picked up and this stupid, stinky, annoying and rude person shoved the door in my face...it was an unpleasant trip so I was breathing in the fresh air after getting off the train because that ladies breath about killed me. So I cleaned, got my haircut and prepared for the smurf. Hmmm..I'm all out of cronological order but hey that is another reason its my MAD MAD WORLD. I'm reminded by Shakespeare "Thou this be madness, let there be method in it" from Hamlet...tragic play! So we slept and slept till awoken at four from my wonderful Monique wishing me a happy Valentines it was great....the rest my friends is for the depths of my mind...I can't share all my thoughts with ya....so today's thought....     "Stupid people need to brush their teeth"     OH I HAVE TO GO SEE THIS AMAZING DANCE TROUP....its named after COW DUNG FUNGI! Pilopodus, very interesting!

      WOW another spin on the roller coaster..man I tell you I must love roller coasters because I never get the hell off of them!  Those of you that know me know what I'm talking about and those that dont well tough for you!    So DW and I got into YET another minor dispute today...I explained I was a little dissapointed that he wasnt going to go to Fatty's party with me and of course he took this as a way to run so he feels all good about himself and makes sure it wasnt him when in reality it is..he has major issues he needs to solve or this is going to continue being a pattern..however I'm off this roller coaster...it was fun at times, but to many dangerous corners and high altitudes for my taste..moving onto a new ride..maybe...I will try the log ride, that always seems to go slow and boring...or better yet just leave the amuzement park.  This guy is walking out of the amuzement park gate and watching as the iron bars slam SHUT!    Does this mean I didnt love DW..no not at all quiet the contrary I loved him very much...we had a connection I could never explain and when we were together it was amazing but things just always went downhill, they would peak amazingly then WHAM and WHOOSH to the next part of the track.    Well that all happened in the early afternoon of my Friday the Friday that is my buddy's party....so I will finish up here at work go home and straighten up the house CUZ IT NEEDS IT!  Then relax and dress and head into the city to party with Fatty...I will turn this really sad day into a fun day...who knows maybe I will dance with some chickadees....

      So todays commute sucked...I mean I was stuck on the train for 1 1/2 hours due to conjestion...If I heard that "We apologize for the unavoidable delay" one more time I was going to scream but thankfully it finally stopped saying that to start saying "Due to conjestion we are delayed" so a little diversity is always nice...    Last night was basically a not feel well needs to get better night..I didnt go to class due to my stomach hurting so I figured what the hell and just relaxed at home and try to feel better.  Nothing really was on TV but "Smallville" rerun which was really good and one I hadnt seen and of course "American Idol" which is just an addictive show period..I think its ran by SATAN!  Naturally the girl I didnt like was sent home.  Then I just basically chatted with my mom and friends and relaxed until my tummy felt better, which it really didnt feel to much better by morning.     DW got in around tenish then him and I chatted for a bit and then I basically called it a night.  Then of course my commute from hell delayed me getting to work due "to the unavoidable delay" and I leave the office today to begin my dental work WHOO HOO...OH and I am trying out this new voice teacher he actually has been on Broadway so maybe he will actually know something about how I should perform and sell the song to be believable who the hell knows...I spent so much money trying to pursue my career what is another hundred dollars...    ON that note I'm really looking forward to going to Texas for a MUCH needed get away, the snow and cold here has officially gotten on my last nerve so now its time for warmth and soothing and mom said I can drive the little truck around while I"m down there so I'm not afoot...hehehe..WHOOO HOOOO!!!!!  Well that is all..DW and I are doing great and we are having a very relaxing kick back weekend so I'm looking forward to that and he says we are going to cook...Me cook...OH YEAH I did last night too it was actually nummy!  Well that is all for now...!    "We apologize for the unavoidable delay, there is a train ahead of us causing conjestion"

      So yeah, I can't sleep!  Such is life in a world of my thoughts.  I was laying there with a million stupid and pointless things going through my head, what color to paint my room, is it goign to be cold in the morning..what are some new plays I can read....in the end I said screw it and decided to write in my blog.    DW spent the weekend and made this awful weekend so better...why awful you ask?  Ask MTA!  They made our weekend a mad house....but I finally saw "FInding Nemo" such a freaking cute movie and then just slept to wake up for the journey into the city for my show.  IT wasn't that busy today, guess the weather was to nice.  Then came home and watched "School of Rock" another cute movie.  DW left early this morning and gave me a kiss goodbye leaving me all warm in my bed with wonderful thoughts.      So today I go to the dentist for a cleaning WHOO HOOO got to love those!  Then work all day then class, can we guess who will crash the minute he hits the bed tonight?  ME!  Exactly!  Well that is about all for now, more exciteing news when i'm more alert....damn wish I could sleep!    "Counting sheep is such BS, it doesnt work...I tried"

      So life has a way to just like slap us in the face and say "wake up!"    So after the show yesterday I went and hung out with the cast and Kimberly's father and we were all talking about our passions and what we want with our lives.  It made me realize I know what I want...I want to act/sing/model!  I love doing that its just a great thing to do in my heart.  So no matter what I'm going to do everything in my power to make that happen, submit to agencies, just get out there....    Bad news though, during the show I think during one of the moves I did I pulled my back muscle because it hurts like HELL!  The pain of being an actor!      So the Oscars came and went with a shocking win for Sean Penn, he deserved it though, but I was shocked they actually gave it to him.  Lord of the rings of course swept it.      SO nothing really to bad, no one really annoyed me this weekend, of course I'm keeping a more optimistic look on life so that I dont get annoyed...as easy.      JD and my scene is coming along well in class and Marilyn's and mine i'm sure is going to be just as great....Monique got an agent which just shows me we can do it...oh and the cooles is little Abby Fender has gone on to succeed she now has a CD out and working to get around the country circuit..which is amazing.....dont know what is up with Matt but I did see he did an episode of "Undressed" on MTV..so who knows....    Oh and Adam has been invited to screen test for this new drama for FOX so that is pretty exciting...      "There is a kiss at the end of the rainbow"  ~A Mighty Wind~

      Okay so I'm writing in this today because last night I didnt get to bed till around 3am....but it was worth it...I got to spend time with my Lizzy..I love her so much...    So beginning with my day...get to work and work is just that, work!  Nothing excited and nothing dull, just, well just!    So class was freaking amazing....I probably got angrier than I have ever been in my entire life...I was so angry my body was tingling....The scenario...well we were doing improv scenes and this talented actor named David was my father...well my mother commited suicide and he and I had been estranged..he comes to the door with a secret...turns out he had been sleepign with my wife and that is why my mother killed herself...WOW...INTENSE!  Lizzy played this crazy woman who killed her bestfriend...and the rest of the class was just amazing...they are all developing their skill and craft its amazing to watch!    After class Lizzy and I hung out and went to watch "13 Going on 30" what a cute freaking movie that is all I'm goign to say, CUTE CUTE CUTE!  I just long for a love like that one day....I know I know...it will happen..blah blah blah...but well it was just touching.  Then I said goodnight to LIzzy and boarded the train....which took its time to come...got home, checked email and then crashed....    Like I said it was a great day but nothing crazy and unusual...

But this isn't as bad as it sounds. It's just that you may have missed something in your original thinking, and it's much better to have to deal with this now than in a few weeks. Remember, it's not over yet. No matter what has recently changed, it will probably change once more before the universe writes it in stone.

      Lets start todays entry with the subway...so I have been getting in trouble for being late so I start getting up and leaving my house in plenty of time to get to work by 9am right...WRONG...FATE SUCKS IN MY FAVOR!  So we are at 36th Ave and the conductor is like all discharge this train is out of service..so naturally that delays then I have to be pushed together like sardines in a can on all the freaking trains..it was hot and stinky and UGH I just hated it....so other than that I get to work only 10 minutes late which wasnt bad, but still..    Now moving on to more pressing matters..D.W.  UGH..I truly disslike him now, I hope I never run into him because I didnt get to say my final peace so lets just hope FATE IS IN HIS FAVOR!    Class was sooo good last night...M.C. was like doing mock interviews and stuff it was so much fun and educational as to how to act and what to say...its so hard but part of acting is sellign yourself without looking like your selling yourself..it just sucks!  Lizzy wasn't there and i missed her but oh well...    Count down less than one month before I head home for a visit....that will be fun and can't wait to see mom and my friends...well that is about all for now...oh yes I GOT SO SOAKED last night...that part totally was not cute...TTFN!    "Ladies and Gentlemen, please get off the train this train is out of service"  MTA for ya!

      So today was the second to last performance of my show...it has been an amazing and hard and fun run..but all good things must come to end.  So in the audience today we had the head casting lady from Nickelodean which was totally great, but of course nothing came from it but it was still cool for her to be there..the kids are always so great, can't wait till I have one of my own and my mother will be soo happy....!    I spent the weekend not doing much..I had decided I was going to give D.W. another chance but quickly found out that just wasn't going to happen...note to self...follow your instincts..my instincts told me he was a liar and flake and they were right...turns out he lied about being off a certain website and I caught him on there...I was going to continue a friendship with him but I have decided against that..he is poison in my life and I have to rid my life of him....so BYE BYE D.W.    Then on Saturday I just cleaned and sorted laundry to prepare for LAUNDRY day today which was UGH...I hate laundry...and no t.v. so not much to do...however..I chatted with some of my good friends and one wasnt having a good weekend...why is it when you want to cheer someone up you just can't?  Go figure!  So then lets see what eles...OH YES..today I got a rug someone was throwing it out and I took it YAY so I got a rug for my room and its a cute rug and the colors I like a little gay but then again so am I....so not much else..a quiet and good weekend...talk soon..nothing funny today!

      SO with the changing of the tempatures and the changing of the seasons comes a changing of the life.    SO we finally did our SHOWCASE which went amazingly...I have to say Matt is one amazing director..and the scenes were done really well.  I think some people in our class get a little more praise then they should but that is okay we all grow with time and I suppose I will grow out of thinking that.    SO at work they brought in a new temp to work with us..at first I was a little threatened thinking to myself..is he taking my job?  But then they requested him his own desk and computer and my fears were put aside...I do need to stop being late a lot though...its just NYC is so damn hard to get around first thing in the morning.      I finally get to go to Texas I'm so excited getting to see my friends and family...mostly MOM!  I miss her so much and my darling little niece....LB.  SO that happens in May which i'm thrilled about...and can not wait.  BUt before then I have to close "Dolphin up a tree" and "happy flower..."  It was a great cast and I enjoyed working with them...but all good things must come to an end.  Other than that not a lot but will keep you posted....till then...

      Today is the final day I will spend in Texas.   Mom and I left early Monday morning to head to Dallas....she was going to see DS and I was going to meet AP...AP had amazing news for me he had fallen madly head over heels in love with this cute guy he couldnt wait for me to meet.  R is what we call him for now.  So I was exhausted and slept on the way to Dallas...I felt bad that I didnt visit with mom but I was out of it....so we got to the VA and ugh what a dreary place...DS has this uncontrollable crying spell and then just talks like nothing happened it was weird.  AP finally showed up and we left...I gave my mom hugs and love and left.    AP and I were in his boyfriend's little bitty car...a bug...now they are cute...but small....we went to Chick fil et to get him a bite and then headed to his place to change and get some clothes for him.  We were goin to be staying at R's place.  SO we headed to R's place....this place was amazing..it looked like something that belonged in NEW YORK not DALLAS...such a beautiful building and R's apartment was very cute..with the cutest doggie...Milo..he was sooo adoreable and instantly became my best friend.  Now AP and I had gotten a few things at the store including AP got R some roses and I got AP a can of pineapple slices just to be funny...R was this cute little guy and incredibly sweet which I could see why they fell madly in love with eachother..I'm so happy for the both of them.  We ate dinner and just hung out...we were all tired so the night was called young at about 8PM..I know I know...but what can you do..I finally fell asleep around 10PM....  I woke up very early the next morning to catch my flight...went like a breeze...boarded the plane...the first was packed, the second not so much....they had a tv to watch so time flew...ATA is my  new airline too..I loved them.  Got home, carrying the luggage was a pain in my ass, but I made it home okay....   "Mid pleasures and palaces though we may roam,  Be it ever so humble, there's no place like home."

      So the remainder of my trip I'm goign to add in just this one entry.  Wednesday was a good day I just hung around the house and got stuff done and relaxed and did laundry and stuff...I mean this was my vacation so it's supposed to be enjoyable.  The next two days I just basically relaxed and visited with friends and so forth...I didnt get to see my niece because she got into a fight with family and well it just didnt work out.  ON Friday...I left the house to go to RM's...he had initially had a little party planned for me, but due to lack of time and stuff on his side..he didnt have it.  Which was okay..I finally arrived later that evening...and RM looked pooped...he had cooked me my favorite dinner, Meatloaf and Mashed Potatoes...and surprised me with a German Chocolate Cake he had made for me...it was so touching.  RM and I and W all just hung out and relaxed Friday night and then decided to be fun and all go into the same chat room and mess with the queens of East Texas...that was a lot of fun...we all crashed sometime around two, actually RM crashed at like 11PM...such an old man...hehehe love you RM!  I had a great time hanging out with them...on Saturday..we went to see "The Day After Tommorow" for dig this....4 DOLLARS A PIECE...can you believe that it was unbelievable to me...however the theatre was sooo small and crowded with rejects from "Jerry Springer"  we just hung out again after that and had "Sonic" and then RM worked on my laptop all freakign night...it amazes me the things he can do...I flirted with W and RM all night..of course completely harmless...but I do love RM..he fixed my laptop...after accessing the DMA which in turn caused it to mess up and keep hanging upon booting...but leave it to him, he fixed that to and once again my laptop is happy and fixed....the thing that amazed me was I had 372 viruses...OUCH!  We finally crashed around 3AM, which sucked because I had to be up early to head home...promised mom I would be home by lunch time...so I said my goodbyes to RM and W holding back the tears...I had some good years with RM....and truly do miss him, but as buds not lovers...and loaded up my stuff and drove home.    I drove up to the house and was blown away there were like six cars in the driveway...so I was wondering what this was all about...and I walked in and surprise...its a surprise birthday party for me...my mother had gathered my family for a surprise birthday barbecue and it was amazing...I had such a wonderful time seeing all my family, some I havent seen in six or seven years...a wonderful ending to my wonderful trip.  I got this awesome clock that was a train from LA to NY it was cute and just had such a good time....then I had promised TK I would come back for a quick visit to get my chat transcript he had given me as a gift and say bye in person.  So I headed over there in the storm that was heading our way...I got there and it was good to see him again...now one thing about TK he has this way about him that just is very magnetic and attractive...he is a cutie and he had cut his hair so he looked even more cute...and he wasn't on anything so it made him very appealing and well we had our final "goodbye" in an amazign way to say goodbye till I see you again.  As I left..in the middle of the road...my truck's third gear just vanished and I almost wrecked until I realized that I could switch into fourth...so I did shaking the way till it hit the power it wanted....I made it home okay and visited with Jason and his girlfriend for a bit then settled into my room to pack up and get ready, my Texas trip was coming to an end.....

      So today I woke up late after staying up all night to fix my mother's computert..she woke up very early because DS was heading to Dalls to start his rehabilitation in a VA Hospital and she had to get to work earlier than usual since she was goign to be gone on Wed.  I finally was able to get up out of bed, I just was so comfortable in my mommy's house that I just couldnt see myself leaving it.  Anyways I got up and got my stuff done, laundry, shower, eat, check email, watch some of my soaps and mother asked me to bring some stuff to her.  Now today was the day I was to hang out with TK, everytime I tried to get there my mother would call me, "Joshy can you do this for me?"  Well finally I got up to moms shop and my Aunt fed me some of her homecooked meal she brought and mom had me check the oil and gas and power steering fluid...a mothers job is never done protecting her son.:O)  After all that it was late in the afternoon...now I wanted to spend time with TK but time just didn't allow me to spend a lot of time.  Then he called to tell me he was going to go get a haircut...so we were not going to be seeing eachother afterall..I was frustrated by this.....but he cancelled his appointment and I headed his way.    When I got to his apartment...FINALLY!  He greeted me at the door and looked so much better than he did on Sunday...guess the two days of sleep did him good and his apartment looked like that..I do have to admit he is sooo much shorter in person than I thought...I mean he told me he was short..but its just Maude and Claude it was cute.  So we sat down and watched "The Simpsons" and just talked and hung out.....it was a lot of fun and I was finally glad to meet him...we also ended up in a fun position which I enjoyed...umm..hanging in him I mean out that is...:O)  I left around sixish because I promised mom I would be home for supper...and had some stuff to do with her...so I went home and just ate dinner and relaxed....it was a good day...oh yes...Fantasia and Diana sang on Idol for the finale....which airs on Wednesday!

      How can one express the love for his mother....?    RM and I woke up and got dressed and lounged a bit before heading into town..about the time him and TK and I were getting ready to leave a mexican guy comes up and inquires about my KIKI (My old car).  Now here is the irony...RM has been trying to sell her since I sent her back home to graze in the green grass...the first day that I'm there she sells.  So RM sold her for 5k, so we decided with the luck we have we would wreck her so we go in RM's car to Tyler to meet my mom and DS for lunch.  We arrive at this building and RM looks at it and says Joshy the only thing I see is this nursing home, and about that time this old man with a cane comes out of it, but it turns out that is the place we ate.."Traditions"  a fancified "LUBYS"  it was amazing food though..so GOOD!  It was sooo good to see mom and DS was looking pretty rough...but that is okay he is getting better now...so we eat dinner and then RM has to say goodbye because of the final negotiations for the car.  He leaves and we leave, UGH..Mother takes us to like five different places to find DS some velcro shoes since he can't tie them....finally we were not successful but I got a cute pair of sandals and some new AIRWALKS...we finally go home and just relax..I'm still very tired...we hang out and I work on her computer and DS and her watch some T.V.  it was just great to be home.....then mom and I watched our show together and decided to call it a night...I had an early day and so did she...that night I slept so secure and safe....amazing a mother can do that for ya!

       SIX FLAGS RULES..ESPECIALLY WITH HOT FRIENDS   We woke up early on Sunday..being B, W, and I..and took a shower and "made" the bed the way the bed should be "made."  It was a lot of fun and then we decided we wanted to have more fun so we loaded up in the car and headed to "SIX FLAGS"  It was great there was not a lot of people there and we had the chance to ride a lot of rides...it was a fun day but then of course B and W got upset with eachother so we had to get them to be happy again and headed to Kilgore to see RM.  I love RM and have missed him like crazy so naturally it was good to see him.  I got there and showered and dressed and got ready to go to the club.  Now I know I wasn't missing anything by going to that place....but it was like a flashback to the past for me...I ran into people I haven't talked to in ages....and some I didn't care to talk to...I finally met TK for the first time and he was running on like no sleep so he looked a bit rough and I was upset because I thought he had been partying hard before I came, but in reality I should have just been happy..he came out to that pathetic place just so he could meet me which was very sweet now that I think about it, but more about him later....So RM and W place looks great...and I met their kitty..Sally the little diva that she is...and then we watched the pathetic drag show if that is what you want to call it, played a little pool...GW showed up too..he got a bit drunk but that is okay...he loves dancing that I forgot.  I also ran into HH, and met her girlfriend and just tons of people that I knew...it was wild and crazy....so we left the club when it closed and I was ready to leave WAY before that and went back to RM's and W's house and relaxed and just talked and there was drama going on there too, but nothing to big..it was like Queer As Folk Texas Edition....well finally around I think 4am I called it a night and went to bed ALONE...which is how I wanted it and slept like a baby......

       I said it once and I will say it again...Day One of my trip   I got to the airport around eleven, because it always seems I get misstaken for a terrorist and they make me strip before I get on a plane....not this time.  I get to security and go through with a breeze...now its eleven-thirty and I'm tired.  We board the plane no problem..I had a good window seat on the right side by the wing...my favorite...going great.  The guy that is going to be seated next to me gets on..okay I dont mind peddlers but when they are stuck with you on a plane for two hours, yeah then it changes.  He annoyed me to no ends..but then enter the child...this brat gets on the plane and guess where he sits?  RIGHT BEHIND ME and he starts kicking the seat...ARGH....so I'm like its okay its only a two hour flight...enter the pilot..."We want to thank you for flying Airtran, I have some good news and bad news...the good news is its a beautiful day...the bad news is we have been grounded..."  WHAT!!!!!!!!!  I didnt know what that meant but i'm assuming that was the bad news...so it turns out....grounded is when there is something preventing the airplane from taking off the runway....there would be an update in an hour....Okay!  I have a guy next to me trying to sell me shitty copies of movies and a child kicking my seat, this was becoming a nightmare from hell....soooo....FINALLY almost two hours later we take off and I'm livid....well due to heavey airtrafic we ended up circling in the sky for two hours....FINALLY we land.  Now I had a connecting flight to catch to get to Dallas, but it turns out that I missed that....so they booked me on the next flight..it was at 9PM...9PM!!!  It was only five....I missed my connecting flight because some jack ass couldnt fly us in...it wasnt my fault....well....I talked to a few friends and got into a fight with one of my friends, but we worked it out...it was great....in the end...I upgraded to first class and met the most amazing lady on the plane we talked the entire time...CT had been through a lot of stuff in her life like I had and I just felt so connected to her and dig this...she had my mothers birthday....we are definitly keeping in touch.  Well I finally landed in Dallas to be picked up by W and BM...both of them came over to me while I was waiting for my luggage and we left the airport and went to a hotel...well we got to the hotel room and decided we were hungry so we BEGGED a PAPA JOHNS guy for pizza and he agreed but then we got lost so it was FUNNY AS HELL!  We ended up finding the place and went back to the hotel room...and just layed down and decided to call it a night...I had a LOOOONG DAY!

      Today was a tres interesting day....lets begin with the morning.  I get to work and well I work.  Then I go home and I fall asleep on the subway...I have to say I LOVE THAT...getting on the subway and just picking out my spot and just laying my head against the wall and listening to my music and just crashing.  I usually only nap for about thirty minutes and wake up usually when we hit the sun again after coming out from the tunnels.  New York City is one very interesting city with the people you wake up next to...very diverse.    So I get home and I should do laundry but I think to myself "NAH" I will do it on Thursday or Friday...which I probably won't do it then either I will probably just carry it to my moms and do it there....so only three days left till I get to go to Texas for a visit....I was really excited but not so much anymore..not sure why...probably the stress of seeing everyone and making everyone happy and stuff you know how it goes!  Anyways so I relax on my bed and watch "The Simpsons" that show still gets me laughing all the time and then "American Idol"...Diana DeGarmo did an amazign job on her final song, but I still think Fantasia might take it, who knows and honestly who cares?  So then I just flicked through the channels and chatted a bit then called it a night and said NITE NITE.....That is about it....I didnt mention this before but...  Dean had a stroke last Friday and he is in the hospital, mom said he is doing better, so that is a good thing...karma is a bit** huh?

      Okay so this morning I called to use my voucher that I was given becaues my pants that I had just bought were ruined by some idiot putting gum on the seat and the people not cleaning it up and the agent tells me you have to book using it 3 months prior to your departure....THREE MONTHS!!!!  I was so upset, so regardless now it looks like I will be paying for a trip home where I thought I would not be...UGH FREAKING UGH!  So last night was very uneventful...I went home and watched my shows and that is about it...not really a lot..OH I went grocery shopping WHOO HOOO!  At least I have food again....  A few thoughts on what is going on in the world.  First and foremost..PRISON PHOTOS  Okay so photos are now being given to the military....they are of a group of selected soliders abusing, physically assaulting and forcing iraqis prisoners to do lewd acts and calling this a form of "Interoggation".  Naturally this has the world in an uproar....okay so its one thing to do this right, but why the hell would you TAKE PICTURES AND VIDEOS of this...Its appaling in the first place that you would be such lowlifes to treat people like this...what are we goign back in time to the days of concentration camps?  I'm outraged by this.  Well turns out a lot of people are including the Iraqis militant groups for the Al Queida, yes they retaliated by decapitating an american that was over there trying to help set up sattelites.  Nick Berg was killed brutally after he was forced to say who he was and his family.  This in turn has outraged us, its just an unending game of ping pong.  I will keep you updated on the results of this travesty!  Now on a little more light news....AMERICAN IDOL.  The girl who most people loved was ousted this week...Latoya London who has a powerful voice and friendly personality was ousted this week by the American Voters.  That show has just become a big joke to me...I will probably NOT be watching it next season...I only catch it now when there is nothing else on.....

        Okay so last night I went to see Little Shop of Horrors with LV and JD....it was at first annoying because I wanted it done like the movie and well it clearly was not done like the movie.  But first things first lets not jump the gun.  I met CH at The Carriage House in Chelsea on 18th Street between 7th and 8th Avenues.  It was this cute little place where they have flowers muraled on the wall and really stylish decor.  CH ordered me a cosmo and he had a glass of white wine, I was a little hungry so I ordered CALAMARI...now..CALAMARI isnt so bad except when it looks like CALAMARI and for those of you that don't know..that's SQUID.  CH cut it up for me so it didn't look like squid but still it was already in my head it was.  Well we just talked and stuff...I have to say I get so nervous like a schoolboy with a crush when I'm around him its crazy!  Anyways I picked up the tab on this one and we kissed goodbye at the subway...as I headed to meet LV. Now one thing about LV is she is NEVER late for a Broadway show and she gets upset if someone makes her late, well my train stalled so I was five minutes behind.  Anyways I met her and JD in time and we took a few pictures and headed into our seats.  AMAZING SEATS!  We were DEAD CENTER 11th ROW it was sooo awesome, I could see everything great.      So the girls come out..eh..was my first impression, their notes were sung higher and at first the mics were a bit messed up and you couldnt hear them that well, but as time got on all I can say is DANG THEM GIRLS CAN SING!  I grew to LOVE them.  And the new adaptation was cute.  Hunter came on and at first his high speaking and high singing annoyed me but I grew to love his character too, he has amazing comedic timing and can work the audience and not a bad little dancer.  Mushnik, well....eh!  The guy that did all the characters and Orin the dentist was just very very talented....and the costume changes WOW..his voice was very rent-esque.  Then we have Audrey.  Now I loved Kerry Butler as Penny in "Hairspray"  but I did not like her take on Audrey in this show...however....with that being said she rectified herself with her singing....just amazing!  So over all the show was VERY ENJOYABLE and I had a GREAT time..so the show started early and let out early.  SO I figured I would give CH a call before I get on the subway to go home since it would be later by the time I got to Queens.      I ended up going to CH's for the night and we watched South Park and Looney Tunes, that man just makes me feel something unbelievable.  Anyways we went to bed and woke u p this morning for work.  He went off to his seminar and I went off to work at my work.  However I just don't know this area that well yet so I walked the entire way in the wrong direction...I went toward the Brooklyn Bridge instead of the Staten Island Ferry....oh well I got here with plenty of time to spare...it was such a wonderful ending to such a wonderful night!

      This weekend was amazing...lets start with Friday....so on Friday I went out with a really interesting guy, for now he is CH....We met at LeZinc for drinks and the minute I walked into the glass doors of the place after being 25 minutes late I locked on this very good looking guy at the end of the bar.  His greenish blue eyes very noticable.  He was just so dashing.  So we had drinks he had a Bloody Mary and I had a glass of White Wine, then our date was cut short because he had to go to a prior engagement with a friend.  We gave eachother a hug and kiss on the corner and he went on his way.  I, a little tipsy, boarded the N to head home and change, because we wanted to see eachother again.      Now if I was as annoying as the highschool choir trips that visit the city I apologize now.  I luckily got on the car with all the teenage girls, saying "no he didnt" "yes she did" it was annoying but see fate has this little game with me so fate said "Hmm lets see how we can drive Josh insane today?  OH I KNOW...I WILL MAKE A SIGNAL MALFUNCTION so he is stuck on a train for 1 hour and 45 minutes", not exagerating.  However my tipsy ass mixed with the wonderful day I was having didnt phase me so I got home changed and went back into the city to meet CH.      When I stepped off the train I was staring dead center at WTC, that was a revelation, and shock didnt realize that was where I was.  SO Finally after being lost lost lost I met CH at La Halles this cute French Bistro and had a glass of saucay and he was having dirty martinis.  ANyways the night was amazing and just continued untill Saturday.      THen I boarded a train to see my sister and nieces and nephew.  The kids are getting beautiful everyday.  Gabriella was singing the songs from the show I was in and ANgelica is just growing up so mature, Cameron is becoming a teenager, he got accepted to Military School so he is thrilled about that.  CHeryl is great, a little stressed with the kids, she can't wait for when she can go get pampered.  SOON I kept telling her....saw BIG FISH sooo touching, then headed home.  What a wonderful weekend.    CH is now a little under the weather so I am hoping he feels better soon.  Other than that not a lot....more soon!      "Oh no she didnt?"  "Oh yes she did!"

Dating life is still well, its just that I think I know what I want, but then I don't, its kind of confusing you know...oh well I'm just going to stick to my guns till I get that overwhelming urge to just jump you know, but nothing like that yet....well that is basically my day, kind of boring huh...oh well....

      So last night wasn't much of a night..I went home and cleaned my room and did the dishes...and listened to songs and played music.      I was trying to decide what new headshot to use, since my other one is too modelesque..oh well....then of course I had to watch some of my play I was in..those other actors are just freaking hillarious on stage..really talented....    Jen then came home and we watched the conclusion to 10.5 which was so good, I was very impressed...it was like Armegedon meets Titanic meets Independance Day...it was a good movie...That was really all I did..not much of a day huh..hehehe...well       "We are not in charge of ourselves, we are just a life living in a much larger and higher thing"  10.5

       urlLink        What do you do when your put in a room with about 18 of your co-workers for nine hours and told to get along?  Well you do exactly what we did, got along...yesterday was this bonding ceremony if you will.  Now I didn't really feel comfortable at first because, well I'm a temp and temp's are not usually supposed to go to these things, so for the first few hours I was missplaced, it felt like, but shortly as the day went on and did it ever, ON AND ON AND ON...time seemed to stand still at times...I loosened up!  It started with us solving scenarios and playing games and doing things together, AL was of course the comedian he always is and made the day so much more enjoyable...then of course like all good things, it must come to and end...parting can be such sweet sorrow, in this case Bonding!  So then I get on the PATH and I'm literally ready to call it a night, but a las I am going to dance my ass off at  urlLink Mama Mia , so I am falling asleep on the PATH when I wake up I'm staring at debris and stuff, it was a wakeup call, we were in the heart of WTC which of course is an empty grave, it just felt so weird!  Even walking through the new terminal it all felt so (wrong) in a way if you will...so after leaving that to get on the E train I head to 42nd to meet my friend MS and my other half JS for dinner at  urlLink Ruby Foo's  the food there is amazing and GOOD!  So we chatted and MS and JS got to know eachother a bit and then it was off to Mama Mia, so we sit down and of course in the theatre are always interesting people, and the lady to my right was just that a southern belle...a guy sneezed and I said "Bless You" and she was like "yes dear bless you over there, and not here" and then she said "and kids I can't stand them either, keep them far away from me" but it was all so charming and sweet that it was funny!  Then the show began...a beautiful show I recommend it and FUN!  Then I boarded the subway to head home and have a heart to heart with JS and then fell asleep...a pretty cool day if I don't say so myself!   urlLink       Mamma mia, here I go again My my, how can I resist you?  Mamma mia, does it show again?  My my, just how much I’ve missed you Yes, I’ve been brokenhearted Blue since the day we parted Why, why did I ever let you go?  Mamma mia, now I really know, My my, I could never let you go.  Abba

       urlLink       With the celebration of all the little gay bois, and their transgendered mothers, also comes another celebration...MY BIRTHDAY!  What a birthday it was!  So yes I was born on June 27, 1979, from that day forward it was written in the stars that I was to be a gay boy...that day in New York just ten years prior some brave ass drag queens busted some heads because they were tired of being picked on, so Stonewall began our celebration.    Now...I rarely end up in the gay parade but, well lets start this weekend in the order of events...Friday Night...I left work, sort of in a tizzy, but hey its my birthday so I got over it quick...I met JS on the train at our regular stop, which is 14th Street and he joined me, we went to the apartment, where honestly I was EXHAUSTED and dig this is started to STORM, not just rain but STORM!  We get off the subway and boom its raining cat's and dog's, so naturally we both didn't have an umbrella, so we go downstairs to get a cab, not a freaking cab in sight...and everyone is fighting for one, so I see one across the street so I put up my hands to cross and this freaking bit** almost hit me, he literally sped up and then honked his horn at me and by the time I get to the other side NO CAB some moron took it!  So finally after about twenty five minutes of hailing a cab, we get one and get home...I was just pissed and startled that person tried to hit me....So we get to the apartment and just basically chill...I'm exhausted so I of course fall asleep in my Snoopy's arms, then awoken around eightish to meet a potential roommie, Special K, a recommendation from my bud AL at work...which of course was a great recommendation because after ten minutes of chatting with him, he had the apt...of course the whole having something white on his face and being soaking wet helped...it was a gay mans fantasy...but I saw him more like a little brother...so that is what sealed the deal...and JS really liked him to and we saw this as a good family for the next year...so after Special K left we decided we were both very tired so JS and I called it a night and retired....  Saturday Morning or should I say Saturday Afternoon...I slept till about early afternoon, which was so enjoyable and then of course JS had to go and get ready for our birthday celebration that night and I had to get ready...I looked very cute I must say...so I left to get on the train and of course it was going slow...I arrived at Cafe Torino, which was a GREAT place, the food, the drinks, the service...Jen and Adam were sitting at the bar having a drink, they went to the zoo all day...I should do that sometime...sooo anyways...then I met up with LV outside and she has this cute balloon bouquet for the table...and she looked so cute in her little hippie shirt and her librarian glasses...so we sit down and her friends S and S show up and join us...it was an enjoyable dinner and I run into Shi there...and finally meet her other half which was GREAT...then we just chatted for a bit and left to go to TRUST this really trendy club in the meat packing district...where we meet D and C for a drink...we hang out for a bit then S joins JS and I and we go upstairs to the private dance floor...we hung out there for a bit then head over to ESCULEITA where LV had gotten us a table for the drag show, I felt like a star it was soo cool, they put VIP's on our wrist and we just had a great time for the show...it was such a blast..then JS and I said our goodbyes and headed home in a cab...it was 5:30AM!  We slept!   Sunday Morning...yes this time morning...major hang-over...waking up next to my Snoopy again, what an amazing feeling, then I got up and got dressed...I had an audition at 3:30PM for "...is beautiful" which was such a fun experience, the director was soo sweet and it was nice to get to cold read with AS...then I decided to have dinner with my Snoopy at my favorite Thai resteraunt "Wild Ginger" but I completely forgot that it was right in the heart of the gay pride parade...which now brings me to accidentally participating with the parade....so JS and I have our dinner which frustrated me at first because the waiter ignored me for twenty minutes...anyways after dinner we try to get to the subway but soooo many people..we run into JR and then he runs into D some guy he used to date, then we finally wiggle our way through the mass of men, half dressed and some completely dressed, touching, and poking, and groping, a typical gay day...hehehe...we finally get home to relax and do just that.....I finally crashed around 11PM...the perfect ending to a wonderful weekend...a weekend I will NEVER forget....WELCOME 25!   No matter how old you are, there's always something good to look forward to. Lynn Johnston

      Imagine a world where a person is not judged by the color of their skin, gender, sexuality, religion, status in life, health, physical appearance, education, a world where no one hurts the other.  Yeah, exactly...how can you imagine such a thing when it is not even capable of happening.  We live in a decade where yes, we have come a long way from where we started when Colombus stepped foot on this foreign land in 1492, but yet there is still so far to go.   urlLink       urlLink ">The Normal Heart     When will I be able to walk down the street no matter where I am holding my boyfriend's hand and not get looks of disgust or distaste, or an interracial couple getting snickers because of jealousy or disgust.  Why is it that our president wants to put an amendment into the constitution that says marriage is a sanction between a man and a woman?  That same president also sent our young soliders over to a country to fight for a cause that is such bullshi* and did nothing but piss of the Iraquis more, which should say something for his character.    All this came flooding to me like a damn breaking last night while I sat in the audience of The Public Theatre watching, what I believe is truly a masterpiece by Larry Kramer, urlLink ">The Normal Heart  Its main character, Ned, unable to find true love all his life, searchign for acceptance and "love" in the bathhouses of New York City in the 70's and 80's, finally finds love with Felix.  The story then goes on about the semi autobiographical life of the playwright.  How he formed the Gay Mens Health Crisis and got his voice heard in America.  How the president of the time, yes this is the president that just died recently, the beloved Reagan, the one that everyone wants to commemorate for such an amazing job, turned his head at what was happening.  Not until they realized that the AIDS crisis was more serious than the HOMOSEXUAL population did anything get done...this play tackles that and the love and heart of one mans stand against it, with the help of his friends.  Acted the sh*t out of by Raul Esparza, who literally ripped everyone a new a** in the second act.  He was joined by an amazing cast who was completely on the entire thing, it was moving, breathtaking, heart wrenching, devestating, and hit home all in the three hours that I sat glued to what was going on, wiping the tears from what was happening up until their final curtain bow...the play ends with the most heartwrenching sound, and as the lights came up I was out of my seat immediately, this cast not only deserved a standing ovation they deserved our heart.  They gave us all they had and it was great to recieve.  So after I left the theatre pondering all this in my head, I saw the significance and similarity between the jews and the aids crisis, everyone just stood by as the jews went to their deaths, persecuted, and killed for being DIFFERENT...the homosexuals, the trans gendered, the jew lovers, all died for that reason...the aids crisis, millions have now died from this disease, and for years people just stood by and watched them drop off and go to their deaths, just like the holocaust camps.  This play hit home more for me, because recently I was told by friends that they had caught the HIV virus...now I know medicine is so much better and people can live with this, but at what cost, how many HAD to die before this happened and yet there still is NO F**KING cure...they dont even know what caused it to appear...was it the military using it to kill off population, or did a guy sleep with a dog that was bit by a monkey, or was it implanted by aliens when they invaded us during the pyramid times, yes it all sounds far fetched, but why is their no cure?  Why can some not contract it?...Why for some is it just one simple misstake?  Yes this play has me steaming more and more and then of course it brought up the thought about gay marriage....who the hell does the congress and the president think they are telling us we can not commit in gods eyes to the one we love and want to spend the rest of our life with...what are they going to tell us next?  What kind of underwear to wear, briefs or boxers?  So I think you will do yourself an inservice if you DONT GO SEE THIS PLAY or at least read it and just because I feel they desearve it...I'm putting the credits...GO SEE IT!   The total number of Americans infected with HIV is estimated to be 900,000 to one million for 2002; and the number of infected has been rising in recent years by about 25,000 annually (40,000 new HIV infections every year, but, since the advent of potent anti-AIDS drugs, only 15,000 deaths due to AIDS annually----40,000 minus 15,000 equals 25,000)----but still no cure!!!!!

       urlLink       Okay so this morning I get on the train and I'm heading to work and there sitting next to me is a guy reading "Harry POtter" with white earphones on, which means he has an IPOD and drinking a Starbucks, now is it me or this only something you would see in New York City?  He looked like he was ready for a day in the East Village.  It just amazes me at how different we really are in the city and yet so not so different.  Okay enough about that, so class was intense as always again, I did a cold reading, MC thinks it is time for us to get the cold readings down because that is what most auditions for camera use now a days and we are learning two basic monologues for our repetoire, now I dont know if you have picked out monologues before, but its some hard shi*  I mean seriously...finding the right one for you is a quest in itself, its like searching for the Holy Grail and only coming up with IKEA!  However, after thumbing through nine million plays, and monologue books, and my library, I came up with four pieces from shows.  "The Importance of being Earnest" "A woman of no importance" "Sub-urbia" "The Normal Heart" so now that they are chosen it is time to start the work on them.  This guy I work with who has become a friend AS is actually in the process of writing a show that I plan to audition for and I have to say it sounds really fuc**** amazing, I mean it just sounds bizarre yet intense yet, crazy...which of course we all know I love.  So on the dating front...JS and I are doing well, I mean we have our moments where we doubt and stuff, but that all gets better with time and as long as we can work through it then that is all that matters...he started work today at Mandarin Oriental Hotel, this hot little hotel in the Colombus Circle area...so I can't wait to hear how his day is going...and tonight I'm going with LV and J to see "The Normal Heart" which MS said its a play you can not afford to miss, so I'm not!    So on the work front, things are GREAT!  I absolutely love working with the crazy group that I work for...its unique when you find out that people are so much more interesting than the jobs they hold...take AL for example, if you look at the guy you would never know that within his eyes lies a talented writer, creative thinker, and make you piss in your pants comedian...then there is MR who would know that behind that blonde hair and sweet eyes lies a little she devil...who is freaking talented as hell when it comes to layouts of things, like creating a  yearbook for her son's team and her devotion as a mother is freaking amazing...reminds me of my mom...always there supporting her son no matter what...then there is AS who is just as funny, which is probably what connects all of us in a way is our humor, but also a very talented guy, you can tell by the way he "Plays" around with me at work that he is a talented actor and well I dont know about the writing but I am intrigued by his imagination...then there is JP...who is a buisnessman that likes to have fun, and can't keep from breaking electronics, did you ever see TOY STORY?  Remember that kid that kills toys and it was like HELL for the toys, yeah that is what its like for JP's electronics...its just a diverse group and interesting group here at Fitch!  If it weren't for these guys this job would be just another job, thanks guys!

      Once in our life, we always find ourselves stopping and thinking..."What if?"  This is the main reason I'm in New York City.  I don't want to wake up when I'm thirty and be like "what if?"    I have fought my very hardest to stay in this city and do what I love and that is act, my acting has grown, as has my voice.  Ever since finding MC's class I have learned what I have to offer to the acting world.  But the struggles get so hard and then you hear of people around you getting stuff all the time...it just makes it even harder for you.  Saying to yourself...you can do this, don't give up.  Even though your barely getting by, its all worth it because your doing what you love, right?  Sometimes that little voice just isn't loud enough and sometimes I feel it isn't worth it, I'm not going anywhere with it...but then I just have to kick myself in the ass and say STOP IT!  So new goals for the summer are to hopefully get on a better sleeping and eating habit, by summers end I want to put on 20 pounds, I want to join a gym and work out at least 2 or 3 days a week, get new headshots, and when fall comes around bust my ass getting out there and auditioning and working and making it happen.    So life is good, I have met a great guy, JS is just amazing the way he is..he totally amazes me each and every day...last night I cooked dinner for us, after we got caught out in the rain...hehehe it was cute, I, of course let him have the umbrella and carry the bread...I also got a haircut yesterday and I fell asleep around 9:30pm last night...so it was a refreshing night and it didnt get to hot last night...I woke up next to JS which I have to say its soo amazing to wake up next to someone so amazing....okay okay so I'm smitten...but if you knew him you wouldn't blame me...     To achieve the impossible dream, try going to sleep. Joan Klempner

       urlLink         ODE TO MY CUBICLE  June 16th, 2004 By Mary-Ellen Rozak  Here I sit within my box. No window can I see. No wind can I hear. Up above the traffic is my tranquil world. Outside weather and life happen.  But I am unaware in my box.  Summer may bring a clap of thunder, but never loud enough to be sure. Snow is too silent. I may enter the box with a clean sidewalk below and exit with it being six inches deep. But I cannot tell from my box.  Fall drops leaves that are 28 stories below me.  I cannot see or hear them. Spring brings warmth that cannot be felt through the controlled air system.  Windows do not open.  No fresh air enters. If you spot an insect, think of this, it must have ridden the elevator too!  My only salvation is the radio. If the world has a crisis, they may break in and tell me, If they deem it more important then the latest Matchbox 20 song. Otherwise I am forced to assume all is well outside my box.  Eight hours a day, five days a week. I only get three weeks vacation. Why do I let life pass me by like this?  What keeps me here?  Is it the benefits? Do they outweigh the harm I encounter with each passing moment?  I have seven square feet of space. I face one corner most days. Glued to the screen. It is my only outlet to the world.    Intense heat in my apartment last night....I mean it got so hot that I thought I was going to melt into the sheet.  Now mind you it was only 70 something outside it was like 88 in my room, and this was with the fan on....JS was sleeping next to me and I swear he was dying from thirst because of the intense heat.  Now I know heat rises, but last night was ridiculous.   SO yes today is Wednesday, which means I have Monday and Tuesday to talk about... So Monday JS and I had lunch together, we went to Ranch 1 for lunch and he looked so handsome in his beige shirt and his cute red sneakers, and his goattee was growing in nicely...anyways then we went to Battery City Park for a little stroll but it was quick since my lunch was almost over, but it was so romantic, I love spending time with him...I just feel like the world is alright and its just him and I, and I don't care what people think about us, its a great feeling.....soooo then he walked me to the building and we kissed goodbye....That night was class and it was so much fun we did a reading of Glen English's "SEX LIVES OF WAITERS", which is a brilliantly written play...and the class did an amazing cold reading of it.  Then after class we had an answer session and then we decided since we were getting new carpet, that we would paint the room first.  So we all grabbed a brush and painted the room, it was a lot of fun...and in the end looked great....then it was time to head home...zzzzzzzzzzzz  Tuesday....Today was just a shitty day for the most part till evening...I mean it started out crappy, continued being crappy, till I just rearranged my cubicle and realized this is stupid I dont need to be in a bad mood...things are good...so I went and had lunch with JP and AS, Burgerking...YUMMMY!  Then came back to finish up my little redecorating....then went out to Williamsburg to meet JS, now I have to say I loved that neighborhood, totally the vibe I want and will create, just got to get a little bit more of a body...which is good I am gaining a bit of weight, just got to keep at it....anyways went to JS's place which is this really cute place, with cute hardwood floors and JS's room is cute, reminds me of a college dorm..it was neat..and met one of his roommie's Colin who is an actor as well.  Then JS and I headed out to my place, now mind you I was really really really tired so we just lounged at the apartment, ordered Chinese food and basically called it a night...ended the night with a triple bang and crashed around midnight.  I got to wake up to JS, which was a great sight....    A painting is never finished. It simply stops in interesting places.  - Paul Gardener

      SO in the eye of the moment and the whirl of the wind, time changes and life does too.  So I began interviewing for a new roommie, I never thought it would bring into my life an amazing person.  JS came over on Thursday evening and walked up the steps.  My heart about leaped out of my chest, or was it my something else about leaped out of something else...regardless the guy was SOOOO handsome and then he spoke...soo sexy...we shook hands and he came in to interview for the roommie position.  He met JR and they hit it off famously...we then decided to go for a walk for Italian Ice' which JR just loves, she is always wanting to go get one...now I know why...YUMMMy...then we went back to the apartment and just hung out.  JS and I played "Who wants to be a millionaire" and watched my soaps and just hung out talking and stuff till early hour of the morn.  Needless to say there goes that roommie potential...I really liked him....super sweet!  Flash forward to Friday....I decide that after "Aida" which I have to say wasn't what it used to be but still very enjoyable...dont know what I think of Will Chase as Radames...but Deborah Cox and Lisa Brescia are amazing and Eric Summers....not Mickey Dolanz..he needs to just go....ugh....I tremble when he sings....So MS and I went to Ruby Foos and had Dim Sum and Filet Mignon and amazing chocolate cake...it was a yummy dinner then to the theatre for the show....after the show Marky and I said our goodbyes and I got to the subway where I ran into BF who is doing really well and looking really good...we rode to the 30 Ave stop where he went home and I went to my place...JS came over and we hung out for the evening and watched a DVD...and just hung out it was such a blast...it was late though so we talked for a bit and then FINALLY we kissed....Okay I know this is cliche..but FIREWORKS were nothing compared to what I felt...it was amazing...however...the good boy I am we fell asleep just holding eachother...I woke up to an amazing guy looking at me Saturday afternoon...now I don't know if it was the weather, being so hot or what not but we stayed in bed almost all of Saturday...then we finally decided to get up and go to the park..so we take the bus down to the park and just lay there in eachothers arms under the bridge with the hot sun glaring down on us...and just talked and layed there..it was like no one was around but us...an amazing feeling...we then went back to the apartment and ate some food from KFC that I had left over from when we went there first before the park.  Then JR and AN and JS and I decided to play some board games..so we played Disney Sorry...hehehe...JR kicked our ass to the curb..then TRIVIAL PURSUIT..now the person that created this game obviously was a looser with no life and never got laid because those questions are just STUPID...so we nixed that and pulled out the computer games...YOU DONT KNOW JACK anyone..hehehe....M kicked my ass badly...and then of course WHO WANTS TO BE A MILLIONAIRE...we still can't get past 32K...oh well...JS just stood by and watched us...now being he has only be in NY for 3 years...and Ecuador the other 24 years, he didnt know to many of the answers..but it was so cute he just sat there and hung out and enjoyed the time with us...we then settled down to "Sword in the Stone" so many movies I"m going to have to teach him about....we fell asleep in eachothers arms and were together.....Wake up on Sunday at 1pm and just spent the day together...I cooked dinner for us..it turned out sooo not what I expected but it was still good...the day continued to wind down and I sang some songs from "Aida" while he listened and it just kept getting more and more amazing...I was going to have to go to bed soon and he was goign to have to go home..but it was definitly the beginning of something soo wonderful....just wait for the next chapter....

       urlLink       urlLink        Sadly one of the nations greatest presidents according to the news, that is, is being laid to rest today.  What a bunch of BS!  Reagan who I will admit did some great things for the country, when he wasn't playing blind to the things that were going on in front of his eyes, in his own country, died a sad death from Alzheimers which is a very sad way to go.

      Today with the aligning of the planets being all screwy..caused me to be in the weirdest mood.  It first began with me waking up...I didn't want to get up..now that isnt the odd part, the odd part is I got up but went and sat on the couch..instead of shower....it continued when I got out of the shower I walked to my room nude...which I NEVER do..then got dressed....my hair looked like shi* and grabbed my keys, phone, metrocard, building card, and headphones and headed out the door.  Now the strange day continued because I walked on a different path to the train today.  Granted I was also very tired...now it just starts to get sad.  I am getting ready to get on the 5 express train to go to work when this lady directly in front of me goes down and I mean down..right on my foot...turns out she missed the step and fell between the platform and the train...she was so scared the train was going to leave with her there...I held up my hands (here it pays to be tall) and waved the conductor down not to go anywhere...we were able to get her leg out and she got on the train like nothing happened...another strange thing.  My mood just continued to be odd all day...and I find out Venus is having its total eclipse this week which just oddly enough affects me.  Now continuing on with the weird day...AL didnt show up for work, which already depressed me and then my mood just continued I wasn't hungry...I was just BLAHHHH!  The day went by pretty fast though...before I knew it, it was time for acting class...the mood just lifted..I was still very tired but not in a weird mood anymore....I got to class and it was like I was washed clean...  Acting class was soo intense...I guess the sun and Venus were still affecting some...a few people who usually have amazing nights were off....I allowed more to come through and be true to my feelings this time which in turn gave me a wonderful feeling..MC talked alot about doing true and allowing what you have to be enough...and TRUSTING yourself...said we have the notes now just have to allow them to show.  Don't be scared of it....LV didnt show up...turns out she had a really really bad day...so I just went home and the night got weird again...the train was weird...it was a completely ethnic train ride...and then I got home and my ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY was just sitting on the stairs...that pissed me off and then the winner of the weird night...my buddy M is going out with another friend of mine on a date tonight...B.  So it just continued....oh well...this morning I woke up and no weirdness..just tiredness.....more later!

      So last night were the Tony's and history was made and some shocking results as well.  Avenue Q took home the award for best musical beating out Wicked which I thought was sure to win.  However it does deserve the award it is innovative and unique....Wicked did take best actress in a musical though for Idina's portryal of Elpheba the wicked witch.  Rashad took home the award making her first african american to win best actress in a play.  Overall it was a good night!    Of course Harry Potter ranked the box office king..bringing in 92 million dollars, which I'm going to see tonight, hopefully after class.....also it was just a lazy weekend for me, very enjoyable....   ciao for now!

       urlLink      urlLink          Okay who wouldn't enjoy a night of leather, rain, ass kicking, and a good tub of popcorn, well in my case Nacho's, because popcorn smells like ass.  Yes this is how I spent my Friday evening, with my papi and my buddy MS and walking across the bridge by the WTC, which is still just very creepy.  The rain began to fall and I began to get a bit wet, but alas I was dry...Papi arrived a little later than planned so we nixed the dinner plans and jumped straight into the bondage film, that is CATWOMAN.  Okay so my review of the movie was this...IT was cute for what it was, but justified by Halle in a HOT LEATHER OUTFIT and the way she shook that money maker was to die for...it was cute...two stars out of five.  Then we said our goodbyes to my buddy MS and me and Papi headed home...the train delayed a bit which ended up putting me and him in the soaking rain.  We got SOAKED from head to toe, which SUCKED!!!  This only added to me not getting better....we went to bed and woke up on Saturday...Saturday we chilled with GP and had drinks and SUSHI which I actually liked, only the California Rolls though, and just hung out till bed time.   Sunday I journeyed on the bus to my sis's to visit with my nephew and family as they were preparing to leave for a month and my nephew was goign off to military academy...he is thrilled...then I journeyed home to watch tv with papi and stopped by to say HI to GP and then called it a night....The rain really must stop!  Also I wish my chest would stop feeling like some sumo wrestler is sitting on it.....  So if you were paying attention there was no mention about sex even though it was in my title..well you smart poppettes...use your imagination!:OP  It's just human. We all have the jungle inside of us. We all have wants and needs and desires, strange as they may seem. If you stop to think about it, we're all pretty creative, cooking up all these fantasies. it's like a kind of poetry.

       urlLink      urlLink       Nothing like an evening of Bacardi and Fuses.  If you have no idea, read on!    So the day was boring as usual in my concrete prison above the Battery Park area in my 8 X 8 cubicle. Then a Uryguayian knight came to my rescue...okay so it wasn't a night but he did come to my rescue by offering JS a place to crash for the next two nights due to my roommie feeling dissplaced.  So JS and I went to AS's for the evening and just hung out and drank this YUMMY drink, which is Bacardi Silver Raz, which is my new favorite drink.  So there we were three little pigs drinking Raz and O and just chatting and AS's was showing us his work and stuff it was fun, we were having a good time, when we decided "Hey lets do some karaoke..now my voice still sucks right now due to that nasty little bug I had, but hey what the hell, right"  AS does a mean CHER...IF I COULD TURN BACK TIME...and me who just sounded like Fiona Apple on crack and sandpaper....then we were getting ready to call it a night when they convinced me to just stay the night...so we were about to get ready for bed when it happened....EVERYTHING WENT QUIET!  AS looked around and checked the power surge and everything but nothing worked....we had blown a fuse.  Now when you have 3 air conditioners and lights and T.V.'s and Radio's going I can see how that happened...well it looked like we were going to be S.O.L when MAGICALLY AS found the fuses and all was happy in Sparkle's Land.  However upon waking up this morning I wish the damn fuse wasn't replaced it was like ANTARTICA up in that room....   "It's all fun and games till someone blows a fuse!" Joshua Carpenter

       urlLink       Thanks to EGGNOG for the PIC  Do you ever find yourself on the subway and wanting to just push the person in front of you?  For no reason but maybe, they stink, or they annoy you with their voice, or they are just to ugly to be in your prescense.  This is what was going through my head yesterday as I rode the overly crowded N train home to Queens.  I mean first of all it was a yucky and sticky and humid day in NEW YORK CITY!  I got off the train where I normally have a nice seat all the way home to meet JS at 42nd Street and well lets just say when we got back on there was no where to sit, so I had to stand.  Now I already have issues with people being around me in small circumstances and well they were just annoying me, I wanted to get off the train.  People kept pushing into me and moving me like I was a herd of cattle or something.  I just stood there with my feet planted, then finally about Queensboro Plaza a seat opened up and just as I was about to go sit down some stupid bit@# that had JUST got on at that stop took it...I looked at her with the devilish eyes and conveyed.."YOU STUPID BIT#$, nevermind I have been standing on this stinky, smelly, over crowded train since freaking 42nd Street, but you saw me going for that seat and then you sit there with your smug look well smug this and then I pull out a rubber glove and slap her across the face....yes yes this was all in my head, but would have been nice.  Needless to say just like everyday I did finally make it to my stop where I did get to sit for all of two stops, not even worth the squat, I got off and walked home with JS in my hand.  Then just to top off my already aggravated mood, some greek guy was like "damn faggots" which naturally got my blood boiling and I wanted to be like "Look baby, just because you look like you stepped off a train of uglyville and couldnt get laid if a chicken sat on you, doesn't give you the right to talk about other people, you fuc@#$ closet case."  Once again all inside of course...I have really good self control sometimes...can you imagine me in a car?  Finally I arrived to my apartment where my roommie was already pissed off at me because she feels JS has been over to much, so I had that on my chest, plus the annoying bitc# that stole my seat and the closet case outside....a typical Tuesday evening in New York!   I like long walks, especially when they are taken by people who annoy me.  Noel Coward (1899 - 1973)

       urlLink       Happiness-Enjoying, showing, or marked by pleasure, satisfaction, or joy.  So does this mean that we are embound by our own happiness?  We create the happiness within ourselves?  What makes one happy might not make the other happy?  So to one, maybe jerking off on the phone while talking to some hot chick might make him happy and to another delivering God's word to the homosexuals of America so they don't rot in hell might make another happy?  Where does this all begin and where does it all end?  Over the antagonizing weekend where I was practically speechless due to a nasty little bug in my chest, I chose to watch one of my best friends favorite movies.  Now the acting in this movie was PHENOMENAL, the subject however DISTURBING!  I won't give it away, but lets just say the movie is TWISTED!  Rent it and enjoy a fun 2 hours of craziness....HAPPINESS....  Now another story...this begins with a little boy of five years old, who had to learn the trials of life are not always fair as did the same little boy that belonged to VERONICA GUERIN this movie was touching and some of the best acting to date...however the thing that my buddy MS didnt know was that this movie was a little TOOO CLOSE for comfort...this movie begins and ends with a shocking and realistic enviroment...based on a true story..check it out...  Other than that JS and I moved some of his stuff into the apt and I got a hair up my butt and ripped up the nasty vinyl to expose hardwood floors, YAY!  I got an apt with hardwood floors...and of course we can't forget the ultimate of the weekend...I did some SPIDERMAN stuff...the neighbors below us locked their keys into their apt so they asked if they could us our fire escape...I said yes but of course their window was locked so the one on the left the top part had enough where I could acrobatically put myself through and I did and got in to open their door...then of course they made me and JR and JS cookies...YUMMY!  Other than that an uneventful weekend...oh yes met the downstairs neighbors and the guy across the hall all cool people...its GAY MELROSE PLACE!   Eleanor Roosevelt Courage is more exhilarating than fear and in the long run it is easier. We do not have to become heroes over night. Just a step at a time, meeting each thing that comes up, seeing it is not as dreadful as it appeared, discovering we have the strength to stare it down.

       urlLink        Remember when you were a child and you would wake up early on Saturday mornings just to run to the living room in your footed pajamas, and jump on the couch just to watch those  urlLink caring bears  save the world from sadness, anger, and hate?  Rainbow bright teach her friends the value of sharing, He-Man battle Skeletor, Thundercats to the rescue, Punky have another missmatched outfit, and my most favorite the little blue guys in the mushroom houses.  What happened?  Cartoons sure have changed since the days when I was a kid, we had cute and cuddly and fun and things that taught lessons, now we have fighting and angry and realistic, reality shows taking Saturday Morning Cartoons away...if it weren't for the Cartoon Network and Disney Channel, cartoons we know would be dead.  What stirred all this up in me you ask?  I was reading an article this morning about a four year old, who stabbed a ten year old because he wouldn't let him play with his whiffle ball...a fourteen year old killed three people on a ranch...and then I remembered the other day I was watching television because we were off work early for the fourth weekend and there was this cartoon, it was so violent and angry...I actually got saddened and longed for DUCKTALES to come on, I longed for TAILSPIN, if you look at the people my age and the kids that are growing up there is a big difference in us.  My nephew will be leaving in August to join an air force academy for teens, is this what our country is coming to, preparing us all for the inevitable cruel world that is out there, should we really kill that illusion for the kids so that they can grow up hating life and knowing the cruelties it presents?    September 11th was a huge wake up call and caused a lot of parents to have to explain a lot of reasons for things happening in the world...every day I open a paper and there is something about beheading, hell the first time I heard of beheading was when I got a game called MORTAL KOMBAT and I thought it was just stuff that happened in games and movies...sadly its gone on for centuries and began in the asian countries.  Kids are thrown into reality due to this, which in reality is making them harder to the facts.  I was thrown into reality as a kid too, but I still had the comfort of Papa Smurf, even though I had no Papa, or Baloo and Kit from TAILSPIN or Chip and Dale from Rescue Rangers, and of course the ducks from DUCKTALES...these guys kept me safe and comforted when I knew first hand that the world was full of killers and people out to hurt others and pain.  Even today I like to escape into that world, because living in reality sometimes is a little to harsh for even me.  SO the moral of my ramblings is...kick back and watch The Jetsons or Punky Brewster or even The Flinstones....and take a break from the disaster that is our world.

       urlLink        THE MIDNITE COCK ROACH   It was a hot summer night in the land of Queens.  I had just gone to bed, when I heard the scream.  "AAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH."  I immediately jumped from my cozy bed where I was so comfortable to see what had caused my roommie to shriek. I opened my door and there she was, standing on the table.  Now you ask yourself how can a little table hold up a grown woman, well I forgot to mention she is a petite girl of five foot, which is why the sight in the kitchen caused her to go up there.  "Josh, there was a bug the size of a rat in the kitchen," she screamed.  Now I have lived in NYC for three years and I have seen bugs, but I'm positive that there is no...my silence was heard all over as this enormous bug crawled to my foot and just sat there.  I couldn't run, I couldn't jump, I couldn't even scream...he just sat there at the tip of my foot.  I was barefoot so I couldnt squash him and he was litereally the size of a CAT, not RAT!  I finally mustered up the courage and kicked him away.  NOW naturally when you hit a roach across the room, what do you expect him to do?  Run away, scurry, dissapear?  Not this one he bounced himself back on his legs and walked back over to where he was and stood his place.  I kicked him again and he did the exact same thing.  I realized I was not going to get anywhere with him so I finally picked up a broom to shoe him out of the apartment, but that little bastard just stood his ground.  Now imagine me, shoeing a roach the size of a full grown cat out of the apartment with my roommie on the table in her bra and panties screaming her head of to kill it.  "I'm trying," I screamed back.  Then the most abnormal thing happened, actually it was pretty queer.  The roach jumped up and landed on my head, now I'm screaming bloody %X@)@X murder and trying to push this thing off my head, when he stopped and looked me straight in the eye and said; "Do you really think its necessary to kick me?"  WHAT!  THE THING TALKED TO ME!  "I mean seriously, couldnt you just ask me to move, why did you have to kick me?  That really pissed me off."  "You are not a welcomed guest in this apartment roach."  I was cut off and told it was MISTER ROACH, the *%@$@ bug cut me off to correct me of his name.  "Now if you want to talk this out we will get a cup of coffee and sit down and talk this out, but I was here first and then that blonde ditz moved in and then your gay ass singing all the time moved in and upset my quiet enviroment.  Did I bitch about you singing and her being a ditz, did I yell at you and kick you?  NO!  I sat in my little corner under your dishwasher and just got fatter, I need Jenny Craig now because of you two.  ALL the noise and the lights.  Before you I had to deal with thunder thighs walking all over my kids and smooshing them, then I had to deal with you running to the bathroom naked and her and her boyfriend kissy and you almost choking, but I still sat there and did nothing but eat on the dead rat that was under your stove, which you knew nothing about because you don't clean.  I tried to leave, but because you two made me eat, I'm too fat to get through the hole I came in, my wife has left me and my kids think I'm a looser.  I tried to commit suicide many times in the middle of the night when your sleeping, but NO you have to get up and turn on the lights and catch me before I go down the drain, I probably wouldnt fit anyways.  SO YOU SHUT THE HELL UP AND STOP KICKING ME!  Now where am I supposed to go, where do I live, am I to become another homeless bug on the street.  Live at the school across the road, what, tell me?"  Mister Roach was in tears by now, and I just stood there completely dumbfounded, I was just told to SHUT UP FROM A ROACH!  So I looked at my roommie and we both decided to take him down to our landlords basement and let him live there, he never comes in so the office is quiet and dark most of the time, it was a chore getting him through the door, but we finally managed.  We went back up to our apartment, feeling very proud of ourselves when we heard the loudest scream.....but at least it wasn't from our apartment anymore.  We both turned out the lights and headed to our rooms..."Good night roommie."  I said.  "Good night Josh." she said and the doors shut and we both slept very peaceful that night.

       urlLink         Our  G  a  y  Son     So Deviant has officially lived with us one week and today marks his one week anniversary. I still remember the day he moved in...he had his mattress, a few boxes, pillows, a small table, two suitcases, and this thing that looked like it just fell off the set of "College Boys".    Deviant is first of all just so adoreable, he is always smiling and in the mornings you say "good morning" to him and he growls. Its great having him in the apartment, that is when he is there. Now Deviant would definitly be a parents worst nightmare...he sometimes doesn't come home till late at night and some nights not at all. Granted I know he is a grown man, but a dad still worries. The other night Papi and I were laying in bed watching t.v. when we were wondering it was 1:30am, where is our son? Finally we gave up and went to bed, but the things that were going through my head, could he be drunk on a subway, riding back and forth from Queens to Brooklyn, or maybe he got drunk and forgot he moved and he went to his old home and was pissed because his key's didn't work...needless to say he was probably just getting laid.    Last night I get up to get something to drink and there on the counter is his bread, wide open, so I of course being the good dad I am, tie it up and put it on the shelf. We recently had problems with bugs, read THE MIDNITE ROACH story  , however they are gone for now, but we don't want them back. I have to say I really enjoy having him in the house and he is a great kid...I know I'm only like what two years older, but he is my gay son.

       urlLink        Chicken Stroganoff on a bed of Noodles    So I am attempting to cook tonight...not my regular, mac and cheese, or open up something and put in water...I"m actually going to try to cook chicken and add spices and make it taste yummy. Thanks to the wonderful Campbells Soup site, there are great recipes for people who live on the go. That would be us New Yorkers. Think about it. WE are constantly on the go. Have you ever stopped to think how much time you spend outside your apartment, which you pay an arm and leg for, yet your never there.    To much money!    When I first moved out of my house and into my own apartment, I had the cutest one bedroom in  urlLink Tyler, Texas  for $475 a month. This included use of the complex pool, laundry mat, parking, a one bedroom, living room, kitchen, bathroom and dining area. This was MY apartment, no roommates, until I was a dumbass and moved one in, just me. However the story is much different in New York City. When I got my first apartment here it was with two other roommies, in a small apartment with a nice fat $1850 price on it. I about flipped when I was told what the rent was, however, you do it. I was NEVER HOME. Even today. On Mon/Wed I'm in work all day, then class. The other days of the week, I'm on a train or in the concrete cell. I spend just two and a half hours commuting to and from work. During the nice weather I truly don't want to ride the bus, unless I"m just too tired and lazy. So I walk. New York is said to have one of the healthiest factors of people. Why? That is an easy answer..we walk everywhere we go. So back to my point. I'm constantly on the go, I'm either working, acting, or hanging out with friends, or preparing for things...ever since meeting the ultimate guy in the world..I have settled down the craziness so much..we are becoming the typical wonderful married couple..cook dinner, watch t.v. together, fall asleep...its the most wonderful feeling. I have also noticed I'm gaining weight...not much, but hey every little bit helps. So the craziness of the city still gets me in her clutches, but the amazing Latin Snoopy is pulling me out of that. However back to my rambling...why do we have to spend so damn much money on a place where we are hardly there? We spend more time at the office then we do home...shouldnt we just spend our money on our offices? OH THATS RIGHT ITS BECAUSE ITS A CUBICLE. My officle as AL calls it is decorated with pictures of friends and so forth...that way it has a familiarity to it that I love. So take a minute and just relax...trust me with what you spend on your life here, you deserve it!     "Why choose fear?" "I'm a New Yorker, fears my life!" Jonathan Larson's "Rent"

      So after being on a break for two weeks, classes resumed last night. I had to perform my monologues for critique and information on how to fix them and make them better...then we did mock interviews. LV showed up with her cousin Jamie and they seemed to enjoy themselves. It was a pretty small class and it was nice seeing everyone again..I love watching us all work. After that LV, her cousin and I called Papi to come into the city to go see "The Village" okay its hard to talk about any of M. Night's movies without giving everything away. But I enjoyed it. There were points that were slow, unexpected, predictable, and shocking, and yes I even jumped in my seats a few times. We all traveled down to the 34th and 2nd theatre at Kips Bay this time. I actually liked it there. After the movie we all go to the bathroom and who should I run into but the guy that plays Tom Collins in "RENT", he joins his group who turns out to be Melanie Brown, and a girl friend of theirs. They looked at my group, LV, Papi, and Jamie and I and heard me say I loved her in "RENT" because she does a good job as Mimi. Then we just traveled to the apartment, LV and her cousin drove home and we went to bed...it was fun....

       urlLink       I died today~    Technically speaking I didnt die, but the name that I had become known to at my place of employment, that concrete jungle looking over Battery Park, killed me off. For nine months almost I had become known as Joshua Carter for some unknown reason, they placed me as this, so I thought am I a distant relative of Jimmy Carter, or maybe Kimberly Carter, who knew...well now I am officially known as a Carpenter again, which is kind of sad, I think I will miss Joshua Carter, it was fun to be someone else and not have to be me for awhile. Which now brings me to todays entry.      Dead Like Me~      This show is just brilliant, it comes on Friday nights on Showtime. Its about a girl who had absolutely know path in life, who dies in a tragic accident...a toilet seat hits her as she is on her lunch break. Her screwed up family mourns her loss as she is reborn as a grim reeper...yes you heard it GRIM. With a sexy british boy, a former Different World star and a former Doc and some chic that was on a highschool "Saved by the bell" show on Nickelodeon, they take people when it is their time to go.    So does this mean that its my time to go? Which brings me to the next question..when do we know? I was sitting with the love of my life last night and studying my monolgues while he goes through his computer to clean it up and I see pictures of his formers...I see this one guy that triggers something in me making me blurt out in the midst of Oscar Wilde, "I know him!" Of course Papi looks at me like "Huh?" so I naturally say again, "I know him, his name is uh....." and I search for the name "Jeffrey". His mouth hit the floor...turns out a guy he dated back in March is now dating a guy that I dated back in March, ironic or fate? See its things like that, which make me realize there are signs if your life is going the way it should. You just have to know what they are when they show up...I think God gives us our plans, so I think my life was thrown off track with the death of my father, and the other shit that happened, but its now back on track...I think we get thrown by many things, that is why some of us succeed way before others and some don't...life is a choice and you have to choose the right path...however there are many paths, which could take you way off course. My new roommie and my papi have the same middle name, my ex roommies best friend turned out to be a friend I knew...in a city of millions what are the odds. SO this brings me back to my point about being dead. If I were to die, does that mean I achieved what I was supposed to do..and if so...then what was that? Did all those people that died on 9-11 achieve what they were supposed to do in life, did they touch someones life...somehow I just don't think so, but then you read the stories that are written about them and you see they were amazing people, but when you die, do people make up things about you to make you seem greater than you were???? Regardless when I die I want to come back like Georgia in "Dead Like Me" and take people to the great beyond when they have completed what they were put here for...so in further...  Here lies Joshua Carter...he was a good man...he will be missed....or will he? What would my obituary say?      Ancient Egyptians believed that upon death they would be asked two questions and their answers would determine whether they could continue their journey in the afterlife. The first question was, "Did you bring joy?" The second was, "Did you find joy?" --Leo Buscaglia

       urlLink         Random Thoughts              Crazy: 1 a : full of cracks or flaws : UNSOUND b : CROOKED, ASKEW 2 a : MAD, INSANE b (1) : IMPRACTICAL (2) : ERRATIC c : being out of the ordinary : UNUSUAL a taste for crazy hats 3 a : distracted with desire or excitement a thrill-crazy mob b : absurdly fond : INFATUATED he's crazy about the girl> c : passionately preoccupied : OBSESSED crazy about    urlLink   boats    .         This is the official definition of  crazy  according to    urlLink  Merriam-Webster   . I believe everyone in their life should have at least one if not many friends who fit this eratic behavior, because it makes for an interesting life. At times I can be crazy, I mean riding the subway singing songs from   urlLink    Moulin Rouge      at early hours of the morning, while the drunken, homeless, and crazies stare at me, can be very crazy. But this is not the crazy that I'm talking about. NO, the crazy I'm talking about are the friends that just keep you rolling in the aisles because of their humor, who are just so bizzare in the things that they do that you find it intriguing even interested in it. What brings all this up you ask? Well...lets begin with me....a shy boy who for years was picked on and never had any friends...so I developed friends and a life of my own..I would lock myself away in my room and pretend I was a school teacher and created test and mock school things, I worked hard at this and it was something I loved...I would withdraw into this fantasy world. Flash forward to now...I'm an actor who goes for outrageous roles and things I would never do or be in real life..is this crazy? Okay take my new gay son that just moved into me, for months he lived with this psycho lunatic who constantly gave him a hard time, yet he stayed there, then he moves in with me and JS, does that make him crazy? Take my friend Amnesia, she is a man who dresses up in women's clothes and does a damn good job of it I must add, creates this whole different person, dances, drinks, talks, as this person, is he crazy? Or is the person who is always on the N train that comes in at rush hour after work begging for a quarter, or food or anything to feed her family and so distinctly tells us she has   urlLink  AIDS   , is she crazy? Well my friends I hate to confess it to you all, but everyone in this whole world is crazy! That's right, Bush, Clinton, Kerry, Jennifer Lopez, Jude Law, Serena Williams, The Pope....yes my friends ALL of them are crazy..because there is not one person in this world that does not have a crack or a flaw within them..we are all created with the ability to succeed or fall flat on our asses, I choose the first one...so the next time you say "oh my god that person is fuc&#^% crazy, think to yourself "oh my god I'm fuc#&amp;@* crazy!" Maybe then the world won't be so freaking judgemental, you think? Yeah your right...because we are all fuck&#&amp; crazy!          I was crazy back when being crazy really meant something.

       urlLink       Yes you heard correctly, My Papi and I have given birth to a gay son, okay we didn't actually carry him for nine months or lay on our backs and shoot him out, but we did get a gay son! Our   urlLink  Deviant    son moved in this weekend and brought with him his life. After leaving the clutches of a lumberjack, he loaded up a van with "Art" and headed to Queens, Astoria that is. Now leaving the city and moving to the boroughs is a big difference, your saying goodbye to the quickness of the subway and the being able to walk everywhere. However your also saying hello to the beautiful place which is Astoria, Queens. The area where I live has trees, and families and dogs and tons of gay men. Astoria is becoming the Mecca gay zone..Expect   urlLink  Queer Eye    to be doing a special there soon. I'm sure our gay son will fit in just fine, and there are even "gasp" gay bars there. So he moved all his stuff in and then crashed with crazy   urlLink  "El Guapo"    then headed back over. My former roommie only moved eight blocks down the street. So now its to building the apartment, building a life together and going to IKEA for we are the new gay family in Astoria!   Stay tuned for all the  urlLink  "Melrose Place"   drama with Latin Snoopy, Special K aka Gay Son, and ActorSmurf. With special appearances by El Guapo, Amnesia, MS, KittyV, and many many more.
