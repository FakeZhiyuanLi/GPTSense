      As I'm currently living in the state of Oklahoma, my choices on where to go and see "Fahrenheit 9/11" are limited.  There are two theatres that are currently showing out and there both about 90 minutes away.  So,,in this marvelous age of computers and this "internet" thing, I did the next best thing..I DOWNLOADED IT...It was just some little pirated version that I got, but since I'm not expecting much, as in terms of special effects or great visual's, I figured that this would be ok.  As I sit here after just finishing the movie, I'm full of mixed emotions....Should I be pissed at Bush, or this fat bastard that made this movie to show his hate for Bush...I'm going to go with both.  Bush could of handled it better and the fat bastard could of been a little not so "one-sided".  Yada, yada, yada...I'm not going to sit here and write about my views to try to persuade you into any side or causes...Make up your own damn mind.  But after seeing the commotion that "Passion"  caused, I have realized that this country is full of a bunch of people that are easily convinced of stupid shit.  Any slight "disturbance in the force" will make people turn stupid pretty quickly.  I think the best people to debate or argue with are the people that are in there 55+ yrs.  These people have had to put up with a long line of presidential, political, and sociological bullshit to come up with real, not just persuaded, but thought out and lived views on this nation.  The older a person is, which most people know this already, are the best debaters just cause they have heard it all.  So as a personal favor to me.  Just watch this movie, and try to not let the thoughts and views in it persuade you into irrational thinking....Fucking Subliminal Messages......

      The music on play today is "Martin Scorsese Presents the Blues: Keb Mo."  If you don't want to and go buy all of Keb Mo's ablums,,,then this CD is a must.  If has a good collection of Mo's material.  I have been pretty pleased with Martin Scorsese's collections.  So if you get a chance, pick some of them up....

      OK, now I KNOW the world isn't going to end any time soon...I just got done listening to the Velver Revolver "Contraband" CD for about the 5th time now....Its damn good, damn good.  With Slash on guitar, Duff McKagan on bass, MMMAAATTTT Sorum on drums, Dave Kushner on guitar ( of Wasted Youth) and one of the most drugged, and awesome, lead singers ever, Mr. Scott Weiland.  This is a great album...I REPEAT,,,,THIS IS  A GREAT ALBUM..Many of the songs sound like one STP material,,kinda CORE eraish...And Many of the songs sound like old GNR material..Circa "Appetite Era".  One of the best songs it is a slow ballad called "You Got No Right".  Weiland is just a good singer that can do about every type of song..If you can remember his "12 Bar Blues" from 1998, you will know what I'm talking about...Slash has still got it, Mr. Sorum on the drum side, sounds as good as he did with GNR, if not better.   Slither is one of my favorite songs also, not only due to the fact that it has a really good video, but the beat and bass line just kicks ass, then it kicks into some uptempo guitar, kinda STP'ish.  Slither was there first single released off of the Contraband CD.  They had released on the Hulk soundtrack "Set Me Free".  It wasn't the best song ever, but it showed us signs of what was to come.  "Loving the Alien" is a great little diddy also..Reminds me of "creep"  But that is about it, for this album..After putting up with the latest GNR (The one with Axl) for the last 4 years and not seeing anything,...This album makes it all ok.  Even though Axl has his little heroine hands around Mr. Buckethead for now...He soon hopefully will escape, and come out of his bucket, metaphorically.  My rating for Velvet Revolver "Contraband"....A well deserving 7/7 stars... GO and BUY IT...If not, then just download it.....:)

      Today is Friday,,,Thank God, is about time this week is over...Actually, this week hasn't been so bad.  Found a new rental house to move in, hopefully.  Nicki is done working until sunday night, so tommorrow i'm making her come and "witness" my Hapkido and Taekwondo belt test.  She hasn't been to one, or to class yet, so i'm going to make her come.  Other than that, my weekend is going to ammount to about nothing I think.  Just play some Xbox, the game of the moment is "The Suffereing"....Great freaky game,,,Highly recommended. 5 out 7 Stars    The music on play this week, is Buddy Guy's "Sweet Tea" album 7/7 stars, Phish's "Undermind" 6/7 stars, and Miles Davis "The Complete In a Silent Way Sessions" 8/7 stars.  These are all reallly good albums..Miles Davis got the special 8/7 stars, just because I can and its worth getting....Lata

      This is just some stupid quotes and thoughts I have heard, or had myself....Alot belong to George Carlin....Enjoy When someone asks you, "A penny for your thoughts", and you put in your 2 cents,,,,Where does the other penny go?? If mothers feed there babies with little forks and spoons, do the chinese use toothpicks?? Procrastination---The Art of Keeping Up With Yesterday As a matter of principle, I never attend the "First Annual" of anything!!!! The only good thing ever to come out of religion, is the music. If a deaf person swears, does his mom wash his hands with soap. Why is what a doctor does, is called "practice"? If the Easter Bunny screwed the Groundhog, would Santa visit on Thanksgiving!! If you put honey on asparagus, does it taste more like guacamole, than Bugles dipped in Diet Coke?? The future will be better tommorrow. Better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to speak out and remove all doubt. Most people that have low self-esteem, have earned it. Is there another word for synonym?  If at first you don't succeed, try again.  If you fail the second time,,,,QUIT,,,,Most things aren't worth making an ass out of yourself....

      Today is the "kicking" off of my first blog.  WOOHOO, I'm just so fucking technologically advanced, that I can't stand it.  I'm only a couple of yrs. behind.....It happens....Well, I'm Isaac, from Norman, OK.  I'm originally from Edgeley, ND.  Edgeley is a little town of 650 people and 2 bars.  There wasn't much to do there in High School except drink and thats about it.  The people are always nice in smaller towns, and are even after you left there 6 yrs ago.  Right now I'm 24, married to my wife Nichole.  She's a RN at the Children's Hospital here.  We also have a little pug named Norman, he is the spawn of satan a lot of the time, or else hes just a little cuddly ball of fur,,,,kinda like an extra pillow...But that is it for now, cause I don't have anymore to say....Later

      Last Thursday, Nicki and I got some great news. We are expecting our first child. We were kinda planning it, but more along the line of, "see what happens". So, as far as we know, the due date is around March 16th, 2005. Hopefully it will fall around the same time as spring break for schools, so we can get some family down here. I have also found out in the last couple of weeks, that my cousin is having his first, and my boss is having his 2nd. My bosses wife is about 2-3 weeks ahead of us, so the race is on. Other than that, there isn't much happening now. We are probably going ot go and do some camping next weekend, since the next weekend we are moving into our new place.....But thats it for this morning.....

      Today is just your basic ordinary Monday.  Its full of all those headaches that make it the 'best' day of the week.  This is also the day that a person's caffeine and nicotine (if your a smoker) levels go up to unhealthy levels after subsiding all weekend.  It is also the day, that if you drank over the weekend, that your hoping to hangover is gone by.  As for me, in my little to Nile alcohol intake level these day, I don't have a hangover or residual effects, but what I have instead, IS ONE HELL OF A SUNBURN.  After laying in the pool for about 4 hrs Sat., with about 7 fresh coats of SPF 25 symbol's on, I left the pool feeling pretty good about not getting burnt, but I was positive I had.  Growing up as a "city" boy with nothing to do during the summer, except for baseball.  Me and my brother spent a lot of time at the local swimming pool with our friends.  I usually would get about one good nice sunburn at the beginning of the summer, and that would carry me through until September.  But as I sit under these glowing, humming, and excellent choice for office lighting fixtures, I can feel that fluorescent lighting not doing a damn thing to me at all...Its kind nice.  I think that maybe by this weekend I won't have much of a sunburn left,,,just the snake-like shedding that goes on to reveal that layer of nice white skin underneath to be the next victim of that damn thing they call "the sun".  So with the large among of work we have left in the office that is due pretty soon, I guess the only sun I'm going to be seeing is the one that glares in my window and gets me pissy because I can't see my screen.  But that is about it for my sunburn.  Oh, I also picked up a bottle of SPF 50 for the next time I'm out in the sun.  But that's about it for the moment.  Me and my bottle of Aloe-Vera gel wish you all a happy week, and I will write more later...Time to go and apply another coat of that smooth refreshing sunburn healer....
