       Back a few years ago  there was a website starting up called  urlLink PC Gameworld .  I met some people on ICQ and ended up helping them start it up.  I was with them for a while and I headed up the RPG News section.  It was pretty cool.  I got free games and wrote reviews for them.  Well, I left and shortly after the site started to get more and more of a sell out look to it.  Now it's a giant piece of shit.  Ah well, I thought maybe I'd write a review when I play new games.  I'll do one on Riddick soon (awsome game.)   So, now for the pictures.   First up is Driv3r.  To sum stuff up for you so you can skip this paragraph if you like, the game sucks.  Sucks goats ass.  If you want more detail of why I would say that, it's because I don't believe repeating segments of a game over, and over, and over, and over...is any fun at all.  If I wanted to do something over and over again I would drink a lot of Coke or Coffee.  Now, the good points of this game can be summed up on 3 fingers.   First finger:   The CG is quite well done, and the voice acting is good quality.  Second finger:   Blowing shit up is always fun, and this game does it very well.  Third finger:   Use the Film Director thing to edit the way you watch yourself blowing shit up.  That pretty much sums it up.  The single player game is annoying and uses an inexcusable design.   My beautiful Steel Batallion  controller is the next picture down.  Now, this thing cost me more than $200 (can't remember exactly), but it's the coolest controller I've  ever  seen, in or out of an arcade.  The problem with it is the game is super hard.  There are like 20 levels and I can't get past the 4th level.  Unfortunately Action Reply can't help me with it.  Most unfortunate since I'd really love to play the later levels.  Ah well.   The last picture I'm posting  today is of my Xbox.  I love Xbox.  I adorned my Xbox with this sticker a good long while ago and I still love it.  Gives it a little bit of extra flavour I think.  Anyway, it's 0020hrs and I'm getting tired.  I think I'll watch a movie and then go to sleep.

      Unfortunately I haven't written a webpage in years.  What that means is I don't know any of the current crap everyone uses to write those pages.  CSS is something I didn't know existed...  I'm trying to modify the template but for some reason it's not quite working out as it should.  I'm trying to add a pic to the side as a side border thing but it is strange...  It works when I Preview the template, but not when I load the actual site.  I don't know what I'm doing wrong, but I hope I figure it out soon.  Not a big deal yet since the picture I've been making is pretty much crap anyway heh.  So much for the days when I used to be proud to write my websites in Notepad.  Ah well...

       urlLink Xbox: The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay :  "but gamers simply shouldn't let The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay pass them by. It's simply too good and too tasty to ignore. Not to mention it's the first decent step towards next-next-generation visuals. I'm sure Vin is very proud."   If you've never tried this game out, I suggest you do.  This is awsome.  Other games I am playing right now are Full Spectrum Warrior, Project Gotham 2, and believe it or not I'm still playing Ghost Recon once in a while (not the shitty PS2 version).

      Well, nothing like a first try.  It's always fun to try something new.  I've done online diaries before but not quite like this.  This site is pretty bloody well done.  I need an outlet for life, so this should be a good home.  My [online] name is Nakor, and I go to Sir Sandford Fleming College in Peterborough, Ontario, Canada.  I am taking the 3 year Programmer Analyst course there.  I plan to spend the rest of my life when I'm done making video games.  I will get into the industry in anyway I can, and I will be making games throughout my time in school.  This site will likely also be used for posting updates on my projects...sorta like a .plan file.  I have already done some games in school, although they are silly tiny little things.  The only sizeable project I have done is actually a joke to annoy a student we [endearingly] call Little Bitch (or LB for short).  It is called "The Adventures of Little Bitch" and it's very silly.  It's not done yet because I really don't care to create the aprox 30 or so battles and monsters that it would take to finish it.  I will entice my fellow students to write some of the battles I think.  I am 24 years old now, and I spent approximately the last 5 years before I started school, trying to get into school.  Despite my disapointment at how easy school is (very very easy), I firmly believe SSFC (Fleming) is the greatest college for IT.  Despite some of my rather pathetic teachers (I'm not gonna say names), I have had some excellent experiences so far.  Dennis Vanderspek taught my Technical Communications course, and I must say he is very intelligent.  I was proud to learn from him (although he'd probably be annoyed with me if he read this...my online writting is different then my writting in his classes.)  Another teacher that impressed me a great deal is actually the head of the Programmer Analyst course, Lynn Allan.  While she may be so heavy on the D (DiSC) that it annoys me, she definately knows what she's talking about.  In the end, if you live anywhere near Peterborough and you are looking for a school, Fleming should be it.  If only I can stop trying to spell it with two m's I should be all right.  Well, that's it for now.  Gotta finish setting up the rest of the site.  Nakor

       You know, sleep is highly over-rated  . . . but I still wish I could sleep when I need to. &nbsp;  A few days ago I registered  for a new domain name . . . ermm, that's&nbsp;four and a quarter days ago.&nbsp; What the hell?&nbsp; The domain people don't work on weekends?&nbsp; Does the internet shut down on the weekends,&nbsp; go on vacation, go to sleep?&nbsp; No!&nbsp; It's 24 hours a day, 365 days a week (actually, 366 this year.)&nbsp; Ah well, hopefully it will be up tommorow. &nbsp;  Since registering for the domain  name I've done nothing but look at my options as to what to use for the site (did that for a day and a half or so), and then studying some new languages!&nbsp; These languages are Perl (for CGI scripts . . . took a day to get a real good hold on Perl), and PHP (another day to get a good hold.)&nbsp; I love programming, it's the only thing I'm any good at really. &nbsp;  My school isn't doing so well  these days.&nbsp; I get so far ahead of myself (and everyone else) and then I get bored and get behind.&nbsp; My teachers are not always very bright, so often I don't bother to go to class.&nbsp; Instead I generally choose to program in the Computer Commons (just like when I was in high school; skipping class to go to the library and read lol . . . what a dork.) &nbsp;  I will most likely either completely  migrate this site to my new server or I will make a new redirect for it.&nbsp; Should get it a bit more exposure . . . although that doesn't matter much really.&nbsp; It'll be the big site works that I'll want to get exposure for.&nbsp; For anyone that stumbles across this blog, the new site will be at  urlLink http://www.indolentspecies.com  &nbsp; Well, that's it for today.&nbsp; Insanity, don't leave home without it.

       urlLink Moore: pirate my film, no problem - [Sunday Herald]     Controversial film-maker Michael Moore has welcomed the appearance on the internet of pirated copies of his anti-Bush documentary Fahrenheit 9/11 and claimed he is happy for anybody to download it free of charge.   The activist, author and director told the Sunday Herald that, as long as pirated copies of his film were not being sold, he had no problem with it being downloaded.   “I don’t agree with the copyright laws and I don’t have a problem with people downloading the movie and sharing it with people as long as they’re not trying to make a profit off my labour. I would oppose that,” he said.

        urlLink Bethesda Softworks : "Bethesda Softworks� announced today that it will develop and publish Fallout� 3 -- a sequel to the highly popular Fallout� role-playing game franchise. Bethesda licensed the rights to the Fallout� franchise from Interplay Entertainment Corp. (OTC Bulletin Board: IPLY) in a deal that awards Bethesda exclusive worldwide rights to the Fallout� franchise on the PC, home consoles, handhelds, and other media, with the option to develop and publish additional sequels."   Well, if you ask me that's just awsome news!  I love the Fallout games.  And Bethesda's really good at making awsome stuff.  Morrowind was one of the greats.  I'm really looking forward to seeing this.

       urlLink    I decided to make some changes to my desktop.  It was covered in links and looked crappy.  Figured out themes and Kapsules (cool stuff).  I like it much better now.&nbsp; urlLink

       I learned something new the other day  ... never try to shave off a beard using a electric shaver.  That hurts like hell.   I got into Torrents recently ...now that I'm a broke student again.  My current favorite site is  urlLink http://www.lokitorrent.com/torrent/ .  So much better than the really really old warez sites full of popups and bullshit.  Also much better than Kazaa (or however you spelled it.)   I'm getting back into making music  with Fruity Loops like I used to.  Mp3.com going under kinda set me off for a while.  I love making music although I doubt very many people really appreciate my music.  Some of my music is still out on some sites somewhere but I can't remember where.  Under the name:  Indolent Species.   Well, that's about all  I have to say today lol.   Keep smokin your gum and chewin your cigarettes.
