      I never get to talk about him in entirety.... And lately, more than ever, I'm disturbed with my inability to get over him.... I don't understand this. I hate him and yet I am unable to get my mind off of him. Even when I'm drunk I cannot stop myself from talking about him. And today I almost IMed him...I think I'm trying to tell myself that I did it so I could ask if he is still returning to RIT for college and is still going to be my boyfriend's roomate...but I just miss him and can't get my head back to myself. What the fuck did you do, Josh? What  was  it about you? Even after everything...I just don't understand. And now I find more saved conversations of ours, and I almost started balling my eyes out.  I constantly listen to music you gave me, read poems that you inspired, talk about you...I can't think of a damn thing to say to you if ever we meet again, and chances are, we will with you about to live with my boyfriend.  I wish he weren't going to be around, but at the same time, my heart practically becomes it's own person just thinking about seeing him again, looking at him, being in his presense.... I'm scared to death of you. One thing I will give him...he was an inspiration to my best poetry. There's no such thing as negative inspiration, in my opinion. Bad inspiration, yes, and he was and is that, but negative? When I am inspired to write wonderfully (or at least well enough to be satisfied) I cannot and will not complain.  I could speak forever about you, I could have fucking lived for you, I know it's wrong, but it's truth and it makes me hate myself for even feeling that way. I can't help wondering what it would be like if I had him instead of Conrad.... Would I still be sweet? Would I still be caring?  Would I still be kind? Would I be  happy?  It makes me sick to think I'll never really know. I hate myself for still loving him unconditionally. Something he never could have done for me.

      Not sure how all this shit works yet, but I'm not too stupid, so I should be able to figure it all out eventually....    When One Eight Becomes Two Zeros     Glad when you're near,    And I'm sad when you're here.   This is what's it's like to me.   I'm mad when you're near,   And I'm glad when you're here.   This is what it's like to die.    &nbsp;  This all hurts me so much,   That I honestly believe you're the one this is hard for.   I bartered tack for wit,   And I've already made up a billion stories about you.    &nbsp;  Knee deep in static,    I hear you breaking up,   I'm breaking up,   I guess we're breaking up.   You're not the other woman.   You're just another,   Another hobby for a guy like me.    &nbsp;  I'm glad when you're here,   And I'm sad when you're near,   This is what it's like to be me.    &nbsp;  You've given me a heart like a gun,   And I'm so shocked that I made it through this billion days,   Made it through these billion days.   I didn't think I could tough it out for those days.   Didn't think I could tough it out...a billion.    &nbsp;  Knee deep in static,   I hear you breaking up,   We're breaking up,   I guess we're breaking up.   You're not the other woman,   You're just another,   Another hobby for a guy like me.    &nbsp;  So we're growing, I'm sure.   There's no other I can turn to.   There's no other I can turn to.    &nbsp;  Knee deep in static,   I hear you breaking up,   We're breaking up,   I guess we're breaking up.   You're not the other woman,   You're just another,   Another hobby for a guy like me.    &nbsp;  I'm mad when you're near,   And I'm sad that you're hear.   This is what it's like to be me.   I'm glad when you're near,   And I'm sad that you're here.   This is what it's like to be me.   I'm mad when you're near,   And sad that you're here.   This is what it's like to be me.   But I'm glad that you're near,   And I'm sad that you're here.   I hope you enjoy dying alone.    &nbsp;  --Glassjaw

      "Come here," he said. I shook my head and he grabbed my boob so I kicked him in the balls. Abby grabbed my other boob and they started screaming about great tits....  Going to get trashed...going to get sick...going to fall down a few times too many and going to laugh and kiss a lot of cheeks....  I hope I don't get groped like I did last time.

       Ok I noticed someone named AJay who puts a lot of poems in his blog so I thought I'd put some in mine that I wrote myself.      The Warrior       A fine beautiful day yet again I awaken to    But for no one can see the impending doom    Through all of the glory and innocence    There is something more I sense      For it cannot be described by one of the 5    And it is to strong to be disregarded as a "bad vibe"    A chill runs down my spine, this is too good to be true    All this happiness will be gone, quicker than soon      For I had thought I had defeated all there was to defeat    Left all evil behind, and happiness I will meet    But wrong I am    For it will happen again      The chill gets stronger    It will happen before longer    I was a fool to relax    I had not quite covered my tracks      My tired face has seen more than most can imagine    Oh how I wish I hadn't    But my enemy is back to vist me again    I thought I had defeated it then      I have fought many battles with it    In the end coming out much more fit    Endless assaults upon my torn soul    But yet somehow, I make it through them all      My enemy doesn't have a name    So I have no reference to point the blame    But regardless, for me it doesn't matter much anyway    For I live a quite harsh way      Never ending fights, sometimes for reasons I do not know    But each battle won and lost, my strength continues to grow    For I am in my own right a warrior, this is my job some would say    But deep down inside I don't wanna live this way      I continue to fight, night after night    Sometimes I think, just for the sport of the fight    When will this end, I don't know    For deep down inside, I have a tortured soul      Even in moments of calm and assurance    I know not for long, it will change from this    For I live a life of torment    I can never believe it will end      Fight I will, fight on and on    I will continue to fight, even after the fight is gone    For there is no happiness in my life    For all I see in my future is the continuing fight...

       Ok I recently quit smoking and drinking everything...ok not everything  just weed, cigarettes and alcohol. The reason behind this is that I need  to focus more and those three things were making me tired, hungry and  broke (not to mention RRRREEEAAAALLLLYY FFUCKKKEDDD UUPP!!!!). I will  resume smoking weed and drinking after I move, but cigarettes are gone  for good. I mean if they at least got ya fucked up then I'd keep smoking  them, but unfortunatly they have no purpose other than to waste $7 of my  money on a daily basis.

                       I was on the ferry yet again and it was 3 in the morning. I had noticed a serious security lapse, the rope in front of the boat was down so anyone could walk to the front of the boat and lean over the gate (this was previously allowed until the ferry crash). I had to get some answers on why this was allowed in this dangerous gremlin and zombie filled world we live in today...    James Smith: Hey why is the rope down?  Ferry Captain: People take it down all the time, we put it up, they take it down.  James Smith: Well I guess no one will notice at 3 in the morning   Ferry Captain looks at watch and continues to help dock the boat

       I was in the Staten Island Ferry Terminal waiting for the ferry and  noticed a bomb sniffing dog and his trainer, I couldn't let the  opportunity slip away...  James Smith: Is that a bomb sniffing dog? Dog Trainer: Yeah. James Smith: How far can it smell bombs from? Dog Trainer: Pretty far. James Smith: Hey what kind of dog is that? Dog Trainer: A golden lab

       Living in NYC you tend to notice the change in security measures after  the 9/11 attacks. So I, James Smith, conducted some in-depth interviews  with some counter-terrorism related personnel to find out a little more  info on what exactly the city is doing to prevent terrorism. In the  upcoming minutes you will be able to read these excellent examples of  fine journalism.

       This is a pretty awesome movie I saw the other day. It has so many conspiracy theories it's crazy. It's basically about some soldier who gets brainwashed so he can become the first corporate owned President of the United States and it's up to Denzel Washington to stop him. That's all I'll say cause I don't wanna give too much away.

       Yeah I just finished reading this book, it's really good. Basically it's a compilation of the cartoon strip written by Tom Tomorrow. They highlight all of the shortcomings of the U.S. goverment but with a comedic twist. It also explains a lot of events and such that the average person never knew about (like how Phillip Morris [the cigarette company] owns Kraft Foods and other "innocent companies"). Check it out!
