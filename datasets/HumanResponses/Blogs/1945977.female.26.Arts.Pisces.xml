      today went to the other value village, they had nothing really and things were overpriced. Then went to Richmond hoping I can see some gloomy bear stuff, not much...ended up buying snacks/grocery at yaohan. Then went to Steve's store, hung out a bit, went home. Nothing exciting. Nathan was upset in the afternoon cuz he didn't get on plane, but he seemed better at night. He better come back for the appointment on friday.

      Well at least now I know what to do for my digital project...but then Julie wants me to do more filming...it was pretty hard to have someone film me on my scooter. That class sucks, but at least I learned about the possibilities of final cut pro. After, I was gonna go to beach but seemed cold, went to value village to make myself happy, been to mall before nothing really worth buying. Found a few items, prob return two tomorrow, nothing too great finds. I'm surprised I didn't find any bags. Came home, let time fly by, worked on my project abit, did some research. Now I should think of what to write for that journal project. um can't think... o yeah I booked appointment for acupressure massage tonite with nathan for friday, can't wait. Don't know if I should go for the sea salt rub and sea salt bath, maybe it's ghetto there, u never know. I hope Nathan will come back by then cuz he's leaving tmr again.

      Friendster...is to show off to people how many friends you have...and the point is to just add people u see...no way people would pay for that kinda service. Maybe for blogs though, right?  Had lunch at market, went to The Gathering Place, a south downtown community center to register for membership... $1 for 1 year, good deal. Sketchy people..hope they don't steal my stuff when I go. $1 is worthy for ghettoness. Damn the pottery class is on thursday, clashes with my schedule.

      Today I worked, it was kinda hot. There were clothes that customers bought which i would have totally bought if I saw earlier, grrr. Then went to beach and met up with Anthony there, it was hot. He brought his skateboard, um I think I'm too old to try that shit. Maybe I'd rather be alone, before he came i did some drawings but I guess we just chatted a bit after he came. After I could have gone out with him and Janice S for drinks. Janice is nice but I wouldn't mind going home eating to save $ and I didn't know if I was in the socializing mood. I felt kinda down at home, maybe i'm not really ok with the break up after all, maybe I was down by this weekend. I don't know, sometimes I don't know myself I guess. I feel alone but I kinda want to be alone as well. I don't really want to go to people for it either, because I'm not asking for a solution or wanting to bug people, I prob just need some time to myself.

      Why do people try to make me feel better with standard coddle phrases? If they are more creative with their words at least I know that they put some effort and thoughts in coddling me.

        So Lynn kept calling me to ask me if I'm going out anyways, then she called and asked if she can sleep at my place? Why would she ask me for favour after she stands me up? Called a few more times, couldn't sleep and wanted to go out perhaps? I'm not there for you 24/7. I could drive the scooter down to richmond to see anthony and have drink but he doesn't care too much, so we decided not to cuz it's getting late. So I will just sulk in my sadness, do some work, and go to work tomorrow. I just know I'm missing out on alot of good parties, and I keep having to tell myself it's just another club night, there will always be more. But dayam I hate missing good ones. "Watermelon and vegetable fries are my company for tonite." hmm I think I can do my project on this.

      Last night was bad idea to go out with nathan. I was stupid to fool myself into thinking everything can still be fun after breaking his heart. Can't really hide your feelings when things are not ok. At the same time, I was getting really mad about not going, because i took work off the next day for it and bought advanced tickets for it. My childish uncontrollable anger came out and I started kicking the curb and yelling at him. Then he said something mean So we had to sell them at the door which was hard to see them go. I was really looking forward to see sandra collins and frankie bones, and also it's my party day to look forward to the whole week. It's not mine or nathan's fault but I should have been smarter about it. It hurts me to see him hurt, especially because I caused the pain. At least we had good talks. Today I got email from Janice, and old friend who had became a hermit. She wrote some deep stuff and made me feel more emotional on top of other things. I thought about the past and how much we have grown, and how different our lives are. She has a more adult life than me for sure. Then Lynn was talking to me about her problems the whole day. I was there for her so much, and she stood me up tonite. Some people I talked to didn't seem to be that sympathetic towards my emotions, sigh, fuck them. Or maybe I just expect too much from people. It's like Nathan thinks people don't do the same for him as he would do for them. I feel so emotional today. At the same time I'm trying to find words for my project from all my feelings but I can't...I lose them and not catch them in time. Today was hot but I let the day passed...maybe I can go to the beach tomorrow after work. not sure what's going on tonite yet...

      Last night I had nightmare that wilson died and then I died and there was like a lineup and whatever, and I tried calling people to tell them to get rid of some stuff before my parents see. I woke up at 8 from nightmare but of course went back to sleep again.  From dream dictionary Death If you dreamed of being dead yourself, it indicates an approaching release from all your worries and/or a recovery from illness. (UM it wasn't very pleasant at all...)  The night before I woke up at 9 also from nightmare of losing the money Nathan gave me to pay the bills. It dragged so long and I was feeling so not good that I had to wake myself up.  What's up with all this?

      Today I did alot. Twins drove me cuz we had the same schedule for the day. In Richard's class, we watched videos of Kentridge which was good, cuz he does some awesome drawing animations. We had to talk about our final project individually, so this weblog will help me with it. From probably tomorrow, I have to start drawing from something I write in here everyday for the rest of the semester. This is a narrative drawing class, so I will include text in it to help me develop this kind of drawings.  -stick with black ink pen -mistakes can be made in order to see progress -preferrably deep thought of the day My linear drawing will improve over time. In the end, maybe I can display them on a wall, or I can keep it in a book format. I think it will be very good practice, and in the end it's more about the process. Talked to Gord after class. After that, went to pay bills, buy beads and tickets, just as I planned. Ate crepe for dinner. Then went to the Vancouver Art Gallery for my other drawing class. Parked at taco time/Samuel's. Looked through some stuff (again), then we had to do an exercise of one piece of work, answer some questionnaire, and then we had to do a drawing (with text). It was effective in the way of looking at an art work, when u find the details, u can get some deeper meaning, questions or answer, the artist's decision in handling. I had the chance to talk to Elizabeth about my final project for this class. Frist part, I will use big paper, and do doodles. Sometimes I just don't really know what to draw, when I doodle, I can find meaning into nothing and create from there. I can divide my time, to see the differences with the time and mood I am in. The second part of the project is to find parts that I like and do them bigger. I want to do the same one a few times with different mediums, to see what I can work with. Then walked to taco time, samuel gave us a smoothie and then walked to Soho to check out the art opening.  Joe and Shay's works are there. There were lotsa works on the wall, they are all for sale for $125, pretty good deal I would say. Each artist has a few on. There were so many people that they made people line up for capacity. I had a corona, good stuff. Saw some classmates too. Joe joked that I have admirers from school, ego boost. Yeah he just had to add that nowadays white guys are into asian... whatever~ Went home. Chat online a bit. Nathan ok, good stuff. I go party with him tomorrow at gold club, it will be good times. Tmr- pay bill, extra interview, work on digital, buy sketchbook, start doing narrative drawing. Then party hard. This is a good way to keep my schedule.

      Yesterday was fucking freezing and I had to reshoot video of me riding scooter. So damn cold. I did some drawings and I'm a bit happier about them. I've been getting annoyed with Nathan more lately :/ I dunno what to think. I guess I'm a bitch and not being understanding of his circumstances. Today we had lunch and I was mean to him I guess. Well we are gonna go out tonite for halloween and I hope we have better time. Twins are coming out too and whoever I dunno.. no rave for me no popping with my busy schedule for now. Last night I made my own costume, first ever, of ...gloomy bear, doesn't really look like it but I look retarded enough to be funny. I actually sewed the head piece hehe, and the arm I just used duct tape.

      Yesterday was such a lazy day, I tried to get some work done but at some points I just want to quit art school. I did do some work and took nap on that dreary day too. Seems like inspiration and motivation come at night...what's up with that? I got a job at school watching equipment for the media gallery on next friday, coolio...but I'm gonna be so busy...I'm not free everyday next week...cuz I have field trip also on tuesday to seattle but fun fun...and at the same time I have so much shit to do...but when I'm at home I just start to get lazy...and then I guess I'm a bit attached to Nathan to go see him. Oh oh and Halloween, how can I stay home that day? Well at least maybe I shouldn't go pop e but it's been my ritual. so much to do, I'm glad I have the palm pilot. I look like I'm such a busy tecky professional person, but I'm actually a laid back ghetto person...my work place is ghetto for sure, esp being on yuppy kits area. Man that place is dirty, and so is my house. I hate my bathroom. I hate fucking mold. I see spiders inside my house, and then I see a big ass red spider in my garden but it's normal they are there I guess. I need to move out but I can't cuz I'm a poor ass student. But then someone cooks for me and do my laundry...I don't mind doing laundry though if i have to. Ok enough rambling... Yeah still don't knwo what to do for halloween and I haven't go costume yet... @_@

      Hello.. went to annie's bday at the provence, a pretty high end restaurant...me and anthony asked her b4 hand if we are splitting the bill or paying individually, so she said individually. When the bill came, she told people we are paying first for ourselves and there were glances between her and gua pay and anthony saw and things like that. I hate that. Also, I feel tricked because she told Anthony dinner is not going to be expensive...eventhough she wants to have fine dining on her birthday she shouldn't find one that not everyone can afford. I paid $40 which is probably less than I should pay as split, and we had to pay for her as well. She liked my Emily journal for her, I want one too but an said that place is sold out. After we went clubbing afterwards at Voda. There were rounds of non stop shooter, I had probably 8+. I didn't realize that I had too much and started to feel bad. I went to washroom by myself squatting in bathroom stall (thank god it's not filthy there). I called Nathan and a cab. I went out and told byron and some people I'm leaving and quickly left the place. It was around midnight, pretty early...well also we had to set clock backwards. I felt pretty bad, but I didn't puke. I never went to a club and had to take cab to leave by myself. They are not really my good friends so I didn't bother telling anyone that I was feeling sick. Felt kinda bad u know...I spent wayyy to much this week...the birthday thing I got all drinks for free at club, but entrance was $12, dinner $40, cab $12, clothes were $150...+ more more :( not happy with the spending but maybe I can try to make more?? I really want to concentrate on homework though...I'm not working hard enough for sure... tomorrow i have appointment at another massage place again with Nathan...I really don't think i deserve it at the moment especially with how hard I worked at my homework. I think I need more exercise instead. On sunday, just chilled at Nathan's...waited til night for tony's van so I could go home. So I didn't do much work on sunday like I was planning to.  I was late for class today half hour cuz I don't have my stereo alarm...Today there was citique of my video, yeah I think I can work on it alot more...I think we can get off earlier today so maybe I'll do some halloween shopping, snack shopping to stock up for winter...I want to cut my hair too...wendy suggested it otherwise I haven't really thought much of it. today wasisname, wavy media guy came in the computer room, I asked him about my drawing project and he gave me more direction so now I feel that I can move on some more. that's all for now.

      Haven't wrote for awhile~ Tuesday don't remember what I did...I stayed over at Nathan's haven't for awhile so it was nice. Wed same old and then went to sonar, it sucked...there was beat box battle was not bad but maybe we were just tired, it's not fun to stand around. When we go clubbing we wanna dance til we drop. The vibe downstairs is just lacking...comparing to how much fun I had at shine last time it's just not really there. Thu we had a fucking long ass critique, started early before class, and ended later than the class. I didn't really get much out of mine... I think I need more direction. Today finally I have nothing to do, went to the honey drop sale, spent $150 *gulp* wasn't expecting that. But they are all good stuff, Nathan knows how much I dwell on spending that money after I went to see him and had dinner. I finally tried that felicia restaurant it is very east side but very delicious, yummy nummy pasta. We chilled, and I came back finally finished writing my review for diva class. tomorrow annie's bday, dinner and clubbing...hmm I hope it's good times and not spend too much $$. I wonder if Nathan can go or not... what to wear too....

      Last night I couldn't sleep for awhile, so got around 4 hours of sleep, surprisingly I'm ok right now. Critique today is very very slow, alot of people have problems with outputting the video. Yesterday I dropped my bopping head Homer into the back of my scooter...don't ask me how...so today I tried to take the scooter apart to get it out. I opened the lid and I dunno where the screw is for now...well it's ok for that one, but I tried to take the battery out and I had to take the screws off it, well guess what it was dropped in there also. OK now I can't start the bike without the screw keeping the flow of the electricity, so I walked to Carter Honda which is close to my school luckily. I asked for a screw and came back and it started so I drove it Carter and they tried to take it out for me with flashlight and long tools. There were 2 people there watching and it was very funny when he pulled Homer out slowly. Gotta keep my Homer, haha. It's a very stupid stunt of mine but I find it very funny too. Just for that $2 Homer, but hey I can't life my life knowing that it's in my bike, right?

      Today luckily it's sunny for my video shoot. The twins did it for me while I drive down on granville, back and forth. Could have done more but they got skool and I can work with whatever I got here. Chilled at skool for a bit...waiting for the computer to transfer the video into computer...went to get a vhs tape and atm machine. Still waiting now...soon I think... I'm mad at myself for the weekend for not doing enough homework so I have to make up for it this week...no more slacking off, no more drugs too would help. I feel more motivated today for sure...and it's sunny so that's nice. It's gonna rain for the rest of the week, today I should do whatever i need to do with my scooter. I don't think I have unpleasant dreams lately so that's good.

      Last night Shine was alot of fun, gay people are fun to party with. Me anthony and annie danced the whole time, got kinda hot at times but I got a mini skirt and boots so it's alright for me. Annie wore long sleeves, crazy. We got so drunk and went to eat pho really drunk. Got home around 5 am. Today woke up late...just lazed around the whole day, not too productive. Annie was supposed to go yoga with me but she was late...so I was kinda pissed. I was just kinda down today, prob from popping on the weekend. I feel so unmotivated now, and thinking of quitting art school at times. I feel like I suck, I can't get the result that I want and I'm so irresponsible because I just partied the whole weekend away. And I can't do any work at Nathan's for some reason. Tomorrow gotta start working on stuff...Lynn's leaving on wed, we are supposed to have dinner tomorrow? Who knows...flaky people...

      Friday night Gip got me and nathan and him tickets to see Kill Bill, very good show, I love it~ and I wasn't expecting much in the beginning. I love the blood coming like a water hose. Then we checked out daddy'o for a bit, it sucked so we left right away to club 23 west, where Gip wanted to go in the first place. After talking to that funny etarded jap guy with broken English, me and Nathan decided to pop a bit. Anthony dropped by breifly cuz he thought the people were horrible and left. Me and Nathan just found them funny, all weirdly high on whatever they were on. It was alright but Gip wanted to leave 2am, earlier than I thought and after we went to buy beer at tsui hung village to drink more at Nathan's. Partied til around 6 am. Sat I took work off. Slept til late. Went to Janice's bday at Milestone's, it was nice to see her, John, Steve, Kelli, and Allen. I don't see those people much, a little intimate gathering I guess. After that, me and Nathan went to watch sick and twisted animation festival. There were funny parts but it's not that great anymore I find, because there are always repeats so I feel like I was watching last year's show. Then we went back home. Today I worked, kinda moody...I was lucky cuz going to and leaving from work wasn't raining. Janice S. came in today, before she left she gave me a silver coin thing, with the word dream on it, and moon and star pic on the other side. That's nice of her, and I hope she will get well from her lung parasites that got in while she had ammonia previously. I cleaned out all the charity shoes, so much and so dirty...there were 3 garbage bags of them. Tonite I might go clubbing cuz it's long weekend, yay~

      Today's class people were so critical, harsh, deep, and intellectual in the critique. I don't even want to put my work up there some day. I don't even wanna comment on anything, especially that I already have problem doing public speaking. After school, me and Nathan went to eat korean shabu shabu in downtown, it was a bad deal compare to what we had in richmond. Then we had a yummy desert (green tea parfait) and talked and walked around and talked...it was nice, talked about nice memories.

      Yesterday went to lecture...nothing special...went to bank, chapters and bought "border crossing" an art magazine. Cleaned my bike little bit finally, went home started on doodle drawing. At night Nathan came to get me and we went to watch "lost in translation" (cheap movie night). It was good movie but it's kinda those slow drag on movie and it seemed quite long. I slept over his place after. Today we went to eat um...gyro? Then he drove me to work. Lotta people called and came wanting to bring clothes...I got a gsus pink zip up at work, not bad. Walked to skool...class critique...tired me here now. Yesterday Nathan gave me his old palm pilot and that was sweet of him. Then Johnny came back from hk and told me he got me a digital camera, so me happy about this :) that's thoughtful of him too. Nice friends, eh? I dunno if I'm doing any good to Nathan if I remain close with him. I just don't want to make things hard for him in the end, but I know we want to be close still.

      Yesterday went to lecture...nothing special...went to bank, chapters and bought "border crossing" an art magazine. Cleaned my bike little bit finally, went home started on doodle drawing. At night Nathan came to get me and we went to watch "lost in translation" (cheap movie night). It was good movie but it's kinda those slow drag on movie and it seemed quite long. I slept over his place after. Today we went to eat um...gyro? Then he drove me to work. Lotta people call and came wanting to bring clothes...I got a gsus pink zip up at work, not bad. Walked to skool...class critique...tired me here now. Yesterday Nathan gave me his old palm pilot and that was sweet of him. Then Johnny came back from hk and told me he got me a digital camera, so me happy about this :) that's thoughtful of him too.

I just don't want to make things hard for himin the end, but I know we want to be close still. I guess we'll see how things go.

      Aw thanks nathan for posting the drawing, I really like it too~ this digital class is so stupid, I'm just doing homework for other classes and of course surfing on internet.  Hope to get out soon, nathan's picking me up with tony's van and we go get a phone for him. I was super lazy yesterday at least I made myself do a drawing of him.

      slep 10 hrs woke up all tired. I dreamt that my previous teacher jonathan was hitting on me in class, put his arm around me all the time and told me that he loved me. Erm kinda embarrassing and freaky, and my classmate aldriee was beside me chatting with me. anyhow back to reality, I scootered to nathan's place, couldn't get camera to do project today. So tired, and pretty much napped there and watched tv until tony came to lend us the van for the week cuz he's going to vega. nathan drove him to airport I dropped my bike off at home and he came picked me up so we went to richmond to eat all u can eat hotpot. It was good quality and cost $18 per person, pretty good but got too busy and service was bad. Then went to get bubble tea, was gonna go visit steve's store, he not open. now we back here.

      Yesterday went to massage and sea salt with nathan, it was nice, some china women worked on us...sea salt made me really smooth and helped my eczema, but I'm not sure about taking the bath there. I thought about old people soaking in there. Then we walked a long way on kingsway...finally found a place to take bus back. Me and Nathan took bus for first time wow. Then we were fucking tired and lied around. We got close again. I drew him with chinese ink and rice paper, it turned out alrighty. He made alot of noises and snapped alot, kept me up for long time, me cranky and I had to go sleep in other room.  Went to work today...can't those old men stop terrorizing young girls like me? It's scary! They might have a wife but they think they might be able to score with a young girl. During break, I tried to get mini dv from av, and they said they had one earlier but by the time I got there it was gone, wtf. Now I prob can't do my fucking project and twins are gonna be quite busy these days. I went to the beach to do some test for my embodied drawing project...poked at it in the sand and water, people prob thought I was weird. I think I'm getting stood up tonite again. Man, I wish I have a car, scooter is just not good enough. Weather's getting cold too. I'm unsure about my work...my boss hates working there, things don't get organized and cleaned, gross binders with ripped papers of contracts. It's an embarrassment how ghetto things are. Since she was gone there was a lot of updating to do and she hasn't finish doing it. I thought she's super busy, but she's partly busy playing sports and stuff. It's not a good place to work at, I realize. She just puts it off and hope for us to eventually do all the clothes for her. I should be trying to make more $ while I still have the time but I don't wanna be stressed about problems that I should not have. I'm tired now...

      after drawing that model intensely with contour pen drawing, I don't know if I like that hard edge anymore, it takes so much concentration. I really like the look of clean black edge though. I also like that kind of loose charcoal style drawings as well, when u draw it's so free, the lines can be redrawn over again. I just don't feel as pressured. I'm actually really motivated to do alot of drawings now, just wanna draw as much as I can because I realize how shitty I am, I can't draw much from my head. I guess I didn't end up going to Nathan's, I hope he will be happy to see me tomorrow. Things suck for him but it can be worse ;) I feel I am now so busy nowadays, so it's time to work on myself and hard at skool...

      yesterday worked, school had critique of our presentation of our final project. They ended up giving me more ideas when I wanted people to help me decide. After me and twins went to sonar, there was a dj battle upstairs. A lot of people for a small space. Went downstairs, met a jamaican guy and his friend (Nathan no worries, I want nothing with them). One was talking about how nice Jamaica is, the beach the weed the parties...I hope to go there some day. The other guy just talked about club scene here. Think I drank a bit too much cuz I felt dizzy on the way home. Twin's car had problem, sounded funny.  This morning they had to get it towed to repair. Went to class today, Richard made us sit there and listen to him read from a book on those critical analysis like signified and signifier and hard to understand stuff. I am totally not absorbing any of that crap. It's hard to read itself already. then we drew a model dressed in latino style with latin music. I'm tired today dunno why, me tired now.  Nathan not happy maybe I should go visit him tonite. Not sure... later

      My dot is hurting my stomach :(  I stopped doing stuff and kept looking at miami. My dinner was an odd one...we had soup base that has spaghetti on the side to eat with. We also had pan cooked fish it was good. The soup had tomato, parsley, clams, fish, celery...etc. The colours and the sea food made me thought of miami.

      Last night I couldn't sleep...too much thinking in my project and the trip, so couldn't fall asleep til 6am. Fortunately, I came up with alot of ideas for my project. Then I had to get up at 9:30 to go to work at 11. I worked with Anthony today cuz Wendy's in HK right now. During my break I dropped by at salvation army to look for a table for my project but I actually found a retro adidas bag for $3!! It's a big one too, red and dark blue, the zipper was broken but I fixed it on the spot. What a great find!! I also got a Delite cd for $3 but when I heard it I thought it was too...80s90s...I only like that one song anyways. O wellz...  Came home and I just try to do some homework tonite and couldn't resist but look at vacations. I had to write an artist statement ugggh...it's not really that bad... but I gotta look at it in fresh eyes another day. I hope I can make it through the semester. Almost there....Just these few days are most important.

      Today woke up early but twins slept in...so I could have slept longer. Checked out downtown future shop, no more free tickets...o wellz...went to skool, drew a guy in some kewl masks he made, one is a bird and the other is a goat...we had to draw a narrative out of it and I keep relating it to some kinky fetish or something weird. After class, was gonna go home and anthony called and he was pissed...he parked next door in the back of work and they towed it. So twins was nice enough to drive me to get it for him. We went to downtown but ended up at 1st ave. Bad luck for him shitty...  About the trip I dunno where to go, have to wait til Nathan's answers. He might find a cheap all inclusive hotel in mexico from his parents. We'll see...well I was looking into Miami but I think clubbing would be a problem for us...

      Yup worked today...I already went early but the bus on broadway took 15 min to come when it's supposed to take 5! I got there right a bit just passed 1pm...yeah cuz my boss had appointment and told me not to be late. Then twins came we went to the thai restaurant for dinner. In class, we had to do projection drawing...just fooling around...but I did a drawing for my other class so that's a good usage of time for myself. I did a drawing related to my scooter video.

      Couldn't resist but went to see Scary Movie 3 with Nathan tonite eventhough I should be doing my work. It was funny at first but wasn't much in the end. Then we talked in the car for an hour in front of my house, it was nice, but started cuz I was being moody.  Found a quote I like:  "I don't have a lot of respect for talent.  It is what you do with it that counts.." Martin Ritt

      I forgot to mention that next semester there is a hip hop humanities class, how kewl is that? Gord said I should use computer as drawing tool, don't do more superflat works like everyone else. I thought, like music, it's better when there is something new and nothing is bitten. But the school makes me bite stuff and do my required research for any work that I do. O well I'm not an artist anyways.

      Yesterday I was at skool from 9am-7pm, and I finished editing my documentary video in one day (less than 6 hours), so I'm proud of myself :) Today is sunny? What the... and now I don't have my scooter... Yesterday was talking to Nathan about where to go in xmas...so stayed up looking at where to go for good price...it's nice to dream about something. Last night I dreamt that I went on a trip and then cuz I had to work the next day I didn't go to this all night street party with my friends and it turned out to be really good so I was really pissed off no one called me to go. I remembered Jenny was at a club, she dressed like shit and saw some really big boob hot chick and told me she's gonna go pick her up...and then I forgot, but I remembered some owl hit someone straight on. Anyhow this is ridiculous.

      Friday night went to see christopher lawrence with anthony, when we got there I realized I forgot my tickets at home so we had to go all the way back but we got there before 1 am so it's alright. He came on pretty late. It was not a bad night but last week was more fun. Then we couldn't resist and I did 1/4, he took a very tiny chunk out of it, powdery....um he couldn't sleep that night!! What the heck. Anyhow we partied til 4 but wasn't as crazy as next week. I still have to work the next day at 11 though. Nathan came to have lunch with me at work, and he brought me the presents. Then he came to pick me up and we had dinner at tropika in downtown. It was nice meal and eventhough he was broke he paid. Then we shopped around a bit. We went back and watched fast and furious 2. The next day we ate at crystal square, yum yum. We went to metrotown for bluenotes cuz I had 25 % coupon. It was really busy at the mall bc of xmas. Then I came home and tried to do a bit of work.  Today the files in my partition at school were all screwed up and I thought I was so dead. Luckily I just had to add extensions. Now i go work on my thang...

      Today I went to the doctor's to get medicine for my skin. Then I went to safeway to get it and it came out to be like $72!!!!! So I ask them to give me half which came out to be $40 :( still pretty steep for medicine. I think it's more than enough for me I don't know why doctors always prescribe so much cream for me. While I was waiting for medicine, I went to salvation army and bought a red and white retro ski jacket for $4, and it fit me pretty good, so that was good find. And I found some coloured bamboo dinner mats for 99 cents each, so I got 5 of them. I was thinking of doing paintings on them perhaps...haha...I washed them and the colours came out so maybe not a good idea for dinner. Also, I went to insurance place, calculated amount for scooter insurance, so it's better off that I insured later. Bye bye scooter u can stay warmer in the garage now... I'll miss u~

      Today I think I wasted my drawing time this afternoon. Then I started to be down...cuz I have a presentation tomorrow and I have like nothing to show! I heard most people didn't have enough to show anyways. Luckily, the exercise today at the other drawing class can be a piece for that presentation. I really like it too... and I need to make more of that kinda stuff. It's the maniupulated crazy newt, I made it into a narrative that is from top to bottom on one big page...which I happened to have. I think I have to drop the idea of little red riding hood, cuz that class is about moving onto next projects, but I suppose I can do something similar to that... I like Junko Mizuno's work, the cute girls that kill or do dark stuff... like gloomy bear... I read about gloomy bear, Chax, the artist feels that stuff toys are weird bc in reality bear kills, so in his work there's alot of questioning about the "norm." He's more than just a cute cartoonist. I like dark humour, so I should try to do more more MORE...c'mon stop lying in the bed the whole day!! Lazy ass... but yeah I was upset to hear what the "miu goo" said about my education right now, it doesn't feel good to confirm that I only get by in school eventhough I know that myself. Also, knowing that maybe this degree is not gonna be useful to the max... u know makes me feel unmotivated and disappointed. Anyhow tomorrow I have to registerat 7:30, so I will do more drawings then.

      Today wasn't raining at first, so I was gonna take scooter then started pouring and I was too late for bus, so I took the scooter in that horrible nightmare once again. It made me to be in a pretty bad mood.  Then I had to go with anthony to the fortune teller, she's called "Miu Goo." We waited so long. Anyhow she is supposed to ask "see fu" to get answers, u would ask her something and she sings to get answers and then she tells you. On her business card, she even offers mun mai, I think it's something like you can get someone who is dead that u wanna talk to and they possess her for a bit to talk.  Generally: I have a pretty good life, luck is good. Next year I'm ok too.  My luck will really start after 2 years, when I am 27...28 chinese year.  Love: She said I always meet people that I don't end up liking and the ones that I wanna meet don't like me or something. It's because I have dead aborted baby ghosts that are in my way. It's because of the month I was born in which attracts them. My parents at home helps keep them away a bit (she didn't know if my parents together or not). I can pay her $30 to get rid of them (hmm....I will have to think about that). I have toh fah also, not sure if she said for next 2 years or something? She asked me if I like girls (!!!), and I said I like guys and she said if I go with girls next 2 years would be no good, but with guys good, so it's my choice. (So I'm a bisexual now??) Be with older guys. Be with people who are ox, chicken, rat, rabbit.  School/career: I'm working and in school but both are so so whatever, nothing very good. I might not do what I'm studying now in the future. I don't need to work hard, do stuff where I just sit to do, like office or drawing? I am good with business, and I should do it related to water, such as restaurant, or maybe even art, but definitely not real estate, something related to soil.

      hmm I dunno if things can be kept good with nathan...we'll see...he's coming back tonite with 2 more hats for me yay. I dunno when to see him cuz me busy and it's rainy and far and all that. I dunno if inside me I still dispise him for what happened... today lecture during lunch time Ken Gregory, it was about a program called Max, where he can do programming stuff without the programming. He likes to make sound that's not from a commercialized instrument. Then Julie made us go to his work shop at 1:30 and it went on for 3 hours!! It was so long and it was too tecky for me I just wasn't really into it. But yeah it can do amazing stuff... I went home on my scooter in the pouring rain, even with a poncho on, I was pretty cold and it was windy. I was driving super slow like 20- 30 km/h on the bike routes. There was a fucking car that should have stopped for the stop sign but she turned on me, lucky I'm careful I just slow down to make sure that rich bitch wouldn't hit me. I honked at her and she just looked at me, I hate bad drivers! (sorry twins haha, as long as u don't kill me I'm kewl) I was all grumpy and shit when I got home. I don't think I will renew my license since it will probably snow next week or something. Back to stupid old bus, I hate it too. I'm a hater today.

I hope people won't find me talking shit about them on my blog, or my mom finding bad shit in my room if I die suddenly. Anyhow...Nathan messaged me and said he's broke so no presents for me except for the key chain... I worry about him again not having $.  Shit this morning I forgot to bring my shit to school, cds for burning, my mini dv tapes, and forgot to upload my homework of voice over and storyboard.  Stupid me!!  I only slept like 4 hours or less last night...couldn't sleep... hate waking up... Annie called me at like 3:30 am, wtf... but it's all good.

      I just talked to nathan who's in TO right now. We talked for an hour and we had a good conversation. I'm glad he finally feels better now and he's gonna get me gifts :D. I'm glad I feel good after talking to him now rather than disliking him like last week. I hope he can prove to me he's changed. Today I'm just trying to get homework done at home...I slept so much, woke up at 3pm, then tried to write the stupid review for my classmate's cheesy video (tough ok?). Got bored and napped for another hour or more...to punish myself I have to do more work now cuz I prob can't sleep now anyways.

      Well I haven't wrote for a week mainly because of Nathan. So I haven't seen or talk to him since last sunday but I will probably talk to him when he comes back from TO. I know he means well always but I don't think he can handle himself very well when he gets upset. Or perhaps I'm just too picky and get annoyed at everything. Now it does feel kinda nice because I don't have to get frustrated or have to feel that there is an attachment. I still care and of course I wonder how he is but I guess I was pretty mad at him too. I was pretty turned off. In the beginning of the week I felt kinda loner and depressed. I felt like I wanted friends that are as diverse as I am, like a rainbow not red/blue. I guess it's lonely to be as unique as I am haha. I'm ok now but it was just a short period of sadness. mmm....anything interesting this past week? Tuesday I was gonna go to Lisa's bday at Lotus with Annie but it was close because of rememberance day! So ended up at Wild Coyote spontaneously. It's actually alright there, pretty mixed crowd, some trashy people. I finally get to check it out. There was booty contest too, hmm I dunno if that voluptuous short mama who called herself as "little precious" is sexy or a ho...more ho I think. Then Bishop dropped by and started doing a show, and everyone just stopped, they just stand there not watching him and not even bopping their heads, and half the people left the dance floor. Then Bishop started saying where he is from and what he has done and dissed the crowd. The black dude with him was trying to throw cds and some girls were covering their heads and no one reached for them. I think maybe one or 2 walked up and gently took it from the guy. Then a black dude rapped for a short period of time and they stopped. It was very amusing, never seen anything like that. I guess people just wanna go there and grind. Thursday went to sample sale with twins in the morning. It was in a unit with other wholesalers and they have lotsa other sample sales. Anyhow that one we went to sucked and went into another store. I ended up spending another $60 on 3 items....sigh. I felt bad so twins said they treat me to eat, so I brought them to the Mouse and Beans for Mexican food. We rushed cuz I had to go to Yoga with Annie at Open Door on Main street. First time is free, it's ok there...don't think I'm gonna join. Then i shouldn't have gone to eat with annie cuz spend more $$ and I should be doing homework. I got tix for Mark Farina at Bar none for Friday night. Friday night I changed plans. Sold the 3 tickets at Barnone, earned $15. Then went to Sonar with twins, cuz there's these 2 trance djs that night. Met up with Jamieson (finally get to party with him outside of rave), Tony came too cuz he called me earlier that night...On jai those guys were there...and Anthony came later....at the same time Oli came in and he was hanging out with On jai, whoa I haven't seen him in ages, that was huge surprise. Then Jen finally came with Jay, Karen, those girls. They bought shooters and drinks and I got soooo wasted. O yeah the trance was so good I couldn't resist and did 1/4, everyone so high there, they were all clapping and shit. Upstairs was pre party for ghetto blaster, some breaks and somewhat funkier stuff than downstairs, but b4 the djs czech played some breaks too. I had a good night and eventhough I had to work today, it was worth it. Yeah I woke up still kinda drunk which sucked and I felt gross and tired. Tonite I just stayed in trying to do some work it's gonna be a hella busy week. Yeah Wendy has such bad attitude at work sometimes...she just drop/throw bags/clothes at customers and she didn't smile at the customer the customer was giving her bad looks and she said "what," and then the customer turned around and said "what" and left all pissed off. I'm not gonna argue with her about it, I'm scared of her and her fucking attitude, and it's very inappropriate to treat customers like that unless they did something really bad. Anyhow enough said I get back to my work.

      Yesterday work was craaazy! Sales was so good, never been this good for long time. But I don't know if i like it when it gets that packed in a little store like that. OK bc of my little video problem, Nathan went to his friend, Ryan's place with me because he has all the equipment. We were gonna give up and then we actually made it work. I was being cranky to Nathan again and I didn't realize he wanted to go home quick cuz he was feeling sick. I was mad at him for expecting me to know but I guess I should have known and think of him more. I guess I'm mean to him but I can't help it. And then Gip comes in and tells me shit like how come I'm treating nathan bad, that upsets me. When I went home last night I went to Mike's birthday in a hotel room in executive hotel. I don't really know the people maybe except ben. It was stupid and I was tired and I thought I was getting sick so someone there drove me home. I thought I was sick probably because they were smoking lots there. Right now I'm doing the video at school. tonite will go see qbert + other's  can't wait.

      Ok back to the Seattle trip... After Henry Arts, we went to downtown to go the Seattle Art Museum. On the way there were funky shops but hella expensive and adult stores/strip clubs. One sign was so funny, the place is called Lusty Lady, and it says "you scare the pants off us." Ok back to the museum. The show was alright, some good stuff and some kinda lame.  There was this one where this korean dude is in 3 tv with different angles. He was rapping a song from Beastie Boys and mimick the three that would rap interchangably. I read the statement, and something about being aware of the fact that he's asian and mimicking Beastie Boys who is american jewish and they rap like african american. Then something about buddhism is involved (well I guess he gives that quality too). I don't agree with that. Rap music doesn't belong to black people in the first place. That statement is WHATEVER. There was an OJ Simpson trial in flat flash animation, I sat on the bench and it was actually supposed to be part of the piece and I wasn't supposed to, oops. The best part was probably checking out the stuff upstairs. They had ancient art, such as egytian antiques, ceramics from china in different dynasties, renaissance painting, religious painting from 500 years ago...and famous artists such as Jackson Pollock, Rothko, Joseph Cornell...There was a huge painting from 100 years ago, I forgot the artist, but it's a storm scene by the land with light coming through the clouds. It was great to see those works up close, I wish I could spend more time with some of them but of course I wanted to run around to see everything.  Anyhow I didn't get to shop much. I had lunch at Westview Mall again, cuz Paul needed to exchange $. I wish there were more people I know better there. I'm ok with a few but I hate trying to buddy up with people cuz I'm in a foreign place. We got back around 10om pretty late.  Today went to shoot video with twins...after i tried to put it in the computer, couldn't. Damn, realized after talking to Gip that his camera is from asia so format is PAL, not NTSC. He screwed me over, man. I was pretty mad but luckily I only talked to him online so he couldn't see how mad I was. Nathan is helping me out to solve the problem, so cross my fingers hope I can get it done.  We had life drawing today again. I showed my teacher my work, and he wants me to draw bigger. I dunno maybe he's right maybe he's too opinionated. I kinda lost some motivation for that project. He told me to forget about the book format...why? I dunno if I should listen to him I don't know what to think. Then I think about the other project that i have to work on and I feel a bit overwhelmed right now. I got around a month to get things done.  I'm tired...later

      It's pretty late right now but I still wanna write this. Seattle trip was pretty goood. I saw in the bus with a guy I didn't know called Matthew, chatted a bit. By about 12:30 we got to the Henry arts Gallery.  James Turrel- He's fucking amazing, a living artist whose work is going to be embedded in art history I think. I wish I could stay at the show longer to enjoy his work. Very trippy and meditative. The show is called "Knowing Light":  "Spread": a blue room in a wall that is illuminated with blue light, and the audience can sit there and be consumed by light and colour. I thought of meditation at the time because of the calmness, and after, I read the programs guide and there are meditation sessions held there and in the "Skyspace."  "Skyspace": an outdoor circular room which people can sit on the bench along the wall to look up at the open oval shape on the white ceiling. Sometimes birds would fly across closely. It has a calmness to it as well.  The dark room with white and red light: He plays with optical illusion here. My classmate went up to the frame that's not part of the black to put her hand through to see if it's a wall or not. Then she bumped into the black wall on the side because there was an illusion of how the room is structured.  The TV screen: I thought it was a tv size screen with different colours projected on the white wall. Then I realize it's actually a hole in the wall with supposingly a tv inside that space to create those changing colours.  Another cool big thing there is the Karaoke Pods by Lee Bul. She built these futuristic car look-a-likes with private karaoke inside. There's headset, video screen and microphone. So u can sing without anyone hearing you. The videos are large projections on the walls also. They are of driving, korean girls in school uniform hanging out in a forest, and some buildings.   Polly Apfelbaum+ Poe White show is called "Hover"  Polly A.- Flying hearts- made with dyed velvet..quantity and delicacy of the strips make this piece  Poe W.- Grotto- thread, collaged silk screen paper maybe threads hung from high ceiling, hang a bunch of those oval collaged shapes in different colours. The quantity and colours in this piece touched me.  The Gladiator Nun: Fellini's Women sexual drawings, exaggeration and comical, very different style in how it's drawn  Red marker coloured tape that is stuck together pinned with insect pins on wall to create a shadow. Geometric, dimensional grids.  I'm really really tired now so I will try to write more tmr to report the rest. This will have to go into my digital journal as well for my diva class. This is it for the Henry Art Gallery.  Today I had critique of my doodling work. I got more direction now and hopefully I will have a successful piece in the end.   I also had bad and good talks with Nathan. I have been frustrated with him and talked about it and I was sad cuz he thought I wanted to leave him for good or move on or something. We talked more at night about it and it was a good talk, it's been awhile. Maybe I do want to move on but that doesn't mean I want to stop caring for him. I wish him happier and more confident.   Tomorrow I will talk about the Seattle Art Museum. me berry tired.

      Today tried to do some of my video... it's not bad with 3 screens but it became kinda grainy after rendering. Maybe it's output problem anyhow it bugs me maybe I have to input everything again? Gawd... Today we learned flash very very slowly. Almost useless. Tomorrow I'm going to Seattle for field trip should be good :) I took my scooter today to skool for 9am class, it was doable, tmr I just need to wear snowboard pants haha. Maybe I can actually scoot the whole year, now that's  hardcore .

      Halloween went to sonar first with nathan and twins. Most people dressed up there and they played breaks but I can't explain something was lacking there. But I saw Homer and Marge, bandaged person, and of course the very unorginal school girls. The britneys/jap skool girls are everywhere (from what i hear of other places too) like maggots. Anyhow we left around 1 to the dnb event at picadilly pub, it was better, small venue tighter vibe, some old faces and the usual dnb crowd. Terrence from South park won cuz he showed us his ass on the stage. He had a big flat face on his head. The spray can should have won instead. Ended the night around 3-4. The whole time I was thinking about Spooky, this is first year I missed rave on halloween, felt kinda down about it. Heard my friends say they didn't have fun, prob bc of their own incidents. Through friend's friends some said good? O well it's better off if I didn't go anyways. Johnny said he's quitting again, this time sounds pretty serious...me will party my ass off in winter break for sure! 7th level here I come. Ran some errands on sat cuz Nathan had the van, we hung out in richmond for a bit too that was nice. Stayed home tried to do work, today work and then tried to do more work tonite too. This week is hip hop expo...I just got tix to qbert...I wanna see other shows but maybe it's too pricey all together. I don't knwo if I should take scooter in the morning it's pretty damn cold. I dunno, can't decide. I hate bus.

       s sad and lonely but it's ok cuz today is shopping time. Today had lunch with trevor that was nice cuz I haven't seen him in ages! Wilson called me from HK...talked about parties....haven't for awhile..so that was nice too!  Today is....boxing day!  boxing day find...  vintage bag $6 2 sets of hair ties $.75 each set sunglasses from Pharsyde $10 Short green punky army colour skirt for $13 Hurley red/dr blue half fingers arm warmer $10 fat shoelaces $1.80  ..then I have some shoe dilemas....if u can help me decide leave me a msg in the comment :)  These are shoes from Aldo, they are only $25...they are actually brown with beige, suede. I couldn't decide if I should get these or the same style but with black and red stripe, so I got these.     Then, I found kewl unique beige fabric  urlLink etniesplus , and supposingly half price (psychology?). They are not available in US, only few stores carry in canada, and rest are in japan. I got them for $62 ($70 including tax), no question these are ones that I will love to love. And I still love the phat shoe style!       I was gonna exchange the boots for the black and red but they wouldn't do it today cuz too busy. I went home and tried on with that skirt....look, they are so damn cute....     So do you think I should buy another pair of black and red ones or trade them in, or just keep these? The black ones would look great with my black capris though! But yeah usually I don't like getting same style in 2 colours.

But he told me that I shouldn't let Nathan take me on trips bc we are not together anymore....I should be the one to say no bc he loves me and would do anything for me....I should let him move on.... This makes me sad...I wanna talk to N about it but he's probably sleeping now...

Karen's card    me on beach doodling?    me riding scooter with doodles flying behind me?  Peggy's card   me surfing with santa claus hat and snow??    me on beach with doodles  Another thing is I got a surprise for Nathan, I think he will be very happy.

      Tonite movie (lord of the rings!) was delayed cuz Gip had to do installs. Anthony bailed out on me cuz he had a dinner to go to but I already got a ticket for him. So Shab got an extra friend to go. When we got there at around 8:30 looking for exchange of a different time of show, the next show was sold out already, the next available show is at 10:45. The movie is frigging 3 and half hour long, so shab's friend was saying he couldn't cuz of work tomorrow. Anyhow they were gonna just go in first, but came out and couldn't do sitting at the front. So we did get the 10:45 show, but Shab felt bad and shit like that...anyhow went to Starbucks, then shopped briefly. There were massive people, kinda annoying. Gip said he likes those wristband but don't like the nike logo so I took him to bluenotes. He bought a pair and we shared it, isn't that nice. Movie was looooong, especially the ending really dragged on. I was happy that he finally got rid of the ring but after that it's just too long.  When Gip drove me home of course we talk about school and stuff. He thinks I'm creative but outside of school, it's just that I'm not in the time when I know what to do yet. I'm glad to get encouragement from him cuz I need it for my lack of confidence. Since he's older and more experienced, I hope his words are right. O yeah I got Nathan's presents...thanks!! The Lululemon gym bag is not expensive for what it is but not cheap either...maybe not something I would feel right spending on? I won't say no more cuz I accept anything as is from Nathan. What u think, Nathan? I should just be happy with what I have right, like the expensive palm? O yeah the tag and receipts are there...u really want me to know the price?

      Tonite dinner was bad...I think my mom triggered my dad on something little but he had already built up problems wit her inside. He exploded and made her cry at dinner...and I don't know why I started crying a bit too, u know how other people can affect you. There were things that I wanted to say but couldn't get it out of my mouth. She left the table for awhile...so yeah anyhow the whole vibe was bad.  Last night went clubbing with Annie to the Cellar for breaks, and then off to Stone Temple. Saw some old raver faces. Got drunk met some people. Bought mc d's, and parked by my elementary school to go pee outdoors...we ran back inside the car ate mc d's and the light in the car was still on. We parked right in front of a car front to front, and I saw some smoke coming out of the other car's window! So I slid down on my seat and we quickly drove away, how embarrassing!

We had snake soup again..with other expensive items. I'm not gonna be working much this week cuz there are no shifts for me since it's xmas and store's business has been bad. Suddenly I'm actually...free! But I will try to utilize the time wisely...

      Last night went asian clubbing, first to Atlantis, it was packed but people are so young there, lotsa hoochies. Then we had to stop by at the Brix to treat someone a drink so I got a shooter called Soho, tasted like lychee yum yum. Then went to Luce, saw old friends, got free shots left and right. Got pretty drunk...good times. May kept wanting to leave but her car is far away...so she had to stay til we wanted to go which is like 3 something am. This white chick was dancing on the bar, she was so hammered she was touching everyone, girls and guys, she even gave me the clit licking face. Anyhow she fell from the bar towards the bartenders, pretty shocking and amusing! Anyhow since we had to drive Tina, I didn't get home like til 5am, and after the mcdonald drive thru. I went home and I slobbered a large fries all by myself.  Today is meh.

      Slept 13 hrs and today just hung out around surfing net and played with the palm the whole day. Still feel floaty and tired. Felt kinda down today, I dunno if it's the Vancouver weather or just feeling lonely? No more play and back to work. I guess try to find out about snowboarding now... Realized we spent so damn much out of the 5 days, it's pretty crazy. We didn't even pay for the plane tickets. I like those surfing magazines. I didn't realize there is that spiritual side to surfing. Hmm when is my next trip?

      Continue from what I wrote of Miami...  Day 2 friday We drove to close to west palm beach but I don't know what that beach is really called. We met up with our instructor, Geoff, who likes to talk alot but a funny surfer dude. He said the water was perfect and we came at the right time. Water wasn't as warm as I expected but not freezing. We surfed on fun shape boards instead of long boards, something I haven't tried. I got on a little and so did Nathan, it was good times. I was dragged to the other side and it was deep and I tried paddling back big time, wasted so much energy and time on that and no one came to tell me that I should be more to the left. You can go to funky pix in the link section to see our pix.  After that, we went to take shower, ate at this latino place with people dancing in the front on Ocean Drive. We shopped a bit I believe? I think we shopped way too much that we ran out of time to rest for partying at night. We rested a bit but went over 12 pm, cuz Mr. Holland (the hotel front desk guy who is black and from Holland) gave us some free passes for b4 12am.   Anyhow we went to Crobar, paid $25/person to get in, and not even the upstairs hip hop room. But the main room I think Edgar V was playing, music was good, crowd was whatever. Probably partied til 3 something and left.   p.s. Parking meter was a pain in the ass, no one really put $ in there and we were the only suckers that kept feeding it.  Day 3 Saturday  Had to return car today by 5, so we drove to little havana and ate at this cuban restaurant? I said largo instead of grande, pretty embarrassing. Then drove to downtown and purchased the palm and digital camera...see the last post... where we got ripped off. Shoulda went to circuit city instead :'''( Came back tried to find the car rental place, was getting frustrated.  Walked back, shopped...went to beach briefly in the evening, it was nice. Took a cab to go to a rave in town...it was a small party, seemed kinda empty, maybe shoulda went to Space in downtown, but at least I can say I've been to a rave in Florida. One room played breaks and the other played jungle, which clubs usually wouldn't play for sure there. The music was pretty good I have to say. People don't dance too much, the ones that do are usually pretty good. The latinas are good dancers. We left around 3 something, tried to find a phone nearby, and it was around a latino club, felt pretty odd to be there. Took cab home.   That day felt like a big time tourist that was out of place.  Day 4 Sunday It was pouring rain... tropical rain. We had brunch on Ocean Drive and went back to hotel to get umbrella and get changed, nothing's gonna stop us! When we went out again the water became puddles and I was walking in them in my sandals. We went to play pool, we are even. Walked around a bit...til 11 pm! I think we started to learn to take those electric bus that was only 25 cents. When we went back, we were gonna go out but fell asleep instead.  Day 5 Monday Last chance to go to the beach, went there in the morning... me and Nathan got upset a bit, I was sad. We went to buy my roxy luggage, but couldn't decide which colours, the pink or the red? After a long time finally took the red one. Went to internet cafe finally, shopped, ate on Lincoln at a nice restaurant and at least that place gives you what you should get for food. MMM lobster. Went back, got changed went to that internet cafe again. The football game was on the big screen. Got lured into free entry to go to some hip hop small club. It was something Mr. Holland would consider as ghetto. It was actually $20 for guys all u can drink and girls $10 all u can drink, and we paid that amount. Not alot of people, people started leaving when the dj played the latino stuff. Met some latina chicks, they were cool, one was a real dancer. This black dude was funny too. We and latinas left went to back door bambi at Crobar. It was gay night, Nathan got hit on big time, poor him not used to it. Blew last money there, with 4 drinks too. Got fucking ripped off on e, lucky I couldn't get more $ from the machine so we could get those girls e too. went home and fell asleep right away. Stupid tourists!  Overall: The weather wasn't constantly the greatest and I think we just went at the wrong time. South beach was really about tourism, bling bling, people watching, partying. Miami was very latin, downtown felt like it was venezuela. Food in South beach was mad over priced...the hotel was pretty cool. Walked alot to shop...my legs and feet were hurting. There were some upset times with Nathan but it wasn't as bad as I expected. We are stupid tourists. Right now I still feel like I'm floating like on an airplane.

      fawk can't copy paste chinese here for some reason grrr....  Today I could finally finished everything from school! That feeling was so great, it's like finishing up a really big project or something. I got off early and so I went shopping with Nathan again and was really really tired due to lack of sleep and too much walking.   Yesterday went shopping with Nathan went to the 3 stone sale again and bought some stuff, Nathan paid for it so that was nice (thanks!). The guy called him cheap for bargaining and he wasn't happy about that. We walked alot alot...I got a surprising haircut! We walked by a Japanese hair salon and so we went in and they only charge $25 for haircut and I just wanted to cut my bangs so that was $10. Pretty good for a stylish place. Now I'm dead sexy. Bought something from Bluenotes too, it was 20 % off everything... I don't wanna waste $ anymore...but I kinda want some heels.  Anyhow Anthony came to pick us up, he drove Nathan home and we were gonna eat and he realized that he left his bag at his place @_@. Anyhow we went to eat pho, twins called me wanted to drop off portfolio so they came too. Then Annie called and we went to shine but An couldn't go cuz he just made plans so he was choked. Annie went with Christine... I was iffy about going, there weren't many people prob cuz of exams and such. We stayed partied a bit and me and twins left around 12:30. Got home realized what I needed to do for the dvd cover wasn't just pressing the print button so I slept at around 3 or later. Had to wake up at 7:30-8am today...  Today critique of documentation...good stuff, no problemo. Lots of classmates complimented my hat and bangs, good stuff too. Met up with Nathan in dt, ate at The Mouse and Beans, then he bought a nice shirt for clubbing, but no luck with shoes. I was so damn tired, now too.... bus ride was damn long, they make me feel carsick a bit sometimes. I could finally have time to wash my hair now, yay I get to style my new hair. B4 I got the hair cut I used photoshop to see what it looked like and turned out quite like the real thing, u can check it out in funkypics in the link section.  I think I need to pack!

      Today worked...some people came in looking for clothes for their vacations, they are just as excited as I am. Went to the Three Stone warehouse sale and spent $75 ...yikes, but they were good stuff for good deal. Came home and just did research the whole night and chatted a bit. Nathan finally came back tonite, it was nice to be able to talk to him on the phone. I guess we are not going on boat cruise anymore... now I have to worry about what to wear in trendy Miami, have to dress for the catwalk or something, how stressful~

      Yesterday I rushed to passport office and I got that done and picking it up on the 10th. Then I was a bit late for my portfoliio presentation. Ric was pretty tough, and I wouldn't say it was the best... he asked me how I would grade myself I didn't really want to answer but I said b+ then he said he would give me b-. He looked at my life drawing and said eh...so so...>_ Yesterday after I went to work for a bit..and then went home and went online the whole night.  Today went to matrix to buy dvd, it wasn't as cheap as I was told but whatever. Worked...Natalie M came in and I found out she works at aeroplan so she's gonna help me find if there's seat space. Afterwork, went to school...now...and putting my movies on dvd on a late friday night. I gotta work tmr anyways so I don't need to party.  Boat cruises are surely cheap..but we are not staying longer... Sigh~  Alright I get out of here.

      Went to sonar with Annie and Christine... it was pretty dead when we got in, and later at least there were ppl dancing. We had fun but I think sonar on wednesday sucks now. I guess also people are studying for exams. Saw those 2 jamaican guys again, hung out a bit. Some fucking loser who danced really bad was trying to pick christine up and then he talked to me and said "btw, u r a good dancer but u need improving." WTF so I said whatever, and then he asked me for my name and I just gave him the hand. Now I'm all self conscious, but a c said don't listen to him. Outside of sonar there's this food stand, and we ordered one udon, man was it a good udon, that is the highlite of the nite for me. Meanwhile while me and annie stuffing out face, Christine kept getting hit by lotsa guys. I didn't wanna bother turning around to help her, I was just enjoying my noodles. The softness was perfect, the soup base was good and the beef was kinda sweet in a korean way...mmmm....we should have had 2, but those guys were getting too annoying.

      Yay I finally did my drawing presentation today and that was one that I worried the most. I think it went ok and seemed like Elizabeth liked it without saying that there were much problems with it. I'm soooo glad I'm done with that. Tomorrow's stuff I already packed into twins car, they are taking it in for me tmr cuz I have to do passport stuff, thanks girls :) Today surf shop called me from Miami, I still haven't discussed about the details with Nathan yet. hawo! Oh there he is on msn...

      Today I just pretended to be busy but fuct around online mostly.  Well I finally booked tix and hotel! All the seats are pretty much full...but hopefully we can change it later for a little penalty. The hotel was fine with it too. I asked them what was the summer promo they said it shouldn't be there anymore, and they said rate is $99 now, I said the next rate online are $95, they said I can just easily book it through them. I asked if the could do cheaper and they said $85 US, so I took it, good enough!  Tomorrow I have to do my presentation...and then thurday is portfolio interview...and try to get my passport....I hope i can get it but if not I'll stick with the citizenship card I guess.  There might be a lecture with John Fluevog on thursday so i might wanna try to go to that.  Nathan was with sasha today, so cute I could just imagine, and sasha sniffing the phone...hehe. I wanna meet her too.

      Check out my  urlLink folded-book  project. I didn't make the denim package but I sewed it close, and more sewing on the paper. I was unsure at first but was happy about when teacher thought it was sweet cuz it is so tiny. I love that book media class, and the teacher is awesome. After we put all the works in the display box, we learned how to do sewn binding european style. The reading I had to do was long but it was interesting because it was all about the history of hip hop, so I actually stayed up finish reading it the night before. In class, we watched half of an old skool movie but I didn't know the name of it. I haven't participate much in that class because it's not intimate enough for me cuz I have public speaking problem. Seems like it's usually the same few people talking, maybe the teacher should ask others to speak. I haven't been sleeping enough...today finally get to nap and relax but I kept getting woken up also. I need lotsa rest, more yoga and more parties! I am actually not as broke as I thought because I forgot I paid extra on my last bill by accident.

      I think the dream was true... I was lured into this mail I got today saying about some trip, so I called...and the whole phone call was super fuzzy so I couldn't hear them well. They just kept describing the stupid vacation (waste of my time), and asked for my credit card. I thought it was only a credit check but they actually charged me. I found out when they started saying some #s cuz my card was maxed out, so I was all confused and didn't understand. So they put me on the phone with this other guy, and he was a jerk, and asked why I wouldn't want it. I said is it possible to return $ on the card, he said yes, and then he kept asking why, and asked if I thought it was free, I said Yeah! Well so I said again I don't want to go through with it and put my $ back on the card, then we hung up. They better put it back otherwise I'd hunt them down like a badger!  Last night had dinner with Nathan to vancouver dine out, $25 for 3 course meal. On top of that we had wine so it was $16 on top of that. I thought it wasn't really worth it, cuz the food was not the greatest but still good. I got cranky too, and we were sitting beside other tables which I hate, no privacy.   Then I went to Plaza to see Infected Mushroom, it was a great show, dif peeps as usual, the hippies and the foreigners. Everyone was pretty hyped up there and the place was packed eventhough it was a sunday night. I ended up popping which I was intending to. I went with Bryan, Mayumi and Aki, and Aki gave the e to me for free. Bartender gave me free glass of water too. Saw some old friends, club 23 west ppl, and classmates. Good night, great djs. It's nice to see a party where most people are smiling and dancing hard to the music.  I feel down...I think it's the lack of sun...just feel some kinda dissatisfaction...sigh more months of dark days to come...like lord of the rings...

      "if you were very frightened by the ghost in your dream, then others will try to impose their will on you and you must be vigilant in order to stand up to it."  Yeah anyhow I had a nightmare...I was pretty scared...some ghosts in my bathroom and they were making toilets flush without me being able to see them. Then in the mirror I saw their reflection in the reflection of my pupil in the mirror. Then, we got this person to try to get rid of them and she was just starting to do the "performance" and they were screaming at each other when I got woken up by Wendy.

      Today after school went to eat with bryan and gip at this asian restaurant, gip thought was good I thought it was chinese food for white people. Then me and bryan went to main street to buy materials and I looked around the second hand and local designers shops, they gave me a lot of inspiration, if only I have a lot of time to make fun cool stuff (and I don't make them when I do have the time). Came home and really cleaned up the whole night. I got rid of so much stuff to give to charity, and then a few things for my friends perhaps. I have to do homework for sure!! Yeah I just don't clean up when I have time during the holidays, I guess I'm spontaneous...

      On sat went to nathan's after work. I waited for the renfrew bus for 45 min or more when it's supposed to be 15 min...they said the bus before was out of service, pisses me off, I hate bus. Anyhow we went to the pne for the chinese new year fair. Spent $60 there, sigh...came back...ate at Knight and Day at 2 am...I ordered fish and chips...bad mistake, it was oily and gross. Went back and watched Charlie's Angels til late. The movie is eye candy, I can't believe she kissed the freaky guy.  Sunday went to the lansdown fair with Francis, since it's the same shit, i didn't buy much. We just chatted afterwards cuz I was too full from the bubble tea. Talked to Sailor on phone.. strange that now I feel like I have to chat to people (not online) and I am not used to it. Today woke up at 2pm, nice...I need to replenish all the sleep that I have missed. I have my online class soon online...will be interesting...

      Yesterday I did movie extra work for first time for blade 3.I was pretty excited at first when they called me in the morning. Then the work was so long...I worked from 3pm- 6:30 am, soooo tiring....and the agency cuts all these fees from the pay so I end up with shit pay. It was interesting to see how movies are made, and the wolf was cool, it has remote controls for the facial movements. They put saliva stuff on the teeth and wet stuff on the nose to make it look real. 80 % of time I just waited around, I waited 4 hours until we went to the first scene..they shoot and wait another 10+ min for another shot, then they send use back to the holding and wait for long times. We had meal at 10:30pm, and the rest of the time it's just junk food and light finger food. When the juice came it was gone right away. I got to meet people and everyone's nice. Get and blabber mouth Luke was there. At least Luke and the old man kept people entertained. Then there's this 50 yr old guy who's smart and well rounded. He's the "discerning" type and gets a kick out of meeting us young people. He had too much energy for me, when I was tired he got a bit annoying at times. He thinks I'm an interesting character. Sigh money is so hard to make! Today I could exchange books but I know I could have got cheaper at the other place. Went to school and the reception was closed so the security was unable to gimme back my bus pass...grrr.... finally i can have some downtime for hw.

      :( tragic...lost my bus pass today, and it's only been half a month...these are times when u think life sucks, but o wellz there's nothing I can do.  Today dropped the drawing:ideas class with elizabeth...I figured that she will teach almost the same thing as the last semester. I feel bad for dropping though cuz there are not many people in the class.  Saw a snowboard today...brand new and price with binding is $230, that's not bad but the board is pretty plain for my taste. I'll look around a bit more...before the snow comes back...

      See funky pics in links...today had all u can eat hotpot with twins...ate for 2 hours! Before that they took me to Daiso, a store in the new Aberdeen center which is huge but barely any store opened. Anyhow everything was $2 in there...it's actually a pretty big store so that was kinda kewl and different. I only bought 3 things though.  I actually went to the anatomical class today so I'm in. Now i might kinda wanna drop the other drawing class...but I think it's too late and I dunno if it's what I want? After class today hung out with Bryan for a bit at a coffee shop then he started telling me stuff about his ex. Then twins came to pick me up and then it's the stuff that I wrote above. This is a disorganized blog.

Leave your name and where u r from and how u got here da da da...thanks!!  I forgot to say that I went to get my bangs trimmed and I was not happy with them...grrr makes me frustrated but can't do anything... it's too thin and it's not the style that I want!  Anyhow went snowboarding with Nathan and Sailor yesterday. Fan called me on sat night at 1am...flaky people...but anyhow I did bump into him there. If it wasn't for him, we probably didn't have to rent a car that day...it was $60 but better than taking bus and shuttle right? The condition is good eventhough it has been raining up there. It showered a bit but it was doable. We went to the pub for a break too. My gloves got wet and soggy by the fingertips..they were gross... it was fun but I think I was too easily tired.  This morning did ink drawing of model...now I'm waiting for the 5pm class...sigh...woke up at 6 to return car and drive back from nathan's place..cuz last night got too stoned to drive. I was gonna go home after the morning class but ended up looking at a book store and it's not really worth it for me to go home then. Ate nammer food and walked back here...hmm wonder if i should find a couch to nap here...

      On the thursday hip hop humanities class...  U know the class was funny...I think maybe including me only 3 ppl there like hip hop. A few were surprised with the content cuz they just thought it's a humanities class. This chick she first asked if this is the only humanities course...then when it was her turn to explain her reason to be there...she said she is not interested in hip hop and she took the wrong class. We started having discussion and she just walked off in the middle of it. It's gonna be an interesting class...  Book Media my teacher lets me go into wednesday morning class instead of thurs night so that's good that I don't have that fuct up schedule and don't have to be all tired. Cuz in the middle of the day, I crashed at Bryan's place trying to get rest but not really, while he's at school...so now that is not necessary. It's gonna be a very morningy semester, yikes.  Friday went to yoga...I think I'm out of shape...it was kinda tough and now my back sours. Nathan was supposed to go with me but he was late so he couldn't come in...stupid traffice and bad transportation. Poor him waited outside for me, then we went to eat dinner at Public next door, then we went to Oscar's book store to look at art books on sale. Didn't buy anything then went home...and.... went clubbing for anthony's bday...at the drink...funky house...it ain't bad... got hammered... me him twins and annie (for a bit)... partied til around 3:30-4... I gave him wristbands with skulls on them as present. I'm surpised we don't really know the people there at all... when the place used to be madison, there was a drink called whoozi in a mini jug that is blue. We got some of those in the end...they are good deals $9.25.  Tomorrow dunno if I should go snowboarding?? Cuz now the weather is warmer and it's been raining up there so it might not be worth it.

I got a fcuk cologne for him and it's 40 % off so I ended up buying 2 cuz they were cheap. I had lunch with Nathan at Milestones. Then went to fix my bike :) Came home and I got my reiki ebook for almost free! Today is freebie day for me.  Tomorrow is hotspring time can't wait!

      Yesterday went to see Nathan, we ate at the italian restaurant by his place which we never been before. It wasn't cheap but super yummy! Then we couldn't decide if we should go to the Grandmaster Flash/Arrested Development show at Atlantis, but we ended up going to line up to see what's up. Got there at 8:30 and I think we got in around 10-10:30. AD was mellow but good show still. Grandmaster Flash, well not my first time seeing him so I knew what to expect. It was good but we drank too much and got really tired too. We took cab home.  This morning woke up got mad at him again, I guess I have expectations still. I was gonna go fix my bike at Carter's, but no time cuz I had to do movie extra for the tv show Tru Calling at UBC. Got there before 11, and then ended tonite at 12 am, so it was a 13 hr shift. In the afternoon it was so cold and showered little bit. I almost backed out to leave when they wanted to cut down people, but I stuck with making $$. The scenes at night were outside too but it seemed less cold cuz I had my own jacket on and it wasn't windy anymore. The dude in the show was an idiot. There were 2 full rainbows in the sky, nice! It was weird that the people weren't asian this time, some were ditzy, some were nice, and some act like they are intellectuals. That's the thing with Asian people, most of them don't get philosophical all the time. I guess I'm not an intellectual but I'm not stupid, I just don't like to or need to think very hard and deep into everything and discuss it with people. I guess I get frustrated with the debates, I feel like it's argument, same thing with discussions at school too. me sleep me tired

      No one went to sonar with me on friday :'''( Saturday woke up and felt not very special...then I got my red bag $ from my parents which was good. Wendy at work didn't really remember my bday and thought it was Sunday. Twins came by and gave me my present, a roxy pink luggage make bag, and that's very sweet of them. Then Nathan and Gip came by too and we went with twins to Soupspoon for lunch which was yummy. Went home for dinner, cuz I didn't wanna have bday dinner this year, so much hassle. As usual it took longer to actually get to the rave than I planned to. It was somewhere east on Kingsway. When I got in, it was....let's just say I hated the crowd and I didn't even wanna pop. Little trashy high school kids from Surrey, and the rest are probably 40 year old nammers. Gip asked me what is this if it was a highschool dance. We found a niche that was barely acceptable, with a bit older crowd. I got really high at first. I mean I had fun and it was nice to have enough friends showing up for my bday but the party kinda sucked. People there were Nathan, twins, Anthony, Francis, Chris, Gip, Bryan, Johnny, Kiki, Jack, Sailor, Grace...Grace got me a Giorgio Armani perfume, expensive present. Bryan popped 3 and kept saying he still wasn't high but he actually was. In the beginning I wish the party would get busted and I could go to an afterhours, but it's hard to ask you friends to pay more to go somewhere else. We stayed til the end but I don't think I will ever go to a small rave again in Vancouver. The scene has moved on faster than me, it's horrible. Annie didn't come cuz she said Christine was caught drinking n driving.  After we went to Grace's place in Coquitlam. It was huge for an apartment and I thought rent wasn't cheap for coquitlam either. We had some G, I only had one cap but An took 2 and felt too dizzy. They were doing alot of rails til the time I left which was around 4pm. I didn't know Bryan was that hardcore but I know he has an addictive personality. So Grace, Danny, Bryan, John, Anthony, Tina and Dalton was there. I probably stayed up til 10am or so, took a shower and napped for 4 hours there. When I woke up I met Catalin, Danny's friend, and I looked like a mess. They were still banging music, spinning at that time, very noisy to me. I really wanted to leave but I had to wait til someone would leave so I could go to Nathan's with Anthony. I really needed some coddling. Then we watched satellite and at nammer noodles for dinner until Tony came and drove us home at night. I didn't feel like it was my bday, and I prob shoulda just went to Donald Glaude on Friday night instead. O well, it's the past.

      Woke up felt like I might get sick so I tried to do some yoga at home. Nice day had to get out with my scooter, so went to kerrisdale for london drugs and walked around for a bit. Then I met up with Bryan for coffee. Now I'm home, it was a cold ride. I dunno if it's warm but I feel warm hope I am not sick!!! With my luck, maybe I get sick with period on my bday. Need rest, and maybe go to sonar if anyone would go with me.

      Today I was supposed to go to lecture with twins but suddenly I got insurance for my scooter! I guess it's my bday present for myself or something. Then i rode to school to the lecture. The speaker was talking about some journey to the wild life environment and supposed to reach the indigenous people. After the talk, people kept asking her question and was pretty hard on her, I thought. Then someone was trying to get an answer out of her but I don't think she answered the yes or no question after 3 times.  Then, I went to vitamin store, didn't buy, and then found Anthony at our store. We walked on 4th, ate at soup spoon (pretty good), and we got a free chair massage for 12 minutes with this coupon I had at Saje. It was quite a chair, very nice. Felt kinad bad for walking out paying for anything though. I wanted some natural remedies but I thought was expensive... Anyhow went home after walking a bit. Scooter is nice. I came home and cleaned it, underneathe was super dirty. I gave leather treatment to it and all my gloves. I have to get some work done eventhough I can slack off now.

She walks over to the car and asks the blonde  >    driver for some I.D.  >     The blonde convertible driver searches through her purse in vain.  >     Finally she asks, "What does it look like?"  >     The blonde police officer tells her "It's that thing with your  >     picture on it."  >    The blonde driver searches for a few more seconds, pulls out her  >     compact, opens it, and sure enough sees her picture. She hands the  > >     compact to the blonde cop.  >     After a few seconds looking into the compact the blonde cop rolls her  >     eyes, hands the compact back to the blonde convertible driver and  >     says, "If you would have told me you were a police officer when I  >     first pulled you over we could have avoided this whole thing."   Today this bitch came into the store, expecting me to serve her like Holt Renfrew. First she complained about me talking on the phone, she said "as a customer..blah blah," then she told me she works next door and had to get a shirt for her bf. She took it for her manager to try on so i took her driver's license. She came back and wanted to pay with credit card. We always take down driver license # with credit card and she gave me this fucking bitch look and I asked if she had a problem. Then she said "I didn't say anything... It's ridiculous (the policy)...well what can I do..." I said we ask everyone for it and if you don't want to you can pay cash for it. She didn't say anything. Then after it gone through she asked me to staple the receipts together, and we don't usually give out the hand written receipt unless people asked for it, so there was only one anyways. I was already so mad in the middle I almost exploded. I was on the phone with Anthony and he heard her too and he was gonna make me hand her to phone for him to bitch at her but I didn't. Bitch! Later Anthony came and I told her to check her out, and he said she was really ncie to him when he walked in. Yeah fucking fake customer service. Anyhow, An came to buy present for me and his friend, I was gonna take the scarf next door, then in the end I gave it up so he could give it to his friend. He felt bad but I didn't mind too much. Then I fucking got newsletter email saying the grandmaster flash show is sold out for presales. So mad! If An didn't back out....but I shoulda bought it when I was going to...I don't know what held me back. I'm so stupid, I've been so stupid all the time.

      Wanted to get the free massage but woke up too late. Today finally sent Lynn's package took half an hour. Wrong move, went to Japanese restaurant...not cheap so ordered a tuna special which is a bunch of different tuna sushi....too much in the morning, and also I keep thinking about something I read that tuna always have "stuff" in there no matter how much u cook it. Couldn't finish so packed it up and rushed to school. Started pouring after class...went to downtown, was hoping to give the tuna to bums. Finally found a legless bum and he gave it back to me and said he couldn't eat sushi...@#$%%^#$. Then I couldn't find any bum so I just left it on top of a garbage can.  Went to get 3 more tix for the party at Bassix. Then I might as well get my bangs cut cuz it's a piece of turf and I am right by the japanese salon. The hair cut took less than a minute and they charged me $10 for it... #@#$#%@. But now that I've washed it at home I think at least it feels a bit better. Was gonna meet up with Nathan but got cranky on the phone with him so didn't. I hate bus, so humid and makes me a bit car sick or whatever. I can't wait til weather is better so I can take my scooter out.  I finally got through to Wilson in HK on the phone, because I was so stupid that i kept dialing 001 instead of 011. At least the damn card works, but I still haven't got through to the bus's lost and found phone line.

      Shit I lost my bus pass AGAIN!! I am so stupid...I have nothing more to say. Therefore I was super late for work on Saturday.  Saturday night, vday, was gonna stay home but I complained to Nathan that there's no dinner at home so we went out for dinner after work at Pepitas. That was nice. Later on, he picked me up to go to Waldorf to see Max Graham with Tony and co. Twins, and Jen, Jay, Karen, and On tsai came too. I was lured into popping and I did half, thought party was going on til 4, but nooooo....it ended at 2:30 because it was in East Van instead of Downtown. I had to party, so I took off with Jen and co. to downtown looking for after hours. The one on Smithe Street was charging $40 bc of some European DJ, so we went to the World/Liquid on Granville instead. On Tsai got freaked out by all the gay guys but I told him to do more drugs and then he would feel more comfortable. Jen and him thought they were disgusting. Anyhow we were pretty high and had a good time, met some people (as usual in there) mostly girls and straight guys. Jay was so popular the white girls were chatting to her the whole night and wouldn't let me take her out. Jen and I were silly enough to do some yoga poses in the loungy area where people were watching us. Dana from skool was at Waldorf and World. I used to think she is cocky but we chatted and she is alright. On Tsai drove me home and we had a puff, and I brought him to the elementary school to play that thing u hold on to and slides to the other side. It was fun, and nice to chat with him. I guess I was speedy so I didn't sleep too much but lying around felt so good. I probably have good sleep tonite. Today super unproductive... still home alone, in my zone.

      These days have been nice and sunny finally! Today got off early from skool and went to downtown for the rest of the day. Did yoga at a new place and it was alright, and they only charged me $5. Ate at my favorite Mexican restaurant after, yo quiero taquitos. Wanted to visit Duane but he wasn't working. Moved on to shopping...wanted to find a bra but it's hard to find my size I suppose, so no luck at all with that. I could have got a fabric burgundy striped roots bra but it's still $ and not totally what I'm looking for eventhough it was cute. Picked up pants at Off the Wall...they were the same one bc they prob made a mistake thinking it came in beige. Anyhow, I might as well buy it. Checked out snowboard shop but nothing there. Finally checked out Dipt Urban Hookups, nothing. Great, today is donation day for the art gallery so went there and paid only $2. Only upstairs was open, not good deal hehe. They had Francisco Goya, William Kentridge, and Buster Keaton. I wasn't interested in Goya's work, perhaps too classical for me. Kentridge is so awesome, his animations are so trippy where the cat always turn into an object. Keaton is the black and white movies, very funny, if you are into staying at the gallery the whole day watching movies then you will get your $'s worth, but I couldn't sit there forever eventhough it was very engaging. After gallery even bought some snacks from London Drugs.  Also, I had to think about a project for the hip hop class, and I am gonna do a website to show the crossing of genres of music. However I need to make a point, and I don't know and it seems to be too challenging for me. If I can resolve this problem then I should pat myself on the back.

      whoa..I haven't updated for 1 whole week! hmm let me recall...can't write too much now though it's late... I had to write a 1000 word review for my humanities class, and I chose to write about the Black Eyed Peas. I took one day, yes, one day to finish it! Aside from the thinking part the day before, I'm really proud of myself. But I was sure tired~ we watched 8 mile in the hip hop class..haha Friday went to eat lunch with Jamieson, it was kewl cuz I've never seen him in daylight before and first time hanging out. We had korean by crystal mall, then I was dropped off at Metro and I picked up my check for the movie extra work. It's funny how I am supposed to call them and leave msg for availability and the more they know my name the more jobs I have. Then I couldn't resist shopping. DAaaMN, clothes are cheap lately! I held back until I found really good deal at Off the Wall. I spent long time there but I wanna go back soon to find more $15 pants. Nathan came, and then I was all annoyed with him because I don't like him coming to see me lacking sleep and acting "weird." I then got very mad...I don't know why... I just do. Maybe I have a being close to people problem, I just get picky and annoyed with them and then eventually I have to withdraw from them. I hope it's not gonna happen with Nathan that way. We went back to his place and I finally watched American Wedding, that show is super funny and I don't mind watching it again. Stiffler was the center of attention in this one, and he was rowdier than ever. I didn't remember him being disliked in the other movies, maybe bc the setting was in highschool in those. I love stupid brainless movies. Maybe I'm stupid deep down inside. When I woke up with Nathan I got mad again. I don't wanna be upset when we don't need to, and that we are not even together. So on sat I told him I'll cut down on talking to him. I hope he's ok with that and I just want the best for our friendship. I know I'll miss talking to him all the time but it's just not working out that way. On sat, Grace called me, kinda pushed me to go out clubbing, and I said ok...eventhough I knew I prob gonna go snowboard on sunday. Anyhow I didn't call her cuz if she didn't then I could just slip away from the date like a soap. She called me around 11 pm, said she was waiting for my call, anyhow she said she's gonna come in a bit...then it got to the point when it was 1:30 pm and I was already half ready and she was in burnaby. And Anthony was waiting for me in downtown, if I go he goes if I don't go out he goes back. So I really had to reject her but I felt bad at the same time. I have enough friends screwing me over...Grace made me wait for her the whole night, Rocky running away with my money and juiced a ride, Tina stood me up for snowboarding...I think it's my luck lately with friends. Good thing I didn't go out cuz Fan called me in the morning for snowboard. I went it was awesome :) They were all tw ppl so I had to speak mandarin the whole day which I thought was tiring...but I got better at it I think. I tried to teach his brother Tony on improving his snowboarding too. I got along ok with them. I bumped into some ppl on the mountains, Kevin, and Danny Fong and John from highschool. Always see ppl up there. And I know some of Fan's friends, 604 is too small. me tired me sleep -_- zz

      Hello...Friday I had dinner with tony at Zin for the dine out thing, the food wasn't enough and we had to order extra, but we had a good talk. Then, went to Sonar for Lee Burridge with Francis and Sailor. Fuck I asked Francis to drive Rocky who's in Richmond and he doesn't even know him. Anyhow when we got to downtown Rocky told us to drop him off at Shenanigans cuz his friends there and he will come down with them. It was a no show, and he borrowed $50 from me when I'm broke and I'm doing it cuz he said he would pay me back the next day, which is no show either. Now he's not even returning my call! I'm pissed at him, what kind of a person is he? Anyhow, the music at sonar sucked. The twins came down too. Bumped into old friends like Jaffy and Grace which was a nice surprise. The dj didn't come on til 2 or so, and he wasn't really pumping, maybe if I was on something then I would get a head trip. After last week's show, this is way too mellow for me. I've never been so bored at sonar on fridays. Left around 3, went outside to eat that yummy udon right next to the place.  On Sat, after work went to suntanning place for the first time with Nathan. I didn't know it can help depression for those that needs sunlight. I think I'm a bit darker but not sure. And I don't know if I felt warm from it or was it because of the hotpot we had after. Hotpot was good too. I don't know why I've been getting mad with Nathan and feel that we have nothing to talk about. I guess I just get pickier with people the longer I know them. I think I feel fine but then he would upset me. So I don't know what to do maybe we shouldn't talk as much as we do. We care about each other, and I know he would never do anything to upset me intentionally. After dinner, we just went home, and I did some work and slept at 3 am, woke up at 3:40pm today, woken up by nathan's call. Shit and it was sunny too. no snowboarding for me either.

      Lucky Johnny is playing poker online in a 5 star hotel in Guam (an Island in South East Asia). He just went there to play with an ocean view and visit Kingston. Nathan told me about Jason's situation so I decided to send him reiki. Then a bit later I received phone call from Nathan said Jason found the money which they couldn't find for days! Maybe my reiki worked or was it a coincidence? If it did then I would be very very happy bc I have done a very good deed and reiki worked well.  Today was nice a bit windy, but nice to see sun :)

      Finally got good idea for the site project... After school had bbtea with twins to discuss our summer art making sessions...hopefully we can make some good $$$...and we got enough ideas. They should think more on the business side of things, but we can just fool around too sometimes as long as it is fun right? An might join us but I forgot to ask him to come to tonite's.

      Today went to skool to get BEP tix with twins online. Couldn't get in, server too busy. By the time we got in it was too late! The server went on at 1215 and by 12:18 tix were all gone. It's ridiculous!!! Me bad luck me sad...twins said they might line up for tix tmr, but I don't wanna have them line for long time and not be able to get...dunno if it's really worth it. Then we registered for grad panel and at least I got what I wanted. Went to dispute ticket, talked to Samuel for a bit.  Tried to write some ideas in the library and started falling asleep on my book and bag, so I went to caf ate snack and now I'm in the computer room doing shit like this. Sigh...I better get cracking otherwise I'm gonna be super wack.

      Friday stayed home... Sat at work had to buy another bunch of clothes...I can't help it but good stuff doesn't always come, esp when u need. Janice came to work to see me with Allan, what a surprise! More surprise is that she is getting married with John in Jamaica in the summer. She asked me to go if I can, but yeah my only hope is Nathan, but it's not big deal if I miss it anyways. Wow people around me are growing up, and even Bev had a baby. I forgot if I mentioned that but that's a very big step up for a cougar who has a mentality of a 20 year old. John is in jamaica for conference so Janice wanted to go out.  We went to Shine, with Allan and Anthony. Shit An always pull the last minute I-wanna-go-out-now thing, and I had to wait for him and rush so we could get in in time for free. I wore a skirt but got hit on even less than last week, prob cuz it was only down to me and An (with a guy). It's probably better because all the guys there are cheesy. Janice was so shy, these 2 girls on e was holding her hand trying to get her to dance. Those girls hung out with us, it was kinda funny. Of course Janice and Allan left early, since Janice doesn't drink or smoke up. I left around 2 something with An and had yummy nummy udon...it was so yummy...we had one of those and a bi bim bap, then we ordered a hot dog, and I could have ate more! I miss the udon and that was the best thing that night. We tried to go to Tokyo Lounge to find An's friend the bartender but we couldn't go up so he was all choked.  Today An's choked again cuz he can't find the white adidas bag that he wanted. We went shopping awhile back and he saw these adidas bag but I told him not to get cuz they weren't that nice. Today I just went to Richmond to eat at Mike/Ben's place, Mike gave me food for free. Then I went to TNT to buy groceries. Ben came to take over so Mike and I went to Iona Beach in Richmond which i didn't know about. Took some pics but realized that I had it in small file size >  Too much for me!

      Monday...went to massage for $15, and they were trying to sell me the membership for $88, well I bought it cuz it was good deal eventhough I don't need it. After that checked out a bunch of TNA clothes at my work, they were super small, just right for me! So I bought 3 pieces $$$.  Tue ...went to store again for 555 soul hoodie zip up, sold! Along with another tna pants. Finished writing paper, wanted to get it over with.  Wed...went to sonar for triple threat djs, I can't believe it was empty there! I guess cuz the party wasn't really promoted much. I got Apollo's autograph and took pic with him. Ed and them were there, even Andrew who doesn't live here anymore. Steve and Kelli came down too. I smoked I drank, pretty up there. They scratched a bit at first then no more, people were standing around, not even close to them. They just played tracks, and then in the end they did their thing for a few min. After that I had yummy nummy udon outside there.  Today was bad day! I took off from class early to buy BEP tix, cuz yesterday was sold out for presales online (I was pretty mad)! I lined up for an hour in rain, well I didn't get too wet though, and they were sold out also. Then they (the beat) announced that there's a second show, fuck I knew it from BEP's website, and for the first show they told ppl the day b4, and now they tell u the second show like it's some big news. They are too creative in promoting their events or something. So walked around visited Samuel and was gonna go home. Scooter gone! It got fucking towed away!! I've never had my own vehicle towed before, so I was pretty sad about spending $60 to reclaim it. Then it was raining and very windy, felt unsafe and drove super slow. Was gonna go home but I went to do the bank thing, to take my damn investment from 7 years ago! When I parked, I didn't park right up to the car in front of me and I left big space so another car would be able to park, but a car was behind me making gestures protesting. Anyhow I was pissed he was pissed and went to the parking lot, he came out he yelled some gibberish to me from across the street. I went in right after him and we were bad eyeing at each other. I just stayed back away from him. I was having such a bad day I wanted to start shit with him if he says or does anything again. After selling the investment, I get less than what the paper says anyways...o well who cares...i guess I'll use some of that money for the parking thing. I haven't had a bad day like this for so long.

      ...Friday nite stayed home... at least I felt healthy for work on Sat. I think there's a fireman interested in Wendy. Nathan came over after my work, and we ate at Las Magaritas yummy nummy :P I decided to stay at Nathan's since no one wanna go out with me. While he's taking the bus home, I was gonna go to commodore to get tickets to the hip hop show but they told me that I could just buy it online with same price. When we were chilling, Annie called and wanted to go out bad. I didn't wanna at first cuz I was far and I didn't wanna go back home and do all that work and go out, eventhough she is willing to drive. I didn't have clothes and contacts too. In the end I decided to go, and she brought me a top but I still had to go out in glasses. I think they made me unattractive in clubs! She was getting quite a lot of attention, hmm.... We went to Sonar first but the crowd so young and bad that we left right away, then we went to Shine. John was there doing bouncer but he didn't let me in either but he took the time to apologize after I waited more than half hour in line. My legs were pretty tired by then. I saw Japhy, and his funny girl friends. There were lotsa guys standing around looking like they wanna pick up girls. There were Mcs that were rapping one after another, and they were in the crowd at times. B-girls were there doing their thing. It's good there and there are nice and weird people.  After clubbing around 4am, I went back to Nathan's and slept for long long time, we ate mexican food again and watched Simpsons. Now I'm home. Now I feel lonely because no one likes me (except for Nathan), and I never meet anyone. I've lost my charm. :'(

      I was still looking for shirt on tuesday at in-again. Then I went home and took out my graduation credit sheet, and realize that maybe I should just get a loan and get school over with on time. So I ended up not needing to find work now. I went to salvation army to look also, but I ended up finding 2 bags. One is a little basket suitcase, very cute, and the other is canvas bag with some green stripe, should be useful. All the stuff I typed for the paper on tuesday I didn't save in the end and lost it so I had to work on it again on wed. Then thu my teacher was sick and we left after waiting half hour. So I worked the whole day. Wed I dyed my hair with that no ammonia streaking stuff. The hassle of pulling little hair out of the holed cap is too much! However the result was not bad, so if someone would pull hair out for me one day with the streaking cap, then I would buy that thing again. It costs $18 to buy the pack, so maybe just go to a salon is more convenient. I'm so happy my hair is lighter again. Today I got my vacation pay, feel better...now I can go buy books on amazon! Nathan's been sick and I've been getting mad at him...sorry I can't help it!

      I wasted today to look for a shirt for interviews, but ended up with nothing in hand. I might go back tomorrow to get it, with Nathan's help.  I talked to Deanne about my final project and I realized my stupid online project was bad- cliche and predictable. Of course art is about ambiguous and no not being straight forward! How come I didn't see it at first? I'm in third year and I still don't know how to do good art?? So now I'm stressed cuz I got more to think about, and I have to do grad panel which I have nothing to show (thought website was good to show but now I see all the problems with it). I have all these big projects to do now and I am not set to do them. I have to worry about finding jobs as well. Sad, Stressed, and tired.  O yeah pissed off too, cuz today this woman came to the store. I wasn't working but I went to look at shirts. She is so "inappropriate"! I don't think she means to be rude but she was criticizing about our prices and how it is like between a thrift store and a consignment store. She was amused at the fact we have a security tag system. She wanted more for her nice items and wanted to sell her cheaper stuff there. An told her to try somewhere else but she wouldn't leave! She just kept standing there and talking, and say all these shit made me so mad! I don't feel peaceful at all!

      I haven't wrote for awhile... Friday went to Jen's bday at Voda, but I felt kinda out of place because they are already good friends and I was kinda by myself. I wanted to leave but couldn't, and Wendy couldn't drive me home. Jeff, Yvonne and Herb came but they didn't come for her birthday, things got a bit better and I got some free drinks. Left around 1:30 with Yvonne and Herb. Saturday, found out that I didn't have tickets to Anne Savage anymore! So I wasn't gonna go cuz I didn't wanna spend that kinda money on that dj. Wendy drove me to On Deck and I ended up not buying eventhough they had. In the end I ended up going because Jeff was treating me. A lot of people went, and Johnny came too. She wasn't that good but it was ok. Johnny gave me this really stong "e" that he would only take half himself when usually he takes one whole at least. I took 1/4 and I got high from that, and drank lotsa redbull and vodka too. I left with Yvonne and Herb once again. When I got home I couldn't really sleep but I didn't get any visuals so I was kinda bored. I did got to sleep though. Check out some funny pics in the funkypix link. Right now it's sunny...what the heck I thought it's gonna rain?? Well me go now, gotta be motivated and work hard!!

      me sleepy so mucho...11 hours and still needed alarm.  Today in the anatomical class, I had a good chat with the other only non-animation student. She's in design, so it's nice to exchange thinking, and also she studied in Langara's D D program like me!  I saw the Mini show in the painting room and stuff there was awesome. So small, and gave me lotsa inspiration and encouragement to work in small scale.  Today is windy...to ride.

      I got upset at Nathan again, mad and sad, felt like my heart was hurting and unsettled. I tried to meditate and clear out the bad energies but later on tonite we fought again. I worry about his money situation, and at the same time I don't like to see him in that situation at all. I hope he can be successful as a "man." That would make me no worry. But then we fought cuz I was irritated by the way we were talking.  I guess I'm wrong sometimes but I'm too stubborn, and I just need to vent and complain about what gets on my nerves.  I got a site from teacher and the title happened to be "I'm grateful," an art exhibition with that subject matter. I guess I should count my blessings and be grateful, then I can be free from my sadness and worries.   -I'm broke but I'm grateful that I can keep my job and can go out to spend $, at least I live at home and I have a roof and food. -Nathan irritates me and is broke but he has spent a lot on me (not responsible but that's another story), and who's gonna save me from a panic attack, hear me whine about my stupid problems, and make me feel like the most special girl in the world? -I'm grateful there's no war outside my house, canada is not the most fun but sure is peaceful.  no worry and no angry, be nice and be grateful :)

      I forgot to say that Bryan was being all weird and pussy, needing company, and when I don't give him he was being all upset and taking it out on me cuz no one else wanted to answer his phone call. He sounded ok today so that's good but he's another one for me to worry cuz he's totally slipping in school. I don't like to see weak side of guys, not capable of being successful on his own.  On a totally different topic, I think Nathan is good in a sense that he's always open to what I have to offer and say and seems to enjoy it. I was so scared to the panic attack I felt like he saved my life or something, and I feel that he is there when I really need him. I really have to say he did a good job on that one :)  Anyhow, I think my path in reiki/life is far from clean and pure. I don't think I can with my temper, all the worrying that I do, and the fun of drinks and some drugs. Well I'm not perfect and I will never be but I try I guess.  I finished reading my course pack for this week, phewww, but I have to prepare the presentation later, yikes.  Why do I get totally rained on when I take my bike out and it's not as bad when I actually don't?  This is a random post.

      OK I have to track back a bit again.  What happened on Wed was my teacher didn't show up for more than half hour to an hour and people started leaving...well what a waste of my time. So went to library got this great book on booking binding, and now maybe I wanna buy it myself.  Thursday went to yoga with Annie, but before that chatted with Wendy on the phone and realized what kinda stuff Annie had said about me in the past which made me choked. I went to yoga nonethelss but I wasn't talking too much to her, have to be careful. We went to the Path in the westend. That was the most intense hatha I've ever done, it was like power yoga and it was getting really warm too with the amount of people and no ventilation. I hated it, and in the middle I thought if I was in the wrong class, but I confirmed later that it was a hatha. It was just a tough workout and I didn't have the time to feel and enjoy the energy.  Friday looked liek a nice day but it was deceiving. I walked out the door and I hesitated but then I thought I got dressed already so I went out. It was hella windy and I had to go on the open bridge to go to Richmond. I felt like I coulda got blown by the wind so much that my bike can fall. Anyhow I went to that buddhist store to get my bracelet fixed, and they did it for free again, I felt bad about that but I guess buddhists just wanna gain karma. Got some stuff from tnt, went to see Steve for a bit. We didn't have too much to say but I got his new album. It's pretty good, jazzy crazy stuff.  At night, went to Club 23 for Cata's bday with the twins, and headed down to Sonar after. 23's patio is so mellow now cuz they don't let ppl bring drinks out and smoke weed there. They booked downstairs for his bday, and Grace was so fuct there. When me and twins head to Sonar the music was so wow, funky house, haven't heard for so long. He even played 2 tracks of Outkast in house version. I had a satisfying dance :) Anthony came down, we got freebie drinks from bartender hehe. Then we went back to 23 b4 we went home.  Sat I worked and I was ok eventhough I only slept 5 hours drunk. I went to see Nathan after work and I was pretty tired by then. We had pho, and went back to his place with Gip there. I did a full reiki session on him. It was weird cuz some places were warm and others were fridge cold, and I could feel cold energy rolling around the area. We were watching Once Upon a Time in Mexico and I didn't know if it was a bad thing. Now that I found out about "grounding," to be in the present otherwise I could get Nathan's energy instead of just channeling it. Somehow Gip didn't feel reiki much, and he couldn't even do chi ball. I was sad the other day bc I gave reiki to ppl like Gip and he was too busy to stop and notice if he felt it. But he wanted to thank me now maybe cuz Nathan asked him to. That made me feel that I do so much for ppl and I get nothing back. So Sat night, after work, I do full reiki session on Nathan (more than an hour), tried to teach him yoga, and gave ideas to Gip when I was super tired, I just felt sad. Why do I feel sad when I could help others?  Anyhow, when me and Nathan went to sleep. I was overtired and had trouble sleeping, but he was super tired and so ready to sleep. He kept jerking, making sudden noises, or gasp, when I just start to relax and start falling asleep, which scares the shit out of me, like the thriller movies when things jump out at you. He did it many times until one time I got a panic attack which I never had before and I didn't know what the hell was going on. I was breathing really fast, and started crying uncontrollably and shaking and was really scared cuz i didn't know what was happening. I felt like I wasn't myself and was freaking out. I thought it had something to do with reiki or spirits. Luckily Nathan stayed calm and helped me through it, and I'm grateful for that. I guess he scared me too many times my body couldn't take it anymore and I was super tired too. I had to go online to see what was wrong with me, so we went to bed at 3 am instead of being in bed at 12 am.   Last night I had a weird dream too being in a hotel and got stuck with the bill. Today I just feel tired and all weird and sad now. I dunno what's wrong with me, anthony thinks I'm super weird. I don't wanna go out even though Grace asked us to. I worry too much, Nathan said. We had brunch b4 he drove me home. I worry about him failing school and money problems. Now I came home I talked to Carlos, I worry about him cuz he went to riot and government is tracking him down in Venezuela. I guess my problems always become insignificant compare to his. But yeah more worries for me. I know that doing reiki, one of the principle is not to worry, I try I guess. Why am I feeling sick right now? Sneezing and sniffles? I worry about how I feel too. Ok stop it....

      Let's track back a bit.   So Friday off to the hotspring, and it felt like it was quite a short drive, like driving to chilliwack for a rave. I felt a bit sick, but I tried to do some reiki on myself in the car and I think that worked a bit. When twins and I got there, we had to use the washroom so went to the public pool. Am I glad I didn't stay at other places and use the public pool. It was kinda gross with foggy windows and fat old white people soaking in there (no discrimination there). We had a light meal and went to check in. We took a look a the pool right after and we got all excited and hurried to get change to go in for a dip. It was indeed nice soaking in hot water outdoors in the cold. Then we cleaned up and went to check out some restaurants, but ended up at the hotel. We realized that it was all booked so we walked back out to get a bite. There was this dude that came to the resort by himself to relax, and he was in front of us and went to eat by himself in the same restaurant.. It was a bit strange to go to resort alone when everyone around you were in groups. It was a German restaurant, and I have no experience in that kinda food. It was good though. Went back a bit buzz from the wine and took another dip in the water. It got more packed at night, and I really liked the atmosphere. When we went back up, we ordered room service. They delivered the beer w/o opening it, so I had to call for the opener. They came and I realized it was a wine cork screw, but I managed to have it plied open anyways. I was gonna give the guy tips too cuz I thought they charge to the room, but he gave me the bill, and I gave him 20 for a $16 bill, and one of the twins didn't know and gave him the $2, and then I had to snatch it back from the guy which was kinda embarrassing.  Next morning woke up early to have another dip. I woke up earlier cuz I didn't have deep sleep, and I couldn't sleep after going to pee at night. O yeah the washroom got plugged too with a twin's full of tissue and yee ma. It wasn't as gross I guess cuz they are my friends? We didn't bother getting it fixed, and in the morning I peed in the bathtub after I almost overflowed it with an attempt in flushing, u know me, who cares. So we soaked 3 times in the hotspring already, I think it was enough. I wish I could afford the spa though, but whatever, it was all good.  When we checked out, the hotel charged me $240 when the nightly rate is $169. I asked and they said it was room service last night. I said I paid already and the bill was $16. This place is just kinda disorganized over all from my experience. I realized I left my jacket in there and I rushed to get it back. I came back out to the car, waited a long time by myself. Figured the twins are probably sitting in the hotel lobby, but they didn't figure to come back out so I went to them. We walked to check out the real hotspring and started going back. I thought the Value Village in Chilliwack would be full of goodies but unfortunately it was crappier than stuff in Van. We ate at Ricki's and went back to Van. Stopped by at Nathan's and ended up watching Freddy vs Jason, what a stupid movie.  I tried to finish as much work as I could with the web project and people seemed to like it in class. I thought there was a pretty crappy project in class.  urlLink Check it out.   Went to Krispie Kreme with annie, didn't wait too long and bought a dozen. Very american indeed.   I told Annie in the car about reiki. When I got home I told Anthony, and I did 2 different distant reikis for them and they felt it. An's lungs didn't hurt as much and he suddenly "felt my presence." Annie felt more awake and she said for sure. I tried with twins, but they said they only got the feeling when I first did for them at the hotel breifly. At the hotel, they said they feel my hands "shaking/vibrating." They could only felt it in the very beginning but they don't feel anything after. Strange...maybe they are not in tuned with their bodies or I just suck. I give Nathan some too and he feels it too. I think I need a lot more practice to be better. But yeah reiki is like totally rad dude.   I need to wash/dye my hair but I think it's getting a bit late...

      Yup haven't blog for quite awhile once again. I'm glad I finally made it through school, eventhough I just get by like usual, who cares when you are going to Whistler to go see Black Eyed Peas??? I haven't been there for years and I never hung out in the village. Nathan and I got a good deal at mountainside lodge, a studio for $89 with fireplace and kitchen, and outdoor pool and hot tub. I got super mad b4 we went so I ended up driving otherwise I would be even madder. It only took about an hour from North Van so it's alot faster than I thought. We grabbed some food and drinks, and at night went into the hot tub, I felt like I was in a washing machine with all the chlorine bubbles forming around me, gross! We headed to a club which was free bc of the telus world ski festival. Guys couldn't dance there and there were lotsa horny girls. We left early cuz Nathan's nose bridge felt like being hammered. We slept early, it's good thing cuz we had to get up early to check out and go boarding. We could finally cook!! We had some eggs and sausage and stuff. I think he can cook better if he's used to having a kitchen. Then we went snowboarding, and the weather was cloudy and sunny. The snow was sticky, and when we went to the top, there was a blizzard, white out! I couldn't move much cuz I was stuck in the snow, and when I got up I would fall back down again. Nathan was all like c'mon! and swooping his arm for gesture, and I started crying and wanted to take the lift back down. I made myself go, and after a bit passing that nasty part, it was sunny with clouds, !@#$!#... I thought I got a nasty tan as well with the big goggles, lucky it was only temporary. We left soon to see the concert. We got into another fight again...@#$!#@#%$.....I felt liek I didn't wanna go on trips with him anymore...I hope clubbing this week would be ok for us... :( cuz I hate that feeling! I can't fun away and we always fight when it is the best show ever. BEP was good but nothing new for me, seen them b4. Justin Timberlake came on for the last song, and he sang like a girl. He beatboxed while Will.i.am. rap over it. After shopping a bit, we had to head back bc of Nathan's duties the next day :( we were so tired, esp dinner at Banana Leaf. I felt like I was in a dream. The trip for one day is quite expensive...that's snowboarding for you! Yes all the good looking and loaded people were there.  Saturday went to the last rave at Plaza, there were still lotsa old asians and young slutty teenagers. I see some normal age people this time though. Johnny got me me a VIP ticket so I'm glad I don't have to go through that horrible big lineup. I had lotsa fun and I even did my freeze there haha. It was good until Teresa at the end started ODing and shit. She was like passing out but we had to keep trying to wake her up, and her eyes would be all over the place. It's nasty to see that shit, really ruined my own part of high. I cared for her eventhough I don't know her, while there are other people whose relations with her are like me just sat around us but totally ignore the situation. I cannot believe that they can do that??? I left around 7 with Jeff, Yvonne and Herb. Smoked some green and went home. I was definitely on some kinda speedy stuff cuz I knew it when I find myself talking like a parrot the whole time. After this time, I don't feel down, I still wanna party! I didn't really get to sleep so decided to stay up to be productive. Went to b-girl class, it was good, I can't believe Tina missed it to have dinner...I guess she is not totally serious about it.   Tuesday was Nathan's bday, I went there despite the nasty wind. Before his place I went to the sample sale, spent more $$!!! Then I went over, and I was damn hungry, so we went to Metrotown and I had to find something quick. We went to TGIF and he hated it, but I thought it was ok. I don't know why maybe it's habit now, we get so tired whenever we dine. We had drinks too so I could barely even go shop. So that was that. Went back got pretty stoned and passed out.   It's been sunny so have to hit the beach pretty soon! Massage tomorrow first! Yay! It's great to be not in school! Can't wait til I graduate.

      How come the whole city watches hockey? I guess there gotta be something people wanna cheer for. I just don't get it. I don't get watching sports. Today I had grad panel review. Celia and Ken are alright but that Neil Campbell has a critical attitude, but he wasn't too critical I guess. It went quick and it was a little bit scary. Friday I missed boy George @ Sonar...damn...heard it was really good > Sat wen to get drunk again at Luce for Jenny's bday. She gone wild for sure!  At work, Wendy got pissed off I think... she took things the wrong way from me. She is very small air.  Sunday went to see Dalai Lama with Nathan. He's a very cute old monk. I think I felt something when he stepped in, hmmm... but the public talk was too general for me. Then I went to my first b girl lesson with Tina. I could sorta do some freezes, and it was fun and the instructor is kewl. Can't write much now busy this week.

      Do I have bad luck or what? I supposingly email the promoters for the tix give away, I shoulda got it for free but they didn't get my email??? And I lost some $ like $18...probably the caf girl made mistake? It's really odd. Anyhow went to check out JJ at Onyx in far Burnaby. The place is pretty nice and the staff are as nice as the comments online. Some 18 year old started talking to us but we were just being nice and had a shot of tequila before hand. Then when JJ came on, that dude came, and then there was a song with some lyrics about tits and then he said "here let me help u," and started reaching for my breasts, luckily I hit his hand away eventhough I was drunk. After awhile he left. Then later there was this young looking asian dude around me, and I felt that he was staring at me for a long time, but luckily they are too shy to do anything so he left after awhile too. There was a black girl beside me she was pretty nice, and then on the VIP section there were some black dude, and there was Wesly Snipes. They were saying hi to the black girl so later on she tagged along with them. One black dude looked familiar too, and I thought there was another guy that looked like MC Hammer but probably not. DJ JJ is da bomb! It was so good and I got sooo drunk....I've never seen the twins this drunk b4... we were laughing in the car and they were even yelling...that's a first. Good thing we got home safely. Then I couldn't walk straight and I had to hold on to things so I won't stumble around. When I was trying to sleep, I ended up puking in my room's garbage can, gross...I tried to bag it many times too haha, I hope it will never be exposed. Then I fell asleep like dead meat. Today woke up my ears are plugged from the music, and alcohol still kinda in my system. What a night...but yeah music was the best ever!

      Tuesday had interview with Ken for anatomical drawing, it went ok and he said I improved over time, using fewer lines, defining shapes.  Then Bryan was late again for our meet, so I went to his place and we went for  brunch, he's broke ass still so I treated him. We went to Canadian Tire, on the way bumped into Casey, so he's gonna help me with flash. Then I went on my own riding my scooter around to get errands done. I really tried to make a second book last minute with the transparencies. It turned out nice and I wanted to do it so much that I went to kinko's 10 at night to get more prints. However I couldn't finish it but the pieces turned out super kewl.  Today it's crit for book media, Celia seemed to like the transparencies alot. I wanna finish it for grad panel next week to show. Tonite went to opening at skool for twin's project in concourse gallery. It was most interesting to see peeps eat their heads off the snacks...5 plates of sushi gone in short time, cupcakes came all gone...it was kinda a show itself.  Tonite I got Dalai Lama tix for sunday, pretty kewl...but I couldn't get the show that I wanna see... the spiritual teaching, but I got tix for the public talk instead... sigh~ Nathan got me stuff from TO, can't wait to see :)

      Today went to the beach with Nathan, Easter sunday...it was packed and the weather was HOT! We ain't gonna have this long, it's gonna get cold again next week. It was very nice day...but we had to end the day at 4:30 cuz he gotta go. I bought the pencil that I wanted, and then tried to go to yoga but no evening classes. I went to downtown...think I was running out of gas...someone actually helped me so I got a free half tank muhaha....then I rode around places I wanted to go to were closed so went home.

Annie stood me up after she woke me up from my nap, it's ok...I learned alot about mudras online today, they are very useful. I didn't do any work tonite...o wellz...sometimes there are more important things? or maybe I'm not disciplined enough? work was busy today I guess but felt tired...

      More things to add...  The Jamaican guy is possibly hitting on me, but I don't want more than friendship. He might have hook up for BEP concert though...and I really wanna go. Now a solution is that I just realized that they are performing up in Whistler for free in the afternoon! So I could go with Nathan and his friends who have cabin up there, and do a bit of snowboarding...just hope it's not too icy yikes. I hope Nathan has more $ by then too~

      I haven't wrote for awhile...  Now that the weather is so nice, I feel like I waited ages for this. Why do I have to get over the cold rainy winter? I need sunshine, and not just the summer!  I did very bad for my anatomical drawing quiz on tuesday, 19/60! Cuz I know it's only worth 10 % I didn't try hard enough and i was getting tired and bored. Also, I forgot how to memorize things for tests because I haven't for a long time. My brain is alot more damaged as well by now. But anyhow I'm not impressed with myself at all on that!  Sleeping more makes me tired too, and staying in the same bedroom with all activites- computering, sleeping, homework...is just not working! Sometimes when I do work I get distracted by plugging my hair...I need to move out or something, and I really need my own space!  Rick called me about his crazy sickness and his gf leaving him...crap, I had to feel sorry for him but then at the same time, I don't really want to deal with him while I'm busy. Poor him, but he's being pretty whimpy too...  Francis came back from HK, and he is like me, never went back since we came here which is a long long time. He likes it so much that he wanna move there now. It suits him because he's ambitious, and there are lotsa opportunities. The pace is alot faster than weedy slow Vancouver. He likes the atmosphere in general too. It really triggers my curiosity of my "homeland." One time I looked at some online pics of HK and then I have decided to go back to take a look when I graduate next year. Now that I have talked to him, I want to go back even more! I wish I will have more money so that I can buy cheap packages to other parts of Asia while I'm there. Of course, I wanna see TW, where for sure I will have a place to stay. I will still try to take my beach vacation while I'm on the East side. Eventhough I'm not from here but Vancouver is really home to me.  I'm still having problems with flash eventhough my teacher figured something out. I dunno I guess technical difficulties can be a part of it, as long as I can bullshit the uncontrollable aspect of it. Sigh...maybe I should give up flash after this.  Thursday went to see Dj Maseo at Sonar with Nathan, and then Jen and co came later. We had to take bus but o well... When we go there around 10:30 it was so dead that we hung around in downtown for a bit. There was nothing good going on eventhough it's long weekend, what's up with that??? We went there anyways. Since it's after party for Arts County Fair, an university big party, there were lotsa university geeks. Music was whatever, and I really wasn't feeling it at all. I was damn tired too. Was the waitress hitting on me? I dunno but free drink was nice... I felt like me/Nathan spending all the money on a no fun night was a waste...I know he's poor for now~ Udon was alright...we took it home and ate it, smoked and played video games.  Today we went to eat dim sum, pretty cheap...then walked to the Park and sat on the grass, which was very soothing and nice. Went back and I attuned him to reiki. He couldn't really tell if he felt different, so I was upset that I wasn't good enough to give him attunement, my first time. He tried some reiki and I think it works and he could feel pulse and different temperatures. So perhaps he just doesn't know what energy really feels like for now. I'm sure he will be more aware as he practices more. Welcome to reiki world, nathan :)

      Friday stayed home...I was sad prob felt lonely. Also, I was stressed out by not being able to do Flash, so frustrating!! I need to get this going and I have no help! Now I got some books but I need in person help still. Saturday worked and Bryan came in so I asked him to join me and Nathan to Ikea. I got these kewl mousepads for 99 cents each, I wanna get more and draw on them. I like the new beach matt too. I like Ikea! Then went to Daiso to grab some stuff again. I'm happy with my room improvement with all the cheap racks and bins that I bought. Anyhow I had dinner with Nathan at Rugby, the pretentious restaurant but they have good stuff. Then went to his place, we played new game of ninja with xbox. Had a good sleep, we ate at Gloucester, it's funny he was picking up on these chinese words from ppl around us. After I got home, went to check out the small gym at Unihealth in Richmond. Yup it was like whatever so did for a bit and went home. Nice days to ride. Scooter is great, and any interactions with other motorists make me happy. I feel stressed about school but I dunno if I'm working hard enough, I'm just all stressed and no do. I'm missing alot of good shows in clubs also... :| Nathan bought ibook from Bryan for $500...welcome to mac world :)

      O great I have lumpies on my tattoo, hope I don't develop eczema there. My neck one is very annoying, it got really bad when I forgot to use my medicine once. My upper back, neck feel like tendon hurts, is it the fong sup like old people get when there's bad weather?? I must be getting old. o yeah I was soaking my crystal bracelet in salty water for cleansing, and awhile ago there was a moth struggling in the water. Very strange! The size of the cup is a shooter glass, there is no lamp above the glass, so what the hell is it doing in there? What does it symbolize? I didn't know if I should have saved it but I poured it down the drain, and the moth was struggling at the drain's edge. I thought of saving it, but it fell anyways. O well too late, so I had to pour more water down the drain too. I felt kinda bad, maybe it's bad karma. So I am resoaking my bracelet for another day just in case, with extra reiki cleansing step after too. Forgive me, moth, I would have killed you if I have seen you as one of those fucking annoying caterpillars. I guess I am not so sorry afterall.

      I feel ok now, and me and Nathan are too. I picked on him again the other day about the club and I felt bad afterwards. I can be such an ugly person at times. I forgot to write here that I can finally do a yoga headstand, but still trying to balance good. Course schedule for next year just arrived, already?? I'm not ready!

      Went to see Dj Rap on Friday at Sonar but she sucked since she changed her style from dnb to house. Then Sunday went to the Planet of the Drums with djs like Dieselboy, Dara, Ak1200, Andy C....me and Nathan got tix at the door from some guy for $35 but it was worth it. Music was great both floors, but Nathan started to get drunk which I never seen b4. At first I was happy and amused that he looked like he was having good time. He was being ultra friendly to people, but after awhile it got really annoying and he was all over the place and he wouldn't listen to what I had to tell him. I was drunk myself and I felt like I had to take care of him. I was pretty mad at times, and when we got back he kept moaning and I couldn't sleep well. My happiness was almost pretty up there until last night everything just crumbled down again. Now I just feel sad and lonely. I shouldn't be close to someone who makes me so mad. I don't know anymore.  Also, I am totally not into the coursepack readings, and I feel dumb for that. I hope i can get through the classes... It turned out that I had a private lesson on Sunday bgirl class, at least I'm getting good at that, sigh. Don't think I would ever wanna break in a club, the floors are nasty!

      Finally Nathan called me when I was at Bryan's with Gip on Saturday. He did go to school to work hard at studying during the week but he wasn't home...etc etc...He left for TO on the weekends, and he left his phone there so no one could contact him. Anyhow he's very stupid for not calling me!! I was mad and happy and mixed emotions. I'm glad he's ok but it's not fair he does this to me, and make me so sad worrying about him. I don't wanna talk about it anymore makes me mad!  School is a bit boring and long, well the modern art actually might be more interesting than I thought. Avante Garde as shock in urban artefacts or something. That class is so dinky small for 30 ppl! I had no room for a table...  Yesterday I went out with Nathan and met his brother Mike. It was nice we watched Kill Bill at night too. We saw a bartender that looked like Nathan.

      As each day goes by without news of Nathan, I get more and more worried, to the point that it crept up on me in life w/o realizing it. Tonite's Tina's bday at Crush, I was so not in the mood, but bc we were going to leave and An kept wanting to stay longer, I was getting pretty down. Then he said I was fahn for wanting to leave, cuz I told him what time it was when he asked?? I thought that how come he is not understanding as a friend and would leave with me. So that snapped, and I was kinda pissed but I tried not to, tried to control my anger. Then in my mind I forgave him, but then I was still down bc I started thinking about Nathan like crazy. I'm pretty convinced that something bad has happened to him. All I hope for is that he is ok. I also feel that I can't get along with anyone and I just want to be alone. O great tomorrow I have to face Wendy since the fight we had 2 weeks ago. I mean I want to just act normal around her, but with the Nathan thing, I think it would be pretty hard to try to act normal and happy, then she would think I am holding a grudge. Things just add up, u know? Like May said she's been going out but not that she ever calls me to go. Or that there are people that I am around with that I try to act nice and interesting, but in the end I feel like I have to act instead of feeling good to be myself. I mean it's still myself but it would not be totally comfortable, and have to be self-conscious of how others perceive me. Maybe last night I didn't have fun too bc subconsciously I was still worrying about Nathan, but then again last night did suck. Today I went to jericho beach by myself, just lied around for couple of hours. It's nice and quiet there, probably just what i needed. It was hot. Perhaps beach therapy can't take away my worries.

      OK I'm super worried about Nathan! I had never been not able to reach him! Something must be really wrong! He's supposed to be in skool too and it's already thursday (just now). I really hope he's ok!! I hung out with Bryan afterwork and I gave him reiki at kits. He felt it so that's good! He felt my hand was still there even when they weren't. But I still never experience those weird dramatic experiences. We had some vegetarian food, samosa, it was pretty good too. He paid me back so now he's broke again, I hope Gip can hook him up with that job. Sleep~

      I guess I have to realize what is wrong with me because I don't get along with people sometimes. Yesterday talked to Gip about Bryan and I said he was pathetic, and now I feel bad that I judge him because I don't try to understand that perhaps his problem is a real problem, not just some personal issues. I have to stop judging people, blame other people even in my head, and gossip or talk shit. I want to try to see what is wrong with me instead of seeing what is wrong with other people. I am far from being the ideal, but I guess I am better than a lot of people in this corrupted world.  Yesterday went to Janice's yoga store to buy present. Damn I want that cushion thing but it's $30+ ...well I might probably just get it, it is so cute and practical. When I was close to the door way and they thought I left. Wendy came in from the back and Janice was teling her how I just left. I didn't know if I should say hi or what so I just slipped out of the door. I am scared to work with her, and I try to think of how I should act towards her. Probably just like normal? I don't really want to confront her with how I really feel..."as friends." Anything that goes wrong with this job will def ruin our friendship but I guess it's not a big deal cuz we don't really hang out anyways. So An's shirt stain came out I heard, so why all the anger right? I think my problem is I let other people's vibe ruin my own. So I read on the reiki forum is that I can visualize a shield for myself with only good energy and bad energy can repel. I think it's good idea. Visualization with reiki is pretty useful I think. I need new ideas and explorations bc I was getting same old shit of reiki and I didn't continue my practice with it earnestly. OK gotsta go

      Thursday went out with Anthony, Annie and twins to Lotus, and then Shine in the end briefly. Lotus was a bit dead, but some nice people there. Shine we paid full cover and we pretty much had to leave right away. i don't think we hung out together for awhile, with Annie.  Saturday went to the school's grad show, so many people was kinda hectic. I worked with Stephanie in the afternoon and she came along as well. Then when twins was handing me red wine and I didn't see and flick my hand and splashed it right on Anthony. He was so upset about it, I thought he was mad at me and being polite to twins so i was pissed too. Well but later he told me he wasn't. He was so upset he took the bus home himself on a Sat night. Can't believe one can get so upset over material things...but then he's obsessed about fashion. Makes me sad but anyhow went out with Stephanie, with Francis, Chris and co. Ended up at Lotus, and I didn't think their friends would enjoy it that much but they did and we stayed til 3 something. My high heels were killing my dancing. Also, I had way too much redbull and vodka, made me sick. I went to eat Tw beef noodle with Francis after. Went home, was sad.  Next day I was really sad too, everything was just adding up, Anthony, problems with Wendy at work the week b4, Fairus not being a friend anymore, Nathan hasn't called me in a week, too much time on hand with lack of activities with friends. I was so sad in the afternoon I just lied around like a sick cat. Then I went to do yoga and made me feel better, and I found a great suntan lotion at Semperviva which is of lavender. Then Bryan called me in time and went to eat Jap. Once again I treated him cuz he's broke ass, and he got fired and not finished with his homework when school's so over. So I had to put some philosophical sense to him to make him be better...sigh while I was down myself. Went to class, had so much fun as usual, we learned how to do uprock and she made us form circle for first time, but we all shy. It's probably the only thing that I really look forward to every week, breaking is really fun. I felt better.   Talked to An, it's all good...that drama "king." We talked about Wendy and she thinks we are on bad terms. Talking about her disturbs that mad monster inside me. I went out too and all the agressive drivers triggers it as well. So I might as well just stay home and stay away from any human beings. Anyhow I bought cds from A&B sound, spent $38 on 3 and I didn't wanna blow all my $ on unnecessary things. I think I will return one of them, Chingy, it's party music and I only like his released songs but no substance. I hope I can cuz I tried to put the seal back together... cross fingers haha. yeah I'm cheap so what? Found Lenny Kravitz for $7, can't beat that! Tmr going for the spa package, let's see how it is...  If Nathan reads this I hope he contacts me cuz I'm starting to worry.

      Last night went out with twins, Anthony and Annie clubbing. We went to Lotus first and it was pretty dead but we met some people and left around 1 something to Shine. The small room was hip hop that was good but was way too short, ended right away and we paid full cover too. After went to eat pho. Me got drunk. Didn't sleep well though :( Today I went back to get those damn Etnies, I picked the white ones finally...out of all the colourful ones...> Went to Yaletown for sample sales, but didn't buy anything. Rained so sat in coffee shop and wait, luckily it died down a bit so I could go home. Nothing much just mellow.

      Nothingness. Since I don't have school and only little work, I'm doing nothing. I haven't talked to Nathan today bc he's giving me my space, but I hope we ok soon. Anyhow, I guess it's good that I'm doing this nothingness cuz I will get so zero that I will wanna be busier when summer school starts. When I have time I just don't do the things I want to when I'm busy.  I didn't really go out these 2 days except just to the corner store to buy snacks. :( I have no friends! Just look at how many people wrote me a testimonial on friendster compare to the amount of people who are included in my friends! Lone wolf owwwwww~~~

      I've been having strange dreams lately, like last night there was a girl puking shit out of her mouth. I just hate humans. I don't get along with them yet I feel lonely. I am very frustrated with Nathan, makes me sad. I do want to be grateful to have him in my life and see my own faults, but I am very sick of all the drama now. I think the longer I spend time with people the more problems I have with them. I think I should just be a lone wolf. Why am I so sad lately? O yeah I forgot cuz I have no friends. Last night was good at Slam City Jam event at Commodore, but don't feel like talking about it now. Very emotionally drained.

      Sunday went to the battle by hasting park, it was part of City Fest which I wasn't aware of earlier. Anyhow I met Shaun in person, the guy who talked to me about reiki on msn for Yas. I met his friends too, who were starting out to break. Reiki masters and breakers, nice to meet them, good for me. I dunno if I seem annoying online... I feel like such a newbie in breakin.  It took me forever to do that 1000 word review... and it turned out to be lame very last minute. I hope she is not a hard marker.  Today's avant garde class, we brainstormed about what to do for project, seems very open still, less than 2 weeks of work, yikes.. Went to the Cellar last night with Sailor to see Matt the Alien. He was good, breaks/dnb/funk/soul/hip hop. It turned out better than I thought. I bumped into Brad too, haven't seen him in ages. He's kewl and he can be a jerk still haha. After I attuned Sailor, I'm scared he likes me cuz now I know he has Asian fetish. He was just being shy and strange. Well, I am not interested. I think I'll be single forever or something sigh.

      Haven't been writing. Weird incident was at the beach, a guy came and asked me if I heard of the UBC reiki club, so I said I do some reiki. He attuned me right on the spot, and apparently he goes around attuning people. I met up with him another day and he gave me more attunements and I gave him tamarasha symbol, and he gave me an aura expansion. It was all cool, and we did it outside of Starbucks around my house. So now I've been attuning people, it's been cool and people seem cool with it. Other than that I've been busy with school. Today's class was interesting because teacher expressed his concern, his anger from the paper that is forced upon us. He's not saying we are stupid from what he's seen, but that it's like a hoop for us to jump over. Anyways, somehow it came to doing something else and not essay as final project. It is very avant garde which is the topic of the course, and we are acting on it. It is difficult bc of grading and the lack of time which is 2 weeks, but it's very refreshing to do something outside of the box. What are we gonna do? We don't know yet.

      I finally got my amzon dvds and reiki book yesterday. From the book I found out that I am able to contact spirits, but that's kinda freaky. There's psychic attunement in the book, and I tried it. So far I haven't noticed anything yet, but supposingly I would be more aware and takes times to see its effect. We'll see...it's good book by Steve Murray though. It's nice day outside but I can't go out yet or for today bc of homework :(

      On Sat I was gonna go to Capris for May's bday and we got there late, so Jenny, John and I lined up for 1 and half hours just cuz it was her bday. By the time I got to the front, i was talking to Cindy and Derek who was in the smoking section, they said May was thinking of going to Luce! Anyhow Derek told me to just go, so we left and I was pissed. Jenny and John weren't, they are too easy going! Or maybe they just wanted to go to Luce anyways. After we went there, May showed up later pissed drunk. I told her I was kinda pissed. She said why. I told her I lined up for 1.5 hours. She said well, maybe you shoulda came earlier. I think she even said that it is my own fault. I am upset. Otherwise, the rest of the night was alright, and went to eat with Derek and his friends including John's gf with huge fake tits. I came back from work in the rain on my scooter, and my thighs and crotch were soaked, not a very good feeling. Sunday went shopping with Nathan, went to b girl class, went to Lotus for ragga jungle. It was not bad, twins showed up and at the end An did too, but he's all pissed cuz he couldn't find us for awhile.

      Having read an article from school on the abuse of Iraqis by Americans, and then I got a forward email with pics of Iraqi women being raped by Americans, I read more online and here are some links I found...  urlLink USA rape and sodomization of Iraqis worst than imagined  In the above page u can find pics of the prisoners abused, and another of pornographic rape pics.  urlLink even worse...  So they even fuck with their own people, or wait they are not "white."  I just really had to vent on this one, I feel very bad about all these crap. The worst is that I don't even know what is real or staged. How corrupted the media is! We are so desensitized. People just keep coming up with the most horrific porn, what's up with kiddie porn and beastiality? Don't people have morals?

      Cremaster cycle by Matthew Barney is an amazing work. I feel so strange and disoriented when i came out in the middle of series 5, especially after Gip said that it was crap before he left the theatre. Made me think alot, and even Nathan too. Now I see his artsy side, but maybe he doesn't enjoy having it stuck in his head. It still feels unsettling, but it sets in after awhile and munch on it some more in the head, slowly and for a long time. Leaving in the middle was unsettling. It's ok for Gip to have his own opinion of the video but it was very strong and makes things even more confusing.   It's super hot in the room right now >  Nice talk with a girl in HK who is interested in reiki.

      I can't concentrate on my reading right now. So I'm writing here.  I haven't written for a long time. Well, me Nathan and Gip went to Tofino. We surfed for 2 days, took float plane to Tofino, stayed at a nice condo, and had a few fights. Next trip is Hawaii with Nathan and Annie, for Janice's wedding. I can't wait, it should be good. No fights and problems, cross my fingers.  Today I went out with reiki master yas and he made me attune strangers. I feel iffy on that one, maybe I'm not open enough to do that or maybe it's just not my thing. So I guess I should think about if I should start doing that more in the future or just say no.  Twins are gone to HK now~ left me some drawings...barely worked on it yet. They are kinda nice on their own, but I guess the point is to add add add.  I haven't been productive for the past few days, not happy with myself. Caught up in booking cheap plane tix, reiki and crystal, reiking people, etc....  I feel like the water here tastes like chlorine. I try to drink things not from the fridge bc the chinese doctor told me is bad for me. I'm trying to heal my eczema with him, but then I feel like I'm blowing my $ away and it's not gone yet. It can be a bit frustrating.

      Just saw May cuz we had to go see Derek b4 he leaves to HK. I find that I'm growing apart with her. I don't like alot of her ways and thinking. That's why I got mad at her a few times b4. She is kinda impatient and snobby in a way. It's too bad cuz she's my cousin. Just venting I guess. I am trying to be happy and should try to be tolerant of others. I am probably happiest with myself because to me, there are always problems with other people. I should not let others get to me.

      I love my new 555 soul pants :D, and the 2 555 soul husband beaters from Nathan are nice too~~ Didn't write for awhile...I just know that recently there's a crazy lady that Yas told me to call who talked to me for 3 hours. Scary spiritual psychotic woman. Went to Apex last night, it was nice but I didn't pop much at all. Getting tired now...
