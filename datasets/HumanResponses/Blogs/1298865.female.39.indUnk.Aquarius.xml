      Well, all in all things are going well. Day two went well yesterday and I tried to report it to my journal on www.BFL101.com but it is down. Since Monday a.m. I've dropped 4 1/2 lbs of water weight (who's kidding who here - I KNOW it is water) but weight is weight and it feels good. I've eaten clean for two whole days (except for a nip of Brandy last night) and it feels terrific.  Yesterday I rode my bike indoors on the windtrainer for a whole 20 minutes! I can't wear my regular brace when I do that because it only gives my 90deg of movement, and I need about 115 to ride. So I wore the tensor, which seemed to be enough. And I iced it down after.  Today is a weights day. I will get going after I drop the kids off.  Kyle had a friend over yesterday and they spent hours on the computer going to funny links. A couple are great star trek TNG clips. I'll have to try to find them.  LCS

      Which I already knew, of course, but I am feeling pretty sorry for myself. Three and a half weeks ago I tore ligaments in my left knee, effectively curtailing most fun for the next several months. PMO!!! Anyway - the good news is that the bruising has now faded, the swelling is down, I can walk further than I could even a couple days ago. The bad news is that I am still wearing this silly brace and using a cane. The physiotherapist said I "did a real number" on my LCL and illotibial band (sp?) and can expect the healing process to take a while. It could have been worse right? I could have broken my leg or completely torn the LCL. It could have been my right leg and I wouldn't be able to drive.   So much for paddling this summer. At this point I still can't bend my knee far enough to get or out of a boat. I CAN still do weights though and I had a short somewhat successful trial on my indoor bike a couple days ago. I walked around the bloack today too - not exactly the 10km run I wished I was doing, but a few days ago I could only make it halfway around and today the whole loop was easy. Progress, progress.  My plan for tomorrow is to get up and ride my bike (indoors again) after I do my physio exercises.
