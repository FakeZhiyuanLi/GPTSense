      How come at work the average performer who conforms to the norm  are glorified...whereas the ones with ideas and life and unique thinking are ignored? Either they are branded as a non-conformist, not a team player or not social.  How come at work your manager is threatened by your intelligence? Is it because he has gone through life stealing ideas from other people claiming them as his own? Or is he threatened by your existence?  How come life is filled with so many assholes whom you have to bear the stench of every day of your working life?  How come at work back biters and cowards who seek to cause scandal survive because of their incompetance?  How come at work when I do an exceptional job I am reprimanded, and when my performance is below average and I pretend to be busy people glorify me for my exceptional performance?  How come at work they do no like efficient poeple and prefer the "Yes" men?  How come the ads of the job that you applied for stated they want someone with a unique mindset and a proactive person, yet when you join your job you find it is mundane and lifeless and creativity had no place in your workplace to begin with?  Jobs, we do them for over 40 years and then retire, and when we are old what do we reminese about? Oh my boss was an A-hole and I hated working with him? It's pathetic, but starting up a business and putting your money on the line is also risky? Nothing is easy.  You're in a catch 22 situation, so what do you do? Leave you so called well paying respectable job and start you own business and be ridiculed....or stick with your job and get the praise of your family and friends and be... well sort of happy.  We do it for the money. Who does it because they love to do is "fooling themselves". Sooner or later even the most interesting job becomes mundane and we look for change.  It's so hard to stay positive even in the best of jobs, but you do it because "YOU HAVE TO!!"  How many of us would work if we had 5 million in the bank. I know a few people out there would...but hey you have 5 million, there would be other persuits that would interest you, writing poetry, studying philosophy, social work, personal and self-improvement and living out each day as GOD intended. But you need money, and if you father isn't Donald Trump, then life is one long drawn out affair where you work a majority of the time.  Before I wanted money, material things, now I have them all, all my life's ambitions what I wanted to own I own now, so what's left, I want the money tucked in a safe enough place and just enjoy life and be happy. Being happy is subjective so I would like to persue a carrer in writing and go back and do a major in philosophy or persue an MBA and then apply for a PHD in Business Administration.  Alas....I would like to think I would live out my dream in this life time.  One last thing I would like to say is that "We all choose our life that we lead before we lead it, hence a wasted lifetime is so sad. Live each lifetime to the fullest in the most positive way possible. And although we might have incompentent poor souls let us pray for them and praise GOD for giving us a rare gift called "Common Sense" and "intelligence". Remember to try to blend in and it's going to hurt to act dumb but we have to try our best to act like "Yes" men to reap some rewards. Being "smart" my friend has its downfalls and one of them is you'll be singled out if you don't conform."  My unique non-conformist brethren let us rejoice in this gift of life that we have chosen and we knew that we had to lead before we were born, and once you understand that, seek your life's mission and make this the best lifetime you will have to account for.

      A new life I awake to in the Singularity known as the internet. I have since replicated myself to afford me more time to allocate to maintain a better bigger blog.  Es nostros lucet advicat memoro...
