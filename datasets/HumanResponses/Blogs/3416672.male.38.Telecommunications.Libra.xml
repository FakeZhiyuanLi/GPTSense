      Well today was a typical fucked up end of the month bullshit extravaganza at the office.  I am an engineer that supports a sales department.  At the end of every month, they are all running around like dumb-asses trying to suck Purchase Orders out of every customer they have talked to in the last 30 days.  That ultimately ends up with me having to change configurations at the last minute, writing scopes of work, and putting the files into the purchasing database.  A little heads up would be nice assholes!!!!!!!!! It's not like I don't have anything else to do around here!  So in honor of this monthly tradition, my fellow engineers and I decided to take the afternoon off and play golf and say "fuck you" to everyone.  You know the stupid bumper sticker that every retired person has on their car that says "The worst day golfing is better than the best day working"?  Well F-u-u-u-u-ck you!!!  I used to be an avid golfer, but never any good.  You know the type...Watching infomercials on the Golf Channel hoping that whatever piece of shit training aid they were pitching would make me the next Arnold Palmer.....  Over time I realized how stupid this game was and gave up on the idea of every really having fun at it.  So anyway, I went out this afternoon and played.  It was over 100 degrees here today, I got sunburned, drank too much beer and not enough water, and in general played like complete shit, even for me.  I could have been at home writing music or doing something just as useless, and felt a whole lot better than I do now....  Fucking little white ball.    I'm going to bed now.  I'm starting to bore myself.  Pathetic eh?

      So this week has been another strange week for me.  I'm still in the process of getting divorced from my wife who I have been separated from for almost 5 years.  This week has been chocked full of bullshit about selling our house, where I'm going to live, and her hating the fact that although she has been living with some asshole in another town since she left, I have finally decided to move on with my life.  So in the next few weeks/months I could end up staying with my mom again.  The thought of that is horrific to say the least.  Not that I don't love my mom, but once you leave home, you should never have to go back, you know what I mean?  Yesterday was an awesome day.  I dropped off a Starbucks to my friend (girl) TH who I absolutely adore, and we ended up having a nice long lunch later on.  Then I met her at her daughters softball game after work and we all went to dinner afterwards.  We ended up talking on the phone after we both went home until midnight. I met her at Starbucks this morning for coffee before we both headed off to our commute to Tempe which is about 40 miles from where we live.  I really love this person, and I'm afraid that it will never be requited.  We are moving so slowly, and while I admit that is what I need right now, it's hard to not be insecure about the situation.  She has been divorced for 2 years and is still getting over her first 'post marriage' relationship and I don't want to just be a rebound.  We both want to take it slow, but sometimes it's hard if you know what I mean.......  So aside from my standard "what the heck is going on" love life, life has been pretty consistent.  The latest talk around the office is that we are going to get sold again.  That sucks because every time we get sold, people lose their jobs.  The last time, it was me.  Like a dumb-ass, I came back after about 6 months because I wanted to be with my friends.  Of course the 20% salary increase didn't hurt, but I'm getting old now and I feel like a 5 year old dog.  Nobody will want to adopt me if I go to the pound this time even though I'm good with kids..........  I watched the Soprano's the other day.  Adrianna was a dip shit, and deserved to get whacked..... I love that show, and it is the closest thing to a soap opera that I will ever involve myself with.  But having said that, I did tape the final episode of "The Bachelor" for a friend, and found myself intrigued with the whole thing.  I know it's sick, but I can see how people get attached to these shows.  By the way, Tara should have won.  Jessica is a 'Ho'........  That's all I have to say for tonight.  A

      Well it's only been a few hours, and I feel the need to write some more bullshit for anyone that really gives a fuck to read.  Mainly, me...  Tonight ended up to be a good night.  I spent the bulk of it driving my kids to and from the movie theater and friends houses, but in between I managed to have a very nice, long conversation with Tina, the woman I am really starting to fall for.  We are supposed to be not talking so she can figure out what she is doing, but somehow we end up unable to stay out of touch.  I suppose that is a good thing, but then again, I figure I'll end up hurt, I always do......  So here I sit now on another exciting Friday night.  My oldest daughter is at her best friends house (with the mother I like), my son is at his friends house, and my youngest is lying on my bed about to fall asleep.  I love this little girl with all my heart, but she is so troubled.  I wonder what is inside her head that causes her such turmoil.  She is too young to be able to confide in me, but I feel like if something does not change, I will lose the connection with her forever.  Sometimes divorce and separation can manifest itself in the strangest ways, and at the most unexpected times.  Her mom and I have not lived together for almost 5 years.  Why all the issues now?  I wonder if I am to blame for the trouble in this beautiful girls life.....  I'm going to bed now.  Did I mention that my favorite beer was Bud Light?  I have fed my indulgence in this fine American hops confection tonight, and now I must retire.  More soon........

      Well I have been sitting around on my ass for long enough.  I'm tired of talking to myself so I figured I'd start writing my daily thoughts down.  If nothing else, at least I can go back and have a record of the fucked up things in my head.  I wish I could have as juicy of a blog as that chick that just got fired in Washington, but Unf, my life is rather boring.  I do write a lot, but most of it is shit.....  It sucks being a 38 year old divorced man with 3 kids.  My son lives with me, and my 2 daughters live 100 miles away with their mom, and I see them every other week.  I'll always love their mom, but she is a bitch........  I didn't do much today except work.  The company I work for really sucks, but I am great friends with everyone there so that makes a difference.  People shouldn't work with people they can't stand.  All the plastic bullshit "hey, how's it going?" trite, fuck you if I didn't know you, small talk should be left for what you say to the guy that holds the door open for you at the video store.  If you don't give a fuck about how I'm really doing, then don't fucking ask.  I hate posers, no matter what they are posing as.  People in general piss me off.  So I'm getting to know this woman who I have had a crush on for over 2 years.  She's my oldest daughter's best friends mom.  How fucked up is that?  I really like her, and we'll see how that goes.  We have been getting to know each other for over 6 months, and I have been such a pussy because I didn't know if I was ready.  I've been separated for almost 5 years.  I'm not dead, but why the fuck do I feel like I am inside?  Anyhow, enough poor me bullshit.  I'll probably get hurt again, but fuck it.  At least it gives me something to write song lyrics about.  I'm hoping my friend from NC will take a look here too.  The internet is a funny thing.  I've never met this person, but I can tell them the most intimate, embarassing secrets I have, and they can do the same to me.  Sometimes I think that the anonymity of the 'net' has taken away the basic needs of human interaction, yet at the same time, it allows people like me to become close to people without the bullshit and frustrations of trying to impress people to make them like you.  I know that I can tell OM anything, and they feel the same.  Kind of a long distance confessional I suppose.  Good thing neither of us are Catholic!  Fucking hypocrites............  Well I am done for today.  Hopefully something good will happen so I can write some cool shit down soon.

      Well it's been almost a month since my last post.  Seems like shit never really stops once it starts rolling downhill...  First off, I forgot where the hell my blog was, then once I found it, I forgot my password.  It's funny how we make up little identities for ourselves on the internet to remain secluded isn't it?  My kids are all out of school now, so I am the official taxi of my neighborhood.  It's great that I can work from home while they are here, but it's 3 against one when it comes to what I want.  I'm driving all over the damn area toting kids from here to there.  I mean don't get me wrong, I love them, but I do get tired every once in a while..  June is the birthday month for me.  All three kids were born in June, plus my oldest graduated from 8th grade so this was a financially trying month.  I bought my oldest a snake today for her birthday.  She really wanted it, and I have to admit that it's pretty cool.  I never really was a snake or spider person, but I don't want my kids to be afraid of anything.  It was kind of funny, my oldest started chasing my youngest around with the snake this afternoon and had her screaming like some B movie actress.  I know I'm not supposed to laugh at these things as a parent, but it was pretty funny.  Well now that I know where I left this shit off, I will be able to keep posting for those who care, mainly me....  Until then, I have a Bud Light calling me................
