       urlLink  Betsy Hoffman sheds tears over her cunt comment .    I really feel for the 'lil cunt you know.  And I still intend to call her a cunt in the most endearing tone possible if I ever meet her.  She may have apologized for trying to defend the term cunt, but she is no where near apologizing for defending the assholes who demoralized Katie Hnida.  OK I just wanted to work cunt into every sentence.

       urlLink Text of John Kerry's speech in Denver yesterday .  In the name of Punk Rock, S. and I took a few seconds to belittle some pro-Bush protestors with such classics as "Fuck Bush!" and a little gesture I like to call "The Bird", coupled with our shit eating grins, I hope to have disturbed at least one old woman.

      Well the strawberry cheesecake from the coffee shop across the street was as good tasting as I has assumed, watching from afar.  A perfect companion to some bong hits and reality television bliss to cap off a work night.  it would come back to haunt me, first at 12:30 and then 5:30.  My god the humanity of it all.

       urlLink Somewhere Mike Moore is combatting his Valenti-inspired depression with fried foods .    Mike's attempt to get Fahrenheit 9/11 a PG-13 rating despite apparent graphic violence goes down in, well, flames.  Are there any teens who care about things other than school pecking order, sex, or drugs?  Not while I was one, damnit!  Any teen who can't get into an R-movie should go see it with their parents anyway.  Families coming together to destroy freedom and such!

       urlLink I grabbed the fullscreen version of Matrix Revolution by accident .    WHY GOD WHY?  Why the fuck do they even sell a version of the movie with reduced content, and try to pass it off as almost the same thing?  Sure it says fullscreen at the top of the DVD, but, like, FUCK.

       urlLink Evil Senators seek to dismantle iPod's!   Thanks EFF for fighting the good fight.  This new act is much worse than DMCA, offering all kinds of leagal provisions against any device that has the potential to aid in piracy.  You can have my iPod when you pry it from my cold, dead hands!  I get the feeling like people would launch a revolution over iPods before Iraq ...

       urlLink They won't get away with it this time .  The state does a surprising 180.  Good for them.  Too bad these people didn't get to vote in 2000 and we got stuck with a dingleberry for a president!    UPDATE   Above link may be broken for registration that even I won't bother to do.  This decision comes  urlLink at the release of the 47,000 names  that made up the list of voters who may be purged.  Florida will  urlLink restore voting rights to some 2,500  of the 47,000 they intended to deny voting in 2004.  That compared to  urlLink 170,000  some odd voters purged in 2000.

      Watched the movie this weekend.  That is, I downloaded a fairly decent bootleg (no doubt a theatre cam) using  urlLink BitTorrent .  Mike Moore said it was ok to steal it.  Impressions follow.  It was more emotionally exploitative than I had hoped for.  Probably a little more than I expected, even.  The montage for the actual 9/11 event was subdued albeit heart wrenching.  The close ups of a mother describing her grief at losing a son to war affected me the most and could have been cut back a little I think.  Subtitled Iraqi mothers screaming at their loss of family were equally disturbing.  The point (I hope) of all this severe emotion is to impress the silly liberal ideal that killing someone is wrong, and touches lives in ways we can't comprehend.  Weird concept.  I knew once I had watched the film, I could label it.  Clearly Moore's bias prevents this from being called a documentary.  This movie is reality television.  Every single thing you see is real, but the images and sounds are put together in a produced manner to impress a particular point of view.  A thin line of actual reality is shown, but truth is reflected no matter how shallow it may seem.  That said, the movie is effective in laying out the truth vis a vis the Bush admin's fundamental mishandling of the War on Terror.  Don't call it propaganda, unless you are ready to call White House press releases the same.  As a friend just told me, I don't agree with how Mike Moore handled the whole movie but someone had to make that movie, and it wasn't me.  Laying out everything in a line like he did will open some eyes.  Nothing new in the movie, but a good way to present facts en masse.

       urlLink Police, acting on training kill an innocent man .  After the victim of kidnapping and abuse escaped and spoke to police, the cops crawled into her house through a second story window and killed an innocent man.  I hand no blame to the police officers.  What is wrong is how they responded to the context of this situation.  Bad training, bad leadership, bad execution, which is it?  We should not have a climate where police officers are put into situations like this and expected to come out unscathed.
