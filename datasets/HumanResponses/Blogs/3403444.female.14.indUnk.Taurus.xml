      One morning, a man got on an elevator on the fourth floor which had a woman already in it. The man looks at the woman and says, "You have the most beautiful hair!" The woman, angrily gets out on the next floor and takes the stairs.  The next day the same man comes on the elevator on the fourth floor and sees the woman again. "Your hair! It looks so smooth and silky!" Furious, the woman gets off the next floor and decides again to take the stairs.  The day after that, the same man and woman end up on the elevator again. "I just really have to say that your hair smells amazing!" The woman looks at the man and at a lost for words, storms out of the elevator.  That day at the office she is appraoched by her boss who sees that she is distressed. "What's the matter?" he asks. "This whole week, you have come to work late and very upset." "Well every day a man, the same man, tells me on the elevator that my hair smells really good," the woman replies. "What's wrong with that?" her boss inquires. Which she yells, "He is a midget!"

        	 	  Math Trouble  A little girl was failing math. Her mother enrolled her in Catholic school in the hopes to improve her math grades. During the first marking period, her mother noticed a dramatic improvement in her math studies. The girl would refuse playing with friends and eating dessert after dinner in order to study more.  On report card day, her mother was astonished to see that her daughter got an A+ in math. She asked her daughter, “Why the sudden change of attitude about math -- do the nuns punish you?” The girl replied, “No, but when I saw the little man on the wall nailed to the plus sign, I knew that this school is very serious about math!”

       why are guitars better than women?  REASONS WHY GUITARS ARE BETTER THAN WOMEN  (please note, I have eliminated the obvious copies like "you can have a guitar all month long", and "a guitar doesn't care how many guitars you own")  1. A guitar has a volume knob 2. If you break a guitar's G-string, it only costs $0.79 for a new one 3. You can make a guitar scream as loud as you want it to 4. You can unplug a guitar 5. You can finger a guitar for hours without it complaining it wants more 6. Other people can play your guitar without it getting upset 7. You can finger a guitar in public and get applause, not arrested 8. You can have a guitar any color you want and noone will care 9. If your guitar gets loose, you can just tighten up the strings 10. If your guitar doesn't make sounds you like, you can change pickups 11. You can use four fingers at a time on a guitar 12. If your guitar strings are too heavy, you can just get a lighter set 13. You can have a guitar professionally adjusted to *your* liking 14. If you scratch a guitar's back, it's unintentional, not required 15. You can go to a guitar shop and play all the guitars you want for free  Now, for the opposite:   REASONS WHY WOMEN ARE BETTER THAN GUITARS   1. Women are more fun when the power goes out 2. You can't get your guitar wet 3. Ever try to screw a guitar? 4. The input to a guitar is only 1/4" (ouch!) 5. A guitar won't beg to be played 6. It's no fun to tie your guitar to a bed and spray whipped cream on it 7. When playing a guitar, you can use your teeth, but not your tongue 8. Guitars aren't very aggressive 9. A guitar won't play you back 10. You need two hands to make a guitar scream 11. A guitar won't scratch *your* back 12. A guitar won't drive you home if you're too drunk 13. A guitar doesn't care who plays it 14. You can't play two guitars at once

       Two doctors opened an office in a small town.  They put up a sign reading: "Dr Smith and Dr Jones, Psychiatry and Proctology."  The town council was not too happy with the sign, so the doctors changed it to: "Hysterias and Posteriors."  This was not acceptable either, so in an effort to satisfy the council, they changed the sign to: "Schizoids and Hemorrhoids."  No go! Next they tried "Catatonics and Colonics" Thumbs down again.  Then came, "Manic-Depressives and Anal-Retentives."  But is was still not good! So they tried:  "Minds and Behinds"  "Analysis and Anal Cysts"  "Nuts and Butts"  "Freaks and Cheeks"  "Loons and Moons"  "Lost Souls and Ass Holes"  None worked.  Almost at their wits' end, the doctors finally came up with a title they thought might be accepted by the council:  "Dr Smith and Dr Jones, Odds and Ends."  APPROVED!

       Fresh from her shower, a woman stands in front of the mirror, complaining to her husband that her breasts are too small. Instead of characteristically telling her it's not so, her husband uncharacteristically comes up with a suggestion. "If you want your breasts to grow, then every day take a piece of toilet paper and rub it between your breasts for a few seconds." Willing to try anything, the wife fetches a piece of toilet paper and stands in front of the mirror, rubbing it between her breasts. "How long will this take?" she asks. "They will grow larger over a period of years," he replies. The wife stops. "Do you really think rubbing a piece of toilet paper between my breasts every day will make my breasts larger over the years?" Without missing a beat the husband says, "Worked for your butt, didn't it?"

      Here's an easy game to play. Here's an easy thing to say:  If a packet hits a pocket on a socket on a port, And the bus is interrupted as a very last resort, And the address of the memory makes your floppy disk abort, Then the socket packet pocket has an error to report!  If your cursor finds a menu item followed by a dash, And the double-clicking icon puts your window in the trash, And your data is corrupted 'cause the index doesn't hash, Then your situation's hopeless, and your system's gonna crash!  You can't say this? What a shame sir! We'll find you Another game sir.  If the label on the cable on the table at your house, Says the network is connected to the button on your mouse, But your packets want to tunnel on another protocol, That's repeatedly rejected by the printer down the hall,  And your screen is all distorted by the side effects of gauss So your icons in the window are as wavy as a souse, Then you may as well reboot and go out with a bang, 'Cause as sure as I'm a poet, the sucker's gonna hang!  When the copy of your floppy's getting sloppy on the disk, And the microcode instructions cause unnecessary RISC, Then you have to flash your memory and you'll want to RAM your ROM. Quickly turn off the computer and be sure to tell your mom!

God knew that Adam would never be able to remember which night to put the garbage on the curb.   	  5. 	God knew that if the world was to be populated, men would never be able to handle the pain and discomfort of childbearing.   	  4. 	As "Keeper of the Garden," Adam would never remember where he left his tools.   	  3. 	Apparently, Adam needed someone to blame his troubles on when God caught him hiding in the garden.   	  2. 	As the Bible says, "It is not good for man to be alone!"   	    	And finally, the number ONE reason that God created Eve...   	  1. 	When God finished the creation of Adam, He stepped back, scratched His head, and said, "I can do better than THAT!"

      Rule One 	If you pull into my driveway and honk you'd better be delivering a package, because you're sure as heck not picking anything up.   	  Rule Two 	You do not touch my daughter in front of me. You may glance at her, so long as you do not peer at anything below her neck. If you cannot keep your eyes or hands off of my daughter's body, I will remove them.   	  Rule Three 	I am aware that it is considered fashionable for boys of your age to wear their trousers so loosely that they appear to be falling off their hips. Please don't take this as an insult, but you and all of your friends are complete idiots. Still, I want to be fair and open minded about this issue, so I propose this compromise: You may come to the door with your underwear showing and your pants ten sizes too big, and I will not object. However, In order to assure that your clothes do not, in fact, come off during the course of your date with my daughter, I will take my electric staple gun and fasten your trousers securely in place around your waist.   	  Rule Four 	I'm sure you've been told that in today's world, sex without utilizing a barrier method of some kind can kill you. Let me elaborate: when it comes to sex, I am the barrier, and I WILL kill you.   	  Rule Five 	In order for us to get to know each other, we should talk about sports, politics, and other issues of the day. Please do not do this. The only information I require from you is an indication of when you expect to have my daughter safely back at my house, and the only word I need from you on this subject is early.   	  Rule Six 	I have no doubt you are a popular fellow, with many opportunities to date other girls. This is fine with me as long as it is okay with my daughter. Otherwise, once you have gone out with my little girl, you will continue to date no one but her until she is finished with you. If you make her cry, I will make YOU cry.   	  Rule Seven 	As you stand in my front hallway, waiting for my daughter to appear, and more than an hour goes by, do not sigh and fidget. If you want to be on time for the movie, you should not be dating. My daughter is putting on her makeup, a process which can take longer than painting the Golden Gate Bridge. Instead of just standing there, why don't you do something useful, like changing the oil in my car.   	  Rule Eight 	The following places are not appropriate for a date with my daughter: Places where there are beds, sofas, or anything softer than a wooden stool. Places lacking parents, policemen, or nuns. Places where there is darkness. Places where there is dancing, holding hands, or happiness. Places where the ambient temperature is warm enough to induce my daughter to wear shorts, tank tops, midriff T-shirts, or anything other than overalls, a sweater, and a goose down parka zipped up to her chin. Movies with a strong romantic or sexual theme are to be avoided; movies which feature chainsaws are okay. Hockey games are okay.

      10. 	I think of you as a brother. (You remind me of that inbred banjo-playing geek in "Deliverance.") 	  9. 	There's a slight difference in our ages. (You are one jurassic geezer.)   	  8. 	I'm not attracted to you in 'that' way. (You are the ugliest dork I've ever laid eyes upon.)   	  7. 	My life is too complicated right now. (I don't want you spending the whole night or else you may hear phone calls from all the other guys I'm seeing.)   	  6. 	I've got a boyfriend (who's really my male cat and a half gallon of Ben and Jerry's).   	  5. 	I don't date men where I work. (Hey, bud, I wouldn't even date you if you were in the same 'solar system', much less the same building.)   	  4. 	It's not you, it's me. (It's not me, it's you.)   	  3. 	I'm concentrating on my career. (Even something as boring and unfulfilling as my job is better than dating you.)   	  2. 	I'm celibate. (I've sworn off only the men like you.)   	    	...and the number 1 rejection line given by women (and what it actually means)   	  1. 	Let's be friends. (I want you to stay around so I can tell you in excruciating detail about all the other men I meet and have sex with. It's that male perspective thing)

      I've worked all week so I'm too tired to go! The preacher moves around to much. There are no people my age so I'm not going. They don't meet my needs. There are too many hypocrites in church. There are too many sinners in church. I'm too young - I'll go when I'm too old to have any more fun. It's boring. I'm not good enough. I'm still a sinner. I'll go to church after I stop smoking. I'll go to church after I stop drinking. I'll go to church after I stop cussin'. I still go to the bars on Saturday night. I like to party. I work seven days a week. I don't have time for God. I work six days a week. The seventh day belongs to me. Ain't got time. I work lots of overtime....so I'm too tired to worship God. The Sabbath day is Saturday, not Sunday. I don't get up in time on Sunday morning. I have nothing to wear. I don't think I really believe in God.... I'm just not sure. I don't believe in God. I listen to church on the radio. I attend church by watching it on TV. I watch Billy Graham every week. I belong to the 700 club; that's good enough. I don't do nothing bad, so I'm goin' to heaven anyway. My family can get me into heaven after I'm dead. I'll get religion when I get to purgatory. I'll get religious in my next life. I don't understand what's goin' on anyway. I can't follow what they do, so why should I just sit there. I can't afford to give anything, and I don't want to be embarrassed. I don't want to put anything in the plate. Why should I give my money to some church? I don't want to be around a bunch of bible thumpers. The service is too long. The sermon is too long. I don't like them serving wine every two weeks. I don't like them serving grape juice - they should serve wine. I don't like the songs we have to sing. I don't like the songs the choir sings. The choir is too loud. The choir doesn't sing often enough. The choir isn't very good. It's too cold in there, why don't they turn up the heat. It's too hot, why don't they get air conditioning. The air conditioner is too loud. It's too stuffy, why don't they open some windows. The people always try to get me to join the church. I hate it when they ask me to stand up and introduce myself. I'm not religious. I don't believe in religion. I worship God at home when I'm alone. Pastors can't forgive sins. I don't have transportation. My wife doesn't go, so why should I. My husband doesn't go, so why should I. My family never went to church when I was a kid. There aren't any good-looking guys there. There aren't any good-looking girls there. I don't like the statue of Jesus. Jesus wasn't a blue eyed white man. The pews are too hard. It's uncomfortable in church. I never know what time I'm going to get home. I can't find a baby sitter on Sunday. The songs are too old. The songs are too European. Why don't they sing Negro spirituals? They're always asking me for more of my money. I don't like all the hollering and yelling some people do. I should be able to send in money if I want without having to put money in a plate. I can't go to church because my butt hurts from all the sitting and I need joint replacements in my knee's from all the kneeling. The organ is too loud. They don't play the organ. I'm not coming if they are going to play guitars and drums. The whole service is designed for old people. The whole service caters to young people. They don't sing the songs I like. Nobody notices when I'm gone anyway. I don't go to church on Sunday because getting the kids dressed in their Sunday Best first thing in the morning makes me cuss and curse the Lord......very loudly. I'm too hung over to get outta bed that early on Sunday. God made Football.....doesn't that cover it? The guy I slept with last night....you know.....what's his name.....couldn't tell me where the nearest church service was.....heathen that he must be! Three words: Church On Line I atoned for my sins last year. I'm allergic to incense. I'm allergic to wine. I'm allergic to unleavened bread. My cat is a prophet, I get all my Godly advice straight from the cat's mouth. If the cat doesn't tell me to got to church, I consider it great wisdom of the prophet. I don't go to church cause I have a feeling that God doesn't like agnostics. I am a song writer and wrote a song about excuses people give for not serving and worshipping the Lord. Your page covered most of them plus some. Here are some others: I must mow the yard. I have to wash the car. It's family reunion day - most people don't seem to know that they CAN have a family reunion on a Saturday! What go to church? Sorry I'm Catholic. I can't go to church, my name is Judas. My husband and I both work for our church and if he doesn't feel like going into church on Sunday, he'll often say, I just spent 5 (or 6) days there, if we go to church today, I will be in church everyday for the last 12 days. That much church can kill a person. This parish is too politically correct. Church Excuse: Veni, Vidi, NoN-Velcro. (I came, I Saw, I didn't stick around.) Sorry I couldn't go to church last week, the devil is a horrible thing. Sorry I missed Church, but I was too busy practicing witchcraft and becoming a lesbian. Here's an excuse for not going to church: The devil made me do it! I'm sorry I couldn't come to church. The virgin sacrifice took longer than we expected. I did not miss Church, I found a new Church. It’s a wonderful Church so singing, no sit-stand-kneel, it’s very peaceful. Every Sunday you can faithfully find me at Saint Mattress. I did not miss church, in fact I had quite a good time with out coming to church. Sorry I missed church today. I was performing a human sacrifice. Sorry I'm late for church. I was too busy finishing my human sacrifice. eat popcorn so I won't be attending church for the rest of football season.

Julius Caesar: To come, to see, to conquer.  Darwin: It was the logical next step after coming down from the trees.  Bob Dylan: How many roads must one chicken cross?  Zsa Zsa Gabor: It probably crossed to get a better look at my legs, which, thank goodness, are good, dahling.   Gilligan: The traffic started getting rough; the chicken had to cross. If not for the plumage of its peerless tail the chicken would be lost, the chicken would be lost!  Ernest Hemingway: To die. In the rain.  Saddam Hussein: This was an unprovoked act of rebellion and we were quite justified in dropping 50 tons of nerve gas on it.  Martin Luther King: It had a dream.

      "My lips are red," the lady said "I'd like for you to look Not the ones upon my face, The ones within my nook."  "Any pain?" the doctor asked. "Any rash or swell?" "Not a thing," she said to him, Yet something is not well.  With trusty mirror in my hand, Upon the folds I gazed. Through the tangled matted hair, The labial lips I raised.  What a sight to greet my eye! What a lovely thing to see! Flaming red, the tissues were (Or so they seemed to me)  "Let us have a look," he said. "Open wide the door." She opened up the pearly gates And bared the pelvic floor.  "There's nothing here that I can see To cause you pain and strife. My advice to you," he said, "Is, Lady, get a life!"

      Little Willie, full of glee, Put radium in grandma's tea. Now he thinks it quite a lark To see her shining in the dark.    Little Willie with a thirst for gore Nailed his mommy's baby to the door. Mother said with humor quaint, Willie dear, don't spoil the paint.    Willie was thirsty in chemistry, But now he is nevermore. For what he thought was H2O Was H2SO4!    Willie thought that life was a bore, So he drank some H2SO4. But his dad was an M.D. Who gave him some CaCO3. Now Willie's neutralized, it's true, But he's also full of CO2!    Willie looking in the gun Pulls the trigger just for fun. Mother says in tones so pained, "Willie is so scatter-brained"    Willie found some dynamite, Cut the fuse off, lit the wick. Curiosity never pays. It rained Willie several days.    Little Willie, wrapped in sashes, Fell in the fire and burned to ashes. Now the house grows damp and chilly, Because we haven't the heart to poke poor Willie.    Little Willie, with a shout, Gouged his brother's eyeballs out. Stomped on them to make them pop. Mother said, "Now Willie, stop."    Little Willie took a rocket, Put it in his father's pocket. Then he said to cousin Dan, "Daddy is a traveling man."    Little Willie found a mirror, Went and sucked the mercury off, Thinking in his childish error, It would cure his whooping cough. At the funeral, Willie's mother Sadly said to Mrs. Brown, "'Twas a chilly day for Willie When the mercury went down."    Little Willie, home from school, Where he'd learned the Golden Rule, Said, "If I eat all this cake, Sis won't get a stomach ache."    Little Willie, Brand new skates Hole in ice Pearly gates    Willie bashed open baby's head To see if brains are gray or red What a naughty boy is he He shall have no jam for tea.    Willie poisoned Auntie's tea Auntie died in agony. Uncle came and looked quite vexed. "Really, Will," he said, "what next?"    Little Willie, mean as hell Drowned his sister in the well. Mother said, while drawing water, "Gee, it's hard to raise a daughter."    Little Willie at a passing gent Threw a batch of fresh cement. Then he said, "Wait until you dry! Then you'll be a real hard guy!"    Little Willie on his bike Through the village took a hike. Mrs. Thompson blocked the walk; She will live, but still can't talk.    Willie fell down the elevator, Wasn't found 'till six days later. Then the neighbors sniffed, "Gee whiz! What a spoiled child Willie is!"    Willie in the cauldron fell; See the grief on mother's brow! Mother loved her Darling well, Willie's quite hard-boiled by now.    Willie's cute as cute can be. Beneath his brother, only three, He lit a stick of dynamite. Now brother's simply out of sight.    Willie, I regret to state, Cut his sister up for bait. We miss her when it's time to dine, But Willie's fish taste simply fine.    Willie's on the railroad track The engine gave a squeal. The engineer just took a spade, And scraped him off the wheel.

      Up popped the griffen from the coconut grove. He's a mean mother fucker, you could tell by his clothes. He's got a two button beany and a four button stitch. He's a cock sucking, mother fucking son of a bitch.  Well he ran through the jungle with his cock in his hand. Saying, "Mean mother fucker, I'm the king of this land." He chased this broad up a coconut tree, And she said, "Ooh Gee Baby !  Let me be !"  So he lined up a hundred broads against the wall. For a two dollar bet he fucked them all. Fucked ninety-eight till his cock turned blue, Wacked off, sucked off, screwed the other two.  When he died, he went straight to hell. Fucked the devil's wife and his daughter as well. And on his tomb stone written in green, Here lies the human fuckin' machine.  (the ending below is sung to tune of "Shave and a haircut... Two bits !") - Sung by the whorehouse... quartet Do you have a hard-on... not yet. Don't l-e-t... it... sag !

      Mary had a little sheep. It went to bed with her to sleep. The sheep turned out to be a ram, And Mary had a little lamb!    Mary had a little lamb, Her father shot it dead. Now Mary takes the lamb to school Between two hunks of bread.    Mary had a little lamb, Its fleece was black as soot. And everywhere that Mary went, Its sooty foot it put.    Mary had a little lamb And it was always gruntin' She tied it to a five-bar gate And kicked its little cunt in.    Mary had a little lamb, She thought it was quite silly. She threw it up into the air, And caught it by its ... Willy was a watch dog, Lying on the grass. Down came a bumble bee, And bit him on the ... Asssssk no questions, Tell no lies, I saw a policeman, Doing up his ... Flies are bad, Mosquitos are worse, And this is the end of my silly little verse.   Mary had a kitten. Tommy had a pup. Alfonzo had a crocodile That ate the others up!    Mary had a little lamb, A pizza and some prunes, A piece of pie, a glass of milk, and then some maccaroons. It made the waiters happy to see her order so And when they carried Mary out, her face was white as snow!    Mary had a little lamb, Its fleece was white as snow. And every where that Mary went, The lamb was sure to go. Now Mary found the price of meat too high, Which really didn't please her. Tonight she is having the leg of lamb, The rest is in the freezer.    Mary had a little lamb, She tied it to a pylon. 10,000 volts went up it's ass And turned it's wool to nylon.    Mary had a little watch, She kept it in her garter. And when the boys asked her the time, She knew what they were after.    Mary had a little lamb; You've heard this tale before; But did you know she passed her plate; And had a little more!   Mary had a little lamb, She kept in her yard. Every time she took her panties off, His little wooly dick got hard.    Mary had a little lamb, Its fleece was black as charcoal Every time it jumped the fence You could see its little arsehole.    Mary had a little lamb, The doctors were astounded. Everywhere that Mary went, Gynecologists surrounded.    Mary had a little lamb, The doctor was suprised. When Old McDonald had a farm, The poor guy nearly died.    Mary had a little lamb A little roast, a little jam An ice-cream soda topped with fizz Boy, how sick our Mary is.    Mary had a li'l lamb Its wool was soft and pink A big bad wolf came by one day Now Mary has a mink!    Mary had a li'l lamb Her father shot it dead It still goes to school with her Between two chunks of bread!    Mary had a little lamb, Its fleece was as white as snow, And everywhere that Mary went The lamb was sure to go. It followed her to school one day, school one day, school one day, It followed her to school one day, And a big black dog fucked it!

      Jack and Jill went up the hill To fetch a pail of water. Jill forgot to take the pill, So now they've got a daughter.  Jack and Jill went up the hill For just an itty bitty. Jill's now two months overdue, And Jack has left the city.    Jack and Jill Went up the hill, Each with a quarter. Jill came down with fifty cents; Do you think they went for water?    Jack and Jill Went up the hill To fetch a pail of water. Silly Jill forgot the pill And now they have a daughter.    Jack and Jill Went up the hill To fetch a pail of water. Jack fell down on top of Jill And now they have another daughter.    Jack and Jill went up the hill To have a little fun. Stupid Jill!  Forgot that pill! So now they have a son.    Jack and Jill went up the hill With a keg of brandy Jack got stewed, Jill got screwed Now it's Jack Jill and Andy    Jack and Jill went up the hill, To smoke a little leaf. Jack got high, Pulled down his fly, And Jill said, "Where's the beef!"    Jack and Jill Went up the hill And planned to do some kissing. Jack made a pass, and grabbed her ass And now two of his front teeth are missing.    Jack and Jill Went up the hill Both carrying a bucket. When Jill bent down Her ass was round And Jack decided to read a good book  :)    Jack and Jill went up the hill For a bit of hanky panky Jill came back With a very sore crack Jack must have been a Yankee  Jack and Jill Went up the hill Each with a buck and a quarter Jill came down with two-fifty The fuckin' whore!    Jack and Jill went up the hill On an elephant. Jill got down and helped Jack off the elephant.

      Letitia has a large one, and so has cousin Luce. Eliza has a small one, though large enough for use. Beneath a soft and glossy curl, each Lass has one in front. To find it in an animal, you at the tail must hunt.  Hermaphrodites have none; Mermaids are minus too. Nell Gwynn possessed a double share, if books we read are true. It's used by all in Nuptial Bliss, in Carnal Pleasures found. Destroy it, Life becomes extinct, the world is but a sound.  Lasciviousness here has its sources, Harlots its use apply. Without it, Lust has never been, and even Love would die. Now tell me what this wonder is, but pause before you guess it. If you are mother, maid, or man, I swear you don't possess it.   thought i knew the answer... now im not so sure..help!

      A gentleman wanders around the campus of a college looking for the library. He approaches a student and asked, "Excuse me, young man. Would you be good enough and tell me where the library is at?" The student, in a very arrogant and belittling tone, replied, "I sorry, sir, but at this school, we are taught never to end a sentence with a preposition!" The gentleman smiled, and in a very apologetic tone replied, "I beg your pardon. Please allow me to rephrase my question. Would you be good enough to tell me where the library is at, asshole?"

That shirt is very becomming on you, But then I would be cumming if I were on you too.  I hate when you leave, but I love to watch you go. Hey my shoes are having a party, why don't you tell your pants to come down?  Do you work for UPS, because I could a swore you were checking out my package!  Did you know we are all naked under our clothes?  You've got the whitest teeth I've ever cum upon.  Hey, that's a nice dress, but it would look better wadded up in a ball next to my bed.  I'll give you a nickel to tickle my pickle.  Mean people suck , but nice people swallow. Which one are you? I may look fat but I have an ass like a jackhammer.  Baby, I'm not Fred Flinstone, but I could make your Bedrock.  Baby, are you from Tennessee cause your the only Ten I see!  Hey, babe, I have 50 million dollars, can I deposit somthing in your vault!  Your lips are like wine and I want to get drunk You remind me of a championship bass, I don't know whether to mount you or eat you.  Do you sleep on your stomach? Can I? Do you like your eggs scrambled, or fertilized?  Screw me if I'm wrong, but don't you wanna kiss me? Hey are your parents terrorists? Because your the bomb!  You must be a butcher, cause I love the way you handle my meat. Is your father a baker? Because you've got great buns!   Hi! My name is Pogo, want to jump on my stick?  The only bone I like in your body is mine!  You know, I might not be the best looking guy in here... But I'm the only one who's talking to you.  Do you have a quarter because my parents told me to call them when I find my wife.  Come over and sit on my lap. We'll talk about the first thing that pops up. Can we play train? You can sit on my face and I will chew chew chew.  Hello, my name is x, remember it because you will be screaming it later!  If I could rearrange the alphabet I would put U and I together. Why don't we add you and me, subtract our clothes, divide our legs and multiply?  Hey, baby, why don't we go behind a rock and get a little boulder? Love your dress but, it'd look better on my floor. I lost my phone number can I have yours? Hey, girl, I was wondering, can I make you fat for nine months? Would you like to come over to my place for sex and pizza? Or just sex?

My dad said never talk to a stranger so can I have your name. I sure like what you're wearing... can I talk you out of it?  Yo baby, you can be my dairy queen, and I'll be your burger king.

      A bather whose clothing was strewed By breezes that left her quite nude    Saw a man come along    And, unless I'm quite wrong, You expected this line to be lewd.    There was a young girl named Sapphire Who succumbed to her lover's desire.    She said, "It's a sin,    But now that it's in, Could you shove it a few inches higher?"    A young curate, just new to the cloth, At sex was surely no sloth.    He preached masturbation    To his whole congregation, And was washed down the aisle on the froth.    A gentle old lady I knew Was dozing one day in her pew.    When the preacher yelled "Sin!"    She said, "Count me in! And as soon as the service is through!"    A progressive professor named Tinners Held classes each evening for sinners.    They were graded and spaced    So the very debased Would not be held back by beginners.    A beat schizophrenic said, "Me? I am not I, I'm a tree."    But another more sane,    Shouted, "I'm a Great Dane!" And covered his pants leg with pee.    There once was a hacker named Ken Who inherited truckloads of Yen.    So he built him some chicks    Made of silicon chips, And hasn't been heard from since then.    There once was a freshman named Lin Whose tool was as thin as a pin.    A virgin named Joan    From a Bible belt home Said, "This won't be much of a sin!"    There once was a couple named Kelley Who lived their life belly to belly.    Because in their haste,    They used Library Paste, Instead of Petroleum Jelly.    There once was a young man named Gene Who invented a screwing machine.    Concave and convex,    It could please either sex, And it played with itself in between. (But, oh, what a bastard to clean!)    A pretty young maiden from France Decided she'd "just take a chance".    She let herself go    For an hour or so, And now all her sisters are aunts.    There was a young lady named Hall, Wore a newspaper dress to a ball.    The dress caught fire,    And burned her entire Front page, sports section, and all.    There once was a poor man named Crocket Whose balls got caught in a socket.    His wife was a bitch,    So she cranked on the switch, And Crocket took off like a rocket!    She stood on the bridge at midnight. Her legs are like a quiver.    She gave a cough,    Her legs fell off, And floated down the river.    While I, with my usual enthusiasm, Was exploring in Ermintrude's busiasm,    She explained, "They are flat,    But think nothing of that - You will find that my sweet sister Susiasm."    A comely young widow named Ransom Was ravished three times in a hansom.    When she cried out for more    A voice from the floor Said, "Lady, I'm Simpson, not Samson."    A widow, who fancied a man some, Was diddled three times in a hansome.    When she clamored for more,    Her young man became sore, And exclaimed "My name's Simpson not Samson."    He hated to mend, so young Ned Called in a cute neighbor instead.    Her husband said, "Oh my,    When you stitched up his torn fly, Did you have to bite off the thread?"    There was a gay countess of Bray, And you may think it odd when I say,    That in spite of high station,    Rank and education, She always spelled cunt with a "k".    A wanton young lady from Wimley, Reproached for not acting quite primly,    Said, "Heavens above!    I know sex isn't love, But it's such an entrancing facsimile."    There once was a lady from Exeter, So pretty that men craned their necks at her.    One was even so brave    As to take out and wave The distinguishing mark of his sex at her.    There was a young lady from Maine Who claimed she had men on her brain.    But you knew from the view,    As her abdomen grew, It was not on her brain that he'd lain.    There was a young girl from Hong Kong Whose cervical cap was a gong.    She said with a yell,    As a shot rang her bell, "I'll give you a ding for a dong!"    There was a young man from Hong Kong, Who had a trifurcated prong.    A small one for sucking,    A large one for fucking, And a *honey* for beating a gong.    There was a young lady of Norway Who hung by her toes in a doorway.    She said to her beau,    "Just look at me Joe, I think I've discovered one more way."    There once was a plumber named Lee Who was plumbing a girl by the sea.    Said she, "Please stop plumbing,    I think someone's coming!" Said he, "Yes I know, love, it's me."    There was a young girl from Devizes Who had breasts of different sizes.    One was so small,    Really nothing at all, The other was huge, it won prizes.    There once was a policeman of Munchen Whose penis one day ceased to function.    For the rest of his life,    He deceived his good wife By the intelligent use of his truncheon.  (Maybe North Americans would not know that a truncheon is the stick carried by British policemen)    I once met a lassie named Ruth In a long distance telephone booth.    Now I know the perfection    Of an ideal connection, Even if somewhat uncouth.    There was a young man of St. John's Who wanted to bugger the swans.    But the loyal hall porter    Said, "Pray take my daughter! Those birds are reserved for the dons."    A worried young man from Stamboul Founds lots of red spots on his tool.    Said the doctor, a cynic,    "Get out of my clinic; Just wipe off the lipstick, you fool!"    There was a young lady named Twiss Who said she thought fucking a bliss.    For it tickled her bum,    And caused her to come Siht ekil gniyl ylbatrofmoc elihW    There was a bluestocking in Florence Wrote anti-sex pamphlets in torrents,    Till a Spanish grandee    Got her off with his knee, And she burned all her works with abhorrence.

      There once was a man named Matt Who was short, bald, ugly, and fat.    I'm willing to bet,    The only pussy he gets Is when he goes home to his cat.    There once was a lad named Kevin Whose girlfriend was four foot eleven.    She looked at his cock    When it was hard as a rock, And it was ten inches long...minus seven.    There once was a woman named Ann Who was said to be quite like a man.    When nature did call,    She ran down the hall, And went to the gentleman's can.    There once was a baker named Sherm Who flavored his pastries with sperm.    He said, "What's the matter?"    As he mixed up his batter, "I still use a spoon to stir'm."    There was a young gal from Montana Who had an affair with a banana.    She hugged it and squeezed it,    Loved it and teased it, and said "It tastes better than a mana."    There was a young girl from France Who got on a train, by chance.    The engineer fucked her,    As did the conductor, And the brakeman came in his pants.    There was a young lady from France Who got on a bus in a trance    Everyone fucked her    Apart from the Conductor But he came twice in his pants    There once was a barmaid named Gail On whose chest were the prices of ale.    And on her behind,    For the sake of the blind, Was precisely the same, but in Braille.    Once a young woman named Alice Used a dynamite stick for a phallus.    They found her vagina    In North Carolina, And part of her anus in Dallas.    There was an old man of the Nile Who sharpened his nails with a file;    Till he cut off his thumbs,    And said calmly, "This comes Of sharpening one's nails with a file!"    There was an old person of Cromer Who stood on one leg to read Homer.    When he found he grew stiff,    He jumped off the cliff, Which concluded that person of Cromer.    There was an old man on some rocks Who shut his wife up in a box.    When she said, "Let me out,"    He exclaimed, "Without doubt, You will pass all your life in that box."    There was a young lady of Troy Whom several large flies did annoy.    Some she killed with a thump,    Some she drowned at the pump, And some she took with her to Troy.    A certain young gourmet of Crediton Took some pate de foie gras and spread it on    A chocolate biscuit.    Then murmured, "I'll risk it." His tomb bears the date that he said it on.    There was an old party of Lyme Who married three wives at one time.    When asked, "Why the third?"    He replied, "One's absurd, And bigamy, sir, is a crime!"    There was a young boy of Quebec Who fell into the ice to his neck.    When asked, "Are you friz?"    He replied, "Yes, I is. But we don't call this cold in Quebec."    Beware of the limerick bore. From a seemingly infinite store,    He trots out more verse    Where the scansion gets worse, But the subject's the same as before.    There once was a man from Nantucket Whose dick was so long he could suck it.    He said with a grin,    As he wiped of his chin, "If my ear was a cunt, I'd fuck it."    There once was a man from Tasse Who's balls were made of brass.    In stormy weather,    They smacked together And a lightning bolt shot out his ass.    There was a young man from Madrass Who had both his balls dipped in brass.    He banged them together    And played "Stormy Weather" And lightning came out of his ass.    In the Garden of Eden sat Adam Massaging the bust of his madam.    He chuckled with mirth,    For he knew that on earth, There were only two boobs and he had 'em.    There was an old pirate named Bates Who was learning to rhumba on skates.    He fell on his cutlass    Which rendered him nutless And practically useless on dates.    There was a young man from Bellaire Who was screwing his girl on the stair.    But the banister broke,    So he doubled his stroke, And finished her off in mid-air.    A pretty young lady named Vogel Once sat herself down on a molehill.    A curious mole    Nosed into her hole. Ms. Vogel's okay, but the mole's ill.    A team playing baseball in Dallas Called the umpire blind out of malice.    While this worthy had fits,    The team made eight hits, And a girl in the bleachers named Alice.

      Thursday- It was like fucking National Davida Day. I have never seen so many people so fucking psyched about someone's birthday before. It's kind of sad, but, eh. It basically just showed me how fucked up popularity can be. I shouldn't be talking... I contributed to her popularity by making cookies. Well, we're I guess you can call it good friends, outside school, so it was appropriate to make a crappy recipie off the back of the M+M's bag.    copied straight out of morrisons dead journal... i dont get it! i thought we were good friends... oh well.......

      Chorus I'm a pirate! That I be! I sail me ship upon the sea! I stay up late - till half past three! And that's a peg below me knee!  Yo Ho, my friends I have a tale of treasure, plunder, sea and sail my story's bigger than a whale it gets so deep, ye'll have to bail.  Chorus I'm a pirate! That I be! I sail me ship upon the sea! I stay up late - till half past three! And that's a peg below me knee!  I like to fish, I like to fight I like to stay up half the night When I say "starboard" ye go right! Me ma, she says, "Ye look a fright!"  Chorus I'm a pirate! That I be! I sail me ship upon the sea! I stay up late - till half past three! And that's a peg below me knee!  I've got no hand but that's me hook! I pillage stuff but I'm no crook. Me booty's in this chest I took. They'll write about me in a book!  Chorus I'm a pirate! That I be! I sail me ship upon the sea! I stay up late - till half past three! And that's a peg below me knee!  And that's all there is to this song. I hope it hasn't been too long. A pirate's life might just be wrong So grow up nice and big and strong!  Chorus I'm a pirate! That I be! I sail me ship upon the sea! I stay up late - till half past three! And that's a peg below me knee!    i love pirates!!!!

      why is it that no one was able to get all the movie quotes? you guys suck!!! especially the people who graduated so they do nothing all day but rent movies from blockbuster!!!   1. go white girl! 2. the man irons his jeans mom!  3. i should tell you, ive given serious thought, to eating your wife 4. you suck... just like my girlfriend! 5. evils afoot...wowzers 6. Warning! *ssholes are closer than they appear! 7. Allow myself to introduce... myself. 8. You like strong women. I've done my homework. Or do I need skin-tight vinyl and a whip? 9. No, I will not make out with you! we got chlorophyll guy up there talking about god knows what and all this girl wants to do is make out with me. I am here to learn everybody, not to make out with you. Proceed with the chlorophyll 10. People say crazy sh*t during sex. One time, I called this girl "Mom" 11. -He's licking the glass and making obscene gestures with his hands.  12. Man, I smell like Phys. Ed! 13. Check out the name tag, your in my world now grandma 14. Why don't skeletons play music in church? Because they got no organs 15. She won't be coming down here with the spray. She'll be coming down here with a shovel. It happened to m' brother. Split him right down the middle. Now I have two half-brothers. 16. Ring around the rosie, a pocket full of spears. 17. If the good Lord had intended us to walk he wouldn't have invented roller-skates. 18. I want you. I need you. Oh, baby. Oh, baby 19. I'd rather be his whore than your wife! 20. Do you prefer fashion victim or ensemble challenged?

      I really like Pirate Jokes, actually, I kinda wished I was a Pirate. Don't you think they are so cool, with a hook for a hand, a parot for a pet, and an awesome red stripped shirt, use cool shaped swards, live on a ship, and spend their life in search for burried treasure? If you don't like these Jokes, you must WALK THE PLANK, Arrrrrrrr...   Where do Pirates hang out on the Weekend? At the Barrrrrrrrrr  How does a Pirate get to work? He drives his Carrrrrrrrrrrrr  What do rich Pirates eat? Caviarrrrrrrrrr  What do Pirates wish upon at night? A Starrrrrrrrrrrr

      You know ye are a pirate when...  ...you prefer cheap rum instead of expensive wine.  ...you think that the proper way to greet kings at events is: Arrh, ye peacock, give me yer money or I´ll burn yer tent!  ...you get thrown out of meetings cause you know too much about "slithering throats, ARRH!".  ...you're planning to purchase a large cannon with the explanation: "who knows, maybe some day we go to Pennsic".  ...you are not very interested in SCA rapier fencing cause "they've banned fleche and suicidefencing" and you dont really understand that crap bout "chivalry" either.  ...people stand WAAY back when your household starts to pull out rapiers, sabres, cutlasses and daggers.  ...the people at work starts to talk about you as the guy who puts jolly rogers on everything.  ...your topic for the evening is smuggling, and your fellow sca-dians listens politely until you mention "fast motor boats" and starts complaining about how the price on silk has gone down.  ...you get really angry when the person next to you at the bancuette, who claims to be a pirate, doesnt know anything about "loading guns with rusty nails" and you challenge him to a cutlassduel, he turns up and then runs away cause you brought your real cutlass.

      One day a Pirate and a bartender were talking to each other in a bar. The Bartender asked the pirate "Where did ya get that peg leg from?"  The Pirate responded " We were sailing the seas when a big ol' shark came up to me while I was swimmin' and bit off me leg."  Later the Bartender asked "Where did you get that hook then?"  The pirate responded "Well, me crew and I were in a battle and it got cut through the bone."  The bartender then asked " Then where did ya get the eye patch from?"  The pirate said " In a harbor I looked at a gull flying over head and it took a dump right in me eye."  The bartender was puzzled and asked the pirate, "How would that make you get an eye patch?"  The pirate responded, "First day with the hook."

      Advanced pirate lingo; or On beyond “Aarrr!”  Once you've mastered the basics, you're ready to start expanding your pirate vocabulary. Try these for starters  Beauty – The best possible pirate address for a woman. Always preceded by “me,” as in, “C’mere, me beauty,” or even, “me buxom beauty,” to one particularly well endowed. You’ll be surprised how effective this is.  Bilge rat – The bilge is the lowest level of the ship. It’s loaded with ballast and slimy, reeking water. A bilge rat, then, is a rat that lives in the worst place on the ship. On TLAP Day – A lot of guy humor involves insulting your buddies to prove your friendship. It’s important that everyone understand you are smarter, more powerful and much luckier with the wenches than they are. Since bilge rat is a pretty dirty thing to call someone, by all means use it on your friends.  Bung hole – Victuals on a ship were stored in wooden casks. The stopper in the barrel is called the bung, and the hole is called the bung hole. That’s all. It sounds a lot worse, doesn’t it? On TLAP Day – When dinner is served you’ll make quite an impression when you say, “Well, me hearties, let’s see what crawled out of the bung hole.” That statement will be instantly followed by the sound of people putting down their utensils and pushing themselves away from the table. Great! More for you!  Grog – An alcoholic drink, usually rum diluted with water, but in this context you could use it to refer to any alcoholic beverage other than beer, and we aren’t prepared to be picky about that, either. Call your beer grog if you want. We won’t stop you! Water aboard ship was stored for long periods in slimy wooden barrels, so you can see why rum was added to each sailor’s water ration – to kill the rancid taste. On TLAP Day – Drink up, me hearties! And call whatever you’re drinking grog if you want to. If some prissy pedant purses his lips and protests the word grog can only be used if drinking rum and water, not the Singapore Sling you’re holding, keelhaul him!  Hornpipe – Both a single-reeded musical instrument sailors often had aboard ship, and a spirited dance that sailors do. On TLAP Day – We are not big fans of the capering, it’s not our favorite art form, if you will, so we don’t have a lot to say on the subject, other than to observe that the common term for being filled with lust is “horny,” and hornpipe then has some comical possibilities. “Is that a hornpipe in your pocket, or are you just glad to see me? Or both?”  Lubber – (or land lubber) This is the seaman’s version of land lover, mangled by typical pirate disregard for elocution. A lubber is someone who does not go to sea, who stays on the land. On TLAP Day – More likely than not, you are a lubber 364 days of the year. But not if you’re talking like a pirate! Then the word lubber becomes one of the more fierce weapons in your arsenal of piratical lingo. In a room where everyone is talking like pirates, lubber is ALWAYS an insult.  Smartly – Do something quickly. On TLAP Day – “Smartly, me lass,” you might say when sending the bar maid off for another round. She will be so impressed she might well spit in your beer.

      The basics  Pirate lingo is rich and complicated, sort of like a good stew. There are several other sites that offer glossaries that are pretty good, and you can find some of them on our links page.  But if you just want a quick fix, a surface gloss, a "pirate patina," if you will, here are the five basic words that you cannot live without. Master them, and you can face Talk Like a Pirate Day with a smile on your face and a parrot on your shoulder, if that's your thing.  Ahoy! - "Hello!"  Avast! - Stop and give attention. It can be used in a sense of surprise, "Whoa! Get a load of that!" which today makes it more of a "Check it out" or "No way!" or "Get off!"  Aye! - "Why yes, I agree most heartily with everything you just said or did."  Aye aye! - "I'll get right on that sir, as soon as my break is over."  Arrr! - This one is often confused with arrrgh, which is of course the sound you make when you sit on a belaying pin. "Arrr!" can mean, variously, "yes," "I agree," "I'm happy," "I'm enjoying this beer," "My team is going to win it all," "I saw that television show, it sucked!" and "That was a clever remark you or I just made." And those are just a few of the myriad possibilities of Arrr!

      Why is this day different from all others?  Why do we need an International Talk Like a Pirate Day?  Make no mistake. We do. But it's a little hard to articulate why, especially when you've made the mistake of referring to your wife as a scurvy bilge rat and tried to order her back into the galley.  Talking like a pirate is fun. It's really that simple.  It gives your conversation a swagger, an elán, denied to landlocked lubbers. The best explanation came from a guy at a Cleveland radio station who interviewed us on the 2002 Talk Like a Pirate Day. He told us we were going to be buried by people asking for interviews because it was a "whimsical alternative" to all the serious things that were making the news so depressing.  In other words, silliness is the holiday's best selling point.  Before we go any further, there's something we need to be clear about. Pirates were and are bad people. Really reprehensible. Even the most casual exploration of the history of pirates (and believe us, casual is an accurate description of our research) leaves you hip deep in blood and barbarity. We recognize this, all right? We aren't for one minute suggesting that real, honest-to-God pirates were in any way, shape or form worth emulating.  So what is it exactly that we're celebrating here, if not pirates? What, you're wondering, is the point?  We're going to be painfully honest here, perhaps fatally so.  The point is, there is no point.  And that's what's fun about Talk Like a Pirate Day specifically, and talking like a pirate in general.  We're talking about the mere image of swaggering pirateness. And while this is a guys' guide, the comely wench will have fun talking like a pirate, too. It's powerful, yet harmless. Perhaps, dare we suggest it, the ultimate aphrodisiac. Try it!  When Sept. 19 rolls around and suddenly tens of thousands of people are saying "arrr" and "Weigh anchor or I'll give you a taste of the cap'n's daughter," it staggers us. They are talking like pirates -- not because two yahoos from the Northwestern United States told them to, but simply because it's fun.

I can't come to the phone now because I have amnesia and I feel stupid talking to people I don't remember. I can't come to the phone now, so if, well, actually, I CAN come to the phone now, I mean, like, I'm at the phone NOW, recording this message, but I'm doing this NOW, while you're listening to it LATER, except for you I guess it's NOW, like, when you're listening to it... I mean, like, wait, gosh. This is so confusing.  I can't come to the phone now, so... Hey—that's a nice phone you have there. Hey sugar, you call this number often? I bet you have answering machines bothering you all the time... Yes indeedy. Why don't you give me a call sometime and we can listen to some old recordings... I might even play my beep for you.

I don't want to bore you with metaphysics, but how do you know this is an answering machine? Maybe it's a dream, or maybe it's an illusion, or maybe YOU don't really exist. One way to find out is to leave a message, and if it's reality, I will call you back.  I know you're out there. I know that you're afraid. You're afraid of us. You're afraid of change. I don’t know the future. I didn't come here to tell you how this is going to end, I came here to tell you how it’s going to begin. I'm going to hang up this phone, and then I'm going to show these people what you don’t want them to see. I'm going to show them a world, without you. A world without rules and controls. Without borders or boundaries. A world where anything is possible. Where we go from there, is a choice I leave to you  I’m sorry, I’ve been trying to break the record for "the most calls missed" if its a emergency or your dieing or something, please hold on till the record is broken. And I will call you back. If this were the best of all possible worlds, I could come to the phone right now, but I can't, so if you could leave your name and number...  If you are a burglar, then we're probably at home cleaning our weapons right now and can't come to the phone. Otherwise, we probably aren't at home and it's safe to leave us a message. If you are hearing this tape, then I'm not here now.

So please leave a message after the tone. I didn't take a shower today, and I might not take one tomorrow. So if you don't leave a message after the tone, you might have to deal with me in person.  I'm only here in spirit at the moment, but if you'll leave your name and number, I will get back to you as soon as I'm here in person.  I'm sorry but my answering machine is out of order. I am leaving a broken CD player in its place. It can't take messages either. In fact, it can't even play you a nice tune while you wait to not leave a message. I'm sorry; my answering machine is out of order. May I take a message?  I'm unable to take your call in person because I'm having an out-of-the-body experience. In fact I'm standing right behind you and I can hear everything you say. But leave me a message anyway to help me reconnect when I get back.  I'm writing the definitive work on pain. I would like you to tell me how this machine makes you feel. Remember, be honest. This is for posterity.  In Japan, the hand can be used like a knife. (Heeeeee-YAH! Sound of smashing box of kleenex.) But this method doesn't work with a telephone call... (Dial tone.) Introducing the all-new Ginsu answering machine! It cuts, it chops, it slices, it dices your incoming calls! How much would you pay?

      1.Hey there numero uno! Do you live by your convictions? Do you take pride in your principles? Then you probably spend less time looking out for number one than you do choosing your battles with a mature, rational head.  Enneagram Type Ones, known as Reformers, are just what you'd think. They want to improve the world and they're willing to work hard to do it. Idealistic but levelheaded, reformers are inspired to serve some higher purpose. As a Reformer, you probably stay committed to whatever cause you adopt as your own and expect other people to have as much integrity as you do. Like other Type Ones, you are likely to feel best when you stay true to yourself and keep your tendency towards perfectionism in check.   2.Are you a true, true, generous Two? If so, you don't just want to be loved; you deserve to be loved. And you probably are, considering your caring nature.  Known as Helpers, Enneagram Type Twos are people-pleasers--they love to make sure everyone around them feels good. In fact, all the attention they lavish on others can take its toll. Twos spend so much time accommodating others, that they may find it difficult to communicate their own needs. As a Two, you may feel like a martyr who sacrifices your desires for the sake of others. Like other Twos, you are probably at your best when you feel there is a balance of give and take between you and your loved ones.   3.Three's a charmer! Are you naturally successful? Do you put your best face forward no matter what? If so, you may have some Enneagram Type Three in you.  Type Threes, also known as Achievers, don't just dress to impress--they live for it. Plus, they make it look easy. They have an innate need and uncanny ability to stand out in the crowd. And they thrive on this attention. As a Three, your ambition and sunny disposition are likely to inspire a lot of people. But some may think your positive attitude is phoney. Like other Achievers, you are at your best when you are self-assured without being overly competitive.   4. Are you perpetually searching for the meaning of life? Do you have a poetic spirit, oh sensitive soul?  Enneagram Type Fours are known for being emotionally sensitive, even moody. Their philosopher's soul makes them the most expressive of the Enneagram types. Many (not all) artists are Type Fours. If you are like other Individualists, you may spend a lot of your time wondering what to do with yourself, but that's probably your favorite activity--thinking about things. And then of course, moaning and groaning... ;-)  5.ello brainiac? Is that you, more comfortable in the world of ideas than at a party?  Investigators, or Type Fives, are the intense intellectuals of the Enneagram wheel. Curiosity may have killed the cat, but that doesn't keep Type Fives from exploring any idea they can get their heads around. Investigator types are innovative thinkers--they love to find new ways of doing things. And they often do--many a historical figure or national hero turns out to be a Type Five. As an Investigator, you may enjoy time spent reading and studying. Some Fives feel a little isolated from other people, but for the most part they are extremely perceptive, focused individuals  6.Forget about your dog...do you deserve to be called Fido (remember, that's Latin for "faithful")?  Enneagram Type Sixes, or Loyalists, are the lovable, responsible ones on the Enneagram wheel. Although Loyalists like to maintain the status quo, they are diplomats at heart and are willing to make compromises (and encourage others to do so) in order to solve problems. Loyalists are big into teamwork, so you may find that you are happiest when you're with your family or group of friends, helping to keep things harmonious.  7. ME!!!!!!!!! Hello, are you there? It's us, gURL... We wonder: Are you all over the place? Enneagram Type Sevens are.  Known as Enthusiasts, Type Sevens are fun-loving, adventurous spirits who may seem like they have enough energy for two. Outgoing and optimistic, Sevens are usually the life of the party.  The down side of all their explosive energy is that Sevens sometimes feel scattered and their loved ones may sense that distraction. As a Seven, you may be happiest when you have the freedom to roam but find something, or someone to help you focus.  8.It's just a guess, but do you usually get your own way? Face it, it's not a bad thing to get what you want...  Challengers get their name from their authoritative nature. Known for their self-confidence and natural leadership skills, Challengers are strong-willed individuals who take the world by storm. They welcome direct confrontation and many people find their honesty like a breath of fresh air. But if they aren't careful, these confrontations can develop into arguments. If you are like other Challengers, you may act a bit bossy when you feel out of control. Most of the time, though, you are probably just self-confident and ambitious--a great source of admiration for your peers.- this one could also be me...oh well  9. "Peace at any price." Could that be your motto? Would you rather forget about your own desires than get into an argument?  Enneagram Type Nines, known as Peacemakers, are generally easy-going people who don't like to rock the boat. They usually get along with everyone and at their best are emotionally even-keeled. You may not know it, but as a Peacemaker, you could be someone's rock in a storm. Lucky for all of us, serenity like yours has a tendency to rub off on other people.

      6.Your social life is: 	non-existent, but who cares? 	floundering--you friends find it hard to live up to your standards. 	exhausting because lots of people come to you when they need to talk. 	perfect, it couldn't be better! 	great, as long as everyone's getting along... 	pretty dismal--hell is other people. 	rocky by nature--you fight with your friends A LOT.  7.Everyone's got an Achilles heel. What's yours? 	OK, sometimes I'm a drama queen. 	I panic if things feel out of control. 	I can be bossy. 	Secretly, I think I'm always right. 	Sometimes I try a little too hard to impress other people. 	I give and I give and I give...and then I grow resentful. 	I live inside my head. 	I tend to be scattered--it's hard for anyone to pin me down. 	I avoid dealing with problems.  8.You're recruited for the drama club, so you choose to join the crew as: 	playwright. 	director. 	publicity coordinator--you get people to come to the play. 	lighting designer--you want to teach yourself the technical aspects of the theater and avoid the mayhem backstage. 	stage manager--you keep things moving and facilitate communication among the crew. 	makeup/wardrobe person--you get the stars ready for their close-ups. 	actor--you wanna be a star. 	quality controller--you make sure the sets meet safety requirements (e.g., fire resistant, made of recycled wood, etc.)  9.You get a puppy for your b-day! You name her: 	"Om," so you can meditate when you call her name. 	"Synchronicity" or some other obscure, lyrical word. 	after your favorite civil right's hero. 	five times before you find a name that sticks. 	"Fido" (that's Latin for "faithful"--she's gotta be loyal then, right?) 	after you get input from the rest of your family. 	"Leo," to enCOURAGE her independence... 	"Plato," after the ancient Greek philosopher. 	"Sunny"--just like your disposition. : -)  10.Publisher's Clearinghouse comes by with a check the size of your kitchen table. What's your first big purchase? 	a fancy sports car and a map of the country--you're headed for the open road! 	a beautiful new house for your family 	an entirely new and exclusively designer wardrobe 	a room (or an island) of your own--where you can think 	a whole new library of books and a place where you can study them 	You wouldn't buy anything until you gave away some money to a few charities. 	a Krispy Kreme (or some other fast-growing) franchise. 	Nothing. Money can't buy happiness.

      1.You and your best friend have a crush on the same person and if she knew, it could cause some tension between you. You: 	sit down with your friend and talk things out. 	hang out like usual, and pretend there's nothing wrong. 	mope around trying to figure out what to do. 	get into a fight with her about it in the hallway at         school. 	let her have the crush--friends are forever. 	figure out how you can both be happy--there must be a way... 	flirt up a storm--may the best girl win! 	lose interest in that crush before it becomes an issue.  2.In your family, you play the role of: 	the guilty conscience --you and Lisa Simpson are psychic twins. 	the diplomat--you make sure everyone keeps talking to each other. 	the good girl--pure and simple. 	the caretaker--sometimes it feels like you're the only adult in the house. 	the bully--you rule the roost. 	the joker--you keep them in stitches. 	the sensitive one--you spend a lot of time weeping over your diary. 	the know-it-all. 	the pacifist--you avoid conflict at all costs.  3.Which of these websites are you most likely to book mark? 	your friend's blog or website--you're helping her redesign it 	a yoga site 	Google search engine 	PETA 	MarthaStewart.com 	poetry.com 	"The Onion" 	"The Wall Street Journal" 	Oprah.com  4.Where do you see yourself ten years from now? 	married with children--you want to be a stay at home mom. 	the youngest executive at a big company 	still trying to figure out what you want to do 	content with your life, whatever it is you're doing... 	working for a cause 	owning your own business--who wants to work for other people? 	traveling the world 	employed as a social worker 	still in school, getting a graduate degree  5.You'd rather spend a Saturday afternoon: 	online, working on your fledgling advice column. 	watching an old foreign film. 	volunteering at a local social services organization. 	going to a Tori Amos concert. 	watching the Discovery Channel. 	working. 	babysitting some neighborhood kids as a favor to your parent(s). 	shopping at the mall. 	hanging out with your grandma and/or grandpa.

      THINGS YOU CAN DO WITH ANOTHER PERSON      * Have a water drinking contest           (Amusement Potential: 5-10 minutes) While the competition is fun, you probably won't feel too good afterward. To give your event an old western theme, slam the cups upside down on the tables after you have emptied them.      * Stare at the back of someone's head until they turn around           (Amusement Potential: 2-5 minutes) This works on the "I have the feeling I'm being watched" principle. Conduct an experiment-does this really work?      * Have a "Who is less competitive" competition           (Amusement Potential: 1-3 minutes) Trying to win at this will make you lose. Trying to lose makes you win which makes you lose. Not trying at all makes you lose which makes you win which makes you lose.      * Pick up a dog so it can see things from your point of view           (Amusement Potential: 3-5 minutes) Think about it: your dog has only seen the house from a viewpoint from 6" to 2' high (15 to 60 cm for all you metric fans). It's never seen the tops of counters, what you keep on your desk, the tops of shelves, etc. Try looking at things from its point of view, too.      * Pull out a hair, stick in someone's ear           (Amusement Potential: 1-5 minutes) Best done to sleeping people. Added challenge in having no one else around, because then you can't blame it on anyone else. Try to beat your record number of times before the person catches on.      * Pour water in hand, make sneeze noise, throw water on back of person's neck           (Amusement Potential: 5-15 minutes) Always a good gag. For an even bigger reaction out of the person, act like you're not sorry at all for what they think you did. Comment instead on how big that sneeze was or about how there was a lot of mucus in that one.    mel this isnt dirty!!!!!!

      THINGS YOU CAN DO WITH VERY LITTLE      * See what's in your neighbor's trash           (Amusement Potential: 20-30 minutes) You can learn a lot about people by what they throw out. You might uncover some dark secret about them. Plus, they might be throwing out something with value that still works, like a VCR.      * Watch TV, repeat everything said in Italian accent           (Amusement Potential: 5-10 minutes) Sort of entertaining. Fun to pretend the people on the screen are actually talking that way.      * Call up people who write editorials you disagree with           (Amusement Potential: 15-60 minutes) I'm surprised no one has thought of this before. Unleash your fury on the person who had the nerve to write a letter like that! I'm pretty sure it doesn't qualify as a prank phone call, too.      * Make prank phone calls           (Amusement Potential: 20-60 minutes) Very entertaining, but requires discipline. Remember - vulgarities don't make a call funny, but getting the other person to believe a ridiculous story will. Even more fun if you get a bunch of people on the line using a Wonderphone and take turns making the calls. One to get you started off: Call McDonalds, try to make reservations.      * Pretend all humans will die except for people in room with you           (Amusement Potential: 10-20 minutes) What would you do if this really happened? Would the group stay together, or would there be factions? Who would join what group? Remember, there would only be power for a few days before the plants ran out of fuel or broke. To travel, you would always have to be near cars to siphon gas out of. Best to do with people you know.      * Step off a curb with eyes shut, imagine it's a cliff           (Amusement Potential: 2-5 minutes) To get any benefit out of this one, you have to have a good imagination. Don't step off immediately, build up to the jump. Study the ravine below. Feel the winds at that altitude. Step off and...AHHHHHH!!!!!      * Burn things with a magnifying glass           (Amusement Potential: 5-30 minutes) Ants are always fun to use for this, but burning the face of someone you don't like, under some circumstances, can be just as entertaining.

      THINGS YOU CAN DO WITH ABSOLUTELY NOTHING      * Push your eyes for interesting light show           (Amusement Potential: 1-5 minutes) See a variety of blobs, stars and flashes. Try to make out things-is your subconscience trying to send you a message? Can you control what you see by pressing different areas with different forces? Would it be possible to somehow see the same effects on TV?      * See how long you can hold your breath           (Amusement Potential: 4-20 minutes) Not that much fun, but it sure passes the time. Play with a friend, or try to beat your own personal best. Some tips: hyperventilate before hand, and stay as still as possible. My personal best is 2:00 (exactly).      * Try to not think about polar bears           (Amusement Potential: 1-5 minutes) This is especially hard, because by trying too much, you remember what you were trying to avoid thinking of. If you try too little, you end up thinking about polar bears anyway.      * Scratch yourself           (Amusement Potential: 1-3 minutes) Go ahead, scratch yourself now. Even if nothing itches, go ahead. Doesn't that feel pretty good?      * Hurt yourself           (Amusement Potential: 1-3 minutes) What is pain? Why is it unpleasant? There's nothing physical about it - it's all in your mind. Plus, after pinching yourself for awhile, boredom will seem nice next to being in pain.      * Try to swallow your tongue           (Amusement Potential: 1-3 minutes) There's not much to say about this one. It is possible.      * Look at something for awhile, shut eyes, study after image           (Amusement Potential: 2-5 minutes) Another great time waster. It takes about 30 seconds of staring to create an after image, and the image is then viewable for about the same length of time. Fun to combine this one with pushing on your eyes.      * Get yourself as nauseated as possible           (Amusement Potential: 5-10 minutes) Best achieved by looking straight up and spinning around. Try to be so dizzy you can't even stand up. This is also entertaining due to the "makes boredom seem a lot better" effect (see "Hurt Yourself").

      sad i write in here everyday but...... i was davening kabbalas shabbos on friday and i was up in my room because i couldnt go to shul cause my abba wasnt going and jen didnt pick up her phone so i couldnt go cause i cant walk home in the dark and my family was being so loud i couldnt concentrate downstairs so i was upstairs davening and for some reason just started crying... not like the bawling cant see or think crying just the light crying that makes it kinda hard to speak well... and after i calmed down and finished i realized i was crying because im missing something wow sound like im on crack but i have no idea what that something is just that i need to find it so if you think you are that something.... call me   and to the person i thought was my best friend... fuck you seriously i trusted you like no one else and you screwed me over. i can never trust you again

      I made a new game that I call "What are the chances?" It's a really fun game to play in crowded areas such as the softball game I was at last night. The rules are simple. First you check some sources to find some random statistic such as rape or murder or something... Then, while with friends, you casually ask, "Hey, what are the chances that dude wants to rape me?" Then they take some guesses which are, for the most part, ridiculous. After a while of humoring them, you need to exclaim "Wrong! This experiment further proves my hypothesis that you suck at life. The chance that that man will rape me is 1 in 12... For example, for those of you that don't understand probability, if I lined up 12 men, the statistics say that 1 of them should want to rape me." This game is great. I haven't tried it yet though... I will soon

      Ok, funny story, there's this kid named Billy that is always at the games and always follows us around... Well, he's really annoying and we all hate him so the last two games everyones basically been telling him to fuck off cause we hate him... Last time he grabbed Jessie's ass and tried to lick her face. Sooo... at the game on Wednesday our jokes and shit got even worse... Flat Face started throwing this stick and telling him to go get it. Well, naturally after he threw it one of the times we ran, well Jessie and Sommer did at least. Flat Face and I just sort of walked away... He eventually caught up with us in the woods where I slipped on some sticks and said, "This game is fucking dangerous. Whoever the fuck invented this sport needs to go to hell." That being said, it is worth mention that Billy was swinging on vines and talking about beating off coyotes again. Well, we were getting pretty pissed off so when he came back Flat Face said, "Billy, I'm gonna give you two dollars to go away and never come back again." Billy accepted the offer and left. Well, that's the end of that chapter, or so I thought. Jessie said she felt bad... I said something to the effect of, umm, this kid grabbed your ass and tried to lick your face last week and you feel bad that we paid him to fuck off? Well, that went unanswered. BTW, I hope that deal had a lifetime warranty. It should work though, cause Flat Face told him that if he ever bothered us again he would punch him in the face and take the money back... LMAO... that's a riot... Flat Mr. Peace Face punching someone in the face... Well, that's the end of this story.

      Ok, so last night I went to Amber's softball game, which I saw none of. Apparently they won though... I think they actually won by the ten run rule after having been beat by it in all of the previous games. I rolled up in my minivan listening to softcore hits. As I pulled into the parking lot I noticed Sommer and Jessie walking over toward the jungle gym with some strange miniature being. Apparently they call those things kids... Well, I thought it would be funny if I drove by them and exclaimed, "I'm Rick James, bitches," as I smakced them in the faces. On second thought, it would have been downright hilarious... As they might say in the hood, "That's off the chain, yo." I also figured that it would be very inappropriate and a bad thing to do in general... After pondering the choices, I decided to just park the van and let my mother slide into the drivin chair so she could get outta that place. I then walked over to the jungle, cautiously, as to slip past the ninjas undetected. I walked over there and said "Hey, Kidz." Please note that I did pronounce kids with a "z" and not an "s". We watched the child that they were supporting run around and go ape shit on that jungle gym for a while. Then flat face arrived... The first thing he said to me was, "Hey, do you have any weed?" I said, with a grin on my face, "No, I don't participate in your illegal activities" So we sat there and made funnies at the expense of others for a while... Flat face and I were on a roll... We had insults left and right. After a few minutes, Sommer noticed that some kids were picking on another kid at the jungle gym so she told us. "Ok, go for it mom," I replied. She then went over and said, "Stop picking on him, you're gonna make him cry." "Yeah, that'll show them." Then I jokingly said, "Why don't you tell the kid that's getting picked on to rape the other kids?" Then she actually yelled, "Rape him, Rape him." This sent the kids into a frenzy yelling rape and hitting each other. Sommer and Jessie walked up to the softball field embarrassed. Flat Face and I eventually suppressed our laughter and followed them.

      OK, call your girlfriend on the Telephone and talk for about five minutes before you tell her you've got a call waiting. Tell her you'll be right back then put her on hold... Then, wait about ten miuntes and put her back on the line while wildly screaming some random woman's name. Like this, "Oh, yesss, (insert name here)" Then when she asks what's goin on, simply say, Umm... "I'm sorry hun, I didn't realize my time was up. You were saying something about the time billy called you.... blah blah blah.... it doesn't matter what you say after the "my time was up" part, but you do have to somehow tell her w/o straight up telling her that it was phone sex that her time was up for.

      Man, Amber's party at the Ramada inn last night was good fun. Too much happened for me to remember all of it, but I will fill you in on some key moments. I think one of the funnier moments occured at about 3 am. Amber was goin a little crazy with the ice and stuck an ice cube down my pants. Naturally, I kept it there for about twenty seconds because understandably, it gets really hot in my pants so an ice cube once in a while feels good. After about twenty seconds, I declared, "My hands are in my pants," and grabbed the ice cube. I then walked over to amber and rubbed it in her face and she took it and stuck it in Matt, her boyfriends mouth. Good fun... Good fun.

      Ok, so I went into town last night to practice parallel parking with my mom. My first try sucked... as did the next three, but by the fifth time I tried it I did a decent job. About the seventh or eighth time I was pulling into a spot when I noticed a lady in her forties walking by on the sidewalk with a smile on her face. This wasn't the customary, "Brad, you're so hot, take your pants off now" type smile. It was more like, "He He, giggle like school children, this kid's learning how to parallel park, I better run to my spot so he doesn't hit my car" type smile. Or it could have been the, "Hey, I remember sixty-five years ago when I was learning how to parallel park. If you think this is hard, try doing it with a horse and buggy." Anyway, I thought this was worth mention.

       Ok, So I'm a Fucktard Ok, so I went to Wendy's earlier today and my brothers and I were waiting in line. I found it extremely unnecessary for us all to wait in line so I said, "Excuse me, I must worsh my hands." As I walked away, I over heard Matt say, "Did he just say worsh?" I ignored the blatantly ignorant words that were pouring out of his mouth. Honestly, what was he thinking. Of course I said worsh. Remember, I lived in Tennessee until a year ago? Well, that's not the point. The bathroom was one of those public restrooms that's only meant for one person and you're supposed to lock the door while you're using it. Well, a few seconds after I walked in I noticed an old man on the crapper and I exclaimed, "Oh shit, sorry about that," I spoke only to occupy my mouth, and he said, "Oh, it's no problem, carry on..." I was thinking, well, it would be rude if I didn't stay now because I already saw the man on the can trying to push a log out his ass and he did tell me to stay. As I said before, I only went to the bathroom to wash my hands so I turned on the faucet, which projected the water at an unnecessaryily high velocity. I got my hands wet and squeezed some soap on them when I realized I really had to take a piss. So, I rinsed the soap off and dryed my hands so I wouldn't get my private areas all wet, and I went over to the urinal, and relieved my bladder. I then had to wash my hands again, all the while this older male is still pushing that log through. I dryed my hands and left saying as I walked out the door and jokingly said, "Hey man, good luck w/ that shit."

       Adventures of Rob and John  "After the princesses were taken by Robin Hood and Little John, the sheriff gathered a million man army to attack Sherwood Forest. Just the Two of them verse the million soldiers. Fortunately, Robin Hood got a hold of a double barrel flamethrower and Little John found a tank. But even with these great weapons, the two were drastically out numbered. The forest was misty and the ground wet with dew. Sunshine began to peak itself through the trees on this early morning. Rob figured that since he had another hour and a half until they reach their camp, it would be the perfect time to make his move on princess number 6. But alas, he and Little John heard the enemy approaching. 65 of the million men that were scattered through out the woods were closing in. After a quick glance at each other and stating their motto, "Both for one and one for both!” Little John hopped into his tank as Robin Hood hid the princesses behind a fallen tree. Before long, the sheriff's men began streaming through the woods. Robin Hood faced the challenge with determination as he torched all the men that charged towards him. Screams were shot out across the woods while Little John crushed men under his tank. More men came, increasing the enemy’s number. Robin's Fuel ran out and he began to sword fight. Little John's tank was over taken and he was captured. Men piled on top of Robin Hood, but before they tied him up, he pulled out his cell phone and called Fryer Tuck. Unfortunately, he got his answering machine and left the message, "HELP!" Little John and Robin Hood fought with Honor and Bravery. As they were being taken to the sheriff, Robin saw the princesses peaking over the fallen tree and wondered what would happen to them - all of them - the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th...especially the 3rd and 6th. Their eyes glistened with tears as they watched their rescuers being taken away by the cruel enemy. But wait! What was this? Could it be? Yes, Robin saw Fryer Tuck sneak up to the princesses and point them towards the path of their camp. After seeing him, 10 of the sheriff's men charged towards him. But Fryer Tuck was so fat that no man could bind him alone. He picked up the first man and threw him at a tree, the next three he simply bounced off his stomach. Than, staring directly at Robin Hood and Little John, he bellowed with a loud voice, "Fear not Bob and John for I and the Merry Men will be quick on your heels! Stay alive.... we will find you!" With that being said, Fryer Tuck disappeared into the woods before he too was captured. The men were led off. Brave men. Men of courage, strength, skill, love, and princesses. They knew what would become of them if no help came. Two hundred men led off Robin Hood and Little John, when all of a sudden Will Scarlet dropped out of a nearby tree. With lightning speed, cut their ropes and handed them each a sword. He himself turned and killed thirty, men before his sword broke over a man’s helmet. Meanwhile, Little John and Robin Hood had slain seventy men together and ran for the forest. The remaining hundred formed a pack around Will and he was taken captive. There was nothing that Little John or Robin Hood could do. The hanging of Will Scarlet was set to take place in two days. Little John and Robin Hood retreated to their den to make plans for one of the boldest rescues in history. “Come now, we must rally together! In order for this rescue and fight for freedom to work we must work together!” Yelled Little John as he tried to hush the merry men down. Everyone was angry when they heard all that had happened and wanted revenge desperately. Fryer Tuck came up with a plan but in order for it to work, everyone must work together. But this plan was daring and bold for it will be a full assault attack the next morning when the army officials held their annual games. There will be sword fights, horse races, and much more. Morning came all too quickly and the merry men were nervous. Robin hood, noticing everyone’s worries, stood and made a stunning speech. “Today we are going into battle against a tough and determined enemy…I can’t promise you that I will bring you all home alive…But this I do promise…that when we go into battle…I will be the first to step foot on the field – and I will be the last to step off…and I will leave no one behind!…dead or alive…we will all come home together!” With tears in his eyes, Little John lifted his sword high into the air and yelled, “One for all and all for one – Merry men, let us fight with honor – let us fight with bravery – let us kick tail!” With that, they all shouted, “Hur-ah!” and went marching into battle… Bombs soared overhead and swords slashed as the games continued. Cotton candy and popcorn smells made its way to the merry men’s noses as they hid in the brush waiting for the perfect moment to attack. All of a sudden, a dark cloud flew overhead and it became as night. Due to this misfortune, all the women and children went home, leaving only the men. This was good, for now, no one would accidentally kill a youngster or innocent lady. After all of the women and little children had left, the merry men screamed their battle cry and charged towards the battlefield. Cold steal met cold steal…oh yeah, and human flesh. Men fell dead. Violence was everywhere, then *err…I think I’ll skip that part* anyway, the merry men fought together as they watched each other’s backs. Robin Hood dogged a sword that was thrown at him and thrusted his sword- *censored* Little John saved Robin’s life on more then a few occasions, and Robin Hood had been there for Little John time and time again. Every man fought for not only their lives, but for the lives of their friends. Never had a group of men banded together for each other in all of history. Little John was there fighting with his huge 150 lb., 3 ft sword and defending his back was Robin Hood with his huge javelin and short sword. Sweat was pouring down Little John's face as he fought and his hands were almost white from gripping his sword so tightly. The blood stained his sword, hands, garments, and the ground around him. Wiping the sweat from his brow with the arm of his left hand, he stole a quick glance at Robin. Robin was thrusting forward with his spear and defending himself with his sword. He too had a mingle of sweat and blood on his robes and his head, but Little John noted that there were no wounds on him save for the cut on his left shoulder. The blood had stopped rushing from the wound and it appeared to be from a large battle-ax. Little John was cut all over his hands and had had a spear graze his leg, leaving that cut pretty deeply. But they preserved. Against incredible odds they won the victory, only to find that the sheriff had escaped with a small band of men and Will Scarlet. Disappointed, but not dishearted the merry men, all of them, returned alive, but wounded and tired to their camp. They had to locate and plan a rescue for Will Scarlet. Robin Hood sent out several small parties to locate him and they found him..." "...But they found him in a dreadful place...a place that the bravest of men would not dare even think of being. The sheriff tied Will to a tree in the middle of Rockwic Woods. As harmless as the name may sound, Rockwic Woods was where allot of the sheriff's men lived. Will was badly beaten; to the point that the men who found him at first thought him to be dead. The sheriff surrounded him with thickets and thorns so much that one could hardly see through unless he look through a little opening that apparently the sheriff had made. After receiving the news, the Merry Men thought that a rescue would be imposable. Surely it must be a trap. Why else would the sheriff leave Will Scarlet alone? Some lost hope while others wanted to attempt a rescue. Robin Hood and Little John sat around the fire sucking on lollypops (because smoking is bad for you) as they discussed what to do. They knew that they owed Will Scarlet their lives, and that they must rescue him, but they couldn't put the Merry Men in danger. So, they snuck out of camp and made their way to Will. After two hours of cutting through the thickets, they finally got to him and quickly untied his ropes. He was unconscious and they needed to get him back to camp before it was too late. But before they did, they needed to make sure that they wouldn't be followed. Robin looked around intently and his face turned pale. Before Little John could ask what was wrong, Robin shouted, "You can all come out now!" 50 of the sheriff's men got out of their hiding places and with their bows drawn, walked cautiously towards the three. "I see you have out witted us," started Robin Hood, "or have you? Am I and John that stupid?" With that, Little John threw out a couple of smoke bombs and they disappeared through a clearing. Four days had passed and Will Scarlet was recovering speedily. Everything seemed to be going well until a merry man scout went running through the camp yelling for Robin Hood and Little John. He found them and in a frightened tone told them he had important news. All the men gathered around as the scout was talking, "I just heard," he said then took a breath and continued, "that the sheriff has offered an award for the heads of Robin Hood and Little John to be served to him on a silver platter.” A panic arose. "We must get out of here," cried one of the merry men, "the forest will be crawling with people looking for us!" “But no matter what happens Robin Hood and Little John, we are with you. We will fight together, cry together, laugh together, and if need be, die together!" said another. They all joined in agreement..." "...At that instant another of the band came running up and out of breath proclaimed, 'the sheriff... has... offered.... a challenge... to Robin... and Little... John. He want them... to gather their.... forces and meet him for an all out war for the...ownership of Sherwood Forest.' Little John smiled smugly and looked at Robin Hood. 'So what do you think, Rob? Think we can take them?' Robin Hood smiled, 'Duuuuhhhhhh, yuuuuppppp' with that the whole band broke out in laughter and passed around another round of root beers. The meeting was set for one week. The battle would be tense everyone knew, but all were ready and willing. The princesses, well, were princess. And the merry men brought out their stockpile of ammo. Little John flipped on the TV to find out that there were going to be thunderstorms the day of the meeting and at that moment one of the band rode up. 'The sheriff wants to reschedule for the Thursday because of the thunderstorms predicted,' said the man. 'Wuss,' said Little John and rolled his eyes. “It’s ok Little John,” said Robin Hood, “It will give us more time to get ready. Here’s another root beer, and I think I have a…” he reached into his pocket, “Yes, here it is, another lollypop too.” The next few days were very busy for the merry men band. They practiced their archery as they shot arrows at soda cans, practiced their sword and stick fighting as they challenged each other, and watched “How to win fights” videos, but at last, they were ready. Bright and early Thursday morning, the Merry Men set off to win a victory, but when they got there, no one was there save the sheriff standing high on his platform. He was a fat man and not very tall. “Ahoy Robin Hood, Little John, and the rest of the band!” Shouted the sheriff. What trickery is this?” yelled Little John. “Where is your army?” “Why, right behind you silly!” the sheriff shouted back. “But it’s not just my army, I’ve allied with another army…now you are outnumbered 1 to 10! Ha Ha Ha!” What seemed to be over a thousand men came out of the woods and charged the Merry Men. “Sheriff, you fiend!” Screamed Robin Hood. “No, I’m cleaver – Meuhahaha!” Cried the sheriff and he left the battlefield. The two sides met with brutality. Robin’s pulse raged as a man leaped towards him with a huge dagger in his right hand. Robin defended himself and fought back but the man was stronger then he and was gaining the advantage. Will Scarlet saw Robin’s distress and stabbed the man in the back. Before Robin could thank Will, a man slashed Will in the side. Robin quickly threw his knife at the man’s forehead. It seemed like slow motion as Will fell to the ground. Robin desired to help him, but as he staggered to his feet, a man came running towards him with a gigantic sword. A knife was lying at Robin’s feet and he quickly kicked it up to his hands and slashed against the sword with such force causing the man to lose his grip. Robin’s anger took over and he lunged at him, ripping him to *la la la…we’ll just ignore this part * “Robin!” cried Little John as he was fighting two men, “Our men are discouraged.” “We must prevail!” replied Robin, “How are you doing Little John?” “Well…” said Little John before he did a back flip over the men he was fighting then killed them, “I’m doing ok Rob.” “Good, but we need to help Will, he has fallen over there.” Robin pointed to show Little John. “Where did you say he – DUCK!” cried Little John and as fast as lightning shot his arrow over Robin’s head at the enemy. “Thanks man.” Said Robin “No prob. Bro. – But where’s Will, he’s not there.” Unbeknown to Robin, Will was taken captive. “Give it up Robin, you and John are the only one’s left fighting, all the rest of your men are either dead or captured.” Said the sheriff as he stood on his platform. “Never!” Cried Little John. “If you don’t, you will die. Just surrender and we can negotiate!” The sheriff was getting irritated. “Aww – Fine!” Screamed Robin and threw his hands up. “We surrender.” Little John did the same. The Merry Men were all split up into different prisons for 2 days without food. After that period, the sheriff brought Robin Hood, Little John, and 8 other Merry Men to a coliseum where lots of onlookers were in the stands. “Hello.” Said the sheriff with one hundred and forty men behind him. “You ten ladies will fight my one hundred and forty men in front of all these Sherwood citizens. If you win, you all go free. If you loose, well…you all die…it’s so exciting!” squealed the sheriff. He then turned to the one hundred and forty and said, “Men, I want all their heads on a silver platter. Some of you may die, but that is a sacrifice I am willing to make. But I will pay one thousand dollars for each head.” The one hundred and forty men walked slowly towards the Merry Men with evil smiles spread across their faces…” "...Robin Hood fortunately noticed something that the rest of the merry men didn't. When the sheriff had left the room his huge belt had caught on the door handle, one of his grenades fell off of the belt. Seeing this, Robin Hood grabbed two spears and charged forward... "Aaaaaaaaaaaaaagggggggggggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhhh" he shouted. "What are you doing?" cried Little John, but by that time Robin had made it to the other side of the men. He stooped down and grabbed the grenade. *The next part has been edited out because of it graphic and violent nature. This was done to keep our rating down. Thanks for your cooperation.* The fifty men who remained were astonished. The odds went from 14:1 to 5:1. But of course, each merry man counts 10 of the sheriffs men, so they weren't worried. They easily fought their way out of it and escaped without losing a man. The problem was: rescuing the rest of the merry men and Will Scarlet, again. Upon making their arrival back at Sherwood Forest, the men thought up a plan... The following day the sheriff built a log house in the middle of his court and drenched it with gasoline. To be safe, he put 500 guards on duty. This could only mean one thing…the sheriff is going to try and burn the merry men alive. Ten minutes before the house was to be burned, Robin and another merry man with gelled hair, dressed in black drench coats and wearing black sunglasses, slowly walked through the gates. Robin Hood put a black bag on the belt that would take it through the meddle detector and he himself walked through as well. A red light began to beep and one of the guards approached Rob and calmly said, “Will you please remove any metallic you may be carrying: your keys, loose change-“ Robin opened his coat, showing knives and arrow guns all over him. The guard was shocked, “What in the-“ Robin punched in the gut *music starts * and pulled out two arrow guns, one from each side and fired at the other guards as they read their newspapers. One of the guards who survived called for backup and was about to shoot at Rob when the second merry man threw a knife at his chest without hesitation. After that, Robin picked up the bag and they started walking towards the center of the court. They both threw their guns away because they were low on ammo and reached for two more. More guards rushed to the scene and sought cover behind trees as they aimed their arrows at Robin Hood and his friend. “Freeze!” Yelled the chief of the guards but Robin looked at his friend and they both ran in opposite directions to two different trees. Meanwhile, Little John and the seven other merry men discussed themselves citizens and were scattered throughout the court. With his careful eye, Little John noticed that the sheriff was acting a little strange. Covering his head with his hood, Little John approached the sheriff, “Good evening sir.” He said in a disguised voice. “Being a citizen, you are obligated to refer to me as ‘your brilliance.’” Stated the sheriff with his head held high in a snobby attitude. “Do forgive me your brilliance,” Little John rolled his eyes, “But when are you going to burn that house?” When Robin and his nine other men go in to ‘rescue’ their friends. You see, no one is in there” the sheriff giggled, “It’s a trap…but don’t tell anyone.” The sheriff then rehearsed his line, “Oh no! Robin is going…going to…” He looked at his script, “to ruin my plans!” But Little John quickly gathered four disguised merry men and found a dungeon where half of the imprisoned gang was held. Without hesitation, Little John put a sticky bomb on the lock and blew it away. Just then, the sheriff went on speaker and for all of Sherwood to hear, pronounced, “Ohhhhhh Little John, we’ve captured your friends. I’m going to burn them and everyone is invited to watch. This is going to be better then bingo and karaoke!” After that was said, Little John and the merry men heard guards approaching them and with courage, Little John stated, “Men, prepare to defend yourselves.” Little John created a distraction while the other men ran away to safety. 100 of the sheriff's men surrounded Little John with their swords, spears, and guns. All Little John had was his staff. :-) *you can guess the outcome and movie this is from* Unfortunately, just al Little John defeated the 100 men, 1000 men came over the hill and captured him. Back at camp, Robin Hood stood up to talk to the men. "Little John has sacrificed himself for us all at one point or another. He has saved our lives countless times and I don't know where we would be without him. He is my best friend and companion. I have never had a better one." With that Will Scarlet piped up, "He rescued me from the sheriff three times and saved my life on the battle field five times at least." "He's saved my life 3 times too" said other. Soon all the men were speaking of how Little John had saved them or protected them or rescued them. Finally, Robin Hood quieted the men down and spoke. "Men, I think you all know what we have to do. I can't guarantee everyone's safety or return, but look what he has done for us. Gentlemen, Let's go get our boy back" With that the whole place exploded with cheers and shouts and the merry men were ready for battle. Supercharged with emotion, nothing could stop them. One of them could have taken on 100 of the sheriff’s men and they were ready to if they had to. The only thing holding them back was that they didn’t know where Little John was or what the sheriff was going to do to him. Robin Hood needed information so he sent princess number six, Maid Marion, to the sheriff in hopes that she could win his heart and in turn, receive his information. Success was achieved and Maid Marion told Robin everything that he desired to know. Little John was to be hung as a birthday present to Prince John, who took the throne after King Richard left on his crusades. But alas, the sheriff took wind of Maid Marion’s deceit and in fury, commanded that she too be hung with Little John… "A scream!!! A flash of lighning!!!! A crash of thunder!!!!" It is the "Annual Scary Movie Night" in Sherwood Forest. On the front row right in the middle sits Friar Tuck and Will Scarlet clinging to each other in sheer fright. To their left princesses 1, 2, and 4 have fainted, and 3 and 5 are also hugging each other with fear. To Will's right, sits Rob alone, knees up to his chin with his arm squeezing them tightly. His face is as white as snow and his fingernails are almost to the knuckles. The contest of the "ASMN" is to see who wets their pants first. Last year, Rob set a record of doing it a only 11:20. Right now it is quarter to 12. Rob, determined not to lose, has not had anything to drink in two days. He looks nervious and squimish. This year, the loser has to buy everyone a round of fresh root beer at the local A&W (with apologies to the A&W company, all who work there, and their grandmothers). The 164 Inch Plasma Screen TV blasted out incrdible picture with a 3.27 Bose (Sorry to Bose this time) Surround Sound. With the subs up to max, the hills were literally shaking from the sound. The next day was planned for the rescue, but the tradition could not be broken. Little John and Maid Marion would just have to wait. Time wore on... more and more movies were played... side bets were placed on the three in the front with a 10:9:1 odds on Friar Tuck:Will Scarlet:Rob. (poor Rob... NOT!!) Finally at 2:53 and 31 seconds Rob broke his previous record of holding out the longest and losing. (Will spare you the details)Eventually, around four o’clock in the morning, all the merry men fell asleep. Seven o’clock rolled around and Rob’s wristwatch alarm clock went off. Slowly, he stood up and looked at his calendar. With eyes only half open he read, “Save Little John and Maid Marion.” He then turned around and because he was only three-fourths awake, walked as if he were drunk. “Common Fellas” Rob yawned, “Time to get up.” Will screamed, “Get me out of this panic room!” You can only imagine what kinds of movies they watched the night before. Rob threw cold water on him to wake him up. Finally, all the men were up but certainly not in the mood to fight. “Let’s go save-“ Rob barffed, “Whoops too much popcorn…no wait, it looks like hot dogs? What? Oh well, let’s go save Johnny and that girl.” So off they marched, if you want to call it a march. Men were tripping over each other and others were throwing up. All of them were still in their pajamas and half of them stank like…uhh…ur- ur..ur probably not in the mood to know. An hour later, they got to prince John’s party and one of the men screamed, “Oh no, it’s the four foot tall, man eating spider! Run!” “No it’s not silly” reassured Rob, “That’s only in the movie. That right there is the sheriff.” Rob than looked at the sheriff and said, “Hey mr...mr…poopypants. Why don’t you just let them go before I uh, “He yawned, “Before I fall asleep.” The sheriff was shocked, “Umm…what are you doing?” Rob replied, “I’m going to beat you up loser. Now come over here right now and I’ll spank you, you, you naughty boy you.” Chuckles broke out all around, even the sheriff himself thought it to be quite amusing. Maid Marion’s mouth and eyes were wide open in horror and shock, while Little John hung his head not in shame but in disappointment. He was upset because he missed the annual scary movie night. The sheriff pulled out his sword and started towards Robin Hood. All of a sudden Rob’s eye’s grew large and he said, “Is that disco I hear?!” He turned and saw the disco room, “AAAAALRIGHT!” and just like a little kid, ran towards it. The merry men were certainly in trouble now and didn’t even realize it…

      Mary-Kate Olsen Enters a Rehab Facility  Teen actress Mary-Kate Olsen, who is alarmingly thin, has checked into a treatment facility for an undisclosed "health-related issue," her spokesman said in a statement issued to the media on Tuesday. Although he was not any more specific than this, PEOPLE Daily says that health-related issue is an eating disorder.  See a recent photo of Mary-Kate Olsen signing autographs before the premiere of "New York Minute."  Mary-Kate and her twin sister, Ashley, turned 18 on June 13, a birthday that boosted their bank accounts by some $150 million as they reached the age of majority. They enter New York University as freshman in the fall. Spokesman Michael Pagnotta would only say this: "Mary-Kate Olsen recently entered a treatment facility to seek professional help for a health-related issue. She is thankful for the encouragement and support of her friends and family who are with her every step of the way."  See a photo of Mary-Kate snuggling with her boyfriend, David Katzenberg, son of DreamWorks studio head Jeffrey Katzenberg.  Amid much speculation in recent months, the twins have adamantly denied there is a problem. In a PEOPLE magazine cover story published in May, Ashley defensively said, "Being in the public eye, you're labeled that you have an eating disorder. You have a drug addiction. We don't have problems! There's nothing to worry about." Then Mary-Kate added, "If I had a drug addiction, I would be in a thingy--like Promises, the Malibu (rehab) place. You don't see me there. So, like, come on. It's crazy."

      Chandler: All right, you will notice that I am fully dressed. I, in turn, have noticed that you are not. So in the words of A. A. Milne, "Get out of my chair, dillhole!"  Joey: Okay. (he gets up and takes the cushions with him, as he starts to leave)  Chandler: What are you doing?  Joey: You said I had to give you the chair, you didn't say anything about the cushions.  Chandler: The cushions are the essence of the chair!  Joey: That's right! I'm taking the essence.  Chandler: Oh-ho, it'll be back. Oh-ho, there's nobody in the room.  Joey: (entering) Where's my underwear?!  Ross: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Come on, come on, what. You took his underwear?  Chandler: He took my essence!  Ross: Okay, now hold on. Joey, why, why can't you just wear the underwear you're wearing now?  Joey: Because, I'm not wearing any underwear now.  Ross: Okay, then why do you have to wear underwear tonight?  Joey: It's a rented tux. Okay. I'm not gonna go commando in another man's fatigues.  Chandler: Well, then it looks like somebody is gonna have to give back somebody his cushions.  Joey: Okay, you hide my clothes. I'm gonna do the exact opposite to you.  Chandler: What are you, what are you gonna show me my clothes?  Joey: Hey, opposite, is opposite! (leaves)  Chandler: He's got nothing!  Joey: Okay, buddy-boy. Here it is. You hide my clothes, I'm wearing everything you own.  Chandler: Oh my God! That is so not the opposite of taking somebody's underwear!!  Joey: Look at me! I'm Chandler! Could I be wearing any more clothes? Maybe if I wasn't going commando...  Chandler: Oooo-ooh!  Joey: Yeah. Whew, it's hot with all of this stuff on. I ah, I better not do any, I don't know, lunges. (starts doing lunges)    ahh rikki....... best one ever

      Auto response from shev4ev: "Friends are like television. Some are like PBS and always asking for money. Others are like the news, with sad tales to tell everyday, some are like that one station with the foreign language; you don't understand a word of it but you listen and watch anyway. And then there are the ones like the commercials, always changing, ever-so-annoying and only seem to be there when you are bored. But every once in a while you meet someone who's like a really good movie of the week or that one tv show you hardly ever get to see anymore because you're so busy. My point is hold on to the friends you care about and since we don't have a remote control to mute someone or just change the channel, pick your friends carefully."

She'll make you take your...  Upside inside out...    ahhh..... how do songs like this get stuck in your head?

      Seems like yesterday we used to rock the show I laced the track, you locked the flow So far from hangin on the block for dough Notorious they got to know that Life ain't always what it seems to be Words can't express what you mean to me Even though you're gone, we still a team Through your family, I'll fulfill your dream In the future, can't wait to see If you'll open up the gates for me Reminisce some time, the night they took my friend Try to black it out, but it plays again When it's real, feelings hard to conceal Can't imagine all the pain I feel I'd give anything to hear half your breath I know you're living you life -- after death   Every step I take, Every move I make Every single day, every time I pray -- I'll be missing you Thinking of the day, when you went away What a life to take, what a bond to break -- I'll be missing you  It's kinda hard with you not around Know you in heaven smiling down Watching us while we pray for you Every day we pray for you Til the day we meet again In my heart is where I'll keep you friend Memories give me the strength I need to proceed The strength I need to believe My thoughts B.I.G. I just can't define Wish i can turn back the hands of time Us in the 6th, shopping for new clothes and kicks You and me taking flicks, making hits Stages they received you on I still can't believe you're gone I'd give anything to hear half your breath I know your living you life -- after death   no one knows who this is for...

       50 Ways to Fail an Exam 1. Bring a pillow. Fall asleep (or pretend to) until the last 15 minutes. Wake up, say, "oh geez, better get cracking," and do some gibberish work. Turn it in a few minutes early. 2. Get a copy of the exam, run out screaming" Andre, Andre, I've got the secret documents!!" 3. If it is a math/science exam, answer in essay form. If it is long answer/essay form, answer with numbers and symbols. Be creative. Use the integral symbol. 4. Make paper airplanes out of the exam. Aim them at the instructor's left nostril. 5. Talk the entire way through the exam. Read questions aloud, debate your answers with yourself out loud. If asked to stop, yell out, "I'm SOOO sure you can hear me thinking." Then start talking about what a jerk the instructor is. 6. Bring cheerleaders. 7. Walk in, get the exam, sit down. About five minutes into it, loudly say to the instructor, "I don't understand ANY of this. I've been to every lecture all semester long! What's the deal? And who the hell are you? Where's the regular guy?" 8. Bring a Game Boy (or Game Gear, etc...). Play with the volume at max level. 9. On the answer sheet (book, whatever) find a new, interesting way to refuse to answer every question. For example: I refuse to answer this question on the grounds that it conflicts with my religious beliefs. Be creative. 10. Bring pets. 11. Run into the exam room looking about frantically. Breathe a sigh of relief. Go to the instructor, say, "They've found me, I have to leave the country," and run off. 12. Fifteen minutes into the exam, stand up, rip up all the papers into very small pieces, throw them into the air and yell out "Merry Christmas." If you're really daring, ask for another copy of the exam. Say you lost the first one. Repeat this process every fifteen minutes. 13. Do the exam with crayons, paint, or fluorescent markers. 14. Come into the exam wearing slippers, a bathrobe, a towel on your head, and nothing else. 15. Come down with a BAD case of Turet's Syndrome during the exam. Be as vulgar as possible. 16. Do the entire exam in another language. If you don't know one, make one up! For math/science exams, try using Roman numerals. 17. Bring things to throw at the instructor when s/he's not looking. Blame it on the person nearest to you. 18. As soon as the instructor hands you the exam, eat it. 19. Walk into the exam with an entourage. Claim you are going to be taping your next video during the exam. Try to get the instructor to let them stay, be persuasive. Tell the instructor to expect a percentage of the profits if they are allowed to stay. 20. Every five minutes, stand up, collect all your things, move to another seat, continue with the exam. 21. Turn in the exam approximately 30 minutes into it. As you walk out, start commenting on how easy it was. 22. Do the entire exam as if it was multiple choice and true/false. If it is a multiple choice exam, spell out interesting things (DCCAB.BABE.etc..). 23. Bring a black marker. Return the exam with all questions and answers completely blacked out. 24. Get the exam. Twenty minutes into it, throw your papers down violently, scream out, "Fuck this!" and walk out triumphantly. 25. Arrange a protest before the exam starts (i.e. Threaten the instructor that whether or not everyone's done, they are all leaving after one hour to go drink) 26. Show up completely drunk. (Completely drunk means at some point during the exam, you should start crying for mommy) 27. Every now and then, clap twice rapidly. If the instructor asks why, tell him/her in a very derogatory tone, "the light bulb that goes on above my head when I get an idea is hooked up to a clapper. DUH!" 28. Comment on how sexy the instructor is looking that day. 29. Come to the exam wearing a black cloak. After about 30 minutes, put on a white mask and start yelling, "I'm here, the phantom of the opera," until they drag you away. 30. Go to an exam for a class you have no clue about, where you know the class is very small, and the instructor would recognize you if you belonged. Claim that you have been to every lecture. Fight for your right to take the exam. 31. Upon receiving the exam, look it over. While laughing loudly, say, "you don't really expect me to waste my time on this drivel? Days of our Lives is on!!!" 32. Bring a water pistol with you. Nuff said. 33. From the moment the exam begins, hum the theme to Jeopardy. Ignore the instructor's requests for you to stop. When they finally get you to leave one way or another, begin whistling the theme to the Bridge on the River Kwai. 34. Start a brawl in the middle of the exam. 35. If the exam is math/science related, make up the longest proofs you could possibly think of. Get pi and imaginary numbers into most equations. If it is a written exam, relate everything to your own life story. 36. Come in wearing a full knight's outfit, complete with sword and shield. 37. Bring a friend to give you a back massage the entire way through the exam. Insist this person is needed, because you have bad circulation. 38. Bring cheat sheets FOR ANOTHER CLASS (make sure this is obvious...like history notes for a calculus exam... otherwise you're not just failing, you're getting kicked out too) and staple them to the exam, with the comment "Please use the attached notes for references as you see fit." 39. When you walk in, complain about the heat. Strip. 40. After you get the exam, call the instructor over, point to any question, ask for the answer. Try to work it out of him/her. 41. One word: Wrestlemania. 42. Bring balloons, blow them up, start throwing them around like they do before concerts start. 43. Try to get people in the room to do the wave. 44. Play frisbee with a friend at the other side of the room. 45. Bring some large, cumbersome, ugly idol. Put it right next to you. Pray to it often. Consider a small sacrifice. 46. Get deliveries of candy, flowers, balloons, telegrams, etc... sent to you every few minutes throughout the exam. 47. During the exam, take apart everything around you. Desks, chairs, anything you can reach. 48. Complete the exam with everything you write being backwards at a 90 degree angle. 49. Bring a musical instrument with you, play various tunes. If you are asked to stop, say, "it helps me think." Bring a copy of the Student Handbook with you, challenging the instructor to find the section on musical instruments during finals. Don't forget to use the phrase, "Told you so." 50. Answer the exam with the "Top Ten Reasons Why Professor xxxx Sucks."

The procession crosses the bridge and the man puts on his cap, picks up his rod and reel, and continues fishing.  The other guy says, "That was touching. I didn't know you had it in you."  The first guy responds, "Well, I guess it was the thing to do - after all, I was married to her for 40 years."  RITZbtz17: i don't get it    Auto response from RITZbtz17: lesson of the day: when discussing coin toss probabiltiy with 14 year olds, dont discuss the chances of getting head  RITZbtz17: but tails is ok?

      Oceans apart day after day And I slowly go insane I hear your voice on the line But it doesn't stop the pain  If I see you next to never How can we say forever  Wherever you go Whatever you do I will be right here waiting for you Whatever it takes Or how my heart breaks I will be right here waiting for you  I took for granted, all the times That I thought would last somehow I hear the laughter, I taste the tears But I can't get near you now  Oh, can't you see it baby You've got me goin' crazy  Wherever you go Whatever you do I will be right here waiting for you Whatever it takes Or how my heart breaks I will be right here waiting for you  I wonder how we can survive This romance But in the end if I'm with you I'll take the chance  Wherever you go Whatever you do I will be right here waiting for you Whatever it takes Or how my heart breaks I will be right here waiting for you Waiting for you      you know who you are ....

       I Went To A Party, Mom I went to a party, And remembered what you said. You told me not to drink, Mom So I had a sprite instead. I felt proud of myself, The way you said I would, That I didn't drink and drive Though some friends said I should. I made a healthy choice, And your advice to me was right, The party finally ended, And the kids drove out of sight. I got into my car, Sure to get home in one piece, I never knew what was coming, Mom Something I expected least. Now I'm lying on the pavement, And I hear the policeman say, The kid that caused this wreck was drunk, Mom, his voice seems far away. My own blood's all around me, As I try hard not to cry. I can hear the paramedic say, This girl is going to die. I'm sure the guy had no idea, While he was flying high, Because he chose to drink and drive, Now I would have to die. So why do people do it, Mom Knowing that it ruins lives? And now the pain is cutting me, Like a hundred stabbing knives. Tell sister not to be afraid, Mom Tell daddy to be brave, And when I go to heaven, Put Daddy's Girl on my grave. Someone should have taught him, That its wrong to drink and drive. Maybe if his parents had, I'd still be alive. My breath is getting shorter, Mom I'm getting really scared. These are my final moments, And I'm so unprepared. I wish that you could hold me Mom, As I lie here and die. I wish that I could say I love you, Mom So I love you and good-bye.  stolen from jen.... lol now whos stealing from who even before i read this i almost started to cry cause i read it years ago and cried for like a half hour.... not cool

      tip: don't try these if you're not willing to risk being beaten up)  1. Poke the person next to you repeatedly with your fork. If they try to retaliate, curl into a ball and start crying for your mother.  2. This only works if the person has their back to you. Select a single strand of hair from the person's head and pull gently. When they reach up to touch their hair or try to turn around, look at the ceiling or pretend to read the menu. Repeat constantly.  3. Tap your fingernails on the table top, ignoring any evil stares that come your way. (This works anywhere, not just restaurants.)  4. Hug yourself and rock backwards and forwards in your seat whilst muttering incoherantly. This will not only completely embarrass those at your table, it is also extremely annoying.  5. Help yourself to other people's meals. If they complain, pretend to stick your fingers down your throat and ask them if they'd like their food back.

       1. Grimace painfully while smacking your forehead and muttering: "Shut up, dammit, all of you just shut UP!"  2. Whistle the first seven notes of "It's a Small World" incessantly.  3. Crack open your briefcase or purse, and while peering inside ask: "Got enough air in there?"  4. Offer name tags to everyone getting on the elevator. Wear yours upside-down.  5. Stand silent and motionless in the corner, facing the wall, without getting off.  6. When arriving at your floor, grunt and strain to yank the doors open, then act embarrassed when they open by themselves.  7. Greet everyone getting on the elevator with a warm handshake and ask them to call you Admiral.  8. On the highest floor, hold the door open and demand that it stay open until you hear the penny you dropped down the shaft go "plink" at the bottom.  9. Stare, grinning, at another passenger for a while, and then announce: "I've got new socks on!"  10. When at least 8 people have boarded, moan from the back: "Oh, no, not now, damn motion sickness!"  11. Meow occasionally.  12. Holler "Chutes away!" whenever the elevator descends.  13. Walk on with a cooler that says "human head" on the side.  14. Stare at another passenger for a while, then announce "You're one of THEM!" and move to the far corner of the elevator.  15. Wear a puppet on your hand and talk to other passengers "through" it.  16. When the elevator is silent, look around and ask "is that your beeper?"  17. Say "Ding!" at each floor.  18. Say "I wonder what all these do" and push the red buttons.  19. Listen to the elevator walls with a stethoscope.  20. Draw a little square on the floor with chalk and announce to the other passengers that this is your "personal space."  21. Announce in a demonic voice: "I must find a more suitable host body."  22. Make explosion noises when anyone presses a button.  23. Wear "X-Ray Specs" and leer suggestively at other passengers.  24. Stop at every floor, run off the elevator, then run back on.

        	 	    There was a 40 year old man called Ian, and he had a girlfriend, Edna, who was 80 years old. They only saw each other on Saturdays. He would go to Edna''s house every Saturday, without fail. They would sit down next to each other and Edna would hold Ian''s penis, then Ian would go home after so long.  One week Ian never turned up, but Edna thought nothing of it. Three more weeks went by, and again Ian never turned up. By this time Edna was very concerned about him. She phoned him up and asked, "Where have you been the last four Saturdays?"  Ian replied, "I have been round at Margret''s house."  Shocked Edna shouted, "MARGRET? She is 98 years old, what the hell has she got that I haven''t?" Ian answered, "Parkinson''s desease!"

      Eddie went shopping for a new motorcycle. He finally found one for a great price, but it was missing a seal, so whenever it rains, he would have to smear Vaseline over the spot where the seal should''ve been.  His girlfriend was having him over for dinner to meet her parents. He rode his new bike to her house, where she was outside waiting for him. "No matter what happens at dinner tonight, don''t say a word." She told him, "Our family had a fight awhile ago about doing dishes. We haven''t done any since, but the first person to speak at dinner has to do them."  Steve sat down for dinner and it was just how she described it. Dishes were piled up to the ceiling in the kitchen, and nobody was saying a word. So Steve decided to have a little fun. He grabbed his girlfriend, threw her on the table, and had sex with her in front of her parents. His girlfriend was a little flustered, her dad is obviously livid, and her mom horrified when he sat back down, but no one said a word.  A few minutes later he grabbed her mom, threw her on the table, and did a repeat performance. Now his girlfriend was furious, her dad was boiling, and her mother was a little happier. But still there was complete silence at the table.  All of a sudden there was a loud clap of thunder, and it started to rain. Steve remembered his motorcycle. He jumped up and grabbed his jar of Vaseline. When he witnesses this, his girlfriend''s father backed away from the table and screamed, "Okay, enough already, I''ll do the goddam dishes!"

      An old man goes to see the doctor and gets some tests. When the results come in, the doctor calls the old man in and says, “You'd better sit down. It's pretty bad.”  The old man, naturally, gets all nervous and asks, “What is it doc? Don't hold back -- just give it to me straight.”  “Well,” says the doctor, “you have cancer and you have Alzheimers.”  The man replies, “Wow. Well, at least I don't have cancer.”

Coolgal805: really so gershon can technically1 Jumper991:  	 Last Updated: Thursday, 15 May, 2003, 12:50 GMT 13:50 UK Email this to a friend 	Printable version The new rules of sex  What you get up to in the bedroom, or elsewhere, has never been entirely your business. Soon, a raft of new sex laws will be enacted. So what will be allowed and outlawed?  By the yardstick of the English poet Philip Larkin, the sexual revolution is marking its 40th birthday this year. "Sexual intercourse," Larkin once famously declared in one of his verses, "began in 1963 (Which was rather late for me)".  The broadminded, however, would argue that any genuine breakthrough in sexual attitudes never got off the starting blocks.  Many of Britain's sex laws are a throwback to another era. Even the wording can read like something out of a Dickens novel. For example, the man in the dirty old raincoat who bares all to a passer-by, might expect to be charged with "exposing the person".  The term features in the Vagrancy Act 1824 and the Town Police Clauses Act 1847 - both of which are relied on to prosecute flashers, along with the common law offence of "outraging public decency".  "The law on sex offences is largely recognised as archaic, incoherent and discriminatory," said Home Secretary David Blunkett recently.  That's about to change. With the new Sexual Offences Bill, the government has come up with a brand new set of sex rules that are destined to overturn many of the old laws. So what will and won't be allowed in 21st Century Britain?  HOMOSEXUAL GROUP SEX  SEXUAL OFFENCES BILL The bill proposes tougher laws on rape and child sex abuse It also repeals offences such as buggery and gross indecency And tightens up on non-consensual sex of all kinds  There's nothing to stop heterosexual orgies, but take women out of the equation and you've currently got yourself a law suit. The issue was highlighted three years ago when the European Court overturned a conviction in the so-called ADT case - named after the initials of the three men involved. The case became a cause celebre for many gays after police in Yorkshire prosecuted a man after they were handed a sex video filmed at his home of the accused and two male friends. The new law takes a "gender neutral" approach to sex, granting equal rights to homosexuals and heterosexuals.  INDECENT EXPOSURE  The tendency has sometimes been to dismiss flashers as "dirty old men"; sad and harmless. But the new law comes down hard on the raincoat brigade, threatening a prison term of up to two years. Research has shown a link between flashing and more serious sexual crime. However, it shouldn't stop naturists doing what comes naturally. MPs have responded to naturists' concerns that by going naked they might fall foul of the new law, by amending the bill. Streakers are also protected, and should continue to be treated as a social nuisance rather than sexual offenders. Under the new bill, the (relatively few) women who indecently expose themselves will be punished as harshly as the men.  VOYEURISM  Indecent exposure it ain't  The days of the old "peeping Tom" are gone. Voyeurism today is about miniature video cameras and posting films on the net. And like indecent exposure, there is evidence to link the practise of secretly watching someone with more serious offences (one study found 14% of child molesters and 20% of rapists had "committed voyeurism"). In the past, there has been a tendency to regard the practice as a nuisance rather than a crime. The proposed new law threatens a two-year sentence for anyone who views a film knowing the subject had not given consent.  BESTIALITY  The proposals represent a softening attitude to so-called "zoophiles", who risk a life sentence under the terms of the current law. It ties into the bill's general theme of "consent" - that fundamentally all sexual activity should be mutually agreed. But again, research has shown a link between abuse of animals and abuse of children. Nevertheless, the proposal has drawn criticism from libertarians, such as Francis Bennion, a barrister and author of The Sex Code, a moral guide to sex. He argues that since the act is recognised to be "profoundly disturbed behaviour" zoophiles should be sent not to prison, but the psychiatrist's couch.  NECROPHILIA  Many people will be alarmed that sex with dead people is not currently a crime. But that's about to change even though critics argue cases of necrophilia are rare and this is simply an opportunity for the government to reinforce its high moral authority. Nevertheless, offenders can expect anything up to two years in prison.  Coolgal805: hhah so gershon is going to jail...but hopefully u wont die soon!

      stolen from dani...... really funny   DynamiteDG: A man is lying in a hospital bed with an oxygen mask over his mouth. A young nurse enters his room to sponge his face and hands. "Nurse," he mumbles from behind the mask, "Are my testicles black?" Embarrassed, the young nurse replies, "I don't know Mr. Jones, I'm only here to wash your face and hands." He struggles again to ask, "Nurse, are my testicles black?" Again the nurse replies, "I can't tell. I'm only here to wash your face and hands." The head nurse walks by and sees the man getting a little distraught, so she marches over to find out what's wrong. "Nurse," he mumbles, "are my testicles black?" The head nurse whips back the sheets, pulls down the man's pajamas, moves his penis out of the way, has a good look, pulls up the pajamas and says, "There's nothing wrong with them." Frustrated at this, the man pulls off his oxygen mask and asks again, "I said, are my test results back?!" rikki713: lol! DynamiteDG: A guy was walking down the street when he sees a woman with perfect breasts. He says to her, "Hey, miss, would you let me bite your breasts for $100?" "Are you nuts?" she replies and walks away.  He turns around, runs around the block and gets to the corner before she does. "Would you let me bite your breasts for $1,000?" he asks again. "Listen, sir, I'm not that kind of woman. Got it?"  So the guy runs around the next block and faces her again. "Would you let me bite your breasts... just once for $10,000?" So the woman thinks about this for a while and says, "Hmmmmm, $10,000?" She thinks a bit "OK, but just once, and not here. Let's go to that dark alley over there."  So they go to the alley and she takes off... her blouse to reveal the most perfect breasts in the world. As soon as the guy sees them, he jumps on them and starts caressing them, fondling them, kissing them, burying his face in them... but not biting them. Finally, the woman gets all annoyed and says, "Are you gonna bite them or what?" "Nah," he replies. "Costs too much!"  rikki713: lol DynamiteDG: Becky was on her death bed with her husband, John, maintaining a steady vigil by her side. As he held her fragile hand, his warm tears ran silently down his face, splashed onto her face, and roused her from her slumber. She looked up and her pale lips began to move slightly. "My darling John," she whispered.  "Hush, my love," he said. "Go back to sleep. Shhh. Don't talk."  But she was insistent. "John," she said in her tired voice. "I have to talk. I have something I must confess to you."  "There's nothing to confess," replied the weeping John. "It's all right.  Everything's all right, go to sleep now."  "No, no. I must die in peace, John. I slept with your brother, your best friend and your father."  John mustered a pained smile and stroked her hand. "Hush now Becky, don't torment yourself. I know all about it." he said, "Why do you think I poisoned you?"   rikki713: hahaha DynamiteDG: On a transatlantic flight, a plane passes through a severe storm. The turbulence is awful, and things go from bad to worse when one wing is struck by lightning. One woman in particular loses it.  Screaming, she stands up in front of the plane. "I'm too young to die!" she wails. "Well, if I'm going to die, I want my last minutes on Earth to be memorable! I've had plenty of sex in my life, but no one has ever made me really feel like a woman! Well I've had it! Is there ANYONE on this plane who can make me feel like a WOMAN??"  For a moment, there is silence. Everyone has forgotten their own peril, and they all stare, riveted, at the desperate woman in the front of the plane.  Then, a man stands up in the rear of the plane. "I can make you feel like a woman," he says. He's gorgeous. Tall, built, with long, flowing black hair and jet black eyes, he starts to walk slowly up the aisle, unbuttoning his shirt one button at a time. No one moves.  The woman is breathing heavily in anticipation as the stranger approaches. He removes his shirt. Muscles ripple across his chest as he reaches her, and extends the arm holding his shirt to the trembling woman, and whispers:  "Iron this."  rikki713: omg DynamiteDG: A police officer attempts to stop a car for speeding and the guy gradually increases his speed until he's topping 100 mph. He eventually realizes he can't escape and finally pulls over.  The cop approaches the car and says, "It's been a long day and my tour is almost over, so if you can give me a good excuse for your behavior, I'll let you go."  The guy thinks for a few seconds and then says, "My wife ran away with a cop about a week ago. I thought you might be that officer trying to give her back!"  rikki713: lol DynamiteDG: An older man goes to the Doctor in desire of a prescription for Viagra. The Doctor looks over the man, and says, "Viagra can be very dangerous and we do not just dispense it indiscriminately, Please bring your wife to my office next week and we'll discuss this in more detail. So the following week he shows up with his wife. The Doctor asks to see the wife by herself for a few moments and she follows him back to the examining room. The doctor asks her to disrobe and she does. He then asks her to turn around in 360 degrees a few times then instructs her to get up on the examining table and to turn in various positions. He then tells her she can get dressed and goes out to meet the Male Patient. "Sir," The Doctor Says, "There is nothing wrong with you, I couldn't get an erection either. rikki713: hahaha DynamiteDG: Jim and Edna were both patients in a mental hospital. One day while they were walking past the hospital swimming pool, Jim suddenly jumped into the deep end. He sank to the bottom of the pool and stayed there. Edna promptly jumped in to save him. She swam to the bottom and pulled Jim out. When the hospital director became aware of Edna's heroic act she immediately ordered that Edna be discharged from the hospital because she now considered Edna to be mentally stable. The director went to Edna and said, "I have some good news and some bad news. The good news is that you're being discharged because you responded so rationally to a crisis by jumping in the pool to save the life of another patient. Your action displays sound mindedness. The bad news is that Jim, the patient you saved, hung himself in the bathroom with his bathrobe belt right after you saved him. I am so sorry, but he's dead." Edna replied, "He didn't hang himself. I put him there to dry. How soon can I go home?" DynamiteDG: A husband, wife and son are barely making ends meet on their farm. One morning the woman sees the family's only cow lying dead in the field and hangs herself in desperation. When the man awakens, he sees his wife and cow dead and shoots himself. The son finds his parents dead and goes to drown himself, only to discover a mermaid at the river. The mermaid tells him, "If you have sex with me 10 times in a row, I will revive your parents and the cow." "Why not 20?" replies the son. "Fine," she says. "Twenty it is." "But wait," says the boy. "How do I know that 20 times in a row won't kill you like it did the cow?" DynamiteDG: Two new members of a hunting lodge get introduced to its oldest member. They ask him to tell his favorite hunting story, and he agrees.  “Well, back in 1944 in Africa,” the old man starts, “we went big-game hunting. Didn’t have much luck at first, but on the third day I was resting by a tree when I heard a noise. Next thing I know the biggest lion I’ve ever seen jumped out of the bushes at me like this…RO-A-A-R-R-R! Well, I just shit my pants.” The young men are amazed. One of them says, “I don’t blame you. I’d crap my pants too if a lion jumped at me like that!” The old man shakes his head and says, “No, no, not then—just now when I said roar!”  DynamiteDG: A bus carrying only ugly people crashes into an oncoming truck, and everyone inside dies. They then get to meet their maker, and because of the grief they have experienced; He decides to grant them one wish each, before they enter Paradise. They're all lined up, and God asks the first one what the wish is. "I want to be gorgeous," and so God snaps His fingers, and it is done. The second one in line hears this and says "I want to be gorgeous too."  Another snap of His fingers and the wish is granted. This goes on for a while but when God is halfway down the line, the last guy starts laughing. When there are only ten people left, this guy is rolling on the floor, laughing. Finally, God reaches this guy and asks him what he wants.  The guy calms down and says: " Make 'em all ugly again."

       This was written by a black guy in Texas..... When I born, I black, when I grow up, I black, when I go in sun, I black, when I cold, I black, when I scared, I black, when I sick, I black, and when I die, i still black. You white folks....when you born, you pink, when you grow up, you white, when you go in sun, you red, when you cold, you blue, when you scared, you yellow, when you sick, you green, when you bruised, you purple, and when you die, you gray. So who you callin' colored folk's???

        	 		  Car Crash  A man and his girlfriend are driving down the highway. The man asks 'If I drive 100 mph, will you take off your clothes?' and she agrees. So the man drives 100 mph and his girlfriend strips. The man is so busy looking at his girlfriend that he crashes into a tree. The car flips over, trapping the man and all of his girlfriend's clothes. All that is free of the car is the man's girlfriend and one of his shoes. The man yells, 'You have to go get help. Go to that gas station over there.' His girlfriend says, 'Are you kidding me? I'm naked.' 'Well,' replies the man 'Take my shoe over there, cover up yourself, and go get help.' So the woman covers herself with the shoe and goes to the gas station. She says to an attendant 'You have to help me. My boyfriend's trapped' 'I'm sorry ma'am' the attendant replies, 'he's too far in.'

      When the good Lord was making the world, he called Man aside and bestowed upon him 20 years of normal sex life. Man was horrified, but the Creator refused to budge. Then the Lord called the Monkey and gave him 20 years.  "But I don't need 20 years," said the Monkey. "Ten years is plenty."  "May I have the other 10 years?" asked Man. The Monkey agreed. The Lord called the Lion next and also gave him 20 good years. The Lion also only wanted 10, so again Man asked for the remaining ten. Then came the Donkey, who was also granted 20 years. Like the others, 10 was more than enough. Man again asked for the spare ten years and got them.  This explains why Man has 20 years of normal sex life, 10 years of monkeying around, 10 years of lion 'bout it, and 10 years of making an ass out of himself.

       This guy is suffering from extereme abdominal pain so he goes to the doctor. The doctor says that the problem is serious, but with medicated rectal inserts the problem should go away. After the inital insertion, the Doctor explains that the second should be inserted before bed.  That night, before he goes to bed, the man attempts to insert the medicine. After about 15 unsuccessful tries he calls his wife for help. His wife puts one hand on his shoulder and inserts the medicine. He lets out a scream. 'Did I hurt you?' his wife asks.  "No, but when I was at the doctor's, he had TWO hands on my shoulders!'

       A bear was chasing a little rabbit.  "Stop running and get back here!" yelled the bear.  "Never!" shouted the rabbit.  As the rabbit was running he tripped on a lamp. His soft furry foot brushed the lamp and out popped a genie.  The genie noticed the frightened rabbit was being chased by the bear.  The genie said to the bear,"Hey! If you stop chasing him I''ll grant you and the rabbit both two wishes!"  The bear agreed and was so eager he jumped to go first. He said, "I wish that a had the biggest penis in the world!"  *Poof!* and his wish was granted.  The rabbit went next, "I wish I had a super fast motorcycle!"  *Poof* and the rabbit''s wish was granted.  The bear looked at the rabbit and thought, "What a lame wish!"  For his final wish, the bear smirked as he wished that all the other bears in the world were female.  *Poof* his wish was granted.  The rabbit jumped on his motorcycle, revved the engine and laughed.  Just before he booked out of there he said, "I wish the bear was gay!"

      A group of guys were chatting with a good-looking girl and, somewhat improbably, asked her to climb this pole that was conveniently nearby. For whatever reason, she decided to do it.  When she told her mother what happened, her mother scolded her: "Don't you understand that they only wanted to see your underwear?"  The girl was understandably upset at being very stupid and naive, and decided to show those boys a thing or two.  The next day, they repeated their request, and when she came home she was beaming. "What are you so happy about?" asked her mother. "I totally showed them. Today I didn't even WEAR underwear."     ha who does that remind you of?

      One Friday, two women were sitting and talking. One woman looked up and saw her husband coming down the street with a bunch of flowers in his hand.  She rolled her eyes and said, “There comes the asshole with flowers in his hand. Now he'll expect me to spend the weekend on my back with my legs in the air.”  Her friend promptly replied, “Don't you have a vase?”

      Impossible is just a big word thrown around by small men who find it easier to live in the world they've been given than to explore the power they have to change it. Impossible is not a fact. It's an opinion. Impossible is not a declaration. It's not a dare. Impossible in potential. Impossible is temporary. Impossible is nothing.

       We've spent a lot -- and we mean A LOT -- of time debating "The Bases." What are they? When's the best time to hit each one? Does holding hands lead to kissing, or is it kissing that leads to a little of the touchy-feely? Ask three people what it means to get to second and you'll get three different answers. Tell those same three people that hitting a triple on a first date is okay, and watch the fireworks erupt.  Trust us -- this topic elicits more unease and discomfort than Pamela Anderson's eternally shape-shifting boobs. And so we ask you, oh wise eCRUSHers: 	 1) First base is:   		Holding Hands   		Kissing   		Frenching   		Juggling the Jugs 2) Second base is:   		Frenching   		Juggling the Jugs   		Below the Belt Frisking   		Oral 3) Third base is:   		Below the Belt Frisking   		Bump-n-Grind   		Oral   		Doing the Deed 4) A home run is:   		Bump-n-Grind   		Oral   		Doing the Deed   		Morally Reprehensible 5) How far SHOULD you go on a first date?   		First Base   		Second Base   		Third Base   		Home Run 6) How far WOULD you go on a first date?   		First Base   		Second Base   		Third Base   		Home Run 7) Should you wait until marriage to hit a home run?   		No - take the car for a test drive first, if you know what I mean.   		Maybe -- it totally depends on the person you're dating.   		Absolutely -- wait until after you're married.   		I can't get married anywhere but Toronto and Holland, so this question is insulting and stupid.    	 1. First base is: Holding Hands 		15% Kissing 		46% Frenching 		36% Juggling the Jugs 		3% 2.

      Wanna know a secret? That Hamlet guy? Had it all wrong. Seriously -- "To be or not to be?" Whatever! To date or not to date -- that's the real question!  So, when it comes to dating, are you in it for the long haul, or do you have the attention span of a gnat? Do you immediately start picking out china patterns with your significant other, or do you make like Julia Roberts in Runaway Bride and bolt at the first sign of commitment? Take our fast and easy quiz to find out whether you're a Devoted Dater or a Dedicated Dumper.  It's six simple questions -- and your life may depend on it! Okay, not really, but don't you want to know? 	 1) You're on your first date. Within fifteen minutes of sitting down, a couple of your date's friends show up and join you at your table. What do you do?   		Embrace this turn of events -- the more the merrier!   		Wonder what the hell your date's thinking, but play along anyway.   		Hit on one -- or all -- of the friends. 2) Your date's cell rings during dinner, and they answer the call to start yakking and giggling with one of their friends. What do you do?   		Shoot death rays of hatred from your eyes in your date's general direction.   		Tensely shred your napkin to bitty pieces while waiting for them to get off the phone.   		Maintain eye contact with your date while smirking and mouthing things like, "Who is it?" and "What's so funny?" 3) Your date suggests an appetizer loaded with garlic. You:   		Assume this will not be a romantic evening. At all.   		Assume your date has a fondness for garlic.   		Assume nothing! You don't even know this person that well! 4) Pick a Hollywood Tom:   		Tom Hanks   		Tom Cruise   		Tom Green 5) Your love life can best be summarized by which Hollywood movie title?   		The Wedding Planner.   		How To Lose A Guy in 10 Days.   		Some Like It Hot. 6) Which is your favrote shade of J. Crew blue?   		Heather Champagne.   		Pewter Moor.   		Splash.     Dedicated Dumper Don't know if you know this, but -- hey, where are you going? Just sit still and listen for a second: If the Short Attention Span Theater was looking for a new above-the-title star, you'd be perfect for the job. You are to dating what ADD is to -- hey! Over here, okay? Now, where were we?  Oh, forget it -- you get the idea, right? It's just that someday, when you realize you really want a significant other? Let's hope you've managed to work out your issues with commitment first.

      how dirty is your mind?   1) If the motion picture ratings board got inside your head and saw your last fantasy about your crush, they would:   		Rate it G.   		Rate it PG-13.   		Rate it NC-17.   		Order you deported. 2) Mazel tov -- you just won round-trip tickets to anywhere on Earth! Where are you headed?   		Cancun.   		Bangladesh.   		The Virgin Islands.   		Down Under, if you know what I mean, and I think you do. 3) You're at a video arcade, and you find a dollar on the ground. You use it to:   		Play some wholesome air hockey.   		Fire up that ancient Death Race 2000 in the corner.   		Replace the top scorer's name on Galaga with a smutty word.   		Pay for a bus ride out of this heathen hellhole. 4) Pick a number from the list below:   		482   		3.14159265   		24/7/365   		69 5) Does your milkshake bring all the boys to the yard?   		Yes.   		No.   		I could tell you, but I'd have to charge.   		Huh? Frozen dairy products? I can't figure this one out. 6) What astronomical phenomenon would you most like to see out of your space station window?   		Halley's Comet.   		A cute cosmonaut.   		The sun rising over Uranus.   		A supernova exploding. 7) So, how many licks does it take to get to the center of a Tootsie Pop?   		Ah-one, ah-two, ah-three.   		*Heh.* You said "licks."   		Didn't I already answer this?? 69!   		Stop befouling a beloved childhood memory.   Not So Fresh  Not perfectly clean, but not incapable of being washed off, either. If you were a dinner plate, you'd be coated with the remnants of last night's fettuccine Alfredo. Nothing wrong with that -- just make sure you throw yourself in the dishwasher every once in a while.

      fabityfabfab49: An attractive blonde and a handsome man step into the same elevator. The blonde sighs happily and says 'TGIF', and is surprised when the man replies 'SHIT'. The blonde thinks perhaps he didn't hear her correctly, so she repeats it once again: 'TGIF!' and once again the man replies 'S H I T'. Finally, the blonde explains 'Sir, TGIF - Thank God it's Friday!' Stepping out of the elevator, the man smirks and says 'S H I T - Sorry honey, it's Thursday.'

      fabityfabfab49: A priest was driving along and saw a nun on the side of the road. He stopped and offered her a lift which she accepted. She got in and crossed her legs, forcing her gown to open and reveal a lovely leg. The priest had a look and nearly had an accident. After controlling the car, he stealthily slid his hand up her leg. The nun looked at him and immediately said, "Psalm 129." The priest apologized. "Sorry sister but the flesh is weak." Arriving at the convent, the nun got out gave him a meaningful glance and went on her way. On his arrival at the church, the priest rushed to retrieve a bible and looked up Psalm 129. It read, "Go forth and seek, further up, you will find glory."

      fabityfabfab49: A fart can be quiet, A fart can be loud, Some leave a powerful, Poisonous cloud. A fart can be short, Or a fart can be long, Some farts have been known, To sound just like a song. Some farts do not smell, While others are vile, A fart may pass quickly, Or linger awhile. A fart can create A most-curious medley, A fart can be harmless, Or silent, but deadly. A fart can occur In a number of places, And leave everyone With strange looks on their faces. From wide-open prairies, To small elevators, A fart will find all of us Sooner or later. So be not afraid Of the invisible gas, For always remember, That farts, too, shall pass.

        Little Joey was sitting in the back of class rubbing his crotch, and the teacher asked, “Joey what are you doing?” Joey replied, “Teacher, my mommy had me circumsized yesterday and it still hurts.” So the teacher sent Joey to the principal's office to call his mother and ask what he should do.   When Joey came back from the office, the teacher noticed that he had his penis hanging out. Shocked, the teacher asked, “Joey, what are you doing!?” Joey answered, “Mommy told me to stick it out till lunch and then she would be here to pick me up.”

The police chief said he would show them a mug shot of someone for thirty seconds, then ask each one for a description. After showing the photo to the first blonde, he covered it, then asked her how she would recognize the suspect.   ''Easy,'' she replied. ''He only has one eye.''        The chief was stunned. ''He only has one eye because it is a profile shot! Think about it!'' He repeated the procedure for the second blonde and again asked how she would recognize him.    ''He only has one ear,'' was her answer.        ''What is the matter with you people?!? It is a profile shot! You are seeing him from the side!'' He repeated the procedure for the third blonde, then said, ''How would you recognize the suspect? Now think before you give me a stupid answer.''    After viewing the photo, she thought for a minute, then said, ''He's wearing contact lenses.''        This took the chief by surprise. He looked real hard at the picture and couldn't tell if the suspect had contacts or not, so he went into the database and looked at the report. Sure enough, when the mug shot was taken, he was wearing contact lenses! He went back to her and asked, ''How could you tell he was wearing contact lenses? Nobody else here in this precinct saw that!''    ''Well,'' she said, ''he can't wear regular glasses with only one eye and one ear, now, can he?''

      A man and his wife are stranded on a desert island. The wife begins to lose interest in her husband and wishes on a star that she would find another man. The next day a man is washed on shore. He is very nice looking and finds immediate interest in the wife. The husband was very pleased that there was another man to help work.    So they started on building a watchtower. The stranger and wife wanted to have mad passionate sex on the beach. So he tried to think of a plan. SO then the stranger offered to watch first from the watchtower. While the husband and wife worked, the stranger yelled, ''Hey! No fucking! Get back to work!''     At this, the couple yelled back, ''We're not fucking!''      A little while later the man again yelled out to them. And again the couple denied it. This happened several times during his shift up in the watchtower, and when his turn was over, the husband took over. With that, the stranger made love to the wife on the beach. The husband, watching, exclaimed, ''Wow, it really does look like they're fucking from up here!'''

The bartender says, ''He isn't here but I can do anything the manger can do for you.'' By this time the lady is running her fingers down his face and into his mouth and is letting him suck on her fingers.   She says, ''You're sure he isn't here?''      The bartender says, ''Yes, I'm very sure.''      The lady says, ''Well, I just wanted to tell him there's no toilet paper or soap in the women's restroom.''

      n engineer dies and reports to the pearly gates. St. Peter checks his dossier and says, "Ah, you're an engineer -- you're in the wrong place."  So, the engineer reports to the gates of hell and is let in. Pretty soon, the engineer gets dissatisfied with the level of comfort in hell, and starts designing and building improvements. After awhile, they've got air conditioning and flush toilets and escalators, and the engineer is a pretty popular guy.     One day, God calls Satan up on the telephone and says with a sneer, "So, how's it going down there in hell?"     Satan replies, "Hey, things are going great.   We've got air conditioning and flush toilets and escalators, and there's no telling what this engineer is going to come up with next."     God replies, "What??? You've got an engineer? That's a mistake -- he should never have gotten down there; send him up here."      Satan says, "No way. I like having an engineer on the staff, and I'm keeping him."      God says, "Send him back up here or I'll sue."     Satan laughs uproariously and answers, "Yeah, right.  And just where are YOU going to get a lawyer?"

The boy decides to go home and try it out. As he is greeted by his mother at the front door he says, “I know the whole truth.” His mother quickly hands him $20 and says, “Just don't tell your father.”   Quite pleased, the boy waits for his father to get home from work, and greets him with, “I know the whole truth.” The father promptly hands him $40 and says, “Please don't say a word to your mother.”   Very pleased, the boy is on his way to school the next day, when he sees the mailman at his front door. The boy greets him by saying, “I know the whole truth.” The mailman drops the mail, opens his arms and says, “Then come give your FATHER a big hug.”

         A man was chosen for jury duty who very much wanted to be dismissed from serving.        He tried every excuse he could think of but none of them worked. On the day of the trial         he decided to give it one more shot. As the trial was about to begin he asked         if he could approach the bench.          "Your Honor," he said, " I must be excused from this trial         because I am prejudiced against the defendant.        I took one look at the man in the blue suit with         those beady eyes and that dishonest face         and I said  'He's a crook!  He's guilty, guilty, guilty'.          So your Honor,         I could not possibly stay on this jury!"          The judge replied, "Get back in the jury box.         You are just the kind of juror we are looking for         -- a good judge of character.              That man is his lawyer."

       ok so today we had a family day.   basically i woke up and my mom was yelling. so i cooked french toast...actually not so bad. and then as a family we cleaned the family room up. meir was straightening something and the toaster fell on his head ( we dont normally keep toasters in the family room. it was one for cooking clay ) and he was bleeding all over, sooo gross. then we went to see cinderella story and meir and abba went to see i robot. now our movie was really good except after movies like that ( love stories where the girl always gets the guy and lives happily ever after) make me feel so alone and left out and completely unloved, so it was good but sad for me. then since abba and meir werent done yet my mommy drove me hannah and tamara to target where hannah TRIED to fill out an application. soo many questions took over 15 minutes and the only way she got thru it was saying dani did it i can too... over and over again  i made up my own question  your co worker is crying. what do you do?  a. go steal a box of tissues and comfort her/ him  b. tell your supervisor  c. ignore her/him  d. shove her/him under your register  e. start crying with them so people think its normal    these were the type of questions they asked. i wanted to kill myself  then we went to the mall and walked around . i got lost like 3 times, first in strawbridges, then in h and m and then in the mall. we went into kitchen kapers...best store, i played with all the fun stuff in there. i got a phone cover that smells like chocolate for a dollar, but doesnt fit. we were in models for the longest time and there were really cute guys in there so i was with them for a little while and then i got super bored so i called mel and got to talk to her mommy and then i went over to my mom and told her id kill myself if i didnt leave soon. the attendant guy thought i was nuts. so i left and wandered for a little while . and the really cute guys were in spencers but my mommy went into the leather store and god does that place smell so i didnt get to see them again. i should have gone up to them when i had the chance. but they were playing with the helmets and hockey sticks and skateboard so i kinda wanted to stay far far away. and besides guys kinda suck right now cause the one you like either doesnt like you back or doesnt talk to you at all...you know who you are....... then i went back and we left. but it was pouring and my skirt and sweatshirt was completely soaked. anyway the day was pretty good except for that stupid movie! ahhh  now were watching little rascals. as a family while we make dinner. joy!  ok so we ate dinner and we had salsbury steaks and my little sister was like davida what is this, so i pointed to five random ones and im like these are salsbury steaks the rest are hamburgers. so she ate one and then was still hungry so my abba said eat a salsbury steak and shes like no those are hamburgers. my family cracks up and my mom tells her i was lying and she said they are better when i lied. love her shes so cute  so we caught the end of little rascals and i wouldnt let tamara change the channel until he said whoopee cause ive watched that movie fifty times and always missed it and its the best line of the whole movie. and only some of us  and gila get that one. and now were watching hook. with pirates!! score

        On March 23, 1994, the medical examiner viewed the body of Ronald Opus and concluded that he died from a shotgun wound to the head. The decedent had jumped from the top of a ten-story building intending to commit suicide.    He left a note to that effect indicating his despondency. As he fell past the ninth floor, his life was interrupted by a shotgun blast passing through a window, which killed him instantly. Neither the shooter nor the decedent was aware that a safety net had been installed just below at the eighth floor level to protect some building workers and that Ronald Opus would not have been able to complete his suicide the way he had planned.    Ordinarily, Dr. Mills continued, "a person who sets out to commit suicide and ultimately succeeds, even though the mechanism might not be what he intended" is still defined as committing suicide. Mr. Opus was shot on the way to certain death nine stories below at street level, but his suicide attempt probably would not have been successful because of the safety net. This caused the medical examiner to feel that he had a homicide on his hands.    The room on the ninth floor from whence the shotgun blast emanated was occupied by an elderly man and his wife. They were arguing vigorously, and he was threatening her with a shotgun. The man was so upset that when he pulled the trigger he completely missed his wife and the pellets went through the window striking Mr. Opus.    When one intends to kill subject A, but kills subject B in the attempt, one is guilty of the murder of subject B. When confronted with the murder charge, the old man and his wife were both adamant. They both said they thought the shotgun was unloaded. The old man said it was his long standing habit to threaten his wife with the unloaded shotgun. He had no intention to murder her. Therefore the killing of Mr. Opus appeared to be an accident, that is, the gun had been accidentally loaded.    The continuing investigation turned up a witness who saw the old couple's son loading the shotgun about six weeks prior to the fatal accident. It transpired that the old lady had cut off her son's financial support and the son, knowing the propensity of his father to use the shotgun threateningly, loaded the gun with the expectation that his father would shoot his mother.     The case now becomes one of murder on the part of the son for the death of Ronald Opus.    Now comes the exquisite twist. Further investigation revealed that the son was in fact Ronald Opus. He had become increasingly despondent over both the loss of his financial support and the failure of his attempt to engineer his mother's murder. This led him to jump off the ten-story building on March 23rd, only to be killed by a shotgun blast passing through the ninth-story window. The son had actually murdered himself, so the medical examiner closed the case as a suicide.

      so i woke up this morning at like 9 and looked at the clock and was like screw this why am i up this early i dont have to work today! so i turn on the tv to .....something and fall back asleep till ten , when i wake up and the house is super quiet. i get a little nervous so i walk around the house a little then decide to go take a bath. so im in the bath reading double fudge- cute but very fudgelike- and i hear a guys voice in my house. it sounded familiar so i just sat there. then i hear hannah singing some random song so i continue reading. ari was at my house. i get out find the biggest towel i could go to my room and sit on my bed and watch dawsons creek till like 1130 then hannah says i have to go to the library so i get dressed and she and ari and i go to pick up michelle. ari makes fun of me the entire way there...shmuck.... then we drop ari off at his house and me off at the library, where i search for almost 30 minutes trying to find books by isaac bashveis singer but since im an idiot and kept typing in isaac bashevis singer instead of singer, isaac bashevis, i couldnt find it. i eventually did and then went to the desk for the devil weasr prada and gossip girl which my stupid library didnt have. i call hannah to come pick me up she says shell be there soon so i sit and start to read this book...in her shoes... really good and really slutty and hannah comes a half hour and 2 more phone calls later. i walk up to the car and michelle gets out of the front seat i get a little confused and just open the back door she gets back into the car and was like ive been in so many 2 door cars lately force of habit, ya we made fun of her the ride home. so i was hungry and so i started to make mac and cheese and then i go down into the pantry to find....something.... and see chocolate pudding which i needed and cambells soup which i havent had since school. and i got really excited so i went upstairs to make it. I ACTUALLY PUT IN WATER AND THEN HEATED THE SOUP UP! all by myself!! how proud rachel? then i remembered i was making mac and cheese so i ate my soup finished making the mac and cheese and just left it there. my mom came home and threw a fit about the kitchen but i didnt do it. and hannah and mich invited me to watch a movie with them,. and i would cause i love hannah and mich is cute, but they are watching pirates of the caribean which reminds me of someone i really care about who major fight with- if you read this im sorry hun- and i had to watch a pirate movie last night when i was fighting with him. and i really like pirates so when it hurts to watch them life really sucks. and how does ashli know who i am?   so i stayed in bed basically all day and finished my book...oh soooooo good!  and we ate dinner. i made pudding for work tomorrow. were making dirt- the kind with pudding and crushed oreo cookies and gummy bears and since i wanted it to be kosher i had to make the pudding but we only had one box of chocolate pudding so i decided to make a box of vanilla pudding mix it with the chocolate pudding and add chocolate syrup. tastes fine but when i mixed it i completely forgot to keep the mixer in the bowl and pudding got all over. so fun!

      my day was crazy!!  so i woke up this morning at seven when my mom decides to wake me up i smack her and go back to sleep. my alarm goes off at 730 and i get dressed and ready by 745 so i go eat breakfast and bother my little sister till 810 when i leave to go to megans. i walk to her house and by the time im at the zangers i remember i forgot the sprinkles for the pudding. so i turn to go back . im in the house getting the sprinkles when megan comes to my door and asks didnt i see you by my house? and im like ya ....... so were in the car and we get to work early. andy is already there and he made a playboy bunny in henna on his arm....really good actually. and we get into the classroom and i set it up, he does something important i forget what. then we go outside to set up the pools with elise. she goes to get the pool screams and runs all the way through the parking lot. i go to see what it was and there was cute little froggie in there. so i make andy come and catch it and he does and we put it in nicholas' extra clothes box and i poked holes in it. then we found an aquarium which was for some reason in the bathroom. and we put the froggie in there. the kids started coming in and asked his name and since i was sitting there blowing bubbles we named him bubbles. its so cute hearing the kids scream bubbles frog! abigail was muy scared of him but noah- the cute super quiet anti social - loved him. we brought having creme for the kids to play in when we went outside. we put tableclothes on the tables and just sprayed a ton of shaving creme on . i was already covered from when me and andy fought with the bottles. but we got eachother creamed! wow that sounds muy bad . so i was completely white in my hair and everything. so i go rinse my hair in the hose, not fun. but noah was cracking up and having the best time ever! so we did that = soooooooo fun= then went inside and made dirt. also really fun today was good. then andy tried to put henna on my arm, totally messed up, then we ate lunch. all the little kids wanted to eat with me!! felt sooooo special. then me andy and judi were talking about dirty stuff and doing dirty stuff at bar mitzvahs-ewww . then jessica was so cute i love her we had fun. and hannah came and picked me up and on the way home we say 84 of my cars! 84!!!!! i love hannah- shes BEAUTIFUL!!!  we got home and i forget what i did. but i read and watched tv and talked to jon! and hannah and michelle went to marlboro, without me. i ditched dinner...ha wasnt in the mood for sushi and then when my family decides to go to ritas i get up.....free ritas! we see the blains, but no ezra- aw boo.  i come home and paint my mommys toenails- not so cool but she cant do it herself cause she messed up her back and then we watched summerland together but then mommy fell asleep. i love summerland!!! there was a really funny commercial with the guy and the pants and the mannikan , manican, manniacan- how do you spell that?!?! chasing him and i was laughing for literally 3 minutes. and then a car chase commercial with a minivan. god

      my day was bittersweet  - ok people dont get the whole my day was..... thing. at dinner we used to go around the table and everyone would have to say my day was _____ and then a highlight of the day. the highlight thing was inititated after one night when i was the only one who got to talk.   i get up and get dressed. couldnt find any of my clothes and then went to work. i worked on mels birthday present a little when i got there and filled up the pool cause the decompresser wasnt working. then andy comes in and is a ......well cant really describe him. we have camp and i get asked by abigail- one of my favorite campers - if ill come babysit her....aww and we make spiders and leah is there and she does gymnastics with the kids and andy tackled me...looong story and didnt say goodbye. but he gave me his address in camp, see if i actually write to him  my phone died at like 9 this morning so i had no idea if i had a ride from camp, and so its like 130 and my mommy isnt there and then she comes and im starving cause for snack we had cookies and they werent kosher so i couldnt eat them so i hadnt eaten all day. so i eat my mommys popcorn then we go into kitchen kapers and weve been in a lot of kitchen stores lately so i knew exactly what to look for. the plastic oven mitts i love and the salad spinners. you gotta be with me. and then we went to produce junction and i talked in spanish with the guys there. que tal? muy bien y tu? muy bien gracias..... whoo hoo!! then we went home and i made food for me and read my book and then watched tv and now im babysitting meir while my mommy and abba go out cause hannah and tamara went to basketball practice. meir wanted dinner early because his tutor was coming so before my parents left i was making him mac and cheese. ive been making it forever, ok hannahs been making it for me for forever, and i know how i like it and how to make it. my mother sat there " follow the directions....use butter! look at the box" and she kept trying to add things to it. it tasted good!

      DynamiteDG: A man in a taxi cab taps the driver on the shoulder to ask him a question. The driver screams bloody murder, loses control of the cab, and swerves onto the sidewalk before stopping just inches from a lamppost.    After checking to make sure the passenger is OK, the driver says "I'm sorry, but you scared the daylights out of me!"    "Sorry. I didn't realize a simple tap on the shoulder would freak you out so much," the passenger says.    "It's not your fault," replies the cabbie.    "Today is my first day on the job after 25 years of driving a hearse."

      my day has been really long  i woke up at like 745 cause my mom came into my room to look for something and i guess im a really light sleeper and then i go downstairs and make shabbos - couscous apriot pie peach soup potatoes and then i made hash browns for breakfast. my mommy said we could go to this new outlet that opened up in cinnaminson after she picked up tamara. so i go get dressed and i walked into the chest at the end of my bed and tore my leg up, hurts like hell. and we picked up tamara and gave her a talking to cause shes been a real bitch and then we went to the outlet. it was the weirdest thing ever. not a normal outlet but it was one store with like different sections for different brands. anyway...... i got a blank sweatshirt sweatpants pajamas tommy bra a slip and birthday presents and i really wanted the devil wears prada but didnt feel like spending the money.not much only 8 bucks but i can get it from the library, so i just sat there for 20 minutes reading it. the only reason id go back to this store would be for the books and the sweatshirts... ive been looking for a blank one forever for my avi hochman sweatshirt and i found one......8 dollars. very nice  and we come home and im making pasta cause im super hungry

      my weekend was good  i got dressed after my shower friday night to go to shul- i go every friday night like a good girl- and i have hannahs shirt and skirt and my mommys shoes. hannahs shirt is too small in the boobs and my moms shoes are huge but they are soooooo pretty so i stuffed the toes with tissues. but she wouldnt let me wear them to shul cause it was all muddy so i put flip flops on not realizing if you walk in the mud in flip flops it kicks the mud onto your skirt. anyway...... i get to shul 15 minutes late- as usual- and i see the shul lights arent on and no one is in there. all the men are davening in the kiddush room. i didnt see a womens section so i just change my shoes, get a siddur and start davening in the lobby. by the time im finished mincha they have a women section ready. they took 6 chairs placed them in rows of two up against the wall and put a tallis rack up as a michitzah. whatever. we daven and get up to lcha dodi. worst tune i have ever heard! ever! so i go home and tell my abba that. the next morning he tells the rabbi who starts laughing and says thats the tune they had to use cause its so close to tisha bav... i felt sooo smart!  friday night dinner was hysterical! all during kiddush we were giving tamara purple nurples and as soon as kiddush was over she run up to her room and came down five minutes later. she had huuuuuuuge boobs. we all start laughing and she looks my mom in the eyes and says " got socks? " oh god! she looked hysterical. i said- is that why you never have any socks?- .....we had a fun meal and i got out of walking the dog with hannah cause michelle was there.  i made myself read 100 pages of isaac bashevis singer for school and then read good books and went to sleep. i woke up the next morning read the newspaper got dressed and had lunch. then i read my ym...ashlee simpson is soooooooo hot! more isaac bashevis singer and then read barbara delinsky- more then friends- such a good book. then  i slept a little , said havdalah . i worked on mels birthday present some more. and then watched animal house with my abba...... FUNNIEST MOVIE EVER!!!! really i sat there laughing the whole movie and then couldnt stop for a half hour later. you need to go see this movie!! then i steal pirates of the caribean from hannah and watch the bloopers and deleted scenes. then i watch about 5 minutes of the actual movie before i fell asleep.  today-  i woke up around 1130. said modeh ani washed negel vassar and watched more pirates of the caribean. then i make breakfast eat and get my mom to take me to kohls and target. there were soooo many people at target! all in the school supply section. my mom bought 15 packs of markers glue and rulers. then 30 notebooks 15 watercolors........sooooooo much stuff! then at kohls i got a new sports bag cause meir ruined mine. its yellow and so pretty. they had a pink one but it was too small. then we picked hannah up and went to bjs, where i got completely lost!! it was sooooo scary. we bought tamara a flute and this lady thought i was 18. cause we walked by her desk and she had bj bags and i said i want one! and she said sign up for the card...blah blah blah. i said i couldnt cause im just a little girl and shes like your not 18. i said no im 14. she started laughing and didnt believe me!  then we picked up meir tamara and my abba and went out to eat in the northeast at espresso cafe and sushi bar- horrible food but hannah saw jason and ari waks was there. and he didnt look so hot. he got really long sideburns but my brother the asshole goes up to him and says davida likes you... i hate little brothers. and then we got ritas cause i didnt eat anything at the resturant...muy bad. and now the whole family- besides for me is watching finding nemo      jens getting her phone tomorrow!! and i got two letters from her!

      my day was blah  i woke up watched finding nemo, got dressed and went to the orthodontist. we were early so we went into bed bath and beyond and then to the ortho appointment. i got taken in early so i was done before my appointment was origially scedueled. so i make hannah come pick me up and when she does benyamin is in the car. he was at my house writing the shtick. then we go to pick gershon up and hannah went inside and i was bored so i pulled out my tooth. and then we went home and wrote the shtick- i get to be me in it so im kinda excited.  then i ate pasta and made hannah take me shopping for a straightner. turns out they only need 8 inches for locks of love so im getting it cut. itll probably be up to my shoulders. really excited. and as i straightned my hair i watched teenage drama queen. it wasnt as good as i thought it was going to be.  little dissapointed and then we ate dinner and i had ice cream i really like ice cream. then the stupid fast started and morrison called me and i was on the phone with her for two hours- which is really really long for me but i love her!!!!  and  i cant watch tv or shower or listen to music or anything.......so screwed and i called jen but she was on her way to eicha so shes call me back later.  yay for me!

        Rachel:  Okay, it's missing something. Ooh, I know! Umm, okay. (Goes and grabs a bag, that looks like a purse, and shows it to Joey.)      Joey:  Really? A purse?      Rachel:  It's not a purse! It's a shoulder bag.      Joey:  It looks like a women's purse.      Rachel:  No Joey, look. Trust me, all the men are wearing them in the spring catalog. Look. (Shows him.) See look,  men , carrying the bag.      Joey:  See look,  women , carrying the bag. (He puts it on his shoulder and looks at himself in the mirror and likes what he sees.) But it is odd how a women's purse looks good on me, a man.      Rachel:  Exactly! Unisex!      Joey:  Maybe you need sex.  I  had sex a couple days ago.      Rachel:  No! No Joey! U-N-I-sex.      Joey:  Well, I ain't gonna say no to that.          hahah such a funny episode

      Jumper991: im gonna tell you a story  LethaLithuanian: yay!  Jumper991: ok so once upon a time there was a pretty pretty princess  Jumper991: her name was hannah  Jumper991: she had a best friend name jon but everyone called him jon the moron cause mean hannah casted a spelled on him  Jumper991: so everyday mean hannah would make jon the moron juggle and do magic tricks for her  Jumper991: and then she would throw tomatoes at him  Jumper991: jon led a very sad life  Jumper991: but one as he was skinny dipping- naked- wow thats redundant  Jumper991: a very cute maiden happened to pass by  Jumper991: and she said" jon "  Jumper991: and jon doesnt answer  Jumper991: so she says jon again  Jumper991: he still doesnt answer  Jumper991: she gets closer and says jon again  Jumper991: he doesnt answer  Jumper991: she progressively gets closer  Jumper991: and then whispers in his ear jon  Jumper991: and he jumps  Jumper991: and hes naked!!!  Jumper991: he sees this maiden and gets very embaressed  Jumper991: the maiden can see hes upset so she turns away and waits for him to get dressed  LethaLithuanian: sounds good  LethaLithuanian: except i dont have anythign to be embarrased about  Jumper991: this is my story silly!  Jumper991: you are naked in front of a cute maiden  Jumper991: you are embaressed!  LethaLithuanian: ok!  Jumper991: goo  Jumper991: so back to where i was before i was sooooo rudely interrupted  Jumper991: when jon is finally dressed he goes over and takes the maidens hand and leds her to go sit down  Jumper991: they sit down and talk and the maiden asks why he didnt answer when she called his name  Jumper991: and jon said " i was thinking of my dream last night. it was ever so enchanting. i met a girl and she loved me for me. and didnt care i was jon the moron . cause she knew inside i wasnt a moron."  Jumper991: now this maiden knew of the horrible cruelty of princess hannah   Jumper991: so she leaned over and gave jon a hug  Jumper991: then she said meet me here again tomorrow  LethaLithuanian: NICE!  Jumper991: and went off into the scary forest  LethaLithuanian: aww  LethaLithuanian: no good bye hug?  Jumper991: shhhh!!!  Jumper991: jon was so amazed at what had just transpired he just sat there transfixed  Jumper991: meanwhile the maiden is running thru the forest continualy looking at her watch im late im late for a very important date  Jumper991: then all of a sudden the trees start throwing apples at her  Jumper991: poor maiden is bruised and she cries as she runs  Jumper991: but she doesnt stop running  Jumper991: finally she gets to princess hannahs castle  Jumper991: where she takes off her clock  Jumper991: cloke  Jumper991: no  Jumper991: cloak  Jumper991: right?  Jumper991: and goes into the pantry and gets the mop. she ties up her long gorgoes red hair and gets to work because she too was under princess hannahs spell  LethaLithuanian: evil hannah  Jumper991: as soon as the maiden finishes mopping the floor until its shining  Jumper991: evil hannah storms in... mud all over her shoes. she has michelle- her lover and josh- her fictious boyfriend with her  Jumper991: they are all laughing at what a fool jon the moron was  Jumper991: princess hannah was cackling over wat a good job she did   Jumper991: then she stops right in front of the maiden and says what is that smell  LethaLithuanian: BITCH!  Jumper991: you smell of water  Jumper991: the maiden laughs and says what do you think i cleaned the floor with witch  Jumper991: and hannah turns around and then slowly faces the maiden  Jumper991: well.....the floor doesnt look very clean does it? i can see muddy footprints all over  Jumper991: then she kicks the bucket of dirty water at the poor maiden  Jumper991: spit on her hair and walks out  LethaLithuanian: i thought this was a story for ME  Jumper991: im having fun!  Jumper991: fine no mas story  LethaLithuanian: no!!  Jumper991: i just said id tell you a story  LethaLithuanian: keep going!!  Jumper991: didnt say what it was about  Jumper991: fine!  Jumper991: the maiden almost starts to cry and then realizes she cant let the bitch win so she stands up gets new water and starts dancing around with the mop until the floor is sparkling again.   Jumper991: because one of the reasons princess hannah help such contempt for the maiden was because she could dance  Jumper991: verrrrry well  LethaLithuanian: good for her  Jumper991: the maiden finished mopping cooked hannah and her entourage dinner served it and cleaned it up and then washed the windows  Jumper991: finally at around 2 am she went to sleep only to be woken up at 5 to bathe hannah and make her beautiful  Jumper991: we all know how much work that takes  LethaLithuanian: ha!!!  Jumper991: and then it was time for jon the moron to act again  LethaLithuanian: oh man  Jumper991: instead of his normal production he decides to tell jokes  LethaLithuanian: rescue me maiden!!  Jumper991: shhh!  Jumper991: he starts off with : A man is lying in a hospital bed with an oxygen mask over his mouth. A young nurse enters his room to sponge his face and hands. "Nurse," he mumbles from behind the mask, "Are my testicles black?" Embarrassed, the young nurse replies, "I don't know Mr. Jones, I'm only here to wash your face and hands." He struggles again to ask, "Nurse, are my testicles black?" Again the nurse replies, "I can't tell. I'm only here to wash your face and hands." The head nurse walks by and sees the man getting a little distraught, so she marches over to find out what's wrong. "Nurse," he mumbles, "are my testicles black?" The head nurse whips back the sheets, pulls down the man's pajamas, moves his penis out of the way, has a good look, pulls up the pajamas and says, "There's nothing wrong with them." Frustrated at this, the man pulls off his oxygen mask and asks again, "I said, are my test results back?!"  Jumper991: but no one is laughing  Jumper991: so he coughs nervously and says: Becky was on her death bed with her husband, John, maintaining a steady vigil by her side. As he held her fragile hand, his warm tears ran silently down his face, splashed onto her face, and roused her from her slumber. She looked up and her pale lips began to move slightly. "My darling John," she whispered.    "Hush, my love," he said. "Go back to sleep. Shhh. Don't talk."    But she was insistent. "John," she said in her tired voice. "I have to talk. I have something I must confess to you."    "There's nothing to confess," replied the weeping John. "It's all right.    Everything's all right, go to sleep now."    "No, no. I must die in peace, John. I slept with your brother, your best friend and your father."    John mustered a pained smile and stroked her hand. "Hush now Becky, don't torment yourself. I know all about it." he said, "Why do you think I poisoned you?"  Jumper991: jon the moron switches tactics and goes to ..... How many animals can you fit in a pair of pantyhose?  Jumper991: 10 little piggies, one ass, two calves, one pussy, and some crabs on hares.  Jumper991: but no one is laughing  Jumper991: jon is getting very very anxious  Jumper991: he glances at princess hannah who looks monster pissed  Jumper991: he immediatly pulls out his balls  Jumper991: hahahahahhaahahaha  LethaLithuanian: whoa  Jumper991: sorry  Jumper991: and starts juggling  Jumper991: but now its too late  Jumper991: hannah screams off with his head!!!!  Jumper991: but instead of chopping off his head they throw watermelons at him  Jumper991: and watermelons hurt  Jumper991: so jon is running to get away  LethaLithuanian: im tough  Jumper991: not when you have watermelons being thrown at you!  Jumper991: and he stumbles on a watermelon and gets hit with three more  LethaLithuanian: yea i am  Jumper991: ahh   Jumper991: ouch!  Jumper991: oh no  LethaLithuanian: ok  Jumper991: the pain the pain!!!  LethaLithuanian: i think im gonna take over  LethaLithuanian: jon catches a watermelon  Jumper991: but you dont know how its supposed to end  Jumper991: joooooon!  LethaLithuanian: crushes it in 1/2 with one hand  LethaLithuanian: and takes the bigger 1/2  LethaLithuanian: and dumps it on davida's head so sh ecant tell anymore of the story  LethaLithuanian: unless she wants to change it  Jumper991: no now im not telling you anymore  Jumper991: and it was soooooo good  Jumper991: now im going to bed  LethaLithuanian: no  Jumper991: yes  LethaLithuanian: otherwise img onan b mad at u  Jumper991: what!  Jumper991: the ending was that jon the moron and the maiden fall in love and when the kiss the broke the spell and jon became the handsome prince and shocked princess hannah into dumping her lesbian lover and her " boyfriend" only to be turned down for her maiden who when the handsome jon said he loved her she turned into the most beautiful princess and stupid hannah became the maid        Jumper991: but because you are RUDE you didnt get to hear that part  LethaLithuanian: oh  LethaLithuanian: man  LethaLithuanian: i suck  Jumper991: ya  LethaLithuanian: im sorry  LethaLithuanian: :'(  LethaLithuanian: forgive me?  LethaLithuanian: davida  LethaLithuanian: ur too awesome  LethaLithuanian: thatw as the ebestest story ever  LethaLithuanian: :'(  Jumper991: now im still stuck under the evil princesses spell  LethaLithuanian: so what do we do?  LethaLithuanian: wht abt me?  Jumper991: i dunno......i didnt get to tel lthe rest of my story  Jumper991: sweetie....you dont have to be under her spell to be a moron  Jumper991: oooh burn!  LethaLithuanian: ouch  LethaLithuanian: ok  LethaLithuanian: inte  Jumper991: that was mean  Jumper991: im sorry  Jumper991: mwah i love you baby  Jumper991: well break the spell soon  Jumper991: wink wink

      my day was exhausting  its a fast and i couldnt go to sleep last night cause i always watch tv or listen to music until i fall asleep and i cant cause of tisha bav . so i wake up when my alarm goes off get dressed and procrastinate for 45 minutes cause i didnt have to make lunch shower or eat breakfast. stupid clock. then we go to work i make copies and the little kids start coming. i love jessica she is sooo cute. so they play for a little while and then cause it was raining we take them into the multi purpose room and they play with the balls and bowling and the parachute. then we take them back inside and they paint and have snack and i have to pour the juice give out snack and i cant eat it. damn fast days! then i take the kids out, by myself, and judi keeps a couple to paint more. so were outside on the yellow playground and as we get there the really cute guy went inside. aww boo! but while we were there the 3 year olds came out, and they are sooooo sweet and they wanted to go on the monkey bars over and over again. then they decided there are aliens and monsters and we have to run away from them on the wet soggy ground and i have to carry each kid on my back. silly me ended up twisting my ankle and breaking my shoe so i was running on the wood chips barefoot. not hot. then we go inside and the kids color. really it takes so long to make the kids color my god! and i cut out the really intriquite little stars and then get all their lunches ready. i hate bologna and it smelled sooooo good today. and jessica saw i forgot my lunch and she kept offering me her goldfish, muy cute. hannah comes picks me up and we go home and i immediatly go lie down and watch tv and fall asleep till like 5:30 and i completely miss the ncsy meeting thing which i was told wasnt going to be a real meeting just watching the beverly hillbillies but nooo they actually had a meeting. so after i wake up i ignore calls from everyone and just sit and watch tv and put my hair up in a pony which looks really pretty cause my hair is really long and straight now. then i tried to draw the design for our sweatshirts this year. if anyone can draw really good hillbillies tell me! and my mommy is having an art class and its sooooo loud. not in the best mood, damn fast! but i get to go shopping and hair cutting tomorrow.and jen has her phone!!!   and then i watched sex and the city and friends and ate dinner and now that hannahs back im having ice cream! i love ice cream

      my day was pretty good  i didnt have to get up early cause hannah drove me to camp . i get there at like the same time as jessica and steven. and we set up the classroom together and then judi and sam come in and noah gives me a really cute candle causeit was his last day and they wrote a card and it said evita on it. cause the kids cant pronounce davida for some reason so they all call me their own version of my name and i guess when the parents asked, thats what noah said.... soo cute! and gillian gave me a tip and an offer to go to ocean city for a week as a babysitter. not bad. we play and gillian always plays with the animals... this is straight from her mouth " the aminals are going on bacation today and they are going to heaben and then they are gonna die...is that funny? " this girl is hysterical!!!! and have fun and go outside and made rocket ships for snack out of whipped cream a banana ( or as my cutie jessica calls them a nana) fig newtons and chocolate chips. came out really cute. really jessica is soooo cute and smart. shes 3 and can spell her name fowards and backwards and goes on " my top" ( my back ) and ah i love my campers! im only gonna have 4 next week. jaide is obsessed with judi's son, sam, and wouldnt leave him alone. it was really cute actually. and then hannah and josh come pick me up and we listen to really good music in car and then i made chicken nuggets! and wrote thank you notes to everyone... im so nice! and stupid hannah is watching mulan- without me! - so im trying to conquere my fear of the lion king so im watching it. alone. ya it didnt work cause as soon as i thought the stampede was coming i went downstairs to hannah- we watched mulan music videos and danced...we are so alike! . but i watched the rest of the lion king so its better then before. then everybody left and i got bored so i went to sleep and some retard - cough cough jon! - wanted to know if i suck my thumb when i sleep so hannah turned on my light and i woke up and now im cranky and cant go back to sleep....why!!!!!  DynamiteDG: aww, im sorry  DynamiteDG: jons an idiot  DynamiteDG: y would he want to know that?  Jumper991: cause hes an idiot    xjusticediedhere: jon sucks  xjusticediedhere: GO SLEEP

       Everytime I try to talk to you  I get tongue-tied  Seems like everything I say to you  Comes out wrong and never comes out right    So I'll say 'why don't you and I get together and take on the world and be together forever  Heads we will and tails we'll try again  So I say why don't you and I hold each other and fly to the moon and straight on to heaven  Cause without you they're never going to let me in  And slowly I begin to realize this is never going to end  Right about the same you walk by  And I say 'Oh here we go again'

      my day was........... bittersweet it was the last day of camp, and my mommy couldnt drive me cause she had to take hannah to register for public school so i was supposed to get a ride with megan but i slept too late and she had already left by the time i got there. so i stupidly decide to bike to work, over a half hour away in the car and on some major highways and roads. i dont have my own bike so i take meirs and put leggings on under my really cute mini skirt and sneakers. i start biking on rt 38 im on the left side, with no bike path flipping out cause the cars are freaking speeding past me and then i hear like beep beep beep behind me and my mom is pulling me over. shes freaking out cause im on the wrong side of the road and i could have died- she drives me to work and im there really early. again. i set up the classroom its all good. and i get a pretty watch and two gift certificates to the moorestown mall and 20$ from judi- i had a really good time working with her this summer, shes fun! we play and then go down to arlenes room and i love the kids there. me jake and nickolas....best friends! they tell me im beautiful(( yes im a sucker for compliments )) and then when were outside on the bikes i sat down and all of a sudden there were like 8 little kids surrounding me all asking me different things. maya is the cutest thing... ah im gonna miss them all so much! and then hannah comes and picks me up and we go to this weird school - that should only have been like 20 minutes away but it took us 45 minutes cause hannah sucks. she gets registered and i go get a hair cut. while im there this girl calls the stylist and tells her to keep her peeps off her man ..... really such little kid stuff it was hysterical. she did a crappy job on my hair, i came home and fixed some of it. and its really really really short! Night Wolf504: u look like a dude? lildevil16711: lol short? lildevil16711: woah Roenick454: kool Bling2xx: uyy Bling2xx: watd u do to it Rosebud6891: i think itll look cute on u Rosebud6891: poicutrin it Rosebud6891: lol Rosebud6891: aww Rosebud6891: so cute* Rosebud6891: picture time** Rosebud6891: lol shev4ev: im sure u look awesome! shev4ev: cuz u look good in everythin! Coolgal805 (4:36:27 PM): thats hot as fuck! OMi689: thats so exciting-how short? shoulder?  ok its an inch above my shoulder and short and i donated it to locks of love.... i keep repeating to myself, all for a good cause its all for a good cause. i hate it. oh well im hoping to take the train up to see rachel today, maybe my mommy will let me. i searched for hours for a train or a bus but alas, there are none. so i sleep and eat dinner and then we go to ritas! yes and i watch will and grace and actually sit there laughing. funniest show and then this reality thing with hulk hogans daughter making her album....ashlee simpson rip off.booooooooooo

          If Parrots Could Talk         A lady was looking for a present for her husband Harry, the pirate. She went to the only pet shop in town to buy one. The pet shop owner refused to sell her the one parrot he had.  "You don't want this one, it has lived in a brothel all its life."  "Yes, I must have it", said the pirate's wife." Harry has wanted a parrot all his life, and this is a beautiful bird!"  "Thanks, gorgeous," said the parrot, and he was soon taken to the lady's house. She put him into the corner, covered him up, and waited until the party that night to show her husband his gift. When she uncovered the parrot, her husband was amazed. Then the parrot said.  "Nice house, better broads; oh, Hi, Harry!"       DON'T TALK TO THE PARROT    One morning, Mrs. James woke up and her dishwasher wasn't working. She called a repairman and he said that he would be able to come out and service the dishwasher that afternoon.  Since Mrs. James worked during the day, she said, "You can come out this afternoon but I won't be at home. I'll leave a key under the back door mat, you fix the dishwasher and leave me a bill. I'll mail you a check tomorrow. I need to tell you, though, that I have a Pit Bull. He's a gentle dog so don't worry about him. I also have a parrot. He's not so nice, so whatever you do, DON'T TALK TO THE PARROT!!"  Later that day, the repairman let himself into Mrs. James house and sure enough, there was her Pit Bull. He was a gentle dog . . he just lay on the rug and watched the repairman do his work.  The parrot, however, was another story. He screamed, and squawked, and lunged at the repairman the entire time he was in the house.  Finally the repairman couldn't take the bird's screaming any longer and he yelled, "SHUT UP YOU STUPID BIRD."  At that, the parrot looked at the Pit Bull and said "Sic 'em, Brutus."                                             If Parrots Could Talk         A lady was looking for a present for her husband Harry, the pirate. She went to the only pet shop in town to buy one.

Finally the repairman couldn't take the bird's screaming any longer and he yelled, "SHUT UP YOU STUPID BIRD."  At that, the parrot looked at the Pit Bull and said "Sic 'em, Brutus."         Bi-Lingual         So this guy goes into a pet store and sees a beautiful parrot but it has a blue string handing from one foot and a red one from the other. He thinks this is a little strange so he asks the shopkeeper what the strings are for. "Well this is a highly trained parrot" the shopkeeper replies. "If you pull the red string he talks in French, if you pull the blue string he talks in English". "Wow" exclaims the man shopping that's really neat "What happens if you pull them both at the same time?"  "I fall off my perch you idiot!" exclaims the parrot.          Fowl Language         A young man named John received a parrot as a gift. The parrot had a bad attitude and an even worse vocabulary. Every word out of this bird's mouth was rude, obnoxious and laced with profanity. John tried and tried to change the bird's attitude by constantly saying polite words, playing soft music, and anything he could think of to set a good example. Nothing worked.  Finally, John got fed up and he yelled at the parrot. And, the bird yelled back. John shook the parrot, and the bird got angrier and ruder. Finally, in a moment of desperation, John put the bird in the refrigerator freezer. For a few minutes, John heard the bird squawk and kick and scream...then suddenly there was quiet. Not a peep for over a minute.  Fearing that he'd hurt the bird, John quickly opened the door to the freezer. The parrot calmly stepped out onto John's out-stretched arm and said, "I believe I may have offended you with my rude language and actions. I am truly sorry, and I will do everything to correct my poor behavior."  John was astonished at the bird's change of attitude. As he was about to ask the parrot what had made such a dramatic change in his behavior, the bird continued, "May I ask what the chicken did?"           Long  ago li ved a seaman named Captain Bravo. He was a manly man's man who showed no fear in facing his enemies. One day, while sailing the seven seas, a lookout spotted a pirate ship and the crew became frantic. Captain Bravo bellowed, "Bring me my red shirt."  The First Mate quickly retrieved the captain's red shirt and while wearing the bright frock he led his mates into battle and defeated the pirates. Later on, the lookout spotted not one, but two pirate ships. The captain again howled for his red shirt and once again they vanquished the pirates. That evening, all the men sat around on the deck recounting the day's triumphs and one of the them asked the captain: "Sir, why did you call for your red shirt before battle?"  The captain replied: "If I am wounded in the attack, the shirt will not show my blood, and thus, you men will continue to resist, unafraid." All of the men sat in silence and marveled at the courage of such a man's manly man.  As dawn came the next morning, the lookout spotted not one, not two, but TEN pirate ships approaching. The rank and file all stared in worshipful silence at the captain and waited for his usual reply. Captain Bravo gazed with steely eyes upon the vast armada arrayed against his mighty sailing ship and, without fear, turned, and calmly shouted: "Get me my brown pants."      A burglar broke into a house one night. He shone his flashlight around, looking for valuables, and when he picked up a CD player to place into his sack, a strange, disembodied voice echoed from the dark saying, "Jesus is watching you."  He nearly jumped out of his skin, clicked his flashlight off and froze. When he heard nothing more after a bit, he shook his head, promised himself a long vacation after his next big score, then clicked the flashlight back on and began searching for more valuables. Just as he pulled the stereo out so that he could disconnect the wires, clear as a bell he heard, "Jesus is watching you."  Totally rattled, he shone his flashlight around frantically, looking for the source of the voice. Finally, in the corner of the room, his flashlight beam came to rest on a parrot.  "Did you say that"? He hissed at the parrot "Yes," the parrot confessed, then squawked, "I'm just trying to warn you. " The burglar relaxed.  "Warn me, huh? Who do you think you are anyway?"  "Moses," replied the parrot.  "Moses," the burglar laughed. "What kind of people would name a parrot "Moses?"  The parrot quickly answered, "The same kind of people that would name a Rottweiler Jesus."      A magician worked on a cruise ship in the Caribbean.  The audience was different each week, so the magician allowed himself to do the same tricks over and over again.  There was only one problem: the captain's parrot saw the shows each week and began to understand how the magician did every trick. Once he understood, he started shouting in middle of the show: "Look, it's not the same hat!" "Look, he's hiding the flowers under the table." "Hey, why are all the cards the Ace of Spades?"  The magician was furious but couldn't do anything. It was, after all, the captain's parrot.  One day the ship had an accident and sank. The magician found himself on a piece of wood in the middle of the sea with, as fate would have it, the parrot.  They stared at each other with hatred but did not utter a word. This went on for a day and then another. On the third day, the parrot could not hold back: "OK, I give up. Where's the boat?

I cant believe all the good things that you do for me  Sit back in the chair like a princess from a far away place  Nobodys nice when you hold her your heart turns twice  Shut out what they say their too dumb to need it anyway   When we were kids, we hated things our sisters did  Backyard summer pools and Christmases were beautiful  And the sentiment of colored mirrored ornaments  And the open drapes looked out on frozen farmhouse landscapes   Have you forgotten how to love yourself?

        Monica:  Ross, you've got to do something about the humping.  Ross:  What? It's, it's just a phase.  Chandler:  Well, that's what we said about Joey...  Ross:  Would you all relax? It's not that big a deal.  Rachel: [Out of shot]  Stop it! Marcel! Bad monkey!  Ross:  What?  Rachel:  Let's just say my Curious George doll is no longer curious.        Chandler:  How about Joey... Pepponi?  Joey:  No, still too ethnic. My agent thinks I should have a name that's more neutral.  Chandler:  Joey... Switzerland?  [The waitress brings their coffee]   Joey:  Plus, y'know, I think it should be Joe. Y'know, Joey makes me sound like I'm, I dunno, this big.  [Waitress looks at him funny]  Which I'm not.  Chandler:  Joe...Joe...Joe...Stalin?  Joey:  Stalin...Stalin...do I know that name? It sounds familiar.  Chandler:  Well, it does not ring a bell with me...  Joey: [Writes it down]  Joe Stalin. Y'know, that's pretty good.  Chandler:  Might wanna try Joseph.  [Joey visibly thinks 'Of course!' and writes it down]   Joey:  Joseph Stalin. I think you'd remember that!  Chandler:  Oh yes! Bye Bye Birdie, starring Joseph Stalin. Joseph Stalin is the Fiddler on the Roof.      Ross:  She says Marcel's humping thing's not a phase. Apparently he's reached sexual maturity.  Joey: [To Chandler]  Hey! He beat ya.      Joey:  I dunno what to say, Ross. Uh, it's a monkey.  Ross:  Just, just say what you feel.  Joey:  Marcel, I'm hungry.  Ross:  That was good.            ROSS:  Man, I sure miss Julie. CHANDLER:   Spanish midgets. Spanish midgets wrestling.  Julie.  Ok, yes, I see how you got there.    (phone rings)  ROSS:  You ever figure out what that thing's for? CHANDLER: No, see, I'm trying this new screening thing. You know, I figure if I'm always answering the phone, people'll think I don't have a life. My god, Rodrigo never gets pinned. (MACHINE--JOEY'S VOICE):  Here comes the beep, you know what to do. JADE: Hello, I'm looking for Bob. This is Jane. I don't know if you're still at this number, but I was just thinking about us, and how great it was, and, well, I know it's been three years, but, I was kinda hoping we could hook up again. I barely had t he nerve to make this call, so you know what I did? CHANDLER:  What? JADE:  I got a little drunk...and naked. CHANDLER:  Bob here. CHANDLER:  (on phone) What've you been up to? JADE: Oh, you know, the usual, teaching aerobics, partying way too much. Oh, and in case you were wondering, those are my legs on the new James Bond poster. CHANDLER:  Can you hold on a moment?  I have another call.  (to Ross) I love her. ROSS:  I know. CHANDLER:  I'm back. JADE:  So, are we gonna get together or what? CHANDLER:  Um, absolutely.  Uh, how 'bout tomorrow afternoon?  Do you know  uh, Central Perk in the Village, say, five-ish? JADE:  Great, I'll see you then. CHANDLER:  Ok.  Ok.  Having a phone has finally paid off. ROSS: Even though you do do a good Bob impression, I'm thinkin' when she sees you tomorow, she's probably gonna realize, "hey, you're not Bob." CHANDLER: I'm hoping that when Bob doesn't show up, she will seek comfort in the open arms of the wry stranger at the next table. ROSS:  Oh my god.  You are pure evil. CHANDLER:  Ok, pure evil, horny and alone.  I've done this.                  MONICA: I'm at work, ordinary day, you know, chop chop chop, sauti, sauti, sauti. All of a sudden, Leon, the manager, calls me into his office. It turns out they fired the head lunch chef, and guess who got the job. JOEY:  If it's not you, this is a horrible story                  PHOEBE:  No, huh uh, no way, I'm sorry, not gonna happen. CHANDLER:  Whoa, whoa, prom night flashback.                  PHOEBE:  Oh, well, then you'll have extra seats, you know, for all your tiaras and stuff. CHANDLER:  Why did you look at me when you said that?                  CHANDLER:  Yeah.  Just let me grab my jacket and tell you I had sex today.           ROSS:  Whoa!  You had sex today?           CHANDLER: Wow, it sounds even cooler when somebody else says it. I was awesome, ok? She was biting her lip to stop from screaming.            ROSS:  Wow.           CHANDLER:  Now I know it's been awhile, but I took it as a good sign.           (phone rings) ROSS:  Still doing the screening thing? CHANDLER:  I had sex today.  I never have to answer that phone again. MACHINE:  Here comes the beep, you know what to do. JADE: Hey, Bob, it's Jade. Listen, I just wanted to tell you that I was really hurt when you didn't show up the other day, and just so you know, I ended up meeting a guy. CHANDLER:  Bob here. JADE:  Oh, hi. CHANDLER:  So, uh, you met someone, huh? JADE:  Yes, yes, I did.  In fact, I had sex with him 2 hours ago. CHANDLER:  So, uh, how was he? JADE:  Eh. CHANDLER:  Eh? JADE:  Oh, Bob, he was nothing compared to you.  I had to bite my lip to keep from screaming your name. CHANDLER:  Well, that makes me feel so good. JADE:  It was just so awkward and bumpy. ROSS:  (silently mouthing) Bumpy? CHANDLER: Well, maybe he had some kind of uh, new, cool style, that you're not familiar with. And uh maybe you have to get used to it. JADE:  Well there really wasn't much time to get used to it, you know what I mean?               RACHEL:  Who gave you that hickey? MONICA:  That would be the work of a Blowfish. RACHEL:  Oh! PHOEBE: Oh! I can't believe it. I can't believe this. We're just like, sitting at home, trying to guess Joey's fingers, and you guys are out like partying and having fun, and you know, all, "hey, Blowfish, suck on my neck".     .     CHANDLER:  [singing to the tune of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood]  Who's the bitterest man in the living room, the bitterest man in the living room? Hi, neighbor.         JOEY: Hey, if she were marrying a guy, she'd be like the worst lesbian ever.              MONICA:  [entering]  All right. Tell me if this is too cute. Lesbian wedding, chicken breasts. RACHEL: Oh god. I think I'm gonna be sick. MONICA: Why? It's not like I'm putting little nipples on them.                                    MRS GREEN: This is so much fun, just the girls. You know what we should do? Does anybody have any marijuana? RACHEL: God! MONICA: All right, look, nobody's smoking pot around all this food. MRS GREEN: That's fine. I never did it. I just thought I might. So, what's new in sex? RACHEL: Oh! What's new in sex? MRS GREEN: The only man I've ever been with is your father. MONICA: I'm dicing, I'm dicing, I don't hear anything. MRS GREEN: I mean, this is no offense to your dad, sweetie, but I was thinking there might be more. RACHEL: Oh, I'm sorry. You know what? I cannot have this conversation with you. I mean, god, you just come in here, and drop this bomb on me, before you even tell Daddy. What? What do you want? Do you want my blessing? MRS GREEN: No. RACHEL: You want me to talk you out of it? MRS GREEN: No. RACHEL: Then what? What do you want? MRS GREEN: I guess I just figured of all people you would understand this. RACHEL: Why on earth would I understand this? MRS GREEN: You didn't marry your Barry. I did. RACHEL: Oh. MONICA: All right people, we're in trouble here. We've only got 12 hours and 36 minutes left. Move, move, move! CHANDLER: Monica, I feel like you should have German subtitles. MONICA: Joey, speed it up! JOEY: I'm sorry, it's the pigs. they're reluctant to get in the blankets! PHOEBE: Monica, how did this happen? I thought you had this all planned out. MONICA: Do you want me to cry? Is that what you want? Do you wanna see me cry? PHOEBE: Sir! No sir! MONICA:  [to Ross]  All right, you! ROSS: No. Look, I told you I am not a part of this thing. MONICA: All right, look, Ross. I realize that you have issues with Carol and Susan, and I feel for you, I do. But if you don't help me cook, I'm gonna take a bunch of those little hot dogs, and I'm gonna create a new appetizer called "pigs in Ross". All right, ball the melon. CHANDLER: Hey! How come I'm stuck dicing, when he gets to ball the melon.       JOEY: It just seems so futile, you know ? All these women, and nothing. I feel like Superman without my powers, you know? I have the cape, and yet I cannot fly. CHANDLER: Well now you understand how I feel every single day, ok? The world is my lesbian wedding.         CHANDLER:  [to the woman who just rejected him]  All right look. Penis schmenis. We're all people.  [She walks away again.]                 heeheeehee.........waay too much time on my hands
