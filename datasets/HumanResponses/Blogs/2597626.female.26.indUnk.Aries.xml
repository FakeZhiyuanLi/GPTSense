      Go now and read the latest article by  urlLink Ann Coulter .  I can wait.  ...  ...  ...  Did you read it?  Good.  Encourage all your liberal friends to read it.  It will either challenge them to think about who they support and why, or it will annoy them.  Either way you win!!

      This  urlLink story  is chilling.  It outlines what the terrorists wanted.  It was, sadly what they got.  Spain fell for the terrorist trick.  They expected that other nations would falter and the US would be left alone in Iraq.  That did not happen, and we know they will try again.  It's a given.  This article reinforces the need for the partners in Iraq to remain strong in the face of terrorists.  People who say we should back down, should leave the Middle East, are no better than terrorists.    Shocking, huh??

      The father of slain civilian Nick Berg was quoted in an  urlLink article  published by the AP as saying, "What I'm trying to do is show to the American people and the British people ... that war has a wretchedly horrible face,"   I'm afraid we have seen that face, Mr. Berg.  We got a really good look on 9/11 when we were attacked by cowards who killed thousands of innocents in an attempt to destroy us on our own ground.  Yes, Mr. Berg, we have seen it.  We see it again and again in the eyes of cowards who kill innocent people in the name of Allah.    Do not ever doubt that we have seen it.  What I wonder is how you can sleep at night knowing you are using the death of your son for political gain?    Mr. Berg went on to say, "There are 11,000 plus Iraqi citizens that are dead and each one's family is as affected as I was, but the American media doesn't cover these people. It doesn't cover the people who are suffering the most."  How about the thousands who died in the torture rooms and rape rooms under Saddam's rule?  What about the people who were killed for speaking out against the evil of Saddam and his sons?  What about the  thousands of lives saved  by our going to Iraq?  Why does no media outlet report that?   Because, the Media does not cover the things that happen in Iraq that make us look good.  Where is your sense of injustice for that?  The Media refuses to report anything in a positive light in the Middle East.   The final quote of the article is:      "Observing someone's pain just makes you think just how can they (Bush and Blair) possibly do this. There isn't enough money in the world that could ever make this worthwhile."   This man lost a son, and for that I am truly sorry, but what makes me even more sorry is the way he is  using  his son to promote a liberal agenda.  He returns to the favorite liberal mantra, 'Bush did it for the money, he did it for the oil.'  Your propaganda has blinded you to the truth.  It is people like you, Mr. Berg that the terrorists just love.

      Monday was a great day!!  We handed over Iraq to the people of Iraq.  I have been reading http://www.iraqthemodel.blogspot.com this evening and I am so surprised and happy.  There is a seed of hope in me that is starting to take root.  Every day I am grateful for my country, for our military, for the bravery of the Iraqi people, and for my President.    This makes me ponder . . .   Why is it that the American media does not report the joy that so many in Iraq feel over the transition?  I know they want to do whatever they can to make the average citizen feel ashamed they are American.  Shame on them for doing that!!!  What we did in Iraq needed to be done.  We, along with the UK and our other partners (no international support, HA!!  If I were any citizen of a nation that helped in the fight to deliver freedom to Iraq I would be protesting this VERY loudly EVERY day!!!), helped to bring freedom to people who were drowning in the oppression of the Saddam regime.  How, may I ask, is that bad??  How can we bring terror if we deliver freedom?  John Kerry was out again today mouthing off about how we need an international backing and how he would be the man to bring peace to Iraq with international support.  Sen. Kerry, I have no words to express how much you offend me.  You have no right at all to bad mouth the president when you have been weak on American security, American Military AND you protested against your own troops when you returned from Vietnam.     You voted against the money that is going to support the troops in Iraq (after you voted for it) and you are out there everyday telling us how bad things are going and how Bush led us into this war with lies.     I am afraid of where you would lead this nation.  Into the hands of the UN?     If we pull all of our troops out of the Middle East and tell them we are really,  really  sorry, then maybe, just maybe, they will see how truly nice we are.  They may forget the error of their civilan killing, homicide bombing, WMD making, cowardly beheading on video to scare innocent people ways, and be our friends??    FAT CHANCE!!!!   All you are doing, Sen. Kerry, is delivering the same propaganda that is fed to the media.  In case you have not noticed the international community HATES us.  They have not stood with us when the chips were down.  They paid lip service after 9/11, but they hate us as much as Michael Moore.  (More on him another Blog)    The terrorists would love nothing more than for the Americans to leave the Middle East so they can once again claim victory.  They believe that if they hit us hard and often we give in.  Look at what happened after Clinton led us into the disaster in Somalia.  Osama Bin Laden was reported to have said that what happened was proof that we are cowards.  That we run away when things get bad.  Of course, he was not impressed with the very brave camel and aspirin bombings . . . but then there was really no one around to see those . . . except the very unlucky camel!!!  I am afraid that Kerry is the kind of coward that would have our military tuck tail and run.  I am afraid he would deliver us to the UN.  I am afraid he would increase the scope of the federal government through taxes, National ID Cards, gun registration, and so much more.  I am afraid he would dismantle our military and weapons systems.  I am afraid he would create a PC state where you can be punished for what you say or how you say it.      Be afraid   Mr. and Mrs. America. If Kerry wins America loses, and the generations to come will have to fight to clean up his mess.  Nifty Link of the Day!!!

           I urlLink &nbsp;told you so!! &nbsp;  As I said below, Whoopie and her Liberal pals are now saying she is being punished for speaking her mind.&nbsp; She is quoted as saying, "America's heart and soul is freedom of expression without fear of reprisal."&nbsp;&nbsp; So, because she&nbsp;made vulgar puns on the Presidents&nbsp;name and bashed our government in a most ugly way she should not be subject to any kind of reprisal?  &nbsp;  Sorry Whoopie, that does not wash!!&nbsp; The right to free speech does not protect you from&nbsp;hearing what other people think of what you&nbsp;say.&nbsp; The Republicans that threatened to boycott SlimFast had the same free speech rights as you.&nbsp; In this case SlimFast decided they did not want to risk a boycott&nbsp;and stand behind your vulgar&nbsp;comments.&nbsp; That is THEIR right.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  You can cry race, sex . . . whatever, but this all comes down to class.&nbsp; Something you lack.  &nbsp;  Our actions in life&nbsp;have consequences.&nbsp; These are the consequences of your actions at Radio City Music Hall.&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest you learn to deal with it.&nbsp;

       SlimFast  urlLink dumped  Whoopie!! Oh my gosh!! I am so shocked . . . I know a lot of people that contacted the company, myself included, but I never expected them to respond this quickly!   Good for SlimFast, showing some class. If I owned a company I would expect better behavior from one of my paid reps. I am sure the Dems will pour forth in the morning and claim that Whoopie is the victim, that her right to free speech has been violated.   She had her say, and consumers had their say with the fine folks at SlimFast, and the fine folks at SlimFast did what they thought best. They listened to the consumer. If that is not free speech in its most base form, I don't know what is!!   Hooray for the people that stood up and said, "This is not the kind of person you need selling your products." Hooray for the fine SlimFast people for taking note and taking action.   Boo to the people who will say that Whoopie is exempt from the kind of punishment a conservative would get if they did a similar thing to Kerry, or Hillary Clinton.

      I am very disappointed with the Philippines.  They have  urlLink pledged to remove their troops  from Iraq, all 51, because terrorist murders have threatened to kill a truck driver.  They appear to be caving in, just like the Spanish.  They are giving the terrorists just what they want.    Being a coward will only reward you with more terror because you prove you are a wimp once, they will strike at you again and again because they know they can.  I would reconsider this movement President Arroyo.  You sentence your people to years of terror . . . and you have on one to blame but yourself.

      I am not al all surprised that John Kerry has not had time to attend a  urlLink national security briefing  about the new terror threats for the months leading up to the election.  He has been very busy with " urlLink Fund Raisers " and  urlLink petting  John 'I'm so pretty' Edwards.    Well, that and his American history lessons with Teresa.  “No Teresa, there is only ONE Tennessee . . .”, but I digress.  I wonder why Kerry and the DNC will not release the video of the  urlLink Fund Raiser   at Radio City last week?  I do not buy the "It was a private party" line AT ALL.  Might it be that he does not want the average American to see the kind of people that he gets money from?  Is it maybe that he does not want people to see him laugh as Whoopie Goldberg makes 'clever' jokes about female naughty bits and our President?  Maybe it is because Kerry capped off the evening telling every one in attendance that his campaign, that was raising money at that moment, stood for American values.  I'm sorry!!  Not my values, maybe the values of your 'party' guests.  (I guess American values are the values of liberals.  Conservative values are to be ignored.  Typical.)  Kerry has already proven that he has a potty mouth, so why are they holding out on the tape?  He dropped F-bombs in Rolling Stone for goodness sake!!  Why is he now ashamed of the words of others?  I smell some hypocrisy here since it is not two weeks ago Democrats were clamoring for Cheney’s head for telling Sen. Pat Leahy to  urlLink go f&*@ himself .  Seems America needs to give a collective "Duce you, Mr. Kerry" (Thanks Charles Karuthammer for this lovely expression)in November.  It seems that is the only thing many liberals can understand.

                   Well, the decision has been made.&nbsp; I could lie and say I  was shocked, excited,&nbsp; about to wet my pants,   and all the other things&nbsp; that   people&nbsp; have said &nbsp;since  yesterday morning, but I am not a liar.&nbsp;&nbsp;   Kerry selected John Edwards to be his VP , a  nd it was  h ardly a shock.&nbsp;&nbsp; L et's  face it ,  Edwards is the best person Kerry  could have chosen for a number of reasons. &nbsp;  I will outline&nbsp;a few here. &nbsp;     &nbsp;    1st - He is pretty. People are calling him the "Breck Girl"  or,&nbsp; the  much cuter "Opie".&nbsp; We  know how American women are swayed by a pretty face , and speaking out of honesty, Kerry is not a pretty  man .&nbsp; One of the reasons Clinton saw two terms in the White  House&nbsp; was  his "good looks".&nbsp; (I  for one never got that.&nbsp; I saw a slime ball, but I go for substance, not  the pretty package)&nbsp; Edwards gives this ticket charm, wit,&nbsp; youth,  and the much needed charisma that Kerry  lacks. &nbsp; Note that the Kerry poll numbers  would not move in his favor after a big week of campaigning and ads?&nbsp; Now  that the spunky Edwards has joined the team they expect soccer moms and  brainless twits to go ga-ga.     &nbsp;    2nd - He is from the South.&nbsp; This does two things for  Kerry (in theory, mind you).&nbsp;     &nbsp;    One, it takes some of the hard "Yankee Liberal" off.&nbsp;  Southern democrats are supposed to be more moderate than their&nbsp; N orthern counterparts.&nbsp; (Lets ignore for a  second that Edwards voted with Hillary and Ted "the swimmer" 90% of the time,  and is ranked  as &nbsp;the 3rd most liberal  senator  in Washington ).&nbsp; Since  Edwards has&nbsp; a  more moderate image it  makes the duo more accessible to the average working Joe.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Visit  www.GOP.com  and  look up info on Kerry and Edwards voting records.&nbsp; Their liberal agenda is  quite clear by their past actions)     &nbsp;    Two, Edwards is supposed to have some kind of Juju -Mojo  over southern voters.&nbsp; I guess just  being from the&nbsp; S outh is enough, in  the eyes of the DNC, to have&nbsp; redneck  morons&nbsp; flocking  from the  trailers  to vote.&nbsp; You know us Southerners, we are dumb as  hell!&nbsp;&nbsp; You just HINT you are a 'good  ol' boy' and we can't resist!!&nbsp; Let's forget that the South is a Republican  stronghold, that the majority of the Southern states went Bush in 2000.&nbsp;  Edwards was well on the road to losing his senate seat this election.&nbsp; The  people in NC call him Senator Gone because he missed so many important  votes.&nbsp; Yeah, we Southerners are too dumb to know  better.     &nbsp;    3rd - He brings a lot of donors to the table.&nbsp; Trial  lawyers and their rich patrons.&nbsp; This, however, can backfire.&nbsp; The new  campaign finance reform laws put some pretty strict limits on the amounts that  can be spent from private donors. &nbsp; I do not  think it would take much digging to see that the fat checks sent to Edwards  during his primary run for President were made up of illegal funds.&nbsp; It  will be hard to spend the first few months of the campaign defending the money  your VP raised.&nbsp;          &nbsp;      http://www.nypost.com/postopinion/opedcolumnists/24531.htm          &nbsp;     Also, Edwards does not draw the  big Union support&nbsp;that Kerry needs.&nbsp; (If I were Kerry&nbsp;I would not  worry too much about that.&nbsp; The Unions always vote for the Democrats, even  when the Democrats do all they can to hurt the American&nbsp;worker.&nbsp; Can  we say, NAFTA??)&nbsp;          &nbsp;     4th - The following is  important.&nbsp; Listen up now.           &nbsp;     The Boston Herald has already  said&nbsp;Kerry/Edwards swing&nbsp;farther to the left than Ted "The Swimmer"  Kennedy.&nbsp;&nbsp;The liberal group&nbsp;Americans for Democratic Action said  that the Kerry/Edwards ticket is&nbsp;more liberal than the Mondail/Ferraro  ticket.&nbsp; BE AFRAID!!!&nbsp;     They claim that the Kerry/Edwards ticket is  balanced.&nbsp; How?&nbsp; One is old and dull, the other young and  exciting?         &nbsp;     Liberal is as Liberal  does.&nbsp;          &nbsp;       &nbsp;       &nbsp;       &nbsp;       &nbsp;       &nbsp;

      The story below just proves my point that the democrats want to turn the US into a UN run state.    urlLink Read Me    We should fight this tooth and nail!!  There is no way the UN can be a fair observer of the elections.    Florida representative Eddie Bernice Johnson is heading up this movement, no shock there.  She is quoted as saying, "As lawmakers, we must assure the people of America that our nation will not experience the nightmare of the 2000 presidential election."    The article goes on to say:   The bipartisan  [and by bipartisan they mean moderates and liberals]  commission, they stressed, determined "that the 'disenfranchisement of Florida's voters fell most harshly on the shoulders of black voters' and in poor counties." Both groups vote predominantly Democratic in US elections.   That's right, white men went out and made the voting process so very hard for minority and poor voters.    I can see it now; old white men, a little paunchy but very well dressed, sitting in a well appointed drawing room, leather bound volumes line the walls.  Clounds of Cuban cigar smoke waft gently and brandy is poured into crystal snifters.  They plan and plot against the poor and minority voters in Florida.  Bush is in the center of this group, on the phone with the Saudis making sure they approve.  This is the same crowd, says Ted "The Swimmer" Kennedy, that planned the war in Iraq and knew in advance that Osama and his killers were going to fly planes into the WTC.    Get real people.  We can not let this pass.  We MUST stand up and say that the UN has no authority over America and they are not welcome to "Observe" the elections.  I wonder, who will stand against this??

      There are few things in this world sadder than the pictures of Saddam Hussein that were all over the  urlLink news  today.  So thin, so grey and so very insane.  He really and truly believes he did nothing wrong.  Even now he is spewing the kind same garbage that he was spewing before the invasion.  The following quote from Saddam sounds like something our pals Michael Moore, Jeanene Garofalo, Al Franken, the big three media outlets, Katie Couric, and John Kerry would say.   "You know that this is all a theater by Bush, the criminal, to help him with his campaign."   It is sad when American citizens say the same rhetoric as the man who killed thousands of his own people just for grins.  How can anyone dispute that the war in Iraq was just and right?  How can anyone look at the pictures of mass graves, rape rooms, starving children, and then see how well Saddam and his family lived and DOUBT for a SECOND that what we did was just?  This quote sums it all up nicely.   "He (Saddam) should be placed in metal cage and taken on tour of all the Iraqi cities so that the millions who have been starved, robbed, beaten, deprived and tortured by his regime can see the man responsible for their suffering," said Asaad Aziz, an engineer in the mostly Shiite city of Basra.    I could not have said it better myself!

      If there was any doubt that Michael Moore was un-American, this  urlLink story  out of China should remove all doubt.  I can't wait to see the film  Michael Moore Hates America  at  urlLink AFR film fest  in Dallas in September.
