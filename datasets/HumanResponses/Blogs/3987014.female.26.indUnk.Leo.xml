      Found out recently that Jim Henson's Storyteller has come out on dvd in the US. Loved watching it as a kid. My cousin borrowed the videos for me from a local video store and I would just be enthralled. I've always had this fascination with fairy stories and mythical themes.  Have always loved Jim Henson too - remember Fraggle Rock, Muppet Show, Muppet Babies, Sesame Street, Dark Crystal?    Read some reviews that the filming techniques are now a bit dated and amateur-ish, but I'd love to own this dvd anyway. Been googling but I don't think it will be released in Australia anytime soon. Might have to wait 6 months or so and see what happens.     Just found out that Jim Henson released another series based on the Greek Myths. How exciting! Would love to watch that but where can I get copies of them? Hmm ... that might be my next task if I ever get around to it.

        It's my birthday tomorrow but I received some beautiful flowers today from a work collegue. It is so nice to get surprise flowers! Made my day. What a wonderful way to start the weekend.   Note to self:&nbsp;must remember to do it for others more often.

       Was browsing to see which new Disney animated films will be coming out in the near future and found this really interesting site created by Roe E. Disney (Walt's nephew) & Stanley P Gold. I haven't explored the site enough to find out if Roy and friends have any sinister non-Disney agendas (which I'm sure they do) but they sure do raise some really good points.   For example, I agree that Disney has sold out somewhat and diluted their own image and brand by making unimaginative, inferior sequels to milk the cash cow. Examples include Cinderella II, Little Mermaid II, Tarzan and Jane, Jungle Book 2 etc. I also am a bit disappointed re:&nbsp;they have warped classic fairy tales to&nbsp;in order to always have happy-endings. Little kids now don't know the real story of the Little Mermaid, Hunchbank of Notre Dame or Pocahontas which is quite sad. Not saying that those movied by themselves were bad, because I did love Little Mermaid. :)   What I don't quite understand is though,&nbsp;if they are not wiling to tell the tale the way it was meant to be, why bother choosing that story to begin with? There are many other fairytales that can be told. For example, their wonderful versions of Beauty and the Beast, Snow White and Cinderella did just that. There are so many fairytales they would draw upon such as Little Red Riding Hood, The Ugly Duckling etc.   After all this ranting, I still love Disney and will always give it a benefit of the doubt to turn around. There's always something special about Disney.

       Been buying some cookbooks and I've decided that I want a herb garden. Not sure if I have a green thumb though. I remember owning venus fly traps but I lost interest in them because they didn't catch flies. I also remember owning a little money plant that I put in a glass container. Left it by the window one windy day to give it some sunlight and it blew away.    Now, I've decided I will research herbs and grow some in pots on my balcony. My first try will include basil, mint, coriander, parsley, rosemary and thyme (maybe). I want chilli too even though it's not technically a herb.    Would love some ideas if there are other herb growers out there.   Which should I grow together? I've already found out mint has to grow on its own because it spreads like wildfire!

       So I finally bought some herbs about two weeks ago.    The coriander and parsley are growing amazingly well. They're gorgeous! I've already used some for cooking which is great. My mint has grown about twice its size too. My thai basil is dying though. I thought it was one plant and so when I tipped it out for replanting, it broke apart into little seedlings with one or two beansprout-like roots each. I tried to replant them but I think they've decided they'd rather not fight to live anymore. I hope at least one of those little seedlings survive. I am vouching for them.
