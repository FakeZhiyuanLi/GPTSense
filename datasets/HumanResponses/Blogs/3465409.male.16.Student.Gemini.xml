      I was ready a TIME magazine the other day and came across some polictical polls. The numbers where extremely close, 48% Kerry, 49% Bush, and 3% unsure if the election was held that day. With Nader it was something like 6% Nader, 43% Kerry, 48% Bush, and still 3% undecided. So more people would vote for Bush. That's not a bad thing but another poll underneith asked people whether they thought Bush  wasn't  doing a good job as president. More people said YES, they thought he  wasn't  doing a good job. Suprising since more people said they would vote for Bush. So they think Bush isn't doing a good job as president, yet they would still vote for him. Wierd.

           I know that it's an older movie but it has been bugging me for a long time and I hope that if I right it down it might help a little.      My favorite movies are the LOTR trilogy, with my favorite of the three being the 3rd and last one. The ROTK is the only the 2nd movie to make over 1 billion US dollars, $1,117,602,779 to be exact  urlLink (http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/2003/LRDR3.php) . With that much money you have to think that it is movie that has made the most money but it hasn't. Somehow, Titanic (1997), made more. Titanic has made over a billion US dollars as well, the first movie to do so. It has made $1,835,400,000  urlLink (http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1997/TITAN.html) . Now that a lot a money. Now granted, ROTK hasn't been around for as long as Titanic, but still, how does a movie about a ship that EVERYONE know what happens to, make so much money? Anyone who doesn't know that the ship sinks must be living under a rock, no offense to those people who do live under rocks. And Leonardo DiCaprio is not that good of an actor. While both Titanic and ROTK have won the Academy Award for Best Picture, ROTK well deserved it, but Titanic, not to much. Now I'm not trying to make people who like Titanic mad, or trying to say that Titanic is a bad movie, just that I can't quite see how it made so much money and won Best Picture. ROTK was the better movie by far and I hope that it makes lots more money than Titanic has in the number of years that it has been out.

            So I have family in Canada and in America. I was recently visiting in Canada and they just had a federal election.  The four main parties running where Liberals, Conservative, NDP, and Bloc Quebecois. Now the Bloc Quebecois, the federal party based in Quebec, has no chance of winning but still runs (sort of like Ralph Nader). My sister was saying how she REALLY didn't want the Liberals to win, because of all the bad/not-so-good things she has heard about them. She is only 12. Of course the Liberals win, but not by a majority. Therefore Canada is now screwed, government wise, for the next two years until they have another election.       Now the US is also getting ready for a federal election. There are only four more months until November, which still is a long ways away. The campaign commercials are already very annoying. Now the sad thing about American elections is basically how they are done. It takes forever to do. Looking at the polls right now, the 2004 election looks like it will probably be another 2000 election. So it's a year of campaigning, a month to vote, and another half a year to decide who is president and in the end the Supreme Court might decide. That's the voting system of the most powerful country in the world. Wonderful.       Canada has a good way of doing elections. It's fast and well done. But then a party can win by a minority, therefore giving it basically no control. America has trouble doing elections. It takes way to long and can get really messed up. Why not try and combine the two ideas? Both countries need help with elections. As for America's 'confusing' ballots, why not make something easier. Like an ATM machine or something. Perhaps someday..........
