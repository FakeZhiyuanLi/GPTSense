      I just arrived home from my final day of treatments.  ACK!  I'm somewhat relieved its over but left with the battle scars.  I was heavily bandaged when I left however, they were irritating so I took them off and put on smaller ones that are less irritating...for now.  The one on my head was particularly nasty.  YACK!   I lost my legs again... Dr. Frankenstein said that might happen but it doesn't make any easier to deal with.  I have a big weekend and now without my legs, its looking even bigger.    But you all know me...always a smile.  I have to believe that I meant to take this path and overcome these odds as a means of higher living...better living.    I leave you with my song of the day, Jill Scott's  GOLDEN :   Ok (ay) Oh (oh) Hey (ay-yay) yeah..... Oh..  yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah.....  I'm taking my freedom pulling it off the shelf puttin' it on my chain wearing it 'round my neck I'm taking my freedom puttin' it in my car wherever i choose to go It will take me far  I'm living my life like it's golden living my life like it's golden living my life like it's golden living my life like it's golden living my life like it's golden (golden) living my life like it's golden living my life like it's golden living my life like it's golden living my life like it's golden (golden)  I'm taking my own freedom puttin' it in my song singing loud and strong proving all day long I'm takin' my freedom puttin' it in my stroll I'll be hop-steppin' y'all lettin' the joy unfold  I'm living my life like it's golden living my life like it's golden living my life like it's golden living my life like it's golden living my life like it's golden (golden) living my life like it's golden living my life like it's golden living my life like it's golden living my life like it's golden (golden)  I'm holdin' on to my freedom 'Can take it from me I was born in-to it, it comes naturally I'm strumming my own freedom playing the god in me representing his glory hope he's proud of me...  I'm living my life like it's golden living my life like it's golden living my life like it's golden living my life like it's golden living my life like it's golden (golden) living my life like it's golden living my life like it's golden living my life like it's golden living my life like it's golden (golden)  hope he's proud of me...  living my life like it's  golden, golden, golden, golden, golden, golden, living my life like it's  golden, golden, golden, golden, golden, golden, living my life like it's  golden, golden, golden.....    BLESSED BE!

      John Irving writes that a fiction writer's memory is an "especially imperfect provider of detail; we can always imagine a better detail than we can remember." The most truthful detail, he contends, is what  could  have happened, what  should  have happened.  Irving traces the beginning of his own writing career to a time when he and his friends mercilessly taunted the mentally retarded man who collected garbage on Front Street in his stately New Hampshire neighborhood, much to the dismay of John's prim and proper grandmother.  "Oink, oink," they would call as "Piggy" Sneed tossed the trash into the back of his rickety pickup, which was filled with pigs. Real pigs. Rumor had it that Piggy slept with the pigs in their pigpen. He never spoke but was said to snort and oink, just like his pigs.  When the local fire department's alarm sounded and a truck was dispatched to Piggy Sneed's pig farm, John, the youngest volunteer, could not believe it. The men joked on the way to the fire that Piggy would roast with his pigs because he was too stupid to escape. Hanging from the side of the truck and feeling the heat of the fire on his face as they approached Piggy's farm, John began to wonder who Piggy really was. And, he began to feel guilty about tormenting the man who'd never done anything to him.  Maybe he's not really retarded, John reasoned. Maybe he's saving money from the sale of his pigs to move to Florida, John suggested to the other firefighters. They just looked at him in disbelief. Or, John imagined, Piggy is from Europe or somewhere else and he doesn't speak English, that's why he never talks.  But as the flames grew hotter and engulfed the entire pigpen, it became apparent that Piggy could not possibly have survived, were he with his pigs that night as he usually was.  Not until they pulled Piggy's burned and blackened body from the fire did John relent. (Maybe he had family in Florida and was planning to join them there).  For Irving, writing became an endless journey of  Trying to Save Piggy Sneed , the title of his 1996 memoir. His stories and books are his attempts to rewrite history, to run back into that fire and pull Piggy out alive -- or to prevent the fire from starting in the first place.  A lifelong habit of writing stories has skewed my own sense of recall and reality. As a small child, I escaped my own fears by writing stories of triumph and perserverence and creating characters with courage and conviction. Before long, what  really  happened took second chair to what  should  have, what  could  have happened.  These days, as my beautiful friend Lynn fights for her own life and I watch, as helpless as John and the other men dangling from the sides of that fire truck, I am again grateful for the ability to write, rather than think, my way through things.  The real truth is that Lynn will be well, healed, cancer-free. What  should  be for her is health, peace, love and laughter. What  could  be for her is a world of endless possibilities. Lynn is the most loving, giving and gentle soul I've ever encountered. My brain does not even know how to begin thinking about what  is;  it is filled with stories of what should be, what could be.  As I sat talking with Lynn today after Day 2 of her week-long treatments, I took off my shoe and pointed to my foot. I'd absent-mindedly banged it on the desk while sitting at the computer writing. "Look," I said. "I've got a bruise."  The absurdity of my little bruise hit us simultaneously. There she sat, Band-Aids on both arms, exhausted and somewhat disoriented from the rigors of a quintuple dose of god-knows-what, gearing up for a mystery procedure on her head during Day 3. There I sat with a slightly bluish spot on my foot. We both burst out laughing.  "Aw," she said. "You've got an owie."  Yes, I do, I thought. And you're going to be fine. You're going to be well. You're going to live. Because if you weren't, I sure as hell would not be sitting here talking about my bruise.

      This week is filled with tests of strength and humanity for me.  My treatment regimen began with a bang so to speak. My dosage is 5x its normal amount and I will be entering guinea pig territory tomorrow...they will attempt to alleviate pressure in my head caused by a tumor that we can't seem to get control over.  I have no idea what shape all this medical crap will leave me in for my weekend adventure in NYC.  Will I have legs? I hope.  Will I be able to stand? I hope.  Will I be able to move? I hope.  Will the pain subside long enough for me to at least put on a good front so those that don't know me well will not see thru my facade...one where I am well and able.  Dream big dreams and hope for a bright tomorrow!  Blessed Be!

      When I lose my way or when I lose sight of my priorities, I turn to her words. The Invitation has changed my life and it feeds my soul and serves as such a means of inspiration and that all too important kick in the ass.    The Invitation   It doesn’t interest me what you do for a living. I want to know what you ache for and if you dare to dream of meeting your heart’s longing.  It doesn’t interest me how old you are. I want to know if you will risk looking like a fool for love for your dream for the adventure of being alive.  It doesn’t interest me what planets are squaring your moon... I want to know if you have touched the centre of your own sorrow if you have been opened by life’s betrayals or have become shrivelled and closed from fear of further pain.  I want to know if you can sit with pain mine or your own without moving to hide it or fade it or fix it.  I want to know if you can be with joy mine or your own if you can dance with wildness and let the ecstasy fill you to the tips of your fingers and toes without cautioning us to be careful be realistic remember the limitations of being human.  It doesn’t interest me if the story you are telling me  is true. I want to know if you can disappoint another  to be true to yourself. If you can bear the accusation of betrayal and not betray your own soul. If you can be faithless and therefore trustworthy.  I want to know if you can see Beauty even when it is not pretty every day. And if you can source your own life from its presence.  I want to know if you can live with failure yours and mine and still stand at the edge of the lake and shout to the silver of the full moon, “Yes.”  It doesn’t interest me to know where you live or how much money you have. I want to know if you can get up after the night of grief and despair weary and bruised to the bone and do what needs to be done to feed the children.  It doesn’t interest me who you know or how you came to be here. I want to know if you will stand in the centre of the fire with me and not shrink back.  It doesn’t interest me where or what or with whom you have studied. I want to know what sustains you from the inside when all else falls away.  I want to know if you can be alone with yourself and if you truly like the company you keep in the empty moments.

      Morning all. Today needs to be a brand new day in every sense of the word.  I'm not sure how it will turn out but at least today, I have hope for a tomorrow.  I will leave you with Anastacia to begin your day.  Blessed Be!   Welcome to My Truth  ~Anastacia   Sentimental days  In a misty clouded haze  Of a memory that now feels untrue  I used to feel disguised  Now I leave the mask behind  Painting pictures that aren't so blue  The pages I've turned are the lessons I've learned   Somebody bring up the lights I want you to see  (Don't You Feel Sorry For Me)  My life turned around  But I'm still living my dreams  (Yes it's true I've been)  I've been through it all  Hit about a million walls  Welcome to my truth.. I still love  Welcome to my truth.. I still love   Tangled in a web  With a pain hard to forget  That was a time that I've now put to rest  Oh, the pages I've turned are the lessons I've learned   Somebody bring up the lights I want you to see  (Don't You Feel Sorry For Me)  My life turned around  But I'm still living my dreams  (Yes it's true I've been)  I've been through it all  Hit about a million walls  Welcome to my truth.. I still love  Welcome to my truth.. I still love   Sentimental days  In a mist of clouded haze  Of a memory that now feels untrue   Somebody bring up the lights I want you to see  (Don't You Feel Sorry For Me)  My life turned around  But I'm still living my dreams  (Yes it's true I've been)  I've been through it all  Hit about a million walls  Welcome to my truth.. I still love  Welcome to my truth.. I still love

      Did you ever have one of those days that you would rather pluck your eyeballs out than go thru again? That was my day yesterday. Aside from the recently normal pain and cancer related crap, I got to leave something very dear to me as a means of self preservation. After over a year of one bastardizing slap in the face after another, it was just time. Did you ever encounter people who live for drama? Well, these people made my life like really bad community theater. There was all the name calling, reputation smudging and balls out innuendo of a good 70s camp movie. Much like a campy movie, these characters think they have a leg up or have gotten the better of you...now THAT is funny. I can just see the victory dance now - I hope it rains. BAH HAHAHAHAHAHA.  It was a day that makes you look and feel like this:    Now where is my coffee? The BEST thing to come from yesterday was the following quote I found while being frazzled from lack of clean air:  I've gone to look for myself. If I should return before I get back, keep me here.

      What on earth am I doing with a blog?? Well I'll tell you... In the last year or so, there have been so many misconceptions about me floating around... People think they know but they have no idea.  This also gives me the opportunity to discuss charities and life-works that matter to me.  That's why I'm here...how bout you?
