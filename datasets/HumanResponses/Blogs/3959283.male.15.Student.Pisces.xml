       People are too sheltered.    They sit at home all day watching fake reality.    They watch TV sitcoms where everyone seems to have a “perfect” life.    Every once in a while there is a problem in their "perfect" reality.    They make a joke out of this problem, and it is soon resolved and everything goes back to normal.    Many people think that life should be like that, when there is no way in hell that it will ever happen that way.    If people want to live like that…you’re a dreamer.    Nothing can be perfect.    People like to think that their life “sucks” or they are terribly depressed because of things not going their way.    The reason people think their life sucks is because they suck.    They don’t know how to look at what they have and see what’s good about it, especially the upper middle class people.    They have a lot of money and a lot of things.    They have so many things and yet some will be depressed.    They get upset because of one little thing that they probably never cared about in the first place.    I was once like this too once.    When I was like 4 my great aunt gave me a quarter to get a gumball.    I was so excited (come on I was four) and I was really hoping not to get the white gumball.    Unfortunately I got the white gumball.    I was so pissed off; I think I even started to cry.    I pouted and I pouted, but yet I just stuck the gumball in my pocket.    I was still pissed as hell but we went over to the park.    There was some sort of festival going on at the time so there were a lot of people at the park.    So I waited and I waited to get a swing, and I finally got one, and while I was swinging the stupid white gumball that I didn’t even want feel out of my pocket.    Some older kids decided it would be fun to take my gumball.    Two older kids came over and started to basically play keep away with the gumball.    They had me diving in the sand and everything getting horribly dirty just for a gumball I didn’t even want.    I even started to cry.    I started to call for my Mom but when I turned around the two jerks ran off.    I started chasing after those kids as fast as my little legs would go.    I didn’t find them, and I began to cry.    I cried over a gumball I didn’t want.    I think about this and I think to myself, “What the fuck was wrong with you Mike”.    I didn’t even need the gumball.    I should have cared less if they stole that gumball, I didn’t want it so who gives a damn.    Well I did.    I wanted candy, but if it was white I was going to be upset.    It’s just like someone getting their first car.    They want a car so bad, but when they see that the only car they can get is some junked car that all its good for is going from point A to point B…they don’t want it.    They want a car but they don’t want this one because it doesn’t look good.    The car runs fine, but it looks like shit.    I say to people, “you wanted a car right?    And this is all you can get?    Then take the goddamn thing you bastard.    I mean it’s not like your first car is gonna be a Ferrari”.    I can’t even drive yet and I really want a Mini Cooper.    Well I’m pretty sure I’m not gonna get it, I’m pretty sure I wont get a car at all.    If I do…It’s gonna    be something given to me that’s a million years old.    I wont care…I’ll have a car.    So any way I was saying that people need to see the good side of things.    I wanted a gumball, but since it was white I didn’t eat it.    I should have just shrugged my shoulders and ate it.    You can’t even tell the color once you put it in your mouth.

      i had to go to a funeral today for a person that i didn't even know.  but thats ok, i got to see some relatives that i havn't seen in forever, or even ever!  but during the service the preist was talking about how death is stalking us, and we never know when he is going to strike.  my first thought was,"man i feel bad for my great aunt" cause she is scared cause she is now the oldest in the family. my second thought was, "this guy is an idiot! death doesn't stalk you, death is inevitable!"  so the whole service i disagreed with every thing he said.  then after a while i had a very ingenius idea.  ok you know those spray bottles with the fans on them?  well what if you sold those with holy water in them!!!! that would be awsome!!!  and then on the bottle it would say "HOLY SPRITZER"  hehehehehe. i think it's funny.  ok my last thought.  my last thought is sorta like a double single thought if you know what i mean.  ok there was a couple who wrote a poem about God.  well first of all this is not God's funeral, so shouldn't the poem be about the deceast, second, these people are very smart people so they decided to use very big words in this poem.  the words were so big the didn't work with the rhyme scheme, and the meter of the poem, it was a little embarasing.  plus these people were no actors.  well those are my random thoughts! YEAH!!!!!

      I’ve changed my mind.  I don’t want to be like Howard Stern anymore.  I wanna be like George Carlin.  If you’ve ever listened to George Carlin you would know that he can be very rude, politically incorrect, offensive…but truthful.  Most people don’t care if you’re an ass just so long as you are truthful.  That’s all I wanna be.  I just wanna show people what’s going on in our society.  If it means that I have to call a few people a motherfucker, than so be it.  I wanna prove points.  I wanna make people think.  I wanna make people realize what kind of a fucked up world we live in.  Every one wants to control one another; everyone thinks they’re right…when most of the time they are wrong.  I wanna be an ass.  People tend to recognize the assholes more than the good people.  When they find out about someone who has done something good they say, “Hey did you hear about the guy who cured AIDS,” the other guy says “yeah that’s pretty cool…you wanna go have some lunch?”  And they never talk about him again.  But when there is an asshole people get pumped full of energy.  People get angry and argue with one another.  They begin debating the things that the person has talked about.  Look at George W. Bush.  He is probably the worlds biggest, asshole/idiot in the world right now.  He has made so many mistakes.  People don’t just say “HEY…THIS GUYS AN ASSHOLE…what’s for dinner?”  People don’t do that.  They talk about assholes.  They talk about what the asshole has done wrong, and how they think they could fix it.  They begin to think about what they could do to make the world a better place.  You don’t think about something that has been done right, because all the thinking has already been done.  It would be just pointless.  I mean you can’t argue a good thing.  I mean you couldn’t argue a cure to aids, you couldn’t say, “Damn, now all those fuckers in Africa are gonna live!”  I mean you just don’t say those things, its just wrong.  But now if a president said that, that would get people thinking.  It would people thinking about what an asshole our president is, and it would be an endless cycle.

      you all know those commercials for sixflags with the dancing old guy right?  some say he is old.  some say he's young.  some say he's a dude, some say he's a she(dun dun dun).  some say he's white, some say he's black.  what is the truth behind this mysterious "Mr." Six.  well i have startling news!  my inside informant (who goes under the alias of Swizzlestixs) recently "won" a contest to "escort" "Mr." Six around the park for the day.  through out this day she discovered that Mr. Six is defenatly a Mr. who happens to be 23...  So yes Mr. Six is defenatly a he, but he is not old.  all suspicians are covered except for...dun dun dun...race.  you can't really tell through the thick make-up jowls he has, but as her day progressed, his make-up began to wear off.  it soon became clear, Mr. Six is indeed, BROTHA SIX.  i should have know that a white person could not dance that well.  not even a chinesse person could do that.  oh well.

      i just went out and saw i robot. it was a very good film. it kept my attention, it hap actoin, and brains. but most importantly it made me think. it didn't make me think about how the movie was gonna end, it made me think about our society. if you think about it all science fiction novel's, or movies are just a way of showing us how we are as a human race. in i robot the robots are constantly trying to conquer every lower power just like us. most countries like to believe that their country is the most powerful country of them all, just like the robots. our american leaders, ever since we became a country, thought it was nesicary to take controll over, what we thought, lesser people or countries. we did this with the slaves, the Indians, the list goes on. now since the turn of the last centry our country has tried to take over the world through democracy. and once hitler started trying to do what we wanted to do, in a harsher way, we got pissed off and bombed the shit out of japan. this is what sci-fi is sapose to do. make us think. make us realize what is going on in our own lives. make us realize that there are other out looks on our lives. not everyone has a, so called, perfect life. there are people who have no homes, who live in cardboard boxes. i think they have the best outlook on what our world is like. they see everything above them cause there is nothing below them. the people at the top don't care about the people at the bottom. they just know that the people lower than them are in the way and they must be removed. i don't know how to end this so i will end it with...  THINK.

      i am a HUGE fan of jazz.  jaz just takes away your soul, shakes it up a bit, and gives it back to you energized.  i don't know if that makes any sense to you or not, but i like it.  but any way, i'm a fan of jazz, and i even play string bass in a jazz combo.  and you should check out this guy Jamie Cullum.  he is the jazz artist of today.  it's sort of a miz between pop and your basic jazz, I LOVE IT!!!!!!  anyway you should check out his new album Twentysomething.  its pretty awsome.  urlLink VH1.com : Jamie Cullum : Artist Main

         I wanna be the next Howard Stern.    I don’t know why I just wanna be the next one.    I think it would be cool.    He says anything he wants, any time he wants.    He has no mercy, and he is fucking hilarious.    I saw his biography of a movie, and it was pretty interesting.    He started with nothing, to having naked people on the air.    He went from a loser with a white mans fro to a pimp with long hair and John Lennon glasses.    He is the American dream right there.     When I was in Florida I was eating at a Ponderosa.    After I gave the waiter my order, he took one look at me and said with this thick Jamaican accent, “Ya kno, you gotta deep voice.    You gonna be the nex Howard Stern.”    My mom had a look of shock.    My dad laughed.    My brother was confused.    I just said thank you and laughed.    I think that waiter is on to something.     A lot of the people I know, and a lot of the people I don’t know are always saying I’m gonna be famous.    They don’t know how I’m gonna become famous but they just know I will be.    The other day a hair stylist (not the one who fucked up my hair, but same place) said to my mom in a Chinese accent, “yo son es goin to be famous.    He goin be presiden someday.”    I said I’d rather be an actor and she said, “ yeah yo right.    You look like you could be nex Brad Pit.”    I took the compliment and left.    Also…people always call me by my last name, or by my full name.    I asked them why they do that, and they say it’s because I know your gonna be famous, and when people talk about famous people they always use their full name or last name.     I think I just have wishful thinking, but it’s fun to wish :)

      WOW i had a great time yesterday.  as you may already know i went to kings island.  it was really really cool!  i was able to go on all of the major rollercoasters(WHICH WERE AWSOME!!!!!)  but my favorite two were BEAST and SON OF BEAST.  Son of beast tho was really tall and is the only wooden rollercoaster to have a loop.  it was really really cool.  and then beast is the worlds longest wooden rollercoaster in the world!!!!  but there were many other rides and roller coasters that were really cool.  i got checked out by a few girls, (even a few guys, i'll tell you later, it was gross, you don't even want to know what they were talking about.)  oh yeah the worst part of the visit, but probably the most fun part was the Beast opperator.  every time people started to load onto the train he would begin, if you going to ride the beast clap your hand(clap clap)  and so on.  then when the train was about to leave the station he would go, let me hear you screan as loud as you can, ready 1..2..3 (SREAMS!!!!)  the first time it was ok, but he did it many more times.  i was getting mad.  then about the fourth time he did it.  when every one was sapose to clap, i yelled really loud, THIS IS LAME.  it probably doesn't sound as funny as it realy was.  i was like freakin out at this guy.  i realy hated him with a passion.  but what was really funny was that the only people who were actually clapping were middleaged women.  so that proves how lame he was.  so anyway.  when i got on the train.  he didn't say the clap your hands thing.  YES I HAD AN IMPACT ON HIM!!!!!!  but then he still asked us to scream.  when the train went by his booth thingy, i SCREAMED at him, many things, nothing to get me kicked out tho.  i was freakin out.  but i was on the ride adn away from him.  the ride was fun, but then we got back to the station.  and guess what, he asked us how our ride was.  i was mad.   i was screaming at him.  then we got off and he started the CLAP YOUR HANDS THING AGAIN!!!!!  I WAS SCREAMING SO MUCH AT THIS GUY!!! I WAS REALLY REALLY MAD.  I WANTED TO JUST RIP HIS HEAD OFF.  MY COUSIN MASON IS JUST LAUGHIN AT ME.  my ranting an raving went on a little longer before we went on a differents ride.  but all in all i had a good time.

      ok i don't know about the other people in the world or the rest of the united states, but it is really cold outside for it too be August.  for the last 3 days, and for the next many days, it is going to be any where between 50 and 70 degrees farenheigt (i can't spell).  but it is really cold.  it hasn't been this cold in august since1889, or something like that.  i fear that this may be the begging of another ice age.  scientists believe that another ice age could happen in the next 20 years.  that mean...DUN DUN DUN...that it is starting now.  don't blam me or the scientists, BLAM GEORGE BUSH AND HIS OIL AND GAS BUDDIES WHO ARE POLUTING ALL OF YOUR AIR!!!!!!!!!!  so vote kerry on this election, for a cleaner, more safer environment....but seriously this is not all about kerry, and bush.  its about us.  i know thats concieded but hey...what else are we gonna do.  i would say its about the earth, but the earth is fine. its just one giant chess board for our lives, every thing is happening to us, not the earth.  really the earth is doing it to us.  it hates us.  in a way earth is GOD.

      well the olypics have started, and i'm still in ohio.  and guess what...I WENT TO KINGS ISLAND AGAIN!!!!!!  it was fun.  this time tho we went to the water park that they have. we didn't stay there very long becasue the water park closed at 7, and it was a really small one, so we got bored easily.  so we got to go on 3 roller coasters and 2 thrill rides.  the thrill rides were so cool!!!!!  ok the first one was called DROP ZONE.  its sorta like giant drop at six flags, BUT SO MUCH COOLER!!!!.  ok it has circular seating and it seats about 40 people.  it begins to slowly spin so you get the see the entire park.  then it begins to rise slowly.  after about 150 feet it begins to pick up speed.  then after 165 more feet you have reached the top.  yes thats right this is 315 ft high making it the world tallest gyro drop in the world, and 100ft taller than giant drop, 100 ft taller than raggin bull.  you begin to spend some time spining slowly at the top, and it eventually wirrrs to a stop.  you wait for a moment.  then out of no were you drop.(i was proud of myself, i did no hands :) this things goes so fast that it takes the breath out of you.  i was gonna yell WOOOOOOOO!!!!!! when it dropped, but all i got to was Wo-- .  this ride was CraZy.  but it wasn't worth the wait.  then the other ride was dylerium.  it was worth the wait but its hard to explain.  so i guess you'll have to come and see it, or check out the web site.   urlLink Paramounts Kings Island!
