      Take 3 or more negative patterns you've identifies and ask yourself the follow questions:  Negative Pattern: Overly ambitious expectations and blaming myself or internalizing when things don't go as I believe they should.  1. In detail, articulate the negative pattern.  What I do, in any aspect of daily life is I set expectations of the way things SHOULD be. I play movies in my head, I fantasize, I create dream of how I think things will go, which is basically how I want them to go. Because these ideations aren't very realistic, I get extremely dissapointed when things don't go the way I think they should. In turn, I believe that somehow it's my fault that they didn't. But not because of something I did, because of something I AM NOT. So if I don't meet a guy at a bar it's because, I am not pretty enough. If I don't get into grad school, I'm not smart enough.   2.  Break down the negative pattern. How and when does it occur?  When things don't go the way I think they should.  I would have to say that this pattern is primarily manifested when dealing with guys. For some reason my expectations of guys are always pretty high. And when things don't happen, because they usually don't, I beat myself up because I'm not cute, I'm not skinny, I'm not blonde, I'm not fun or whatever.  3.  How and when did the pattern start?  I'm not sure. But I really can't remember feeling like this so much before college. I remember having thoughts like this but not so extreme, where in every situation I feel inadequate.  I think it primarily stems from being in my sorority and getting the overwhelming sense that we were never good enough. That my life and existence wasn't as important as if I was a Kappa or a pi Phi or a DG. My fears of being too fat, not blonde, or whatever are mirror images of everything those girls were, pretty, thin, blonde, rich. Though I had friends just like that in high school, and though I may not have felt as cute as Melisa Buiges, or as fun as Brooke Clapper or Rachel Quisenberry or Monique Morgan, nobody ever made me feel worthless because I wasn't like them. At SC, I was made to feel worthless about who I was.  4. What feelings does the pattern bring on?  Depression. A sense of worthlessness and hopelessness. That I am worth nothing and I will never get anywhere because I have these fundamental flaws that nobody will ever be able to look past.   5.  What effect does your pattern have on others?  Well, the low self-esteem probably turns most guys away. I think I may come off as needy once you get past the original conversations. I constantly need people to reassure me and tell me that I am worth something. That even though things didn't play out like I thought they should, it isn't because I am not enough.  6.  What effect does your pattern have on you?  It increases my depression. It prevents me from living in the moment because I'm steadily trying to plan out how I can be great in the future. Short term it makes me not have fun when I'm out, it maybe makes my friends annoyed at me sometimes. In the long term I can see this pattern completely alienating me from people. It will be destructive to any intimate relationship. And it will continue to set me up for failure and increase depression.  7.  How do you see yourself breaking of moving away from the negative pattern?   a. I've got to start living in the moment and enjoying things for what they are. I should be able to enjoy phone calls and first dates without working myself into a frenzy about whether or not I am good enough for him to want me to be his girlfriend. Enjoy parties and hanging out with friends even if no guy comes up to me.  Enjoy meeting people and good conversation even if they don't ask for my number.  b.  I've got to learn look at things objectively and realize that just because I can't change things doesn't mean that changing something about me would make things better or right. If I were "prettier" it doesn't ensure that I would have more guys chasing me. Same thing goes if I were thinner, white, blonde, shorter, younger or whatever.

      Beginning the process of reflection:  1. What changes do I want to make in my life?           - I want to become emotionally stable           - I want to become financially stable           - I would like to have a higher self-esteem and more             self-confidence           - I want to find better ways to deal with my              depression instead of turning to food and alcohol           - I want to be less impulsive in matters of the              heart  2.  What would I like to do that I am not currently doing?           - travel           - learn to play the guitar  3.  What risks am I willing to take to achieve my goals?        I am not sure how to answer this question. What risks? The reason I can't travel is because of money. I would have to not ever pay any bills to save enough money and then my life would be a disaster!         I guess for the life changes, I am willing to risk feeling insecure.   4.  What challenges am I willing to face?        My own insecurity. I think I do a lot of things to give me control and to prevent me from feeling lost. My biggest challenge to emotional stability is identifying why I feel uncomfortable in certain situations and work to conquer that fear.      Another challenge is this "I have to have it NOW" problem. This problem is pretty prevalent in my relationships. Somehow I've got to learn to control the impulsive behavior.  5.  Who are my role models?        Don't have any. Should probably get some.  6.  Who is standing in the way of my making the changes I need to be happier?     Pretty much me. I think all of the changes I need to make are going to begin with me.     I do think that my environment is kind of preventing me from some of the changes. I am very settled with friends here, who no longer challenge me in the ways I need to grow as a person. So I need to drop friends that I don't see aiding the process, and further cultivate the meaningful relationships.

      Use the triggers as a starting point to identify any patterns that may exist in your triggers or your reactions to events.  Write down specific instances where you enountered a trigger event that created a goal, regardless of the outcome.  1.  Trigger: Breaking up with Bill  Goal: Become more confident in myself, not let boys try to determine my self worth  Action: Try to monitor my negative thoughts - are they rational or irrational? Try to not act on irrational thoughts and ideas and not use unsuccessful relationships or encounters as evidence of how worthless I am.  Result:  I am much more aware of certain thoughts and feeling as irrational, but I haven't been able to stop jumping to the conclusions that enable them.  I am still using guys as a measure of self-worth.   2.  Trigger:  Drinking by myself.  Goal:  To become more friendly and accessible so that I don't feel so alone. To build friendships and relationships to relieve so of the autonomy I feel.  Action:  Actively call friends and keep in contact with people, share my feelings when they ask and stop trying to maintain my "persona."  Result: Much closer with Jenni and Jaclyn. Drink by myself less than I used to and don't feel the need to get wasted to numb the pain as much as usual. Still do a lot of reflecting and moping by myself but I am now much more likely to call a friend and chit chat or share my feelings with others.  3.   Trigger: Nannie's death.  Goal: To be able to cope with my fears, problems, without needing to escape.  Action: Start trying to identify my fears and problems and the reasons and causes behind them.  Result:  I've taken a more active stance into trying to find ways to deal with my emotions. I'm much more inquisitive about why I feel things, how I came to feel that way and how I can avoid or deal with those feelings. still a lot of work to go!

      List 3 specific triggers that led you to want to change:  1.  Breaking up with Bill.     Basically, falling in love with Bill, thinking he was the one and to have him dump me. No questions asked. Because my behavior was so out of line and so horrendous he couldn't bear to be with me.  2.  Drinking by myself.     Though I still do it, it disgusts me that I am ever in a position where I feel so low and down about myself the only thing I can do is sit by myself and get wasted while listening to depressing music and writing about how lonely I am.  3.  Nannie's death.     When Nannie died I think I really felt alone in the world. If I had a problem or needed somewhere to go, I could always escape by going to Nannie's house. Once she was gone, there was nowhere for me to turn to.

      A. Now look for patterns in your personal annd professional life.  1.  Do your relationships usually dissapoint you? With guys, yes. Almost all of my romantic relationships have dissapointed me in some way or another.  My friendships tend to dissapoint me at first, but then seem to turn around for the most part.  2. Do you tend to leave jobs, relationships, clients, and entreprenurial ventures or do you stay too long, without getting a promotion, significan raise, or satisfaction? This one is a bit hard. I wouldn't say that I "leave too soon" but rather, I expect results pretty fast. I expect to be happy or occupied or satisfied immediately. If not, then I either a)leave or  b) make myself so unhappy that it makes others around me unhappy and in the case of relationships, they dump me.  3. When you don't achieve personal goals, do you tent to blame others? Blame yourself? Blame luck? I would say about 99.9 % of the time I blame myself. I'm not ________ enough. I should have done this, or if I'd have done that it would have been better.  B. After exploring the info. in this excercise, what do you see as the problems, obstacles, or patterns that, if solved, would create a "life changing" event in your life?  1. I expect others and external things around me to make me happy. I look to people and situations and put my entire faith in them to make me feel happy, worthwhile, pretty, useful or whatever. 2. If I don't immediately get the reinforcement that I need from people and situations to make me feel however, I immediately assume that I'm not [insert adjective here] and then continue the cycle of needing someone to tell me that I am so that I can believe it. 3. I need things to happen NOW. I can't wait to see how things might play out. I assume if things don't go how I think they should go the moment I think they should, they will never help me or make me happy or give me what I need.   C.  Ask penetrating questions to analyze your answers.  1. What is it that I don't yet understand? I guess I don't understand how I came to think about myself in such a negative light. How I began to let others determine my self-worth. Also I don't understand how I can stop it. 2. What is it that I'm not seeing about the situation?  What is my behavior that lends itself to creating situations where my expectations can't be fulfilled.

      Review the most five significant relationships you've had in your life, by category:   Friends (Jenni Perry)  1.  Are you still in the relationship? Yes 2.  How has the realationship changed over the years, if at     all?     -At first we were just friends all about going out. I met Jenni at a transition time in my life, when I was graduating high school and going to college.  Jenni was a friend in Rancho that I could bring back my "new" college persona too and kind of try it out in the non-USC world. In high school, I never really "went out" but this was Jenni's area of expertise. So initally, our relationship was only about just going out and stuff like that.    More recently (although, in progress over the years) we've begun talking about things. Life, love, feelings, everday things. But things other than just about what's going on, what we're going to do or what not. I feel like I can tell her things, vent my emotions, seek her advice.  3.  What are or were the specific problems in the relationship?    - I'd say first and foremost the reason we probably weren't closer earlier is because of the distance. I never really was friends with Jenni and lived in Rancho for a substantial amount of time. I met her just as I was moving to USC, and we've mostly managed to be friends on my summer and winter vacations, and weekends spent at home.     Next, the fact that Jenni already had a super tight knit of best friends when I met her. Unlike me, she didn't need anyone in the friendship way. She already had best friends, and they were, REALLY tight.    Now I would say, though not a huge problem, Jenni is now a mom and is at a completely different stage in her life. She's not worried about the same petty problems that I am, she's got a son to look after.   4.  What are or were the specific positive aspects of the relationship?    With Jenni I've learned to tell people my feelings, that people do actually care about me. That friendsthip is possible! Jenni is a fresh alternative to my friends from college. She's level-headed and presents an interesting perspective of the world. Through her I've met people I never thought I would hang out with or even know, tried things I never thought I'd try and just been in a lot of cool and interesting situations. I guess the one big thing is that she has fueld my open-mindedness and quest for knowledge and what it's like to walk in other's shoes.  Boyfriends (Bill McCoy)  1.  Are still in the relationship?  No 2.  How has the relationship changed over the years? N/A 3.  What or were the specific problems in the relationship?     Primarily the problem was that we were both looking for different things from a relationship.  The timing was all wrong. 4.  What were the specific positive aspects of the relationship?     We had fun together. We had great intellectual talks.  He made me feel wanted and pretty and worthy.  5.  If the relationship ended, why? Be specific.    I was upset that he didn't want to commit to me. That he didn't want to call me his girlfriend. After being together for almost 4 months this really made me upset. But rather than communicate this or even just deal with this on my own, I pretended it didn't matter.  So I got drunk with some friends, and made a scene at a bar while we were hanging out. I was really embarassing. When we went back to his apartment I said some really mean and hurtful things to him because I wanted him to feel the pain that he'd inflicted on me.  I just didn't care. He ended it with me saying that he couldn't handle that kind of drama in his life. He found it completely unattractive and wanted nothing to do with me ever.  Coworkers (Julie Moffitt)  1.  Are you still in the relationship?  Yes, even though Julie no longer works with me. 2.  How has the relationship changes over the years? Obviously from being strictly working together, to hanging out outside of work, sharing secrets, dreams and fears, to still communicating even though she's now in Wisconsin. 3.  What are or were the specific problems in the relationship? Julie is caught up in her own story, as most of us are. I think that the only problem is that she's really focused on herself, and what's going on with her. This makes it hard to build a strong foundation for a friendship. 4.  What are or were the specific positive aspects of the relationship? This! Julie's aura causes me to become self-aware, becuase I've never known a person as self-acutalized as she is. The positive part of the relationship is that i have someone who I identify with on a spiritual level. Someone else who can share my utter confusion with life and mankind. Someone else who searches out the mysterious answers to life's questions, someone else who even poses those questions to begin with. Someone who I can share the creative side of myself with and feel unashamed. A relationship that is pretty much free from judgement, that's just honest.

Losing 12 pounds (so far!) 5.  Taking risks to follow my dreams   Make a list of early goals, including things you wished for as a child. Next to each of these goals put an "A" next to those you've achieved and a "P" next to the ones that are still pending or in progress.  1.  To be rich and live comfortably  (P) 2.  To find my true love and get married (P) 3.  To be famous        4.  To have kids   (P) 5.  To go to college (A) 6.  To write a book (P) 7.  To make music videos 8.  To save the world (P)  Write down every job you've had and state the reason you left or were asked to leave.  The Icing:  I left because I was miserable and unhappy there. I did not like going to work and it made me sick and uncomfortable every time I had to go. I didn't like the people that worked there. I felt like I was inadequate somehow, like I couldn't do things as well as they wanted me to.  I was paranoid that the people didn't like me.  Edwards Cinema:  I left because I was starting college. Went back the next summer and left again because it was only a summer job, I was going back to school.  Office of Licesnsing and Technology:  Left because it was boring and repetitive. And I guess I was kind of lazy. In college none of my friends had to work and the work ethic left me. It was out of the way and I was tired and I just didn't feel like going I guess.  Hot Dog on a Stick: I left because I got in a fight with a manager. However, this was brought on because I never really felt comfortable there. Felt like I didn't really belong. I guess I had the same feelings there that I did at the Icing. Like I couldn't do the job right or I couldn't perform as well as I was expected to.  Also felt like the people here didn't like me. I figured it was just a winter break job so it really didn't matter.  Applebee's:  Only a summer and break job, left when school started again.  The Gap:  I left because I was moving home for winter break and because I was still on probabtion (I'd worked there less than three months) i couldn't take a leave of absence. I guess I could have maybe stayed at Nannie's but maybe I didn't want to work there bad enough even though I liked it.  Greek Escape:  There was really no use for me there.  I never really had any responsibility and no set schedule. It was like I was just kind of taking up space.  I felt like for the minimum wage I was just kind of wasting my time. Like I didn't matter at all.  Douglas Cohn & Wolfe:  I didn't like the work I was doing. I didn't like the fact that I had to work weekends and pitch to strangers and that I worked 12 hour days and was always under the stress of deadlines.  My work environment was driving me insane and I started to resent everyone and everything around me.  Wells Fargo: Felt incompetent like I could never do anything right. Also felt like the people didn't like me. Ultimately left because I started working full time at USC, was getting ready to move and wanted my Saturdays free again.

      Write down five negative patterns of behavior that you see in your mother:  1. Low self-esteem (i.e. I'm too stupid, I'm too dumb, Esther why are you so dumb?)  2. Agumentative, always on the defense with others and the world around  3. Poor financial and saving skills - dependence on credit cards  4. Unhealthy amount of self-reliance, not asking or depending on anyone and remaining completely autonomous (i.e. I shouldn't and won't have to answer to anyone else, my way or the highway type behavior)  5. Eating or buying things to fill emotional voids  Write down five negative patterns of behavior you see in your father:  Well.. I don't remember my father but this is what I think I can grasp  1. Using alcohol as a coping mechanism 2. Escaping problems rather than facing them to work them out  List the five most influential of their negative pattersn that you are most likely to duplicate or have duplicated:  1. Low-self esteem and extremely self-critical 2. Poor financial planning and money-management skills 3. Using alcohol as a coping mechanism 4. Escape and denial of problems 5. Self-imposed autonomy

      What is it about me that make dirty old men want to talk to me? Really. So I joined Yahoo personals because I was thinking, wow, a new way to meet people. Yes the whole match.com thing was a disaster but I'm really at my wits end with meeting guys. So i've been a member maybe a week now and I swear no one under 30 has replied to my profile. ok, maybe 2 ppl but still. I don't want to be some gross nearing-middle aged man's sweet young fantasy thing!!! Is it too much to ask to meet a normal, decent  guy who's my age? Saw Tom last night but he got kicked out of the bar before he could see how hot I looked. He threw a beer at Angela Griffith because she wacked him in the head for hanging out with her ex-friend Kelly. Oh the famous kelly. Yes, can you beleive that he drives all the way out Arcadia to hang out with her? it makes me want to throw up. Really. I need to see this chic. I'm hoping she's some super hottie. Apparently she's a tweaker. Now I'm starting to see a pattern...Angela would do oxycotton with them and then this chic is a tweaker. so he only likes strung out chics. K i guess i really don't fit that mold. I think? I'm getting over him. Okay so that's a lie but it's something I need to keep telling myself to stay sane.

      And all I Need to know  Is that I'm somethin you'll be missing....  The truth is you could slit my throat  And with my one last gasping breath  I'd apologize for bleedin on your shirt   If I'm just bad news, then you're a liar.....  - "You're So Last Summer" - Taking Back Sunday  I am so in love with Tom it makes me want to puke. How do I let him get to me? It seems like as soon as I hit the freeway exit i'm thinking about him.  I haven't even seen him yet since I've been home but all I can think about is him. We went to McAlan's last night and everyone was there but he wasn't. I know he's trying to do the whole no drinking no drugs thing, and I'm so proud of him, but it hurts not seeing him. And I guess knowing that he's probably with someone else. We were just standing there looking at the dance floor and Melissa's like, "oh, there's kelly, tom's girlfriend." And like quick as a whip I'm like "She's NOT Tom's girlfriend." Why do I give a flying fuck if people are saying that Kelly is Tom's girlfriend?  I guess I just can't understand why I'm  not good enough for him. I feel like he's my soulmate...we've talked about everything under the sun. I feel like he's told me stuff he's never told anyone, about his adoption, about his sister, about his hopes and dreams...I don't know. I just feel like I've bared my soul to this boy but it doesn't seem to matter. I would do anything for Tom. It hurt so much when we were in Newport for memorial day and he got in jail, and when he got home he was all about Angela. Granted she was his girlfriend at the time but he had just slept with me two weeks before when they were broken up. I know that I let myself be taken in by him but each time I feel like it's going to be different. Like he really likes me this time and my heart's not going to be broken. Again. And last week when we were talking about Angela and he said "I love her but we just can't be together," I felt like SHIT that he loves Angela. And I felt like SHIT because he told me that he loves Angela. Why? What is so special about that crackheaded 7th grade teacher? She's not cute, she's not nice, and she's a psychopath. Ok, so she's nice but I don't understand what it is about her that he loves.  And when I asked him what he thought about me.... what was that about? K so I was drunk...but what was that "your a cool girl, what do you want me to say?" crap? I know he means well but... I really don't know what I want from him. I know he can't provide anything for me that I need. He doesn't even have a job right now. He has his GED. He's in rehab (?). He might be going to jail for his third felony. He's psychotic. I know that I won't be happy with him in the long run. I guess I was just so stricken by his attention at first. I mean here is the guy that every chic wants to get with and he (was) into me! And I got to be the one calling the shots and it felt good to be wanted. And after seeing what I feel to be the "real him" I was so taken by him. About everything that he thought and said. Everytime I think that I'm over him I realize I'm not.  I feel so pathetic. Everyone knows how I feel and it's just gross. I feel like I'm being pittied. Like that girl who gets "emotionally attached" to a guy she's not with. Well hell yeah I'm emotionally attactched. I told Tom things i would NEVER tell a guy. Period. I feel like he's seen me exposed. I don't like sharing about myself.... And it's just gross that everyone knows we slept together but they don't know anything else. Like last night, Sam is like, "yeah, Tom said everything was awesome...blah, blah......" So I'm a good fuck. I know that already. How come he doesn't tell them about the talks until 5 in the morning? Or how he cried when he told me about his sister dying? Or how pissed that his real mom could give a shit about him? Or that he's not at all happy with his life and he wants to make it better but just doesn't know where to begin? Or how he can tell me anything and he loves just being with me? Maybe if I find someone new I can get past this unhealthy obsession with him. It's clearly not getting me anywhere. I just can't believe that he has no feelings for me whatsoever. I refuse to beleive it.  My hopes are so high That your kiss might kill me So won't you kill me? So I die happy My heart is yours to fill or burst To break or bury Or wear as jewelry Whichever you prefer  Hands down This is the best day I can ever remember I'll always remember The sound of the stereo The dim of the soft light The scent of your hair That you twirled in your fingers And the time on the clock When we realized it was so late And this walk that we share together And the streets were wet And the gate was locked So I jumped it and let you in And you stood at your door  With your hands on my waist And you kissed me like you MEANT it and I knew  that you MEANT it......  - "Hands Down" - Dashboard Confessional

      My life is all here....  I have my opinions and I try to stick to them Call them childish if you want But I guess the concept of that  Depends on who sets the norm And if submitting to the expectations  of my surroundings means growing up I'll try wholeheartedly to refuse And I hope you're wrong When you say I'm acting like a kid And one day I'll grow out of it  There's truly a difference of what we define as significant matters But isn't it funny how everything  that's important to me is trivial to you? And it's hard not to notice When you express your self so explicity With harsh words and pleasantries To ridicule me  You can say whatever You might have to say about me But that doesn't mean that I have got to give a shit.  -"Whatever" - Satanic Surfers

      "I truly believe we are all brothers under the skin. I for one would be willing to skin all of humanity to prove it." -Ellsworth Toohey in The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand  So dig a little deeper, listen a little closer to the beating of the drum in my heart. What's there between the lies and black heartache? Hell if I know. What do you do when you've become a carbon copy of a xerox of a person you wish you could be? I feel like I've spent so much time in creating my "ideal persona" of myself that it's hard to tell if that's really who I am. I really don't believe there is a true me, or a true anyone for that matter. We shape, we bend, we pretend, we fold, we create ourselves to be this jagged reflection of the world around us. Which, by the way, is not that pretty. Am I a product of some traumatic childhood experience? I don't think so. But of course I could have blocked that out, right pop psych?  I can't handle the feelings. They are too much for me to bear  .  This guy and I were talking about the ultimate anti-drug - alcohol - and how it just lowers your inhibitions for your true self to come out. So I started thinking about how I am a severely bipolar/schizo drunk. You can really never tell what I am going to be feeling or how I am going to react. What does that say about me pop psych? And anyway, where did this 20th, overflowing into the 21st century, western civilization need to analyze ourselves come from?  as I sift through the welbutrin and trazadone in my medicine cabinet, I wonder just how much I'll need to take to asphyxiate the void within.    Tell me what you want from me Cuz I don't know exactly what you want me to be now There's no place left for me to go now So why don't you come kick me around for awhile?  Down here you won't see me crying Ain't got no time for that I'll find a million ways to sacrifice myself It seems like everytime I try to gain a little ground I end up right back where I never thought I'd be.  Down here it feels alright Plenty of time To find another way of self-destruction The only way I know how to...  Maybe another time Maybe another day I'll be strong enough to leave this place behind me Like a clown I raise my glass to the sky Toast another night serenade my reflection  Down here it feels alright Plenty of time To find another way to seize the day Without the bottle of redemption  So tonight I'll stumble my way home Maybe tomorrow I'll find myself a job But tonight I've got the moon and the stars Got a song in my head and a pocket full of nothing  Well I've got no plans  I've got no peace of mind I've got to find away out of here Took a little more than I gave away Time for me to get up and try to get it right....  -"Wrong Side of the Tracks" - Strung Out

You know that one split second where you're like, "Hell yeah! I love my life!" K, yeah, so those don't come very often. I was just thinking about my friendster page and the super cute thing Jaclyn posted in her testimonial about me. It made me think that I really have gotten to the point where i've weeded out the bullshit and have some really dope friends.

      What would Auldous Huxley Do? By me  What a world it is Crisp, glittering, glistening From the pores in my eyes these tears run from bittersween blue rays of hope.  One tall among others beggin to be important.  Screaming in the somber, soothing night surrounded by ignorance wearing arrogance.  Palm trees sway in the cool breeze Water flows to wash away sins Be still  "Heaven doesn't exist," he said. "Or heaven for that matter." But he forgot to tell everyone.  So still we kneel on wounded knee. Hoping, hunting, scraping through the random grouping of atoms we feel the need to call life.  -------------------------------------------  A Song for the Masses by me  Wonder Gazing directly at melancholy and the infinite sadness Meaningless Hopelss  The buzz of the busy, busy worker bees Happily churning their honey to keep them fed and sedated.  The ones who know are quietly seated at the right hand of the father. Whose finger dangles above the button of eternity, threatening to call of this whole operation  we call NOW  But maybe he'll let us play a little longer if we pray to saints and porecelain gods After all, there's always more honey to be made. -----------------------------------------------  Phone Survey by me  Penny for your thoughts? So I can sell them to the thought collector Who can manufacture them for the whole world in a matter of minutes and sell them to you for your soul. A mark up for shipping and handling, of course. --------------------------------- BFF by me  Hello there, good friend! It feels as if you just left. But, so quickly you've returned to soothe me, to confuse me, to make me weak. Why can't it be different this time?  Each time I close the door behing you The wind blows it open and you back in with it. Right back into my life. Wrapping your cold arms around me, pressing your essence into the depths of my soul.  What would it be like to wake each morning without you snuggled close beside me in my bed? Breathing deeply Smiling sweetly Knowing, once again, job well done.  Well, maybe tomorrow you'll leave me for another Like all the others before you and I'll finally find the way back to me.

      You're so good at closing old doors and opening new ones... have you found your doorstep yet?                                                                                    - Jeanine Moffit, a mother  Eerily my life is begining to feel like that one Star Trek episode (k - the only one I've ever seen) where they keep going through this time warp where the same day keeps repeating over and over and over... And the kicker is that they find out they've been going though this black hole for 80 years!  Why is humanity such a waste? Why do we repeat the same pointless actions over and over and over and over...? Each day I get up, go to work, sing some songs, fret about the future, go to bed and do the same thing all over again. I think i need something new in my life. I really thought that by changing jobs it would open this whole new world for me. And I guess, to an extent it has...but i'm still feeling the same empty void that I felt before. I meet tons of people all the time, i'm surrounded by kick ass friends, but yet i still feel lonely. I guess I mean I don't feel as if anyone GETS me or IT. I feel like everyone else got their revised scripts before the cameras started rolling but I didn't. I feel like I'm living life in "radio edit" mode, not feeling and thinking and sharing everything that I want.  I guess its time to think about what I REALLY want. What would make me REALLY happy? I guess I just want someone to not look at me like I'm different, like my thoughts and feelings are an anomaly of society. Someone who just can understand why I burst into tears when I see a homeless man, or why socialized medicine is the way to go. Someone who can hear the guitar and base in a song melt together and when I say "That's how I want my life to be," they KNOW what I'm feeling and they want it that way too....  Do you like dreaming of things so impossible, or only the practical, or ever the wild? Or waiting through all your bad, bad days Just to end them with Someone you care about Or do you like making out? long drives, brown eyes, and guys who just don't quite fit in...  - "So Impossible" - Dashboard Confessionals

      Winter Ballad by me  Outdoors the wind is blowing through the winter leaves, which fall dead to the ground circling the fipe flesh of ozone  outside my window  Like so many before you  I watch you walk out of my life No trace of your existence  except the marks from the tears that roll down my face and the bruise on my heart  Sweet whispers of silence come visit - penetrate through these fortuitous thoughts that will never see the light I need to know it isn't me this time I need to feel like I can control it  But I can't. So why bother?

      The Bridge by me  It's so high up here But why can't I see? the pain hides newfound secrets of wisdom beautiful blinding rays of promise cover my eyes  It's so cold out here But why can't I feel? the metallic sounds crash about me obscuring sanity and solace  But then silence falls around me Creating a soft, comforting blanket of hope How sweet this cool drink of oblivion tastes on my lips Pouring down, down, down Good night boys and girl For this nightmare must come to an end

      "Yesterday, today, and tomorrow are all different names for the same illusion."                                       - Jose Saramago, The Gospel According to Jesus Christ  "Tomorrow never comes, man. It's all one long fucking day."                                       - Janis Joplin, wasted at some concert in 1968   As the illusion of this thing called life begins to crumble around my feet, I am really starting to questions everthing I know. Lately I feel as if I have been in a heroin-hazed dream, stumbling though one door to the next, but never truly finding my path. What do I want in life? Hell, first I need to figure out what this thing "life," as you like to call it, is supposed to be.   Everyone starts reflecting this time of year. The whole New Year's resolution has never really been my thing but this year I might just give it a chance. Someone I know said that if you really want to change something about yourself, you will do it any time of the year. Apparently she never had that monkey 'procrastination' on her back. I think New Year's resolutions were created specifically for people like me. People who want to change, really, really, want it - but just can't motivate to do it. It's kinda like when you're watching tv and you have to go to the bathroom but you're just too lazy to walk the 22 steps to the potty. It's so close, but yet so far away. So this year I'm going to be ready. I'm starting now, like 3 weeks in advance and I'm going to come up with a plan to make 2004 not suck.  I'll keep you posted.

      Lab Rats   Stranger things have happened  Is not the motto I would choose for my life  But yet that's what everone tells me  When I try to form the words to explain  this illusion I live in   Did you ever wonder  If the hitchikers guide was right?  Maybe  We are just lab rats  Running our maze  Pressing the lever  over and over and over and over  eagerly awaiting the tiny food pellets of  love, life, liberty, happiness  which are doled out to us  one at a time  or not at all  depends if you're a control rat or not.

      "Today I changed, but everyone stayed the same."  -"Stuck in America"- Sugarcult  A weekend full of carnage. Of falling off barstools and walking barefoot down Sunset. Ah yes sports fans, it looks like I am up to my old tricks again - seeking reinforcement for my self-worth from others and drowning myself in a liquid oblivion when my expectations aren't met. O-well. Shit happens. Everyone falls off the wagon sometimes.  At the bitches' brunch on Sunday we did lists of things that we were throwing out from 2003 and our intentions for 2004. I wanted to post those here as well, where they will confront me everyday, leering and jeering like that annoying Smart and Final kid.  So here we go....  For 2003 we burned:  1. feeling like when relationships end it's always my fault 2. letting guys determine my self-worth and/or feeling worthless 3. low self-esteem 4. financial instability 5. hopelessness about my life 6. feeling not good enough/smart enough/pretty/enough/"insert any descriptor here" enough  For 2004, this is what's HAPPENING:  1. finding love. Just love period. Finding love for myself - reasons that I love being me, things I wouldn't change about me. Being comforatble and confident in my own skin so that I can share my talents with others. Finding and recognizing my talents. Finding love in another. Finding that deep passion that is shared in mind, body and soul. Love that transcends infatuation; built on the ability to be real, open, honest, loving, vulnerable. Get cajones and let the man in fire know what I feel when I'm with him - and that I am what he's been looking for but never been able to find.  2. becoming financially stable. Getting my shit together. Waking up from my materialistic dream and actually focusing on my future, lowering my stress. I want to be able to save money. I want to not wake up in the middle of the night sobbing, wondering if the police are going to haul me off to jail for debts and bank fraud.  3. get fit, lose weight. Not because i think that boys will like be better. Hell, I'm not fat. I'm perfectly normal. But my eating habits will definitely put me into a early grave. I want to work out and be healthy and stick with it. For my health. my 20's will be gone one day, I dont want flab and clogged arteries to be all I have to show for my rockin decade of decadence.  How am I going to do all this? I don't know. It's going to take some major sweeping of the skeltons to get rid of half the shit that has been screwing up my life for so long. I admire Natascha so much...she seems so happy and vibrant- people glow when they see her come in the room. I'm tired of being the sarcastic comic relief for everyone. My pessimism may win me "funniest friend" awards but it's definitely not helping love myself or allowing anyone to love me.  I'm starting to think seriously about going to Costa Rica. This woman I met at the bitches brunch gave me a contact who i sent an e-mail to today. I keep telling myself, "Well, MAYBE i'll go if this and that" but I realized - I need to make a firm decision to GO. So I'm doing that. Costa Rica will not work around my other plans, I will work my other plans around going to Costa Rica. Okay, well except for grad school because that's happening next fall. But I really mean like staying at the Twin Project because it's comfortable. Or moving back to Rancho and being a waitress at Applebees when my time here is up. 2004 will be a year of changes boys and girls. No Julie, I'm not the person I've always wanted to be, but this year I'm not going to fucking whine about it anymore. This year it's happening. Whether the world is ready for me or not.

      As usual I'm late What's the difference  I see the same faces My attitude is plain Just the same as the vibe in this place is I'm shaking hands and smiling Lying, about where I've been lately The tension's mutiplying And I'm dying to leave....  -"Saturday Night" - Lucky Boys Confusion   Confidence. That makes all the difference. I hung out with Mike last night and this is the word that kept screaming through my skull. He started trying to make his move last night and I just wasn't into him. I kept thinking to myself - this isn't rght. Then I thought, maybe it IS right, I just need to throw out my checklist of what I want in a guy. After all haven't we decided that Tom, Larry, Bill, Owen and countless others along the way have been even more of losers than I am portraying Mike to be? Yes, but the one thing they all had was confidence. Arrogance. The whole "fuck you" attitude. Dealing with Mike is like dealing with a reflection of myself - someone who is unsure and needs me to hold his hand through the dating process to let him know that I like him. Yucky. No wonder I've been single. I know that I let my insecurities get the best of me sometimes but I never truly realized how unattractive this is until I saw this characteristic in someone else. Mike is definitely sweet but I just don't feel anything when I am around him. I'm not attracted to him. I feel kinda bad, as if I've been baiting him this whole time, and now that he has built up the confidence to start "going for it" I'm backing away. This is mean. I am mean.  Onto other things. I am getting an A in biopsych..i am so stoked. I really need to get on the ball with all of my grad school stuff. The time is rapidly approaching and I haven't even begun to study for my GREs. O-well. All things in good time. I miss Julie. I wish she would come back from Hawaii!! It's going to suck when she moves for good. I feel like I've finally found the kind of person I want to really be good friends with, and now she's leaving. Sad times.  Had an awesome dream last night about the love of my life. I want to see him. Haven't in a few weeks. I love the powerful feeling I get around him. It's as close to faith as I've ever gotten. I feel so strongly that he is destined to play a role in my future. Maybe I'm wrong. But I hope not.

      Hollywood and Vine by me  Singing serenely never quite worked for me I like to feel the deep gurgle of my voice Break into a shrill scream Purging the pain and suffering of a lifetime Out into the world To fall hard on silent ears  Out of my window the world looks harsh The night beating the pavement  as the city lights nuture the footprints of lost souls  Whispers can only say so much before they're drowned out by the noise of the walking dead shuffling past each and every one of us only we're too preoccupied with lovers lost and cell phone bills to notice their meager existence  If you stand quietly in the breeze you can feel the breath of innocence wash over you A hot bath, cleansing the tainted lies of humanity Annointing your head with the virtue of oblivion.

      Spinning, laughing, dancing To her favorite song She's a little girl With nothing wrong And she's all alone Eyes wide open Always hoping for the sun And she'll sing her song to anyone that comes along Fragile as a leaf in autumn Just falling to the ground without a sound Crooked little smile on her face Tells the tale of grace That's all her own...  -"Seven Years" - Norah Jones  I've thought long and hard today about a lot of stuff going on inside me. I think that for the first time in my life, a lot of the inconsistenicies in my thinking have become pretty apparent to me. I hung out with Mike last night and it was crazy how much of a snob I was being in my own head. I was finding thing after thing wrong with him until I told myself that there is no possible way that I could date him. Until I realized how ridiculous I sounded. I was telling myself that there was no way I could get involved with him because I actually COULD date him. He's interested in me. He's made that pretty apparent. He's nice, he's shy, he's sweet. And I'm so freaking out because I don't want to let him in. I don't want to get hurt. Maybe I don't think I'm worthy for someone as pure as him to be involved with someone as fucked up as I am. But it just made sense why I sit and pine for the guys I'll never get. It just allows me to wallow and drift even futher into self-pity, which, although not a fun place to be, it's comfortable and familiar.  I don't have to think about how I feel - I just feel like shit.   I talked to Julie about stuff today. It's so weird, I never talk to anyone about what I'm feeling. I'e never had a friend that I could actually share stuff about me. I always feel like such a freakshow around all my friends, like I have all these demons in me, and if I tell anyone they'll have me burned at the stake. But Julie is different. I mean, she's wrestling with her own demons which is cool. It makes her real. Nice to meet someone real in my plasic world of Barbie and Ken Dream Houses and Ferraris. I'm so used to keeping everything I feel inside that it's kind of weird to tell someone things that I don't tell anyone. And for that person to not just dismiss me. I like it.  So I've decided that one of my intentions for 2004 is to find out what makes me happy. It's funny how when your life is guit-ridden and angst-filled, the spots of happiness dull and fade until they're unrecognizable beneath the black tar of depression. But, it's ridiculous to say I've never been happy. What I want is to find those things and re-create those moments so that I can attempt to bring some joy into my life. Though I've said it so many times before, I am really committed to changing my self-esteem and self-image. I'm tired of who I am, or at least who I think I am. It's time to expose the fallacies in my logic and come clean with the skeletons in my closet.

      I like coffee in the morning. I wish I has some. I woke up this morning and I thought to myself, "I wish I had some coffee." So it goes. Today is another day, where all my imperfections are illuminated for me as I stepped out of the shower to look at myself in the mirror. Julie responded to my last blog, "what if you are already the person you want to be?" I thought long and hard about that.  I guess there are some things about myself that I like. I like the way I think, I like the way I have passions about so many things that other people could give 2 shits about.  But, I guess I feel like the things that I love so much about who I am prevent me from finding anyone who loves them in me.   I am so tired of people telling me that in order to find love I have to love myself. I do love myself. But the things that I love about myself time and time again drive others away from loving me. Is that the ultimate Catch-22. What should I do? I'm only 23, I don't know if I am the person I've always wanted to be. I don't feel like it. The person I want to be is not attainable.   I've created this ideal of perfection that can't be attained. This movie that plays in my head over and over again which reminds me of how far away I am from where I would like to be. I want to be confident, I want to be loving, I want to be desired, I want to be giving, and I want to be free. I just don't know where to start to get to those things. I've wound the shroud of my life so tight around me that I can't seem to break free of the rut I'm in. I was starting to feel some enlightenment a couple of weeks ago, but the rainbow has since dissapeared behind the clouds of confusion and depression.  Why do I feel the way I feel? How can I stop feeling the way I feel? Most people would just say STOP FEELING IT. But that's like telling someone to stop breathing or to stop believe in God. My eternal sadness is so deeply rooted in my soul that I don't know how to separate it from my life. I guess I'm kind of scared. It's all I have. Without my self-loathing and my self-hatred, what else do I have left? It's like the only thing in the world I have to comfort me is the knowledge that my good friend lonliness will always understand what I'm feeling.   Happiness comes from within, I'm told. What if nothing inside you is happy? What if it's a daily struggle just to find some reason to get up in the morning? What if the only thing that keeps you alive is the fear of the unknown state of death?   No, my parents didn't beat me. No, I wasn't poor or homeless or adopted or raised in a group home. I have friends. I have family. But that doesn't dismiss my feelings like so many of you do. Just because I don't have some external force acting upon me doesn't make my feelings invalid. I'm human. I feel. Don't tell me to get over it. Don't tell me I bring it on myself or that I choose to feel the way I do. Don't tell me it's all in my head. Feel my pain for one second and you would realize, no one in hell, not even the devil himself would choose for anyone to feel this way. And for damn sure, not for 23 years.

      So I'm going to this event next weekend where I need to vocalize my intentions for 2004. Hmmm. Intentions. I've been trying to think long and hard about my intentions. Dictionary.com defines intention as: An aim that guides an action. So shit. I can't just state what I want, I actually have to ACT on what I want.  I just feel that everything that I want to happen in my life is so completely out of my hands. I want to be in love. I want to get out of debt.  I feel as if these things are so above me; quite impossible goals for me to achieve with my own skills.  I haven't been able to shake this funk that I have been in for the last few days. It's almost like the medicine isn't working anymore. I feel so down every day, the weight of the world pushing hard on my heaving chest. Suffocating me. I can't breathe. I need to get away. But to where? The pessimist that lives in the little hut inside my head politely reassures me that this is IT. That it's the same story wherever I go. The same people, the same cities, just the names and faces change.  I keep holding this fantasy that when I go to grad school I'm going to move to this fantastic place far, far away and that everything is going to be different. I'll be the person I've always wanted to be, I'll find the people I've been searching for.  My life will have some sort of purpose.  But I guess I keep holding onto this romanticized picture of the future because I know when I get there it won't be anything like I imagined. It's like when your a kid, you are so excited for Christmas. You have your checklist and your daily countdown- you can't wait until Christmas because all of your dreams of Barbies and video games are going to come true. But then Christmas arrives and you get all your presents but somehow, after you've opened everything and played with them for a bit, the novelty wears off. And reality comes crashing around you. Christmas is just another day. Like any other day.

      What's the Story? by me  "So what's the story, morning glory?" he said to me with a mischevious grin on his face. My heart stopped. Literally stopped. I thought to myself "This is it sports fans, I am officially going to die."  He looked so beautiful, the sun swooping across his chocolatey brown eyes, making them glow like scrumptuous pools of hot fudge. How I desperately wanted to reach out and run my hands across the scruffiness of his cheek, cradling him in my arms; never letting go.  I felt the blood rush to my face instantly as he looked at me perplexed, clearly expecting an answer. "Think fast!" I order myself. Shit, I can't think of anything clever or witty to say. What to do, what to do?! "Uh, nothing?" There. I said something. So it wasn't as dashing and mysterious as I hoped it be but at least he doesn't think I'm a Helen Keller groupie or something. So apparently this satisfied his question and gave him the green light to begin jabbering away about the odds and ends of his oh so complex and mysterious life. Okay, time for a confession...forgive me father for I have sinned - I was not paying attention to a DAMN word this boy was saying. I couldn't help it, I was distracted by my open adoration for him. I was literally gazing at him, pretending to fein interest in his detailed recollection about god knows what, mentally composing the layout of the shrine I plan to build in his honor. Oh shit, I think he asked me a question. Quick mental scan.....work. How's work going? That must be it. That's all I talk about with him is work.  "Work is so great," I respond eagerly. "But nothing as thrilling as all the projects you're working on." Golly gee wilikers. Is it possible for me to sound any more like a gushing nerd? I guess I should just offer to share my pocket protector and protractor with him now. "Great. Well listen, there's a ton of people I need to chat with." His words cut like burning knifes through my thoughts. "But let's catch up sometime. I'm totally maxed this month but we'll get together soon." Maxed? Are we on Saved by the Bell? Alright Zack, say hi to Slater and Jessie for me... "Sure thing," I respond in my sultry, sexy, you know you wish you could do me right now voice. As I watch him confidently stroll through the party, giving hugs and words freely to those who cross his path, I realize that yes, I have seen the Messiah. Amen.

      Felt an overwhelming wave of sadness crash over me this afternoon. I'm not sure what quite caused it or where it came from. It's been so long since I've felt this depressed I'm not quite sure how to react.  Lonliness. The most painful word in the English language. But yet, my best friend. What would I do without that familiar feeling that creeps into the depths of my heart. She's always there for me. When he doesn't call, when nobody wants me around, when my spirit and my pride are shattered and torn. I can always count on the cool blue to wrap it's loving arms around me, pulling me gently into the pool of my sorrow and self-loathing.  But no more. I am so tired of feeling lonely. I am resolving that in 2004 I will not feel like this. But, easier said than done. It's not that I choose to find lonliness, she comes and seeks me out. I wish I could get to the root of these feelings; figure out why I feel like nobody loves me. Because that's basically it, I feel like nobody loves me. And nobody will ever love me. I guess I feel unlovable.   I would have warned you but really what's the point? Caution could, but rarely ever helps Don't be down when my demeanor tends to dissapoint It's hard enough even trying to be civil to myself  - "To Your Love" - Fiona Apple

      Feeling peacful. Such a warm feeling. I'm loving it. Just allowing myself to bask in the tidal wave of love and beauty undulating around me. Last night I interacted with all the loves of my life and it's made me euphoric.  Even with only four hours of sleep i'm feeling pretty rested and wonderful.  I woke up this morning with such a dynamic feeling of hope and optomism. It's so massive that it's consuming all my being, I feel like I should start handing out flowers to people or something. Life is such a wonderful lover once you let her in. She soothes and comforts you, makes you feel attractive and desirable, makes you feel like you are her one and only, and she will never let you fall. We are still in the honeymoon phase but I feel our relationship can only grow stronger. She's let me into her world, shown me a glimpse of the secrets of her passions and I hungrily await each and every opportunity to experience more of what she has to offer.  Saw the human incarnation of my desire last night. I was so overcome by emotion that it's sheer force literally left me speechless. I am so in awe of this man. I look at him and I see everything that I've ever wanted to know, everything that I've ever wanted to be. I can barely keep my insides from spilling out into a sloshing puddle at his feet. Last night, over and over again I found myself gazing at him with blatant adoration.  It's not even that I have had the chance to speak with him in depth. It's just this powerful emotion that whisks me off into oblivion the second he steps into the room.  I have never felt such a powerful rush of love for a complete stranger. I can only sit and patiently wait for my chance to bathe in the warm glow of his attention and affection.  (As I'm talking my words Slip to the floor And they crawl through your legs Slide under the back door Rendering me Freakish and dazed Well, here I am Don't know how to say this Only thing I know Is awkward silence....  -"Freakish" - Saves the Day)  So what's next on the agenda? Not too sure. Not really looking forward to climbing off my soapbox and back into the day-to-day of this artifical reality that I find myself stuck in but I'll get through it. Jenni and Neil just got engaged on Saturday. I'm helping her get her apartment together and such so that will consume a ton of my energy over the next few weeks. I need to get cracking on my grad school timeline and start studying for the GRE's but for some reason I seem to believe the hourglass is frozen on NOW and the time for me to actually apply to schools will never come. Oh, well. Need to go. Life is leaving without me.

      Crazy wild night last night. I had a one night stand. Haven't had one of those in some time. Kind of interesting because it was completely random. For once, I hooked up with a guy to completely satisfy my own sexual needs, not to fill any emotional hole. I am really okay with the fact that he does not like me "in that way" and that last night was a drunken mistake that he would probably never repeat sober.  Blow to the ego, yes, but isn't that how it always is? Except this time I really just don't care. I'm not even attracted to the dude so it's fine with me.  Supposed to be going out tonight with Lauren and some folks to the Pitcher House. It should be cool. I thought that after have such a beautiful experience last weekend I would find my "normal" life dull and shallow. So I have but becoming at peace with who I am and who I am striving to be has given me this kind of sexy confidence when I do enter the shallow world. I feel like it's okay, I know what's going on with me, and I know their world will never make me happy, so I'm done forcing my expectations on the situations. I think going into last night knowing that I wasn't going to have the same conversations as I did with all the people that i met, helped me to not look for it. Thus, I was able to enjoy myself with out "looking."   But don't get me wrong. I'm still looking. I'm just more confident that I'll know it when I find it. And I know that I won't find it and bars and clubs and tailgate parties at football games. But it's coming. I can feel it deep down.

      My heart is broke But I have some glue Help me inhale and Mend it with you We'll float around  And Hang out on clouds Then we come down And have a hangover....  Skin the sun Fall asleep Wish away The soul is cheap Lesson learned Wish me luck Soothe the burn Wake me up  -"Dumb" - Nirvana  In the dawn of the dusk of the dawn sits a tiny sparrow gaping at her vast surroundings. She's just been awaken from a deep slumber that she doesn't remember slipping into. Her nest is empty. "Mama?" she chirps. No reply. "Papa?" she chirps even louder.  A tidal wave of silence crshes against her delicate ears.  Suddenly the nest, which only seconds ago seemed so cozy, now seems harsh and unforgiving. Overwhelmed by the emptiness around her, she sweetly sings her melancholic song:  I feel so fragile Please don't break me this time, I can't be broken. I used the last of my glue last week.  ------------------------------------------ by me  Breaking glass feels smooth against the skin. Simple silver slivers, dancing red ribbons shaped like moonbeams. Crushing my mellow yellow You invade the equillibrium of my thoughts to bring me gasping into God's cruel joke of reality where the winner's prize prevents celebration and the losers rejoice their defeat.

      Man In Fire by me  The beauty that shines within you is a path for my feet to follow your beauty obscures the callous shadows of the world around me I am lost in you I want to be in you and you in me  The warmth of your breath against my forehead whispering tales of wonder beyond your years falls sweetly on the tears from my eyes  to know you is like to know the Father gentle and loving forgiving of all my imperfections and inconsistencies and hypocrisy you are the end in my beginning i don't need to look anywhere else.

      And maybe I'll impress her By being in a band Maybe if I act real tough She'll let me hold her hand Maybe I'll win her heart By writing this song about her Sometimes I sit and home and wonder if she's sitting at home thinking about me Or am I just wasting my time?  -"Wasting Time" - Blink 182   Wow. I'm in love.  With this guy that I met on Saturday. He is phantasmic. From the second I met him I was like, "wow! I need to know more about this guy."  The first thing he said to me when I met him was that I was beautiful and I think that I about died. I pulled an ultra sultry move later in the night telling him that we had to talk. A few moments later as I'm sitting on the couch he plops down practically ON me. My heart pounds. My palm sweats. I'm trying to playing it cool and flirty even though I'm trying to sound interesting and NOT DUMB. i'm over the fact that he's a kagillion years older than me. I've got to see him again. Period.  I got bold again and sent him a message on Friendster. Just a "hey it was great to meet you" kind of thing. He wrote back today! He told me about a local band that his friend is in and to check them out so I think I will. I guess he read my page...it's so dumb I hope he doesn't think bad things about me! So anyhow he said "Yes yes. All will come to pass...Keeep coming around, you will have more fun than you know what to do with." Hopefully this means good things...hee hee  I had such a blast this weekend with Julie. She introduced me to all these fantastic people and I'm feeling so good about myself and life. Funny how three years of therapy and about 5 different antidepressants have done as much good. It was so cool to meet people who actually care about people. It really made me realize how shallow a lot of my friendships are. I think I'm ready to take 2004 on now. I have a feeling that this is going to be a good year for me. Well, I'm going to MAKE it a good year for me.  There is just so much promise and hope in my head right now.

      Tonight was probably the most interesting night I have ever had. I went with Julie to this play and it was phoenomenal (I don't think I spelled that right). But the craziest thing was the people that I met. The night was so intense. These people were so......deep. It made me pretty much feel like the shallowest person to ever walk the planet. It was like the bully in elementary school going to high school and getting  bullied. I've always been the intellectual, spiritual, thougtful person of my group but being surrounded by so many people who were in tune with everything I think about and want from life was scary. It actually made me realize that I am scared to love and to be love. It made me uncofortable that these people were so free with their emotions and their feelings. I felt weird with people who were so unadultered in their thoughts and in their prescence. It was as if each person owned their space. I feel so special that Julie saw something in me to introduce me to a group that she holds so dear, but I am scared that I am not as wonderful or as special of a persona as she thinks I am. I think I wish I could be her. She's moving to Hawaii. Just picking up and going. When would I ever do something like that? 2004 is my year to become the person I want to be. I want to find love. I know that this can only happen once I begin to love myself. Which is a damn tall order. I guess the questions I'm asking myself is why I am I afraid to love or be loved? I know I say that's what I want but why was I so petrified around people tonight who all they had in their hearts was love? I'm supposed to be going back with Julie tomorrow night and I have to admit I'm a bit frightened. But I am sure as hell not happy with the pitiful existence I'm living now and I'm thinking these people may be able to lead me to the answers within myself that I am looking for.

      "The fact that a sick man laughs is surely no reason for not attempting to cure his sickness."  - Paul Robeson  Ahh. Major depressive episode is a-brewing sports fans. I've been going over these pages, reading with disgust the whiny, boring, words that I have written. If you have stumbled onto these pages by mistake, I am sorry. I am sorry for the pitiful nature of a girl lost, who is stuck in the abyss of sadness, wallowing in her own feces of self-doubt and lonliness.  But I am trying guys. I promise. Have you been here before? My new therapist told me that my last therapist diagnosed me with dysthmia. She's been going over what that means and the implications that has on my treatment and my life. Almost nobody recovers from dysthmia. It's rates are much much MUCH lower than people with major depressive disorder. Very hard to treat because unlike MDD, the depressed mood is intrinisic to the person, a part of who they are. She thinks it should be treated as a personality disorder. Yay, team! I have a fucked up personality.  I feel like I push everyone away. I just don't know how to not do it. Putting a name on my moods and filling my world with fancy terminology doesn't make the tears stop. Doesn't make the world any less gray, any less cold and bleak.  Doesn't make the throbbing wound heal any faster.   Nobody understands. But ever if they did, would it make it any better? So you know I'm sad, does that make you want to sit here, constantly reassuring me that I'm pretty, I'm smart, I'm blah blah blah? I wouldn't want to do it. It's boring. I can't expect anyone to want to. But I want someone to want to. I want someone to give a damn.   Oh and my mother. "You were just happy five minutes ago, why do you always have to ruin everything?" I'm sorry mom that I've ruined your life. I'm so very sorry that for 23 years I've been nothing but a burden that you've had to take care of. I'm sorry that in your eyes, you've been the best mother in the whole world and all I've been is a fat, unappreciative little brat who makes your world miserable. I can't help it. I'm trying so hard to make you love me but I keep failing every single time. I guess if your own mother doesn't want to love you, who else will? "I worry that you'll never find anyone to love you." Is this because you never loved me mom? You know that if you can't, don't won't, no one else will?  I'm starving for love. My insides are eating themselves, begging to be fed the nurture and devotion it's tasted maybe twice.   Hunger hurts and I want him so bad Oh it kills Cause I know I'm a mess He don't wanna clean up I've got to fold Cause these hands are too shaky to hold Hunger hurts But starving works When It costs too much too love.

       People say I'm the life of the party  'cause I tell a joke or two  Although I may be laughin' loud and hearty  Deep inside I'm blue   Outside, I'm masquerading  Inside, my heart is fading  I'm just a clown  Since you put me down  My smile is my makeup...    So take a good look at my face  You see my smile looks out of place  If you look closer it's easy to trace  The tracks of my tears   -"Tracks of My Tears" - Smoky Robinson and the Miracles  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So last night hung out and it was fun. Completely different vibe though. Wasn't as overwhelming as before. Guess I'm starting to be comfortable. I told Ryan I had a crush on him and it's the weirdest thing. I really don't feel so strongly about him anymore. It's like venting all of my emotions to him kind of made them go away. Pretty random I guess.  Tonight is Julie's show at the Pitcherhouse and I'm pretty stoked about that. I want to meet some hotties. I feel like my preoccupation with meeting someone is what's preventing that from happening but you know I just really don't know how to make it stop. I was looking at all the couples last night thinking, I want that. I know they say when you stop wanting it that's when it happens but how can you stop wanting to love someone and be loved? That's the basic human condition. I think I deserve to be loved as much as anyone else. So why should I have to stop looking and hope and pray and wish upon a star that one day it will just "find" me. That's a complete crapload of shit.   I went on a mini date with Greg that I met online and it didn't work. He was ugly. He had no personality. I was not attracted to him at all. I've decided that online dating really doesn't work. At least  not for me. Either I'm too stuck-up or expecting too much but now I've gone out on 5 dates with guys that I've met online and all 5 have been extremely dissapointing. I'm done with it.   This girl last night was exactly what I wish I was. She was so cute and perky and I feel like she's the girl that every guy wants to be with. In fact, though her boyfriend was there, you could definitely see the spark in every guy's eye that she talked too. I wanted to hate her so much - hate her for being nice, hate her because she looks exactly how I want to look, hate her because she remembered my name. It made me feel so inferior - like all of my problems would be solved if i looked like her.   Though these pages have been a voice for me to let much of my anxiety out, I still harbor so many ill feelings. I'm caught in this identity crisis that I just can't seem to reconcile with myself. I keep thinking that I've really built a ditch for myself and I can't get out of it. I was watching Antwone Fisher and I saw there family and I thought about how much easier it would be to marry a black man and just be "black"...following all the stereotypes that make me cringe. Maybe I wouldn't have such low self-esteem with guys, always afraid to approach them or say anything to them because the first thing I wonder is "Will they not like me because I'm black?" "Would he ever date a black girl?" My issues with inflicting my color on others (well males to be exact) is so severe that I know that's what makes me crazy.  Like last night, I wonder if I had smooth white skin and blond hair and bright blue eyes, would Ryan have responded to my proposition better? Would guys that get my number actually call me after their boldness from the elixir of alcohol wore off?  With my personality and white skin would I be more irresistible? Would I still be longing for someone? I like to think that things would be the same. That color doesn't mean anything in this new millenia of the open-minded being. But so many times have I been told, in various ways and excuses that being black is the one unforgivable sin that they can't get past. Well, of course I could never tell my parents I'm dating a black girl. Well you're really pretty, for a black girl. Wow, I've always wanted to have sex with a black girl, I heard it's really good.   Caught in a world I don't belong. But do I belong in the other world? Why do you talk like a white girl? You act so white. Oreo. Sell-out.   I'm tired of playing the outcast role. I'm tired of everyone casting me in the role. I'm tired of never feeling like I fit in, like I will never fit in.  Like I have to choose to either be something I'm not to be accepted, or hold true to my likes, my beliefs and risk being a pariah forever. My mom says this of my Auntie Lois. "You remind me so much of her, but she's alone and I just don't want you to end up like her." But what can I do? I just want to experience the same joys as everyone else.  ------------------------------------------- Bomb Shelter by me  In a war between me and me Who will win? It's never quite apparent  who the real victim (villain)is.  I want it to be you  So I can hate you. Instead of hating myself.

      "Trying to find a boy in high school is like trying to find meaning in a Pauly Shore movie..."  -Alicia Silverstone as "Cher" in Clueless  Haven't had much to say really. I've just been moving from one spot to another- reality seeming so not real lately. Kind of like this really bad made for tv movie that I can't seem to change channel.   Went out on the big V-day. It was okay. Met some boys. Gave out my number. Woke up hungover the next morning and realized how over going to bars I am. I really am over the whole get trashed and act stupid and meet stupid people.  I am convinced that there is a way to meet guys besides going to bars. I've just got to find it. Maybe I'll join a book club. Except most book clubs have girl members. I am so sorry but I know enough girls. I've got to put my foot down - NO MORE FRIGGING GIRLS! I just need to be around BOYS!  As friends, as  lovers I really don't care anymore it's just all this estrogen is making me insane.  I'm tired of being stressed by the way.  I know that I create a lot of stress for myself so I'm actively trying to alleviate some of that. Let's just face facts. 1) I am lazy. I don't like moving. I like sleeping. I like inaction. I like doing nothing. 2) I like spending money. I love shopping. I just love the thought of BUYING things. 2) I am a perfectionist. I can't get things wrong. I have a complex. I am a overachiever. Okay boys and girls, who found the problem with these facts? Yes, Bobby that's right. They are inconistent! They are pitted against each other in a daily struggle! have you ever heard of a lazy overachiever? Nope. Don't think so. I am causing the stress because I don't want to do shit, want everything money can buy, and want to get everything by being better than everyone else. Which ultimately sucks cuz I don't want to do anything. Oh well. All this writing is making me tired.

      I confess to Almighty God and you, my brothers and sisters That I have sinned In my thoughts and in my words In what I have done, And what I have failed to do And I ask blessed Mary, ever virgin, all the angels and saints, and you, my brothers and sisters to pray for me to the Lord our God.  - The Roman Catholic Church  Sometimes, right now being one of those times, I wish I was dead. Not because of the promise of what death holds. Not because the possiblity and mystery of the unknown is the clear-cut winner when juxtaposed with my skewed view of reality. It's just that if this is all there is, what's the point?  It's heartache after heartache. Dissapointment. Uneasiness. As humans, we live entirely in the past or future, reminiscing about how we wish we could recapture the joyous feelings of our youth; while eagerly awaiting adventures and long-awaited dreams and journeys that lie ahead.  How devestating to realize - NOW is the journety you've always waited to be on. YOu've been saving your pennies and packing your bags gor this moment in soon to be history. Which of course has not lived up to your delusions of grandeur, but forever will be enshired as one of your "glory days." You'll put this one on the shelf between the coulda, shoulda, wouldas, uncleaned pipe dreams and dusty fantasies of ideal senarios.  We live to die. We die to live. Along this bleak continuum we find roads and rivers, paths not taken, forrests not forged. We congratulate ourselves for carrying the torch of individuality and independence. "No, I'm not like THEM," she screamed into the night, words falling like meaningless particles of air between the baaaasss of all the sheep in her surroundings.  No matter how hard we try to proclaim our innocence, the blood can't be washed from our hands. Original sin follows us through the birth canal, holding claim to our lives until our number is called. 48,00000,7777,9998,00001. I think I might be next in line.  Should a story that we know the end to be so much work to read?  Stumbling over words, looking to interpret themes and complex characters, paraphrasing to save time. We know how this book ends, boys and girls, but yet we stuggle to keep adding footnotes, hoping that this will stop us from reaching the inevitable "Monster at the End of this Book." And guess what kids, it's not going to be lovable, furry old Grover this time.  And the author's mysterious handwritting written across our minds doesn't seem to fade no matter how much we try to philosophize it out of there.  So we sit, searching for a book jacket with a description that doesn't exist.  For this story has no meaning. The names and faces have been changed to protect the lives of the souls that never were.    And so here we are.  Death. In the beginning and in the end. There is no life. Only pre-death. You don't exist, I don't exist  but we all know for damn sure that everyone dies. I think anyway.

      When you think that life Has done you wrong, has pushed you down enough, don't shake your head and say okay Cuz if you think my life  Is yours to wrong Then call me on my bluff You'll turn and run away...  I should have known not to sacrifice myself...  -"The Sacrifice of Life" - Midtown  Sometimes I think I might be too sensitive. People can hurt my feelings too easily. I feel hurt, and I feel hurt for  a long time. It hurts that they don't care, that they don't seem to notice that the things they say aren't nice. I know I take things too seriously sometimes but I feel like if you are my friend you would already know that about me. Not that you would take any extra steps to censor your words but to notice that I'm fragile, I break easily. Especially with those who I've let in. I'm paranoid, I question myself, I doubt myself. Constant reassurance is a bitch I know. I don't expect it from everyone. I just want to know that my feeling matter.   Feeling bored today. Looked up some stuff about Costa Rica and it's pretty depressing how much stuff costs. I'm not quite sure what I'm going to do when my little gig is up here. I know that I don't want to go back to Rancho and do shit there but that might be my only option. Maybe I'll enroll in a credential program part-time this fall so I can finish up my student teaching hours next semester. That might not actually be a bad idea. That way if I don't get into any grad schools I'll be ready to start applying for teaching postions. Not that bad. It might be hard to take those classes plus psych classes but we'll see. I think that if I can take 4 classes this summer I might be done with all my prereqs.   I really want to travel but it'll be impossible with all my debt. I just can't afford it unless I win the lottery. O-well. I really don't know what i want anymore. I was thinking in the car today maybe I should just be a teacher and forget it all. Can I really afford to be in school for another 6 years? Can my mental health stand anymore of this not knowing how I'm going to survive another day crap? Sometimes I think this is all so stupid. Here I am killing myself, poor, unhappy for a dream that may never ever come true. I guess that's what all dreams are but I don't know if I'm willing to continue sacrificing my well-being for it.

      Was watching this show called "Single in LA" on Oxygen channel. It's supposed to be this real life Sex and the City kind of thing. It kind of got me motivated. All of a sudden I've been getting a lot of hits on my little online dating profiles..from actually "cute" guys...that I would consider going out with. I'm talking to 3 guys...2 are 25 and one is 23... they are all perfect according to my checklist (college grad, tall, dark hair, sarcastically witty, skinny, etc) but we'll see how it goes in real life. I'm almost skeptical because this is all a little too good to be true. for whatever it's worth it's boosted my self-esteem and ego so i'm just going to roll with it. I've just put my "work in progress" on my   urlLink Just Give Me the Writing    ..i'm hoping some eyes will find it and give feedback. In fact, if you are reading this stop and read that instead. And then let me know what you think. Anyhow, today I think I'll work on my timeline for the year. I've really got to get cracking on planning out my GRE stuff and grad school apps, plus i need to start seriously thinking about Costa Rica.  I'm feeling pretty good now, especially after my mini-breakdown last week. I'm still pretty stressed about money but I'm trying not to really think about it. O-well, with God's help things will happen. I'm sure of it.

      I found something! I found something! Something being that I enjoy, something that makes me happy. Went to the Midtown show last night..it was fantastic! I forgot how much I love seeing them perform. Forgot how much I love being at a show, hearing the music I love. Last night was one of the first times that I went to a show and felt unselfconscious. I danced, I sang, I didn't care if people were staring at me or talking about me or if I didn't look like I fit it. It was so much fun! I think it helped that I brought Julie this time...she had fun - she danced and stuff so that helped me to just go with what I love. I've decided that if I can get a second job to increase my cash flow I am definitely going to go to more shows. I have so much fun...just the problem of finding someone to go with me. Gabe looked so HOT....i love him. I talked to him for a sec at the bar to tell him that the new single rocks and I couldn't help but think "This is the man I want to marry"...okay so that's a long shot but I'm totally down for Gabe replicas. No shame in my game if I can't get the original.=)  I emailed Bill...I don't really expect him to write back but I was happy that I did it. I feel like I never said things to him. I didn't really get to say everything I wanted to say because of my pride issues. I mean I didn't tell him that i had been falling in love with him. I didn't tell him that all those feelings I was having was (plus the all that wine of course) the reason I flipped that night. I did tell him how him breaking up with me was the catalyst for so much change in my life. I do believe that if we had still been together and I hadn't gotten the LAUSD job I would still be at DCW depressed and stressed. Okay so I'm still depressed and stressed but at least not about work.

      I don't need to be anything other Than a prison guard's son I don't need to be anything other  Than a specialist's son I don't have to be anything other Than the birth of two souls in one Part of where I'm going, is knowing where I'm coming from I don't want to be Anything other than what I've been trying to be lately All I have to do Is think of me and I have peace of mind I'm tired of looking 'round rooms Wondering what I've got to do Or who I'm supposed to be I don't want to be anything other than me I'm surrounded by liars everywhere I turn I'm surrounded by imposters everywhere I turn I'm surrounded by identity crisis everywhere I turn Am I the only one who noticed?

      I knew what I wanted and I was fixed on it I was sure of it, I could've been wrong It seems like it's never quite like I thought it'd be The reality, am I where I belong?  It's not like they say  I fell like most everything's out of focus in my mind I'm trying to make some sense of what I left behind The difference in who I am and the one I want to be It seemed so much easier when there was something to believe  "Out of Focus" - Face 2 Face  I am paranoid. I am paranoid as fuck. Everywhere I go, everything I do, I think people are talking about me. I don't know why. It's like I can say to myself, "you are being irrational. of course people aren't talking about you." but, it's like the little kid whose parents show them that there are no monsters in the closet, once the lights go out, you can hear the noises. they are in there. I had a semi-painc attack in the bathroom. felt so alone. felt like i couldn't tell anyone that i am slowly letting the depression and the self-doubt eat me alive. i told julie then felt stupid. like i shouldn't have done that. like when you watch those movies and the stupid girl confesses her weakness to her "friend" only to find out they are the person that has been conspiring against her the whole time. now she's going to think i'm stupid. okay so that thought was stupid. but maybe it's true. i just really don't know anymore. i don't know what to think or what to believe in. it's as if nothing is really as it seems and i can't figure out which one is the right way. i don't know what to do. i just want to go home and curl up and never see anyone again.

      "Don't shut me out!" she heard herself screaming, letting the words bound out into the hallway, carrying as far as her unsteady voice would take them. Nothing happened. The air around her was thick and moist, like the swamps of Florida, pressing it's sticky touch against her bare chest. She closed her eyes briefly, attempting to gain composure and steady herself in the spinning room around her.  Where was she? Was this the same place that 15 years ago she dreamed would be her happily ever after? A glimmer of her reflection caught her eye as she passed by the mirror on her way to the door. I am disgusting.   Like a robot she flung open the door to the roof. It was her special quiet spot. The memories of their conversatin ran through her head like speeding bullets, sending searing pain from one spot to the next. Words, full of broken promises and undeveloped  expectations. The cool breeze hit her face as she stepped into the open space. This is it. No where to go. This is the BIG T.   If I'm just bad news, then you're a liar. The end.

      "You're giving up on me, but what else have you got?"  -"Resignation" - Face 2 Face  Feeling very underappreciated today. I've been in kind of a bad mood today because I feel like I work really hard and go out of my way to be nice and helpful and no one seems to notice, or worse, no one seems to care. Is that being a little egocentric? I dunno but it's nice to get the credit every once in a while.  Went on my first "online" date last night. It was okay. No sparks. The guy was super nice and the date was cool but definitely no sparks. I think that's good though. This stuff might work because it will help me get used to dating without getting so emotionally involved every time a guy so much as looks in my direction. And I'm getting free dinner and entertainment so you really can't beat that.  I had my midterm in Abnormal today and I don't think I did very well. The kicker is that I really don't care. I just kind of want this awkward period in my life to end. I'm tired of being broke and having no money and being tired and working and school and feeling like I don't ever get to do anything for myself anymore. It feels yucky.  I was watching Jenni and Neil with Cole when we were at Sam and Sharlie's superbowl party and I have to admit that I was jealous. They were so cute with their little "family unit." Although I'm not quite ready for the whole marriage thing, a part of me feels like it would be just so easy to slip into that life. I often wonder if the way I act, the way I am is setting me up for a life full of heartbreaks and lonely nights. Is there a guy with all of the traits that I am looking for? I often say that I'm not that picky and I really don't have a checklist but maybe I do. Is it bad to want to feel overwhelmed with emotion everytime you see his face? To have him be the first thing on your mind when you awaken and his name the last word on your lips before succombing to the land of dreams?   I definitely am not willing to sacrifice passion for stability. But am I only hurting myself in the end? Will I ever find the passion that I am seeking in a partner who desires me as much as I desire him? Will I ever find someone that I can love with my entire being only to have him feel the same way as me? I guess if we knew the answers life would be much more comfortable; and we'd never get off the damn couch.

      Read julie's blog today and it really touched a chord in my heart. Brought me back to a place where I haven't been to in awhile. I'm 13, I'm trying to dodge insults and flying hands as I walk to Language Arts. I'm crying inside but trying to appear as if none of this bothers me - that I'm all right. But clearly I'm not all right. The worthlessness, the hopelessness - it can all be traced back to those junior high moments. Where I thought I wasn't going to live if I went to high school, where all I wanted to do was die because I couldn't find one reason that living was a good option. When I had no one to talk to, no one to confide in, all I could do was listen to my music and cry the afternoons away all alone. I'm still so hurt by all that, and though I try to push it aside, I can help but realize all the paranoia I have about if people will like me, the feelings like I'll never be good enough; they all come from this rejection I've experienced. I've said that 2004 will be a year of learning to love myself for who I am and all my talents. 2004 will also be a year of letting go of the insults and accusations thrown on my character by confused adolescents who thought putting down others was the only way to make themselves feel worthwhile.

      I want you to want me I need you to need me I'd love you to love me I'm begging you to beg me  "I want You to Want Me" - Cheap Trick   I've been really tired today. I think it's because of my run/walk this morning. I am so intent on losing weight and looking hot. I've kinda noticed a difference and I just keep thinking how hot I'll look when I'm thinner. How many boys will like me when I'm thin.  So thought a little bit more about Saturday night. I feel kinda dirty about it all. But, again, not because of what I did but because of something Karina said. "You deserve better." I feel like I've been letting boys use me for so long that it almost doesn't matter to me anymore.  I deserve better. But I don't GET better. I see girls who have been in several relationships. Since the age of 15 I've been in ONE meaningful, long-term relationship. I've had TWO FOUR-MONTH relationships. So, in eight years I've had like 3 boyfriends. But I can tell you that I've slept with way more than 3 people.   All I want is to date someone seriously for a little while. We don't have to get engaged. We don't have to pledge life-long love and adoration. I just want someone to call me and ask how my day was. Someone to cuddle with in my big bed at night. Someone to take me to the movies and share Sundays with. For a little while.  I'm not anyone's type. I hear that from so many guys all the time "you're not my type" Black, white, latino, turkish jew - the story is always the same "You're not my type." Oh, but I'm everyone's type to fuck. When it comes to the let's have sex part I beautiful, exotic, gorgeous, sexy, witty, smart, a cool chickie. How can every guy tell me that I'm everything he wants in a fuck friend but wouldn't give me the time of day once the intoxication wears off and the sun peeps through the window.  I don't know what they want. I don't know what I lack. All I know is they don't want me.

      Dammit. I do bad things. Well, I don't really know why they are bad. Last night I had sex with Joe, the guy that Kellie went out with one time who, in her opinion, dicked her over.  He was into me - the whole night. I felt like it was natural that we hook-up. But why do I feel bad? Not for the reasons you might think.  I don't feel bad regarding Kellie. She started crying last night but I feel like she has no right to be upset. She's been saying how much she hates him, how she would never hook up with him, etc. But then she thinks we're hooking up and then she's crying threatening to kick us all out.  But what I feel bad about is how we hooked up last night. Before I went in with him I asked him 2 questions. 1) What do you think about me? and 2) Would you ever date me? And why or why not.  So the answers were okay. He thought I was a down chick, hot, cool to hang out with. But he wouldn't date me. It basically broke down to I wasn't his type and he's not trying to be in a relationship. Fair enough, I thought so I thought "what the hell" and I fucked him. Easy as pie.  But then today I feel a little queasy. I'm not sure why. Maybe sad because he doesn't want to date me. It just confirmed to me that all guys want to do is have sex with me and I will never find anyone to love me. I guess that's why I'm upset.  Although I have to say it would be nice to have a little fuck friend. Why the hell not? He's cute, I think I would have fun sleeping with him. Just limit the talking. I already know where I stand which I appreciate. I'm not saying that this is my new "style" from now on but I do feel a little relieved already knowing where I stand.

      I would say I'm sorry  If I thought that it would change your mind  But I know that this time  I've said too much  Been too unkind   I would break down at your feet  And beg forgiveness  Plead with you  But I know that  It's too late  And now there's nothing I can do   I would tell you  That I loved you  If I thought that you would stay  But I know that it's no use  That you've already  Gone away   Misjudged your limits  Pushed you too far  Took you for granted  I thought that you needed me more   Now I would do most anything  To get you back by my side  But I just  Keep on laughing  Hiding the tears in my eyes  'cause boys don't cry  Boys don't cry   -"Boys Don't Cry" - The Cure  The weekend has long since passed but I still find myself thinking about Tom and all the things that went wrong. Karina had a pretty rough morning and her story got me thinking about my deal with Tom. She said something so real and intersting - "What does he add or bring to your life?" She elaborated. Everyone in your life serves some type of purpose, is there for a reason. We befriend people, keep people around because they fill some type of void, or they help our needs or add to our existence in some way.   For the life of me i can't figure out Tom's role in my life. Is it because he's not supposed to have one? Have I been trying to repeatedly shove this guy into a space where there's no room for him? I would do anything for him to act the way the he was with me once. I would say anything, be anything, do anything for him to want me the way I want him. I want him to love me the way he loves(ed?) Angela. Why can she penetrate the walls of his tough exterior while I wait sullenly on the outskirts. I feel that I've been there with him. I've touched him in his mind and his heart that I know Angela, or anyone for that matter has ever gotten to.  I will never forget the morning that his dad bailed him out of jail and he and Angela were standing in the kitchen. He was hungry and she said she would fix him a burrito. And he looked at her with such love. Okay so she was preggers at the time but I want that! I want him to look at me that way. Cuz he has. Like he was so astonished about what he was feeling for me.  I don't think I will ever get it back. I know I will never get it back. I've just got to learn to live with this...feeling. I feel like the way I feel about him is a huge SIGN to what the hell is wrong with me. Why do I need him? Why do I crave his approval? Why is my self-worth and self-esteem crushed instantly. Why can't I just see him and not feel bad that he doesn't want to have meaningless sex with me?   This trend in my life of letting boys determine my self-woth has got to stop. But when will it? How do I begin to feel good about who I am, what I look like when I feel so unattractive because no boy wants to be with me. I know my feelings about myself should be independent of these things but how do you begin to change if you feel good or bad about yourself when you base it on if any guy asks for your phone number in a night? Or if the guy who asked for your number calls you? Or if he asks you out on a date? Or if he asks you for a second date? The slippery slope of dependency is one that I am ready to break.  Suggestions?

      DISCLAIMER: This is a heavy, political post. Please don't read if you find political or social outliers offensive.   So, the only unfortunate thing about this site is the inability to find blogs again when you have a well thought out plan to articulate a snappy and savvy comment.  I saw this girl's blog. She claims to be a philosophy major, and spends her whole blog making unfound political statements that blatantly expose her ignorance. I can't find her blog again to actually form this comment to penentrate the depths of her narrow mind. I can only hope that she stumbles upon these pages as I write my response to her.  The post that struck me so deeply is her attempt to compare our public welfare system to stealing. In this argument she rests the social situation of welfare recipients upon values and traits intrinsic to who they are. Sweetheart, as an 18-year old philosphy/poli-sci major, I can only hope that your ignorance begins to fade as your college career unfolds.  To attribute poverty to people's intrinsic values is a sad, pitiful mistake that is made again and again, especailly in the U.S. where we'd all like to still believe the tarnished American Dream.  How can we ignore racism? Classism? How can we turn our backs to the unfair, unbalanced playing field that American babies are born into?  As far as I know, nobody asks to be born a discriminated minority. Nobody asks to be born into poverty, in the projects. No kid asks to be sent to a foster home. Few ask to live on the streets. No baby asks to be born addicted to drugs.  though to some these may be the dregs of sociey who have chosen their position and can easily get out, i still don't clearly see the path out. And I like to think I'm pretty damn smart. =)  Okay, so they scream education! Education is the key to break the cycle of poverty. These people could get out if they wanted to be educated. When America's public schools are overcrowded and underfunded tell me how a quality education is possible? It has been statistically proven that high achievement in school correlates with family background and socioeconomic factors. Tell me how kids with no possible role models, no books in the home, no encouragement from family, friends and teachers are supposed to actively enter the race to compete with kids from much more luxurious backgrounds?   But wait, I'm getting off the point. Welfare. No, I don't beleive that people should use welfare as their career option. But I do think it serves a purpose. We are all human beings. Every human being should be give a chance to live.   So it's stealing you say. You don't want to pay for other people to live. And since your're a taxpayer, you are being forced against your will to support lives that you deem unworthy. Well, you know - I'm a taxpayer too. And even more importantly...I wasn't asked if I want to give money to support a war where millions of people are being persecuted, lives trampled over, all in the name of oil. I wasn't asked if I wanted to fork over money out of every paycheck to aid and abed the ratification of the consitution of a "democratic" society to make discrimination a part of the law of the land. I didn't decide to donate money to execute human beings, to pay for cops who take drugs from the streets only to use them for themselves. I didn't ask to pay for politicians who  deny a woman the right to make her own decisions.  Saying that government sponsored welfare programs are "stealing" from taxpayers is a bunch of BS.  We pay taxes because we assume that they are going to some common good for all of society. Public schools, roads and streets, policemen and fireman. And yes, helping those that are less fortunate is good for society. It's good for the soul of society. I don't remember when alturism became a bad word in a America but it better become a good one fast. As the climate of international affairs changes before us in the new millenium, karma is a'coming boys and girls. America should get on its hands and knees and pray the saying "you reap what you sow" is just an old wives tale.

      Bed Ridden by me  Sleeping is dreaming Dreaming is living When the flavor of dreams is sweeter than reality. Soothing my soul; the cool drink of slumber.  Close my eyes Let it come Black and blue crash  with sparks of red. I'm falling... falling, falling, falling I'm deeper... deeper, deeper, deeper  I hate to see you fade No memory of the passion we feel You'll wander off into the vast ocean of dreamed lovers lost To be replaced with another cradling my head resting softly on my pillow.  You touch me I feel your skin Masked behind hazy masks of subconscious laternt symbols Familiar and unrecognizable the luscious warmth of anonymity. like all one night affairs fade with the intrusive sound of my alarm clock.

      It started out all wrong I wasn't thinking Everything is wrong I couldn't see it  I still believe I'm right Even though I understand your side You have your reasons  I guess I thought that things Would somehow try and work themselves out I like to think It's not so easy to convince myself That everything's going to be okay  Shame on me this time I was only trying to make the best of this I should have known Fool me once then shame on you And again And I must choose between suspicion and naivete This is what you wanted anyway This time shame on me.  "Shame On Me" - Face to Face ----------------------------------- Love ridden I've looked at you With the focus I gave to my birthday candles I've wished on the lidded blue flame Under your brow, I've wished for you.  Nobody sees when you are lying in your bed And I want to crawl in with you But I cry instead I want your warmth But it will only make me colder When it's over So I can't tonight, baby  No Not baby anymore If I need you I'll just use your simple name Only kisses on the cheek from now on And in a little while We'll only have to wave  My hand won't hold you down no more the path is clear to follow through I've stood to long in the way of the door and now, I'm giving up on you.  "Love Ridden" - Fiona Apple    This weekend was a crazy one indeed.  Went home and hung out with everyone. Friday night was, well, emotional. I didn't know that Tom was going to be out (he hasn't hung out in a while). When I got to El Perico he was sitting there outside smoking with everyone, and he looked HOT! I couldn't even believe how hot he looked. But I didn't have a chance to say hi because Amy Lowry was out and I haven't seen her in forever so of course she accosted me to find out what was up.   Every now and then I kept sneaking glances at Tom from the corner of my eye. I could see him looking at me. Finally he said hi and then I kinda just said a "hi, boys" to him Van, Neal, and Rick. I can't face him. So a quick decision to go to McAlan's and he was parked next to me with his brand new Saturn. What's this? Like his fourth car? Anyhow, we said a few words. Whatever.  So then drunk Amy in my car is like "oh! I think you should hook up with Tom! Now, bless Amy's little heart she doesn't know about the history. So I gently let her know. Then she's like "His eyes totally lit up when he saw you walk up. He kept looking over...blah, blah, blah." Okay, so this is bad! I've worked so hard to not think about Tom, to convince myself that he's full of shit and that he brings nothing but negative energy in my life.  I could feel myself falling in love all over again.  We get to McAlan's and we're all hanging out and he's talking to chicks as usual. I find out that he's going to the army. Wow. My heart dropped. I know it's good for him but still. I don't really know what I'm feeling. He's talking to a cute little blonde chic and I hearing him mention my name and kind of point. What the fuck is he saying about me?  So the night goes on. He's not a total dick but it's clear, whatever emotion Amy saw has now drowned behind the contious stream of alcohol flowing into his body. I'm sad. I feel rejected. I want to cry. Tracy is telling me not to, that we're over Tom and that he's stupid and dumb, that I'm so much better. She's over Chad (we were in the same sitch) but the thing she doesn't understand is that I can see all of Tom's faults blatantly. They are crystal clear. But yet I still love him. Or maybe I'm infatuated with him. The attention that I got from him was the one period in my life where I felt beautiful, confident and desired. And yes, I want it back. No matter how much of a dick he is to me.  We're in the bathroom and my wonderful friends, between sniffs and snorts of white fairy dust reassure me that Tom doesn't love himself  and can't possibly love me. Jenni kinda just tells me I'm stupid. How many times have we been here before? All I have is Amy (who got me into this damn mess in the first place) trying not to fall over as I sit sobbing on a toilet. Ah, a reoccuring theme in my life.  Saturday was alright. Me, Ashley, Tracy and Amy went to this random party and I ran into charles, who lookd really good. I got his number. I guess he's having a party in a couple of weeks and invited us to come. Whatever.  I've had two nightmares about Tom and I'm ready for it to end. I'm tired of feeling these strong emotions every time I see him. Why do I? I need, want, MUST find a way to get over him. I can't make it like this until September. And even so, I want to be fine once he's gone. I don't want to sit and think that I can save him, that my love is all he needs to get by.

      You never listened And you'll never listen now You know what I'm about, but is that sufficient? Do you hear the words I say? It hurts when you talk that way.  -"Come On" - Midtown  Hi, my name is Nicole. And I'm an alcoholic. Yep, that's right sports fans. I'm an alcoholic. Some of  you know, some of you don't. I'm not really ashamed of it you see. As I sit here with my rum and diet (only 66 calories) and my Midtown blasting I'm feeling great. I'm happy, I'm relaxed, I'm alone and I'm okay. I'm drowning out the depression, with only thoughts of punkrock dancing in my head. I've figured out why you keep me around. I'm what you dare not be. Shannon put it fantastically on Monday night, "you're always butting heads with the system. You can't just go with the flow, you always have to challenge something." Does that make life harder? Probably.  I guess it would be easier to let the wave of society crash over me and just accept that deck of cards that I've been given to play with. But, but, but I don't wanna! Why should I have to give in to what other people think is right for me? I like being contrary. Even if I'm alone forever, even if I never find another soul who will accept me, I can't, won't do it. So you see, it's okay for me to say I like being a drunk. Not a drunk in the conventional "have you neglected work, family or other obligations for 2 or more days in a row due to drinking" drunk (some of you will definitely get that reference!) but someone who is very okay to drink alone, during the day, before i go out or whatever. Shut up damn AA people. My weekend officially begins tonight. I have my Our House interview in the morning so it's not really party time yet but whatevs, I'm not going to work tomorrow so that's cool. I just have so much shit to handle in my life right now. Today we were going to UV and talking about what we would be if our #1 plan didn't come thru. It was so funny cuz I'm thinking, "this is my #2 plan!" Hello, I wanted to marry into money and right now just be sipping martinis watching the pool boy bend over, very nice Damien! Eva! Can you get me another drink? Ah...those will be the days. Another realization I'm having. I'm shallow and I'm okay with that. Well, not shallow but stuck-up. Everyone has been calling me stuck-up for years, my mom, Jenni, Ashley, Erin, everyone. But I'm always like "no". Whatever. I'm stuck-up and damn proud. What does that really mean except that I expect the best from situations and people? Is that really too much? I don't act like I'm too good I just want everyone to offer the best of themselves. whatever. Come on, let go of those affecations.

      Don't have much to say, just wanted to pass the time while I'm waiting for the family and everyone else to show up. Watched American Idol last night, kinda sad that leah labelle got kicked off, i kinda liked her. She's obiously no Diana Degarmo but still.  i'm feeling kinda fat today. No fun. I was watching the idols last night and I felt so huge compared to how they looked. I am trying to lose weight but no i've been gaining muscle so the number on the scale has gone up a few pounds. I know tht muscle good, fat bad and the scale doesn't mean anything but I feel like it does. Going home this weekend. I called Jenni to tell her. I want to call Ashley to see if she wants to go out but i don't have any money so I know I can't. I miss hanging out with everyone sometimes. But i do know that I'm pretty much over it. My life there is slowly fading - and I'm kinda glad i'm losing interest. It was in a way holding me back. The guilt of leaving friends and such. but i know i don't belong there. So it goes. re-reading my fav stranger in a strange land (obviously the namesake for this blog) and i forgot how much i REALLY love that book. It's just so awesome and astounding. I've decided to re-read some of my favs this month and next month - i think I'm going to do the Electric Kool-Aid Acid test, then maybe brave new world again. i probably should get cracking on some of the books julie gave me - i re-read a wrinkly in time and tried the Claiming of Sleeping beauty which was awesome.  Okay so this has been a pretty trite post. But hey, I needed to break up the monotony of self-loathing, perpetual disgust and overall depressed mood of this blog right?

      Cash cold that's what I need These bill colectors they ring my phone They bother me when I'm not at home Ain't go no time to be fooling round Feel touch the floors and I get on down, you see  I want money lots and lots of money I want the pie in the sky I want money lots and lots of money So don't be asking me why  I WANNA BE RICH  - "I Wanna Be Rich" - Calloway   Stress levels increasing boys and girls. I decided to get out of my fit of denial and look at my bank accounts.  First account, overdrawn by $55.46. Not too bad. Maybe mom could give me something to cover that when she puts in money for cable and gas. Next account, overdrawn $351.23. Okay so that's bad. Mom can't give me that much money.  I'm trying to figure out my budget for next month, incorporating those fees, and i'm going to figure out how to survive off of $999.67. Hmmm. Does anyone see a problem? Well bills alone come to $1067. That doesn't even take into account, groceries, gas for car, electricity, and eating out or going out are complete jokes. Yeah right.  It sucks because I've been having to borrow from each paycheck with my discret, to pay for gas for the car and food at lunch time (because I can't afford to go to the damn grocery store). So that puts me in the whole about $150 by the end of the month. Coupled with being overdrawn every month, I just can't fucking catch up.   I just got the promotion and the raise, which isn't much but it will DEFINITELY help. Bad news, it won't kick in until the May pay date (May 26). That's 2 paychecks away. I don't know how I'm going to make it. I asked our accountant if she could maybe move the hire date up so that I might be able to have my raise effective by April... hopefully this will work cuz I'm about to start prostituting myself.

      I could be like you I could be alone and jaded Wondering what to do  To make them pay  I could be like you Angry and intoxicated Wondering what to do  Until they say  Will I find a way? I cannot make them say I cannot make them say  Make them all believe they're wrong Really wrong That their intentions don't belong  I hear you talk the talk, but I, don't see you walk the walk And I still don't believe a thing you say.  -"Walk the Walk" - Face 2 Face     Got a postcard from Julie on Saturday from Sedona. It was good to hear from her and know that she's finding beauty out there in this world.  I miss her.  but it's good to know that she's making her way and finding inspiration everywhere. I'm still looking for that.   I fell off the wagon with my prosperity plan and now I have to start the damn thing all over again. I guess I'll find time to do it this week. I said that in 2004 I amd going to stop being a lazy procrastinator. So far it's worked with a lot of things but not this one.  I'm supposed to go for coffee tonight with Shannon - haven't seen her in almost a year. I kind of have mixed feelings about the whole thing. I really want to appear cute and successful so that everyone at CWLA knows that I'm still a superstar even though I'm not in pr anymore.  That time in my life was such a different one, and the ways i view everyone from that place have changed signigicantly. I hope it will be okay.  Jaclyn and Tim are back together and I have to admit the air of lonliness has once again swept into my room, making the air cold and frigid.  It sickens me when they are together. Which makes me sick because I don't like holding contempt for anyone. Least of all someone who is allegedly one of my best friends. I guess it just makes me mad and depressed that someone so selfish, so self-obsorbed and uncaring gets to win the prize and find love. I have so much to offer, so much love to give to someone, anyone who promises they will love me too.   but blah blah...when will I start LIVING life instead of reflecting on the inconsistencies and lacking of my being?

      Consider the odds,  consider the obvious.  The martyr is meaningless,  the campaign has died in the planning stages  and the fallen faces are the singular proof that it was ever alive.   This purchased rebellion has been outdated, denounced and rescinded and left to die  championless.  I begged you not to go.  I begged you, I pleaded.  Claimed you as my only hope and watched the floor as you retreated.    -"The Good Fight" - Dashboard Confessional  To you, my little flower, rootless, in search of the perfect place to plant herself. I thought of you last night.  It was one of those nights where my only friend lives in the liquor cabinet in my kitchen.  I felt so alone. No one home. Nothingness surrounding me. I wanted to call you because I know that you would understand. Not understand but - listen to me without judgement. And maybe you couldn't make it all better right then and there, every time i've reached out to you for help, you've given me strong words that I find undulating in mind.  It's funny how those relationships you realize are important, don't strike you as crucial until you're staring down at the bottom of an empty glass, perched on your kitchen sink, melancholy words of Dashboard and Cobain pounding in your ears.  I miss you. I think your the first attempt at a best friend I've really ever had. I have those people who have earned the title out of convenience, but who I've never shared words with. Those friends who I feel the need to keep my thoughts and dreams from.  I hope that you're well, and these words find you.  Thanks for being there these past few months - hurry up and find yourself and come back!

      So quiet another wasted night,  the television steals the conversation  Exhale, another wasted breath,  again it goes unnoticed.   Please tell me you're just feeling tired Cause if it's more than that I feel that I might break out of touch, out of time.  Please send me anything but signals that are mixed  cause I can't read your rolling eyes out of touch, are we out of time?   Close lipped another goodnight kiss is robbed of all it's passion,  your grip, another time, is slack it leaves me feeling empty.   I'll wait until tomorrow  maybe you'll feel better then maybe we'll be better then  so what's another day when I can't bear these nights of thoughts of going on without you  this mood of yours is temporary  it seems worth the wait to see your smile again  out of the corner of your eye wont be the only way you'll look at me then.    - "Again I Go Unoticed" - Dashboard Confessional          not much to say of late. Just been musing, thinking about my age old dilemas while stuck in the jello of NOW. wanting my life to just START. i want to start working toward something, being something. I wish i could just flash forward to next year, looking forward to beginning a new life in grad school or Teach for America or wherever the next year is destined to take me. The waiting is driving me insane - i can't believe i've made it this long already.  crossing my fingers that my worst nightmares haven't come true. i've gotten a whole heap of new responsibilites at work. i am officially in charge of the network of kid testing at the lab...supposed to meet with Dr. Baker sometime at the end of this week to discuss everything that went on during the staff meeting and what exactly will be my duties. Sinking pit in the bottom of my stomach says i've just been caught - like a little fly in a trap. trapped into the ever increasing pile of work, but alas i don't see a raise in the crystal ball. don't know how much longer i'm going to be able to fake survival. my bank account is so severely overdrawn it will need a continuous IV drip of cash to revive it back to consciousness. cable, gas are due and i've no idea where the money will come from. mom just gave me money to cover the difference for rent and therapy. but i've got therapy next week too. with the way things are going definitely need it. speaking of therapy, that's been interesting. i'm feeling pretty connected to this one, delving into the depths of childhood. She used a new word "neglect." Never really thought about it. i guess i just assumed leaving a 7,8,9 10 year-old home alone for hours upon hours upon hours with nobody but her dolls and the tv was the norm of the 80's. she says i never really had the chance to form meaningful relationships with others and it's no surprise that i always feel lonely. okay, well at least there's a start. wishing this week was over. going to be a make-up model at Fred Segal this weekend - i'm only going cuz i get to keep the make-up they use on me and i'm definitely running low.

      been thinking about writing again. I guess talking with Julie about her upcoming adventures has got me thinking about it. It's always one of those things to me, something that everyone says I'm good at, but since it's not my "chosen" talent I tend to disregard it. O-well. I submitted a few different fiction pieces to a couple of some online literary journals that were looking for freelancers. To tell you the truth, I really just need additional income so if I can start freelancing that would be great. I kinda would like to freelance some press materials since we all know the infinite wisdom I have writing those. I guess we'll see.  Supposed to go out with Lauren, Erin and Erica tonight. Haven't seen Erin since New Year's. I think it's amazing that she's the only friend from high school (that I actually hung out with in high school) that I'm still friends with. I know we're growing apart but still trying to hang on. What about the human condition makes us cling to others so desperately?  Going to start that whole prosperity meditation thing either today or tomorrow. Really need some balance in my life. I'm not sure if it's possible for me to have balance right now with all the topsy turvy things I've been trying to deal with. Onward, ho!

      Drivin’ faster in my car Falling farther from just what we are Smoke a cigarette and lie some more These conversations kill Falling faster in my car  Time to take her home Her dizzy head is conscience laden Time to take a ride It leaves today no conversation Time to take her home Her dizzy head is conscience laden Time to wait too long To wait too long These conversations kill  To much walkin’, shoes worn thin Too much trippin’ and my soul’s worn thin Time to catch a ride It leaves today, her name is what it means To much walkin’, shoe’s worn thin   "Big Empty"- Stone Temple Pilots  Good ol Richie is gay sports fans. Oh no, he did everything to try to prove that he WASN'T including flat out telling me that people think he is and trying to kiss me at the end of the night...but well, he's just not doing it for me. I guess unless a guys is a big fat obnoxious jerk then I don't like him. Well, that's not true either but I like some one who makes me feel pretty and feminine, not someone that I have to battle for competiton.  Felt so down this morning listening to Velvet Revolver on Kevin and Bean. Funny how the remnants of STP and GnR have now formed this fucked up "quasi band"...they played their new single and 1 STP song (interstate love song) and some GNR song (i love her so i had to kill her? not sure about that one) and it just made me think how everything is changing. How i"m ready for change. How, even though I'm desperately trying to live in the NOW, the looming possibility of the future continues to glimmer in the horizon.  I am only being human - dissatisfied with my present condition, nostalgic about the past, and frightfully hopeful about the future.  Suzette was telling me that I should really take the GRE in July. So I guess I should register for that when I get some money...but of course I have none of that right now.  I feel really gross and disgusting because I had sopes for lunch. I envision myself 500 lbs. with little kids throwing chocolate piggies at me...i think i'm going to try yoga at the gym tonight and maybe some cardio. I really want to go out and get drunk, maybe make out with some random guys...we'll see if i can convince jac or lauren or kellie to go out with me.

      So sore. Yuck. I've hit rock bottom and I'm on this kick-me-in-the-ass workout and diet plan. no fun. But i'm tired of looking the way that I do. I've started again with my "if onlys" and well...i can't help but remember when I came back to school senior year after losing all that weight during the summer and how much attention i got from the boys. yes, it's pretty disgusting that so much of my life revolves around getting guys to like me but well..what can i say? i'm going to therapy.  I'm going out tonight with Richard for Cuban food. Hoping that during the past few weeks he's gotten some testosterone shots and is a little more manly. I would really like to be dating someone...but I can't do it if he's more of a chic than I am.

      She said don't let it go to your head. Boys like you are a dime a dozen. She said your a touch overrated Your a lush  And I hate it...  "You're So Last Summer" - Taking Back Sunday   So this weekend was a fun one. Wen to Rancho and hung out with everyone Friday and Saturday night. Friday night me, Jenni and Amy went to McAlan's. It was cool. Nothing too exciting. I met a guy named Andy from Delaware. He wasn't that cute or interesting but sounds good on paper. Anyway, just reminded me how underappreciated I am in Cali. Need to head out east where all the men will drool =)  Saturday night was Ashley's White Trash Trailer Bash party. It was very interesting. And of course, what everyone wants to know...Tom was there.  And of course I let him get to me. He was being cool and normal then starting say some things to fuck with me as always. I was telling Amy (?) how I wish there are so many things I would have never told him about me. I think that's what makes me so uncofortable. O-well.  One day soon I will let myself get over him. I was talking to Jenni and she was like "Maybe your just infatuated with him." Which is probably true although for some reason it hurt my feelings when she said that. This is the most annoying, dehabilitating infatuation anyhow so I wish it would just go away.  Did drugs on Friday and Saturday night which is so weird because I don't really find anything exciting about it. Jenni and Amy were saying that I talk more when I do drugs, but really, do I REALLY need to talk more? Most of the time I'm thinking I should probably shut up. Anyhow, my OD card is a'coming so I think I'll stop.  Really don't want to go to work tomorrow. Want to win the lottery. I'm so excited that the time to apply for programs is coming up. Not happy about taking the GRE's but the maddness of work, school and volunteering will at least not being so crazy and I might have a chance to breathe and sleep.

      So sick, so sick of being tired.  And oh so tired of being sick.  We're both such magnifacent liars.  So crush me baby, I'm all ears.  So obviously desperate, so desperatly obvious.  I'll give in one more time and feed you stupid lines all about "its basic..."   So sick, so sick of being tired.  And oh so tired of being sick.  Willing and ready to prove the worst of everything you said about.  So obviously desperate, so desperatly obvious.  So good at setting bad examples.  Listen, trick, I've had all I can handle.   He's smoked out in the back of the van, says he's held up with holding on and on and on.   "You Know How I Do" - Taking Back Sunday  Well I had a good run. Last night and this morning have been feeling so down and depressed. Just feeling so worthless and confused again. Wishing life would start. Tired of being the same rut that I've been in for so long. I'm not sure what exactly I want to happen to make things better. I just know that I want them to be.   It's this sadness that you can't explain. Nothing has changed in my life- no sudden devestations or anything like that. Yet, I want to cry. I want to get in bed and not talk to anyone and just sit with my cocktail in hand and just be alone in my misery. Will my whole life be like this? These waves of sadness that are so pervasive. I don't want to be married and in a funk and my husband asks "What's wrong?" and my kids ask "What's wrong?" and my friends and co-workers and the bad boy at Brand X grocery store ask "What's wrong?" and it's all I can do to fight back tears because I know they don't like me and they're just being nice because their moms raised them to be that way.  The paranoia is killing me. I want it to stop. Or maybe I should stop wanting everyone to like me. I'm not quite sure which is easier at this point.

      Went out with Richard from Friendster yesterday. We went to see United States of Leland. This movie was so awesome. I seriously want to see it again. Can't wait to own it.  Wasn't attracted to Richard but he seems pretty cool and I wasn't embarrassed to be seen with him so hopefully he'll become a friend and we'll get to hang out. Or who knows, maybe I'll become attracted to him. I think he might be gay though, just hiding under the metrosexual label like our boy Seacrest Out.  It feels weird that I haven't really been writing or doing much of anything lately. I've been so focused on school and work and getting stuff done. Amazing how productive life can be once you stop feeling stop feeling the need to eat, drink, and cry all the time. Who knew?  Went to Jenny's housewarming party on Saturday night and got into a crazy philosophical debate about "nothing." I now believe (somehow I've conviced myself) that nothing doesn't exist. Once you conceptualize nothing, it becomes something. I don't know, just ponder it for a while.  Also started my new philosophy of American society. I have now come to the conclusion that all of America has "shared delusional disorder." This is when one person transfers his or her delusions onto others.  Just think about some of the nonsense that you see and hear.

      This was forwarded to me by a group I belong to called A.N.S.W.E.R. I felt that it was so powerful and strong that I would post it on my blog for people to read. Whether or not you agree with my views, please take a moment to read this. It may not change the way you think but for some of you, I hope it will enlighten you to those of us who shun the propoganda and demand explanations. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  A.N.S.W.E.R. Response to Bush press conference:  SPRING & SUMMER OF PROTEST & RESISTANCE TO THE OCCUPATION OF IRAQ   Although he rejected the analogy between Iraq and Vietnam, George W. Bush is closely following the script of Johnson and Nixon during the Vietnam War. While predicting that the U.S. would be ultimately victorious, the administration is in fact desperately preparing for an escalation, including the sending of more troops to suppress the rebellion in Iraq. In fact, Bush announced tonight (April 13) that he is ready to send thousands more U.S. troops to Iraq. He denied that the rebellion in Iraq was based on a popular insurgency. He also admitted that the original rationale provided for the war - the elimination of Iraq's purported weapons of mass destruction - was no longer the stated reason for the U.S. invasion. A.N.S.W.E.R. has always argued that the elimination of Iraq's so-called weapons arsenal was simply a pretext for an imperial foreign policy objective.   This is altogether reminiscent of the conduct of the Johnson and Nixon administrations during Vietnam. They lied to the people about the purpose of the war, the conduct of the war, endlessly tried to assuage public opinion by promising that there was a light at the end of the tunnel, and as the adventure encountered the stiff resistance of the Vietnamese people, they were compelled to regularly increase the number of troops sent to the conflict.   Bush's speech tonight espoused the worst kind of national chauvinism and racism. He asserted that the ongoing assault against the Iraqi people is part of the struggle by the "civilized world" against the Iraqi insurgents.   Bush is trying to convince the people of the United States that U.S. military operations in Iraq are directed against a small number of "fanatics" and "terrorists." He said that the war, which has taken tens of thousands of lives, was justified even though he admitted that no weapons of mass destruction had been found. The new rationale for this war of aggression, according to Bush, was that "we're changing the world."   The A.N.S.W.E.R. Coalition is initiating intensified actions at the local, regional and national level in the coming weeks and months to widen the popular movement that demands "Bring the troops home now, End the occupation of Iraq." A list of these activities can be found below. The popular mass movement that is sweeping Iraq in opposition to occupation, along with the worldwide anti-war movement, will grow in the weeks and months ahead. It is noteworthy that the Bush administration has, in tonight's speech, adopted at least in part the political program proposed by John Kerry. Kerry and now Bush are calling for an expanded role for NATO military forces in order to subdue the resistance inside Iraq.   Only the people's movement can create an effective challenge to the plans to impose U.S. empire in Iraq, Afghanistan, Palestine, Haiti, the Philippines, Korea, Cuba, Venezuela, Zimbabwe, Colombia and among all those in the world who desire to be independent and sovereign.   The people of the United States are disgusted that the government spends hundreds of billions of dollars to kill people in the Third World, occupy their land, and use U.S. soldiers as cannon fodder in the enterprise. At the same time, the administration slashes funds for education, healthcare, housing, jobs and other vitally-needed social programs.   The Spring and Summer of Protest and Resistance began last weekend with a nationwide outpouring in more than 60 U.S. cities (between April 9 and 12) in response to an emergency call to action initiated by the A.N.S.W.E.R. Coalition. The A.N.S.W.E.R.-initiated call to action drew tens of thousands of people into the streets on short notice and received widespread media coverage. See www.internationalanswer.org/news/update/041104a10press.html for a report and press coverage. These demonstrations illustrate the commitment of thousands of activists across the country and around the world to continue to build the movement against the occupation of Iraq, as well as the rising tide of public opinion to bring the troops home now. In response to the emergency call for protests, many groups will be continuing to carry out emergency anti-war actions in the coming days and weeks.   JOIN THE SPRING & SUMMER OF PROTEST & RESISTANCE! See below for a calendar detailing actions against the occupation of Iraq taking place over the next five months:   APRIL 25:  The A.N.S.W.E.R. Coalition supports the April 25 mass mobilization in Washington DC to defend women's rights and reproductive freedom. The Bush administration and the ultra-right are working to overturn the gains the women's movement has made over the last thirty-five years. Women have the right to control their own bodies and their lives. A.N.S.W.E.R. is organizing an anti-war contingent in the March for Women's Lives. The main assembly for the demonstration will be on the National Mall (between 3rd and 14th Sts.) at 10 am, with a march beginning at 12 noon. The anti-war contingent will have two meeting locations before assembling on the Mall: (1) 7th St. between Madison Dr. and Constitution Ave. NW and (2) 7th St. between Jefferson Dr. and Independence Ave. SW. You can also meet up with the contingent at our banner in the main assembly area on the Mall on the southeast corner of 7th St. and Madison Dr. NW.   MAY 1:  Nationally-coordinated demonstrations, rallies, teach-ins, and forums on the anniversary of George W. Bush's declaration of the end of major combat operations in Iraq. May 1 was the date that George Bush dressed up like a soldier, flew onto the aircraft carrier U.S.S. Abraham Lincoln, and posed for that disgusting photo op where he could claim credit for the conquering of Iraq. Far from having ended major military combat, the war in Iraq only intensified. More U.S. soldiers have been killed or wounded since May 1 than during the invasion phase of the war. Nearly 10,000 soldiers have been evacuated from Iraq for wounds and other injuries. Tens of thousands of Iraqis have been killed, and in the last week the Bush administration executed a bloodbath as a form of collective punishment for the people of Fallujah and elsewhere throughout Iraq. The May 1 anniversary will be marked by nationally-coordinated activities - demonstrations, rallies, teach-ins, and forums exposing the lies of the Bush administration.

This new calendar - at www.VoteNoWar.org/events.htm - has been designed to support the efforts of grassroots and national event organizers.   Event organizers can reach the hundreds of thousands of people who visit the VoteNoWar web site every month, and activists can find out about progressive events of interest to them. It's easy to use, just select your state from the graphic map of the U.S., and you'll be taken to this month's calendar. Organizers of events of national or regional interest can post their event to a single calendar, and it will automatically appear on every affected state/local calendar.   Special features include the ability for users to sign up to be automatically notified if the location, date, time or specifics of an event that is of interest to them changes. Because e-mail privacy is so important, e-mails are not disseminated even to event organizers. The system automatically dispatches an update when a change to that event is posted. You can be assured that you'll know of important changes to an event that interests you without having to be added to a new e-mail list.   For organizers, this provides a mechanism to update people who are interested in your event, should changes occur, even reaching people who may not be on your email list.   The calendar has just been added to the VoteNoWar web site, so events are now just about to be posted. For event organizers, now is the time to visit the VoteNoWar National and Local Event Calendar. For event attendees, come back regularly to see the new events that may be of interest to you.   --------------------------   A.N.S.W.E.R.

      Nothing much has been happening in the world of NCW. Just chillin like a villain, trying to keep everything straight.  I met a new "friend" on Friendster. He contacted me and we've been chatting. It's been pretty cool. We seem to have a lot in common. We might be going out to catch a movie some time this week so that will be interesting. I officially got the volunteer position at Our House. I will be doing a "Littles" group, ages 4-8 so that's pretty cool. I'm trying to start pepping myself up because I know this grief support crap is going to be pretty hard. Hung out with Jenni a bit this weekend. She broke it off with Neil and so now I officially have my first friend that's a single mom. So weird. They're still living together and the situation is so crazy. On one hand i want them to be together but then I know she can do so much better so whatevs. Ashley's birthday party is in two weeks so now it's all about the soul prepping cuz i know Tom will be there of course. I'm determined to have a good time and not worry about him. Not sure of the exact means but I'll figure it out.

      Woke up this morning with a tight feeling in my chest. 10 years. 10 years. 10 years. I gazed longingly and the black and white which hung silently on my wall. 10 years. 10 years. 10 years. The smoke in the photo seem to float out of the distant past and into my room, suffocating me. I began to cry. The emotion that I haven't felt in weeks burst throught with a vengeance. 10years.  Could it really have been 10 years ago, when I was in eighth grade...thinking about ending my life rather than face the girls who threatned to kill me once I set foot at Rancho? Could it have been 10 years since I spent hours with earphones in my ears, sitting silently on the floor, letting the music pound while tears rolled down my face? Could it have been ten years since the soothing voice of one made me feel real - like someone really understood what is was like to be in pain?  Kurt's death. Ten years ago. The songs are still in my heart, in my CD player - always in the rotation. His picture hangs across from my bed - the first thing I see when I wake, and the last before i drift off to the better world of dreams. If only he knew...if only he knew what a legacy he left. If only he knew how his voice and his songs and his words and how HE touched us all. How we needed him. We needed him to sing for us. We needed him to tell mom and dad we know that we fucked up their lives, to say that no, I don't like myself and no, i'm not like you and i never will be. we needed him to pine over the love, we needed him to make the pain real.   We miss you.

      Spent most of today sleeping and reading. Have two midterms this week..it's so weird to actually STUDY and READ the material. Didn't do this the first time around. O-well.  So sad..Tracy called me last night cuz she was out in LA and wanted to know if I wanted to go out. My phone kept ringing and I just put it on silent because I thought she was in Rancho and was just drunk dialing me for no reason. Kinda sad though. I thought it was nice for her to call...she and I have the most in common I guess. She went to SDSU, joined DG and is just living her life Rancho-free most of the time. She still gets caught up in the drama like I do. I think I'm going to make an effort to be better friends with Tracy. I wonder where she's moving after graduation...  I'm starting to notice some changes in my weight so that's good. I worked out long and hard today and it felt okay. I still don't like working out but I like the fact that I know, if I keep on I'll look hot. Warped tour is a'coming...  I haven't been feeling much of anything lately. I'm not sure how I feel about that (hee hee FEEL). I think that I really am so doped up I'm not beginning to notice things. I notice things happening but it's like I just don't give a fuck anymore. it was so funny. I'm sitting alone today. Jaclyn has been gone for days..no clue where she is..but usually when she's out gone for a long time I start feeling sad. Start wishing I had a boyfriend. wish that i wasn't alone. Whatever, you've all read the blogs. But today..the thought really didn't cross my mind. I mean it did but...I felt no need to hit the bottle, or throw on my Cure or Dashboard. Just thought, "Hey, I never saw Harry Potter, think I'll watch that."  Which by the way, was not that bad. I'm kinda excited that the Chamber of Secrets or whatever is on rotation on HBO this month. Think I'll have to catch it.  But I am still kind of sensitive to people not liking me or being upset with me. For example..Friday? I felt llike Karina had a problem with me all day. She was being snippy and kind of cold. At least that's how I felt. I don't know if that was really the case. I still need to work on my perception of events. But hey, that's what therapy is for right?  So this guy Rob that contacted me on Yahoo just called. I told him that I was on my way out to meet a friend and if I could call him later. Lies! All lies! I'm just scared. I've had bad experience after bad experience with this online dating crap. I'm just not ready or in the mood for another one. Plus, he lives in San Diego, he's 32 and just a host of other potentially bad things. Yuck. Maybe I'm just not at the point in my life to actively be open to all dating experiences. well, open to dating experiences that I can't control somehow. ooohhh, control! bad word! but just not meeting a stranger in cyberspace. It's freaky. I don't think I'll ever get used to it. But I tried it so hey...  my goal this month, beat the fucking Bart level on Simpsons Hit & Run for Playstation...onward, ho!

      Not much has been happening lately. I've still been feeling...but under the 400 mg of Wellbutrin that courses through my bloodstream daily, I haven't the energy to care about being depressed. Maybe that's what anti-depressants are supposed to do. Not make you stop feeling blue, but make it so you don't give a damn about it anymore.  I'm on this crazy workout kick right now. Keep tossing envious looks at skinny chickies that cross my path. I want to be her! Then I promptly wallow in my sorrow surrounded by Domino's and chocolate malted crunch. I'm going to Warped Tour this year (yay). All my boys are going to be there - Thursday, Yellowcard, Taking Back Sunday, Allister...the list goes on and on. I want to be HOT for this event so now it's all about working out and stuff. Plus if I ever visit Julie in Hawaii I kinda want to look hot for that to.   Anyhow...Kellie seems to be cool with me so that's fine. Whatevs. Wasn't losing sleep over it. I think I'm finally giving up my man hunt. I'm just tired of caring. Over it. It hurts too much. Maybe if i just focus on school and what not I can drown out the pangs of lonliness.

      No one could see me I fell into yesterday Our dreams seemed not far away I want to stay I fell into fantasy  "The Days of the Phoenix" - AFI  Reading Julie's post of late made me long for a place less pretentious as LA. Just the sweet simple of "will you be my girl?" made me long for the days when it was just that easy. When you had butterflies in your stomach because he was just that cute, and you kissed and it was right. Now my nights are filled with slobbery, drunken kisses, clumsy attempts to feign passion. I long to be with someone. A relationship so innocent and pure. Exciting and novel. Not tainted by hidden agendas and games. I guess that's what keeps me from wholeheartedly trying to really put myself out there while I'm here. I know nothing, no one, is for me here.  It's times like these when my mind goes back to thinking about Bill. i know in my heart he was the one. well, no I can't say that he was the "one" but he's about as close to everything I've every wanted. I think out of every guy I've been with, I miss him the most.  It's been a little over a year since we parted but I still can't help but wonder what he's doing. Is he still in Calif? Is he seeing someone new? I don't think anyone has ever looked at me the way he did. It was perfect.  there are so many things that were just fucked up about our relationship and the timing was shit but all I can do is hope that I'll find something that pure again.

      We will shut you out We'll put you in doubt If you think that you're special We'll tell you who you are We'll tell you that you're close but no cigar  BUT I DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT... IT MORE THAN I'LL ACCEPT  I don't care where I belong no more What we share or not I will ignore And I won't waste my time fitting in Cause I don't think contrast is a sin  "No Cigar" - Millencolin  I refuse to let them get the best of me. I refuse it. They haven't broken me yet. You've tried over and over and over. The obstacles always seem to be more than I can take but I'm still here - older and wiser. I can do it. I just have to keep focused and know that I'M NOT the one who's wrong. I'm NOT the one who's delusional, who's incompetent, who's freak. I'm in the right. Even if I'm by myself right now on my soapbox there will be others eventually. I may not be happy now but at least I still retain some essence of me. Without it I'm nothing.

      I see you clinging Sterotyping Just to feel comfort Just to belong Desperate for meaning To make sense of your life Let me try to make you understand You've got it wrong  You're not going to catch me Waving flags over my head Looking straight and standing tall I refuse to build the wall by adding my own bricks that separate us all I'd rather die than be apart of your pride  This ain't the homeland  They've writtn books on Never have been there How would you know? Following footsteps that will  get you nowhere And living by some rules That were made up 100 years ago  You're not gonna find me Digging through my family tree Just to find out who I am I don't need to know  That I'm linked to some murder To live on the same land I'd rather die than be apart of your pride  Can't change the future while living in the past So do what you want I'll just write my own history.  "Pride" - No Use For A Name  Not much to say today. Just hanging out making some mix cds for the party. I'm kinda hoping this weekend goes by fast. Just thinking about the future for the year. Actually pretty excited about some of my plans. Going to find out when our lease exactly ends. Whenever that does and I move back I'm going to ask if I can go 50 percent. Then I could still have benefits for a little longer. And I wouldn't have to stress myself out going to LA everyday.  Also if I can get a serving job then I'll have that money plus still a decent salary from the twin lab. I figure if I can go 50 percent starting in November I could probably stay there until about April or May instead of February.  It would just be good because by then I'll know about grad programs or whatever. I guess we'll just have to see what happens.  Going to a bbq at kellie's today. i'm not too excited about it but it should be pretty okay. Food! Plus I'm going to see Saved! tonight with Lauren, Taylor and maybe Karina so that's pretty exciting because I've been dying to see that. Woo hoo!  Decided that starting tomorrow I'm going on a strict diet. Warped tour is in a month and I swore i was going to be hot and skinny by then (just cuz I'm going with a bunch of hot and skinny girls!) but I don't think that's possible in a month. But I'm going to ask Karina on Tuesdsay if she'd share the basics of her diet with me. I think if I could follow-up something that strict for at least a month I would lose at least 10 lbs and I'd be pretty satisfied with that for the time being. We'll see.  Talked to Julie for a quick sec last night. She sounds like she's doing well. I hope that she realizes she's where she needs to be right now. i think she might just be a tad scared about jumping into the singing thing full force. She's fantastic and could really make it. I don't know. I'm not her but I think that she might be afraid to put herself completely out there. I know i would. When something is such a part of you, when it IS you how could you voluntarily put yourself in the path of possible rejection? O-well. I really hope she stays in Milwaukee because I know it's there (not Hawaii or Austin or wherever) that her dream is going to get the most fuel.

      Is this a sign Of what I'm made of Or how I allow myself to be treated?  "Strangled" - Osker  We learned in abnormal psychology that the primary cognitive processes of people who suffer from depression are 1) helplessness (bad things happen and there's nothing I can do about it) and 2) hoplessness (bad things will happen no matter what and no one can change that). We also learned that people suffering from depression view events as global (everything), static (never changing) and internal (all my fucking fault).  I'm depressed. Obviously. We all know that. But do you really? Do you really know what it feels like to swim in these feeling and emotions every day? To really want to change. I mean REALLY want it - so bad that you can see it, smell it, taste it, imagine it but yet it seems so intangible.   I'm tired of justifying and explaining. I can't make anyone understand. I had a talk with Jenni last night about things. She basically reiterated plenty of things that I already know about myself - I have low self-esteem, I let guys walk over me and treat me like shit, I am basically my own worst enemy.  Know all of that, sports fans. And that's the disgusting part. I realize, I see, I loathe all of these things about me. I recognize my thoughts as irrational but yet they swallow me whole. It's like an addiction. Something you know isn't right but you can't shake it.   I know many of you think I don't want to be "happy." Well, first, I don't believe in happiness as an end, only a state through which we pass many times throughout the course of our lives. Happiness is not an entity that can be won or a place where you can take up residence and live. It's a place you come to, where you can return, where some people spend a lot of their lives.  Happy is an abstract concept to me. I'm not quite sure what people say when they tell me to "be happy." Do they mean, not worry? Well, give me the winning lottery numbers so that I can have financial freedom. Then I won't have to "worry" about paying my bills and rent and eating or whatever. Do they mean to have self-love?  Give me the tools I need to learn how to love my self, because I sure as fuck don't know how. When one grows up in isolation, with no guidance except for music videos and re-runs of sit-coms, that person doesn't know the first thing about how to build meaningful relationships. How to ask for help. How to be intimate. How to share feelings.   I fake it because it's easier. It's easier to nod and smile than pour my heart to deaf ears. It's easier to pretend then to be chastised and ridiculed. It's easier to think no one loves me that to have my heart ripped out and trampled upon time after time. It's easier to praise my faults and to make those reasons to push others away than to face the reality rejection.   I don't know what fucked me up. I can't point to a relationship or a person or a rock song. I just know that i'm trying. Every day I wake myself up and face the world hoping the new day will be different. And that's it. All I can do is try.

      You can't be right You're full of prejudice and spite You think you've got me pegged  But you're wrong  I am someone Who'll burn the whole world down I'm the one to bring it right around You're giving up on me But what else have you got?  "Resignation" - Face to Face  I'm so fucking pissed and upset I just can't control it.  This whole thing at work is making me crazy. I just can't believe it.  I'm not a mean person. There is no malice in my heart.  All I want is to do my fucking job, be competent, and chill.  Whatever. I don't need the baby's mama drama of our lab. It's making me sick and I'm tired of it.  I'm tired of listening to adults bitch and moan everyday about a mean supervisor that they're too scared to approach so they let her speak to them like they are farm animals. I'm tired of walking on eggshells, i'm tired of having to justify everything I say and do, tired of being compliant, tired of figuring it out and finding creative solutions.  I'm tired of feeling scared when I open my e-mail or hear thick heels clacking down the hallway.  I'm not having it boys and girls.  I don't play this game. I have enough problems in my life without having psychotic co-workers make me feel bad about myself.   And the sad part is it's not going to end. I'm going to have to endure this hell until December.  I love the people I work with but this one makes me want to slit my writsts and say goodnight.  And the way everyone bows down to accomodate her makes me want to pop half a bottle of traz and wash it down with bacardi and diet.  I was talking to Karina and she made me feel a little better but I feel like I fucked up and I dropped the ball. It's taking everything in me to maybe think that I didn't do anything wrong.   Besides that I got my group today and had a great time! I love them. they are soooo rambunctious...and really young. We have mostly 4,5, and 6 year olds. But they're so cute and fun it's so sad why I have to meet them. But I'm hoping that my presence will help.  woo hoo the weekend is a'coming! I need a drink!

      feeling a little bummed today. I had my interview at the Jonathan Club and I thinkthe lady really like me and probably would have hired me...except...my availability wasn't what they needed. So here I am still second jobless. Depressed as all fuck. $394 overdrawn and not to sure what the hell I'm supposed to do anymore.  Part of me just says I'll just have to get used to being overdrawn until I move out in December. I don't like that. I don't like being hungry and knowing I can't by food. I don't like people asking me if I want to do something and I can't because I don't have the money. I don't like wondering how far I can go on one gas tank, if wamu will let me overdraw just a little more so I can buy some tampons. It sucks. My mom tries to help but she's in just as much financial debt as I am so what can she really do?  I saw this advertisement today on the parking structure and it was looking for female "escorts" which, from the way this sounded, kinda made it sound like a call girl. And what's even worse, I took one of the little tear of numbers and thought seriously about calling. Still seriously thinking about calling.   This weekend should be kinda fun. Jenni is supposed to come out on Friday night and we'll go out. I'm thinking we can just pre-party pretty hard so I wont have to spend any funds. We'll see.

      I'm starting to fashion an idea in my head Where I would impress you With every single word I said It would come out insightful or brave, or smooth, or charming And you'd want to call me...  But for now I'll look So longingly Waiting... For you to want me For you to need me For you to notice me  "For You To Notice..." - Dashboard Confessional  Interesting weekend spent in San Diego for Lauren's grad party. Had a decent time but was pretty excited to just get sme sleep last night.  Received an interesting phone call Friday night. Well, I didn't get the message until Sat morning but Matt called me to say the he was out with Brad and Rusty and wanted to see if I wanted to come out with them. I was so dissapointed when I got the message - my dream man was calling me to see if I wanted to come out. Did some creepy crawling and found out that he didn't call Kellie so this was a "just me" call.  So of course I switch to "fantasy mode" and start thinking that maybe he's missing me and realizing what a good thing he passed by.  Then I read this article which said that we are usually pessimistic about things that have a good chance of happening and we are optomisitc about long shots. I don't think I need to interpret those results for you.  So Sunday I called Matt back just to say hey that I got his message. I invited him to the alcohol appreciation party but don't think he really gave a shit. He told me to call Brad which makes me think that Brad was the one who wanted me to come out in the first place. After all, he used to drunk dial me all the time. Anyhow, called Brad and left him a message and invited him to the party. Hopefully he'll bring Matt =)  Going to the interview at the country club tomorrow so kind of excited about that. Not excited that my little free time will now plummet to nada but excited that I might have extra money and not have to stress so much about paying bills. I guess we'll see.

      Remind you of anyone?    urlLink       You Attract  urlLink Bad Boys !  You're a bad girl, at least you'd like to think so.  So it's not surprising to find you on the back of some guy's Harley...  At 3 am, fresh from a club, going to his place to continue the night.    You demand little from men - besides continual entertainment - so you attract Bad Boys by the dozens.  And being that you're such a bad girl, chances are you'll break his heart before he breaks yours.  Sure he won't admit it, but his two week coke binge will tell you all you need to know.    Relish the very good times you have with your very Bad Boy - knowing that they probably won't cross the two week mark.  Never give him money, never ride without a helmet, and never let his even badder ex know where you live.     urlLink   What Kind of Guy Do *You* Attract?       urlLink More Great Quizzes from Quiz Diva

      I feel strangled I feel torn in torn in two Insufficent amounts of two Is this a sign of what I'm made of? Or how I allow myself to be treated?  "Strangled" - Osker  This is where I say enough That no one should ever feel the way that I feel now A walking open wound A jumping display of bruises And I don't believe that I'm getting any better  "Saints and Sailors" - Dashboard Confessional  Oh, it's a friday night and I'm alone. a visit from my good friend "alcohol" allows me to unwind and get back to the demons that haunt me. The ones that I tuck so neatly away each morn. They don't go away. I drug them away, I drink them away, I do whatever but they're still here. When I'm alone, without everyone and everything. When the day slows they're here to greet me. "Oh you thought you could leave us behind," they say. And with a devlish laugh I'm surrounded with no hope of escape.  "whoa...I'm not the one you want."  I try boys and girls. I really do. But you don't understand. They're always here. I live in the quicksand of depression...it's like the Nothing in Neverending Story...swallowing everything...  A bleeding misery O eternal discontent How consistent the only thing in my life is how I try To still this beating mind So that I can finally rest...   I got home and I put on some Cure and Dashboard and the first thing that came to my mind was Tom. I have no idea why. I really do wonder where my obsession with him came from.  I feel that maybe more has happened than even i can recall...i just feel so strongly about him and I feel like it will never go away. every time i see him (which hasn't been for almost a month now) I feel so...exposed..  So I'll wear glass shoes and plastic wrap No I'll just wear my insides You want to know who I really am? Yeah, so do I...  I was singing in my kitchen and I thought about when I went to St. Louis and Sarah and I were singing Midtown in the car while her boyfriend was driving and she tells him "Nicci can sing...she's really good when she tries.." and I knew she was talking about our emo/punk band "Suckerpunch" and the songs we were writing..and that meant so much to me. She has the best amatuer voice I've heard besides Julie and to hear her tell someone that was crazy times. I've never tried to be a singer so whatever..I guess it just meant a lot to me that someone could see the feeling I put into writing anything..songs, poetry, stories, whatever. I wish I  had a voice to touch others but i'm sure that one day I'll find my way to reach others.  I'm not bullshitting when I say I want to change the world. My mom and probably everyone else thinks I'm crazy. I'm not JC or anything but that's my goal. I want to change the world. To at least do all that I can while I'm here. I'm not going to be complacent. I'm not going to just live in my movie. It's too easy not to give a shit about anyone else, I like a challenge.   Through the strength of your arms I realized I was off the mark And all I really wanted Was a pair of interested ears I learned for every pause I was almost guarenteed  more time to speak It's always the selfish Who say that life is way to short I'm not looking to get old But I bet it'll happen anyway Now I look at my hands They don't move the same as two years ago I'm alone But I'm not lonely I have kinetic energy

      I'm losing my sight Losing my mind Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine Nothing's alright Nothing is fine I'm running and I'm crying  "Last Resort" - Papa Roach  It's been a long while since I've written, but the time has been slipping from me. No opportunity. I come home after a long day of running on the treadmill to nowhere, only to pass out once my head hits the pillow, carried softly to a dreamless black void. And then the nightmare begins again.  Nothing new has happend in my life of late. I have an interview at this country club in Santa Monica "The Jonathan Club" for a waitressing job. The thought of serving cocktails to spoiled rich brats all summer kind of irritates me but I need the money so I'm hoping that I get the job. My days and nights will then be indistinguisable, with the work and volunteering. All I can hope is that it's all worth it in the end.  Going to San Diego this weekend for Lauren's"family" graduation party. We're supposed to be going out that night so I hope that I meet some hottie that will think I'm beautiful.   Speaking of... Karina wrote the oddest  urlLink post  about me the other day. Well, at least it was odd to me. It's always weird to read how other people perceive you to be. I look at myself everday and I don't see anything that others claim to see. I don't see a beautiful girl. I don't see an ambitious, confident person. I don't see a friendly, giving spirit. I pretty much see a piece of shit. And it's my goal every day that I wake up, to figure out a way to turn this piece of shit into something worth caring about. Something that people will love. Someone that men will desire and women will want to be like, or at least be friends with. Someone that's balanced and happy and just okay.  I guess that's it. I just want to be okay.

        Went to a midtwon show last night..was so awesome! I really can't describe how much I love that band.   urlLink Lance's Hero    played again and the lead singer amped his flamboyancy up to the max. Thought him and the guitarist (not MY guitarist) were about to get it on. Saw two other new bands   urlLink Armor for Sleep   and  urlLink Your Enemies Friends  . Loved them! Going to by cds when I get money.  This weekend was super crazy with Lauren's party on Saturday and Tracy's graduation stuff in San Diego on Saturday.  Had so much fun but I've just been in a funky mood of late so I really didn't have as much fun as I probably could have. O-well...I'll write more later on.

      Hoping for the best  Just hoping nothing happens  A thousand clever lines Unread on clever napkins  I will never ask if you don't ever tell me  I know you well enough to know you never loved me   "Cute without the E (Cut from the Team)" - Taking Back Sunday  I'm sitting at work, holding back tears, trying to motivate myself to do my work and be polite. Right now I wish I were curled in a ball in my bed at home, watching CNN. Or maybe at Crunch, drowning my self in the oblivion of sweat and hurried pulses.   Spent yesterday filling out applications, trying to find a second job. I had to drop my summer class at SMC because I need the money, and I really need the availability for a 2nd job. It will make me a bit shy of some schools unit requirements but hopefully it won't matter all that much in the long run.  Driving to work today, listening Kevin and Bean, feeling the sun pour onto my skin, I thought how nice it would be to be in Prague or Canada or anywhere but los angeles. I wish I were lying lazily on the beach, soaking in the sun, feeling peaceful and content. But instead, here I am, hunched over a keyboard in a lab feeling dead and cold.  I'm going home tonight and I really don't want to see my mother. I'm supposed to do something with either Jenni or Ashley so I'm hoping I can literally walk in the house, drop my stuff off and turn back around. She's working this weekend so it's not like I have to spend any quality time, like we ever have that anyhow. I couldn't help thinking to myself last night that I will never be like this with my daughter. My therapist commented once that when i speak about my mom it's as if I'm talking about a stranger. And I kinda feel like that.  She called to tell me that I got a parking ticket and she was like "Are you in class?" I've only told her about five thousand times what days I have class, what days i volunteer, when I work blah blah but it's like she doesn't listen. She's so caught up in her own movie that nothing I say ever filters through. I try to tell her things, she cuts me off. I ask for help, she turns me away. Well I'm done. I'm done trying.

      Alone. I haven't felt so alone in quite a while. I went to group tonight, ready to quit tonight if I couldn't live up to their expectations. And, the kids remembered my name and Susan gave me one compliment after another and I was positively beaming when I left, ready to share my excitement with someone, but, no one to call. No one to say, O my I felt like shit all day but wow, someone thinks I am great. This is what I'm supposed to do. My mom was so mean to me yesterday. Just her telling me that she doesn't want to help me, that her life and her things are more important and can't I ask someone else to help?  Sure, mom. I'll get right on that one. Except, there isn't anyone else to ask. So, I tell her I'll handle it all and stare at the world, alone again.  I sit here, sipping my cocktail, getting ready to watch the end of Friends, and I feel so alone in the world. So lost. I just don't know where to go or what to do. And then Susan called me back and had to tell me about another thing she was impressed by my performance today and it made me feel so good but I had no one to share my happiness with. I could call a friend but, would they really understand or even care? How can you communicate everyday, non-monumental things to people who love you but, not like that?  The way Susan described my performance to me made me feel again that I'm going into the right type of work. It was so natural working with those kids.

      I'm sick of smiling And so is my jaw Can't you see my front is crumbling down? I'm sick of being someone I'm not Please get me out of this slump I'm sick of clapping  When I know I can do it better for myself I'm sick of waiting  Sick of all these words that will never matter  I can't help how I feel  "Understatement" - A New Found Glory  Oh yeah, I put the "A" there even thought they're too cool to use it anymore. Anyhow...yesterday I was all over the place. Had my orientation at Metropolitan State Hospital where I'm hoping to work in the Adolescent Program (child psychopathology). I'm really excited...I also had supervision for my grief group..that which I'm not so excited about. I feel like I've gotten into a role I wasn't asking for.  Richard asked me out AGAIN to go see, you won't even believe this, a FEMALE artists' exhibition put on by UNITED DIVAS.  I just don't even know what to say. I said I would go because it sound pretty cool - DJs and spoken word performances and stuff. But somehow I need to convey to him that I just want to be friends. I definitely don't want him to try to swoop in for another awkward kiss.  Going home this weekend and debating whether or not I should call Andy. Well of course I'm just going to wait for him to call but Ashley had a good point that I could totally just invite him out as a friend to hang out with us one night this weekend.  So maybe I'll do that. I'm not really motivated though.   Today is the 5th of May, my second favorite holiday. We're going to Acapulco for drinks after work but for some reason I'm not as excited as I thought I'd be. Just tired of living in monotony I guess. Ready for the drastic change of something.   I feel like I say that often and frequently. I want change. But then I ask myself: am I doing all I can to create change? I'm not really sure what else I can do. I'm tired of my body so I've been hitting the gym for an hour every morning. Saw the change when I tried on a jean skirt I bought months ago and it actually fits! Want change in my love life. So I accept every offer that I get for a date and try to put my self in situations that are beneficial to me meeting people. I wanted a career change so now I work full-time, go to two schools and volunteer at three places to change and make myself more marketable. But yet...  I feel stuck. I feel like I'm treading in jello, getting caught in the gelatin blob of life oozing around me. I don't feel progress. I feel me getting older but nothing getting better. I feel like everyone is making it to the finish line and I'm still at the starting blocks - on a treadmill with an 11.0 incline.  O-well. Enough lamentations for today.

      Some days I'm up, some days im down,  some days i dont give a fuck about anything Cause yesterday i gave everything, Now i want something back I wanna end it all, i wanna save the world,  I wanna take what was never mine, I wanna shout it all out to the world,  I wanna keep it all inside.  Here i am I'm just lookin for better days  the kind that never seem to come my way  I'm just part of all the madness here I know And everything I say or do won't ever change a thing When words have all been spoken and intentions smoked away I find myself in the same old shit again... Maybe today won't be the same,  Maybe I'll just stand my ground,  Maybe another time, another place, I'll float myself out of here under the influence of reality  Some days i drive myself insane, Some days I'm all I've got,  Some days I'm tired of seeing the world take everything I've got It's hard to get it right when doing wrong is all you know, I'll take my chance when tomorrow comes, with a little luck, I'll grow.  "Better Days" - Strung Out  It's so hot I feel like my insides are slowly melting out, pouring into the stoic white couch that I'm perched upon. I feel guilty. I ate three pieces of stuffed crust pizza, slowly washing it down with a cold Pacifico, hoping to eventually drown out more than the remnants of the grease. Food, my favorite friend, always there to make me feel warm and fluffy, then guilty for the indulgence. At this rate I'll never be skinny and cute. O-well that's for another day.  This MDD episode is lasting way too long this round. Maybe I just don't have as much patience. My eyes burn from trying to stop the tear ducts from turning on.  I want the heat to burn me out of existence, into another place and time. But, alas, I'm still here, quick wit and canned laughter filling my head from the background noise of the tv.   Tomorrow I'm supposed to go to Metro state hospital for the orientation. I'm supposed to start volunteering there. Although I have to admit I'm tired of trying. I'm tired of running from one place to another, stretching myself so thing...for what I might ask? I know i'm not going to get into any program but I keep holding my false sense of hope.   I'm so irritating to myself. As I hear these words echo in my head I am filled with disgust over the feelings that I have...over and over and over. How pathetic is my life really? Thanks for the kind words everyone. I wish I could believe them. I thank you all for being friends with someone so annoying. It must be tiring to constantly have to remind someone that they're not worthless.   Worthless...what's a human life worth anyway? What are any of us worth? Jane Bulman says one of the assumptive worlds that we hold is "the self is worthy."  Worthy of exactly what? What does worthy mean anyhow? Serena was saying how she doesn't like to eat at La Barca because of the disgusting things that  a few people have heard. And so I say, "So what? We're all going to die anyway." And she looked at me with such appall. Why is this statement such a shocker to everyone? Why is it, when I reply with this snappy retort, faces recoil in terror - OH NO! She didn't say.....DIE! Yes, boys and girls, the word for today is death. It's inevitable. It's going to happen. Can't beat the punch on this one sports fans.  Knowing that nothing I do or say will change anything. It all goes on.

      What else should I be? All apologies What else should I say? Everyone is gay What else should I write? I don't have the right What else should I be? All apologies In the sun I feel as one married...  All alone is all we are  "All Apologies" - Nirvana  This weekend has been so full of just stuff. I ended up going home to Rancho on Saturday...to go out with Andy, this guy that I met at McAlan's last week.  The date was decent. He was cute, in a very East Coast way, but I guess that's what I need to get used to. But anyhow, he was cordial and polite...we went to TGI Friday's for dinner and then McAlan's for drinks after. He's definitely manly - not like Richard! I'm not really sure I was all that into him, something about him kept irking me. We definitely clashed on a couple of philosophical issues but that wasn't the problem. He was just so...arrogant, but now I feel myself wanting him to call. What is it about the cocky, obnoxious guys that I like so much?  During Saturday day I had lunch with Jenni. We were going to the car wash and she mentioned that she read my blog and never realized how much I liked Tom.  I guess my paranoid delusions don't show as much as I think they do. But, even as I write this, I find my eyes starting to tear up, my chest tightening...I think I really need to find out what he symbolizes to me. There's nothing about him that I find all that attractive to still feel the way I do. I am repulsed by many things he's told me about himself and the ways in which he acts, yet, whenever I talk about him I still feel like I would pretty much give him anything he wanted of me. I know that somehow my mind has made some attachment and correlation with him and something...I just don't know what.  I was watching my Tivo'ed One Tree Hill and Tru Calling as Tim and Jaclyn strolled in from lunch and fun together. I don't think I want a serious relationship right now but I want that..I feel like I re-iterate the same things over and over and over...i want to feel loved...i want to be desired and wanted and lusted after and to have someone be excited to be with me...  I really don't know what's wrong with me today...maybe I really haven't been feeling better, just been sweeping the sadness under the rug of oblivion. What I wouldn't give for a cool run runner in my palm right now...sipping and slipping quietly into the serene would of unconsciouness.   Sometimes I just don't care.  I mean if I never went to work again, if I never called anyone again...would anyone notice? Would I be missed if I were gone? What do I bring to people's lives? Anything? Sometimes I wonder...

      Oh My. After a good four day run I'm breaking my diet to eat pizza with Jaclyn. I'm sorry. Just don't have the fucking will power. I tried on my cute Abercrombie jean skirt and it fits!!! Like looks good fits..not just I can fit it over my thighs fits. I'm going to be able to wear it to Warped tour on Friday..hopefully I don't gain all the fucking weight back from this pizza. Maybe I'll just have one or two slices and let her have the rest. Then I'm back on the horse tomorrow. Life is short.  Speaking of..I was driving home from work today and this lady was having a seizure in her car in the intersection of Jefferson and Vermont.  It was crazy. People were just honking at her, not realizing that she was convulsing. I pulled over and called 911 and the fire dept came. By the time they got there there was a nursing student and a pre-med dude helping to revive her. She just looked totally disoriented...i was so scared for her but glad she was okay. Glad I'm not affected by the bystander effect when apparently so many other people are.  Three day week...i'm so excited! i'm in need of a vacation. soooo tired of work. and testing. and everything. excited for a few days to just hang out and have fun! yay!  hoping i meet some hot guy on fri. just to have a drunken make out sesh with hot drums from taking back sunday or jordan's vocals from new found glory pulsing in the background. excited! woo hoo!

      Watching the Real World marathon today. Looking at Randy thinking I wouldn't mind spending the rest of my life with a guy like that.  Just a nice guy.  Sometimes I just sit and try to imagine what the guy I'll marry will be like. I can't even envision him. Does that mean I'm not destined to be with someone? I hope not.  I hope it just means that right now I can't even fathom the wonderful man that the universe has in store for me.   The world is such a weird place. I just look around all the time and it continues to baffle me. It just doesn't make sense. O-well.

      Pull your arms up around your knees And hide out inside your room Pretend you can't feel at all Just realize that I know how you feel now  If all I am Is a distraction for you Then I can't complain That you can't feel something for me  Take all you can find in me  "Being Walls" - Armor for Sleep   how is it payday and i have no money already? feel so down because one more month i will have to go with no money at all.  was sitting and listening to armor for sleep today and thought of Tom randomly. Well actually I was thinking about Matt, then that turned into wishing I was still with bill, then thinking that no matter how much i loved bill, he never intrigued me like tom did. i do have to admit that i haven' seen him for like 5 months or something and I definitely don't feel as I did before. I guess my heart just aches to feel that close to someone again. But not particularly him.  This weekend i have to work Saturday and sunday which I guess is kind of good because it will keep me from spending money I don't have.  I'll be doing enough of that next weekend. warped tour and the 4th...i'm so excited but i know it won't live up to the expectation in my head.  read julie's comment on my last entry and was thinking how much i miss her. she's a funny one. i don't think i've ever met someone who questioned their own judgement so much. she wants so bad to "live her dream" and doesn't realize it's happening to her right now. Sure, it's in Wisconsin and not filled with gold laquered confetti and streamers but it's happening.  Hey - does anyone know...who the fuck is Tom Landry? He's on all the cartoons on Fox and I've been wondering this for some time.

      So much has been going on lately. On Tuesday I went to my orientation at Metropolitan State Hospital. It was amazing. I was kind of nervous - they assigned me to a boys unit instead of a girls so I was worried. But once I got there I was overwhelmed with a sense of this was where my life's calling lie. Just peering through mounds of glass and barbed wire into the day hall, where boys, some as young as 12, some as old as 17, stared listlessly as big guards demanded the boys be quiet for at least 5 minutes before they could go get dinner.  I was immediately wisked into an inservice where a new boy's "behavior modification" plan was discussed. Basically how praise and positive incentives will be awarded to a boy in for CD, to help him stop his assaultive behavior. Apparently, on this plan, at his old unit he'd gone from hitting, kicking, and spitting at people 2-3 times a day, to 2-3 times a week. With excitement I stepped back into the main halls of the unit to be greeted by threats and profanities being shouted by one boys whose dessert had just been knocked onto the floor by the boy we had just met about. O-well, there goes his plan.  I was informed that I would be working with about 7 of the younger but more challenging boys (Age 12-14) on any project that I wanted. I've decided that I want to have them build mini-boats and then we'll have boat races. But I need more ideas so I welcome any suggestions.  I tested yesterday and was super annoyed by this spoiled brat who was so rude and condescending to me. I guess all I could think was this kid had EVERYTHING, and the night before I'd seen 17 boys who, for the most part, no one in the world wanted. And they have nothing. And they were so nice and excited to see who I was. It sickens me that this brat will have the "good" life and never once think about the kids who don't have moms and dads, who don't have new toys and clothes, or a place other than a psychiatric hospital to call their home.  I'm excited for no work tomorrow. I'm thinking of hitting the movies - by myself - to see Napoleon Dynamite and Farenhiet 911 if I can find it. We'll see.

      Darling, give me your absence tonight Take the shade from the canvas and leave the white Let me sink in the silence that echoes inside And don't bother leaving the light on Cuz I suddenly feel like a different person From the roots of my soul come a gentle coercion And I ran my hand over a strange inversion A vacancy that just did not belong The child is gone  help me out of this mess I'm a stranger to myself But don't reach for me, I'm too far away I don't wanna talk 'cuz there's nothing left to say  My darling give me your absence tonight Take all your sympathy and leave it outside Cuz there's no kind of loving that can make this all right I'm trying to find a place I belong  As the darkness turns into the dawn The child is gone  "The Child is Gone" - Fiona Apple       becoming a better person is an interesting process. what is better? is there a best? how do i know that I'm better than I was a little while ago? who decides if I'm better? worse?  went out last night with jaclyn and melissa and it was really weird. every guy I started to talk to kind of glossed over me..eyes quickly scanning Melissa..who's your friend? what's your friend's name? And just too tired to care or even be upset, I introduced drooling males to her and secretly snuck to the bathroom to take more swigs out of my flask. classy.  it was kind of odd because Melissa poked so many holes into my blonde ambition theory. i always figure, since all of my friends are blonde and thin and cute, and I'm not, and every guy wants that, it is to be expected that I get passed over. Nothing I can do about it. But melissa is dark and exotic - half japanese half filipina, small and curvy..very volumptuous. she's pretty but i feel like we're offering the same thing. so if someone picks her, it's like she's the better model or something.  i feel so unwanted but the pain is slowly beginning to dull. it's there all the time and finally i'm accepting the fact that i'm never going to be someone's first choice. i can just continue to be upset about it or i can just accept it and deal. it hurts. but it hurts all the time. no amount of crying or bitching or witty words or cocktails can take that away.    it's so funny because i read julie's blog a lot of times and i get so mad. sometimes i want to just scream you're so conceited! except, i know she's not. she's beautiful, knows it, and uses it to her advantage.  I guess it just makes me sad to read that she can walk in anywhere and have guys drooling over her. and it's true, i've hung out with her. and that's never happened to me. i don't know what it's like to feel desired and wanted. i don't know what it's like to reel attention from complete strangers. guys don't look at me that way. well maybe after 7 drinks and last call and a swift look around to see all his friends are already making out with my hot friends and shit, well if he just  take a few more shots it can't all be that bad. at least thats how it feels. and then the morning comes and they look over and freak the fuck out because they're staring at the horror in their bed. and i quickly make my exit, wiping tears from my crestfallen face because, hey, at least he was nice about the fact that he was completely repusled by the fact that he made out with me. such is life, right?  i'm kind of over my little weight loss plan. i'm still disgusted by my body but what does it really matter anyway? losing weight isn't  going to make boys like me any more than they already do. i remember hooking up with Tom last year when i weighed nearly 200 fucking pounds. i always wondered how he didn't notice that i'd gained like 30 pounds since were were hooking up before but i guess when you're wasted and there's a naked girl in your bed willing to do anything for you to make you happy weight is of little importance.   I wonder how Tom is doing. Haven't really thought about him. I guess that's a good sign. Things were so different a year ago.  Definitely not better...worse in an interesting way. i'm so ready to move back home for a little while. i swear it's something about the summer.

      It feels like everything Is out of focus in my mind I'm trying to make some sense Of what I've left behind The difference in who I am And what I want to be It seemed so much easier when there was something to believe  "Out of Focus" - Face 2 Face  Watching a peculiar movie on HBO. This poor working class boy in Ireland loves this middle class chic.  It's interesting.  He really wants to make a good impression on her. It's so sweet. It's also funny but I can't every imagine any guy that I've ever been with caring enough about me to go through that much trouble. Maybe one day I guess. I hope so. More and more I begin to really believe that I am destined to be alone forever.  Oh and sad. He just went to get her a drink and the little hooker just started dancing with another guy!! Okay so now I'm sobbing because he looks so heartbroken. What a bitch.  Do you ever get the feeling about your destiny? Do you ever feel a cold shiver run through your spine when looking about, getting a crystal clear vision of the future ahead? I was driving and I saw this woman pass by - maybe in her late 30s or early 40s. and I felt...that would be me. I'm not particularly sure why I thought that at that second, but I did.   I started putting together a five-year plan today. I love planning and although I always thought that those were so stupid..i mean how can you really plan? but certain things..when you think about it- it kinds of motivtes you.   I'm eagerly awaiting for my lease to be done. I'm excited to start saving money. Last night, I went out with Kellie and some of her friends. I had to go ghetto fab and fill my flask and sneak drinks in the bathroom so I wouldn't have to be sober. Miyagis is horrifying when you're sober. anyhow, they all ordered sushi and when they were getting ready to pay, Kellie and Lauren and all the other girls pull out their little money holders. With Tiffany's jeweled arms, delicate hands reach between thick, green mounds of presidents to pull out the appropriate one to do the honors. I felt my insides tear open. Between quick clarifications of who knew who because of charity league or this and that private school or country club. and then kellie tells me how she's going to europe in august and how, she figures she spends about 200 a month on clothes so if she just doesn't buy any new clothes in june or july then she'll have more spening money and hey maybe we should plan a trip to amsterdam and sweeden next year wouldn't that be fun? and so it goes. the lie continues.   i want it. i don't want the pretentiousness, but i want the cash. I don't want the arrogance but i want the confidence. i don't want the ignorance but i want to know how it feels to walk into a room and feel like you own it. because you can. because mum and daddy could write out a check and you could. own it.  money. yes indeed it does make the world go around. i don't want to be frivoulous i just want to be comfortable. I want my mom to be comfortable. i want us to not worry about how to pay the bills. i want washington mutual and citibank to stop sending me overdraft notices and killing innocent trees. i want student loan people to stop threatening me. i want my credit score to be good again. i want to not have a panic attack whenever i swipe my debit card. i want to go to the movies, i want to buy ice cream, i want to tip the pizza guy, i want to get my car washed, i want to buy facial wash, i want to buy a cd, i want to get a manicure, i want to pay my bills on time, i want to give jaclyn the money i owe her for the party, i want to buy food, i want to not have to wait until pay day, i want to put money in a savings account, i want credit cards that aren't maxed out, i want to get my oil changed, i want a tune-up, i want to buy gas, i want to buy more contact solution, hell i want to buy new contacts, i want to buy toilet paper and tissue and napkins and paper towels.  my faith. i must have faith. i have to think that things will get better.  i have to believe that one day this hell will end. one day i'll find someone who loves me. one day i'll be happy. i have to believe it. i have to believe it. i have to believe it.

      I don't know what it is about Fridays that always makes me want to post twice. On my drive home I became so sad.  Tomorrow will be the year anniversay of Nannie's death.  I can't belive it's been a year.  I spent the whole drive home trying to block out painful images of those last few days.  Her delirium and the smell of UCLA medical center. And my inability to feel. Last night I sobbed when I thought about it. With tears in my eyes, I think about how short our time really is. The past few days I've had to fight back panic attacks as intrusive thoughts of death permeate my mind.  I'm not quite sure what it is about death that really scares me. Because it's unavoidable? Because life will continue without you and after the funeral and good-byes, the memory of you will fade with other countless souls...or if you're lucky, your life will be commemorated in a 30 second brief news story every year on the anniversary of your death. Or bithday or whatever. Or maybe cuz we just don't know what's going to happen? Will I know I'm dead? What does it feel like not to breathe? Is there a heaven? A hell? Will I be spending eternity rotting in the eternal flames?  Eternity is a concept the human mind can't grasp. Actually, the human mind can't grasp too much. Or maybe we can and we just don't have the tools to tap into those realms of our mind. I've always wondered if those we claim as mentally ill just have access to parts of the brain that we don't.  Autonomy. That's the word to describe my life.  Michelle and Alex were jokingly calling me a psychopath because of the emotionless tone i use to talk about my family. My therapist once remarked that I talked about my mom as if she were a stranger. I kind of feel like that. I have deep emotions for so many things. But for my famiily, i really feel nothing. Maybe I feel something but not the way i think I should. Or everyone else thinks I should.  I am my family. No one knows me. I know for many, I've managed to evade my past, constructing little glimpses that are harmless to the casual observer.  We were talking about cereal today, and I was talking about how I used to wrap each individual Kix ball with a little piece of a chocolate fruit roll-up and then eat it. Alex remarked "wow, you must have been lonely." For a second, I thought I might burst into tears. The days by myself. With only me as my friend, my entertainment, my guide, my role model. I've spent so many years inside my head, pondering the world around me, it's very hard to try to understand why everyone thinks I should be different.  Oh well. I just took my last 7 bucks and bought a pizza. I don't give a shit right now. I think I'll eat until I puke.

      The world continues to baffle and daze me. This week has been full of existential pondering and wonder.  I can't believe how many new philosphical debates have sprung up in my mind. But, alas, the end of the week is rapidly approaching and I find myself sitting in front of the computer here at work, lost in the mundane activites of data entry.  Not too much has come about in the last few days. Michelle and I met to get me started with my grad school stuff.  I really didn't realize how clueless I was, and how I've really been going about things in the completely wrong way.  Nights have been spent making lists, poring over faculty research interests while cultivating my own.  I think I've finally narrowed it to: Personality disorders, especially antisocial personality disorder and psychopathy in children and adolescents.  Child neglect, abuse and trauma and its relation to personality disorders.  Current cognitive therapy of personality disorders in children and possible new methods in treatment of personality disorders in children and adolescents. Yeah, it makes me feel so smart to have "research interests!"  I officially got the unit I will be working in at Metropolitan State Hospital.  I'm a little worried because it's an adolescent boys ward instead of a girls ward but hopefully it will be alright.  Have no money this weekend so I really don't have any plans. I think I will finish reorganizing my room and plow through some GRE studying.   Still pretty bummed that Shane didn't call me. Was reallly hoping that he would and I would drive out this weekend and maybe we could hang out but that pipe dream has burst and I'm back to the drawing board.  He was so awesome - isn't that how it goes for me? The cute, intellectual one who could probably meet my need on some really great level...well, those just aren't the one's that are interested.   I'm thinking tonight if I don't go to Sarah's birthday party I might just crack open the bottle of zinfandel that's been chilling in our fridge, throw on some DC and just feel.

      Okay. So now I've had a little time to cool down. Not as pissed off but still really annoyed and hurt. I guess I just have this pent up hostility because I ALWAYS feel like Karina acts like I'm incomptent - like this is really HER show and she's just letting me play along. Sometimes it really hurts my feelings. And just the attitude on a professional level but personally - sometimes she's so terse and short with me and I can't for the life of me figure out what I did to piss her off.  O-well. Now that I've written I feel a lot better. Can't wait for the weekend. I have to test Sunday but if shane calls maybe i'll take off Friday and go to rancho. He still hasn't called but for some strange reason I think he will. Maybe he won't. I don't know, I feel like being a little idealistic right now.  I think I'm going to call Rob...maybe next week. Jac had this whole idea about leaving him a voice mail saying that i'd be in "the area" ..and basically let him make the move to say if he wants to hang out. it can't hurt. if it doesn't work it's not like i ever have to see him again.

      I'm on a new kick that I think my benefit my life. I am trying to get into feng shui. Spent the morning looking at some free tips on the internet to get me going while I wait for my next paycheck. found out that my whole room is COMPLETELY blocking any positive chi for love and prosperity. So that's why nothing good is happening! When I get home I'm going to rearrange my bedroom and try to break some of the negative space up.  My room won't be ideal but it will be good enough.  When I move for grad school and get to create a new room i'm definitely going to use the feng shui.  Julie sent me a suggestion about trying yoga out. I think I might. I know crunch offers some classes but i don't think that type of yoga will be the most conducive. She suggested getting a deck and kind of combining it with meditation on my own. I think it's a great idea and I'm going to try it. Again, gotta wait until next paycheck but i don't think the deck is that expensive.  Met a cool guy at mcalan's on friday night when i went out with everyone in rancho. he's supposed to call me today so that we can do something but who knows if he will or not. his name is shane and he's way smart - after taking 2 years off of school after high school (he's a 98er! woo hoo!) he's finishing up undergrad with a double major in english and economics, and hopes to get his doctorate in economics and be a professor. we had AWESOME conversation - he's all into beat writers like kerouac and bukowski but has never read some of the phantasmic kerouac like tristessa and the subterraeans. i gave him some titles to check out and he did the same for me and we spent a good while in our own world, chatting about foreign policy and world economincs, mixed with ginsberg and leary over scotch and soda. I love him!  Anyhow, Rob called on Friday to let me know that the grades weren't posted so he couldn't get mine. We talked for a quick sec but i sounded like a bumbling idiot so whatever. i talked to amy about it and she thinks i should give him a call next week to see if he wants to hang out. We'll see. the surrendered single is still strong in me and it says if you want any kind of relationship with a guy you let him do the calling. i dunno. not sure what i want. not with a 19 year old anyway.  tommorrow is work and i really don't want to go. had a great time this weekend and i'm wishing that my lease was up sooner so that i can move out. although, i think it's something about the summer that makes rancho seem so appealing. this will be my first summer not here so we'll see how that goes.   i've lost 6 lbs. in two weeks and i'm pretty stoked. i'm really going to commit to the diet for the next two weeks and hopefully i'll be looking hot for warped tour and 4th of july.

      Hope dangles on a string Like slow spinning redemption Winding in and winding out The shine ahead has caught my eye And roped me in so mesmerizing It's so hypnotizing I am captivated I am  Vindicated I am selfish I am wrong I am right I swear I'm right Swear I knew it all along And I am flawed But I am cleaning up so well I am seeing in me now The things you swore you saw yourself  "Vindicated" - Dashboard Confessional   I'm feeling pretty sad today. Not really sure why. Just feeling dejected. I come into work today and I feel like Karina is still being terse with me. I've felt like she has had a problem with me all week. I want to say something but I try to avoid blantant confrontation. It's just not worth it. It makes me feel bad but if I've done something to piss her off it's not like i can do anything to fix it.  Feeling kinda bummed that Rob didn't call. Thought for sure he would at least fulfill his obligation to give me my grade but I guess not. He probably forgot. I was thinking maybe I'll call him but I probably won't.  so i can just look stupid and feel even more rejected? again, not worth it.  I'm excited to just get out of LA for a few days and go home for a little. I was thinking in the shower how excited I was. To not even really do anything but just to be around comforting people who love me no matter what. Who I can act however around and they will tell me flat out if i'm doing something to piss them off..or still talk to me in the morning after i've made a drunken fool of myself.

      Last night I finally had to break it down to Richard that I don't want to date him. It sucked. It felt really weird. I've never been the "guy" before who has to cut things off before the "girl" gets too attached. O-well. He doesn't want to be friends which I guess i can understand. But how can he like me so much when we've only been out twice before?   Tonight I have group and I'm kinda excited. It makes me so tired but I like the kids so that's fun. I'm hoping Rob calls today with my grade. I really need to know what I got in this class. But mostly I just hope he calls. =)  I think I'm going home this weekend and will be hanging out with everyone. That's kinda exciting - I haven't really been home in awhile it feels like it.

      And maybe I'll impress her By being in a band And maybe if I act real tough She'll let me hold her hand And maybe I'll win her heart By writing this song about her Sometimes I sit at home And wonder if she's sitting home Thinking about me Or am I just wasting my time?  "Wasting Time" - Blink 182  So I'm crushing pretty hard. And don't laugh - he's 19. I know! My obsession with younger boys had finally been tamed, but all this semester, I have slowly grown more and more attracted to this guy in my social pysch class - Rob. Rob is definitely not standardly attractive. Really tall and skinny, but with garage rock stringy long hair, mild acne and a plain face - he's really nothing to right home about. But there's always been something about him - since the first day of class, that makes me totally just want to jump him.   Anyhow, since about halfway through the semester, Rob always sits in front of me. And damn is the boy intelligent for a teenage guy.  He actually flew to Washington D.C. just to protest in big abortion rally. And every week, his views on the social climate and U.S. foreign policy leave me in utter awe.  Well anyhow, this week (maybe cuz it was the last day of class?) quiet Rob became chatty Rob - all up in mine and Amy's conversation. So beginning of class I give him my cell and he gives me his cell and his home numbers. Throughout class he's constantly turning around to me, making jokes, chatting it up. This is great! Right before we take our final, the teacher gives us an option of finding out just last week's quiz score that night or waiting until Thursday to get both our quiz score and the final grade. I'm totally bummed because I don't want to drive all the way back to SMC to find out my grade. I kind of just vocalize this to Amy and then Rob turns around and is like "I can get your scores for you and just call you with them." Hee hee. Calling with a purpose! My kind of guy. =) So anyhow, I'm taking Amy to pick up her car from her work and she's like, "Oh My God! Could Rob be flirting with you anymore?" Maybe she's just saying that to make me bust out with a Kool-Aid grin. Well, mission accomplished. I don't know if I'll ever hear from him again beyond the scores but it's fun having a crush for a few days.  Supposed to be going to see coffee and cigarettes with richard tonight. Hopefully I won't have to bring up the "let's be friends" with him. Still debating on whether I should call Mike. The show was last night and obviously I couldn't go..but he's hot and I'd definitely like to see him..if not to date then as a friend to introduce me to more hot guys. I don't know if the whole situation was just courtesy or if he really wants to hang out sometime. O-well, such is life.

      Reality is what you want to see It shouldn't make a difference to me I put my trust in what you had to say It didn't make a difference anyway  Reality is different for me My eyes are openend wide enought to see I've listened to your explanations why The more you fail, the harder that I try  "Dissapointed" - Face 2 Face  What is  being out of touch with reality?  Isn't reality subjective anyhow? My reality will never be yours.  It can't be.  So who are you, who are we to judge what another deems to be true?  Is that what it all is anyway? And trying to figure out how to mesh our perceptions with everyone elses?  I tell everyone about one billionth of the things that constantly run through my mind. Others a little more.  I can't. It's too much.  They'll think I'm crazy.  I can't explain.  I don't know what people think of me.  It's too much to be me sometimes.  If only my feelings and my demeanor didn't come off so trite.  I can't verbalize how my inside feels.  When I hear myself trying to explain things to others it sounds so wrong wrong, so contrived, so overanyalzed.  But that's not it.  I can't explain how my insides feel.  It's definitely more than just a cognitive thing.  I FEEL it. Everywhere. In my limbs, all over my boyd the sadness sweeps.  And I don't know how to stop it.  I don't know if it can be stopped.  I feel like so many of friends think I'm exaggerating or it's not as dramatic as I make it seem.  And maybe it's not.  I just don't think I'm supposed to feel like this.  At least not all the time.  There's no joy in me.  Can you conceive of infinity?  That's what it's like trying to imagine another person's experience of the world.  I'll never feel again Then I won't have to feel the pain I'm in If it sounds familiar Because nothing goes the way I plan If it sounds peculiar Then you don't have to try to understand

      I know myself, I know I think I'm so sick of people and I dont know why. I just dont have patience for them, and I really think i can make it on my own  You hide words to keep from hurting me, I would rather know than be happy,  While youre smiling, we're all dying, With everyday that we go, we are just geting old, while you're dying, we're all fighting, with everyday we go, I know better than to get caught up in words of boredom, of no importance to me, So why do people keep talking?  When all I wanna do is hear myself.  The more I'm awake, the more I wanna sleep, What a shame to want it that way, but what a shame to be in this, I wouldn't trust me much if I were you, but you choose...  "Dying" - Osker    So..most of you will notice the new look of my blog. Yeah, somehow blogger deleted my template of my old blog and after much begging and pleading with them, they still haven't sent me any HTML to fix it so I just went with a new template. I'm going to have to still work to fix it again but whatever. Such is life.  The party was pretty good I suppose. Met two hot guys who I'm sure absolutely nothing will pan out with.  There were a ton of people and supposedly everyone had a really good time. We got a ton of complaints according to the manager. He said "next time you have a party like that you guys are getting 3 days notice." Whatever. I was pretty sad when my head finally hit the pillow that night. I really don't know what I expected to happen. I really don't expect much from life anymore. It always seems to dissapoint.  Spent time with Julie yesterday which was pretty cool. I forgot how much I miss her. Only to her could I reveal my new revelation about my life. I'm broken. I've decided that I'm broken.   Now here's the kicker - not really sure WHAT is broken or how to go about fixing this thing. Or if it even can be fixed.  All I know is that I'm just sick of trying. I'm sick of comparing myself to seemingly happy individuals and wondering why my life can't be like theirs.  So I'm just going to accept the fact that I am a broken girl. Hopefully one day I won't be.

      Sitting at work really not wanting to be here.  The lab is pretty quiet and empty with nobody here really except Jenny trying to convince me to go to Costco with her to get snacks so she can "play hooky."  Not really in the mood for wandering the isles of a superwarehouse. Or listening to Jenny go on and on about Adam or the puppy or whatever.   Went to the movies last night and saw Saved! It was pretty good. Really witty and interesting. Didn't crack my top ten but I'll put it on my need to own DVD list.  The guest list to our party is slowly swelling. I'm kinda excited I just hope it doesn't get to out of control. We'll have to stop by people's apts. tomorrow and let them know about people coming. I hope it's fun.  Karina isn't here today. I wish she were. I think she might be feeling depressed about Chris and didn't want to come in. I've been there so I understand. Watching saved last night with Jena Malone's character getting hard core jocked by this one guy (dont know his name but he's been in Almost Famous and Spun) and he was just so persistent. Even though she was fucking pregnant he was all about her. And I'm thinking, yeah right. When will my day come where some guy will want me no matter what my flaws are? Prolly never. I want the family life so much but I just have this feeling in the pit of my stomach that it will never happen for me. That it will never be my destiny. I know I'm "only 23" but i can't help the looming disaster that I feel.

      Tell me what you want from me Cuz I don't know exactly what you want me to be There's no place left for me to go So why don't you come kick me around for awhile? Down here you won't see me crying Ain't got no time for that I'll find a million ways to sacrifice myself Seems every time I try to gain a little ground I end up right back where I'd never thought I'd be  Down here it feels alright Plenty of time To find another way of self-destruction Only way I know how to Maybe another time, maybe another place I'll be strong enough to leave this place behind me Like a clown I'll raise my glass to the sky Toast another night serenading my reflection Down here it feels alright Plenty of time to find another way to seize the day without the bottle of redemption  "Wrong Side of the Tracks" - Strung Out  Dissonance and the inner soundrack of my mind.  Hm. Thinking that would be a good title for the book I'll never write. o-well.  on the drive home from work today I found my mind wandering about.  For some reason, this whole dissonance thing has been stuck in my mind. Even though i learned it a thousand years ago in comm, it seems like now it's given me a new perspective on everything.  Dissonance. My life is dissonance. I feel the need to say I'm different, I'm unique - people will never understand me. All that to reduce dissonance. The guys I choose, purposely unattainable so that I can deflect from my low self-esteem and annoying habits. Reduce dissonance at all costs.   This weekend Jenni said to me that once she talked to Tom and he said he loved me (but she did stress not "in love" but hey I'll take what I can get). She swears on a holy stack of bibles that she's told me this before but I know I would have remebered. It made me so bittersweet inside. Like a small victory - I won A battle but have long since the war. I know nothing about him should affect my life but it does. It still does. And you know, I don't think there will ever come a time when it won't. I gave a piece of my soul to him, whether he deserved it or not. I don't want to get over it. I guess what I just want to do is accept the past for what it was - a great few months in the past. He's not the person he was then - I think it was a huge mistake on his part. He let me see something I wasn't supposed to and will never let me go there again with him again. And that's why he's a dick, that's why our conversations are brieft and terse. Strained. O-well I just want to get to the point where the past and stay in the past. And let it go.  I'm sad today. And, because of my new "diet" no food or drink to drown my sorrows in. So I sit, painfully watching the Simpsons, basking in it. It sucks but such is life right?

      So nothing much has been happening lately. 1 more week left of school and I pretty stoked about that ending. I love my teacher. I want to get her a card. Even though I'm probably not going to get an A in her class (still hope so cross your fingers!) she has just filled me with all this knowledge. I love her for it.  Pretty excited about alcohol appreciation party this weekend. I really hope that brad and matt come. Or at least brad. Kinda think I'll be in the mood for a little hook-up that night. We'll see. I always say I'm done with the meaningless hook-ups because they are worthless.

      Thinking more about the celebrity I should marry and I figured out who it should be. Jake Gyllenhaal.  That's my perfect man.  He's super hot in that artsy way. Intense. Well at least all his characters are intense. And he just seems sweet and quiet and introverted and passionate and loving and someone i would want to spend my life with. Yup.

      It's hard to truly understand the power that religion and modern society has over our thoughts, actions, and beliefs. As I enter this period in my life where I begin to question basic, fundamental "truths", though the questions are firmly in my head, I find it hard to disregard the given answers, no matter how irrational and idiotic I know them to be.  Since I'm going to a Baha'i service tomorrow, I thought I would read up today a little more on their teachings, how their faith begun, etc. So, basically the religion was formed by some dude called Bahllujah who claims to be the "Promised One" that all of the scriptures have written about. So i'm sitting here thinking that dude is psychotic, how can he believe that he is more important than Jesus. Then I pause- if I had lived 2000 years ago, I might be saying the same thing about Jesus. I know the questions and the answers to many of the questions but when i begin to apply them in real life I am still reluctant. It's hard for me to shake off the notion of the Holy Trinity and Jesus dying for my sins. I keep wondering if I will be sent to hell if I start believing the historical evidence that is presented to me.  Though I'm wary, it just causes me to wonder even more...so all Jewish, Muslim, Buddist, Hindu, Pagan, Wiccan, aethists, agnostics and whoever are going to be sent to hell just because they don't subscribe to Christianity? I just don't see how that's possible. I really don't see how one religion can proclaim to be the "right" one. Why would God reveal his divine plan to only one group of people in one period of history? I think that's what really draws me to Baha'i - this concept of Moses, Jesus, Krishna, Buddha, Muhammad, etc. all being Diving Messengers of one God. Now that I can believe. No problem with that one. Still doubting if there is one god - the concept just seems so odd.  Existence is odd. I do know the why's in my mind will never be answered. Even though Memnoch the Devil was fiction, I think it answered my biggest why (why did God create the world) beautifully. He is trying to figure out his own exiistence. It just makes you wonder...how does God just exist? Where did he come from? How do we know he's by Himself? How do we know it's a he? Could he just be the God of Earth, and then there are other Gods who run other races of beings? How can the universe expand? what is it expanding into?  I can sit for hours contemplating all the whys in my head. Religion is one of those whys that is slowly being answered. Not the heavy stuff of feeling and faith, but the inconsistencies and hypocrisy of modern relgion. Mainly Christianity and Catholocism. I finding more and more that the basis of Christianity is more politcal and social than of God's teachings. Ignoring some of the basic historical facts is just ignorant. Believe what you want and have faith in what you want, but please don't just disregard things that ACTUALLY HAPPENED.  Anyhow, not too motivated to do anything today. I do need to study a bit so maybe I'll do that later.

      wouldn't it be so cool if you could just point to someone and said "that one. I want to have that one as my boyfriend." Karina and I were playing the "which celebrity should you marry" game today. I told her george clooney because i really see him fulfilling her in all the ways she wants.  she picked colin farrell for me which is kind of funny how dead on she was. not because he's someone that i think is "right" for me, but he is definitely the type of guy i'm into - mysterious, aloof, trouble-maker, emotionally unavailable.  I read this interview with him and I was dying laughing he was so great.   went to metro today and met my kid on my new unit.  he was nice.  he's mildly mentally retarded, ADHD, bipolar and conduct disordered (adolscent-onset).  i'm supposed to work with him on Saturdays and just kind of work with him on reading and writing but mostly building social skills.  he's 16 but his mental age is 9ys. 7mo and his reading level is between kindergarten and 1st grade.  i know i have some work cut out for me but i'm really excited.  i guess he has no one - his mom is some cracked out whore who obviously never comes to see him.  unlike any of the other kids he has no thoughts about leaving metro and getting another placement - he's accepted that this is it for him.  well the PSW said that she thinks that he'll benefit just by having a consistent person in his life.  i hope i can bring something to his day.  this weekend promises to be a huge bore with no money and nothing to do.  i might call richard to see if i can cajole him into taking me to see the village but i don't know.  i really want rob to call but i won't call him.  if he likes me he'll call i guess.  we'll see. no word from shawn so i think i'll just write him off.

      you think you're right you're full of prejudice and spite you think you've got me pegged but your wrong  "Resignation" - Face 2 Face  &nbsp;I'm in money trouble again in the worst way. Short on rent - this never happened before.&nbsp; Frankly&nbsp;i don't know how it happened this time. I sent back the cds and weight watchers will refund for the next two months but i have to pay for this month, but that's it. i didn't buy anything else. still nearly $300 short.&nbsp; sandy was super nice and said she'd lend me the money so at least that's cool. i was so pissed at karina yesterday who just looked at me condescendingly like i don't deserve her empathy. maybe i don't but we all can't have it so together and so "perfect" like she does.&nbsp; whatever, i can never forget that she doesn't know me. she only knows a fration of me, no matter how well she thinks she has me pegged.  no rob and no shawn so i'm pretty bummed about that. i'm supposed to have dinner with amy tonight but i have no money so don't think that's happening.&nbsp; no village or napoleon dynamite either.&nbsp; no kellie's party.&nbsp; looks like it's going to be me sitting on my ass all weekend. o-well i can study for the gre's.&nbsp; i am going to that baha'i service on sunday so i think that will be good for me. really need some sort of higher power in my life right now. such is life my man, such is fucking life.

      I don't wanna be anything other than what I've been trying to be lately All I have to do is think of me and I have piece of mind I'm tired of looking around rooms Wondering what I've got to do Or who I'm supposed to be I don't want to be anything other than me  "I Don't Want To Be" - Gavin DeGraw  I want to start a new religion.&nbsp; Actually this lady at supervision said I should try Bahai so I think I will check out their site or something.&nbsp; Obviously wondering if Rob is going to call. Or Shawn for that matter.&nbsp; I'd really like it if one of them called. Well I'd actually be happy if they'd both called but well what can you do?

      I'd be so pleased to see you Out of the classroom Wearing the smile that I'll bring you I was hoping to learn a few things like...  Do you like dreaming of things so impossible? Or only the practical? Or ever the wild? Or waiting through all your bad, bad days Just to end them with someone you care about? Or do you like making out? And long drives? and brown eyes? and guys that just don't quite fit in? Do you like them?  "So Impossible" - Dashboard Confessional  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hung out with Rob yesterday and it was pretty damn fun.&nbsp; Mostly at his house watching a movie and some TV then smoking a little weed. it was pretty cool.&nbsp; I still don't think he's hot at all but still want to jump him in the worst way.&nbsp; we chit chatted about lots of stuff.. have lots of stuff in common.&nbsp; there were a couple of times where i thought he was pretty immature but i guess he could say the same of me. he said he had fun and wants to hang out again but i don't know if he likes me. how can you tell if a 19 year old boy likes you? i really just don't remember.&nbsp; yeah i kinda like him and i'm crushing. it's fun, right?  anyhow, feeling kinda tired and ready for bed. will be finished here at work in about an hour so i guess i just need to suffer through.&nbsp; i've actually accomplished a lot of stuff today so i feel decent about that. even went to the gym this morning (i'm the size of 2 1/2 Rob's so I thought i should go work out). did a little gre studying there and then met with michelle today to start working on my letters to faculty. i just want it to seriously be over with. i'm so tired of being in limbo.  been feeling pretty good about all the attention from boys even though things haven't been necessaritly panning out.&nbsp; really hope shawn calls so i can keep my streak going. the attention has been a good boost for my self-esteem. which of course i could always use.

      I heard about your trip. I heard about your souvenirs.  I heard about the cool breeze, in the cool nights, and the cool guys that you spent them with. Well I guess I should have heard of them from you.   I heard about your regrets. I heard that you were feeling sorry. I heard from someone that you wish you could set things right between us. Well I guess I should have heard of them from you.   Don't&nbsp; you see? That the charade is over And all the "Best Deception" And the "Clever Cover Story" awards go to you So kiss me&nbsp; hard Cuz this will be the last time that I let you You will be back someday And this awkward kiss  That tells of other people's lips Will be of service to keeping you away  "The Best Deceptions" - Dashboard Confessional  A whirlwind weekend it's been in deed. Saw Tom. On Friday it was like whatever cuz he didn't say a damn word to me. But last night we talked. A lot. He yelled at me. About stupid war shit which we always used to get into fights about anyways but it's so weird because i'm so strong and paranoid and quick to defense. I think he's the only person in the world that can yell at me and I just sit there like a dumb ass and take it. obviously i fight my point to a certain extent but he's so ignorant in that respect.&nbsp; but this time i shut up cuz i know he's going to the military and that's what those guys have to do. they have to rationalize killing people.&nbsp; He's scared. We talked a little about him leaving. He's going on September 22 (he told he was missing my birthday...I was just stunned he remembered...) and he goes to North Carolina. After this and that he thinks he'll end up in Afghanistan.&nbsp; I told him that I would write him and he seemed to genuinely appreciate that.&nbsp; By God I still love him.. we talked a little bit about some crazy stuff like rehab and AA and I talked to him about my dad a bit and going to AA in college and stuff and it felt so good. It was like old Tom. for a sec anyhow. i missed THAT tom.&nbsp; but no matter what, my world came crashing down when he went home with some other chic. such is life.  i met a pretty cute guy at the bar last night.&nbsp; he was actually the bartender. his name is shawn and he's a junior at UCLA...but at least he's 21. i don't know what my thing is with the younger guys lately.&nbsp; anyhow he got my # so hopefully he'll call. amiee and tracy said that he was all about me so we'll see about that.  i'm going out with rob today so that's kinda cool. i'm a little nervous but i guess there's nothing to really be nervous about.&nbsp; i guess the feng shui is starting to work? i feel like i keep meeting guys, even though things aren't really working out with any of them.   i've been having fun in rancho of late. i'm pretty excited that i'll be moving back. it might suck if i start getting into it with anyone out there but i like my friends here. it makes me very happy to say i even have friends. i think i'm finally starting to believe it.

      &nbsp; So here's to you Mrs. Robinson...  "Mrs. Robinson" - Simon and Garfunkel  &nbsp; I have a date this weekend with Rob. Yes, the 19 year-old.&nbsp; Funny how it was just folly before...like a little fantasy or a funny little crush.&nbsp; But now the reality of actually going out with this guy freaks me out a bit.&nbsp; I know it's no big deal but... i was talking to jac last night and we realized this would be my first stone-cold sober date in a really long time. you know how on most dates you guys will usually have a cocktail or two to break the ice. well since rob doesn't HAVE A FAKE ID it looks like caffeneine and nicotine will be had and that's about it.&nbsp; oh well. i think it will be interesting to say the least. the guy does a lot of cool things so i think it should be kinda fun.  i was talking to jac last night about "the one" and our culture's whole concept of it.&nbsp; She was saying that Tim was the only guy that she's ever dated that she thought that he could maybe be the one. i was telling her that i've thought that about 10 times with the last few guys i 've gone out with starting with bill.&nbsp; at first i was thinking that maybe i'm just dramatic and overzealous in my love affairs (which i am) but it also made me realize that i'm getting closer to the qualities and attributes that i am looking for in a life partner.&nbsp; more and more the guys that i'm intersted in all share the same basic qualities (extremely intelligent, passion for music and art and subculture, very liberal and ACTIVE, writers or poets or creators of some sort, etc...). Before i would have said that these silly things don't matter but..since these things MAKE me who i am, wouldn't it be logical that I would be with someone who felt the same way?  can't believe that it's almost august. time flies. it was so weird. i was reading karina's blog the other day and i guess i offended her when i asked her why she was at the twin project still. i really didn't mean to but&nbsp;i guess i'm doing that a lot to her lately - offending her.&nbsp; i don't know if my comments are getting harsher or she's getting more sensitive to them. apparently i should just steer clear of hot topics like jobs and grad school.&nbsp; i guess it's just because i want to BE somewhere already. i want to do whatever i can to get to point b ASAP.&nbsp; i'm tired of living in limbo, from paycheck to paycheck, unsatisfied in a lot of aspects of my life. not that&nbsp;i think that a career will provide with with all the stability i need, i know that because i'm in limbo in my career it has a lot of turmoil. i guess not everyone sees things that way.

      I won't worry my life away.  "The Remedy" - Jason Mraz  I've been sick with a cold which completely sucks cuz I hate being sick. O well.&nbsp; I had a revelation this morning.&nbsp; We all worry way to much.&nbsp; i pride myself on living in denial, but i still worry.&nbsp; the worry still comes back. and what can worrying do for you? not a damn thing. the act of worrying can not change events, make things happen.&nbsp; so i'm going to attempt to live my life worry-free. easier said than done but... why worry about paying bills? it's not like i'm going to have any more money next month than i do this month. i'm just going to have to accept the fact that i'm poor. period. why worry about boys? getting sick will not make them call, make them like me, make them want to be with me. i'm just going to have to accept it.  some may view this as being passive but i'm kinda just looking at it as accepting what is. i still have goals, i just can't stress about them anymore. according to some crazy dude on the radio the world is going to end on my birthday so i might as well live it up until then.

      i'm tired. i feel like i've just lived half a year, not a week.&nbsp; just hanging out at home watching true life on MTV.&nbsp; nothing much to report.&nbsp; i'm just feeling kinda tired and whatever. called rob but he was taking a nap and i felt really stupid for calling him. oh well. life goes on.&nbsp; met a cute guy at megans last night but i think he was gay.&nbsp; i really can't remember the last time i kissed a guy.&nbsp; maybe joe back in...february? i kinda just want to make out with someone. i mean i know thats not true but i guess that would just kinda be nice.&nbsp; blah blah. i just wrote a paper for jenni. i hope its okay. i really want to do a good job. it didn't ake me too long, maybe 3 or 4 hours. maybe i'll make a business out of it. i could use the money. o well. later on i guess.

      For some reason it seems that Sundays always warrant two posts. Anyhow, just got off the phone with Shane. Nope, he called me. Nope, not a text message. He called me. Okay boy, now you've got my attention.  Anyhow, he was trying to figure out what happend last night. He was like you were supposed to come up here last night? So I kind of just tell him the deal and he was like yeah, did you get some really mean text messages? and i was like yeah, they were kind of mean. So anyhow, he apologized, he said he was really drunk and his friends were fucking around me with me. Which could be the truth or a lie. Anyhow, it's a little disconcerting who I was speaking to when I made my little diatribe but what can you do? He said he went into work today to get stuff done and that he would call me later.  Now the funny thing, since I have rationalized my feelings, purged the anxiety, and have a date with Rob, I can just sit back and say, "cool." i feel so free. Sure, I care a bit but it's not the life or death situation that it felt like yesterday. And so now I think I'm going to do a little self-evaluation work so I can capitalize on my feelings right now.  I feel like now that I have changed my cognitions and realized that what Shane thinks about me isn't the foundation of my world, I can just be happy that Wow! He called me and didn't text. If I just let things happen people will step up to the plate. Or they won't. But in this case I just need to relax and let it go. Lots of work still to do but I'm excited by the prospect of gaining control of my out of whack emotions.

      I’m drunk off your kiss For another night in a row This is becoming too routine for me... And it’s all right to pretend That we still talk It’s just for show, isn’t it? It’s my fault that it fell apart  Just maybe you need this...  You were everything I wanted But I just can't finish what I started There's no room left here on my back It was damaged long ago Though you swear that you are true I still pick my friends over you  "My Friends Over You" - New Found Glory  Life is truly an amusing thing. This is an undeniable statement.   Feeling tranquil and excited in a way. Last night was a bust with Shane. He texted me "hey what are you up to tonight" and since I have no will power I entangle myself in a text message conversation.  I end up running in to him at McAlans.  We chat for a few minutes but he's kind of aloof and such. i'm not sure if it was because he was drunk or what the deal was. Anyhow, end up talking to these two hoosier guys about my frustration and they think the situation is hilarious, and that Shane is probably the biggest tool ever. In fact, every single guy last night told me point blank that he must be gay. Or a really big pussy. It's good to know that I'm not crazy.  Anywhow, the night culminates with a not so stable phone conversation where I'm like: look, I like you, you seem like a cool guy and I'd like to hang out with you and I was under the impression that you felt the same way. But I'm confused as all hell what you mean by the stuff you do and say so, if you want to hang out with me, then give me a call. Sound familiar? Yeah, hmmm, wasn't this the same speech I gave him Friday night? Which only proves his toolness. But he keeps texting me and I keep responding. Yes, I know. I will STOP responding.  So feeling dejected, trying to avoid advances from Gavin, who has been trying to get on me since my days of fucking Tom and I really wish he wasn't such a loser. I was so mad and annoyed I said "I want to get so drunk that even Gavin looks good." And everyone was like whoa...get this chic a drink!  Anyhow, went with Melissa to Mike's house where Van, Willie, Mike and two other random dudes were just hanging out playing poker. Bored and drunk I was going to drunk dial Richard again but my eyes grazed down one more entry to Rob (19-year old from Social psych class). Gosh wouldn't it be fun to leave him a drunk message? Doesn't matter right? Haven't talked to the boy since mid-June and I'll probably never even see him again.  Well...he answers and was so excited to talk to me you would think he'd won the lottery. Weird...so anyways we chit chat for a few minutes then he asks me out for coffee! Go figure.  So I guess we're supposed to do that this week. I'll just have to drive up and meet him assuming that my mom is okay. I'm thinking i want to see how she's feeling by Thursday cuz maybe I'll go to work Friday or something. Dunno.  Anyhow it's just exciting to remind myself that Shane isn't the only intellectual, liberal guy that I'm going to ever meet. Hello, Rob flew to D.C. for the abortion rally and I just remember chatting with him cuz we'd been to a lot of the same protests for the war. So what if he's 19...it'll be fun just to make a new friend.   Maybe I'm just trying to reduce dissonace but at this point I really don't give a shit. Oh I can't wait for a new pool of boys to play with!

      It started out all wrong I wasn't thinking Everything is wrong I couldn't see it I guess I thought that things would somehow try and work themselves out I'd like to think it's not so easy to convince myself That everything is going to be okay  Shame on me this time I was only trying to make the best of this I should have known Fool me once and shame on you And again And I must choose between  Suspision and naivete This is what you wanted anyway This time shame on me  "Shame On Me" - Face to Face  I am self-destructive. I am. I need to face facts and deal. I totally fucked things up with Shane. As Tracy and Jenni so gently put it yesterday "what things?" Yes, I know that we're not anything, not even dating, but now I've completely sabatoged any chances that he would be remotely interested in me.   I've been working on the my self-evaluation and this pattern that i've uncovered has never been more apparent than in this whole thing with Shane. I create these expectations...I'm looking for someone, something, to "save me."  So I put all my eggs in a basket, and I wish and want and pray and hope for my savior to come. And I'm so eager, I need the reassurance that this time it's going to be real. This time salvation will be tangible and I can leave my pain and suffering behind. By doing this I give people, guys in particular, so much power over me, my life.   I make them into gods. Deciding my fate. Deciding whether or not I'm worthy of...living? love? attention? affection? I've known Shane for about 3 weeks now. Most of our "conversations" have been over the last week, and primarily through text messages. No matter what crazy drama I'm playing out in my head, I have to recognize that this whole thing is irrational. How is it possible to have such strong emotions, to have invested so much, gotten so attached when I haven't even kissed the boy? How can an ENTIRE relationship ( from meeting, to talking, to falling for him, to fucking it up and thinking he'll never call again) happen in ONE FUCKING WEEK. I am psychotic. I have broken from reality. I don't know what made for TV movie I live in but it's got to stop. Its got to end here.  I don't know if Shane and I would have started dating. Hell, I don't even know if we would have even ever spoken on the phone again after Monday night. What I do know is that I killed every chance and opportunity. I wrapped my pillow tight around the face of chance and smothered it. And the whole time I knew what I was doing. I was perfectly aware. but it was like I was watching someone else. And I couldn't tell you why. I just NEEDED to do it. I NEEDED him to know things because I thought...I dont know what I thought. Maybe I thought it would make him like me? Even though I DIDNT know that he DIDN'T like me. It just wasn't playing out the way I thought it should. Since he wasn't doing X,Y, and Z then of course he COULDN'T like me. And of course it was because of something I did.  I was telling Karina the other day that people who internalize, people with really low self-esteem; we are the most conceited sons of bitches in the world. Everything essentially revolves around us. Me, me, me. What is it about ME that keeps fucking everything up. No, I can't accept the fact that he might be busy at work, hanging out with friends, tired, sick, asleep. It all has to revolve around ME. He doesnt call because he doesn't like ME. What can I change about ME to make him like ME. Its the control thing.  I want to learn to let go. As we were driving to Riptides Jenni said, "I can't understand why you want to be in a relationship so bad. You need to just relax and have fun."  And so it goes. Countless times I've heard this advice, phrased differently to match the mood and dispotion of the messenger. But I tried to say, I can't. All I've ever wanted was someone to love me. Someone to look at me and accept me and say you're perfect. I only want you. And though I don't want to get pop psych I think that because I lost my dad so early, that's why I need it from a boy. I don't care that I have great girl friends, or a mom and aunts. I want a BOYFRIEND to feel this way about me. And I'll never feel complete until I have it. Funny thing is I HAVE to be complete to get it. Such is life, my man. Such is life.

      Run through my town Scream 'til I faint Stumble around And scare kids away Worn out, I'll be Asleep on the street And watch my whole town Attempt to wake me "My Town" - Armor for Sleep  So up and down up and down this roller coaster has gone for the past few days. It's just one crazy emotion after another - my insides are all jumbled up.  So Shane called me on Monday night and we talked for  about an hour and a half about all sorts of things. Life and lovers lost(turns out he was engaged when he was 20), politics and disciplines (economic vs. psychological perspective on today's world politics), internet addictions (fark.com and homestarrunner.com were some notable ones) and about literature and writing (we're supposedly going to have a poetry "swap").  All in all I'd have to say it was fantastic. He's fantastic. He said he would call me tomorrow (yesterday) but he didn't. I'm not too stressed about it. A little bummed but he did say that it takes a lot for him to motivate to talk on the phone and his friend was coming over to hang out so that is all plausible. I've decided that if I don't here from him by Friday, I'm going to give him a call when I'm driving out. I think that would be okay. I really think he's kinda into me, just not to good with the whole "chase the girl" thing. He just seems really shy and for some strange reason i feel totally comfortable with the thought of calling him so we'll see. It'll be interesting if we get to hang out since I'm going to be home for like 10 days.  Anyhow, mom found out that her biopsy came back "cancerous" so therefore she has breast cancer. She's going to get a lumpectomy (?) on Monday, hence why I will be in Rancho for the extended vacation. Supposedly this procedure has a very high success rate so I shouldn't be worried but it's so weird. It's like my worst fears - once my mom dies that's it. I'm an orphan. No one left. I always hoped that when my mom got sick I would be in a serious relationship or married, just so I wouldn't feel so alone. I hope that plan still pans out. But I really don't want to think about that whole thing.  I feel so listless. Not really depressed just no energy. Very apathetic. I'm not really feeling like I care too much about anything. Well, I guess I care about if Shane calls or not but even I'm not feeling emotions about that as strongly as I normally do. O-well, such is life.

      I don't know where I'm going Don't know should I change my mind I can't decide There's too many variations to consider Nothing I do Don't do nothing But bring me more to do It's true I do imbue my blue to myself I make it bitter  Baby, lay your head on my lap one more time Tell me you belong to me Baby say that it's all going to be alright I believe that it isn't  "You're All I Need" - Fiona Apple  Anxiety is a beast that I don't have good control over.  Today has been a roller coaster of emotions. I text messaged Shane, and we had a couple of back and forth messages. I found out that he was in the mountains today and wouldn't be back until late tonight.  Well, I lost all inhibition and kind of laid it out on the table. I'm just tired of the back and forth. Laura Doyle would have been extremely upset with me.  Anyhow, I just basically said "well i was going to see if you maybe wanted to hang out before i left tomorrow but...i guess just call me sometime?" There. I'd done it. I just threw it out there. Yes, dumb-ass, I want to hang out with you! I know we're supposed to wait for the chase but I really think this boy is dense. Anyhow, he texts me back "Ok I will (crock of shit i'm thinking..call me like you did 2 weeks ago? sat night?) i'm just hanging with my sis and brother in law, i'll call you if we get home early." Well, I don't know if he's going to call but I think the fact that he went out of his way to point out that he was just hanging out with family says something. What exactly I'm not sure.  So I know we won't be hanging out tonight but my anxiety has been pacified for the moment. I don't think it will flare up again until Wednesday and he still hasn't called. No, maybe Friday. If he hasn't called me by Friday to see if I'm coming home for the weekend my anxiety will reach a high point. And then the tough task of forgetting about him (again) will ensue.  I'm supposed to maybe be getting a late lunch with Jenni but I don't think that one's happening either. I guess it's been a pretty lonely weekend overall. Well, if anything I finished two awesome books and I just started a third off of Shane's list. If anything I have become a wiser woman in the world of literature this weekend.

      I think about what I said to you When you finally decided to come my way Cat o' nine tails is getting old And I don't know how I got this way And I don't know how much more I wanna take I know you'll shoot me down again Before I get too high So here I sit  Tied up All alone with all my thoughts When will I learn to walk away?  "Solitaire" - Strung Out  back again. obsessing over a boy. haven't done this in quite a while. my mind keeps spinning and spinning..why hasn't he called? why didn't he call? why won't he call? knowing that there are probably a million reasons, he hasn't, didn't and won't call, and none of those having to do anything with me, doesn't make me feel any better. was it something i said? did? didn't say? didn't do? am i not cute enough? not his type? too much? did i overstep my boundaries? was i too aggressive?   i know that all this does is make me more crazy and obsessive. me sitting here wondering and worrying will NOT make him call me. It will not make him think about me. It will just make me crazier. I keep thinking I should have done something today. went to hermosa or san diego or even palm springs.   in less than 24 hours i've developed a full-blown, mind-numbing crush for this boy. okay, so not less than 24 hours. the feeling has definitely carried on since our first meeting and has just been strangely reinfornced by recent events. how can someone seem to be so into you but just not deliver the goods? and i know it has probably a ton to do with the fact that I don't live out here but...isn't seeing me twice at McAlans in two weeks enough to realize that the idea of us hanging out is not as obscure as he thinks? that i DO live here - in my mind, with my friends, with everything. I've never been a whole-hearted weho inhabitant. and i'll be here...just a few months. maybe that's not it but i think that has a lot to do with. and maybe he's shy. or maybe he's not. maybe he just isn't interested. but why go out of your way to hang out? to chat and talk? to remember meaningless and mundane details about my life? to give thoughtful and elaborate explanations about the exterior of your house when we're just going to drop you off? your business card? text messages? care about my opinions? if that isn't interest i'm not quite sure what is. tom never asked me what i thought about anything. but i always knew that he was never interested in me. intrigued maybe. bewildered. a challenge to be conquered is probably a more accurate estimation. i'm not sure. but interested in me as a person? never crossed his mind. maybe i hoped but i always knew that wasn't it. but with shane...we've talked maybe a total of 4 or 5 hours over our two encounters but those seconds were filled with hunger and motivation...an eerie excitement to push the connection further. to see how far this could take us into the depth of the moment. i've literally spoken with the boy 2 times and both of those nights I was transported into a world where the banter between the two of us was all that could fill my ears. how filling my belly with alcohol and losing my senses wasn't my primary goal. how i wanted to be smart for him...i wanted to be witty and captivating and enchanting and daring and innovative. i wanted him to eperience me as i was experiencing him - full of wonder and awe that there existed a 24-year-old in the world who was this....engaging. and intelligent. and thoughtful. and worldly. and just...knew.  o-well. back to the drama. please, please, please god let him call me tomorrow. i can't do this again. that weekend I sat glued by the phone, waiting for his call. and I got over it...never really thought i'd see him again. just filed him along all the other empty promises in my life. and then i did see him again. and he pushed it past cocktails at mcalans. he contacted me in the "real" world. while he was at work, nonetheless. That's gotta say something. Just what it says I don't know.

      This time I think it could be Perfect But you'd push it away I came here today with a purpose Should I try? Or just let it go? Cause these things I'd like to ask you Are things I can't explain Or should I keep your glance Outstide the porch last Saturday?  But tonight it seemed Suddenly perfect Still no promises made The balance of power was shifting Were you trying to let me in? Or was I trying so hard with all my confidence? I was lost tonight Confused and regretful I cracked Swallowed it back And left with no spine in tact  Should I have succomed to your courtsey? I could see you were trying to get my attention Put I pushed it away..  This time I think it could perfect...  "Perfect" - Midtown   I'm in love. Okay, so maybe not in love, but I think I've found one of my soulmates. I ran into Shane on Friday night.  Dead tired after the Warped Tour but still wanting to hang out, Jenni and I go to McAlans.  Everyone's gone for the fourth so we just figured we'd have a few drinks and all would be dandy. Some lame guy is flirting with me. As we make our way out to the patio with lame guy still chatting it up, turns out he's friends with none other than Shane. Who, I'm still pissed didn't call me. So at Jenni's suggestion, I don't say anythting to him- kind of just pretend I don't really know him. So he kind of leans over and is like "Hey Nicole, I met you the last time you were here...?" And I was like, yeah, you're Shane the guy who got my # and never called. Okay so that was a bit direct but i said it playfully and fun- and then didn't give it another thought.  So we quickly began talking. He floored me when he said he bought Tristessa and has been trying to read it in the midst of work and extra reading for school. He looked a little hurt when I said that I didn't remember any of the books he told me about. But then quickly said he'd write them on his business card.   So the night was spent chit chatting with him and Jenni. Him letting his friends leave and spending the time hanging with us. I swear he had a tape recorder in his brain. He remebered everything I told him when we first met, what I want to do, Canada, 1998, seven and sevens, and how many months is it til you move back? two? three?  Eager chats about bands and stuff..totally forgot he was a hardcore emo boy...eagerly discussing sets from warped tour..did bad religion play old stuff? love alkaline trio...do you know this band and that band? what! i'll burn you a cd...A couple of hours spent in utter confusion of him flirting and us just totally getting along and me just wondering why he didn't call.  So Jenni thinks he's just really scared so I do all I can to reassure him and drop as many hints as possible. I kind of just come out and say, "Well if you're not doing anything tomorrow give me a call" and he with a hand on the shoulder promises to call as we drop him off at his house.  Yesterday, I awake fresh from my nap to be greeted by a text message "hey it's shane, how was the movie?" So cute..he remembered I was jazzed to see farenheit 9/11 which we'd been having an ongoing debate. He's just as liberal as I am - maybe even more, the fucker voted for Nader - but as a double English and Economics major, he's all about the monetary aspects of politics. He's so smart it's eerie. Anyhow, we do the text message tango, he's says he's still at work and I text him to call me when he gets off and he texts back Okay but 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and I fall asleep with no call. What the fuck?! I thought we were making progress.  So I speed read through one of the books he told me to read "Girlfriend in a Coma" by Douglas Coupland. An AWESOME book about life and existence and questioning and posing questions that can't be answered. The book was so me it was frightening. Until I woke up this morning and started reading another one of his selections "Ishmael" by Daniel Quinn, which starts off about a guy philosophizing and waxing poetic about saving the world. It's like Shane gave me these books because he KNEW and could see. But he couldn't tell me...whether he's shy or just didn't have the words but he wanted me to know that he knew.   So I'm hoping he'll move on to more of my meatier selections for him like Stanger in a Strange Land and the Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test. More than anything I want him to call me.  I feel like, even though I know that EVERYTHING in life is just ne big coincidence, I feel like I was meant to see him again.  And I think he realizes the same - hence why he got off his ass and texted me. I've never talked to someone who I felt so completely and utterly understood me. Who knew exactly what I was trying to say, even though I can't communicate it all the time.   I know he's busy today doing stuff. I'm think that maybe tomorrow I might text him and ask him how his 4th was. One last nudge to let him know that I'm interested if he wants to take the ball and run with it.   Dude, this post is getting too long. But, I've decided that I'm going to cut off ties with Erin. Maybe just become Christmas and birthday card friends. I've been saying for awhile that I really need to clean up who I call a friend. And I just don't think we're even similar anymore. I don't know who she's become. I called Jenni like 4 times from Warped Tour because my day sucked. When I have something going on it's like the first person I think to tell is Jenni, and then I can't wait to get to work and tell Karina, and then why isn't Jaclyn home...I have news, dammit!! Calling Erin doesn't even come to mind.  Speaking of friends, I feel like after the talk Jenni and I had when we went to Bar Marmont that night, we've had a change in our friendship. So much better. I feel like we've become better friends somehow. It's weird,  because I've known her like 6 years now but at this point I really feel like we've become better friends. It's a very cool feeling. I actually feel like I can tell people things. Like I don't have to keep all my skeltons in the closet. I can invite people over to come take a peek with me and figure out how the hell we're going to smuggle them out.

      I want you to want me I need you to need me I'd love you to love me I'm begging you to beg me  Shine up my old brown shoes Put on a brand new shirt I'd get home early from work If you'd say that you love me  "I Want You to Want Me" - Cheap Trick  Guess who's back in the MF'ing house? Woo woo. Okay so now that the "gangstas" out of me... ran into Shane on Friday night and we... made... out..! Oh yeah.  So we are all at McAlan's on Friday night, hanging out having a few drinks or what not.  2 days after my surgery and I'm feeling fine.  No swelling or anything.  Anyhow, we're just sitting on the patio and I catch him in the front out of the corner of my eye.  I tell Jenni and she's just like don't say anything to him.  so sitting on the patio for a while, I look over and catch his eye and he smiles and waves.  I smile back, then I feel dumb because maybe he's not waving to me.  Anyhow, he comes over a chats it up.  Long story short we chat back and forth the whole night, the everyone ends up going back to his place cuz of course no one wants to go home and he and Chris live up the street.  anyhow, we play this cat and mouse game and it must have been the liquor talking because I was getting all kind of bold with him.  I talked to Chris and he said that Shane likes me he's just shy and timid and what not.  So we're outside and he's like - Okay i'm going to be straight with you.  So he tells me how the last month he's been flaky because an ex-girlfriend was back in his life. His mother had made the suggestion that she might be "the one" and that he shouldn't let her get away or whatever.  So he's been hanging out with her.  I was totally taken aback - not sure how to react.  So I just acted supportive and kind of told him to go for it if that's what he wants.  And he said it wasn't. That he liked me he just hadn't wanted to start anything with anyone with that whole situation happening.  But now she's leaving on the 15th.  Didn't really understand what that meant for me.  He showed me some of his poetry and he's pretty damn good.  Some was a little cliche, trying to hard to be ambitious and pretentious at times but really awesome mostly.  I felt so good, it was the first thing he did when we got to his house.  I felt like he was starting to invite me in to who he was, what he's about.  So we're in his room and he's saying he's really tired and I just tell him that he should kiss me.  And I just lay it out. I say I know you want to so just do it.  Then I'll leave you alone. But all I've wanted all night is for you to kiss me.  So he does. And it was a good, hungry kiss.  Like feeding yummy nourishment to starving kids in Africa good kiss.  I felt my stomach just drop.  It's not that he was the best kisser I've ever had, it's just that I don't think there have been too many times when I wanted a kiss that bad from someone.  So everyone is passed out in other rooms, making out and doing bad things.  I tell him i'll sleep on the couch and after a little tango he decides that we'll both just sleep in his bed (obviously what I wanted but a lady never asks...).  We lay and he complains that he has to go to work the next day, contemplating calling off.  We kiss some more, sweet, hot desire mixed with innocence and naivete. Something i haven't felt in awhile from a boy.  He strokes my hair and holds my hand, cuddling me as we lay together in his bed, just being pure.  It felt good and safe and nice, like it was supposed to be.  Then Jenni bellows my name and my fantasy is ruined cuz we're leaving.  Shane says to go with them cuz now he has to be at work in less than a couple of hours and can't take me home in the morning.  My heart is crushed.  Next day, I'm driving to Metro to volunteer and my phone rings and it's Shane calling from work to make sure we got home okay and to give me his number again (I told him that I deleted it...).  And my hope went up last night when Jeff said that boys don't call girls the next day, from work, if they don't like them.  I just thought... YAY, he'd didn't text message me.  So of course alcohol flows and makes you do things like drunk dial boys you like and with Shane's number back in the rotation of course he got a phone call.  he was in Pasadena at somewhere loud and said he loved getting drunk dials from me but he couldn't hear me cuz it was loud.  So I said, okay, bye! with a big flouish and quickly got off the phone.  Stupid, stupid girl.  Why did you call him?  So will this play out the way it did before? Will his inablility to follow through crush my heart again? i'm already in deep again cuz it never went away.  Soft whispers of beat poets and emo bands, vacations to Canada and anarchist world view. That's all i can think about.  Try to deny it all I can, I like this boy. I want to like him more.  I looked at him Friday night and he was so nerdy...but i want to be with that nerd for some reason. And I want him to want to be with me.

      I'm wasting time thinking about a girl And stealing her away from her world She and I would run away I think of all the things that I'd say We'd talk about important things And I picture it in my dreams She'd teach me about modern art And I'd show her it's okay to fart  Sometimes I sit at home and Wonder if she's sitting at home Thinking of me and wondering if I'mSitting at home, thinking about her Or am I just wasting my time  "Wasting Time" - Blink 182  Interesting weekend.  Sarah, Andy and Jeremy were in from St. Louis- andy and Jeremy were looking for apts.  I hung out with them on Saturday night.  Walked in and saw Jeremy and he looked pretty hot.  I felt the sexual tension that arose on the float trip last year come back. it was a pretty interesting feeling. Anyway, we all went out and he and i stayed up until 5 o'clock in the morning.  no making out just watching a movie.  hmmm a repeat of the float trip (no movie but staying up chit chatting).  so we decide that we might hang out sunday night depending on what was going on with the people that he was staying.  middle of the day i get a call from sarah asking if it was cool if jeremy could hang out with me cuz he couldn't get a hold of the people he was staying with. to make a long story short, i pick him up, we spend a couple of hours hanging out trying to figure out his situation. ending the night at his friend's work, eating Mexican food and talking about God knows what.   We have nothing in common.  I am repulsed by him at times. but i still can't help but be attracted to him.  Of course he's tall and super skinny and dark... a  bit of a b-boy dj so that's not really my style but i've been instantly attracted to him since day 1.  it was cute he met jac and he was like "well I'm sure i'll be seeing a lot of you..." Oh really? and how will that happen Mr. "I'm from st. louis and moving to Laguna Niguel which is an hour from La?"  I guess that's a good sign and that we'll probably be hanging out more.  I pretty much think I want to jump him.  Anyhow, he was all excited that I would be out in STL in a couple of weeks and I guess he's going to try to make a point to really hang out.  That's cool.  He's nice and I think we'd have fun because we both like to party.  But he's 28, a loser going nowhere and I know nothing could really work.  But I need a little fun in my life.  Plus did I mention he's hot?  Getting my wisdom teeth out on Weds and I'm not looking forward to that at all.  It's going to suck.  I'm pretty scared about the whole anesthesia thing.  Won't be going out cuz no money. i can't believe it's already august.  on one hand i'm happy because i'll have money soon and turn in apps soon and i'm closer to starting a new and different life.  but i'm so no ready for the gre...so scared that i've put all my chickens in this one basket that's going to break at any moment.  i've lost 3 pounds so i'm pretty stoked. i'd like to lose 6-8 more by the time i go to st. louis.  i WILL be hooking up with Jeremy and I want my hot little body to be all he thinks about until the moment his plane lands. =)
