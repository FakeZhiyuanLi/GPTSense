      dear golliwog ...  tomorrow there shall be no one to look forward seeing after school. no one to cook and have my evening meals with. no one to get cranky with , and to deafen with my high-pitched screams. no one to annoy me with his VERY lame jokes. no one to scold me when i start my rituals of never-ending handwashing.  baby i am sooo gonna miss you. i know i am no one to say this ... im just a fat chubby wubby teletubby to you, aren't i? as carrie bradshaw wrote in her article in that SATC episode we watched last weekend.. what defines a relationship? what defines OUR relationship, sayang? the time we spend with each other? the fights we have over the stupidest things? the long hours of just talking about everything and anything in the world? the fact that i know your biggest secrets and you know mine?  i dont think there is a need for a definition. why should there be?!!! as long as we are happy with each other's company, who cares what kind of relationship we have? i know its weird.  enid blyton herself would never have , in her children books, written about a china doll ( in this case one which would never admit that she came from china) falling in love with a golliwog. ( ive finally managed to find pics of a golliwog.. with an interesting article to go with it .. http://www.ferris.edu/news/jimcrow/golliwog/    i mean, who was the china doll to fall in love with this golliwog anyways?   okay lah.. i better stop now before i get too 'jiwang'. but sayang.. i will miss you TERRIBLY .. and in a way, at least i will be kept occupied with preparations for the dreaded finals. and yes, you are right .. thank your lucky stars you wouldnt be around during this coming next few weeks.. the monster in me would probably emerge way before the 'crimson tide' season and kill you before 'orang itu' does .

      This morning we had our introductory seminar for the 4-week paediatric block, me and about 15 others in the group. This morning , a particular consultant took us for a virtual walk down memory lane , and re-enter the maize that I personally have never been able to find a way out of ... BIOCHEMISTRY. honestly initially i did try ( VERY HARD) to understand what dr. M was trying to get across to us .. but after about 20 mins, i gave up .. got completely lost. The fact that this particular consultant used soooo many analogies wasnt helping either. i'm not trying to defend myself here ( cos biochem has NEVER been my cup of tea!), but had he used less analogies and given us more hard, straightforward facts to grease the rusty cogwheels in this brain of mine, i would probably have found his seminar interesting and USEFUL. i mean, a lil' bit of fancy analogy is useful but one really shouldn't go overboard with it. and to 'cement' ( im borrowing dr m's words here!) what he has 'taught' us this morning, we now have to go home and write an essay to explain the anapleurotic something something of the TCA cycle. hahaha.. something something.. i have to go ask someone else in the group what bits of the essay title ive missed out. i dont know whether i missed out on the something something because i was taken aback by this rather unfamiliar terminology ' anapleurotic' , or whether becos my ears were just playing deaf ... as usual. if that sounds like a mighty task to do with the FINALS just 5 weeks away ( gulp!) in this essay we have to explain how failure of understanding why the TCA CYCLE and the Urea cycle are actually a bi-cycle lead to the imprisonment of sally clarke and trupti patel for allegedly commiting infanticides. So God help me please ......   ps: *sigh* the day after tomorow .. is tomorow now .. i think i have cried enough in preparation for the actual moment......afterall its only gonna be for a month before i see my beloved golliwog again ....

      i still dont understand why they decided to name the 'deep impact '-like new movie , the 'day after tommorow'? if anyone else has watched it, enlighten me please?  on the whole, i dont think the movie was all that bad despite some reviews saying that it is a disastrous movie. i mean, the special effects were brilliant..but like all other Hollywood manufactured movies, it leaves me rather indignant that EVERYTHING has to happen in the US of A. Aliens land in America. UFO's are sighted in America. and in the 'day after tomorrow', Americans are the first to suffer from the climatic shift which would subsequently bring the world into the New Ice Age. hmmm.. i suppose, we should thank our lucky stars for that ...  oh well. at least the acting in this movie was so much better compared to that in TROY, in which only Peter O'Toole's acting as the old King of Sparta, land of the Trojans, was worthy enough of being called 'good acting'. Btw , i only recently found out after watching TROY that one of the actors ( Brian Cox) is dundonian. how cool is that???!  anyways, i have my own 'disaster' the day after tomorow.. well, i wouldnt actually call it a disaster .. more like a sad event lah .. oh well, we cant expect everyday to be a happy day, can we?

      Today was the final day for my 2-week geriatric block at Royal Victoria Hospital. I had stayed up till 6 this morning preparing the powerpoint presentation for the case presentation, by which we willbe assessed.Crawled into bed at 6 am feeling rather pleased with what my work and hoping that it would help me get a good grade.  Everyone else but me and Ben had their presentations in floppies. Ben had just bought his thumbdrive because he had a faulty floppy disc during our Dermy presentation and decided that a brand new thumbdrive couldnt possibly go faulty at the last minute. i had my work saved in sharizal's thumbdrive,as usual cos i was using his pc last night( my pc doesnt have powerpoint). when ben went up to present, he discovered that the laptop we were using this morning had a USB port but the driver software had not been installed. poor ben.. that was the second time this sort of thing had happened to him. but fortunately he had his presentation printed out so he just read it out from there.  all this while i was crapping in my pants .. i didnt have a hard copy of my presentation and my case notes were scattered .. i asked the tutor if i could possibly go to one of the offices and transfer my work into a floppy and he didnt seem convinced that the other comps in the hospital were equipped with working USB ports either. guess that just left me with one option ...TALK ABOUT MY PATIENT using whatever notes i had with me,just like ben had .. except my notes were really in a mess!!!so talked i did ..and omigod did i feel soo stupid!!! fortunately, the tutor was nice and didnt give me a hard time.  i managed to talk thru' the important details .. well the ones that i could remember..but now i just feel soooo INDIGNANT that i had worked so hard on that presentation and didnt get to show it off to the rest of the group.oh well.. padan my own muka ( serves me right!) for being so silly and complacent.if there is a lesson to learn from what had happened today , it is TO ALWAYS HAVE BACKUP.   i have never had this sort of prob with USB ports before. dont know if it is just a coincidence or are the comps at this particular hospital as chronologically gifted as its residents?

      advanced life support(ALS) has always been the face of the world's favourite hospital drama ER.The tv series depicts ALS as being exciting and heroic. well i suppose it is.. but it is also one of those procedures which you can bet your life on that will be one of the major stations in OSCE.. every single year.  WE had an ALS revision session at noon in lect theatre one. Felt kinda funny being LT 1 again.. as zak had put it .. it felt kinda ' nostalgic'. Fourth year is all about NOT having lectures. Obviously a lot of pple had bothered to turn up for this session.. it being like i just said, a guaranteed-to-come-out station during next week's OSCEs.  argh the OSCE's. God knows what they shall give us this year.This morn zak and i practiced several examination techniques in the revision room in clinical skills ( aka the medic's play room ). The revision room has medic toys in it .. hahaha.. namely the plastic bum for rectal examination, the pregnant abdomen with the wee 38-week old baby in it..me and zak practiced examinations on each other. surprise surprise.. deaf belinda has got really nice intact tympanic membranes ( ear drums).   My exams are in .. hmm.. lets see.. exactly one week from today. Dear God, please help me pass ..

      is it me or is dundee a ghost town come the summer months? perhaps, the fact that a large part of its population consist of university students ( who blah during this time of the year) is the reason why the city looks just so lonely and vacant. hah.. and i guess if you r opposed to having keen medical students asking you if they can do your history and physical examination, this is the best time of the year to fall ill and get ur self admitted to ninewells teaching hospital.   The second years and third years have left for their hols long ago, the fifth years are waiting for graduation next week, and the fourth years who just ended their final (tenth) block last friday are no where to be seen.. although one or two fourth year who look like racoon zombies can be spotted heading to the lifts to get to the med school office on level ten. one or two .. hmmm.. you'd expect there to be more fourth years around today .. it being THE DAY for portfolio submission.  yes, the portfolio.. the final determinant of whether one gets to get his MB or not. omigod.. i had stayed up all night last night, doing last minute amendments to my case presentations, not mention trying to finish the neurosarcoidosis patient discussion ( hahaha.. i was always doing it in bits and pieces and because it was just too damn complicated, i never was really motivated to finish it.. till today of course because i had to hand it in). oh.. and the stupid little boxes at the back of the record of achievement. stupid little boxes. one may wonder, how can something so tiny be of so much trouble? hah .. well. these little boxes dont come alone.. they come in numbers.. and huge numbers there are and my.. are they annoyingly time consuming to do. now i understand why everyone makes a fuss about the little boxes.. hahaha.. and to think i only tried to do them the night of submission.   GOD .. im tired. okie bloggie.. talk to you tomorrow.

      if ever there was a synonym to the word stupid, i think BELINDA would be good. why are you so belinda? god. being stupid belinda ( ie stupid stupid) isnt very good for ur life either is it?   today i think i must have won myself the title of the STUPIDEST person in this whole wide world. i had worked hard for this title.. without even realising it, and i think what happened today just proves to me that yep, ive won the stupidity title for two years running.   TWICE. and i still havent learnt my lesson. i seriously feel like kicking myself hard in the arse if its anatomically possible. if i werent so penggeli, id actually flush my head in the toilet to make myself SEDAR. WAKE UP. see the REAL WORLD. know who ur friends are. Know who the pple who actually CARE about u are.  hah .. im really screwed up now.

      whenever i start the day with no anticipation of whats to happen, ie dont expect the worst and dont expect the best either .. ie just dont expect anything .. just start the day 'numb'ly .. it almost always turns out to be more on the good side. today was an example of such a day. yesterday i did go and see the CF patient at half5 but he was just too unwell to speak to me so i had to leave it till today. but this morn he was bright and cheery and gave me a good, complete history. i was in the ward all morning and after lunch i went back and see if i could present the case but there wasnt a single doctor around in the ward. i went to the GP bay and no doctors there as well.. d-uh and no new admissions for me to clerk in either. My groupmates, lucy and stuart were actually playing with the kids.. lucy is on call today and stuart timetabled for the play verandah. i didnt think it would help me pass my exams if i joined them playing with the kids so here i am .. about to start typing the CF case history i took in this morning. I just found out from stuart that we did not have to present a case every single day for the attendance signature.. we just have to attend the wards. d-uh.. and ive been running around like a mad rabbit trying to get cases to present.. not that ive got many. But thats good news.  ohh... the Bollywood star search ended last night with the fat lady Rupak mann winning the competition. japs nak gelak japs.. EHEHEHEHEHE .. EHEHHEHEHEHEH ... i am not laffing cos she;s fat .. im laffing to show that FAT PPLE CAN WIN. like that girl who won Pop idol.. michelle.. she is clinically obese as well.. and she is the UK's reigning POP IDOL. ironically tho'.. now that the bollywood star search has ended, channel 4 has decided to replace it with a prog about fat pple called YOU ARE WHAT YOU EAT.  last night i felt a deep pang of missing golliwog. eh? is that correct usage of the word pang? heh watever. Its been a couple of days since he last called.. just 2 days but when u r used to talking to someone every single day .. 2 days seem like an eternity. i sent him a very sarcastic email just now.But one thing about this guy is that sarcasm doesnt quite work on him .. oh well. If he cares for me.. he would call first.End of story.

      phew! if there were a single fat paediatrician in this hospital i'd be surprised. omigod.. its only my first day in ward 29 and i think ive walked miles. Been on my feet all day .. the ward rounds and teaching sessions included. Hey .. wait a minute there IS one fat paediatrician .. but since im fat myself .. im not allowed to make fat jokes about other people. Its blasphemy.   ward 29 itself is not huge, neither does it have a long corridor. however, it is situated on level 4 ( i think) and to get to the stairs which lead to this ward, one would have to walk the whole length of the main entrance lobby and all the way again along another long corridor. The fact that ward 29 is the sister ward of ward 33 ( the GP bay where kids get admitted after being refered by their GPs) does not help either.Ward 33 is only level 8 and through yet more corridors.   its past 5pm and i am still here in the hospital bcos the kid i am wanting to clerk in has not come in yet, even tho' he was meant to be here half an hour ago. i am soooo tired. I only had like 3 hours sleep last night, and now i feel like i could do with a warm bath and snuggle under my duvet and have a long snooze. Unfortunately, i dont think that will happen just yet. I need to get this paed case history out of the way so i can do it tonite. The reason why i have decided to wait for this particular patient is because he has got Cystic Fibrosis and there is so much u can write about CF.. not to mention the core clinical problems that you can find in a patient with CF.   yeah.. the dundee curriculum, besides governing its student's lives with the abominable book of signatures (the Record of Achievement), is absolutely obsessed with core clinical problems. Example of a typical core clinical problem that you might expect to find in this block - FAILURE TO THRIVE. another example of a ccp ... one ud probably find in general medicine - nausea. If the patient you have just clerked in and examined fully has a problem which is NOT one of the core 108 clinical problems listed in your Year 4 handbook, you can't use that patient for your portfolio. Helllo ... like there are only 108 problems in this bizarre medical world that patients can present with?!!!  ok i am sick and tired talking about medicine. the fact that we have been in 'close proximity' since 2000 .. me and medicine, i have long since decided that its going to be a tough love and hate relationship. So no, medicine is NOT the love of my life. Was.  Speaking of love and relationships, one of my juniors and one of my seniors are getting married next month! To each other, i mean , my jr and the snr. hehehe.. I can still remember the time when i heard about their budding relationship .. and now they are actually getting married! its just too bad that i wont be able to make it to their wedding tho'...hehe.. i know she reads my blog sometimes .. im saving my congrats till after the wedding .. hopefully she will post up pictures of her getting all dolled up for her big day on our dundee community webpage.. yeeee.. best nyer kaween...   best kawin if you know the person u r gonna marry is THE one. goodness me .. golliwog always says there will be THE one for me out there. so does my best friend mazure who says the love of my life is actually in 'hiding' and will show himself when the time is right. d-uh .. whatever bush he is hiding behind is probably rotting away by now and the so-called love of my life has, having seen my recent failed relationships, probably been crapping in his pants not wanting to have anything to do with me.  oh-oh its 530. better go and see if patient is here ...

      I was all ambitious to get at least one yellow admission form done today.. so at least one out of the way would leave me with less to worry about this week ( which is the final week of the block). like zak had adviced me, i had gone to the GP bay and enquire about any new admissions.. there were only 2 - one of which the kid had already gone to theatre and another who was not going to be admitted admitted but only in for the day. I was disheartened .. nurse told me there really wouldnt be any way to predict what time new admissions would come in .the admission board was virtually empty .. i thought .. fine, then perhaps i'll just tag along the reg or SHO-on call and see if i could get other tasks done. ( Mind you , im only on call for Ward 40 today but then again ive already done the oncall last week.. and none of my sub-group mates even bother doing their second round of Ward 40on call .. im only here to get admissions for the GP bay..but it looks like i shouldve just stayed home and revised!) back to reg and SHO oncall.. yipeee!! wasnt i delighted when i saw who was on the ward today ... NOTT!!! my second favourite junior doctor in the world ... hahahahahha yeah right! The slutty PRHO who was part of the duo who made my life in Ward 10 (surgical) during my surgery 3 block a living nightmare ... this one was the 'milder' of the two .. the other PRHO .. god , a good example of how some jr doctors can be even more fat-headed than consultants! anyways .. the moment i spotted this slutty doctor .. who unlike the days when i was with the team in ward 10 was always clad in some 'tak cukup kain' attire .. ironically ward 10 is also the 'breast (cancer) ward' .. was today dressed like she was ready to attend some Mela or diwali function or something .. sad sad .. she doesnt have anywhere to dress like that but to the wards so the patients can drool at the sight of her..Oh btw .. she's my fellow country(wo)man .. but like that helps when u think all ur juniors who dont suck up to you are stupid and worthless??!! grrr .. im so worked up, arent i?  anyways when i saw her.. i thought .. hmmm what the heck! i dont even have to be in that ward today anyways .. so i am not bothering to hang around wasting more time waiting for some poor kid to be admitted .. i have lots of things of other important things to do. Like revising for the exams. Did quite a lot of reading yesterday .. which was interspersed with classical moments of wondering where all the bits i had revised weeks earlier had gone, and wondering why didnt i start this revision sooner ..never mind never mind. Menyesal dulu pendapatan ... menyesal kemudian tiada gunanya .. ehehekehek  Mom called to wake me up this morn at 530 am ( hahaha.. yeah thats me .. long-distant wake up calls) and told me my youngest bro Ebby had emerged champion in the dewan undangan negeri chess competition and bagged himself a huge trophy and RM200 cash. dad texted me again at about 8 am ..hahaha .. just to make sure i know about this! ;-P hehehhe.. i texted home to ask them to call me just now .. and ebby was disappointed that it was me who wanted to speak to him .. not mahathir .. d-uh .. i  know lah he cannot brag to me about the game he had played cos i havent a clue how to play chess.  Mom says the showcase at home is now full now that ebby is contributing all the trophies and what not from his chess competitions. I said to mom .. get a new showcase .. but methinks my time of contributing to our showcase of academic and extra co-curriculum achievements is slowly reaching the end. :-(  yesterday i motivated myself to study by conjuring up an image of how i would spend the first day of my holiday when i get to see golliwog again. i told him.. i just want to kick off my shoes and walk barefooted along the beach .. and indulge in the warm equatorial sun. aaahh.. thats the life innit? cant wait cant wait cant wait!!!!!!!   i told myself because i sooo want to enjoy my ten week summer break .. i dont want to worry about doing re-sits so im gonna give it all my best .. if i pass.. i will enjoy my hols to the MAX!   zak came over to the flat yesterday to borrow my psychiatric patient write up .. omigod ive been procrastinating finishing my patient writeups .. when she came i thought i better deal with my huge pile of patient notes etc .. i have such a messy pile that i couldnt find the write up so had to give her a soft copy of it. aiyer ... and i told myself at the start of the year that i will be more organized this year. hah... obviously that resolution has remained just another unachieved resolution. ....

      i love summer.As the shuttle bus left the main campus this morn on its way to 9wells, i realised just how beautiful and harmonious everything looks at this time of the year. Makes me forget how, for the last 4 years, all ive ever known this place to be was a wet, angry little city. I think maybe one of the reasons why i love this hot hot weather is because it reminds me so much of home. hahaha.. yes, i still get homesick after all these years ... Before he himself had a taste of living in a foreign country, my brother Mahathir could never see the logic in me coming home every year. He thought it was just a waste of money .. and time. He says i'd be better off using the money i used to go home to go travelling or something. Hah .. he's been here for the last 9 months or so .. and methinks he now sees why i yearn to go home all the time, because the exact same thing is happening to him. Goes to show that my bro is not exactly half as adventurous as he would like to think!  Confession : i did not do any studying last night. Is that bad??? I do feel kinda guilty now because now .. every minute, every second counts. But last night i think i just didnt have the motivation to do anything. I wasnt sleepy so i didnt go to bed early. I was just .. bored. I made myself a simple dinner of prawn-flavoured fried rice to which i added some tuna and ate with cherry tomatoes ( god .. i love these!!!) and some coleslaw... and turned the telly on. I wasnt even motivated to watch tv but i just turned it on anyways. I watched some bits of 'City of Angels' which i think is a whole load of crap .. last night was the second time ive watched it and i still dont think the idea of an angel falling in love with a mortal is at all romantic.. d-uh ..Then the last episode of 'Human Mutants' which i missed last week was on. There were a lot of repetitions in the programme, as in they keep saying the same things over and over again. i dont even want to talk about what they showed in the prog cos it was all too boring and did not add any useful knowledge to register in this perpetually cluttered brain of mine. After that i watched some bits of BIG BROTHER which was kinda boring as well cos i wasnt following it as closely as zak does .. gosh .. this friend of mine is an avid fan of big brother hehehe.. In the end i decided to take a hot shower.. and went to bed after spending almost an hour with zak on d phone. I do know the underlying reason for my low mood last night .. and i am kinda annoyed with myself for letting it interfere with my revision.

      if the productivity of my day as a 4MB in dundee were to be dictated by the rate at which the signatures in my ROA and paeds log book are obtained, as well as the number of flights of stairs and the countless long corridors i have to endure in order to get these signatures, then i would say today has been quite a productive day. 2 signatures in logbook and 2 in the ROA , as well as the exasperating green form done and over with. Omigoodness , i have never walked so much in my life. well.. no thats a lie .. i have walked a lot before but havent done so in ages .. and this afternoon omigod .. up and down up and down and along this corridor and that.. wonder how many calories ive burnt? hahaha.. ive probably compensated for the calorie loss with the cheese and onion sandwiches i made for my bekal today ...  i made one more sandwich than usual cos i am, as defined by the low-batt pager hanging onto my belt, on acute on call for WARD 40. hahahah .. its actually not even half as grand as it sounds. i know when my friends in the years above me had to be on call i used to think it was exciting .. i suppose it could be if not for the fact i have my exams looming ahead of me .. this huge dark boulder which is blocking my view of the holidays. but nah .. the SHO oncall had acknowledged herself that she doesnt expect me to hang about because of the coming exams.   hahaha.. the biochem essay for dr m is finally coming into existence .. having procrastinated about doing it the last two weeks, i finally decided to sit down and do it last night.. well i have the anapleurotic role of the TCA cycle all sorted out .. now just have to link it all to the cases of trupti patel and sally clarke.   yesterday, the stress of the exams and the portfolio preparations really got to me. golliwog says i just think too much.. and too fast. he said IF i could do work at the same rate as the rate at which i think, id have all my work done in no time. he taught me a technique yesterday .. which i have tried but yet to see its positive affect on my emotional self control .. hahah.. golliwog does act like he's my personal psych sometimes. he told me to .. whenever i feel myself panicking .. or whenever i am needing a break.. to clear my mind.. just empty it and not think of anything. he says its because im always thinking that i always seem to be the world's greatest worrier. thank u sayang .. god i miss him sooo much. He kept saying it wont be long before we see each other again .. but i dont really like him to remind me because it also meant that it wont be long before my exams.   ohhhh ... the prank calls have stopped. thank god .. the minyak ive been saving in that old nescafe jar was beginning to stink .. muahahahahahhaha .. ( *evil laugh again*)

      My aim for today is to get my green form done. Stupid green form. I cant believe ive been doing it since yesterday and i still havent finished it. It is NOT as easy as it looks .. i mean .. sure you get all the info from the baby's notes etc but it just isnt THAT easy ... because the stupid form wants you to explain and justify the info you have just obtained. Its a good thing the African SHO with the unique forename ( 'sayang lebih') was around today and more than willing to go through some of the details with me. Its good that he was around too cos he went through the dubowitz scoring chart with me and the rest. But i still need to finish the green form ..   I think im not in the best of my moods today .. main reason being : i still havent finished the all exasperating green form. Plus the prank calls have not stopped. I dont want to bother myself thinking about the calls .. like i dont have a zillion other things to think about.. but if the calls occur every single night to you, wouldnt you start to wonder who is making these fucking ( i cant be bothered to be polite now ..) stupid calls.. and WHY?????? last night i only had one and i didnt even hear the phone ring cos i was in the bathroom. i told zak if i could i would want to put a hoax on the culprit .. hahaha.. perhaps the perpetrator does not realize that i am a sarawakian afterall ( and a quarter melanau at that!) and if you go by the many stories that have been generated about us sarawakian is our ability to do 'black magic' or to make minyak or crap yang seumpama dgn nya.. and being part melanau means i do have the capacity .. although i have yet to try it out .. to turn my head 180 degrees... hahahahha .. so better watch out laa whoever is making these bloody calls .. you never know.. there may just be a potent potion in making to make you so sick you wish you were never born .. muahahahahhaa ( evil laugh )!!!!!!!!  Btw i watched the 3rd episode of Bollywood Stars last night. This time they have filtered the 6 finalists and there are only 4 left to compete for the chance to star in a major Bollywood film. And guess what? The underdogs made it .. the white drama student who, although she is a good actress and has a pretty face is a terrible dancer .. and the fat girl whom i am actually glad to have gotten through to the next round. I am a bit disappointed that the bitch sofia got through .. man she is a real bitch! no wonder her mom disowned her ... Last night's episode reminded me just how populated India is .. and how huge the gap is between the rich and the poor. They showed the slums where the poor live .. and sofia, being the airhead that she is , took pictures of the slums .. nothing wrong with that .. what was wrong was when she said .. she thinks she is a very artistic person and she saw artistic beauty in the slums .. TELL ME IF THAT ISNT JUST PLAIN IDIOTIC.  Argghh ... gottaa .. finnishhh .. thhhaaatt.. greeenn.. form. I knew that the baby i had chosen to write about in my form is a twin but i just realised this morning that i had been thinking it was twin2 when i had actually written down twin1's details .. i mean its a good thing this does not affect whatever i have written down in my form in anyway .. but just interesting how i couldve let such a mistake happen!

      This week i have been assigned to Ward 40 , which basically is the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit as my base ward, but I should also attend other wards like the postnatal ward as well.Or so it states on the timetable.  Today I have been timetabled for postnatal wards but i had to attend the morning ward rounds in NICU as well. As far as first impressions go .. the doctors in NICU are NICE. Again when i say nice, i mean they dont actually give u a hard time and even if ure stuck and cannot answer their questions, they dont give any nasty remarks which would leave you feeling smaller than the babies in NICU itself. So yeah .. ive decided that the doctors im gonna work with this week are nice.. so shouldnt be too bad a week afterall.. The babies in NICU are all, as would be expected tiny and most are prems, needing lots of support and attention. Some of them have been in the ward for months .. and it occured to me .. goodness.. sian the mom cos she wont be able to have much time to bond with her baby just yet .. well.. i suppose she would have some time when she goes to visit the baby or to feed him.. but its not like you have the baby with you AT HOME. ...hmm.. i just realised that the SHO in postnatal is off to a clinic this afternoon so i think i should make good use of my time to get that green infant admission sheet done.Argh .. i have to try and make good use of my time so i dont panic at the last minute. Im still indignant by the fact that the only acute on call i have during ward 29 next week is the night before the final submission of all written work. What the f**K???!!! I think, seriously, whoever created these timetables mustve forgotten that we medical students are still human beings afterall.. there isnt even such a thing as a super-doc.. so would u expect there to be a super-medical student??????!!!  Yesterday i went home feeling a bit down, especially since it was 6pm by the time i reached the flat and golliwog hadnt called me. I wasnt really expecting him to call yesterday because we had already talked for quite a long time on sunday. however , he did call at midnight.. and told me some very interesting news!!! goodness me .. just thinking about it makes me feel like i cant wait to get this exams done and over with!!!hahaha..    oh .. and the mysterious prank call occured again last night at about the same time. ah . malas ku mikir hal tok doloks ehs..  i told golliwog about this and he thinks it just MIGHT be that person .. but then like me, he thought that person wouldve actually said something instead of just keeping quiet. i dont know i dont give a damn. zak thinks it could also be some random prank caller cos she's had some experience of THAT before.. well.. methinks the next time i actually think its my prankcaller and not my mom/golliwog .. i wouldnt bother being polite ...

      i didnt think this sounded like TLC when i first heard it but its goood... throughout the weekend i decided to try some of the songs in 'HENRY SELECTA'.. the folder which the dude had inaptly named 'satanic shit'. Henry dude, you have some really good shite in there!! now ive got me hooked on the likes of the cardigans, tori amos, fiona apple and the rest ... oh and this one from TLC ..  I Miss You So Much"  I never asked for this feeling  I never thought I would fall  I never knew how I felt  Till the day you were gone  I was lost  I never asked for red roses  I wasn't looking for love  Somehow I let my emotions take hold  And guess what all at once I'm in love  [Chorus:] Oh I miss you so much  I long for your love  It's scares me  Cuz my heart gets so weak  That I can't even breathe  How can you take things so easily  Baby why aren't you missing me?  Why did I act like you mattered It was silly of me to believe  That if I just opened my heart  Things would come naturally Jokes on me (yeah) I did not ask for love letters So why did you give them to me How could I let your intentions Get hold over me So in love So naive (oh baby)  [Chorus]  And oh how I hate what you have done  Made me fall so deep in love  Got no cure  You're the only one I want  That I love oh baby  [Chorus]  Baby why aren't you missing me?  Baby why aren't you missing me?

      The weekend is over( again) and Monday is now here .. again. God i hate Mondays ... Although i had psyched myself to stay up this morning to do work, i ended up sleeping anyways .. right through the morning. Was about to leave the flat to take the bus to Ninewells when i decided to check the timetable for today's seminars. Well guess what? Seminars dont start till 12 ..Since i was just about ready to leave flat anyways, i decided to just go out and instead of taking bus to the hosp i walked to the main campus so I could take the free shuttle bus later. So here i am at the IT suites in the tower building .. feeding my blog .. hahahha.. im kinda pleased with myself for being able to keep this blogspot 'alive' for quite awhile now. I have tried blogging many times before and none of them have survived more than one or two entries.  My weekend has been fairly uneventfull... ohh ohh.. what am i talking about? Uneventful? I forgot all about the phone calls. yeps .. On saturday, after i had finished speaking on the phone with my best friend, two 'private number' calls were made to my mobile and each time i answered, the call was ended. I thought it might be my best friend but then when i called him back , he said it wasnt him. Then last night the exact same thing happened.. 2 more. Only this time, the caller held on long enough during the first call for me to repeat my hellos and the second time, i didnt even have time to pick it up before the call was ended. I told my brother about it, and initially he thought it was golliwog who was trying to play a joke on me .. but i knew of course it wasnt golliwog because of the time those calls were made ( last night's were made at about midnight). Plus i know golliwog wouldnt think of making such calls as much of a joke! My bro then suggested the possibility of THAT person making those calls .. i said.. HOW? how COULD THAT PERSON POSSIBILY KNOW MY MOBILE NUMBER???!! plus .. i doubt that person would just hang up on me after making a longdistant call.. that person would most likely speak his/her mind out and tell me how he/she felt about me .. not like that person has not done that already. Im just hoping that whoever are making this phone calls would stop soon. I mean.. hell its not me who is paying for the calls .. if anyone wishes to confront me .. if they have this burning desire to tell me anything .. JUST DO IT. Calling me and not saying anything whenever i answer is just F**KING STUPID.

      what is it with me that makes me so prone to have relationships jinxed with BIG issues?   last night i had another fight with him. Yes, another. And it all stems from the fact that i am bothered with the BIG issue which has been haunting our relationship eversince the day he told me  that there was this BIG issue. Hell .. my ex had the same kind of BIG issue and now ... i told myself that i would never ever get tangled up with BIG-issue ( err... i dont mean the magazine sold by the homeless) guys. Even gave the same advice to my ex's sister who is herself like a sister to me. And having survived such a traumatic relationship which was damaged by the BIG issue anyways .. am I any wiser???   The fact is i am starting to have some feelings of affection for him now .. and with that affection, there often is an associated possessiveness as well. I mean, the BIG issue bothers me .. not a LOT but it does. And i regret the fact that because i am letting this BIG issue to bother me, i always tend to find faults with him .. and end up being like your classical shrew .. which i dont think i am.. or am I?  i told myself .. there are many ways to deal with this so-called BIG issue i have with him. I know that the BIG issue shall only stop bothering me once i stop loving him. It will never go away ... it will stay with him forever because that's just what he is. A guy with a BIG issue. My options are .. leave him and hence the BIG issue shall automatically no longer be a BIG issue for me, or continue this BIG-issued relationship regardless of the BIG issue ( ie ignoring it completely), or to confront this BIG issue and try to resolve it myself .. which is impossible because like i said this BIG issue is permanent. No way around it.  *sigh* .. BIG issue or no BIG issue i want him to know that i dont mean to be nasty to him .. i dont mean to holler at him like some mad woman. its just that i am bothered by this BIG issue. God, i wish one day i could just wake up and find that this BIG issue would have miraculously decided to disappear on its own ...

      this morning i decided to turn up for my paeds' outpatient clinic even tho' i have already got all 5 required signatures, in the hope that this time i could get to do some examination and get THAT signed off. i was punctual.. right on the dot at 9 and guess what? i waited for 40 minutes before the clinic actually started. the last time i was timetabled for outpatients i came at 9;15 and two consultants had asked me where i was at 9. see .. when you're early NOBODY NOTICES but when you're late .. ooohhh nobody forgets. oh puh-leeessss ... i was also punctual for the 11;30 teaching but did that take place? NOoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo..... we have to come back at 2pm if we are free. I have free study until 4pm cos im supposed to see the specialist nurse then and even she hasnt confirmed with me whether or not i get to shadow her this evening. sapa sik gerammmm???   i mean if i had all the free time in the world i wouldnt want to be kept waiting around, and my exams are in a few weeks time! would i want to be kept waiting????   ok.. calm down belinda.. calm down. THIS IS LIFE. and i havent even started working yet.

      while combing my hair in front of my mirrror last nite, i noticed that my forehead seems to be getting wider. If i were an airport, my forehead would probably one of the runways at KLIA ( see? im patriotic.. i couldve said Heathrow .. but no.. im VERY MALAYSIAN .. hahaha) Unfortunately, im not getting any smarter. Im saying this just to refute the idea that pple with wide foreheads are supposed to be more intellectually advantaged. hah .. i wish!  I just had another teaching session with dr m .. and like the last time, i came out of the room feeling like i knew less than when i went in. He was nice tho'.. in the sense that he didnt pick on any one of us .. unlike some consultants who absolutely loooove picking on students and making them feel like midgets. it was a cardiology teaching session .. and hmmpphh.. ol' 'handsome boy' whom i had mentioned in one of my previous posts turned out to know his stuff afterall. i never said he was stupid.. i just said he was a SNOB.   last night i watched this programme on the telly .. cant remember the name of it .. about this competition where the winners get to go to india and undergo intensive training to star in some bollywood movie or something. (thanks zak for reminding me!) it was an enjoyable watch .. all these shah-rukh and kajol wannabes .. part of the audition required the participants to act out a scene given to them on the spot. omigoodness.. and they have to be EXTRA melodramatic and theatrical .. bcos thats what bollywood movies are all about, aren't they? anyways.. the chosen 6 have been announced and next week they're gonna show the British public the kind of training and what-have-u's these 6 underwent in India. oh.. one of these 6 is a caucasian drama student who doesnt speak a word of Hindi.. and she wants to star in a bollywood film. go figure ......

      i got really upset just now all because of a silly nickname. it is silly really .. me thinking i was ever the original of the original. nvm.  well.. it seems that things between me and him are going to change now. it has to. i cannot remain 'principle-less' forever. i need to take a stand. know where i am at. but i know deep down, even if our relationship takes a different turn from where i want it to go, i shouldnt be disheartened. cos this person has made a huge impact on my life .. he made my life away from home much more bearable. to the extent, that i actually think of this place as my second home.  i know i should be thankful because i was destined to meet this wonderful person. even though circumstances are not what i want them to be, its for a good reason, i am sure.  anyways .. enough of the mushy2 talk. today i felt kinda broody having been in the paeds outpatient clinic am-pm. omigod.. babies.. how u not adore them? really want one of my own.. but for now, i guess its just wishful thinking.

      omigod omigod omigod ... was i amused this morning when i logged onto my friendster account,and saw that i had 15 .. yes 15 new msgs .. and none of them were from pple i knew. ALL were from guys who had seen the hot pic of sarimah i had posted up.. thinking it was me .. sorry guys. it was just an experiment .. and the results of the trial ( heheh.. the next statement is EVIDENCE-BASED) : GUYS go for LOOKS. well.. not all guys ( i know a particular one who doesnt.. )but MOST guys. goodness gracious me ... ive taken off sarimah's photo from my page. End of experiment.   God.. how much more 'bongok' can these pple be?!!!! I had actually also put my OWN photos there .. the FAT real me .i donno why i donno why some pple are just 'blinded' by beauty they can only see with their eyes but not with their heart and mind.   i have since long ago given up going gaga over the cutest guys .. the reason being besides the fact that they wouldnt take a second glance at me anyways ( unless of course i really look like sarimah), but becos i know , half of these guys probably dont have as much a personality as 'average' looking pple anyways. and most thing is, they will be soo narcissistic about their good looks. haiyoh i can go on and on about this and i have SO MANY GOOD EXAMPLES of such guys whom i know personally.  as a matter of fact, i was just telling my good friend, DR afifah nadia hussin ( oooh.. feef you're a DR now ) yesterday how annoyed i was at a particular so-called 'handsome boy' in my paeds subgroups. i dont know whether it was just me being over-judgemental .. or whether this dude really is a big snob. see.. being malaysian,i tend to like getting to know other malaysians in the medschool.. whether they were here since first year like myself or whether they came in fourth year ( the IMU students). now this particular dude was from IMU .. and apparently he had been in some TV ad back home in malaysia. good looking mmg laa good looking .. but omigod. sombong gila .. there are 2 other IMU students in my group and they are really nice and friendly. but this guy, he gives you very short abrupt answers when u ask him questions and obviously prefers the company of the mat-sallehs.   ok. there ive had my say ... and guys, pls dont be offended. I know some ( well not many but a few) guys who have BOTH LOOKS AND PERSONALITY and not half as snobbish or 'empty'.

      There was much hype in the malaysian newspapers about the 128 students who had excelled in the recent STPM, but had failed to secure themselves a place to read medicine in any of the local universities. One of the reasons ( or excuses) that the govt gave for this was the fact that these students, in spite of achieving an excellent overall grade, had obtained an A- (???!!) in some of the subjects, or possibly in the breakdown of the exam papers sat .. Never sat for STPM myself so i dont know exactly how STPM candidates are graded. However, the govt being the ever sympathetic, concerned-for-its-nation's-welfare ruling party .. has cleverly devised a way of 'absorbing' ( sorry .. this is direct translation hehehe .. 'serap') these students into the medical faculties in the local u's.  Today, there was an interesting letter in the Forum section of utusan malaysia stating that excellent students should try and have a wider option of future careers and not be bogged down by wanting to do medicine alone, and later be disappointed when they fail to secure a place. The contributor of this letter also suggested that a lot of wanna-be doctors choose to do medicine due to family pressure, the desire to make easy money, to raise their 'saham' or simply because medicine is a glam career.  Funny that i should be reading this letter today. Last night, the levels of stress over the coming finals had overwhelmed me to the point where i thought to myself, 'is this really what i want in life?' If I had the option of turning back time, would i have done something different? Mind you, this is NOT the first time i have asked myself this question.   And time and again, i think. NO i wouldnt have chosen to do anything else. But i would have chosen to stay in Malaysia.   But just going back to the letter i had read in the Utusan forum, i have to admit some bits about pple wanting to do medic are quite true. To one who has not had a taste of what its like to be studying medicine, it may seem like a really glamourous, romantic career ( i suppose ER should be blamed for this!!! and NO, i dont like ER). Its far from being glam, trust me. Its a LOT OF HARD WORK ... and if you are unlucky enough to have really nasty seniors ( Read : i dont mean the people who are in the year above), it can have quite a debilitating effect to your confidence and self-esteem. From the 'saham' aspect of it all.. hmm.. a lot of prospective mother-in-laws drool when they find out their sons ( or daughters) are dating a future doctor. But again, it really is NOT worth going into medicine just for this!! The risk outweighs the benefit heheheh... Money? Hmm.. i suppose for those working in the UK, the money isnt too bad .. but from what ive heard from reliable sources in malaysia.. the starting wages for a junior houseman are atrociously low. The engine people earn a whole lot money than the medic pple, or so they tell me.  oh well.. for whatever reason one has decided to go into medicine, there really should be much consideration as to whether one would be willing to devote one's entire life to it.. it is .. shall i reiterate again.. HARD WORK.. even before one qualifies as a doctor. A colleague once pointed out to me that the so-called medical student syndrome does exist as a clinical diagnosis.. i dont know whether this is true or not tho'.  as for me .. there is no turning back now, even if i wanted to.

      today i spent one whole day sitting in the ADHD clinic at Dudhope Terrace, and had the opportunity to see for myself the classical picture of a kid with this disorder. omigoodness..i mean, you cant blame them for having ADHD, but i suppose to be a parent with ADHD, one would have to have that extra degree of patience. one kid kept interrupting his dad who was answering the doctor's questions, and kept wanting to finish it all and go home. when his dad ignored him, he whistled and whistled.. it was soo annoying even for me as an onlooker ( but all the time i told myself .. he's got ADHD .. he's got ADHD).. and the dad.. wow.. i wish my dad had his patience. so calm and undisturbed by his son's whistling and whining.  i felt like i was doing psych all over again ... arrghh tidakk!!! and almost forgot i was doing paeds instead ( yeah .. as if that's much of a consolation.)which reminds me i have to go and call that specialist nurse to fix a day when i can follow her.  anyways something someone told me last night made me re-think about stuff, and whether or not i should feel guilty or am i in a situation where i have to do what i am doing in order to save myself .. albeit at the expense of others?  had a thought about all this last night and suddenly remembered something about my bro mahathir which i suppose would make quite a good analogy.  my brother knows best NEVER to wear his best slippers or shoes to the mosque for FRIDAY prayers. the reason? well.. apparently some pple who go for Prayers seem to forget that stealing ( footwear in this case) is a sin regardless of whether you have already completed the 'wajib' prayers.   one funny thing is that, once these shoe/slipper snatchers do their thing, it starts a whole vicious cycle. my bro once came home wearing a pair of slippers which wasn't the pair he went in. he told me since someone had stolen his slippers he had nothing to walk back home in so he simply continued the vicious cycle and snitched another pair from the hundreds of slippers 'parked' at the mosque exit.  Should my bro feel guilty in what he had commited? he did it because circumstances forced him to.  well.. he didnt feel guilty because he felt he had to do it.   In my case, i dont know whether or not i should feel guilty. I dont know if the circumstance i am in is suffice for me to commit what i have committed.

      i have an appointment to see my dentist in two hours time. This would be my first dentist appointment ever in the U.K.. Come to think of it, methinks this is my first dentist appointment for ages. I can't remember when was the last time i went to have my oral cavity checked or examined. goodness gracious me .. no wonder my gums are acting up! i havent been heeding the well-known recommendation that one should go and see her dentist at least every half-yearly. Well, at least ive been brushing my teeth twice daily and changing my toothbrush every 3 months.   ( hahaha.. i remember the dentist i used to see when i was a kid .. he was Indian. a very nice man, and his twin worked in the same practice as well. their dad who is also a dentist even has a road in kuching named after him ..this dentist dude was MY dad's  friend or something. BEWARE: what i am about to write about next has absolutely NOTHING to do with TEETH or GUMS or Dentistry. i must've been about 8 or 9 , and at that age, i was not only a magpie, i was an INQUISITIVE magpie. at that age, i had already decided i wanted to be a doctor when i grew up, and i thought, well if i want to be a doctor i should know about things related to the human body. things like how babies were made... hahaha.. so i approached dad and asked him, ' dad, how are babies made?' hahah.. i cant really remember how dad reacted to my question but no .. dont worry, he didnt go on to tell me about the birds and the bees and all that crap .. he simply said , ' well.. since tomorrow you are going to see the dentist, why dont you ask him? afterall, a dentist is a kind of doctor ..' so the next day, in came the eight year old me, about to have her tooth extracted or cavity filled ( i cant remember!!) and asked the dentist the exact same question i had asked my dad. sorry pple.. i cannot remember his answer .. what i DO remember is i left the surgery feeling still VERY dissatisfied with whatever reply he gave .. i still did not know how babies were made. guess my good ol' dad sensed my dissatisfaction .. and later he gave me a BOOK ( nope .. not about sex but about raising babies) .. and i think there mustve been a chapter in there about answering questions like mine.. but for crying out loud, I WAS ONLY IN PRIMARY TWO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i guess i just gave up trying to find out how babies are made ..but don't worry, being an ex-Lodgian ( nothing against Lodge, but if you wr an ex-Lodgian yourself.. you might understand .. ), i managed to get the answer to my question in primary 4. ( haiyah .. that sounded kinda dodgy .. sorry ! some smart alec told me laah) hahaha..the point i am trying to make here is : WHAT WAS DAD THINKING WHEN HE TOLD ME TO ASK MY DENTIST ABOUT SEX? ( i guess i should be forgiven for actually asking the dentist cos i was only eight .... )  anyways , back to the present day .. with the 24 year-old me .. who knows what there needs to be known about human reproduction ( NB: Im a MEDICAL student and an obstetrician-wannabe .. so dont start having a dodgy impression of me  now ... !!!), i am kinda intimidated by the thought of seeing the dentist. hopefully i would get a proper dentist and not a dentistry student ( since my appointment is at the University of Dundee Dental hospital AND SCHOOL). ive tried giving myself a differential diagnosis as to why i am getting this bleeding gums ... and trying to exclude the obviously unrelated ones like anticoagulants and pregnancy-induced hormonal changes. it could be gingivitis .. arrghh .. hell no .. i hope not , tho' i think it might actually be ..oh well. im not the dentist. let the dentist make the Dx.ive got about an hr and a half left.d-uh.. was hoping to be seen right away when i went to register .. but no, sorry theyre too busy could i come back later? was hoping to go to the surgical wards in Ninewells and get more signatures for my Record of Achievement .. maybe will do that after i get the diagnosis from my dentist.   btw .. good old golliwog called this morning.. glad everything went okay. golliwog molliwog .. cant wait to see you after the exams ..

      it was a good thing my student number for this paeds block is 12, because that meant i had the whole morning off for ' free study'.   I didnt do any free studying .. instead, i went with my golliwog to the Mega bus station to send him off. Having cried consistently over the last couple of days whenever i thought of his leaving today , i thought i could manage not to cry this morning. But of course... i cried again. Why shouldnt i? My best friend is going home and i am doomed to have 5 weeks of loneliness before my final exams. But if i try to think of it from a different angle, i realise that at least HE would be happy to go home. I would. I mean, who wouldnt want to go home to family and friends whom are terribly missed?   *sigh* i better stop wallowing in self sympathy.

      leaving dundee tomorrow. yeaah!!! waitin' to see kak minn cos she'll be leaving dundee in august for good.. isk isk... my sis angkat. One of the reasons why i chose dundee over aberdeen and leeds.   anyways.. the following has been copied from www.utusan.com.my. thought i'd paste it on my blog for my own personal reading in future.. hahahahah. MY DAD SHOULD REALLY READ THIS!!! especially  the last bit!  Doktor pakar diberi layanan kelas kedua kenaikan pangkat Saudara Pengarang, KENYATAAN Menteri Kesihatan di Parlimen pada 7 Julai 2004 yang disiarkan oleh akhbar Utusan Malaysia adalah dirujuk. Beliau mendakwa sehingga 31 Mei 2004, masih terdapat 875 jawatan pegawai perubatan pakar pelbagai bidang yang belum diisi daripada sejumlah 2,397 jawatan pegawai perubatan pakar di Kementerian Kesihatan Malaysia.   Di sini, saya dengan sebulat suara menyokong kenyataan beliau dan ia amat berpatutan dengan iklan yang dikeluarkan oleh Kementerian Kesihatan yang disiarkan di laman web kementerian (untuk sesiapa yang berminat membacanya, www.moh.gov.my).   Namun begitu, janganlah rakyat Malaysia terkejut, jika semakin ramai pegawai perubatan pakar yang akan meletakkan jawatan mereka disebabkan iklan ini.  Untuk pengetahuan semua, gelaran doktor perubatan adalah bersamaan dengan pegawai perubatan di dalam skim perkhidmatan kerajaan.  Untuk pengetahuan pembaca, sebelum Skim SSM (Sistem Saraan Malaysia) diperkenalkan, kenaikan pangkat untuk jawatan pegawai perubatan pakar di dalam Skim SSB (Sistem Saraan Baru) adalah dari gred U3 ke gred U2. Gaji untuk pegawai perubatan pakar klinikal gred U3 untuk skim SSB adalah di dalam lingkungan RM5,012.81 (iaitu selepas mendapat hadiah dua kenaikan gaji dan bayaran insentif pakar apabila seseorang pegawai perubatan lulus ijazah sarjana kepakaran dan diwartakan sebagai pakar).   Apabila dinaikkan pangkat ke gred U2 di dalam SSB, seorang pegawai perubatan pakar gred U2 akan menerima imbuhan gaji di dalam lingkungan RM6,988.51. Kenaikan pangkat ke gred U2 ini akan dinikmati oleh pegawai perubatan pakar tersebut setelah dua hingga tiga tahun diwartakan sebagai pakar klinikal di gred U3.   Ini merupakan pertambahan gaji sebanyak RM1,975.70, satu jumlah yang agak berpatutan.   Bagaimanapun kami hanya nikmati setelah terpaksa bertungkus lumus untuk menamatkan pengajian di peringkat sarjana kepakaran yang mengambil masa selama empat hingga lima tahun (tidak termasuk ijazah sarjana muda doktor perubatan, M.D, M.B.B.S, yang telah diambil dalam masa enam hingga tujuh tahun).  Tetapi lain pula halnya di dalam SSM yang diperkenalkan pada penghujung tahun 2002, jawatan kami sebagai pegawai perubatan pakar klinikal gred U41 hanya dinaikkan ke pegawai perubatan pakar gred U44 (sepatutnya jawatan setara yang perlu ditawarkan untuk kenaikan pangkat di dalam SSM untuk pegawai perubatan pakar adalah pada gred U48 iaitu bersamaan gred U2 untuk skim SSB).   Gaji yang kami nikmati untuk jawatan pegawai perubatan pakar klinikal gred U41 adalah di dalam lingkungan RM5,177.81 dan apabila kami dinaikkan pangkat ke gred U44 (selepas diwartakan dan semestinya perlu lulus peperiksaan Penilaian Tahap Kecekapan, SSM), gaji baru yang akan kami nikmati hanyalah RM5,631.23. iaitu kenaikan sebanyak RM453.42.   Bayangkanlah pertambahan gaji sebanyak itu yang kami akan dapat di dalam Skim SSM setelah bertungkus lumus belajar untuk mendapatkan ijazah kepakaran.   Untuk pengetahuan pembaca, gaji pegawai perubatan pakar gred U48 skim SSM adalah bermula daripada RM7,303.51. Suatu perbezaan yang amat ketara di dalam skim SSM yang diperkenalkan berbanding skim SSB.  Pada pendapat saya, jika seseorang hanyalah pegawai perubatan gred U41 yang tidak mempunyai ijazah kepakaran dan dinaikkan ke gred U44, itu merupakan satu rezeki. Tetapi yang saya tidak faham, kenapalah kenaikan pangkat ke gred U44 ini diperkenalkan kepada pegawai perubatan yang mempunyai kepakaran klinikal.  Kenapa, pihak kementerian tidak mahu memperkenalkan kembali skim kenaikan pangkat ke gred kanan kepada pegawai perubatan, seperti yang diamalkan sewaktu Jawatankuasa Kabinet 1976, yang memberikan kenaikan pangkat kepada semua pegawai perubatan yang telah berkhidmat selama lima tahun.   Gred U43/U44 boleh digunakan sebagai gred kanan. Manakala Gred U47/U48 dan ke atas dijadikan gred kenaikan pangkat untuk pegawai perubatan pakar dan juga kepada pegawai perubatan yang cemerlang dan sebagainya.  Sebagai kesimpulan dari tulisan saya ini,  1. Pihak kementerian sememangnya menggalakkan pegawai perubatan pakar rakyat Malaysia untuk berhijrah, kerana mereka boleh mendapatkan khidmat pegawai perubatan pakar dari luar. Yang menariknya di sini untuk khidmat pakar dari luar, kementerian menawarkan Gred permulaan U48 sehingga ke gred U54 untuk pegawai-pegawai perubatan pakar dari luar ini, yang sesetengahnya tidak diketahui asal-usul ijazah kepakaran mereka ambil. Bukanlah pegawai perubatan pakar ini tidak mahu berkhidmat di hospital-hospital kerajaan, tetapi sebenarnya kami merasakan yang kami ini dianak-tirikan dan diberi layanan kelas kedua oleh Kementerian Kesihatan.  2. Hospital-hospital kerajaan akan sentiasa dianggap sebagai hospital kelas kedua oleh rakyat Malaysia. Ini kerana kebanyakan penghijrahan pakar ini merupakan pakar-pakar muda yang bercita-cita tinggi untuk menjadi seorang pakar khusus/sub-kepakaran.   Dengan itu, hospital kerajaan akan tinggal dengan pakar-pakar perunding yang akan bersara dan tiada kelebihan di bidang sub-kepakaran berbanding pegawai perubatan pakar yang masih muda.   Jikapun mereka ini pergi melanjutkan pengajian di bidang sub-kepakaran, berapa lama sangat yang mereka dapat berkhidmat.   Selepas itu mereka pun bersara dan menyertai pihak swasta dengan sub-kepakaran mereka. Inilah fenomena yang kita alami sekarang ini di mana hospital-hospital swasta disanjung tinggi oleh rakyat, walaupun terpaksa membayar kos rawatan yang begitu tinggi.   Dari manakah datangnya pakar yang berkhidmat di hospital swasta ini, jika bukan daripada penghijrahan dari sektor awam.  3. Untuk adik-adik yang terlalu amat meminati bidang perubatan. Bidang perubatan bukanlah bidang yang `glamour'. Ia memerlukan jiwa yang kental dan masa yang amat-amat panjang untuk mengharungi bidang ini.   Janganlah mengharapkan imbuhan yang luar biasa dari bidang ini (kecualilah jika anda berazam untuk meninggalkan sektor awam selepas tamat belajar). Teruskan niat jika anda mencintai bidang perubatan yang sememangnya memerlukan ketabahan mental dan fizikal. - DOKTOR PAKAR KERAJAAN, Batu Ferringhi, Pulau Pinang.

      Why must the shops in the Uk all close at 5? Oh dear, i still have lots of last minute shopping to do. And tomoro is SUNDAY. shops open at 12! d-uh .....  Even though i dont think i have been very productive today shopping-wise , at least i found me a nice top to wear when i go see golliwog next week. i dont think i will dress up too much this time tho' .. cos golliwog will say i am overdoing it.. knowing him! The top i bought is nice and simple, and by my standards ( which are not very high!) kinda expensive. for the same price i could have bought more than one top. i still have to find a matching pair of trousers to go with it tho. aiyer.. tomoro is gonna be one crazy day .. looking for the trousers and buying souvenirs for everyone!  This morn i spoke to my dad about the exams. I could tell he was kinda disappointed that i couldnt really speak positively about my exams.. but as usual, he didnt show it. His disappointment is often masked by his favourite ,' as long as you tried your best ..', reassuring words. I said to dad, my written paper was so bad .. i wouldnt pass me if i were the examiner. But i did tell him tho' that the osces were good. hahaha... eza seems to think that because i felt i could do my osces, that would make me a good doctor. God, i hope so!

      Post-exam blues. i never realised they existed, until today. Before, i only knew of post-HOLIDAY blues.  yEPS. The fourth year exams are done .. but i think in my case, they are not over with. I have this bad bad feeling that i am gonna have to do the re-sits in November. Especially after the written paper on wednesday. Omigod. THAT was difficult. A whole CRQ question on SPASMODIC TORTICOLLIS. im not exactly complaining about this particular question because i could answer it ( lucky me .. cos i just read about the condition for my own personal interest and not for the exams). But just the fact that dystonias arent supposed to be favourite exam topics. Oh .. we also got a whole CRQ question on GIARDIASIS .. omigod. Traveller's diarrhoea. Giler susah the written exams.. the EMI's were even tougher. One whole page was dedicated to family trees and matching them with the appropriate hereditary conditions. That was AWFUL. i mean sure i know whether the common hereditary conditions such as duchenne's muscular dystrophy is x-linked  recessive etcetera.. but to figure out which family tree best describes the condition. aiyoh.   The OSCE's yesterday .. alhamdulillah was not as bad. It was still hard but i didnt feel as bad as i did when i left the exam hall after the written. As a matter of fact, i think i kinda thought this OSCE was FUN! probably because most of the manned stations were manned by 'nice' doctors. The consultant i had for my portfolio station.. haha.. everyone in my group were hoping that they would not get her.. including yours truly. But she turned out to be quite nice and did not give me such a hard time for that station. Im glad i chose to type out the front sheets for my case write-ups, instead of doing them by hand ;first impressions count. Surprisingly some of the examiners were rather 'relaxed' .. during the ALS STATION which i finish way before the 4 mins, the examiner asked me where i was heading for my electives .. and whether i have brothers or sisters blabalbala... i remember this question cos as i was making use of the extra time to answer the rest of the empty boxes in my answer book, i managed to tell him that i had a brother doing first year medicine in edinburgh. In the fundoscopy station.. hahahah.. i missed out the letter next to the optic disc in the dummy's eye.. but the nice examiner asked me .. dont u see a letter? i probably didnt notice it cos i was too busy trying to decribe the disc. I said i did .. and then he asked me to look for another letter.. in the macular area. Afterall that, he asked me whether i was going back to KL!!!!! ( actually the moment i entered the room, he asked me, ' are you MALAYSIAN?')  I promptly replied.. 'sarawak!'.. well if he knows KL, he should know SARAWAK !!!!!!!   arrghhh .. EXAMS EXAMS. because the first run had started late , the second run ( i was in the second run) started like half an hour late. omigod.. the delay was pure torment. I remember feeling really really sick and nauseated as we waited outside Clinical Skills. And, i thought to myself.. God, i dont want to go through all this again. Pure torture. But i guess thats just the effect of the adrenaline rush ... cos after the OSCE's, i thought, hey that was fun! But boy .. was i drained!!!!!!! bY the way, i would like to acknowlege my utmost appreciation to my dear fren zak who went thru the CVS exam ( plus all the other exams ) the night before the osce;s. Thank god we revised the full CVS exams including all those manouvres for murmurs. And thank goodness u reminded me to use the bell of the stethoscope as well. There is definitely a mark for THAT cos i saw Dr Pringle mark on his sheet when i did it.   okies. re-sits or no re-sits i still have to go home. have to do the electives. strangely, for the first time in my 4 years here, i am not all that excited about going home. probably cos i know i did terribly badly ( redundancy intented) in the exams ...   oh well.. im gonna be seeing my dear golliwog next week. *sigh* i really feel i dont deserve this holiday at all ....

      Its two days away from the finals, three away from the osce's. im in a state of partial panic cos i cant seem to find my stethoscope. I dont trust any stethoscope other than the Littmann made ones.. and if i cant find mine by wednesday, i guess id just have to ask my senior (doctor) friends if i could have a loan of their's for two hours on thursday morning.  This morning i practiced ALS and other osce stuff again with dheeba and zakiah. DHEEBA. it has been a while since i last met and talked to her. We used to be flatmates in the villas,and could spend hours just talking. I must say this morn's session was rather fun actually. i am not saying i am more competent at my examination techniques, but now i think after a whole year of clinical experience, i have slightly more confidence than i did the last two years. Confidence is important when you are doing medicine. If you as a clinician is not confident of yourself, how could u expect the patient under your care to feel confident of you?   Hahaha.. i was also told today of one person in our class.. one person whom i used to think of being quite keen and clever. Apparently, that person , asked the consultant ( most likely the urologist) during their teaching sessions ... , 'So.. prostate cancer IS more common in men than in women?'. err.. hello. I know i am not particularly bright myself ( having been caught by my GP tutor of not knowing the anatomical position of the human appendix .. hehe i was put on the spot!)but d-uh.. PROSTATE CANCER IN THE FEMALE SPECIES. now THAT'S  a scary thought !!!!!! hehehehe   eheheh... my blog entry today will not be complete if i didnt talk about golliwog. my dear sweet old golliwog. we talked for over 2 hours last night ..him keeping me updated on the progress of the euro finals at the same time. I realise that , yes i am stupid .. having gone thru' such a traumatic relationship the last .. yet i am willing to risk another heart ache with this one. But as i pointed it out to him last nite. This is different. Hahaha.. probably becos i am his best friend rather than his girlfriend makes it easier for him to tell me things that he probably wouldnt tell me if i were his gf anyways. I told him last nite that i am ever thankful for his presence because this year has been , undeniably , one of the more happier ones of my four years in DUNDEE. Fate is funny. My relationship with golliwog is one which i think is the funniest ( funny strange not funny ha-ha) act of fate ever. Which initially made me think we were MEANT to be together .. but obviously not. But again, theres a reason for everything ... and there is a reason why our relationship will never be perpetuated.   argh, that sounded so damn soppy. oklah.   FOURTH YEAR EXAMS .. HERE I COME !!!!!!!!!

      Thanks atol for letting me see the pics of didi's engagement day and pics of ur tiny gathering in KL. goodness gracious me.. u shouldve seen my reaction when i saw atik's pic with the caption ' atik glowing with her pregnancy'.. and after that , 'mus with her adorable baby'. WHOAAAAA.... i knew atik is pregs and i knew mus had given birth but it wasnt until i saw those pictures that the reality of it all actually sunk in. and didi's engagement pics.. awww... she looks SOOOOOO AYU AND PRETTY ...my dear friend didi.  seeing all those pics i cant help but wish i were there.. meeting up with u guys, being with didi on her special day. goodness me...my friends are all grown up.. either engaged or married. typical because we are all at THAT age. 24. my mom had me when she was 23. I AM OLDER THAN MY MOM THAN WHEN SHE HAD HER FIRST BABY.  not that im bothered about it. there is no hard and fixed rule that says, you must get ur life sorted out, married and have ur first child by the time u are 25. so no im NOT bothered by the fact that i am not as 'laju' as some of my peers as far as such milestones are concerned.  Gawd i HATE EXAMS. d-uh who does? hahaha.. probably zak's most favourite person K.H. does. when i was in lodge, one of the boys 2 years above me won an essay competition about how exams should be abolished. exams, he wrote, stands for E-EXASPERATING, X-XENOPHOBIC, A-ATROCIOUS, M-MADDENING, S-STUPID. he mustve been in Primary 6 or something when he wrote that .. and d-uh that was the FIRST and only time ive ever seen the word XENOPHOBIC being used. how he ever came up with that word during the essay competition is beyond me.  NOW I HAVE TO LEARN MY ANTIBIOTICS.yes.. LEARN .. not TAKE.

      yes. i am in exam mode. supposedly.i have more fingers than there are days left till the dreaded finals. now that's saying something, innit?   i talked for over an hour with golliwog last night. yesterday i was in such a good mood, i should've saved some ( of that good mood) for today. yesterday i loved my flat.. today it felt like a prison. hahaha.. which explains why i am here now.. cos i needed FRESH AIR. god.. how could i kid myself and think i could stay indoors 24 hrs just to finish my revision? No. The brain needs fresh air. God, i was doing neurology today.. and by 6pm the words just seemed as though they were swimming across the pages .. nothing could be forced into this cluttered brain of mine no matter how hard i tried. I contemplated leaving the flat and getting some fresh air, initially decided against it, but then i felt soo miserable that i thought, even if i stayed indoors, it wont do me any good. I didnt even want to watch TV. Plus i needed FOOD. Planning to get me a nice takeaway after this. hmm.. maybe its time for that beef burger ive been craving for ....  God, i miss the study environment back home. and i mean home home. As in our family home in Kuching. We have a patio overlooking a spacious green compound, where dad would put , during my spm days , a table for me to do my studying in the late afternoons. yes, it was occasionally very hot, but that was good for me .. cos studying indoors ( like now) tends to me feel sleepy. arrghh... wish i was home..Plenty of fresh air. Good food. Mom and dad to watch over me ( hehehe.. i am such a big fat baby .. golliwog always says i act like im 14 instead of 24).  golliowog. mm.. miss him too. Can't believe im meeting him again soon. hahahha.. i have now got the same brand of soap i used when i first met him ( which i havent used since) and now its got that pavlov effect on me. haha..
