      I can't believe how hung over I feel today. Yet, not an ounce of booze has touched these lips. I think that it was the coming off of travel and the lack of sleep. It almost makes me giggle, that this same feeling of apathy, stomach turning and headache can be caused by something other than beer. It's also an emotional hang over of sorts. I suppose it is the factor that I was just feeling so much yesterday...But I did not want to feel...At least not on the inside. I miss sensory feeling. I think that I have closed myself off so much from the world that I have protected myself both emotionaly and physicaly. I think that the phyiscal ramifications come first...it's much easier to lie to your head than to your physical self. I truly don't really know what I'm talking about. But, it seemed to make sense at the moment.

      I'm just tired of being in this constant state of flux. Nothing is ever enough and nothing is ever right. I want it all and I want it to be better than the last time. I don't really know why I am doing this, but, I suppose I just need to start opening up my life. I need to be ready for the next step, no matter what that is.  I feel so trite.  How did happiness and  enough  ever become a bad thing? When did I become conditioned to want and feel that want become "need"? Again, it almost hurts that I'm so transparent. Yet, I say nothing. Ironic. I guess that transparent is the wrong word...More like childish, silly and empty. Nothing new to say, nothing new to share, just raw.

      sensory never whole Next to me, in me warm body, warm bottle … Do I get to feel?  smoky intangibility questions more than answers – the trite mantra of my life. illusions perpetuated by those around me willingly I go able to walk convinced of my path mind games to obvious to entertain – laughable, usual stale.  not ready to dream yet. not hard dreams. Dream hard, dream fast, dream loud.  heart in my throat ready, i need to cough. excuse me. almost there. Getting there…almost there gone  feel fucking emotion shit. Physical i need to be on fire  Unmasking, Peeling, crazy, fear, need vacant
