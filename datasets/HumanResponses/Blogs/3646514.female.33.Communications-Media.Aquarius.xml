      Well I've been on this India Hindu kick for quite sometime and I am currently reading a book call Autobiography of a Yogi, by Yogananda, and absolutely fantastic book esp if you want to get a grasp on old India.    It's been a while since I've been able to do yoga, any kinda of yoga to be exact because of my hip/left leg issue.  There is one yoga I've been meaning to try, it's a restorative yoga.  I really need to get my buns to this class so I can heal my body, anyways, enough about me.    In chapter 26 of the Autobiography of a Yogi they discuss The Science of Kriya Yoga.    Anyways this requires a quote...   "The science of  Kriya Yoga , mentioned so often in these pages, became widely known in modern India through the instrumentality of Lahiri Mahasaya, my guru's guru."   He's refering to Sri Yuketswar, a true true holyman besides Yogananda himself.     "The Sanskrit root of  kriya is kri, to do, to act and react; the same root is found in the word karma, the natural principle of cause and effect.    Kriya yoga is thus "union (yoga) with the Infinite through a certain action or rite (kriya.)   A yogi who faithfully practices the technique is gradually freed from karma or the lawful chain of cause-effect equilibriums."   Now he goes onto say that this technique should be taught by an authorized Kriyaban (Kriya Yogi) of Self-Realization Fellowship (Yogoda Satsanga Society of India.)  Of course, unless you are from India, how many of those folks do you know is walking around in America?    Okay, onto the the quotin...   "Kriya Yoga is a simple, psychophysiological method by which human blood is decarbonated and recharged with oxygen."   Now I suppose this is done through pranayama, a variation of yogic breathing techniques.     "The Atoms of this extra oxygen are transmuted into life current to rejuvenate the brain and the spinal centers."   Spinal centers must be referring to the chakras.     "By stopping the accumulation of venous blood, the yogi is able to lesson or prevent the decay of tissues."   It's a good thing to breathe and not just breathe I mean pranayama.     "Offering the inhaling breath into the exhaling breath and offering the exhaling breath into the inhaling breath, the yogi neutralizes both breaths; thus he releases prana from the heart and brings life force under his control.  *This is from the Bhagavad Gita IV:29."   I will go deeper into the pranayama and prana later.    This next part is good to pay attention to.   “That meditation-expert (muni) becomes eternally free who, seeking the Supreme Goal, is able to withdraw from external phenomena by fixing his gaze within the mid-spot of the eyebrows and by neutralizing the even currents of prana and apana (that flow) within the nostrils and lungs; and to control his sensory mind and intellect; and to banish desire, fear, and anger.”   I got to tell you, those three things are our detriments, they are detrimental to society.  If you don’t believe me just take a look at society, keep a notepad or what ever and write it all down what you see in relations to those 3 things.     "The  Kriya Yogi  mentally directs his life energy to revolve, upward and downard, around the six spinal centers (medullar, cervical, dorsal, lumbar, sacral and cocygeal plescuses), which correspond to the twelve astral signs of the zodiac, the symbolic Cosmic Man.  One-half minute of revolution of energy around the sensitive spinal cord of man effects subtle progresses in his evolution; that half-minute of Kriya equals one year of natural spiritual unfoldment."     Once again, the charkas…  I’ll add more later, there will be a part II to Kriya Yoga..  Quote of the day. ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~     "J. Krishnamurti asks the question, I wonder if we can truly listen to someone?  To do so without imposing our own beliefs, convictions or classifications upon their words, but rather to really listen with a clear mind."      ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~  Namaskar, ~Tina-ji

      So, I am basically just downloading a shitload of music from Japan, Heavy Metal Japanese bands, I gotta tell ya there's some good stuff.  But as I listen to it, I am slowly beginning to realize, I'm getting old.  I just don't have it in me to listen to this, however I was listening to X Japan, they are pretty good.    I am more into Yoko Kanno's big band stuff with the Seatbelts.  I guess I am growing old.  It's all good, age is good, except it's harder now for me to lose weight and I have to walk everyday other wise my legs feel numb.  hahahhaha, few grey hair and a lack of tolerance for the dumb shit.  But, it's all good, it's not going to stop being good...  Not one bit.    Anyways, I just wanted to enter a blog, because well, this is basically just my own journal.  A journal for myself and this is the best way for me to keep myself organized or even remember yesterday.  Although I am only 33, it's like I have no short term or long term memory, and I haven't even done any drugs in a long time.  Go figure, and it's not like I've done many anyways.  hahahhaha...  Anyways, today is a good day, tomorrow will be good too.    Okay, a quote for today....  ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~    "If enlightenment is not where you are  standing, where will you look?"                     - Zen Saying   ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~   Namaskar ~Tina-ji

      Peeeeeeeeeeeeeuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu!!!!  And he thought his shit didn't stink.    Isn't it amazing that we live in a world where people think they can treat others like assholes.  Or even treat others cruelly, that something about these people gives you a license to treat them poorly.    It's like this, my boss at work gives people who are of a dweebie stature special attention or special privileges.   "Oh they were treated poorly, everyone picked on them in class."     Well who the heck wasn't treated poorly?  Who wasn't teased?  I remember being teased!!!  I remember that not only did I get punished at home, but I got punished at school too.  But, since I look different now, I must of been one of the popular kids.  I wasn't popular, everyone thought I was a satanist because I wore black all the time and carrying that Anton LeVey book around school didn't help much either but lol, hey I was an angry kid back then.    But, that's besides the point...  There was an intern here who was mentally challenged, where one of the special people, we'll call him Mr. Shidonostank, who has picked on Andys continously.  I just found this out, recently when Andys told me this.  Needless to say, I was angry but tried to comfort Andys by saying.   Andys, you got to learn that there are alot of people who have no sense of awareness of their actions.  They had you in L.D. class, there are alot of people like Mr. Shidonostank, who have L.D. lives.  You just don't treat people like that.  So, don't take it upon yourself by this man's (lack of a better term) actions.     I'm like thinking, Mr. Shidonostank was one of those people who got picked on severely, not just in high school or elementary but this man was picked on at O.C.B. a college here in Cincinnati.  Everyone wondered how many dead bodies Mr. Shidonostank had in his basement.  He always walked up to the girls and stood right there with his front pants  a foot away from your face.  I know this because he did it to me a few times until I nearly elbowed his wee wee. Bastard!    Anyways, Mr. Shidonostank took the priviledge to insult and hurt Andies feelings.  Ok, let me ask you a few questions.  So, is it just me, but perhaps some people should be treated crappy?  Mr. Shidonostank being the first example of someone who deserves to get his ass beat because he's soooooooooooo freakin stupid he doesn't even remember how it hurts to be insulted or bullied.  I would say the majority of kids don't deserve it, but if these kids turn around and become the very thing that treated them badly, then they deserve what they got.    It's just like the pedaphile, you can't tell me that those kids weren't hurt, and then they turned around and become the very thing that hurt them.  Where is the justification in this?  Why would you want to become the ugliness that made you hurt?  I'm sorry, but talk about weakness, that is weakness at its best.  You becoming the very thing you hate.    Hmm..  Perhaps if I hate millionares I will become one.  LOL, wishful thinking there.    I don't want to make up excuses to be mean to someone.  It's like these Islamic that hate Americans and find ways to justify killing U.S. citizens.  "Well they pay taxes don't they?"  Ahhhh, excuse me?  Do I have a choice in the matter?  They take those taxes right out of my paycheck boys and girls of Islam.  They forced my parents to give me a number, (that being the social security number) otherwise they wouldn't of been able to put me on their insurance.  You have to have a social security number for everything you do here in america.  You want a job, you need a social, you want to go to the doctors you need insurance, you need a insurance you need a social.  There is no getting away from it.  I don't give them my money, they take 30% right out of my check.  No permission required from me, they just take it!  I don't hand it to them.  I don't have a choice in the matter.  I have to have a job, I have to have insurance, I have to have these things in order for me and my family to survive otherwise I would of been dead years ago with the illness I had.  So fuck you and your assumptions. Survival of the fittest.  This is how I survive.  No different then you who join up with Bin Laden's group so you and your family can eat and allow yourselves to be duped believing, we are such a horrible people.  But, hey, you got to eat don't ya?  I ain't mad at ya.  But let's get somethings straight, we aren't the only ones killing innocent people here, you are too!  So, get used to it, you too are in the rich man's game, there is no escaping it.  We are all pawns.  So, either get with the program or start organizing a "everyone stop what they are doing and get along and stop being a pawn for the rich" rally!    There is no justiciation in hate or murder.  There is only decreases in the world's population, killing off the poor and the hungry by using hate.  That's what they want us to do, just go away, so they don't have to look at the suffering.   Anyways, all I can say about all of this is...    You all must be so proud the day you got your license to hurt people.      Okay, here is my quote of the day....  ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~     Each moment is fragile and fleeting.  The moment of the past cannot be kept, however beautiful.  The moment of the present cannot be held, however enjoyable.  The moment of the future cannot be caught, however desirable.  But the mind is desperate to fix the river in place:  Possessed by ideas of the past, preoccupied with images of the future,  it overlooks the plain truth of this moment.  The one who can dissolve her mind will suddenly  discover the Tao at her feet, and clarity at hand.   ~ Hua Hu Ching ~    ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~  Namaskar, Tina-ji

      Well, I'm new here but this is my blog so I'm going to write whatever comes to mind.  It was a long weekend, I had to work the Newport Italian Festival, what I did was basically help the company I work for videotape the festival.  Usually I do graphic animation but since my department is so short staffed we basically do everything.  EVERYTHING!!!  So, I collected 10 hours of overtime this weekend listening to that Godfather tune over and over and over again.  And watch some guy who wants to be Elvis shake his fanny.  I suppose we had to do it, or we would of swimmed with the fishies.    Anyways, Sunday afternoon, my husband I took a break and went over the purple people eater bridge and there were these guys from Orchard Street Baptist passing out these lil booklets.  One of them entitled The Death Cookie.  It's really hilarious, unless you are my husband who happens to be Catholic, I myself am a combination of a Hindu/Buddhist Pagan, so YOU KNOWS I'S GOING TO HELL!    But, I say to Fazzjack, that's what we'll call my hubby.   "Hey, they are making fun of your religion"  and then he says to me, " See Sweetcheeks, your beliefs aren't the only beliefs that are attacked."    So true, Honey, So true.  So.....  They basically say that the Catholic religion derived from these Egyptians who worshiped Osiris who had these lil wafers, which the Catholic today call the Body of Christ.  Mmmm... Taste like chicken.  The Holy Work began with the help of the Holy Papa and his Holy Helpers, molesting the people and their minds.  Keeping them from reading the Bible so they all remained ignorant to the casting of spells, "Hocus Pocus Domi Nocus."    Oh brother, yes every man and his mother has a plot to keep the man down.  No one on the face of the earth is trying to make sense of it all, trying to keep people from killing and hurting each other.  We all have a plot for your souls!!!!!  Or is that your Sole's!!!  I need some new shoes anyways.    Yes, I agree there are some bad stuff, that people suffer from the case of the "Get-Offs."  Heck I think that's most people sole reason for living is; to get off.  Get off on drinking, Get off on sex, Get off on other people's misery, etc... etc...  But, I don't think everyone in the world is a tool for the debil.    Anyways, The Death Cookie!  Mmmmm...  Death Cookie....  See Children,...   We'll change the death Cookie, we call this transubstantiation, Now you can Eat Your God!!!!    HAHHAHAHHAHAHAHA, Eat me!!!!!!!!!!!!   Thank you Holy Papa!    Anyways, it's a nice lil story, and the best part at the end they put.  What happened to Christ's teachings of "Love Thy Neighbor?"  (Luke 6:27)  I dunno, maybe if you folks would stop with the paranoia and get to know us and realize each one of us have to sit on our ass to take a shit, you might realize we are all the same.  That we are all just trying to make it, we are all trying to survive, we're all trying to do good, most people for themselves, but hey, positive energy right?    I love the next booklet, it's called, "Hi There", where it blasts on everyone saying all other religions are going to hell except for the Baptists.  LOL, can you say, Christian KKK anyone????    Anyways, I will end all my posts with a quote, because well, it's my blog isn't it?  Tee hee.    ~ ~ ~  ~ ~ ~  ~ ~ ~  ~ ~ ~  ~ ~ ~  ~ ~ ~  ~ ~ ~  ~ ~ ~  ~ ~ ~  ~ ~ ~  ~ ~ ~  ~ ~ ~     Fear tells you, "I want to make you safe." Love says, "You are safe." Fear would walk you on a narrow path. Love says, "Open your arms and fly with me."     - Emmanuel    Namaskar, Tina-ji

      Well, I'm up early this morning and decided to get a lil meditation in.  I was watching my mind actually while practicing Ujjayi breathing.  Of course, I sat on a small pillow so my hips are higher than my legs, and took in a full lung breath while meditating on the word, "Om."    Well, the things that popped up in my mind were interesting and I got to work on this, I hold grudges at times and that's just plain not healthy.    But, there is this guy I bumped onto on the net, we'll call him "EgoMan."  Well, EgoMan is a very brilliant man indeed but he too has a common issue that he needs to work on and that's his grudges besides his ego.  I mean really this guy's ego is amazing.    But, what amazes me is this, here is a man who has all the knowledge in the palm of his hand, yet he has this powerful ego, (which he knows about, or at least read about).   He continiously is the grudgeful type, couldn't forgive a person in the world (the funny thing is, he thinks he's Jesus; sorry dude Jesus was a man of forgiveness.)  And the worst part he is on my mind because I ran into him on that site.  I have no interest in joining in the site, I guess its because he offended me sexually and he tried to make me out to be the bad guy, him and his lil girlfriend, we'll call her Black Eyed Dog, because she is like the Grim Reaper always on the heals of your shoes and EgoMan to which he is no longer friends with.    So, he rolled in my mind while meditating, check that, mind watching.   Oh, and I can't forget I was thinking of saying to him, you know a enlighten man is a forgiving man, that man would hold no grudges.    Even I forgave him for what he did, I realize sexual frustration makes you crazy, but there are ways you can calm these creative energies.    Okay, so what else rolled in my head, something to do with my ego, I can't remember.   Oh, yeah there is this meditation group, get this, I was trying to meditate and I thought about a meditation group that I want to join.  I just got to go there.    Anyways, this is something I need to kick back into my life, I don't think my stress level would of been so high while planning my marriage if I disciplined myself into meditating.  Shame on me!!!  Stress is not a good thing for AB Blood types.    Anyways, I'll probably be back if I remember what I was thinking about....  But here's a quote for today....  ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~   The soft overcomes the hard in the world as a gentle rider controls a galloping horse. That without substance can penetrate where there is no space. By these I know the benefit of nonaction [wu wei]. Teaching without words, working without actions-- nothing in the world can compare to them.

      Well didn't have time to blog this weekend, just pretty much busy, between Mike's friend getting married Saturday, then Sunday worked 5 hours over time and the Mainstrasse's Original Goettafest, and printing out thank you cards after the wedding, I had a busy weekend let's just say that.    Goettafest was cool, the first band we taped...  UUuuhhhh, can't remember their name, they were actually cool, they reminded me of some of the bands I taped back in 1992 for Local Band Jam.  That was a fun show.  The second band we taped, well, they were painful.  Oh well....  But, for those of you who are being pokey on my blog here, you may be asking, what's goetta.  Well Goetta is a Cincinnati thingie, it's a combination between German breakfast sausage (and some other meats) and steel cut oats.  It's actually pretty damn good.  For more info on Goetta go to the following  urlLink link.   I like it, with ketchup.  Mmm..  Of course, I like everything with ketchup.    Got alot going on today, one of the guys, we'll call him, "One-Who-Bitches-Often" was sick today so I have to run audio.  huzzah, :(  I guess it could be worse, I could be running audio for "One-Who-Bitches-Often"   Now the quote for today....  ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~     There is a being, wonderful, perfect; It existed before heaven and earth. How quiet it is! How spiritual it is! It stands alone and it does not change. It moves around and around, but does not on this account suffer. All life comes from it. It wraps everything with its love as in a garment,  and yet it claims no honor, it does not demand to be Lord. I do not know its name, and so I call it Tao,  and I rejoice in its power.  ~Tao Te Ching 25, quoted in Huston Smith's The World's Religions    ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~   Namaskar, Tina-ji

      Wow, it's been a few days since I blogged, there have been days I wanted to post something but I either get busy or am not sure what to write, so I leave it alone.    Anyways, I'm reading this great book by Lillian Glass, PH.D. called  Toxic People, 10 ways of dealing with people who make your life miserable."   And if you work with the Energy Sucking Manipulative Vampires from the depths of Hades, you too need a book like this.  hahahhaha....  It teaches you about toxic people, the variety types of toxic people, how to deal with these toxic people and if you too are being toxic, plus the 10 ways.  Actually it's really interesting and not filled with a variety of semantics too hard to comprehend that you have to check a dictionary every five minutes.  So, she keeps it simple.    It goes over a bit of your past and how people in your past can condition you into tolerating those toxic behaviors which eventually give you stomach cancer and heart disease.  I sincerely believe the latter because ever since I had to shift departments and work with the E.S.M.Vs I've developed a plethora of health problems and I'm trying to conquer them with the help of meditation and improving my eating habits and letting go and going off when needed.  Sometimes you need to be upfront, but sometimes you can't come up with the right words at the right time so you hold it in.  Thinking, damn I wish of would of thought of that at that moment.  Man, I hate that.  The book discusses that, I just got to get some practice in.  Problem with the practice is, I've gotten to the point where I keep my office door closed and I have a working on project, do not disturb sign on.  hahahahaha...  And it's proving effective.    I'm trying to figure out what type of toxic person I am... Personally I think I'm an "aloof, passive aggressive type, that holds it in, and when I reach the boiling point I explode then all hell breaks loose" type of toxic person.   I just wish I didn't have any attachments to the things people say, and I think I do to a point and I realize alot of it has to do with my ego.  Oh well, I'm far from an evil person and most people who get to know me love me, so I must be doing something right.    Except, I do have this stress headache and my stomach hurts at times, my fear of an ulcer, I just need to get back into the yoga, after I do that, everything will be well after that.    Anyways, the quote of the day....  ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~        This then is life.     Here is what has come to the surface after so many throes and convulsions.     How Curious!  How real!     Underfoot the divine soil, overhead the sun.             - Walt Whitman    ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~   Namaskar, ~Tina-ji

      I know I've been such a slacker with this blog, but since I'm assured no one else is reading this, I can only blame myself. hahahahaha.    Well it's been an interesting 2 weeks, I've had the headache of the life time and I know it's from looking at these computer screens for up to 14 hours a day.  I kid you not, I do this at work, I do this at home, and I do this at school.    Anyways, I'm tired and I made a decision.  I figure after I get a house, which I need a sizable amount of a down payment, I am going to be a housewife for a bit.  I know I'll get bored, so I am hoping to start a small business on the side, doing graphic animations for companies who need it or even commercial production for small businesses; money upfront from the businesses of course.   It's just a matter of having the equipment and some advertising.  I'm sorta half way there with my Mac G4 so we'll see.    I guess part of the reason I feel this way is because of work.  I'm really burnt out here at my job.  We are the typical same ol sad song, under payed, under staffed and over worked.  Which I don't mind with the overtime because that's just this closer to a down payment to a house.   But the promblem I have is mostly with these lazy asses.   I'm doing this promotions tape for our department so our ad sales department can use it as a demo for potential clients and getting these guys who produce these shows to get me footage is literally like pulling teeth here.    I've been asking the same guy, we'll call him Lazy D, for two weeks to get me this footage for his show.  He's like cussing me out, so I say to him, listen, I'm going to talk to our super, (we'll call him "One Who Produces Crap") and tell him, I've been asking you for this footage for the past two weeks and I'm getting slack about it! WTF!  So, what does he do, after giving me this look like he's going to kill me.  Within 10 minutes he gets me the video I need.  It didn't take a long at all!  So, what's the freaking problem.  The guy does nothing all day, hence the nick name Lazy D!    Okay, it's like this.  Lazy D is the laziest mother fucker in the department, I and a few other people really work our asses off in this department just to make the shows at least look good.  He does nothing but research all day for a half hour show.  And another guy, we'll call him the Bearster, he does the same thing for an early morning show that takes him like a half an hour not a whole freakin day.   It's like this, I don't want to be doing this extra work either, I got a huge ass list of things on my list of things to do.  I work for 2 departments, marketing and ICN6, doing 30 second promotions for them, and some of these promotions take 3 days to a week to do.  I don't want to do this either, so I don't need any slack.  I don't want to be a bitch neither but if I am put in the position to do so, SO BE IT!    Okay, I'm done with my little rant...  No grousing from me for the rest of the day, besides it's quiting time.  Um, a quote...  Let's see......  Here's one a good friend wrote on another site...  ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~     People imagine that letting themselves go would have disastrous results; trusting neither circumstances nor themselves, which together make up life, they are forever interfering and trying to make their own souls and the world conform with preconceived patterns. This interference is simply the attempt of the ego to dominate life. But when you see that all such attempts are fruitless and when you relax the fear-born resistance to life in yourself and around you which is called egoism, you realize the freedom of union with Brahman. In fact you have always had this freedom, for the state of union with Brahman can neither be attained nor lost; all men and all things have it, in spite of themselves. It can only be realized, which is to say made real to you, by letting life live you for a while instead of trying to make yourself live life. You will soon reach the point where you will be unable to tell whether your thoughts and feelings are your own or whether life put them into you, for the distinction between yourself and life will have disappeared. If the truth be known, there never was any distinction, save in our imaginations. This is called union with Brahman, for "he that loseth his life shall find it."   ~Alan Watts, in an essay called That Far-off Divine Event,  from the book Become What You Are    ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~   Gotta love that Alan Watts guy.  He's my hero! Namaskar, Tina-ji

      I had a fantastic time last weekend canoeing.  It was nice to just get away and be in the water.  I felt good, my headache went away briefly.  Something about nature that is so right.    It was nice to share that experience with my husband.  Then later that evening, the band members got together and jammed.  That was fun, that was cool everyone got wasted and just enjoyed life, friends and food.    The best part for me was the canoeing.  I'm really into silence and nature lately.  I don't want music, I don't want noise, commercialism.  Just the sound of the tree leaves whistling in the wind.  Those are the things I can appreciate, those are the things that keeps me alive and happy.    I'm ready to go canoeing again!    Here's good quote from the Raymond-san that resembles my weekend. ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~     Cloudy mountains, fold on fold,  How many thousands of them?  Shady valley road runs deep,  All traces of people gone  Green torrents, pure clear flow,  No place more full of beauty;  Birds sing my own heart’s harmony.   - Shih-Te    ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~   Namaskar, Tina-ji
