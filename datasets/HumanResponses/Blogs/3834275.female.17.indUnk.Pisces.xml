      So MANY things happenned in the last few weeks.      1. kai and me broke up  2. i went out with vincent  3. vincent is soo into the relationship  4. kai asked me back  5. i rejected him  6. he was depressed and told the whole world abt what a slutty bitch i am for dumping him.   7. the whole world was disgusted with me. but that's okay.. they are brainless creatures who loves to poke at others' business.  8. they judged me even though they knew nothing about me and especially what kind of jerk kai is.(kai is not a jerk.. he is a bastard.. an asshole)  9. kai went out with stephanie (his ex) for a few times.   10. i talked to steph  11. told him abt the fact that kai dated other girls when he was with steph. told her abt the fact that he lied to her to many times to count.  12. i wasnt sure abt her reaction, but she certainly had dimissed the idea of patching things up with kai.   13. unless she is a brainless, super moron plus idiot girl, then its a different story.   14. i stop going to pub, comp lab, lib, or anywhere else.. i go back home once i finished my bio class.   15. kai "scolded" me or rather criticized me for withdrawing from my social circle. (i thought he said that i dun have friends. i thought he said nobody likes me. i thought he said my social life doesnt exist. so what am i withdrawing from? he said im losing my friends. well, you cannot lose things that you never have, can you?)   16. the point above is a solid proof of what a snake kai is. i mean.. have he forgotten that he is the one destroying my reputation in front of my "friends" by telling them private stuffs such as i am annoying and over-protective. well, everygirl will turn paranoid once they find out that her bf is a flirtious bastard right?  17. once night, kai just came up to me to say that he went out with friends and found out that none of them missed me. i mean, jerk, what are you trying to say here. out of the blue.   18. i've been going out with vincent ..almost everyday. coz i cant stand looking at kai face without having the urge to stranggle him right there and then.   19. i've been going out with friends from downtown college. i dun care abt my shoreline friends anymore. they are nothing but losers who talk behind people's backs.   20. esp YUAN &amp; SEKAR. feel like tearing their mouths apart. i mean, seriously, i never talked to them much. we are just a HI-and BYE friend .. nothing more than that. but they have the courage to talk things behind me as if they know me.   21. so, now, as far as i know, me and kai have completely parted. im moving out soon. he is after steph, i think. and i hope they get together. they make a perfect match( a slutty bitch, who goes out with others' bfs and a jerky bastard, who cant stop dating girls even when he is in a relationship... truly complementary, may they live happily ever after)  22. he just came up to my room and sleep on my bed. coz he said his bed is full of laundry.   23. i shove him off.   24. he finally went off the room, muttering things in chinese. he is downstairs now. still muttering things in chinese. i really think something is wrong with his mind.   25. oh yah, he said my world is empty and im trying to fill it up. none of his business . he is just jealous becoz i got someone with an e-class mercedes to drive me around town while he has to take bus or ask his friend with a manual car to drive him around. -_- poor jealous man.  26. he stinks btw. he always does.. dunno how i survive that smell for 3 months.

      I am listening to this old instrumental song by palchelbel,"canon in d". I used to listen to this song everyday when i was in Singapore. This song was my companion when im ecstatic,  sad, dissapointed, depressed... a lot of memory..so when i listen to it   again, the memory just somehow come back to me..  when i woke up that morning to go to school, i was so happy coz i know i was going to meet endi, then after school-shopping with yanti, eating, then coming back .. had dinner, watched tv and then went to bed.. what a paradise.  on saturdays, woke up very late, then answered misscalls in my hp, went to orch to shop or movie with rock and yanti + andy .. hung out at cocca suki.. its really nice.. go crazy before o level, watched movie before science paper.. had that who-cares attitude.. then go crazy after o level.. the prom nite.. cried during prom nite.. everybody was suoper nice there,.. even my arch enemy.. kinda miss her though.hhehe..   3 months in indo was killing me.. boring.. this song was my only companion.. my parents were so busy, they don't give a damn. then flew back to sg.. on valentine's day.. received a love letter from aussie(cool rite :P).. then had dinner and movie with louis.. the days after that were the best of my life.. esp my b day.. he called me on 19th of feb to meet him in KS.. he played pool until midnight with a friend, but he never ignored me.. he would sit beside me until his turn came. after that a walk home from ks to my condo.. we just talked and talked, half way ppl were calling to say happy bday.. and louis was so depressed coz he was the first one to say it..hahha. when we reached morningside, he decided to stay.. we talked in the swimming pool until two.. he forgot that he had school tmr. he was late the next day while i woke up early in the morning realising that this song was playing the whole night. louis asked me out everyday.. crazy rite.. oh yah.. on the 21 of feb, he asked me out around 7 while i was in pasir ris having reunion with my class mates.. i left there after 12 pm..reached orch abt 1.. then met him.. we walked to gw but it was closed so we walked to singapore river.. he held my hand while we were joking.. we laughed so loud that the people there gave us dirty looks.. hahha.. we didnt care.. we walked holding hands.. then he hugged me all the way home. o level results' release.. i was so happy.. i never dreamt of becoming a top student.. happy.. then louis said he was so proud of me.. oh yar.. the day before it, i was so scared and he said "you will get gd grades.. if you got 11 pts i will give you a kiss".. and he did.. on that day.. his first kiss.. at my house.. but time flies when we are having fun rite.. so there i arrived at the day when i was abt to depart to seattle.. we broke up.. he said it was for the best, long distance relationship was hard and stuffs. gosh i cried, there in front of him.. and he kept hugging me,. he said .. nvm.. anyway.. thats how our relationship ended. on the plane he called to say good bye and stuffs. when i reached seattle.. i was cursing myself for not staying in sg.. i still talked to louis online.. and on the phone.. but it was over.. he said he will go to seattle after o level and if the feeling was still there, we will continue from there.. i was hurt.. all my friends said that he made a gd decision and it was because he loved me.. long distance would affect my study as well as his o level.. i just kept quiet.. for a moment i thought i had lost my heart, but there was something inside me breaking. i tried not to call him, not to go online... that time i though i was a living ghost.. numb and everything..   then i met kai.. on the bus.. he was gd looking and all.. nice.. but we just couldn't click at all.. but yogi made us click.. hahah yogi was funny, he tried hard for me and kai to get together.. when louis knew i've gotten myself a boyfriend.. he sort of pissed.. he told his friends that. he talked to me online.. but we knew it's time for us to move on.. i still love him so much though that time.. as for kai.. i nevert really liked him except for his physical appearance.. he looks a little bit like louis; the way he dresses, walks.. but other than that.. he is far from louis. my relationship with kai wasnt that great.. coz i still loved louis but i treat him very good though.. i don't know.. then time passes..me and kai got better and better.. as in we start to understand each other and stuffs.. he is nice and sweet at times..   me and louis don't talk online anymore(we used to talk everyday for hours for a year before we got together) sad huh..if you ask me now whether i still love louis.. my answer will be i don't know.. and if you ask me whether i love kai.. my answer will be i dont know as well. i am bad huh?  may be that's why i treat him so good.. coz i feel guilty. i don't know.   the day i broke up with louis.. i was totally ruined.. i lost someone who always cared for me for the past 1 year.. someone who loved me no matter what.. someone who was extremely patient with me.. someone who pampered me so much that he spoilt me. someone who always listened.. i lost a boy friend as well as a best friend.   so here is my story.. a very long one. gosh.. no matter how many times i tell my friends about this story... i thought by saying it out i am actually letting it go, but it is still so heavy inside.. even after wrtting this out.. i dunno.. i still want to cry.. i still curse myself..nvm... what a girl yah??

      I’m kind of bored. And tired of assignments too. So lets crap around. The subject of today’s crap is “love”. I know I know its kind of boring and very common. But im bored remember.   So what is love? Some may describe love as giving, some sacrificing, some sharing. Which one? Kind of confusing rite? How do you know that someone is in love with you? How can you differentiate love from affection or infatuation or like, adore?   Love should be something eternal rite? But in this world nothing seems to last forever. When you first meet a guy, the chemistry is everywhere. You think he is the one. Your heart skips a beat and other crap. But after you two get together, will these feelings last? When you know him better, will you love him more? or cursing yourself for choosing the wrong guy. Okay so you think you got “the one”, is he really the one or is it just you who try to deny the fact that he is not the one? Breaking up is a very hard thing to do. That’s why people are afraid of it. its not because they love their partner so much that they cant let go. Its because they are afraid of changes, of having no one there who they can always expect to render help whenever they need one. Break ups are painful, some may cry like mad, but time heals all wound rite? And they soon will get over whoever it is who is to be blamed for breaking their hearts and move on. Some find another partners and the process repeat itself all over again. It seems like human beings never learn from their mistakes.   Some may have relationship-phobia, but soon they will fall in love again. And get hurt again. Why? I don’t understand why? Why human beings tend to fall in love? It makes them happy, but like most drugs, it is damaging in the end. Relationships hurt. They hurt even more when you expect too much from them. In relationship, one may take the other for granted. Why is that so? Aren’t they suppose to love each other? Why are they now taking each other for granted? If they do take each other for granted, does that mean that they don’t love each other anymore?    You know what? I dun feel like continuing anymore. Coz it hurts.
