						    Well, I woke up this morning, and realised I was  healthy  again, after battling some horrifyingly relentless bug for the past fortnight. I could breathe! I could feel my lips! and I can tast again! Hit the coffee and chocolate hardcore. I'll be able to sing at the battle of the bands no problemo on friday, I'll tell you more about that later.      I fixed that damn  Darkness  album, very cool band, finnally someone  else  who uses falsetto for musical purposes! I started cleaning my room today, I have floor!      Got heaps of homework to do, I kinda missed today, sleeping, *Ding Dong*? must be the pizza, don't worry one of my slaves.... err i mean brothers wil answer the door. I think we got cheese, beef and onion and some other thing. Yum. At least I can taste it now! Hooray for Olfaction! I probably got that wrong and Claire's gonna yell at me, (being the science queen that she is). So yeah, I have    Art, Literature, and english homework from three months ago which I really have to do. A clean room may provide worthy incentive.       Well, i'm off for pizza, and I'll blog ya'z lat0rz!

						    Well, I guess 5 hours of staring at a screen attempting to repair a corrupt "the Darkness" album wrap could also drive you to the point of screaming and bashing your head against a wall, but oh well, I survived...(disco dances in chair).      I got bored, decided to read Claire's blog, and I must say "Damn", she's written more in the past month on her Blog than I have the whole year for schoolwork! That's dedication. So, I felt inspired, and here you are, my... Blog. lovely name for a voyeuristic and uncensored, intimate peak into an individual's mindworks. God help you, your'e in   my   head.      So this is me,  who am I  you may ask? I have no idea. I am everyone and I am no one.      Let's see.... Me..... Ok.... I know: You name it.... I'll eat it?.... ewwch, no, disregard that last one. I have no idea how to explain myself, perhaps future posts will slowly build up a picture of who I am, hopefully. I think this is more carthartic on my behalf, but, you may also get enjoyment out of reading it. WARNING: I have strange encounters, bizarre experiences, and really quirky friends. This blog is not for the light of heart, and if you have a pace-maker, please close this browser immediately. Ok, that should do for a first try. I hope to see you next time... If anything happens. Yeah. Ciao! ...thats Italian ;)
