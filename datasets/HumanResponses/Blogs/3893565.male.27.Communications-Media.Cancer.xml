      The most ironic thing in the universe exists on the Public Library located in Oxford, Mississippi. You can only imagine my surprise at seeing it. Directly across from the checkout desk is a poster of Miss Spears. She is half-naked and holding a book in the air. And there it is in large letters, “READ!”   This is so wrong for three reasons.   The first. I think Britney Spears holding a book on a poster that encourages reading implies that she actually knows how to read. I am not yet convinced of the evidence.   Second, in the history of history, there has never been a celebrity with a higher ratio of nakedness to interviews. (Possible reading) I challenge anyone to provide me with a Britney Spears interview that isn’t “Yall don’t really know me,” and “All I really want to do is dance.” I’ve had friends that have met Miss Spears in person that say they are filled with a profound sense of emptiness when they are around her, so much beauty so little anything else.   Thirdly, Britney Spears Videos do not encourage reading. They encourage another activity involving pictures.   My favorite lyrics in all of music take place in Britney’s song “Me Against the Music” with Madonna. Here’s the premise. Britney is in the dance club, but no one’s there. And Britney’s never really “lost control” and danced like she really wanted to dance. Madonna encourages her. And when I hear the song, all I can think of is back to the day she turned 18, and her appearance on MTV. For those of you that missed it Britney comes out wearing a fedora and a pantsuit. Then, halfway in, she rips the costume off revealing a partial gold bikini that mathematically covers as much as you can cover without owing money to the FCC. Her Milkshake then proceeds to bring the boys to the bar, she could teach you but she’d have to charge. It’s good to know that back the Britney was totally in control and wasn’t dancing the way she really wanted to. That could have gotten out of control.   Her whole career that’s just “Hey, look at me. I’m young and I’m naked.” No offense to the fans, but I don’t get it. If I need a pop princess, I’ll turn to Kylie Minogue, undisputable queen. If I want hotter women, I’ll look at Playboy. America, you’re drunk off your ass.

      That was my very first thought when I found out that John Kerry was the Democratic Nominee for President. Now let’s get something out of the way first. I would vote for Corkey from Life Goes On before I would vote again for George W. Bush. (For the Britney Spears generation, he was a little slow.)   That said, it’s hard NOT to make fun of John Kerry. You know, there was a movie a few years ago called Darkman. Darkman had been severely burned in a lab accident, but got revenge against the man that had done it by making masks of people and impersonating them. The trick was, the masks only lasted 90 minuets in the daylight. Hold for the joke.   John Kerry has so much Botox in his system, on television I am expecting him at any moment to glance down at his watch, see he has 2 minuets left, and dart off the stage, just like in the movie. I question if he can legally give blood, given the level of Botox in his body. I worry it might paralyze a girl scout or something.  I think John Kerry would make a good Bond Villain. Can’t you just imagine him behind a desk in a palace made of ice, or in a sea base or something? I’ve already come up with a name for him, “Meltface.” The backstory is he was horribly burned in a lab accident.   Even better, John Edwards is the perfect evil side kick. Seriously, I think he should give up this whole president thing and pursue this role. Can’t you just imagine what that smile would look like if he was evil? I’ve come up with a name for him too, “Chops.” Okay, I know the whole Jaws thing has been done before, but I would totally not want John Edwards to bite me. “I’ll be more than happy to assist you. In your demise! Hahaha!”

      ITEM!! I love Diet Coke. I really love Diet Coke. Then I realized that people that drink Diet Coke like me are more intense about only drinking Diet Coke than anything else in our lives. I’m trying to think of a way to turn that fact into a cult I can control.  When I get famous, I hope I can become a spokesperson for Diet Coke. Here’s the commercial. “Hi there. I’m thin celebrity Superstar John W. Flynt. There’s a very important reason to drink Diet Coke, it’s very simple. You have one of two unpleasant choices you can make. Either Coke tastes a little weird to you for about a week, or you can have a big fat ass. America, the choice is yours.”  When I proposed my commercial to this guy that works at the movies, he told me he drank tons of Coke all the time, and he wasn’t fat. I told him “That was because you’ve had hormones.” (He has muscles, I can’t even spell muscles without spellcheck.)

      Well, well, well. If you're reading this I'm finally famous enough that someone's interested in what I have to say! Well, if that is the case, this was started way back when. Just a man and a dream... a dream to get famous enough to meet Kylie Minogue. (I feel in life it's important to set reachable goals.)  In any case, I've just created this because I thought of something pretty funny, and I wanted to share it with someone. But I can't reach anybody on the phone. So anyway, here's my brilliant thought.  ITEM!! So I'm renting movies, and I see the movie "Spiderbabe." I'm working on a novel in which the main character is writing a bad superhero movie in which she will star. So I pick this up on a whim, I don't even realize that the movie is a Spiderman spoof until like 15 minutes into it.   This movie is so bad, the main villainess changes to a British accent when she is mutated. The movie is so cheap, all the music is public domain classical. This movie is so shameless, there have to be more than 20 sex scenes, most of them girl on girl. This movie is so poorly written, that when Spiderbabe attacks men with their face painted white, she says “You are making me long for the subtle art of mime.” Are you ready for the punchline?  This movie was still WAY better than Gigli.  Seriously, I watched Gigli on a twenty dollar dare that I couldn’t sit through the whole movie. It was the best twenty dollars I ever spent. My friend and I watched in for about twenty seven minutes, and we just couldn’t take it anymore. We were two intelligent adults, and we couldn’t figure out what was going on, or what the hell anyone was talking about.   Anyway, that’s it for now, enjoy my blogging.

      November’s getting ever closer, meaning we’re getting into the fun part of the season. I can’t think of a name for it, so I’ll describe it. Today, some political analyst, without no idea what they were talking about, thought it might be possible that Bush would drop Cheney from the ticket. People that do know what they’re talking about find this absolutely laughable.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  Remember that creepy guy in Lord of the Rings that was controlling the senile king? That’s Dick Cheney. In 2000, Bush begged him to leave Halliburton because he needed someone to tell him what to do. There is no doubt, Cheney is the most powerful vice-president in history, and has been likened to a prime minister. Every policy decision in this country, all the information on every decision goes to the President’s principals committee, comprised of Rice, Cheney, Powel, and they present issues to the President and advise him. That’s a lot of power. So you can see why it’s pretty ridiculous to think Cheney would be dropped from the ticket. And still all the networks speculated about it all day long, even reporting themselves how implausible the story was. By God, I love this time of year. It was worth the four year wait.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; I am a moderate Democrat, and I am certain that I’m on the right team. I know this because for 26 1/2 years, I was a right-wing republican. Over the years, my Republican beliefs have slowly been eroding away as I have learned a thing or two in life. It’s pretty funny, because pretty much everything I believed in high school? Well, I’ve learned that for pretty much all of it, the exact opposite is actually true. Let me tell you my story.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; I come from a right wing extremist family. Being the main child in my family interested in politics, my father gave me the goods on the Democrats. Democrats are power hungry extremists, and all they want to do is tax the rich and create all kinds of crazy government programs that do nothing and give free money to people. If you’re poor in this country, it’s because you’re lazy! This is America, all you have to do is work hard and you’ll succeed. The real problem in this country is the trial lawyers, and all they do is steal money from people. (Actually, Dad was actually pretty right on this one. One of my best friends has an uncle that is a famous ambulance chaser lawyer in a major city. His face is on the back of every phone book. She doesn’t tell people about the relation.)&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; In any case, by high school I had figured out we should have emergency welfare so people weren’t dying in the streets. And as for abortion? I think I have a pretty unique opinion on the matter. As a man, I don’t think I have a whole lot of business having a strong opinion on a decision it is impossible I’ll ever make. I learned a long time ago that women are smarter than men, and live on a completely different plane of existence. My political opinion of the mater is “It’s none of my damn business.” And that is that.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; It wasn’t until I moved to Washington DC to work for the Republican party that I learned the truth. If you are Republican, I know this is hard to hear, but listen to someone with more facts in their possession than you do. The Republicans fight with lies, they are huge liars, and they have no shame. Their entire characterization of Democrats are power-hungry cheaters seeking big government and permanent welfare is a total lie. The truth is, if you’re not in the top 1%, Democrats absolutely have your best interest at heart.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; And the funny thing is, I know the mindset!! I know what it’s like to be certain that Democrats were after my money. I know what it’s like to KNOW that Republicans are the true crusaders, the only thing keeping this country from turning into a pseudo-communist regime under the Democrats. I understand all to well to sit there and seethe that people that didn’t want to work (illegal immigrants, minorities) were stealing my money through high taxes, those bastards. Total fiction.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Alan Colmes wrote something to the effect that if you pretend to genuinely care about the people around you, sooner or later you won’t be faking. This is absolutely true, from my experience. Once you get rid of the self-hate inside you, something I see in most people, you genuinely care about people around you. It makes you think of things.&nbsp;  The truth is, we’re all in this together. I honestly look at my neighbors and care about them, it’s one of the wonders of likening yourself. In the end, Democrats are the one’s fighting from the Republicans giving it all away to the top 1% under Bush. Do you care if your neighbor can make a decent living? You just might be a Democrat, look at the facts.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; The truth is also, we are living in a Government controlled by bribery, also known as campaign finance reform. &nbsp;Right wing Republican extremists groups give a shitload of money. And Bush gives huge tax giveaways to them. And Halliburton, and all the phonies. Bush is giving huge tax giveaways to his contributors, and is absolutely shameless. I hate the motherfuckers.

      Although I’m currently stranded here, I am not originally from the south. DC is my home, and it’s the greatest city in the world. I miss it a lot. The south is a strange, strange place. Kid, I’ve flown from one side of this galaxy to the other, and I’ve managed to sample relationships and friendships with all different kinds of women. Italian, Hispanic, and African American women all tend to think that they’re the most intense kind of women, but I strongly disagree. When it comes to sheer voltage, Southern Women are the ones running the power plant. They also know how to make it go nuclear.   Here’s the story on Southern girls. First of all, they’re unbelievably beautiful. Seriously, for my first few weeks in Oxford I’m just kind of walking around in a sexually-frustrated daze, you can’t drive across the street without running into a girl you wouldn’t date in a second.   Without a doubt, my favorite sport in the world is women’s jogging in Oxford. In the Ole Miss bookstore, they sell something evil, a pair of the shortest jogging shorts you’ve ever seen, and right there on the left cheek is a big heart that says Ole Miss. It’s kind of weird seeing the school exploiting its female student’s asses for ad space and eyeballs.  There are two main variants of the species. For the first, it’s a very...picture day kind of beauty. If you’ve seen it you know what I’m talking about, it’s like a pit crew was involved. The fact that they always look so fabulous is not a lucky accident. These girls primp, press, and preen professionally. These girls wear so much mascara, I am surprised that it doesn’t get into their blood and kill them. These girls like to enter lots of beauty contests (I’ve never seen a Miss America without a Mississippian in the finals.) Seriously, they get thousand dollar dresses, and... well, that’s pretty much all I know. But that’s a lot to spend on a dress.  One of the members of this species was a professor of mine at Ole Miss, an Art History Professor. This woman somehow got tricked into not becoming a supermodel, and became a history professor instead. Tall, blond, and the fact she was funny made a bad situation even worse. I have never had better attendance in a class in my life, all the guys in the class wanted to see what she would wear. The day she wore a leather mini-skirt and knee-boots, I nearly freaked out. I later looked at a female friend’s notes from that day. It went. “Baroque era art was excessively ornate. I want those boots.”  The second variant makes me feel like a pedophile. They are these girls that are fresh out of high school, under 22, and they all look the same to me. They wear Greek party tee shirts and no makeup, and are totally hot. Usually they’re blond. This is where my primordial male instincts kick in. I understood a long time ago that looks were the least important thing in a relationship. When it comes to a relationship, humor and brains are virtually all I care about. (How did I luck up that my soon-to-be fiancé would also turn out to be such a babe?) But when it comes to these girls? You cannot help but want to go up to them and say “Holy shit are you hot! What’s it like to walk around all the time and be so hot all the time? Seriously, I’m going to try not to gawk at you as you and your friends walk by, but you guys are so hot, I can’t make any promises.”  So yes, southern women are really funny and interesting and holy Shit, are they HOT. But here’s the catch. I would sooner endure the wrath of Tony Soprano before I would incur the ire of a southern woman. Seriously, you don’t say hello to someone at a party, and you’ve got Melrose Place going on. These women are operating on a whole different plane of existence, I don’t pretend to understand them at all.   For starters, I have discovered that if I want to get the complete and utter attention of a Southern woman, all I have to do it mention that I am about to get engaged. And then they will listen to anything I have to say about the ring, and look at pictures of Jackie with nothing but total enthusiasm. These women are driven like no other girls I’ve ever met to find a husband and raise a family. Southern boys, beware. There was a book published called “The Rules,” guidelines on how to get a husband while dating. It is no surprise to me that this was written by two Southern women.   It’s very strange talking about Jackie, I was buying something in a department store the other day, and one of the prettiest women I’ve ever seen FREAKS OUT that I am about to propose. And I proceed to tell a girl I am tangibly attracted to all about another girl, and how I’m only with her. Wow, yeah. Really strange.  One last thing about Southern women. Their diets horrify me. Those of you that know me know I managed to lose 103 pounds last year. I’m intense about my diet, and am very careful about what I eat. And God knows, I would NEVER drink 100 calories of pure sugar, something known as a Coke. Southern girls drink Coke, not Diet Coke. In seeing all of the country, I’ve never seen so many girls drinking real Coke. And it’s worse than the Coke, these girls eat tons of Pizza, and all kinds of other greasy crap I see in the Union.   Like an evolutionary diagram, I’ve never seen a Southern woman in evolution. But being here in the south, there are insanely hot women... and then the rest of the population is obscenely overweight. Seriously, when I want to get a self esteem boost, I go to Wal-Mart. Because I am by far the best looking person there, there are people so overweight, I can’t decide what sex they are. There was one woman I saw... I stepped out of my car, and saw her open the door. She was so insanely fat, that her side had the shape of the Taurus in her side, and the shape was sliding out. By gut instinct I cried “Uggghhh!!!!” Her family stared at me with fury as I shamefully walked away.  Jackie promises me she will never cut off all her hair or put on a bunch of weight once we get married. I trust her. I could never be in that kind of marriage. Yet the activity of Southern women scares me, because it’s the kind of marriage I could never take. Here’s hoping.

      	I recently turned 27 on July 6th, it was a very exciting day for me. But not for the reason you might think, this birthday totally sucked, it started with a Cat scan at the hospital. No, July 6th was the day Star Trek Voyager season three came out on DVD. Pathetic to be sure, but this is Oxford. Tuesdays at Wal-Mart, or “DVD Day” as I like to call it is the most exciting thing that happens here.  	Now please don’t misunderstand, I’m not a Trekkie. Well, I am, but not like my friend Harry who has models and figures, and all the nonsense. What a weirdo. :) I just happen to really like this particular version of Star Trek, and that can’t be a good thing, you’ll find out why in a bit.  	The writers on Star Trek have the easiest writing jobs in America. I simply love the way the whole universe works, how do you solve the problem on Cronoton Particles that have infected Kes’s body? The doctor comes up with a brilliant idea, “Bombard her with ANTI-cronoton particals!” While watching the show on DVD, I often try to imagine the writing teams talking about the script, “What about Fellugelem? Does that sound like it could be a word a scientist would use?”  	It’s not a good idea to think about Star Trek too hard, because it simply never adds up. We hear spaceships explode, space is silent. I love that on every planet, there is a single representative, and apparently only one nation, and manner of dress. Apparently we don’t use toilets in the future, because I have never once seen a bathroom.  	 	I mentioned above that my love of Star Trek could be dangerous, and here’s why. When I notice these things, it makes me want to get on the Star Trek message boards and argue with fellow nerds around the nation about possible explanations for them. And that’s something Harry would do. I consider Harry a good friend, but he would be the first to admit, if there’s anyone having adventures in space, it’s Harry. The man is simply from another planet. Whenever you find yourself thinking about doing something Harry would do, I have a formal policy not to. I used to be a huge geek, and I know I’m just a small step from regressing and going to a convention CosPlaying “Sailor Bluto” in my pretty sailor suit.   	Without a doubt, my favorite thing about the show was the addition of Seven of Nine, played by Jeri Ryan. For those of you unaware, Voyager’s original ratings weren’t so hot at first. In the middle of the series, they write off bland Kes and take on blond bombshell Jeri Ryan who has gigantic fake boobs, and outfits so tight she had to learn how not to pass out in them. Dangling a woman like Jeri Ryan in front of a Trekkie is kind of like dangling a steak in front of a starving Ugandan child. It was so completely shameless, I had to step back and say “Thank you for having no shame. Star Trek and sex are very powerful urges for me, and now you’ve found a way to combine the two. You have my gratitude.”

      I have absolutely no idea why my girlfriend is dating me. Seriously, she is way beautiful, a lot smarter than I am, and talented at whatever she sets her mind to. Realizing there is no possible way I'm doing any better, I decided I should learn a thing or two about getting married to this wonderful creature.   If you're female and you're reading this, I know that you are aware that guys don't know much about getting married. But I don't think you quite understand the depth of our ignorance. Prior to getting engaged, guy possess only a single fact about getting a ring.   Sometime during puberty, we manage to get our hands on a copy of Playboy, for training purposes of course. In every copy of Playboy I've ever read, DeBeers has a small black ad, with the rules of buying an engagement ring. It says something about four C's and two-month salary being a guideline. That was it, the lifetime sum total of thought I'd put into getting a wedding ring.   I nearly lost my damn mind, shopping for a ring. I've seen the Sex and the City where Aiden buys Carrie the wrong ring and she doesn't want to marry him. This presents something of a problem seeing as you will show one woman a Princess cut diamond in a tiffany setting in platinum and she will say "That's perfect, I think it's the one." You show it to the next one and she says "Oh my God, that's so clichéd, how about a little originality, chump?" This state is known as Man-hell, any decision you make could be the wrong one.   In the end, I decided to spend a shitload of money. I kept it simple, a big old rock in a simple solitaire setting. I am convinced that the part of a woman's brain that is impressed by shinny objects will overrule the part of the brain that says, "Holy shit, I'm marrying John Flynt!!?? What is going on in my life and my mind that this is a good idea?"   As for the actual wedding, today I just picked up my first copy of Wedding Bells, one of those Brides magazines. I totally didn't look gay as I flipped thought the magazine with my light salad and soup at McAllister's. As I'm flipping through it all I can think is "Holy Shit, why would any sane person want to go through this ordeal!!??"  There was a five page article on THE RULES FOR THE INVITATIONS. Spell honor with a U? WTF? I'm sorry, when I think about what's important to me in my desire to make my girlfriend my wife and our future, I'm telling myself crazy Blockbuster late fees no more, I'm saving for a house. I'm thinking about how Jackie and I can have her antique furniture, and my spastic Bishon, Allegra. What, exactly does spelling honor with a u have anything to do with our marriage?   As for the dress, no argument there. Parading around in a Coteure' wedding gown? Totally what Jackie is about. If she had her way it would not be an isle, it would be a runway that she would walk down not once, not twice, five times. And no bridesmaids, gay backup dancers. As for the Prada silk camisole lingerie for the Honeymoon? What am I, stupid?   I laughed and I laughed as I read the 6 page spread on how to make sure you get the correct china dining ware. I think I've seen Jackie cook maybe once. It was a Pop Tart, and it was for her. The idea that she needs a very fine set of China for those special occasions with special company for the dinners she would prepare...frankly I'm planning on making fun of her about it.   To be honest, I would like to be married, but REALLY don't want to go through getting married. Everything about this whole ordeal horrifies me. But I think you'll like my idea for the wedding reception.   For the wedding guests? My gift to them is they don't have to suffer through a wedding reception, it says so on whatever you call the piece of paper you hand them when they walk in. In the magazine it says $11,000 is a reasonable budget for a reception. So instead, I plan to give $1000 dollars to our eleven closest friends in advance, and say "make it a party." I'm pretty sure, THAT will be an eleven thousand dollar party.   All joking aside, she really is the one. When I was 20, I liked 20 year old girls. I had no idea when I was 27, 27 year old girls would be so enthralling. I far prefer them, they're less rowdy. And Jackie? I love her with every part of my being.  The great thing about 27 year old girls is that by this time? They're so skilled at communicating with men, the signals they send out are very clear. I have a medically diagnosed, mildly retarded, 10 pound lap dog. Often, I try to explain to her I'm serving her dinner, and she looks at me confused. This is the same look on my face when Jackie tells me how she's feeling. 27 year old women know how to talk to men, it's very reassuring. I highly recomend them.  Look for more info as I take the plunge here.

      One of the most unusual friendships I have is with my friend Staci. Here's something I just wrote her.   "Sorry to keep blogging you, but I've been meaning to tell you this for forever. An author I was reading talks about&nbsp;a time when she wasn't happy with her life, and who walks into this restraunt but Bo Derek. And all she can think about later was how it wasn't fair she wasn't fabulous and exotic like Bo Derrek. Then her friend tells her that Bo's parents didn't name her Bo, Her ex-husband did, because it sounds fabulous. So from then on, the author decided she wasn't Jen anymore, she was Gin, named after her trademark martini. From then on, she introduced herself as Gin.&nbsp;That's why I think you should do the same and change your name to Staci Fabulous like your email address. I mean, I can't even remember what your real last name is, you're in my Palm as Staci Fabulous.&nbsp;I myself am going to change my name for when I move to Chicago. Here's my list, in order of probability.&nbsp;    &nbsp;  5. Chase   4. Bullett (Note the two T's)   3. John Fabulous   2. "Trash Can"   1. Clay Aiken&nbsp;    &nbsp;  I really am thinking about changing my first name to Chase. Do you like it? John "Chase" Flynt."  &nbsp; So as you can see, I have no problem whatsoever emailing her incredibly stupid ideas, and she doesn't block my email. It’s a nice relationship. When I met Staci, I knew I had made a friend for life, there was this incredible familiarity. You see, she’s adopted as well, and sucked into the seventh layer of hell, also known as the South. She once wrote me “When I read things you send me, I feel like I’m reading things that I’d written.” I felt as if I had written that too.  I joked to Staci that we are living in a Star Trek alternate reality when we didn’t meet, fall in love, and raise an evil Republican family. Because even though we’re so similar, it’s just never gonna happen.   Staci is amazingly Fabulous, you simply have no idea. She has to beat off gay men the way Martha Stewart will be beating off lesbian’s girlfriends in prison. (I used Martha Stewart because she is the Star Trek alternate reality version of Staci.) If gay men started a membership drive, they would put Staci on the poster in her clubwear. The tagline would read GO GAY, and millions of men across the country would suddenly pick up an interest in musicals. When I watch Will and Grace, I’m wondering when they’re gonna meet Staci already, as she’s met every other goddamned gay man in America.  You might wonder if the fact that I believe Staci is so fabulous indicates that I have a gay leaning. This simply is not true. The truth is that we’re living in a Star Trek alternate reality where I’m not gay,&nbsp;and that’s the best reason I’ve come up with.

      I was born in 1977, meaning I had never heard of the movie Network when a friend explained it to me. When he did, I was shocked that the movie hadn’t been written yesterday, the premise being so prophetic for our time.  Let me preface these remarks by saying, I have voted Republican my whole life. I’ve done it all. I wrote Trent Lott endless letters to impeach Clinton. I moved to DC and worked in Republican offices all over this nation. But I would vote for Corkey from Life Goes On Before I will again vote for George W. Bush.  This movie Network, which won both best Actor and Best Screenplay was written when a corrupt President had just been kicked out of office. We were trying to get out of a war with no end in sight, and sensationalistic journalism was coming at the expense of actual news reporting.  At the end of the movie, the news anchor captures the zeitgeist of the moment, telling his audience “I don’t have the answers. But I do know for things to change, you’ve got to get mad. So I want you to get out of your chairs. And I want you to go to the window and you shake your fist and you shout ‘I’m mad as hell, and I’m not going to take it anymore!’ Those were incredibly prophetic words for today.  This is the most important election of our lifetime. I only ask that people get out and vote, because in their wildest dreams it’s a 50/50 election.  John W. Flynt

      Okay I saw this movie, and the only thing I can say is oh my God, the last 4 years all fell into place now. I used to hate Bush, but now I understand it all, I feel sorry for him. You see, George Bush never went AWOL from the Texas Air National Guard...George Bush was abducted and sent to a lab and brainwashed into doing whatever Dick Cheney tells him to!  Here's the 411 on how the decision to invade Iraq was made. George Bush picks up a phone one day, here's the conversation.  GB: "Hello?" Voice: "Lietenant George Bush?" GB: (confused) "Yes?" Voice: "Lieutenant George Walker Bush?" GB: (zombified) "Yes..." Voice: "This is Dick Cheney. Sadam Hussein is an evildooer. Go invade Iraq." GB: "Can do, big guy!"  So there you have it, the real story on the decision to invade Iraq. Bob Woodward doesn't know what he's talking about with his whole Plan of Attack book. Thank goodness you have this Blog to let you know the truth the liberal media is keeping from you.
