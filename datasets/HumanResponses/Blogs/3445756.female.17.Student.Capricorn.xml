      Today was the last day of exams! Yipppeeee! And of course I started it out w/ getting up late!   Of course I have no idea what I'm going to do the whole summer. My parents expect me to get a job. Its a town of 300, where the hell am I going to get a job. My mom says I could shred papers at the bank. Um I think they could hire a 3 year old to push the button on the paper shredder. Yet, somehow my brother never had to go and find a job, he was always guaranteed a job working on the ranch. But I'm a girl, so of course I can work on the ranch, if I do it will be more 3 year old jobs. My parents can seem to let me grow up, I will forever be 3................  There is this person say her name is Betty. Well Betty drives me insane!! Betty has dated "Bob" for like 2 years. But the part is they are worse then a married couple. When in D.C. for Close-Up Betty made such a big deal about not spending enough time w/ Bob, when actually they were w/ each other the whole time, except for sleeping! Betty is very dumb, and its not just my opinion! If you'd like I can do surveys on her and send ya the statistics. Betty signed up for AP classes just because Bob is smart and is taking them. The teachers even recommended that she not take them. I was going through the history tests the other day and she got like a 50% on most of them. In our grading scale anything below a 71% is an F! It drives me insane! When she was in 8th grade she dated this colored guy and he was a druggie, drunk, dumbass(no offense to anyone colored) but yeah so she was like that to, she acted all bad and dressed insane. But then they broke up when she was a freshman and she started to go out with Bob. But the killer part is she changed her personality to fit Bob since he is a goody-goody. She's the kind of girl who doesn't know who the hell she is and has to depend on a guy. Now to the next disgusting part, she is always sticking her hand down her pants to pick her thong out of her butt. It is so disgusting! If ya can't handle a thong, don't wear them.  So what it comes down to, is she basically drives me insane! She's nice and all there is just something about her. Just think I have to spend the whole year being co-cheerleading captain with her!  Well I'm off to eat pizza and pop, which of course Betty would never approve of since its not the healthy thing to do and it could really hurt my physical ability for cheerleading the summer!

      I gave up caring. Yet, I didn't even realize that I gave up caring until today. I havn't cared since Feb. I don't understand why I don't care about anything anymore. Now that I realize I havn't cared it bothers me that I don't. I need to care what kind of grades I get. I need to be studying for semester tests. But somehow I can't force myself to study or get up when my alarm goes off in the morning, because I just don't seem to care.  I need to figure out who I am and what I'm doing in life. Doesn't everyone need to figure that out. Maybe its more that I want to figure out who I am, not that I need to. Everyone wants things, hardly anyone ever needs something. Its so frustrating not understanding yourself or not even knowing yourself. I look in the mirror and all i see is a 5" coat of make-up covering up who I am. The plaster is so perhaps no one can see inside my soul, see what I really am. Its as if I have put up an appearance so no one can know my secret, I am lost. People look at me and see: Oh, shes going to be a senior who gets perfect grades, is a cheerleader, yearbook editor, student coucil represenative, BPA state vice president and the list goes on..... But the only reason I am so active in organizations is so that I don't have to think about how I have no idea what I'm going to do with the rest of my life. I started making up college majors so when people asked my I didn't have to reply with an "I don't know."  I am still utterly shocked at the fact that I was voted in as BPA vp. I went in sure I wouldn't get an office. I kept reasuring myself, that when I didn't get an office, it wasn't because I wasn't good enough, it was because well I'm not sure why. I was so sure I would stand up and everyone would burst up laughing. Dang, I don't think I was ever so nervous in my life. Not even all the times I was nervous could add up to how nervous I was. I don't maybe I don't give myself enough credit and I'm more then I think I am. But it bothers me when people are all that, and they know they are all that.  I admit I have issues. Issues which I could type about forever. But these issues need to wait so that I may go to bed and then in the morning, 1 hour after my alarm goes off, I will think "Oh shit I forgot to get up and why the helll didn't I study at all for any of my exams today??"

      So, the whole point of doing this was so i could get all of those thoughts out of my head. But now that its time to get the thoughts out of my head, the thoughts are no longer there. So I don't seem to have much to ramble on about.   The best smell in the world, besides rain has to be the smell of fresh laundry. I think I could just sit there and get high off the smell of clean clothes.  Well I 'spose since I have nothing to say, I won't say anything at all....

      At camp-mak-a-dream there was this girl in our cabin, she was in the other set of rooms w/ angie, all of the other girls were on the other side. There was an empty bed so she could have of course moved over to our side. Yet, no one even asked her. We did of course ask if we could eat the easy cheese she brought, but she said no. This is perhaps why we didn't ask her if she wanted to sleep with us that and the fact she seemed a little odd. Not like insane i'm a mental retard odd, odd as if something didn't seem right. So on Friday after lunch a group of us came in and Jessica says she just heard this girl through up and she went and asked her if she was alright. Well of course the girl said she was fine. All the girls of course wanted to chit-chat about what was wrong with her. They went on about how many they should go ask her again or sit with her at meals. They were determined to see if she was bulimic. I shut my thoughts away. I couldn't stand to here them talk about it. I wanted to go and talk to her tell her there was nothing wrong with being bulimic. Saturday Michelle and Amanda heard her throw up again. Michelle being all good went and told Angie and Mrs. Fiedler. I couldn't stand to hear them talk about what to do. For the first time I had nothing to say on the subject, I wanted them to just leave it alone, leave her alone. I thought what if I had a bracelet, maybe she would recognize and be able to come to talk to me. Yet, I'm not sure if she would since obviously not everyone knows of the bracelet. Amanda kept trying to imitate the noises she made and I almost wanted to smack her. I think about what I have done to myself in the last year and I wonder how I got where I am. I remember how my eyes filled with blood and how the dr. asked if i had been vomiting lately. Of course I said no. As a result the dr. and the eye dr. were able to come up with no conclusion as to why my eyes had filled with blood. If I hadn't had to go through all the questioning for a month I don't think I would have stopped. I've changed I went from Jen who didn't care during freshman year to who i am now. I'm not sure who I am now but I know i'm not the same. I have done so many things this year that i regret. But I don't regret the bulimia. I have yet to overcome my problems nor see anything wrong with my problems. Some say people come up with their problems for attention. I know this was not the case.  I have never told anyone of all the things I have done this year nor have I ever got caught. I don't know how to deal anymore.  For now I'm here, here in my box, trapped, theres no escaping what I have done, nor can I pretend I have not done these things. They say to thing outside the box. Yet, thinking outside the box means you relize you realize you are in the box. It took me a year to realize I was in the box now I just have to take a step out....

      So I thought I’d do my monthly entry in this exquisite chronicle of mine. So……………Where I shall I commence?  I suppose I could write a manuscript on my existence. But for now I will stick to 2 diminutive stories…..On to my charming tales.....  In the beginning…..it was softball tournaments. After a long day of getting down and dirty washing cars it was time to let loose at the street dance. May I mention if you’re a cop and you happen to be reading this, I was not drinking…..Ok, I don’t care arrest me, I was drinking. But anyway, Tyler came down visit Nikki and brought a friend. Anyway I was standing with them over in the street along with Alyssa and Kendra So Alyssa instantaneously hooked up with this guy. I don't recall his first name at the instant, but his last name was Price. So we’ll refer to him as Mr. Price. (I know I babble on like a moron but I have to get all these jumblings out of my head, and I’m sure this is extremely monotonous story) So Nikki and Tyler went to my car to get a coat. Blah, blah blah….hoe, also known as Alyssa was making out w/ this guy so I left w/ Kendra, who was completely trashed. So we headed over to the action in front of the bar. Right away some guys called me over. And being my shy self I was going to disregard them and keep moseying along. However, Kendra being very social pulled me back. Blah, blah, blah....I met all of em, yet I couldn't seem to remember any of their names the next day. So I was talking to the guy who called me over. He was from Bozeman, 20 and really hotttt! His name was Bubba, which I swear on even though Kendra never remembers meeting a bubba. But Shelly who was also really drunk saw me with him and verified he was a major hottie. He could even walk a pretty good straight line. So we were sitting on the bench in front of the bank talking, I’m not really sure what we were talking about. (Wow there is lots of missing details in this story!) But I asked him why he wasn't dancing and he gave the excuse that he was white and couldn't dance. I didn't really want to dance because it was the lamest country and I never even heard of any of the songs but I attempted to get him to dance. So a while later he decided it was a good song so we had to dance to it. Yadda, yadda yadda, we danced, we made-out. Good story, huh?  The next day I learned I had a 5 inch hole in the butt of my pants. Which everyone swears they didn't notice. Which I have no idea how I got the hole in my pants or how anyone could not notice it. But that could explain why everyone was checking out my butt! Ha ha ha! So please, next time I’m drunk let me know if I do something really embarrassing like put a hole in my pants! A week later my mom decided to ask me then if I was. Hello? What does she think I’m going to say? Ha I told Swenson that and he just laughed!  Anyways Story 2:  We went up to Helena again for BPA. Michelle, one of the officers was unable to attend due to the fact that she was in Japan. Jessica, the president had to sit in during the mind-numbing board meeting. So the officers had their meeting outside, we were in the mountains at this place people get married. So I got to run our meetings. Luckily we didn’t have to bore ourselves to death and got to decorate out director chairs. Mine says Jenny P. and as Seth said, you can tell a cheerleader decorated it. After dinner all the old bats thought it would be fun if we went to the carousel. We were all very against this at first. But the officers ended up riding it like 3 times. Swenson and Mrs. Crosmer even rode. The rest of the old bats just watched. So anyway none of that had anything to do w/ the main story. But BPA has been so fricken fun so far, yet a TON of work. I had to take minutes since Michelle wasn't there. It was 6 pages and we only talked like 2 hours and we were there 2 days. OK back on track. None of that had anything to do with the point of the story. So Jessica’s mom came up and she said she was really tired so she was going to stay w/ her mom instead of jen and I. So we got our own room! Yayyyyyyy! So jen had kept in touch w/ one of the Decca guys and called him up and we went swimming, him, Seth Jesse, jen and I. Well I sat in the hot tub till I got throne in. The Decca guy left because he was going out to party. Seth and Jesse came to our room and ordered out pizza. But both were really tired because he had been really hyper all day and killed so much energy. So they went to bet around midnight. At like 12:30 Seth called and he was so fricken dead but he wanted me to listen to Jesse snoring. I felt bad for him but was still really hyper. Ok, must focus on story! So jen and I called the deca guy and told him he should come back which he did but couldn't stay long. Due to the fact that I was still bouncing off the walls (that is a damn good song) I needed something to occupy me which resulted in him calling one of his drunken friends on the phone so I could talk dirty to him. I must have a major slutty voice when I want to. Anyway this guy, Cory was really into my voice even though he didn't know who I was. However, he did know the other jen because she had met him the week before when she was in Helena. After chatting awhile he mentioned that he could be there in 10 min. if I wanted him. And the decca guys was all freaking out saying how drunk he was and he would probably try and rape me. But anyway I told Cory I couldn't sleep with him because the Fergus advisor was next door. I have no idea what floor Swenson or anyone else was on. Mrs. Fiedler lives in Helena so she didn't stay there. No one really told us what time we had to be in our room. We just did whatever. Earlier I had found out that you can't take the stairs to get to the main floor, you end up outside in the walking mall and I couldn't figure out how to get back to the front, and the doors lock and you can't use a key on them, that and they aren’t numbered. Plus I later found out there is a crazy old drunk in the walking mall at night. After some time they called and said they were done there and I went down to let them in. The guy at the desk was on the couch watching TV and totally looked at me but I just kept going and went outside, but they weren't there so I waited then went back upstairs. The deca guy calls them and they said they had beer and went around the block to get rid of it. So I went back down and the guy once again looks at me really weird, which could be due to the fact that it was 2 in the morning. Yet, they still weren’t there. But there was this guy dribbling a ball. So I went up to him and asked if the was Cory. Here I’ll put it in dialogue for ya! "Are you Cory?" says jen all perky "Um no, I'm not" replies the stranger "Are you looking for a Cory" "Yeah, this guy Cory was supposed to be down here" says disappointed jen (ha that rhymes) "Oh I’m sorry" says stranger"So what are you doing down here at this time of night" asks jen still very perky "Oh I'm waiting for my girlfriend to get off work." replies the stranger "But if you want I can be Cory" "That’s alright I think ill go back inside and see where he is" replies perky jen  Once upstairs I become conscious of the fact that I am a dumbass and that he had the notion that I was a hooker. Which Jen and Decca guy thought was hilarious and I just felt like a moron! But anyway we called to see where the hell they were and come to find, out they were at the wrong holiday inn. But anyway Decca guy had to go. But they still came. There was four of em. They even brought their beer up w/ em. Cory and one name Jake were pretty cute and they were only 19, which is an age improvement. Don't worry I didn't make out with any of them. Anyway they stayed and chatted for awhile then left to go party. I managed to get 2 hours of sleep. Turns out the Fergus advisor could hear us when she was awake; luckily it was just Seth and Jesse then. But I guess she sleeps pretty heavy and didn't hear anything afterwards. I think Swenson might be a little irate if he knew about this time. At camp it was fine because I snuck out to a cabin full of guy officers. But this time I snuck drunks’ in.  So the morale of the story is don't be out on the avenue in Helena exceptionally late.What happened to me being all timid? Dang I have tainted so much. Customarily I would never even look at a guy let alone say hi to him. Now I’m chatting to strangers on the phone and on the street. What has this world come to?  Ok, so the point of these two exquisite chronicles is that I have transformed into one of the Denton hookers. The people I loathe foremost. The anecdotes seem moderately inoffensive, no sleeping with six different guys in one night. But these stories were chosen because well I’m not about to type everything I’ve done this summer….. Anyway, I can’t believe how tainted I am. I used to not care if I went and hung out at night; reputation was such bullshit to me. I didn’t go to prom my freshman year for the reason that I could have cared less about it. I never even had second thoughts about it.  I had my hair chopped off today, just to symbolize that I do not give a fuck anymore about what anyone assumes. All last spring everyone kept influencing me not to slash my locks off. Well today I woke up and realized I didn’t care what anyone else thought. My cousin is a beautician and did a tremendous job. Except she wouldn’t cut it off as short as I wanted it because she was apprehensive I was going to be remorseful about, due to the fact that it was extremely spur of the moment.  I miss being outlandish all the time and not caring what I do. My cousin who will be a sophomore, her and I are such frenzied freaks and used to do the weirdest things. One time she threw a toothpick out the window on the way home and after driving a mile I decided to turn around and make her go obtain it. I said she was littering, even though it was biodegradable. Ok, sounds uncanny. However, we were amazingly amused. Tonight it was 60 degrees out and we decided to stick a sprinkler under the trampoline, like when we were little. Her sister, who will be a junior, was to cool for us. Oh, what boredom can do to you!  Ok, I have to stop typing since I have to get up early and work. Which I get ghastly wages, yet I need the experience. I do apologize to whoever is reading this. I believe at the beginning of the four pages, I stated that there were only two short stories. Now, I’m off to visit mia...............
