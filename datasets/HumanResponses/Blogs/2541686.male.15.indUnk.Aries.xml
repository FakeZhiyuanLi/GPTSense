      Hey hey! So I just had a party tonight... And there where supposed to be like 19 people going... But only eleven showed. And Erik and Ryan couldn't go because Erik had to go to the hospital because there was something wrong with his baby brother... and Ryan was sick... so yea... But I still had a good time tonight. But I just feel bad because this girl Shannon, that is like best friends with Nick, thought I said something bad about Nick... and she got really mad at me... soo I don't know. Oh well... So me and Steph are good now... and I guess everythings ok. Its almost one day away from Christmas! In like three hours... and I can't wait! lol. I'm getting an iPod and a digital camera! YESS!! lol. WOOO! OK... I let all my energy out. So anywho... I know I probably talk a lot about Erik in this blog... But I just want to say one thing... ok? lol. OK... so Nikki was talking to him on the phone... and I said that I needed to talk to him on the phone at ten... but he said he couldn't... and I said ok... call me tomorrow... Well... Nikki finally give him a clue why I wanted to talk to him about.... and she just said drugs... and he said something like omg I don't do drugs... well I don't know. But he lied to Nikki if he did... and thats what I am starting to think more and more now. That he does do drugs. ok... I think I've said enough about him... so moving right along... oo ya... I kissed my gf! lol. I feel proud of myself! .lol. g2g email me! @**Marry Christmas**@  ~Matt

      Well..... Its 10:27 in the morning... and I'm very tired. buy yea... Erik never called... and I was telling Steph this and she said that he probably knows that I know he has been doing them... and he doesn't want to talk to me otherwise he would have to admit it that he does do it. And I think that's why he didn't call me. I don't know. But I'm going to call him at like noon or so. Any who... last night... yea it was bad. Steph was mad at me because I kind of lied... well I felt really bad that I did... and I hope she forgives me. And then I'm going to have like a party tonight... and there will be like 18 people going... and I hope I'm going to have a fun time. But the only problem is that Erik is going.... and yea... I don't know what to do. Also this other girl that almost everyone hates is going.. Katherine... and she is the most annoying person probably at the school. But she knows if I would say its canceled... because she lives like down the street form me kind of... but I'm going to like tell her its at 8:30 or something... but it would really start at like 5 and end at 10. So I hope everythings going to be ok... and I'm going to have a fun time. g2g ttfn!

      Hey Hey!Well... Its 9:34... and Erik was supposed to call my house... but I'm guessing he forgot... and he doesn't care or somethin. I don't know. But I just got back from the YMCA... and yea.... Ryan never showed up... so I just worked out with myself... and lets just say I had one of the loneliest days ever. You probably think omg this person needs to chill out and calm down... but I can't help it. All my friends say I'm the most sensitive and emotionally boy they ever knew... well I agree with them... but I can't help it. lolol. well.... Erik still hasn't called yet... and I'm getting madder... so I think I'm ganna go now... lol. TTYL  ~Matt

      Well.... here I am again... lol. I just made this blogger... and I have soo much to say... Also.. before I forget... please visit my website... it has pics of all my friends and everything.... so yea... go there.... www.cibulka.4t.com lol. Anywho... more about me... my name is Matthew... I was born on April 10, 1989... and I've been going out with Steph for about 3 months now. I have about six cousins... and about 6 uncles. My family is really the same as any other family.... I have a dog... named honeybee... she is a half lab/ half beagle... and is about 4 or so. I also have a brother that is really annoying... lol... his name is Jeff... and he goes to the same school as me. I'm a freshman... and he is a Junior. I like almost any music really... besides bluegrass... Country... Rap.... and some gospel. lol. I could listen to almost anything. My fav. music is like Harder to Breath by Maroon 5... and then something to like All I Wanna Do by Sheryl Crow. I feel that music brings out the most in people... and what makes us different from each other. I'm very emotional sometimes... and I care a lot about my friends... I look up to them... and I would do almost anything for them. Sometimes my family isn't always that great... so I look at my friends as my family... and that's why sometimes I get really depressed if they do something bad.. like drugs or somethin... I don't know. But when they are mean to me.... then it gets really ugly. lol. *hint*hint* for some of my friends that are reading this... lol. Well I don't know where to start... so... here is goes.... I used to be friends with this guy named Chris... well... right now I hate him.... but he seemed nice... and he was going out with one of my best friends Holly.. so I was just trying to be nice... well then Holly dumped him... and he started doing things to my girl friend... like touching her butt all the time... hugging her... and even tried to kiss her at my house when I was in the bathroom.... and he even told me that we should break up! grr! lol...so then I got all mad at steph.. and said thin needs to stop... well she told Chris off... then he called her up and then they where friends again... so I didn't know what to do. I know that Chris wouldn't stop doing it to her... and steph (gf) thought it was all a big joke... but its not... but then after a huge fight... Steph told Chris off... and he still emails her and spreads rumors about her... and then steph's best friend Dannile... well her and Chris both went to the MHS Hockey game cuze steph is a cheerleader... well then Chris fingered Dannile... and then she gave him a hand job... and then in the car... right infront of steph... he fingers her again. So ya... we don't talk to Chris anymore... he is just an ugly fat pig! lol. And then... the other day.,.. during lunch... I sit with my friends that I have known since like 2nd grade... well.... Chris also sits with them... and he just moved here... so they are friends with him too. Well... Chris movies to another table... and soon everyone else moves... so I move... and then they moves again... so I move again... then they move... and i moved for the last time.... I felt horrible. The all my friend at the other table saw what happened... and they all came out in the commons and hugged me... and they want me to sit with them from now on. And then he spread rumors about me, steph, and holly... and it just bothers me. I never really did anything to him... but he does this BS to me. So moving right along... about the Erik thing.... he is like a lot more popular than me.... And I feel like a big dork... and he doesn't really like me or care about me or anything. I don't know. It just seems like hes too cool for me... uk? And I wonder why he really likes to hang around with me sometimes... because he could be with a lot cooler guys and girls than me... and he is also not good at calling people back... but it makes me feel as if he doesn't want to talk to me or somethin. And then like after school... me n him planned to go to the YMCA... well like two times he didn't show... with out saying that he couldn't or anything... but the last time he showed... so I don't know what to think. He could have text or called me phone or somethin... to tell me that he couldn't have gone.. uk? But I'm going to call him later today so wish me luck! lol. I hope everythings going to be ok... ok and so then this other guy named Nick... well he kindof acts like he is gay... lol... but I don't know if he is... he says he likes this other girl named Nikki... but it could be a cover up.... lol. Well anyways... he says that I am stalking him.... right................. well sorry bud but I don't stalk people... and especially other guys... That's just gross and scarry.... lol. And I have been really nice to this guy too. lol. I got him and his best friend Shannon tickets to a Maroon 5 concert (both of our fav. bands) and other stuff like that. And also bought him a $40 Hoodie from American Eagle..... but he didn't like it I could tell... also cuze he hasn't worn it yet... so I don't know. Well I think I have written to much... lol... but I'll keep you posted later.. TTFN!  ~Matt

      OK... whats new with me today? Well... kindof alot... lol. OK... I have a lot of girl friends... but not to many boy... friends.... you know what I mean... lol. I don't know why but I'm just not good at makin friends with guys. I don't know why. But... my best guy friend.. Erik... well... I talked to his brother the other day... and he said to me that he might be doing drugs. Well... I can't stand people who do... drinking... well I'm a little more lenient on... but drugs... yea that's bad. And then I found out that when his sister comes home with her boyfriend... they have it... and he knows this.. so he gets it from them. But his brother doesn't know for sure... becouse he goes to sleep before Erik does... but he knows that he has at least done it once. Well... I asked him last night if he ever does/still does... and he said he has tried it... but he said its gross and will never do that stuff again. So I don't know what to believe anymore. Should I believe him? I'm going to ask his brother to stay up late one night and see what he does... and also I'm having this big Christmas party thing... and its two days away... and he is going to be there.... so what should I do? I really need help. But I really do care about my friends.... and I would probably do anything for them... evan risk my life for them... and I hope they would do the same for me. PLEASE email me with anything you would like to say to me... I would really like it. Thank You! TTFN!!  ~Matt

He is supposed to be coming over at like noon tomorrow... and then staying till 10 at night... Because I'm having a party... I don't know what I should do. And I called him and was like... tell me the truth... did you or did you not do anydrugs... well he lied and said he did once... and it was gross and will never do it again... well he did it this Saturday... So he lied to me! :( I don't know what I should do anymore... He is supposed to call me back later... but I don't think he will... he is bad about calling people back.

      Hey Hey! I'm going to try to write more in this blog... since I haven't been that good at it... lol. Soo anyways... this week... Erik's friend Alex died on Thursday... and the funeral is this Friday. His mom said its either the funeral or the winter dance (that's going to be on that Saturday) because its her mom's week to have Erik... and I'm ganna be going with Erik to his mom's this weekend. WOO! lol. Well its Sunday... and I"m really really bored because my other friends are with there family, ect... so we aren't ganna be doing anything. Ohh ya... something that also is bothering me... lol. OK... remember how Erik said I was one of his best buddies? Well.... I found out he calls everyone that... and I don't know... I just don't think he really means it... he just says it... lol I know I worry about this stuff too much. lol. So anywho... my friend Holly broke up with Jason Matti this week... becouse it just wasn't working... and Holly happened to read a convo with Jason's ex. But right before that... Erik decided to ask her out to the dance... (remember that Nikki wanted to go with him... and we are like all friends in this group here.. lol) Well Holly said yes of course... but she felt sorry for Nikki... becouse she really wanted to go with him to it. But she can't evan go to it anymore... becouse she broke her foot. :(. Well I'm ganna go... TTYL!   ~Matt

I have to go to this competition for cheerleading (because my girlfriend is a cheerleader) Well... its from 7-3 on a Sunday morning... and she wants me to go to it.... I I asked Erik if he wants to go with me you know... to keep me company... well... he goes and invited his friend Cory to come along with him... so that would mean he would ignore me... and I know he will.... becouse that's what he does when I'm with his other friends sometimes... but I don't know... But last night I was so pissed... Because everyone tells me there troubles... and me... being a very caring person... lol... Listens to them and gets all worked up on them... and I just can't handle it right now. I need to worry about my own lives... And also... Last night Erik got drunk last night (little sis n bro swear he did) and he is saying that he did not drink... well I think he is lieing to me... and that also pisses me off... Well I don't know what I'm ganna do anymore... but i g2g. TTYL!  ~Matt

      Hey hey!!!   what's going on??? Well... this is what's happing in my life right now... lol. Well first of all... my best friend Erik is thinking about going to Northwest and live with his friend Cory next year. :'(. I really hope he doesn't. He means a lot to me... and I don't know how I will get through the year without him there... becouse everything will remind me of him... and I would be sad almost everyday. He says he will come up to visit us... but he won't... he would have to be at his dads and moms most of the time... if he's not with Cory. And like this year... he wanted me to join choir with him next year... and so I signed up for men's choir just for him. Because you know I can't sing worth crap... But I did it for him... Because that's what friends is all about. But now he is ganna go to Northwest... So he won't be in my class... And I feel like he abandoned me. But I don't want to talk to him about it right now because he is depressed and stressed out with this whole Northwest thing, Holly, his friends, school, MHS Idol, and baseball. So I'm ganna wait till later I guess to tell him... so he won't go all psycho on me lol. But I hope he really doesn't go next year. I would do almost anything so that he will go next year. He just doesn't know how good of friends he has... and he's ganna lose them if he goes there. I don't think I can be his friend if he is going over there... and I'm ganna ask him if he is... becouse I don't want to get hurt anymore than I already have. I also think that he might go back to his old ways if he goes back... like to the drinking/smoking/drugs thing. He says he swears he won't... but he will... I know him. And I told him that it reminds me of that commerctial about the girl just standing on the dock... and her friend is drowning in the lake... and all she does is stand there... not helping. It makes me feel like that... that its right for a friend to help his other friend. Right now I'm listing to a song that kindof reminds me of how our group started... I mean we could have seen each other before and not even know it.... here is alil part of the song...  Somebody in the next car Somebody on the morning train Somebody in the coffee shop That you walk right on by everyday Somebody that you look at But never really see Somewhere out there is somebody  Good ehh? lol. Well I'm ganna go. TTYL  ~Matt

      Hey!  OK Erik broke up with Holly... right before she was about to to him. That's alil mean and gay. I mean comeon... lol. N E Who... I'm just alil upset now cuze remember the note thing I sent to him? Well... he said that is BS and he doesn't ignore me... and that's all. Well he does... and he did today during lunch... and you know I'm just tired of it... screw it! lol. I'll give this one more chance... and if he doesn't grow up and start being a friend rather than ignoring me at school but being my friend after... there is just something not right here. Holly said maybe its because he always sees me and never sees anyone else at school... so he spends time with them than me... but you know that makes me feel like he hates me... and apparently he's too cool for me. Well w/e. If he wants to be my friend... he has to mean it and don't ignore me. But I'm also tired of getting into fights with him and everything almost every week. I just need a guy friend that doesn't diss me or treat me like crap... Because I have no luck... :( lol. Sometimes I think he was just my friend because I knew Holly... and I could put in good words for him so that they could go out.. but now since they aren't... then o I'm not ganna be Matt's friend anymore. I think that's what he is doin here. lol. And it also pisses me off how he says he'll call back then he doesn't. I know he remembers... but he doesn't "feel like it." Well whatever.... just go and fuck urself bitch. Sorry but it really pisses me off right now... lol. Well I think I'm ganna go think about things... and calm down lol. I'll TTYL!  ~Matt

      Hey!!!!! OK... so this is what happened.... Holly forgave Erik! OMG! I am both of their friends and everything... But I think Holly is making a big mistake. If he did it once... he is ganna do it again. Ryan even knows one of the girls who flashed him... so it has to be true. I think he just put on the sympathy thing to get Holly to feel sorry for him... and that's it. Well if he does ANYTHING WHATSOEVER to cheat or hurt Holly... whoa buddy your askin for it! lol. Well anyways... here is what I wrote Erik...  Well I just wanted to wait till later to tell you about this... but I guess you are ok now... so I guess I can talk to you about my lil prob now... sry 2 but this on u. But sometimes I really question if I'm really your friend. Sometimes you treat me like crap... and I really don't know if I can be your friend. You mean alot to me... but if you say that I'm one of your best friends.... you have to mean it cuze the way you have been treating me seems like I'm not. Like one example is on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday you where supposed to come over... but at the last sec... your like oh well I'm going over to the rut's... and that made me really upset. If you say that you can do something... but then you plan to do something with someone else... that makes me feel like you just do stuff with me as a last resort. And then on Friday... I asked if you can come to my house... then you said you couldn't cuze u had to go out and eat... then u called me and ur like my dad's pissin me off cuze I can't go over 2 the Rudd's... well I thought you wanted to do something with me... but I guess not. Also one last thing... at school... I feel like I'm always ignored... like I'm only your friend out of school... like I'm not kool enough to hang around with you or w/e. And then you are always with that Ricky guy and talk to him all the time. and also you like don't ever introduce me to any of your friends... so I feel left out. And well if you say that I'm ur best friend... that doesn't mean u totally diss them and not talk to them at school. I am a person Erik... and yes I do have feelings... and right now I just need a friend that won't ignore me and lie to me. So if you care or still want to be my friend... Call me or w/e tonight. If you don't... then I guess you don't want to then. Its up to you... but I hope you notice how I would do anything for u or 4 any of my friends... and I hope your not ganna take advantage of me.  You don't have to write back but you can if you want... idc. Well I g2g TTYL I guess...   And then last night we "talked" about it... but all he had to say was that its BS that he ignores me... when he does... but Holly told me its cuze he probably doesn't see or hang out with Ricky or anyone else... which I can kind of see... Because I do hang out with him a lot kind of... lol. Well I hope that's why... Because I don't want to be taken advantage of... Well I g2g TTYL  ~Matt

      Hey hey! Well... today... Erik's ganna come over at 3 or 4... then we are going to steph's house around 7ish... and stay around 9 or 10. fun fun I know! lol. But what's really bothering me right now is how he ignores me during school... but its not like all the time... but he has "other friends" so he doesn't need me I guess... but the next time he pisses me off... (I've been saying this for awhile) lol but I'm just ganna say f$#& it... I'm tired of getting into fights with you... and I can't be you friend. My friends don't think I can do that... and I probably can't... but I will... in an email at least. lol. He'll see how his life sucks with out me! HA! lol jp. Well anywho... That's really that's all on my mind right now... lol. So I'll TTYL!  ~Matt

      Hey hey! Whats up?!?! I know I haven't added to this blogger in like a really long time... But I'm ganna try once again. So anyways... yesterday I heard that my friend Erik gave about 10 girls beads if they showed him there boobs.... well I was like in shock just from that... lol. Then I heard that he has like phone sex or w/e with this Amanda girl. She is like really really ugly and just has big boobs... Which is why I think he talks to her sometimes. But he said that he never had phone sex with her... and he said she likes him... and he kindof likes her... but I don't know... But one thing I've learned is never get in the middle of a relationship... Especially if they are like your best friends or something. I also think that Erik doesn't really like me as a friend... more like a person who is just there to talk to or just to go over to my house or something... idk. Because sometimes at school... he like doesn't talk to me as much as some of his other guy friends... and sometimes even ignores me... and that makes me a little upset... not to sound like I like him or have feelings for him... hes just my friend... and when he said to me that I was his best guy friend... and he does that to me... I wonder if I can trust that anymore. I mean ok... I understand he doesn't want to be with me 24/7... but you know if you ignore someone at school sometimes... yet you hang out with him a lot like out of school... somethings wrong there. I don't know what it means. But all my friends mean a lot to me... and they are always there for me... Whenever I need it... and they are all to nice to me. Somedays... I wonder why do they all want to be my friend? I get mad over little things really easy... I get kindof.... "Emotional" lol... I am a dork... I make sometimes embarrassing things... like dance or w/e... I don't dress "cool"... I am sometimes annoying.... I means really... who would want to be my friend? It just really makes me wonder sometimes.... but I'm glad that my friends care about me... at least I hope. I wonder all the time... what would it be like without me? Like would they miss me if I was sick... or if I died. I also wonder... If I got in like a big car crash... and I would be in the hospital... who would be there for me... who would spend the night at my side just so that I won't be alone. Or at least come to say hi... wish me luck... and keep me company, and help me through this. I really do think in this saying I heard the other day... "A true friend brings out the best in me" and I really do think my friends bring out the best in me. They also help me throughout my bed times... and my good times. I don't know what I would do if I couldn't be there friends anymore. But I can't stand it when my friends don't trust me or lie to me... Because that makes me feel like I'm just here for laughs and to talk to them about there problems. And I really do feel bad if someone is mad at me... and if they are... I would feel bad the whole day... and try to do everything to work things out. But on my bad days... I wish sometimes that I had no friends... so that I wouldn't get in fights or get mad and stressed out about things... But that doesn't mean that I really want to... and everyone knows that I am too nice... and some try to take advantage of me... and that really takes the cake for me. lol. Well anyways... back to the Erik thing... I really hope what he said was true... I know I'm probably worrying to much about this... but I don't have to many guy friends... and I don't know.. I'm just worried that I'm here for now... but when he gets more friends... hes ganna leave me... and hang out with other people instead of me. That's why I worry sometimes... If I am really his friend or not... but I'm not like going crazy over it you know... and I know it sounds bad or gay or w/e... But I would be really hurt if he says somethin like that... then treats me like crap all of the sudden... and forgets me.Well anyways... I think that's all I have time for right now... i'll TTYL!  ~Matt

And everyone is gettin mad at me becouse I broke up with stephanie. And I feel like I really don't have any true friends at MHS right now... And no one wants me to be there. I don't know why but I really kindof want to go to another school to get away from all of this. It would make everyone else happy that I am out of their lifes. I don't know... I am going to wait a week to see what happens this week... Otherwise I'm going to MICDS. Well I'm going to go... I'll wright bmore later TTYL  ~Matt

      Hey! Well here's what's going on... today was the first day being back from Spring Break... and it was nice to get to see everyone. But aparentlty Erik wants to beat me up (bring it on! lol) but that's really stupid and gay... and he is on redline so he's all like no personality LOL its kindof funny. But he didn't talk to Nikki at all during choir... I don't know why... hmm. But Jen called me a "cycotic liar" lolol. Sorry but I think that is mean. She was giving me all this bull on how she doesn't even know me and doesn't want to judge me... and then she starts calling me a "cycotic liar" lol. Oh well... Well one of my best friends Julie is really sad now. Her boyfriend broke up with her... and she really likes him... and she's been cryin about it all the time... and I felt really sorry for her. She and Holly can't ever find the right guy to be with. Well speaking of break ups... I think I'm going to break up with her tonight. Steph... I love you to death but I just want to be single. Sorry... but I still hope we can be friends. I'm not ganna go out with anyone for awhile but I just need my space and time to myself. I think its my fault because I'm not ready for a relationship. I don't know... Well I'm ganna go think about things... I'll blog later! TTYL!  ~Matt

      Hey! haven't wrote in here in awhile... so I thought I might as well tonight. Well anyways... so tonight was ehh so so. First of all I'm not friends with Erik anymore... and I could care less if he wants to be friends with me... Because he's an ass and I don't like him anymore lol. Well anywho... Ryan came over for maybe an hour... it was ok... but then his cousin like called and said he needed to come out and see him... then Ryan was like it would only take an hour and I would be right back. I was like umm sure... Knowing you- you wouldn't. Because I don't know why but all my friends I know say that can do stuff or say somethin but they don't really mean they would do it. He also said he would call if he couldn't... well its 10:00 and he hasn't called yet. So oh well.... I have his wallet and hat anyways... lolol. He left it over here. He's ganna be comin over tomorrow for my birthday... but I don't think he is... Because he says stuff then 5 minutes later he would forget. If he doesn't ohhh boy... its ganna take a lot for me to forgive him. I mean that's really rude if he was to do somethin like that to me. Well we'll see what happends... but if he screws up my birthday... I'll be pissed for awhile... That's all I gatta say. Well anyways... Julie and Beffa (her bf) got in a fight this weekend... I felt soo sorry for her. She always finds the wrong guy... kindof like Holly... and I just wanna help them so bad but when I try... it seems to still go for the worse. But anyways... they got in a fight because Julies best friend (was) lol went over to his house without Julie knowning it... and I found out and told Julie. Well she thought it was like cheating... but I had alil 1 on 1 with this Beffa guy... and he seems to really like Julie and I'm happy for them two. They worked things out and he seems pretty nice. Hes like 16 and his parents just bought this restaurant up by uhaul and cleaners 21. Well I don't know why but I'm sad... :( Why can't things just go my way for once? Its supposed to be my week, my birthday, my only week where I don't have to worry about anything... but why do I feel like no one cares and everyone's gettin into fights with me and makin me sad. I just notice today how fast friendships and relationships can end... and at the littlest things too. It makes you wonder... Who is really my friend? What would they do for me? Are they using me? hmmm... I don't know why but if I consider them a best friend... I wish they would consider me one as well... I don't know why but that's probably why I get all stressed out about this stuff with my friends. I don't know... well I g2g... too tired. I'll blog more! lol TTYL  ~Matt

      Hey! I got accepted to Vianney! SCORE!!!! lol. But anywho- last night was really bad. Steph started talking to Nick Beffa. And it really pissed me off because I really don't want them talking to him because he will get mad at me or something- or he will become "in the group"- which by the way I am not in it anymore lol. But then Steph was like you can't control who I am talking to.... GRR! There is nothing worse that pissed me off than that. Ever since she started going out with Terry she has been acting like an ass to me. And then she is like I don't think we can be friends anymore. Well now after that... HELL NO! There is nothing that could piss me off more than that. I'm going to Vianney to get away from the group, but now that's not even possible. I am so tired of all this drama- and when I'm not friends with the group I don't have any really. But now... she is trying to ruin my life- and I hope she realizes how much she is hurting me. Well I'm gana go- TTYL!  ~Matt

      Hey! It's 5:46 in the morning... and yeah last night kind of pissed me off. Well you know how Ryan was supposed to call me back? Well it was like 10:45 (really late for him to be up lol) and I called him, and he said he was "just about to call me back" but he was on the phone with Andrea, which he just got back from her house. I'm just so tired of this BS I say F%$# it. Well I did text him and said call me before four today if you still want to be friends with me. I know its a little korney- but O well lol. But yeah, he says he is always busy to come over- but he has time to go and hang out with Andrea, Kyle, ect. And he never picks up the phone when I call, but he does when anyone else. Ok yeah what's up with that. GR this is pissin me off lol. Well I g2g get ready for school, I'll TTYL  ~Matt

      Hey! Well today was pretty good. Lets see... At around 10, I went up to MHS and worked the food court. I left around 2 or so. Then, Beffa came over and we walked to Julie's house. We snuck up on her and she was in her swimming suit lol. She sprayed the dog with the hose and I yell DOG ABUSER! lol it was soo funny. And he and Julie came over to my house. I had a really good time. I'm happy this weekend, I found some new friends lol. And so they all left and I walked Julie to her house. Then Ryan called me- and we talked maybe for like 5 min., and he said he'd promise to call me tonight. I'm not counting on it but oh well. But this Thursday I'm having another PARTY! lol yey! Hillary and everyone's ganna be there! I can't wait! lol Well I g2g finish my homework- I'll TTYL  ~Matt

      Hey! OMG that was the best party ever! lol Well this is what happened... First it was just me and Garret. Then Ashley came with two guys named Nick and Ryan. Nick was from CBC, and Ryans from VHS. They where pretty cool, but Ryan had to go early. Then, we fooled around some..... (look at the pics.. lol) and Nick Beffa came over and stayed for about an hour. Its like the first time I meet him, and hes pretty tight lol. Ryan didn't go but for some reason, I didn't want him too, and It was still a blast without him. I don't think I wanted him to go because I I'm pretty close to be over being his friend... and I don't want to get my hopes up again lol. I know that sounds weird... but oh well. I meet some new friends tonight- and they are pretty tight. I invited Nick to come over tomorrow- but I don't know if he actually will. He's only really meet me like once, but I do talk to him a lot online. But I am in a really good mood, because tonight was like the best day I've had since like November or something. Well I think I'm ganna go up to the YMCA or something tomorrow, then Nick might come over, and Sunday from 10-2 I have to go up at MHS and sell food and stuff up at the volleyball tournament. It's going to be awesome! No church lol. I know that sounds bad, but this is more exciting than church. It's for STUCO, and I haven't really done a lot this year, so I wanted to do something... so here I am lol. Well I'm going to go... I'll write more when I'm not as tired. TTYL!  ~Matt

      Hey Hey! It is 5:51 in the morning, about alil less than an hour before the bus comes! And Im bored... :( So yeah, this whole Ryan thing is really pissing me off, so If he doesn't come this Saturday or next weekend, I'm just ganna say screw it. I'm not ganna worry about it anymore because if he doesn't care about me- why should I care about him? But tomorrow- I'm gana be like yeah I'm having a party with Andrea (girl he's been hanging out with lately and I think likes lol) and see what he does... like if he calls or comes over. If he does, then I know he doesn't want to come over because I'm there- its because Andrea's there. Hmmm... Oh well lol. Anywho- I really don't want to go to school today. I don't know who I am going to go sit with anymore. Ashleys like mad at me, and so is Holly. I might just be a loser and go out in the commons by myself lol. I don't care- its better than sittin all by urself. Well I g2g get ready for school! TTYL!  ~Matt

      Hey! So, this is what is going on in my life. First of all, everyone is mad at me because apparently I "gossip" or "talk shit" about people. Ok well I don't and this whole thing is really stupid. I just say F&%$ it, I'm tired of these stupid fights, they are pointless. If they want to get mad at me then they don't have to be friends with me. Simple as that lol. Sorry I know I prolly sound like a big B&*#@ but I just want to get that across. Anywho, today I was a buddy for special Olympics, it was pretty fun! My buddy wasn't that hard to take care of, and he was pretty nice. He was a little to hyper, he kept running away from me lol. I feel sorry for Vicki's, her's got "sick" lol. Well back to the friend thing lol, I really don't think Ryan is friends with me, or has time to. He never does anything with me anymore, and he says hes too busy, well I guess he was to busy to go to andrias house or invite her over to his. And he lied to me saying he was to tired to do anything. I'm not like obsessed with him or anything... lol but I don't know, I just need a friend who wont get pissed off at me and will always be there for me. Well I invited him to come over Saturday- so we'll see then. And also I invited him to go down to the lake next weekend, but yeah fat chance that is going to happen... lol. I know something will come up or he will be too "tired" to come. That's how this guy is, he sleeps all the time! lol. Oh well, I gata go do homework :( so I'll write more later!

      Hey! This is my life in a nutshell... It sucks! lol. Well its been really bad lately... but I try to but on a happy face and act like its not bothering me or its not hurting me. But it is/does. Like this weekend Steph Holly Terry Nikki and Scott are all going out to places without me, and it makes me really depressed. Its like they forgot all about me and makes me feel like they don't need me and doesn't wanna be friends with me. Also I was ganna have a party this Saturday (today) but Steph didn't want to go... and then Holly says she "can't," but I know its because they are going to the movies or something. Its like I'm not in the group anymore. And on top of that, I haven't really hung out with Ryan since April 7, and its May 1. And I barely talk to him anymore because hes too busy with baseball, work, and school. The only time I get to talk to him anymore is like 10-15 minutes up on the balcony at school. But its like noone wants to be friends with me anymore. Noone has time to talk to me, to care, or hang out with me :(. I really do feel like shit right now and I just want this weekend to be over and done with. Its soo boring. I just wish I had a friend that I could hang out with and trust that he/she won't desert me, and be there for me when I'm down. Well I'm ganna go think some more... I will write more later on... TTYL!  ~Matt

      Hey! Well its been awhile since I last Bloged, so here I am! lol. 1st off... I'm done with school and I'm soo glad that I'm out of MHS (well still summer school but oh well). I'm looking forward to go to Vianney and I hope I pass summer school so that I can go there next year lol. Well the last few days where ok. In math, Leah Jenney and Lisa has been spreading these rumors about me admitting that I was gay... and I NEVER SAID THAT! Now everyone thinks I said that and its really pissing me off. But O well. This weekend was fun. Austin, Becca, Garrett, and Julie pretty much stayed the whole time at my house lol. And this Tuesday I am going up to Mehlville to pick up my grades then going to CBC to try to apply there. (I kind of hope I get in there- they got laptops and its a new building). But I don't know... Its going to be hard to decide. I probably won't get into CBC anyways with my grades. They take the top grades, not the average ones. Oh well... at least I will be going to Vianney if not CBC. Well I think I am going to talk to Steph tomorrow... which I haven't done in about 4 weeks. I think its stupid that we don't talk and we get into fights and stuff... so I'm going to give it one last try I guess. Well I g2g ttyl  ~Matt

      Hey! Well this week was ok. I had a few people over last night, long story short my friends are assholes lol. Lacey found out that Ryan and Nick hate me, and thinks I'm annoying or whatever. Well I don't care, I did nothing to them, and I've done a lot for Nick, like taking him to the 311 concert, giving him my old phone, ect. But really, he was kindof a dork lol. I don't care if they don't like me, they just won't be invited anytime soon to my house. I hate it when people use me for stuff. It really makes me wonder who I should trust or not. I'm really stressed out by selling this lake house, reading all those books for the summer reading thing, and starting school in about two weeks. I really only know maybe four people that go there, and so far they are nice... Well besides Nick lol. Well I'm sitting here on a Tuesday night, nothing to do, mad at my mom for something... and its hot in this room lol. Well I'm gana go write more later. TTYL  ~Matt

        hey! Well this is what's going on. Austin and Julie are going out... so I guess me attempts to get Eric and Julie didn't work. lol Oh well. I'm 100% for sure going to CBC now... It feels like its not true. lol but it is! Well everything is going really good in my life. No one is pissing me off or anything, that's always good. I got my new cell phone replacement after the other one died, and ordered a few CBC cloths n stuff lol. I'm getting my laptop this Monday! I can't wait! Then I have orientation on august 21 or something like that. Our closing day for the house is august 7... Can't wait! lol Well I'll add more later on, I'm really tired tonight.

      Hey! Well I'm going to finish what I was talking about earlier. Well really about the only thing that's pissing me off is how people are talking behind my back and making up shit. Like all these people are IMing me and is like so Matt what's up? I heard your gay... ok WTF? I'm not gay... and I never said I was. ** So let me clear that up. That's exactly why I'm going to CBC and getting away from Mehlville High School. There are so many assholes and I'm just so sick and tired of them. Well I think Jake and Hillary are in a big fight and I don't think they will go out again (hopefully) lol. I really hope that we can go out, and if not then oh well I guess, at least we'll be friends. Well this week I'm going to the lake! YEY! So I won't be back to write more till like Monday... Sorry kids! lol TTYL  ~Matt  **It was requested that this part be removed. Sorry about that guys, had some feelings that needed to be addressed. It's all fine and dandy now...I think. lol

      Hey! Well its been awhile since I updated this so I guess I need to lol. Well here's everything that's happening. I'm going 2 CBC next year, can't remember if I put that in last time or not lol. I pretty much for once is stress-free and we are selling our lake house Aug. Hillary actually unblocked me now lol (her and Jake are in a fight) so we talked and catched up. I meet this kool guy in my math class named Eric, he's kool. I'm trying to hook him and Julie together lol. He thinks Julie is really hot and funny, and Julie likes him too. So hopefully it'll work out or something lol. I got a new cell phone! I got a new cell phone! lol Also I started CBC's Summer conditioning thing, and I meet these two guys named Matt and Andrew, and I'm still looking for a GF! lol Well that's pretty much my life right now... TTYL  ~Matt
