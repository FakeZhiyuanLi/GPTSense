      It seems technology isn't really all that great to me. Sure it improves convenience and is nice to have around, but it seems lately I spend most of my time attempting to undue constant electronic mistakes. For instance, recently my computer has been acting odd. It seems that every time I try to single click something, it double clicks instead. That doesn't sound like a big deal, but it has made typing papers, sending emails, looking at porno, and playing solitare virtually impossible. I figured I probably had a computer virus as that seems to be the only thing I can rely on my computer to do effectively--harbor the internet's vast assortment of viruses in my make-shift electronic malware sanctuary. Let me tell you this thing has more worms than Jason Giambi's large instentine and is surrounded by more trojans than Helen of Troy. So I reinstalled all my Windows stuff (which, for those of you who haven't experienced this, deletes every file on your computer) only to find that I still have this clicking problem. Well, needless to say I feel kinda like Wile E. Coyote after accidentally blowing himself up for the 100th time and hearing "BEEP BEEP."

      Have any of you taken the time to browse some of the online profiles on here or the online dating sites?  It's like a freak parade out there.  By no means do I consider myself a pretty-boy, but I feel like Brad Pitt in a world of Erkels.  You'd think if you were an ugly person you would have the common sense to realize that you won't meet people online by posting multiple headshots exhibiting your freak-like features.  Let's not forget the reason you turned to the internet to meet your mate:  you're hideous to look at.  If women don't talk to you in person because you're ugly, what makes you think they'll talk to a picture of you?  Let internet anonymity work for you.

      For those of you who haven't watched the news today, the Department of Homeland Security has raised the terror alert level to Orange. In a typical knee-jerk reaction, the usual suspects have complained about the vagueness surrounding the threat and charge that political motivations actually prompted the change. What gets my goat is the fact that these same people complain that the administration does not do enough to inform the country about potential terrorist threats, but then lambaste the president whenever he attempts to do so.  Critics demean the color system by suggesting that it does little more than scare the American people. If you believe this, the only other option remaining is to have no system at all to notify the country of possible terrorist activity. Admittedly, I as an individual can do little on my own to deter a terrorist attack, but I would much rather know about potential threats than hear nothing but cold silence. I dislike the idea of the government withholding potentially life-saving information in order to appease the few who feel it might fail. Can you imagine for one second the political consequences if the government obtained credible information about a future attack on the country, but then decided not to inform the public? Heads would roll.

      I'm what you would call unemployed. Being as such has given me a lot a time to think about various subjects and one thing that I've realized is that I absolutely hate looking for a job almost as much as I hate working. One of the things that grates on my nerves is the unnecessary formalities placed on everything involving the search for employment. It seems employers enjoy making the qualifications for the open janitorial position at the waste water treatment plant sound as if it could only be filled by Stephen Hawking. It's no wonder everyone lies on their resume because it's the only way to get noticed in an age in which McDonalds recommends obtaining a Harvard MBA in order to operate the deep fat fryer.  To compliment these inflated standards are the lies we tell on the Resume itself. In fact, the only reliable piece of information on the Resume is the phone number. The objective statement? What's that supposed to tell an employer? Whose objective isn't "To make a lot of money doing very little." ? Is that an acceptable answer? Of course not. So you lie in your objective statement and phrase it so as to appear interested in the crappy job you're applying for. The remainder of the document simply attempts to make your breadth of cashier experience at the Cinnabon intimidate even the most qualified NASA scientists as you embellish every minute detail of your menial duties. The term "Cashier" becomes "Monetary Containment Supervisor" as your tasks change from "Mopped the floor" to "Sanitized the Culinary Support Facility." My question is this: what's all this supposed to prove? That you lie and exaggerate better than the competition? Perhaps I'm naive and just don't recognize how important those skills are in the real world.

      Here it goes. I think this first post should explain a little bit about myself--an introduction, if you will. My name's Josh. I enjoy playing guitar, reading, and taking long strolls along the beach. I'm slowly coming to the realization that I'm not nearly as cool as I used to be. The fact that I have started one of these web diaries only further demonstrates that I am indeed the least popular person I know.  That should be enough for today. I intend on updating this thing regularly, though I'm sure I won't. I don't have much in the way of persistence as I've often said the same thing about using a treadmill... writing a novel...and taking vitamin suppliments, but not much has come of those either.  I'll talk to y'all later. In the meantime, take it easy.

      I have taken it upon myself to compile a brief list of the best songs in the world that no one has ever heard. For whatever reason, these songs have been lost to humanity and we are no better off for it. So here it goes (in no particular order):  The Edgar Winter Group--"Dying to Live" Bob Dylan--"If you see her, Say Hello" The Kinks--"Strangers" The Beach Boys--"It's About Time" The Beach Boys--"Surf's Up" The Beatles--"Wait" The Beatles--"Oh Darling" The Refreshments--"Down Together" Charlie Rich--"Feel Like Goin' Home (demo)" The Clash--"Stay Free" Goldfinger--"Carlita" Mountain--"Nantucket Sleighride" The Smiths--"Work is a Four-Letter Word" Robert Earl Keen--"Feelin' Good Again" NOFX--"The Longest Line"

      Is it just me or did that Olympic Torch bear a striking resemblance to an Iraqi Scud Missle? For a brief moment I thought we'd finally found those elusive WMDs.  Did you hear that many Americans have urged our olympians to quell our victory celebrations so as not to inflame the rest of the world? Good idea. While we're at it, why don't we just suck at every event and give the rest of the world a chance to beat us? We have enough gold medals already.  Is anyone else depressed because of the start of the Olympic Games? This now means ESPN will have to devote time to these insufferable sports at the expense of the NFL pre-season coverage. Not only that, but it completely displaces the entire NBC Must-See TV line up. I can't live with that. I'm counting the days until this thing's over.

      Recent polling data suggests .3% of Americans unaware of Kerry service record.  Democrats blame failure to "get the message out."

      I find it unfortunate that I harbor such intense disdain for my own alma mater; however, the administration has made it extremely difficult to look fondly on the school despite my best efforts to like it. It seems the administration feels that it does the student body an enormous favor by merely doing its job. Even though I graduated over a year ago, I still dread having any periodic contact with the school because of this attitude and try to avoid it at all costs; however, just today I ventured back in order to obtain an official school transcript to include in a job application. What a chore that was.  I drove over to the school and spent the better part of 20 minutes searching for a parking spot as I found the entire campus under some form of construction and blocked from public use. I finally found a spot and made my way into the Office of Records and Registration. With no one in line (or even remotely in the area) I asked one of the ladies behind the counter if I could get a a copy of my transcript. "You need to fill out a request form," she responded. I found this odd as I have received transcripts in the past without ever completing any such forms, but I didn't argue and filled out the sheet. I handed her the completed paper and she told me that it will be ready tomorrow afternoon and returned to doing absolutely nothing. Apparently the school now charges $10 if you want the transcript the same day. That seems like a fair price for the 60 seconds of work it requires to type the student's name in the computer and press "print." I know this is all the task requires as I've stood and watched them do it. So now it appears I'll have to drive up there again tomorrow to get my transcript as the Administration doesn't deem it necessary to complete even the most modest of tasks in any reasonable time frame and run the risk of the students becoming accustomed to convienence. Thanks a lot Winthrop. I hope you don't expect any "gifts" from me.

      As it stands now, I don't have much money to my name and don't forsee this situation improving any time in the near future.  So with money troubles certainly on the way, I have taken a proactive approach to squeeze every speck of value from every dollar I spend.  I have thus compiled a helpful list of simple ways to save money around the house and thought I would share them with you.   1.  Eat everything in your house.  I find it amazing how much food accumulates in your cupboards and refridgerator without getting eaten.  Behind my breakfast cereals alone I found a collection of canned WWII surplus rations that I had completely forgotten about.  Even though I had planned on going to the grocery store today, I discovered that I can safely eat for another year solely on the food lying around the house.   2.  Flush the toilet sparingly. Not only will this save on your utility bills, but it also saves the environment.  Why waste water with every pee pee when you can let it sit until you have to drop a bomb?   3.  Use A/C in only one room of your house.  Why spend the money to cool your entire house when you can just move everything you need into one room?  Simply put the bed, computer, fridge, desk, chairs, T.V., microwave, clothes, washer and dryer into just one room of the house.  With this arrangement, you'd never have to leave.  4.  Wear your clothes until they make you nauseous.  Americans have more clothes than most people on the planet.  As a result, we wear them only once then unnecessarily waste money on washing them.  I've seen documentaries on T.V. where these tribes in South America wear the same loin cloths all their adult lives.  We could learn a lot from them.  In order to save money, simply wear your clothes repeatedly without washing.  This saves not only on electricity and water, but costly detergent as well.  I know what you're thinking, but my response would be 'So What?'  You're gonna stink.  It's not a big deal...just ask the French.   5.  Steal. Whenever you stop in a fast food restuarant, take everything you see.  I haven't bought ketchup, salt, or napkins since the spring of 1987.   6.  Bum Rides. It seems gasoline nowadays is worth its weight in gold.  The best way to reduce the amount of gasoline you consume is to fake car trouble and get your friends to drive you everywhere.  Better yet, buy one of those gas-electric hybrids so that your friends will be too embarassed to be seen in it.  After you offer to drive, they'd have no other choice but to take their car instead.

      On-Star has added new commercial radio advertisements which feature actual recordings of people using the On-Star system.  The commercials demonstrate the utility of the system in many typical emergency situations:  when the check engine light turns on while driving; when accidentally locking the keys in your car; and when a woman injures herself and others by driving her car through someone else's house.  I'm not making this up.  On the recording you hear a hysterical woman whose first response after driving her car into the house is calling On-Star for help because she hurt her leg.  The underlying message here:  women need On-Star because they can't drive.

      Where do I begin? For over a year now, construction crews have worked around the clock to construct an enormous Harris Teeter Shopping complex directly across the street scheduled to open in "Summer 2004." I have a feeling that date is fast approaching. How do I know this? Because only yesterday they gave juice to the vast expanse of parking lot lighting. When George H. Bush spoke of his "thousand points of light," I had no idea he was talking about the new Harris Teeter across the street. My life feels like that episode of  Seinfeld  where Kramer can't live in his apartment due to the neon red rays resonating from the sign of the recently built Kenny Rogers Roasters. I think I may take an idea from that show and hang a giant sign outside my house that reads "BAD GROCERY." Hopefully this will deter potential shoppers and drive them out of business...but in the worst case scenerio it might block some of the light if I hang it over the window.

      If you haven't seen this already, I highly recommend everyone watch the show "Travel Sick" on Comedy Central.  The premise of the show is this:  a smart-ass Brit travels to various countries and attempts to complete several unpleasant challenges so as to avoid an even worse punishment.   Such tasks have included:  *Drink a Bloody Mary at Dracula's castle made from own blood *Feed a gobstopper to a Great White Shark off the coast of S. Africa *Stuff an angry king cobra down underpants *Make out with the hairiest woman in all of Romania  Prime example of punishment for incompletion: Drink a pig testicle smoothie  I really think I've missed my calling.  I would love nothing more than travelling around the world making fun of different cultures.  It just doesn't get any better than that.
