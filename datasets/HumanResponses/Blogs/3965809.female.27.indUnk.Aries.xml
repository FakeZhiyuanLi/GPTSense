        You Might Be Canadian If...         You can repeat the entire Molson's Canadian 'The Rant'.   You know all the words to "If I had a million dollars" by The Barenaked Ladies, including the inter-stanza banter between Steven and Ed.   You dismiss all beers under 6% as "for children and the elderly."  You hum David Foster's '88 Calgary Olympics theme in the shower.&nbsp;   You know that the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) don't always look like that.   You make up patriotic lyrics to go along with David Foster's '88 Calgary Olympics theme.&nbsp;  You cried when Gus "drowned" on Road To Avonlea.&nbsp;   You remember when Alanis Morrissette was "Too Hot To Hold".  You think there isn't enough of Peter Gzowski to go around.&nbsp;   You think it's normal to have a grain elevator in your backyard.&nbsp;   You watch MuchMusic constantly, in the hopes of occasional fleeting glimpses of The Tragically Hip. &nbsp;  You have an Inuit carving by your bedside with the rationale, "what's good enough protection for the Prime Minister, is good enough for me!"&nbsp;   You can sing "O' Canada" in French and actually know what the words mean.    You send angry letters to the CBC demanding the return of the Hinterland Who's Who spots so you can finally find out what happens to the arctic ptarmigan in winter.   You participate in Participaction!   You think Peter Mansbridge is sexy.   You think Lloyd Robertson is sexy.  You think Peter Kent is sexy.&nbsp;   You think Matt Damon is so-so. &nbsp;  You stood in line for hours for Another Roadside Attraction tickets.&nbsp;  You killed your best friend for Another Roadside Attraction tickets.&nbsp;   You think Great Big Sea isn't Maritime-centric enough. &nbsp;  Your backpack has more than one Canadian flag iron-on (and you always have room for more).&nbsp;   You know the names of all the guys in Sloan. &nbsp;  You have been on Speaker's Corner. Bonus points if they edited out your carefully prepared rant against the Harris government.&nbsp;   You know the French equivalents of "free", "prize" and "no sugar added", thanks to your extensive education in bilingual cereal packaging. &nbsp;  You still haven't taken down your "NON" posters from the 95 Referendum.   You know more than 3 guys named Gordon. &nbsp;   You think Ashley MacIssac isn't Celtic enough. &nbsp;   You remember "Jodie" from Today's Special and wonder why you keep seeing her reading news on the CBC.&nbsp;  You can do the hand actions to Sharon, Lois and Bram's "Skin-a-marinki-dinki-do".&nbsp;   You know why "killerwhaletank" is funny.&nbsp;   You can eat more than one maple sugar candy without feeling nauseous.   You had a crush on Joey Jeremiah from Degrassi Junior High.   You know that a "Premier" isn't a baby born a few months early.   You actually watch The Gemini Awards, The Genie Awards, and The Juno Awards. You wonder why Stompin' Tom doesn't get his own category in all three. You scream passionately at the television when your favourite Canadian performers are overlooked by their respective academies.&nbsp;   You think -10 C is mild weather. &nbsp;  You have twins named Donovan and Bailey.  You have twins named Wayne and Gretzky (alternately Gordie and Howe).&nbsp;   You know the ingredients for poutine.&nbsp;   You know what happens in the Evergreen Forest when Bert Raccoon wakes up.&nbsp;  You dressed as Bruno Gerussi for Halloween. You spent hours sifting through garbage on the beach to prepare for the role.&nbsp;  You substitute beer for water when cooking.&nbsp;   You carry empty beer cans from your camping trips home with you in your backpack so you can recycle them when you reach civilization.&nbsp;  You know that the 'Extra Creamy' in Kraft Extra Creamy Dinner is 'add more milk.'   You prefer Elvis Stojko when he has 'hockey hair' - a.k.a. 'the mullet' or 'the shorty-longback'.&nbsp;  You brag about the sweet herb in BC.   You know the chorus of "The Log Driver's Waltz" and are particularly fond of the 'burling down and down' bit. &nbsp;  You steal stationery from your Government of Canada co-operative education placement because you figure you can find lots of uses for paper with 'Human Resources Development Canada/DÃ©veloppement des Ressources Humaines Canada' written at the top.  You have daydreams that film-maker Don McKellar, and Hugh Dillon from The Headstones, skinned and ate Regis Philbin.   You recognize: CPP, RSP, and CCM. &nbsp;  You know what "Canuba" is. You think it's pretty damn funny.  Your gravy boat is shaped like the Bluenose.  You refuse to consume chocolate that doesn't come in either Smarties, Coffee Crisp, or Laura Secord format.  You die a little inside if you can't get your Tim's double-double every morning.&nbsp;   You know the difference between real snow and "television" snow -- the white stuff that passes for snow on tv and in films. You scream, "For Christsake! That should be sticking to their pants!" and "Lookit, it's not melting! That's *so* not snow!" when watching 'Winter' scenes.    Someone accidently stepped on your foot. You apologize.&nbsp;   You stepped on someone's foot. You apologize, then apologize for making them apologize.&nbsp;   You know Casey and Finnegan are NOT a Celtic rock band or imported beer.&nbsp;   You know who Foster Hewitt is.&nbsp;  You can spot MEC from a kilometre away, even if the little white tag is hidden.  You're either out to bingo or getting stinko (and you think no more of Inco) on a Sudbury Saturday night.  You've actually said, "Stay where yer at, 'till I gets where yer to."   You pity people who haven't tasted a "beavertail".    Complete the phrase: "The good old ____ game is the best ____ you can ____."    You've got some rocks and you've got to leave an important message -- Lucky you know how to build an innukshuk!   You have at least one ROOTS sweatshirt that always smells like cigarettes and beer.   You find it difficult to explain "milk in a bag" to non-Canadians, and even more difficult to describe the "snippy-thing" used on bag corners. (Bonus points if your collected snippy-things are stuck to your fridge.)    You're pretty sure you can see Alex Trebek smirking when Jeopardy contestants get the "Canada questions" wrong. Even if you weren't sure of the answer yourself, you consider yourself a hundred times smarter than the idiots who always guess, "What is .. uh, Toronto?"   Your Saturday nights in the Atlantic provinces include eating beans and brown bread as you watch Hockey Night in Canada.  You know that the Canadian Alliance is just the Reform Party with better hair.  You know that, contrary to general belief, the Inuit have about the same amount of words for snow as do English speakers. Your favourite Inuit word for 'snow' is "navcaq" (snow formation about to collapse).   Your local zoo is mainly flamingoes, giraffes and sad elephants freezing their asses off against a backdrop of pine trees, grey skies, and precambrian shield formations.    You wonder why squirrels and seagulls somehow manage to get in every zoo exhibit (including the parking lot and squirrel and seagull exhibits).   You live in a "beach town" and have to eat your brothers and sisters to stay alive during the winter months.  You wonder why Esther Canadas has been blessed with both beauty and the coolest name on the planet -- although Canuck cutie Shalom Harlow could wipe the floor with her.  You're such a hardcore Canadian punk you used ketchup-flavoured potato chip 'residue' to dye your hair. You know it's kind of gross, but at least you smell good.  You don't consider a date truly romantic until you've slow danced to Blue Rodeo's "Five Days in May". You accept "Lost Together" as a second option.   You're not offended by the term "HOMO MILK"  You understand the phrase "Could you pass me a serviette, I just dropped my poutine, on the chesterfield."  You eat chocolate bars, not candy bars.    You drink Pop, not Soda.   You only know three spices: Salt, pepper and ketchup   You know that a Mickey and 24's mean, "party at the camp, eh!!!"    You don't care about the fuss with Cuba. It's a cheap place to go for your holidays (not vacation), with good cigars and no Americans.    You know that a pike is a type of fish, not part of a highway  You drive on a highway, not a freeway  You have Canadian Tire money in your kitchen drawers.  You know that Casey and Finnegan were not part of a Celtic musical group.   You cried when you heard that "Mr Dress Up" died recently.  You get excited whenever an American television show mentions  You brag to Americans: Shania Twain, Jim Carrey, Celine Dion & more, are Canadians.  You know that the C.E.O. of American Airlines is a Canadian!   You know what a toque is.    You design your Halloween costume to fit over a snowsuit.  You know that the last letter of the English alphabet is always pronounced "Zed"   You live in a house with no front step, but the door is one meter up from the ground.  Your local newspaper covers the national news on 2 pages, but requires 6 pages for hockey.   You know that the four seasons means: winter, still winter, almost winter, and road work/construction.  You know that when it's 25 degrees outside, it's a warm day.  You understand the Labatt Blue commercials.    You know how to pronounce and spell "Saskatchewan"   You perk up when you hear the theme song from "Hockey Night in Canada."   You are in grade 12, not the 12th grade.    "Eh?" is a very important part of your vocabulary, and is more polite than, "Huh?"    You call it a BUN not a "Roll"  Its called a WASHROOM not a lavatory or powder room or rest room.   You've ever had your tongue frozen to something.  You know that in Canada the mosquitoes have landing lights  You have more miles on your snow blower than your car.  You have 10 favorite recipes for moose meat.  You know that Canadian Tire on any Saturday is busier than the toy stores before Christmas.  You've taken your kids trick-or-treating in a blizzard.   Driving is better in the winter because the potholes are filled in with snow.   You owe more money on your snowmobile than on your car.  At least twice a year, the kitchen doubles a meat processing plant.  The most effective mosquito repellent is a shotgun.  Your snow blower gets stuck on the roof.  You think the start of deer season is a national holiday.  You head south to go to your cottage.  You frequently clean grease off your barbeque so the bears won't prowl on your deck.   You know which leaves make for good toilet paper.   The major parish fund-raiser isn't bingo, it's sausage making.  You find -40C a little chilly.   The trunk of your car doubles as a freezer.   You attend a formal in your best clothes, your finest jeweler and your Sorrels.  You can play road hockey on skates.  The municipality buys a Zamboni before a bus.&nbsp;     You may be a little too Canadian if...         You wonder why there isn't a 5 dollar coin, as you can only use more change.  You spend hours in the dark making scale models of the Avro Arrow and cursing the Diefenbaker government.&nbsp;   You have memorized the Heritage Foundation's Heritage Moments, including your favourites, "Burnt Toast!", "You know I canna read a word...",  "One day we have tar paper roof!" and "Kanata".   You advocate the abolition of responsible government in favour of monarchist rule.&nbsp;  You think there isn't enough Queen on our currency.  Your graduation formal dress was made of flannel.  You use a red pen on your non-Canadian textbooks and fill in the missing 'u's from labor, honor, and color.   You are excited whenever an American television show mentions Canada. You make a mental note to talk about it at work the next day.&nbsp;  You automatically read 'Z' as 'Zed' and don't give a damn that it doesn't rhyme with "now I know my abcs".   You are moved to tears by those Bell Canada phone commercials they show around Remembrance Day, where the grandson calls his granddad from Dieppe. You understand the manipulative nature of the advertisement, but continue to be moved, nonetheless.&nbsp;  You stay up until midnight (the end of some television station broadcasting hours) to hear the Canadian national anthem.&nbsp;  You get up at 5:00 am (the beginning of broadcasting hours) to hear the Canadian national anthem.&nbsp;  You spit angrily when Americans say "ruff" instead of the correct "roof".  When abroad, you have a cold fear that somebody might mistake you for an American. You make a point of deliberately being kind to locals just to make it clear you are a Canadian.     You are too Canadian if...     You've ever said, 'I need more flannel clothing.'  You understand everything in this list, and email it to all your friends.   You read rather than scanned this list.       I had a dream once in which I was fighting over the last muffin at a coffee bar with CBC news anchor Ian Hanomansing.&nbsp; Which is in itself a plotline from Ken Finkleman's  Newsroom  series.&nbsp; Most Canadian content of any dream I've ever had, I think.&nbsp; Amusing.

       I managed to do the first 6 items on yesterday's list, yesterday.&nbsp; And I  almost  made art.&nbsp; Something got in my way.  Today I'm up to #6 already - but I haven't done #5 yet.&nbsp; I have social engagements planned for later on in the day but I still think I can get to the gym, and sketch.  Only spending 3 hours on the internet is hard, also.&nbsp; I'm going to have to be strict.  Well.  Some other things that need doing - the sooner the better - are as follows:   &nbsp;   Apply for interest relief before the student loan bastards get on my ass.   Pay my school fines - library debts and missed appointment fees.   Get a work-study job.   Start looking for a more permanent job.   Get art ready for group show.   Start looking for places to sell my art - try contacting at least one exhibition space per week.      Tangible goal-setting is in order.&nbsp; It's lame, but I know myself well enough to know that I have to be strict.&nbsp; I also know that this is going to require a lot of courage.&nbsp; Somehow though, this time I feel like I have it, and that I can deal with this huge block of unstructured time and make the most of it, and not worry about becoming hopelessly lost.&nbsp; I feel like I have the capacity to earn money, and that my skills are worth something.&nbsp; In short&nbsp;-&nbsp;I'm not depressed anymore.&nbsp;   &nbsp;

      I need structure in my life.&nbsp; Of course I'm driven to do the things I love, and I love to make art - write, paint, make clothes, write songs - whatever it is I'm doing at that moment.&nbsp; But there's also the  fear  and the  self-doubt , and sometimes these win and the next thing I know I stop making art and&nbsp;I'm&nbsp;very depressed and I don't want to get out of bed.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is pretty much my first day&nbsp;without obligations so the time to set up a structure is  now .&nbsp; I'm out of school and already I'm seeing black hole where I should be seeing vista, so that has to change.&nbsp; So here are a list of things&nbsp;I'm going to make sure to do every day.&nbsp; Maybe I&nbsp;won't do all of them every day, but at least some of these things.&nbsp; Every day.     Leave the house .&nbsp; Where I go is not important.&nbsp; Just physically exit the&nbsp;apartment.   Shower .&nbsp; Sounds obvious now but it could be a good measure of whether or not&nbsp;I'm becoming depressed.&nbsp;    Change clothes. &nbsp; Same as above.   Write something .&nbsp; This journal will suffice for now but I&nbsp;want to move into creative writing soon.   Go to the gym .&nbsp; Go every day -&nbsp;I have lots of time.&nbsp; Even if I'm just going for a yoga class or something.   Eat good food .&nbsp; Either something that requires preparation or something that is really healthy, like&nbsp;fresh fruit or whole-grain cereal.   Look for a job in Toronto .&nbsp; Look every day.&nbsp; And  apply  for jobs in&nbsp;Toronto.&nbsp; At least one resume a day.   Physically make a piece of art .&nbsp; Even just one - but every day.   Play guitar .&nbsp; Or bass.&nbsp; I don't have to write anything - no pressure.&nbsp; Just play.   Read something .&nbsp; Every day.&nbsp; Try to learn something.&nbsp; Then write a short response piece.&nbsp; Maybe I should start yet another blog for this purpose.   Limit time spent online  to -  here's where I cringe  - &nbsp;3 hours (for now) otherwise none of these other things will get done.&nbsp;&nbsp;    Wish me luck.

       And anyone that was reading it up to this point will probably change their minds about that now.&nbsp; Because I know you don't care and you don't want to hear about it.&nbsp;    Seriously - what is the point of this? &nbsp;   Anyway, in reverse order:    31)&nbsp; 50 Mission Cap (Live)  -Think about Robin Williams when he was still a coked-out, foul-mouthed stand up comic with a full beard and bad clothes.&nbsp;  Eww .&nbsp; Also -&nbsp;bad audio and video quality on this thing.&nbsp;    30)&nbsp; Grace, Too   -  Distracting, ambient layers of images.&nbsp; Meh.   29)&nbsp; Last American Exit -   Hi, we're a rock band on the road in the late 80's.&nbsp; We're checking into a nice hotel looking like a bunch of dirtbag musicians&nbsp;(with sunglasses and hangovers),&nbsp;hamming it up for the camera on our tour bus, etc .&nbsp; Lame.   28)&nbsp; New Orleans is Sinking -  Too much random hobo watching television, not enough Gord.&nbsp; And where there  is  Gord,&nbsp;there is&nbsp;also bad hair.&nbsp;  No deal .   27)&nbsp; It's a Good Life if You Don't Weaken (Live) &nbsp; -  Decent performance of a good song.&nbsp; The crowd is too heavily miked.&nbsp; But basically it's boring and it doesn't need a visual component   26)&nbsp; Little Bones &nbsp; -  Who are these actors and why do I care about them? - is that Noah Mintz?&nbsp; The live sequences are nice even if my enjoyment of them is dampened by  Gord's bad hair .&nbsp; And what's with that milk bath?   25)&nbsp; Vaccination Scar   -  I really like this video  despite the complete lack of Gord content .&nbsp; It's a nice animated film.&nbsp; But I like the song a lot, so that might be all it is.   24)&nbsp; Blow at High Dough &nbsp; -  You know I really like this song but it's beside the point.&nbsp; I hate that jacket.&nbsp; And I  hate  that hair.&nbsp;  A lot .&nbsp; I like stock footage, but I don't  love  it.&nbsp; So I'm ranking this video accordingly.   23)&nbsp; Grace, Too (Edenfest '96)   -  Bad:&nbsp; Way&nbsp;too dark.&nbsp; Better:&nbsp; Gord, in a Don Cherry-esque jacket, introducing himself as Pierre Elliot Trudeau.   22)&nbsp; Nautical Disaster -  Pretty boring in an artsy kind of way.&nbsp; Probably the same director as  Ahead by a Century ,  Gift Shop , etc.    21)&nbsp; Ahead by a Century   -  Hey, there's that Don Cherry jacket again.&nbsp; This video is 60% narrative, 40% Gord's disembodied head.&nbsp; Basically it's pretty boring.   20)&nbsp; Poets (NYE '99) -  It's ok - I have issues with the suit, because it's too big, and - yeah, that's my biggest complaint:&nbsp; Big Suit.   19)&nbsp; Nautical Disaster (SNL) -  This is a weirdly restrained and slightly uncomfortable looking performance.&nbsp; I'm pretty indifferent.   18)&nbsp; Gift Shop   -  Black and white and boring and artsy.&nbsp; Gord is  astonishingly skinny .&nbsp; But he's dressed like a mountie  can I be the mounteur? , on horseback, grinning like an idiot and saluting the camera, so that wins.&nbsp;&nbsp;   17)&nbsp; Grace, Too (SNL) -  Bonus points for dancing like Ian Curtis.&nbsp;  Same dorky haircut, too .&nbsp;    16)&nbsp; Smalltown Bringdown -  I know this is a shitty video, and it probably cost very little to make.&nbsp; But this time the random crap they've inserted into the video meshes well with the song - all these very  Canadian looking &nbsp;images of people and locations.&nbsp; I won't complain about Gord's bad hair because at least now it's wetted down with either water or sweat, and it looks better.    15)&nbsp; Twist My Arm &nbsp; -  I mostly like this video because it's funny.&nbsp; Gord introduces the song with all the charisma of a dock-worker with a 3rd grade education.&nbsp; [Insert catty comment about Queens here] .&nbsp; But wait - he's cut his hair and although he's&nbsp;still&nbsp;wearing bad clothes,  they fit now,  so&nbsp;bonus points&nbsp;to Gord's ass in those&nbsp;jeans.&nbsp;   14)&nbsp; Grace, Too (Woodstock '99) &nbsp; - &nbsp; Not as good as the Woodstock performance of Poets, but I'm only basing this on the fact that Gord's wearing a suit jacket through most of it.&nbsp; And he needs to shave.&nbsp; But his ranting is fantastic,&nbsp;which makes up for a lot of that.&nbsp; He tells the audience he feels  Woodstock-errific  and makes use of the word  furtive .    13)&nbsp; Little Bones (Centennial Hall '98) -   Here  is a man who seems tired of singing his best known song -  all right fuck it, if I have to sing it again I'm going to sing it like  this.&nbsp; I like this video because it was filmed down the street from my old apartment.&nbsp; Not a huge fan of the hair but I  am  a fan of the soaking-wet dress shirt.    12)&nbsp; Poets   -&nbsp; &nbsp; The antics are fantastic.&nbsp; The video is compelling.&nbsp; I see it's point.&nbsp; But it's not blowing my mind.&nbsp; Big fan of the shirt though&nbsp;- hey, it's the Woodstock shirt again! - 'cause tight dress shirts on skinny dudes  rule .   11)&nbsp; Courage &nbsp; -   Best hair, ever .&nbsp; Seriously.&nbsp; If he's going to have hair,  this  is what he should be doing&nbsp;with it.&nbsp; I guess that's becoming a moot point these days, but still.&nbsp; This even makes up for the fact that he's wearing an enormous tent of a sweater - possibly a handmade Boston Bruins sweater - but I don't give a fuck about hockey, so I can't be sure.&nbsp;  So  cute, anyway. &nbsp;    10)&nbsp; At the Hundredth Meridian   -  First, notice that Gord is wearing a mesh back trucker hat and is dressed like a neo-grunge hipster fuck barfly - but remember that at the time this video was filmed that&nbsp;look was still fiercely lame.&nbsp;  Looks so contemporary .&nbsp;  Huh .&nbsp; This man can wear a hat, that's for sure - and I  hate  trucker hats.&nbsp; He looks  really freakin' good .&nbsp; *shrug*    9)&nbsp; Locked in the Trunk of&nbsp;a Car   -  I liked this video better when I thought&nbsp;it was Gord with his hands tied in the trunk of that car, but it's still good.&nbsp;&nbsp;Who looks that good in a ratty mock turtleneck?&nbsp;  No one.&nbsp; That's who. &nbsp; I would totally kidnap this guy. &nbsp;     8)&nbsp; Darkest One   -  Would I&nbsp;still love this video if the Trailer&nbsp;Park Boys weren't in it?&nbsp; Maybe.&nbsp; Probably not as much.&nbsp; "How much chicken?"&nbsp; " One bucket "&nbsp; "One bucket?&nbsp; Are you fucked in the head?"&nbsp; Ahaha.&nbsp;&nbsp;Gord, unshaven and dressed like that dude from the Beachcombers, is constantly drinking and smoking throughout the duration of the video.&nbsp;  Amusing .    7)&nbsp; Fire in The Hole -   Shit &nbsp; he looks hot when he's talking about art .&nbsp;   6)&nbsp; Poets (Woodstock '99) -   Hey - &nbsp; topless girls !&nbsp; Broadcast on television!&nbsp; Canada  rules .&nbsp;&nbsp;I love the hell out of Gord's outfit - this short sleeved green shirt and tie - like a Boy Scout.&nbsp; I also really&nbsp; really  - love the hell out of his dancing.&nbsp;    5)&nbsp; Thugs   -   Mmm, cowboy.&nbsp;  That's seriously hot shit.&nbsp; But those glasses have got to go.&nbsp; Something about issuing vague threats to lackeys is also fairly hot.&nbsp; I don't know why, it just is.   4)&nbsp; Bobcaygeon -  Two words:&nbsp;  riot gear .&nbsp;   3)&nbsp; Something On &nbsp; -   Oh hell yeah. &nbsp; Gord Downie is a sexy, sexy bastard.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm sorry, he&nbsp;just is.&nbsp; Bonus points for dancing like&nbsp;Morrissey.    2)&nbsp; Music @ Work  &nbsp;-  At &nbsp; the risk of sounding redundant, this guy is just really, really hot . &nbsp; His bald head  rocks , that tie  rocks , the tight short-sleeve dress shirt  rocks , and his dancing/flailing rocks  hardcore .&nbsp; Or am I just insane?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    1)&nbsp; Silver Jet -   Dude .&nbsp; First of all, this man is sexy as fuck.&nbsp; Secondly that girl, whoever she is, is&nbsp;very sexy also.&nbsp; On top of that this song is just really sexy -&nbsp;and he's using words like  archipelago  and making &nbsp; reference to classic cinema.&nbsp;  Mmmm.&nbsp; Brains. &nbsp; So&nbsp;I think  this  video is the best thing I've seen, for sure.&nbsp;       &nbsp;  Yeah, so, I think it's time to do  anything else  now.&nbsp; Long summer ahead of me.&nbsp; Y'know what I mean?

      I have mixed feelings about this class ending.&nbsp; It ends tomorrow, and I have much work to do.&nbsp; I'm worried, of course, but on the other hand I completed 4 essays in one evening last semester - including research - plus one or 2 major assignments in the same week that I'd been entirely putting off, and I passed all of these courses, so I know I can do this thing.&nbsp; University is easy and I can get away with doing very, very little work if I choose to.&nbsp; Sad but true.&nbsp; But anyway, here are  10 reasons I'm happy this course is ending tomorrow :     The course is a total pain in the ass, it's at night, it's boring, etc.

      Here's what I've decided:   In lieu of  anything to do  I am going to spend 4 hours a day working on art, and 4 hours on business, i.e. looking for work and promoting my art.  Bearing in mind what Doug Coupland said about writing fiction -  go easy on yourself until you're 28 or 29, and then if you're serious, attack it like a pitbull.  I think Mr. Coupland is fantastic, so I really can't argue with that. So. I'm going to the library and I will return with:    A hand-outable CV  A current resume  A list of 15 cool-seeming publishers  A list of 15 artist-run centres   It's almost noon and I should have left the apartment by now but I had a lenghty shower and I'm waiting for my tea to cool. Excuses, excuses.  This past week I've felt like a glider plane bumping along the ground so I'm going to write the words  escape velocity  on a rubber band and wear it on my wrist until I get back on track.

      No, not really. I was gonna make another To Do List but instead I should probably see how my other lists are coming along:     Every Day      Leave the house.   Uh,  yeah .  So far so good.         Shower.   Yup.          Change clothes.   Uh huh.         Write something.   Well,  this .  I could probably write somthing better.         Go to the gym.   I've  been  there, but not every day.      Eat good food.   Yea.  But also bad food.        Look for a job in Toronto.   Looking, but not applying yet.  And I'm starting to lose my nerve.      Make a piece of art.   Not every day.  I resolve to make this my top priority.         Play guitar.   Not at all.  But I think about it a lot.        Read something.   Two paragraphs at a time in the bathroom doesn't really cut it.         Limit time spent online.   Uh... maybe this is the problem.           The Other Stuff      Apply for interest relief before the student loan bastards get on my ass.   Oh  shit .     Pay my school fines - library debts and missed appointment fees.   Yes!  I did this .      Get a work-study job.   Nope.  Too late.       Start looking for a more permanent job.   Sort of looking.         Get art ready for group show.   I'm either gonna have to hassle that guy or set up my own show.  What's his deal?  Why did he go out of his way to give me his email address if he's not gonna email me back?  What's wrong w/people?  Write me back, fucker!  (As Sleater-Kinney say).     Start looking for places to sell my art - try contacting at least one exhibition space per week.   I've been bad.    So:    In light of discussions I've had with my art professor I need to contact publishers and galleries to get my work out there.  Specifically my independant project.  So I need to   Contact galleries  Contact publishers  Figure out how to put a book proposal together  Figure out how to put a gallery proposal together  Figure out how to get a grant to fund gallery work  Find a job that won't break my heart  Find my confidance again so I can do well in a job interview  Get interest relief for my student loan.   Shit, is that  all ?  Does anybody want to be my mentor?  Seriously.  I am so fucking lost right now.

      I am so, incredibly fucking, unspeakably, pissed off with my brother that I'm going to complain about him in  both  of my blogs.  (Eh, 2 out of 3).  Because he sucks  ass  and the next time he's in the province I don't even wanna  see  him.  He won't turn up for 5 years and by that time I'll be represented in the National Gallery's permanent collection and I will be being interviewed regularly by the CBC while he continues to wonder what all the fuss is about since the arts don't matter and any idiot (except him) could succeed in the field.  In any case I suspect he is jealous because he is:  fat bald old  and let's face it,  stupid.  Because if you can't do better than 71% on a creative writing exercise  and  you hold a grudge over it for 30+ years, you've gotta know you're stupid.  And that stupidity has to eat away at you undermining your whole sense of self and overshadowing all your accomplishments.   It's stupid to be mad at art.  It's stupid to take it out on other people.  It's stupid to dismiss anything beyond your understanding as unimportant.   Really  stupid.  No?
