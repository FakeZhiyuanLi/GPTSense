      well. there we were. it was a warm summer morning. i think its summer now. ok, totally not the point. so i was going through pompano beach to my dad's body shop. my tire had been flat and was at the time temporarily fixed. so me and nick (my brother) are like 3 blks. away from the shop, when...  :jackass: hi, my name is Hugh Jackass, and i want to run a stop sign today! Hey there's Lane! I'll ruin his car for him!  :lane: NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!  so i swerved to miss Mr. Jackass and at the same time, theres an oncoming Jeep. So i swerved even farther to the left, and go through a hillbillies yard, shearing a 15 ft. ficus that bashed the car at the time of shearing.   well theres me and nick, in some guys yard, car bashed, coulda been hurt, and the hillbilly comes out and says..."Ya'll gon havta pay fer my tree." *bashes head on rock*

      Something new for me to waste time on endlessly into the night!  Is it wrong that i'm watching Heavyweights and laughing at the fat kids? Brings to mind a story when my middle school almost sent us on a field trip to Disney World...during gay Disney days...  Car is dead. *weeps* But dad is puttin' a funky ass speakerbox in da back though, and painting a pinstripe over the red. Ima hav da ghetto ass car and be king o' da hood!...Wait...yeah...i'm still white lane.
