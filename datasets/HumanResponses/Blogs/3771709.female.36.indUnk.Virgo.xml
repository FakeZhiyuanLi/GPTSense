      Nothing much today. Took Fritze (the dog) for a check up. Went to  find this wonderful green house that I have heard about. Finally found it , and it was closed. Only open from 8am to 12pm. Question, when do they expet normal working people to be able to get there at that time?? Yes, I was lucky that I had the day off. But , really , those hours suck !!!  So, I came home and looked though a new cook book . For something new for my shows.

       I love having Pampered Chef parties and meeting new people while teaching new and interesting tips.    Does anyone else, have or has to endure the pain and hardship of Fibromyaliga ?? Sometimes it is so hard to keep up the happy face. You just want to lash out at everything and everyone. And , of course , you end up feeling guilty for that also.    But, the thing that eats at me the most , is  the people that act like they know what you are going threw . And later on, you hear something like," Oh, it can't really be so hard. You just have to manage things better." Ahhh!   Well, thank you everyone for letting me vent.                    Piper

       One would think , That when you are a family you would be able to feel comfortable around ones  relatives. &nbsp; Feel  free to be your self .  Not having to worry about about what you said and if it was taken the right way , not miss understood.     &nbsp;   What is happening with our world ?? Family is becoming a thing of the past. You just don't see family's getting together and really enjoying one another anymore. What has happened?? You don't see family's getting together with everyone. Grandparents And uncles, you know the works and having a great time. Is it gone forever??

      Ever feel like your life is stuck on slow motion??  While this sucks and is going on....  Have you noticed that you couldn't find someone , to listen to you, and really listen to you if your life depends on it??  You could tell them that you discovered that you found a hidden vault of gold in your basement.. And, they would still look at you like you had a bugger hanging out of your nose!!!!!      IT SUCKS!! THERE IS NO OTHER WAY TO SAY IT,,, SUCKS!!      But , they could be talking about finding a new way to clean grout..  And wouldn't you know.... It is suddenly the most interesting thing ever heard!!!    SUCKS!!!!!!
