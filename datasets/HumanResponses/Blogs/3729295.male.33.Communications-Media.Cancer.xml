						   On the evening of June 21, 1971, a 19-year-old unmarried college student gave birth to a healthy boy at Hillcrest Baptist Hospital in Waco. The child weighed 6 pounds, 2 ounces. On June 23, the girl officially gave up the newborn for adoption. She declined a copy of the adoption petition. The court records were sealed. Recently, it was determined that she has never attempted to locate her child through the adoption registry administered by the state. Whether she is aware that this option exists cannot be verified.  * * *  That is how my “story” officially began. The headlines in The Waco News-Tribune on June 21, 1971, weren't all that wasn’t all that different from those of current times. Big state budget cuts were in the works, and Gov. Preston Smith was denying that his personal financial dealings had included wrongdoing. Elsewhere, President Lyndon B. Johnson was speaking out against The New York Times for its publication of the so-called Pentagon Papers. On the gently rolling plains of Central Texas, the weather was oppressively hot. Like today, there was a chance for afternoon summer storms, a potentially violent price to pay for the relief of cooler temperatures. Sports fans were awaiting the outcome of a Monday playoff round between golfers Lee Trevino and Jack Nicklaus to decide the U.S. Open. Overseas, Wimbledon was set to kick off on the famous grass tennis courts in London. In Waco, that Monday marked the possible beginning of a string of lives: Without my birth, my children could not follow, and neither could subsequent generations. But that Monday also represented a potentially tragic end, because a young mother was on the verge of giving up her firstborn, and the cradle in which the infant dropped threatened to break a bough cleanly off the woman’s family tree. My birthday, like most birthdays, served as catalyst for influence – both positive and negative – on a number of people so large that to fathom it is difficult, to measure it impossible. This all started at 7:41 p.m. that day. It was over in a flash, yet it continues now.  * * *  When my parents went to pick me up eight days later, Mom was amazed at the tiny infant with all the dark hair. She had expected a heavier, bald baby. To her, I looked like a papoose. One time Mom told me that lunch that day, June 29, 1971, was the first time she saw my dad cry, although they had been married several years. Mom and Dad eventually adopted another baby boy, and then a baby girl. They thought this concluded the construction of their brood. To their surprise, they later conceived a child of their own, an event that doctors had told them would likely never happen.  * * *  I was 22 when my dad died, but I thought of him again yesterday. He never got to meet my wife or hold my children, but they will benefit from his having lived and loved, for his conduct is something I will always strive to match. He was the truest gentleman I have ever known. And though I have miles to go before I’ll be anything like him – as a husband, as a father and even as a person – the gift of his example is something I now value more than all the combined presents of my birthdays past, present and future. On this day, one that may be painful to a certain woman out there somewhere, I pledge to try harder to be the man my father was. This will be my gift to her for making the brave and morally correct decision that allowed me to know him in the first place.

						   In his new book “A Hole in Texas,” Pulitzer Prize-winning author Herman Wouk picks up a fictional storyline that, not to give the ending away, has implications for the defunct Superconducting Super Collider project.  The main character – a highly respected fictional physicist named Guy Carpenter who oversaw the super-cooled magnets that were key to the collider’s functionality – gets pulled into a national crisis that arises when it’s announced that the Chinese have discovered a fundamental law of the universe called the Higgs boson.  Along the way, he deals with the near breakup of his marriage, the resurfacing of a college girlfriend – the Chinese scientist who discovered the Higgs boson – a haggling Washington investigative reporter, and a host of political manipulation and maneuverings. Plenty of alcohol gets poured and consumed as the story progresses.  At one point, Carpenter and a congresswoman from California – a former movie starlet who took her husband’s seat when he died in an accident, no less – make a visit to Waxahachie. Wouk’s descriptions of the local landscape are somewhat demeaning throughout the book, and the author hints that Waxahachie lived and died with the SSC.  “I never thought I’d see Waxahachie ever again,” Carpenter tells the congresswoman on the plane en route to Dallas, “except in my bad dreams, yet in an hour or two I’ll really be back in that Texas purgatory.”  A few moments later in the conversation, the physicist remarks that Waxahachie “was a five-year pain in the ass.” Though the book mentions no place names, the pair books rooms overnight at what could be the Rogers Hotel – though it’s described as musty and gloomy. The morning wakeup call comes from a girl who says, “Six-thirty, suh, foggy morning, you-all have a nice day.”  The judge who gives the pair a tour of the SSC site is stereotyped right down to the string tie.  Aside from Wouk’s pokes at the local settings – at one point, Carpenter describes Ellis County as a “godforsaken plain” south of Dallas – the book tries to answer the question of what killed the collider project and what the consequences might be for the United States.  When the pair finishes their stay in Waxahachie and heads back to the airport, the sun, perhaps symbolically, breaks through the clouds.  The Higgs boson so valued in the book supposedly answers the question of what actually gives particles their mass. Put another way, it is the force of energy compressed by the speed of light squared.  If the local reader can forgive Wouk for his digs at Waxahachie, he or she might find the book enjoyable in that it creates dreamy optimism that the abandoned tunnel under parts of the county might not be for naught.  Wouk wrote the Pulitzer Prize-winning “The Caine Mutiny,” as well as “Marjorie Morningstar,” “The Winds of War” and “War and Remembrance.”  “A Hole in Texas” is published by Little, Brown and Co., and the hardback sells for $25 at bookstores.
