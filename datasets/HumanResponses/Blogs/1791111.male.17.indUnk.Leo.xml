      You're AMAZING! I know that I tell you this alot but every time I tell you it I wonder if you really know what I mean by it. I wonder if you know that I mean that EVERYTHING about you is completely AMAZING.  Your attitude..I love the way that you look at things and how you're so upfront about practically everything. You care about my well being and what I do (like the accident report thing). I love that. I know that sometimes I can be irritated by it. But I know that you only do it because you care about me so much.  The way you look at me...wow. Every time I think about you I picture you in my head. How when you think something is amazingly funny you laugh out loud and then look at me your mouth is open completely and your eyes are all smiling too and you're just completely...happy. And the way you look at me and don't think I know that your completely staring at me. Although I don't know why you stare at me and I don't always know what your looks mean..I simply love the way that you look at me. And when you stare at me and for some reason you just look amazed. I'm not sure what that's about but that look is normally followed by you telling me that I'm beautiful or that you love me. Which I definately love.  Your body is awesome. I love everything about it. I don't think you EVER need to change. You have perfect abs. I love your chest and your arms. Your back is amazingly sexy and tanned. Your calves, and legs. I love your neck. And your ears. Your hair, wow, I love your hair regardless of how it's styled or how long or short it is, you always look good to me. Your lips. Their perfect and inticing and teasing. I love how badly I want to kiss them every time I look at them. Your nose, it's the perfect size and it's fun to kiss, hehe. YOUR EYES.. I love them. Everything from your eyebrows to your eyelashes. And their a perfect almost olive green w/ a brown sunflower around the pupil and depending on the light little flecks of yellow. They're beautiful and I love them just like I love you.  There's alot of other things about you that are amazing but this is a public forum..lol. NEWays..in case you haven't figured it out. I LOVE YOU, and I can't believe that I have you. I feel so lucky...every day. I want to keep you as long as I can. I hope you're having a good day at work baby. I love you. O, btw, next time you see me..you owe me a matt kiss

       it's labor day weekend.  finally a three day weekend away from school and all the hell that accompanies it.  friday was our first football game against frisco.  we won.  i was quite astonished, cause we usually suck ass no matter what.  the band did alright.  there was a small tear, but it's fixable.  saturday was the relax day.  take a nap and what not.  today we had a block party even though it rained.  we just moved it inside.  had fun there.  got a little drinky drinky.  so it's all good really.  that's about it for now.  have that stupid parade in the morning.  BLEH!!!  at least this is that last year i'll ever have to march in that parade or anyother parade again.

       the dreaded school schedual.  it finally got fixed.  man, my counsuler is a big moron.  after i have my entire figured out, and i'm spelling it out for her, she's like, idk if that'll work.  and i'm like, lady, it works, now put it in the computer and let me get the f*** outta here.  such fools they are.  school's starting to pick up.  one thing i can't understand though, is how u can think your friend appreciates your help and then gets annoyed when you try to find out what's wrong so you can try to help them.  the things i do for people.  what am i supposed to do, just go on like it's all my fault that i'm trying to be a friend?  i'm so unappriciated.  the things i do for people.  sometimes i question how much of a friend some people are to me, and if me caring about them and how they feel is really worth my time.  maybe this is the year that all my friendships are tried, and the ones that are true friendships stay, and the ones that aren't, go.  i'd like to keep all my friends, but apparently i don't get a say in that with some people.  on other news, i slammed my left thumb in a car door saturday night in the albertson's parking lot after going to hooter's and the movies to see S.W.A.T., which is a good movie if u ask me.  hurt for over four hours, and then all the blood got trapped in it and it swelled up and started to hurt even more.  so last night, i went and spent some time in the hospital so that the built up blood could be drained out of it.  i went in there dreading seeing a drill bit get shoved into my nail, but to my relief, that didn't happen.  instead they just burned three small holes in my fingernail and let the blood drain out.  it really hurt, but it was less pain than before.  so that's a good thing.  but i'm still mad.  mad mad mad.

       ah yes, school is sadly into the third day, which means that the daily grind of hell begins.  my schedual hasn't been changed yet, and if it's not done by friday, i'm raising hell.  anywho, for reasons that will stay unknown to most of u, a very big burden has been lifted off my shoulders.  i feel relieved so to speak.  also, one would think that at least one person in all of lakeview would really catch my eye and make me wanna be like, "hey baby, how u doin?"  but no.  there's a few that spell out possibilities, but for the most part, no.  but there's always other schools.  who knows, it's still early on in the year.

       the dreaded first day of school has arrived.  one would think that after three years with no problems, that the fourth would be the same, right?  WRONG!!!  i arrived at school today, after my car dying on chaha, and then rowlett road, and finding that my schedual is the biggest mess i've ever seen.  it is as follows: A1 - honors band, this is correct; A2 - calculus, this is correct; A3 - english v, this is correct; A4 - Economics regulars, WRONG!!!  i signed up for AP Economics, not regulars with a bunch of people who think it's funny to press a friggin' button on a remote control.  please God get me the hell out of there and into the AP class.  let's review the b-day schedual.  B1 - honors band, this is correct; B2 - intro to business, WRONG!!!  i didn't even sign up for this class, so where the hell did it come from? A3 - webmastering, this is correct, but in the wrong friggin' period.  it should be at and earlier period, say... B2, that way i can be in what i chose, which was revolution aide; B4 - MOJO, this is correct.  man i was so mad when i saw my schedual.  fools.  fools i tell u.  FOOLS!!!

       so today was the last real day of summer for those of us in the garland/rowlett area.  wasn't to bad of a way to send it out.  had the end of the summer burrito bash at chipotle with kevin, lee, steven, roy, and matt.  also had the first lesson of the year with kevin.  i'll enjoy learning from him.  lots of stuff's gone on over the summer.  what will probably be my final year of drum corps has passed.  i feel i've accomplished what i've set out to do.  plus i just didn't want to be there for most of the summer cause my head dm was a prick, but i won't go into that.  came back to what's turning out to be a great band program with the new director, mr. miller.  he's always asking me how our progress is and if he's doing the right thing and what not, and as far as i can see, he's doing a supurb job.  i'm finally a senior.  thank god.  that means i'll finally be done with public school after this.  then it's on to college, where the state doesn't pay for my school, i pay for it myself.  what an upgrade.  now i become even poorer.  an upside is that my birthday's in two days.  yes, i'll finally be 17, which means i can go to the window to buy rated r movie tickets instead of using the credit card machine.  although, when u really think about it, the line for the credit card machine's a lot shorter than the line for the ticket window.

       i don't know about a lot of y'all, but i had a great weekend.  why you may ask?  because literally all weekend, i saw my girlfriend.  friday, she went to the game, and watched me conduct and then stayed with me until she had to go home, and then on saturday, i did what no one had ever done before.  i took her out to eat.  that's surprising.  then we went back to my place and watched identity.  not a bad movie.  angie (my g/f) figured out the movie before it was five minutes into it.  then, on sunday, she came over and we watched basic.  then 40 days and 40 nights, and then the football game.  which ok, cause i was with her.  saturday was state taping.  i basically crapped all over my etudes but i had the best improve ever.  overall, not a bad weekend.  not a bad weekend at all.

       yet again, another update from hell.  what makes hell so fun?  is it the sitting in class listening to teachers drone on and on about things that i chose not to study or just don't care about?  is it the lunches i eat while my girlfriend runs around on a two hour lunch break eating sonic and whatever else she feels is necessary?  is it the freedom i get to be able to walk out to my car after passing numerous tests to make sure i'm not going to leave while again, my girlfriend leaves on her two hour lunch break and goes to the mall and her house?  what about waking up early to go listen to those that drone on endlessly?  here it is ladies and gentlemen, hell unleashed.  funny how it's only here that hell seems to manifest itself.  hell: where you're not allowed to walk around without an id and a planner signed while the random person on the street that went here two years ago can walk in and visit teachers without so much as an inquistion as to who they are and what they want.  and once i escape hell for the day, i only move on to the senic portion of my residency.  welcome to marching band.  where you can get away with a lot and expect little in the way of thought.  state taping is coming up.  OH SHIT!!!  the improve for region is really kicking my ass.  it's really hard to find things that work and won't kill me.  luckly kevin is having another jam session for those that need the practice, and i have a lesson on top of that.  maybe i'll learn something from it.  i have found a replacement for rat boy.  for those of you that don't know who rat boy was, he was this little dude that played saxophone, looked like a rat, and danced around when he played.  we used to sit there and make fun of him all the time, but somehow he still managed to make region when he really REALLY didn't deserve it.  out new replacement is much suckier and looks even funnier.  his name:  porcupine boy.  yes. porcupine boy.  the man who can crap all over himself on the etudes, then get up for improve over so what and make the most annoying sound ever created by man on a saxophone, and then walk away thinking he made it because he was as he put it, "the shit."  the only thing was that he was really full of shit.  instead of making it, where did he end up?  number 10 out of 14.  what a dousch.  oh well, there's always next year porcupine boy.   closing in on marching band for the day...  yay, more whiny people who think it's too hot outside and they need to go in or that we're actually good when given the chance as a judge, i would rip us apart and put us in the bowels of a vicious planet eating space monster.  don't get me wrong, we don't totally suck, but we haven't really progressed as far to get what we want.  we're complacent, and that's killing us.  but what can u do other than take your foot, shine it up real nice, turn it sideways, and stick it up, their candyasses.   with no hard feelings,  bloodstain bartholomew

       today was so great.  i get up today earlier than usual to travel to rowlett to audition for all region jazz for the last time in my high school career.  i get in there, pretty confident that i'll place at the top of the pack.  little did i know, that this year was my year.  yes, that's right, i, matt deSaracho, senior drum major of the lakeview band and four year member of jazz band, made second alto.  *applause*  i was totally stoked about it and couldn't believe it.  i had to keep checking to make sure it was right and i wasn't hallucenating.  then, the day just got better.  saw my senior pictures, and man don't i look good.  then, me, lee, angie, and one of her friends went to chipotle and the movies.  ended up seeing underworld.  it's a really cool movie, but it could be so much better if we weren't in the very first friggin' row.  anywho, i had fun and ended the night having a possible g/f.  over all, one kick ass day.    *correction: i did get a g/f out of the night*

       my weekend was actually ok.  it kinda started thursday when we beat molina 72-0.  since we're now 3-0, it draws the question of whether we're really good, or the teams we've been playing just suck.  i guess we'll find out when we start district.  friday, i had a lesson with kevin followed by a wonderous drive out to the local hot spot, chipotle.  would have gone out with angie, but no such luck there b/c my modern piece of machinery(phone) decided to not recieve a signal all night.  oh well.  saturday, i went and bought new speakers for my car, and then stayed up on the phone with angie until four in the morning.  that's a good thing though, cause that means we can hold a conversation.  sunday was just a lazy day.  talked to angie just about all day.  we actually suckered lee into accompanying angie's friend on our date saturday night so that he friend wouldn't feel like a third wheel.  so that's my weekend in a nut shell.

       yes, i'm runnin' with the devil, are you?  one of my friends, demon lee is his chosen pronoun of identification, runs with the devil.  of course i'm just talking nonsense here.  met this really awesome girl that goes to poteet, and luckly, i'm not in the friend zone, unlike my friend demon lee, who runs with the devil, who sadly suffers from that zone of shame for those who are just to nice.  oh how i hate the friends zone.  how i've been put into that shameful zone so many times.  it's hard to claw your way out of that hellish zone.  few have accomplished that death defying task.   i've just found out from a fellow blogger,  urlLink  kevin, that my pirate name is bloodstain bartholomew.

       i'm getting sick.  BLEH!!!  standing out in the rain for that blasted parade gave me a cold.  i hate it.  i feel like crap.  anyone wanna make me some soup?  no?  well poo on u.  i think my fingernail is about to fall off.  yes, that means i'll have a newer, better fingernail grow back.  then i can stop listening to people complain about how gross it is.  if u don't like the way it looks, then don't look at it.  i mean really, be a genius and think for a second.  what's the one way to not get grossed out by it?  oh yeah, DON'T LOOK AT IT!!!  oh how people in school annoy me.  ever get those freshman that think they're the shit?  now by all means, i'm not the tallest of the bunch, but there's people shorter than jasmine that think they can push me around.  WRONG!!!  the next fish that tries to shove me out of the way gets wall checked.  i don't care anymore.  i stopped caring about school a long time ago.  senioritis has really taken hold of me, and it's only the third week of school.  oh how this is going to be a long year.  the only thing i'm hoping for right now is a date for homecoming, and then, after that, legacy, and then prom.  that's all i care about.  it's senior year, it'd be nice to go to every dance, even though i did it last year.    later.

       i've decided that i'm going to post a bit of me every once in a while so that you, the people, can get to know me just a little bit better.  some of these stories may be useless, but hey, this is the nonsense of matt, so a lot of it is nonsensical.    my first summer of drum corps had an extremely memorible event happen in the middle of the summer that i'm sure i'll never forget.  while at Northern Illinois University, or NIU, for the Midwest Championships, we had an incident that put us on ESPN and the front page of about ten major newspapers and tv news stations.  while practicing in the massive Huskie Stadium, which we had paid for by the way, the NIU football team, now know as morons, took it upon themselves to practice during our practice time.  clearly this posed a problem.  well, while our assistant director and the head moron dueled over who should be practicing at the time, we, the corps, continued our rehearsal as if nothing was happening.  little did we know that the head moron had a dirty dirty trick up his sleeve.  after he found himself losing his duel with the heroic assistant director, he decided to have his moronic minions do his dirty work for him.    so here i am, at age 14, innocent and full of life, playing the opener in my first summer of drum corps in what was at the time, the biggest damn stadium i'd ever been in, and all of a sudden, as i played my last note of the piece, a huge blur flies by me and i see three of my comrades go down and not get up.  what is this?  what the hell is going on?  i turn to see three more men, at least three times the size of me now, flying my way.  what do i do?  do i freeze and pray that they don't hit me?   HELL NO!!!   i moved my ass out of the way as fast as i could with everyone else and ran full bore for the sideline where i was safe and surrounded by people as big as them.   here's the run down of what the head moron did.  after losing the battle, he decided to press the nuclear bomb button.  he walked his head moronic self back to his moronic minions and said, "ok boys, lets run wind sprints through them."  and of course, his minions complied and thus the blurs of people bigger than me appeared.  in the end his minions broke a bari players leg and fractured someone's jaw, along with twisting a guard girl's knee.  it was safe to say that the head moron and most of his minions were arrested and charged with assualt.    after this episode, we were told not to talk to any reporters, which later swarmed around us the entire time we were there and when we went back for a division two/three event, and we made a lot of news.    that's the story of the moron and the corps boys and girls.  shockingly scary.  well, not anymore, but it was at the time.

       as i sit here at my computer, i comptemplate where my life is heading, and i feel good about what i have chosen.  as many of you know, i once wanted to be an aeronautical engineer.  well that idea got flushed down the crapper.  what idea do i have now?  what could possibly hold my interest for the rest of my life?  what genius has hit me?  why none other than music.  yes, that's right ladies and gentlemen.  music.  i will become a music major and do great things as a poor soul trying to make it in this world.  times may be hard, but i can deal with it.  i'm totally stoked about it, and so is kevin.  i think he was wanting this to happen from the start and i also believe he has great things planned out for me.    today i practiced literally all day.  oh how i'm feeling it now at 10:12.  i played during first period, practiced during second, played during third and fourth, and then came home and added anothing hour and a half on to that.  you would think, oh my god, why practice so much after not practicing at all?  well, most wasn't by choice.  i also have a nice open sore on my lower lip.  that would be the lip that touches the reed.  so on a few of my reeds, there's some nice blood stains.  so in a way, i actually am, bloodstain bartholomew.  laugh if you get that.    so that's my career choice.  i'm thinking UNT, Loyola, maybe Northwestern, OU, and Florida State.  let me know what you think.  later.  matt

       u know, i try not to rant a lot b/c it's just not my style.  but there are those times when it's just unavoidable.  well this is one of those times.  the other day i hear a rumor that is blasphimous(that's totally spelled wrong) of angie and myself.  what made me madder than hell was that kiddy pool was one of the people spreading it.  now, i thought kiddy pool was one of my friends.  an especially good one at that.  good friends tell you degrading things that are being said about you right?   WRONG!!!   apparently kiddy pool finds it easier to tell others than one of her best friends.  kiddy pool made a big mistake.  kiddy pool pissed me off.  kiddy pool has their head shoved really far up their ass.  kiddy pool is obsessed with their significant other.  consult my good friend  urlLink johnny's blog  for more information on kiddy pool's stupidity.  i could rant, but i'd only repeat johnny.    i hate stupidity!!!!  later.  p.s. - i know i left a lot out.  that's cause i'm lazy and when i'm mad i skip over words that i find usless.  all that matters is that i know what i'm talking about.

UIL was last night.  we ended up with two's.  i know that it might seem like i don't care and that i'm just glad to be done, but last night was kind of a let down for me.  a part of me got left out there.  maybe it was the fact that it was the last time i'll ever perform for a UIL show as a competitor.  maybe it was the fact that i put it all out there, and i couldn't change anything.  who knows?  i don't even know.  what i do know is that i'm not the end of an era, i'm the beginning of a dynasty.  mr. miller said it right when he said that we (the seniors) were the beginning of something good, and as much as we want to say that we're done, it kind of makes me mad that through out high school i've had three different head directors and that my last year one shows up that really makes us good.  the fact that i won't get to be a part of this band when they go to state.  and yes, if mr. miller stays around, they'll go to state.  i can already see that.  but enough sentimental crap.  i'm done.  free.  i get my life back.  yay!!!

       well, it's been a while since i've updated here.  yes i know, you've all missed me terribly, but never fear.  i have returned.  yes, marching season is almost over.  as i sit here in webmastering counting the minutes until the final competition, the joy of being free forever rises up inside of me.  just think, i'll get my life back.  and this time it won't leave when the summer comes.  oh no, i'll be the bum that has a job and still lives at home over the summer.  yes, i hold the power now.  MUAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!   right, right.  so last week i heard the tape from plano east on my conducting skills.  or lack there of according to the judge.  i'm past it though.  i know that dumb bitch is a moron, and thanks to the Poteet band director, she knows it too.  apparently the judge asked the guy how she did as a drum major judge, and he told her that she did a crappy job.  when asked how that was possible, how did he reply?  that she had placed the number ONE drum major in the area two away from last place.  what was her response to her obvious stupidity being called out?  he spread his fingers twice.  what did the director do after that?  he exploded in a fit of rage and tore her helpless body limb from limb and dragged her to the firery depths of hell where she now resides in a painful and torturous ball of flame.  not really, but i wish that's what had happened.  instead he told her that spreading my fingers didn't matter and that i was just that good.  just think.  me.  best in the area.  i feel good now.  i also hold way more respect for the director over at Poteet, where, coincidentally enough, my girlfriend goes.  not that she's in the band or anything, but that there's that connection over there.  the rest of the week was uneventful.  wasn't any real action until the weekend.  yes, that's right people, it's homecoming.  the time when everyone busts out the dresses and suits and football rules all.  but what happened at the game?  we beat south.  that's right.  finally, my senior year, we beat south.  finally.    saturday was the dance. i had great fun at the dance.  went and picked up angie around 6 or 6:15.  don't really know, but who has time to keep track of time anyways?  well, angie looked good and we had a fun time.  what was the theme you might ask?  that 70's dance.  i kid not.  what moron in their right mind would pick the 70's for a high school dance?  the sad truth was that:  1)people actually tried to dress up in 70's colothing and achieved nothing but looking stupid and like their normal selves because they have no mind about them except the one that they share communitivly. 2)they played music from the 80's and 90's.  last i checked, those years were later than the 70's.   after that lee, holly, johnny, daniela, steven, william, taylor, shuli, adam, amanda, angie, and me all went to outback off of 190.  but what did i do on the way there?  what could i, the greatest driver in the world contrary to what lee says have done on my way to outback?  i missed the exit and didn't realize it until the toll booth.  but where exactly is the toll booth on 190?  down by 75.  yes, i went all the way to 75 before i realized that i had missed the exit.  but where is the exit?  well, that was all the way back by where 190 started.  yes, i went that far before i realized it.  you're probably laughing at me right now.  yes i can hear it.  well shut it.  no no.  don't argue, just shut it.  after outback, angie and me went back to steven's house and made an appearance and then i took her home and went back to steven's house where i spent the rest of the night.    on sunday i left steven's house and went back to my house where upon arrival i find that my family is about to go eat and run some errands.  i quickly jump in the shower and leave with them.  but what did i get that day?  what could i have possibly bought that could make me jump for joy in a fit of happiness?  why non other than the Matrix Reloaded.  yes, that great great movie.  and then what did i do?  i watched it with angie.  yes that's right.  i spent more time with my girlfriend.  how can i do this some people may ask?  how do i not get sick of her?  well, here's my answer to all of you.  she just makes me that happy.    so that was homecoming weekend in a quick shot.    later.

       for a while lately, i've had the feeling that i'm getting sick.  well, today at about 6:15 this morning, it was confirmed.  i woke up and it felt like the devil went out a bought the biggest steam roller he could find and ran it over my head about a million times.  i trudged around getting ready for the day with a splitting headach and about every joint in my body full of pain.  then, when i arrived at hell this morning, the first thing steven and lee say is that i look sick.  so it's obviously that noticible.  that the two laziest guys can notice sickness.  when i rolled into my chair during economics, the last thing i wanted was to take any test on anything.  what happens?  we take a reading quiz that the coach decided not to tell us about last class period.  guess what i made on it in my sickly stupor.  a 30!!!  a freaking 30 because our coach was too stupid to tell us about it before hand.  then, i go to calculus and take a two question quiz.  no matter what, if i miss one, i'm screwed!!!  however, i did get to take a nap in there.  when i woke up i found a small pool of drool that my conducting counterpart jasmine could have swam in. (please note that jasmine is considerably shorter than me and that i only drool when i'm sick.)  english held no better days.  first off, it's so cold, that when people walk by, a woosh of cold air follows and sucks away what life is left.  then, because i feel like hell and it's cold, i get yelled at because i'm slumped over in my chair and wrapped up in my jacket trying to take a nap.  and now, here i sit in webmastering, updating for your enjoyment even though i could be drooling all over my computer and taking a blissful nap.  but no, i'm here typing this.  can you say dedication?  from hell (and no, not in a handbasket), the sick matt

       ah yes, another four day weekend has come and gone.  i only wish that there were more of these.  shall we begin with friday.  i think so.  not like you people have a choice in the matter anyways cause it's my blog.  friday, i enjoyed an evening with angie yet again.  we met lee, steven, johnny, and kevin at chipotle in mesquite.  it's just not the same without the round table.  the only round table in the place has no booth around it and was taken up by those who were not worth of such a prized possesion.  after that, went to the poteet homecoming game and saw poteet's band, they're good like usual.  saturday was the first marching competition of the year.  oh the stress that can accompany these days.  the first run through of the day was total crap, thus setting the tone for what seemed like a very carefree and usless rehearsal.  all of this on top of people being their usual stupid selves and forgetting black socks or some other small thing that their insignificant brains couldn't think about and remember even though they wear them every game.  why are some people stupid?  can someone please tell me?  thankfully, enough people were able to turn it on and we ended up having a half decent show.  still got a two overall, but that's ok.  it just means that we'll work that much harder to get a one at uil and do good at plano east.  the highlight of the entire competition was that non other than your's truely recieved the best drum major award.  that's right people, i was better than all those other people.  (you can tell i got a huge ego boost out of this) that felt good.  damn good.  so i gloat and what not and come to what was going to be the true highlight of my night.  seeing angie.  but did i have permission?  no.  my dad thought that since she had made a commitment to go with someone else since i had to be at the competition, that she had to finish out the night without me.  what she didn't tell me until after i had been rufused to go save her was that the dude never showed up.  well that kinda made me mad at the dude for basically standing her up.  now, did my dad telling me no keep me from going and saving her?  HELL NO!!!!  told a little white lie and went to get her.  got to see her in her homecoming dress, which i'll see again when she goes to lakeview's homecoming.  so that ended up being a fun night.  sunday, what did i do?  go out with angie again.  we saw the school of rock, which was quite funny.  actually one of the better jack black movies.  then ate at fuddruckers off of 75.  then went back to her house and did what?  watch another movie.  monday, same thing without the movie theaters.  tuesday held a change from the weekend though.  enjoyed a region burrito from kevin for making region.  that was going to be the day that i attempted the 2BC.  (consult  urlLink kevin's blog  for more details.)  i quickly thought better when i remebered that we had a three hour rehearsal block in about an hour.  oh band, how you torment me so.  three hours of hell.  but such is the life of me.  thus my weekend with few details.  wouldn't want you to know me too well.

       i figure it's time for a real update.  so let's start from the beginnning.   FRIDAY   two months with angie.  this is a momentous occasion for me cause it's been a while to have made two months with someone.  to celebrate the occasion we decided to recreate our first date without lee and her friend tagging along.  not to say i didn't have fun the first time, but i mean come on, it's just better when it's the two of you.  we went to chipotle and sat at the table that we sat at that first night back on September 20, and then saw a movie and finally went bowling.  yes, we changed some stuff, but i don't really care.     SATURDAY   saturday was a lazy day until i picked up angie and we went to the CCCC Jazz concert to watch kevin, lee, and dingus play.  you can read detailed reviews in kevin's blog and dingus' blog.(i'll add the links later)     SUNDAY   sunday i went shopping with my mom.  basically we shopped for my sister's birthday that's coming up on December 4.  she'll be 5.  yes, there's a huge age difference with me and my sister.     MONDAY   back to hell for two days before thanksgiving break.     TUESDAY   early release from hell at 12:30.  thank god.  and no homework to boot.  after hell let out me, lee, dingus, kevin, and demon matt all went to chipotle.  angie met me there because he dad had gotten her out early too.  so we all ate there.  angie's parents showed up and lee decided that it would be fun to potentially screw me by yelling out false accusitions within ear shot of her parents.  thankfully they didn't listen.  after that i had to change one of the tires on my car.  went flat.  so i sat outside in the Chipotle parking lot and did that.  after that me and angie went and saw love actually.  not a bad movie.  kinda confusing cause there's like five different story lines going on a once.  but not too bad.  when my night was done i went home and packed for my trip to New Orleans for thanksgiving with my grandparents.     WEDNESDAY   what a trip.  woke up and left for New Orleans around nine.  come twelve, i wanted to drive.  so i did.  a little side story is that my mom doesn't like me drive with everyone in the car.  so she really didn't like me drive almost the rest of the way to New Orleans.  ok, back to this story.  so i sit down in the driver's seat and start the monotonous drive there.  man was it boring.  my but went numb so many times.  but i got to listen to music, unlike lee's first long drive where he wasn't allowed to listen to music.  HAHA!  get here about 5:30 and go eat at Brunings.  good seafood.  then it was relax time.     THURSDAY   HAPPY THANKSGIVING!!!  yes, today is thanksgiving.  give thanks that you're all alive and not dead yet, but remember those that are.  that's about it for today.    later.  demon halfling

       this morning i wake up and felt the cold.  this is the first time since it's gotten cold that i've felt it in my room.  it's never cold in my room because i don't turn on the fan unless i'm practicing because i sometimes sweat when i play.  yes, i know that's odd, but i don't care what you think now do i?  but like i was saying, it was cold.  i was scared to get up and go take a shower because the cold might come and take my life.  plus i don't like being blinded by the lights that early in the morning anyways.  well, i rolled out of bed because lord knows if i'm late for school i'll feel the wrath.  and it won't be His.  so i roll out of bed and a sudden pain grabs my body.  you see, the cold was trying to take my life from me.  at this point, the demon emerged from inside me and was suddenly enveloped in a ball of raging fire  the demon's knife-like claws emerged from their sheaths and slashed through the air, killing the cold in one fell swoop.  the demon quickly fled the room after ripping through the cold like a blazing knife through warm butter and ran for the shower where the cold could not combat the protection of the warm water that cleansed the demon's soul of his killings from the night before.  on the way, the demon was assailled by his parents as to how he slept.  the demon answered in a roar of rage from the one victim that he had spared.  the demon knew that the victim had sent the cold for him.  tonight, the victim will not live to see the next day.  oh no.  the demon could already taste the victim's blood on his fingers.  the demon could feel his claws ripping through the victim's flesh, taking revenge on him for sending something as weak as the cold to kill him.  don't they know, even the cold is not strong enough to take on the demon.  even if he is only a halfling.    as the water ran over the demon, he slowly turned back into his human form.  when dressed, the human form walked out and went to hell.    nothing can contain the demon halfling.    later.  demon halfling

        DAMN MY LUCK AND HOW SHITTY IT IS!!!   well.  my day was going ok.  calculus was over my head like usual and i was wanting to go home and my only savior was that i would get a break during lunch.  but did i? DID I?!?!?!?!?!  HELL FUCKING NO!!!   as i'm walking out of lunch to head back to class, this dude gets sick and throws up.   ON ME!!!   stupid son of a bitch.  thankfully i at least had my jacket on.  so it didn't get on my clothes.  but it did get all over the back of my jacket, which at this moment is sitting in the uniform room with at least two feet on either side of it as not to contaminate that room anymore.    now, i tried to keep a level head about it, but my day was already kinda crappy from the previous day and again, i just got caught at the wrong time.  so what did i do when i realized that someone had thrown up on me?  i let out a great big  G** D*** IT!!!   it really does take a lot for me to say this even though i do cuss quite freely as you've no doubt noticed.    now i gotta go to the cleaners and pay to get it all cleaned up and sterile again.  that oughtta cost my a kidney.  oh well.  later.  demon halfling

       what a day indeed.  started out ok, but went to shit quicker than i would have expected.    the morning was your typical morning.  wake up.  go to hell.  but, today was kind of special.  the Garland Symphony Orchestra came to school to play for a bunch of elementary school kids and i got to go to a luncheon for the Garland Rotary Club to be honored for some reason or another.  we'll start with the Symphony and move on from there.  The Garland Symphony Orchestra came in and used our stage and some of our equipment, i.e. chairs, stands, percussion equipment, and whatever else they needed.  well, the little elementary kids came in and took their places and the concert started.  they played stuff that no one from an elementary school would know, but those of us in high school would, because it was from our time(when we were little).  first off, they asked people to come up and conduct.  well, all the little kids raised their hand, but seemed timid about it.  me on the other hand.  i flew up out of my seat and jumped up and down like an idiot and yelled out, "PICK ME! PICK ME! PICK ME!"  i think i scared the little kids infront of me.  but i really wanted to conduct.  did i get to conduct though?  no.  instead they brought up two little girls that conducted really funny but crappy, and a choral teacher that tried to conduct a choir.  seriously.  i really wanted to conduct.  anyhoo, as the concert continued, the played Somewhere Out There from An American Tale.  that movie was the shit by the way.  well, the conductor turns around and asks if any of the little kids know who the main character was in the movie, and did they?  no.  but did me, friend-lee, frobird, and greg know?  yes, because we grew up with that movie.  so we're all in the back yelling out the name of the character.  which was fivel by the way.  again, we scared the little kids in front of us.  amazing how three seniors and a junior can act like fourth graders in a moments notice.  well, they finish and leave and i get ready to leave and go to my luncheon.    i left for the luncheon and drove out to Oakrigde Country Club off of Buckingham in downtown garland.  i get there.  mara was with me by the way.  so we go in there and glad hand a couple of people and then sit down to eat.  boy did i eat.  i had a big plate of fruit.  followed by two plates of rice, bread, and beef and chicken.  note that these plates were quite large, and filled them up to the breaking point.  needless to say, i ate well.  then the meeting started.  first, we said the pledge and all that stuff, and then they honored a police officer that had been recommended by the police department to get an award from the rotary club for outstanding service.  apparently this guy chased after a stolen car, then chased after the driver on foot, and ended up catching him in a dark alley.  mind you, this is all going on a four in the morning, so it's still very dark outside.  well, the suspect proceeds to start beating the shit out of the guy, but he still managed to get some cuffs on the dude.  so he wins.  good job officer.  then me and mara introduced ourselves to the group.  and then this dude got up and talked to us about business ethics.  it appeared that in a college setting, 30 to 50% of the people don't have proper ethics, whether they're business or personal.  what is this world coming to?  well, we left that and then i went and blew my brains out for the next 3 and a half hours playing in jazz band and the rehearsal afterwards for "wind symphony".    then i went home.  and then, my day went to shit quicker than i've ever seen it go.  i'm practicing my scales.  yes i know.  quite a shock that i'm practicing.  anyways, i'm practicing my scales, and my sister runs by and yells and scares the crap out of me b/c i'm not expecting it.  well, then i moved on to the region music.  i'm playing along and i miss a note.  no problem.  i start over and again, miss the same note.  again, still getting my fingers warmed up.  start again, miss two notes.  then a whole phrase slips my grasp.  then it's tounge screw up here, note missed there, slur gone wrong there.  and then it goes out of control, and i blew it.  i said screw it.  all because my sister had to scare the living shit out of me.  i was in the zone too.  scales were flying like none other, and then i broke.  damn life.  then, it only gets better.  i get out of the shower and end up getting yelled at for not doing a current event.  but wait, here's the kicker.   IT'S NOT DUE TILL FRIDAY!!!   i'm getting yelled at for something that hasn't even passed yet.  what the hell is that?  people piss me off sometimes.  and i only made it worse because i was already in a bad mood from snapping while i was playing, so getting yelled at only worsened my disposition to the point that i started to yell back.  not a good idea.  but did i care?   HELL NO!!!     stupid shitty days.  always ruin the good stuff.  screw it.  i'm out.  later.  demon halfling

       continuing on top of what  urlLink kevin  and  urlLink matt , Joey DeFrancesco is the man on B3.  Ivory made me hate myself for the way i play.  isn't it funny about how after you hear someone that's really bad ass on your instrument that you walk away wanting to quit because you just suck compared to them.  on the other hand, it makes you want to play way better.  so i think i'm going to take the get better way than the quit way, cause that would be just stupid.    on other notes, getting into the actual concert was quite a feat.  it ended up that Angie went with us too, and we only had three tickets.  thus, we have a problem.  well, i was determined to get all of us into that concert.  so what did i do?  did i become a demon halfling and tear some poor man's arm off to get his ticket?  no.  instead i tried to get my name on the list and got yelled at in return.  well, they started releasing tickets, and people on the list weren't there.   WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?   i ask to get my name on there, and they say no, but some schmuck can get his name on there and not even show up?  that's a load of shit.  rant over, back to the story.  so we waited in line until everyone else that was on the list had gotten theirs.  well, come to find out, there's four tickets left.   FOUR!   i'm third in line.  fairly close to the front, but still far enough away that i can go home w/o my ticket.  well, the first lady orders two.  thus, we now have two left.  yes, my chances are now lowered, and there's still a person in front of me.  as he orders, i'm quietly saying that if he gets the last two i'll kill him.  he orders one.  good boy.  so in effect, i got the last ticket.   HAHA!!!   those that didn't get to see it, sorry, but you should have jumped in line faster.  and in closing, we saw an awesome concert and Angie's fancy for jazz grew more.  she will be learned.    other than that, usual stuff happened.  had some fun.  rode in Angie's dad's corvette.  that is a beautiful car.  and that's about it.  later.  demon halfling

       as you all have no doubtly noticed, red dingus, gold dingus, demon matt, and i have all taken it upon ourselves to free Friend-Lee from the friend zone that holdsd him captive.  He has three weeks to stop being a pansy and ask her out.  if he does not, then Gold Dingus will do it for him.  one way or another, he's coming out of the zone.    some of you may see this as a cruel and unusual way to free him.  forcing him to do something that he doesn't want to do.  but look at it this way.  we're fighting the good fight.  fighting to free another soul for the horrid friend zone.  just think, soon the friend zone will exist no more.  but like red dingus said,  WE NEED YOUR HELP!   whenever you see lee, ask him about the friend zone.  give him words of encouragement.  tell him that time is running out.  tell him that he needs to stop being a pansy and grow a pair and  ASK HER OUT!   you too, need to fight the good fight to end the friend zone's grip on him.    join us and see what you can do to free him.  later.  demon halfling

       i, Demon halfling, have done many accomplishments in my time.  you will bow before me now, as i tell you of my trials.  1) girls love me.  why you may ask?  because the halfling's got the looks,  AND  the brains.    2) i've had to climb over millions of raging women who want a piece of the halfling to climb to my post above my subjects.  3) i'm as stong as 30 oxen.  4) my father is of the best demon liniage.  5) my mother is a human and can kick my father's ass.  6) i've killed many men for countless reasons.  7) i carry the soul of the greatest warrior to live at my side.  he protects me from the evil spirits that try to steal my strength in the great battles that i fight.  8) i've waged war by myself.    the rest will come after i finish torturing evil souls.  later.

       friends and followers, it's friday night and i didn't have a football game.  those are done and over with.  here's a couple of updates to keep you happy and make you stick around for more.  1) friday night football is done.  THANK GOD!!!  now i will actually have friday nights like tonight to go and do whatever the hell i want to. 2) i can get a job now because i don't have to worry about marching band and all that crap, just the occasional after school rehearsal and MOJO gigs.   3) me and jasmine are better and back to being friends.  disreguard all comments about kiddy pool.  there is no kiddy pool.  i repeat, THERE IS NO KIDDY POOL.  once more now,  THERE IS NO KIDDY POOL . 4) i made 32nd in state.  kinda disappointed because there were only 35 that made it, but when i sat back i realized that out of the 1000+ sax players, i was 32.  kinda leaves a good feeling in you. 5) because i made 32nd in state, i have decided that i'm going to beat the shit out of the legit region music, make region, make area, and quite possibly, make state there.  even though it's legit, it's another shot at state.  and i guarentee that i'm not f***ing up this audition. 6) i went out with angie and two of her friends tonight to see the matrix revolutions for a third time.  yes that's right.  a third time.  it just get's better every time i see it. 7) that's for certain people to know, and they know who they are.    well, that's it for tonight.  good night all.  later.  demon matt (halfling)

       ok, since my first attempt to post this was cruelly shut down by my stupid computer in Webmastering.   WEBMASTERING!!!   ok.  yes.  i am a demon.  do i want to tell you the story?  no.  do i care that you don't know the story?  no.  should you stop your incesant whining about how i won't tell you the story?  yes.  anyhoo.  back to what i was putting on here.  Kiddy Pool found out about Kiddy Pool and got pissed.  WHAA!!!  that's all i have to say to that.  today Matrix Revolutions comes out.  Me, gimplee, dingus, frobird, and kevin are all going to attempt to see this.  we will bravely wait in line for this.  yes, we are sad sad souls.  what's worse?  all of us except for kevin are going thursday before the game with the jazz band.  and then, me, Angie, and one of her friends that wants to meet me and "approve" are going see it again on friday.  yes, i am a sad person.  but do i care?  no.  update later when i have more substance.  later.

       this weekend and up to this point in the week has been full of rants and raves.  let's start with the raves.  i like good things first.  on friday, my little slices of heaven arrived in a protective package all ready for me to open up and play my little heart out on.  oh how those new ZZ reeds are sweet sweet pieces of wood.  they play beautifully.  i highly advise buying a box if you haven't already.    also on friday, lee, kevin, angie, and me all went and saw Texas Chainsaw Massacre after the football game.  oh what a fun time that was.  lee passed out from the movie.  in case you haven't seen him around school, he's got skin marks on the side of his head, around his nose, and by his mouth.  oh lee, what a weak stomach you have.  for more on this, see  urlLink Fizban's Comptemplations on Life  for a more detailed story.    but the highlight of friday was the free burrito i got in return for my dignity.  that's right.  me, gimplee, and dingus all went up to Chipotle in Mesquite and traded our dignity for a free burrito.  how did we do this one might ask?  by dressing up like burritos for halloween of course.  that's right, in that famous parking lot, we wrapped ourselves up like burritos and recieved applause and free burritos.  after finishing our well earned dinner, we balled all the foil that covered us and placed the foil that had contained our coveted burrito on top and proceeded to name our foil balls.  Dingus named his seamus.  just think about that one and i'm sure you'll figure it out.  gimplee named his Yorick from Hamlet.  and me.  since i have no imagination, i named mine soul stealer.  why may you ask?  because i have no imagination.    now for the rants.  most of them side rants.  on friday, i went to the football game.  we lost.  YAY!!!  do i care?  no.  in fact i'm happy.  why is this under rants then?  because i had to waste my time going to the game.  yes, i don't care anymore.    saturday i woke up bright and early to go take the SAT test.  trust me.  you don't have to study for this test.  it's easy.  way easier than all those damned AP tests.  if colleges were smart, they'd make everyone take an AP test and then they would have less stuipid people in there and more smart people.  but who am i to say they can't steal stupid people's money while they think that they understand what they're learning.  then, after that fiasco i went home and slept until my date that night.  and no, you won't find out about that.  sunday i slept.  that's all i did.  that's not a rant.  that's nothing.  i think i'll go sleep some more.    lat...zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz

       right about now i look like a stupid chipmunk.  on monday i got my wisdom teeth pulled out and man did it hurt.  i got all four taken out.  what's worse was that i could feel them being taken out!!!  i felt all the stuff, course, i couldn't open my eyes cause i was drugged to high heaven but still, the fact that i could kinda feel it sucked ass.  when i got home i was literally screaming in pain.  the only time i've ever felt more pain was when i had knee surgery.  it still hurts right now.  so yes, i look like a chipmunk.  no, i won't go outside and look for acorns just to give u laughs.    onto more better things.  i finally got a cable internet connection.  HELL YES!!!  no more crappy dial up for me.  thank god.  well, that's about all for now.  later.  demon halfling

       that's right people, i'm going to be playing the piano on top of my saxophone.  but i'll get to that in a second.  first off, let's get to the good stuff.  like the goods i got for christmas.  1) clothes.  yes, everyone gets clothes.  but it's ok because it's not socks and boxers.  no, i don't wear tighty-whities.  i got two really comfortable pairs of jeans, a turtleneck that i liked, and a new hoodie that i'm sure that angie will confiscate and give me back the one that she gave me originally.  but that's ok.  2) money.  i need money.  everyone needs money.  i got money.  nuff said.  3) gift cards.  the next best thing to money is a gift card that way i can get what i really want instead of what i thought i wanted.  u see the point?  i do.  4) burrito bucks.  where would i be without  urlLink Chipotle .  insane.  that's where.  i got 10 more burrito bucks on top of the 25 i already had.  but that 25 is for me and angie, so i'll only use the 10.  but still, that's good enough for me.  5) Samurai X: The Motion Picture.  awesome awesome movie.  i already liked the series and the movie that preceeded the series, Trust and Betrayal, but this is great.  really good.  can't say enough good things about it.    now to the really good stuff, and the title of the entry.  6) a CD burner.  yes, finally i won't have to use my dad's crummy computer to burn cds.  and, a cable modem is on the way, so no more slow dial up connections either.  7) a full size electric grand piano.  all 88 keys and about a million and one settings.  i love it so much.  i learned the right hand part for greensleaves in about 5 minutes.  granted that's not that hard, it's still a big feat for me.    so that's the main clean up for my christmas.  i hope that the rest of you have a safe and happy holiday.  later.  demon halfling

       yes, yes, i know that it's not even christmas day yet, but the greatest present that could come at this point in time has come.  no, it's not a classic car, i already have that.  no, it's not a plane, don't how to fly one of those... yet.  no, it's not a boat, i already have one of those too, no matter what angie says.  no, no, no.  it's something way WAY better.   IT'S MY ACCEPTANCE LETTER TO UNT!!!!!!!!!!   yes ladies and gentlemen, today, on christmas eve, i got my acceptance letter to UNT.  i'm a mean green eagle now.  that'll make my sister happy cause she loves doing the little claw thing they do.  and i know that a lot of you were saying that i'm in no matter what, but u know what, i like to be sure.  and now i am.  all i have to do now is nail my audition for the school of music and then i can study what i really want to study.  what is that?  jazz studies of course.  so ladies and gentlemen, i'm an eagle.  YAY!!!  now that that's over, on to other things.  last saturday was our christmas party.  dingus and fizban and angie and me all got stormed by my little sister.  i've told people this before, she may look cute, but it's all hiding a ball of energy that rivals most science experiments that happened in that supercollider out in whereever, texas.  can't really remember where right now.  that was a fun night.  and then came sunday.  sunday was three months with angie.  i can't remember the last time i made it this far in a relationship nor ever having as much fun with anyone as i have for the last three months.  she really makes me happy.  we traded gifts on this day too.  but i'll explain that in a minute.  we started off our day at 12 noon with The Lord Of The Rings: The Return Of The King.  awesome awesome awesome movie.  beat all others.  just awesome.  then, we went, to the place that i first took her out to eat at.  Johnny Carino's.  we always eat the bread, split a plate of spaghetti, and then finish with the tiramisu.  mmmmm, tiramisu.  so good.  then we went bowling.  we played four games and she beat me three out of four.  man i suck at bowling.  now, on to what i got present wise.    1) Kurt Elling's Man In The Air.  i like this cd.  a lot.  he sings very good.  i recommend that you all buy this cd.  now.  2) Joey Defranceso(spelling?) Ballads and Blues.  when i went and saw this guy play, he was awesome.  angie enjoyed it a lot.  it was her first jazz concert.  and fizban, no one cares that you don't like the B3, cause all that matters is if the person playing it can burn it up with good stuff, and Joey sure can.  good cd.  it's his latest if i'm not mistaken.  3) Paquito D'Rivera, The Best Of...  i love this guy's saxophone playing.  he can wail wail wail.  i true great among the sax legends.  i recommend anything that has him on it.   4) a shirt from hollister.  i should have seen this coming b/c angie told me to pick out a shirt that i liked, and that's the one i picked.  i like it very much.  it's very comfortable.  man i pick out great stuff.  lol.  5) a shirt from american eagle.  this one has an interesting story behind it because i told angie that i didn't wear a medium and she had already bought it, so i kinda threw her for a loop even though i really do wear a medium.    6) very sexy for men.  it's a cologne so shut up with the jokes and comments before it gets out of hand.  it smells very good.  i like it very much.  amazingly enough, it's from victoria's secret.  i mean it, not one joke or else...  7) Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust.  this is a really awesome movie.  i suggest getting it.    well, that's the present wrap up.  her parents got us burrito bucks since we eat at  urlLink Chipotle  all the time.  well, it's officially christmas day.  so i guess i'll go to sleep since santa clause is on his way.  i once met him, but that's for a later update.  merry christmas to all and to all a goodnight.  later.  demon halfling

       seriously, it's been a long time since i last updated.  i started to during webmastering one day, but as luck would have it, my computer and fizban's computer just randomly shut down and re-booted again, so i got lazy and said screw it, i'll do it later.  well, here's later.  there's been a multitude of concerts this past week, with still one more to play.  here's the run down of the past two concerts i've done in the past week.     Monday: A FLURRY OF JAZZ: featuring the Lakeview Jazz Combo and the Lakeview Messengers of Jazz Orchestra (if you haven't figured it out yet, that's LMOJO)   this concert was the first jazz concert of the year.  it was also one of MOJO's guest concerts.  we didn't fly anyone in or something like that, we just had people we knew and were good friends with come and play with us.  on this distinguished list were kevin on tenor, Galen Jeter on trumpet, Chuck Willis on trumpet, and Ty Shaw on vocals.  here's the run down of the concert and my review for each song.   The Lakeview Jazz Combo   yes, i'm a part of this.  it's a mish-mash of a combo in that we have three saxes, one trombone player, a guitar, a bass, and a drummer.  that's right, no trumpets.   Four: Miles Davis   i really really REALLY hate soloing on this song because the bridge always screws me up.  it's not the head, it's not the a section, it's just that damned bridge.  that was possibly the worst solo i'd had for that song.  i don't know what it is.  when we play it at Starbucks, i do fine, but in Combo, i just can't relax and play it.  maybe it's because i just feel more comfortable with the people i play it with at Starbucks.  who knows?   The Christmas Song: Mel Torme   i never really knew just how ugly mel torme was until uncle jerry showed me a picture of him when we were looking for a background to the slide for the concert.  man he's ugly.  anywho, i was the soloist again on this since i'm the only one that has the melody for the whole song. (it's a pain in the ass to find a place to breathe.) this song went off really good.  uncle jerry told me to play it like the G Weasel when i first got it, but i told him that if he ever made me do that, i was walking out and never coming back.  i played it pretty, and matt like, not G Weasal suckage like.  overall, good song.   Take 5: Dave Brubeck and Paul Desmond   man i love this song.  it's a good tune and it just roles like none other.  i again soloed and actually didn't have that bad of a time considering the fact that uncle jerry never gave me changes for it.  me and brad(the drummer) traded fours in a 5/4 piece, which is quite interesting when you first try it, but it's still better than soloing in 9/friggin' 4.  (DAMN YOU TIME FOR A CHANGE!!!)  that went off fairly well.     Good King W: Lakeview Jazz Combo   we took Manheim Steamroller's Good King whatever his name is and made it a funk tune.  didn't sound too bad.  we played the head, which wasn't much just a little funky beat that started it out and was followed with a a funky line being played by the winds.  then we played the head over jingle bells, which i still don't understand how uncle jerry got in to the part, but it worked when you could hear it over me because i was soloing when that part was being played.  and then we traded fours between the entire group and then played the head over the jingle bells theme.  it was interesting, but still cool at the same time.    thus, the Lakeview Jazz Combo had made it's first appearence and they didn't blow up like REvolution did last year.  (no offense to anyone that was in Revolution last year.)  and now for the headliner of the concert, LMOJO.   The Lakeview Messengers of Jazz Orchestra   i'm also in this.  fun ain't it?   Latin Holiday   my band leader debut.  since mr. c had to play, i got to lead the band.  it started off pretty cmofortable at a nice, slow, ballad tempo, and then went straight to hell at the tempo change.  our  drummer  dumber decided to kick up the tempo faster than what i was giving him.  about 60 to 70 beats faster.  it was way to fast.  some people said it was more fun there, but a bunch of think that it would have been cleaner and better at the  CORRECT  tempo.  mr. c didn't mind too much because he didn't have to sit on notes very long.  out piano player, Mrs. Whitlow, we'll call her rusty, came late during the song, and was reluctant to go out in the middle of the song, but our regular piano player sucks and we all told her to go out there, so she did and basically kicked the guy off the piano bench.  i got a good laugh out of that.  it was basically like saying, "thanks for keeping my seat warm, now beat it."  she's not really that mean, i'm just saying what it seemed like.  it was still funny though.     Better Git Hit in You Soul: Charles Mingus   i like this song.  i like it a lot.  but i don't like when our base player sucks and can't play it.  the problem is that our dumber listens to the bass player for tempo and our bass player listens to the dumber for tempo.  do u see where the problem lies?  it's a perpetual slow down.  why god why?  why do they ruin such a good song?  WHY?   No More Blues: Antonio Carlos Jobim   i like this song too, but i hate the first 24 bars because all of the saxes are a half step away from each other.  at one point my back almost snapped in half from the tuning chills that were flying down my spine.  i hate those.  so painful at times.  this was the song however, that uncle jerry soloed on.  he can play a guitar like none other.  it was nice to hear a guitar with the big band.  it's been so long since we've had one.  freshman year i think.  well, uncle jerry blew us away at his mad skillz on guitar and surprisingly, our dumber didn't lose too much tempo, although i'm pretty sure our bass player didn't know the chords and got lost and ended up playing the wrong ones.     Fly Me To The Moon: Bart Howard   we finally get to hear Mr. Shaw sing.  but we hadn't practiced with him, so it was only natural that we would all suck when we got together.  the first time any of it got brought together was when we played it that night.  everytime we wanted to practice with him, he got called down to the office for something or other.  he came in late on the vocals, the saxes got off from the rest of the band and it was just shameful.  shameful i tell you.  shameful.     I'll Be Around: Alec Wilder   originally big wes woodrow was supposed to play this with us, but he canceled because he doesn't enjoy improving since his standard of good just happens to be Carl Fontana good and he got the changes about two days before.  so he called and canceled and left dingus to play it.  he didn't do too bad of a job.  good dingus.  the band was something to be desired though.  or course, it all starts with the rhythem section.  why are we cursed with such a bad rhythem section?  someone please tell me.     Lost Star: Sammy Nestico   there's a lot of sammy's writing that i like, and this one was done really well.  it's a really really sad song tied with death and all that bad stuff.  it featured slick willy the love goat on flugel and trumpet.  it was a pretty yet sad song.  but it came off well.  at least that's what i thought.   Fox Hunt: Michael Abene (Maynard's arrangement)   Where to begin?  we rehearsed this with Jeter and Chuck once, and that was at 7 the night of the concert.  the band was ok.  the rhythem section was not.  the soloists were of course very good.  but the rhythem section was not.  tempo's all over the place and the chords ain't right.  one day this halfling's gonna kill the rhythem section and get a new, better one with more buttons and things that makes noises.  an upgrade to the new top of the line rhythem section that can play anything.  and i mean anything.   The Chicken: James Ellis(arr. Kris Berg)   yay, last song.  and kevin's playing it with us on tenor.  he and fizban decided at the last minute to have a battle and of course, fizban ended up getting schooled by kev.  but because of this last minute change, the solo section was a bit rough.  and of course, the rhythem section can't play.  it's not that hard to play the bass line to this song.  fizban did it for five chorus'.  not that he wasn't about to die, but if fizban can do it, anyone can do it.  SO WHY CAN'T OUR BASS PLAYER DO IT?  cause he sucks.  end of story.  kevin did a good job reguardless of wrong chords and what not, and fizban was just fizban.    the end of the concert.  yes.      Tuesday: Winter Concer (yes we have to be  politically   socially  ethinically correct): featuring the Lakeview Centennial High School Bands   let me just state for the record that i don't enjoy playing legit in the least, i just do it because they force me to.   The Lakeview Centennial High School Combined Symphonic and Concert Bands   the tuning was so horrendous during this portion of the concert that i can't even review it.  it was bad.  really, really bad.     The Lakeview Centennial High School Wind Symphony   yes, we're a wind symphony now.     Carols 3: Luigi Zaninelli   this is an interesting song.  it takes three christmas carols and combines them all to be played at once.  it's a good song, and i think we did an ok job of it.     Stille Nacht: arr. Chip Davis (the guy that arranges for Manheim Steamroller)   we sang.  i'm serious, we all sang for the entire first half of this song.  but for being musicians that mostly don't sing, we sang good.  besides, listen to some of the people in choir and tell me we don't sing better than some of them.  this was a challenging song because it required a lot of emotion and musicality.  something that some people in this band don't have.  but it wasn't too bad either.   Fantasia on the Dargason: Gustave Holst   i hate/love this song.  it's fun because it's just bouncy and what not, but i hate it because i can only take so much bouncy and fun crap.  this went off ok.  our guest conductor, ms. thao, our ta, was really really nervous and stumbled over all of her words.    Greensleeves: arr. Alfred Reed   uncle jerry once met Alfred Reed.  the guy referred to himself in the third person.  in fact, he was so arrogant, that he to uncle jerry, "mr. reed does not wish to speak to you anymore.  good day," and turned around and walked off.  what a bastich.  but when you write like he does, you can get that big of an ego.     Amparito Roca, Spanish March: Jaime Texidor   Pablo faces the bull and gets Maria in the end.  this was a fun spanish march with a good story line.  challenging but fun.    and now for the big finale.     A Christmas Festival: Leroy Anderson   all of the bands came out and played this.  it would have been better to play sleigh ride instead, but whatever works.  the sound delay was horrible.  the brass were on one side of the auditorium and the woodwinds were on the other with uncle jerry in the middle conducting.  we almost fell apart for a second.  but it eventually came back together.    and thus, the Winter Concert had ended.  the next concert i play at is the Choir concert.  i'm going to play tenor with the Patriot Women's choir on thursday.  it starts at 7:30.  come see.    later.  demon halfling

       yes people that's right, the halfling only has three, that's  3, TRES, THREE  more days until there's absolutly no more calculus.   EVER!!!   i'll never have to take that class again.  did i need the class when i started the year?  yes.  do i need it now that i'm a music major?   NO!!!   so, three more class periods, and then i'm free.  yes, that's right, i'm free.  but will go in it's place?  PIANO!!!  i will stretch my arms into another land of the musical world that i live in.  so far it's been the saxophone (which i'm told that i'm continually getting better at), the baritone (which is was forced to learn to play in the worst possible way and ended up building the worst habits.  (in a side note, during marching season, i picked up a freshman's trombone and picked off a really high note with all the bad habits i'd built up, and he goes, i wish i could do that, JUST LIKE YOU!!!  i quickly told him how he really didn't want to play like me on a brass instrument, and dingus gladly backed me up.)  ok, back to the first side note.), and conducting (which contrary to what stupid people say, it's not an instrument in it's own right, but it is part of the musical world, plus, i'm good at it.)  soon we will all see just how good the halfling is on piano.  or just how much he can suck it up and put the good piano's name to shame.    in other halfling news, last night was our random starbucks gig.  literally, i look up from practicing and see my cell phone ringing.  i walk over and look at the number that was on it and checked the voicemail that the person had left.  it was mr. c telling me that i was playing at starbucks the next night.  oh what an interesting night that was.  we were to play for two hours, which equals 45 minutes of playing, 15 minutes of break time, and then 45 more minutes of play time.  we played so blues and cool jazz along with some standard christmas tunes all jazzed up.  before hand, there were lead alto parts missing from the folder, so i had to copy them by hand from the score.  surprisingly, that takes longer than i thought.  there's a lot of crap to write.  i mean, i've dabbled in writing music before, yet i have no clue if any of it works or not, but just copying this stuff was time consuming.  oh so long.  by the time i got done, it was time to go to starbucks.  well, of course i'm the first to show up because i for some reason have to drive to not care but keep up a good image.  our sudo rhythem section showed up after me and began setting up after i procured a deal to let us set up inside instead of fighting the wind outside in the cold.  i call them a sudo rhythem section because they suck.  i'm serious.  they suck.  during the second set we played four (which i'll go into later) our bass player got lost.   LOST!!!   our drummer, slows down like none other.  he can't even play triplets without dropping at least 20 beats.  and a metronome does him no good because he'll get off before he ever starts.   i couldn't remember the rest of this post and it's been to long so i'll just leave it at that.  demon halfling

       there's nothing to do.  i'm serious.  here i sit locked up in hell with at least 30 minutes of real class still left along with another hour and a half to two hours of "wind symphony" rehearsal left.  in the fourty-five minutes i have inbetween hell and rehearsal, i have an NHS meeting to go to and i have to limp home on slightly less than a quarter tank of gas to get my horn and music and then limp back up here.  but wait, there's more.  oh yes, after rehearsal, i still have more to do.  (yes i'm complaining.  and i really don't care what you think about it.)  i will now drag myself to albertsons to get money, (notice i'm not limping anymore because probably by this time i'll be running on fumes in my car) and then, i have to inch my way over to the gas station where gas is cheapest.  then it's home.  but home to what?  home to practicing.  yes, i know it doesn't sound that bad.  but i just hate practicing after a long weekend where i don't get to.  there's just that much more rust to scrape off for saturday.    thinking of saturday, i'm not ready.  but does fate care?   NO!!!   oh well.  i'm getting there.  kevin's helped me a lot.  and i still have one more lesson with him before crunch time.  but, whatever happens happens.    time is slowly winding down on my UNT college of music application.  it's almost done and all.  i know, i know.  how hard is it to fill out an application.  truth is, it's not.  i'm just lazy and have a hard time forcing myself to do the inevitable.  just think, i'm almost out of high school.  i thought this would be the best thing to happen to me, but little did i know...  i got to thinking about just what high school had done for me for the past four years.  it tortured me.  kicked my ass.  pissed me off.  made me do more crap than i ever want to do again.  it made me hate people.  it made me cold hearted and just plain mean to people.  it made me want to leave and be out on my own more than anything.  and the stupid thing is that i liked it.  now i know your all thinking, "demon halfling, how can you like something that you seem to hate so much?"  well kiddies, i'll tell you.  the fact is that this is nothing compared to what the real life outside of this little world i call high school is like.  the fact that i'm out on my own without my sheltered crutch called parents only makes me wonder at how deep i can wade into the perpetual mound of shit that's out there waiting for me.  thankfullyl, i have a sudo- big brother named kevin to help quide me down the path of rightousness.  plus he can get me in good with the people at UNT.  but that's not the only reason i like him.  he's cool. he made me better as a player.  so it's already apparent to me that for a little bit, college will be a bit scary, even if i'm only 45 minutes from home.  but after that, it's on to the big world that's waiting to grab me and throw me off a cliff to the sharp pointy rocks below.  not only will i be new to the evil world that exists outside the hell i call school, but that i will be a jazz studies major.  yes, a professional musician in a world that likes to chew guys like me up and spit them out.  scary scary stuff.  oh how i can't wait for what awaits me in that deep deep ocean of a world.  it's scary to get me thinking when i'm bored.  later.  demon halfling

       so it's been a while since i've updated, so now's the time.  lots of stuff has happened since i've updated, so here it goes.   monday   back to school.  got the region jazz music.  played through the guys and dolls book.  there is way too much crap in that book.  one song it literally about 500 measures.   tuesday   same old school day with wind symphony rehearsal.   wednesday   BORING!!!!   thursday   finally a day with some action.  went to school same old same old.  the dude that looks up porn in webmastering was doing it again.  sick sick man.  went up to CCCC after school and registered for combo.  what a long time.  but at least i got in, unlike demon matt, who got totally screwed over by the system.  i went up there and stood in line, only to be told that i was in the wrong line and that i needed to go over to that line over there (which was longer) and wait there.  so i did.  and i waited and waited.  keving showed up with a paper that i would later need.  i finally saw an advisor.  i don't really see why they need them.  the people at the admissions desk could have done what she did.  well, she took me over to the admissions desk, whose line i stood in earlier, and let me skip everyone and jump to the front.  so the lady there took over and told me that i needed kris berg's signature.  well, berg wasn't there, so i wasted about five more minutes trying to figure that out.  well, i go back and thankfully she just says whatever and puts me in the class.  mission accomplished.  after that i saw angie for about 30 minutes and then went to region jazz rehearsal.    i was pretty early for it.  about 15 minutes early, so i got an extended warm up.  we didn't ever start on time, but people were late.  why people?  why?  is it really that hard to show up on time?  i mean seriously, it's like they didn't even care.  they didn't even apoligize.  that's grounds for a stabbing.  well, we continued on with rehearsal.  we got through all the music and determined what needed to be beaten out.  the saxes had the most stuff to work on, but then again, most of our charts were a sea of black.  i got asked if i wanted a solo, and of course, i said yes.  i'm no fool.  i want every solo i can get.  when we got to the song i had a solo on i totally crapped all over it.  the clinician, tim ishii, who was very good, helped me and the trumpet player on the changes and then we started to run it again.  just before we got to the solo section, kevin walked in.  the exact words that came out of my mouth were, "oh shit."  the pressure of not blowing up just jumped up about a million miles cause not only was ishie a sax player, kev would surely be listening.  thankfully i didn't fully tank.  we broke at about 9:30 and we had social hour.  literally.  we stood in the band hall and talked uptil they kicked us out and then we stood outside in the cold and eventually the rain until we all left.  i think i split about 10:45.  overall, not a bad rehearsal, we were already farther along than anyone had expected.     friday   chops are dead, and there's still a day of playing left.  oh, it hurt.  the pain was there all day.  literally.  it hurt to put the thing in my mouth.  but, i pushed through it.  after school i went to kevin's and we hammered out my solo for region for about an hour and a half.  really worked kevin's piano.  we've decided to create a singing/playing duo.  he plays his piano and sings, i play sax and sing, and we trade.  he can't be out of tune with his perfect pitch and i can just be the less the perfect singer.    that night i went to the motocross with my dad.  it was really cool.  it was up at american airlines center.  this was the first time i'd ever been to the AAC.  really big place.  there were a couple of riders that did backflips, which i vowed never to do for fear of dying.  oh well.   saturday   oh saturday.  clinic all day.  concert at night.  woke up about 7:30.  way way too early on a saturday.  went up to rowlett about five minutes before rehearsal started.  that was at 8:30.  we didn't get started until about 9.  ishii wasn't even there on time.  he walked in right as we were supposed to start.  so we waited.  fizban showed up late.  but had we started? no.  we endedup starting around 9.  which was ok.  more time to warm up.  at least this time everyone was on time for the down beat.  even if it was late.  we started out with the song my solo was on.  when i played the quote from autumn leaves ishii laughed a little and complimented me on my solo.  he then told the rest of the band that autumn leaves was the changes for the last eight bars of each 16 bar rep.  so thanks kev for pointing that out to me in the first place.  we continued on and got to a point where the saxes were having some problems with a lick.  on thursday ishii had told us to go home a practice the lick.  we did.  each of us said we practiced it for about 30 minutes.  was it as clean as ishii wanted it?  no.  so what did he do?  he gave the brass a   30 MINUTE BREAK!!!!    the saxes however, got to stay the whole time and beat this lick till we could play it to his standards.  we worked of tails off the whole time.  after it was up to his standards the brass came in and we got our break.  our tiny 5, if that, minute break.  no rest for us.  oh no.  we finished up and left ourselves with about 3 songs left to play after lunch.  so we broke for lunch.  by we i mean everyone except the saxes.  because we have invincible chops that will never tire.  well, everyone else got 2 hours for lunch and we spent the first 30 minutes of it yet again rehearsing something that wasn't up to par.  it was safe to say that we were all a bit volatile when we finally broke.    kev showed up near the end of the morning block and him, fizban, woody, demon matt, the 2nd tenor player (his name escapes me), coop, and i all went to chipotle for burritos.  me and fizban got in a foil fight at one point and used kev as our blocker.  he was already sitting inbetween us so we just used him to deflect shots.  nothing ever hit him, but a wasted throw could have.  i nail fizban in the head and throat with the two balls of foil i had in my possession.  all in all, fizban got beat.    we left freedom and went back up to rowlett.  but what happens?  we start late again.  that's ok.  more rest time.  but wait, it gets better.  this time, the guitar player and the bass player were late.  they had two friggin' hours for lunch and they still come back late?  you gotta be fuckin' kiddin' me.  this is when it just gets stupid.  here we are, ready to start.  in fact, we had started a tune, and in they waltz as if the entire fuckin' world revolves around them.  if this were a professional setting, they would have been fired.  for the band to start late and still have people show up after we've started playing?  seriously, how fucking stupid are you to do that?  i mean seriously?  damn it!!!!!!!!!!  fucking morons.    and now that rant's over... back to the story.  we continued through rehearsal and ended early.  yet again, the saxes stayed and worked some more stuff out.  everyone else left at 3 or there about, and we left at 3:45.  it safe to say that we were pretty wasted afterwards.    went home and watched bruce almighty and then went up to lakeview at 6.  the call time was 6:30 but the saxes were going to work stuff out.  which brings me to my second rant.    kev teaches 4 and a half of the saxes.  i say half because the lead tenor doesn't take from him anymore but he used to.  well, this guy apparently thinks that he's got everything down because we would try to rehearse stuff and he would either not play, fumble through it causing us to have to do it again, or be on his phone.  does he not know that we're trying to get better in what little time we have before we get to go out on stage and drop our pants for all to see and hope they don't laugh.  he really pissed me off.  well, everyone shows up and we go out on stage and do sound checks and what not.  and then, concert time.    we'll do a run down of the songs.   A Little Happiness   this is a sammy nestico chart that's a real easy going tune.  not to bad.  kinda fun.  no hard sax licks.  just easy.  it was a good song to start the concert off with.   Samba Libre   my solo tune.  this was a latin tune that had a good groove to it.  my solo was probably the best i've ever played.  i personally liked my solo for once.  tim ishie again complimented me on it and kev said it was pretty good.  thus, i'm in a good mood for the rest of the night.   Blues at Drury   hard sax lick and soli.  this was the tune of the day for the saxes.  we must have beat the hell out of this song for a good 2 hours overall.  the good thing was that all that hard work paid off cause the soli and the lick were pretty kickin.   Randi   the saxophone chop killer.  espicially for demon matt.  ishii had pushed him hard during the day, but it all payed off.  this song came off real nice.    i've forgotten some of the songs inbetween, so i'll just skip to the last two.   In The Mood   this wasn't the original in the mood, but a cooler and more hip one.  i totally dug it.  the crowd dug it.  everyone dug it.   On The Sunny Side of The Street   the final song of the night.  there were good solos throughout the night and there were bad ones.  each person knows how they did.  that's all that matters.  we finished up the night with ishii taking the final solo.  man he can play.  and i'm green with envy over his horn.  ever since i found out about cannonball horns, i've wanted one.  maybe one day i will have one.  until then, and mark VI or VII (kev?) will suffice.  anywho, ishii blew everyone away with his bad ass solo and set the show out good.    overall, fun concert.  we ended the night with a trip to chipotle.  second of the day mind you.    that's all.  later.  demon halfling slayer of Wotan destroyer of morons

       it's the end of another weekend.  and it was kind of full to say the least.  saturday, went out with angie.  tried to find nickelrama but no luck there so we decided to go to the movie instead.  we saw mona lisa smile (my punishment for making angie sit through master and commander).  it had one funny part where they insult each other but other than that... BORING!!!  total chick flick.  anywho, after that, we went up to kedavi and i sat in on the chicken with kevin, and small portion of combo two, and chris from 15th street jazz.  i think it's safe to say that i got totally schooled in improve.  literally.  i wasn't very happy with my improve but i never am.  oh well.  i can practice more and become better.    today i cleaned out all the crap that had built up in the garage and then angie came over and had dinner with me and the family and we watched divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood (BLEH!!!) and dirty dancing (it was ok... not good, just ok).  and now i sit, comptemplating tomorrow with the first full week of school ahead.  who knows what this next week holds.  later.  demon halfling hater of the cold creater of flames killer of the wotan

       1) sleep 2) read a book 3) update blogs 4) surf for college stuff 5) look up porn 6) read maddox 7) do other homework 8) sit and talk w/ friends  wait... did i miss something or does #5 say look up porn?  that's right folks.  it says look up porn.  which is exactly what this one dude that happens to sit next to me did today.  fizban looked over and told dingus, who told me, who was shocked to find the dude actually looking up porn.  it wasn't even the regular porn.  most guys look up regular porn, like sex or lesbian or whatever else they want.  well, this guy had a wierd fetish.  i decided to at least find out what he was looking at to see if he had good tastes in that kind of stuff.  well, what did he search for?  dragon sex.  what the f*** is dragon sex?  i mean really!  so we talked a bit about how he was just wierd and all that.  frobird went and told the teacher to go look at the dude's computer, which instead of looking it up on the program on his computer that lets him see what's on their screen, he just walks over there and the dude minimizes it and then deletes it, so he doesn't get caught.  i'm thinking a little embaressment from one of us may draw some attention to the dude.  practically the whole class knows about.  they all watched him do it.   what a moron.  oh well.    saw master and commander tonight.  good movie.  i enjoyed it a lot.  well, that's it for now.  later.  demon halfling hater of the cold bringer of fire

       well, hell has taken back my life again.  i was free for a while.  it was actually quite enjoyable.  quiet.  calm.  almost peaceful.  if you don't count the small arguments that happened.  but they are meaningless.  i'll start from the end of the break.   new year's eve   this is the first time in a very long long time that i've had someone on new year's eve to kiss when the ball dropped.  even in my chipmunk state i went over and had fun with angie.  we went and saw something's gotta give with jack nicholson (spelling?) and diane keaton.  it was a good movie, just really long.  i kinda felt like it could have ended earlier than it did.  there were so many better places to resolve the movie.  but oh well.  it was still good.  then we went back to angie's house cause she was leaving the next morning to go skiing in utah and kissed when the ball dropped.     new year's day   i sat around on my ass like a good teenager.     friday   took this day to plan with kevin and decide what i would play for my jazz studies audtion would be.  we've decided to play misty, four, and au privave.  kinda interesting for a program, but who cares really.  at that point the only backgrounds we had were for misty but a run to penders would soon be in order to acquire the others.  got the stitches taken out of my mouth today.  i can begin to eat real food now.   saturday   time to clean.  today was all about cleaning.  i missed out on the tomato run and the pender's run because i was so damn busy cleaning.  i did get rid of a lot of crap that took up space in my room though.  i would call it spring cleaning but it's not spring.   sunday   more cleaning.  it never stops.  there's always something to clean.  whether it's dishes or clothes or just getting rid of crap.  it just never ends.   monday   angie came back today.  didn't get to see her though cause the rents decided that i had sat on my ass long enough during the break that i didn't really deserve to do anything.  had a bit of a heated argument about that.  i just don't pull my weight around the house i guess.  gee, guess i should fix it.  course it doesn't really help when i'm getting yelled at and not getting a chance to explain exactly what it was that i did that day.   tuesday: the final day of freedom   angie came over and spent pretty much the entire day with me.  she basically sat around while i finished up the housework i needed to do and the scholarship stuff i had to do.  we went bowling but the wait was too long for us so we played video games instead.  we played a couple of rounds of air hockey and beat house of the dead 2 and l.a. machine guns.  we also ate at the bowling alley.  the food wasn't too bad.  we ended the night by playing a few games of pool.  it's funny the way girls cheat too cause it's always to their advantage and not yours.  it was ok though.  by this day i had a lot more than just fuz on my face.  those of you that saw me can attest to this, and the swelling had finally gone down.  it felt wierd to shave all the hair off my chin.  i was starting to like it.  oh well, there's always summer.  i also started playing more.  i lost a lot of my air support due to having my wisdom teeth taken out, but that'll all come back with time.  the main thing is that it still hurts a little to play, which again, time will fix.  so for now i'm getting in what playing i can and working the rest out slowly.     HELL!!!   and we return back to the present.  6:40 came way way too early this morning.  i was used to going to bed at about 2:30 or 3 and waking up around 11, but no more of that for me.  when i awoke this morning it was cold and early.  never the best combination.  i went to hell and found that yes, i'm still in calculus.  what did i do?  i went to the best person i could find.  my mom.  i texted my mom after i got my schedule and saw that i was still in that horrendous class.  she quickly fixed the problem.  so as of friday, i'm in piano and will never have to touch calculus again.  WHOO-HOO!!!  now i sit here in web mastering doing busy work that took all of about 15 minutes to do.  we'll see what the rest of the day holds.  later.  demon halfling

       what the hell is a Parisian Sunset?  there was no school yesterday, so why is it an A-Day?  what the hell does all this mean?!?!?!?!  yesterday was Legacy (Parisian Sunset) and more importantly, A-Day.  let's start with A-Day.   A-Day   A-Day stands for audtion day.  that's right.  yesterday was my jazz studies audition taping for UNT.  the tunes, in order of performance, were Au Privave by Charlie Parker, Misty by Errol Garner, and Four by Miles Davis.  Au Privave went fairly well.  it's an f blues.  it took us two takes to lay it down.  not bad overall.  next was misty, this damn thing took three takes to lay down.  i was about dead chop-wise after this.  but the last one ended up being the best, so it was worth it.  last was four.  this, thankfully, took one take.  that's all we needed.  and it was done.  my rhythm section was miles, andrew, and matt, the rhythm section from combo two last semester and from kev and friends live at ke davi.  it's safe to say that overall it was a good recording.    stress level before taping - 1000000000%  stress level after taping - 0%  feeling much better now.  now, on to legacy.   Legacy: Parisian Sunset   after taping, i had literally, about 45 minutes to get ready and pick angie up.  so off to get my car washed.  15 minutes to get there, 5 to do the job.  next, home.  5 minutes to get there, 10 minutes to get dressed, 5 to do final touches.  next, angie.  15 minutes to get there.  now, at this point in time, i'm at 55 minutes.  i'm late.  shit...  thankfully, angie was ok with it.  so i pick her up and we go over to  urlLink dingus'  house to take pictures.  that took about 45 minutes.  next, awards ceremony.  yes, i did get nominated.  in fact, it was for most talented.  didn't win, but who cares, enough people thought i was talented enough to be nominated for the award.  next, pictures.  angie likes to get the biggest package possible.  so there's 70 bucks right there, but it's ok.  lots of pictures good.  next, dance.  we danced to two slow songs and then a few fast songs and left around 8:15.  we went to siciliano's in downtown garland.  up scale looks, low scale prices.  overall, good food and fun times.   urlLink kevin  showed up after we got there from a gig and chilled with us and later at  urlLink dingus'  house afterwards.  me and angie stopped by one of her friends house's so she couls see us together.  we hung there for a while and then went to  urlLink dingus'  house and chilled till angie had to be home at two and then i went home to get some sleep.  overall, good day.  later.  demon halfling

       maynard was last night.  man can he play.  it'll be sad when he dies.  but still, he can play real good for being in his mid 70's.  Dingus has pretty much summed up the whole night.  so since i'm being lazy, you can go and read his to find out more about it.  maynard's still awesome though.  later.  demon halfling throwing the fuck down for the next  THREE  days!!!!!

       this past weekend was valentine's day weekend.  the first valentine's day in a very long time that i've had someone to share it with.  i had a great time doing that and hope that there are more valentine's days to share with angie.    on friday, i practiced more.  slowly getting there.  i need to get where it's good faster, but ideas just don't like me or i can't get them from my head to my horn.  afterwards, me, angie, and one of angie's friends went and saw 50 first dates with adam sandler and drew barrymore.  funny movie.  i was laughing the whole time.  good movie.  saturday i woke up fairly early.  say... 8.  i went and woke angie up.  it was a pain driving through all the crap that was outside.  i was surprised that the roads weren't totally iced up.  i hung out at angie's most of the day and watched movies.  i did end up cooking her and her family breakfast, but oh well.  later that night we went out to dinner.  hardly any place had less than a two hour wait.  what made me mad though was that none of the places were smart enough to take reservations.  it would be much much easier if they just took freakin' reservations.    sunday was a blah day.  did scholarship crap most of the day and practiced.  saturday's the big day now... OH CRAP!!!  later.  demon halfling

       i called the college of music today thinking that i had to reserve a time for my legit audition.  well, come to find out, i don't.  but... my jazz studies audition is supposed to be post marked by february 23.    23rd?!?!?!?!?!?!?    where the hell is that on the website.  i called earlier back in january and they said as soon as i could.  that don't sound like february 23 to me.  it's safe to say that my stress level went through the roof.  the first words out of my mouth after i hung up the phone were, "HOLY FUCKING SHIT!!!"  so, now it's crame time.  i've given myself 10 days and counting to crame as much shit into this as i can and throw the fuck down come tape time.  well, it's on.  that's all i got to say.  later.  demon halfling throwing the fuck down for the next 10 days

       supersax jr. met again today.  we got another chart, groovin' high.  good dizzy tune... when played by dizzy, bird, and supersax.  supersax jr. on the other hand, had some problems.  it's ok though, we're still learning.  it's some hard stuff.  basically they took bird licks and harmonized them.  hard stuff, but fun too.  so far we got four of their charts: a night in tunisia, groovin' high, lover man, and salt peanuts.  all good tunes.  all very hard in this arrangement.  but still fun.  so there's the update on that.  later.  demon halfling

       so saturday angie cooked up this surprise for me.  i had no clue what it was.  all i knew was that kevin, dingus, and my mom knew what it was and said i would like it.  well, off we go.  so we're on our way down I-35 and this conversation ensues.  me: so is the exit regal row or royal lane? angie: it's royal.  i'm sure. me: you're totally sure? angie: uh huh.  twenty minutes, two exits, and a bunch of back roads later...  angie on phone with the mysterious place: so it's regal row?  ok.  thank you. me: laughing my head off. angie: shut up.  so we pulled into the parking lot for an indoor kart racing place.  HELL YES!!! we did three races on go-karts that might take off slow but speed up and power slide around turns like none other.  angie beat me all three times cause she got the faster of the two cars but i didn't care.  she was the coolest girlfriend ever because of this.    saturday night was the last night of hell to the nth.  it's over.  finally.  i'm free.  now i can get back to practicing for my audition.  i will say this though.  it's was fun the last night.  everything was actually ok.    one thing i know right now is that i'm not ready for solo and ensemble.  and i'm really not ready for my UNT audition.  but, there's still a month left for that and a lot can happen in a month.    later.  demon halfling slayer of wotan dominator of all lesser beings

       so it's obviously been a while since i've updated this blasted thing.  i'm just lazy.  really really lazy.  i'll skip over the first week inbetween this post and my last post.  that week was basically learning that jazz was not my top priority and that legit *insert choking sounds here* was.  basically, get ready for round two of auditions for UNT.  the live, legit one.  ok, so we'll pick up with tuesday of the week before UNT live and unplugged.      Tuesday    basically, this was legit cram day number one.  me and kevin worked on a movement after he got done with big band rehearsal and i was fairly surprised at how fast i was picking up the changes made.  if i played something wrong or out of tune or if it needed to be fingered differently, it took one, maybe two times and it was fixed and flawless.  ok, so that's two movements out of five that are pretty much ready to go for saturday.  i say two even though we worked on one because the second of the five was really really easy.      Wednesday    nothing really happened on this day.  practiced a little more on some legit i had to clean up.  and went on about my life.    Thursday    ah yes, rehearsal day with kevin number two.  first was combo pm rehearsal.  i met up with kevin and dingus at chipotle and then continued onto combo where i did ok on my solos.  nothing real special or anything, just monotone really.  some good ideas accompanied by some mediocre ideas accompanied by some bad ideas.  all in all, regular solo day for the halfling.  went back to kevin's house and worked on another movement of the legit audtion.  again, same thing happened.  changes were picked up in one to two runs and made clean.  kinda wierd that it's happening so fast, but i'm not gonna question it.      Friday    the final day.  i could already feel the nervousness taking hold of me.  my last practice with Mrs. Whitlow, even though she wasn't going to be there for the audition was total shit.  i seriously wanted to shoot myself in the head after that run through.  it was bad.  stupid mistakes and a bunch of other crap that was done out of nervousness and stupidity.  went to kevin's after school and we procrastinated a little bit and then finally hit that dreaded piece of crap for the last time before "UNT Live and Scared Shitless".  after that i needed to find some way to relax, so we went bowling.  i don't remember how i did, all i know was that i was my usual game where i might get a strike here and there, maybe a spare, but overall, i suck it up.  oh well, get some sleep and wake up early for "UNT Live and Scared Shitless!"    Saturday: UNT Live and Scared Shitless    now comes the meat of this post.  first off, 5:30 came way way way too early.  i had to be at UNT by 7:30 for registration and sign in.  after signing in inside the college of music in the commons, we went to one of the concert halls and watched an interview w/ Niel Slater and a tape of the One O'clock from one of their performances last year in the Murcheson Performing Arts Center.  well, the assistant dean of the college of music comes in and he greets us and has us watch another video about the college, but first, we get to watch a performance from a top notch flutist.  now she played good and deserves her props for being pretty much a total bad ass on flute, but honestly, i don't care about some junior flute player that can play.  all i care about is my audition that day.  if you're going to the college of music at UNT, you know the quality of people that are there, and it's nice to showcase them, but i would have personally rathered see a jazz combo or someone like that.  but that's just me.  so after the little meeting and video, it's time to keep me from being so overly nervous.   urlLink kevin  showed up a little after the meeting got out and we met up in the student union.  we walked around there for a little bit and then finally left to get something to eat cause all of us (me, kev, my dad) were starving.  so we went to a little coffee shop near the tomato and had muffins and coffee.  as it neared time to go audition, we headed back so i could get my horn out of the car and start warming up.  thankfully the horn wasn't that cold from sitting out in the car all morning.  next on our nervous as hell tour was the practice building.  you all have no clue how nerve racking it is to sit in one of those white practice rooms all alone and be scared that you're going to screw up.  what was sad was that there was writing and drawings of winged horses (yes,  winged horses ) on the walls of the room i was in.  however, there was no stand and you couldn't sit in the chair in there because it was being propped against the wall, and if it moved, it fell apart.  so it nears 10:40, and i wanted to be outside the room by 10:45, so i leave, i've had the pep talk from kevin and he's off posting flyers around the campus about the concert later that night, and my dad's in a jazz studies meeting that i should be at, but i'm warming up so i obviously can't be there.  i go to the room and i sit down and begin to reassemble my horn nervously.  i can hear the person that's in the room at the time.  so i'm sitting there trying to decide if it was all worth it to come here and whether or not i should run away now before anyone sees me, but i never got the chance to do that.  why you ask?  because the door opened up and the dude in there walked out, but who followed him, who?  the man himself.  Jim Riggs.  he walked out and asked if i was next.  i studdered but answered him about how i was supposed to go at 11 but if he would like i could go early.  then Eric Nestler walked out, the legit saxophone professor in the college.  he asked me random questions like where i was from and who i was taking from.  i was a bit surprised when they both recognized kevin, but whatever works.  so i go in... alone.  i didn't have an accompanist, it was just me... solo.  they asked me a few more questions like what i wanted to do and what not, and then it started.  i played the first movement.  they said they liked what they heard.  the only kicker was that Riggs said good.  anyone who knows what the means knows that i was even more nervous after that.  i played the second movement.  only one flub.  that's four flubs by now.  way way more than what there needed to be.  i continue on to the third movement.  two more flubs.  i'm up to six now.  then , they stopped and said that was good.  HAHAHAHAHAHA!!!  didn't have to play all fifteen minutes of that damned thing.  but, i'm not done.  oh no.  not done at all.  next up... sightreading.  but not just any old sightreading.  oh no, in this piece, every other note is an accidental.  well, i looked at it and touched (yes, i touch accidentals) all the accidentals and stuff and then played.  oh it was fairly bad by my standards.  it ended on a B double flat.   A B DOUBLE FLAT!!!   at least i hit it though.  so i didn't look too bad in front of them.  it was over, i was done.  i walk outside to pack up and  urlLink kevin  is sitting outside, so Riggs, Nestler, and he talk and b.s. while i pack up.  i was almost done.  my dad walks up and we leave to go put my horn in the car and go to the aural (not to be confused w/ oral, which some have said) skills test.  come to find out, me and kevin had way over prepared for this.  we had done interval training and chord recoginition and all the test contained was someone not being tone deaf and trying to tell if there was a difference harmonically or rhymthically between two music examples.  i was finally done then.  we left and hit some major traffic on the way to chipotle (where else would we end this ordeal?).  after that it was onward to home, to prepare for the concert and angie's prom.    the concert went ok and i had a fun time at angie's prom.  to find out more about the concert, go  urlLink here .  then, spring break started.  to find out more about that, go  urlLink here .  and this post is finally done.  it took close to two weeks to do because i was so damn lazy.  anywho, i'm out.  later  demon halfling  P.S. - oh yeah, this is a dingus sized post

       So last night was Lab Band Madness up at my future alma mater, UNT.  Dingus showed up at my house and we car pooled over to CCCC where we then car pooled with Keving up to the concert.  We ended up getting there at the intermission, so for me and Dingus, we didn't have to pay for our tickets.  Sweet deal.  We had just missed the Two O'Clock.  It's ok though cause I've heard them twice this year already.  Once at the North Texas Fall Preview and again at Lab Band night at the Syndicate, which hopefully next year, I'll be gigging there.  So as we drew closer to Denton, and dark dark cloud sat upon the horizon.  First words when we noticed it was, "Now that does not look very good."  Little did we know.  When we hit Denton and drew even closer to UNT, the bottom fell out.  It was quite a torrential downpour but I'm sure Kevin was hating it having to get out and fill up his car with gas. Then, when we found the parking spot with the most direct line to the door of the Murcheson we ran.  We got wet, but not really as bad as it could have been.  We then checked in with one of the lady's that was working the CD booth to see if she had the copies of Suma Foosball Festival, but she said that she had left them in the jazz office.  But she did say that if the rain let up that she would go get it, and sure enough, after the concert, she had it.  WHOO - HOO!!!  One down, one to go.  All I lack at that point is a horn to play it on.  Ok, back to the concert.  Since we got there for intermission, we saw the last half of the concert.  The Three O'Clock opened up the second half with Blame El Nino, then Blues in my Shoes, followed by Chelsea Bridge, and finally ESP.  When we were at lab band night a few weeks ago, they played three of those songs, and I have to say that they sounded miles ahead of where they were then.  I throughly enjoyed them.    The Ji - Young Lee lab band followed them.  I have no clue what number this is, but that's the point is not to know which lab band is what unless it's the top three.  Ji - Young Lee is the piano player in the One O'Clock.  Her group was good.  They played A View From the Side and a really cool arrangement of Love For Sale.    They were followed by the Nine O'Clock, but you're not supposed to know that remember.  It's all to keep preconcieved notions away about who's better than who.  If you're in a lab band, you're good in your own right.  Nuff said. They were directed by Idit Shner.  Don't know who that is, but that's who they were billed under.  They played Pegasus and Groovin' Hard.  I really dug the Groovin' Hard sax soli, good job guys.   Next came the One O'Clock.  That's when I wanted to quit.  They're so good.  I think if I just keep telling myself that I'll get in it by the second semester of my senior year of first semester of my first grad year, I just might have a chance.  But yeah, they're really awesome.  They played, There Will Never Be Another You, followed by Young and Foolish, followed by the dreaded Time For A Change.  I fear this song for one reason.  Soloing in 9/4 time.  It's not fun and takes a lot more thinking that I apparently was giving it.  So of course, since it's the One O'Clock, it was miles and miles ahead of where I played it.  Next came a piece written by a dude that Kevin went to school with called Girls In The Pool.  Good Piece.  It seemed like it would be fun to play.  Next came Places.  It's a Niel Slater chart.  It's in the LMOJO book, but after hearing them play it, I'm almost scared to play it just because I've heard them do it live.  Next was Love At Sundown.  Followed by Cherokee.  Me and Dingus were both thinking that it would be the one in our book back in LMOJO cause I heard the Two O'Clock do it.  Boy was I wrong.  The Alto soloist gets up there and after the opening lick, I felt like I would never be at his level.  EVER!  It was that sick of a solo.  So so awesome.    Well, the concert ended and we stepped outside to find that our copies of Suma Foosball Festival were awaiting us.  Me and Dingus looked over the parts eagerly while Kevin talked to J - Guar.  Then, off to the Tomato.  Best pizza and bread sticks ever.  After a while, the guy with the tenor I'm borrowing for Suma Foosball Festival shows up and the exchange is made.  Our plan is now complete.  Look out world, it's tenor duel of the century.  Kevin vs. the Halfling.  One shall stand, one shall fall.  (Not really, but it sounds cool.)  But I'm all kinds of fired up about playing it.  It's gonna be fun.    Later,   Halfling

       So last Monday I got my acceptance e-mail from UNT about the College of Music and my major.  WHOOO HOOOO!!!  I literally woke everyone up in my house at 11 at night to tell them about it.   urlLink Angie  was on the phone when I read it so she found out first and  urlLink Kevin  quickly found out because I was talking to him online.  The next day, I got the hard copy that they send you in the mail.  So it's official, and no, they're not taking this one away from me, I'm in.  Last Saturday  urlLink Angie  and I went all the way out to freaking A&M Commerce to take the SAT again.  My God that's a long and boring drive.  Good thing I had  urlLink Angie  to keep me company.  After that we went up to the  urlLink Hawaiian Falls  Job Fair and applied for jobs as lifeguards since they train their own and it seems like it would be a fun job to do during the summer.  In fact,  urlLink Angie  got a call last night from them saying that she got the job.  YAY FOR HER!!!  I'm hoping that I'll get called pretty soon about it.  I'm hoping I get it that way I don't have to work at my mom's office.  I would rather be outside than locked up in a dumb building all day.    Sunday I did a whole lot of nothing.  Monday was highlighted by getting the e-mail.  Tuesday was highlighted by getting the hard copy of the e-mail, plus,  urlLink Kevin  and I went to the new  urlLink Chipotle  out near SMU to celebrate and support a good cause, the  urlLink SPCA .  They had a couple of dogs there outside the resturant for people to walk up and see.  The idea was that you donate 5 dollars to the  urlLink SPCA  and you got a free burrito and drink in return.  Not a bad deal at all, and like I said, it's for a good cause, and if you get a free burrito out of it, then i support the cause all the way.  Afterwards, since this particular  urlLink Chipotle  was near CD Source (which I had never been to), we decided to make a quick stop there.  I picked up 2 cds.  1) Herbie Hancock - Head Hunters I've wanted this CD for a while, and now I have it.    2) John Coltrane - Impressions This isn't the original Impressions CD, which is evident by the fact that it's a live recording, it's mono, not stereo, and it's in a different key.  Still good playing, but wierd.    Today at school has been a whole lot of nothing.  Government was boring.  Piano was piano.  I've decided to give up trying to prepare Clare de Lune for the Piano Recital sometime in May for a jazz piano tune with some improve at the end.  I'm sure my improve might suck since there's no chords written out.  Oh well.  English was interesting.  A whirlpool was created within the EO.  They were presenting their project about a poem, and they didn't have much to say.  It was fairly evident from the beginning because their poster that they had was really good, which showed that people at the intelecutal level of their's, spent all their time on the poster and not the actual poem itself.  I do have to say though, this poster was quite graphic.  The poem was about a boy who cuts his arm off with a chain saw.  Wierd, yes, I know.  So what did they put on the poster?  A fake, bloody arm.  Then, when it came time to actually talk about the poem, no one had anything to say.  Apparently one of them actually knew the poem because after they sat down, the teacher asked a question about it and one of them knew the answer.  Then the whirlpool started.  One of the others in the group complained about how if she knew the poem, then why didn't she talk?  It went something like this...  Fishy #1: *answers question* Fishy #2: Why didn't you say that when we were up there? Fishy #1: You told me not to say anything. Fishy #2: *snide remark* We thought you wanted to be in our group. Fishy #1: Well you thought wrong.  The teacher broke it up at this point, but it was obvious that a tidal wave of hate was growing within the EO.  They even went so far as to bring others that are in the EO, but nearly as annoying into their little tiff with slandiferous comments made behind their backs.  I could only ask myself this... Would you expect less from people who are popular and care about themselves more than anyone in this world?  My answer... NO!!!  Now here i sit in webmastering with Johnny sharing some bad dead baby jokes that I'm chosing not to hear because of my non-humorous outlook on those kinds of jokes.  Nothing really to do.    Tonight's combo up at CCCC.  Tomorrow I have my challenge for lead in LMOJO.  All I gotta do is look over the part that Greg picked for it.  It's the same thing he's picked for every other challenge, but when we actually tried to play the piece, he sucked all over the part.  He's beaten me and Johnny with this piece yet he still sucks on it.  Anyone see something wrong with that?  Oh well.  I'll just play my best and hope for the same.    That's it for now.  Later.  Demon Halfling  P.S.  I've decided to start posting with correct grammar because I'm sick of hearing you people complain.

       Today was my last official day of high school.  HELL YEAH!!!  What better way to have the day start than to wake up five minutes before you have to leave.  Let me be the first to say that it's not fun.  When I wake up late, it totally throws off my day.  I'm in a bad mood cause I'm mad at myself for being late mostly, but I confuse myself for a bit and tell myself that my parents (even though, for the record, it's not their fault but mine) should have woken me up on time.  I think my mom actually did try though, so I can't blame them even if I wanted to.  My anger got out quick though on the way to school.  Here I am driving along Chaha when this truck comes roaring up behind me and gets right on my ass.  I hate that.  Especially when they can't go around cause they feel that they have to get as close as they can because you just know that will make you go faster to match their speed. WRONG YOU ARROGANT SON OF A B****!!!  So... back to my story.  He gets up on my ass and I, being in the bad mood that I'm in, slam on my brakes and just yell out a big flurry of cuss words (Yes, I'm acting like a high school senior at that point).  I think he backed off after I did that cause in the process of yelling out my curses, I'm pretty sure that I made some foul hand gestures.  But, like I said, bad mood + morning + tailgater = pissed off Halfling.  That pretty much got it all out of my system though because I was fine afterwards when I got to school.    The rest of the day was quite good considering I got out at 11:30.  Ahh, that was bliss.  I came home and took a nice long nap.  I believe I woke up just before 4:00.  I enjoyed it very much.  I took the shower that I didn't get to take this morning and then went to Angie's house.  Spent my time there till 10:45 when I came home.  What I came home to was my official postcard from UNT saying that I'm in Bruce Hall.  So, it is official.  So, now I just gotta fight to get my parking sticker that costs $140.  It's all good though.    Aight, I'm out for now.  There's soon to be an update on how my high school career has been, so I'll get around to that eventually.    Until next time,  Later.

       Well, it's been quite a while since I last posted on here.  So I guess I'll give you all an update.  Lifeguard training was fun.  The first day we did about four hours of CPR, then the next day we spent it at the sport complex next to CCCC doing water rescues, and then finished up on the last day with some testing and more water rescues.    The CCCC jazz concert was fun.  It lasted a long time though.  Two and a half hours.  I was fairly happy with my solos, so it was worth it.  Props to Kevin, Dingus, and Jazzy G.  They all did well in their ensembles.  We went to Chili's afterwards.  It was the biggest crowd I'd ever seen there.  Kris Berg even showed up.  I think it ended up being about 20 people (give or take).    The Lakeview Jazz concert went ok also.  Kevin and me had a blast playing foosball, even if most of the band couldn't play it.  Our cadenza was rocking.  Dingus said that had it been longer, he could have finished his masters.  I had no concept of time though cause I was just living in that moment.  It was awesome.  Lee did good on Wave.  I enjoyed listening to it.  Dingus and Mr. Woodrow played I'll Be Around, and did quite well on it.  That was the first time that I'd ever heard Mr. Woodrow solo before.  He's really, really good.  William did well on Aries Eyes.  I was happy to see how far he's progressed in the past year.  Johnny played Cruisin' for a Bluesin'.  It's got a hard soli that wasn't completely clean, but it's all good.  He did a good job of soloing.  Overall the concert was pretty good.  We went to Taco Cabana afterwards for a bit, but I had to get Angie home, so I didn't stay too long.  School's officially pointless now.  Not that it wasn't before, but now it is officially.  With all three AP tests done (English V, Government, and Economics), we reduced ourselves to watching movies and sleeping.  Not that I'm complaining about not having to do work, but in all honesty, I could just do that from the comfort of my own home instead of a cold school in a hard plastic chair.    Today is the Grapevine Jazz Festival.  I'm thinking we will do fairly well there.  I guess it all depends on how we feel.  Thankfully we're not playing at some unknown hour of the morning like we did on the band trip.  This time we're playing at 6:00 PM.  I'll let y'all know how it went later.    That's about it for now.    Later.  Halfling

       It's been quite a while, but I'm back.  I was never really gone, just lazy and unavailable to update.  But anyways, back to the title of the post.    At Hawaiian Falls, we believe that we are open until 6:00 no matter what.  Yes, even in the pouring rain, we're open.  Like last Saturday for instance.  It rained for three hours, but of course, we were open for business.  You couldn't ride any of the rides for obvious reasons, but people were still allowed into the park.  Now begs the question, who would go to a water park on a day that it's supposed to rain?  I mean really, use some common sense and look at the forecast before you go.  It's on the news, the internet, and the radio.  I'm betting that at some point, you, the genius coming to the park, will use one of those three devices.  So, when they figure out that it's going to rain right when they've already paid their money, they come and complain to who else but the lifeguards, because you just know that we, the minimum wage lifeguard, cause magically wave our hands and get them a refund.  Sorry, but it's not my fault you decided to come to a water park on the day it rained.  Now, onward to today, where the weather actually got so bad that we did in fact, close down the park.  It was raining cats and dogs, and what better event to have happen than for some family to lose their five year old daughter.  Here's what confused most of the lifeguard staff, who just happened to be the ones that were volunteered to run around in the rain looking for her.  Her parents told us one name, and then five minutes later, turned around and told us a different name.  So we had to run around looking for both names.  Well, we tore that park inside out trying to find this poor girl.  We saw a dark spot in the river so one of the head guards jumped in to check it out while I raced around to the other side just in case we ended up having to life someone or something out on the side.  I would have stayed where the guard had gotten in, except that it was on the other side of a rope and near the wave machine.  Thankfully it turned out to be a dirt spot or a drain or something like that.  Then we started worrying about there being a child predator in the park, which is not cool since our main attraction is children.  Well, after a bit more searching, we end up at the catch pool for pipeline.  So I go in, being the brave soul that I am, because remember, we're getting in the water to look for this kid while it's raining, thundering, and most of all, there's lightning in the sky all over the place.  So I go over and dive down under the slides and all that to no avail.  Only when I get out of the catch pool, do we hear that the family has left, meaning that they more than likely have their child with them.  I just risked my life for someone that was already found and they didn't bother to tell anyone.  MORONS!!!  That kinda put a dark mood on the day.  It was still raining when we finally closed down for the day around 2:45.  I'm convinced that all of the lifeguards are going to be sick because we were all shivering and wet from the rain.    After this ordeal, I went home and warmed up, then practiced for a bit, then picked up Angie, and then went to Cassie's where me, Angie, Cassie, and Dingus watched Titanic (barf) and Anastasia.  Now, here I sit, returning to the blog world.    That's all for now.  Later.  Halfling

       Jazz camp came to an end on Friday.&nbsp; It was a very fun week and whether or not I'm better next year, I sure will be back.&nbsp; I enjoyed myself very much.&nbsp; What's not to like about it?&nbsp; You get to play jazz for an ENTIRE WEEK!!!&nbsp; That just appeals to me so much more than work.&nbsp;    urlLink Kevin Mahogany  was there on opening night.&nbsp; Man can that man sing.&nbsp; He's so great.&nbsp; He's a wonderful person too.&nbsp; It's good to know that he's a warm hearted as he looks.&nbsp;  urlLink Angie  and I wound up getting his autograph after the concert when he stopped to talk to  urlLink Kev  as we were all leaving.&nbsp; I would really like to play with him sometime just because he seems like a real fun person to play with.&nbsp;   Monday was a regular day.&nbsp; The faculty band played that night.&nbsp; They were of course, awesome.&nbsp; I also found out what classes and band I was in.&nbsp; I wound up in Arranging, Dave Von Blohn's band (which was the second band, but I don't mind), and Advanced Improv.&nbsp; They were all quite helpful.&nbsp; I kind of questioned Lee Tombulin's improv teaching techniques at the beginning but he soon explained exactly what he was doing and made it all make sense.&nbsp;   Tuesday was a regular day with a very bad event.&nbsp;  urlLink Kev  and I had just arrived back at the college to go to the Frank Mantooth tribute concert when I recived a call from  urlLink Angie .&nbsp; I couldn't understand what  urlLink Angie  was saying however because she was yelling and screaming into the phone because she had just gotten in a wreck on I-75.&nbsp; NOT GOOD!!!&nbsp; So, in true best friend fashion,  urlLink Kev  lends me his car and I quickly speed over to her.&nbsp; Her car is totalled and she and her friend Rachael are a mess.&nbsp; Well, we finish up there and she goes home with her dad, and I head back to the concert to catch probably the last 2 and a half minutes of the last song.&nbsp; I guess it's a good thing I watched the rehearsal.&nbsp;   Wendesday was CD release day.&nbsp; They released the faculty CD from last year and played a few tunes from it.&nbsp; They closed in true CCCC Jazz style with none other than, The Chicken, or as it as promptly called for the night, Mechanically Seperated Chicken Parts, which means it was thrasched.&nbsp;   Thursday was the  urlLink Byron Stripling  concert.&nbsp; He gave a clinic earlier on in the day and it truely opened  urlLink Kev's  and my eyes.&nbsp; We realized that we wanted to be at that level of near perfection and decided to set out together to accomplish our goal.&nbsp; So, from now on, unless we're on vacation, it's a daily task to practice like none other.&nbsp;   Friday was the camp band concert.&nbsp; My band ended up opening up for the faculty.&nbsp; I hated my solo, even listening back I found that I hated what I played.&nbsp; Others said it sounded fine, but not to me.&nbsp; Hopefully someday that will change and I too, will like what I play.&nbsp;   Saturday was my relax day.&nbsp; I slept in late and did a whole lot of nothing except practice.&nbsp; Later that night I went with  urlLink Angie  and my family to the  urlLink Mesquite Rodeo .&nbsp; It's been a while since I've been there, but it was fun none the less.   Today was begin shopping for college day.&nbsp; I picked up a wireless keyboard and mouse set and a  urlLink PalmOne Zire 31 PDA .&nbsp; It's quite cool to say the least.&nbsp; Ended up seeing I, Robot with  urlLink Angie  and Rachael.&nbsp; It's an excellent movie.&nbsp; I suggest that you all go and see it.&nbsp;   Well, that's all for now.  Later.  Halfling

       For the second Wednesday, I've woken up sick and had to miss work.  Not cool seeing as how I don't get paid very much as it is.  Last time it was just a sickness to the stomache, this time I actually began to throw up.  Three times I left the inside of my stomache in the toilet.  I felt better after doing that, but I think I got a bad burrito, which I didn't think existed.  I don't know why it happened, but it did.  It's always on a Wednesday too.  Never any other day, just Wednesday.  It's a curse I tell you.    After I got to feeling better, I did my chores for the day, and since Angie and I are going to have a picnic at the Dallas Whosawhatsit, I mowed the lawn.  And by the way, thanks to all of you who left me messages hoping I felt better, it made me smile.    After a while Angie came over and we watched Piglet's Big Movie with my sister and mom.  She left and now here I sit.    Got a road trip in a few days, it's gonna be awesome.  I just can't wait.  That's about all for now.  Later.  Halfling
