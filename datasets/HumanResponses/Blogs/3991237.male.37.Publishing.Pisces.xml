						   Today,  urlLink Car Explosion Kills One Near Tenn. Hotel .  And  urlLink a pipe bomb exploded in a Manhattan subway station on Monday .  I've also read (but can't find confirmation of, to link to) that a pipe bomb exploded in Atlanta this morning (no damage/injuries) and they suspected there was a second- until they found the second, leaning against a building.  Is this important?

						   Now here's something I never would have suspected-  urlLink Sammy Hagar's  federal campaign contributions .  And this after hearing multiple brush-with-drunken-greatness stories over the weekend about what an ass he was to multiple people.

						   Really awesome post at  urlLink IRAQ THE MODEL . The parts in bold are Ali's 'edits and corrections' to the 'Not in Our Name' manifesto.  The whole thing is hysterical (not just because a native-Arabic-speaker is correcting a document written by Americans).  Money quote:   President Bush has declared: "you’re either with us or you’re against us."  (We hate him so much by the way but this is not personal!)  Here is our answer:  We are against you even if it means we’re with the terrorists because we don’t mean to be with them!  We refuse to allow you to speak for all the American people. We will not give up our right to question. We will not hand over our consciences in return for a hollow promise of safety. We say Don't free them, NOT IN OUR NAME. We refuse to be party to these wars and we repudiate any inference that they are being waged in our name or for our welfare. We extend a hand to those around the world suffering from these policies; we will show our solidarity in word and deed,  but excuse us if we can’t come closer to you because frankly, WE DON’T GIVE A SHIT.

						   What do you say in your first-ever blog posting?    Hi, please come back if this is the only post you see.  If this is the oldest of a bunch of posts, then yes, this was the first post.  You have reached the end of the internet, please go back now.  Soon there will be a wealth of current events commentary, irritating observations, and other nonsense.  I have big plans.

						   If you heard someone say "Muslims living in the U.S. are currently, in my opinion, in a special situation. Perhaps they do not walk the streets with weapons in their hands or attach bombs to themselves in order to carry out a suicide operation, but the thought is there", would you think they were a wacko right-wing racist?   urlLink You'd be wrong.
