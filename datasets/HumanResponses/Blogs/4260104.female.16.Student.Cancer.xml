      so yesterday i woke up at like 12ish. emily called and we called zack and talked for like 2 hours, and we all agreed that we luv rachel clift  (man were gona have a big phone bill 3 way and long distance)  . then amber called and wanted me to go over. i went over ambers and we watched a movie, ate dinner, jumped on her trampoline, made a sand castle in her sandbox, jumped some more on the trampoline, went for a bike ride, watched the olympics   (yay! paul hamm)  , and stayed up till 2ish, then when i was on the verg of falling to sleep i realized that i had left my bike outside, so i woke up amber and we went out side at like 2:30 and she carried it in the house insted of opening the garage so she didn't wake her mom up   (i luv amber so much shes the best)  . my mom called around 9ish this morning and woke amber up. amber thought she said that she wanted me home by 10:15 to watched kids because she had a thai cooking class to go to. so we assumed that she wanted me to ride my bike so i was like i' m not riding my bike home that early in the morning. so i was gona call my mom and ask her to pick me up but i fell back asleep. when i woke up again it was 10:19 and i woke amber up and we were like crap so i tried to call my mom and ask her to pick me up but josh told me she and jackie had left to pick up the subrben from dads work, so i tried to call jackies cell but no 1 pick up, then i called josh back and he said that she was already going to pick me up   (what a waist of all that phone calling energy)   . so mom picked me up with a refresing caramel swirl iced latte   (i luv my mom).   when we got home she told me that she had told amber that she would pick me up at 10:15   (grrr i could have slept till she rang the door bell)   that leaves me hear now watching the little ones, siping my iced latte, with hope of going school shoping well thats all for now    ~Mandi~
