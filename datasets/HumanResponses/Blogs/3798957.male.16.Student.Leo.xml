       That rant I mentioned, here it is. People don't seem to like their parents. They don't want to have anything to do with them. I cannot understand why. I never distanced myself from my parents for the sole reason that they were parents, and I don't regret. I have lots of fun with my parents, my relatives, that kind of thing. I've gone to movies with my mom, and I don't mind because it was fun. I've never realy seen any reason to hate my parents unless they do something I really disagree with. This might be why most kids I know don't like their parents or hold them in some amount of contempt, becuase they're worse than my parents. Maybe, but I doubt it, because I've seen very few cases where the parents in question actually deserve all that emnity. I think it all has to do with the angst. God, angst.. A lot of people I know seem to think that being a teenager is just so gosh darn hard! But it's not. I don't think so, and look at me, I'm a fucking teenager. Let's address a few common concerns. 1. School- Okay, maybe not as big as a concern as I think, considering a lot of the grades I see. But it's not very hard either. Just quit dicking around all the time and pay attention to what you're doing. 2. Girls- I've seen people make and lose relationships all around me while my life has remained romantically devoid. Therefore, I have an objective viewpoint on this issue. It doesn't seem very hard either. I've had some issues with friends before, and they seem like the same kind of things you'd run into here. Basically, look for someone that you can tell you like. I've had some crushes, although I think I might have formed them just becuase it seemed to me like something I was supposed to do. I'm only really attracted to one girl, because if I don't hate them I'm pretty sure they hate me concerning the rest of the available population. Anyway, I think you should always be honest, brutally if need be, and find someone who can accept that. Beyond that, just don't be a dickwad and things generally seem to work out. 3. Jobs- Work is easy. You go in, tell someone you wanna do what they do here, maybe you'll get lucky and get a chance. In that case, it's hardly any different from school. Try real hard and find a job you like, so then work can be easy and fun. I thought there would be more reasons, but I already did parents, and that's all the things it seems like someone could stress about. Anyway, between all these things, some people get pretty fucked up. You ever seen a goth? Fucking angst. Even if it's not a goth, just any wanker who spews bullshit like "oh life is so stressful, I just feel like  I'm about to break. " That's the key phrase there at the end. Whenever you hear that, you should slap whatever head it came out of. It's only a problem because they let it, perhaps even because they let it be. Goths are still the worst though. Especially when they convince themselves that "holy shit! I must have been a demon in another life! If I act real fucked up and make the world less savory this time around, I could reclaim my rightful place and taste true power!" Those shitheads are the absolute worst of all. They think they're so special because they made up a story to explain their own idiocy. You may notice I talk like I consider MYSELF superior, and that's because I kind of do. You may say, "oh, he probably just doesn't understand! What right does he have to talk smack about people he doesn't even know?" That's a pretty good point, except I have constitutional rights, thank you very much. The thing is, I find myself nervous for feeling this way, but I think that I am slightly superior to the average person because I identify negative trends and rise above them. People thought I had some pretty nasty depression for a while. Thie was because I was caught slitting my wrists with scissors in 6th grade. I did this because I was curious to see if they would spray everywhere. Everyone around me decided I must be depressed, and I let myself think it, and went to therapy for a while. Now this therapy was expensive, I realized. I also realized that the pills and little talks weren't doing a whole lot. Nothing, in fact. Except give me horrible stomachaches. The pills did that. So, I stepped back and took a look, because, hey, if I was depressed, pills and therapy should be making me feel different, right? They did nothing, so I figured nothing was wrong, and you know what? I was probably right. Because I am a happy fellow. I smile every day. The suggestion was never put forth again that I was depressed because of a fucked up brain. To this day, I belive that the reason I acted dumb in the first place was because someone else stamped the idea into my malleble brain that I must be sad for no reason. Think about that.

       I'll try and keep any further posts less wordy. I was looking at that as I wrote and I said, "damn, I like to talk." Probably too much.

       Arr.. screw it, I've got nothing better to do. Lucky you, you get to be filled in with the rest of my amazing journeys! There isn't much to report about Valley City. It's pretty small. The biggest source of excitement while I was there was the "downtown," which consisted of pretty much the only area that wasn't houses, but businesses. There was a place with pizza. Some of the notable things there were: -There is no soda in VC. There is, however, an abundance of something called "pop." -There is some kind of incredible population of prairie dogs and deer in the area. There are enough deer hit by cars each year to account for just about every driver in VC. -OMFG pelicans! Holy crap! Pelicans seemed like a joke before, like homosexual ogres or something. -The greatest population of geezers I have ever seen. It's almost a sad story, really. The cycle began with strapping young couples buying rich, lucrative farmland long ago. The womanfolk apparently got fed up with it or something, and they either died or moved away. So now, you have a dying generation of mostly childrenless old men that own all the farmland in VC. Obviously, entertaining legal battles will follow their deaths. Well, not excatly entertaining, more like [adjective that describes the loss of faith in the human race]. (If you know of one, by all means let me know, I'll use it often, no doubt.) -I saw, at a mall, two diamond stores directly across the hall from eachother. I really want that adjective. -There was a liquor store with a drive-thru that looked to have been converted from a carwash. The sign on it said, "driver must be 21 to enter." I'm not sure what it was about it, it seems like a sensible idea, but every member of my family laughed at it when we went through.(By the way, I don't drink, smoke, or indulge in other things that the tv says is bad for you. But I did it before it was cool.) -The mosquitos were considerably smaller than the Alaska breed, and of a tan coloration. I laughed(and occasionaly swore) at their feeble and merely annoying attempts. Alaska mosquitos are our fucking state birds. -Mountain Dew seems to be popular down there. It was served almost everywhere I went, and some people had Dew Hoodies. This filled my soul with warmth and my bladder with torment as I relished the opportunity. Often, I have to settle for Root Beer at establishments up here. Soon, it was time for us to leave. So, we boarded a plane and went to Denver, where we would then catch a plane to Seattle and drive to Tacoma. There was another baby. In Denver, there were foot traffic jams in the airport. When I wasn't fuming, I was laughing inside. However, I began to develop an acute paranoia of pickpockets, recalling just about every movie I have ever seen featuring a large city. I assume my jerky, wild-eyed glares at passerby and people behind me in line, all while nervously fingering whatever was hidden in my pockets(I love pockets. I literally don't think I could leave my house without a good set of pockets. I choose pants based around this criteria and barely even glance in mirrors. If I don't have enough pockets, I toss on a hoodie with an abundant pouch, or grab my little bike bag/satchel that goes everywhere with me.). Many things were, and generally are, indeed sequestered away in them. Most of them, with some imagination and determination, could even be lethal. Luckily, I possess an abundance of both. Fortunately, I escaped the villanous hive of scum and villany that is the Denver International Airport with my belongings intact. I ate McDonalds. In Chicago, there was a place called the Billy Goat Grill, or some sort of combination of the words Billy, Goat, Gruff, and Grill. I forget. Anyway, they made a fine cheeseburger, and some pretty good fries as well. Babies. There were Babie s  on this flight. See that fuckin' "s" there? That denotes plural. Each additional child increased my hatred of everything around me exponentially. In Seattle, we were welcomed by our aunt and uncle there. All of our family in Seattle and Tacoma is really great. They're very open and fun-loving, and it's always a treat to visit them. Anyway, we drove by an oriental-themed carwash, which struck me as notable. We did some neat stuff. A trip to the zoo was involved. You may be thinking, "Dude, you're 16 and you go to the zoo with your mom and grandma? What in the fuck?!" That's a good-sized rant altogether, I think, and I may get off on that tangeant later. In fact, I'll make a point of it. So, the zoo was neat. We saw a lady in a wheelchair with a seeing-eye poodle. Another first. A bird had built it's nest inside the observation building for the marine mammals and kept flitting in and out while we marveled at the antics of the walrus, which consisted largely of meandering about on a pretty much set circuit around his pool. Later, a bunch of people came to my aunt/uncle's house, and we had a fire in the backyard with barbecued meats, and sang songs and such. Of particular note was the time we spent in Seattle proper, when we saw some of the sights and visited Gameworks. Gameworks is a large chain of arcades, with an interesting system of payment- you pay and get a little card with so much credit on it. The card works for just about every machine in the place. Mon-Fri a timed card was available, so you could play free for ridiculously cheap rates until your hours were up, and that was neat because I conquered House of the Dead 3, which was annoying because not even zombies should be able to withstand upwards of four-five shotgun blasts in their goddamn face, and later I came back with a 25-dollar card and played DDR until my lungs bled. This is one of my favorite pasttimes. I often visit a neighborhood theater where for .50 I can play 4/5 songs, I forget,(DDR Extreme, the best version) with extras unlocked. One thing of note was that we were technically not allowed to share cards as we were flatly informed at the front desk. I asked if they had people hovering behind us to make sure that we kept our cards to ourselves at all times, because I couldn't really see any other way to insure that their policy was obeyed, and I was answered cryptically with "there are a lot of people on the floor." I spent a lot of my visit glancing behind me. I also had the opportunity to visit the Scifi Museum/Hall of Fame, which was fan-fucking-tabulous. Pretty much everywhere you went, you could find some kind of street musician or performer. The interesting thing was, they were all  really  good. I mean it. These are probably the guys you hear about who are "just waiting for their big break." They were good. There was one guy with a saxophone standing on a corner near a steaming grate while we wandered around looking for a diner that served clam chowder. He really set the mood, cause it was getting kind of dark. Down by the market, there were a few fellows with a parrot. The parrot was leaping and gallivanting about on top of some flat platform they had set out, and there was one guy leaning on a piano having a smoke break. I assumed that, of course, they would play the piano and the bird frolicked more or less in tune. Right now it seemed to be doing fine without the actual music. There was also a nice man who asked us for directions and then offered to sell us drugs. There was kind of a large park where the museum and Imax theater(we saw Harry Potter 3) were situated, and we encountered some regular old hobos, as well as a pudgy old man wearing a rather intense scowl. This was complemented by the intricate four-foot balloon hat nestled on his head, and the balloon animals festooning the walls of his stall. On our way back to our quarters, we happened to see yet  another  city personality- the raving lunatic. The disheveled fellow clutched some sort of scepter in one hand, and a large cardboard sign in the other. He held the scepter up high and wobbled it about a little while shouting his nonsensicals. His sign mentioned the Seattle government, police force, and several variations of the word "communist." He was approached by someone as we walked by avoiding eye contact, and asked if he made the scepter himself. I believe he said he did. It was a rather nice looking piece, too, I remember. Finally, we had to leave. On the flight home, we are accompanied by the most obnoxious baby yet. At this point, I have all but conquered both of the new gameboy games I bought for the trip, I cannot find the batteries for my CD player, and I have voraciously consumed the contents of every book within reach. I busy myself by pondering why the baby has to wail so damn much. Obviously, as a start, the baby is dumb, and this is the only way it can communicate with the world, with which it appears rather displeased at the moment. However, as the flight wears on, it becomes apparent from being forced to listen to the continued noise, which is becoming more and more throaty and raspy, that it must also be causing quite a bit of discomfort to the child as well. I therefore conclude that the fiend continues its wailing and shrieking because it so delights in the particular and extreme discomfort that it instills in other people, that it will continue to do so even until it causes itself pain. I am struck with the idea that an extra pillow or two might help, and contemplate the proper placement to insure complete blockage of oxygen to the body.

       Okay, my first real post will be exciting and special. What a treat! We left Ted Stevens Int'l Airport at around 7:30ish. During all the associated lines before that, we were trailed closely by a woman and her baby. This instilled an early feeling of dread in my soul, because as everyone know, plane rides with babies are not any fun at all. Especially for me, because I  really  don't like children of any age. I was right of course, as the damned thing set up it's wailing almost on cue as we hit cruising altitude, and never stopped. Why does it have to be that the first thing to work good in kids are their lungs? Anyway, I stumbled out of the plane when we touched down in Chicago, where we were switching planes. There was  another  fucking baby on board this one. In fact, I'm pretty sure that of each of the five planes I rode on this trip, each one had at least one wailing child on board. I was not a happy camper, to say the least. The baby from Chicago to Grand Forks, ND provided some modicum of amusement at least. It was seated right behind me, not the amusing part by any means, but the interaction between it and it's mother was interesting. Apparently it had a bit of an obsession with hair, because at several points during the trip, the mother's voice would cut through the screams to inform it that, indeed, it  had  taken hold of mommy's hair and was hurting mommy. Every now and then these proclamations would be followed by a squawk and then renewed noise from the beast, along with "you see? That hurts, doesn't it! That's what you're doing to mommy." This made me smile because I knew that pain was coming to a creature whose existence displeased me. My elation was dimmed somewhat when I glanced behind me and saw the thing's eyes fixed on me, grubby paws extended and grasping feebly. I felt rather disgusted at the prospect of having the damnable thing sieze hold of my bare arm suddenly and then enduring the contempt-filled gazes of an entire plane as I immediately wrenched the hands away. The contempt wouldn't be so bad, I deal with that on an almost daily basis. Anyway, my family(the standard complement, a mom, dad, and brother.) and I arrive at the Grand Forks airport, where a local aunt comes and drives us to Valley City, home of my grandma. I have never met this aunt, nor heard mention of her that I can recall. While this may have worried most people, it doesn't faze me because I'm rather used to family cropping up unexpectedly. See, my grandma had 13 kids, including my dad, and most of them are also married with children, perhaps even grandchildren in a few cases. My mom's side of the family is comparatively much smaller, but with both of them combined I have the most cousins this side of Arkansas. Hell, I've got nephews, and I'm 16. But I digress. Over the hills and through the towns, to grandmother's house we went. Approximately halfway there, we stopped for gas and I bought a box of Krispy Kremes. We had an April Fool's day prank where someone put up a billboard proclaiming the arrival of these in our neck of the woods, Anchorage, Alaska if you've forgotton or didn't check, but this was the first time I'd actually seen them. Later that night I put a few in the microwave, and hot damn were they tasty. My aunt also spilled gasoline all over herself. This could be considered a bad thing, since she smokes. Thankfully, no immolation occured and we merely drove several miles crammed in a car with her fumey self. We got a warm reception at grammy's house, picked out bedrooms, and slept. I bet you're all pretty damn entertained, eh? I'll recount some more tantalizing tales for you later.

       Okay, so I'm a DDR fanatic. I like to bike uphill for about a mile for about a mile until I have the privelage of having a heat stroke at the theater arcade, but it's just too much fun to stop! Seriously though, I'm nuts, I like to play till it hurts, stop a minute, then play some more. Anyway, I finally passed Sakura for the first time the other day. This makes me feel like a real hot-shit dancer because it's a pretty hard song, and I've been trying to pass it for a while now. Plus, it's one of those milestone songs that everyone likes, so anyone who can will  always  play it. Once you finally beat it, you know that you've gotten better, because you will recall so clearly that you spent weeks, perhaps even months, watching other people play it. Anyway, I've concluded I have levels in a Prestige Monk class, possibly of the 1337 D4ncin' Styl3 order.

       My birthday is tomorrow. I will probably eat Japanese for dinner, because it is damn tasty. Or maybe I've just convinced myself that's the case because I'm a Japanophile. Yup, downloading anime, watching box sets with my friends, smattering my speech with the few words I know because it makes me feel so special. It's just so  kawaii ! My brother always likes to go eat ribs at Tony Roma's, but they taste less wonderful. He doesn't like sushi. He always looks for something like french fries or grilled cheese sandwiches when we go to Japanese resturaunts, and makes  me  feel embarrased. My friend with a credit card ordered me a t-shirt that says "Jesus saves!" and below that, "but the rest of you take damage." I guess Jesus has evasion. Probably took a few levels of expert(carpentry, of course.) until he could qualify for survivor. Cause, you know, I'm pretty sure Jesus didn't have any rogue levels. Oh, and you should all read Penny Arcade, Sam and Fuzzy, Machall, and Vgcats. Cheese fuckin' sammiches! Come on!

       I slept in, and got up when I was hungry. I ate rice krispies with sugar. Then I turned on my computer and farted around on the internet. After that, I went to AvP with my good friend. Predators are totally cool. I looted some popcorn and soda that got left behind in the theater(w00t!), which you might think is gross, but I think of it as bargain hunting. What better bargain is there than free popcorn and soda, two of my favorite things? Anyway, then I went to Microplay and talked shop with a clerk and bought some Nerds Ropes. Nerds Ropes are crazy good candy, and Microplay sells them for less than the grocery chains and gas stations. Then, I caught sight of the Sobe Love Bus at a gas station and stopped to check things out. There was a cool, really nice guy with dreads, and a slightly less cool(cause he wasn't so nice) guy. I bought Sobe and I got a free shirt. I had to borrow a little bungycord to bring it home, then I came back to return the bungee and got some more Sobe. This time I chose a water bottle, but it was a really cheapo one. Then I watched a Fox special and a team of midgets raced an elephant to pull a plane. Midgets increase the awesome of any show exponentially, but there were like, 44 midgets this time. And a lot of them made faces like they had fire for blood and were constipated at the same time, so it was good. Attention TV producers! Midgets = supah cool.

       I try to avoid all that teenage drama that you read about, I do. I've spent most of my life hiding in my basement or in a dark arcade. I have the most fun sitting around a table with like-minded people, playing DnD or having a lan party, that kind of thing. And, it's been working for the most part, but it always seems to chase me down. For a while, it was a problem I had because I couldn't really connect with any of my friends. Later, I realized that I had the wrong friends, and started enjoying myself with new circles. However, most of them were older, and I ended up playing witness to their misadventures. Now, I feel like I ought to try and talk about it, but I honestly have no idea what to say. I play through the conversations in my head, and nothing I say sounds satisfying. I am not used to dealing with people's feelings, not at all. Hell, not even  my  feelings. I know some people who are only my friends so we can get away with insulting eachother. And I hate to say anything of the sort, but shit, life is hard.

       I'm flying down to Seattle again, from Alaska, just so I can attend a gaming convention put on by webcomic artists. I have realized my full geek potential. It's gonna be great! I'm talking about PAX, of course. Penny-Arcade is super keen, and I'm gonna get to meet the creators and sit around staring at a screen for hours. According to the schedule, there will be a period around midnight where they kick everyone out for a hour or so, but after that it's back to work! I even get to play Halo2, which will also be neat. I gotta buy a fucking xbox. If anyone happens across this who is also attending, here's a fun fact: I'll probably be wearing an 3vil l33t shirt, and the rattiest fucking hat you've ever seen. Says "rugby, because" on the front of it. I love my hat, and have worn it for about six or seven years running now. It is an old hat. Maybe I should get it patched up or something before it's unwearable. PAX!!
