             I just had to ask really quick,  am I the only one who feels like Carrie from Sex in the City? Whenever I sit down to write my blog suddenly I begin to invision myself as this very hip and trendy hot chick trying to get my colum in on time. I'm sitting in my New York apartment next to my bay window overlooking the big city lights, waiting for Mr. big to stop by ..... Wait hold that thought, i'm going to get a glass of wine and a cigerette..... ooh la la!!

           I was recentley inspired by one of Denises rhymes so I thought i'd come up with my own about my day entitled "work sucks "...here goes...People at work like to talk a lot they tend to say things that they should not, they get me involved in all of their drama making up stories to cause me trauma. One day their happy the next day their sad the shit I hear makes me mad.I'm not perfect I know that but at least i'm not like Angela (she is really fat) she wants my job we all know that, what I want is to hit her with a baseball bat. I'm not crazy nor am I mean but the things she does are really obscene. Her nose is so far up our bosses ass it is brown she can take her fat ass and get out of town. She thinks she can piss me off so much that I'll quit, what she doesn't know is that i'm too legit. Here's to a new day at your place of work be happy not to have Angela the jerk.

         Last weekend we added a new addition to our family. We got a bird, a little blue male parakeet. I am actually quite surprised at myself because after growing up with a gazillion birds I always said " I will never have birds!!" But the last couple of times we ventured into petsmart I have been drawn to the bird section. I started imagining having a little feathery friend of my own and how much fun it would be to teach it to talk and stuff, and the next thing I knew I was walking out of the store with my own little birdie, cage and all. I started thinking about how not only am I starting to add to my home with things like birds and pomeranians but i've noticed my decorating is also quite similar to my parents house , with my Thomas Kincade picture over the couch or how I keep the newspaper in a little basket on the floor( like my mom did) or  how the color scheme is  suprisingly  similar, I just think it's so funny how we recreate what's familiar to us in our adult lives without even realizing it. Of coarse not everything is that way, as far as I know my mom never had an obsession with Yankee candles or T.V's in the kitchen.

       This whole blog thing is so cool because it reminds me of a time when I was about  10 or so I decided to start my own newspaper for our neighborhood. I called it the Court News(i lived in a cold-a-sac) and I went around to all the different neighbors and interviewed them about stuff.For example I remember one headline was titled "A New Cat in Town" and it was all about my next door neighbors new cat.On the back page I put riddles that I made up along with silly tounge twisters and I think I even made a cross word puzzle or something! Anyway I typed it all up myself and then my mom took me to make copies then I stapled them all together and put them on all of the neighbors porches! I was so proud!I remember wondering if people were going to request another one,no one ever did although I think my mom saved a copy.Anyways as I was writing earlier I thought of my silly self and thought I would share it with ya!!

           Weekends are supposed to be for relaxing and fun stuff , except for if your getting married in less then two months and your a procrastanator like myself. I want to send out an apology to all of you right now because chances are you won't be recieving your invitation for a tad bit longer.Instead of spending time on them right now when I have all the time in the world, i'm sitting here complaining about how I have so much to do, and don't have enough time. I know I don't make sense but this is so much more fun then tying bow after bow and then burning my finger with a hot glue gun.Just in case you have no idea what i'm talking about, i'm making all of our wedding invations by hand and it's a pain in the you know what.I'm sure that when they are all done I will look back and say that it wasn't that bad but for now all I can say is Ahhh My Life!!

      So I am all packed (kind of) and ready to go to Vegas and I started thinking about the City of Sin and how some strange powers are definately at work. I mean, what makes me not spend $4.50 on name brand cereal, because that is a rip, and shove $50 into a machine for 5 minutes of pushing a button. Also when people look tacky, loud, slutty, and silly in Vegas, that rocks, but in Peoria Arizona, they nasty. You can walk around with a beer, drink in a taxi (because you never drive in Vegas)....bars, food, and clubs never close.  So to sum it up, I live in the moment, do not judge so harsh, walk around with a buzz in a town where cabs will take you anywhere, eat..drink..dance and anytime my heart wants.  City of sin? I think not.   Utopia:  a place of ideal perfection especially in laws, government, and social conditions  Sin:  an action that is or is felt to be highly reprehensible

      I had an "ah ha" moment of realization yesterday. I always would say I don't care what people think and blah blah, but I totally did.. too much.. about most things.  I actually soaked it in yesterday what that means to really not care. It means, that you like yourself and are confident enough in what you believe in or whatever to not worry about what others think or what judgments may be cast. The people that I care most about would never stop caring about me just because I'm not perfect or they don't agree (totally rhymed). I don't know why it all clicked last night, probably watching a few episodes of Oprah I Tivo'd or all these deep thoughtful blogs going around.  I mean life will be so much easier to just let go of pointless worry and concern and just live and be cool. I think that if you just be the natural you with no issues, hang-ups or defenses ruling your thoughts, interactions and reactions, you will be content, an easy person to be around and can enjoy the people in your life more. That means you love yourself, people love you and your world is a nice place to be.  This also sort of falls in line with my hang-up of worrying about everything around me and trying to fix and basically interfere to try to make things better. All this effort I now realize is futile and is like sharing a 5th of vodka with 5 people, no one gets drunk. You have to just concentrate on you and yours to have a quality balance. Now these fanciful realizations are going to take practice but I think I finally got a taste of how cool it would be to not care so much.  side note: I don't think we should all go around spouting off, being rude and acting a fool because we don't care what people think. I think that nonsense is a result of issues, hang-ups and life's collection of bull-sh**. So be cool fools!

      My blogging muscle almost atrophied. Shoot ... without a steady stream of new posts and feedback on blogger I was stunted. I got a boost now that I am working it out agin.. thank goodness you guys are back. :)  That is probably what happened to all my muscles. I need to work out! How come in my head I want to work out so bad and I envision myself someday a fit, svelt, beauty but in reality I watch hours of tv, sit around, and make excuses? I am thinking of ordering some hypnotist tapes from the internet. Does anyone in blogger world enjoy exercise? Tell me how!

      My hubby and I are trying to get pregnant and as much as I thought I might have been preggers I keep getting one liner pregnancy tests.  We have only been trying for 1 month so I have lots of hope but I am going have to start selling our things on ebay to afford all these prego tests I keep taking (four so far).    hehehehe..some funny ones  - That guy had such a big package I almost signed for it - Take my advice; I don't use it anyway - A procrastinator's work is never done - Leftists are among the first to speak of their rights - I'm an apathetic sociopath - I'd kill you if I cared

      So what is new? I inquire The latest gossip I require I want details, what, when, why Not to spread but just to pry I am as curious as the dead cat "shut up!", "who said that?" "then what?", "what did they say?" "he peed where?" "How was your day? tell me....please... anything you know... like a whore needs crack, I need info!! I would die without the lastest news! "She needs a life" some may accuse Some may wonder "why does she care?" "Is her inner soul that empty and bare?" "Is it that her life is so mundane and bleak?" Hey, Mind your own business you nosy freaks!!

       urlLink    We can all thank Krissy for this horrific image. So sad when your favorite pop-icon of times past becomes a troll. And he was so cool in the Billy Jean video. Sleep well, everyone.

       urlLink    Kind of puts a damper on my day at the beach, huh? Shelby sent me this little bit of sunshine yesterday. I think it's an exaggeration though, there's no way that whale spews 400 gallons. It's big, but not that big. I'd venture to guess...what, 20 gallons? I'm no scientist here, but I know sperm. (No, I don't really, but I've never had the occasion to say "I know sperm" until now)

       TGIF!  Tonight we are going to see The Village with friends and go eat at Mongolian Palace (Noodles: below). I love Fridays they are so full of hope and promise of fun and splendor. Hope you all have a marvelous weekend :) ----------------------------  Cliches  In talking too all my friends and loved ones with all the many woes of life, I find myself saying things like "the grass is always greener", "time will tell", "Can't win em' all", "do unto others", "it's five o'clock somehwere" and soon and soforth. So many other re-occuring incidents of life deserve some catchy sayings as well. Here are a few I have been tossing around......   Saying:  At least he doesn't beat you or snort heroin (coined by my mom)  Meaning:  When you are feeling bad about your situation with your man (or woman), you can always use this uplifting saying to make you feel just a little better.  Saying:  Don't discuss, politics, religion, money, fake christmas trees, Arizona, or low carb diets in mixed company  Meaning:  This is just some solid advice if you want to avoid sparking heated debates  Saying:  At least you weren't as drunk as (insert name) that time at (insert place)  Meaning:  A way to console someone after a regretful night of drinking like a lush and acting a fool Anymore?

       urlLink    Brought to you by MGD  This is a picture of the two bloggers you are currently reading. You can guess who's who I suppose. I wasn't sure I could use BloggerBot to post to this blog, but as you can see, I succeeded. Here's to the exciting new adventure we are embarking upon today. Blog away!

       Noodles  When I ask my husband what he wants for dinner he always wants noodles from Mongolian Palace. I started thinking about the big deal with noodles, they are basically starch pods waiting to be inhabited by the nearest flavored sauce. Ya know, people are alot like noodles. Be sure to surround yourself with delicious and fresh ingredients or you end up bland, boring and tasteless.   Vegas  Why when you are on a plane to Las Vegas people feel it necessary to yell out "Vegas!...Vegas Baby!". We are all on the same airplane, I know your destination genius. I doubt this happens on flights to Delaware.
