        Ever been bogging?  Put on a pair of old sneakers, clothing you don't mind getting wet and lets go for a walk.  As you step out onto the bog it is like stepping out onto a waterbed made of moss.  Your feet sink into the ground as water fills in the whole. It is a creepy but wild experience.  If you dare you can walk right out till you are waste high or go over your head.  Now you may ask what does this have to do with a Blog?  Absoultely nothing but being as much of an environmental science nut as I am, it was the first thing that jumped into my mind...  So feel free to bog around!  Enjoy!!

      Howdy everyone,     I guess I have to find a way to write in this a bit more and keep things up to date however that is somthing I am not always good about. Now that summer is here maybe if there is any exciting news I will post some info and see what is going on in my life.    So now that school is done and I have one course down and I have been to Burlington and back I now enter July.  THe month of unchartered waters. Who knows what this month will bring for me.  I am sure I will have many adventures but at the same time I am sure I will be busy with all the free time I have to deal with.  Today I finished one of my first summer craft projects. I redid my fun chair.  Oh it was so much fun and now I have a very nice light green sponge painted chair.  I think I should just go into home decorating and photography.  I guess maybe if nothing else I will use this as a gauge of what I get done this summer.  Well I hope to get my puzzel I got started and done. I am working on ideas for my classroom. I get to work on bulletin board and decorating ideas. Oh the fun that is present in a summer off.    The 4th of July is here.. I think back to the two times I have not been in the US to celebrate the 4th. One year I was in Paris France at the Hard Rock Cafe and then 2nd time was this last year when I went to Australia for the Summer.  The 4th was the last day we spent in Port Douglass. We went out to Hog's Breath Cafe and had a blast with the bus driver.  OH the memories of July 4th past.  I also recall the year I went to my friends house and we had a hudge water fight and I got water dumped over my head.. Yeah many memories and I am sure more to be created yet this year.  Till next time keep on blogging and Happy 4th!  Cheers!
