      Wow. I was just checking out my own blog (yeah, we do that) and noticed I've written enough and been around long enough that you have to "archive" me to read everything. Great day in the morning!  Now maybe I'll try and figure out how to link other blogs and sites from mine. Until then, check out -  laurapalooza.sbc.global.net (jeez I hope I'm remembering that right) cootersnap.blogspot.com  These crazy, witty gals actually read my blog and seem to like it.  More tips to come...."Stay Tuned."

      Forty bucks is forty bucks, right? So I find myself in the research building of the psychology department at the University of Iowa participating in one of those studies where you fill out four thousand questions and get interviewed by an eighteen year old who believes a BA in pysch followed by an MBA is this ticket to a six figure income in marketing or advertising in a Fortune 500 company.   This particular study has a lovely title given today's political environment, it's called "Personality, Anxiety and Depression". Dare I say the shelves of our booksellers will be filled to the brim with similarly titled memoirs in the years to come? If I had more confidence in the general public's ability to embrace the concept of irony, I'd keep this one for myself. Ha Ha, who really gets to choose what their book is going to be called anyway? Maybe, Dean Koontz.  Meanwhile back at the lab....question three hundred & fifty-two: "You have to sit through a long concert of boring music you do not like or be in a bank during an armed robbery, which would you do?" Okay, clearly I feel like I should the say concert. I'm a middle-aged woman and I've already led a fairly dramatic life. An evening of Kenny G or, worse yet, the 1812 Overture, ought to be a no-brainer but this future Forbes magazine cover girl is paying me to be honest, isn't she? The question doesn't specify I would be shot in the robbery or even forced to squat down for an unnecessarily uncomfortable period of time. Hell, I might even wind up being the hero and get to be on prime time news so I clearly had to go with option numero dos.  Hhhm, this is another post w/ a bit of a science theme. I'm going to resist the urge to wrap this one up in a nice little package. I'm working on my "issue" of perfectionism. It's one of the darned reasons I qualified for the study to begin with.

        Why in God's name do I still turn on NPR every blue moon? I ask myself this question all the time. Neoliberal Propaganda Radio, that's how I've referred to it for many years. The fact that a crapload of McMoney has just insured it's spot on the hit parade of the radio dials of wanna be progressives for years to come only makes matters worse. Did I recently read that that idoit Andy Rooney made some list of America's most sexy men? Well, I hope women who whine, complain and bitch are given such status these days cause I'm quickly joining his ranks. Dare I say these NPR junkies are probably the same poor saps who believed that Howard Dean was the new savior of the Democratic party, despite the fact that he did not have a "real" progressive credential before the year 2002. Hey, what difference does that make in the United States? It's not like we've ever indicated a propensity to learn from our mistakes. Okay, nobody much expects Democrats to be progressive anyway but it was a pretty zippy little critique, no?  So what's my latest beef w/ the Holy Grail of public radio, you ask? All things considered (bad pun, I admit), it's relatively minor considering most of the either mindless or corporate tool-jockey content one is usually privy to. It was this evening's report on a report on a new sexual stimulant called PT 141 that has apparently been useful in getting female rats to be a little more accommodating to their male counterparts. It seems some "expert" in neurobiology has figured out that for us girls (and no doubt a few boys too), the turn on is all in the brain. Gee whiz, dude. How many research dollars and hours spent toiling away in the lab did it take you to figure that out?  Musical Goddess, Lucinda Williams penned and recorded a beautiful song once called "There's Something About What Happens When We Talk". It's a killer song and is wickedly wise. She's the daughter of a poet, need I say more? Call me old-fashioned but there is nothing as sexy as a really good conversation so, indeed, the turn on is all in the brain. Dr. Science and his associates could have saved themselves a whole bunch of money and picked up Lucinda's record or, better yet, they could have paid me for my opinion. I'm  still  looking for a job or for someone to take me a little bit seriously, every once and awhile.

       oxymoron?    "Senator Kerry has made clear that he wants that whole process to be quiet and confidential, which I think is the correct way to do it," Edwards told reporters earlier in the day. "Because of that I'm silent."

      So, I haven't been out in two weeks and I'm sleeping until 10 or 11 am. I'm older so I guess I have some sort of excuse. I told a friend I feel as if I've been bitten by the tse-tse fly because I am sleeping so much. She maintains it is just a habit I have fallen into. I maintain it is a low grade depression brought about by the political state of the world.  I just asked a new friend if he thought his uncle purchased his young Czech bride. I know there a bit of this going on. As a matter of fact, it's all the rage. A prominent cardilogist at Duke who is a decent friend did this with unfortunate, if not inevitable results. His trophy bride ran off with one of his colleagues and he got majorly addicted to fentanyl -- a narcotic more potent than morphine and completely unregulated for him. Poor dear. He's 46 and still chasing around women half his age. Occasionally when we find ourselves in the same area code, he buys me a spicy scallop roll and I try to talk some sense into him. He grew up in Barcelona and his mother used to lock him in a closet while she sun-bathed so I can't say I blame the guy for whatever Oedipal issues he may be running from.  So I'm wondering if the European Media is making much of this British guy who streaked at the Super Bowl and actually got fined. What a silly non-issue. Only in post 9-11 America but at least the prosecutor is admitting that's the reason.   Typing of current events, thankfully all the pomp and circumstance of Reagan's passing has started to die down. I thought I was going to have to have a lobotomy. I wonder if the grieving widow, Nancy, would have refered me to the specialist who did such a fine job on her husband?  My new friend Neil (whose uncle landed the hot young Czech gal) recently asked whether or not there was any truth to the suburban  Ice House -ian key parties and such ala Rick Moody as I'm still house sitting. I've nothing to report on the possible kinky intrigue out here in Wonder Bread a-go-go. These Midwesterners can be a pretty cagey lot and the influence of Lutheranism should not be underestimated in the repression-thus-shameful-and-hidden-perversions department but I am keeping to myself. I'm trying to get as much writing done as possible. I'm theoretically working on two books. It's important to note this is just a theory, okay?

      The first video I ever made was entitled "Margaret's Friends Speak Out". I shot it in the living room of the apartment in Baltmore where I was living at the time. A third floor walk-up that once hosted a "2nd Chance Prom Party" for us freakaziods who in high school had been unable to get a date, on suspension or too hip to go. It was the social event of the Hopkins Writing Sems/Balto Underground Artiste & Musician season. We slow danced to Stairway to Heaven, drank pink punch, skate-boarded up and down the hallway and cut loose to Dire Straits' Twisting by the Pool. Now, that was some fun, Daddy-O.   Anyway, in the video I make a brief appearance. I look at the camera and say something about believing I had been on television once but that I must have forgotten. It was heavy-handed but, hey, I was reading a whole lot of Raymond Carver at the time so I have to try to forgive myself.   I have a pretty high learning curve, which might explain some of this forgetfulness you refer to.  As for owning the store in the dating department at Nordstroms (which is just about the sweetest thing anyone has said to me in a long time, BTW), part of the process of shopping generally involves asking to see something, no? One could go to Walmart and be gob-socked by the abundance of things they do not need or even desire in the slightest but what a waste of energy.   Your comments obviously fired a few neurons and I've been feeling nostalgic as it is. Writing just might be one of the loneliest and exhausting professions on earth. There is so much research involved, not to mention all the stuff you wnd up never using. In this respect, it's also a bit like shopping, I suppose. Poor, poor pitiful me. God, I do miss Zevon. There is a fine piece in the current issue of the New Yorker on the hell of this process and other possible attractive weaknesses, if you are interested. It's the one about writer's block. You can access it on line -- FREE.  Do I know you? My most quotable and down & dirty friend, Laura, is a wee bit bugged by this Mr. Mystery routine. She suspects it is proof that you are, in fact, intimidated. I'm not so sure but then again my friend, Peter, recently suggested I might try and find work as a dominatrix. Come to think of it, another friend suggested this, as well. I could never pull it off. The moral issues are ambiguous, at best, when money is involved and I suspect I would end up laughing the entire time. In other words, I'm not too sure of anything these days.  Listen up...THE GODS MUST BE CRAZY because I wrote a very bad folk song once. I mean  bad . The first line went something like, "The chicken's in the road, gonna lay it on the line. The player's in the park, gonna make his music mine." I was 15 and all my friends called me "Mitchell" because I was such a Joni Mitchell fanatic, so I guess my "poetic nuances" at the time were pretty much a done deal. I did a small installation once entitled, "context is everything". In addition to all this fashionable rigmorale over Veganism and exotic strains of bacteria popping up on PETA's most endangered species list daily, chickens are way cool and seem to have to right idea.

      Fred has had it with my bullshit. I'm sleeping late, spending too much time with my uppity nose in a book or my fingers zing-a-linging along the keys of this computer hoping I might have another chance at watching a line form with the sole purpose of obtaining my autograph. I'm tempted to tell him what a swell job I've been doing and what a nightmare my life has been of late. Jiminy Cricket, I've fed the boy, taken him out, fixed him special treats and even "played" with him on occasion. What more could he want? There were three fig bars left in the cupboard and I gave them to him. Oh Sykeus, am I not worthy of more understanding and temperance than the Gods and dear Fred have bestowed upon me? Can't I make him understand that it's not all about him? That sometimes a girl just needs a little time to get right with herself and the world.  Apparently not. He's in the next room pouting and I'm being equally stubborn by outing the both of us in this less than modest fashion. If this scenario felt the least bit unique and not deserving of a Gold Medal in the Olympics of "Relationship Clichés 101 Revisited Yet Again", I might be moderately comforted. As it is, I'm just sort of disturbed. You take a shot of guilt, a dose of indignation, a sprig of unconditional love, an ounce of sanctimony, a quarter cup of martyrdom, a fistful of selfishness and you get your classic Long Island Iced-Meg. As much as I realize this concoction no longer works for me, I'll go stand at the trough ready to throw my entire being in over and over again.   Which, in an admittedly equally obscure and obvious kind of way, brings me back to Fred, bless his heart. He appears to have forgiven me. No longer in the next room licking his wounds, he's sitting next to me and, at least, feigning interest in what I'm writing. As high strung as both of may be, we both possess the ability to "own" our short-comings. Given the fact that Fred has chosen to be such a sweet pea, I suppose I should cut this off and go take a walk with the guy. I know that's what he's been after for the past two days. His interpretation of that ridiculous term that became all the rage in the go-go 80's -- "quality time" -- the concept of enjoying the pleasure of one another's company in the absence of other distractions and, get this (!), supreme self-interest. Go figure. I wonder if Fred has heard that even the US Congress got in on the QT mania, establishing the Baldrige National Quality Program in 1987 to recognize U.S. organizations for paying homage to their own versions of this precept.  The way I see it, I've got nothing to lose (it's not all about  him , it's all about  me ). It's a beautiful day. I need to stretch my legs. My relationship with Fred could use a little mending. He's lonely. I'm lonely. As much as I hate to admit it, it's generally a good thing for me when I get called on my "bullshit". I'm a little hard to argue with. Maybe something wonderful will happen. Being that Senor Fred is just about the cutest Springer Spaniel in town and I've got a new column in the independent monthly with my picture attached, a purposeful line might greet us at every corner demanding the pleasure of my autograph. Will my escort be understanding? Will he get bored? Or worse yet, will he steal the limelight? Oh wait; I'm getting ahead of myself, aren't I?  First off, if this happened I guess I'd be distracted and become self-interested thereby striking the whole quality time dealie to begin with. Secondly, I live in Iowa for goodness sake. Even if someone did recognize me, they'd be too damned well-behaved or, worse yet, shy to approach me. And third-off, I seem to have driven my temporary mate (I'm house sitting) into the next room yet again with all this useless speculation. I hear it's been known to happen. I'm coming, Fred. I promise.

      I have to tell you many of my Jewish friends expressed concerns when the Berlin wall came tumblin' down. Have we taken mutli-culturalism a tad too far? Of course not, but I'm thinking of a new writing project -- something along the lines of  The Tao of Paintball.    What we got here is a clear case of a Green Party alumnus doing a little bit of Earth First action :-) or Big Foot is foot loose again. But don't ask me, I'm just "riding on the metro".   Silly bikers, hikers and such. I'll bet they're even noshing on gorp. XOX - Meg   German 'Samurai' on the Loose in Woods Near Berlin   Fri Jun 18, 1:48 PM ET  Add Oddly Enough - Reuters to My Yahoo!     BERLIN (Reuters) - A camouflage-clad German man wielding a samurai sword attacked at least seven hikers in forests west of Berlin, performing sword tricks before ordering them to leave the woods, police said Friday.   They suspect a 46-year-old local man who trained in martial arts and survival skills in camps in Papua New Guinea and Vietnam to be the attacker.   "He's dangerous and has been hard to find because he wears camouflage," said Catrin Feistauer, spokeswoman for the Nauen police department. Police have used infrared cameras mounted on helicopters to try and track him down.   The man pushed two elderly people off their bikes and, flashing his sword, shouted at them to leave the forest. He later tried to drive a young couple out of the woods. No one was seriously hurt.

      from the June issue of  Nature       BTW, don't I recall something like this from my time in the primordial ooze? Let's dance or you just can't join my revolution.    Quantum Teleportation with Atoms     Quantum teleportation, based on the principle of entanglement in which two particles become correlated and share unique properties, has been demonstrated several times using pairs of entangled photons, but in a probabilistic way. This involves an element of hindsight: photons, once paired, are detected and deemed to have teleported. In this issue two groups report 'deterministic' teleportation, involving atoms (trapped 40Ca+ ions in one case, and 9Be+ in the other), such that the outcome is predictable. The quantum identity of one atom (not the atom itself) is destroyed by quantum measurement, and that identity is reconstructed on the paired atom. This achievement is an important step towards quantum computing and telecommunications. On the cover, the 40Ca+ experiment visualized.

       This was actually a big, fat bore. The Brits ARE so stuffy and the press just won't leave me alone but I know you guys love this stuff.    Meg - Joined her pal onstage  Festivals Extras          MEG WHITE APPEARS ONSTAGE AT LEEDS FESTIVAL   MEG WHITE made a surprise appearance at the CARLING WEEKEND: LEEDS festival on Sunday (August 24), playing drums with DETROIT buddy BRENDAN BENSON.  In one of the most bizarre festival collaborations, White joined Benson during 'Jetlag' - the last song of his performance on the Carling Stage. The new rock revolution party grew when Dolf and Phil Datsun appeared to play guitar and the Soledad Brothers added their dancing skills.  The chaos heightened when Dolf de Datsun hauled Benson on his shoulders and paraded the singer around the stage during the final chorus. As the song finished and the band left the stage, the towering pair reappeared briefly before wandering off again.  Following her visit to the Reading site on Saturday (August 23), rumours ran rife that Meg would perform 'The Hardest Button To Button' with The White Stripes' replacements Black Rebel Motorcycle Club on the Main Stage.  BRMC did cover the track during their sets at both sites, but without The White Stripes' drummer.

        I do not think I am especially attractive or "viable" in the dating department and I am not trying to flatter myself here but if another man tells me I am "intimidating", I am going to do something really crazy like shred a cocktail napkin or tell off a frat boy's shadow.  This swell woman I met tonight named Mary had the best response ever to this little downer, "No, you are just intimidated!"  Buck up, boys! There are lots of us who refuse to play the girly-girly femme fatale role. Dorothy Parker may have had her flaws but I doubt she ever bored anyone to death at a dinner party. Be attracted to someone's strengths not their weaknesses. Laugh easily & often.   WTG, LC, for giving William Beckmann a little lip at VSC a few weeks ago.  DISCLAIMER: THIS IS A HETEROCENTRIC POST.

      edited version&nbsp;published in  The Iowa Source  June 2004    (those folks are swell)     Dear Meg,   I just got my first cell phone. I'm confused about when and where it's okay to use the thing. Also, is it just me or do men seem to use theirs more?   Please help me out.   Margaret    My Dear Margaret,   Of course, you are confused. We all are. New technologies and their subsequent toys are often baffling but most rules of good etiquette will always apply. If you feel as if chatting on your new purchase will be bothersome or offensive to another person in any way, do not do it. This said we all experience the dreaded emergency or slip in referencing our appointment books. If, for instance, you are at a restaurant and suddenly remember that you forgot to take your cat "Bitey" to see his Behavior Modification Specialist earlier in the day and know that if you do not reschedule right away you will be double billed, for goodness sake, pick up your phone and call. These appointments can be quite costly and most friends and colleagues will be more than understanding about how temperamental our bestial "children" can be.   While investigating your question about our beloved male counterparts and the wireless phone issue, I ran across a study which may confirm your own observations. A pair of British researchers, John Lycett and Robin Dubar, of the University of Liverpool, think men are using their phones to attract women. In a report in  Human Nature , they found that men with cell phones tend to put them in plain view on the bar or table as soon as they sit down. And they handle them often - not to make or receive calls, but to call attention to the fact that they have one. The more men in the pub, the more often they played with their phones. In a twist on the usual male obsession about size, smaller cell phones are considered better.   I'm not sure what to say about this except that if this is, in fact, the case it is rather adorable.   Enjoy your phone, Margaret, and remember that all rules are meant to be broken from time to time. Thank you for trusting me with your query.   Love,   Meg     Dear Meg,  Last year I saw my neighbor sneak into my garden a few times and take some herbs and vegetables. I don't mind sharing but I wish she would just ask for them, what should I do?   John   My Dear John,   Being tolerant is certainly a sign of good manners but we all have to draw the line somewhere, preferably not in our arugala beds but if the sprout springs - spear it.   I can abide most things but this sort of horticultural thievery is patently unacceptable. You are no doubt a testament to restraint and dignity for having sat idly by last year without downing a six pack of tallboys and pulling out a Glock 22 on your hopefully desperately hungry neighbor. Other "experts" might suggest placing a small note on a watering stick at your property line asking for restraint. One which testifies to your hours of toil and the no doubt huge expense of sunscreen and knee pads. I, however, would urge you to be direct. Simply pay a visit to your neighbor, invite her over for tea and gently confront her about her behavior. You might discover she is actually quite charming and in need of a little companionship. Perhaps she would like to help you in the garden. She may have a few tallboys in the fridge if that's your bag, just beware of any Glocks, John. Violence is definitely bad manners.   Thanks for trusting me with your query.   Love,   Meg

      one of the many reasons Meg rarely gives her money to the BIG BOYS anymore...  (this is also from  V Voice )  Table Talk by Ed Halter Script Supervision June 8th, 2004 10:20 AM Operation Hollywood: How the Pentagon Shapes and Censors the Movies  By David J. Robb  Prometheus Books, 384 pp., $28   Buy this book more on books at VLS         he Voice spoke with David L. Robb, author of Operation Hollywood: How the Pentagon Shapes and Censors the Movies (Prometheus Books, 384 pp., $28), about the common practice of studios altering scripts to meet military PR requirements in return for free access to tanks, planes, and bases.   What is the military's objective in working with studios? Primarily, it wants positive images about the military in movies and TV, to aid in the recruitment and retention of personnel. Huge spikes in enlistments have occurred after certain movies, like Top Gun, came out. They also target Congress, so it'll think that the military's good, and it's doing a good job, and keep funding the Pentagon.   Does the military see this as propaganda?   Definitely not. They see this as showing accurate and honest depictions of the military. But the head of the Pentagon's liaison office, Phil Strub, is on record as saying that any negative images of the military are not accurate.   How do you think this long-term collaboration has affected public opinion? I believe that when the world's most powerful military has a strong say in the content of the world's most powerful medium, viewers are going to come away with a message: that the military is good and doesn't do anything wrong. And I think that recent events show that that's not true at all.

      From  The Village Voice  by Richard Goldstein    Slim Shady, Censor     "Lyrical Judge Praises Eminem in Lyrics Fight": That was how the Times saw the ruling last week that held The Source in contempt for failing to follow a previous order involving the removal from its website of certain lyrics by Marshall B. Mathers III. According to The Source, the lyrics go back to 1993, not to Em's adolescence in the '80s, as he has claimed. Back then, he felt free to vent on African American women—as in "black girls are bitches." Eminem has acknowledged writing that rap, attributing it to "anger, stupidity, and frustration when I was a teenager." At least he didn't blame his mom.   But black women weren't Mathers's only targets, according to Source CEO David Mays. In one song alluded to in the magazine, Mays says, "he called black people 'spear chuckers,' 'porch monkeys,' and such." In its February issue, The Source printed several pieces pointing to Eminem's prior racist tendencies. The lyrics were meant to illustrate that thesis. The law usually allows a publication to reproduce a work being commented on, but in this case the judge held to a very narrow definition of fair use, limiting The Source to releasing only 20 seconds of the songs in question.   All the judge saw was the danger that publishing Eminem's early musings would damage his credibility as a white artist working in a black form. That's not unlike the protectiveness many white critics extend to Eminem in refusing to face his biases. By censoring the evidence of hardcore bigotry, Eminem can prevent a true reckoning with the meaning of his success. That's why The Source is planning to appeal the judge's ruling. "It's about the media's right to report on something the public needs to know about," Mays says.   Dennis Dennehy, a spokesman for Eminem, had no comment.

      things I'm thinking about right now.   1) Puppies & Kittens (did you expect originality here?) 2) A coffee shop called "Shut Up and Drink It" ~ thanks to Gary the Scrabble King from George's. You won fair and square, brother. 3) Boys with bellies are way cute. Girls too. 4) "It's best to stay out of places where the bartenders know how you like your martinis." Corpseionic wisdom to live by so you don't wind up in a body bag. 5)"As my friend Xeni once noted, whenever you are particularly worried that people are thinking about you, they're actually probably busy worrying about how they can lose 5 lbs." Laura Crossett hits the proverbial nail on the head once again! 6) Will Betamax technology ever come back? 7) I wonder if those people who stood on my hair when I passed out at the Jeff Beck concert are still alive? 8) Could I make a little scratch selling pet rocks? Hey, don't swipe my idea -- "e" me and let's be anti-American and coorperate. 9) Why is it cool to look like a crackhead, hophead gangsta'in the Midwest?   and number  t  e  n .......  10) How come at the age of 43 I have ended up with a hairdo almost identical to Claire Danes in "My So-Called Life"? Of course, it's also very similar to Worf's bob in season three of Star Trek II: The Next Generation.

      Dear Meg,   I've recently moved to Iowa from Manhattan and am a fairly outspoken east-coaster. I appreciated your advice last month about being direct as I feel as if I am a Stranger in a Strange Land in my new home. I am relatively thick-skinned but I suspect it would be rude to embarrass my new prairie friends with my big city ways. Any advice?   Valentine   My Dear Valentine,   Your question reminded me of an incident 13 years ago in which I ended up on what proved to be a whale-free whale watch near Cape May, NJ. Well into the 2nd hour of our voyage my fellow passengers & I were frustrated and freezing. This was a low budget affair and the weather had turned very sour. Can you hear the theme song to Gilligan's Island here? Things being as they were I took it upon myself to climb over the railing and out onto the bow of the beat-up vessel in the wind and the rain and scurry up to the window of our oblivious captain whose door was mysteriously inaccessible from the inside of the "ship". I screamed  "TURN THIS TUB AROUND!" The poor guy. Can you just imagine, Valentine? He looked up and saw a crazy woman yelling at him? I was a heroine for a brief time. My fellow travelers toasted me and fed me chocolate the whole trip back. All but one that is. My best friend, Shauna, who'd never seen a whale and on whose behalf I had originally gone on the trip in the first place. She was mortified and I had to apologize profusely and make amends for my sanctimony and ego-driven behavior.   I have no doubt that you are getting my drift here (note the bad oceanic pun).  I got on my high horse and forgot about my primary purpose -- being there for my friend. In my opinion the last word on manners was published by Emily Post in 1922, "Manners are a sensitive awareness of the feelings of others. If you have that awareness you have good manners no matter what fork you use."  The fact that you asked about embarrassing your new friends shows me you could permabond your dinner guests' desert spoons to their sippy cups and walk tall, sweet girl. I have no doubt you will be the belle of the Butter Cow Ball in no time.   Thanks for trusting me with your query.   Love,   Meg     Dear Meg,  I am about to go to New York City for the first time and I want to look my best. Any style tips or advice or how to make a good first impression in the big city?  Donald  My Dear Donald,  I wish I could hook you up with Valentine but we professional journalists have these silly rules about protecting people's identities. You have hit on one of my favorite topics and I am thrilled you took the time to write me.  Let's go back in time for just a moment shall we?  Physical anthropologists suggest the island of Manhattan (the jelly in the donut of American Style) is the only place on earth where early Neanderthal and Cro-Magnon humans have lived at the same time. Did they pick berries for YABBA-DABBA-DOO  pie, or boil them, dye loin clothes and scurry up and down the cat walk clamoring for attention? No one knows, but it is worth remarking that the Neanderthals are no longer with us and rumor has it neither Wilma nor Betty could get a Neanderthal male in a decent suit.  The basic rule of thumb in all things "style" is comfort and being true to one's self but most of us should care about the impressions we make and when we dress for others we are showing we respect them and ourselves. Now I'll let you in on a secret, Donald, I do not know a man or woman who when being truly honest with themselves is not impressed with a man in a nice suit or, at the very least, an interesting jacket and a hip pair of blue jeans. Be sure to tip well while in the big city, have fun and remember that moderation is eternally cool.  Thanks for trusting me with your query.  Love,  Meg

       when it finds "khakis", fyi, but that has nothing to do with the subject of this post   So it's another exciting Saturday in Iowa. Approximately 36 minutes ago some fellow nerdballs and I were all gathered outside the University main library waiting for the doors to open so we could get online, do research, beat the heat, hang in the stacks or finish up course work for the summer session. I was in the nut hut (aka Psych Ward) a little over 2 years ago for depression and one of the many hilarious/astute observations was made by a guy named Dave. He was wandering through the social area (i.e. a few chairs with a big ass television in the middle of it) and I asked him what was up. Without breaking his haldol-esque stroll or missing a beat he replied, "Oh, just another day before tomorrow." I admit this is how I have began to see the passage of time in relation to my current state of affairs.  I'm not necessarily bothered by this. Sure I'd like a little financial security and some semblance of a social life. I wouldn't mind it if my mother or father were not the only people I ever got regular phone calls from (God bless them for still calling and helping me out after all the grief I've put them through over the years.) Sometimes I miss living in the fast lane -- dashing around from place to place, being the "it" girl with a closet full of shoes and skirts, and squeezing in time to get $100 hair cuts. I can even become nostalgic about worrying what time was best to show up at which club and who you most wanted to be seen with (or sometimes even more important  without .) Christ, what a superficial and ridiculous way to live one's life. I'll admit to being ashamed I ever lived like this.  Most people I know are still rushing around all the time. They may not be living the high life but plans are always being made at the last minute and everyone seems to be in a rush. I consider myself in recovery from this lifestyle. I slip on occasion but generally I'm in a rush to make it to a free computer lab before they close so I can write and have access to the free research tools on the internet. I've attempted to make new friends who have adopted a more settled lifestyle as most of my old friends have moved out of state. I'll ask them out for coffee once or twice and then ask them to call me. Mostly they never do or I get the, "Hey I have 30 minutes free in about an hour so I could meet you then if you want" return invitation. I may be in search of companionship but I'd appreciate it if others would show the respect for my time (such as it is) in the same manner I have demonstrated respect for theirs.  One thing that has been especially irksome in the quest for settled friends in middle-age is the arrogant and presumptuous attitude among men in my age bracket. I am a mature and capable woman who has traditionally had two or three very close female friends and a large number of guys with which I hung but it seems after you reach a certain age, most men presume a suggestion of getting together is no doubt a desperate plea on your part to be spared a life of bitter spinsterhood. That you believe you are more likely to be hit in the head by a wayward piece of the Sputnik satellite, hurled into an alternate universe and find yourself in a deserted Siberian labor camp with Dr. Spock-- only in this world Spock has a moustache and the climate in Siberia is tropical. These guys decide on your behalf they'd better pass or humor you with one quick "date" lest you become so enchanted with them you end up being forever wounded at their behest. Good grief.  My friend, Erica, with whom I used to have a weekly breakfast club just stopped by and said "hi." Once upon a blue moon, my often quoted pal, Laura, Erica and I met for breakfast at Lou Henri's on Thursday mornings. Erica has finished up grad school and is moving to Maine with her new beau, Eric. That's almost too cute, isn't it? Eric & Erica. I'm happy for her. Laura moved to the suburbs of Chicago last year but thankfully comes back to visit a few times a year. I'm still here, man. Maybe I've gotten a little too settled. Who knows? I do like hanging out here in the library with my fellow nerdballs. It sure beats having a 2 hour long "clothing crisis"before going out, worrying if your date is wordly enough to know not to fawn over any of the "bright and shiny" (or in those days "dark and dingy") famous club kids you've come hoping to strategically ignore, and then waking up the next afternoon with a small white rock lodged in your nose, an empty bottle of Absolut next to the bed and your Chrissie Hynde kohl eyeliner smeared half way down your face.  It's another exciting afternoon in Iowa but it sure beats the "wild life". Speaking of wild, can it really be true that Gwenyth Paltrow and her rocker husband actually named their child "Apple"? And some other celebrity recently named a child "Coco"? So my guess would be Apple is after Fiona and Coco is an homage to Coco Chanel? I could certainly be wrong. I'm rather pleased with the traditional, unexciting names my siblings chose for their kids. My brother has an Emma and a Sam; my sister an Isabel and a Grace.  I'll sign off now, I've actually got plans for dinner and only 4 plus hours to fret about what to wear. Should I go with the khakis or the Levis? Which ones have the least amount of stains on them? Do I have time for a nap? Oh dear, so much time and so little to actually worry about. Thank Goddess!

      Most of the long term unemployed people I know have&nbsp;just given up the job search or decided to take the summer off. When people ask me what I do, I've begun to tell them I'm retired. It's much better than having anyone be impressed with the fact that&nbsp;I'm a writer, an exceptionally difficult and extremely competitive way to earn a living.&nbsp;As one friend&nbsp;slyly noted the world o' writing is&nbsp;"a small, muddy pond with too many animals trying to lap something from it."&nbsp;   The "I'm retired" line has another benefit. If you share with someone you are looking for work they tend to be full of helpful suggestions which are generally anything but. It's not as if you don't&nbsp;realize these amateur social workers&nbsp;aren't well meaning but how often can you nod your head graciously at what are essentially the same five ideas? Before I took to claiming early retirement, I modified Andy Warhol's famous line as a coping mechanism for dealing with this phenomena. I would smile and nod, saying " Gee , that's a terrific idea." Then I would excuse myself ASAP from the conversation.   I did&nbsp;try to get some work cleaning apartments at the end of the month&nbsp;but by the time I got there they already had 4 million applications. Good grief. I'm still making a little money doing some research gigs at UIHC which is almost fun. I'm&nbsp;thinking about&nbsp;writing an article about my experiences as a professional research monkey. The neurologist who "tested" me yesterday was quite a cutie.&nbsp;I've decided to consider some of these sessions "dates" if the men are at all appealing. After you call and express interest, they call you back and arrange a time that's convenient for you and it's their job to make you as comfortable as possible. What more could a girl want?&nbsp;I suppose, one could see this as a form of prostitution in that I end up getting paid but why shouldn't&nbsp;a gal&nbsp;place value on&nbsp;her time. It's not like the boy is not getting something out of it.&nbsp;It's a mutually beneficial experience.&nbsp; Who says you can't mix business with pleasure?   &nbsp;

      &nbsp; from  LA Weekly  by John Powers  A few weeks ago, New York Times TV critic Alessandra Stanley had a feminist meltdown, or at least as much of a meltdown as the once–Gray Lady would ever allow in its pages. Reviewing the new situation comedy Good Girls Don’t, she came out swinging: “It is hard to pinpoint exactly when it became safe to be a stupid slut on television.” She then launched into a splendid rant about the man-pleasing desperation of Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera, SNL head writer Tina Fey needlessly removing her top in Mean Girls, and the travesty that Good Girls Don’t (“a cheaply taped sitcom that panders to the vast, insatiable appetite for cheerfully demeaning depictions of women”) should appear on Oxygen, a network purportedly dedicated to offering the enlightened female programming one can’t get on Lifetime.  Faced with such an eruption of genuine feeling — you could hear Stanley’s teeth grinding as she pounded away at the keyboard — I did what anyone would do. I watched the show. Man, was it rotten: mirthless, degrading and utterly inept. As the self-hating jokes about women piled up like a stack of old “Cathy” comic strips, I saw why Stanley had spoken almost fondly about the dignified days when Pamela Anderson proudly jiggled her way through Baywatch — at least her good posture suggested a spine. And I began thinking how dispiriting a woman must find it to watch this kind of crap for a living.  Although we’re told this is an age of female empowerment — why, women now earn 77 cents on every dollar earned by a man! — much of our pop culture is more wantonly retrograde than it was before the women’s liberation movement. Jessica Simpson has become a sensation, if not a role model, by presenting herself as a three-watt bulb. Socialite proto-hookers have made The Simple Life into a hot reality show (with no small boost from Paris Hilton’s bored foray into amateur porn). In Troy, even Helen of Troy — the most famous adulteress in Western civilization — is turned as bland as Laura Bush.  When movies like DodgeBall: A True Underdog Story aren’t gratuitously leering at the T&A of Hollywood’s truest underdogs — the film industry now promotes the same sexual politics as beer commercials — they’re asking some actress to play a hooker, a porn star or an underdressed underage sexpot. (In a recent pud-pulling “think” piece in Esquire, Richard Roeper boldly revealed the shocking truth that middle-aged male moviegoers like ogling jailbait.) Even movies that supposedly take the women’s side too often serve up a teenage boy’s fantasies of womanhood — kick-ass chicks like Kill Bill’s Beatrix Kiddo and Charlie’s Angels — or sink into slack misogyny. The slapdash Stepford Wives remake may at first look like a satire of anti-feminist backlash, but by the end, the devil turns out to be, yes, a middle-aged career woman. No wonder so many women seek the maternal embrace of Oprah’s and Katie’s book clubs.  When I first came to the Weekly in the 1980s, I wrote alongside Helen Knode, the house bad girl, whose reviews frequently pointed out how movies debased women by portraying them as bimbos, psychos, whores and corpses — or ignoring them altogether. Each time she did so, she received furious letters from men saying, “Spare us your feminist politics and just review the movie” — as if it’s not part of a film that the female characters are all vacuous, skanky or dead. After fighting the good fight for several years, Helen eventually abandoned film criticism and wrote a crime novel, The Ticket Out, about the many ways that Hollywood kills women. Although the degradation of women remains the often-unmentioned elephant in the home entertainment center — and let us not forget the “bitches” and “hos” of pop music — it hasn’t gone unnoticed. I recently asked a well-known film critic how often she sees movies she finds demeaning. “Every fucking week,” she replied. “But I only write about it now and then, when something really bothers me. If you do it all the time, you become boring. You don’t want to seem relentless.”  Sad to say, it’s easy to be thought relentless if you’re a female critic writing about pop culture. When a male reviewer like me points out that Starsky &amp; Hutch displays a disgustingly puerile attitude toward women (wasn’t Ben Stiller once thought to be smart?), this proves I’m a sensitive guy, a hero. When a woman makes the identical observation, she’s considered a strident bitch.  If I seem peculiarly fascinated by the tribulations of women critics, this is because, in my formative years, I was enthralled by two of them: The New Yorker’s late, great film critic Pauline Kael and Susan Sontag, now 71, who has given herself the groovy description of “freelance intellectual.” I clearly wasn’t the only one. In his enjoyable new book Sontag & Kael: Opposites Attract Me, Craig Seligman offers a personal riff on the two most visible American critics of the last 40 years. Not only were they hugely influential — their work has been strip-mined and embarrassingly mimicked by countless other critics — but their vast differences in taste, style and image (one was “Pauline,” the other “Sontag”) marked the boundaries of popular criticism.  Like Mary McCarthy before them, Kael and Sontag presumed to an authority that was routinely thought of as a masculine prerogative. If they have been more praised and reviled than their male counterparts, this isn’t simply because their work was better at capturing the joys of Jean-Luc Godard or modern styles of eroticism; the fact of their being women induced a protracted frisson in an America that has always found it easy to find the bitch lurking in the goddess. Raised in an era of two-fisted male dominance, they became anomalously famous, not least because they spent decades struggling against conventional womanhood, both in their personal lives — Kael had a daughter by a gay man, while Sontag, after an early marriage, settled into lesbianism — and, more important, in their writing.  Although Kael once declared that she consciously wrote as a woman (down to the bitchiness, Seligman quotes her as saying), the woman in question would have to be someone like Ma Barker. Brash, intensely personal, and drawn to vulgarity and violence — she loved “the visceral poetry of pulp” — Kael may have viewed life through the prism of a woman’s experience, but she always made a point of having the biggest balls in the room. When she hit The New Yorker in the ’60s, she gave that genteel magazine a saving jolt of cockiness — Mailer couldn’t have offered more swagger — and her whole approach to movies smacked of the womanizer who genuinely loves women but none for very long. Taking pride in never seeing a film more than once, let alone revising her opinion of it, she treated moviegoing like a series of one-night stands (as David Thomson shrewdly notes in the current Atlantic Monthly). She was fond of cinematic bullyboys like John Huston and Sam Peckinpah because, in her way, she was one. She fostered a small army of male acolytes who became known not as “Kaelites” but were given the sexually insulting moniker “Paulettes” by her rivals.  If Kael was the wisecracking Howard Hawks heroine who wasn’t just one of the guys but their leader, Sontag has always come off as something of an intellectual Ice Queen, detached, impersonal, Olympian. In her younger years, she looked like a sexy European actress, perhaps the brunette sister of Catherine Deneuve in Belle de Jour. Has any critic ever been more photogenic? But while her remote glamour promised a hidden reservoir of sensuality (one read her essay on the pornographic imagination not a little pruriently), her work emphatically did not. It strove toward the impersonality famously championed by such modernists as Flaubert and Joyce. Sontag was a woman critic, sure, but one who took pains to make her criticism transcend gender. And I do mean pains. Whether boosting the ’60s avant-garde or celebrating the timeless values of great art, Sontag has always been as achingly self-serious as a Tarkovsky retrospective. If she ever caught herself laughing at a movie like Dumb and Dumber, one suspects she’d splinter like a block of dry ice smacked with a hammer.  Both were experienced enough to appreciate the women’s movement — Kael once compared a woman writing for Playboy to a Jew writing for a Nazi paper — yet they were also independent enough to find something insulting in the idea that they personally would need it. Indeed, Kael had the self-made woman’s irritation with those who complained of victimization. When the original Stepford Wives came out, she dubbed it “the first women’s lib gothic,” complaining that if modern women turn into robotized creatures who emulate commercials, they do it to themselves.  Maybe so, but I wonder how Sontag and Kael would be different if they’d come to intellectual prominence not in the 1960s, when the culture pulsed with a feeling of liberation, but in our anti-feminist backlash days, when 8-year-old girls are already obeying the status dictates of commercial fashion, 12-year-old girls “hook up” to fellate boys who offer nothing in return, and a show like Good Girls Don’t boasts a premiere titled “My Roommate Is a Big Fat Slut.” I suspect they’d never stop wanting to scream.

      I came home last night and there was a stack of magazines on the front porch courtesy of Hazel, the woman who lives in an apartment next door.&nbsp; I snatched up&nbsp;the August issue of Vanity Fair. Despite for my fondness for Dorothy Parker's lament about having to write for the rag, "No one at Vanity Fair has opinions and I  have  opinions.", I consider&nbsp;VF a guilty pleasure and indulge whenever I can get my hands on a free copy.   What joy to find "retiring"  Morning Edition  host Bob Edwards the&nbsp;focus&nbsp;of the monthly&nbsp;Proust Questionnaire.&nbsp; Edwards was always my favorite NPR guy and I found it a wee bit suspicious that he was&nbsp;"stepping down"&nbsp;right around the time the McMoney came rolling&nbsp;down the sacred halls of NATIONAL public radio.&nbsp; There is a big distinction between NPR and local public radio stations, okay? There's also a big difference between, say,&nbsp;Public Radio International and NPR but we'll save that for another time.   After reading just the one page, I've decided Bob and I were separated at birth. Never mind that we look nothing alike, are not the same age and he's a good 4 inches shorter than me.&nbsp; I'm completely convinced. Here are just a few pieces of my evidence. The trait he most deplores in himself is the "inability of suffer fools." Ditto for me. The trait he most deplores in others is "Sycophancy." Again, ditto. The living person he most admires is Bill Moyers. How many times have I said this, or that of all the quote-un-quote celebrities I've met it was Moyers I was most thrilled about.&nbsp; The qualities he most values in his friends are "Consistently strong character, intelligence and wit."&nbsp; The thing he most dislikes is anti-labor laws.&nbsp; Yaya!&nbsp; Dare I mention a small incident of&nbsp;leading a student employee revolt a&nbsp;thousand years ago?   Now God bless the man for his honesty and sense of humor on this question....Where would you like to live? "Above my current means."&nbsp; Amen.&nbsp; I was wandering around aimlessly the other day and found myself in a rather upscale eyeglass store. I decided to try on some frames just for fun.&nbsp; Sure enough the pair I selected as the ones I would purchase  if  I could afford new frames were $600.&nbsp; I&nbsp;couldn't help but&nbsp;ask the salesman if they were the most expensive ones in the place&nbsp;and, sure enough, they were.&nbsp; Being a writer,&nbsp;journalist,&nbsp;decent human being&nbsp; and  justice fanatic with expensive tastes is one big drag. Hey, did I mention the phrase he says he most overuses is "Is there a smoking section here?"&nbsp; Drag, indeed, I picked that habit back up recently.   Oh well, if you're not convinced that Bob Edwards and I are separated at birth by now there isn't really much else I can&nbsp;say nor am I going to&nbsp;bother&nbsp;with you.&nbsp; I've got&nbsp;a flaw in my character I've decided I may just have to&nbsp;accept even though it's&nbsp;deplorable.&nbsp; I just cannot seem to suffer fools.&nbsp;     Oh, on an entirely different note except that it's related to journalism:&nbsp;   The only thing I've heard that's half way interesting about the DNC is that Theresa Heinz told some media hounds to "SHOVE IT!" which I don't blame her&nbsp;for&nbsp;one bit. One could say it's just more proof of how spoiled and she is, etc., but if a zillion&nbsp;infotainment hounds&nbsp;were firing questions and aiming cameras at me, I'd probably say worse.

      Excerpt from "My Beef With Big Media" By Ted Turner The entire text is available at alternet.org  July 27, 2004 I encourage everyone to read it and then forward it along to FCC chair, Michael Powell.  Turner was the first big Joe in the media world to forbid his news casters to use the term foreigner to describe non-Americans. Apparently he had to shame Bill Gates in public in order to get the man to donate a dime of his Microsoft billions to "charity". Does anyone remember the Goodwill Games? I've always had soft spot for the guy.    LOSS OF QUALITY  The Forbes list of the 400 richest Americans exerts a negative influence on society, because it discourages people who want to climb up the list from giving more money to charity. The Nielsen ratings are dangerous in a similar way – because they scare companies away from good shows that don't produce immediate blockbuster ratings. The producer Norman Lear once asked, "You know what ruined television?" His answer: when The New York Times began publishing the Nielsen ratings. "That list every week became all anyone cared about."  When all companies are quarterly earnings-obsessed, the market starts punishing companies that aren't yielding an instant return. This not only creates a big incentive for bogus accounting, but also it inhibits the kind of investment that builds economic value. America used to know this. We used to be a nation of farmers. You can't plant something today and harvest tomorrow. Had Turner Communications been required to show earnings growth every quarter, we never would have purchased those first two TV stations.  When CNN reported to me, if we needed more money for Kosovo or Baghdad, we'd find it. If we had to bust the budget, we busted the budget. We put journalism first, and that's how we built CNN into something the world wanted to watch. I had the power to make these budget decisions because they were my companies. I was an independent entrepreneur who controlled the majority of the votes and could run my company for the long term. Top managers in these huge media conglomerates run their companies for the short term. After we sold Turner Broadcasting to Time Warner, we came under such earnings pressure that we had to cut our promotion budget every year at CNN to make our numbers. Media mega-mergers inevitably lead to an overemphasis on short-term earnings.  You can see this overemphasis in the spread of reality television. Shows like "Fear Factor" cost little to produce – there are no actors to pay and no sets to maintain – and they get big ratings. Thus, American television has moved away from expensive sitcoms and on to cheap thrills. We've gone from "Father Knows Best" to "Who Wants to Marry My Dad?", and from "My Three Sons" to "My Big Fat Obnoxious Fiance."  The story of Grant Tinker and Mary Tyler Moore's production studio, MTM, helps illustrate the point. When the company was founded in 1969, Tinker and Moore hired the best writers they could find and then left them alone – and were rewarded with some of the best shows of the 1970s. But eventually, MTM was bought by a company that imposed budget ceilings and laid off employees. That company was later purchased by Rev. Pat Robertson; then, he was bought out by Fox. Exit "The Mary Tyler Moore Show." Enter "The Littlest Groom."

       BTW, there are only 99 shopping days left until the election!    &nbsp;Thanks, Barney! I'm 39 years younger than McGovern and I still I find myself walking away from conversation after conversation muttering to myself "don't listen to me."&nbsp;&nbsp;    "I don't know of a liberal program that conservatives didn't later endorse," McGovern asserted. "I tell them, 'Are you against Social Security? If not, then shut up.' We don't want to turn it over to Enron, Halliburton or Arthur Andersen. Everybody is for these programs except the most retarded in either party."     As he waded through the crowd, Massachusetts Rep. Barney Frank liked what he heard: "McGovern's entitled to say, 'I told you so.' People tell you that you shouldn't say that. But I find that at my age it's one of the few pleasures that gets better."

      This one started out&nbsp;innocently enough. Hell, they all do. It was hot outside and I was hungry. They&nbsp;keep them&nbsp;in a deep freezer in the aisle you must traverse on the way to the cash register. AND, they've been&nbsp;on sale all summer. As my mother and I used to joke whenever we were out spending my father's money, "It's not what you spend, it's  what  you save."&nbsp; Now I'm in deep. I have cravings, I'm been coming in over budget for the past two months and when I attempt to abstain I get all edgy and nervous.&nbsp; I suppose I could blame John's Groceries for my new dependence/addiction to Edy's frozen fruit bars but I know damn well I have to take responsibility for this thing and not blame anything or anybody else.   The aspect of this that disappoints me most is how easily I fell for their painfully obvious marketing ploy. After&nbsp;I'd graduated from buying just one box at a time to two (who needs to the extra walk, for God's sake), the woman at the register offered up a coupon&nbsp;which rewarded me for this&nbsp;sensible take-no-extra-steps&nbsp;decision.&nbsp; Aha!&nbsp; I've saved even more money this time.&nbsp; Well,&nbsp; the&nbsp;third time I&nbsp;dash in for my&nbsp;gourmet treats, the register spits out yet a new incentive.....next time up at bat&nbsp;I will save a dollar if I&nbsp;purchase three packages.&nbsp; So, sure enough, I&nbsp;stagger back in and&nbsp;pick up&nbsp;three, feeling&nbsp;rather cocky&nbsp;about being such a smart shopper.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm&nbsp;receiving&nbsp;some nutritional benefit&nbsp;to all this madness&nbsp;in that I have to eat several boxes of frozen spinach that have been taking up room in my freezer in order to make room for the popsicles.   This next&nbsp;"chapter" sounds preposterous but is, in fact, true.&nbsp; The last coupon I received offered me the same savings of one dollar for the purchase of  five  boxes.&nbsp; I read it&nbsp;and stood there wondering if my neighbors would be offended if I asked for spare room in their freezers.&nbsp; I considered the consequences of suggesting my&nbsp;landlady put a household deep freezer in the basement of our house.&nbsp;&nbsp; I speculated on which of the residents in my 4-plex might be trustworthy enough to hold my booty in the&nbsp;hypothetical deepfreeze or in their own freezers (stored there&nbsp;at my behest, but why share?!).&nbsp; I couldn't help but&nbsp;flash on those anti-drugs ads&nbsp;from the 80's and early 90's.&nbsp;&nbsp;You'd see a Willy Horton-esque dude hanging around an upscale playground offering free drugs to&nbsp;all white sixth graders through a chain-linked fence&nbsp;at recess.&nbsp;The implication being&nbsp;that&nbsp;the evil bad black man with the afro pic in his back pocket would return charging more and more until the poor&nbsp;surburban kid&nbsp;was hooked and his life forever ruined.&nbsp; I imagined myself&nbsp; and the absurdity of walking home with five, then seven, then nine and eventually eleven boxes of Edy's frozen fruit bars.   It was not a pretty picture but it kinda cracked me up.&nbsp; I've been fruit bar free for&nbsp;three days now and I'm staying away from John's. It's the best&nbsp;I can do.&nbsp; I'm already over budget for the month and if I'm going to blow money, I'd rather spend it on decent coffee or a book every once and a while.&nbsp; Despite how much fun I&nbsp;had shopping w/&nbsp;my mother, I have learned the hard way it's not what I save, it's  what  I spend, darn it.

      Revealing little quote on  I, Fatty  the new book about Fatty Arbuckle by Jerry " Permanent Midnight " Stahl. May I pose the theory that Mr. Depp has been offered the lead role and has accepted.&nbsp; The ways things go in Follywood whether or not any of this actually comes to pass is a&nbsp;major long shot but little clues such as this glowing "review" are often indications of such things. Does anyone still read the trades?&nbsp;   &nbsp;  "Finally, the true skinny on Fatty....Jerry Stahl brilliantly gives life, voice, truth and respect to Roscoe Arbuckle. I LOVE THIS BOOK!!!"

      My goodness,&nbsp; Martha is being helpful already (reference the post before this one)!&nbsp; Now I have an attainable goal for myself. Congratulations Dave Zobel!&nbsp; I feel for those contestants who dared to outwit the judges.&nbsp; It's like those old&nbsp;bats in the south used to tell me all the time when I was growing up, "Don't be too big for your britches, young lady!" I ignored them for the most part.&nbsp; I'm going to have quote my friend Laura again on this, "If I'd wanted to be popular, I'd have done alot of things differently."&nbsp; Amen.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;    Martha Stewart Inspires Bad-Writing Winner     Mon Jul 19, 7:07 PM ET    By RACHEL KONRAD, Associated Press Writer  SAN JOSE, Calif. - A California man claimed top honors Monday at the annual Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest celebrating bad writing, likening the end of a love affair to "Martha Stewart ripping the sand vein out of a shrimp's tail."&nbsp;    Dave Zobel, 42, a Manhattan Beach software development director and author of "Dave Zobel's Bent Book of Boatspeak: How to Sound Like a Sailor and Know Just Enough to Be Dangerous," bested thousands of metaphor-mangling, simile-slaying writers from Hong Kong to Bolivia with this submission:   "She resolved to end the love affair with Ramon tonight ... summarily, like Martha Stewart ripping the sand vein out of a shrimp's tail ... though the term 'love affair' now struck her as a ridiculous euphemism ... not unlike 'sand vein,' which is after all an intestine, not a vein ... and that tarry substance inside certainly isn't sand ... and that brought her back to Ramon."   The competition pays mocking homage to the Victorian author whose 1830 novel "Paul Clifford" opened with this all-too-familiar phrase: "It was a dark and stormy night."   "I never won and wasn't expecting to this year, but to be honest I'm a little jealous of people who won dishonorable mentions because that title would look better on the resume," the father of two told The Associated Press. He won $250.   Runner-up was Pamela Patchet Hamilton, of Beaconsfield, Quebec, who described her style as "Dave Barry with a feminist twist." Patchet, who has written humor essays for The (Montreal) Gazette and other newspapers, impressed judges with this putrid passage:   "The notion that they would no longer be a couple dashed Helen's hopes and scrambled her thoughts not unlike the time her sleeve caught the edge of the open egg carton and the contents hit the floor like fragile things hitting cold tiles, more pitiable because they were the expensive organic brown eggs from free-range chickens, and one of them clearly had double yolks entwined in one sac just the way Helen and Richard used to be," she wrote.   Scott Rice, the San Jose State University professor who started the contest in 1982, said this year's entries were unusually witty. "Sometimes the entrants are more clever than the judges," he said. "Those people generally lose."

      &nbsp;  by Elizabeth Bishop    The art of losing isn't hard to master;  so many things seem filled with the intent  to be lost that their loss is no disaster.   Lose something every day. Accept the fluster  of lost door keys, the hour badly spent.  The art of losing isn't hard to master.   Then practice losing farther, losing faster:  places, and names, and where it was you meant  to travel. None of these will bring disaster.   I lost my mother's watch. And look! my last, or  next-to-last, of three loved houses went.  The art of losing isn't hard to master.   I lost two cities, lovely ones. And, vaster,  some realms I owned, two rivers, a continent.  I miss them, but it wasn't a disaster.   --Even losing you (the joking voice, a gesture  I love) I shan't have lied. It's evident  the art of losing's not too hard to master  though it may look like (Write it!) like disaster.

      Well, the latest is that&nbsp;dear Martha Stewart is planning to "write" a book in order to help others who might find themselves in such nightmare similar to one she just survived.&nbsp; She wishes to be of service to others needing to navigate the legal system and in determining who they should trust (hhmmm.....).&nbsp; Who needs friends or lawyers when they've got Ms. Stewart? So in reference to the last paragraph of the  supposed &nbsp;transcript below,&nbsp; apparently it did not take her too long to&nbsp;figure out&nbsp;something else&nbsp;she wanted to do besides continue to sell Americans her already&nbsp;existing empire.  &nbsp;  It has always been my contention that white-collar crime&nbsp;generally pays.&nbsp; One of the sweet gals who works in John's Grocery summed up the&nbsp;MS verdict quite well the other evening when she said, "Ah, poor girl."&nbsp; Hey, do think it's true that Michael Jackson has found another "poor girl" to father quadtruplets ( is that the correct term) for him? That's some pretty scary shit.  &nbsp;    Transcript of Martha Stewart statement     The Associated Press   Text of Martha Stewart's statement outside the courthouse:   Today is a shameful day. It's shameful for me, and for my family, and for my beloved company, and for all of its employees and partners. What was a small personal matter came over the  became over the last two years an almost fatal circus event of unprecedented proportions.  I have been choked and almost suffocated to death during that time, all the while more concerned about the well-being of others than for myself, more hurt for them and for their losses than for my own, more worried for their futures than the future of Martha Stewart the person.   More than 200 people have lost their jobs at my company as a result of this situation. I want them to know how very, very sorry I am for them and their families.  I would like to thank everybody who stood by me, who wished me well, waved to me on the street like these lovely people over here, smiled at me, called me, wrote to me. We received thousands of support letters, and more than 170,000 e-mails to marthatalks.com, and I appreciate each and every one of those pieces of correspondence. I really feel good about it.   Perhaps all of you out there can continue to show your support by subscribing to our magazine, by buying our products, by encouraging our advertisers to come back in full-force to our magazines.&nbsp; Our magazines are great. They deserve your support, and whatever happened to me personally shouldn't have any effect whatsoever on the great company Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia. And I don't want to use this as a sales pitch for my company, but we love that company, we've worked so hard on that company, and we really think it merits great attention from the American public.   And I'll be back. I will be back. Whatever I have to do in the next few months, I hope the months go by quickly. I'm used to all kinds of hard work, as you know, and I'm not afraid. I'm not afraid whatsoever. I'm just very, very sorry that it's come to this, that a small personal matter has been able to be blown out of all proportion, and with such venom and such gore, I mean it's just terrible.   We are going to appeal so I'm not going to talk about the case. ... I want to thank Bob Morvillo and his whole team for doing the very best job they could do in defending me."

      As often as I try to pick another poem of his to prefer or inspire me during&nbsp;one of my&nbsp;dark nights of the soul, I cannot.&nbsp; There are plenty of literary experts out there who will tell you it would be a sin to appropriate or seperate any one line from any of the others but I did it once anyway. I cannot beg for pardon.&nbsp; It was the last line in the third stanza, the one that is based on Anthony's speech to Cleopatra.&nbsp; Come to think of it, I titled the poem "any of" and I really like that poem.&nbsp; I really  love  this poem.&nbsp; Hope you enjoy it.&nbsp; MacNeice' wife had left him for another man when he penned this, taking his only child with her.&nbsp; What sheer beauty such pain can offer up to the world.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;    The Sunlight on the Garden    &nbsp;  The sunlight on the garden  Hardens and grows cold,  We cannot cage the minute  Within its nets of gold,  When all is told  We cannot beg for pardon.   Our freedom as free lances  Advances towards its end;  The earth compels, upon it  Sonnets and birds descend;  And soon, my friend,  We shall have no time for dances.   The sky was good for flying  Defying the church bells  And every evil iron  Siren and what it tells:  The earth compels,  We are dying, Egypt, dying   And not expecting pardon,  Hardened in heart anew,  But glad to have sat under  Thunder and rain with you,  And grateful too  For sunlight on the garden.

      Will he or won't he? That was the question. We were playing cards when someone called and asked if we had heard what was going on. OJ Simpson had a gun to his head and was leading the cops on a low speed chase down some highway in southern California. "No way!" I responded to this late-breaking development. "Yes way!" my friend Lisa replied. The game came to a predictable and sudden halt as we all rushed into the bedroom and gathered around the television.  Sure enough there he was in the now infamous Ford Bronco cruising down the road with (and my guests and I thought this aspect of the LIVE ACTION dramafest must certainly be a collective visual hallucination) people cheering him on. Okay, we weren't just playing cards. We had ourselves a small game of poker going. Very small stakes and none of us play anymore, as far as I know. The point is, we were already in a betting frame of mind.   There were six of us, three women and three men. I'm a poet and the other two girls were as well. The males in the group were comprised of an elected official, a law student and a guy who I believe was doing graduate work in biochemistry. Gamblers that we were, we started arguing and calling out odds on whether or not "The Juice" was going to off himself. As things so often do, it eventually came down to a gender. We girls were convinced he was going to blow his brains out and the boys claimed to have no doubt whatsoever that he would never do it. No one ever actually put any money on the bed, thank goodness. We Platharoos would have lost, dag nab it!   Later that night, I asked my chum, Henry, why he'd been so certain that Simpson was not going to pull the trigger. He admitted that, in fact, he'd had no idea what was going to happen but he'd suspected that anyone as self-serving and cruel as OJ Simpson would probably never injure his own pretty head. He asked me why I thought my friends and I had been so convinced OJ would take his own life. I  told  him we chick poets are cliches of ourselves. It wasn't inconceivable in the least to imagine anyone committing suicide. I knew for a fact each of us had tried it ourselves at least once in the past. He shook his head in dismay and went outside for a cigarette. I proceeded to clean up the kitchen. I didn't smoke then. I started up again on a small scale. I'm one of those weird people who seem to be able to do that and only smoke 3 or 4 sticks a day.  Maybe I'm kidding myself.  Playing with fire? Man, that reminds me of a friggin' killer Stones song.

      Democratic presidential candidate and front-runner, John Kerry has blown it with his choice of North Carolina Senator John Edwards as his running mate. I'll tell you why and who he should have have chosen. Everyone knows that Kerry is married to the woman who inherited a barge load of money. The Heinz fortune as you may recall? In America if you have enough scratch you can pay to have any silly 'ol rule changed, so the fact that Tobey is only in his 20's is not an issue. If you don't know why this might be a problem for a less "fortunate" candidate, I'm going to suggest you take an American Civics class (good luck on those loans) or hit the search engine of your choice.    Next issue, please. Howard Dean is credited with bringing in thousands of zealous, young voters onto the electoral dance floor with his "do the hustle" campaign and these kids love Tinseltown. Heck, Tinseltown loved Dean. They were falling all over themselves to hit the road for the guy. Some of my favorite people love Howard, okay? These sweet peas (young voters) need a new hero. They need someone they can relate to. Who they think is cute and available. Call me skeptical but I don't think a married white guy with a skippy boy hairdo and 2 little kidlets is all that inspiring to this battalion of college students. I live in a university town and I'll tell you what...these  idealists all love Maguire and everybody loves Spiderman. He's number one at the box office two weeks in a row.   Kerry would have been wise to have chosen a Superhero. Given the xenophobic atmosphere of this nation, Spidey could have spun a big web over the mainland and kept out all the those pesky foreigners who are coming in and gobbling up all our jobs and looking for a better life. He could have enlisted some of his other superhero pals to go ahead and either blow up or mow down the statue of liberty and get it over with. Didn't Lou Reed suggest this during the Reagan administration? MY VP choice would just get the job done. Forget about explaining away a vote for The Patriot Act (unlike Sen. Edwards) or any other such silliness. If some naive citizen were trying to check out  Huck Finn  from their local library, we'd have a vice-president who could just web the entire building shut until the offensive reader (or soon to be "thwarted reader" as Umberto Eco would refer to him or her) could be brought to justice.    Now here's something that is especially sweet. Imagine the debate between Dick Cheney and Tobey Maguire/Spiderman. When Cheney begins to defend an exceptionally offensive stance on, say, Iraq & Halliburton, my suggestion for Kerry's VP would merely have to lift up his arm, drop his hand down in a palm out position and zap-web the sucker's lips shut.    Yessirbob. John Kerry blew it. Big time. As Dorothy Parker would have asked, "What fresh hell is this?" Why don't these guys ever ask me anything?

      edited version published in the July issue of  The Iowa Source    Dear Meg,   I have a 27 month old daughter, Felicity, who is prone to these incredible temper tantrums, I am currently reading  The Emotional Life of a Toddler  to try and help me figure her out! Whenever we attend playgroup it's a challenge to keep her from leaving bite marks on one of my friend's children when she throws one her fits. I'm very embarrassed by this. Is there is any etiquette for such situations? Can you help me with my daughter?   Paul    My Dear Paul,   Of course, I can help you, That's what I am here for. I am sorry Miss Felicity is giving you a rough time and having one herself. To be perfectly honest, I'm beginning to question this whole culture of insight and I'd suggest tossing out the book. Sometimes the proverbial tomato is just the proverbial tomato. They don't call them the terrible two's for nothing. Easy for me to say, I know. If she were my child I'd be calling in the National Guard, the Navy SEALS, a specialist or five from the National Institutes of Health and, possibly, an exorcist. Either that or I'd be wrapping my head in a bath towel followed by aluminum foil in an attempt to shield myself from the noise and the emotional turmoil of being subjected to my offspring's misery.   As for the biting, have you seen those new style leashes called "Gentle Leaders" which they have for dogs? It's a contraption that allows one's pooch to breathe through it's nose but not open it's mouth. Any decent veterinarian or pet shop should have one. Your friends might find this method a bit barbaric but if it spares you the expense of future stitches, the embarrassment and possible resentment of your peers, I'd take that risk given that we find ourselves living in such a litigious time. I'd be devastated to hear that a member of your playgroup decided to take legal action against you simply because sweet Felicity behaved quite normally for her age. Now that would be extremely rude! Friends should never sue one another. Give her some time, Paul, I have little doubt Felicity will blossom into the full glory of her name in two shakes of a lamb's tail.   Thank you for trusting me with your query.   Love,   Meg    Dear Meg,   Last month I was watching the Euro '04 soccer game in my favorite bar when that adorable 18 year old, Wayne Rooney, grabbed another two goals for England giving them a 4-2 win over Croatia. I promptly joined the merriment and got completely hammered. I woke at lunchtime and found two phone numbers in my pocket with no names. Should I phone and wing it? What's appropriate in this situation?   Heather    My Dear Heather,   I can assure you I would be on to anyone who was winging it about not remembering my name from the night before. I suppose the question for you is whether or not you want to spend your time with a "boy" who would not be savvy enough to pick up on this sort of tomfoolery. My dear girl, what makes you think these numbers are necessarily from a member of the opposite sex anyway? I'll bet while you were getting your groove on there was more than one foxy lady throwing a glance your way and quite possibly a slip of paper.   It's important to bear in mind that the recipient of your call could be on to you and just in it for a free meal or a little tip-toeing through the tulips, if you get my drift. Additionally, there's more than a small chance that in your post-game joviality you tripped the light fantastic with the dreaded Amway sales person, an alien walk-in akin to Dick Cheney or you could well have the phone number of the man of your dreams. I suppose there is only way to find out. If you have that modern phone feature which blocks your number when making outgoing calls, I would recommend using it. I'd also suggest employing a bit more caution in the your post-football celebrations. Call me old fashioned, I tend to like it when a potential suitor rings me up and actually remembers my name and what I look like.   I am pleased you were stateside, Heather. Had you been in a small town in northern UK where soccer fans are a bit more robust, you could well have ended up with a black eye and a busted lip. I know I don't have to remind you what bad manners violence is. Good luck with your digits!   Thank you for trusting me with your query.   Meg

      She told him she loves Utah and he sent her little stories about Moab over the internet. They met working on a social reform issue/newspaper they both believe in. He doesn't drink or smoke. He admitted he was worried about the outfit he wore on their first date. She fussed a little over her getup as well but not excessively. He called her when he said he was going to call. He walked her to Union Station. They are not dietarily compatible but, good grief, who is not willing to make concessions or expects perfection. He was nervous on their first date and she realized this and cut him some slack, OF COURSE. Anyone who does not make exceptions for this most basic and human of phenomena deserves to spend the rest of their lives alone, if you ask me.   I'm choosing to be happy for my friend today & relate a little story about manners and tolerance. It's a small story but I think it's got a lot of potential.

      Okay, let's get one thing straight from the get-go, I am no fan of McDonald's or any of the corporate evils that have been associated with them over the years. As my previous posts have probably indicated I am not much of an advocate of greed or mass consumption of any kind. So what's my problem with all the rave reviews for "Super Size Me"? The answers are complicated. When the film first came out I was talking to a friend about it and he said, "Crap, I'd just be happy if someone would buy me a meal at McDonald's." Another friend said that as he was running around working the three jobs he has to work in order to pay all his bills, he occasionally finds himself at the Big M. He purchases a grilled chicken sandwich. He also had the decency to tell me he felt badly relating this story to me as I am unemployed and he is fortunate enough to  have  three jobs. What a champ.  Marlon Brandon just died at the age of 80. No word on the cause yet and I'm dreadfully out of the loop on most things Follywood. However, I once had it on very good authority that dear Marlon was so hooked on Big Macs and so bloody tired of having his privacy invaded that he made a deal with his local Micky Dees. One of the employee's would drive up to the wall of his estate and toss a big bag of the double stackers over the side for one of his serfs to retrieve. Hell, if you believe everything you hear and everything you read OJ and Kato had a swell meal under the golden arches just a few hours before "you know what" happened. Perhaps, it's more dangerous to be married to someone who eats fastfood? Just a question.  Clearly there are many important, far reaching questions at issue here and I'm merely making an argument to serve the points I wish to make. For instance, if I needed more evidence that eating huge amounts of fat, beef and sugar were bad for me I'd be the first one the list to sign up for ownership of my own copy of the DVD. I felt the same way about Errol Morris' "The Fog of War". Yep, Robert MacNamara was a slimeball and the Vietnam War was evil and wrong. Do I need to be reminded? May I also note that MacNamara is an old dude who used to be "famous" and gets a free shot at re-glorification by doing the public remorse deal. Hey, it worked for Hugh Grant.  Here's an idea. Let's all  S U P E R  S I Z E  ourselves, shall we? One big theater of the absurd. I'm film you if you film me. We'll pool our resources and book a theater. I would not be working on this blog if I did not have larger ambitions (note use of word "large"). In the mean time, would someone buy my friend Daniel a happy meal? The low-carb version, of course.

      The 1980's  are  over despite the return of en vogue hairstyles that resemble lead vocalist Mike Score from Flock of Seagulls. Last I heard those guys were on a reunion tour. Pass. I've received a few voice messages and emails this week from a guy I dated very briefly last Fall who is jetting into town this weekend for the Jazz Festival. At the age of 48 he has decided to become a documentary filmmaker when he grows up and is here to work on a shot. He thinks despite my repeated attempts to decline his offers that I am going to put my life on hold during his visit and volunteer my time, recruit others, surrender all my hard-earned IC contacts and no doubt sleep with him while he's in town.  His method of persuasion -- say it and it will be so. Remember Shakti Gawain? Creative Visualization? Affirmations and the subsequent offspring of this hybrid of simplistic, mindless spiritual malarkey? The kind of quick fix Godsmack akin to putting a coke spoon up your nose or a needle in your arm. During this period I went to chant a few times with the Tina Turner Buddhists. One guy said he got a spot on Soul Train and a woman said it definitely worked for her because she "manifested" a brand new washer and dryer. Just like winning a prize on The Newlywed Game. Gee whiz, perhaps I should have stuck it out. I'm still trekking off to the local laundramat.  I was tempted to tell this guy go the hell. He actually told me he was glad I was willing to put "all my weekend plans on hold" and that he "expected to hear from me when he arrived at his suite at the Sheraton on Friday evening." I just wrote him back and said that professionals knew people got paid to do the things he was asking me to do and if he was in a pinch I'd work for cash. What I really wanted to do was to tell him to take a manners class. Also, as much as I am opposed to book burning, I'd suggest he throw all his 1980's new age spiritual hocus pocus books onto the bon fires of his vanity.   Does anyone out there remember when Dawkins first published his theory about the selfish gene?

      I just finished Susan Cheever's bio of Bill Wilson and it seems he  was , in fact, a sexaholic and much of the writing in the two sacred texts of AA were written from his subjective (read~ guilt-ridden) POV on this problem. Some of the more entertaining items I came across in the book were discovering BW wanted to name the book,  Alcoholics Anonymous ,  The Bill Wilson Movement  and that he spent three years experimenting with LSD in the late 50's as a possible cure for his smoking. Oh, here's another good one, the reason it's refered to as the BIG BOOK is because Wilson was disappointed that his colleagues wouldn't allow him to publish the thing in the original monsterously long draft it was, so Wilson got them to use the thickest paper they could afford and had 'em use especially large type. He started refering to it as the BIG BOOK in order to compensate for what he perceived as a slight. In fairness, it seems he came to see the wisdom of all these group decisions but who knows, this is all Cheever's interpretation and then my interpretation of her's to boot. Iowa City writer, Mary Allen ( The Rooms of Heaven ) might be comforted to learn that Wilson and his pals were very into the Quiji (sp?), automatic writing and communicating with the dead. Cheever says Wilson once saw spirits in the kitchen of his house in Vermont.  All in all, it's an entertaining book and carries a strong message about never making any one person or method of self-betterment the be all and end all. Cheever's focus on class is annoying and tiresome esp. when she tries to justify it by saying it was Wilson who was obsessed by issues of money and class. There is not much evidence of that in anything she reveals about her subject. Ultimately, the reader comes to know a very sad guy. Bill suffered from long and debilitating depressions, cried around almost everyone, was a slave to his sexual impulses, nicotine and was driven into exile by the fame he once desperately sought. He abandoned his own program for a very long time and it's not entirely clear if he ever truely came back into the fold near the end of his life. Despite these things, it seems he never stopped giving to others in need and was always willing to pull himself together when  he  was needed. That sort of generosity and willingness to question even the program he had a huge hand in giving birth to is what I call "way cool".

      A weekly email newsletter I receive asked what its readers thought of the three zillion herkazoids littering the sidewalks and parks-- providing photo op's for the super eager parents of kids here for freshbeing orientation (am I gay, lesbian, bi , a tranie?). I've been wondering if the Herkys might be edible after their tenure frightening small children in and around the Iowa City/Coralville vicinity. Many people in the poorest nations in Africa survive on a root vegetable called manioc that has no nutritional value to speak of but does fill the belly and provide a smidgen of carbohydrates. Manioc is boiled and then mashed into a moderately edible paste.  I emailed a few University and Iowa City big wigs about the possibility of doing something like this with a Herky or four but I never heard back from anyone. I was shocked. In Washington, DC, the city is up in arms about the Pandas they've got everywhere. Hell, The Washington Post is covering the story. I think what we've got happening here is one big Herkygate. We need a Carl, a Bob and our very own deepthroat. With all things, all you really need to do is follow the money.  Any takers? My reputation around here is bad enough. Of course, that might be the very reason I should take this on. What do I care what people think anymore. Okay, the truth is I suspect most people who've known me for as long as I've been around actually think fairly highly of me. Maybe even a few new friends, as well. My real hope at the moment is that most of my readers find these silly Herkys as ridiculous and as big of a waste of money that could have been spent on real human needs as I do (phew, what a bear of a sentence).  Hey, way to go to the University Tennis team for having to be thrown off the courts by the police before the bulldozers came in to mow down the only outdoor courts in order to make way for the bigger, brighter, new & improved Kinnick stadium. Jeez, I hate to sound like such a WASP but tennis is such a beautiful and dignified sport. I'm about the worst player you will ever meet. My idea of a successful game is keeping a volley going--actually hitting the ball to the person on the other side of the net and having them return the favor. It's preferable if you've got a foursome who share a similiar definition of a "good game" because then you end up running around less and have more people around to laugh at how pathetic your game is. Tennis one of the few sports I love to watch others play (basketball &amp; soccer being the others). My father has played all his life and still gets a round in every morning even at age of 72. I used to love watching him dash around the court, esp. with my "Uncle" John (he's actually my uncle about 4 times removed). They were amazing and when they  played  ping-pong you couldn't even see the ball it moved back and forth so quickly and with such precision. My friends and I watched in awe. We'd take a whirl at it when they were done, play miserably and then head up to my bedroom to set up Barbie's Dream House, her Camper and put Ken at the wheel of her red convertible.  The thing about tennis is that no one is crushing anybody else. There's no tackling, no hitting of one another, no pumped up, excessive muscle groups. In that sense it was akin to playing with Barbie and her pals --Ken, Midge and little cousin Skipper. Sure, every once and awhile we'd get wild and have Ken crawl on top of Barbie and have at it but that's about as daring as it ever got. Ultimately, Barbie and all her friends got haircuts and dye jobs from yours truly. Too bad punk didn't make it to the suburbs of Charlotte as quickly as it did NYC. Eventually I got wild and more daring. Charlotte was too small town for me. I headed north as often as possible, hitting some of the holy grails of the NY nightlife scene --CDGBs, the Peppermint Lounge, Elaine's (shitty pesto, fyi) -- when I probably should have been learning advanced calculus or something more useful than how to cop an eight ball. Hey, one time when a friend and I were staying in Times Square, "Deep Throat" was playing in the theater across from our hotel. There's a nice wrap for this little post although I have to add I have not been to NYC in almost 15 years and someone told me recently that Times Square has been completely Disney-fied which made me rather sad. Mindless, family fun schlock that serves to reinforce mediocrity and the status quo. I'm trying to remember which transcendentalist poet-philosopher warned that mediocrity would be the downfall of democracy. I want to say Emerson but I don't know if that's correct. It sure sounds like something he'd say, no?

       Thanks to Franklin Seiberling for passing this along. Now why on earth didn't I hear about this on NPR? I did enjoy the piece on "lemongate" this afternoon. Made me think of that old saying "when life gives you lemons, make lemonade." But what if the Department of Homeland Security has   sequestered and subsequently destroyed all the lemons thereby further alienating the Argentinians and the rest of the world and you have no lemons to beverage-ize? Xenophobia is just plain 'ol bad manners and is really fucking up the world.     OUTSOURCING ANNOUNCEMENT by Staff Reporter Melynda JillWashington D. C. -  Congress today announced that the Office of President of the United States will be outsourced to overseas as of June 30, the end of this fiscal year. The move is being made to save $400K a year in salary, a record $521 Billion in deficit expenditures and related overhead."The cost savings will be quite significant," says Congressman Adam Smith (R-Wash), who, with the aid of the Congress research arm, the General Accounting Office has studied outsourcing of American jobs extensively. We simply can no longer afford this level of outlay and remain competitive on the world stage," Congressman Smith said. Exporting American jobs has been a popular trend lately, ironically at the urging of President Bush.Mr. Bush was informed by email this morning of the termination of his position. He will receive health coverage, expenses and salary until his final day of employment. After that, with a two week waiting period, he will then be eligible for 240 dollars a week from unemployment insurance for 13 weeks.Unfortunately, he will not be able to receive state Medicaid health insurance coverage as his unemployment benefits are over the required limit."I'm in shock," Mr. Bush stated. "I thought for sure I'd have some job security around this here place. I have no idea what I'll do now," he further lamented.Preparations have been underway for some time for the job move.Sanji Gurvinder Singh of Indus Teleservices, Mumbai, India, will be assuming the Office of President of the United States as of July 1. Mr. Singh was born in the United States while his parents were here on student visas, thus making him eligible for the position. He will receive a salary of $320 a month but with no health coverage or other benefits.Due to the time difference between the US and India, Mr. Singh will be working primarily at night, when offices of the US Government will be open."I am excited to serve in this position," Mr. Singh stated in an exclusive interview. "Working nights will let me keep my day job at the American Express call center. I always knew I could be President someday."Congress stressed patience when calling Mr. Singh as he may not be fully aware of all the issues involved with his new position. A Congressional Spokesperson noted that Mr. Singh has been given a script tree to follow which will allow him to respond to most topics of concern. The Spokesperson further noted that "additional savings will be realized as these scripting tools have already been used previously by Mr. Bush here in the US. Such scripts will enable Mr. Singh to provide an answer without having to fully understand the issue itself."Congress continues to explore other outsourcing possibilities including that of Vice-president and most Cabinet positions.

      Blazing bunny spreads cricket club fire Fri Aug 13, 6:02 AM ET  LONDON (Reuters) - A rabbit set alight by a bonfire at a cricket club got its revenge when it ran burning into a hut and set it ablaze destroying costly equipment, the club says.  urlLink   Reuters Photo   Members of Devizes cricket club in Wiltshire were burning dead branches when a rabbit caught up in the waste sped burning from the flames spreading a fire which destroyed lawnmowers and tools worth 60,000 pounds. "After it had been going 5 minutes, the rabbit shot out of the bonfire on fire and went into the hut which is our equipment store," club chairman John Bedbrook told Reuters on Friday. Two fire engines were called to extinguish the blaze. The rabbit's skeleton was discovered in the charred hut.  "The firemen were certainly concerned about the rabbit. They felt sorry for it," said Bedbrook.

      To solve the world hunger crisis, it’s necessary to address the root causes of hunger. The current international economic system, has increased income inequalities, poverty and hunger worldwide. The IMF and the World Bank have forced the debt-stricken states in the South to adopt policies of liberalization, deregulation and privatization. The globalized system of food production and trade favors large TNCs and reliance on export crops while discriminating against small-scale farmers and subsistence crops. AIDS is another cause of hunger. In societies affected by AIDS, famine is more deadly and difficult to combat. AIDS attacks the most productive age group, typically the men and women working in agricultural production.  Global climate change leads to an increased number of weather-related disasters such as floods and droughts, which cause food shortages and famine.*  Military conflicts disrupt food production and distribution. Moreover increased global military spending diverts spending from social and economic development. Oppressive regimes and corruption can also cause hunger, by draining scarce funds away from those most in need.  * Just in case anyone was wondering what the connection  was  between driving a gas-guzzling SUV or Hummer and world hunger, I thought I'd fill in the blanks.

       Jeez, I'm reading so much I forgot half of what I'd read lately when I made this list the other day.  Here's a more comprehensive list.  A number of these books are out of print but that's one of reasons the great Goddess invented the internet, I suppose.   I'm eagerly awaiting the first used copy of  Sore Winners  by John Powers to hit Murphy-Brookfield. I've been a fan of his column in LA weekly for some time.  I'd also recommend the following books which I'm enjoying or have enjoyed recently:   Food and Loathing  by Betsy Lerner  The Merry Recluse  by Caroline Knapp  Einstein's Dreams  by Alan Lightman (I've read this book at least 84 times and still love it)  Truth and Beauty  by Ann Patchett (this one makes the list for its cluelessness alone, not too mention it's not bad in the gossip department if you're a writer)  Tender in the Night  by F. Scott Fitzgerald  A Million Little Pieces  by James Frey  The Journalist and the Murderer  by Janet Malcolm  Seven Tattoos  by Peter Tractenberg  'Zine  by Pagan Kennedy  It was Today  by Andrei Codrescu  What Do We Know  by Mary Oliver  Passwords  by William Stafford (okay, anything by Stafford)  One Art  by Elizabeth Bishop (oh my-- real letters-- what a lost art... indeed)  Farming  by Wendell Berry ( I read this almost daily, it's the closest thing to a bible I own)

      While walking to the library to use the free internet (a mere 3.5 blocks), I passed 13 SUVs, each with only one driver and 2 Hummers  equally passenger free. Do I still live in Iowa City?Meanwhile the Horn of Africa is facing its worst drought/starvation since 1974 and that one was unmatched in its history. Over a million people will be faced with famine or death and even the Wall Street Journal admits that the "economic recovery" has only affected the wealthiest Americans (the top 4-5%). While I hope to hell I am wrong, every fiber in my being and veteran politico instinct tells me that we are in for 4 more years of Cheney, Bush and Rumsfeld. The sad thing about these Suburban Assault Vehicle owners is they probably don't even get the connection between what they drive and millions going hungry in Africa. Most of them will probably vote for John Kerry and feel as if they did a good thing for humanity. Oh well. Keep on living the good life. As for the American dream of having 2.3 kids, owning a nice house in the suburbs and getting deeper and deeper into debt.......I guess that's why they call it a "dream".  I seem to have gotten myself involved in a pointless argument over email with a well-meaning guy who believes this election is one of hope and that I have somehow lost my voice. I started another rebuttal and then it occurred to me that life was too short. I had a column to write and I'm still dealing with the Bob Edwards thing of being unable to suffer fools. This guy once told me he thought I was a "bitch" because I had facilitated a meeting with a steady hand because I had been asked to make certain the meeting lasted no more than 90 minutes and that's what I did. Oh well. If you ask me, this election has nothing to do with hope. What is happening in this country is terrifying. Of course, I've been saying this for close to 30 years. I've been voluntarily arrested for my beliefs and had the honor of standing in silent vigil with the late Phil Berrigan on the anniversary of the bombing of Hiroshima. Hell, I was a party girl but I was a party girl with a conscience.  Anyway, I've always liked strong women. My 8 year niece, Emma, keeps confirming my intuition and meeting my best expectations as she continues to be the most positive female role model in my life. She and my nephew, Sam, were visiting my parents in North Carolina a few weeks ago and one night Sam (who is 6) had his heart set on going to McDonald's for Chicken McNuggets. Emma, on the other hand, was determined to go to the little Mexican place she had heard my parents speak so highly of. My mother tried to explain to Emma that Grandmother and Granddaddy had promised Sam he could go to McDonald's. Well, Emma wasn't having any of it. She just said, "Oh don't worry,  I  can handle Sam." She dashed off into bedroom where he was watching television and in less than 60 seconds, Sam came skipping into the den, exclaiming, "Alright!!! We're going to go eat  Mexican !"  You could say Emma had manipulated Sam to get what she wanted but, hell, no one else really wanted to go to McDonalds. They all ended up with a much healthier meal and a small locally-owned business got supported as a result Emma knowing what she wanted and speaking her mind. If Sam has his mind set on something he is not so easily swayed, I promise you.  A few weeks ago, Emma and I were talking on the phone and she asked me what I was going to be doing for the "remainder of the day." I swear she talks like this, "the remainder of the day", how can I not adore her? I told her I was going to clean my apartment and do some laundry. She replied, "Aunt Meg, are you crazy? Why don't you have a party and eat a lot of cake?" In the background I heard my mother say, "No Emma, remember, Aunt Meg lives in Iowa." Emma said, "Oh yeah, I forgot." Hell, you'd think with all these Follywood wannabes driving around in their SUVs and Hummers there might be a decent party or four going on every once and awhile. Of course, being a somewhat strong, outspoken women in the Midwest has not put me on the top of anyone's guest list. I was hanging out at the Java House the other night reading the  Times  and yet another European man with exceptional manners struck up a conversation with me. Hey, before any rumors start flying he's married, okay? Anyway, the topic came around to the culture here and why so many people are so passive-aggressive. I've been trying to figure that one out for 12 plus years.  In some roundabout way this is related to the reason I have never cared for the public weeper. In my experience that person is the first to turn on you and bite off your hand. It's the old White Hunter's adage, that the wounded animal is the most dangerous one of all. At this point in my tenure here in Iowa, I much prefer the people who are honest about their feelings, resentments and anger to those who are not. The most likeable thing I've heard about Dubya to date is that he supposedly told some Senator that his daughters were a "pain in the ass."  Time to go eat a tomato sandwich. I've never cared much for summer. Around this time of year, I begin to feel as if I have mono, but if there is one thing I am extremely grateful for it is tomato sandwiches. Hell, I may even go crazy and have two of them.
