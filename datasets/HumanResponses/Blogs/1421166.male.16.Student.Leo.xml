						   Argh...12.36!!!!  There was PE lesson today! Argh...got tested for 2.4 km run and got 12.36 timing! deprove by 37seconds!!! aiya...must train already. Then had this muscle ache all over me, which was a total hindrance in the run. Then after that, we played floorball...yippee!!! But I'm on the losing team again. =( Nevermind la, i had fun anyway.  Shuts...didn't write my journal last night again...I think I enter here more even. At least I did my Quiet Time. Oh ya...was glad to hear from Yen. Hope she's doing fine. Then had my practise after school today.Wah...practise for 1hour, was so bored by the same old piece that I just decided to play something else...like canon!!! Tried to play until my fingers all ache. And made a decision...that is to learn piano. I've always wanted to learn it. It's the nicest instrument I think. And after that, I'll learn guitar! Then I'll know three instruments! Whoa! That's what I call music maker!!!hehe...ok...better go. But before I go, to all my brothers and sisters out there, persevere in faith!!!=)

						   Training...*pant pant*  Today, I came home early again! hehe! Slacker la. But came home watch a bit of TV and went to Pasir Panjang Hill to train, then came home and did my sets. I feel fit now...haha! But I'm suppose to do this thrice a week, I think i'll just die...oops...won't la. Then only very little homework again. So hope I'll write in my journal. Then today like quite happy =), I think cause handed in all my homework and didn't get scolded. Just now went to my jie's blog, she asked how am I...hehe...I'm fine jie!!!How about you!!!...hehe...ok...hope to see her again soon. There was Physics Class Test just now...argh...didn't study. But funny i knew what to say, I think maybe i just wrote crap. And tried to make a tag board...I'm a failure, cause it spoils the whole page, so I did away with it. There's "Bachelor" on tonight. Used to like watching it, but after reading "I kissed dating goodbye" by Joshua Harris, decided that it suggested the world's view on "love" based on feelings, better known as passionate lust. So no way I'm watching it, cause there's a subtle influence. Ya, Lord guide me! Yeah...ok...better be off...You can contact me at han48seeker@hotmail.com

						   Little homework  Yippee!!! Only have one E math assignment to complete, which is on congruent triangles...haha, how hard can it get. My friend took 15 minutes to complete. Today, school was normal, except that Mr Wong didn't come, so read my book. completed 2 chapters today! There's a sense of satisfaction now. hehe. Also talked a bit with Nat during recess today, ya...got to know some more things about him. And today after school, had sectionals. Wah...very tiring, cause long time didn't practise. Then after sectionals my SL talked to Yiz and me. He say the Sec 3s have to work together now...then he say he's going to pump the Sec 3s clarinetist, cause my silly junior went to wash the clarinet!!!Oh no!!! I'm done for. Just hope he don't give us too much. Haiz...so many papers next week. Hope i do well this CA.

						   Learning to play the piano.  Well, forgot to enter here last night, cause I was so tired. But anyway, yesterday was great, cause I got back my Mother Tongue Paper, and topped the class for my paper 2. Yippee!!! hehe...then had band practice. We played Persis again. But this time with Mr Tan. Phew...thank goodness he wasn't very particular about the running notes, cause I couldn't play them properly and neither could alot of my section members. But it was ok la...he focused on attack and articulation more...then we tried Merry Widow for Musical World. Very nice!!! Then today, I had to go to school again for band. Had sectionals. haiz...I feel so lousy. Not being able sight read well. But guess it takes time. Maybe I just don't have the talent. Then we played Merry Widow during band practice again. But this time it's much nicer...then suddenly I can play more of Persis!!! "There can be miracles..." haha...but really enjoyed today's band practice.  Then, went for YF. I was like learning piano from Nat. But he just couldn't help me understand minor scales. Took so long, but made no progress. We did that until like 3pm. With all the YFers sitting down already. And cause Nat was the song leader also what. So everybody sit down there like listening to us like that. Then my jie just kept giggling away standing at my back. She's always like that. Guess she's just very joyful. haha...that's what people say. It's something good though. Then Min Er tried to understand what we're talking about, but to no avail of course..hehe...sorry Min Er, no offense here. We went for outreach after that. haiz...just didn't get to share. But we gave out alot of "tracks" (don't know how to spell), maybe God will work in His own way. After outreach, Junwen continued the job to help me understand minor scales. And now I noe. The minor scale is 3 semi-tones lower then the Major scale. Yeah...piano very nice what...but some people just don't like it. Wonder why...maybe cause I learnt it on my own accord.  We managed to catch a X-MEN 2 movie at 7pm sharp. It was so cool. all the special powers. I like Nightcrawler. But he looks really scary in the movie. I prefer him in the animation. Then Rogue and Iceman was so cool too! (Iceman was the "coolest", I mean his cold what.) So sad that Pyro joined Magneto. Sigh...but just a show la. Finally, back home. Somehow, I thinked I'm quite determined to learnt piano. I just hope I won't give up. OK...better sleep early tonight, there's church the next morning.

						   A Boring Holiday.  It's just afternoon on Labour Day, and I've been so bored this morning. The first thing I did when I woke up this morning, was pretty strange. I woke up and asked my mother to sign my declaration form??? Don't know what's gone into me. But I'm having quite a body ache, probably cause of the basketball and running yesterday. Then I watched Jimmy Neutron the Movie for a while.hehe...it's quite nice actually, until my father turned it off to watch his own show. Argh...actually, it's ok la...hehe. And somehow, I ended up playing World Cup and Age of Empires online, so you can imagine how bored I was. But guess I'll have to start with my homework soon. Now, I realised that quite a few people around me are "falling in love" hmm...can help some of them with some things I learned from the book I'm reading. But guess it's quite weird for me to do so anyway. I just hope that they'll understand what does true love mean. To me, one perfect example of love is set by what Jesus did for us. Yupz...at first I thought it was quite weird too, my mindset was," Hey! No way man! They are two different kinds of love!!!" But now, I realised that there is only one true meaning of love. That is doing what's best for the other person, and placing the person's spiritual growth first. Ya...that's my opinion. And Christ did just that. Yeah! Anybody want to know more can ask me. Actually, it'll be better if you read "I kissed dating goodbye" by Joshua Harris yourself. And his second book is good too. Ya... OK...back to reality. I'm so bored...argh...then jie cannot even come down from her house, so it's like super duper boring. And no one to talk to also. haiz...I think I'm the kind of person who likes company. But today will be boring. OK, got to go and finish some work. I'll probably be back again tonight.

						   Basketball!!!  Well, today was just another ordinary day, had the usual lessons and all. Then Mr Wee wasn't here again!!! That means time to study for my Physics test after scool. Which in the end, I didn't study for at all. But really don't know what to expect. Cause no idea what I was writing anyway. Well, at least won't be using it for L1R5...haha...Then there was a last minute decision of having sectionals. Argh...I was going to meet Baoshun to go BBC...but didn't care anyway, just left immediately after my paper. Then after thinking for very long, I decided to buy and ESV Bible. And I only paid $3.90 for it!!! Envious? hehe...well, ended up at Payar Lebar CC...playing basketball. But didn't really play la...just play a little and watched most of the time. I felt so lousy ( I am actually ), but played a little with our own people. And then practiced shooting and dribbling...yeah! Then after that went to Mac's for "dinner" Couldn't finish the fires again. But the conversation somehow lead to Geography then History. hehe...my Humanities subjects. I love history. Then ZQ wanted to challenge my History...but OK la...at least he couldn't deal with me when it came to Russia...haha...but it was all in Chinese. So a bit hard, but fun. Then had ZQ and Daxing send me home. Then Daxing was driving (hmm...wonder if he has a license???). Well, talked about History of China and some of those ideologies like Communism and even Confucianism. OK...gotta go and do my QT. Tomorrow's Labour Day. Hope can go jie's house to play basketball. Or study also can.

						   I'm so blessed!!!  Well, for some reason I feel so blessed this CA. Maybe it's cause today I had my Chinese Paper, and likely I'll be getting another A!!!Yeah!!! Then only 16 people passed Chemistry, Mr Wong said( he didn't want to let us know the marks yet.) But fortunately, I was one of the 16 who passed!!! Praise the Lord! I'm so blessed! Actually, I'm always blessed by God. OK, enough boasting about my results. hehe... Last night, about my bill, I was surprised that nobody scolded me at all. Really thankful. Then didn't felt stressed about my paper today at all...so just kept watching TV...and managed to catch Smallville. Then there was this scene of Cloe deleting pictures of Clark and herself on the computer. haiz...somehow reminded me of myself sometime back...haiz...shouldn't talk about it. Ya, but seriously, it's quite a nice, reflective show. So can I borrow Dustin's Smallville VCD please??? hehe...Ya, missed season one. Then I came home early today again, but not to study actually, cause my sisters and ZQ were watching Harry Potter. So once again, I was distracted. But I think I'll study later. And come to think of it, I have tons of E.math homework...haiz...and tomorrow's Physics paper. After all the good tidings, I'm finally going to fail one subject. Today, decided to start reading my book again. Talking about friendship with sisters-in-Christ in this chapter. Then he said, a friendship is when two people move towards a common goal. Then start to think what common goal I have with some of the sisters. And concluded, what he said was not necessarily true, cause my jie and me don't really have common goal what (well, maybe just that I don't know) and not like we're in love or something. So I have my own stand. Yeah...so what is friendship? hmm...ok...I'll go think about it. But any opinions, do tell me k? Send to my email: han48seeker@hotmail.com  Today, was very a very tiring day, probably cause I stayed up to watch Smallville last night...hehe...but yippee!!! I can go play basketball tomorrow night, cause it's Labour Day on Thursday! Feel like watching a movie. Matrix Reloaded will be out soon, so should I watch both X-men 2 and Matrix Reloaded??? Hmm...OK...don't care...see first la. OK gotta go finish my homework on Simlar Triangles(crap topic!)

						   Good news, but I'll get scolded.  Today, is my Chemistry Paper. Well, it was really OK, and I'm still hoping to get at least an A2. Then, I got back my Social Studies Paper. Was so over joyed you know. Cause I got second in class with an A1!!! I was so happy when Mr Khoo gave me my paper. Was like totally crazy!!! Kept asking people their marks, but quite mean la. hehe... Then, Ms Sheka( if that's how you spell it ), kept telling us about her date later in the evening during make-up. So funny, she a bit too transparent. Wonder if she notices.  Then, I came home practiced piano...try to la...then slack around. Now I found out that my broadband bill had exceeded and I'll be in for scolding. Don't think my achievements in results will matter anymore...haiz...God, give me joy and peace.

						   Updating...mass one!  Yesterday, I had band practice in the morning. But so happens, I had chemistry make-up too...and Mr Tan was not coming, and we were going to play Persis. But because I had make-up, I had to leave and come back after 2 hours plus. But when I came back, they already packed up...argh...I wanted to play!!! Argh..nevermind, guess there's always a second chance. Then after that went to church with Nat. My DG was preparing refreshments for the day. So we went to get bananas and strawberries. We were making strawberries and bananas in chocolate. Whoa!!! It was *yum yum*...though I only got a plate for myself. Don't know where I read it from, they say it's what they make as Valentines' Day gift. hehe...but who cares, as long as it's good food...haha! Then went to Mac's for dinner. Was talking with my Jie about Chemistry on the way there...haha...so funny. But my favourite subject la. And I asked Baoshun, Junwen and my Jie to teach me piano...hehe...so exciting. Which I learnt a bit today. Yippee!!! On the way...haha! Anyway, last night I had an interesting dream. I dreamt that my whole family, except Rose was going to Australia to study. And I was feeling a bit sad, and excited at the same time. Then, I said my goodbyes and boarded the plane and all the stuff. But the weird thing is that, when I got off the plane, I realised that I was still in Singapore. Really don't understand. Maybe God wants me to stay in Singapore...hehe...don't know la. Then Jianming didn't come today. So we had to join M3a for Sunday School. Well, they were doing Hosea. But in the end they didn't do much because of us. But Uncle Anthony told us about how people actually down grade themselves to worship lowly objects like animals and even S * * *...haiz...What's the world coming to. But I guess as Christians, we ought to do something to bring this people back to God. Somehow, during the first half of Sunday School today, as I was singing "Just let me say"...I suddenly broke into tears. I just remembered how God has done so much for me, what he did to take all my sins upon Himself. How I should truly love Him. Lord, I love you. Thank God.

						   Am I satisfied? I should...  Why am I asking myself this question? Recently, I had just gotten back many of my papers. Some people would have said that I had done well, but I just seem to want more. Many of my friends did really alot worst then me. Maybe I should really learn to be grateful. After all, there's so much God has done for me already, God's goodness is so great, that I should be wondering how I should ever be able to things in return. Although, I'll never be able to, but guess I should really give my life to Him. Ok, didn't post here last night, cause I was just totally tired after coming back from Kent Ridge Guild House. Was watching American Idol. It was very long, cause they each sang two songs. And I think it was a really good performance by all of them last night. I think Clay will win. He has many supporters and I don't really remember him in the bottom three ( I just didn't watch from the start maybe ). Either way, he really has a good voice, just that sometimes he has weird facial expressions. Then yesterday, we had Chemistry practical. It was a blunder by me yesterday. I was testing for the presence of sulphur dioxide I think. Then we were suppose to heat it until the Potassium(VI) Dichromate turns from orange to green. But I moved it out of the fire, and the chemical got sucked back into the other test tube. Contaminating everything. So I had to redo everything. Then the second time I did it, I added so much of Potassium(VI) Dichromate that it took so long to change colour. Then Mr Wong told me hang on there. Then heat and heat, finally turn green! But soon after that, one of my test tubes broke due to overheating. Argh...then the precipitate formed outside the test tube. Then the chemical suddenly shot out into the front bench...just nice missed everyone...hehe. But quite fun la. What a day. Today, it was really ok. Nothing much, except that my styrofoam plate broke when I carried my food back to the table...argh...then my mash potato and fries all fell out. Then, hungry la. So quickly when to get a plate of Mee Goreng just before the bell rang. Then was just so tired today la. During band practice I also felt like sleeping. Just remembered Mr Tan praised me again for my chinese composition. hehe. He said that one part of my essay about an adaptation of a story about patience was very touching and meaningful. I thought so too. I really like it. I'll post here. It's found in "I kissed dating goodbye" by Joshua Harris. Apparently, he adapted from another book himself. But guess I'll post it here tomorrow. They say I'm Storm. hmm...I'm strong and protective of those I love? Well, I really want to protect my loved once, but I often feel inadequate in doing that. And I don't think I'm strong. But maybe that's when the last part comes in. I do have alot of fears and concerns. As ZQ always tell me that I don't dare to try things. And sometimes, I just can't convince myself that I mean anything or can do anything for my loved ones at all. hmm...maybe I really have to work on that. Not bad, quite accurately. hehe...but no one's perfect la...just like everyone in X-men. Each of them has their own weakness. But I guess that's when God comes in. Hope I'll always remember that it is most important that my life is for God, but not how satisfied I am with myself.

						     You are Storm!  You are very strong and very protective of those you love.  You are in tune with nature and are very concerned with justice and humanity. Unfortunately, certain apprehensions and fears are very hard for you to overcome, and can often inhibit you when most need to be strong.    urlLink   Which X-Men character are you most like?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

						   Tests and CAs...now over!!!  Yupz! All my papers are over. Actually, kind of la. I still have an English Paper, but you can't study for it, so no more preparation for tests!!! Oh, didn't post here last night, cause I was just busy doing my last minute revision for Geography CA today. hehe. But nothing much yesterday also. Just that I ended up trying to install the Lord of the Rings computer game my Dad bought. Then just kept watching TV. So, didn't study much also. But at least I did my QT! It's nice and refreshing. Pray that the train will start rolling after this. I just hope I didn't do it, only because I wanted peace for my test. But I got peace anyway. Then today was it. The time had come. After all the revision on the bus and during other lessons, I think the paper was quite ok. Except, I didn't quite know how a tropical storm is formed. But I hope I'll still do well la. And I failed my A Math Class test!!!! 14/30!!! But guess it was ok, cause many people did badly. After all, it's only tenm percent of the total score. Well, today just during the last period, I was having serious gastric pains. Argh...so painful. Then I rushed down to the canteen for a sandwich and some Indian Rojak. Only then, I felt better. Just as I was enjoying my food, I suddenly realised that I was late for my Chinese oral!!! Ah!!! Like Clark Kent(exaggerated...duh), I zoomed to the study area outside the staff room. Phew...I was just in time. Then of course, I was nervous la, and couldn't speak properly. But it always happen la, so stay happy!!! =) hehe. Then went for practice la...practiced Merry Widow. Actually, it's a very easy but nice pieced. Didn't want to practice Salute to Abba la...don't like it. So after that, went home with Yizhong. Talk about X-men la...so crap...but it's quite cool la (not the conversation, the X-men.) Then I was home, just sat around imagining some silly stuff. Leting my imagination run wild(not in a bad way) ,  and then decided to catch another episode of Smallville on my computer. haiz...so sad for Clark, just can't be with Lana. But somethings have to wait la...but the whole story very sad la. Ok...gotta go.I've been doing some thinking recently, but it all comes back to the quote: The right thing at the wrong time is the wrong thing.

						   Crazy time at Orchard Guild House  I didn't enter last night, cause I only reached home at like 11.30 pm. Cause we were at Orchard Guild House!!! But I think I'll start from the beginning of the day first. It's Sunday, so as usual, I would go to church with my siblings. And the message was on 1 Thessalonians. I like speaker (but i don't remember his name) , he spoke in our church before. Since then I already like his messages,a really interesting and funny speaker, and there's still things to learn too. Then he was talking about marriage and sex. Which is what I'm reading in my book now. But really impressed, cause it's a difficult topic to handle and I thot no speaker will address it as clearly as he did. But he didn't spend much time on though, but still impressed. Then after Sunday School, had sub-comm prayer. Our sharing always so crappy one. As in just a group of funny people la...But I missed Music Ministry meeting la. But at least, I got to learn a bit more about piano from Junwen. I have like so many teachers. But it's exciting la...to be able to play.  After that, we ate lunch at Cineleisure with a whole group of YFers. Then we played pool at the rainbow room in Orchard Guild House, while some studied. Of course many were tempted...haha. But we had fun la...even just crapping around and talking. I even managed to get to know more about baptism from Randy. I'm really thinking about it la. But I'm still praying. Maybe I'll go for it end of this year. Then we somehow ended up watching X-men together. Then some of the sisters (even my own sister) got so interested. But Min Er was the hyper one. She even chose the X-men she wanted to be. hehe...then she ended up with Lady Deathstrike. But X-men really cool la. It's until 9.30pm, then we went for dinner at KFC. That's how I reached home so late. At least I didn't get scolded by my parents. Then today, I went to school without finishing my homework. Then stayed back after school with Nat for a while. I'm glad we're getting closer now la. And my father fetched me home. And to my surprised, he asked me what computer game I wanted. Ended up with Lord of the Rings la. But don't think I should play it now. So now I'm home early. Glad that I'm able to catch up with Yen a bit through MSN. Ok...very tired from all the typing. Hope I'll be back tomorrow again.

						   I lost my thinking cap in the rush.  Recently, I've been kinda busy. Band, school work and service alike. And now, I seldom have time to stop, think and reflect. Even on the bus, I'll just sleep. So it's all just rush hour. Ok, tomorrow will be the SMT program. So exciting!!! Ok, better go and prepare some stuff first. See you YFers tomorrow!!!

						   Lots of sleep in the day  Well, today was nothing much. After I last entered here, I just slept and slept till 4.30pm, when I quickly woke up to prepare sonds for Sunday. Still haven't prepare songs and stuff for tomorrow. Guess maybe I'll do it tomorrow. So excited about this Saturday. Just messaged Min and Jie a bit. Then went to Kent Ridge Guild House with my family. Just went there and bathe then eat dinner only la. Ok...what a boring day. At least I got lots of rest.Ok...hope I'll be back here tomorrow again.

						   New phone!!!  Kinda realised that I'm blogging alternate days. Ya...But it's ok la, doesn't matter. Anyway, yesterday was great! I just went to school la. Nothing much there. But after school, I was suppose to conduct sec 1 sectionals. But I told YZ that I had to leave at 3.45pm. Then just when I was about to start, I received a call. ZQ said his coming to fetch me soon. Then I continued. Just 5 minutes later, he called back, and said he'll be here in 10 minutes. Then I had to go la. So in the end, I didn't conduct. hehe...Then went to buy phone, yeah!!! Then my sister took so long to decided. Cause she didn't know which Samsung phone she wanted. Somemore they were all so expensive. Then I went to get my GD-68 at the Singtel shop la. Took sometime, at first didn't like it. But now, I think it's very nice. Can record voice as ringtone somemore. Then I went with ZQ to Heartland mall. We were supposed to meet some of the Student Coordinators for dinner, but in the end many didn't turn up, while the rest were late. Then was like touring about the SC with ZQ. Then we went to church for the facilitator training for this saturday. hehe...so exciting. Hope jie's coming. Then we went thru the game ourselves. As for now, I can't say much, cos some YFers come here too. So I'll just leave it to this saturday. Then I woke up today, and started setting my phone up. It's so cool, somemore got color, altho it's only 256, but it's nice la. Oh well, gotta run along. It's Vesak Day today. Nothing much to do. Actually all church stuff, but it's more relaxing la.

						   Tired...zZzZzZzZzZ...  Whoa...if you're wondring why I didn't enter here yesterday, was cause I had Student Life meeting until about 10.30 pm. Then I reached home about 11pm and slept about twelve. But it was ok la...cause even if there wasn't a meeting I'll stay up to watch Smallville, although weird they suddenly decided not to show it last night. Missed an episode already, it'll give me more time to catch up this way. Anyway, yesterday was a slacker's day. I got back my Physics paper though, it's 16/30...argh...could have got 20/30 thanks to one stupid careless mistake. Argh...nevermind, must remember to be more careful next time. Then after that slacked in band room. The sec 1s played horrible man! But at least I wasn't very disturbed by it, and could read for a while and even close my eyes to rest. I think it's kinda cool, cause after that I went to the food centre opposite with my friends. It feels so carefree. Then was talking to Miss Koh about the shortage of Clarinets. But she said that we would have to share, cause the school really can't buy more. So we were trying to think of a way to solve the problem. But left quite late la, cause had to settle the problem of the condemned instruments with the sec 1s. Then today, was just another boring day, felt so tired in class, so I decided to write a letter to Yap Min during Physics lesson...hehe...then was like reading my book la. Then after school, I went down to the band room again. I was like just standing there, looking at the people choosing the instruments for auction. Then just left la. haiz...so bored. I kinda miss my jie. Was hoping to go Subway study with her, but realised that she had Theory lessons today. Oh well, so came home quickly, and here I am entering in my blog. This few days I've been just thinking of writing an article for YF life. Especially after such an eventful period. I really learnt alot, and wished to share to my fellow brothers and sisters in Christ. Oh well, I better get going there's work and preparation of songs to be done.

						   A reflective Sunday, I saw my foolishness...  Today, was a day of reflection. Sad, but refreshing. It always brings me back to God. I come to realise how all this while, I sought after what I thought was love, not realising, that true love had all the while been around me. It is Mothers' Day. And I felt family love, and love from God. It was a great time at night when we went for dinner at Bukit Timah Guild House. And then, we had a surprise for our Mom when she came home at night. What warmth of a family. Yesterday, we had Bible Study and Recreation during YF again. It was fun I guess. Bible study is kind of different this year too. And we sang "How could I live without you" during worship, and I come to realise, that it is God that I can't do without. Then we had Recreation. They kind of incoporated traning for the expedition into Captain's Ball. Not only was the game longer. For every ball scored, the team that is scored against would have to do 12 push ups. Whoa...it was so tiring. And today, it's aching all over. Then it was fun la...I managed to score. It's late, haven't done my homework. But somehow, I'll get through all these.

						   Miss my old friends!  Well, today was kinda crazy. I felt restless and didn't feel like doing anything. Probably cause of my poor play in basketball during PE. But it everything was ok. Except that Mrs Bala accused me of copying...T.T argh...nevermind. Bascially, sectionals was super duper crappy. We weren't even practicing. We were just playing for fun. Haiz...can't we just get serious. I got a chance to walk around city area alone today for nothing. I felt free suddenly. Like I was able to forget all my worries. Then I was waiting for the bus at Marina. I just thought, how great would it be to just go walk about alone in a park and just think abou stuff. Then I was thinking of getting some friends along to go to Sentosa and enjoy ourselves during the holidays. Then after that can stay over at someone's house also. cool...probably my old friends from primary school. Really miss them. Either way, I'm hoping to get away from stuff. I really look forward to that... I also don't really no what to say. But I have to admit I have alot of plans now. I really hope to enjoy and to forget all the worries I have now. I might be back later. But likely, I won't be here tomorrow. Cause I'll be having Student Life meeting again. So tiring. There's band prac somemore. So pray for energy tomorrow!

						   Aimless and lack of motivation...what do I really want now?  Suddenly, I just don't feel like doing anything. Not even blogging. But either way, i thought it would be a good way of reflecting for me. For now, I just feel like sitting on the couch doing nothing. It's like life's boring. I think that's the reason. Recently, I'm beginning to get into my own dream world once again. In this world, anything is possible, as long as you believe. Sounds like Matrix huh??? Well, it's just fantasy. Well, don't get me wrong, it's not infatuation. It's just that, for example, I can imagine being an X-men. Cool huh...imagine you could fly...whoa...yeah...it's just in the mind. But as long as it works in driving away boredom. So what's the problem with me??? What do I want? Maybe I just miss people. Maybe I just want to get into some exciting event to serve God.( I certainly hope I'm not serving myself that way.) But now, I seem all trapped and tied down by my books. Homework's piling up. But that doesn't bother me. (hehe...I'm gifted...in last minute work.) I think what I need now is sometime with God to reflect. A wondeful scenario is seeing myself in an air-conditioned room, with the sun's rays shining into the room. Giving warmth..feels like God's radiance. Just cosy. Then, with my journal in front of me, along with God's work, and preferably a book(Christian Literature). That'll be great. Some cake...Apple Strudel??? With Ice Lemon Tea would be so wonderful. And the whole place added with a touch of worship tunes. Wow!!! That would be awesome!!! But the only time I could do that is during the holidays. And without my parents home.(they'll probably scold me for switching on the air-conditioner. But something like that later would be satisfying enough, anyway, what could be compared to the very presence of our Father in heaven. =) I got my chance of gazing out of the window, and have the wind hitting onto my face. It's always so refreshing, and perfect for some reflection. But today, I longed for something. I'm not sure what...but I must remember that God is still my greatest desire. Well, today I had a great deal of time to do "nothing" since the teacher wasn't here, giving the class 4 free periods. But thank God, I needed that to finish my homework. Gave Darrel my blog address. So greetings to you!!! If he ever decides to drop by. Ok...time to go off to finish my work..so I can look forward to a great night tonight. No apple strudel though...hehe...

						   Am I really that emotional???  Everyday in class, there'll be sometime in class when I look out of the window and just ponder about stuff. What stuff? I also don't know. But Darrel who sits beside me would always just say that I'm a sentimental person, just because I look out of the window and write letters in class. He's like always trying to find out what I'm thinking about. But I haven't told him anything though. Thanks anyway for your concern Darrel. (although he doesn't visit my blog.) So I'm some emotional person. Well, they say I am. But if I am that super-sensitive a person, wouldn't life be devastating? Maybe I am, but I think there's always another personality to cover things up. But I enjoy life. Maybe not so much this year. Always bring me back to realise myself in my adolescent years, where changes takes place. I don't know how I'll change, but my life is God's I will remember. Well,  today was kinda ok. It's just the same everyday. But today I didn't finish my work so I had to worry, which turned out to be waste of my energy, cause non of the teachers went through the homewrok. Then, I got back my English Comprehension. Argh...I got 12/25. I hate the new 'O' level format. It's like only 10 people in my class passed. This is crazy. Guess I just have to learn to get used to the new marking scheme. I can't wait for History lessons to start again. But I guess it'll be a long time before we start, since they'll be little lessons next week due to the moving of school. But that's exciting too. Either way, History is still my favourite subject. Well, Geography is ok...just that there's occasional "boring spells". Today's temperature is 36.86 degree celsius. I wanna go home!!! I need to be 37.60 and above to go home. But I guess I should be thankful for my good health. OK...I'll be back tomorrow!!!

						     Emotional Wreck. You are extremely emotional. You feel contentment moreso than happiness and your emotional lows are to the extreme. You need to cheer up and start enjoying your life. Where there is rain there is a rainbow and you need to see it more than others. Do something that makes you happy.    urlLink   How Emotional Are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

						   Burdensome Sunday  For some reason, I always feel very burdened and stress on Sunday. It's like it always bring back some unhappy memories, it's like the opposite. Shouldn't I be feeling peace. Maybe the fact that the next day is school and I haven't finished my homework bothers a bit too. But I only hope that I would have peace from the Lord, and I know that he's ready to give it to me. I just have to accept it.  Anyway, Friday was just a crazily busy day. With no free time at all, driving you till you have no energy. But the thought that it's Saturday the next day, and I'll be at YF is always refreshing. Saturday, I had band practice. And as usual, the fourth week in a row, I had make up lessons. So once again, (to my pleasure) I missed band practice again...hehe. Well, after that I went to Burger King to meet Corlissa and Yap Min, well, they were late, including Annabelle, whom I wasn't expecting. Then we went to Cold Storage to get the stuff for the progamme and for the refreshments, which turned out to be tons of chips. Well, at least we had mayo crabsticks on biscuits. I like the games during the workshop, although I already did them during the training, it was definitely different with so much more people. And there were new things to learn too. Although the Student Peer Group didn't talk much. As usual, the day ends with Captain's Ball followed by dinner at Heartland Mall. Today, I was to lead songs again(note:  just lead the day before at YF). But it's really nice to be a service to God. And I have to remember that I'm His unworthy servant too. I sang "You are so faithful" just now. It really brings back fond memories as well as sad ones. But I think I have to remind myself that I have chosen to let things go. I don't know what I'm suppose to mean by writing this here, but I hope the person who knows what I mean will not take it to heart. Sorry to that person. I guess even still, the song still has it's meaning. Thank God for being faithful. Anyway, I came homw to watch "Fellowship of the Ring" a second time today. It's really a touching great show. OK...gotta go and finish my work. Especially Chemistry, while Mr Wong still has good impression of me. Gotta be a Student for Christ!!!

						   A Moment Like This...  I was just listening to some musicby Kelly Clarkson today, being so bored at home, I could only do this. Then I was listening to "A Moment Like This". In the song there was this part:  A moment like this  Some people wait a lifetime For a moment like this Some people search forever For that one special kiss Oh I can't believe it's happening to me Some people wait a lifetime for a moment like this.  How true...indeed there are many times and moments we should really cherish. Moments that are once in a lifetime, even moments when we go through hardship, the "downs" in our lives. Now, I stand in this point in my life. There are times I miss. My primary school days, my time seating alone by the window, the happy times I spend with my friends. But I can't go back now. These will only remain as memories. I see now that I must cherish them. I see them in photographs, as records in my journal. What wonder in journalling. The beautiful moments and climax(s) in my life. All in black and white, refreshing my memory. What gift...a journal... I'll be moving school soon. The moments I spent there. I cherish them. I know I'll miss them. And I wrote it down as poem, hoping to recall bits and pieces of memory in the future. When I move to the new school, I guess I'll have to find my own special corner somewhere. Maybe at East Coast. Indeed, it's exciting, but the place that has been a second home for the past two years will be gone soon, no doubt that'll be times when I miss the school now. I'm alone at home now. I'm bored. But I had reflection. And I love it. I miss my friends. But I know that every moment should be cherished, for each is special in its own way.

						   I feel changed...  For some reason, I feel thar things have been renewed for me. I suddenlt want to change. And things around me are changing too. One not so significant change(well, may be it's quite), I'll be moving school in one weeks time. And this year, I found my own close friends. I'm starting to even to like pop music.(Kelly Clarkson is good. I just like her voice.) And even developed new habits(like blogging). hehe...I changed my handphone???diao...hehe...it's exciting to change...yeah! But scary too. Saturday, we celebrated Miss Koh's Birthday. It was one of a kind!!! We had a small ensemble to play a Happy Birthday Song composed by Danny and Alvin...and also a fanfare when she cut the cake! So cool!!! It's like a privilege of being the teacher-in-charge for band. Then, after that they were packing up the band room for the move. It was total mess. But it was fun. Then I had to leave early for YF. So turned up there abt 2.40pm. Whoa...quite late. Then we had Bible Study. So cool. We were doing something like sharing the gospel thru the Matrix Movie. Then we read up on alot of parallelisms between the gospel and the movie. Then we learnt about other non-Christian elements inside the movie. It was kinda cool. After that, we had a short time of prayer, and went for training. We did sets. It was so tiring. We did 2 sets of 25 push-ups, 30 sit-ups, 8 burpee push-ups and 30 jumping jacks. It was so tiring, and I'm all aching now. Then we came back, and somehow, still had the energy to play Captain's Ball. I scored one shot...but taking into account that I missed so many, I'm a liability. OK...but I had fun. It's Min Er's Birthday today. I want to buy her stuff. She means alot to me. So happy birthday Min Er! And thanks for everything!!! Today's message was on pride. It hits me...just the theme. Cause I was really really sleepy during the message. But at least I reflected a bit. OK...too mush stuff to cover. I'll leave it like that. I'll make things more exciting. Somehow...change!!!

						   Hmm...  What Dustin said is true to.(look at yesterday's comments) Maybe it still hurts. But how and why we feel hurt is the question. Do we feel hurt, because of failure of the possesion of the person we "love"" Or is it because it's a response to rejection or even failure to be able to protect the person. Whatever it is, since love is not all about feelings, it links back to actions. I think we still feel hurt and sad that we can't be with the person we love, but in the end, if our sections ultimately place the happiness of the person above other concerns. That would be loving. For it is sacrificial, having to got thru the pain and putting aside our own concerns. It becomes not whether it's a painful action, but whether the painful action is done willingly with love for the other person's good.

						   Last day of school, My first band practice.  Today's my first band practice since we moved to the new school. Well, it was really horrible, as I was just so sleepy. That I can't even lift my head up all the time. Other than that, we played horribly. Now I understand what love is...thanks to Adrian. This was what he said,"God wants us to be happiest, and tt can only be when we abide in Him. Thus when we sin, and choose our way, He's sad cos He knows tt we suffer when we sin. This is love. We feel pain cos we dun get what we want. and wat we want often isn't the best for the other person. That's selfishness." How true! Now I understand. Thanks again Adrian! Hope you don't mind me reproducing your words. I'm just tired and stuff. Nothing much these days. Except that my QT is not exactly good. But I'll get back to it. It's the beginning of the holidays, and I already got the tons of homework. So it isn't gonna be an enjoyable time during the holiday. I wanna go out with friends. But I still don't know whether it's possible. Just hope that they'll be ok with it. Really miss them.

						   What is love? So many views. But there must be an absolute!!!  I managed to reach school on time today! Actually, at 7am. So good la. Then school was nothing much. All usual. I'm getting all confused now. What is love? There must be an absolute. But all views seem so acceptable. Then what is true love? Thanks Adrian. I agree. It's our own selfishness that makes love painful. If we love, we would do things and make sacrifices for the person with joy. But as Dustin said, God does feel painful when we sin against him doesn't it? He loves us. And because of that He did so much for us. But does He feel pain? But I would not question God's love, cause His is the greatest love. Love that can't be more true. So what is love? My first understanding of love was Mommy...but as time passes, it gets all complicated and difficult to understand...Lord, help me understand... Anyway, I agree with Adrian in some way. I realise my own selfishness now. Thanks Adrian! Thanks Min too! or always dropping by. I should expect more people around now. Now that Dustin added a link to his blog. But all are welcomed!

						   I was late for "school"  Today was a crazy day. First I woke up at 5.30am, and left the house at 6am. I took 2hours to go to school. Thanks to some idiots whom I followed. They purposely made themselves late i think. So I reached school at 8.01am. I was 1/2 hour late lor...sighz...thank goodness like nobody ws interested in catching me. So no detention..yeah!!! Then basically school was all slack. Didn't even have a single period of proper lessons. Then school ended at 12.05pm. Then joined some YFers at East Coast Macs for lunch. Cool huh? It's my school neighbourhood now! Okok..gotta go. I think I should pass my time to my sister instead. Ok, will be back tomorrow.

						   I'm Storm!  Okok...two X-men quizzes, both ended me up as Storm. Hmm...quite accurate. Maybe I might really have some mutant power. hehe. Well, they say she has a shady past...how bout myself. Maybe the shady part is now, which will eventually be my shady past in the future.Sigh... Thanks Dustin, you're right, love is painful. Now come to think of it, why aren't I Iceman(Bobby). He's got a whole lot of trouble with love. Oh well, maybe it's just a totally different experience. Anyway, maybe true love is...1Corinthians 13. I really don't know. What is true love? How is it different from "love"? I still don't understand. What I do know, is that what God did for us is a model of perfect love. I thought it was a simple word...but now, it seems so hard to understand. But love is not all feelings. I can be certain about that. Today, I went to school(it's at 2 Siglap Link now), well, it's a really nice building. From the inside, it feels like some complicated city. Like those you see in Star Wars you know? Lots of bridges. But nice place. But quite easy to get dizzy trying to find your way. Guess I'll take some time to get used to it. I just slept the day away. Now I have to finish my Geography Workbook. And somtime before I slept, I was thinking bout some stuff. My past...well, not that long ago...just earlier this year. So many regretful things happened. I've only begun to see the worst of human life in the world...am I ready? I hope I am...things will never be the same again. My shady days begin...

						   The trouble is not with love, but humans...  I thought love was painful. Love was troublesome. How true... but all these only because I did not understand true love. True love is like God's love. Agape, sacrificial love. People changed love into a kind of self-centered-ness. They call it "falling in love", which is just a desire to be loved. But agape is different. True love is self-less. Which happens to be the opposite. So if you think "love" is painful, maybe true love is wonderful. God is love, we need God. Today,I just went to school to practice the school and national anthem in the new school. I remember the last time I went there was like still only two storeys. Now it's already almost completed. And seven storeys high!!! Haven't got the school feel yet. Then went home very early(kinda found a way to go home) And slacked around. Somehow ended up sleeping till 3pm. Then woke up, and tidied up my room a bit. Nothing much, except my conversation with my jie about love. Just talked about alot of stuff. I felt confused la. All the feelings and stuff. But I can only hang on. I can't run away cos it's in me. I just have to let God take charge I guess. Tomorrow's first day of school at the new school. So exciting. But it's only cleaning up. Maybe I'll go East Coast some time. Ok...quite a boring day. Thanks jie for being my best friend too! hehe...

						   The Trouble with Love is...  Don't be mistaken...I'm not in love again. Just that I'm in a state of confusion now...I don't know what. Maybe I just miss people. It's like in my own world. I feel dizzy and stuff. Recently, I've been so reflective. Reflections that involved all the most important aspects of my life. Too reflective actually...so it's like a emotional overflow. I don't know what I'm feeling suddenly. It's like I'm no longer sane, but led only by my emotions. I don'tknow what to say. Just a short one here...I can't carry on...

						   I take time to earn other's trust  Yesterday, I sent my sister off.(Rose) Well, she's going to Australia, Brisbane. Now, my home is down to 5 people. So, it's getting mor empty. But it doesn't matter since I'm at school or out most of the time. And Michelle came to sent Rose off, along with some messages to past and letters to return. It was like as if she's not coming back. Then Michelle was telling me how her friend writes a departure letter everyday just in case she dies. And then again, that Melissa wrote a letter too before she went overseas. It seemed silly at first. But then, I thought it was kinda cool. So I thought I'd probably write one soon. (Just hope it won't be too late) And Yizhong was telling me how living with the "I'd die tomorrow" mentally can be good. Cause this way you would live each day to the fullest. I thought it was quite true. They say I'm a wolf. Well, I always thought wolves are the bad guys and now they say I'm one. But they're cool la. Especially when they showed a snow wolf for the picture. Cool!!! Anyway, it is really true about how I only confide in a few people. And I have quite a problem confiding too. But this works two way. People find it hard to trust me. I guess that's what I'm sad about.Especially when the people I love and trust most have so much inconfidence and distrust in me. Really sad...sigh...guess it's me. Maybe I tend to make people lose their trust too...sigh... About the world being my playground, I don't think so. I'm not such a "go my way" dominating person. In fact, I often live for others. My life often revolve others, probably cause I don't receive much attention...even at home. You know, my siblings are all good at talking, except me. Now I recall...when I was in kindergarten, I stammered. Then when I went to primary school, I loved to talked, but Dad always scolded me the moment I opened my mouth. So I just kept quiet. Every report card had the comments describe me as a quiet and soft spoken boy. I only started opening my mouth in secondary school...sigh...so now I'm not a good speaker...*cries*...I was like so suppressed. If anybody would notice,I'm actually quite talkative now. I love to talk just that I wasn't allowed too, and now I'm not good at it. Maybe I'm trying to make up now...hehe... Ok...guess I should go. Tomorrow's YF...yippee...but jie not going. Who to talk to? Maybe I'll get to talk to others tomorrow. Anyway, Paul's brother is Tom. We didn't talk much. (we're both quiet) But I think we're not that alike. Maybe a bit of mannerisms, but interest wise, should be still quite different.

						   Happy and Crappy!!!  Haha...come to realise, jie really very funny. Everything she say also funny. And looks like I have no choice to be crappy. She said I was...so ok. Haha...then she'll come up with all the funny lines like "absorb the sunshine!!!" Diao...everybody else says it doesn't make sense. Oh well...as long as it means something to us. Yeah man! Absorb more sunshine!!! (reminds me of plants:photosynthesis) I've decided that...Bruce Almighty is...a CRAPPY, LAME, but still MEANINGFUL show. I'm serious!!! If you think Jim Carey shows give nothing for the Brainy or Emotional one, then you're wrong! Cause, the story tells of God's wisdom...and on the other hand, a "god with all brawn but no brains"(that's Bruce starring Jim Carey). And then again, it speaks of a Christian that complained that God was not doing His job, to a Child of God that gave up his life to Him, and submitted to His will. And not to forget the great meaning of love, when Bruce prayed that his girlfriend(the one in FRIENDS, forgot the name) would be happy, no matter what that means. T.T...ar...so touching...*tears*...what sacrificial love. OK...behold...the meaning of love(my definition), love is the complete willingness to do what's best for the other, disregarding self and personal desires. Well, give me your views. Anyway, I still think love can't be reduced to a few words.For more information, please check out 1 Corinthians 13 in the Eternal Life Manual. Today. I went to school. I had like Chemistry. All about Redox Reactions. Then, went to meet Yen, Min and Jie. It was an ok time...just sat there and did some of my work. Then, went home and ate and ate and ate!!! haha...good thing I'm not a girl. If no figure would be quite a problem...haha! Then just watched TV and play computer again. Some life. Oh well...at least jie cheered me up. I just hope things will be more exciting. I still miss my friends...if I still have any, cause I feel like I don't have any. But as jie said, I'll get over it soon. So here Iam, being happy and crappy again...haha!!!

						   I'm back...  Just gotten a bit lazy the past few days. Well, school holidays started. And all I did was just play computer games. Boring though. Very bored at home...nobody wants to go out with me T.T...Arrrrr...nevermind. I miss my friends. But I'm more of like feeling  lonely and friendless now. Well, at least got to talked to Adrian a bit more recently. I've sorted out my thoughts. I just hope for the best in keeping things positive. Well, the sky is clear now(Adrian say it should be "skies"...but I think "sky" looks nicer.) So once again, I can absorb the sunshine!!! haha!!! I don't know what to say now. I just feel plain lonely. And I miss lots of people. And it's like besides my family, I only keep in contact with my jie(still somewhat my family...haha!) But look on the bright side!!! I'll be going to catch a movie with my siblings and Paul will be bringing his brother along. (my sister says that we're alike, but I doubt so, cause I'm so...weird...or if it's better, extraordinary!!!haha!!!) But somewhat looking forward to it... Yesterday, my Mom got baptised. Got some photos of that moment. And I'm really happy that she got baptised. As for me, I'm still thinking. I think I will soon. Maybe this November. I've been thinking, and that should be no reason for me to wait if my faith is there. So...yupz!!! Then, today I went to the airport to send my father off. He'll be in Australia for two weeks. Exploring around. Then basically, we were there too early. So we just ate and talked and ate...so fun! Like family outing, I really enjoyed the time with my family. OK...really nothing much.Guess life continues on. I just wanna have better time with God.

						   Big Decision and the Undecisive  Today, I went to meet up with the Music Ministry to have our workshop cum gathering. It was really a fun and crazy time. Really enjoyed myself. But still, I still can't get my thoughts off the big decision. My father called back yesterday, and he asked if I wanted to study in Australia. I was quite speechless, especially in the middle of my Smallville episode. But I decided to think about later and continue with the show. But somehow, I just can't watch in peace. So after the show, I quickly started considering. Currently, all seems good for me to go, nothing to pull me bad, plus, it's a great opportunity for experience and to quicken my studies. But think is that it just doesn't seem right for me to just decide like that. So I thought through again, and it involves alot on prayer and talking to others. I need to find out more about the environment there, and how things will affect my spiritual growth. Ultimately, I have to depend on God's will. It seems so appealing to go, but I think I need more time still. Sigh...but whatever happens, I still trust in God, and believe that whatever happens, whether pleasing or regretful, He has purpose for everything. Ok...gotta go...there's full day band prac tomorrow. Just hope I'll enjoy myself, and that I don't need to go thru the torture of trying to stay awake.

						   Operation Decision Once Again  Yup...my father came back from Melbourne on Monday. So now there's news of this course that I can take, and at the same time, possible for me to differ NS. Unfortunately, it's the only course. It's Bachelor of Arts (Professional Communication)...two years. Basically, it's Mass Communications in S'pore. Well, I wanted to take Mass Comm. But it's too hard to get in in S'pore. But here's a great opportunity, except that I would have to study overseas at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology. Cool huh...but it's really a tought decision for me again. So my friends out there, do pray for me. Thank U!!! Most importantly, pray for God's direction. Today's band practice was fun. It was like we were just playing the music for fun. It's rare that I actually enjoy band practices. So it was happy day! hehe!

						     urlLink    Which [Smallville] Characters are you?   I knew it! I have always been able to identify with her. Perhaps that's why I'm often bias against Lana (sorry to lotsa people...hehe). I can often imagine myself in a scenario like hers, then there'll always be funny things to do. Like reading a confession letter, when the other person is unconcious. (thought of that, but haven't got the chance...oops...), then things like sitting in front of the computer attempting to delete pictures. Well, at least I managed to delete everything instead of keeping then in my recycle bin. I seldom show my real feelings...hmm...well, maybe. Guess that's what everybody else thinks right? Me, always seemingly happy and chirpy. I should have more confidence. The only problem is that I don't have anything to be confident in. And not to forget the fact that I ain't intelligent or beautiful...haha!

						   I'm Back!!!!  Yeah man! I'm back...Dustin's back from Australia...my life back to normal. Back to the good old days. Well, will be less frequent here cause I'll be exceeding my download value soon. But do come back guys, and leave notes too! (if there's anything to say of course). Alright, I won't be going to Australia anymore, at least I have a year to decide. And either way, I might not be able to differ NS back in S'pore. So the good news is that the great guy is staying!!! oops...just kidding! Well, at least I no longer need to make that tough tough decision. I'm happy now, everything's back to normal, my relationship with people and stuff, even bac to the norm of rushing homework...haha! But that isn't exactly enjoyable. I slept through the day. So guess, I'd better do abit of homework tonight. And Dustin's back!!! Yeah man...kinda forgot to say...HAPPY BELATED B'DAE DUSTIN! Sorry, it's so late. Well, see you(Dustin) soon. I'd like to thank all who have been there for me. Thank you!!! Anyway, sorry Yen, can't find my poem, maybe I'll write another sometime. Ok...time for dinner. Thanks everyone for visiting!!!

						   Happy Breakie  Yippee!!! It's finally the weekends, and plus! there won't be school next Monday. But the sad thing is that there is still homework. Oh well, but I'm still thankful for the break. I hadn't had my diarhoea rounds today, so I hope that this time, it's really recovering. And band practice was ok. I'm glad cause we weren't scolded by the conductor, and it was a bit more enjoyable. And yeah!!! I'll be playing Eflat Clarinet all the way for Speech Day! So cool. Just hope the teacher-in-charge doesn't criticise the band again. Tomorrow's the first Outdoor BS I'll be attending. So exciting. Anyway, for me, spiritual life is picking up, emotional life is up, physical life is better(I just recovered from illness), and school life, for the mean time is still easy to cope. Really thank God. I kinda realised how people(or at least me) always only feel as though they are learning from God, or feel that God is graceful and can safe them when in trouble. However, when life is peaceful, I sometimes feel that life is boring, God is not so active anymore, we start to put away God's goodness after a while, and take everything for granted, then, we get into trouble and start the whole cycle again. It shows how each of us choose to acknowledge God and His goodness at different times. But actually, we should always give thanks to God whatever the circumstances. And to remember that He is good, and He is there. I'm working on it. Anyway, my entire life is basically about God's goodness, it's just whether I notice it. God is so good, always good.

						   Sickeningly Sick  Well, the day started when I woke up with diarhoea. Then, I spent so long in the toilet that I missed the bus. So, I had to ask my Dad to fetch me to school. Then, I spent the whole day feeling so sick. I took my temperature lots of times, and it's 37.59 degrees!!! And I couldn't go home unless it's 37.60 and above. But actually, I rarely even reach 37 and above. But who cares now. Argh...hope I'll get better soon...still have slight headache. Oh well, I think I'm gonna tell my parents that I have decided to stay in S'pore for my studies. Cause I decided that it would not be very good for me spiritually to go now, especially, when I'm not even grounded very well in the Word and Faith. So I'll stay. Feel so sick, really nothing today. Except that I realised that Zhongmin's a Christian, he's from the Bethel Assembly of God. Ya...so just talk la. Ok...I think life will get exciting eventually. For now, I just wish to talk to people, I think I feel relaxed talking to people...hehe...

						   Busy Busy  Well, school reopened yesterday, and now, I'm back to the busy lifestyle with lots of homework and band practices. And I just had my Student Life meeting tonight, and I've been assigned to do quite some stuff. So guess I'll busy for the next two months, especially with the handover coming up. And if then, if I do get any heavy post, l'll be more busy. So guess time  management has gotta be there. I've gone thru alot of thinking recently, and in fact I think there are reasons why I could and should go to Australia. However, now, I'm leaning to more towards the side of not going, cause I guess the whole thing will affect me negatively in a spiritual way. So I guess I'll tell my parents soon. Anyway, I think I'll be able to serve better if I stay, and even ground myself spiritually. Gotta run along. Anyway, thanks to those people who talked to me recently, I really appreciate it...and needed it too. See U people! Hopefully I'll be here more frequent.

						   Living in Fear  Everybody have their own fears. Some fears I have would be, heights, having a crush(I'm serious!), my 'variably tempered' conductor, being late...the list goes on. But many of these fears mean nothing. They are but a mental barrier, and have nothing to do with physical factors. In other words, fears are totally unnecessary. Today, I had a rehearsal for my school Speech Day. I was to play the E flat Clarinet which was to me, like playing solo.(Cause I'm the only one playing that instrument, and highly audible. But I was fearful, nervous and all anxious. I tried to be soft to avoid attention. But instead, I attracted more attention on me. But on the second time, I decided to give it all out. Still there are mistakes, but it was really much better. But then, after that I felt so bad about my mistakes that I went to apologise. And he said I was ok!!! How often we worry for nothing. The more we worry, the worst things get. The Band was so pressured my the school's expectation of the Gold. They were afraid, so they had an 'enforced' attitude to the judging. But the more they tried to do well for everything, the worst they got. It's like how we never do well when in fear. So I guess we should just overcome these mental barriers and release out fullest potential of our abilities. Do not consider your fears, but be confident to prove yourself and not undermine youself.Do not let a one time experience result in generalization. But still, fear God! Fear as in reverence.

						   Rejoice in all Circumstances...tough...  Recently, so much has been happening, all the sad things that happened. I finally accepted it and moved on. But then again, something else happen. Sigh...they say that all things happen for a reason. I believe that, but we seldom see what the reason is. Anger has been getting into me. What's with all the jealousy? Somehow, I never get satisfied. In fact, every person out there seldom gets satisfied. It's our human nature. We search and pursue, but in the end, all are worthless. Only a genuine relationship with God will give true satisfaction. Does that mean I never did have a real relationship? It's so scary. I long for the peace. But I know in my heart that something else I can't let go, that is at the same time preventing me from getting this peace. Worldly desires, pride, what is it that I see in all these? People know that holding on to these desires will only cause more pain. Yet they are unwilling to let go for something better. They know, I know. What foolishness. The beauty of God's peace we have experienced it, yet we hold on to what's worst. Does anybody know? Maybe it's just human nature. Like they said, being a Christian doesn't mean a sinless life, our human nature is still there. But we are able to fight against it now. But we give in. Does our faith give us the will to hold on to it? In the end, I guess human will is weak. Guess that's what perserverance is all about. Recently, I talked to Charlene again. She's a friend I neglected. But she's still always there for me, always trusting me, always ready to open up. I'm surprised by her. She has gift, I don't know what to call it, but I know it's there. She makes talking to her comfortable. It's like she totally speaks her mind. It can be good or bad. But I guess, it isn't too good for us to bottle things up in ourselves. I use to that, and I finally had to let it all out by talking to someone. What if things burst out in another way? Sometimes, we should do some housekeeping of our emotional storage space. Not too much or too little. The content matters alot too. Anyway, thanks Charlene! I just bought a harmonica today. I want to learn it. And I just realised that it's so tough. Much tougher than the clarinet I think. But it seems fun. But I've never had good patience in learning. Hope this time, it'll be different. I had Physics and Chemistry Test today, Physics was OK, but Chemistry was a killer. But my mistake, cause I didn't study for Experimental techniques which came out the most. But wait! Rejoice in all circumstances! Yippee!!! (quite fake) Hey Adrian! Nola...the other person doesn't like me...I'm quite sure I think. Anyway, all this relationship kind of thing is too scary with many complications. Guess for now, I'll just stick to friendships. Simple and honest. I'm better with friends. At least I don't have enemies(I hope). Everytime things get a bit more, they just go disastrous. *sings 'Beautiful Disaster'* Though, it's disastrous, sometimes, you still think it's beautiful. Personally, I think all the drama serials are to be blamed for this. Cause everytime something bad happens, it still can seem beautiful when they reconcile and live happily ever after. People get blinded and continue hoping on these "script writer's creativity". Come on! Wake up people! We don't live in fairytale land, things are different in the real world. Anyway, it's nobody's fault that the scandal started, guess at this age, people just think that you're falling in love when you get closer to a girl.Hey! Snap out of it! Being an adolescent doesn't mean that Boy-Girl Relationship is always mushy substance. Anyway, BGR, the term is misused! It changes the concept of a relationship of a guy and a girl, such that they have to say that they are bro and sis. Nothing wrong with it, but using the 'kinship' method is degrading what it means to be a sibling or even a relationship like that of siblings. So becareful people. Ok...sorry...if I'm offending people. A bit "talkative" today. Long one huh? Ok...see you guys!

						   Open My Eyes  It's like all along I've had my eyes closed, and it is only now that I open them. And through the unreliability(sometimes) of Man, I've seen the love of God to a greater extend. I was hurt when Man rejected me, but then I realised how God will feel hurt when we reject Him the same way. But still, His love never fails, but endures forever. I thought I stood alone, but there are people who truely stood by me. Even when I overlooked their concern. But now I see. And thanks to all of them. Today, I was able to feel busy with God's work again. It seems tiring, but it feels good to me, it's a totally different thing when doing school work. I guess it's the knowledge that we're doing something meaningful. After that, hung around Weiyi. It was nice just spending time with him. Then went to play basketball with some YFers. It was a nice feeling exercising again. But just that I feel really unfit now. Guess I'm better at indoor stuff. Hehe... Ok...I'm happy now I guess. I just need to improve on my relationship with God now.

						   Alone  So many times I feel so alone. Like I never really had a true friend. Sometimes I'm even afraid of making friends. Now I know, I wanted to go Australia, cause I wanted to leave this place and shut myself from the world. Sometimes people are scary. Man always disappoint, except that I'm one. But it's scary how they (or we) always fail. It seems perfect for a world with only God and my shadow. But is it right to be in solitude? I guess lives like that. I believe every person lives with a dual personality, and everyone has a totally different life hidden from the world. And I know I'm like that. But sometimes I don't realise that I'm like that. I get so lost in everything false, it's like I don't know who am I...but who cares? My life is me and the other me. That's what it means to me. I want God to come in, if not all these woud seem meaningless. But it's difficult, I'm still lost in my own world. I just get so distracted by myself...sigh...

						   Tired  Somehow, I don't feel like blogging anymore. I've been so tired. With band practices and all the homework to rush. So tired. But at least I haven't been like sad or bothered. Have been thinking alot about my studies, band and church. Guess my gift is to be worker. And I know I'm not a leader for sure. So I'll serve...hehe. Don't know what to say. Too lazy to talk about things actually. Ok...will blog proper again after my competition la. Anyway, thank Emilia! Look forward to talking to you.

						   Thankful  I'm so thankful to God for today. Today, I received my semesteral results. And I scored an L1R5 of 16!!! I've never done this well. I was so surprised to see that I was 4th in class. I would never have dreamt of this. I'm waiting for my Mom to reach home now. I wanna tell her the good news. Then after sectionals, my Section Leader gathered the secondary 3s and shared with us all the stuff he learned in Clarinet playing. It was really a time of learning. And he did quite some handing over. It was exciting and fun. But I guess, all this is for our challenge ahead. Our leadership days. OK...gotta go. Competition is next Friday! Wish me all the best!

						   A memorable day.    Band 110. Victoria School...I don't wanna mention. But people who want to know can ask me. But I'm happy really. It's like...wow! all the hard work paid off. Thanks to all the people who gave me the support during the heavy practice days.   Then I went to Suntec with my SPG to have our gathering. It was really nice la. Talking to Emilia and all...hehe...band enthusiast! Somemore she's a clarinetist too. Everytime I talk to her, I start to feel enthu about band too...cos she always is. hehe...And then we had dinner at Sky Garden, Followed by a sharing from Lincoln. It was very much a good reminder and evaluation of ourselves la. Then we were talking bout being Christian students la. And then, I remembered about Jamie Sullivan from "A Walk to Remember". She is a Christian. And what meant most in her life was her faith. And she was never afraid to show it. Even at the expense of her popularity, or in her case, more of being normal.(what the rest of the teens thought la) And I think she's a really good example, although she's fiction. I really hope to be like her...always showing love to those around her. Well, guess I'll have to depend on God.

						   A walk to remember...    Not that I've just had a walk that could change the rest of my life, but I've read the book. Haven't finished it yet though. Anyway, it's "A walk to remember" by Nicholas Sparks. I was just so...so...affected by it(don't know how to describe the feeling), I just had to come online to talk about it. It's a beautiful story. It's hard to put down. But I wonder if this could be true...it's just to amazing.   It's almost like a perfect love story. A young one that is. Landon Carter is a young boy seventeen. He grew up in a rich family. He could be a horrible spoilt boy in Beaufort town. But when he fell in love with this almost perfect and angelic girl, Jamie Sullivan, the daughter of the Baptist Minister, he's life changed. I haven't read finish the book. In fact, I only read until the part he realised his feelings for her. But still, it invoked many thoughts...   Landon was wondering how he ever fell in love with someone like Jamie. And suddenly, somethings in the past just struck me again. To be honest, I've fallen in love before...if that's what you'll call it.(what a confession...) In fact, I believed that every single one of you is reading this would have fallen in love too. But how? Love isn't blind, we are told. It has to be based on something. But it's so hard to comprehend. Some people say infatuation. Makes me wonder why people fall in love in the first place. They say, or I used to say, that love in your teens can't be taken serious? But that of Landon and Jamie's was everlasting(according to synopsis). I wonder if the story is true. Can this ever happen. Are that not even a little true love in teenage love?   So many people talk about the young love story that happened in their lives. But what is it that they cherished from this that they never forgot? Maybe each of us have our own "a walk to remember". Would the sweet smile of my or your childhood sweetheart still remain vivid ten years down the road?   I do not know why I'm writing this. Maybe all I want to do is write or rather type it out. But what if all these is wrong? What if all these sweet memories were just unconcious desires of us to feel loved? Isn't it scary? What is the love of your life about? What is it that you really share with the one you love? And along with these, what is our love for God about? What is God's love for us about? I sincerely hope that none of you reading this have missed the point of true love. Maybe if you have, this might be the time to sort it out. And to my brothers and sisters in Christ, have we missed the point of God's love for us the same way? If we have, then our love for God would have to thoroughly evaluated.   Bless you my friends, that God might teach you something.

						   A New Chapter    Now my life would be back to normal. Well, of course things would change. I shall put the past behind me, and carry its lessons with me.   I want to study hard this half of the year, I want to be a testimony, a Student Christian, that my identity would be always a Christian. And I've adopted a new activity, reading. Never did much of that, but I'm starting now, and come to realise the treasure in books. Besides that, I'm planning to work on my clarinet more.   There's nothing much to say, cause they're all reflected in my review. So hope that I'll make wise decisions and let the Lord guide me in my life.

						   Mid-year Review    The first half of the year has been very different from years before. Many things change. It's almost like I suddenly grew up. Well, I took up commitments like Student Life Sub-Comm, which I'm pleased to serve in as it has been my area of interest for service. I've been staying in Music Ministry. Somehow, I've learnt alot being there and also at the same time, build relationships with fellow brothers and sisters in Christ. My greatest regret is my failure to fulfill my commitments at the SPG coordinatoor for the Lower Secondary, really hope I can do something about it this next half of the year.   Spiritually, I've gone thru many trials and testings. Though my faith is not exactly strong enough to move mountains, but I am glad that by God's grace, there's still some longing for Him. I've considered baptism. I'm thinking thru it now still. Once I settled all my commitments to God, as in what my relationship with Him means, I'll take the dip and "ceremonially" take up my cross.   I've been in love, everyone has I believed, probably even a 10 year old girl. But it all depends on how you define love. I do not know whether it's what you'll call true love, but I know that it means something to me. At least it thought me something. But memories stay. But I believe they'll be more of help than hindrance.   Academically, I've never been better. With my 16 points for Mid-year results, I guess my hard work has paid off. Nil Sine Labore.   There are many things I learnt in this first half of the year, things I hope will build me with good character and help me to live a life for God.

						   Is this Adolescence?    As I always say, this year has been so different. And I wonder whether it has anything to do with me, being and adolescent. Suddenly, growing up just seems so exciting. Now, there are big decisions to make, and many stuff to take care of. It's no longer just about school work and computer games. It's about commitments, my future, people's future, and responsibility. It's no longer just me. For some reason, I'm starting to realise how one's life can change others. And I've gotta be more sensitive now.   Yesterday was a really special day for me. It reminded me very much that I'm growing up and that I've gotta take my life seriously now. It was my birthday. But I was really quiet. It was the first time I really actually celebrated with my friends. Not really used to being special. But I was thinking. Thinking about people and life.And how much things have changed since I turned 14, and now, before I knew it, I've spent 15 years in this world. But thanks anyway to those who made my day yesterday.   Today I had cross country. Never did enjoy it before. But this year, it was raining. So it was a totally different experience, and didn't regret the run that much. Then went to Macs for lunch and talked to some of my friends about the fate of the section. It's quite exciting. How things are gonna change with our leadership. But I should just stick to my job, and get my stocks all checked.   Really glad to be able to share my life with some people again. I've gone thru alot with people, and sometimes I'm glad I did. It somehow makes me feel that the reltionship is really special. Guess that's what it's all about, going thru together.

						   Cry...    Somehow, I'm always listening to 'Cry' by Mandy Moore when I start updating my blog. But it's fine, it's a nice song. Kinda ironic to say that though, cause it's suppose to be depressing...is it? Anyway, talking about crying, I really felt like doing so after my Chemistry paper. It was so badly done I knew. I had never been so sure of doing badly for Chemistry. So I kinda broke down, but I didn't really cry though, was just so upset, cause all the papers were a catastrophe. But I'm ok. I have to try to relax and take things easy. But I think I had better study hard for my SA2. Can't believe I actually thought of getting 4 A1s for the End-of-Year. But I'll try to do it. After all, I wouldn't mind the $250 for Best Progress...hehe...*eyes rolling with $$$$*   Today was kinda great. Cause I got back my Chinese paper. I'm top in the class again. But it's only A2. And my class isn't really fantastic too, cause there are so many people who got their As in other classes. Oh well, at least it pulls down my L1R5. Then played carrom in band room after school. Somehow, people still think I'm good, and also find my fancy shots strange. But Mervin's the first person to attempt the fancy shots I do. hehe...he'll go a long way...(hey...who am I to say that). Just kidding...I'm really just an average player. And this was followed by an all out basketball session at Kin Lok's place. It was nice playing the game once again.   I watched 'High School Reunion' yesterday. And it kinda reminded me of my old school mates. Yippee!!! Teachers' Day will be here soon. And I hope I'll be able to gather with them this year. I decided to do something though. I'm gonna confess to my class monitoress that I had a crush on her. Not that I want her to know, but thought it'll be fun to laugh about it. Although I think she already knows. Or maybe the whole class knows. Ah!!! Abram didn't keep the secret!!! (he's my best friend in primary school.) Anyway, so exciting. I can imagine it now...hehe...so amusing.   Many things happen in my life this year. Particularly with other people. And things just don't turn out well. But somehow, I feel much more assured now. Cause I know that God makes all things beautiful in His time. So like the song says, Some Day We'll Know...   Listening to 'It's gonna be love' sang by Mandy Moore again. And there's something I disagree about the song. It goes:  The sooner you let two hearts beat together The sooner you'll know this love is forever (it's gonna be love) Love needs time now or never  And I disagree, cause like I learned, sometimes love have to wait. And the part about now or never. Sometimes,it's time now and it'll be never love. Ok, that's all I guess. Gotta rush on work.

						   Tired...    Recently, I just couldn't get myself down o blogging. Guess every Blogger goes thru this face. Well, I'm listening to 'Cry' by Mandy Moore now...nice song. Just recently, uploaded the 'A walk to remember' soundtrack from Junwen's CD. So now I'm just looking out for the show. But I wouldn't mind buying the soundtrack. So, if anybody does see it, tell me k?   It's CA period now. Was kinda stressed about it. But now, I really wonder what happened to the 'happy go lucky' me in the past. So I decided to relax a bit, and to take things easy. Well, my first two papers weren't good. In fact, it was kinda disasterous. Only can hope for the best now. At least I got 11/12 for one of my SS/History component. hehe...   Recently, I've been doing thinking and all. About how I should handle some stuff now, and even considered my service again. I wasn't sure if I was committing to Music Ministry. So I decided that I should make and effort to work on it. And for taking up more areas of service, I'm reconsidering too. I guess I'll have to pray about it, and go through my schedule for the rest of the year before considering. But it feels good knowing that you're making effort to focus on God again. It gives you alot of peace. Speaking of that, I'm still considering baptism. So just pray for me people.   OK...no more distractions. I shall focus on God now, and give Him my all.

						   Happy Day!  Today's a really great day!!! I came to school(despite not completing my homework), and got back results for two subjects. And to my surprise, I got a B3 for my CA paper for History. But that's just one component. So after adding everything else, I should get at least A2. But still hoping to keep the A1. And adding to that. I got my straight A's for humanities by getting A1 for Geography!!! Second in class. I feel so blessed. I never thought I'd did well this CA. And I don't think I even put in half as much effort as my classmates, yet I'm doing so well. Really thankful. And the most surprising thing is that although I never actually took Geography lessons very seriously(I gave up on Geog), I actually do well every time! And for some reason, my Geog teacher actually likes me! as in she's nice to me I mean. She was just giving me a funny look when I went to her class, and didn't understand till I got my paper. hehe...at least something to be happy abt after depressing results from E.math and Chemistry.  Yesterday I met this chat friend online. She's Caithlyn(hope I didn't spell it wrongly) from Victoria, Australia! So cool! I mean to have a friend from abroad. So we just talked. I wonder why it just feels so nice to talk to someone from abroad. It's like so exciting. And to think that you could even be poles apart with the person. hehe...  Anyway, about leaving comments, what I meant was that what you people say actually mean alot to me. And it reminds me that people care. So don't stop leaving comments k? Anyway, it does help me in considering and thinking about stuff. So don't stop. And thanks once again!

						   I'm a hypocrite.  The whole of this morning, I was just very bothered by the fact then I'm quite Pharisee. Sigh...it's like I just keep slapping the ' YOU ARE A HYPOCRITE!' In my face. I was kinda sad. Sigh...I almost cried. I think it was then that I really felt that I needed God, thatvI felt really sinful. I really hope to change. Especially after yesterday's message on 'In the world, but not of the world'. The passage is John 17. My life mission is to be salt and light for God, and to extend His kingdom. I think I really have to keep that in mind even as I go about my daily life.

						   I'm Back!  Thought I would never write(or rather type) here again. But many things have changed since I left. Like...er...ok. Maybe not that many. But anyway, I'll be much less frequent here due to my exams that are coming, and the exceeding connection bill. But I guess my guest would have all disappeared by now. But to all who drops by still to check if I'm updating, sorry for the trouble. And thanks for your time still.  Anyway, I've come to decided to take the baptism class. I don't know if I'll be getting baptised. That's if something unusual crops up along the way such that I back out. It's been quite a decision to make. In fact, I probably was leaning more towards not doing it. I decided to, not because I felt I was strong spiritually, but because I became aware of the misconceptions in my faith and practices and my sinfulness. I realised that I've been comparing with human standards. As a christian, I attempted to be perculiar, to be different. But I was only making sure that I was different from others. In a way, I was comparing with people, which led to me being judgmental and filled pride at times. And eventually, became a road block to my growth. But I realised that it is God standards we are to be comparing with. For we are to in Christ's likeness as Christians. And it is God's glory that we have fallen short. And it's really something important I learned. And I really hope that I could do my very best to live this life for God. And if this is so, there's really no reason that we should wait to get baptised.Thank God for the lesson.

						   Migraine...  Argh...I'm kinda getting a relapse of migraine these days, and it seems so long term now, and I get it so often. Just hope it'll go off. And I'm feeling really tired too. No idea why. Guess it's just the exams. Somehow, I really miss the 'happy-go-lucky' attitude.  I'm kinda like alone these days, haven't been catching up with anybody. So also don't tell people much about what's happening. And I'm getting too lazy to share my life with people already. Anyway, sometimes it just feels good to lead your own life. But guess that's kinda selfish though. But the good side of these now, is that I'm growing with God. So basically the only person I really share with is God. It really does give me the 'always here for me' feeling. I guess we can never be more secured than in Christ. We might not notice, but in our hearts, I believe that many of us depend on God. I remember reading in 'The Notebook' by Nicholas Sparks about how the girl, Allie, told the guy about how he was the only thing constant in her life. I guess that's what God is to me, someone who is always constant.  I'm starting to feel more for my school ministry already. We haven't been doing much recently, so I really hope that we would grow as a group. But it's hard especially when we're all from different denominations with different beliefs, so we kinda have different beliefs, or rather similar ones that are of different extreme-ness.  Oh ya...talking about other people just now, I'm glad I've been keeping in touch with Emilia since she left. It's like so cool! And we're sharing thru email la. So at least there's someone else I can talk to.  I've been trying to be perfect these days, and obviously I'm horrible at it. But guess that's true for any human. But I guess we should all just make the effort to be Christ-like. Not just better moraled people, but Christ-like(anybody can practice good morals).  I just realised that I usually don't have someone to talk to in church. Cos I was like just walking around this morning and felt so bored. Maybe it's just that I don't really have a fixed group of people to hang around. (haha...like Yongquan) But even with my own peers, there aren't much to talk about and if I ask about their lives, it just feels odd. I wonder how people start conversations so easily. I guess I don't talk well, even though I talk alot actually. But usaully end feeling interupting other people. Sian...maybe it's a chance for me to be in solitude. Besides that, I only talk to other people about work or something that is service related. Just hope it's not because I'm totally preoccupied with work.  There's this hymn we sung today. It came right after I was thinking about how little I loved God. Then just felt so bad and guilty. Then I started to get the 'am I a professing christian' feeling. But the hymn has this part that talks about how we realise our insignificant love for God, but yet we'll continue to love Him more and more. It's hymn 141 and here it goes:  It is a thing most wonderful, Almost too wonderful to be, That God's own Son should come from heaven And die to save a child like me.  And yet I know that it is true: He came to this poor world below, And wept and toiled and mourned and died, Only because He loved us so.  I cannot tell how He could love A child so weak and full of sin; His love must be most wonderful, If He could die my love to win.  But even could I see Him die, I could but see a little part Of that great love, which, like a fire, Is always burning in His heart.  It is most wonderful to know His love for me so free and sure; But 'tis more wonderful to see My love for Him so faint and poor.  And yet I want to love Thee, Lord: Oh, light the flame within my heart, And I will love Thee more and more Until I see Thee as Thou art!  William Walsham How, 1823-97

						   I don't need a reason to be angry with God!  Have you ever said this? Or at least just in your heart? Maybe you don't. But at times, my life and attitude show this.  There are just times when I blame God for things. Especially when it comes back to things that I cherish that might have been more precious to me than God is. It's when we cherish something more than we love God that we would save this. Are our lives truly for Him. If our lives are for God, do we have a reason to blame Him? Instead, we should be rejoicing  in all circumstances.  This is a special lesson. Cause I was reminded of my life as I was doing my quiet time. Which coincidentally happened a day after I watch 'A Walk to Remember'. Where, Jamie Sullivan, a girl who's found the love of her life and at the same time, dying from lukemia. Maybe it seems typical. But actually, Jamie was a devout Christian. Her faith meant everything to her. But when she fell in love, she was afraid. Not of death, but the very fact of not being able to be with Landon, her love. She faced the possibilty of being angry with God, because she couldn't let go. She was ready for her death as she contracted lukemia more than two years ago, and had since lived with the knowledge of her pending death. But she was not afraid, and had trusted God. Until something she cherished alot came into her life. My challenge to you is that, have you truly given every part of your life to God? Is there something that you just can't let go? Just asked God to help you, and lay down the 'reason to be angry with God' before Him.  And don't worry Jamie and Landon got married and she gave it all to God. Instead for being troubled by it, she became an encouragement to her husband. Well, thank God for this wonderful story. Although they didn't exactly "live" happily ever after.  And as I was saying, I realised this during my exam period(which is still ongoing). This help me to trust God and to even "give my work" for His glory. You might want to read Colossians 3:18-4:1. It's a simple and straightforward passage, but hope it reminds you to approach each and every ordinary thing today with a sincerity of heart and reverence for God.   Amen?

						   Letting my inner child out.  Ok. My inner child is 16 year old. (By the way, I'm 15 actually.) So I'm supposed to be quite realistic and I'm who I am suppose to be. Well, I hope I am. Cause I just realised that I'm pretty much not having all the fun that I should be having.  It's been quite boring these days. Not that I have nothing to do, but I really just feel like getting out of the house and hangout. Though the fact, is that there won't be anyone to hangout with. Only strange thing that everybody else is probably at home thinking about the  smae thing. Either way, Singapore is so small! Where can I go? At least there's YF tomorrow. So I can like take the chance to get out of the house a little. Only problem, that I now realise that I only have 8 days to prepare something to be done next Saturday! Arrr!!! Oh no...I'm really not in the mood to sit down and think these days. In fact, I think I'm trying hard not to be so indoors all the time. Why can't I be like really out going. Think that would be much more fun. OK...hope my old school friends would call up soon and decide on a day to hangout. (not to forget that it had better be on my free day, I haven't managed to join them for any since we left primary school)  Tried bowling a few days ago. Kinda cool. Although I lost the second game terribly with only 56 points. But I guess it's like that if you don't really play the game. Maybe I can go play bowling sometime again. (though my hand still hurts from the previous game) So, my class won third placing Inter-class Basketball Tournament. And guess what, I was in the team, when I didn't even touch the ball. Cause I lent my  PE attire to someone, so I didn't play. But who cares, at least I get a medal. *hehe*  Recently, I noticed too, that there are so many of my friends about my age with all the MSN nicks about love and stuff like that. Example: 'Loving you...it make me happy.'  and 'cos the way I feel when we're together, I know that's the way, I'll always feel for you...' Even my little sister typed something about love used to being everything. Thus, my hypothesis is that this is common in adolescents! (oops...I just declared it upon myself too.) But it's just real I mean, although someone already said it before I did, I never thought it would be so real. But it can be sweet, especially scenarios on TV. Wait...what am I saying! Well, you see, it's real. I mean it gets into me too.*blushes* Oh well, who cares...it'll be over...right? *hmm...*  Cool, this is getting a bit more sixteen year old. Make things sound so much interesting. I remembered this song sung by Mandy Moore called '17'. If only I had enough talent to write my own called '15 turning 16' But don't think I would be able to. I even gave up guitar without really trying.I have little perseverance. Maybe I should just stick with my clarinet. Then one day, I shall start a music revolution with classical crossovers to more pop, and maybe even rock!*haha* Impossible at my current pace.  Ok...I should go. I've got lots to do. Even though exams are over, I shan't be too lazy.

						   Stop talking...you're a 16 year old  Alright...I think my Blog is getting kinda like 'preachy' and all. I mean its ok to share here, but I think I'm missing out on my teenage life this way. So maybe I should just let loose a little bit.  Well, I got back my results just yesterday. And it was undescribable. Firstly, it was undesirable. Next, it wasn't terrible. So I'm just like totally feeling nothing, cause I don't know what to feel. Maybe it's something great. At least I can just let go. *bubbles fly away*  Here are my results:  English-69%-B3, Chinese-67%-B3, Geography-57%-C5, History/Social Studies-61%-B4, Additional Mathematics-69%-B3, Elementary Mathematics-54%-C6, Chemistry-71%-A2, Physics-48%-D7.

						   My Joy Found in Another's  Realised that people around us affect us so much. Even our mood and feelings. Ok...sounds like the often misunderstood 'Seeing you so happy makes me happy'. But isn't it so true that we really feel like that. Do we not find joy when we see joy in others? And feel pain for the person as you stand by the person feeling so hurt? And it feels great now to see that people around me are happy.  Recently, I've been just bored. It's like I want to have fun but don't know how. Oh well, but at least I have things to be occupied now. And not to forget all my band activities during the holidays. Just dread it. Maybe I should pray for a gift. Gift of music or singing. If only I could deny my passion for music. But I just can't do music well. And I can't sing well too. Sometimes we just wish we could choose our talents. Like at the start of every Role-playing Game. Where you decide certain skills that you will eventually be better at. Well, but life isn't about choice, but the will of God. Either way, if we were always given our own choices, maybe our lives would be in a mess then. Like everyone says, God knows what's best for us.

						   God, please be my everything...  How hard it is for that to happen... Recently, I'm kinda getting alot of the emotional wreckage. All the strong feelings of wanting to be loved.

If only I could be like those great man of faith. I used to wonder how we can ever have faith like theirs. Do we get faith by having faith?

						   Picking myself up  I'm abnormal. But everybody is. I have by weaknesses, but so do everybody else. I'm normal after all.  I'm really grateful for today really. Feeling really happy. I guess it's been really silly of me to thing of my inferiority and stuff. From now on, I want to pick myself up and live life to the fullest. Was just thinking about the past year yesterday, and realised how silly somethings were. Maybe I've learned alot this year. Oh well, must learn to be like my favourite fictional character, Jamie Sullivan. To really delight in God.

						   Personality Disorder  Well, personally I feel that I am avoidant and dependent. I'm very sure that I'm avoidant. It's plain obvious! Any person who knows me fairly well would know. I just never dare to try out new things and never have any self-confidence. And what makes this even more real is that I do create fantasy worlds where I'm supernatural or something, which coincides with the description for this disorder. I didn't need a test to discover that. Oh well...but the test is quite true actually. For me at least. Maybe it's just coincidental. So far I'm the only person who isn't totally surprised by my results. But I am very shocked by some other people's results. I mean is scary to see someone get High or Very High for everything. Yes, it's not accurate, but if you look at it relatively, comparing to the results of others, it's really scary and terrible. Sigh...  It's morning now, definitely hope it'll be a productive day.

						   Crazy Day  Well, I had sectionals this morning and band practices in the afternoon. So I went to Parkway with my friends for lunch. And we took 36 back to school. But we missed our stop and went on the expressway where it only stopped nearing Changi Airport. But we thought we could cross the road to take us back to school, only to find out that none of the buses bring us back. So we thought we would just get into any bus and get closer to school first. But turned out that before we could get even close to school, the bus turned into an expressway that brought us to Woodlands via Pasir Ris. And we took taxi back from Seleter Camp.  Well, just wanted to fill up this entry I accidentally created. Oh well.

						   Avoidant Avoidant personality disorder is characterized by extreme social anxiety. People with this disorder often feel inadequate, avoid social situations, and seek out jobs with little contact with others. They are fearful of being rejected and worry about embarassing themselves in front of others. They exaggerate the potential difficulties of new situations to rationalize avoiding them. Often, they will create fantasy worlds to substitute for the real one. Unlike schizoid personality disorder, avoidant people yearn for social relations yet feel they are unable to obtain them. They are frequently depressed and have low self-confidence.

						   Losing myself in myself  OK...my spiritual walk hasn't been great lately. It's always fluctuating. If only I can be constantly reminded of God. Sigh...I just don't know what to say about it. I mean, now, my life is just so bland, without all the peace and joy and all. I guess, I'm just spending too much time thinking about myself...and burying myself in activities that attend to my own interest. I even try to seek attention at times...sigh...(I associate myself with seeker not for this reason) I'm self-centered...Music Ministry was into that Others-centered thingy over lunch. I guess it'll be just so great if we never got distracted by our own desires. But because of this, I guess all the more we are dependant on God. Either way, it's best to be God-centered.  Holidays have started. But I wouldn't expect this holidays to be a great one. There's so much homework and band practices. Even if I don't do my work and just enjoy, I won't be able to totally lift that burden. Anyway, I don't have many plans for my holidays. It's like there isn't really anything I want to do, and there's no one to go out with. I just want to spend time with certain people. People I love so dearly and mean so much to me. It's like it is just the presence that matters.  I saw Melissa and Michelle praying together yesterday, and I was like telling Jiashu that it's so sweet. And he told me that I could do that too. And I'm just totally shocked. If I'm not wrong, I only prayed once with one of my sisters personally. At least that's all I remembered. And it was when I accepted Christ into my life. Sigh...just realised that my family so rarely spend time together.  I don't know how to end this entry. Maybe I'll just leave it hanging.

						     You are Minerva McGonagall! Strict, tough, and clever, you are the Transfiguration teacher and Head of Gryffindor house. You are a hard but fair teacher with high expectations and impeccable morals. You wear your hair in a tight bun and indeed, never deviate from what is proper. However, you care deeply about the students and have great house pride. You are responsible, reliable, and trustworthy. -art by Tealin-    urlLink   What long-time Hogwarts staff member are you?      brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

						   Definition  What's my definition? What am I about? What's my life about? My life is so boring altogether. Do I have a hobby? Do I have a best friend? Do I have someone that I'm really close to? Do I have a regular interest that occupies my time? I can say no to all these answers. Maybe my sister is right. My defintion is me. I spend all the time worrying about myself and how people will look at me. I cannot enjoy anything, cause I'm always worrying about myself. I love to plan. I plan what I'm going to do tomorrow, next week, next month of even far into the future. And what do I do tomorrow? I plan for the day after tomorrow! How exciting! (sarcastically)  I do not know how to describe my day. I've been feeling odd lately. I've been thinking much more and it's always nothing good. And I get this chill running down from my chest to my stomach, just exactly what I'm going thru now and throughout the day too. Argh...  Words to describe my day: Odd, sad, tearful, happy, useless, reflective, misfit, destructive, lame, futuristic, uncomfortable, rainy, boring, sleepy.

						   New Age  Recently, I just kinda caught up in new age classics, or otherwise known technically as classical crossovers. Well, I think it's really kinda cool. Some examples would be 'Bond' and 'The Planets'. I think they are much more 'cooler' then those boy bands and stuff. They just 'class'! (I can't say that they rock) Oh well, maybe I can now find my type of music.  Talking about new age, I was watching the International Inter-Varsity Chinese Debates. And there were these Sweden and some other European University debating on whether 'Man should be encouraged to be the breadwinner of the family, while women be homemakers.' And a main point that kepy coming up was the difference between the old society or the modern society, in other words, the new age. And in relation to this, my sister (Jasmine) said that I must know how to wash dishes cause girls don't know how to these days and they won't fancy guys that can't wash dishes (whatever *rolls eyes*). What's the world coming to?!?! As much as I believe that men shouldn't look for wifes to be their maids, women shouldn't look for men to be homemakers! It's like hiring a lifetime servant with courtship, roses and that XX carat diamond ring!!! Come on, no matter how much society has changed, the fact that marriage is more than mere distinction of roles remains the same. Marriage is about feeling and life commitment, not slavery of servant-hood. Oh...I don't bother. People are just creating more problems for themselves. Humans just have to put every role or job or anything on a scale. Bad is no longer just not good. But rather, they are just like numbers representing a scale of measurement. Comparison is a way of priding  ourselves.  Ok...I got pricked by seven gigantic cactus needles. I had to pull 3 out and 1 is still stucked. This is official declaration that the most dreaded plant to me is...*drum rolls*...CACTUS!!! (Mr Cactus goes on stage) Mr. Cactus says, 'Firstly, I would like to thank Yonghan, who got pricked by my needles, without whom, I wouldn't be where I am today... ...'  Today is my sister's (Rosemary, I have 4 sisters) birthday, so hope she's had a happy day, apart from the person who approached her concerning the survey. hehe.  Ok...I'm going now. Life has been a daze. A day pasts, and time flies as fast as a Golden Snitch can fly!

						   Argh...today started with me waking up with a pain in my wrist, and it still hurts now as I press on the keyboard. Probably due to my terrible sleeping position and getting my hand squashed under my body. Oh well, hope it heals soon. Either that, long enough for me to miss my performance on 6th December. I don't wanna perform without being able to practise.  YF for today was Bible Study and Student Ministry Time. The video did by Student Life Sub-commitee (the one I'm in) was quite funny. But turned out that some parts were able to impact certain people. And I did round up. Was quite nervous, but not that nervous actually for someone doing it the first time. Hope it was fine. After all, it's God's message and I didn't want to deliver it poorly. Maybe I would post it here sometime, so those who couldn't catch my words can read it for themselves.  I kind of miss people. Although I see this people rather often, but it just feels like you haven't really met them. Like you don't really talk with them and stuff. Well, my life kinda just surrounds going about doing things now. I think I'm happy. At least I'm less moody these days, not that I am often. But I do feel love and patient sometime. And it's great. It's great to do chores and feel happy about it. I guess a very delightful form of service is help. Being helpful and simple and makes you feel really light-hearted.  Oh well, I should go now. Should catch some sleep before some of the interesting happenings to take place the next day.

						   A New Hope  I think there's much more certainty in life now. And I just got down and settled quite some personal matters. I guess things would be a bit better from now on. Just hope that I'll not repeat my mistakes in life.  Today, being Sunday was spent in church. Really feel good today. Except that everyone disappeared so quickly (proabably due to exams), that the day turned out quite boring except for watching TV and good food.  Oh well, I don't know what to write again. I'm not really very inspired now. Either way, I don't want to keep talking about the same things too. And much of what I've been going through these days are rather personal. So sorry for the lack of content.  This is just kind of a follow up to the 'Point Scoring' thing. Well, firstly nobody's really actually that shallow, so point proves that even if cooking scores points, it doesn't really make much a difference. Someone even commented that cooking doesn't score points, but it's character that matter. So conclusion is that, this point scoring system is degrading human intellect.hehe.

						   I think my life kinda got interesting again. Which means I won't be so settled anymore. With more people walking into my life, I can't live with so much certainty anymore.  Have been thinking about the same thing and people for the past few days until now. It's like I just can't get it out of my mind. Oh well.  Anyway, have to introduce a new member of my life story. Esther is a sweet Chrisitian girl that I got to know recently. She's kinda like into love poems and novels. Kinda like me a while ago. Yup. (Do not worry my brothers and sisters, I don't need sermons from everyone of you guys after this...hehe...there people who need them more them me! Oops! Almost spilled the beans.)  Today is Yongquan's sister's(imagine if I take out "sister's") wedding day. So kinda was at his house earlier this morning. Cool, got some updates from him, and new secrets. Yeah! Don't worry Yongquan, I will not tell the world that XXXXXXXXX! Haha...no way I'm gonna say it. Continue hoping that I'll actually do so. hehe.  Ok...I'm camp group leader for this year's Youth Retreat. This is so discouraging cause I have such busy people in my camp group. Press on! Empower me!!! But hope to get to know some people better like Jiahui *waves* (though I don't think she visits my blog. Like anyone actually do.) , Gareth (Glen's brother) and Paul (Louis's friend). This is exciting. But with the knowledge that I have less than two weeks to complete ALL my holiday assignments at the back of my head. I guess it'll be quite torturous when it comes to mind.  VS and PLMGSS clarinetist are up to no good. Sorry Cheong Hing and Eudora! It's not my fault! But it's gonna be fun!!! *cheeky thoughts in my head* It's great that no school people have my blog. If not I won't be able to be so transparent about this. If it were so, I probably would get it from my "dearest" section leader.(it's sarcastic, but he's my friend still)  Ok...should go and do something about my homework.

						   It's Christmas. Just 6 more days to the new year, 2004. Where all would start anew.  Looks like I hit the hot topics this week. And my previous entry was probably a must read special edition for many people. So much so that people actually gather and read it together. Pretty amusing, I would have to say. But not many understood fully how I felt when I typed everything on that day. I thank this person, because this person truly understands me. (Besides God.)  Hmm...to be honest it's pretty cool to be the main thing in conversations, but at the same time, I really dread being the center of attraction. So will everybody out there just pretend I didn't say anything? I'm trying to get on with my life here you know. It's like having a paparazzi following you day in, day out.  I wish I could be much more innocent. Like little children. And that's just what I plan to work on. To abide by the will of God, with innocence like a child's. Having an inner child of 1 year old isn't exactly a right thing you know. Some how, I think I foresaw my life now when I was only 6. Because that year, the thing I dreaded most, was to grow up. I didn't want to grow up.  "Truly, I say to you, unless you turn and become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. Whoever humbles himself like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven." -Matthew 18: 3-4- (English Standard Version)  Second thing. I want to be a whitelighter to others in the new year. Not in the sense of physically being able to orb everywhere and appear when the call, but I want to be a guardian to people. Which I always failed to be. Because I am never sensitive enough. I cannot care enough. It probably just wasn't in my character. But people, just let me get on with life and be a guardian angel to my friends.  I need to learn about love. It is something which is so hard to grasp, yet so powerful. All I want is to love like God loves us.  "A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another: just as I have loved you, you also are to love one another." -John 13: 34- (English Standard Version)  "Innocence is precious and should be treasured." -Leo-

						   My life is in constant motion. Falling away, and the next moment coming back together. Then fall away again...like air particles moving at high speeds in random motions. And right now, I just feel that I'm losing control of my own life. But that's no problem, cause most of the time I would be able to gather it back. But there are just certain things I wish to address.  As many who know me would know that I just camp back from the Youth Retreat. And to be honest, despite the many changed lives and people, and people who thoroughly enjoyed and learned from the camp, my experience was a totally different one. It was probably one of the worst camps I've ever been to. Not in terms of planning or the work done by the commitee, but rather my role during the camp as group leader, and the discouragement I get so often.  It started out with that terribly barren population of my group (this is no offence to my ex-group members), which already removed half my heart for excitement during the camp. Then the next day, I got really fed up, cause it's so hard to be a friend to people and at the same time a group leader. I was angry with people, but more with myself. And all the 'like here like there' thingy (my sister refers to it this way) really destroys my day. To be honest, I think that adolescent 'love' is probably pure infatuation and selfish foolishness, I know that by saying this, I offended like 99.99% of my close friends (that's if I ever had any), but I don't care, cause that's what I think. I'm not talking this in a bias viewpoint. In fact, I didn't say this because I just had a rejection from someone I really 'like', but instead, it's quite the opposite.  I shall now officially leave the topic of camp. And now, I have a confession to make. A big one. One that's probably an invitation to a one to one personal time with almost everyone who reads this entry. Here goes...For this past year, I've had two mutual crushes. Don't mind me using the word. I don't believe in adolescent 'love' anymore, although I should have thought better than to believe in something so 'fairy tale' in the first place. One lasted  10 months and another a week. And just a moment ago, I felt terrible and guilty and was faced with the: 'She needs you more from both people.' You know, at this point of time, you just want the whole world to tell you that you're a sinful scumbag who is heartless and deserves all condemnation possible. That would have made me feel better. Instead, every single person I talked to said I did the right thing and at least I was honest and all. Oh...brother... But now, I've made up my mind and I'm telling myself that I'm never going to like another girl (I'll just perish all thoughts concerning anything like it) for 5 years. That'll help. It's not that hard after having made the same mistake with two different people. Disclaimer: This two people are great people, but my heart is now hardened and I shall not let them take any romantic position in my life which I feel is hardly possible even if I allow them to, since adolescent 'love' is just a lie that you want to spend the rest of your life with someone. *quote*love or not love, true love, such a thing is too early to be possible for us.*unquote*  I don't understand why people fall out with people. You know, like why can't the whole world be friends? I know the problem is sin. But everyone things that it's the other person. Partly, I mean totally, that's due to sin too. But people just tend to be selfish, don't they? I often feel that the young people (around my age) are separated into two factions. There's a group that is the 'in' group. Supposedly better looking and the more well dressed and fun people to be with, and the more quiet, if not less popular people that only just want to have friends. (forgive me...) This are just my thoughts, nobody said they are or were true. Ok...this is out of point. I think I just wanna express my unhappines.  I was at the Music Camp Concert on Sunday night. And looking at the kids, I realised that innocence is so precious, and is something that should be well treasure. With innocence, all you want is fun and be happy. As someone said, 'You just like this person *full stop*' 'Love' would be ten times more fun, and also, in case of self conciousness, it is practically non-existent. I mean I went just where a Batman costume and walk about the street without worry about being laughed at if only I still there much of innocence. It'll be silly to say that I am not innocent at all, cause if you say that you are, you're probably too innocent. But I do feel that I'm innocent, but still not enough to be the inner child inside of me, which I would like to deny that is 16 years old.  Ok...last of all. I still love God and He has control over my life. After all this, all the more so. I've sort out my thoughts, my life is God, that's my decision. Soli Deo Gloria!

						   Finally the new year. 2004. Amidst all the celebration and changes that are soon to take place, I have to say that I am not ready. My heart is still troubled. Over what I am not sure. But I do not feel peace. Which is contrary to what the watchnight message was talking about, and what everyone was wishing each other when the clock struck 12.  Didn't sleep last night. It was the YF watchnight programme. Was very tired. After that and slept from 8am to 2pm. Oh well, had to wake up and continue with homework.  I've been feeling stressed today. The thought of going back to school, band and all the busy schedule just freaks me out. I had no peace. And I wasn't ready for school cause my work wasn't done and my mind couldn't run. I wasn't ready for band cause I haven't touched my instrument for weeks and there's a band practice the next day. I wasn't ready for a bisy schedule because I've been just an emotional wreck. I'll probably just be overwhelmed and go crazy. While I was doing my work half way, I just had to stop in the middle of my book review to go thru unresolved matters and my new year resolutions. It's 'O' level year this year, and my year isn't going to be what I pictured. Sigh...  One major consideration is whether to play for the concert in February. Basically, it's my last public performance in Singapore. But I am not ready both physically, technically and emotionally. I've been having headaches, I'm tired, I stressed up and I can't play my pieces for nuts! I haven't even begun practicing them, and there's only a month to it! Argh...  Oh well, I'm really trying to give it all to God now. Guess He's the only one I can depend on now. While in the mean time, I'll see if I can stay out of the performance and give the audition a miss as well.  Oh well, should go. Peace be with me...and all of you out there. Shalom.

						   I have finally started on my homework. But to much disppointment, I am unable to complete all my E. Math by today. Which means I'll have to eat into tomorrow. But then again, I'll have to do my Chemistry as well. Gosh...what trouble have I brought upon myself.  Oops...realised that it's past 12. Which means by today's meant the day before. Oh well, yesterday then, was rather boring. I mean besides doing my homework, practically nothing. Besides SMSing Yen and answering a few calls. But, quite enough to brighten up my night. Yen told me to look out into the night sky. Well, in this situation what more can I expect than stars. It was nice, and beautiful. But incomparable to other nights I've seen overseas. But made me wonder enough about what's behind them. Just look behind it, from fiery beauty to vacuum. Oh well, of course God's behind them to be honest. But still, quite enough of stars and encouraging words to light things up.  Feel the breeze, Hear the leaves, See the glittering Stars, Through the mist. Along which Our sorrows lift, Behold! How joy and beauty Interweave.  by God through Annabelle (She puts it that way)  Oh well, everyone's into the stars thing. Hidden stars, faint rainbows, to everybody, it seems like they are finally revealed to the human eye. Inspiration is in the air...coupled with wind. Poems everywhere. Yen said she has to write one before she sleeps and kinda encouraged me to write one too. I wrote one on Monday pass 12am. Though it's kinda like the opposite intent in many people. Oh well, I'll try to write one. Just that my rooms air-conditioned, so guess all the inspiration is low in the air.  Happy Birthday Yen and Min! Their birthday...which means it's the 30th! Ok...3 more days to school reopen. Oh gosh...I just hope I won't get into too much trouble next year. This is the time when you hope that the rest of the well, did only as much homework as you did.  Alright...time to Orb to dreamland or as in Annabelle's Contemporary English Dictionary, off to Lala Land. But on second thoughts, maybe I should stay of to do homework. Oh well, as the flesh leads. *haha*

						   I feel cold. Not because of the air-conditioner in my room, nor the weather. But my heart is cold. Cold from within. I cannot understand at all the warmth of care and concern.  My social life is breaking down. I feel anti-social. It is not my intent to talk to anyone at all. I'm satisfied with the few people I can talk to. But now, they all seem to be walking away. I can only feel loniness. I can only fall on my family now. That's one thing that remains constant in my heart.  People tell me that they are encourage by my sharing. But I just cannot make out what I was saying. I was just sitting in front of the entire YF, almost screaming out my feelings. I felt better after that. Even I teared as I returned to my seat. Why did I tear? What is it that made me tear...? I am not sure. But I felt better...  The painting above is only a scribble. Everyone says it's abstract. Indeed, it is deep. Messy lines filled with intense mystery. But yet, it feels so empty. It's like opening thousands of doors and locks, and in the end find this empty space which was supposedy the expected reward and final success. But only to find darkness and silence. Darkness so blinding, and Silence so deafening.  I am cold From within the heart. So hardened and void. Stealth, Yet not peace. Tearing Into thin air. Drops from the eye, Falling into constant movement, where there is no direction. Like a scribble, 'Filled' with rage And strength in each stroke, Yet only emptiness. Like thousands of doors, Locks and lockets, Opening into a revelation Of a mystery. Mystery is revealed. Darkness so blinding, And silence so deafening. Like behind a star. From fiery beauty, To vacuum.

						   When you're a child, you're less aware of the bigger picture. Even if the world is painted as a big mural right in front of you, a child will only run close up to the painting and see what's in front of him only. It may be just a small part depicting some warmth and joy, but that's all it matters to a child. There's only so much, so far a child may be able to see. As you grow up, you learn to step back, and see the bigger picture. That's when your eyes are opened and you start shifting your focus to other parts of this art, and realize that there are so many different feelings depicted in a single mural. Much more things have happened every year since the turn of the century, and that forms the sorrow, burden and pains of the picture. Sometimes i wish i never grow up; but i know that i get more strength from God each day as i step a step further back to view this mural of life.  -Adapted from Zeslene's Blog, which was adapted from elsewhere-

						   I have no idea why I decided to come back again. Just wanted some source of recreation I guess. Although at this point in time, I shouldn't be talking about recreation, I have two chinese essays to complete and here I am typing away at 9.30pm. Argh...can't get into the mood of doing work, well at least it's just Chinese work I guess. I think I really need to put down band life soon so I can finish up my work and revision in school. My home makes me want to sleep or whatever activity besides doing work.  Hmm...I'm form 9!!! Vampire eh...not my idea of me. Haha...oh well, hoping I'll get something that is more of hope and light and something angelic perhaps. But turn out that is dark and blood drowned. Makes out that I'm a blood sucker. Even Sherlyn got something like Phoenix. Maybe mine will turn out a better form if I didn't say that I feel lonely at times even when I know that there are people who love me. Anything, don't even really understand the description for my results anyway.

						     You are Form 9,  Vampire : The Undying.   "And The Vampire was all that remained on the blood drowned creation.  She attempted to regrow life from the dead.  But as she was about to give the breath of life, she was consumed in the flame of The Phoenix and the cycle began again."   Some examples of the Vampire Form are Hades (Greek) and Isis (Egyptian). The Vampire is associated with the concept of death, the number 9, and the element of fire. Her sign is the eclipsed moon.  As a member of Form 9, you are a very realistic individual.  You may be a little idealistic, but you are very grounded and down to earth. You realize that not everything lasts, but you savor every minute of the good times.  While you may sometimes find yourself lonely, you have strong ties with people that will never be broken.  Vampires are the best friends to have because they are sensible.    urlLink   Which Mythological Form Are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

						   Today's YF programme was Lifestyle talk: Sex and Relationships. Conclusion is that I am critical of relationships happening at my age. And I felt as though I've just been persuaded by someone that love is possible. I never did deny love though, no matter how hardened I am towards it, it still existent. And I can never deny the goodness in it. Yet, I seriously don't want to be bothered. Either way, someone spent his time telling all about the possibilty of love happening at anytime, any age,  but I still can't be bothered. I am not interested in knowing about love. It's a distraction to me now, so just let me throw it aside. I have a promise to God to keep. For five years, I shall not be distracted by such.  Why talk about a relationship with another human being when I can't even get my relationship with God right. My spiritual life is like a desert now. So dry and arid. Only longing for God to spark and interest in my heart so as to open up my heart now. I have now no capacity to praise Him in my MSN nick. Neither do I have a strong desire to serve. Just what is wrong. Reaching the invisible God. Was I ever actually in a really fulfilling relationship with God? Or was it all just an artificial thirst for knowledge? It's like as though I've used up all the natural resources on my earth.  In the struggle for a relationship with something so intangible. So intangible, that I actually doubt. I am now unable to trace His hand with great cetainty, or trust His heart with great faith. He seems to be non-existent. But He is there.

						   Just reached home about 45 minutes ago. School life is rather traumatising. Even now, as I sit down here typing, I have 350 more pages of 'The Count of Monte Cristo' to finish. If I was like a few of my friends, it wouldn't be a problem. But in my case, it'll be quite a feat to finish this book by tomorrow. But no point putting myself through such anxiety. What is a small percentage of CA marks compared to my physical, emotional and mental distress? (Basically stress.) So, in any case, I've decided to take it easy. After all, my life isn't about, my expectations and me writing my biography with complete control of the story line. So I'll just let go and let God take control. What difference does it make if I go to SAJC with 14 points (that's if I am able to), instead of getting to a top 5 JC. Even in thinking logically, getting to SRJC doesn't mean I can't get to University. How much more do I have to convince myself since such a reason really does make sense to me? Furthermore, God doesn't look at grades. Will God love me less for not getting below 10 points for 'O' level? No way!If my God is as of such particular a person about worldy merits, what need would I have of him? Do I need another person to act as school teachers, employers, etc.? For the wisdom of men is foolishness to God.  This question I've been pondering about. What is blind faith? Is that such a thing at all?  Is it better to trace His hand with great certainty?

						   Life hasn't been at its best lately. Right now, even as I type this at 10:14 pm on Sunday night, I have my chinese composition at the back of my mind.  Recently, I've been having satisfaction. Satisfaction that I haven't had for a long time. Yet, incomplete satisfaction. My life consists of school, band and school and band. (now, not so much of band anymore) But obviously, there is something lacking. Even though I do not have to face unnecessary problems anymore, I do not have the contentment found in a rich spiritual life, a blooming relationship with, if I still in any way display that, my personal Lord and Saviour, and Friend. Basically, God. Reaching the invisible God. All the more because of God's invisible qualities, He is more real to us. We reach out and find Him there. But the question is not whether He's there when we reach out, but rather, do we want to even bother trying what would seem the most absurd and make believe thing. To reach out to a 'non-existent' God (in terms of scientific protocol). I realised that I do not have a problem with prayer. In fact, God promises to help in prayer. But the problem is that I can't get myself down to pray. It all seems as though that there is no reality of a conversation in 'speaking to air'. Everytime I get down to pray, I find myself performing my usual utterance that cease to mean anything, all this done and spoken into air. There is no assurance that anyone is actually listening, and in fact, logically, our mind just rejects such an activity as ridiculous and nonsensical. Yet the wisdom of Man is foolishness to God. What may seem as silly activity of self utterance is actually to God, a very real conversation that engages the soul and mind of a person? Since when was God logical in our eyes and reasoning? Did God chose the rich over the poor, displaying favouritism? 'Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven'. The Beatitudes in Matthew 5 tells us that. The qualities that we learn of God is unlogical to human understanding, how could we then expect a God that pertains to our understanding? How can possibly demand a logical reasoning to the mysterious activity of prayer? If God were like us, all would be lost. But God is not like us, instead He sent His Son to die for us that we might be reconciled through Him, to our loving Father. What greater love is than one that lays down His life for His friend. Agape.

						   MASTERMIND (Submissive Introvert Abstract Thinker )   Like just 8% of the population you are a MASTERMIND (SIAT). You can be silent and withdrawn, but behind your reserved exterior lies an active mind that allows you to analyze situations and come up with creative, unexpected solutions. Normal people call this "scheming." Don't learn German.   Anyway, your sense of style and originality are your strengths, and people will respect your judgment once they get to know you. If you learn to be a little more personable, you could be a great leader--you've definitely got the "vision" thing down. Just make sure all the plotting you do behind those eyes of yours is healthy.

						   It's the last day of the exams with a heavy paper. But it's really too heavy for anyone to withstand. Chinese and Geography Paper 2. Get real my school, it's not going to work! But, they're expecting us to have prepared for it earlier. And I haven't.  Today's paper was a disaster. It was really tough. But the others said it was fine. Well, maybe I haven't done enough revision. I can sense that my results this time is going to be way different from the usual. And someone's going to come up to me and compare with me, and realise that I did really badly. Oh well. I am at peace. I'm only disturbed that people are going to be really surprise. Just hope that they don't ask why. The point is, Chemistry is going to be no distinction.  I really hope I can get down to work soon. The major exams aren't that far off and I haven't started my intensive revision yet. But at the same time, I really hope to spend more time reading Christian literature and do some Bible study on my own. Funny how it's hard to find time for the eternal.  My style of blogging is changing altogether again. It's no longer full of thoughts and insights. It's so dry. Reading it, I actually find that it is kind of boring. But I can't help it. I haven't had time to think much. Was going to thinking of why people sin, and whether they enjoy it. But I perish the thought after caressing it for a few seconds, "It's going to take forever.", I told myself. There's no time to think! I'd rather sleep to be more economical. Thinking is draining you know.  Some people are getting really stressed up. Teachers. Miss Koh's more stressed than I am. Maybe, it's not that stressful to be a Singaporean student. Dealing with affairs concerning money and other administration matters probably is more stressful than exams.  Looks like I'm getting down to blogging again.  What whould you write if you got 'Temptation.' as an essay question?

						   Even as I go about updating my blog after not doing so for so long, I really still have my Chemistry revision at the back of my mind. But this could be a good way of having a break.  I really like the new skins that blogger offer. Although this isn't exactly original anymore, but it's still cool.  I seem to be at a lost of words, not knowing what to say after my cessation of blogging. Maybe I could update another time, or maybe I'll just let everyone know that I've been having great peace during this time of examinations, yet, I've got the feeling that I ain't going to do well this time. Yeah, it isn't disturbing, I'm still peaceful. Oh, by the way, the comprehension passage was interesting.

						   Sometime ago, I quoted C.S. Lewis on my MSN nickname, saying,'Good people know about both good and evil: bad people do not know about either.' But after a while, I began to have some thoughts about it.  If a bad person did not know both good and evil, on what basis is he a bad person at all, since he wouldn't know that what he was doing was wrong in the first place. And in fact this would lead to a good person having the ability to do evil, a greater ability than the 'bad' person's capacity to do something wrong. Furthermore, it is also very untrue to say that, even if we said that we were judging the person on the basis of an external 'law' (in other words, not the person's knowledge of good and evil but someone else's), since if this is a 'good' person can equally be 'good' even though he does not know both good and evil. Thus, the statement is not true, since a 'good' person need or need not know both good and evil, as with the 'bad' person as well.  According to God, a good person needs to know both good and evil, and at the same time for a bad person as well, since it is only when a choice is given that a person can be bad or good based on the choice he made. So, a person is judged not by what he does, but what he has chosen to do. For example, we do not say that this waiter is good because he has served the food to my table, because he was only doing what he should, especially since he is obliged to do so as part of his job. Thus, a person is only as good as his intention.  So what do we say of a person who knows not both good and evil? We say that this person does not have a choice, in other words, no free will. The person is made to do both good and evil without his own intention to do either. (note: this is on the basis that everything is either good or evil, and there is no neutral, thus, only absolutes. Otherwise, you cannot only look at it as a person has no free will concerning doing good and evil)But, we must know that it is hard to come by a person that know neither both good and evil. Because according to God, the Law and conscience as well has made this knowledge available to all humans. And at the same time, it is said that all humans have free will.  This brings us to another question. How about the person who knows only good or evil? I would see that a person who knows only what is good, has no free will since he is made to believe that everything he does is good, since he knows only good. It is the same for a person who knows only evil. For if he knows that whatever he does is wrong and is unable to do anything about it, he has no free will. (This is beyond our imagination. Try to imagine a person feeling bad about the evil he does, but he can only do evil. It is great torture.)  We can also see it as an impossible mode, since, if a person had free will, it would mean that he has a given choice, and thus, he knows the opposite of what he first knows. Which means he knows both good and evil.  The very basis of my argument here is that there is a common absolute moral standard which we all accept. This would mean a higher being or Law. In other words, on the basis that there is God.  To my brothers and sisters in Christ, please be aware that God decides what is good and evil. In the sense that obedience and likeness to Him is good, and disobedience to Him is evil. God is good, not beacuse He is judged and is good. But rather, He is good because He made Himself the absolute model of good. In other words, it is important to note that 'good' is 'likeness to God', instead of God being judged and declared good.

						   Yes, it has been several days since my main paper ended, and my personal post exam activities has also started. But instead of going out of my firends everyday (which I didn't do at all), I stayed at home the past few days accept for the many solo trips to different Christian bookstores (haven't been to SKS yet). I've bought two books so far. 'Paul, A Novel' and 'How To Read The Bible For All Its Worth'. Though I'm not exactly sure whether I'll have time to read them, especially after the Mid-Year Examinations, now that I have come to realise that I'd better catch up with my revision. Furthermore, the Chinese 'O' levels and Band Overseas Trip will be coming up soon.  So there are two main obligations that I'm experiencing now. Mainly, the obligation to relax, and the obligation to study (for my Chinese). And it wouldn't take a genius to know that they are contradicting or conflicting thoughts (will sound much cooler). So it's kinda hard to do work now. But, I'm planning to start Chinese revision as soon as I get done with my Mom's documents, and making final preparations for Sunday School First Half this Sunday.  Talked to Emilia yesterday. Oh, she's such a fun dude. Sometimes I wonder if its because of the society over at Canada. She just seems like she's having fun in life. Singaporean students, can't live outside the textbooks. Maybe its a minority. Cause my school friends are still having fun. And in fact, some of us are having fun studying. (that's a rare species, I'm sure)  OK, I guess that'll be an effective update. If any special, unique, thought provoking thoughts (which only come only when I read or have too much time to think) come into my mind, I'll just post it in another entry.

						   I ain't have any problem with my results. In fact, I should be more than thankful for it, as it is purely God's blessings and I have done nothing so as to deserve it. Of course, I know that I can do better, especially when I focus my attention over my English performance. That's probably the subject that really sticks out like a sore thumb.  63.8% for English. That's really disappointing to know. Just a mark less on my Mid-Year paper, and I'll be in for English remedial. Which simply amounts to the fact that I'm of the weaker students in the school when it comes to English. This is of a great importance or might be better described as irritation and disturbance. English is an important subject. Not just here in Victoria School, nor Singapore, but all over the world. It means as much as you can't do anything if you're not proficient at it. Furthermore, I'm a humanities student. Where am I ever going to land up without a good command of the English Language? Just when I was thinking of reading more Chinese books, the results and initial news of me entering the English remedial completely changed my mind. I'd be in the remedial alright, if I hadn't just when to see the principal and ask why I'm in it in the first place, since I passed the mark? I'm out of the remedial. Nonetheless, it is still humiliating and very disappointing to be that close. The reality pounces on me. 'You're bad at English!'  Therefore, it's going to be all out for English now. I'm going to get that A1 by all means. And prove to my dear principal that I didn't need his remedial. Why did he have shout at us anyway? We're free from his rememdial according to his requirements. 'You better make sure you do well in English!', he said. And worst of all, he wrote at the back of my report card, 'Given reprieve from English class.' He had to use the word 'reprieve'.  Oh Lord, curb my anger.

						   Very much, my current spiritual status would be a period of non-life application approach to biblical teachings, and maybe even a lack of spiritual fulfillment.  I am no longer the kid that I knew of myself the previous years when I would just be enthusiastic in sharing and serving. It is as though I have come into my very own 'spiritual desert' as many people described.  But thankfully, with an increasing excitement for the Word of God and Christian Literature, it appears that God is leading me back to live in His presence. But a problem I still encounter would be my lack of prayer and the experience. It is as though I am on the excess of the Reformed Movement and the lack of the Charismatic Movement. Not that the other extreme is better, but based on the 'oscillating pendulum' theory, a balance down to a middle in between would be the best and eventually narrowing to the point of accordance with God's plan which would come on the Day, where we would all be perfected in knowledge as well.  "God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.", said Jesus in John 4:24. So may we all be able to worship him with full of spiritual experience and also with clear and sound knowledge concerning the Word of God, worshiping in spirit and truth.

						   Concerning my previous entry about my thoughts on a quote from C.S. Lewis, I would wish to review it sometime again according to his context in the book. This is needed especially since I have forgotten some of its content during my previous entry. Furthermore, to produce such a statement against an authority in English Language would be as good as throwing an egg against a rock. Thus, I am quite sure I have missed out on some of his context. Unfortunately, this will only be done when I'm free to think about it.  However, the views I expressed is very much my ideas and also possibly influenced by my own readings which might include C.S. Lewis himself. Anyway, I sincerely feel that C.S. Lewis is a great author.

						   Yes, I know that it has been a long time since I made an entry, and it's becoming part of my blogging really. It's like our lives. Sometimes we're just full of fervour about things, yet other times, we can't really be bothered with anything else except keeping ourselves alive physically. It is part of our lives and there's no point controlling this 'phenomenon' too much. This 'phenomenon', I would say, is completely natural. But Christianity tells me something else. A Christian should always seek a life full of fervour for God and His work. This, that Christianity suggests, is completely unnatural then? Yes. No doubt it is unnatural. The Christian life cannot be natural, it is supernatural! It is a spiritual life. And I particularly like it in C.S. Lewis' term, the  Zoe.     &nbsp;  Oh, life is so full of different phases. Last year, I have dwelled so much into emotions. But this year, I'm somewhere else. I'm in the area of 'practical-ism' and planning for the future. Though I currently stand in this position, I am fully aware that my position is very wrong. This is what life is about. Rongcai calls this the 'ding-dong' philosophy. But in my own words, it would be the 'living law of the oscillating pendulum'. We all know that when a pendulum is set in oscillation, it moves from one end of a certain direction to the very end of the opposite and repeats the sequence with less and less momentum so that it eventually stops in the middle. This theory very much applies to many areas in life. When life begins, we are like pendulums set into an oscillating motion. In life, we seek a perfect life by 'swinging' to different extremes. And each time we try an idea and realise that it fails, we move closer to the perfect life or knowledge. It is simply learning through experience.   Remember Russia? Russian peasant oppression was terrible during the time of Tsarist and&nbsp;aristocratic ruling. People sought to change this. Russians for the people like Lenin lead the Russians in 'swinging' to socialism. And for many years, Russia was under socialist rule. People saw that this ideology for the society was not working and they led yet again another revolt to realise a better Russia, the deocratic Russia we see today. Of course, it is not yet perfect. In fact, not all moving pendulums eventually stops. We need forces like gravity to slow down and stop the pendulum eventually. And in life and culture, this is God's hand.   Yes, as I was saying, I've thought alot more about my future this year. I had to anyway. And here's the news. I would very likely be moving on to the States for my tertiary education next year. It would be New York or Ohio I guess. Of course, things might not go as planned, but this is what is planned. But at the same time, it doesn't mean what I say now doesn't count. You get the point.   To enter an American college, I really need to do well for my SAT I. The problem is not my mathematics, but really the verbal section. So I'd be trying to widen my vocabulary. Strangely, I've been having this interest in Chinese. Sometimes, I feel like it is a calling to Chinese ministry in the future. It seems like a hint, and encouraging me to start preparing now. So, not much time, many subjects, SAT I and an interest in Chinese. Some other things have to go really. But come to think about it, there's not much of anything else to rid except 'nothing'. I meant idleness. Oh, that'll be an easy yet hard task. No more procrastination, that's hard. But actually and factually, I just have to keep myself occupied.    &nbsp;   I'm ready to fly    I'm ready to soar    I'm ready to leave this world behind    I'm ready to open up the door    I'm ready to fly    I'm ready to spread my wings    Across the sky    &nbsp; There is something in the future for me. It seems like I've gotten it all sorted out. I see my future. But is it really an oasis in this life of mine? Or is it just a mirage? Will I&nbsp;find something different when I'm there?
