						   In August 2001 for about a one month period my family experienced what we believe may be a personal ascension breakthrough.  My husband and I are fairly normal, American suburban parents of two daughters (now teens).  We were using alternative medicine to control and eliminate our allergies when we discovered we could also use this method to eliminate emotional problems.  (The allergy elimination technique is called "Nambudripad's Allergy Elimination Technique (aka NAET)" and we had begun using it because traditional allergy immunization therapy suddenly made us worse).    After identifying particular emotions and items to be eliminated via physical body resistance testing, we suddenly started to have a form of "telepathic communication" and could confirm the contents of the communication with a pendulum.  All 4 of us in our family experienced this for about a month until close to 9/11/01.  This "telepathic communication" as confirmed by a pendulum, using "yes or no" answers, developed into my conservative, cynical husband starting to identify and eliminate fears for others and helping them to also gain communication like we were experiencing.  In total, 18 people had this experience.    We received communication that all these people (us included) had ascended to a spiritual vibration of 9.0.  At this vibration, communication with higher self and guides is possible (via pendulum confirmation) and humans are capable of spiritual gifts.  I began to teach and write down the gifts and how to "co-create" them with spirit for all those reaching 9.0.  (I hope to post these gifts on blog later).    My husband, myself and daughters could not believe we we had these gifts or the daily communication that was occurring "in our heads."  But we did experience the manifestation of co-creating "successful outcomes, relationship healings, and time compression."   My husband, who had never been flaky, was doing some pretty flaky stuff and we felt driven and passionate.  One week before 9/11/01, our intense directive communication began to fade and become confused.  Since then we still have pendulum confimation communication (which we did not have prior to August 2001), but the intense knowing type of communication is gone.  My husband has not "connnected" anyone else to their higher selves because he feels he needs that intense connection/communication himself to do it.  I still have "successful outcome" co-creation abilities and my daughter can co-create "time compression."  We are wondering what really happened in August 2001 and are unsatisfied until we can be in that state of connection again.  We do not know if there is anything we can do or should do to attain that state and work again.  We continue to follow any confirmation of direction we receive on the pendulum, but would welcome any input from others about this experience.  twotwelves (as in 1212)
