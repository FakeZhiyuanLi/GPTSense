      There's a place off Ocean Avenue, were I use to sit and talk with you We were both 16 and it felt so right, sleepin' all day stayin' up all night Stayin' up all night  There's a place on the corner of Cherry Street Where we'd walk on the beach in our bare feet We were both 18 and it felt so right Sleepin' all day, stayin' up all night Stayin' up all night  If I could find you now things would get better We could leave this town and run forever Let your waves crash down on me and take me away  There's a peice of you that's here with me It's everywhere I go, it's everything I see When I sleep I dream and it gets me by And I can make believe that you'r here tonight That you'r here tonight  If I could find you now things would get better We could leave this town and run forever Let your waves crash down on me and take me away  I remember the look in your eye When I told you that this was good-bye You were begging me not night not here not now  If I could find you now things would get better We could leave this town and run forever Let your waves crash down on me and take me away  There's a peice of you that's here with me It's everywhere I go it's everything I see When I sleep I dream and it gets me by And I can make believe that your here tonight That your here tonight

      since my whole family is really retarted it would be no suprise that my brother is a freak. i was pretending to be sick so i could stay home from skool because thats what i do and so im lying there watching maury and like its one of the ones when opposites attract and this lke nasty, wrinkly droopy old 75 yr old grndma comes out on stage dressed in lke skimpy underwear and my three yr old brother sais: wow, she is pretty i want her to take her clothes of so i can see her boobies!  i almost shit my pants that is sooooooooo gross. (though he carries around a picture of liv tyler on a giant ticket and sais he is going to date and marry her. he said he had a dream about her. LAST NIGHT!)

      OK. so sometimes i watch buffy re-runs on sundays because i have no lyfe and my mom wont take me anywhere because she is tired of driving but oh! she doesnt drive. and i just found out that tara wasnt always retarted and willow is a lesbian. AND buffy is a necrophiliac because she screws dead guys!  examples: Angel and the hotter Spike but then you can say that angel and spike are not really dead there more like undead, so then its not a big deal and shes not a sick pervert and shes not a necrophiliac. but they are dead. so...she is

      Re-creating the breath of a T. rex for a huge model dinosaur in London’s Natural History Museum posed challenges all of their own.  “We spoke to paleontologists, who gave us a description of the dinosaur. Basically, the bigger the creature, the smellier they were,” said Knight, who is passionate about accuracy. “The dinosaurs would have had open sores from fighting, and rotting meat stuck in the gaps between their teeth. We needed all these features in the eventual odor.”  The T. rex breath turned out to be so revolting that the curators instead opted for a milder swamp smell to evoke the creature’s natural habitat.
