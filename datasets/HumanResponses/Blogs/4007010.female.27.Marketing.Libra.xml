       the lights are shaded just right to make you look better than you actually are, to disguise the fact that you're putting on shitloads of foundation gunk onto your cheeks. "blend" they always say "blend it well in, there you go". i, girl with no makeup on, girl who looks pretty in these mirrors despite that, smile at the sales representative who looks at me in what i can only imagine to be jealousy. she's wearing one of those stupid black suit-type things these stores always make you wear, like you're a fuckin businesswoman or something when in reality you're making minimum wage pumpin' out the customer service pimpin' out the lame products and there i am, basking in my sexy loose-fitting clothes, free as a schoolgirl, wearing my pseudo-schoolgirl outfit with the plaid skirt (that doesn't look lame like most plaid skirts that put an emphasis on the plaid, whereas mine put an emphasis on da sexy) and my tight white collar top that is buttoned so tightly my boobs will pop out any second. i look at lipliners because that's all i would ever buy at places like this. lip liners and eyeliners and silly shit like that cuz these places are stupid expensive and totally not worth it when it comes to things like i dunno, anti-wrinkle anti-cellulite anti-everything "creme". "those are on sale" she informs me. i refuse to make eye contact and move on. i find this lip balm stuff my friend has and this stuff is out of the world. it's the only lip balm in the entire world you can actually eat if so desired, and it doesn't leave a nasty feeling in the back of your throat like most gunk-awful lip balms. i place it casually on the counter. "that's five seventy five" she mutters, ringing up the order, now also refusing eye contact.  that's it? i smile knowing perfectly well everything else in the store is at least twenty bucks more. i grab the pink plastic bag and the lip balm jostles around cuz it's so tiny. overpriced lip balm, i think. i walk out casually swinging it by my hip and smile at a bunch of men in actual business suits walking by, eyeing me. she tries to burn a hole in the back of my head with her glare. i don't feel it.

      the one thing i dislike about giving head.  we were interrupted by his friend, who guessed at it, who i couldn't stop giggling around, who took a picture of me where i looked fat, who i took a picture of and man.. is he ever photogenic (what black man isn't?). i still love my boy more. but my desire to give head with flavored-lube has been left unfulfilled, and i'm still hungry.
