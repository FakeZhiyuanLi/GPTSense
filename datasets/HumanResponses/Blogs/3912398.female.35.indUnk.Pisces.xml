      We sleep for 1/3 of our lives.&nbsp; Or so say the experts.&nbsp; Yet most of us spend&nbsp;a lot of time&nbsp;walking around sleep deprived. &nbsp; Bears eat an outrageous amount of food then hibernate for months at a time.&nbsp; Even giving birth to their young'ins, completely oblivious to the munchkin's arrival.&nbsp; Must be nice.&nbsp; To sleep for months that is.&nbsp; But if they, too, are sleeping 1/3 of their lives, would that mean that a  short  4 month nap allows them to&nbsp;stay awake for the other 8 months of the year?&nbsp; I dunno. &nbsp; Infants sleep around 20 hours a day.&nbsp; They are really throwing the curve off for us, as they spend over 80% of their day asleep.&nbsp; As do their much older generation...senior citizens.&nbsp; They are habitual nappers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They seem to always get their full 8 hours of recommended sleep each night, after having had several naps during the day. &nbsp; Something happens to us around the end of puberty.&nbsp; We begin a habit, one that stays with us for most of our lives. &nbsp; First, it's that extra bit of independence gained with each passing birthday.&nbsp; "I'll sleep later" is a phrase heard by many younger people.&nbsp; Sleep is lost when Exam time comes.&nbsp; Which is made only more elusive by that "REALLY GREAT PARTY!"&nbsp; But it doesn't get any easier when our schooling ends.&nbsp; We are now hard-working, income-earning adults who need that stress release at the end of the week. &nbsp; Eventually we find that someone special.&nbsp; We are finally spending more time in bed, but usually NOT to sleep.&nbsp; After endless days and nights in bed, (only getting out to eat or pee), we learn we are expecting an "addition" to our twosome. &nbsp; We spend countless hours  day   and night  hovering over the toilet, because "Morning Sickness" is a misnomer, afterall.&nbsp; Dad-to-be is also short on sleep as he is out running to all-night convienence stores, drive-thru's and pharmacies.&nbsp; We spend the last days of our pregnancy unable to get comfortable...thinking of all we still have to do...and wishing our "bundle of joy" would hurry up and get here. &nbsp; Once we bring Junior home, we think we will finally be able to sleep, since Junior is expected to sleep at least 20 hours each day.&nbsp; But again we are fooled, as we find sleeping more than 30 minutes at a time, nearly impossible. &nbsp; This eases with time, but just about when we start to sleep more regularly, Junior gets sick and we find ourselves in the ER all night long...followed by days of tending to his every whim as if he were an infant again.&nbsp; A 3 hour nap feels like a piece of heaven.&nbsp; It will be years before we are able to sleep "normally." &nbsp; Time passes much too quickly and before you know it, Junior is a teenager with enough hormones to fill a football stadium.&nbsp; You both spend hours awake each night, waiting for him to come home.&nbsp; Wishing he'd call.&nbsp; Constantly&nbsp;worried&nbsp;for and about him.&nbsp; It doesn't end when he moves out. &nbsp; You find your empty nest much too quiet now.&nbsp; You're exhausted from boredom and need to take a nap.&nbsp; Just a small one, though.&nbsp; But as each birthday passes, you find that 8 hours of sleep at night just isn't enough and you are now taking longer and more frequent naps. &nbsp; It's unfair.&nbsp; Sleep is wasted on the young and old.&nbsp; When you were getting lots of it, you didn't know to appreciate it, and now you're forced to wait to get any. &nbsp; Tick. Tock. &nbsp; Tick. Tock. &nbsp; Tick. Tock.

      It's amazing the crap your mind comes up with when you're tired.  Or maybe, it's just weird, scary and obscure.    Today, I'm sitting here zoning out, when I notice the tag on my sport bra.    95% cotton, 5% lycra/spandex.    And I think, what is lycra/spandex?  And how did it get mixed up with a good ole boy like cotton?  How do they combine the two?  And are they sure it's exactly 95/5?  What if the spandex snuck in a little extra of itself and is really 10%?  Is it mixed up really well or is the part that covers my tits more cotton, while the spandex is digging into my shoulder blades?  Which led to this odd bit of mental activity: Who wears a sports bra?  Do you have to be playing sports to wear one or is this a fashion faux pas?  And does it matter what your age is, or size might be?  Should some people JUST NOT wear sports bras, like some people should stay away from thongs?   I'll be the first to admit...I'm not a young girl and after 3 kids, I don't exactly have itty bitty tittys, but it's comfortable; most of the time.  It keeps me from flopping around like an overturned Jell-O mold on a plate that is being held sideways.  And while I don't like wearing bras most of the time, this is a compromise for those who might be offended or bothered with my bra-less attitude.   Hmmmm....I dunno.  I like my sports bra, and like the way my thongs make me feel.  But rest assured...I won't be flashing either out in public.

      My name is Suzette.  I'll be the host of this journey.  Right now I'm suffering from "Thumperismitis", or as most of you know it from the movie "Bambi,"  "...if you can't say somethin nice, don't say nuttin at all."  And those of you who have read my first attempt at blogging, know 98% of it was negative or just plain depressing.  I'm feeling that way right now, but am fighting the urge to VENT to those who don't want to have to hear my whining.  I hope this blog will be different.  I hope this blog will be fun.  I hope this blog doesn't bore you to death.  Today, right this very minute, it is NOW Tuesday, July 13th, 2004.  Happy Birthday LeeAnn!  How many of you can remember the LiveAid Concert, held in 3 countries, simultaneously 19 years ago today?  (yes, you really are getting old, if you can!)  My niece was born that day as her mother, my older sister, watched LiveAid on her TV in the maternity ward.  I wasn't there; didn't even know about LeeAnn. (Long story for another day.)  But I heard about her birth a few weeks later.  And being a young 16 year old teenager, myself, I obviously wasn't there for LiveAid either, but I did watch a good amount of it, although I can't remember much today.   LiveAid was the culmination of years of public outcry to do something for the famished peoples of Africa, as I remember it.  It seemed everyone was on that bandwagon.  But here we are, 19 years later, and does anyone know if any of it helped long-term, or was it a simple "BandAid" (pun, intended) that made us feel better about ourselves?  Are they any better today than 20 years ago?  "Do they know it's Christmastime", yet?  I dunno.  And for that matter, are we any better than we were 20 years ago?  Maybe, maybe not.  But we did escape the 80's alive, didn't we?  Whew!

      "W"?  WTF???  I saw   urlLink it  . I was intrigued by   urlLink it  . I clicked on   urlLink it  .  The Google Sponsored Link simply stated, "Support W: America's Ketchup"  Are they serious?  You decide. And let me know.

      Today was a wasted day. To end a wasted week and a half.  Not by choice, 'cuz God knows I had tons to do. But because my now week-long cold took a turn for the worse, by way of a strength-raveging fever that literally knocked me down and out. Don't know where it came from or why, but I went thru the worst hot/cold flashes I've had in a LONG time. Then as quickly as it appeared, it disappeared, but not before stealing what little energy I had.  I had big plans. Trips to Hurricane Harbor and Six Flags. Maybe the Zoo. Definately lots of swimming and outside play. But getting sick put an end to all that. Instead of a week filled with fun and enjoyment, it's been a week of trips to the store for more medicine, tissues, feminine products, soup and juice. My trash cans overflow with tissue, needing to be emptied frequently, and now we all have the " Rudolph " look and feel. I need a maid to come take care of my neglected house, but until I win the lottery, I'll try to do my best to keep it as clean as possible.  This all sucks because today was also Lil' Miss's last day of summer vacation. 1st grade is only hours away and her new uniforms were still lying next to the washing machine at dinner time. Luckily, I bought lunch stuff earlier in the week and washed her backpack on Firday (it's still hanging upside down in the hallway).  I barely had enough strength to heat up some hotdogs (for the second night in a row) and give her a bath before crashing on the couch again while trying to catch some of the Olympics. I just hope I feel well enough come Tuesday......   because I gotta go back to work. *sigh*

      It took me a LONG LONG time to get up the nerve to start a blog.  I'd read up on them and was pretty familiar with their growing popularity, but it wasn't until a couple friends of mine signed up at blogger, did I decide to make the leap.   It was really tough at first....I love to talk nonsense and such but starting something worth reading (to me at least) was quite challenging.  And it always seemed I'd be at a loss for topics, until something upset me, then my fingers went to pecking away.  Before I knew it, I'd released my frustrations and felt tons better, but it was  not  an enjoyable blog to read.  It   was   a great way to let out the crap building inside me and in some small way, I believe, let me cope without my anti-depressants.  But something's gotta give.  I got tired of being such a bore and definate downer to those who read my blog, so I stopped writing...online, at least.   Recently, I decided to give it another try...determined not to complain with every word written.  Unfortunately, that's like going on a crash diet; you avoid the junk for as long as your will power allows, then you snap!  Next thing you know, you're cramming twinkies, doritos and snicker bars into your mouth as fast as you can chew.  Or in my case, you're filled with so much negativity and rage, you want to strangle the next person you see.  Just not healthy, ya know?  I took a breather...posted a new entry on the old blog, then took some time to collect my thoughts.  Now after a short hiatus, I'm back.  I could spend all day writing stupid essays on here, as my mind is so often filled with insane  thoughts (see earlier post on sports bras).  I have even tried keeping a note pad for the random crap that pops into my head, so that I always have "material" to work with.   If only I could find it amongst the pile of junk stacked on my desk.

       urlLink     Lil' Miss @ 5 1/2 months young   urlLink        My baby girl is growing up. *sigh* At the ripe old age of 6, Lil' Miss never ceases to amaze me.  She's been gone visiting grandma & pa for almost the entire summer. I've missed her like crazy, but she was having so much fun, we allowed her to stay a month longer than we had planned to. I waited by the phone on Thursday evenings, knowing this was when she'd call. Hoping to get a glimpse into her world. Wishing I was there to see her explore the mountains of Arkansas, discovering lots of new things.  For almost 4 weeks, she had a "pet" lizard, who wasn't afraid of her, and who freely wandered the house. When grandma noticed he wasn't looking well, she convinced Lil' Miss to "send him to visit his other lizard friends." She took him outside and set him on the side of a tree. He just stood there. Thinking he didn't see any friends, she picked him up and took him to another tree. Again, he just stood there. Not to be deterred that easily and wanting to help him, she gently picks him up again and tries a third tree. As soon as his little feet touched the bark, he  BOLTS  , causing Lil' Miss to bust into tears. She didn't even get to say goodbye to her friend.  She also had a couple of tadpoles who, as I was informed, would grow into frogs! Pa and her found them when they went fishing with her new Spider-Man fishing pole: a gift daddy had bought her the first day of summer. I was told they'd be coming home with her, but sadly, one day they were gone. Not sure if Pa used them for bait or if they died in the small jar she left out in the summer sun.  When she was tested late last school year, we were informed that she only ranked 48 out of 100, for kids her age and grade, in reading comprehension. Not bad, but not as high as we'd like, so we got tough on making sure she practiced more. We sent a TON of study material for her to work on a little each day while at Grandma's, although we cautioned grandma not to force-feed it to her and let her work at her own pace. She worked hard the first few weeks, then slacked off, and I was kind of concerned since she would have less than 2 weeks before school started by the time she came home. Her first day home, she's sitting on my lap, "Cat in the Hat" book in hand, and asks me to read it to her. I begin reading, but still have a cigarette in my other hand, so I pause to put it out. Without skipping a beat, Lil' Miss starts reading where I stopped!!! Not just sounding out the words, but actually reading them! Thinking she has simply memorized the book, I turn ahead a few pages and ask her to continue reading, and again, she starts reading! My mouth drops and Grandma and Pa look over at me and smile. "Hasn't she gotten so good at reading?"  "YEAH!  Oh My Goodness!!!" "She's been reading the booklets you sent over and over all summer long." She has progressed to a point I wasn't expecting until well after Christmastime; she is actually recognizing words and not having to sound out each word. Lil' Miss beams with pride and finishes the book.  Yesterday, while daddy is getting ready to go to work, Lil' Miss lets out a blood-curdling scream!  "MOM! MOM! MOM!"  We both jump and and nearly knock each other over trying to get to her. She comes running down the hall, bouncing into the room with the biggest smile on her face and her finger in her mouth,  "MY TOOTH IS LOOSE!"  She has been waiting for this moment for well over a year! At times, she'd break down and cry, "I'm never gonna lose a tooth!", after another classmate had lost a tooth. This is a BIG milestone for us all....her  FIRST  loose tooth. I just can't put into words what all this means.  *note to self....pull out babybook and write this down!  On Tuesday, we watched ABC's Extreme Makeover Home Edition, where Ty and his team were making over a house whose oldest son had become paralyzed in a car accident a couple years ago. They added a therapeutic pool in the backyard, an elevator to take him to all 3 floors of the house, and a ton of other awesome things, as usual. And as usual, at the end of the show, I was in tears of joy for this family and the incredible feat perfomed by the show. Lil' Miss looks over at me and says, "Why do you look so sad?" (Yeah, I cry at the drop of a hat, but she still asks me this after every show.) I explain why and she smiles and gives me a hug.  Then on Wednesday evening, out of nowhere, she asks me, "Remember that show we watched yesterday, where they put the pool in the backyard for the guy in the wheelchair?" "Yes, why?" "Well........ummm.......how does he get into the pool?" My eyes just freeze on her, as I realize how much thinking it took her to get to that question, and I just smile a BIG smile. "That's a  GREAT  question, huney, and I wondered that myself when watching the show." I then explain that towards the end of the show, I saw the answer....a seat attached to the arm of a crane that was attached to the side of the pool. "OK, but how does he get into the chair?" I proceed to explain this, using a couple of different chairs near the window. "Is that how he gets into bed, too?" "Basically, yes." "Why does he need a pool?" I explain how he can't use any part of his body from his chest down and that his arms are kinda like his legs now, in that he must use them to roll the wheelchair EVERYWHERE, and they need to be strong, but that they also getting very tired and need to relax.  WOW!  What a lot of new information for her little mind to absorb. You can see the wheels turning in her head and suddenly she just smiles and says, "Oh, OK!!!" And then drops the entire subject as she turns back to watch Cartoon Network.  My heart fills with enormous pride and I can't stop smiling.    Dear Guardian Angels, Please let me keep my little girl just a while longer. I know her teenage years aren't far off, but let her stay 47 pounds and 48 1/4" tall for a bit. Keep away the training bras and maxi-pads, and let her dolls and hot-wheels be enough excitement for now. Save her innocence as long as you can and protect her from anyone who would break her heart. Keep her safe and spare her mental health. She is, afterall, my little girl. Thank You, Lil' Miss' mom

      I've been out of work...real work, with regular paychecks and  health insurance .... for a long time now. It hasn't been easy, but it hasn't been totally unbearable. Yeah, I have my good days and my "Oh F*ck, what are we gonna do now?" days, but most of my days are ok. No matter how much I complain.  The past few days have been teetering on the bad. I caught a cold; no...... a  SUMMER  cold, which in my opinion is much worse in so many ways than a winter cold. I have my suspicions as to where I picked it up, but it wasn't her fault....it was ALL mine. Sometimes it's hard NOT to share your drink with a thirsty 18 month old. LOL! Just wish I'd realized at the time she was sick.  It started out as a lot of sneezing and watery, itchy eyes, but grew VERY quickly into something I can only describe as "Sinuses on FIRE". My throat began to hurt like hell and I wished I didn't feel so bad, so I could run to the store for some medicine. By the next morning, I had no choice but to run to Wal-Greens. Thank God the parking lot was empty when my coughing fit hit and I ended up throwing next to my car! (One of the wonderful prices we pay for being a smoker.) Thinking it was just bad allergies, I rummaged thru the HUGE selection of allergy meds, trying to find one that fit me, without going overboard or needing a second medicine to help me. AH-HA! I found the pretty yellow box and grabbed a box of tissues and went back home to bed.  I loaded up on fluids, trying to stay away from my addictions of Diet Coke and cigarettes, but by the end of the night, I knew this was not going away that easily.  I felt feverish, yet found no fever with my new thermometer.  I was wearing sweats and socks.....VERY unusual for me, especially in August... followed by wild bouts of ripping almost everything off!  By Tuesday, I was sure I was gonna be headed to the ER because this felt like bronchitits and/or pneumonia.  If only I could sleep.  That night, I slept like a baby, and woke up almost feeling normal.  At least for a few hours.   The past week has been a bitch.  I look like freaking  Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer !  My eyes are sore, my ears are plugged up, and if I don't stop coughing soon, I'm afraid my body will explode.   But alas, I am slowly getting better.  However, now my daughter and boyfriend are both sick, so we'll probably pass this around a couple times.   Thank God for bleach and Lysol........and LOTS of Kleenex!

      How is it possible to be both worn out and revved up at the same time? By the same thing, none the less?  I got an interesting voice message from my ex yesterday.  Yet when I called him back, he put my youngest son on the phone and told him he'd talk to me "later". Today   was   later. Now obviously my hands were sweating and my blood pressure was racing, because usually when he wants to "talk", I end up in knots and tears; a mess for days on end. I never know what to expect.  What did I do   NOW  ? Could this have anything to do with his wife being in Mississippi  alone  for the first time  EVER ? What did trouble did my boys get into this time? Who died?  I used to love talking to my ex for hours at a time. It was one of the biggest assets in our marriage when we were newly married. And even though our divorce wasn't all roses, I still liked talking to him after he was re-married. Afterall, he had been my closet friend for so long and I felt blind trust in him.  But life changes and so did we. I had found a new love to talk to and share my thoughts with. And with time, my conversations with my ex became more and more "resented" by his new wife. How could I make her undestand  I didn't want him anymore  and that  too much had happened for me to EVER want him again ? Now that's not to say I don't still wonder about what life would be like if we had not gone thru the big "D" and how much I still love the man he   USED   to be. Or should I say, the man I   thought  he was . But who he's become now, is a man I trust no further than I can throw him; a man who still makes me nervous and anxious, but never in a good way anymore.  I find his "  Jeckyll and Hyde mixed with Godfather"   demeanor to be very unnerving. Much like the father he claims raised him. Yet, he doesn't see himself as that. He thinks he is all about integrity, honesty, dignity and loyalty, but actions speak  louder  than words. Ya know?  So we spent well over an hour just talking today. And somewhere I found the strength to say things I've held inside for way too long, to not cower to his overpowering attitude towards me and I managed to only cry once, but not because of anything he said. It felt  GREAT ! We were both calm and open to saying what needed to be said without saying everything we wanted, knowing it would just start a fight and end up accomplishing nothing. We talked about the boys. We talked about work and everyone's health. We talked about our sex life...or lack thereof....at the end of our marriage. And he was shocked to hear that my boyfriend was standing right beside me as all of this was said. ("I hide  NOTHING  from Glenn," I told him.)  This conversation was long overdue, and went pretty well, in my opinion, but I wonder what changes will now come because of it? Will he change his tune once his wife is back in town?  Only time will tell.    Only time.
