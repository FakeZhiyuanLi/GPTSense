       So the story of "DirtyDino" continues.....      The everyday train that rides next to Dino's apartment was just approaching and Dino knew it was time for him to pick up the pace in his step or he'd be forced to wait for the train to pass, before he could pass out himself.  He started running but tripped on a crack in the street and tumbled to the ground.  By the time he could wipe off his already dirty clothes, the train had arrived and Dino could not pass.  "Donkey Dick fuckin' cake ass!" he said to himself in anger that he tripped and now must wait.  He soon remembered he had half a joint left from lunch and felt in his pockets to find it.  "Holla at a nigga!" he said as he felt it in his butt pocket.  It seemed to be about an inch left, but he'd smoke it.  He'd smoke just about anything that would take his mind off reality.  Now Dino was a real bitch baby when it came to smoking up, two or three good hits and he was lit light a light bulb.  Soon after a few puffs, the joint was gone and Dino was feeling at ease.  The train seemed to slow down and Dino knew the stuff was working.  A stupid looking smile formed on his face as he stared at the train passing, that's when the wierd shit usually started appearing.  It wasn't a train anymore, as Dino found himself looking at a giant hot dog with buns for wheels.  The smoke pouring from the train turned into green relish, and sticking out the would be windows, were ketchup bottles, all dancing.  Suddenly, each bottle top popped off and showered Dino with it's red, green, and even purple mustard.  Out of nowhere Dino pulled out an umbrella and tried protecting himself from the ketchup rain.  Now to the naked eye of the bystander, all they saw was Dino moving around like he was in La La Land.  In Dino's mind the hot dog was coming to an end and it would pass him by and he'd then be able to go home, still hungry.  So as the giant hot dog passed by Dino saw what his apartment appeared to be.  The front grass was green jello, and his house was a giant chocolate chip cookie.  He started running and dove into the jello, hitting the ground hard, and not knowing why.  "Jeeze Louise, this is some hard dick jello" he thought but kept grabbing at it and eating it.  He was really ripping the dead grass from the ground and shoving it down his throat.  The jello wasn't so appealing he thought, so he ran to the giant cookie and started to rip away at it and eat, but it was really brick that was ripping his hands apart.  "Honkey fuck fart, why is this shit so hard he thought, but kept trying.      So this was my second attempt at this story.  Leave a comment, I can't even think I'm so tired.  Peace nigga

       This is my sorry ass attempt at writing a story, if it sucks, brush it off and forget about it, but if it's sweet and you want me to write more, leave a comment.      Dino walks up to the bar and stops, looks at it and thought to himself, "Keep walking or have a drink?".  It was a hot night, and he had a long walk ahead of him if he wanted to make it home for some love.  Well at least thats what he wanted it to be.  As usual, Dino would walk home from work, all 10 miles of it, since his car broke down and he hadn't had a bike and he would make it to the front door of his two room apartment, fall in passed out until he woke up in the middle of the night from some old bum walking the streets singing to himself cos he was wasted, and then he would make his way to his couch and pass out there some more.  So as he looked at the bar, eyes heavy, clothes smelling, and shortness of breath, he said to himself, "why not?"  Making his way to the front door, a group of youngsters in their mid 20's came out, some with bitches, some with beers, and the rest just trying to get the fuck out and on to the next bar.  On their way out they saw Dino, and none could hold back from saying shit.  "Jesus Christ take a bath little shit ass" one yelled, and from another, "Check out the baby dick", a few laughs and some more comments came Dino's way but he just said "Piss off you honkey muther fuckers!" and kept walking towards the bar.  Just as he was about to open the door, the door was kicked shut by one of the guys who just left.  "What'd ya say Grampa Munster?" the young man said as Dino turned to face the hooligan.  The kid was about 6'3 and he definitly lifted weights.  Dino stood there looking at him as more of the guys came back to see what Dino had said.  He thought to himself, 'oh shit, think of something that won't make me get my ass kicked'.  "I said" he said with a shaky voice, now surrounded by 5 dudes, all bigger than he, with the smell of beer on their breath.  "I said" again out of Dino's mouth.  "Come on old timer, before I skull fuck you and piss in your ears!"the big one up front said as he smacked a fist into the other hand, like a baseball played does to his mitt.  "I said, alright guys, I'll take a bath and wash my baby dick" Dino said and hoped to God that they would let him be.  A roar of laughter broke out among the group and the bitches they were with were laughing too, which made Dino mad, but when they started looking down at his manhood and making hand guestures to it only being an incher at the most he turned quickly and headed in for a drink.  The group then cleared and Dino sighed quickly.  He took a seat at the bar and simoultaneously the people around him found new seats.  Maybe he should just get a Busch and take a seat in the corner, he thought, letting himself be alone as usuall.  He found a seat in the back right next to the loud juke-box, and drank his beer slowly.  Not because it was nice and cold but because it was Busch, and no one drinks that shit cos it's horrible, but that's all he could afford.  So after he finished his beer he made his way back out and continued his journey home.  Even though the beer was shit, it was cold and that cooled him down, for it was still a hot night.  On his way home Dino liked to think of what it would be like if he had money, enough money to move out of his shithole appartment and into some nice mansion, with naked bitches all around answering his every need.  And he would have a staff of workers to do things for him, like cook and clean, ya know the kind of jobs bitches do.  And he started imaginging the bitches that were with the guys who were making fun of him, and he thought of what they would look like naked too, and wrestling with eachother to then stop wrestling and start making out and doing cool shit like touching eachother.  He liked what he thought and the smile on his faced dropped when he realized he was home, and he didn't have money, or bitches, or cooks and cleaners, but only a shit appartment and the clothes he wore to work everyday.        So this was the first part of my story, feel free to leave comments and if you'd like to give me ideas of what could happen next, feel free.      *Update*   The apartment, which will soon have a new name once I find out the address, is coming along.  The bedrooms have been picked and painted.  Kev decided to go with what I like to think is a Midevil time maroonish red, but it's sweet.  By the way, don't listen to what Kev says, Lindsay did all the work.  Josh, the "3 month man", went with Oompa Loompa Orange, and Joe, after building a wall and door for privacy, has painted over the wood-like panneling and went with Ninja Turtle Green.  The boys desparetly need a shop-vac to clean that place out cos it's dirty.  Anyway, there's a party there on Sept. 4, so BYOB and chicks too.  I hear Full Treble Stereo is gonna be playing the party too so you wont wanna miss them.      My franchise team in Madden 2005 is 14-1 with my only defeat coming from the hands of my gf laura.  Still cant believe I lost to her, but hey, can you even get your bitch to play you?  I didn't think so.  So alright, I'm outta here, gonna have some beers hopefully later and then going to the Warped Tour tomorrow, tho Simple Plan won't be playing and they were the reason why I got tickets.  Oh well, I'll get ripped in the parking lot before and suffer the rest of the day.  Peace out honkies, and leave a comment.  Holla.

       Yes, it's true, I am sexy.  Though that has nothing to do what what I'm about to write, I wanted it running through your mind that you're reading about a sexy guy.  (If you're a guy, don't get turned on, that's sick)   So with that out of the way, I finally purchased PS2, which I'm so pumped about cos I've had PS1 and Super Nintendo to keep me occupied for years now and they are shit.  Yes I know PS 2 came out forever ago, and I'm just getting it now and I sound like a little fuckin fag kid on Christmas, but it's sweet and I'm excited.  If you think that's fucked up, listen to the lyrics of "Lucy In the Sky with Diamonds" by the Beatles, they were lit up on something when they wrote that.  But anyway, so of course the first game I bought was Madden 2005, collectors edition.  It's fuckin killer.  So I play it everyday cos I'm doing a franchise and I play against Laura, and the other day she beat me.  I was fuckin pissed, she has a pretty good idea of what's going on but she says she doesnt understand it.  She kills my defense with her passing, and it seems that all the passes are completed, which is odd cos it's not like that for me.  The only good things about playing her is that she doesn't like running the ball, and she throws it to the X and R1 recievers only for some reason so if you can guess when the TE or RB are going, you can have those guys covered.  So she fuckin rubs it in real good that she beat me, which annoys the hell out of me, but oh well, what am I gonna do?  Hit her?  Nah, not like that, I'll just kick her ass next game and remind her who's boss.  So that I did, 63-3, and then like 28-7 or something.  Yeah, she says she let me win so I don't complain but I don't think so, I kicked her fuckin ass.  Both games Travis Henry had over 200 rushing.   In other pointless news, I havent had any alcohol in what appears to be over a week or two.  WTF! you say?  Well relax, that streak won't last long for tonight I shall be attending and "21 bday party" at Mickey Rats beach club, and seeing how I don't have to work tomorrow, or get up early, I'll be getting completely ripped, and all I plan on doing tomorrow is sleeping in, chilling, playing Madden, and hopefully watching some pre-season games with a cold brewski.     Seriously, it's about fuckin time for football season to kick up, I've been waiting ever since the gay Super Bowl with the Fagthers and Fagriots.  Can't stand either team so you know how much of an exciting game that was for me, thought it wouldv'e been better had the Fagthers won, instead of Tom Gaydy's Fagriots, what a fag, love the winter hat in the summer, or for every season as he wears it.  I don't care, I'm one of those football fans who fuckin yells shit just to get shit started.  ******Ok super sweet news**********  I'm going to the game tomorrow!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Bills vs. Broncos, Broncos are going down you tiny dick butt niggers!!!! Let the tailgating begin, I'm out to raise so fuckin hell and bust some heads!  Holla!

       So Thursday was the last day of the summer program for the preschool I work at, which means Freedy Man has now graduated and will be going to kindergarden in the fall.  After working with him for almost two years, all the shit he put me through, the good times and the bad times, I can honestly say he has touched a place in my heart and I will miss him so much.  Good luck J-Rob.   Also, Thursday was the day we "one on ones" would find out if we had a job placement in the fall or not.  Ain't that something, waiting till the last day to know if you're "fired".  Well luckly enough I was given a room assingment, though not in the same room I've enjoyed working in for the past two years.  I'll be moving upstairs and will be working with little Kevon.  Now this guy is little, one point last year he was weighed in around 26lbs and don't think he has gotten any bigger.  I curl more weight than that per arm so this guy shouldn't be tough to "boss around" when needed.  I'm looking forward to working in the new room with the other teachers and some of the students like Quinn Man and Alex.  Once again, good luck J-Rob.   So we went to the fair last night, it was alright.  Gotta love going there, seeing peeps you used to be friends with back in High School, and not saying a damn word to them, or vice versa.  Once again there was an abundance of pussy guys walking around in groups like tough guys.  They aren't tough and it would be great to see them get their ass's kicked.  The ghetto bitches that wear the too tight clothes so their fat chuncks overlap their jeans makes me want to throw up on the spot.  You get the rude dick fucks that think they own the place and don't make any attempt to move out of the way so you don't bump into eachother.  The over priced food items that you can't resist always win too.     The weather here sure has been a disapointment, almost makes me wanna go to the bar and have a few.  Summer, what summer?  More like three months of April showers, and April's temps too.  I've went to the beach once this summer, and I'd like to go more so the fuckin weather better get better.   Well this lady just came in and brought us two grociery bags full of little jar baby food, needing each jar individually wrapped.  What a bitch.   The Warped Tour is this Wed. at Darien Lake and the only real reason why I got tickest was to see Simple Plan.  Well wouldn't you know, they won't be playing cos of studio time.  So now I get to go see bands I honestly could care less to see, but then again I'll be there with Laura, wasted and seeing tons of bands but at least Good Charlotte and New Found Glory will be there.  Not that I'm big fans of them, but they are big name bands so it better be good.  If the show sucks I might get so ripped that I'll pump up the crowd by getting up there and showing the guitarist how it's really done.     Alright, I'm out, nothing to say and I just wasted your time with really nothing interesting, well except for Freedy Man, good luck little nig.   later.

       Yo, so yesturday this fuck comes in the UPS store where I'm working and has this fuckin rocking chair he needs to ship out. As usual it's just me here at work and some other peeps come in right at the same time. Now I like to get the people in and out so they don't bug me, so I give this guy a rough idea of how much it's going to be to package up this chair, so I'm like,....."ok the packaging is $45.00."....and he's like yeah cool whatever. So I'm like alright and I get all his shipping info and before I know it, the guys paying $160.00 total packaging and shipping. So my first thought is haha mutha fucka, I just robbed you. Then the fun began. I try and find boxes to put his chair in. We don't have any boxes that will fit it so I have to build a box. Not a problem, done it before, but it gets to be a bitch when the box won't work with you. So I take two 36.5x18x26.5's and I put them together. I cut enough bubble wrap to layer the bottom of the box, and then I start filling it with styrafoam peanuts. So I lift this rocker in and the bottom part of the chair that moves back and forth fuckin catches onto something and fucks up the bubble wrap ripping it out from under the peanuts. Then I realize, no shit, the box I have built is still not big enough for this fucker. So I take a third 36.5x18x26.5 and connect that to the other two boxes. Now I have to make sure that the total size of the box doesn't exceed 165 inches, or else it can't be shipped, and I'm fucked. So, after a lot of swearing and getting pissed at the box, the chair, the fuck rag that brought the chair in, the stupid assholes that kept coming in, and, the phone ringing, I finally got the box filled and closed. Then, to make my heart beat faster, I didn't even know if the box would fit out the door. Remind you the box's smallest length was 40 inches, but luckly enough it fit and it was outta my fuckin sight. So when I look back to when I was laughing thinking I robbed the fucker for him paying $160.00, it ended up being me that got robbed. That lucky fuck shouldv'e paid around $100 for the packaging alone with all the boxes and materials I used to build it, not to mention a side cut for myslef. Fuck rocking chairs. But there is a cool song about rocking chairs and the lyrics go like this,...."It's hard enough being along, sittin here by the phone, waiting for my memories to come and play, it's hard enough sitting there, rocking in your rocking chair, it's all too much for me to take when you're not there." Not that the song had anything to do with my story but I like the song.      So my sweetheart gf Laura took me out to dinner last night, Red Lobster. We get there and she's like, "Oh no, I forgot my credit card back at your house!" So I tell her I'll go in and get a table, she can go and get the card. So I go in and put my name on the waiting list and I decide to go have a quick beer at the bar. So I empty my pockets and I have $3.10, so I ask the bartender who's around her early 20's, "How much for a bottle?"......."uh, I dunno, they all range differently.".........."ok, so the how about a Blue Light?"......."uh, thats....uh, $3.30 before tax.'....so right there I'm like what the fuck, did I say a 40? So then I ask, "ok, how much is a draft?"....."well, the 14 oz are $2.50 before tax."....."ok, how about how much with tax?" (my questions each time we're like, come on idiot, just tell me how much a fuckin beer is!!!)...."well I won't know unless I ring it in."....."Ok, well, I have $3.30, do you think I'll have enough after tax, for a 14 oz draft?????"....."uh let me ring it in.........yeah, it comes to $2.71." So I get the beer and I walk away thinking what a fuckin idiot, why didn's she just ring it in and tell me how much the total would be right off the start? Oh and just to let you know, I got the garlic shrimp alfredo linguini, it's fuckin good.    In the words of The Strokes, "enough is enough" i'm outta here and I'm gonna go to the Eden Corn Festival to drink a couple beers after a long week. Peace out fuckers!

       Alright so Jeremiah picked today to be the day to spit at me.  Let me give you some background on him.  He's a newly turned 5 year old who has behavior problems, and some mental retardation.  Like I said before, he can be the coolest kid but there will be times I just wanna strangle him.  So after the kids eat lunch we let them lay down until they go home.  Well Freddy Man didn't end up falling asleep.  WTF!.  So I should've knew then that he was gonna be a shithead later.  So he bugs me and bugs me and bugs me for.....yes you're right, candy, which cos he didn't rest and be quiet he didn't get any.  So then the fun starts.  We wake up the kids and have them sit in chairs until we are all ready to go out to the buses.  Well Jeremiah isn't gonna have any of that.  WTF!  So he is bugging me for candy and I'm like, "Jay, go sit down with your friends and then you will show me that you can do the right thing."  Does he do it?  No.  So then his bus is here and he starts throwing a tantrum.  WTF!  Let's just say that by the time I got his wiggling ass on the bus, he had spit on me at least 10 times and he wasn't ready to stop.  Gotta love getting spit on.  So that was that job.     Now on to UPS.  I get here and the morning peeps are like, "Whew, it's been fuckin busy and there's a lady coming in with about 10 more boxes, we're outta here."  Remind you, I work by myself.  WTF!  Luckly enough the lady came back in time while my one manager was still here so he helped out, thanks Jim.  So anyway, this was at 3pm that I got here.  There's this old fuckin lady here making copies who once tried trading me a can of Squirt, which was warm, for a cold can of pop if I had one.  As I'm typing, it's 5:20pm and she's still here!  The dumb fucker is trying to make copies onto regular 8.5x11 size paper from fuckin 9x10 and she's bitching it's A) not working, duh lady, B) too hot in the store, I got the fuckin air on 55 and I'm freezing my ass off, C) upset that I can't let her use the 11x17 size paper for the same price of two 8.5x11's.  She doesn't understand that one sheet of 11x17 is $.20, while two 8.5x11's come to $.10.  Also, the 11x17 paper costs more for us to buy than the 8.5x11.  WTF!     Cheers to the idiots on the Weather Channel.  No tornados but yeah, buckets of fuckin rain.  All day.  Can't we just get like a week of nice fuckin weather?  WTF!     Ok, so the old lady doing copies, just left, it's 5:40, remind you, she's been here since before me and I got here at 3.   So I guess that's about as much bitching as I've got for you today.  Sorry, I'll try and encounter more shit tomorrow that will piss me off so I have something to write about.   Till tomorrow, later dudes.

       So this morning the weather channel said that it was supposed to rain pretty much all day.  Nice going fuck-o's, it rained for just a little while this morning and then it was sunny and hot for the rest of the day.  I feel bad for the people that live where tornado's and shit happen.  "Today's weather is going to be hot and sunny, no chance of a tornado in your area."- the weather channel."  Bam!  The whole fuckin town is destroyed and hundreds are dead from a tornado cos the weather channel idiots didn't read their weather report the right way.     So on to more interesting things, like w  ork.  Yes, everyone's favorite word.  So maybe cos it's "terrible Tuesday" I was in a bad mood.  I don't know.  So I went to the bus circle to get the kids off the bus and Jeremiah got off with a look on his face like, "I don't wanna fuckin be here".  Hmm?  Maybe cos it's summer and your stuck  going to school?  Well, as you assumed he was somewhat difficult to work with.  For the most part of the day I was teased with comments like, "Gramma ain't goin take you to Chuck E Cheese no more", and "You ain't invited to my birthday party", though I've never gone to Chuck E. Cheese with him, and his birthday was in July.  Go figure.  Finally he settled down into his little silly ass self and wouldn't leave me alone.  Thinking he had been sweet, he'd then say, "I want candy", and I'd just want to be like, fuck no, you ain't getting shit if you keep acting like a little baby.  I'd hear "I want candy" and each time he'd say it, it would have a little more of a whine in his voice.  Now there's one thing I can't stand and that's annoying baby shit.  So I gave him the option of either "acting like a big boy" and getting candy before he leaves, or he could keep bugging me and he wont get shit.  Let's just say he ended up getting candy before he left.  Now, during the summer session, we teachers are aloud to leave after 2:05 if all of our children are on their buses and gone.  Guess what?  One of the fuckin buses broke down and we had to wait for a tow-truck to tow it away and also wait for another available bus to come pick these kids up.  Yes, you guessed it, I have kids on this bus, so instead of leaving when I'm supposed to, I had to stay untill the kids were picked up.  It's funny how my luck runs out so quickly.     So UPS is slow and boring and I have enough time to sit and write this daily diary for all you viewers.     Good luck to all those who are trying out for American Idol IV.  I have heard so far of some shitty luck of a few friends of mine that the traffic to wait in line in Cleveland is bumper to bumper and that a few people have suffered from heat stroke, or exhaustion, one of the two.  Seems that the people trying out for this have to wait in a long ass line to get a wrist band and a number before they go in to audition.  No water or food or anything cos there's no concession stands so lets just say how good everyone's voices will be when they get up there to sing their first note and can't cos they have a fuckin dry mouth.  Like I said before, good luck, you're gonna need it.   I remember watching the last American Idol, there was the good, bad, and the average auditioning.  Seriously now, why in the hell would you wanna go up there with a shit voice and audition?  Some say they feel their only hope is Paula, but what the fuck would you wanna hear what she has to say?  She's a washed up shit song writer who some how made it.  What's she doing with herself now?  She's hosting American Idol.  Why would I care what she thinks of my voice?  I wouldn't sing the shit she sang, hell I don't even like that shit.  And Randy, yo dawg!  What a dork dick.  He says the same thing to everyone.  "Yo dawg, how you feelin'?"  Which makes the singer think, "Oh goodie gumdrops, Randy is on my side", and then the fucker says, "I don't know dawg, I wasn't feeling it tonight dawg."  Now Simon, I like him.  Sure he might say things more rude that you might, but at least he's telling the truth.  I couldn't stand it when people would boo him even before he spoke.  I can say I liked him for the entire show until I think it was one of the last shows that he shows up with a button-down-the-front shirt with like the top five buttons unbuttoned.  I'm watching the show and I'm like, stick to the usuall black or white t-shirt that he always wore.  Anyway, I'm sure if I got up there I'd fuck up and they'd all ball-blast me and I'd walk away feeling dumber than when I walked in the room.  Though you never know, just ask that dumb fucker William Hung who sang Ricky Martin's  She Ban gs and now the fucker is like famous.  If you didn't see the audition, this guy was the worst singer ever and the three judges are trying not to laugh in his face cos he was so terrible.  They give him a few sarcastic compliments and he's like, "I've never had any professional training".  Duh.  Like I said, you never know.   Tell me something.  If you and two other of your buddies wanted to move out of your houses and get an apartment together, what would you say to the one who says, "I can do it for 3 months."??  I'd be like, what the fuck are u gonna do in 3 months, move back home to mommy and daddy?  Why the fuck move out in the first place?  It's either do it or don't, but 3 months, I'm a little clueless on this one.  I'll let you know what happens.   Good luck in M.........., Kev.   Alright, that's enough bitching from me, more tomorrow.  Later dudes

       Day 1 of my blogs, props to the Pazzo for getting me started on this.  Pretty much the blogs I write will consist mainly of shit about my daily routine and how much I hate it, my friends, and other random shit that comes to mind as I type away.     Who is this Ranaldi little bastard that I read about you ask yourself.  Well Let me tell you a little about myself.  Nah loc, fuck that.  Keep reading and you'll laugh so much at how shitty things are that you won't care about who I am because you'll start to feel sorry for me, and I don't want that.  So anyways, I wake up in the morning bright an early at 6:05am to get ready for my long ass day.  First, I usually eat something like a bowl of cereal, though that's not what I want.  It'd be great if I could just fuckin lay there and have bitches bring me food, feed it to me, and have other bitches rub my feet.  So back to reality, I sit down with my bowl of cereal and eat it while watching the weather channel to see if summer will ever hit us.  Let me just say that a smile on my face is rare because all of us Buffalonians know that we're having more and more "April Showers" days of summer.  Sometimes I wonder if I really live in Seatle, or over seas in Scotland or wherever the fuck it rains constantly.  So I finish my bowl of cereal and make my way to the shower that awaits me.  Gotta love when the hot water doesn't kick on right away and I step into a shower of fucking freezing water-if that doesn't wake me up, then I dont know what will.  Following my shower, I get dressed and pretty much head out the door.  I drive to my full-time job in Amherst at a preschool for the learning disabled.  The pay is shit, and I mean it.  I bet if I worked part-time at McDonalds, I'd bring home a bigger, and better, paycheck.  So I get there usually a little early and I sit in my car listening to some tunes.  Though these tunes aren't on the radio cos the radio only has stupid-ass-rimmer talk shows or they play gay ass music that is way over played.  I like the people that I work with in my class, and there are many more that work there that I can tolerate, but like most places of work, there are people that work there that I can't fuckin stand.  Just idiots.  So I work one on one with this little guy Jeremiah.  The kid is cool as hell and I cant say I'd rather work with anyone more than he.  Though there will be times that he frustrates me so that I wanna rip his arms off and beat him with them, but I don't, cos I'm a nice guy.  So J-Man, or Freddy, short for Freddy Man, are a few of his nicknames I gave him.  Can't forget J-Rob though cos he likes that one too.  Anyway, all the kids like me probably cos I seem more like another friend to them rather than a teacher, though that sucks when they don't listen and I have to yell to get my way.  So I leave there around 2pm and hit the road to then drive to my second job, cos like i said before, I don't make enough at my full-time job.  This is funny shit.  I get paid way to much to sit on my ass and pretty much do nothing, but I'm not complaining.  It was ten times cooler when Kev worked here too, cos we'd fuckin call people and prank there asses, play our guitars, and most recently, use the packing tubes to play baseball in the store.  So I leave at 7 unless I get some fuck bag that decides to come in at the last second to get his shit done.  Note to the late fucker...your shit ain't going out till tomorrow anyway!  So when I finally leave, I go home and get something to eat.  Now I'm trying to eat healthy and lose a few pounds cos lets just say I have put on some pounds I want to lose.  But hey there's never anything healthy to eat so I just eat away and start my diet another day.  By this time, my lovely girlfriend Laura comes over and we chill till I get tired and she leaves for home.  10:30 might seem early to some, but seriously by that time i am ready to pass right out and do all of the above again.
