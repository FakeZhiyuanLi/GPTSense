With one swing of the bat, Barry has inched even closer to yet another one of Ruth's records.  Bonds crushed his 35th home run of this season, 693th all-time in Sunday's game. Earlier today, he was given "National League Player of the Week" honors with higher than a 1.5 slugging average, .700 on base percentage, and hitting .600 in the time span. Truly remarkable. Tip your hats, you guys.  You are in the presence of a legend.       Okay so some updates about the   non-legandary   me.       Last Thursday Night, one of my oldest friends and his sister came over to spend the night and ended up staying all day Friday too. It was really cool, almost like ole times. Since we only see each other maybe 1-2 times a year, I really value the time I get to spend with the guy. Some funny stuff. Friday night, my grandparents came over, and my friend's parents and we all had dinner together. That also was pretty cool. After they left my dad put on this hindi movie, Lakshya. It was pretty good(at least for the part I watched). One of the songs really struck home.       Saturday, I cleaned my desk. Watched the Giants. Watched the Niners. Slept.       Sunday, we went school shopping and to the temple. I think I saw Sapna in Walmart. lol. At night, I went to my grandma's house to spend the night, and ended up meeting one of my aunties. So another little family reunion there.       Today, I spent the morning running chores for my grandma and trying to avoid my grandpa. Now it's not like I don't love him or anything, I do but sometimes I don't have the strength in me to put up with him. How my grandma does it, I have no idea.       Then around 1, I went to AHS to pick up my maze day packet. Turns out that the office doesn't open til 1:30. So I was just waiting there and I ran into Adrienne. That was cool. lol. We talked and walked a little and then we discovered that Mrs. T was in her room! So we walked in and talked with her for a while. This world needs more teachers like Mrs. T, seriously (not to say there aren't other good teachers at AHS or anything). Frankly, all my classes have had their own story, some good, some not but now that I look back at it, I have no regrets. Okay, so after we hung out at Mrs. T's, I had a ASB meeting to go to concerning primarily major club status for next year. No offense to anyone who might possibly take offense to this, but the meeting was a complete waste of time. I have no problem against major clubs, but at the same time I realize that the chess club will never become one (as a lot of people choose to make fun of during the meeting). Heck for the record, the AHS Chess Club/ Chess Team is   #1   in the Golden State of California. How's that for major?! Laugh all you want. Okay, back to point, major clubs ( or rather having incentive for clubs that do well) is a good idea but the way that it will be implented leaves a lot to be desired. If you do well in the previous year, you will get privledges the next year which you don't necessarily deserve at the time. Lets say for example your the world's best club in 2000, doesn't mean you'll continue to be that great in 2001 but now you have extra fundraising weeks, cash etc etc. I have no problem with clubs duking it out for the title. People seem to forget that this is high school, and we will be   gone   in 1-2 years.  Oh well, not my problem.       What a wonderful world...         Anyways, after the meeting, I was just hanging with people, talking. It was a moment of realization for me. While the summer was really great, today reminded me that the summer is effectively over and not to expect anything to be different. I've learned that what happens over the summer, often times is quickly forgotten once school year starts.       This is the song that I really liked from Lakshya. (the lyrics more importantly) I earlier did a full translation but the stupid server crashed so if anyone wants the full translation its on request. lol.     Main Aisa Kyun Hoon...    Why am I like this?    Main Jaisa Hoon, Main Vaisa Kyon Hoon    Karna Hai Kya Mujhko, Ye Maine Kab Hai Jana    Lagta Hai Gaoonga, Zindagi Bhar Bas Ye Gaana    Hoga Jaane Mera Ab Kya    Koi To Bataye Mujhe    Gadbad Hai Ye Sab Kya    Koi Samjhaye Mujhe    Main Aisa Kyun Hoon...    Main Jais...Kyun Hoon      Ab Mujhko Ye Hai Karna, Ab Mujhe Wo Karna Hai    Aakhir Kyon Main Na Janoon, Kya Hai Ki Jo Karna Hai    Lagta Hai Ab Jo Seedha, Kal Mujhe Lagega Ulta    Dekho Na Main Hoon Jaise, Bilkul Ulta Pulta    Badlonga Main Abhi Kya    Manoon To Kya Manoon Main    Sudhrunga Main Kabhi Kya    Ye Bhi To Na Janoon Main    Jaane Ab Mera Hona Kya    Lagta Hai Tumko Kya    Jaane Ab Mera Hona Kya Hai    Kya Main Hoon, Jaisa Bas Vaisa Rahunga    Karna Hai Kya...Main Ye Gaana    Hoga...Samjhaye Mujhe    Main Aisa Kyun Hoon...    Main Aisa Aisa Aisa Hi Hoon      Oh yeah one last thing: vow to myself. This year I will not hold back. I've waied, and I've second quessed myself for too long. This year will be different.

             In Athens,the XXVIII Olympic Games continued       again today. Michael Philips has more than just lived up to pre-Olympic expectations and even with B-14s parked in thier training facilities, the Iraqi soccer team is shocking the world.       Meanwhile, on the home front, in a surprising change of events earlier today, president-hopeful John Kerry launched a series of attacks against President Bush accusing him of hiding behing supporters whom have been trying to discredit Kerry's decorated Vietnam Service.      "He wants them to do his dirty work," proclaimed Senator Kerry.    It's only anybody's guess who's doing the senator's laundry these days.     In Hayward, California it's just another day.
