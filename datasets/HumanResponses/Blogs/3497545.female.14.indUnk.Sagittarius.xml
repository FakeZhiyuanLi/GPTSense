      I've just started my holidays and hopefully will maintain this account at least weekly :D Today was quite boring went online for 4 hours till my eyes burned. Then watched Harry potter and the Chamber of Secrets on HBO (I didn't bother to watch it in the movies, because I chose to watch LOTR instead :p). I don't think Daniel Radcliff is as good as the actor for Ron (what's his name again?). He lacks of expression and well...he looks so blur most of the time (and his face reminds me of Frodo).Hermoine was okay.  Anyway, there was alot of unanswered questions when I finished the movie such as: How the heck Hermoine could figure out the basilisk move through pipes? and how come a sword can magically appear in the sorting hat? Why did the sorting hat didn't say anything? Why can't the pheonix heal Ginny? Why didn't Tom's diary appear in the first movie and last of all, where did voldemort go? Like my friend said: "Don't bother to watch HP movies in the cinema. Just buy a RM 5 vcd at Chow Kit road and watch it in the comfort of your home:D" To all the Hp fans out there, I don't mean to offend anybody. It's just my point of view.   Tommorow I'm going to visit a friend after many phone calls (my phone bill TT_TT)You know, it''s not fair. I feel ppl are taking advantage of me. Like I'm the one that makes all the calls. They'll give excuses like their parents need the phone and things like that. During group projects also they'll say they don't have the items and I ended up bringing most of the things. If I don't, the project will never be completed. For example, when I had home science (yes, we have to learn how to sew, cook and clean up the house as well as how to make electronic parts and cut wood for god knows what reason)the teacher called us to prepare a full course lunch (with desert, appertiser, main course)I brought all the things they asked me to but the one of the members changes from cauliflower to cabbages (is the cheapest vege here!) and claimed she forgot to bring some of the other ingredients. And she ended up eating the most T_T That's the way of life I guess.

      Hahaha -____- i just got my frweaking period for this month. My mom says I'm like her, irregular. For this whole 1/2 a year, I got it 2 times and it always takes me in suprise. Why oh why do we have period!! Why can't we push a button and stop all the freaking pain and misery it cause. I had to stay up till 2am yesterday to clean up my shirt, sofa thanks to the bloody red spot. And in school the thing is always inmy mind. I'm always worrying whether or not the twel has leaked through, if I can change without anyone noticing. I notice that I'm very bad tempered nowadays. I scream my haed off when I feel frusfrated (to my pillow only, or not my father will knock my head)  Tommorow I'll have to finish a few more homeworks and I'll have to study for my PMR soon. Only 100 days left !!!
