      Well Tuesday this week, was just tuesday, boring, not that eventful, ya know, all that great stuff. I didn't except stalk DanCzar and accompany Courtney to get a hair cut, which was much fun. DanCzar had told us he would be at Fat Boys with some math buddies, so we decided to crash the party. It was great. We stayed for like 15 minutes I guess. He told me he was going to kill us, but baby I'm still alive! After that, I went home, Courtney came back around 3:45, and we hung out until we had to go to class.  Well my mom had a doctor appt and wasn't home yet, and Courtney didn't have her parking decal on her car, so that left my dads truck, which I love. Its a green ford ranger, stick shift. And I can drive stick, my dad is just afriad to let me do it without him in the truck with me lol. So I convinced him to let me take it, and off to class we went. I loved it. I drove fine, too.   So our teacher showed up this time, and we got homework, and got aquainted with our other students. We all had to say stuff about ourself, and then talk about another person in the group. I talked about Collin, I told him he seemed like a dependable and trustworthy guy. This girl Amy told me she felt she could relate to me because I want to be out on my own and independent.  Well, DanCzar and I are chatting now, he is pretending to be a porn director. He wishes man. It is rather funny though.  I have to work tonight from 4:30 to 10. Its going to be loads of fun. And then tomorrow I have to do my homework that I meant to do today. Whoops. Oh well. I think tomorrow I may have lunch again with DanCzar, too. Maybe some  bowling it up, and fixing of my cd burner, and some iced oatmeal cookies, but only 4 of them for DanCzar.

      At the end of my last blog, I was excited because Dan got online, and boy was it a good thing that he did! I asked Dan to help me out with some stuff on my compy, and then to grab some lunch. Except we went in reverse order due to hunger. So off to Wendys we went, ate and chatted, it was nice. I'm glad my bestest buddy is back in town! Then we headed back to my house, where my parentals finally met that DanCzar guy thats oh so popular in my household. We got this computer stuff done, piece of pie! I now have dead aim, and I got to chage some things on my blog, too! And hopefully soon, my cd burner shall work again! YAY!  After fixing all of the compy problems, we decided Dan needed to see his gf, so off to Courtneys house we went, where we all hung out for  a bit, Courtney got a spongebob tatoo, and then we left. I finally got to see DanCzars house, and meet his parents, who seem to be really nice. I guess today was meet the parents day, Dan met mine, Dan met Courtneys, and Courtney and I met Dans. Fun stuff man. So we stole DanCzars ENC 1101 work, and then headed to the mall whee Danny Wanny bought us ice cream, and then he got his hair cut. While there we saw quite a bit of people, Keri, Jeremy, Chris, 2 other people I can't remember the names of, and Josh's brother Dan. Then we left.   I guess Dan went home, and Courtney and I went to Brittanys for a few, then headed to my house, then Courtney left. Eventful, eh? Oh but while riding with DanCzar, in the camaro with the bump for my feet to rest on in the passenger seat, and the cool bucket seats in the back, I searched through 172 oldies songs, only to find that the one I wanted to listen to, wasn't on the CD. It made me rather sad...  So after Courtney left, I was sent grocery shopping for my parents, because my mom hurt her back, and my dad is just to lazy to go. So off to Publix I went with a small list, adn 25 dollars to cover it. I pulled into the parking lot, and realized, oh yeah, they close at 9.. duh I work there, I should have known that. So off to Winn Dixie I went. Got what I needed, and while heading to check out, Josh called me. I guess he was going mud slingin and was inviting me since Sunday night didn't go as well as planned, but I promised my mom I would stay in tonight, because she was complaining about me never being home. Like it matters to her anyway... so I declined for that reason. Maybe another time. He promised me when he got the lift put on his truck I would be the first to see and ride in it, so I feel special, YAY!  So now I am just sitting at home, I realized that I lost all of my away messages when switching to dead aim, so I started refinding them, and DanCzar had some of mine that he sent to me, and I found some new ones. Apparently I cheated since I used a website, well Courtney- STFU, I don't care! lol. Well I guess I am done bloging for now. Tonight is pretty  boring since I am staying in... But I need to do some reading, and some thinking about things, make some decisions... That great stuff. I'll probably call it an early night tonight.

      Well, well, well... yeah Saturday night, there was a huge thunderstorm, and I guess it decided to kill my internet while  I was at Randis house. I came home to find this, and was not very happy. I did the usual church thing with the family on Sunday (like I have much of a choice), and my mom hurt her back, so she decided I should run errands for her, yeah, thanks mom. It wasn't so bad though, just getting a few things from the grocery store. So I came home, still no internet. I was rather upset at this point because I wanted to talk to DanCzar because he was finally home, but I couldn't get online to talk to him. So I decided to give him a call, to talk and well maybe he could help with the internet, because like he says, he is the coolest nerd around (Besides my brother, because he actually won that award back in the day of his high school life). So Dan and I talked for a while, and my back started hurting, I think I pulled something ya all but, I'm not sure. Needless to say, no success with fixing my internet. So I told DanCzar he was useless but I loved him anyway, even though he made fun of me for falling out of my bed while talking to him on the phone. Then we hung up. I hung around the house until 4, and then went to work, which is always loads of fun.   So yeah worked sucked, except my break, because I had break with my buddy Josh, and he is always fun to talk to. We decided to go muddin after work, so I called up Courtney, she decided to come along, and I planned to stay at her house. Well I got out of work and went home and changed, and waited on my call from Josh, and for Courtney to arrive. So finally I get my call and my ride, and we head up to Publix where Josh was still waiting, then we hopped into the truck, and headed to the power lines. It was an interesting ride because well, Josh's truck has bucketseats, so its 2 seats and a center consol. Guess who got to sit in the middle. Me! Well, I volunteered, I didn't really care, but it made the ride interesting none the less. So the whole muddin thing didn't go over to well because well, Kenny was supposed to come, and he decided sleeping sounded better, and John decided that he needed to hang out with his girlfriend. So off to Wanky's we went, but they were closed on the inside, so we sat at the West Marine and ate on the bench outside. Then Josh's brother joined us, his name was Dan, wow, I'm knowing a lot of Dan's these days, craziness, but anywho, he was nice. So from the old publix we moved to the new publix where John decided to ditch his girlfriend and join us. We sat and chatted, and all just went home around 12 or so. So I told Josh he owes me a real muddin trip, because that one wasn't that much of an experience.  On the way home, we stopped at Circle K so I could use the restroom facilities, and Seth happened to be there, and I didnt' even recognize him, he died his hair blonde, it was crazy. So we talked to him for a bit, it was one of those long time no see things, then headed out, and he was going the same direction, so we raced a little bit, then waved bye and went to Courtneys, where talking occured, and then some sleep.  Court is visiting her brother in Ocala now, so I'm chillin at home, waiting for her to get back in town so we can hang out. I got my brother to call the internet people, they came and fixed it, hence the way I am updating this blog to you  right now. And that survey thing, not me not having a life, but me liking surveys is that ok with you Courtney? eh? IS IT NOW?!?! I don't have work today, so I'm not sure what I will do, Megan wanted to hang out, but she hasnt' called me back, so I don't know what I will be up to today, but I would like to know where DanCzar is... he just keeps leaving me. It is so sad. Oh wait, he just got online, YAY!

      So last night, I worked, it rocked. Well, not really, but still. I don't have to much to say but, there were a few funny things. After work last night, I stopped by Brittanys house because her, Lauren (the texas friend), Liz, and Jessie were all watching movies and hangin out. I stayed for about an hour, just chilled, and headed home to well, sleep.  So this morning I had to work from 10:30 - 4:30. And on my break I did some shopping for my mom. It was funny because my friend Josh (yes, Courtney, the guy with the hole) whom I work with was in there shopping too! So he had left his truck at publix last night and I was a bit confused as to why, so I asked him "Hey, why was your truck here last night?" he replied "Oh, I left it here for you. You should have left me the van so I could pick up the kids" I thought it was pretty funny, because he is always like "hey you have the van" whenever I drive to work, cause ya know me+ no car= driving my moms van- w00t! So then later on Josh was working too, then I left because I rule. But before I left he told me I had to go visit him since I wasn't closing which wasn't fair. I said I'd think about it.  So I decided since it is summer and I do live in a very hot place, I should own more than one pair of shorts, eh? So off to bells I went to find they were having 50% off on shorts, even better! So, I still only found one pair I liked, but whatever, I now own 2 pairs of shorts! Even better! So while short shopping I got a call from Randi, and we are to hang out tonight, yay! So, I called her when I was leaving and told her I had to stop by publix, and I'd call her when I got home, and then she should come to mi casa so we can go somewhere and do well something. My next little stop was to publix, where I kept my word, and visited Josh... and Megan, and Nicole. My favorite work people. Then I bought some brownies, and headed home. (The brownies were excelent btw!) So here I sit, awaiting Randi's arrival, drinking my Mt.Dew (which I also purchased at Publix). I may go mudding tonight also, not sure if I will or not, but if I do, I think it will be LOADS of fun, because  I like that stuff, but never get to do it very often. So I am excited.  In EVEN BETTER new, DanCzar is coming home tonight, and I am really really REALLY happy about that. I missed my buddy Danny Wanny. He is probably mad at me though because I just called him Danny Wanny where others could read. It is my pet name for him. He is my bitch. JAY KAY! But I do call him that, it just came out one day. So since he is coming home, that means we get to have our fun filled day. Cubans and bowling! YO! I'm excited.  The count down begins... 34 days until I go to PA! I'm going to hang out with my cousin Jaclyn as much as possible, its going to be great, I'm excited. Plus it will be my FIRST time EVER on a plane, which makes the experience EVEN BETTER! Ok, thats all folks!  Blog ya later! ;)

      Well today has been a pretty fun day. As you know I spent the night at Megans last night, she gave me some pictures from prom, one of me and Justin , and one of her and Justin. They are some good pictures, I shall post them, following this blog. Well Courtney got online and started  ya know talking to me when I got home, and she invited me to the beach with her family, because well, I'm practically family by now. I mean I even go get my own coke at their house when I'm thirsty. So, we ventured out to Pine Beach which is near Buccaneer Bay. It was a nice beach, very shallow water, I enjoyed myself. But as always, remained a pale shade of white. My skin sucks.  So on the way home we decided to stop off at McDonalds to get some ice cream, and we did. And the people there were tight waded nazis, but whatever. So my long lost friend Randi Rea happened to come in, in need of some food. So she ate, and talked with us. It was good seeing her. I need to hang out with her, and my dear friend Fork (Katie Wilson) Its just been to long. So I've just arrived home from the beach, and found probably the best thing ever. My bestest friend DanCzar, made a blog. AND he is coming home tomorrow, so I get to see him again! YAY! We are going to go bowling, and have some cubans at Caribbean Cravings, and whatever else comes up, yo! (That was for you Danny Wanny!)  Well now I am off to shower, and get ready for work, the good old 5-10 shift. YIPPIE! So off to Publix, to spend my friday night being bored...  Oh and a quick note! I shall be getting a truck! What now! Details later!

      Well, well, well. What a day today has been! I'll tell you what! So, I wrote earlier about having my first day of class and being nevrvous and what not, but well, it only got better.  So Courtney and I decided to lunch it up. First we went to Carlos tire place, which is by publix, to get her new spare tire, and got hit on by some uhh older mechanic type guys, and I couldnt' hear a word they said, because apparently I'm deaf or something. Anywho, So then I went and got my paycheck and we were off to wendys. So after lunch, we ventured to Courtneys house to pick up her books and stuff for class. Well on the way there, we are at the light at home depot on 19, and all the sudden Courtney says "Hey, My cars off!" And it was! Her car just turned off! So after laughing hysterically, Courtney turned her car back on, and we made it to the second home depot entrance, and pulled in. We reved the engine a bit, and realized that it about turned off every time her foot went off the gas. This is where I come in. I thought we should make a game out of it, I told Courtney to just keep her foot on the gas, no stopping for anything, and to cut people off and hope no one hit us, it sounded like a good game to me! So, we play the game. And luckily we didnt' die. We made it to Courtneys house, got her stuff, and were on our way. The car ran fine all the way until like 2 minutes from my house, when well, it completely died. Needed a new fuel filter apparently. (By the way, Courtneys car is a 1974 baby blue bug... the age causes the problems) So we are standing on the side of the road waiting for my mom to arrive, and this road happens to be the one my friend Brittany lives off of, and guess who happenes to be coming home with a friend whos visiting from Texas, Brittany! So yeah Court and I are laughing and telling her the car broke down, I think her friend thought we were a little weird, but whatever, it happens. So, FINALLY my mom arrives, except she passes us. So she decides to go off roading in our van. It was great, looked stupid, but great. And then I realized. Now I know where I get my stupid remarks and actions from. My grand old mom! THANKS MOM!  So our adventure leads us to my house, where ya know I talk to the parents tell them I am stealing there car, they run away, all this fun stuff. (Ok, so I lied about them running away.) We get ready for class, but opt to leave early because I decided I needed some shorts, since it is summer, and I only have all of uhh one pair. So off to SuperWalmart we go! I found a pair or cute bright boardshorts and an orange tank top. I am now the proud owner of them. We leave, and head to class.  As we turn onto 491, I start to realize, oh shit, I'm about to go to my FIRST college class. I finally get scared, when Courtneys been shitting her pants all day (literally.. ok jk.. well...) So I'm a little nervous. We park, get out stuff, put our cell phones on silent, be all prepared, all that, and walk toward class. We started walking up the wrong walkway, so we cut across the grass, but thats what its for right? So we go to class, wait awhile, people start slowly showing up, we know a whole one other person in there, Collin French. He seems to be a pretty fun guy though. I don't belive I had ever talked to him until that night. So, its like 6:05 pm, and I go "Hey our teacher is late for class" Just being stupid. Little did I know, that was just the begining. Our teacher hasn't shown up 30  minutes later. So we are all starting to wonder, and one girl goes and gets some help, and comes back in to tell us that our teacher is DEAD! NO, NO, JK! Our teacher is missing in action. So some lady comes and talks to us, tells us to wait 10 more minutes, sign a paper saying we showed up, and then just leave. So we sign a paper. Waited 10 minutes. And left, well all but like 2 goody goodies that probably sat there until 9:30pm. Now Courtney and I are like, dude, what are we going to do tonight? We call Brittany.  Britt is going goofy golfing, along with some of our friends and invites us along, and we are like ok sure! So we go to her house and its me, Courtney, Brittany, Jessie, Megan, and Lauren (Britt's Texas friend) we all get in two cars, and head out. Well Megan and I had been in a little tiff, and we made up, it was beautiful, we cried, laughed, and talked... all that good stuff. We arrive in Ocala, and realize all of us but Brittany, Jessie, and Lauren are poor. So Courtney, Megan, and I decide to go get some food at Bennigans, and are to meet up with the others for a meal when they are done, well they got done before our appatizer even got there, and we went to cancel, but it was coming out right then, so we felt bad, and were unable to eat together. So we meet up at Wendys, after we had both eaten at different restaurants. Court jumps in Britts car, and they head to the beach, while Megan and I head home, then I ended up staying at Megans house, something I hadn't done in  a while. So we stayed up, had girl chat, went to bed, and well now I am home. (I actually started this blog entry at her house last night).  So needless to say, last night was eventful. I played a dangerous game, my teacher skipped class instead of me, made up with a best friend, ate some good food, shared a lot of good laughs, and went to bed. What more could I ask for? Well, besides DanCzar getting his butt home, absolutly nothing...

       urlLink    So this is a picture of me and Courtney on the last day of school. Boy were we happy! Actually, it is always like that with Courtney. I have no serious pictures of me and her. I don't think I will ever get many. Yeah, this was the day I wrecked my car now that I think about it. What a day that was. Anywho, back to Courtney and I. Some how, we got put in what 2 classes together, and my life has been, interesting. And I like it. The school system provided me with a best friend. At least they did one thing right!&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    This is probably one of the few pictures I will ever be able to get of all of my best friends together, and not even all of them are there. Thats Courtney, Jessie, Brittany, Me, Megan, and Elizabeth. This was my birthday back in February. Its always really hard to get everyone together because well friendships with girls just come with problems. Sometimes friends get in arguements, and the others are caught inbetween. Regardless, it doesn't mean they aren't friends, its more than likely PMS, to much stress, or misunderstandings. All the girls in that picture are my best friends. I plan on being friends with every single one of them until the end of time. Yeah, we are going to fight, and yeah at times not be as close as I wish we would, but I know that if I needed to, I could go to any of these girls for anything. Thats the best part about best friends, they are ALWAYS there for one another.&nbsp; urlLink

      Well, I'm not really sure what to do here. This blog thing is confusing, but I saw Courtney had one, and I'm a copycat so I was like "Hey! I want one too!" Alright, so I'm not really a copycat, but did think this think looked cool. I'm a bit confused on this whole setting up process, but I'm sure I will figure it out.   So, Its 10:57 am on a thursday morning. I got up, walked to my computer to find three messages from Courtney, all of which said "wake up." I told her I was awakened, but now she is dead, I dunno some phone guy or whatever. Anywho, so I'm still sitting here in my pajamas, which I love, because they are so comfortable. So what things are running through my head right now? Well, it's Thursday, payday, AND my first day of class (for college), it's exciting, yet nerve racking at the same time. I'm taking a simple English class, ENC 1101. I don't think it will be to hard, but it is just the though of it being college. But I'm thinking it won't be so bad. I actually can't wait to be out of high school and in college. Theres a lot I just want to leave behind in the River. It is now 11:04 am, where the hell is Courtney. Where the hell is DanCzar for that matter?!?!?  That boy, I swear, my bestest guy friend. I tell him everything, which he probably hates sometimes. Haha.  So, I'm not to sure as to what I'll be doing today. Well, until 6:00 pm that is. Cause that is when class starts. I guess I'll get my paycheck at some point today. Maybe shower, too. Not in that order though. But as of now, Breakfast is sounding good, until I open my cabnits and find no food, but I'm going to go search anyway.

      I think I woke up the earliest I have woken up on a saturday so far this summer this past saturday. I woke up about 7:30. Courtney and I decided we would beat the mad race of consumers and go shopping at super walmart at 8:00 am. Why? Just for fun! So we did the shopping thing, had some breakfast at McDonalds, and ventured back to my house so I could go get ready for work at 11. Work was work. I got the truck again,  w00t w00t!  Worked till 2, came home, went to sleep, then ventured back to Publix at like 6:30 to do some grocery shopping for the mother, and then meet Josh when he got off work. So I did just that, talked for a few minutes, he headed to go 4 wheelin, I headed home to prepare for Tampa.  Attened church this morning with the family like usual. Nothing to special. It was a very satanic experience...  JUST KIDDING!  Went home, showered, and prepared for Tampa with DanCzar. He was late, I was sad. He also forgot the mountain dew and and a camera. Even worse. But I forgave him. Until he got us lost once we got to Tampa. We had to call my brother twice to figure out where we were. So while DanCzar figured out what he did wrong, I talked with Courtney. She was in gville. So we figured out where we were, and went to Bennagins for lunch. Then to the mall to shop it up. I got a skirt, and two shirts. Then we ventured to the other mall to go to OldNavy. I got flip flops and socks. Then we were pulling out, and DanCzar tried to kill us. It was grad. He pulled out onto the highway  starting to drive the wrong direction, not noticing there was a median he coudln't cross. So I was like  "WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!?!"  DanCzar :"OH SHIT!"  *turns car around quick* we bust out laughing. What a great experience. So we arrive at my brothers place, hang out, I did the dishes for him. He got us pizza. We talked, laughed, then left around 7:30. I had a fun filled but tiring day. DanCzar rocks, I swear, it is like I have two brothers named Dan. Got home around 9, where I planned to just go to bed, but my brothers were being too loud for my comfort. So to the compy I have ventured. I called Josh like I was supposed to, but coudln't get a hold of him.... bet he is 4 wheelin or something...  Ugh, weightlifting tomorrow 8 am, and then my senior pics at 11! w00t. I'm hoping that my bruise can be covered up, its not that bad anymore. I get to dip out of weightlifting early because I need to go get ready for pictures and stuff. Courtney shall be accompanying me I think, since her pics are at 11:15. Then I got that work thing at 5. Yay... And in exciting new, Randi Rea is making a blog.  SCORE!

      Each day I realize that more and more things than you expected can happen in a day. I never got to start on my process essay on Wednesday, because I had to go work from 4:30-10:00. Work was, well work I mean, nothing special. When I was on break, I was walking to the van to get some money for a snack and Joe and Daniel were about to leave the parking lot, and they saw me and drove over so we had a little chat. They asked about my cheek, because I guess Megan had somewhat filled them in on the story earlier, and they insisted whoever did it punched me, then when I told them it was Josh they were like "ooohh ok, he's cool, it must have been an accident" etc. So I then proceeded to sit on the hood of Daniels car and he drove me to where I was parked. So after work Josh and I had yet another talk, and I liked this one a bit more. Then I drove 2 feet away to where Brittany, Joe, and Daniel were all sitting. They had scared Megan when she was walking to her car, and she was on the phone with her dad, so when she screamed, Mr.Hinman and Matt flippedout thinking she was hurt or something. Needless to say, they weren't very happy. So Megan left and I hung out and talked with them for a few minutes, and then headed home, talked to Megan for a little bit, and had a chat with Katy Shotwell for a bit, hadn't talked to her in a while, so we caught up some.  Well Thursday I woke up late, so I got to weightlifting a little late, but I showed, that was all that mattered. I got to take the truck, so I was happy, and I did good, no stalling, no bouncing around when starting off, I was proud. After practice I stopped in at Publix, got my paycheck, and some milk, then headed home. Courtney decided she'd join me at my hair appointment at 1:30, so she could revise my essay for me, and do some of her work while hanging out. Josh gave me a call, and we talked while he was trying to replace the starter on his truck, which he never got around to finishing, so we hung up, I hopped in the shower, Courtney arrived, and off to Santa Barbara in Inverness we went. (By the way, Ms. Zee is the best with hair, and she has good prices, you should go to her for everything!) Well my appointment got pushed back late because she was dying someones hair, but I did get my hair cut, just a trim and some layers, I like it. We were starved by this point, so we headed to subway, then headed home to finish up our homework and go to class, then meet Josh, John, and Ryan for some 4 wheeling action.  I didn't finish my essay until like 2 seconds before I had to leave for class. I did it on Ramen Noodles, so I had a package to look at to compare to my directions, so when I threw my stuff into my book bag, then noodles somehow came with me, I found them during class, Collin, Courtney, and I got a great laugh out of it. We had to present out essays, a bit scary, but it was cool, I tried to make mine funny. Class got out early, around liek 8:30, so I got my stuff from my house, and headed out with Courtney, we got some taco bell, and then headed to Publix, where I talked to Megan and Nicole for a bit, then headed out to Meadowcrest to drop off Courtneys car, from there John took us to Ryans house, where we went 4 wheeling at. It was really dusty so we wore goggles, they were fun but goofy looking, but hey, it kept dirt out of my eyes, I was happy. Ryan rode his own 4 wheeler, John and Court got one, and Josh and I got the other. Ryan, Josh and I hid from Courtney and John at one point and it was a lot of fun, Ryan kept running, but me and Josh had the best hiding place ever, no one could find us, so we just kind of sat and talked for a while. Things are nice. We rode over a lot of jumps, it was really fun, and then found a bunch of big frogs that the guys all wanted to catch. We finally headed in. Josh left, and John took Courtney and I to her car, and we headed home. When we were about to Courtneys house we got a call from John sayin he got pulled over, I felt bad cause he was rushing to make it home since he was about past curfew since he had to take us to Courtneys car. I stayed at Courtneys, and we had the day off of weightlifting today, so we slept in, it was great!  Today Courtney and DanCzar are off seeing anchorman or whatever, and I'm gonna start my homework and then work 5-10. I guess Sunday DanCzar and I are going shopping in Tampa. I get to help my bestest bud pick out some clothes! YAY! And ya know, do some shopping myself, I need some stuff before going to Pennsylvania, and then we might stop by to see Dan (my brother) and Paul at their apartment, that is if they aren't working. So it should be a fun filled day, DanCzar promised me Country music cds, and an oldies cds with a few specific songs I want on it to listen to on the ride there. I'm excited. DanCzar also fixed my cd burner, I'm happy. He rocks.

      Monday night when I came home,finally lol, I called Randi and ventured to her house so we could have a good chat. And we did. Then I went back home and got a call from Courtney, and got more confused. So we talked a bit, then I headed to bed.   Tuesday morning we had weightlifting, I was a bit scared walking in there since we hadn't shown on Monday, and since I had a bruised cheek. Well coach didn't notice for a while, but when he did it was a frightening incident, I had had a story all prepared to tell him that was a lie, but I couldn't do it, so I just told him what happened, and explained it was an accident, and he looked at me like he was going to kick some ass, so I joked about it and we got over it. When we walked in the room though he goes to Courtney- "So I see you got the message, and you relayed it to her like usual" He wasn't a bit suprised to see us walking in together. I guess he had told AD to tell us we were supposed to be at weightlifting, so he told Courtney, but me and her had already known that! It felt good to be back in the weight room, it had been quite a while. I didn't do as well maxing out as I had hoped, but since I haven't worked out in like 3 months, I guess it'll do for a first day back. I maxed on bench with 95, Power Cleaned 95, Incline benched 75, and Squatted 155. Needless to say, I'm a little sore right now.  So Courtney took me home and we both got to work on our stuff for school. I wrote the crappiest essay ever, and luckily I'm getting to redo it before it is seriously due on Thursday. I talked to Brian and Tyler online for a bit, and was going to see Brian before school since it has been forever, and apparently our classes are at the same times. Courtney picked me up for class, and we headed out, but Brian was running late, so I didn't see him, oh well, maybe another time. So off to class Courtney and I ventured along with Collin. We found out that our class had been moved to a down stairs classroom, after walking upstairs and to class, so we went and found the new room, and class began. Nothing to exciting, just got some more homework. As we were leaving, Courtney got the best suprise ever. I'm really happy for her. So she took me to my house, we walked inside and my mom goes "So how was class?" Jackie:"Stupid." Courtney:"Boring." My mom:"Stupid, and boring, hmm I'm glad I'm not paying for this class..." My mom, she cracks me up sometimes. That was about it for the night, Courtney left and I hung around talking to DanCzar and Jessie. I had 50 billion messages when I woke up this morning though, ok so maybe only like 7, but still I felt special. I really liked the one from Conrad telling me I was off dreaming about the math class we used to have together and how he helped me pass the class and how he was such a great tutor. Funny cause, I taught him how to do stuff haha. Nice try Conrad.  So far today, I managed to skip weightlifting again... whoops, but I didn't have a ride today, but tomorrow, I get to take the truck! SCORE! I did my learning log for class, and started on a replacement essay for the one I messed up on. Then I get to write another essay, a process essay where I will explain how to cook Ramen Noodles. w00t! I wish I had a massuse on hand right now. Cause I'm so sore from working out. I guess I better go ice my cheek some more, too. This baby has to be gone by Monday so I can take my senior pics! I hope it goes away...

      Double meaning phrases, I seemed to have mastered them, even in my titles...  So it's a grand 2 days since I have posted, and there is just oh so much to say! Well Saturday night I did hang out with Josh. It wasn't what we expected it to be, but thats cool, it was fun enough. We stoped at Johns house first, and he hopped in his truck and we followed him out to the powerlines. Some other people came out there and what not, and we just hung around and talked, then things got a little stupid so we left and went to taco bell, and then to the old publix to eat. Oh and by the way, I got to drive his truck there. I felt special because apparently no one ever gets to drive his truck. So then he took me home and that was that.  Sunday- Might I add a late HAPPY 4TH OF JULY! for everyone! Well Courtney and I decided we would go to Cedar Key to see Jessie, and Mikey was to ride along with us. So we ate some subway first, and Josh met me there to chat and say bye before I left. So we piled into Courtneys car, and headed to Cedar Key. We sung a lot of Disney songs on the way, it was great. We finally arrived in Cedar Key to find Jessie and Brittany and we all hopped in Jessie's Grandpas pool. Then we decided to hop in the golf cart and go for some food. So we went to eat, and Jessie gave us a tour around CK, it was a lot of fun might I add. We searched for Mandy, and found her a few times lol. Around 5:30 Court and I headed back to the river so we could see some fireworks. We got in town, and went to my house to get a shower, and I called Josh to say I was in town and see what he was doing. So we ended up meeting Courts parents at by the Ale House, stealing some money and venturing off to Wendys and then to Johns house where we jumped on the boat with John, Josh, and Johns family. We watched the fireworks from the water, it was beautiful. A great night, I even got to wear my cowgirl hat. I was happy. So the fireworks ended, I decided to stay at Courts house that night, so we hung out at Johns for a while. The night was perfect, a lot of fun just hangin out with Josh John and Courtney. My night was pleasent. I decided on some things, and I was content, extremely happy.  Today was also very eventful. We woke up, and decided to skip weightlifting. To tired from the night before. Coach is going to kick mine and Courtneys asses. We've never missed practice before, at least not that I can remember. So we finally got up, went to  lunch with DanCzar at Cravings, I had a cuban, it was great. And were getting ready to leave and go meet John and Josh to go on the boat, but John found us, he and his family, along with Josh, were going to eat at Crackers, but it was to long of a wait, so we ventured back to Cravings. John spilt his coke all over Courtney, it was hilarious. John, Josh, Courtney, and me piled into the bug and went to Johns house to get the other boat. We got on and met his parents (who had driven the boat over to eat) and watched as his brother and his friend were tubing. Then Josh and I decided to tube and it was a lot of fun, but we got flung off and Joshs elbow hit my cheek, so now I have a bruised cheek, but its ok, it'll go away, I mean shit, accidents happen. Then we went to the shallows and hung out. I had a long talk with Josh, and then we headed back to Johns. John, Court, and me went to McDonalds for some icecream, and Josh headed home. Courtney took me home and now shes off somewhere. The boat trip ended differently then I had thought it would. Thats all I really know what to say, because I don't understand somethings, but thats how life is. You aren't supposed to understand everything. My day amounted to a bruised cheek and a Singed organ. Yes, a capitol S.  Bruised and Singed. Fireworks are done, and there is nothing more to joyously aww about. On to lifes next event.

      Last night, I had that thing called work from 5-10. It sucked. No one was closing, I was all alone. It was sad. So I got home and DanCzar was online and I tried to talk to him but it was Chris Garlock and he told me in order to talk to DanCzar I had to participate in a phone convorsation with him, so I had DanCzar call my phone. We talked for a bit, then I got off so I could go change, and Josh called me. He didnt' finish the lift on his truck so he didn't seem to happy, I felt bad. And I was informed I'm going to do something with him tonight. So I finally called DanCzar back and apologized for taking so long, he understood, and tried to bring me a chalupa but I told him I didn't think that would flow well with the parents since it was almost midnight.  Today I worked from 10:30 - 4, had a cuban for lunch, it was grand. We were extremely busy. So now I'm home, waiting for Brittany, we are gonna go hang out and try some of this cool mudd stuff I saw at K Mart, and then tonight I'm hangin out with Josh for a while after he gets off of work around 7! So maybe I'll actually have something interesting to write about. I still have to decide what to write about for my Descriptive Essay for class. I'll figure that out later I guess. Probably do it Monday or something...

      Well Wednesday was just Wednesday. I can't really remember what I did... I guess I just hung out with Courtney, went home, and went to work. Thats right, I worked 4:30 till 10. Josh came and met me after I got off work, and we just sat and talked for a bit, and John and some other people showed up for a few minutes to chat, too. So I went home, happy, and called Courtney. We talked on the phone for a record breaking like 2 hours. It was insane. The convorsation was just too hilarious to stop! It was important "shit" and I'll leave it at that. LOL  So Thursday I woke up at 8:30 and got started on my homework for class. I had to write a narrative essay, so I chose to do mine on when I spent the week in the hospital when I was like 8 for getting my appendix out. I was rather proud of it. Plus I had to do a learning log thing, which was also really easy.   While I was finishing up, Josh called me and so I accompanied him to talk to some people about putting the lift on his truck, and pick up some parts. Then we grabed soem McDonalds and headed to his house, where I met his mom and ate. It was fun. So after that he dropped me off and headed to work, while I got ready for class and made some dinner so my mom didnt' have to when she came home. So off to class I went, and it was weird showing up with out Courtney, because we always ride together, but not this time, because she was still fixing up her essay.  Well we had a pretty fun class this time. Except I think the teacher hates us because we whisper a lot, but she complains the class is to quiet and then gives us dirty looks when we talk... makes no sense to me! I drew a picture of a dr. pepper can for our descriptive lesson, looked pretty good for a drawing by me! We had to visualize and object, thats where I got the dr. pepper from, it was sitting on her desk, and we had to close our eyes and imagine touching it, and Courtney started playing with my hair, so I hit her hands away from me, and we busted out laughing, and the teacher didnt' like that. She yelled at us, said to do it with out hitting each other, it was rather funny though! Well class let out at 8:45 and I was happy about that because I had wanted to stop up at work, but didn't have time before class, so I thought if I hauled ass I could make it.  Courtney and I hauled ass to Publix, where I found it was too late, so I left Josh a note apologizing for not coming to see him but telling him I had tried, and I told Beau, who was standing outside to tell him I had shown up. So off to my house we went, to drop off the van and tell my mom I was boycotting sleeping at home that night, so I was going to Courtneys. We took care of that crap, then headed to Wendys, which was closed on the inside so we decided to eat on the West Marine bench, which we do a lot when we eat a night. It is now mine and Courtneys new place, we've decided. Screw loitering rules.  So we pull out of the drive though, get settled on the bench, and then realize, hey the screwed us out of a thing of fries, back to the drive through we went! They upgraded us from a medium to a LARGE fry! w00t! So while we were waiting in line, we had a convorsation with Tucker, who was in the car in front of us. We still aren't sure of his last name, but I've seen him around and talked to him before, he works at Movie Gallery and Inland Ocean. So we told him we were going to go eat on the bench, and he was welcome to join us, well I didn't think he was going to he was like oh maybe but it sounded like he was just being nice. Next thing we know, hes hauling ass through the parking lot and pulls up and comes and sits and eats with us. Then he left, and talked to some friends, and it looked like he was leaving, but he pulled up again, and sat and talked to us some more. It was rather funny, so he left, we left and that was that.  Our intentions were to go home, but then we decided to move to the new publix to see if Josh had left work yet, and we found him and John there, and stopped by to hang out. Dan showed up, and this girl Kalie (sp?) she seemed nice, and then Kenny showed up. Kenny was drunk as hell, it was really funny how he was acting, but he left shortly. We hung out for quite a while just talking and stuff nothing to special, but my night ended rather well before we left. And thats all I'm a gonna say about that! Well, I'll say one more thing, YAY! :)   So Courtney and I said good night, and then began talking... its really weird how we do that, but its funny, too! So we finally assed out, and woke up this morning to her mom yelling for her little brother to get out of the tub. So we can tell she is at the bathroom door and Courtney goes to me. "Jackie, do you know what that means...?" and I go "The computers open!" She goes "Ok, on 3, ready?" Jackie "One" Courtney" Two" Both"Three" We jump up, I open the door and Courtney runs to the compy, I walked, and we took over the world! Ok, maybe just her computer but whatever! So we hung around, and then headed out with a list of errands. We dropped off books at the library, gave money to her coach, and got gas, and then went to Jessies so Courtney could straighten her hair for tonight. Which is something I can not disclose to you at this moment in time. So while she straightened her hair, I talked on the phone with Josh, who sounded really tired, but was being really nice like usual :) Then Jessie and Courtney bombarded me, so I hung up and helped Jessie pick out outfits, then Courtney and I were off to mi casa! She just left, with a pair of my pants, thats right, Courtney will be in my pants tonight, lol! So I gotta go shower soon, gotta work at 5, which means I also have to do laundry, so I really go to go! But I doubt anything more will happen tonight besides well the work thing, so, whatever...
