      I was just wondering if anybody would really be up for a seriously informal potluck type mixer thing some evening in July or August? It's possible that we have found a house to move into and it has a great backyard, so if all goes as we hope it does, then I'd be glad to host it. But if anybody else has a killer pad they're dying to show off, I'd be totally willing to bow out. You know, mostly an excuse to eat too much cheese dip and other goodies from the farmer's market and drink box wine and get to know eachother. I know, I know, you all already know eachother, but *I* don't. And I was kidding about the box wine.

      Spelling - by Margaret Atwood  My daughter plays on the floor with plastic letters, red, blue & hard yellow, learning how to spell, spelling, how to make spells.                   *  I wonder how many women denied themselves daughters, closed themselves in rooms, drew the curtains so they could mainline words.                   *  A child is not a poem, a poem is not a child. There is no either / or. However.                   *  I return to the story of the woman caught in the war & in labour, her thighs tied together by the enemy so she could not give birth.  Ancestress: the burning witch, her mouth covered by leather to strangle words.  A word after a word after a word is power.                   *  At the point where language falls away from the hot bones, at the point where the rock breaks open and darkness flows out of it like blood, at the melting point of granite when the bones know they are hollow & the word splits & doubles & speaks the truth & the body itself becomes a mouth.  This is a metaphor.                   *  How do you learn to spell? Blood, sky & the sun, your own name first, your first naming, your first name, your first word.

      Just a couple of things. I just found out we have to move in a (very) few weeks, so if anyone knows of a super good deal or has somewhere to recommend, I'm all ears. Email me. Also, if anyone wants to help tote or pack boxes. ha ha. But I DID think it would be nice to have a get together for the writing group and all our significant others and stuff so that everyone would have at least a passing idea of who we were all talking about during this six month experiment. Plus, I don't get out nearly enough with people my own age, so I'd like to have an excuse for a get together. if anyone else is interested, let me know and we'll plan something. I like to plan.

      This "fun" writing is amazing to me...for the first time since high school, I'm writing for ME. Of course, I'll share with you all. I'm not that selfish.

      very happy for the group blog. hubby says, "another blog?!" but he needn't worry. i'll always leave the computer to watch the daily show with him and the kitties. he can see me then.  unhappy because blogger will not accept any of my many names, even the real ones. hence, the rbkh. my name comes from hebrew so i suppose the nixing of vowels isn't totally unprecedented.  look foward to working with ya'll.

      Awesome idea for us to be able to communicate blogger-style, Mary! How I do adore posting and commenting...almost as much as I love carbs! Don't have any ideas yet for alternative names for the group, though am incredibly pleased to have been invited in. See y'all...you know...everyday of my life for the next five weeks. :)

      Thanks for taking the lead Mary... How exciting to have a new literary home for all of us.  I haven't yet come up with a name worthy of our group, but I'll keep chewing on it.  My recent trip to New York did however inspire me for the August assignment!  Now it's just finding the time to sit down and work on the idea that will be challenging.  Has anyone else come up with an idea, or has this last semester sucked out your creativity?  Oh, I saw today at the Java Monkey that they have open-mic nights there.  Anybody attend those events? Hugs,  -Amanda

      This is OUR blog for our new writing group, for which we have just started and have no name yet.  Just for now it is "Word After Word" but only for the sake of marking a space in the blog world.  It is up to change.  So, what should we call this community of writers and non-writers? poets and dramatists?  We did brainstorm a few ideas in our last (and first) meeting.  What other good names have you uncovered under stones lately?  Please reply.

      I just wanted to check and make sure that nobody besides the punctual Mary and Doug had gotten their pieces in. Being the only one not on Agnes Scott Mail, I'm paranoid. Also, I promise I will get you my piece Very Soon. Just not right now. I'm working on it. I'm not just sitting here with a blank document and a whiff of an idea. Really.    Oh, about the party. How is July 31st for everybody? Anybody? I have a cute house and a cute backyard. I can shoot for being unpacked by then. I live in Decatur, off of College Ave. down towards Avondale. if anyone else wants to volunteer, it's cool with me. What kind of party should this be? Should we have a theme? Should it be meal food, or just snacks? Who brings what?   And one more thing. If anybody need boxes for a move, I have a bunch of very clean sturdy boxes that need a new home. Pick them up and they are yours.

      Hey, Just wanted to add a cute picture of Mary and me that was taken on her birthday! I would post other pictures if I was given permission by those in them.  But I'm sure Mary won't care.

             Well, it's almost over.  Regardless of the stress from last semester, none of us will forget Byron's hand movements during his presentations or Amy's creative hairdos and outfits or my standing, laying on the chair/desk/floor/whatever is available and all the other behaviors that set us apart from the person beside us.  But, now is the chance for those of us who are really writers to come together in a new and refreshing way.  Finally we will have a safe space to express our ideas, to question, to wonder, no matter how "out there" these thoughts may be.  And, we'll have the opportunity to publish together, attend spoken word events, meet authors, poets, musicians, etc.    I was reading "Life As An Adverb" yesterday, and Lee was talking about feeling nervous about going back to the real world, the working world.  I, too, already feel sad about not having school, not being a student who can hide behind that name and make mistakes because of that name: student.  But, we'll be that for each other and not the Survivor Island reality show type of student that many of us felt we were this last semester.  You won't be stranded out there in the intellectual wilderness on your own.    I just want to encourage everyone to really stay dedicated to the group, to become empowered by each other. It will be what we put in to it, and we will grow in every way if each person brings his or her whole self to the table. I know many of us are winding down from school, but I'm trying to look at my first piece as a way to purge.  It's therapeutic!   See you August 2 @6pm at Ashtons.  Oh, and I'd still like some feedback on getting together for a cookout or something at someone's house.  Volunteers?  Didn't Jenny say she could host?  When I get settled into our new house (hopefully by Christmas if not way before) I want to have everyone over! Maybe we can have our Christmas or Winter Holidays party at my house!! Take care,  -Amanda

      In addition to Amanda's post, I just wanted to add that the pieces are due soon - by this upcoming Monday or Tuesday (19th/20th) - so that each of us has time to write our comments and responses on them; members of group #2 will bring their pieces on the night of our first meeting.  Since we are the very first group to go, I suggest sending your pieces via email/email attachment.  Refer to Doug's list from earlier, and make sure to add Tony's and Lisa Anne's emails to the list.  I hope everyone is doing well.

      Hey all! Just wanted to remind group #1, which is Jenny, Doug, Laura, Mary, Amy and Lisa Anne that we will be looking for your first writing piece to arrive for critique in another week or so.  Good luck to everyone during the last week of class/finals for our MAT group. I know that you are relieved that it's almost over.   Also, Ashtons has started a Saturday night open-mic poetry event.  I attended last night and was quite impressed.  The place was packed, and many of the poets were extremely rhythmic.  I saw one published poet, Chris Slaughter, whom I had known in NYC and have heard his work many times... so some experienced people were in the house (as well as some new voices).  I think it would be great for us to go one Saturday night as a group.  I think we could really add a new flavor into the mix.  I purchased a CD from one poet called Freedom Speaks, and she really seemed to have mastered the word play of spoken word. It's a different way to look at writing, and I really think the audience would appreciate our diversity.  If any of you want to attend on the 17th or 24th let me know. It starts at 10:30pm but I only stayed about an hour, although I'm sure the mic was open for quite awhile longer.  One other idea.  I am hoping that we can have a public reading sometime in November.. possibly November 15 since we have extra weeks in that month.  Please be thinking of places to have this and the way you might want to organize the event... or if you even want to do this at all.  Ashtons might be an idea or somewhere different just for a change.  We could serve appetizer at someone's house.. whatever.  I just thought that it would be cool to invite those we care about to come and hear our work.  If anybody wants to head up the endeavor, let me know.  Hope the words are flowing and everyone is doing well!  Until next time... Amanda

      I just wanted to say hey to everyone in our writing group.  I know many of you know each other for about a year or so now...isn't that right?  Well, I only know a few of you; I see familiar faces on campus sometimes but we still don't know each other.  This is an excellent way of getting to know all of you; what a good idea!  I'm looking forward to it! Oh where oh where is this party...?  :)  ~Laura

      Hey, I think we should try to get Khwaja to join our group.  He is a writer and would add so much to our discussions.  I know the group won't run smoothly with too many people, but I think he could really bring in a new perspective and make us stretch.    P.S. Are the creative juices flowing for your piece for August? Have a great 4th of July!  -Amanda

      Hi Everyone,  (do I have everyone on my e-list above?)          First of all, I still (okay, I'm a complete idiot) can't figure out how to post on the group's blog. Although I have a "profile," the name of our blog doesn't come up so I can't get into it in posting mode. I can, of course, read the blog. If anyone can give me a hint as to how to do this correctly, I'd be grateful.          Second and much more important, we had a very good meeting last night, I thought. I hope all the contributors got something useful from the discussion of their works.           At the end, we talked about how it went and what we'd like to do to make it even better in the future.  Here are the suggestions that came from that discussion.           --Each time we meet, anyone who CAN'T attend should let others know so that we don't wait for someone who is not coming. Email, blog post, telephone--just let the group or someone who is coming know that you can't make it.          --We will start on time, so if the meeting is scheduled for 6 p.m., that's when the writing exercise person will get us going. If you want to socialize before the meeting, come early!  If we need to change the meeting time to accommodate people who have to come from across town or whatever, we can do that.           --At least for next time, the group that is presenting their works should get them to the rest of us by email NO LATER THAN A WEEK BEFORE THE MEETING. If we want to go back to the other method, that is, you distribute your work at the meeting before the meeting where you present, we can do that. But only Tony brought her work to distribute last night, so we decided to distribute works by email for next time.          --Everyone should read everything two or three times before the discussion. That's why we need to get the works distributed early.           --Also, let's give our marked copies to the author after the discussion--that way she or he can contemplate suggestions, queries, etc. that aren't necessarily covered in the discussion.           --If you come to the meeting, please make every effort to stay the whole time. That's the level of commitment that will make the group work. We will do everything possible to stay on t ack, so that we begin and end on time.  Again, we can change the time to accommodate people if need be.          --These suggestions come from me. Could everyone put their name, the date of the discussion, and page numbers on their works? This will enable all of us to be better organized.           --Another suggestion from me--we can talk about this one. Perhaps the person assigned to lead us in a writing exercise each time could also be the "leader" for that night--keeping us on track with the time, serving as a contact person for last minute drop-outs, etc.  I fell naturally into the leader's role last night, and while I could continue to do that, I think it would feel more like a writing GROUP if we shared that responsibility.  Let's discuss this, and indeed, we can discuss all of these comments.            --Future meetings.  Our next meeting will be Monday, August 23, 6-8 p.m. unless we decided differently over email. For September, we pencilled in  the 13th and the 27th (so as to avoid meeting on Labor Day weekend).   Following that schedule, the October meetings would be on  the 11th nd the 25th, which works well with my travel schedule. Again, all of this can be discussed and changed, but we wanted to at least begin to look ahead.           Thanks to everyone who worked hard to make last night's meeting a sucess.  Special thanks to our four illustrious contributors/guinea pigs who held up beautifully under the group's scrutiny.          I enjoyed talking about writing with writers--I hope others did, too!          Christine

      Because I am all English-y (the discipline, not the nationality) I was asked to read a poem at a friend's wedding.  Once at a bar, long before the bride met the groom, she and I noticed a young man sitting at the bar and staring in her direction. She giggled and blushed. It was dark in the bar, but she blushed when boys were mentioned, so it's a good guess that her face was bright red above her beer.  Another friend and I thought that 2:00 am on a Thursday would be the perfect time for matchmaking. I would continue standing with the not-yet-bride-to-be, while my friend would approach the boy and send him in our direction. It would be perfect, and we would take credit for finding a boyfriend for our most deserving--yet shyest--friend.  I distracted the bride with engrossing conversation: "This beer is good tonight. But not as cold as last night." I kept a close eye on the friend and the soon-to-be-boyfriend of the not-yet-bride-to-be.    I wasn't as sly as I could have been, though. As soon as the staring boy got up from his bar stool, one foot pointed in our direction, I turned back to see the reluctant girlfriend sprinting out the back door of the bar. My friend and I were devastated--certain that years would pass before she had a boyfriend, and offended that our good taste in early morning drunk boys was being so carelessly dismissed in favor of dimly lit dumpsters.  This weekend, though, the bride didn't escape through the back door of the church. She stood confidently (with a few tears) while marrying a man she didn't meet at a bar or through my questionable match-making. And she gave me some better words to say, probably because beer temperature doesn't set such a romantic mood:  "Love Song"  Pablo Neruda  I love you, I love you, is my song and here my silliness begins.  I love you, I love you my lung, I love you, I love you my wild grapevine, and if love is like wine: you are my predilection from your hands to your feet: you are the wineglass of hereafter and my bottle of destiny.  I love you forwards and backwards, and I don't have the tone or timbre to sing you my song, my endless song.  On my violin that sings out of tune my violin declares, I love you, I love you my double bass, my sweet woman, dark and clear, my heart, my teeth, my light and my spoon, my salt of the dim week, my clear windowpane moon.

      Because some liberal-minded teachers have infiltrated the classrooms and started to teach future generations about "equality," "difference," "critical thinking," and "literary merit," it has become God's will that true Christians consider removing their children from public schools. This  urlLink resolution  did not pass at a recent convention (some Commie plot, I'm sure), so I propose a compromise to ensure that Christian values remain the cornerstone of public education:  Don't listen to those literary theorists blab on about  urlLink challenging the canon . Instead, let's assemble a  real  canon of high school literature, created by none other than Our Lord and Savior. I ask you, bloggers and educators, "What would Jesus teach?" The following is a list, a work in progress, of a few books that Jesus would want our children to read:   1. The Great Gatsby   Jesus needs an update to his camel analogy. Therefore, Gatsby:East Egg::rich man:kingdom of God.   2. Kafka's works  Like Jesus, Kafka is a Jewish storyteller criticizing the existing social systems through cryptic yet memorable tales.    3. The Catcher in the Rye  Have you read his opinions on the Pharisees? Jesus hated phonies, too.   4. The Song of Solomon  Jesus would recognize the title, maybe from summer camps where he and his buddies passed around the racy scrolls after "lamps out."   5. The Old Man and the Sea  Where do we always see Jesus in the Bible? On a boat, with fishers (of men). Jesus might rewrite the text a bit, perhaps having the man use a net instead of a fishing pole, but the fundamental elements are the same.   6. Shakespeare  Everybody's gotta teach Shakespeare. Do you think the curriculum committee is going to make an exception, for Christ's sake?   7. Gulliver's Travels   You try preaching in the desert for three years, healing ungrateful lepers, then being tortured and crucified. From that perspective, Gulliver sticking snuff in his nostrils and wanting to live with horses doesn't sound so misanthropic.   8. Paradise Lost  Every college student who has had to buy a professor's book will understand the powerful pull of flattery in syllabus creation.   9. Yeats' and Blake's poetry  Sheep and shepherds...Jesus will love the imagery in these works.  So when it comes time to shape young minds by choosing literature for the classroom, I say, go with God.

      My parents sent me to a camp every summer. The camps changed every year--there was the Girl Scout horseback riding camp (my favorite), the Bible retreats ranging from "pray before meals" complacency to tent-revival evangelical intensity, whatever camp a friend's parents were sending her to--but the elements remained the same. Rainy days spent inside damp wooden cabins, ash and marshmallows in the same gooey bite, over-chlorinated swimming pools churning with Sharks and Minnows.  I never spent more than a couple of weeks at any given camp, but I always made Friends 4-Ever. We would promise to write, send postcards, be the bestest friends always, but the friendships never outlasted the memories of creaky bunk beds and campfire ghost stories.  I called my real best friend, Joni, last night. For the first time in our ten-year friendship, we live too far away to visit in a weekend. And life is busy and we work hard, we are tired when we get home, we have boyfriends who need our attention and cats for when we want to be alone, and other friends, and families who claim our vacations. And we have the best intentions.  It would have been easier, last year when I moved away from Joni, if I had seen my parents' station wagon filled with a suitcase and a Smurfs sleeping bag nestled against the back window. I might have known, then, what to expect.

      A beautiful  urlLink poem  gets to the heart of what I've been thinking lately in my English classes.   I've been so complacent in being "good" at English that I haven't really stopped to consider why I'm "good" at it, or what my moderate success in a system so fraught with inequities means about me. After reading some critics, specifically Paulo Freire and bell hooks, I started thinking. And then I wrote (condensed here, so I don't babble too much):  As a precocious ninth grade student, I determined to read all the books that mattered. I would not waste my time on popular fiction, the Stephen Kings and Mary Higgins Clarks and other large font authors who filled the alluring displays of chain bookstores. Instead, I combed library stacks and secondhand book bins for names I recognized from my literature textbook—or even better, names from my father’s high school literature textbooks. The older, the better…anything after 1960 was automatically suspect. After all, I supposed, mere endurance over time proved that enough teachers and readers had tested and approved the work as worthy of study. I had many books to read before reaching my goal; no sense wasting it on something considered marginal.   I recognize the weaknesses in the "canon" for traditional literary study now. As an adolescent and even as a more enlightened college student, though, I did not appreciate how fully the power of the English canon was embedded into my ardent “love of literature.” The language I am using to describe my youthful reading reveals a motivation that I was not consciously aware of at the time: I subconsciously wanted access to the power, the superiority, the privilege that English literature could provide. My feeling that time-tested literature was “better,” that some books “mattered” while others “wasted my time” demonstrates a dim understanding of a system of power that had determined a hierarchy of literature from the valuable and enduring to the superficial and frivolous. The canon did not fail me. My dedication to the real literature earned me success in school, entrance and a scholarship to a pretty good school, and (less tangible but more visceral) frequent recognition that I was  well read . By devoting myself to what was taught and what was read, and not challenging either, I became part of an intellectual elite. As Helen Vendler acknowledges in her defense of literary criticism, “Most people do not love what we love.”  At what price did I decide to follow this literature instead of others? What works did I dismiss in favor of the canon? What intellectual tastebuds have I blunted or lost, thanks to an early strict diet of only the “best?” Even more disturbing, why was I so driven to unquestioningly accept that the anonymous authors of mid-twentieth century textbooks knew which books were best for me to read?   For several years, I have challenged the canon in class discussions and, recently, in creating lesson plans. I want a revolutionary feminist pedagogy in my classrooms, and seek ways to bring that to my students. These readings have forced me to turn the same critical eye to my own literary foundation—my internal canon, so to speak. Freire’s restatement of Simone de Beauvoir’s argument that “the interests of the oppressors lie in ‘changing the consciousness of the oppressed, not the situation which oppresses them’” shatters my long-standing faith in literature as the solid foundation of my intellect. Some intellectual curiosity that drove me to read and love old books and well-known authors may be, in his estimation, acceptance of “the passive role imposed on” me by society. Similarly, Freire and hooks critique the mechanism of traditional education, which “minimize[s] or annul[s] the students’ creative power” (Freire) and denies “self-realization” (hooks). What, then, do I make of my academic achievements in mostly traditional classrooms?  I recognize that this self-questioning posits extreme doubts against false absolutes. There is no neat conclusion to why I read or why I began to read. But only by asking, and continuing to ask, can I challenge myself to be more than superficially radical in my pedagogy, or to do more than adopt a new canon to replace the old. I continue to ask these questions because I continue to read, even without articulating why.   Then again, they're only books. Right?

      I am just a white girl, Scotch-Irish and Southern, yet I speak a different language than my mother.  When I was a child, my mother's family spent weekends at my cousin Glo's house in Fellowship, Mississippi (you haven't heard of it). We'd all pile into cars and park them in the field behind the house. My younger cousin and I chased barn cats and kittens while the adults sat on the wrap-around porch and identified each car that drove by.  My "bed" was the fold-out couch in the living room, next to the long kitchen. The kitchen floor sloped crazily, and I loved to watch objects roll from the wood stove, under the long kitchen table, to rest by the wooden pantry at the opposite end.   On Saturday mornings, I woke to the smells of biscuits and Folger's coffee, and the sounds of two generations of Fellowship women--always women--chattering loudly. A Mississippi accent is twangier than "good" Southern accents, holding a little bit of accusation in lilting praise, a little bit of clenched teeth anger in bobbing Southern laughter. I would pretend to sleep through breakfast for as long as my hunger would let me, hoping to catch the gossip of people whose names I didn't know, but whose lineage, occupation, sexual habits, and car titles were intimately familar to the rest of my family.   "Mmm-hmmm" ("I knew she'd end up like that") "Hon, you don't even know" ("But of course you do; you can imagine") "Now, Mama..." ("Ya hear this clenched jaw? I'm telling you like it is, and you're not gonna like it.") "Hmmm." ("Don't say anymore; I don't want to hear it.")  And for days the conversations ran like this, in words and tones laced with Crisco and Co-Cola, adorned with kudzu vines and cotton crops. After a few hours at Glo's, my mother's voice became indistinguishable from the rest, and I heard a collective Mama laughing more loudly than usual, more often, and with alot more of the sharp undertones that didn't take no shit.  By Sunday night, though, on the ride back to Jackson, my mother would trade her Fellowship voice for that of the seminary student's wife--he with the years of speech study and the professional demeanor that had drained any trace of Memphis from his vocal cords. My mother's accent remained, but in the interest of correctness the tones were flattened out; she spoke her self like a bad recording made on secondhand equipment.   Twenty years later:   I visited my family recently. I drove from Atlanta to Tennessee for my twice- or thrice-yearly visit home. I'm chatting with my mom, telling her about my classes and my job and my hip new urban life, begging for her gossip about the people "from home" that we know. All is fine between us, in that awkwardly familiar way families reconnect, until my brother enters the room.  Covered with dirt from his day "on the job," working construction, he lopes in (wearing boots, of course) and starts a conversation with my mother. Then, I hear it:  "Mmm-hmmm."  "Whatcha gonna do 'bout it?" "Naw, Mama. It ain't--"  They code-switch in front of me, begin speaking the language that I might have known once, but don't speak as fluently anymore. I hear the tones and the undertones, but I can't translate exactly. This conversation has been ongoing, I can tell, and I wasn't here to be able to pick up the sense of it now.  Someone turns to me, asks a question. The flattened rhythm, the staticky, borrowed voices.  I remember that my father never spent weekends in Fellowship.

      My classmates, gorgeous creative teacher-writer-women that they are, all have blogs. And I am jealous when they mention their blogs, or something they read on another blog, or bloggity-blog-blog-blog (pardon me, I don't speak the language yet). This blog idea has become my graduating class's virtual sandbox, and I'm hangin' out on the swingset all alone.  Until now! Yes, I too have a blog, a bold, brash, bumbling blog of my very own. And you're invited to play.

      I was the second customer in Staples this morning...it is tax-free weekend, and I am preparing my first classroom to be the epitome of organization: I have the appropriate number of letter trays for homework. I have the magnetic clips for my dry erase board for the days when I use a visual aid such as a map or large graphic. No primitive Scotch tape for me, thanks very much. I have--get this--a 30-day calendar on which I can write the daily assignments...and then  erase  them. This wipe-off technology rocks! I have 2 and 1/2 yards of red polka-dotted fabric to cover a bulletin board. I have never bought 2 and 1/2 yards of fabric before in my life.  Back-to-school shopping, though, has always been a hobby for me. When I started first grade, I selected a navy blue messenger bag with the people from the "school crossing" traffic sign walking confidently across the front. There was a traffic light on the bag, too, and the different colored signals were puffy plastic disks of red, yellow, and green. They felt pliant and cool; the yellow paint on the crosswalk sign was slick against the rough blue canvas.  I filled the bag with supplies, but my favorite had nothing to do with school. My father gave me a fold-out comb with a mirror. It said, "Have comb, will travel." I could read, but the phrase never made sense to me. Who would travel? Is it Will? Does he  have  a comb, or  has  he combed? Despite the confusion, the comb was optimistic. Like the traffic sign people on my bag, the comb's cryptic message told me I was  going somewhere . I was on the move, in real school now, and even my possessions knew that I was importantly busy. Like Daddy. Like the big kids I saw in church, doing homework during Wednesday night bible study.  But school supplies are not always so happy. I can't smell a plastic lunchbox without losing my appetite--not from memories of bad cafeteria lunches, but from the lonely chaos that characterized so many of my elementary lunch breaks. The Garfield lid open to reveal a peanut butter and jelly sandwich (the crusts cut off), a bag of fruit snacks, a Hi-C if I was lucky, maybe some chips.  I didn't trade my lunches with other kids; there were no other kids around me.  My mom often left "happys" in my lunch box. She knew how lonesome those lunches were, how much I hated school. Sometimes I would get a note: "I love you! Happy day!" Sometimes it would be a sticker or a piece of candy. Sometimes she used a cookie cutter to make my crustless sandwich a heart, or a Christmas tree, or a gingerbread man--regardless of the season.  The happys generally had the opposite effect. Reminded of where I wanted to be, I looked at the school cafeteria with even more despondency. Confronted with the looping handwriting of someone who woke up at 5 am to write that she loved me, I became more certain of my classmates' hatred and ridicule.  I never told my mom that the happys weren't doing their job. I learned to lean my head back a little if I felt like crying; I learned the taste of peanut butter and swallowed tears. And I always came home smiling, ecstatic to finally be home. I thanked her for the note or the sticker, and there was another one waiting for me the next lonely lunch.  The happys, like school supplies, aren't really about how they will be used when they are needed. I won't appreciate the green clipboard every time I take notes, and I sometimes covered the note with my apple so I didn't have to read it at the bottom of my day. The actions are about optimism, about bolstering the insecure future with solid beams of "right-now" assurance. My mother didn't know if her timid daughter would be crying again by lunch, and it worried her. So, at 5 am she did her part. "I can't do anything to help while you read this" became "I love you! Happy day!"  And me? I can't see into the October slump. I could very well be sucking back tears in a cafeteria. But I buy dry erase markers and post-its and paper clips and send myself off to school with the best intentions.

      Yesterday afternoon, after a tedious day of new teacher meetings, I got an alarming phone call from my soon-to-be employer. They never received my application materials, they said. No references, no PRAXIS scores, no transcripts, nothing. Officially, this means I'm not hired. I have no job, and despite my dutiful attendance in 8 hours of meetings, I can not in fact be a new teacher.   So at 8:00 this morning I leave me apartment, cell phone in hand, to track down the paper trail of my qualifications as a teacher. It was a strange feeling, getting my transcript, explaining to a receptionist that I am really a teacher even though I haven't actually taught yet and don't have an Application File marked "Complete."  How this snafu happened in a period of 4 months during which I have spoken to a representative of the county or my school almost every week, is one problem. How I became a number is another.   Because I  was  hired. I have a room assigned to me. There are books and supplies with my name on them. I have a schedule of classes. I have an e-mail address. My principals know my name (and I'm hoping it's not just because they thought they would have to fire me a week before school starts).  "What are they going to do? Have a bunch of kids sitting in a classroom with no teacher?" My boyfriend asks, trying to convince me that I don't have to resort to plan B: wait tables or maybe start tending bar.  That consoles me, as&nbsp;does the cigarette smoked frantically as I speed&nbsp;to Headquarters with a one-inch stack of my authenticating papers in the passenger seat.  The last hurdle was an on-line "interview" called Teacher Insight. Actually a personality test, it asked probing questions like, "Why is being a teacher rewarding?" Apparently this test is scored by a computer and&nbsp;my effectiveness as a teacher&nbsp;will be based on the scores. Yikes.   How did I descend from hopeful anxiety about my teaching career to jaded cynicism about the future of education in 24 hours?   Just let me get in my classroom. Fill those desks with students; let me work with the real live people who walk in the halls. Let me teach, and let me remember this nightmare when my students start filling in the first Scan-Tron of the year.  People are more than number 2 pencils and best of four answers, aren't we?

      This improved my mood:  urlLink Church Sign Generator   Once, I saw a billboard that said simply, " Go to Church or You Will Go to HELL!"  In the middle of the hellish flames that bordered the bottom of the sign was a little cartoon sign that whispered, "Whew! It's Hot!"  Thanks for the explanation, damned billboard soul. Because of your posthumous weather reporting, I need not confuse hellfire with, say, a Maui vacation. Or the North Pole.&nbsp; Fire's hot; hell has fire; God keeps you out of it. Therefore, God is, like, your eternal air conditioner.  (They had to make it easy. The sign was in South Carolina.)

      Last night, I was taking an extended TV break from writing a convoluted, tedious paper on Chinua Achebe's use of English. My mind was scattered between  urlLink vacuous memories of high school , theories of dialogism and postcolonial language appropriation, anxiety over having to enter the real world again after graduation, and the much-too-full bottle of wine in my kitchen.   urlLink My cat, Aria  walked up to me and squeaked. I looked down. She looked back. I asked her, "Mow?" She squeaked again.  I picked her up, holding her against me with my right hand while supporting her back legs between my left elbow and forearm. She usually likes to sit and observe the world from this angle.   But not this time. She turned toward me, put her front paws around my shoulder, and squeezed with her paws while nudging her head against my neck. Purring the whole time. My cat hugged me!   Suddenly the wine was less necessary, and the television a good excuse to sit down and listen to purring for a while.

      Gathering books to take to my classroom, I came across my battered copy of  This Side of Paradise  by F. Scott Fitzgerald. I read it for the first time in the fall of 12th grade, when I still thought I would major in marine biology. By the last page, I had decided to become an English major. Actually, I decided to devote my life to F. Scott Fitzgerald. Later, I would read all his novels, his stories, his letters, and his critics. I would visit the Zelda and Scott museum in Montgomery, Alabama, and read her letters to him. I would never be able to write a good paper about him, because I couldn't stand at critical distance. I would literally dream about meeting him.  It all started with the lines in  This Side of Paradise  that I underlined when I was 16--the first time I ever underlined a book of my own that I wasn't reading for school:      It was always the becoming he dreamed of, never the being. This, too, was quite characteristic of Amory.   Long afterward Amory thought of sophomore spring as the happiest time of his life.  His ideas were in tune with life as he found it.    First, he realized that the sea was blue and that there was an enormous quantity of it, and that it roared and roared--really all the banalities about the ocean that one could realize, but  if any one had told him then that these things were banalities, he would have gaped in wonder .   'As for the well-known Amory, he would write immortal literature if he were sure enough about anything to risk telling any one else about it.'   'No, I'm romantic--a sentimental person thinks things will last--a romantic person hopes against hope that they won't.'   'Oh, Lord, what a pleasure it used to be to dream I might be a really great dictator or writer or religious or political leader--and now even a Leonardo da Vinci or Lorenzo de Medici couldn't be a real old-fashioned bolt in the world.  Life is too huge and complex. The world is so overgrown that it can't lift its own fingers, and I was planning to be such an important finger. '   'Oh, I was young, for I could turn again to you, most finite and most beautiful, and  taste the stuff of half-remembered dreams , sweet and new on your mouth.'   'I'm one of those people who go through the world giving other people thrills, but getting few myself except those I read into men on such nights as these. I have the social courage to go on the stage, but not the energy; I haven't the patience to write books; and I never met a man I'd marry. However, I'm only eighteen.'   There were no more wise men; there were no more heroes...Amory had grown up to a thousand books, a thousand lies; he had listened eagerly to people who pretended to know, who knew nothing.   Here was a new generation, shouting the old cries, learning the old creeds, through a revery of long days and nights; destined finally to go out into that dirty gray turmoil to follow love and pride; a new generation dedicated more than the last to the fear of poverty and the worship of success; grown up to find all Gods dead, all wars fought, all faiths in man shaken...    I read the underlined passages and see not just Amory and Scott and the wonderful lost generation. I see me, sixteen, feeling a little lost myself.    (My apologies for not writing much of my own words tonight; Scott always says it better.)

      There is a new radio station in Atlanta,  urlLink DaveFM . It's an "adult alternative" format, which means that the stuff I listened to as a hip, edgy young'un has now grown up to be repackaged and rebroadcast as nostalgia.  My boyfriend loves the station. He listens to it and remembers that  urlLink Dave Matthews  concert in a living room-sized club; the Jeep he had when he was 17 and the music that poured from it; the first time he heard  urlLink Blind Melon ; his days as a skate boy in a high school that was pure Garth Brooks. He wallows in the music with a faraway smile that I can't help but love.  I resent DaveFM and am starting to hate everything it stands for: the commodification of the most genuine time in my life, the insistent reminder that when I was developing my glorious uniqueness, I was no different than everyone else moshing lock-step to Pearl Jam.  I'm wary of listening too much to DaveFM, just as I'm reluctant to watch VH1's "I Love the ---" shows. I want my own memories to be  mine , not the nostalgia I'm fed. And I don't want to "overwrite" my reckless youthful abandon with new musical associations. Somehow, remembering that I used to listen to Counting Crows while being stuck in Atlanta traffic on my way to work, doesn't have the same artistic connotation as singing "Anna Begins" with the three best friends in the world in a 2 am cotton field. That shit is sacred, and this '90s nostalgia marketing is trying to homogenize it away from me.  So, in no particular order, an antidote to the Daves out there:   Joni and I sit in her 1984 Ford Fairlane, "Christine," on the way to play rehearsal. We drive through town and blare  urlLink The Lemonheads'  "It's a Shame About Ray." We buy children's barrettes for our hair, and no one else understands. I have "Confetti" stuck in my mind, and I love the rhythm, "He kinda, shoulda sorta woulda loved her if he coulda."      My boyfriend makes me a mix tape of the  urlLink Singles soundtrack . "Would" screams from his car when we drive together. It is sex and chaos and fear that we could never express, but want and need to. It is angry in ways we don't know that we are, so we rewind and listen again.       I spend a train ride to New Orleans with my family behind headphones, listening to a mix tape that was so good it had been copied and passed among at least six of my friends.  urlLink "Crazy Mary"  is our favorite song, and because there's nothing to do in my hometown but hang out and drink beer, we laugh when Eddie Vedder sings, "No L-O-I-T-E-R-I-N-G allowed / Underneath that sign always congregated quite a crowd."        My role models are  urlLink Juliana Hatfield  and Courtney Love. I make straight A's and follow directions, but I know every word of   urlLink Live Through This   and I write them on the margins of my class notes.    Maybe it is all predictable, and all the same as everyone else. Maybe I should just turn up the radio and not think so much. It's just music, I tell myself.
