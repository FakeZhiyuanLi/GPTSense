      The other night at Lake Norman was amazing. You asked me later if I liked it, and I think I mumbled some noncommittal "Yeah, it was good".  As is your custom you pressed further, inquiring as to what, exactly, I liked best. What I meant to say, somewhere between me looking away and shuffling my feet awkwardly, is that those few hours were the precise definition of an extended perfect moment. What I couldn't tell you was that your face, bathed in the light of the setting sun, was so beautiful that I had to close my eyes and bite my lip to keep from crying.  It was like the sun broke free of the clouds in that one spot, to set just for us, to confirm for me that I've finally landed in the right place.  So to answer your question, what I liked best was you. The incredible sex and the M&M cookie that followed weren't too bad, either.

      So dad and I headed out to Lake Weiss at 4am to try out the new reel I bought him for father's day. Apart from waking up at 3:30, I was pretty crunk about the entire experience. I got to drive the boat, we caught a few good sized bass, and we watched the sun make its ascent over the mountains on what ultimately became a beautiful morning in Alabama.  I found that talking openly with my dad is much easier on a boat in the dark. As always, he gave me a few tips on how to deal with women. I took notes, too, because the guy was a pimp before he and mom got married.  I observed the change in our dynamic when the sun came up with an almost bemused detachment. We've been partners in crime, allies wading into battle with my formidable mother. We give each other those side arm half hugs if physical interaction is absolutely required, but the ferocity of the love between us is undeniable. I feel more peaceful right now than I have in a while. It's good to be home.

      So I took a look at my pee, metaphorically of course, as Kenshata suggested. I need to drink more water. Purify things a bit.

      Last night I saw the movie Saved. If you can overlook the fact that Mandy Moore and Macaulay Culkin are in it, you'll laugh your happy ass off for an hour and a half. I made the mistake of drinking a lot of water beforehand, which resulted in a near miss piss myself sort of debacle. And hey, the shit is frighteningly relevant with the Bush administration attempting to turn Christian doctrine into public policy and all.   Kenshata and Anne, you'd both be all about it.

      I'm back in the ATH after a week long hiatus. Normally that would be a good thing, but Stacey just left and I'm inordinately sad about it. :( I wouldn't mind a nice "Awww" or a pat on the head right about now, but that's entirely up to you.  At any rate, it was a good weekend. I took Stacey on her first trip to the wonder that is Alabama. We saw a few notable mullets and got a lot of funny looks while we were in Walmart, but that was mostly because I insisted on touching her breasts in public. We also spent about 6 hours on James' couch watching Newlyweds reruns. That is where the seeds of my current ambition were firmly planted: I will have Nick Lachey's hair. I worked it out so it looked pretty fly this morning, but it kind of started to wilt like bad lettuce. What I need is more hold. I have like 10 various gels and waxes lined up on the counter in my bathroom. I will not rest until I have achieved his unbelievable separation and matte finish. The experiment is fixin to commence, y'all. Stay tuned.

      I just got a hair cut. It's all sorts of blond and spiky. If I had a digital camera I would take a picture so you guys could see. Actually, I wouldn't. I'd be too busy taking sex pictures. But that's neither here nor there. I need a digital camera.

      I'm really feelin the new Indigo Girls CD, hence the quote. They finally quit with the experimental bullshit and went back to what they do best. I saw them in Birmingham in April, just them and two guitars. I was blown away. I've seen them probably close to 20 times but that was by far the most impressive.  Due to the wealth of time on my hands of late I've been doing a lot of reading. There's this guy, Augusten Burroughs, and he's lived the craziest life ever. Crazy enough to write two books about, and he's only like mid-twenties. The first one, Running With Scissors, is freakin' amazing. I read it in a day. The 2nd is called Dry and I'm working on it right now. I think I like it so much because he writes like I would if I weren't constantly avoiding that whole "honest look at yourself" thing.

      They're having this show on tonight called Venom ER. It's about people getting their dumb asses bitten by snakes and having to go to the hospital. I'm unduly excited, forgive me my enthusiasm.
