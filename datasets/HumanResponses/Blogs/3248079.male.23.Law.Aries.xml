           You really know you are going somewhere when you buy an airplane ticket, and even more so with the realisation that this would be the first flight of my adult life, for its been quite some time since i was lucky enough to be let on a plane.and so, this afternoon, you can imagine my short breathedness and tunnel vision as i crept cautiously towards the counter, where i had to get my ticket from. sadly the whole experience was very anti-climatic, for i found myself back in the afternoon heat in approximatly five minutes, looking down at the ticket, wondering if this indeed was it.i even went back to the counter asking"um, is this  all i need to get on the plane?" hmmm...apparantly practical life is not as difficult as i was led to believe aferall.
     friends await, parties that can happen only if i am there,[or so i would like to imagine], and new people to woo and make them fall helplessly in love with me...oh, and have loads of fun while at it.sounds like a good plan, right?
    not so easy, mon ami, for abit about the happenings that originated from this little ripple caused by my impending arrival,or departure, depending on where you are...after the tragedy in the family in the last few days, the mood is definitly blue, and the one thing i seem to be hearing alot is that i need this vacation, mostly from my own family...for the agony of exams and hospital duties is showing on my face, and my family seems to be seeing it for once..yet i seem to be nursing a cocktail of trepedition mixed in with a little guilt...am i right in going off to party while my family is still upset,or should i mourn [read previous blog]...will everything be alright while i am not here, or would i be called a deserter later..[believe me, its been known to happen in my family]...yet i also keep on realising something that is perhaps the driving force behind this whole trip of mine...i wish to live for myself for a little while...life seems to have proven itself untrustworthy long ago, what am i waiting for? isn't it time i lived for myself, and just didnt let everything be from fear of who might say waht, and what might happen in my absence, for truth be told, i know how limited i am in performing miracles, and i wont be able to change anything that is bound to happen.if i dont live now,when would i? when i am old and cranky and bald[no comments on this bit, puhleez]
     so mustering all my confidence, and saying a fond farewell to my friends in isloo, i shall inshallah today get on a plane and begin my Project Vacation:the journey to two provinces. wish me luck!

           Generally when I speak to someone new, I always somehow slighty hope that the person who I just greeted with a shake of hand, or even a hug, would impress me in some way and leave a mark; perhaps educate me. I have been told people like me generally tend to have the radar which helps us pick out the good ones from the herd and generally be just polite but silent with those who if persued would have the largest margin of disappointing me.

    I consider all my gay friends special...they have somehow, in one way or another, bought to life the divas of this world, whether from the media or real life.They are charming, amazingly talented, and very smart.But what leaves me impressed the most is the chamelion quality of my friends to be able to impersonate almost any actress, whether its her way of talking, her style, or the way they walk or even dance.

     I am simply mystified, confused and bewildered.forever this thought is ingrained into our minds that men are to act like men and women as women...anything else crossing the boundries would be a big no-no...yet when I see all these amazing people I can not help but admire their vivaciousness, their strength, and their comfortablility with themselves to be actually able to do all these acts in front of people.I have no idea what to make of it when the on-screen drama queens do it...whether its right or wrong, moral or immoral, for what feels immoral is such a hit in our society that it makes it moral. And after all, when its done by near naked, albeight slighty chubby,girls or [gasp!] women, in the most flexible dance manouvers ever,flaunting their femininity,what straight ,hetro-sexual man would not want that, and what gay man would not wish to look like that? and honestly, I have seen gay men accomplish that by far more success than perhaps the true creators of such moves.And I have seen straight men fall for them just as hard as they would for a woman.But then again, as long as they are content with who they are, and have accomplished the task of being one with one's alter ego, what better formula to live happily by?hmmm...i guess what i am trying to say is....damn...i thought i had it figured out.
  

    Ps...i sadly lack the talent,and as such can not join in on such humor, but I am honest enough to admit that it does seem beautiful, and the antics, when meant as such, hilarious.I may not be able to do it, but I do admire it.If you are thinking any low of me after my admission,i can only say, I am but only impressed by a remarkable talent.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you had asked me a week ago how life was going, i would have said its at a standstill...i did not know what to do with my days, since my law degree is, shall we say, on a bit of a hold due to alot of complications...details redundant..and here i sit today, looking back, and am amazed at this past week. one phone call was all it took for everything to change.and all i did was recive that call and say hello.&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Something i wrote a long time back, and shown to a friend just to ask for his opinion gave me opportunities i did not even know about. i was called by a renowned company to write for them on a regular basis, and one of the local hit radio stations asked me for an audition based on the fact that i spoke well on the phone. good thing i did not cough during the conversation, or they would have found out my voice had its extra sexy quality only due to flu.by the end of that call, i also had a hint of a possibility for writing for a newspaper as well.&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The company, i have joined, just got back from a day of...work! audition given, called back to record a demo!WIPO finally sends over my law certificate which very loudly proclaims i have successfully completed their courses!see, now i have proof! 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now here's the tricky part...i can be all drama queen about it, and wonder at fate and luck and how kind its been to me for the last week and be all... gushy[god i hate that word] , but i am sick of being all nice about it...all i am going to say is, well, its about bloody time!all those stupid lines of silver linings and daybreak after dark, well, finally! 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It feels good to wake up and have a purpose; it feels good not to be sitting around waiting for the day to end.now i have a deadline to meet!

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You’d think by the time you turn seven you would have a better idea when you are being made a fool of. I did not. Not when it was my sister Raheela, only three years older to me and considered so trustworthy by my family that I was allowed to play out when she was around.&nbsp;I can still remember that day so well. The July heat was at its peak, no sign of rain, and nothing provided relief. It was my birthday; I had just turned seven, and my father had bought me this frilly pink frock which I saw for the first time that day as my mother was ironing it, and I fell in love with it. I didn’t ask if I was allowed to wear it though, as it was for that evening’s party, painstakingly organized by my mother. There it was, on a hanger, swaying gently. The tiresome churning of the old fan overhead provided no comfort from the stifling heat. I sat on my parents’ bed, staring at the silent dance of the pink frock for most of the morning, with my eyes in the direction of the room it hung in even when we were sitting for lunch. After lunch, it was back to my old perch for yet some more frock-ogling. I kept on staring at that frock, and went on wondering if that frock was really for me, or was it just a joke, an evil joke, a heinous joke on me, and it was actually meant for Raheela. My paranoia escalated with time, hiding reason. I had no just cause for doubting my parents, but I remembered the love they gave my sister the day before when she came home with an excellent report card from school. I somehow thought it was a gift for her. My parents had never celebrated my birthday before. This was the first time since my father had recently been transferred here and the new neighbours had a habit of making a big fuss about these things. It was a friendly war of who can kill the other first with sweetness. My mother had a new mission in life… to be a social success of the middle class suburbia. 
&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The swaying of the frock put me under its spell, and I fell in a hole of paranoia that felt unending. 
&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Was it for me, or not? For me, or not? Mine, not mine? Where did it come from? Who wore it before me? Was it new? How could I tell if it was new? Could I touch it? Will anyone be angry with me if I did? Is it really mine? When will the time come when I finally get to wear it? Is it really pink, or a light shade of that colour Amma taught me the there day? Was what that colour called? M-A-U-V-E? Is it really mauve? I hope it is not mauve, because Abba once said he did not like the colour mauve. If he did not, why would he buy me a dress in mauve? Does this show he does not love me anymore? Does he love Raheela more? No! That can’t be, can it? He calls me his gurya, his doll. It has to be pink. Yes, it is definitely pink! How will I look in it? Will I be able to walk in it? It looks so stiff; the layers all pushed out like an inverted bowl. That bow on the side is so nice! With two sashes to go behind the back. Will they reach far back, enough to cover my waist? What kind of shoes should I wear with it? The school ones, or the ones that dadi Amma gifted to me on last choti Eid?&nbsp;  
&nbsp; 
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  And all the while, my hands cupped my face, my face wet with sweat, hair limpid, the fan groaning, giving no relief against the heat.&nbsp; 
&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have been blessed with a very caring Amma. Even though we were two, she still cared as if each was an only child. She was aware of every flicker of emotion on my face as I sat there, staring up at that dress; with the way my eyes would not let go of the dress wherever it went, and she knew exactly what I was going through. Taking pity on me, she came into the room only long enough to put the frock inside the closet so I won’t yearn for it so much, but when her eyes met mine, her hand stopped midway. You shoot an animal to end its suffering, my mother gave me life by bringing the frock down from where it hung, down to a level where I could touch it, smell its starch-smell if I wished to. I was so afraid to touch it… what if it got dirty? I looked down at my hands first, and then silently up to my mother, who smiled at me, giving me her tacit permission to touch this apparel from heaven. Hesitatingly I reached out and touched the hem… it was rough and frigid. I pulled my hand back, my curiosity appeased. But then she turned to put it inside the closet, and automatically I tried to say&nbsp; “No”, but could not… &nbsp;all I came up with was a keening sound… perhaps louder than a shout; it was a sound from the heart, all yearning imprisoned in one word. My mother stopped. Turned towards me. Looked into my eyes. Noticed my outstretched hand, pointing towards the frock. She looked up to the clock. So did I. The shorter hand was on three, while the longer one was on eight. She sighed silently, and then looked back at me, gave me a smile, and said “gurya, do you want to wear the frock now?”&nbsp; 
&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Did I hear her right? Was the time finally here? Now was I finally going to be able to show everyone how pretty I was? Will daddy love me most when he sees me?&nbsp;  
&nbsp; 
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  I nodded so hard I almost fell off of the bed.&nbsp; 
&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ritual began. I was bathed, and then covered with talcum dust. My hair first oiled and then brushed till the hair-roots screamed out in pain. Two pigtails, one on each side, bound by pink rubber bands. The dress finally over my body [although a bit constricting in the chest] and dadi amma’s gift shoes over white socks. Gurya was ready.&nbsp; 
&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Amma was very busy. She still had to set things up, and children of the neighbours were to arrive by six, when the heat would let up slightly. This party was her way to show the neighbourhood that the paracha family was finally beginning to do well, they were no longer the hicks from Kohat with rough ways, but was now becoming a part of the neighbourhood. The promotion Mr. Paracha got recently could now let her be a bit loose with the strings, and celebrate birthdays and such other occasions like others in the neighbourhood did. A lot to do. Now who can take care of gurya while I am busy? Hmm. “oh Raheelay, come here!”, and left the room. Pashto dialect always adds an “a” to a male name, and “ay” to a female one, and my mother, though might be trying to modernize her surroundings, would never play with the language!&nbsp; 
&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Raheela did not appear, she huffed, muttered something under her breath, and left the room in her search. I was left alone if front of the mirror, turning this way and that, humming a few bars of some song in my mind. However, when Raheela entered the room, her gasp was enough to tell me she was seeing that dress for the first time. Then her lips pursed, arms were crossed against her chest, her fair complexion went read, and mean green eyes gave me a vengeful stare, while I stood there, transfixed, not enough breath in me even to cower. If I knew her, she was definitely thinking of something that would make me wish I were dead!&nbsp; 
&nbsp; 
“Gurya, you look great!” se said, while her eyes meant otherwise.&nbsp; 
&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All I could do was nod at the image of her in the mirror. I could not turn. 
She looked around, looking for something, thinking, swaying side to side, like she did when she was deep in thought. She never paid much attention to me, so it was easier to observe her. Suddenly she brightened up. She had just gotten an idea.&nbsp; 
&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “You know gurya, since it is your birthday, I will let you ride my bicycle. You are old enough. Would you like that? She added, as an afterthought. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My ears could not believe what they had just heard. How could Raheela possibly agree to let me ride her two wheel bicycle? That was one thing she had complete control over, and would never let anyone ride it except for her new friend from the house on the other side of the street called Samia. And even that not very often. I looked at her reflection in the mirror. Her expression hadn’t changed but it seemed easier to believe her somehow…since the dress was for me after all, maybe she means well as well. What could go wrong? And to miss the opportunity of riding that heavenly ride, all red and black, with the word sohrab written in gold on the middle bar… I had to do it just once. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I nodded my head yes. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Good”, she said with a smile, “consider this my gift for your birthday… its something you have always wanted to do”. I smiled back. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She took my hand and led me outside in the street. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The seat of the bicycle was quite tall for my height. Raheela had inherited the bicycle from our father when he had gotten himself a motorbike. Raheela shooting in height so could easily manoeuvre it. I, on the other hand, was still very short, so when I finally managed to sit on the seat, pink skirt ruffling and settling around me, I could hardly touch the pedals with the tip of my toes. She adjusted the screw under the seat and the seat whooshed down, completely coming down. My feet were now permanently on the pedals. Raheela unhinged the stand supporting the bicycle, and I started my first ride on a bicycle. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While she held the bicycle I began to pedal, slowly round and round on a wobbly path in the small front yard. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am going to fall! I am going to fall! Any minute now they will let go of the bicycle and I will fall. Will they let go? They can’t let go! It’s my birthday! This is my present. From her. To me. Look at me go! Look at me! I am flying! Look at my shadow! I am flying over my shadow! Look! My shadow won’t break when the cycle runs over it. My new dress! Look at my new dress! Look at it bellow out! I wish daddy could see me now. He would be so proud of me. He will love me the most then. No one could ever compare to me. It’s so sunny, but I am not feeling hot! The sun cannot catch me!&nbsp; I smiled. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Raheela let go of the bicycle. How could she!?! I knew she wanted me to fall and ruin my dress! I wish daddy was here. He loves me and would never have let go. He is not like Raheela. She wants me to die. She wants daddy all to herself. But today daddy will love me the most. And she will never be able to change that!!! My smile remained intact. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The power, the rush, to control that machine. I will never forget that. I was riding a bicycle, and I was doing it on my own. I did not need anyone. I could take care of myself. And my dress was the prettiest, and I was the boldest that day. Daddy would love me the most. Oh definitely yes! 
&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I failed to notice raheela’s smirk. I failed to notice her departure from the front yard. It was a while before I noticed I was alone. Going round and round. Who cared about Raheela? It was good she had left. Now she would not be able to hurt me. Maybe she likes me too. Maybe she does not want to see me spoil my pretty dress. I looked down; making sure the dress was ok. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Raheela came out for a moment; saw me going round and round then went back in, calling out to Amma that I was fine. She did not give any details. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was now alone. Going round and round. i kept on revolving around an imaginary pole for quite some time.&nbsp;The sun seemed to be catching up&nbsp;with me. I was beginning to feel hot. I felt a trickle of sweat run down my spine. The shadow soon began to look boring. I began to get dizzy. Going round and round was not fun anymore. The bicycle began to feel like no big deal. I wanted to stop. I did not know how to. I could not stop pedalling, for fear I would fall and ruin my dress…then where would I be…amma would be angry, daddy annoyed, and I would ruin it all.&nbsp; 
&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Round and round I went. I began to feel sick. I could not cry out. I could not speak.I tried so hard, but I could not.&nbsp;I never knew how to talk...I could only use sign language. There was nobody there to see me speak. Nausea set in. the world went round and round. I was all alone. I began to whimper. No one came to check. No one cared. No one loved me. Tears began to fall. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I cried, and pedalled. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the end, it was my father, coming back from the office, who saved me. He stopped the bicycle and pulled me down. I vomited on my new dress. I could not stand. My legs would not respond. The dress was ruined. Everything was destroyed. Daddy won’t love me anymore. The party was destroyed. Nobody appreciated my old seen-before dress, and no one could ever make me smile again. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw Raheela’s face as she came out and saw me in my father’s arms. She ran towards us giving explanations as daddy turned towards her with me. After that, I fainted. 
&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The party was a success after all. After a lot of crying, and another bath, change of clothes that I thought old and unworthy of comparison to the previous apparel, guriya was once again considered socially acceptable, and I was rushed into the small drawing room, this time told not to move. People began to arrive and my parents made such a deal about it all that I felt treasured sans the pink dress. I wished so bad if I had worn that dress though. I wished it throughout that night and many nights to come, and each time it would push me away from forgiving my sister. Ultimately, the dress was forgotten, but the scar of what I went through that afternoon forever stayed in my memory. 
&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kids can be very cruel; my sister taught me that. Perhaps their cruelty is worse than that of the adults… they have angelic faces while they act so cruelly. And worse of all, the victim of their meanness is a child itself. They are the ones&nbsp;who fall the hardest, and perhaps never recover.&nbsp;
