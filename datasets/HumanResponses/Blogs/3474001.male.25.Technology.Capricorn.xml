      Well here it is.  This is the first entry into the journal that I have been trying to start for years.  I really don't have much to say right now.  I'm at work, and I want to leave.  I am the Systems Administrator here at Phoenix Worldwide Industries, Inc.  I work with my buddy Adrian.  It's a cool job, lots of responsibility, but who the fuck cares.  I want to get drunk.  After work I'm gonna go home and try to go to the gym.  TV sucks now that summer is starting, so I really don't have any excuse not to go.  I have no money, no weed, and no girlfriend, so what else am I gonna do??  I'll write more later when I have better shit to say.

      I have never seen a concentration of black people like this in my entire life.  South Beach was taken over this last weekend for "Hip-Hop Weenkend" or whatever you want to call it.  Man, if I was black it would have been the best weekend ever.  People were everywhere, cars filled the streets, and the police were out in full force.  If you were a black guy, and you weren't wearing a sports jersey or an enormously large white t-shirt, you were not representing.  You also had to be driving a new Hummer, a hot bike, or an old caddy pimped out with big ass rims (20" nothing less).  I went skateboarding around town friday night, and I saw a car with some of the biggest rims I had ever seen and I thought to myself, "Damn, what size are those!?", and my question was answered when I saw the sign on the back window that said 27".  The driver must have been asked that very question many times, finally resorting to the public display of the diameter.  While I do appreciate a good party, I decided to travel north each night for a holiday pub crawl.  Friday and Saturday night we went to Riverfront, and we had pretty good time.  Friday Tepper and I decided to drink scotch, since it was the only liquor I had in my house.  Scotch always makes the night interesting.  Three drinks in, i'm pretty buzzed.  I ran into Lizzette somewhere and we hung out for a while.  After about 20 mins, she asked me if I had any white, and regretfully, I say no.  I made the mental note: "Buy coke, call Lizzette".  I will work on that.  I then ended up meeting a few other girls while trying to dance in Dicey Riley's.  I slowly danced my way over to this group of 4 girls, very smoothly of course because Whiskey Matt is ice cold when it comes to gettin' the ladies.  I must have caught the attention of this blonde girl who wasn't really that cute, but words were exchanged and she then asked me to buy her and her friend a shot of Jager.  So I did, which is rare because I usually don't buy girls drinks.  It's not because I'm cheap, it's just that I usually don't have to.  So I give her the shots, and then I see her friend, who I thought was pretty cute.  I guess we started talking, maybe did some dancing, and the next thing I know we're making out.  We do that for about 45 whiskey minutes, which in real time is undeterminable, and the next thing I know the lights come on and we all go outside.  The blonde friend then says something about me going back home with them, but for some reason I thought that was a bad idea, and all I wanted to do was pass out in my bed.  This ended up being a very wise drunken decision because I was a mess.  In the car ride home I got the hiccups for a good 15 minutes.  I fucking hate the hiccups.  The next night we go back to laudy and I call Sam, the makeout girl.  She didn't answer so I left a message or five. Later in the night I went back into Dicey's and I see her there.  "Two more jager shots, please."  I find out that she's 19 years old, goes to USF in Tampa, and began a pretty respectable drinking habit at the age of 12.  Jackpot.  So we hang out, talk, make out, and at the end of the night I think I'm money.  I didn't get that drunk because I didn't want to be sloppy.  I also wanted to perform like a champ, so at last call, I pop half a viagra.  I have never done that before, so I did this thinking that in about 45 minutes this shit would kick in and I'd be good to go.  Well, it actually kicked in after about 4 minutes.  So I say to the girl, "what are we doing now?", and she then goes on to tell me that she has to go back to her sister's and that we will have to get together tomorrow.  Bummer.  I try all the sweet talking I can muster, but it does not work.  Walking back to my car, I accepted defeat, but my penis would not, at least not for another hour...  Mental note: "Buy coke and Viagra, call Lizzette."
