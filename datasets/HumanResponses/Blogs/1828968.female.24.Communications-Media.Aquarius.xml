       I cannot believe it.   Heiniously busy yesterday. Stayed up all night the other night just to finish the script. Turned in at about five in the effing morning and had to wake up at eight.  And I still have to write tons more before Tuesday leaps off the table.  But after that...relative freedom, meaning, that the boss is away but certainly the work isn't. Arrgh.

       JUKEBOX QUEEN   She took up my afternoon. My morning was spent trying to contact The Boss for one thing or the other.  And it's not over yet. Fifteen pages of television script by 10p.m. Sweet Heavenly Father.  Raining outside. My stomach's grumbling and there's nowhere to eat.  Bless this day.

       The hour turned into four...   Damn damn damn.  Cigarettes: 2; Potato Chips: 80 effing grams; Work done: Yes, yes, yes!!!!  Ate chicken, again. Nowhere else to go here at this time of night. Meanwhile, HE is forcing me to eat more potatochips -- as if I needed fattening up. HE says for me to log out now so I will. Fine!  More to go, tomorrow. Ouch.

       An hour more.    Cigarettes: 1; Texts from a ghost: 5 (um, kinda weird and sudden too)  My guess is somebody put him up to it. Probably The Girl. Just to, you know, create chaos in my orderly universe. Why oh why? I mean, why now? And why is he asking about HIM? Fishing, more like.  Baffling. Gotta have one more cig to think things over while HE’s not looking. Hmmm.  It’s not that I’m having well, you know, regrets or anything. I’m way past them when it comes to THIS. But then, I’m sure there’s always what-ifs.   I refused to see him the last time I had a chance. For two reasons: HIM and well, me. I don’t why I’m so…hell.   And here I am, waiting for some more apparitions, kahit sa text lang.

      Too early to have anything to say but then this might be my only chance to blog today. I am going to try and put a website next week. I wanted to today but then I won't be able to get any work done so next week it is...

      Haaay. Another day.  I went to Greenbelt yday. Ha d ameeting at Seagafredo. Their hot chocolate is so thick and creamy you practically have to unclog your throat afterwards. I unclogged mine with their Margherita Pizza, which is so thin you actually have to eat several slices before declaring that your stomach is bursting with cheese and tomatoes. The meal cost me nothing of course. Buti na lang as I had 20 bucks with me when I arrived there. :)  Didnt get a chance to blog last night. Went to my mom's 'cause it's her birthday and I'm soooo happy (not to mention so full). I'm so happy because, well, basta.   Yun lang... nothing interesting happening to me at the moment kasi e.

      Monday morning. Jesus.  My computer is at it again. It has a mind of its own and, like me, it does not like Monday mornings. Anyway, more time for me to blog.  Just thinking of this afternoon makes me feel exhausted. I have a meeting at 1pm in Pasig, then have to rush fat bottom to Makati by 145pm. Then, there's a taping at 4. And I have to be in Quezon City for my mom's birthday dinner around 7.  Mondays are a bitch.

      My first ever blog entry.   Thanks to Yayie for a very good suggestion. *Mwah*  A week ago I read Bridget Jones The Edge of Reason. I haven't actually read the first book but then I've watched the movie on video so I was eager to get to know more about what Bridget is up to. Read it in one sitting. Read through the night in fact. Now I want to read the first book. Teehee.  I watched The Italian Job last night. Of course, testosterone red alert talaga but anyways I enjoyed it, as it's free. Our boss treated us (me, Joks, and Sheryl, an officemate) kasi he's having a so-called mid-life crisis at kailangan niya ng kasama else, baka magkamali at magkasala pa.   Kaya yun.   I'm not looking forward to this week which I feel will prove to be a hellish one for me as boss is leaving for Melbourne in gasp! EIGHT days and I have to finish two scripts not to mention advance column articles before he leaves. Where did the time go? I knew he was leaving  a month ago pa. Panic, panic, panic.  Anyway. Back to work...and it's Sunday.

       Another Monday.   Sigh. Two more days before I can see HIS face again.  It's somebody's birthday. Served my greeting already so I've done my duty.  I would very much like to tell him to MOVE-the-Fart-ON but he, of course, never listens. It's been four years, honey. Oh well, never mind.  Happy birthday, anyway.

      WHEW.  No post in three days! Tuesday was for nitpicking details and last-minute instructions. Wednesday was for some work and going to the mall. Thursday I spent with myself and my family.  And now Friday. Three solid days without HIM and I'm already wilting.

       Another Monday.   This is not a happy day.   HE leaves tomorrow for Melbourne. And I, I will be left alone. With nothing to occupy my time except self-loathing and daydreaming about things I could never have.  I wish...

       Thank God it's Friday.   Well, technically it's already Saturday but what the hell.  Only three days to go and I'll be seeing HIM again. I do wish it was sooner.  Since it is payday, Sheryl (my office mate) and I went to Quiapo to shop for really cheap whatnots. I felt like splurging so I bought myself five bangles which cost 70 pesos altogether. Ha! Those people who think Greenhills tiangge stuff (where they sell it for 50 pesos apiece) are bargains are totally wrong. I even heard one foreigner remark excitedly to her companions (about Greenhills) "I could live here!"  Of course, those who are in the know would exclaim, why Quiapo? Why not go to Tutuban instead? Well, dear readers. I do not have a death wish. I went to Quiapo at the only available time I had which was at 3 p.m. on a Friday. Going to Divisoria would mean fighting a desperate battle with traffic and a huge crowd when I only had less than three hours to shop.   Why you ask. My, my. Interested, aren't you? (Actually, I only wish you were interested enough to read through the whole entry...teehee)  Because (drum roll please) I had a shooting. Not the violent kind with the blood and the smell of gunfire, please. I had to do the grooming for a senatorial candidate for a political advertisement that we're doing. O di ba? Bonggga! I'm not really a make-up artist. I am actually a writer for a TV show but was asked to step in because, miracle of all miracles, I know how to apply make-up myself.  But that wasn't always the case. Back in college, my idea of make-up was a tube of lipstick. I didn't know that it could turn me from drab to fab in just under 10 minutes. I never used to wear make-up except on very special occasions. But, thanks to Debbie (my very own make-up sensei), I learned the art of making myself pretty enough to face the world.  Don't get me wrong. I'm not exactly that hideous but suffice it to say, make-up makes me look cuter and makes me feel a lot more confident about myself. And so, I found myself, at 9 in the evening, applying moisturizer on the dark face of our client, the Senator. I've done it twice before on him and today (or yesterday, for that matter) I was particularly pleased about the results. Thank heaven for small favors.  Well there. I've run out of stories to tell. Bukas naman. Hasta mañana! Tama ba yun? Anyway, I'll keep you (whoever you are) posted!

       Curses.   The reason why my previous post is so short and, to my dismay, grammatically incorrect is that I was so bummed out about having to go to work on a very warm and sunny day that's fit for going to some beach to relax and submerge in the cool waters of the Pacific Ocean.  But, there goes my life. However, no complaints. It's just that I feel so sleepy and want to drop off zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.  Ooooppps. Sorry.   I meant to talk about my visit to Cavite and my godson, Chino. Ang kulit. Ang cute. Sigh. Oh god I am so sleepy that it's all I could do to not fall face first into the keyboard. 'Til next time. Darn.

      So. I am not in Cavite right now. I am still in the office, sneaking a blog while mailing an officemate some stuff I just finished. Why, you ask. Yesterday, Charry (my wonderful officemate) and I were all set to go to her place in Dasma. But then, lightning struck, and the opportunity to earn money intervened. Add to that was her unfulfilled responsibilities that she definitely have to finish. And of course, I do have some loose ends to tie up also before I can have my weekend of fun with a real, live baby, who is, by the way my godson. We are still slaving away. Hopefully, though, we can make the 4pm bus to Cavite and be off on a much-needed holiday for me and an urgently necessary homecoming for her.  HE called yesterday afternoon and I am so glad I let him bring the phone. We were texting up until around 4am and I finally let him be because he was set to shoot an interview just then.  Me, at around that time I just finished reading a book from my teenage years that another officemate lent me. It was hard to sleep because I missed him so badly "it's like a constant stomachache." I know I read that somewhere I just can't remember where. Anyway, here I am, talking to nobody in particular. I'm the only one here in the office. Later on, I will head for Makati and window shop 'coz that's about all I can afford. Friday (payday) is soooo far away I can hardly bear it. {Must resist temptation to get a credit card, must resist temptation....argggghhhhh}

      Well, well, well. It's been ages since I last visited my blog -- I even forgot my own username and password. Geez. Anyway, I'll tell you now, this new entry is borne of boredom. HE left yesterday afternoon for Vancouver and won't be back for another ten days. To me, that's an eternity. Days stretch out in seemingly endless torture... I know, I know, it's not healthy and it's not exactly the way I usually am. But I'd just like to mope around.  At least now, he brought my mobile phone with him so I can contact him anytime I want. And he can take photos.  I think he's still asleep. I haven't heard from him since nine in the morning and it's 3pm now. Wait, you say. You thought this was my blog, not his. Well, you're right. Thing is, he's an integral part of me and whether or not my COSMO friends out there think this is proper behavior for a fun, fearless female like me, I simply do not care anymore. Hand me that chocolate!!! Later though, I'm going to Cavite and stay over my office mate's house and play with her son. I've had baby lust for months now but then... So, I have to psyche myself up to have fun for the next few days. It will definitely include shopping for a brand new pair of jeans. I want to buy something nice that will last for years but then again, the price tag would just kill me. Bargains are my best friends, see.  I have never, and could never, purchase something that has a four-digit price tag unless it's a phone, a pair of good shoes, or a gadget that I truly desire. Then again, I may have no other choice.  I do hope that the Linea Italia store in Megamall still has the 70% sale. Otherwise, I'd probably resort to buying 400-peso jeans again and use it for three to four months. I will sign off now or else, take root in my chair in front of the PC. Let me take a walk, a cigarette, and I'd probably be back tonight or tomorrow, at the latest.  I notice that on my last entry (Sept 8) HE has gone on an out of the country trip though I can hardly remember where. Oh well. Ciao.

       So there.   A new look to my blog. I like this template. So serene...and it so connotes what I have in mind these days.  Funny, a friend asked me yesterday how I could even think of leaving the city and living in an unexciting rural town for the rest of my life. I've never really thought of my eventual transfer into a quiet rural setting as a drastic change in my life. I do not crave parties and even shy away from them. Though I prefer to work at night, I oftentimes get really sleepy at 9 in the evening. I am tired of the pollution, the noise, the chaos, the time pressure that living in the city inevitably brings.  I have spent a week living beside the sea. I must admit, thought, that that time frame could hardly prepare me for long-term rural living. But I have always been an adaptable sort of person. I can manage. I will. I have always dreamt of someday living (or working) in a beach resort. And I will get both dreams fulfilled in one lifetime. As an added bonus, of course, I have Joks beside me always.  As for the new look to my blog, I have decided to change it because, well, I am getting tired of the old one (which, I think, was called Herbert). This one, is called Harbor. I am glad that there are new templates available now. Last year, there were only six designs from which you could choose. Anyway, I had a hell of a time trying to figure out where to put my links and whatnots. Geez. Iba na talaga pag 'di marunong ng hard code eh. I had to go at it blindly. I must have republished a dozen times before finally getting it correctly. Buti na lang, I finally figured it out.

       Whew!   After the great expanse of the ocean, I feel oddly claustrophobic about being in the city once again.  I had a great weeklong vacation, the BEST I think, in my whole life.  There were days I spent almost entirely swinging on a hammock by the sea. Heaven...  And as I have yet to learn how to post pictures here on blogger, ye, dear readers, must settle for this, an idea which I got from Debbie...    Top 10 Best Things About My Trip to Bacolod    10. My first vacation in more than 3 years of working for the same company. 9. An authentic tan. 8. White sand, all mine, no entrance fees, no accommodation fees, no swimsuit requirements. 7. Night swimming. I found, that if I swam at night in the ocean, bubbles appear as bits of diamonds and pearls in the water as it reflects the light of the moon. Ü 6. A 45-minute plane ride from Manila to the Bacolod City airport. 5. I lost weight from eating almost purely fish for a week. 4. Warm reception from Joks' family. Ü 3. 8 Days without work, without thinking about work, without fretting about work! 2. Reading all the mystery novels I could get my hands on while sitting in a hammock on the beach all day. 1. Being with my one and only love for 8 straight days. My idea of Heaven.

       No more time.   I leave, in exactly 11 hours and thirteen minutes. I have just finished four articles in six hours. I ate three tuna open-faced sandwiches which I made with my own hands.  I am worried. What if the plane crashes? Yung nanay ko kasi, tumawag ba naman kahapon sabi nanaginip daw siya about me. Masama raw. And, ayaw niya sabihin kung ano exactly yung dream niya. Damn.  What if I die tomorrow?  Though I think I can't do anything about it if it's my time to go, I would have liked to stay for a little bit more.  Gusto ko pang magka-anak. Gusto ko pang makilala ang parents ni Joks. Gusto ko pang mabuhay.  Halata bang ninenerbiyos ako?  Di bale, pagbalik ko, pag-aaralan ko ang maglagay ng pictures dito sa blogger. Sana po hindi pa ako kunin ni Lord.

       3 tulog na lang.   Three more days and I'll be in heaven.  Three more days and I'll be in beach paradise. I just hope this friggin' storm fades away by then.  And yet, before heaven, there must be hell. I am doomed to fire off another one of my miraculously fast scripts before I leave.  So I'll do that in between packing and fretting about my trip. No sweat. Yeah, right.  Oi! Debbie, if you're reading this, some tips????  I read your blog by the way and I must say, it IS the Debbie I know and love. Buti ka pa you're so...eloquent. And I know that you have so much to write now that you're in a new land and experiencing new things.   Anyway, this will probably be my first and last blog this week. I'll update my adoring fans (haha) next week when I get back from Bacolod. Walang internet doon sa place na pag-stay-an namin so I'll have to rein everything in until I get back to civilization.  Have to dash off, I hear my deadlines calling...

       It's like a rug being pulled from under your feet.   Forgive me for I have no desire today to ponder on my country's growing problems. I do have one thing to say about the current count: too early to tell.  Anyway. For now, my problems take center stage.   I have been promoted. And my slaray slashed dramatically. If profanity is just allowed here I would have broken it out in three different dialects.   Why oh why now? And why oh why ever?  The irony of it all is sickening. She says there is little doubt that I am good, and I do great work. So why am I being punished and being given a bigger responsibility. The present work because it is nominal, also gives nominal pay.  It just looks good on paper.  I need the money. Don't we all? But I am desperate.  Bummer day. Bummer life.

       Today, our country's future is in our hands.   And I'm not just being poetic, patriotic or pathetic. Today, being national elections day when more than half of the country's population should have cast their votes and took a stand, the power really, is in our hands.  Unfortunately, for reasons well beyond my control, I was not able to cast my vote. And I am still kicking myself for it. At least, I am remorseful. Others who, like me, didn't endure the long lines at the polling precincts are, I can take a guess, feeling pretty smug and proud of themselves right this minute.  It used to be that I didn't believe that one tiny vote from little old me could change the world. And, I'm right. It didn't. But only because there were more who were like me then, and even more now.  In the last presidential elections, six years ago when I was but 18 and experiencing for the first time the election fever, I voted for a man who, from the start, didn't look like he was a winner. He did not win, and this year, he ran again. And it looks like he wouldn't win either.  Haay.If only my kababayans valued integrity more than popularity. If only my kababayans knew that one's vote is never wasted on a candidate who stayed at the bottom part of all the surveys and ratings. If only my kababayans understood that one should never pick the lesser evil. If only my kababayans believed that the surest way to success for our nation is to elect honest, incorruptible, and dedicated leaders.   How can a movie actor, who played numerous hero-type roles in his epic films solve the problem of poverty when for the majority of his years on earth, he was living in reel time? True, he suffered from a brief period of poverty but for many years after that, wasn't he practically rolling in dough and fame for the many movies my kababayans loyally patronized? I shudder to think how he will resolve the Mindanao conflict -- perhaps by forcing the Christians and Muslims to shake hands and hug and greet each other "Brother!" just like in the movies.  Now for the lady. While browsing through my alma mater's yearbooks, I saw her picture when she was a teacher of economics at the Ateneo. She may or may not bring the Filipino people out of grinding poverty. I know that three years is too short a time to judge whether she has done well for our country. But, clearly, she is trying, regardless of intrigues. I only hope she lives up to her promises. Gusto ko lang naman makita na because of what she did, siguro 10 or 20 years from now, we will begin to be better as a nation.   I know that a drastic and complete change will never happen in my lifetime. But I'd like to see a President who will take us one step at a time to a better future.  But wait, I have to go. I will continue pondering tomorrow.

       Labor day.   I wonder why the look of the blogger post-creator reverted back to the old interface. I was kinda enjoying the newer one. Hmmm.  National elections draw to a close. I don't know who to vote for yet. I don't even know if I can still vote kasi I didn't have a chance to re-validate for a voter's ID before. I wish I could say there's hope yet for this country but the people who are probably going to win are those who won before and did nothing good for us.  Dapat siguro, palitan lahat ng empleyado ng gobyerno. Pati mga public officials. Lahat dapat bago, pati sistema. Pati mamamayang Pilipino. We need a clean slate. Kaso, di nga naman pwede. So, tiis-tiis na lang. Sayang. Pinoy pa naman tayo.

      Freedom of expression.  Yay! Again, I would like to thank Yayie for urging me to enable the comments feature in my blog. And she has posted comments! Mwah! Anyway, Yay, I read that Silver Swan Worcestershire Sauce thing you wrote in your blog and am intrigued. Where do I get it? Wala kasi dito sa supermarket na malapit sa office e.

But, thanks to  urlLink Crazy Fruit Pie Lady , who also introduced me to the wonders of blogging, I have enabled the comments feature.  She e-mailed me just now and I'm very grateful. Ladida.

       Not Yahoo.   I am insanely jealous. I read  urlLink Crazy Fruit Pie Lady's  blog and she mentioned being given a free update to 100MB mailbox. My officemate happily told me she was also given that privilege. Well, why is MY mailbox still a measly 4MB????  Grrr. I am going to complain. That's it. I really am. Now if I can just find out how...

       Sick   To explain my absence of, erm, 13 days, well, I was sick. I hate to admit it especially after the last post with me declaring to all the cyber world that I am not weak. Well, of course, I meant that philosophically, not physically.  As for the nature of my illness, I better not say exactly, it makes me so much more mysterious that way...HA! Just that it required a trip to the hospital and cost more than I could afford. Jeez. The world is sometimes so unfair...  *Sigh*  Okay, the fact is, I really haven't been sick all those two weeks. I was sick for five and the rest could be blamed either to laziness or a hellish schedule. Anyway, I'm back and still keeping my nose close to the grindstone. I'm happy that way.  Oh, I'd like to thank Joel for that wonderful testimonial in Friendster. That's the nicest thing anyone said about me in the past month! Soon, I'll write you one, too, but we have to meet up and relive the memories of endless rainy days lounging at the foyer and spirited lunches kina Manang and oh, many more. 'Til then...  For now, I'm glad I'm back.

       I am not weak.   I repeat, I am not weak.   Just because I let my tears fall after hearing what happened to my friend does not mean I cannot handle it. I can and I will if he just lets me. I am beyond angry right now. Here I am, thinking I've done agood job of handling whatever it is that I need to handle and she tells me my boss thinks I'm not strong enough for the damn job. He could have had the decency to tell it to my face and ask me if I can do it. Now she says he's asking her to cover for me because he thinks I cannot handle it because I'm too attached to the person involved.  Damn it to hell! I know I am affected by it all. I know that our long-ago connection has not been broken after a couple of years. But damn it! I know that I want to help in the best way I can. Does that make me incompetent and weak?   I hate it when people equate tears with weakness. I can't stand people who fight back their tears in an effort to appear strong. Isn't the courage to wear your heart on your sleeve a show of true strength?   I have never thought that hiding behind a veneer of coolness when your world is going topsy-turvy and keeping all your emotions neatly tucked inside you is wise at all. One day, people like these will explode and nothing that can be salvaged from the wreckage will probably be of use to anyone.  Maybe I do need to change careers. Start fresh. Move on. My happiness is slowly slipping away...  Writing, an activity I enjoyed and cherished, has ceased to become a source of pleasure and excitement. In this place where I work, it has become a duty, a task to be performed. I have never found it difficult to write before. I have seldom encountered writer's block before this job. And I have been writing since I was in fourth grade. But now, writer's block occurs more often, sometimes desperately needing a change of scenery to unclog the tangled words and the jumbled phrases.  Maybe a new job in a new environment will change this. I do hope so...  Part of me is, of course, scared of a drastic change in my life. But I know that if I put my mind to it everything will be fine and that I can do it and I can prove to everyone who doubted me that I am strong and I can do whatever I have to do in order to fulfill my dreams.

       Food trip!   My boss, Sheryl and I had a *meeting* kanina. Well, okay, it was more of a lunch thing than anything else.  We went to Banana Leaf Curry House in The Podium at Ortigas Center. Yum.  I was slightly disappointed because unlike the first time I went there, we were made to eat on plates. I thought the whole premise of naming the place Banana Leaf is that you eat on banana leaves? Hmmm. Anyway, it was still delicioso.  We ordered Hainanese Chicken, King Prawns with Chili and Oyster Sauce, Unadulterated Curry Sauce (P30, what a steal! Pwede nang ulam!), Spicy Sour Chicken Soup, Deep-Fried Buffalo Wings, Spicy Tilapia (a really big one!), and that bread thing that isn't quite pita bread but is a perfect match for the curry sauce. When (Ha!) I go back, I'll be a cheapskate and I'll order the sauce to go. Tapos isasabaw ko sa kanin.   Naaalala ko tuloy yung ginagawa namin noon sa college (at least some of us...) pag wala ng pera pangkain at kailangang mag-kita-kita sa McDo. Order ng rice tapos hingi ng gravy. Yum.  Haaay. Ang laki tuloy ng tiyan ko...masyado akong nabusog. Pwede ng hindi mag-dinner. Ü

       Rainy day.   It matches my mood, though not my makeup.   I saw something yesterday that made me sit up and think. Could it be a sign from the heavens? I'm inclined to think so.   Maybe my mom is right -- that it's probably time to start anew, to begin a new chapter in my life. It will be hard, no doubt about that. But will it be worth it?  I can try. oh god oh god oh god......!

       Rantings   Sometimes I wonder if it's all really worth the trouble...  If I am so good at what I do, why am I being punished by preventing me from doing it? The irony is killing me.  I need the damn money.  And I think it's time to find a new job. Thing is, like any normal human being, I fear  change . I don't think I will be able to find a new job, the way the economy is and all that crap. I mean, anew job that allows me to do what I love to do and pay me roughly the same as I  USED  to be paid. Grrr.  How come my friends have no qualms about changing jobs? Is it just me? (Excuse me, while I battle this bout of self-pity and loathing...) Sob. I wonder if I'm ever going to be happy about my work again.     I need the damn money.

       Sweet.   I have watched it. After agonizing about it for days, I have finally watched Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.  Well, what can I say? I don't think any adjective in the English vocabulary would truly capture the greatness of the movie.  I plan on giving a detailed review of PoA here but then, I have only watched the movie once and I probably need to see it more than five times to be able to write an informative review.  Maybe later. For now,  I am content. And I cannot wait for Goblet of Fire!  Some views though: readers of the book, like me, would of course notice that there were some alterations and modifications and deletions of parts in the story.   The part about Pettigrew being seen on the map by Harry wasn't in the book, and he didn't tell Lupin about that too, in the book, at least.  But, I must say that the movie turned out great after all. My only disappointment is not having enough funds (and time) to watch it over and over again. Sigh.

       Harry Potter Today   And I haven't seen it yet. There was a premier last night but I did not get to see it because, well, I didn't know how the hell I should get tickets. Anyway, I want to watch it so badly first thing today but I can't.  I have to be here, at work, while others will inevitably troop to the cinemas and watch it and be awed by it and I am turning green with envy at the thought.   Sob. I can watch it later, when most people have already watched their eyes out. But I really, really want to watch it now as I am sure some people are doing!!! I have a meeting at 2 p.m. and I cannot get away before then. I just hope the meeting will end at 3 and I can take the afternoon screening which I think will be less crowded than say, the 7 p.m. or the LFS. If I do not get to watch it today I will not forgive myself.  Aarrggghhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!

      A little girl had been shopping with her Mom in Wal-Mart. She must have been 6 years old, this beautiful red haired, freckle faced image of innocence. It was pouring outside. The kind of rain that gushes over the top of rain gutters, so much in a hurry to hit the earth it has no time to flow down the spout. We all stood there under the awning and just inside the door of the Wal-Mart.   We waited, some patiently, others irritated because nature messed up their hurried day. I am always mesmerized by rainfall. I got lost in the sound and sight of the heavens washing away the dirt and dust of the world. Memories of running, splashing so carefree as a child came pouring in as a welcome reprieve from the worries of my day.  The little voice was so sweet as it broke the hypnotic trance we were all caught in "Mom, let's run through the rain," she said.   "What?" Mom asked.   "Let 's run through the rain!" She repeated.   "No, honey. We'll wait until it slows down a bit," Mom replied.   This young child waited about another minute and repeated: "Mom, let's run through the rain,"   "We'll get soaked if we do," Mom said.   "No, we won't, Mom. That's not what you said this morning," the young girl said as she tugged at her Mom's arm.  "This morning? When did I say we could run through the rain and not get wet?"  "Don't you remember? When you were talking to Daddy about his cancer, you said, 'If God can get us through this, he can get us through anything!"   The entire crowd stopped dead silent. I swear you couldn't hear anything but the rain. We all stood silently. No one came or left in the next few minutes.   Mom paused and thought for a moment about what she would say. Now some would laugh it off and scold her for being silly. Some might even ignore what was said. But this was a moment of affirmation in a young child's life. A time when innocent trust can be nurtured so that it will bloom into faith.   "Honey, you are absolutely right. Let's run through the rain. If God let's us get wet, well maybe we just needed washing," Mom said.   Then off they ran. We all stood watching, smiling and laughing as they darted past the cars and yes, through the puddles. They held their shopping bags over their heads just in case. They got soaked. But they were followed by a few who screamed and laughed like children all the way to their cars.   And yes, I did. I ran. I got wet. I needed washing.   Circumstances or people can take away your material possessions, they can take away your money, and they can take away your health. But no one can ever take away your precious memories...So, don't forget to make time and take the opportunities to make memories everyday. To everything there is a season and a time to every purpose under heaven.   - so that's what it was. we needed washing.

      okay, okay, i admit that the previous posts are evidence of my fondness for personality quizzes, pointless and inane though they may seem. anything to make you laugh, dear readers, or not.  anyway, the day started out alright with me excited as anything about getting the vcd's of csi las vegas seasons 2-4. the guy i was in contact with said i had to meet him in glorietta because he was sneaking out of his office for lunch and he had no other free time today.  so around 12 noon i persuaded jokester to take me to glorietta on his motorcycle. he was hesitant because the dark clouds meant rain and we all know bikes and bad weather don't mix very well. we were going on a more or less hurried (but still safe) pace and we reached glorietta in less than half an hour from pasig.   as soon as the guy handed me the vcd's it began to rain. against my better judgment, i decided to tell jokester to go on ahead and ride the storm. hnh. it was a storm alright. driving through edsa in the rain is no joke and i actually had my eyes closed the whole time. i now know what blinding rain exactly meant. sob.  turns out, the weather just decided to play a big (not to mention un-funny) joke on us. as soon as we returned to pasig drenched to the skin, the rain stopped. even the roads were noticeably drying out quickly. grr. good thing jokester didn't resent me for what i put him through.  as a consolation, i can watch csi-vegas anytime i want for the next ten years or so. i can almost hear jokester grunt. oh well. the things we do...

      I was supposed to go to cavite tomorrow for my godson's first birthday party. The operative term here is 'supposed to' which means that as of the moment, my plans for tomorrow has been cancelled due to unforeseen developments. (Definition: WORK)  And here I am already with a gift, though not yet nicely wrapped, but a gift nevertheless.  But then again, who am I to complain? The thing I will be working on tomorrow will be on a new show, a travel show for a change and I am both nervous and excited because, well, after three years of writing a public affairs/documentary show, the voice will be different and the tone less dark and I don't know if I can;t do that without sounding forced and too sickeningly cheery.  Of course, I am excited. A chance to travel at last. I actually can't wait for the actual shooting. Of course, there's a lot of nitpicking to be done first but maybe, just maybe, I will be a certified SCUBA diver by next year, at the very latest. Yay!  Thing though, am scared of not having a sandy bottom between my toes. Even the 14-feet pool in the dive shop leaves me a nervous wreck. I am the type of swimmer (ha!) who goes around the pool while holding on to the edges for fear of drowning even though the deepest pool I've probably been in is six or seven feet at the deepest end. Besides, I wonder if I'll look remotely like a human being and not a dolphin or a butanding when I am in a wetsuit. Horrors!  But I am told, the last thing on divers' minds are their appearances. I wonder if I can actually learn to breathe through my mouth.  &nbsp;

      Last Wednesday,&nbsp;I spent&nbsp;an exhausting night printing out materials for a presentation.  The venue: Mulawin Hall, Dusit Hotel The time: 3 PM  We arrived mga ten minutes before three and we thought na we were already late. Iyon pala, kami ang first to arrive there. Wala pa ngang tao from the organizing committee. Okay, so I can say it now.   My Bigger Boss kasi made it to the short list for the KBP Ka Doroy Valencia Broadcaster of the Year Award and the people who nominated the&nbsp;finalists (three in all)&nbsp;are supposed to present something to make the judges decide favorably on the nominee. The Ka Doroy award is&nbsp;probably one of the&nbsp;most coveted honor for all broadcasters here in our country and I'm proud to say na finalist nga si Bigger Boss.  So. My Boss made the presentation and my services were, thankfully, unnecessary. But still, I was glad to be there. (In my No-Run Pantyhose that cost P44.75 - it really did not run, in fairness.)  After the presentation,&nbsp;My Boss was&nbsp;feeling great and felt that we had a really good shot at it. We had dinner at Italianni's. Yum.  I ordered a Watermelon Shake (average) and for everyone, a large platter of Calamari Ceasar Salad (P395) which was absolutely heavenly! I'm still dreaming about it. And then we has my Boss' favorite, the Angel Hair Pomodoro (yummy), Chicken Italianni (hindi ko natikman), Grilled Salmon (which came on a bed of vegetables) which was sooo delicious.  For dessert, we had the chocolate cake (I forgot what it's called) which I didn't get to finish kasi I was plain bursting with good food. Sayang nga e. Anyway, it was a good meal but of course, pretty expensive. Our bill came up to at least P3,000. We were five in all, so pretty pricey. But anyway, it was worth it.  Bigger Boss won.  &nbsp;

        Due to this unforeseen hectic schedule I am now blogging while standing. Hmmm... &nbsp; And tomorrow, I shall have to wear pantyhose. The last time I did was when I was in high school, during our baccalaureate mass and graduation rites.  &nbsp; I haven't even bought one yet. &nbsp; The reason why this post is obviously choppy and incoherent is that I frequently have to walk three steps to the printer once its done printing a page or else it will spit it out angrily and the next page would be eaten up by the voracious and old HP810c printer we have. If it does, I will have to repritn it and it's no picnic since I'm printing 80 pages&nbsp; (10 copies of speech outline) and God knows I want to hit the mall now and not tomorrow morning! &nbsp; Thing is,&nbsp;I kind of have a suspicion that I will be printing stuff all night because Little Boss is coming and is bringing more things to print for tomorrow's biggie day. reminds me of the night before thesis defense back in college. We shall be facing a panel tomorrow (can't divulge specifics) and boy, will I have sweaty palms! &nbsp; When Ernie Baron became popular some years ago as Mr. Know-It-All, gag shows kept coming up with spoofs of him that showed him in a radio booth with a harried assistant. When people would call and ask a question, the assistant would find the right page in the right reference book and point to the exact paragraph where the answer can be found.  &nbsp; Mukhang ganoon ang role ko bukas. *sigh* &nbsp; Anyway, wheeee!!! I'm done with the 80 pages. But wait, there's more....Sheesh.

      With this new Blogger post-creator thingie, the cute icon that precedes my title seems to be missing. I miss it. I think it kinda looks cute. &nbsp; Alright then. I know, I know, zip with the inanities, the personality quizzes, the photos...I seem to be stuck with a Blogger's block and there's nothing really interesting to write about, unless you find A Day in the Life of Ms. Hermit fascinating. It happens that I don't.  &nbsp; I mean, what's to write about today?  &nbsp; Let's see... &nbsp; 8:30 AM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wake up, heat water for bathing, sleep again 9:00 AM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Read Winnie-The-Pooh 9:30 AM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shower 10:00 AM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Write article due yesterday 11:00 AM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have a Jollibee brunch. Yum. 11:30 AM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Receive call from Boss to make sure I am working 12 NOON&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Send article to Boss 1:30 PM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bigger Boss arrives 4:30 PM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bigger Boss is generous: offers a Jollibee snack. Yum. Again. 5:00 PM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bigger Boss leaves. *sigh* 5:30 PM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Blogging &nbsp; And here we are...pretty interesting Sunday. Oh wait 'til the evening, I've got some fancy stuff lined up: &nbsp; 6:30 PM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eat dinner of corn on the cob slathered with generous amounts of butter such as to induce  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; heart&nbsp;attack. Corn left by Bigger Boss. 7:30 PM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Begin watching CSI videos. Looking forward to Episode 17. 9:30 PM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Surf the 'net 11:30 AM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Try to sleep (Although the actual time would probably be closer to 1 AM than anything else.) &nbsp; If this were a payday weekend for me, you'd find me at the mall, window shopping. Really.

      I just think this is a really nice story. &nbsp;   What goes around, comes around...   &nbsp; He almost didn't see the old lady, stranded on the side of the road, but even in the dim light of day, he could see she needed help. &nbsp;So he pulled up in front of her Mercedes and got out. &nbsp;His Pontiac was still sputtering when he approached her.  &nbsp; Even with the smile on his face, she was worried. &nbsp;No one had stopped to help for the last hour or so. &nbsp;Was he going to hurt her? &nbsp;He didn't look safe; he looked poor and hungry.  &nbsp; He could see that she was frightened, standing out there in the cold. &nbsp;He knew how she felt. &nbsp;It was that chill which only fear can put in you.  &nbsp; He said, "I'm here to help you, ma'am. &nbsp;Why don't you wait in the car where it's warm? &nbsp;By the way, my name is Bryan Anderson." &nbsp; &nbsp; Well, all she had was a flat tire, but for an old lady, that was bad enough. Bryan crawled under the car looking for a place to put the jack, skinning his knuckles a time or two. &nbsp;Soon he was able to change the tire. &nbsp;But he had to get dirty and his hands hurt. As he was tightening up the lug nuts, she rolled down the window and began to talk to him. &nbsp; &nbsp; She told him that she was from St. Louis and was only just passing through. &nbsp;She couldn't thank him enough for coming to her aid. Bryan just smiled as he closed her trunk. &nbsp;The lady asked how much she owed him. &nbsp;Any amount would have been all right with her. &nbsp;She already imagined all the awful things that could have happened had he not stopped. &nbsp; &nbsp; Bryan never thought twice about being paid. &nbsp;This was not a job to him. &nbsp;This was helping someone in need, and God knows there were plenty who had given him a hand in the past. &nbsp;He had lived his whole life that way, and it never occurred to him to act any other way.  &nbsp; He told her that if she really wanted to pay him back, the next time she saw someone who needed help, she could give that person the assistance they needed, and Bryan added, "And think of me." He waited until she started her car and drove off. &nbsp;It had been a cold and depressing day, but he felt good as he headed for home, disappearing into the twilight.  &nbsp; A few miles down the road the lady saw a small cafe. &nbsp;She went in to grab a bite to eat, and take the chill off before she made the last leg of her trip home. &nbsp;It was a dingy looking restaurant. &nbsp;Outside were two old gas pumps. The whole scene was unfamiliar to her. &nbsp; &nbsp; The waitress came over and brought a clean towel to wipe her wet hair. &nbsp;She had a sweet smile, one that even being on her feet for the whole day couldn't erase. &nbsp;The lady noticed the waitress was nearly eight months pregnant, but she never let the strain and aches change her attitude. &nbsp; &nbsp; The old lady wondered how someone who had so little could be so giving to a stranger. &nbsp;Then she remembered Bryan After the lady finished her meal, she paid with a hundred dollar bill. The waitress quickly went to get change for her hundred dollar bill, but the old lady had slipped right out the door. &nbsp; &nbsp; She was gone by the time the waitress came back. &nbsp;The waitress wondered where the lady could be. &nbsp;Then she noticed something written on the napkin. &nbsp;There were tears in her eyes when she read what the lady wrote: "You don't owe me anything. &nbsp;I have been there too. Somebody once helped me out, the way I'm helping you. &nbsp;If you really want to pay me back, here is what you do: Do not let this chain of love end with you."  &nbsp; Under the napkin were four more $100 bills. Well, there were tables to clear, sugar bowls to fill, and people to serve, but the waitress made it through another day. &nbsp;That night when she got home from work and climbed into bed, she was thinking about the money and what the lady had written. &nbsp; &nbsp; How could the lady have known how much she and her husband needed it? &nbsp;With the baby due next month, it was going to be hard. She knew how worried her husband was, and as he lay sleeping next to her, she gave him a soft kiss and whispered soft and low, "Everything's gonna be all right. &nbsp;I love you, Bryan Anderson."

         Uy, bagong Blogger. May pa-color color ng nalalaman. At may font ng paiba-iba.     &nbsp;   Nice as it is though, I happen to like my current template very much and maybe the only thing that I'll occasionally change is the color.     &nbsp;   Haven't got a lot of time in my hands right now kaya halos puro photos muna ang ina-upload ko. So I decided to lessen the number of days that one can see from the main post para naman less download time ang kailangan. Minsan kasi nakakatuwa to just upload photos&nbsp;and put tiny captions instead of the lengthy posts I have had in the past.     &nbsp;   Shoutouts to  urlLink Dolphin Girl  who has e-mailed me and told me that she has "discovered" my blog. Muah! I have discovered yours too and in fact, I've linked your Live Journal to mine. The only bummer thing is that I can't comment on your post and you can't comment on mine. Weird.     &nbsp;    Anyway, on to a more serious topic. Our TV program, Kasangga Mo ang Langit is currently looking for donors&nbsp;for about eight DEAF students studying in public schools in QC. A scholarship costs Php7,500 for one child for one school year. This amount includes transportation and school supplies expenses. If anyone is interested in helping, e-mail me! Would love to hear from you. Good Karma awaits you. ;-)

      Am okay. More or less.   Thanks Slaybelle for that wonderful comment. By the way, is aurie_slayer who I think she is (Tina)? I can't seem to post a comment on her blog (and your blog too) because I seem to have been banned by virtue of being an open proxy (di ko alam ibig sabihin nun!) Anyway, I have this feeling na siya yun at ni-link ko na siya without her leave. Teehee.   I bought a clear quartz crystal pendant yesterday (P99) as part of my foray back into all that is mystical and wonderful. Even performed Tony Perez's chakra centering for my office mates. They loved it.

      I am in a muck and I can't seem to get out of it. Sometimes I wonder if I have a bipolar disorder, something we used to discuss in PSY class in college. We did our thesis on that too, interviewed people with clinical depression, duly praised by the "top dogs" of the panel.   From what I remember though, I'm hardly depressed. I haven't slashed my wrists yet and the hopelessness I feel is confined to work-related things lang naman. But sometimes, sometimes I feel as if, what's the freaking point? Why go on? Why hope? Why dream? Why should I keep on living?  I really can't explain it, I just feel it. I feel like I'm in the middle of a deep, dark pond and I'm terrified because I can't see my feet, I can't feel the bottom of the pond and it scares me.  I remember my first snorkelling experience in Anilao. It should have been one of the most exhilirating experiences of my life, because, well, I saw Nemo. But it wasn't. I couldn't feel the bottom of the ocean, I couldn't have the reassurance that when I let go of the boat I won't sink to the bottom and drown. I simply couldn't let go of my fears and let the sea take me along for the ride.  I really can't explain how I feel and yet, I just feel so sad, so inexplicably sad and angry and frustrated and i don't know what else. I feel resentment, envy, and I hate it. I hate myself for being this way.   One always says that it's no good comparing myself to others. It's no use trying to be like another person. It's no use wishing for something you cannot have.  BUT still!  Why do I always pale in comparison to them? Why do I feel as if they have it better than I have? Why am I so insecure as to base my happiness on other people? Why do I have to depend on money and material things to make me happy? Why do I feel so empty, as if I cannot go on, as if there is nothing more for me?  I hate having to be in this rut. The thing is, I'm here most of the time, I just try to ignore it. But somehow, this time, there's no escaping it.  Why do I hate her so much it makes me tremble? Why do I envy her so much it makes me hate myself? Why don't I want to see her happy? Why do I even care?  Why this anger?   Why this pain?

      Well, I did. I got the first season of CSI-Las Vegas and CSI-Miami! Wheee! Is fun.  Watched eight episodes of CSI-Vegas in two days. I decided to take break for a while 'cause it might take me another month or so to get the second season and I don't want to twiddle my thumbs just waiting for the next installment without having anything I can watch while I'm at it.  I've been reading the recaps available on  urlLink Television Without Pity  and I must say I'm really excited to have the 2nd season also. Who am I kidding? I want everything, the whole four seasons!   *Sigh.* Thanks to Ben, the VCD guy who now works as a programmer, I can now rest easy in my mind that I will never miss another episode of CSI again. Ever.  Tralala...

      On CSI yesterday at Studio 23, they aired the episode that launched the CSI Miami show ang, guess what? I didn't get to see it. Darn.  Had a meeting that ended at 8:44 p.m. so naturally, there was no point in rushing to a TV to watch the remaining 15 minutes. Sheesh.   Fortunately, my Sup here told me that I can get VCD's from this guy who sold her Meteor Garden CD's. She's buying the five seasons of Charmed pa nga e for only Php1K. And CSI's in the guy's list which she told me I can get for about P30-35 which isn't bad at all but if I get 4 seasons right away he might give me a good discount. Anyway, I'm hoping he can give me a good deal on that. Yay!  Sayang nga lang kasi I don't think the show I always wanted to watch but never had the chance to (Queer Eye) is available. Hmmm, Slaybelle? I think you mentioned something about watching an episode of Queer Eye while having lunch? Is it possible that you have CD's or tapes of it? I hope so. And is it possible for me to borrow it and have it copied in our hi-tech facilities? I'll return it before you can even miss it, promise! Ü

       Poetry reading.   Pablo Neruda, of course...Ü  XXV  Before I loved you, love, nothing was my own:  I wavered through the streets, among objects:  nothing mattered or had a name:  the world was made of air, which waited.  I knew rooms full of ashes,  tunnels where the moon lived,  rough warehouses that growled 'get lost',  questions that insisted in the sand.  Everything was empty, dead, mute,  fallen abandoned, and decayed:  inconceivably alien,  it all belonged to someone else - to no one:  till your beauty and your poverty  filled the autumn plentiful with gifts.  *sigh*

       Joke time.   Five cannibals get appointed as programmers in an IT company.  During the welcoming ceremony the boss says: "You're all part of our team  now. You can earn good money here, and you can go to the company canteen  for something to eat. So don't trouble the other employees". The cannibals  promise not to trouble the other employees.   Four weeks later the boss returns and says: "You're all working very hard,  and I'm very satisfied with all of you. One of our developers has  disappeared however. Do any of you know what happened to her?" The  cannibals disown all knowledge of the missing developer.   After the boss has left, the leader of the cannibals says to the others:  "Which of you idiots ate the developer?"   One of the cannibals raises his hand hesitantly, to which the leader of the  cannibals says: "You FOOL! For four weeks we've been eating team leaders,  managers, and project managers and no-one has noticed anything, and now  YOU ate one developer and it got noticed. So hereafter please don't eat a person who is working.

      There is a two letter word that perhaps has more meaning than any other two letter word – it’s “UP.”   It’s easy to understand UP, meaning toward the sky or at the top of the list, but when we waken in the morning, why do we wake UP? At a meeting, why does a topic come UP? Why do we speak UP and why are the officers UP for election and why is it UP to the secretary to write UP a report? We call UP our friends, we use it to brighten UP a room, polish UP the silver, we warm UP the leftovers and clean UP the kitchen. We lock UP the house and some guys fix UP the old car.   At other times the little word has real special meaning. People stir UP trouble, line UP for tickets, work UP an appetite, and think UP excuses. To be dressed is one thing but to be dressed UP is special, and this is confusing. A drain must be opened UP because it is stopped UP. We open UP a store in the morning but we close it UP at night.   We seem to be pretty mixed UP about UP. To be knowledgeable of the proper uses of UP, look UP the word in the dictionary. In a desk size dictionary, UP takes UP almost 1/4th the page and definitions add UP to about thirty. If you are UP to it, you might try building UP a list of the many ways UP is used. It will take UP a lot of your time, but if you don’t give UP, you may wind UP with a hundred or more.   When it threatens to rain, we say it is clouding UP. When it doesn’t rain for a while, things dry UP. One could go on and on, but I’ll wrap it UP, for now my time is UP, so I’ll shut UP.   -- From A Joke A Day

       Clean.   I went Antivirus happy today.  Since our office lacks someone who can troubleshoot PC problems because, well, we are not a high-tech company when it comes to PC's (though we have top-of-the-line non-linear editing machines and digital video cameras), I often have to take care of our aging but resolute PC's so they won't fade away into the night and zap our scripts into Never Never Land.  Not that I profess to be an expert. I just happen to be the only one here who knows how to wield mouse and keyboard to my advantage when it comes to trouble-time.  Anyway.  So today I noticed that my officemate's PC is exhibitng acute symptoms of VIRAL INFECTIONS. Yikes! It has been dragging itself along for many days now and I haven't yet done anything about it because I didn't have the time nor the inclination to figure out what to do.  Pop-up ads that take forever to close, programs that launch themselves, etc. These have been my officemate's PC problems since it has been connected to the net.  Well finally I did something today, installed Norton Antivirus, updated it through the net and voila! 421 files were exterminated of buggers. Actually, some of it were just quarantined while others were completely cleaned but I'm just counting my blessings that I was able to do it at all.   I only hope someone from the office not wise enough to know the dangers of downloading unsolicited programs doesn't make the same dumb mistake of clicking YES again. Sheesh.

       Dysfunctional.   Being a head sometimes necessarily means you have to wait for the people you are heading. *Sigh*  This is why I did not get a chance to watch Monk urlLink   tonight on RPN 9. It's supposed to be on at 8 pm but then...  Anyway, had just been to their site and the first season is now available on DVD. *Sob* If only I have a credit card then I could buy the set  AND   the DVD player. Sometimes, semi-poverty sucks.  Okay, let's play, Solve-It.   The Case of the Mobile Murder   It was 8 a.m. and Special Agent Grooms had just sat down at his desk. The phone rang, as if on cue. "Agent Grooms? I made up my mind - just this minute as I'm heading to work. I want to testify. Not that I know that much. Sal didn't introduce me to many people. But it should be enough to put a few of them behind bars."  Grooms nearly dropped the receiver. For the past four months, he'd been trying to talk Lana Salvatore into telling the F.B.I. what she knew about her ex-husband and the Boitano crime family. And now, out of the blue... "I want you to come down to my office," he said.  "I'm on my way right now."  "What? You're calling from a cell phone?" Agent Grooms started to sweat. "Those things aren't safe. I want you to drive straight here. Don't stop anywhere. Don't call anyone else. I'll meet you out front."  Lana laughed. "Don't worry. I've taken my own precautions. Be there in 20 minutes."  An hour later, Grooms got the report: Lana Salvatore's car had been found off the side of a country road. It had broken through a wooden guardrail and crashed into a tree. 10 minutes after Lana's call, Hap Orleans, a computer consultant whose house faced the country road, heard the crash. He ran outside and found Lana behind the wheel, not wearing a seat belt. The air bags had gone off, but they hadn't been enough to save her. By the time the ambulance arrived, the would-be witness was dead from massive internal injuries.   "I was just getting out of the shower," Hap explained to the highway patrol. "I heard this crash. No squeal of tires, just a crash. It took me no more than three minutes to get dressed and outside. Right away I saw the broken guardrail and the car up against the tree. There were no other cars or people in sight."  Grooms rejected the highway patrol's theory of accidental death and went in search of Adrian Monk, the police consultant. He had had his run-ins with Monk in the past. But if the San Francisco police could use his talents, so could the FBI.  "It's a job," Sharona told her boss for the tenth time. "You interview a few people, look at the crime scene - and maybe you'll be able to pay my salary on time." They were standing in the lobby of the Staytight Cement Company.  "I pay your salary on time," Monk said, looking a little hurt.  "Yes, you do... if this was 1999. But it's not."  Their bickering was interrupted by the arrival of their prime suspect - Sal Salvatore, Lana's ex. The cement company executive was tall and blond with an open mid-western face -hardly the standard mob type. Monk asked him for his alibi and he smiled. "At 8 this morning? Sure. I just got off a plane. Business trip. I was driving in from the airport on the other side of town. You can check with my boss, Mr. Boitano. At a few minutes past eight I was on my car phone calling into the office. Here's my plane ticket. I'm sure the phone company has a record of the call."   Big Tony Boitano, the mob boss, also had an alibi. "I was in the office, like Sal said. We was having an early board meeting. Sal called in and I put him on the speaker. A dozen of my guys can swear Sal was on the other end. How many times I gotta tell you jerks. I run a legitimate cement company here."  The last interview on their list was Pauly Adidas, Lana's boyfriend. Monk and Sharona found the young man lying on a couch in his living room, covered with a blanket, looking pale and in great emotional pain. "Lana and me just got engaged," he whispered. "Just yesterday. She drove off this morning while I was still in bed. I tell you, if I'd known what she was up to, I would've stopped her. You don't mess with these killers."  It seemed like a typically impossible problem. Even if the mob had somehow overheard Lana's cellular call, how could they have intercepted her car so quickly?   A further complication came that night. Monk was at home, relaxing, when Agent Grooms telephoned. Monk switched off his vacuum cleaner and answered. Someone, it seems, had broken into Lana and Paulie's house. The dead woman's fiancée had fended off the intruders but had been severely beaten.  Pauly was admitted to the hospital with two broken ribs, multiple bruises to the chest and stomach as well as a fracture of the left clavicle. When asked if the wounds could possibly be self-inflicted, the doctor shook his head. "From their position and severity, I'd say impossible. One of the wounds is infected. Mr. Adidas could have died if he hadn't come in when he did."  Pauly gave a statement from intensive care. "My car's in the shop, so they must've thought the house was empty. I was upstairs when I heard glass breaking down in the living room. There were two of them wearing masks. I grabbed a baseball bat, but they're better fighters than me. A neighbor heard the noise and called the police." Unfortunately, the neighbor never actually saw the intruders and Pauly couldn't give a good description.  Sharona looked on the bright side. "If they broke into her house, it means there was something they needed to find. Maybe a diary naming names. This case isn't over yet."  Crime Scene Report   The point of impact was on the passenger side, although the force had been enough to crush the grill and hood and shatter the windshield. Blood was splattered on the dashboard and smeared across the airbags. It was the same blood type as the deceased's, O negative. In addition, one make-up mirror was in the down position. Both of the deceased's high heeled shoes were recovered from the front floor.  There was no damage to the car other than that noted. There was no sign of sideswiping by another vehicle, and the brakes were in working order.   Autopsy Report   Death was caused by massive internal injuries, trauma, and loss of blood.   Note: The deceased was wearing makeup, but only part of it had been applied. The lower lip, for example, was free of lipstick.   Search Area Near Site    One-half mile from the crash site, the police inspected a public phone booth and discovered traces of human blood on the receiver, coin slot, and dial. It matched the victim's blood type, O negative. Three cigarette butts, one also bearing a blood smear, were found on the ground. No liftable prints were recovered from the phone or the butts.  Phone company records show a call having been made from the phone booth to the Boitano Cement Co. at 8:21 a.m., approximately 15 minutes after the crash.  Solution  (1) What's the story behind Pauly's attack and injuries?        His injuries came from the car accident, not a mob attack.   (2) Who killed Lana?        Pauly Adidas.   (3) How was the murder committed?        The driver, Pauly, used the seat belt to save his own life.     Explanation  Lana's fatal mistake was not realizing that her boyfriend might also be a Family member. After the Salvatore divorce, Tony Boitano enlisted his handsomest young soldier to woo the divorcee and keep her under control. All the while Agent Grooms was trying to get Lana to testify, Pauly was doing his best to talk her out of it.   Pauly was in the process of driving Lana to work when she made her call to Grooms. Several facts point to Lana having been a passenger: the lowered makeup mirror, her half applied make-up, and the high heels left on the floor.  Pauly heard Lana's call and went to work. He had to silence Lana before they arrived at F.B.I. headquarters and without exposing himself. An obvious murder would throw too much heat on the family. It had to look like an accident.  Pauly fastened his seatbelt, leaving Lana's unbuckled. Then, with a flip of the wheel, he sent the car off the road, smashing the passenger side into the tree. His own fractured clavicle was a result of the seat belt's impact on his left shoulder.  Lana died almost instantly. Pauly dragged her body over to the driver's side, thereby accounting for the blood smear on the airbag. He then hobbled off.  Pauly walked to the nearest pay phone and put in a call to Boitano. The three cigarette butts showed that someone had been waiting there for a while, perhaps waiting for a ride.  The seatbelt had saved Pauly's life, but he desperately needed medical attention. Going to a doctor, even a discrete Family doctor, would have resulted in bed time, bandages, and police suspicion. So Pauly faked the attack on himself to account for his injuries.  The cigarette butts got Monk focused in the right direction, but it was a twenty-five cent piece that sealed the case. When he had the FBI open the pay phone's cash box, they discovered a bloodstained quarter.   Perfectly preserved on one side of it was Pauly's right thumbprint - framed in Lana Salvatore's blood.  -- Whew. Ü

       Morbid Me.   Had a chance to watch CSI last night over Studio 23. Our office doesn't have cable so free TV's my only chance.  Anyway, people in that network apparently do not care about airing the epsiodes in sequence. It's still Season One and last night was the I-15 Murders.  Interesting quotes...  Grissom: "How's your old job?" Brass: "Ah, I can sling scum all day long. You?" Grissom: "I curse more."   Catherine: "You know how you're always pushing that Holy Trinity stuff?" Grissom: "The Father, Son, Holy Ghost?" Catherine: "Victim, suspect and crime."  Grissom: "Oh, that one."  According to  urlLink Elyse's CSI site , the episode aired on January 12, 2001.  If only we had cable...

      lunch meeting at  north park next door . (makati avenue, below tiananmen square)   salted garlic squid  P149: yummy, best eaten while hot. the breaded squid is soft and melts in your mouth.  pork siomai  P60 for 4 pieces: ordinary dimsum fare, but good, just the same.  australian broccoli flower in oyster sauce  P90: the broccoli has an earthy flavor, and the sauce sweetens the deal just right.  manchurian calamares  P160: okay, but i don't like my viands much too sweet. i stuck to the garlic squid.  taro puff  P60 for 3 pieces: my all-time favorite. be sure to drink lots of water. this is best with hot, steamed rice.  i always enjoy eating at north park. aside from being very affordable, sarap pa and ang daming choices. joks and i once ate there and we gobbled up two servings of their  yang chow fried rice  (P115) *blush* kakahiya. anyway, one treat to try is their  choko barako ice cream  (P50), one bite and you'll want more. haven't tried other flavors and maybe i will, next time. i also like their  fried bread with cream dip  (P60) though you can obviously try it at home with  several pieces of buns and condensed milk.  oh, wait. this morning i tried baking cookies. yup, the  pillsbury one-step chocolate chip cookie mix  (about P30, i think), the one where you only have to put water and you can use kahit oven toaster lang. ang sarap. super. chewy and hindi masyadong matamis. mm-hmm. i'd probably try the oatmeal flavored cookies next time. may raisin cookies pero since hindi ako kumakain ng raisins, kebs. i'll cook another batch later. hee. konti lang kasi nagagawa nun e. ang sabi sa pack 12 daw e 9 yung nagawa ko. i guess napalaki yung mga pieces ko. oh well. sarap.  by the way, shoutouts are in order: yayie, i know, warrick is hot! sizzling. debbie, welcome back! and advanced happy birthday! domi, (kahit alam kong hindi ka naman ata nagbabasa nito) sorry hindi ako nakapunta yesterday. too much work, too little time. happy birthday, anyway. cess, advanced happy birthday din! mmmwahhhhh!!!

       Stumpy Grinder and his wife Martha were from Portland, Maine. Every year they went to the Portland Fair and every year Stumpy said, "Ya know, Mahtha, I'd like ta get a ride in that theah aihplane." And every year, Martha would say "I know, Stumpy, but that aihplane ride costs ten dollahs .. and ten dollahs is ten dollahs." So one year Stumpy says, "By Jeebers, Mahtha, I'm 71 yeahs old, and if I don't go this time I may nevah go." Martha replies, "Stumpy, that there aihplane ride is ten dollahs ... and ten dollahs is ten dollahs."   So the pilot overhears then and says, "Folks, I'll make you a deal. I'll take you both up for a ride. If you can stay quiet for the entire ride and not say ONE WORD, then I won't charge you. But just ONE WORD and it's ten dollars." They agree and up they go... the pilot does all kinds of twists and turns, rolls and dives, but not a word is heard. He does it one more time, and there is still no word... so he lands. He turns to Stumpy as they come to a stop and says, "By golly, I did everything I could think of to get you to holler out, but you didn't." And Stumpy replies "Well, I was gonna say something when Mahtha fell out ... but ten dollahs is ten dollahs."    hee.
