      I haven't written in my blog for ages, and I'm not going to give you the reasons why not, cos I can't be fucked. Update on my life:  >>> I fight lots with mum.  Yeah life's a bitch and so am I. Mum and me don't get along very well, and consequently fight all the time. I'm not gonna slag her off because it just makes me look like an angsty teenager against the world blah blah blah. You know the story: you're living it.  >>> I'm working heaps at Subway.  Yes, that's where I work, and yes, it is quite gay. But apart from the shite pay, its alright. Weird people come in so I have fun. Here are some of the crazy shit that happens at work:  - This guy came in last week and asked for an onion. No, not a sandwich, just a whole onion. He said it was because he was "hungry". Go figure. - A man and his wife came in yesterday and he ordered a "foot long sub with everything on it" So I said "what meat would you like on that?" and he said "all of them". Even after several minutes of me explaining that it costs $3 extra for every additional meat you put on a sandwich, he wasn't put off. The sandwich ended up costing $21.00. Haha, his wife was so pissed. I would NOT have wanted to be him right about then. - This Indian guy comes into Subway quite often and always orders a veggie patty and a fizzy drink. Then he gets us to heat up the fizzy drink in the microwave. Until it boils.  What the fuck??  >>> Parties, Balls and all sorts  Life is one continual procession of parties at them moment....but I wish it was more of the kind where you could invite your mates and they could come too, but they all seem to be invite only. Grrr.   Oh and I'm going to the St Pauls Ball as well as the Hillcrest Ball. St Pauls is in 2 weeks, Hilly ain't for ages. Im going to the St Pauls one with a mate of mine, who (get this) actually HAS a girlfriend. I'm still not quite sure why I'm going with him and she's not. :S Hmmm....  Ah well, its another chance to get trashed....and like those who know me, I like to keep a constant blood/alcohol level of about 5%.  Oh yeah, more on the alcohol: Surrey and e are going halves on a bottle of Smirnoff tomorrow, and we are going to buy every single flavour of fanta and mix them to see which flavour tastes best with vodka. Yum, can't wait.   "Hansel is just SO HOT right now"

      I handed in my AFS application today just in time to catch the post...stupidly enough me and mum bought a pre-stamped envelope and some extra stamps to make it Fast Post, before we realised that it was a free post address. Doh!  But hopefully I get accepted so I can travel to Italy on an exchange type program next year, halfway through 7th form. I talked to an AFS lady and she said that they send roughly 200 people overseas each year.   "So how many people have applied?" "About 200." "Oh Ok."  So the chances of me being accepted are good (I hope).

      Pulling a sickie today. Decided that:  a) School is crap. b) I had a french exam that i didnt want to do (was going to fail it anyway, so may as well put off the enevitable for AS long AS possible). c) Could not be fucked going.  I just found out that three other of my friends are also 'sick'.     Great minds think alike I say.

      I got into AFS!  &nbsp;  The AFS people rang me on Sunday to tell me I was selected and I am allowed to go overseas. Not sure where yet….but I’m hoping Italy. My other two choices are Spain and Canada…and I supposedly find out what country I’m going to in 2 weeks.  &nbsp;  Some ladies whose kids went on AFS came round last night to talk to me and my parents mostly about what it will really be like, the whole fundraising, spending money, flying over there, school, friends, homesickness etc. Apparently I’ll be flying by myself (meh, no biggie) but there are AFS people at all the airports and stuff to tell you where to go.  &nbsp;  I might not actually find out who my host family is until just before I leave the country but oh well, as long as I have somewhere to sleep I’ll be fine.

      Ugh, had my AFS exchange program interview today. It lasted from 9.30am till 4pm... Its a long time to be on your best behaviour. I made sure I didn't wear anything too slutty, and made a huge effort not to swear. I think I only said fuck twice :D Its quite an acheivement for me.  &nbsp; There were about 10 people who had applied so we spent the morning playing childish get-to-know-ya games even though all of us knew each others names within the first 20 mins.  &nbsp; I really want to go to Italy, I have my heart set on it and I will be incredibly gutted if I can't go there. Alan Grant, the coordinator was like "Well I'm not trying to talk you out of going to Italy, but you have to understand that it is one of our most popular countries and I just don't want you to be disappointed if you can't go to your first choice country" &nbsp; Yes I WILL be disappointed. Mostly becuase there is no where else I want to go. He really seemed to be pushing the South American option, and yeah that'd be really cool, but it leaves at the start of next year and I want to go in the middle of next year (for two reasons, one because I can't get 10 grand in 6 months, and two, because I don't want to miss out on all of my 7th form year). &nbsp; Alan is ringing me tomorrow to tell me whether I've been accepted.... wish me luck!!!

      Somehow, with their powers combined my brother and the computer managed to delete Kazaa and all the songs that I have downloaded with it. So now, my 896 songs have been reduced by approximately half. Grrr.    DAMN YOU KAZAA! DAMN YOU TO HELL!

      I was thinking about the topics of conversation have changed dramatically between me and my friends. Bitching has always been a constant though.  Two years ago, all we talked about was: ANIMALS, food, paper-delivery rounds, teachers, RABBITS, boys, horses, friends, money (lack of), careers, philosophy (in a 4th form kind of sense) and what GOOD GRADES we got at school.  Now all we talk about is cars, SEX, guys, money (lack of), food, DRUGS, jobs, school, sex, ALCOHOL and how we are failing badly at school.    Its kinda funny how life changes.

      I went out last night and got pretty drunk...maybe not as much as I'd like, but still pretty gone. Slept all day today but got woken up by numerous phone calls...approx one every hour ("fuck off im asleep."). Bastards. Then went to work and it was gay.   End of story.

      I took my first illegal passenger yesterday :D I drove Surrey home from Jenny's place and as soon as we got in the car it started to pour down with rain. And I mean pour, and hail and lightning and thunder - the works. I had the fog lights on and the window wipers going mad...and we still couldnt see shit lol.      I think God was smiting me for taking illegal passengers.     Fuck you God...I like my passengers!

       urlLink    Me in my ball attire, with my friend Jackson.  The ball was quite cool, apart from the fact that I didnt know anyone, although Amanda was there with Ryan Berry. What a blast from the past! I haven't seen that cockmonkey since form 2.   The Le Grand Hotel was very well decorated with the theme 'A Night In Hollywood', and they had yummy spring rolls and brownies. And it was open bar, but nothing alcoholic unfortunately. Sad face.  I think my mate that I went with (see above) expected a bit more out us going together than I did...   There wasn't an organised afterball though, so we went back to a guys house and had a semi-party. I learnt a wicked drinking game called Circle Of Death, and as it turns out, Jenny learnt the same game on the same night at a different party.  Me, Jen and probably Jonathan are gonna get drunk on Wednesday just because we can. It should be fun. There's apparently a party on Cook St, so maybe we'll cruise by there.           Sometimes I think I'm an alcoholic.

      Well it turns out that they aren't gonna kick Miles out of home. They wanted to though.  ""We should just kick you out. Then you'd be in the gutter" "Then you'd read about me in the newspaper" "In what?!" "The death notices"  They apparently shut up after that.  But his rents have decided to take him out of school and make him work in their business to help pay off the $15,000 in fines/damages etc....oh and his car is getting repossessed. Yay for him.  I went and bought the ball tickets today, they are very flash....all professional and we get given little gold hearts that you can pin where ever you like. Woop.

      Miles apparently might get kicked out of home, so that’s sad, his parents are really pissed off (understandable really) but I haven’t had a chance to talk to him yet, so not quite sure what will happen.  Eric (Jen’s brother, the one who cheated on his girlfriend) didn’t go to school today, and has been hiding from everyone for two days. He broke up with his girlfriend on Sunday, and was a real cunt to her when he did, so on Monday she was really upset about it. Someone then told her what happened Saturday night, and she got even more upset (understandable really). She spent the whole day in the guidance counselor’s office bursting into tears, which is really sad.  And I still haven’t got my phone back and I’m still really fucking pissed off about that.  "Alright, already, we'll all float on"

       I’ve had roughly 6 hours sleep in the past three days, it’s been wack. I stayed Friday and Saturday night at Jenny’s boyfriend’s house (Miles). His rents are away, so we decided to make the most of it. Friday night was really fun and I got really drunk, but last night….well it was insane.  About 8 of us were at Miles’ till about 1.30, just talking, drinking, smoking weed (except me) and mucking around, but then all these sketchy stoners turned up, including Jens brother. Surrey and I decided to go to bed in his rents bedroom at about 1.30am, and Jen and Miles were pretty much comatose in his bedroom (too much weed heh) from then on as well.  There was only about 15 people in total, and they stole alcohol from the parents wine cellar and got really wasted. It got really out of control and the house got completely trashed. Some smart person then locked the wine cellar, but at 4am I heard fucking banging noises and smashing glass, so I got out of bed and was like “Fuck this.” And went downstairs to find Jenny’s brother trying to kick in the wine cellar door.  I then proceeded to yell at them and told them to get the fuck out, etc etc and Jenny came and had a go at them and we managed to get the worst of them outside and lock them out (har har). But they climbed up onto the balcony and carried on drinking some stolen spirits.  And THEN someone broke a bottle of fucking red wine on the cream sofa. Yeah, lots of people got kicked out after that. Then it was discovered that Jen’s brother was fucking some skank in the parent’s bedroom (thus cheating on his girlfriend of one year), so Jen took pictures on the pxt phone as evidence lol. When we came in, in the morning and Eric and the skank were all naked and hungover, so we gave them 3 minutes to get their clothes on, then we made them walk home it was funny. It is about 12 km back to Hamilton. Have fun walking guys.  So yeah, me and Surrey cleaned like mad from 4am till about 8am. We washed all the cushion covers, about 50 wine soaked towels and even some cum-stained sheets (don’t ask). Mopped two huge rooms and cleaned the bathroom and kitchen, before disposing of all the rubbish down the road. But we ran away before Miles’ parents came home.  Which is about now.  It’s about now that they are discovering the gashes down the side of their Renault, the fucked clutch in their truck, and the lack of petrol in both vehicles. It’s about now that they find about $250 of food missing. It’s about now they are finding the $??? worth of wine and spirits missing from their cellar.    Lol, good luck Miles.    And to top it all off someone nicked my phone, but I'm pretty sure I know who it is, so I'm gonna set them on fire.
