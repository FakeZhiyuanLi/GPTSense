      I can't remember how I stumbled upon this website, but it is purely amazing... The thing that stands out most is the animation. And when you go there, for sure you'll think the website is made using flash. Well, it isn't! Its 100% pure coding goodness...  Check it out at  urlLink ScottSchiller.com  - This guy has some awesome stuff on his site, but the site itself is a webdesign work of art.  On a sidenote, I'm planning on getting another domain and getting myself back on the net. I've been away from webdesign for far too long this last year. Not sure what the site will be able, but it'll be coming soon.

      Right now I'm atempting to become skilled with PhotoShop CS. Yes, I'm going to the side of the PhotoShop Whores (as I call them). The reason being that I'm tired of making websites with XHTML 1.1 and CSS standards compliant coding and that have good custom php and mysql backends, but that don't look that great due to lack of graphics.  Most websites I make don't even use a single image and although they're not that bad, I'm rather tired of making sites that are so lacking in smooth style. I think its time for me to move onto creating well coded sites with great backends but that also look good.  I have to say though, that PS is going to be a pain to learn. Just because I refuse to look at tutorials. I have never needed a tutorial or how to huide for anything to do with the internet, so why should PS be diffrent?  Well... I'm off to visit the gym and watch Leno while I work out. And once I get back, its off to bed with me.

      And before you get the wrong idea(s), I'm refering to my playlist! Although bigger can be better in other things as well... But that's for another time, heh.   Right now I have 302 songs on my playlist that have been sorted and quality tested. And amazingly only 11 of these songs don't have the media information on them. (Meaning all the rest have the album cover, etc filled in) Its not that big of a deal to some, but I rather like knowing these things.  Plus I have about 350 unsorted songs stored on my computer, which I ripped (legally) from internet radio stations using  urlLink Station Ripper . Now I just need to sort them all! ha... I might just have to set aside a 30 minute chunk of time each day for that...  Going offtopic, I've now been working out in the gym nightly now for about 2 weeks. Starting to look better too, lol. (Not that I looked all that bad before, heh) Also, I found another cool radio.blog at  Glittery.org  with a rather huge selection of songs. I'm not even 1/6 of the way down the list and have already found 20 or so songs that I like.   Well... I'm off to bed. Wish me sweet dreams...

      I'm a big fan of music. I love to listen to it and once upon a time I played the guitar and hopefully I'll take it up once again in the near future. However, its rather hard (for me) to find new songs and bands that I like. So I've been searching the net for good radio.blogs to listen to.  If you don't know what a radio.blog is, check out  urlLink Radio.Blog.Club  - You can even get your own radio blog from there. Anyhow, after looking over about 10 radio.blogs I finally came across one that was worthy of my time.   Its operated by the guy(s) over at  urlLink StuffWeDo.net  and I've only gone thru about half of the playlist. And almost every song I've liked and then added to my 'to download' list. The weirdest thing is that most of these songs I've listened to before, and liked, but was unable to remember the names of the songs or whom they were from.   Another noteable, but smaller radio.blog can be found at  urlLink MikeWS . Now I'm off to continue my search for music... Hopefully my playlist will be over 300 songs before the day is up.

      Pulled from a MSN Chat I was having with a friend of mine.  Samurai | Sleeping... (away) says: I'm the creepy guy who was talking about tossing retards down wells, how should I know?!  And yeah, I am a wee bit ashamed about that but I found it funny. I'd post the converstation leading up to it, but the girl I was talking to would rather I didn't. Ahh well... *sigh*

      Well, I got some money owed me by my older brother so I have watched alot of movies these last few days. I saw Spider-man 2, Arthor and I, Robot in the theatre on Friday. Yes, all on the same day, heh.   Spider-man 2 was just as good as I thought it would be. Meaning it was rather good. Arthor... I'm still not sure what to think of that one, but it was a good movie and had some great fight scenes. Maybe not as good as Troy was, but still good. And I, Robot was also good. Alot better than I thought a Will Smith movie would be, even though now that I think about it seems most of Will's movies are rather good...  And today I rented out 3 movies from Hollywood Video. Mystic River, Paycheck and Master and Commander. Mystic River was just... stupid as hell. Which suprises me considering it was directed by Clint Eastwood. I guess everyone is entitled to a flop every now and again, but still... I'll be more hesitant when renting out anymore of his movies.  Paycheck had a good plot and some good action scenes. Plus Uma Thurman was in it, and was as hot as ever so that was an added plus. I'm not the biggest fan of Ben Affleck but he was also good in this movie. Overall, its worth watching and I kinda wish I would have checked it out in the theatre. *sigh*  As for Master and Commander... Well, it confirmed my belief that most movies with Russel Crowe in them aren't even worth watching. (Gladiator being the exception) Although, to be fair it had some of the best naval battles I've ever seen however the plot was... Well, to be honest, there wasn't a plot.   I wish I wasn't out of DVD-Rs or I would be making a copy of Paycheck. Anyhow I still have some movies to watch and I think I'm going to make a run for some more movies after I watch Lost in Translation with Bill Murray. But I will leave you with one question that I am soon to figure out on my own using the  urlLink IMDB . The question: Which came first, Matrix Reloaded or Revolutions? I was going to rent out the newest but I forgot which was was newest... heh

      I'm just posting to post. I don't really have anything to report or any thoughts on anything. These last few days have been ' lazy days ' spent reading and mostly, sleeping. Sleeping could be considered one of my favorite hobbies...  Other than that, I've also been playing some more Halo. But the annoying banshee morons and team killing jerks get to a person after a while. Still, my Halo skill has become alot better. Hardly ever do I get under 20 kills in a game and more often that number is closer to 30 or above. Heck, earlier today I had a 39 kill game. And the day before I had a 42 kill game.  Anyhow, I'm off to bed now. But on a last note, the new Mariner Bucky Jacobson has gotten his 3rd Major League homer. And it won the M's the game in the 10th inning. Less than a week in the majors and 3 homeruns, keep an eye on this one boys and girls.

      This morning I found an old YoYo and since then I have oddly enough been messing with it. Like most kids, when I was younger (4 or 5 years old) I had a YoYo. It was a dark blue in color and had silver streaks on it, making it look really nifty (heh) when it was spinning.   My ' new ' YoYo is a solid pink one, but its still cool. I had forgotten the pleasure one can receieve from the smooth motion of flipping the wrist up and down. It seems that the true classics never die and are always a pleasure.  Anyhow... I think I am going to go mess around with it some more.  hehehe

      I am about to go to bed, but first I thought I would post the lyrics to one of my favorite songs. ' Mr E's Beautiful Blues ' by  the Eels . This song might sound familure to you if you have ever watched ' It's a Guy Thing '.  The smokestack is spitting black soot into the sunny sky The load on the road brings a tear to the Indian's eye The Elephant won't forget what it's like inside his cage The Ringmaster's Telecaster sings on an empty stage  Ahah God damn right it's a beautiful day Ahah God damn right it's a beautiful day Ahah  The girl with the curls and the sweet pink ribbon in her hair She's crawled out the window 'cause her daddy just don't care  (Come on!) Ahah God damn right it's a beautiful day Ahah God damn right it's a beautiful day Ahah  The clown with the frown driving down to the sidewalk fair Finger on the trigger let me tell you it was quite a scare  Ahah God damn right it's a beautiful day Ahah God damn right it's a beautiful day Ahah  The kids flip their lids when their heads hear that crazy sound Their neighbour digs the flavour still he's moving to another town (and I don't believe he'll come back)  God damn right it's a beautiful day Ahah God damn right it's a beautiful day Ahah  And I don't know how you're taking all the shit you see You don't believe anyone but most of all don't believe me Believe you  God damn right it's a beautiful day Ahah God damn right it's a beautiful day Ahah God damn right it's a beautiful day Ahah God damn right it's a beautiful day Ahah  For some reason, that song just sounds really good to me. Anyhow, I'm off to bed now. (Yes, at 8:11pm... Sad, no?)

      I was just watching the news about 5 minutes ago, and the big thing was that the San Francisco PD now wants to arm its officers with AK 47's. The reason being that one of their officers was recently killed by a gang member armed with, you guessed it, an AK 47.  Apparently, alot of the gangs in Frisco have managed to get their hands on high powered weapons and the police officers are highly underarmed to be able to face that type of firepower.   But some people don't think that police should be able to carry that heavy of weaponry. I know, that is insane! Their arguement is that they don't want heavy weapons battles going on. However, that really doesn't make sense as these battles are still going to go on, only the police will be at a major disadvantage.   I just thought I would blog about it, because its amazing that people don't want the police who put their own lives on the line nightly, to have an even chance of beating the gangs that infest the city of San Francisco. I know that if I was a cop, I would want to have the same or better amount of firepower as the gangs that I was expected to stand against.

      I just got done eating finger steaks and cheesy potatoe and bacon soup. The finger steaks are made by cutting up cube steaks into thin strips, rolling them in flour and then frying them in a skillet. I'm sure is more to it than that, but I don't cook... (The mum makes it)  And the potatoe soup... Well, the old man makes it and I'm not sure what all goes into it. But when its done, damn that is some good stuff. Its rather thick too and really isn't much like most soup. And paired with the finger steaks, its more like eating candy.  Anyhow, the reason why the parents made it is because my grandparents came over today. Other than that, I finally got my room completely cleaned and sorted. Which means I am now fully unpacked. And it only took me about 3 1/2 months... Rather sad, no?

      This poem is one I've known for a huge amount of time and have strangly always been able to remember. However, I never knew the author in till a bit ago when I found a slip of paper with the peom and the author's last name on it.   First out pleasures die,  And then our hopes,  And then our fears,  And when these are dead, the debt it due -  Dust claims dust, and we die too.   - Shelly

      I figured that I would post about this, because well... its something I did. What could this amazing thing be? Why... amazing as it might seem, I am cleaning my room of my own free will. I have already rearranged what little items of furniture I have.   I also have tossed some stuff and aquired a couple of peices of junk. But although they be junk, I did need them for storage. So that is good, meh. And I also dusted everything. And I mean everything... The dust was so thick on most stuff that you could actually draw in it with your finger. (Kennewick is a dusty and windy area, heh)   Meanwhile, this mess that my room is currently in will have to wait. See, I'm sick with a rather high fever and have been for the last couple of days. I had a moment of clearity not so long ago and realised that in the last 50 hours I might have gotten 4 hours of sleep. So yeah, I'm going to goto bed and hopefully when I wake up I won't break my neck atempting to get off of my bed, lol. Its a REALLY bad mess in here...  Goodnight all and sorry for the oddness of some of my posts these last couple days. Being sick with a high fever will do that to a personage. Not that I wasn't already strange to start with or anything, but I've been even odder of late.

      Its been a while but I just got around to cleaning up my computer of old and nonused programns as well as old AMVs that I don't watch anymore. Of course, I made a slight mistake and accidently deleted (perminately) some folders that I didn't want to. Which kinda sucks, as all of the AMVs I was planning on keeping were within it.    Right now I am downloading enough of the  urlLink top 10 percent list  at AMV.org to fill up one dvd-r in actual dvd format, so that I can watch them on my 32 inch tv. And plus, it'll get them off of my computer so that I'm not wasting much needed space.    After I do that, I plan on cleaning up the computer some more by burning a rather huge amount of anime to dvd-r in data format. Like I have the first 28 episodes of Shaman King, the first 38 episodes of Full Metal Alchemist and some other misc. anime series that I need to get off the computer. Right now my poor 80 gig hh is about 87% full and getting more crap all the time.    And after all of that, I'm going to run some system tools. Like defragment (Which I ran earlier today, but it  still  needs to be defragmented). I guess it was unable to move some of my anime episodes, which lucky for me, happen to be ones I am going to burn.     Other than that, I am still unable to sleep. I did try but to no avail. I think that anyone reading this blog, and how many posts I have made over the last day and half, is going to think that I am lifeless. Maybe I am... hehe. Anyhow, back to ' work '.

      I was so impatient for my Naruto fix that not only did I download and watch the RAW of it from L33T-RAWS but I also downloaded and watched a bit of Anime-Heaven's fansub. And after reading the first few sentences... I was purely amazed.    At how horrible their subtitles were. It sounded almost as if they had used a free online translator to translate it. I can forgive slight spelling and grammer errors, after all it was a speed sub. However, when you make the context of it make almost no sense whatsoever, just for added speed on the output of it. Well, that is just plain stupid.    And for the record, I only watched about the first two or so minutes. I just couldn't stand it any longer than that. That is the reason why I have always waited for either the Shin-Otaku or the ANBU release of Naruto. It might take a while longer but the translation is one hundred percent better.

      I just got back from my midnight ride, to pick the old man up at his work. Geeze... I wish that my mom would figure out how to get there on her own already, its rather annoying to need to be woken up at 1:30am to pick him up.     Anyhow, it wasn't that bad of a drive. It was nice and cool and there was hardly any traffic, which is actually unusual on both accounts. Normally the traffic isn't heavy or anything, but you sure don't have the road to yourself. And alot of the times, even at night, there isn't a breeze and the heat is still rather nasty. I think its about 74° out but it doesn't feel that hot.    For now I am unable to go back to sleep and am wide awake. So once again, as soon as my schedule is almost back on track, it gets screwed over by outside forces. Ahh well, such is life.

      That is indeed correct. I am off to bed, although not for long. See, soon enough my mom is going to wake me up and then we're going to go and pick up the old man from his work. The reason I have to be woken is this; my mom gets lost. Often.    On a side note, this new Blogger Wysing editor is a pure pain in the ass, although it is for sure a good thing and a move in the right direction for Blogger. And on the bright side, the development person of this particular upgrade on Blogger is very helpful with fixing the problems and has already taken care of a couple problems I was having just a few hours ago.    For example, when I clicked on 'Published Post' it would crash my Firefox 9.2 - Ouchies! However, that is fixed. And the injecting of uneeded &lt;br /&gt; tag has also been taken care of. But of course there are still some slight errors. Throughout the dashboard of Blogger, it fails to refresh itself when I atempt to save changes. Meaning I am forced to wait a bit and refresh it myself.    And although that might be a pain in the arse, overall its not such a bad error. Anyhow, even though it has some slight errors I think this new Wysing editor is a step in the right direction for Blogger, even though I won't be using it as I perfer to hardcode my html elements.     Now goodnight, although I might be posting again in a few hours. (Also the reason for so many posts today was the fact that I am rather sick and unable to leave the house!) BTW, it was a 103° when we took my dad to work today. And yes this is a rather jumbled and unorganised post but I can't get my thoughts ordered....

      I have recently downloaded and watched the RAW for both Naruto episode 91 and Samurai Champloo episodes 7 and 8. Now for those of you unfamilure with Fansubbing terms, a RAW is a direct copy of the episode as it aired in Japan. Meaning it has no subtitles and is of course still in Japanese.   The reason I say that I am sad is this; I am so hooked on these series that I download them and watch them without the subtitles. And no, I don't understand much Japanese at all... I'm so sad, that I cannot wait the extra day or two for a fansubbed version to come out. Now does anyone dare to say otherwise, that I am not sad?   I hope not, as its really pointless. If a person thinks of themselves as ugly, sad or stupid, nothing you say is going to change their mind. And no, I don't think of myself as ugly or stupid. (Although I am not the best looking person around, nor the smartest)

        It came from the east, from the mountain range known as Death's Head. Soft, cool and scented with the smell of blood. The breeze came to refresh and at the same time, repulse us. It is amazing at how something can be so refreshing but at the same time so repulsive.  That is how it always is here. Refreshing but repulsive. We see so many sights of beauty but at the same time so many sights of horror, of death and destruction. If you travel for more than a day here, along the mountain range, you'll see both things that calm your soul and make you feel at peace and things that will make you know true and utter horror.  I just got done writing this small bit. And I must say, its rather horrid. You could just tell that I was  really  trying and that it was forced. And the worse part is, after writing such a small amount of text I just dried up. The words stopped coming and my mind became a blank.  I was once able to pour out things in the pageload that were so much better than this. It is just so frustrating to know that I have the talent or skill burried within me, but am unable to free it. Its times like these that I would just like to know how long must I endure this writers block?

      I thought that I would post some decent reads because I think the best way to find out about new books and authors or to help others find out about them, is to talk about them. Yes, that is indeed one confusing paragraph but it should get the point across.  First off, although I am not a big fan of western books I do read alot of Louis L'Amour. Mainly because I own over 150 of his books and I am able to stand reading them more than once. The book of his that I am reading at the moment is  To Tame a Land .  I also have recently bought the entire  Sword of Change  series by Patricia Bray. Its a fantasy-type book with good action and even better humor. And the plot in the first two books is exellent, although the plot in the third and final book in the series is lacking. Buts its more than worth reading. The best part about the series has got to be that it is rather new and from an author new to the fantasy genre.  Some other books/series that I'm into, but that are also more well known are  The Sword of Truth  series by Terry Goodkind,  the Wheel of Time  series by Robert Jordan,  Deathstalker  series by Simon R. Green,  the Art of War  by Sun Tzu and  Go Rin No Sho  or  A Book of Five Rings  by Miyamoto Musashi. I'd write a bit about each one of these series/books, but there are just so many good sources of information on them already online that I feel my thoughts just aren't needed.  Of course, these are just a small amount of the good books out there just waiting to be read. And feel free to suggest other goods books in the comments as well.

      I got bored so I figured I'd post some PHP snippets because... I'm not a creative person and didn't have any interesting thoughts. Or at least none that I felt like posting. But then I realised that Blogger doesn't have a [php] or [code] posting method...  However because I am a css junkie I decided that I would just add a new css class and use the pre tag to post code. Example:   &lt;?PHP if ($moo) { $sound == "MOOOOOOOO!!!!"; }  echo $sound;  ?&gt;  It might not be the best method ever, but I think its a rather nice work-around. And I do know that just a few hours back I said I would be staying away from webdesign in this blog. Well... I might have been slightly mistaken.

      I have been inspired to start anew. Same name, same theme but diffrent look and perhaps ' feel '. The entries will continue to be just whatever I happen to have thoughts on. However I plan on focusing more on the side of poetry and writings than on the subject of webdesign.  Webdesign is cool and can be fun, but after focusing on it for such a long time, I have decided I need to refresh myself with a little something else. Don't expect any real deeps thoughts, but maybe I'll be posting some lyrics and poems from time to time. We'll just have to wait and see.  Also, the discription for this comes froms the opening theme for Samurai Champloo, Battlecry.  But anyhow, Ken-Jutsu has been reborn and with its rebirth hopefully it'll become something that it never was before, worth reading. Of course, only time will tell...

      So this weekend in Portland, OR I have a family reunion. Its my dad's side of the family, and alot of people should be there as its a big family. However, as fun as it might seem to some, it doesn't seem fun to me.  Its going to be a long drive up, and we're going to go with the grandparents, so its also going to be boring. Once we get there, its going to be hot. And long... And boring. Plus, I don't really even know any of them, so that is a downside too.  And then, after its over we're going to go spend the night with an uncle of mine. I don't even really know him, so that too is going to be uncool. And then in the morning, we're going to ANOTHER reunion that is being had for a cousin of mine who is getting married.  Its rather funny, because my grandparents are actually kinda pissed off about it. I heard my Grandma say something about how they're making way too big of a deal about it and how he surely isn't the first cousin to get married. I've gotta say, I agree with her!  And then after all of this... We get to sit in the car for a long ride back. And there isn't a single way to get out of it, because my mom already has and my dad expects me to go with him. Looks like I'm gunna need to pack 4 or 5 large books, cause they've got to last me a day or two... (The biggest downside to being about to read a 500+ page book in a couple of hours is that you're always running out of reading material, meh)

      I have been doing some serious ponderings on what type of website I want to create. I have at least 6 or 7 planned areas that I would want for the website. All of which I will explain as best I can.   Blog - This blog in fact, still updated by blogger but hosted by me with my own layout, thus without the blogger ads at the top.  Community - I want to create a general discussion forum, because I have always loved being the admin of a forum, even when they're not popular.  Online Adventure - Simple text-based online multiplayer adventure game that I am coding on my computer using PHP/MySQL, its already working, although in a very simple form.  Projects - This would be an information and updates area on various projects that I am working, I would also consider all of these areas of the website as projects.  Subdomain Hosting - I have always plans to host a few good subdomains once I have gotten decent hosting, this plan hasn't changed and will not. Ever.  Webmaster/Webmistress tools - Free tools I would host, and script myself such as TagBoards, counters and some other simple stuff.  Anime Area - I am a huge fan of anime, therefore I would like an area dedicated to my favorite animes with video clips, sound bytes and image galleries.   Of course, all of these areas I plan to be setup as subdomains of my main domain. (E.G. http://subdomain.maindomainname.com)  And there is always the chance I will think of more areas to add... Knowing myself, that is a rather huge chance. Now all I need to do is find some hosting that is affordable and that can offer me enough of everything so that I will be able to accomplish my goal.  I think the basic webhosting plan I will need is about 500 MB Space, 50+ GB Bandwidth, PHP, Unlimited MySQL DBs, Unlimited Subdomain hosting, Unlimited Email Accounts and whoever the host is, they shouldn't mind the fact that I plan on giving some of these things away for free.  Yes, I have a rather large order, don't I? Ahh well... Once I get it done and up, it ought to be worth being bookmarked, heh.

      I just found out that my cousin, who is only a couple months older than me, is engaged. To a 23 year old! And in case you've never seen my profile, that means she is only 17. I haven't ment the guy yet, but I have real feelings that he is a real creep!  I can't wait to meet the guy, cause I wanna see what he looks like, how he talks, etc. I like my cousin alot, as a matter of fact she might be my favorite cousin. Anyhow, I just thought I'd post about this because... I have nothing else to post? And it is highly weird.  I still can't believe my other cousin, Jeff (Her Dad) isn't all freaked out by her engagement, then again, he might be... Jeff isn't exactly someone who shares his feelings with the world or anything.  Ahh well, maybe he is an okay guy but I'm going to be thinking he is a childmolesting freak in till proven otherwise. Its a shame I'm not older, bigger and someone who looks scary, otherwise I would give him the "If you hurt my cousin, you will die, slowly..." speech, heh.

      I have made the discovery that my computer is a peice of crap. The motherboard doesn't even have a APG Slot! Which means that I am unable to install a decent graphics card.   On the bright side, at least I now know this and have good plans to just start to work on building my own computer. The whole idea is to buy a midsized tower and then to buy a decent motherboard. However I will have to make sure that the motherboard will be able to handle my Pentium IV, which I plan on overclocking to around 3.25 Gigahertz.  I also plan on having a watercooling system, which means I might even be able to overclock it higher than that. Yes, overclocking is good. Then of course I will need to buy a decent graphics card and then some extra ram.  After that... Well, a 250 GB slave harddrive is sounding rather nice. And maybe a 17 inch monitor. Of course, all of this just emphases the fact that I need a job. Its shame that my older brother borrowed our second car, cause that means I can only look for work within walking distance. Ahh well... At least I have plans, heh.

      Today me and a friend decided to stop being lazy and to setup a LAN over at his house, in the basement. I have to say, it was great fun. However it took us two hours to get the LAN working... Because we're morons.  The reason the LAN wouldn't work, the entire 2 hours, was because we forgot to disable my firewall. DUH! I guess the fact that we had both been up for 10+ hours might have had something to do with it, however I am not sure. Stupid I guess...  I got the full version of Halo from him, however it doesn't work online. (Sadly) Still, that is cool and I can still use the Trial to get my multiplayer fix, heh.  Anyhow, I have to get some work done for this girl I know. She needs help with a website for his computer class at school, so I need to get my arse into overdrive. Later!

      I just found out that the D2 ladder was reset... A month ago! So I've gotten in late and it looks like I'll not be making the new ladder anytime soon, heh.   But the amazingly thing about the ladder reset is how it has brough new life to the Realms. I think they should reset the ladder once a year or so. Right now I have a level 60 Necro (Ladder, Softcore) and a level 16 Assassin (Ladder, Softcore). I also had a level 39 Barbarian (Ladder, Hardcore) however in a moment of carelessness I got him killed.  Anyhow, people might not be hearing a thing from me for a while, lol. I'm going to bed now, but tomarrow its more D2.
