      The highschool that we went to the track meet with yesterday was awesome! They came in first place in their division!!! It was non-stop excitement, as each runner performed with a loud cheering section no matter what the outcome of their race would be.  This all reminded me of my days in track in elementary school at HFS!!!  Suddenly, I want to run track again!! Maybe not for competition. But definitely to see if I still have it in me to maintain my 12 sec avg for the 100m. "I think I can, I think I can...," was what that little train that could used to say and what my dad used to quote when I ran my one and only cross country race. Right now I can't do it, only brought my sandals here with me....oh well! maybe later!

      Accompanied my bf to a highschool track meet yesterday. Sat on a twin fold up chair from 9am- about 3pm!!! Okay okay okay....I stood up twice to I get a closer perspective on some of the runs. But for the most part, I remained comfortable if the comfortable foldup chair. Anyway, it was very sunny and I didn't realize how my face and collar area were getting cooked. The result: I am a Lobster!!! I'm so red and itchy!!! Babe even sang the Red Lobster theme song to me this morning to confirm my fears.  Went to bed really hoping it was just a bad dream that was occuring as a result of sun stroke. A Mon Dieu!!! can't wait for this scarlet hue to leave my face!

        You are a descriptive writer. An avid reader of Robert Frost, perhaps, you LOVE to use flowery words and use the paper and pen as your canvas and paintbrush. You prefer to paint a mental image rather than simply toy around with people's minds. A very inspired person, you love to be in nature and usually are a very outdoorsy type of person. A writer with a natural green thumb, perhaps?    urlLink   What's YOUR Writing Style?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      Went Salsa Dancing last night to Havana Lounge on Adelaide. Have never made so many mistakes dancing in my life!!! Stopped mid dance while dancing with some pretty good dancers, cause decided to give up for a second or two after being intimidated by their greatness, tripped a couple of times, and only succeeded in making my friends laugh with old school moves: the running man (or my version of it) and a funny hip hop, leg up popping move. But it was so much fun! Glad that I went there! Theres something about Havana Lounge that brings about a latin authenticity of a sort. Maybe it's the old wooden floors that remind me of the Desperado movie along with the antique bar chandeliers. Not sure, but I almost feel like I'm on a mini vacation overseas in South America or the Carribean. Ah well! A girl can always dream! Salsa dancing with friends and other nice dancers is the best way to unwind after a stressful work week or lack of work week. Hooray! I'm going to do this again next week (maybe at the same place or maybe some place else)we'll see! Wherever I go, I'm sure it will be a good time, yet again!

      I went to a place at Finch and Keele last night. It was not too shabby. A friend Dan owns it. He's pretty cool. The night was full of karaoking, playing pool, mingling and eating. I had a good time! especially since there was no smoking indoors.  A few of my friends showcased their voices. Mikey Bustos was there sharing some tunes. He's an old friend. I can't believe how much he's grown. I knew him when he was a skinny boy from St. Mikes singing with an all boy group that sang cool tunes at filipino gatherings and birthdays. Babe sang "Let's stay together" by Al Green and I was melting all over again. and Shel sang "I'm every woman" I love that song! She did a swell job!  Pool was ok. I lost, but I had fun trying to make shots in my canary like outfit.  Seeing ol friends and new friends was cool. i love socializing.  The food was alright too. But next time I think I will ask them to go easy on the fries unless four other people will be eating with me. There were so many. I felt slightly nauseous on the way home. Didn't even drink  that night!

      Was having nightmares about Tuesday night's happenings until last night! Honey assured me that thinks will be OK. So, I'm just trusting in that for now.  Finally saw a good singer that almost made me cry on last night's Canadian Idol.  Was beginning to think that this season's competition wasn't going to be all that good after seeing the auditions shown on Tuesday and Wednesday!  Hope my fave makes it far!  Unfortunately I don't know her name yet!  Ah well! We'll see later on.

      I can't believe the nerve of the reckless driver that hit the young woman at the cross walk on my street yesterday!!! The old punk claimed that it was not his fault!!! When clearly the lights at the cross walk were blinking and the woman was already at the center of the road while she was crossing. He claims he didnt see her because of the rain!!! and that it wasnt his fault!!! He ran right into her without stopping!!! I'm still in shock at the sight of how much blood was on her while we, (myself and the two other witnesses) were attempting to calm her before the ambulance and police came. There was one big huge gash on her head, i'm assuming that happened from when she flew on to the hood before she went flying through the air from the force of the car, about 8-10 m ahead of where she had been hit. Her legs were all bruised up and she was terrified! I felt so helpless! I wanted so much for her to get up and walk it off like those stunt people on TV! That creep of a driver better never be allowed to drive again! People like him give drivers a bad name! After giving my statement to the police and walking away, I asked the police if I could call the hospital to find out if she was okay. He said yes, But up until now, all I know is that she was admitted to the major emergency section of that hospital. At the hospital, they didnt even want to just let me know if she was ok.  She has two young children and a seemingly caring but terrified husband! Please think of her tonight when you pray. If you pray...Let's hope that things turn out right. I will continue to check in to the police and the hospital and find out more.

      Currently I am without a paying job. It's bumming me out and so are other things that don't usually get me down so much.  I know sometimes these things happen.  Can't wait for more sun to shine on my sitch! (Figuratively speaking of course) ... just checked my messages...One call back today! We'll see how this one goes! Sounds like a nice place to work!.... ... anyway, about that something to do that I was going to mention earlier on: (this is for those people who are looking for something random to do on a nice day outdoors) KICK A STONE AROUND A&nbsp; NEIGHBOURHOOD yup! that's right!  Babe and I kicked up a storm!  It was great fun!  I got a funny sense of accomplishment after this game. Funny because the idea behind this game is just downright silly, but nonetheless enjoyable!

      Took Babe to see Urinetown last night. It was great! I'm&nbsp;not usualy one for dark, satiric humour, but I enjoyed it thoroughly! I predict that if all my journalism friends go to watch it, they will like it...and we are not all that easy to please.  There is something there for everyone, the enviromentalists, the pessimists, those that just like good live music and musicals.... Each song was sung with so much care, the harmony for the duets was awesome and what made the overall picture of the whole show great, was that it was all done on the foundation of a topic usually found to be gross and stinky among other yucky things. In my opinion, to be able to pull off that task is a tough one!  Urinetown! I think it ends this month! Try to enjoy it while you still can!   &nbsp;

      Last week was one of the busiest and most exciting weeks I have had in a long time! I still can't believe some of it has gone by already!  Mon: The civic holiday. I volunteered handing out pamphlets for the run for the cure in Oct. My sister and I tried to hand them out to as many people as possible, so that lots of people will be notified and they can participate to help raise money to find a cure for breast cancer. Some people were still not willing to take a pamphlet from us even though we explained that it would be for a good cause. I hope enough people still took our message to heart and will take action to help out as well. After we did that, I had my first job interview with Kitchen Stuff Plus.  I felt it went well. The manager and myself had a lot to talk about. It was so hot that day and I was pooped from doing all the walking I had done when handing out the pamphlets, so I hung out with Emie at her condo on Bay! It was sweeeeeeet! We just chilled and read books on her roof and then we took a dip in the outdoor hot tub, before going to catch the Notebook playing at the Varsity.  Tuesday: I finished reading off the Alchemist on this day. It gave me a lot to think about as far as the direction I am heading in for my future. Later in the day I met up with Shelina for some greek appetizers and some tea at Starbucks. It was nice to see her for awhile after a long time. We caught up on eachothers lives and discussed ideas for her wedding next year! It is going to be a spectacular four day long affair! Wowee!  Wednesday: I rested on this day..or atleast I tried to. I hung out with my youngest sister then went home to watch Canadian Idol. BUT !!! before that I caught a glimpse of the new and it mentioned that people that were going to get their CLINTON ( MY LIFE) book signed by him might not have a chance to, if they didn't stay over that night to line up!!! My original plan was to get this book signed for my wonderful boyfriend on the Thursday and then surprise him with it when he arrived back home the following week. Aya! I decided I had to do it! I thought to myself that this opportunity may never come again, that I could get a book signed by a great former U.S. president. I thought, babe would have done it on his own if he were here, so it's my duty to get this job done! Babe often brought up how he thought Bill Clinton was an awesome president, I just couldn't pass up this chance! There was no turning back from this crazy feeling I was getting! sooooooooooooooooooooooooo....I did it! Right after Canadian Idol, I packed up my stuff and rushed down to Bay and Bloor, complete with my sleeping bag and munchies..... ~TBC~
