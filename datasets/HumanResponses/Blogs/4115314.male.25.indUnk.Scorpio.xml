      Stuffy British writer, Geoff Nicholson on collecting stupid shit:  "What was collecting, anyway? You took one thing andyou took another thing, you put them next to each other and somehow their proximity was supposed to create a meaning. You put certain artifacts together, drew an artificial boundary around them and there you were with a collection. So what? As for the people themselves, I suspected that collectors were deeply inadequate human beings, compensating for a lack of personality, intelligence or love. I pictured them as a bunch of unsocial dullards: shy, oafish, unhip."  Kinda judgmental, don't you think? Who is this dude to be talking about compensation? If you really think honestly about it, who among us doesn't compensate for something lacking within us in some form or another?  But then, think of all the people you know, and all the things they collect- your nerdy record collector friends: how DO they talk about the first pressing of this record and the gatefold of that record for hours on end?  Magazine collectors (I, personally have 3 big boxes of magazines in my basement, of which I will probably never open again but even if I do, it will just be to waste away another Sunday afternoon.).  or friends with shelves full of books, half-read or not read at all, or put back on the shelf after the first ten pages. I've stopped looking through my friends' shelves and inquiring about different books they have-  Me:  Oh, how's this one?  Bookworm Friend: Uhhh...  Me: Nevermind.  I'm actually guilty of the same thing. Mark Twain once said, "a classic is a book that everyone thinks they should read, but never actually get around toreading." Good point, Mark. By the way, I've got three of your books in a box somewhere that I haven't read... yet. I swear I'll get to them some day.  One of my favorite collections was owned by a married couple I used to work with, whose entire house looked like an action figure museum. Lines of action figures from the 1970's on up were displayed in rows upon rows upon rows on shelves all over the place! They had built shelves into the wall to add more room when the collection got too big. I wanted to go over to their house one day with one of those panoramic cameras to document it all.  The action figures were all these two co-workers ever talked about (Well, to be complately fair, the woman sometimes switched it up and talked about Depeche Mode, but really, what can be said about Depeche Mode that your 15-year-old cousin hasn't already covered?).  I worked in the mailroom back then, and every day around mail delivery time, the guy would come back to my office to see what new toys had been shipped to him. What did these people do before E-bay?  I once accompanied a friend of mine to some dude's apartment out behind Sunrise Mall. My friend was the record-collecting type. So avid about it, in fact, that he took out an ad in the paper: "I collect records. Sell them to me. I'll come to your house and rifle through all the boxes in your garage if I have to. I'll also eat any snacks you offer me." His way of getting records produced a lot of creepiness. He'd drive out to some old dude's house- someone he didn't know at all, beyond getting his voice on his answering machine. My friend would drive up at some random house with bent shades in the front window, off of some random street, out in the middle of your least favorite random tree-less suburb. He'd walk up the oil-stained driveway, knock on the front door that had chunks taken out of it, and some bushy-bearded dude would swing open the door and with the jerky body movements of a tweaker, would say something like, "You Scott? Hey, you gonna buy my records and shit, right? Well, I got all the shit in the back and shit, there's some shit in the way but don't mind that shit."  Scott was either a lot braver than me to do this every weekend, or maybe just that much more addicted to record collecting. He and I once went on a month-long, cross-country trip in an effort to bore all 50 states to tears. You see, Scott had a lot of connections through friends and business partners, so we usually had a friend's or a friend of a friend's house to stay at in the city we happened to be in that night.  I distinctly remember being in Pittsburgh, hiding in the other room for about an hour and a half while Scott droned on and on and on to our host, schooling him on how much money different punk records will go for on E-bay. "There was this one time," he'd start, "I put up Operation Ivy's first seven inch on E-bay. The first bid was at uhh... uhhh... the first bid was uhhh... (he said "uhhh" like it was going out of style. A mutual friend of ours once did his impersonation of Scott leaving an answering machine message- "Hey Danny, this is... uhhhhh... this is uhhhh... uhhh...this is Scott. Uhhhh.... whatchamacallit.... uhhh...call me back.") for $15. I checked it the next day and uhhh.... it was up to $20. Ummm uhhh... I checked back a day later and it was uhhh... $30. It finally sold for $60. But uhhhh... then everybody else tried selling uhhhh... their Operation Ivy seven inches uhhh... and the price went down."  I sat in the other room, feeling so so sorry for our host, wondering if maybe he'd finally get sick of hearing the going rates for punk seven inches on E-bay and kick both our boring asses out on the street.  Anyway, so one day, Scott and I went to this apartment complex behind Sunrise Mall. The complex housed about 1,300 identical apartments. Light brown paint, two apartments on the bottom, two on the top, with black, iron stairs to get to the top ones.  We finally found the guy's apartment, #1803729643A, and knocked on the door. A beefy man with a bad cop moustache opened the door. "Hey. You're Scott, right? Come on in. I got 'em right here on the couch."  We walked in to find a giant box of records sitting on his couch in the living room. He related the glorious story to us of how he came into such a find- "Yeah, I'm a security guard over at Target across the street, and I guess last week, that public radio station was having a record sale or somethin'. Anyhow, after it was over, they just pitched these boxes over by the dumpster. I figuredthey must be worth somethin', so I dragged 'em across the street over to my crib."  Actually, Security Guard At Target, "Best of Bread" albums just aren't going for what they used to. If  NPR threw them away on their last day of the sale, you can bet it's crap. Every record in there is easily found in the 25 cent bin at any thrift store. "Best of Bread", a bunch of Elton John records, Chicago records, Blood Sweat & Tears records, etc...  Scott didn't buy a single thing. I worried that it was rude of us not to buy anything, what with the security guard inviting us into his home and all. So just to save us from getting our asses kicked, I bought a Simon & Garfunkel record off of him- one of which I already owned three copies. But my motto is you can never have enough Simon &amp; Garfunkel records if it'll keep you from getting your ass kicked by a Target securityguard.  What was really weird about the security guard's apartment, though, were his walls. The walls of his living room were plastered with Star Wars figures, all of which were still in their boxes. He had stapled each one to the wall. While Scott was flipping through the records, I attempted to make conversation with theguy-  "So, how long have you been collecting Star Wars figures?" I hate asking questions like that. It's like asking in code, "So, how long have you been a super boring person? Your whole life, or did something happen?" You can bet that Star Wars figures is mainly what occupies this guy's brain all day; what he talks to his girlfriend about- and does she find it interesting, or is she just numbed into a little box of living with this dude?  It got me thinking- this is just one apartment, among 1,299 others in just one complex, among how many hundreds of others in this suburb, among all these suburbs in our county, among all the counties in...you get the picture. What kind of collections lie behind all these other apartment/house doors? China collections, spoon collections, TV Guide collections, Reader's Digest book collections, beer coaster collections, train sets, guitars, etc... The mind boggles!  What kind of pleasure does this security guard get from his collection? Does he get off work every day, go home, unbutton his security guard shirt, grab a six-pack of Keystone Lite out of the fridge, plop down on his couch and just gaze at his wall of Storm Troopers and Chewbaccas and go, "Ahhhhh, this is the life!"  Well, don't think about it too long. At least not if you have a gun in the house.  Don't reach for that gun just yet! I'm about to give you some ammo. That is, for hurling at me. A collection of my own:  In late Spring, near the end of my third grade year, our teacher was trying to get us into reading the newspaper. She bought 30 copies of the Sacramento Bee and passed one out to each student, then instructed us to clip out an article that we found interesting. I was into baseball back then, so I flipped straight to the Sports section.  On the 4th page of the Sports Section, something caught my eye- an advertisement for Big 5 Sporting Goods. It was their Summer Sports sale. My eyes were transfixed on a drawing of a woman in a one-piece, tropical print bathing suit. I'd never seen anything hotter in my life!  Making sure my teacher wasn't watching, I took my scissors and clipped out the woman in the one-piece and slipped it into my folder. Then, I turned to my friend, Craig sitting next to me. "Hey Craig, can I borrow your Sports section for a second?" Craig handed it to me, and I clipped out his one-piece woman, which I also slipped into my folder. I then asked 3 more of my classmates if I could borrow their Sports sections.  Collections all start with one thing, then continue with daydreams of all the others you could possess. It becomes a bona fide addiction. Your eyes are always on alert for the next potential addition. It consumes your thoughts. The triumph of finding another thing to add to the collection gets more intense, yet more short-lived with each thing gotten.  The next installment to my folder came when my family was on vacation. My mom didn't like camping, but thought hotels were cheesy, so our family compromised and rented out vacation homes every year.  One Easter holiday, when I was in the fourth grade, my family drove out to Irish Beach and rented some family's vacation beach house. The house was fully furnished, with all the amenities, including something of particular interest to me- women's magazines.  I spent every moment of that vacation indoors, flipping through Redbooks, Cosmopolitans, Elles, searching for more summer specials. At the end of our vacation, I hid one of the Redbooks in my backpack under a bunch of clothes and took it home with me.  Once home, I clipped out what I wanted- a beer ad that pictured two women in bikinis, their arms around some guy dressed in a bear suit. I filed it away in my folder, which I then hid in the crack between my bed and wall.  I collected these kinds of pictures for a while, until the folder grew so fat, it threatened to split in half. I was pretty proud of them. Whenever the neighborhood kids came over, and we were all safely behind the closed door of my bedroom, I would say, "You guys wanna see my girlfriends?" and I'd show them all the clippings. None of my friends seemed all that impressed. We were still all pretty much in agreement that girls were gross- but these weren't girls! They were women! They were beer-drinking, one-piece bathing suit-wearing women. We found them interesting, but...what I'm saying is we weren't having any circle jerks in my room. We were all too sheltered to figure that out.  Still, the clipping served no real purpose, other than to collect. If you're thinking what I think you're thinking, you're wrong. It wasn't until years later that I learned how to do that. So, why collect?  I finally lost my folder of clippings when one day, I got a little too confident with how far my collection had come while still sliding under my parents' paranoid watchful eye.  One afternoon, my mom was napping in the living room while my neighbor, Timmy and I were playing outside. Timmy said, "Hey Danny,why don't you show me your girlfriends again?"  "But my mom's sleeping in the living room," I said. "I'd have to sneak past her to get them out of the house."  "She won't notice if she's sleeping." Never one to let down my audience, I went inside and crept upstairs and got the folder. Just to be safe, I put the folder under my shirt, clutching it to my stomach, and crept back downstairs. I had almost made it outside when my mom woke up and saw me slip out the front door. I quickly shut it behind me and ran around the corner into my side yard where Timmy was waiting.  I hesitated for a minute, to make sure my mom wasn't coming out after me, and when I figured the coast was clear- that she hadn't figured out I was hiding my girlfriends under my shirt- I opened up the folder and Timmy and I went through them as if we were looking at baseball cards.  After we were done, I put the folder back under my shirt and ran inside and up the stairs to my bedroom to put the folder back in its hiding place behind my bed.  A couple minutes later, a knock on my door. It was my mom. "Danny, what were you holding under your shirt?"  "When?"  "A couple minutes ago when you came inside from playing with Timmy."  "Nothing."  My mom was clearly losing her patience. "Danny, I know you were hiding something under your shirt. What wasit?"  I knew that the only way out of this one was going to be pity. On cue, I started crying, and went behind my bed and pulled out the folder and dramatically threw it open, as if to expose this awful side of me that I couldn't stand. Believe me, Mom, I'm more disgustedwith these girlfriends of mine than you are! I have a serious problem.  I ritualistically ripped up each girlfriend right in front of my mom and dropped them in my little trash can to show her I was cleansed of this vile addiction. It ended just as it had started- another person totally unimpressed with me.  My Uncle T, my mom's favorite brother has a 49'ers hat collection. The last time I checked- which was about 7years ago- he was up to approximately 600 hats. That's right- SIX HUNDRED DIFFERENT 49'ers hats! Youdidn't think that many variations of the 49'ers hat even existed, did you?  When at family reunions, you always know what to ask Uncle T about- "So, Uncle T, how's the hat collection coming along?" You'd maybe ask normal people about their wives or their jobs or their kids... not Uncle T. His hats are pretty much the only thing he's got going on.  Well, that's not entirely true. He once bought a camper shell for his truck. That seemed pretty interesting to all of us at the time. "Cool," we all thought, "maybe this means Uncle T will actually go somewhere or do some shit, or maybe- gasp! Go somewhere AND do some shit?!"  "So, Uncle T, what's the camper shell for?" I asked.  "Fishin'."  "Ohhhhhh... So, you're gonna go camp somewhere, and then fish?"  "Yeah. Probably."..............  "Ok, then."  A year later, I made the mistake of innocently asking Uncle T if he had done any fishing with his camper shell yet. I expected grand stories of Rugged Uncle T camping alone in the woods, catching enormous fish and slamming them down in the bed of his truck under the camper shell.  No stories. Instead, a cloud of shame went over his face, and he said, "No. Nope. No, not yet. But uh... uhhh... I'm plannin' to pretty soon here."  "Hmmm... well... that's cool, Uncle T. Say, do you need me to watch your 49'ers hats while you're gone fishing?"

      After her second husband left, my mom walked around in one giant, long decade of self-righteous singlehood. She'd been burned so hard by the last one, that she seemed to be of the mind: "Ain't no man gonna make me think I need his shit!"  There were a couple slip-ups. The worst one I remember was a highway patrolman who she actually had the audacity to bring back to the house for me to meet after their first date. Her date walked in, belly hanging over his tucked-in polo shirt, and noted that I was wearing a Dead Kennedys t-shirt. Before I could even utter, "My name's Danny and you're not my real dad, pig" he said, "What does your shirt say? Dead Kennedys, huh? Is that some of that punk rock music? Where they throw their instruments around and stuff."  "Yes, sir. And, while we're relating in stereotypes here, how about you tell me how many black people you beat today before you got all cleaned up to take my mom out on the town?"  Quite honestly, I feel for sad old single men and women who are trying to get in good with their date's teenagers. It's a losing battle that just embarrasses everyone involved. Teens are like horses, in that they can smell your fear. Quite honestly, to this day, if a man was dating my mom, rather than him trying to make nice with me, by asking the same lame questions everyone asks, it'd be a great breath of fresh air for one guy to just stand up and say, "Yeah, I fucked your mom last night!"  Alas, my mom will probably never be with a man who values mom jokes as much as I do.  But getting back to when she showed up at my house to let me know she was tying the knot. It really confused me that she was so eager to marry again. And it confused me even more that she made such a to-do of telling me, paying a special visit to my house late at night to break the news. Couldn't she just call me?  But then I remembered, one key thing that all children of broken marriages know: Parents will spend the rest of their existence, trying to prove to their children that they're cooler than the other parent.  By making a personal visit to my house, my mom simply was trying not to make the same lame mistake my dad had made when he announced his second marriage.  My dad used to have a really odd way of getting dates- he treated the obituary section of the paper as the personal ads.  Why have a thing for widows? I'll tell you why- they're too distraught, desperate, lonely, out of sorts, on the verge of a breakdown, and disconnected from their feelings to realize what a loser my dad is.  Seriously, I think my dad dated three newly widowed women in a row.  My dad and I hang out approximately three times a year (Christmas, Father's Day, and one random "Dad & Son Hang Out and Do Guy Projects Day"), and in between those days, there isn't much communication.  So I never know how his love life is going, and he doesn't even bother to ask about mine. Of course, I don't bother to ask about his- he just tells me, as if I actually wanted to know.  Two years ago, after not talking to my dad for a few months, I received a mass e-mail from him. It was addressed to 70 other people. It was all about how he was getting engaged to some woman. Engaged?! I didn't even know he was seeing someone! In fact, I didn't even know my dad could score this late in the game!  The story goes like this-  my dad belongs to this club called the Sacramento Song Circle, which consists of a bunch of hippie burnouts and folk song enthusiasts who get together once a month and sing folk songs out of some lame folksong book that they all own.  Now, I don't mean to get all conspiratorial by claiming that my dad had alterior motives- he loves him a good folk song- but I think the group was basically a front for him to pick up chicks. Lipstick for old people?  There was a woman named Christina, who attended these song circles with her husband, Peter. Christina and Peter lived up in the woods of Colfax with their son, Josh. and then Peter died. just like that. I think he had cancer or something.  The Song Circle mourned his death, my dad walked around with a boner for a few months, then Christina met a British man and promptly married him. Shortly after, my dad's boner deflated again.  Christina moved the Limey into the house that used to be shared with the dead dad and Josh. They all lived happily together for a few years, until the Limey was diagnosed with cancer. terminal.  One day, my dad, being the nice guy that he is, drove up to Colfax to visit Christina, the dying Limey, and the son, Josh.  When Limey and Joe were alone, they had a heart to heart.  "You know, Joe," Limey said, "I think it would be great if after I'm gone, you watched over Christina and Josh."  Look over Christina how? Like, naked?  Around Easter, Limey finally died (but unlike that other dude who died around Easter, Limey stayed down.).  My dad attended the funeral. Two days later, he telephoned Christina out of the blue and said, "You know, Christina, I think we should probably have a talk to discuss what you mean to me, and what I mean to you."  "That sounds good," Christina said. They agreed to meet two days later in Colfax and take a hike to the waterfalls. The day of the hike, they revealed to each other that they were in love, and really, what else was there to do than get married?  And so they were engaged, mind you- while her last husband's grave was still warm.  Some children cause an uproar when their parents get re-married. Some children cause an uproar when their parents do something as impersonal as telling them they're getting married via an e-mail sent to them and 70 other of their closest friends. Not me. I'm too used to the absurdity of my family to even muster up an outrage. That, and it makes for good blog fodder.

      Late one night (well, around 10:00. Maybe that's not late for you bigshot party kids, but it is for me) about a month ago, my mom (aka Mrs. Ellis- that's what I've referred to her as ever since her last divorce, when she took her grandmother's maiden name, "Ellis" and said no man would ever make her drop a name again. For some reason, I got a giant kick out of calling her "Missus Ellis" even though she's a Mizz) came knocking on my front door- way past her bedtime. Nothing keeps Mrs. Ellis up past her bedtime other than a tragedy or a heated game of cribbage.  I invited her in, but she only stood with one foot in the doorway. "Why don't you come outside?" she asked.  "Uh-oh," I thought. "Tricia (my sister) didn't fall off another building, did she?"  I followed Mrs. Ellis out to the driveway where we both took a seat on her truck.  "So," she said, "it looks like I'm getting married again."  Again! Round Three.  a brief history: After 22 years of marriage & three kids, Mrs. Ellis divorced my dad. I was in the 8th grade.  "We're going to try out living separately for a while," I remember them telling my sister and me one night at the dinner table. Note to parents- never break any shattering news to your children in an ambiguous way. No matter how bright you think they are, they're going to still be stupid and desperate enough to cling on to phrases like "try out" and "see what happens."  It's much better to put it to them straight- "We've put up with each other's shit for far longer than we should have. If it ain't gonna work after 22 years, it ain't never gonna work, kiddies. P.S.- your father's a bitch."  Shortly after their divorce, my mom started dating a big tall bearded man who looked a lot like Jesus. In fact, my mom once told me with stars in her eyes that one of the first things that attracted her to this man (Greg) was that he looked a lot like Jesus. Creepy, no?  My mom used to be a nun, back in her early twenties, and there's some weird Catholic romanticism about nuns being married to God or some shit- I guess it's supposed to be a beautiful thing or whatever, but to me- it's always seemed a little creepy. "It's like Rosemary's Baby, only... not so evil."  After my mom and Fake Jesus married (1 year into the relationship), he'd go out every evening, and jog around our neighborhood in nothing but running shoes and a pair of those super-short purple jogging shorts with the slit up the side.  I can't convey to you just how embarrassing this was for a 14-year-old boy to have his half-naked stepdad running around the block for the whole neighborhood to see.  I had a giant crush on a 15-year-old girl named Chastin, who lived right around the corner from me. Chastin made fun of everything and everyone, and I guess I thought that was hot at the time. I was terrified that Chastin would see my jogging stepdad bound by her house, beard and long hair bouncing in the sun, sweat dripping from his chest hair, and I would be labeled "spawn of the purple jogger" by Chastin, thus ruining any chance I ever had with her (of course, it turned out later that I never had a chance with her to begin with, but it still burned to know that this dude who was doing my mom was ruining my chances of doing it with... anyone in my neighborhood).  And it burned even more that Jogging Jesus felt no need to change his appearance for the dinner table. Our family would come to the dinner table, fully clothed, except for him. He'd sit there in his short purple shorts, fresh off a vigorous run in the sun, sweat dripping from his beard to his chest hair, down his stomach... If you've ever wondered how I got so skinny, look no further than my adolescent dinner-table associations.  Personally, I couldn't stand the guy, but my mom seemed pretty into him. A little too into him. It's an embarrassing thing to deal with when you're a teenager, just recently having come into your own sexual identity, and then being forced to come to grips with your PARENTS' sexual identity. I'd rather they not have one, thanks.  I remember lying on the couch every evening, watching television, when my mom would come down the stairs to kiss me goodnight, reeking of perfume and middle-aged sex. "Hey Mom, could we maybe just do with a hi-five goodnight rather than the hug and kiss goodnight? I don't know where that mouth has been!"  Jogging Jesus imposed heavily on our house. A month after he moved in, he ripped all the posters off the wall in my brother's old room. That room had been a shrine for my sister and me. The three of us kids spent hours and hours and hours in there, reading Rolling Stone magazine, pretending we understood the Echo & the Bunnymen albums my brother was playing, a lot more than we did.  But Jogging Jesus needed a yoga room, and rock posters must eventually make way for bear rugs, empty "indigenous" clay vases made of dried tiger dung, and other hippie shit.  Six months into the marriage, the happy couple went on a romantic getaway to Colorado, where Jogging Jesus was originally from. My mom was convinced that I was still too young to stay home alone (I was 14), so she left me with my neighbors, the Delsols whose kids were famous around the neighborhood for beating the shit out of each other as a hobby. a great influence on me.  Every day I would come home from school, hang out at my own house for 15 minutes, then trudge over to the Delsols' house to have dinner with them. I'd sit at the table with that family in complete and total silence, until all of a sudden, K___, who was my age, would yell to B___- who was three years younger- "Stop looking at me!!!!"  "K___," Mrs. Delsol would plead, "what IS wrong?"  "I'm sick of his stupid face!" K____ would yell. and it would go on and on and on until little, tiny ulcers developed in my stomach and I'd say, "May I be excused please?"  Every night, I laid up in my sleeping bag in the Delsols' spare room, cursing happy new stepparents and romantic getaways and dependence and dysfunctional neigbors. The only solace I had was my little boombox that I fell asleep listening to talk radio on- that is, until after the first night, Mrs. Delsol came into my room as I was drifting off and told me to turn the radio off. Apparently, Mr. Delsol had bat ears and was sleeping lightly thanks to my radio turned up to "1" seeping through the walls.  After just one week, I had had it. All I wanted was for the couple to come home, even if it meant Jogging Jesus would be back to his embarrassing antics. I just needed to be back in my own room, in my own house, away from the yelling and hair-pulling.  And then, one day, a week before my mom and JJ were to return, I came home after school to find my mom's door closed. Having the overactive imagination that I did, I grabbed my baseball bat. I crept to the door and lightly knocked on it.  My mom was home.  JJ was not.  My mom broke out into tears and told me the story:  Apparently, everything was going swell on their trip until one night, JJ announced to my mom that he didn't feel like being married anymore. The next morning, he dumped her off at a Greyhound station in Utah.  They never saw each other again, outside of divorce court.  A year after, the truth started to come out. My mom told me that JJ had been married before, back when he lived in Colorado. He had 4 kids from that marriage.  One evening, during an imtimate talk right before they got married, my mom asked me why JJ and his wife got divorced.  "Because she was poisoning me," he replied.  Uh, what?!  "Yeah, she was putting poison in my food. So one day, while the kids were at school, and she was at work, I packed up my shit in a trailer and drove out to California."  Oh, sounds pretty reasonable. So, about these wedding plans...  Part II comes tomorrow.

      I'm one of those people who usually doesn't like talking about himself in coversations. Once I  get to know someone well enough, I'll open up, and can blab for hours on end. But unless I know you really well, I'll probably just spend most of my time asking you questions. There is one exception to that rule- when talking through e-mail, I get pretty long-winded. Here is an example, when some girl asked me a few questions:  1. First job:  Whe I was 16, I rode my bike all over Rancho Cordova, putting in applications at the seediest of fast food joints. and I do mean seedy- I had more teeth in my mouth alone than the whole kitchen crew combined at one Burger King I applied at. Burger King, who, by the way, wouldn't hire me because I didn't have enough experience. Just how much experience does a kid need to sweep french fries off the floor? Does one need a Bachelor's degree to learn how to press the "Extra Large" button on a cash register? And furthermore, who the hell do they think they are, acting like they're too good for Daniel Paul Offer ?! In case you hadn't noticed, you're the bottom of the barrel, people. There is nowhere to go but up after fast food- other than Folsom State Prison, which, I suppose you all have more experience with than me.  Maybe they just hated me cuz they read on my application that I went to a Rich Kid Catholic school. telling themselves, "I'm sure he can find himself a job at that Canoes For Christ Camp or something..."  Anyway, the Carl's Jr. on Folsom and Mather Field Road rejected me, as did McDonald's, as did Burger King, as did Denny's. It wasn't until I tried the other Carl's Jr.- way over off of Sticks Road and Bumfuck Blvd.- that my first boss, Patty decided to take a chance on me.  The problem with that Carl's Jr. was that it was on the outskirts of the business district, approximately 15 miles from my house. I carved out some fuckin' calves of steel that summer, riding to and from work every day on my mountain bike my mom had bought me. She bought it for me under the condition that I would promise to wear a helmet. I obeyed that rule, more or less.  The only time I ever took it off was two blocks before I rode by Shannon Miller's house. Shannon Miller was one of the hottest girls at Cordova High.  I fell in love with her after one Halloween, when I was 15, I trick-or-treated at her door and she guessed who I was dressed up as! Nobody else in my whole neighborhood could figure out my costume.  I copied something from an Adam Sandler skit on Weekend Update on SNL when he was giving ideas for inexpensive costumes. The costume I copied was simply hanging a teabag from between your teeth. He stuck the teabag string between his teeth, then said in his Adam Sandler voice, "Hey look at me! I'm Crazy Teabagmouth! I got a damned teabag hangin' outta my mouth! Now give me some candy! Or at least a cup of hot water to dip into."  Well, whatever. it seemed brilliant to me when I was 15. It didn't seem so brilliant after my 73rd neighbor gave me a blank stare, then said, "That's not a costume."  But then, I got to Shannon Miller's house, and she opened the door, dressed up as a hot witch or something- basically just a short black skirt, black tights and a super-tight black lycra top. "Oh my God!" she said. "You're that teabag mouth guy on Saturday Night Live, aren't you? God, I love that show!"  "And I love you," I whispered after she had already shut the door safely on my teabagged-face.  So yeah, I rode by Shannon's house every day, with my helmet draped over my handlebar just in case she was outside when I passed- I didn't want her to think I was a dork who wore helmets. Instead, she'd think I was super cool for keeping safety safely away from me on my handlebars.  I digress.  The only thing working as a teen taught me was that if I ever ever have kids, I will refuse to let them work until they reach the age of 18. Fuck that "teaching them responsibility" nonsense. If they need to learn responsibility that badly, I'll sign 'em up for karate or something.  2. Favorite first date(s)  I'd have to say my favorite first date was a bar of soap. Are you confused? One year, for Christmas presents, my mom gave each of us three kids a big brown grocery bag, filled with all sorts of goodies from the 98 Cent Store. There were boxes of off-brand Wheaties, dandruff shampoo, chocolate covered wafers, a box of super-thin Kleenex...  but the real prize was a three-pack of body soap- called "First Date." I never even opened it up. I just threw it in the trash. I have severe brand loyalty to Ivory. I imagine the First Date soap smelled like a super-potent combination of cologne and perfume you'd smell in an elevator in a funeral home. Do they have elevators in funeral homes? They must. Dead people are so fucking lazy!  3. First birthday that you can remember  We were so deprived of good food at the dinner table (my mom knew how to make a total of three dishes: Mac & Cheese, scrambled eggs, and Pork Chops Rancho Cordova*) that when our birthday dinner came around, we'd ask for something pathetically pedestrian. One year I begged my parents to take me to Eppie's. Another year- cornish hens. It wasn't until I ate one until I realized, "Oh, it tastes exactly like chicken. Only miniature."  I have a really vague memory of my parents taking me to the prison on my birthday. seriously. My parents were never ones to let a little birthday get in the way of their own agenda. I think my dad wanted to check out the Folsom prison gift shop, which held all kinds of trinkets made by the prisoners. To make me feel better about the day, my brother and sister chipped in and bought me a Berenstein Bears book I head been eyeing all evening at the coffee shop we ate at.  4. First car  The same one I have now. I have a cousin by marriage (he married my blood-cousin, Alison Karver), named Rick who basically became my surrogate father when my parents divorced. I was eleven. Rick and Alison let me stay the night at their house on weekends. Rick took me to basketball camps that he ran, took me to Kings games, took me to the park and whipped my ass in one-on-one basketball... basically did all the things that my real dad was too much of a puss to do.  When I turned 13 or 14, Rick and Alison adopted a 1-year-old boy, and the novelty of having a mopey teenager around kinda wore off, I guess. I don't blame them. Teenagers are awful people to have to hang out with.  As a last gesture of watching over me, Rick offered me his 1992 Infiniti G20 a few years ago because he didn't want to "go through the hassle of selling it."  I've been too afraid to drive it on the freeway much. I think the steering alignment is loose or something because every time I hit a dip in the road, I have to hang on tight to the wheel to keep the car from careening off the side of the road. It's pretty fun.  The driver's side window doesn't go up or down in wet weather. The passenger's side window doesn't go up or down in any kind of weather. You have to nudge the sunroof along if you want it to close or open. The interior is ripped to shreds- it looks like a vulture and a cheetah were locked inside for a few hours. It has almost 195,000 miles on it. The last time I took it in to get fixed, my mechanic sat me down and had a long heart-to-heart with me- the kind a vet has with a pet-owner before suggesting that the owner put the animal to sleep.  My car now resides in my side yard, collecting dust and cobwebs, waiting for me to decide whether or not I want to pay off the $600+ in parking tickets in order to get it registered. I don't think I want to. Though, I got a letter from the DMV the other day that threatened to garnish my wages if I didn't pay up pronto! I didn't realize they could garnish your wages. Next thing you know, they're going to send a bounty hunter after me!  5. Best decision of the past 2 years  Cutting my hair. Or maybe not. That's too vain and trivial. I honestly do feel a lot better about myself now, though. Back when I had longer hair, I used to ride my skateboard down the sidewalk, obsessing over my hairline in every window's reflection. "My hairline is blowing in the wind!" I used to lay up in bed at night, freaking out about it. There are many more things that should have kept me up at night that didn't. The hairline did.  Once I shaved it off, I stopped worrying about it. I was able to let go of what I was refusing to let go of, which I should have let go of anyway.

      If you've followed the old blogs from my previous Myspace account, I guess there's no need to read these, or maybe you like re-runs. I don't know. Anyway, here's some boss shit-talking:  Bossy Bossman  My boss and I could definitely not hang. As I'm typingthis, he's teaching himself new functions on our copymachine. A copy machine that is going to be forklifted into a landfill within the next 60 days, or whenever it is that the new $40,000 machine shows up. Yes, that's right- we are buying a new copier for  FORTY  THOUSAND  DOLLARS.  "Hey boss, you think after we're done buying new copiers, I could get a ten cent raise so I can move upto the name-brand Ramen? No? Not enough funds in the budget? Ok. No, I understand."  "Well Danny, perhaps if you stopped blogging for a minute and showed some interest in those new copier functions your boss is learning..."  No. I've tried showing interest in my job already. All it does is make me feel like a sap/tool/dumb bitch.  My boss is a short Filipino man with a crazy Supercuts hair-do that kinda resembles that opera house in Sydney:   urlLink http://www.greatbuildings.com/cgi-bin/gbi.cgi/Sydney_Opera.html/cid_sydney_006.gbi   He gets very excited about his job. He's an office manager in an office that doesn't have a whole lot to manage. What that boils down to is that he ends up making up a lot of lame projects to do that really don't need to be done.  One of my co-workers' favorite stories to tell is about the day the boss made him sweep behind the copy machine. Because, you know, the president of the company might come down here, lose his pen behind the copier, ask someone to move the copier away from the wall so he can get his pen, then see what a mess it is behind there, and have our whole fucking office condemned!  The boss uses real official terms for everything- things that just don't require an official term. One day, when he was drying off dishes in the kitchen, he took a metal bowl and said, "We need to secure this bowl." and put it in a cupboard below the sink.  We need to "secure" this bowl? Dude must be an animal in the sack. "Darling, I'm gonna secure you so good tonight!"  Anyway, the main point is that he's way stoked on his job. It's the most exciting thing to happen to him since he conned his wife into marrying him.  He's one of those people whose conversation skills amount to asking you a question- not because they're curious about anything about you- but so they can get talking about themselves.  For example, before he left work yesterday, he cameover to my desk and said, "So Danny, do you have any plans this weekend?"  "Well, I was gonna maybe bounce a couple speedballs, then shoot some kiddie porn with my cousins and then on Sunday (the Lord's Day), say five Hail Marys and overdose on Klonopin."  "Oh yeah?" he says. then 10 seconds of silence. finally, I obliged, "And what about you, V____?" It's what he'd been waiting for ever since I startedwith, "Well..." He launched into some ten minute spiel about putting rocks in his backyard.  Which brings me to my next point. My brother's band is coming out with an album next week. The single,"Pardon My Freedom" is going to be the next new big thing. The chorus goes like this:  "Like I give a fuck. Like I give a shit about that shit. Like I give a shit. Like I give a fuck about that fuck..."  brilliant, eh?You can hear part of it here:   urlLink http://www.brainwashed.com/!!!/music.html   The thing is, for how simple the line is, it's so fucking appropriate for so much in everyday life. How many times have you been stuck with someone's face flapping at you about their goldfish's eating habits and you just wanted to say, "Yeah, that's not really my bag."  The boss starts talking to me about how he's gonna totally lay those rocks down in his backyard and in my head, all I hear is, "Like I give a fuck, like I give a shit about that shit..."  One day, the boss came and sat over by my desk and tried to engage me in another one of his coversations:  "So Danny, you like to write, right?" oh great. Here we go.  "Actually, V____ I think writing is the art of heathens. Then again, what artform ISN'T heathen?"  "Well, my wife- she writes. She writes real good. I mean, I've read some of her things and they're good. I like her stuff. Anyway, there's this web site that posts essays by boring housewives who write about being a boring housewife and all the things that happen in the day of a boring housewife. Well, this site chose my wife's...[like I give a fuck, like I give a shit about thatshit...] and she got put on the first page, and they might give her an award, and we're all just hoping...[like I give a shit, like I give a fuck about that fuck...]anyway, I just wanted to share that with you."  "Gosh, V____, that sounds fantastic. When I'm old and bored and boring and have run out of things to do other than slitting my fucking wrists, I'll be sure to chek out your wife's little essay. By the way, if your wife's a fan of reading and writing you guys should check out my blog."

      Well, I guess this is where the new blog will go. This is only a test right now. I guess as a test, I will tell you a joke:  A guy and an octopus walk into a bar. The guy proclaims, "I'll bet anyone $100 that my octopus here can play any instrument!"  The bartender steps out from behind the bar and says, "Alright. Let's see him play this piano over here."  The guy sits the octopus up on the piano bench, the octopus spreads its tentacles, then proceeds to play the most beautiful rendition of "Moonlight Sonata."  The whole bar applauds, and the guy grins and says to the bartender, "Ok. Gimme my hundred dollars."  "Hang on a second," the bartender says. "I think I have a guitar back in the broom closet. I'll bet he can't play that." The bartender walks away to the broom closet and returns shortly with a beat-up acoustic guitar. The octopus grabs the guitar with one tentacle, tunes it up, then plays a nice flamenco piece.  "Well then," says the guy. "Will you be paying me my one hundred dollars now?"  "Let's try one more instrument." says the bartender. "I think I have some bagpipes down in the basement." Sure enough, the bartender goes down to the basement and comes back up moments later with bagpipes. "I'll double it if your octopus can play these!" he says confidently, and hands the bagpipes to the octopus.  The octopus fumbles around with the bagpipes for a minute, but doesn't play it.  "Aha!" says the bartender, "I knew he wouldn't be able to play those!"  "Play them?" says the octopus. "As soon as I get its pajamas off, I'm gonna fuck it!"  end of test...
