      alot has happened ot me this year in Dec 2003-Jan 2004 i had the flu februrary i had a spinal tap to check for blindness(turned out negative) in June i met my sister for the first time and her family and in July some guy from dallas asked me out on a date errm i think hes a bit over zealous cause he said he loved me and i barely know him and anyways i love my best friend in that way although we live many many miles away that doesnt change how i feel about him

      its bene awhile hasnt it?&nbsp; i know my lifes kinda boring so i wont take up too much time.&nbsp; I work for my Mom and have for awhile.&nbsp; I plan to remedy the situation(well maybe someday)&nbsp; Theres a guy i like actully two( i know it sounds like some teeange issue nobody gives a damn about)&nbsp; one lives far away sees me as a friend and would prolly encourage me to go out on a date the others reall sweet and quiet and close by.&nbsp; But even when im wiht him sometimes i feel well....... guilty like ive done something im not supposed to........well have I? sometimes i wonder if im doing the right thing cause i really really like the fellow far away but&nbsp; to him im jsut a friend.&nbsp; *sigh* i dont know what to do anymore.&nbsp; the cramps make me veyr short tempered(im generally short tempered anyways but shorter then usual) well i guess i should go for it but somethin tells me not to&nbsp; maybe its jsut me holding myself back but still...my friends a bit psychic and maybe thats why i feel so guilty if HE(the local guy)&nbsp;kissed me it wouldnt be as bad&nbsp; but sitll i have this&nbsp;gut feeling i should hold out or something cause the other fellows the one i want ot be with  he doesnt trust me tho and that might be the downfall&nbsp; evne as a best friend its&nbsp; a bad idea not to trust your friends
