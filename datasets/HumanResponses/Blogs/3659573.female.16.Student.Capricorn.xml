      god, today i am lonely. i've found myself thinking alot today about my future - thinking about what is in store for me. sometimes i wish that i could see what it will be like, right now . . . but i know i will enjoy it all the more if i have to wait for it. god, sometimes i don't understand why i can't be in a relationship right now, why i can't have someone to share my days with. to me, i seem ready - or rather it seems like i could be ready. some days i just get so lonely, just wishing that i had someone to phone and talk to . . . about my bad day, about my good day . . . or just to say hi really. i long for a relationship. as i look out the window right now, the sky is dark and cloudy . . . it looks like it is about to storm. and i can't help that relate to how i feel right now. god i've been storing up this loneliness for a long time, and one day i know that it is just going to rain - its going to pour . . . and i won't be lonely anymore.  god, i trust you . . . i know that your timing is best, no matter the ups and downs i go through. you have picked out someone for me to spend my life with, and you have also picked out people for me to be in relationships with. god . . . help me to be patient. sometimes i just want to grow up, and get there faster. help me to enjoy this period of my life, help me to accept my singleness as an opportunity to get to know you even better. and god . . . help me with my loneliness. you are the only one who can truly fill that void. and i need you to - if i go into a relationship with all this baggage that i am carrying . . . it won't last.  god, i also pray for my future relationships - help me to continually rely on you, to bring everything to you in prayer. help me to be wise in choosing my relationships, and to be wise in maintaining them. god i pray that you would help my with my emotional needs. i get so emotionally attached to guys way to quickly - sometimes i can be too trusting. god i don't want to give myself away easy, i want to be a woman of god - to be pleasing in your eyes. god, i also pray for my future man. wherever he is, whoever he is - i pray that you would keep him safe, and that you would also be preparing his heart for the future.  i love you.

      god, right now i feel like i am going no where with you. i have been slipping and slipping . . . and it feels like you're not here. part of me feels guilty for even thinking such a thing . . . because i know that you promised me you would always be here. so if you are here, how come i can't feel you right now? i guess i never really needed to ask that question . . . because i think i know the answer. i have been avoiding you in my own little way . . . not reading my bible, only talking to you when i feel i need your help, and getting angry when i don't seem to get it. i'm sorry god. now when i take time to think about it . . . i have felt it. i just didn't want to. last sunday, when i was at the place. it was almost like i could see you walking among the chairs - and it was the weirdest feeling i have ever had. and i have had that feeling a few times since. those were times when i was really feeling you . . . it was like i could almost see you. and you were so graceful god - i just wanted to reach out and touch you. it was just you, walking between the rows . . . with this look of pure love on your face - and it almost looked like you were searching my heart. god what are you trying to say to me? i get this feeling that you are just watching me, saying "slow down - just listen, to me. rest, in me" oh god i want to so bad, i want to rest in you . . . help me - give me the strength to put aside everything that is hindering me from drawing near to you. help me to put aside my pride, my arrogance . . . and all the things that i don't even see for myself. god i have lost sight of you . . . the blinders are up - but thats not how i want it. i'm sorry god. will you forgive me? it seems so little to ask . . . but i know its all you want to hear. take me home again father.

      Delight yourself in the LORD     and he will give you the desires of your heart.      - Proverbs 37:4  that is a big promise . . . but the more i look at it, the bigger the commitment. delight yourself in the lord. thats a hard thing to do sometimes. there are times when i am so lonely, so disappointed, so frustrated - that the last thing i want to do is be "delighted" in god. what does it mean to me delighted in god? i see it as being in awe of him . . . completely mesmerized by his beauty, by his character. thats crazy . . .but i want to be crazy if that means being head over heals in love with god. and since i don't think that anyone is every going to read this blog - this whole thing is going to be my letters to god. if people do read it . . . its ok, maybe some of the things i go through will help you where you are at.

      on days when i'm down, i have to remind myself that its ok to be disappointed, its ok to feel let down. don't you ever feel guilty for being disappointed? especially when you know you have things pretty good? but god tells us to come to him in everything . . . even in our bad moods, our disappointment, or doubts.  i like this song, because its saying, ya things do get rough sometimes, thats what this world is all about . . . but we can still hold on to god.  BROKEN WORLD                -by ACROSS THE SKY  Promises shattered Answers don't come Friends say goodbye Plans come undone Dreams get crushed Lies get told Words can turn cruel Hearts can grow cold  In a broken world where we cry to feel Some hope that helps these hearts to heal You're my strength, You're my refuge In a broken world, Jesus I'm holding to You  You make sense of the madness And You make darkness flee You bring such a calm To the chaos in me Show me life Tell me truth Day after day I keep running to You

       ever get tired of life? i do. I am right now. Sometimes I sit and wonder why we really do all the things we do, why we try so hard to succeed. Everytime exam time comes around, that joyous season of studious cramming, I find myself buried in my books. Am i actually studying? Well, for some of the time I am. But its at these moments that I start thinking, this is really silly. lol, ever feel that way? A whole 4 months have been spent building up for the one day where i will spend 2 hours trying my hardest to remember every little detail that crossed my path in those 4 months. then i leave, and forget it all. ever feel that its completely pointless?  But one thing that I notice everytime . . . God uses these times to show me how much I have been ignoring him. Its the really stressful times that I hear his voice, calling me to spend some time with him. and I can choose to keep on mindlessly studying (in one ear and out the next) or I can choose to commune with my best friend. lol which would i rather do? strangly enough . . . I often don't pick hanging out with my best friend. ironic isn't it? we would rather bury our noses in the books, then listen to god. we would rather get good grades, then be on good terms with god. we would rather rejoice in our success, then glory in his love. it baffles me.  so on life goes . . . and I must hit the books again - but not before I go take a moment to renew my mind over a talk with my best friend.

       "beauty is in the eye of the beholder"   catchy little phrase I am sure you have heard or seen it more than once in your life. Beauty is something we all want, don't you want to look beautiful? Don't you want to act beautiful, to sound beautiful - to simply be beautiful? but there is good news out there for those of us who maybe don't seem to have it all - that is where "the beholder" comes in. God - he is our beholder at all times. No matter how he looks at you, from whatever angle - he thinks that you are beautiful. He thinks that everything about you is beautiful, he created you - so he knows you in an intimate way. Intimacy. He loves me even when he knows the bad stuff? He thinks that I'm beautiful even when in the intimacy of our relationship he sees all the things that I've done? just something to think about whenever you feel like you're not beautiful. those days where you look in the mirror and just want to crawl into a corner. He thinks you are beautiful . . .
