        After having found at apartment, I was so bored already. I remembered that on top of the workload we had, I had decided to leave Wismar for Berlin. It will be my first exploration outside, really nervous to speak to the Grandmas at the train ticket counter. Managed to get the ticket after much confusion due to the language problem. Off I went, and exactly 3 hours and 2 min later, I arrived in Berlin Zoolg. Garten. I was so excited. I have read so much about Berlin, heard so much, I was bursting with excitement. I stayed at the Youth Hostel, went to the amazing   urlLink  Potsdamer Platz   .. The buildings are fantastic. Every night while I was in Berlin, I would just hang out at Sony Centre, taking a seat beneath and magnificent structure. Such simply pleasure in life! :)   The feeling of loneliness do creep up sometimes... in moments of great happiness, there will always be at least a tiny bit of loneliness.   I went to the Film Museum at Sony Centre,   urlLink  Jewish Museum    by Daniel Libeskind, 1936 Olympic Stadium built for propaganda, Concentration Camp, Checkpoint Charlie, Alexander Platz, New National Gallery by Mies van der Rohe,   urlLink  Brandenburg Gate   .   Having to queue up outside in the cold Winter for 2 hours to enter the Reichstag was not easy. Queuing alone, having no one to talk to, was also not so cool, but freezing cold. It is amazing how long the queue is everytime. But the long wait was worth it. The Reichstag is simply amazing. It was different to see it from the books and to be there to experience it.   I have always been fascinated with Germany's history ever since I studied history in  Sec 3/4. When I was at the   urlLink  Checkpoint Charlie    and later, with Jane, at the Mauer (Wall) Museum, I wondered how it must have felt for people to go through this era.   Being in the Concentration Camp at Orianenburg, Berlin, was a very sad experience. The other trip to a concentration camp was Terezinstadt, Concentration Camp at Terezin in Czech Republic which was 4 months later, both days were cloudly, rainy as though the weather had been arranged deliberately to create the solemn mood. On entering some buildings where the prisoners were kept and tortured, I felt sick. It was very eerie too. When I was in Terezin stadt with a group of German people, traveling on the same tour, there were also very quiet. 2 of them from Bremen, whom I was particularly close to during the trip, talked about their feelings. They were really upset about the past.   Berlin is one of my favourite cities as there is a cinema at Sony Centre, in which the films are shown in the original language, so there will be no irritating German dubbing and finally I can watch a movie after such a long time! Just for background info for people who do not know, everything on TV is dubbed. Imagine Keanu Reeves having a different voice and speaking perfect German! OMG!   Time spent away from home, made me realized more about myself. I have never dreamt how happy I am to watch English movies on TV and in the cinema. I have never dreamt how much I miss watching Anime in original Japanese Dialogue without the irritating German dubbing. I remembered feeling upset that it was so difficult to understand the dialogue especially some action was going on TV... How Inuyasha also can speak perfect German. and listening to German beginning and ending songs, instead of the familiar original Japanese ones... Imagine how your German friends are surprised when you lend them a non-dubbed movie with English subtitles... Imagine how I jumped around the common lounge when I was in Sweden because I saw for the first time after months, an movie in English and last of all, imagine the expression on my Swedish friend's face when he saw me jumping up and getting all excited, in front of an old TV....

       This website is to document my stay away from home. For people who do not know exactly, I left Singapore on 31 August 2003 with Finnair. I stopped in Bangkok for 1 hour and then went above whole Europe, to transit in Helsinki for 2 hours. I reached Berlin for 1 hour and then for finally in Hamburg. Sigh.. What a trip.   I have to thank friends and family who came to send me off from Changi Airport. It was such a tearful occasion. I was too emotional too. haha... It is quite amusing to think back now... I miss you all though.. Terribly.    The tale of how a girl who has never stayed away from home for such a long time... How she has to learn how to cook, how to do everything on her own, trying to understand alien languages such as German, how she is going to survive in Germany alone.    It is also funny how I cannot express myself with words like "sian" anymore.. And how I can no longer say "jia lat" or "dun kan cheong lah"...  "Kein Problem!" has become one of my favourite words.. Strange huh.. I am sure you all can guess what it means now, No problem!    Story of the Homeless Foreigners   The school did not help us in terms of accommodation. The International Affairs department does not care, sadly for us. This is not an attack, it is nothing but the truth. Many of my classmates were homeless as we have sent the application for hostels 4 months before we leave, but sad to say, the lady in-charge of the accommodation accused us for not replying to the confirmation letter, which we had no idea what that was. We have received nothing. This story has been used several times on my fellow classmates. So some of us, "Auslanders"(foreigners in German), are homeless and a good friend from India, Kapil Sinai Surlakar, was stuck in Wismar, with no money as the banks here are so "efficient" and no place to stay. The other 2 homeless people are Mira Tania Rahenod, from Indonesia and another girl from Ecuador. I stayed 1 week in the youth hostel and then with these other 3 homeless auslanders, we finally had the good fortune of meeting Thang Long from Vietnam. He has been here for a long time, also a student but doing Communication Design, but very influential. He is very young generous and happy-go-lucky. He let us stay at his place for 1 month. Can you imagine, 4 other people staying in his 1-room apartment... And he also invited us for his discourses at the Castle Gottesgabe. He also found an apartment for us. He is our first friend in Germany.     Architectural Lighting Design: Winter Semester, Year 2003   We had a good mix of people from all other the world. We have friends from Finland, Bulgaria, Slovenia, Turkey, Indonesia, Thailand, China, India, Ecuador, and Germany. 1 from Singapore.  We have lots of fun, parties in the studio. Fun bunch of people.   School has started too, we have installations in Rostock, another city in Germany, Hannover, Schwerin. We have guest speakers too from all over the world.  Things seems to be fine. Wismar is on the world heritage list too, a mini-old Stockholm city. However, I find life a little dull here. I am used to big cities, hanging out, coffee bean and starbucks.. foodcourts and shopping. Watching movies too.

       Hej! learnt a bit of swedish when I was there for 2 months. For those who do not know, I was in Stockholm between 21 March to 28 May 2004.  urlLink Stockholm  is a paradise for me, a good change from Germany.. haha...&nbsp; &nbsp; I was there for a short course on daylighting. Well, while it was spring in Germany, Sweden was still suffering from a Winter hang-over. It was much much colder at that time, compared to Germany.  &nbsp;  Swedish landscape is really really amazing. Just taking a bus to an absolutely ULU place could be so enchanting.. Swedes are really nice! I have made really nice friends and I have to say  Tack!  (Thanks in Swedish) to Kent too. They are really helpful and also very cheerful. Trying to crack some jokes and drink as much as Germans. Such a pity that they are not able to buy cheap beers in Sweden. &nbsp; The swedes are also very funky, well-dressed and well-groomed. The girls are known to be&nbsp;CHIO&nbsp;too.&nbsp;You can instantly point out the non-Swede from a distance&nbsp;by the clothings. haha..&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;   Living like a Swede   The hostel I stayed at was fantastic. It looks like a cottage from the outside, but it has a fantastic washing machine, dryer, table-tennis facilities, sauna.&nbsp;Apparantly, saunas are very important to them.. I supposed it is because of the harsh winter they have. &nbsp; They usually do not have holidays, only public holidays. They all take a month off in July to make use of the sunshine available in Summer. They play hard in Summer to make up for the lack of sunshine in Winter..&nbsp; In fact, Stockholm city&nbsp;reminds me a lot of Singapore. I was really happy to just take the train and go to places and hang out in the  urlLink  Gamla Stan   (Old city). Wismar looks like the old city of Stockholm and it is interesting to note that Wismar used to be part of Sweden so we see more swedish flags in Wismar than German flags. We also have the Swedish festivals in Wismar too. &nbsp;  &nbsp;  I was so happy to find Marie biscuits, Cream crackers&nbsp;and also Lipton Tea, as there are no such things in Germany. Very deprived...&nbsp; The first time I stepped into the Asian market in Stockholm, I nearly cried because I saw tofu, mangos, chilli, fish balls.... &nbsp;  &nbsp;  I had a classmate who is into furniture design and manufacture. He actually does not like Ikea.  urlLink Swedish design  is really cool, not just Ikea. Most shops displayed designer-looking stuff. There is a shop I particularly love. Graniti. Like Muji, but swedish design. The prices are quite ok, compared to the rest of the swedish-designer stuff.. &nbsp;  &nbsp;   Swedish Archipelago &nbsp;  I love  urlLink Swedish Archipelago  the most. The islands are so beautiful.  urlLink Utö  is really fantastic. I have never appreciated nature so much before. I went to this island with a few swedish friends from the hostel and they wanted to fish there. I was never interested in fishing, so I rented a bicycle and went around on my own. I had no map, so I just cycled and cycled and cycled. I bet it must be the farthest i have ever gone in my life. It was really cool because I had no idea what was there, I just went on and discovered some really nice spots for picnics.. The swedish people have a really high standard of living. The summer houses are so pretty and they merge completely into the surroundings and are never intrusive. I was up on this mountain, saw some abandoned iron mines and I have gotten lost in the Nature park. I came by a summer house and asked the owner for directions. He recommended me a place and I went to search for it. I came to this&nbsp; heavenly place. (sorry guys, should u the photo next time). &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Another&nbsp;island I have gone to is   urlLink Vaxholm  . This island is quite built-up compared to the Utö. It has a fortress on it too. &nbsp; Another of my favourite islands is   urlLink Sandhamn  . A friend and I went round the island by foot. We came across sandy beaches, walked through some&nbsp;nice wooded areas,&nbsp;slept on a beach,&nbsp;trying to maintain balance on the tricky rock formations...&nbsp; &nbsp;    The Vikings and Runestones   A friend Monika and I went to&nbsp; urlLink Sigtuna .&nbsp;     Sigtuna, Sweden's oldest town, is an attractive small town with picturesque wooden houses, winding lanes, gardens and attractive shops and cafés.A millennium ago, Sigtuna was the most important town in the country. It was founded around 980 AD by Olof Skötkonung who built a royal hall in the middle of the town. The first Swedish coins, bearing the image of Sigtuna's founder, were minted there. Around the year 1100, Sigtuna became the bishop's seat when nearby Uppsala was still pagan.   The town plan and runic inscriptions are from the Viking era, around 150   urlLink  runestones    can be found in and around Sigtuna.  The city also has church ruins and a brick church from the Middle Ages, buildings from the 18th and 19th centuries and the Town Hall built in 1744, the smallest in Scandinavia.  Wherever you go you feel the presence of history. Storgatan, the Sigtuna High Street, has had an identical location for one thousand years and is today a popular place for a walk among pretty houses, garden cafes, small shops and arts and handicrafts workshops.     &nbsp;   urlLink  Absolut Ice Bar and Ice Hotel    Absolut Ice Bar is absolutely icy! The whole bar is made of ice. There are  urlLink ice cups , ice counter, ice tables. I read the Ice Hotel magazine and saw that Singaporeans are famous in going all the way to the Ice Church of&nbsp;the Ice Hotel for wedding.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;   Swedish Festivals -   urlLink  Walpurgis Eve    We celebrate Walpurgis eve on the 30th of April, a tradition of German descent from the 800 A.D. when a fire was lit to scare witches away. The tradition has since been modified and is now when we welcome the spring. Huge public fires are set ablaze and young men and women in their last year of school sing of the winter and darkness ending and that the sweet light of spring has come. &nbsp; Travel recommendation Anyone who wants to travel cheaply&nbsp;within Europe should consider  urlLink Ryanair  and  urlLink Easyjet . &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Sweden is a great place to visit.&nbsp; Given ***** out of *****

       Day 1&nbsp; -6 april 2004 Thanks to Jane who came all the way from&nbsp;Newcastle to check out Germany during the Easter vacation, she arrived on the&nbsp;early morning of&nbsp;my birthday.&nbsp;The day started early and then we explored a bit of Luebeck and then Wismar. Then we had some food at the Singaporean lady's restaurant! Singapore food on my birthday, what more can one ask for? In the evening, there was a party which we danced, drank until 2am in the morning.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Day 2&nbsp; - 7 april 2004 We woke up early to catch the 10am train to Rostock. Markus, a German friend who lives and studies in Rostock, a future doctor whom I met on the train a week ago. We started talking after I messed up the train ticket and he helped me to figure it out before the conductor got pissed off. Anyway, we started talking and turned out that he was in Singapore for a week, 2 years ago. He was backpacking for a year to figure out what he wanted to do in life and well, he chose medicine now. It was interesting to hear about Singapore from other people. Throughout all this time, there is not a single person whom&nbsp;I have met and has been in Singapore, not just Changi Airport. Anyway, a friendship at the most improbable place is formed. As Jane and I will be taking the train to munich from Rostock, Markus offered to show us around in Rostock before we take the night train. It was weird to hear someone talk about Singapore so enthusiastically and how he also commented that it is so expensive to live in Singapore...  &nbsp;  He was a good guide, we went to some places, had some Glühwein (Warm red wine) and a bockwurst at the Easter market. Later, we even went to the nice beaches of Warmemude where we drank some Rostocker Pils, Jever.........  &nbsp;  At 8pm, we boarded the train to&nbsp;Munich. We took the cheap seat. We tried to sleep the whole night but was unable too.. sigh..&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;

       Yeah, 26 more days to the Olympic games and 11 more days to the day&nbsp;I will finally&nbsp;be in Athens, Greece! How excited I am. The dream of being able to be in an Olympic city&nbsp;and attend an Olympic games has been a dream ever since I was 10 and part of the school Athletics team. The dream of being able to&nbsp;go to Greece is another big dream which was&nbsp;formed when I was studying Architecture in NUS. Playing Age of Mythology and watching Troy simply just heightened the excitement..  &nbsp;  It seemed like&nbsp;I have waited a life-time for this chance, to be able to step foot in Greece and there is no&nbsp;better time&nbsp;than during the Olympic games and be part of a dream.....&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

       Hi friends! This will be about speeding cars, BMW, Volkswagen. &nbsp; :) so I remembered the first time I ever took the car in Germany. We had to go to Rostock for an installation, so we all hopped into some groupmates' cars and off we went. First of all, the driver is sitting on the left side, not the right side. even the&nbsp;lanes are&nbsp;not on the&nbsp;same side as&nbsp;Singapore's. So some of my friends and I were so terrified&nbsp;while sitting in the car. The car seemed to be&nbsp;going in the&nbsp;wrong directions and the car was at the speed of 140km/h or even faster. Now, I am so used to the fast speed, will I ever get used to the thousands of traffic lights and crawling cars in Singapore again...  &nbsp; &nbsp;

       So, of course, in the land of beer, I have learnt a bit about beer, my friends.. do not be so surprised when you see me the next time. :) This education started of course, at the first "studio party" and of course, lots of cheap beer in the supermarket. We will never forget the cheap Netto "Stier" beer, which subsequently the  Stier club  was founded by Finnish Anssi Lehtonen, Turkish Baris Erbil, Indian Kapil Sinai Surlakar from Architectural Lighting Design Year 03/04 to honour this Stier beer. I was never in the club as the criteria of being a member is to drink 10 bottles of Stier (set by Kapil), which I have never met that criteria, not because I cannot drink, mind you, but because I preferred not to drink. haha... Drinking talent is in my bloodline. Even so, it did not stop me in setting the quotes for the club...&nbsp;     May Stier beer steer our life back in the right direction   Well, the nice thing about the system in Germany is the Refund system called the  Pfand . On the bottles are the words "Pfand" and how much you can get back when you return the empty bottle. This recycling system also applies to another products, such as mineral water bottles and other stuff. We have to seperate the rubbish into glass and their colours, Paper, Plastics, bio-degradable... We also have to buy our own plastic bags from shops as many shops do not give free plastic bags. We also have to buy our own rubbish bags and they come in all sorts of sizes and types. Back to the beer, well, beer is very very cheap here, cheaper than mineral water, cola, fruit juice... It is so cheap that people drink so much of it. Germans love it too, not just because it is cheap. Germans love beer so much that it is not uncommon to see people holding beer bottles in mid-day, afterwork, midnight, morning. Broken pieces of glass on the ground, on the grass, on the pavements, and even the broken pieces of glass from the telephone booths joined all these mixed broken pieces of glass on the ground.. sigh..  &nbsp;  Beer and any types of alcohol are valued by the people. The experience in Prague with a group of german strangers was interesting and a proof of how much Germans can drink. On the first night, no one talked as they were all tired taking the bus to Prague all through Germany. When we arrived in the morning, no one talked as everyone was still tired from the long night's ride. After checking into the hotel, everyone went back to sleep to prepare for that night's traditional Czech dinner with  Pivo  (Black beer in Czech),except for me. I went out immediately to take a nice but sleepy walk in the city. I met the group in the restaurant that evening and had the beer. Great Gulasch...  &nbsp;  After the dinner, they decided to go to a Cocktail Bar and apparantly I was the only one who was reluctant since I did not get the sleep they had in the day. Anyway, I had no choice as the Tour guide insisted that they would leave soon. However, they all started ordering drinks after drinks and they have started to talk to me in English and I was shocked. Truly shocked. They have managed to say quite a lot and even told me that I would be a freak if I did not order more drinks, so I had no choice and order Caiphrina and then Vodka Lemon (not lime, they had no lime and they all looked at me strangely.. sigh.. what a life). So after a couple of drinks, they have decided that they should look for another bar with a dance floor.. and so I had no choice but to follow and see what they were up to. And so it continued for sometime until 3am in the morning and I had to wake up at 7am the next day.. boo hoo.  &nbsp;  It was truly amazing how the lady who is sharing the same room as me is from Hamburg, but her family is from Wismar! How small the world is, but anyway, she smokes a lot. The thing is, I always smelled of her smoke, while she always smelled so nice. Sigh.. Anyway, the next evening and the following were all about drinking again. But beer has a great advantage is that no matter how shy people are, they will start talking, even in languages they are afraid to use.. strange.. but it is great for me in the situation as I made some friends.. Some were even so passionate about drinks that they even followed the DK's guide book of top 10 must-do-things.. and of course, some went round and round the streets, the city, to look for a Top-10-bar.. boohooo.. so I was so tired out due to the lack of sleep and late nights.. &nbsp; &nbsp; There is a whole lot of&nbsp;information about Beer and its  urlLink origin ,&nbsp; urlLink styles, health issues and everything else..  &nbsp;    Pils/Pilsner/Pilsener &nbsp;  The world’s first ever blond lager was created in 1842 in the city of Pilsen in what is now the region of Bohemia in the Czech Republic. It is named after its city of origin and is variably called Pilsener, Pilsner (without the middle “e”), or just Pils (an abriged version of the other two). Pils is arguably the most successful beer style in the world. Nine out of ten beers drunk in the world today are made according to the Pilsener style or a style directly derived from it.

       Strange strange strange. I managed to rent "Fulltime Killers" by Andy Lau and Takashi Sorimachi. It is really cool, or is it because I have not watched a decent HK film for such a long time? :)  what do do...sigh..  &nbsp;

       Yesterday, I was out, at the info booth again, asking them about where I can find the nearest Vodafone shop to buy a SIM card. One lady was so nice. She helped me and even made phone calls to find out which is the nearest shop there. I felt bad that she even have to make a phonecall, but the service is truly amazing. Much much better than you-know-who, those I have lived with for 10 months..  She asked me where I was from, and when I said Singapore, she was so happy and excited.   Wow, my sister went to Singapore and she loved it so much. She kept praising it. The people are nice, the place is so beautiful. I wish I can go there too . Amazing right? It made me feel kind of embarrassed.  At a shop at Monastirakis, the salesgirl asked where I was from. She was excited and then told her boss that I was from Singapore. I was quite surprised as to why she did that. Turned out that her boss has been to Singapore, not just once, but a few times.  This Greek man exclaimed that Singapore is so beautiful and clean.   He even asked me whether I know Sentosa.  I was embarrassed again, thinking about how beautiful Mykonos, Santorini must be, in comparison to Sentosa.. when Singapore has only imported sand, with good landscape planning, streets are all orderly and well-laid.. Unlike the natural, exotic, magical Greek islands with temple ruins for the Gods and Goddess of Olympia...  Well, so there must be more than natural landscapes which are attractive.. hmm, the people? I am sure about that.. I miss the service back home, people know how to do business, not like that attitudes we get from the nasty Germans... But well, Greeks are much better.. I am feeling more at home now, but still, the incident yesterday was terrible. Well, the information was wrong... About the prices for the stamps which I have gotten for some postcards on last Friday.. And yesterday, the other woman told me that I have to pay more for this particular one coz it is bigger.. oh shit... i asked her then what is going to happen to the ones i have already sent, all she said was "well, we have to pray that they will reach their destination" lamely.  Some germans I met, have some horrible misconceptions about Singapore, like it is forbidden to smoke at all and ....  But some whom i met exclaimed that it is certainly the cleaniest country in the whole.. yeah right.. better than Germany of coz.. with all the broken glass pieces from the beer bottles..  Ok... have to end here for today..

       Hi friends..  Am out now, going to all the weird places in Athens. Today's mission was actually to find carrefour. Things are so expensive here. Out of the countries I have been to, Greece is definitely the no.1 now, even Sweden is not so expensive, as you can always find something cheap somewhere... So decided to give Carrefour here a try. Well, it is interesting, because I finally found one after asking one of the people at the information booth. They told me to take a bus which led to some absolutely ulu place. But the route was interesting. Reminded me of Malaysia though.. :) but turned out that I was at the big shopping centre, with carrefour and intersports in there.  Just some background information, in case, some of you confirmed that I have finally gone mad.. Well, after staying in Germany for 10 months, any place seemed bigger and better relatively.. :) it is all relative, hahaha.. The next best thing which happened was that I have finally found a cinema!~ ~ ~ ~ Yeah! 3 cheers! Some bit of Background information was that For the past week that I was in Athens, I have been looking up and down, leaving no stones unturned, was that I still couldnt find any cinema. Well, when we think about cinema, we believe that we will be sitting indoors comfortably, with the air-con blasting, so cold that we have to wear sweaters sometimes.. but well, apparently, the indoor incinemas are closed during summer and the outdoor cinemas sprung up of nowhere, according to the Athens magazine. I also spent some more time searching for the outdoor cinema, but it is still no good as they only have a certain movie that particular day, at 9 and 11pm. But just 2 hours ago, my life changed for the better since I found the indoor cinema. Harry Potter will only be out on the 8th september. Have to wait, but well, feeling much better already...  However, when I was taking the metro and tram, couldnt help feeling terrible.. lots of people are streaming into Athens for the Olympic games, and they are all wearing shirts with their country's flag.. that is so unfair... The shops are all selling those sew-on badges, but becoz singapore is not so popular in the games, they did not even sell Singapore flag.. unfair.. boohoo... I am thinking of some drastic measures, like attempt to draw a flag on my shirt or something.. but the last time i drew a flag was primary school days, i believe...  Totally not prepared, getting all confused... national day is 2 days away and i am feeling lost... what does it mean to be a Singaporean? Especially when I cannot attend NDP and cannot watch it on TV too.. cannot see the flags and fireworks.. i am lost.. another crisis to be noted down on blogs...

It is indeed all the little things that we share which makes life a better place to live in.  3 more days to Singapore's 39th Birthday, wishing Singapore a Happy Birthday...  I am far away from Singapore, but these 11 months made me realize that there is indeed no better place than home.  Cheers!!

       I am finally in Athens! :) Athens is really hot! Although I have read a magazine saying strongly that Athens is a place where Architecture doesnt exist anymore... yep, it is true in a way, for people who have studied architecture.. but, i think Athens is a place full of vibrance, exciting, chaotic... it is a very good change from the strict, old, reserved, systematic, low-tech Germany...  I really enjoy Athens. I believe that I am survive in this place.. It is strange to note that the olympic fever has not yet reached its climax yet... In fact, I was expecting things to be more chaotic.. but things seemed to be ok...   11 more days to the Olympics. Went to check out the Olympic Stores and also the acropolis.. been climbing alot.. spent a few hours at the ancient Agora and to the Acropolis.. it is truly amazing, I can feel a strong aura in these places..  I have also bought a book about Greek Mythology and Legends to try to understand who is who... :) been reading these nights and I feel that I can relate more to the Greek temples now...

        The excitement to watch Table-Tennis today, the first event I am attending and the hope of meeting Singaporeans at last was so great that I couldnt sleep all night. Ended up with only 2 hours of sleep, I woke up in time and went to the Galatsi Olympic Hall. The game was ok. Only asians look so cool when playing table-tennis... They make the Caucasians look so gigantic and clumsy. I met a Chinese man who is now Japanese and used to be the Champion of Table-Tennis. He is also a coach now too. So we have a small discussion about the players, matches and techniques.... some politics in China... Amazing, I had the chance of meeting some of his Japanese friends and I ended up too cheering for the Japanese players.. There is this very decent Japanese match between Japan and Dom. Republic. It is really funny to see the supporters from Dom Republic to support their player who is a Chinese, but now, of course the status has changed. The match was really decent. It was a really close fight, but the Chinese have such a good reputation that they intimidate the competitor with just their presence. hahah... So Dom Republic won. Although just one look at the other 3 trashy matches going on, Japan really deserved to get into the next round. However, because this is by elimination, so 2 players from Japan has just said farewell to Table-Tennis Males Singles championship. It is quite sad, coz many chinese players have decided to play for other countries. Argentina, Dom Republic, Australia, Italy, USA. I have also to mention too that Gao Jun, Chinese lady who is No.1 Female Table-Tennis player has decided to join USA too. The bad news is that the china-born players who are representing other countries have not lost a single match yet.. are they truly invincible? So in the end, the Chinese will just have to trash it out amongst themselves.. Well, no one can be sure about such things, but I will stand by players from Singapore tomorrow. Bought a ticket for tomorrow and Monday.

       I have finally watched the Opening Ceremony with a Greek family on this day, after having a big fat hope of watching it "live" at the Olympic Stadium after making friends with a Volunteer who is a performer at the Opening Ceremony, I almost had a free ticket to watch it "live". Unfortunately, due to some unforeseen circumstances, it is still better for me to watch it with this nice Greek family. Well, it is better to watch it together with a Greek family than to watch it "live" with large crowds, but alone. I had a good time with the Greek family. Although the live broadcast was in Greek of course, the lady was so nice to try to translate to me somethings and I can hear some English bits sometimes.  I must say, the opening ceremony is fantastic. I love Greek mythology and was truly amazed to see how they tried to explain the history of Greece and the Games. It is really back to the start of the Olympic games. Although the Athlete representative forgot the oath halfway, the overall concept of the opening ceremony was cool.  I enjoyed it very much!!

       When I introduced myself to people and they are always so excited that I am from Singapore. Today, I have decided to get lost again. Yeah, decided. It is easy to get lost. But the good news is that the buses, trams, trolleys, metro always lead to some really nice places. So it is really quite fun to get lost.. So just now, I have decided to get lost again after boarding the bus from the Panalinthiko stadium ( amazing stadium, fully made of marble, which host the 1st modern olympic games in 1896). I have ended up at the last station and I was at the beach!  After a while, I went to the Tram station and asked a lady who is a volunteer for the Olympics (very easy to tell, because they are wearing this special olympics volunteer entire, with the colourful shirt and blue shorts/pants, waist pouch and the pass - now you know why I want to be a volunteer, right?) She is an australian and she can speak Greek! We boarded the tram together and we went along the coastline. Beautiful!! we talked a bit and we stopped at one station to change to another tram and she asked me for my name and she was told me whether I know what my name means in Greek, I said yes, " Glass ".  My boss told me before too and I was quite surprised. I mean, does Greek sound like anything at all? Or well, my name is Greek, huh? Yeah, at least I know a greek word. (i found out from my vietnamese friend, Thanh Long who told me that there is a waterfall in vietnam which is also called yali). Amazing indeed!  Back to the tram station, a greek lady sitting on the bench was also surprised to know that my name is glass.. and she exclaimed that Singapore is beautiful and they just watched a documentary about Singapore on TV last week. Amazing!  So ever now and then at work, when I thought that they are calling me, I have to remember that they are actually talking about something else...

       I am so happy today, met Singaporeans today. People from the Sports Council came to support the players. It is fantastic to be back in the company of Singaporeans... Listening to Singlish.... I think i must sound really weird to them by now.. But I have free ticket to the Badminton as a supporter! Yeah... So this post will not be so long.  Anyway, good news is that we won both matches this morning and got into the next round.  Have to support Singapore's Badminton Team and Table-tennis tonight again!  Cheers!
