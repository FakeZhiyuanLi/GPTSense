      I'm only writing a short blog today... its late in the day, and I'm out of time. First, I had a nice evening with C last night.  He's an interesting character and we always have a good conversation.  I guess its part of having shared some of the same experience as professional musicians, and now we're just government hacks.  He showed me some pictures of a couple of gigs we did and it brought back lots of memories.  He's a good player and a good guy and it was a pleasure playing together.  I get stressed and frustrated being around the house and its good to get out with friends.  I got a call from T today - he's looking at buying a 65 foot sailboat.  He's as big a dreamer as I am.  He's considering selling his house and living on the boat - I guess its a pretty common sentiment among men of a certain age.  Sure looks appealing! Later....

      One thing interesting about blogs and such is that you have confirmation that everyone is equally messed up in their own sweet way. The only difference is that some people's lives are more messed up, because they can't seem to control it. I suppose, from that point of view, I'm lucky, because my life is fine - but it wasn't always that way. One thing I've got going for me is discipline - I can make myself do things I don't want to do. The down side of that is that I'm to disciplined at times and I've made choices based on what I think I "should" do, rather than what I wanted to do. Its always a balance that you never can acheive. I suppose some of it is if you listen with your heart or with your head (and which one!). That's largely a personality thing and its beyond an individual's control. That's what makes life interesting - everyone is different. You wouldn't really want to live on a planet with everyone the same as you, would you - I sure wouldn't! Since everyone has to create their own lives, there are a few bumps along the way, as you discover what works and what doesn't and try to implement what you've learned. The challenge is that everything changes constantly, so just when you think you've got it figured out, the rules change....interesting. My objective is to try to stay loose and not get to stressed about what's happenning. Remember no one gets out alive so have some fun in the meantime!

      I'm still waiting for my first comment.... I eagerly check my blog several times during the day, expecting some nasty remark or words of encouragement.   So far, none have been forthcoming.  Perhaps my faithful readers feel intimidated by my writing prowess or feel that their mere words would not do justice to my lofty ponderings.  Here are a few sample comments you may wish to consider using. "Get a life ya looser!" "What a self-indulgent asshole you are!  Do you honestly think anyone cares????!!!" "People like you are what's wrong with this world!"  The above are merely suggestions, feel free to compose your own.  The only comments which I despise are those with biblical quotes reminding me of how Jesus loves me and is willing to forgive my many sins if I only had the balls to repent!  Today, I had a Big Meeting (as they're called) with the honchos regarding some work I'll be doing.  It was an easy sell, as they're all real estate types and understood what I was talking about.  Interestingly, my project was the only one approved out of a raft of money-wasting schemes floated.  Since my work is based in reality (ie: Land information), the end product is something of lasting value which can be built upon, rather than some airy-fairy scheme that is as likely to vanish into the ether as Tinkerbell on her way back to Never-Land.  I managed to get a bunch of stuff off my desk today, which always feels good.  Things tend to pile up easily and sometimes I have to run my ass off to get stuff moving.  Mostly, I don't like to be rushed and I prefer having the time to consider things rather than having to dash off an immediate response.  I usually find that other things come to mind over time, which help me to formulate a better response.  Unfortunately, I don't always have that time, however, I do my best to consider things carefully as often a lot of weight is placed on my conclusions.  But as I like to say, no one has ever died from a surveying error - although maybe that's not strictly true if you consider the outcome of some property disputes!  Something is wrong with the "good" computer at home now.  The old computer bit the dust last week and now the new one is acting strange.  I'm getting tired of doing the maintenance on them , as I never use them and am not responsible for maintaining them.  The parties that use them have hours to fool around on them, but can't seem to find the time to fix them when they've screwed them up - interesting.  Maybe its time they learn...... I'm getting tired of it.  Tonight I want to write up the songs we're doing for the 20th.   Right now, my notes are in a mess and I don't want to be trying to find my way through a pile of papers when we're gigging.  I've also got to go to Cdn Tire and pick up some parts for the boat tonight (see yesterday's post).  The plumbing is supposed to be done today, so that means all that's left of the kitchen renos is painting, lighting and flooring (in that order).  The flooring contractor came last night and took the measurements, so he can order the materials.  He's going on holidays in a couple of weeks and it seems unlikely that he'll do it before he goes (after telling me he could do the work right away - which got him the job in the first place!).  I told him to get it done before school starts - he assured me he would - yeah, right!   These flooring guys seem like a funny lot.  He's my second choice as the first guy proved to be even less reliable.  Well, that's it for today.... no big earth-shattering revelations, other than that according to The Daily Reckoning (a contrarian economic newsletter) oil prices are set to go through the roof in a couple of years - I wonder if I should sell my gas-guzzling boat?  I'm planning on moving it next year and doing less cruising anyway, but it will be harder to sell if fuel prices go up.  I'm planning on buying something more fuel-efficient eventually anyway. (read: sailboat).  Thoughts???

      I'm back from my very nice weekend.  Judging by the huge numbers of comments received (0), I'm sure that many people are waiting with bated breath, to know all the details.  Some suggest its narcissistic having a blog.  Of course - its a narcissitic self-indulgence, what isn't?  Everyone is looking out for their own asses in some way, shape or form.  Even doing what is "right" at great personal cost, is ultimately selfish, in that its what   you   think   you   should do.  One could argue that a parent makes great personal sacrifices for their children, but isn't it really doing what you feel you must do, whether you want to do it or not? Now that I've justified my narcissitic self-indulgence to my own satisfaction (and that's all that matters to me) - here ya go! Ah, the weekend....  Friday night we rehearsed at G's place and came up with a name for our duo.  How does, "Sound Check" sound?  Its not easy coming up with a name that is suitable.  Its fun brain storming for names, but they've gotta work to.  My favourites were, "The Viagra Boys" and "Hack-Job", but I realized that they might not work in some situations.  I'm feeling pretty good about the music (Classic Hits stuff) and I think we'll do okay on the 20th.  G is pretty experienced, as I am, so its pretty well a cakewalk if I can remember the arrangements! Saturday, I worked on the kitchen reno and made pretty good progress.  I'm really sick of the mess the house is in and I can't wait to finish this.  Its only been 2 weeks, but its pretty hard to live in a construction site.  As I get older and more crochetty, I find my tolerance for disorder and chaos in my personal environment less palatable.  I can see myself at 80, if I live that long - I'll be the nastiest old bastard you've ever met! Saturday night we went to N's place for dinner and he showed me how to cook his wonderful Indian cuisine.  It was fun to learn how to prepare the delicious dishes.  N is a very patient and classy individual, so he makes the process of learning almost as fun as eating the results!  We also enjoyed his excellent piano playing.  His daughter L was home and she babysat A and A and also played the piano beautifully for us.  I've always been a big fan of L's and it was nice that she stayed home and visited with us.  They just got back from 2 weeks in England and had a great time.  N showed us his excellent photos - truly a man of many talents! Sunday, I went to the boat and did some work on it (installing storage racks, etc...)  S and C came to visit.  They just bought a boat to, although its a fair bit smaller (18 feet).  They were impressed with the marina and they're considering putting their boat in there, as its easier than trailering it all the time.  I think they would have enjoyed going out for a cruise, but the weather didn't look promising, so I elected not to go out.  I'm very safety concious on the boat and I'm not about to take chances with anyone's life or my beautiful boat.  I did however move the boat in the marina and handled it pretty well, I must say!  I'm still learning how to handle it and I've got a lot to learn.  Its really like learning to drive all over again - except that a boat is succeptible to wind, current and doesn't have brakes - imagine trying to park your car in a busy parking lot under those conditions - not to easy, is it? I discovered a small leak in one of the heater hoses, when I was doing my inspection of the engine.  I pissed me off, because I had told the boat mechanics to replace everything that may be in the least problematic, as I didn't want problems during the brief boating season.  I had noticed that the hoses looked old and pointed it out to them, but they reassured me that hoses were find and didn't need replacement - now one is leaking.  I'm going to replace all of them - I believe in preventative maintenance, particularly when I can be far from land in the boat and far from help if it develops problems.  Its no big deal doing the work, but it bugged me that I tried to prevent just such a problem and now I have to deal with this.  The lesson here is to trust my own judgement and not listen to the "experts". Today we're having the dishwasher and plumbing done in the kitchen.  This will help us get back to normal, as we've been doing the dishes in the bathroom sink - what a pain!  Hopefully, after today, we can put things back together in the kitchen.  The only outstanding items at this point are the flooring, backsplash and some painting.   The flooring contractor is to come tonight and take his measurements, and I'm hoping the flooring can be installed in the next couple of weeks.  We're getting ceramic flooring and I've designed a pattern of white and blue tiles which will compliment the rest of the pieces.  I'm looking forward to seeing the outcome Well, that's it for now.  I need to get to work, as its piling up as I indulge in my narcissitic fantasy one more time! Feel free to comment on what an interesting life I lead and what a swell guy I must be.   Any negative comments about what a narcissitic asshole I am can be direct to G.W. Bush - I'm sure they would suit him.

      Here's a link to an interesting story describing what any thinking person already knows.  In spite of the rhetoric of how the Iraqis are embracing their new-found freedom, there remains real work to be done.   urlLink http://www.startribune.com/stories/561/4915435.html

      I'm glad its Friday! This time of year, its hard to work, because I'd much rather be on vacation. Summers are so short and precious in Ottawa that you want to make the most of them. The temperature has dropped lately, and its already cool at nights (12 degrees). Its nice for sleeping but its an omen of things to come - yuck! Tonight I've got a rehearsal for my gig on the 20th.  I'm not really looking forward to the gig, because its right when I'd like to be on holiday on my boat.  There are only a few good weeks left in the summer and I don't like to loose one of them.  I'd rather gig in September, but we have to do this to get there - oh well...  I've gigged so often that its not much of a thrill anymore - its just something that I like to do.  It feels comfortable and natural - like a job you enjoy. Tomorrow, I'm going to do the electrical work for the kitchen reno.  I've got to wire up some applicances and lights.  Tomorrow night, we're going for dinner at N's place which should be fun. Sunday I'm going boating - I'm looking forward to that. Today, I'm wrapping up some work from the week and looking forward to having a couple of days off to pursue some of my own interests - which is what weekends are all about! Have a great weekend!

       urlLink    These are pictures of Tulum which is an amazing pre-Columbian site on the Carribean side of Mexico. Those handsome dudes are my brother Ben and I.  Visiting Tulum was one of the high-lights of my vacation in Mexico in February 2003. When we visited Tulum, it was toward the end of a hot afternoon.  The breeze off the Carribean was refreshing and we went for a swim in the small cove to cool off. The ocean side of Tulum is all a cliff except for the small cove which is a white-sand beach.  This configuration enabled the Mayans to repulse Cortez when he came along on his raiding mission.
