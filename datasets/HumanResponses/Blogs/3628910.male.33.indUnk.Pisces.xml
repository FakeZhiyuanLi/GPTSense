      So much to say about this one. Martina and I met up with Dave in Brighton for breakfast and coffee while we were waiting for Ben and Claire to arrive from Barcelona. We nipped back on a train just in time to meet them and head off to Somerset. The England match took some of our attention on the journey and we could hear the penalties as we walked up to our camping spot. Dixon had nicely pitched our tents so there was little to do apart from start the party.  Highlights were Groove Armada on the Pyramid stage, but they were on a bit too early in the daylight. Fergie in the Dance Tent and The Chemical Brothers on the Other Stage on Friday night. Saturday Ceefax, DJ AFX, Plaid and Bonobo were all in the Glade. Also saw some amazing juggling by Jay Gilligan and Manu Laude. Sunday there was a seminal performance by Orbital.

      Went back to this route with Stuart to claim the top two pitches. The very last pitch i thought was not very nice. it had loose flaky sharp rock on it.

      Went up to Le Passet (above Barberine) with Rebecca to climb Tout Ca Pour Ca. We were both pretty hung over from a bit of a drinking session caused by the England game being a good score, and starting early when it was happy hour at Bar d'Up.  We didnt take enough clothes and had to turn around two pitches from the top because we were both too cold. The last two pitches that we did do though were stunning. Really nice moves.

      Went up to Blaitiere with Stuart to climb Majorette Thatcher but the route was too wet in the 5+ crack after the 6b section to continue. retreated and had a go at Deux Goals instead. we did the first two pitches and then headed up the rest of Nabat Leon as we dropped the guidebook and were not sure where the rest of it went.

      Ran the second pub quiz at the Derapage. Not a bad turnout but the questions were a bit too easy with high scores of 22 (from 30 questions) and a lot of scores in the high teens.

       urlLink Montreux Jazz Festival - Miles Davis Hall    Went to the Groove Nation night to see Spearhead and the P-Funk All Stars. Spearhead were good but not as good as they were at Glastonbury a couple of weeks ago. The P-Funk All Stars however were outstanding a riot of colour, fashion and sound. Excellent.

       urlLink Montreux Jazz Festival - Casino    Went to see Jamie Cullum at the Casino on Montreux. I had heard about him but never heard him or seen him before. The lad can tinkle the ivories well and has an amazing voice, but what a performer. Excellent show.   The other acts; Michael Von der Heide and Ute Lemper were pale in comparison.   Thanks to Sarah for all the driving, and Lucy for the tix

       urlLink Avalanche Cup - M�gavalanche - Maxi Avalanche - Transv�subienne >> descentes VTT sprint et marathon : Le site officiel    My first round of the Coupe d'Europe in long distance downhill. Excellent course, plenty of technical stuff with lots of good passing opportunities in the upper section of the course. The snow was bullet proof in the morning for the first run and i think i must have taken the 7+ to its fastest speed ever on that section, the brakes were smoking coming from the snow to the rock. In the afternoon run the snow was slushy and it really took it out of you, some high altitude breathing experience might have helped quite a bit.   This race is like the MegAvalanche but without any uphill, with better technical sections and there is a cafe and toilets to sit and wait in at the top for the 3 hours it takes them to line everyone up. Sorted.
