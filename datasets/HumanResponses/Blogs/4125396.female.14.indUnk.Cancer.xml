We always told each other secrets, There wasn’t anything we kept from each other, I loved you more than anything, You were like my brother.  From kindergarten to 4th grade, You got teased for hanging out with a girl, Still you never left me alone, You put me before the world.  Then I fell in love, With some guy in my 7th grade class, And when he broke my heart, You were there to kick his a$$.  You were always there for me, Through the thick and thin, Always you were there, Being my best friend.  No matter what happened to us, Or came in our way, You never left me all alone, You were there to stay.  You threw me the biggest party, On my sweet sixteen, Everyone from school was there, But you I hadn’t seen.  As I went to open my presents, I opened your card first, It said the you loved me more than a friend, And my tears soon began to burst.  Then out from the corner of the room, You began to walk my way, Tears came streaming down my face, I began to runaway.  I locked myself in my room,  And cried tears to form a sea, And soon I realized we were more than friends, That we were meant to be.  I came out of my room, To find you standing there, I looked into your eyes, And realized you really cared.  So soon you became my boyfriend, And we kissed for moments to last, And forgot all about just being friends, Like we were in the past.  Then on my 21st birthday, You took me for surprise, As you went down on your knees, And I looked right in your eyes.  You took my hand so firmly, As you were about to change your life, You took a ring from in your pocket, And said, “Will you be my wife?”  I was so shocked my mind went blank, I didn’t know what to say,  As I softly spoke words so true, Tears came as I said, “Okay”  You looked at me and said, “I have another present waiting for you.” You opened the curtains only to see, A BMW painted blue.  We both jumped in, My brand new car, And we took off for a ride, Though we didn’t go far.  Another car started swerving, And right in a flash, That car and I, Had suddenly crashed.  It was a drunk driver, Who took my soon to be husbands life, And left me here all alone, His soon to be wife.  If it wasn’t for them, He’d still be alive, Just shows to what happens, When you drink and drive.  well i thought that was cute and kinda sad so im done writting for tonight love ya all *CASEY*

Probably not     But that didn't stop him from wishing that he did      Didn't keep from wanting or worshiping him       He guesses he saw him  about once a year     He could still feel the way he felt     Standing in tears      Stretching his arms out as far as they'd go     Wispering daddy, I wan't you  to know          I love you this much and I'm waiting on you     To  make up your mind, do you love me to?     However long it takes     I'm never  giving up     No matter what, I love you this much       He grew to hate him  for what he had done     'Cause what kind of a father, could do that to his son      He said 'damn you daddy', the day that he died     The man didn't blink, but  the little boy cried       I love you this much and I'm waiting on you      To  make up your mind, do you love me to?      However long it takes      I'm never  giving up      No matter what, I love you this much       Half way through the service      While the choir sand a hymn     He looked up above the preacher     And he  sat and stared at him       He said "Forgive me father"     When he realized      That he been unloved or alone all his life     His arms were stretched out  as far as they'd go     Nailed to the cross, for the whole world to know        I love you this much and I'm waiting on you      To  make up your mind, do you love me to?      However long it takes      I'm never  giving up      No matter what, I love you this much         i felt like putting that in its like one of my favorite songs ever!
