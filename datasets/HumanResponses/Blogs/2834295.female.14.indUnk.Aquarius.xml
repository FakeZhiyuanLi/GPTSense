      Mom is convinced that Esther is Sylvia Plath re-incarnated and therefore refers to her as "Crazy Esther Oven-Head." Every single one of Campbell's girlfriends has been cursed with some terribly juvenile nickname, but, the more I think about it, all of Campbell's girlfriends have been overly emotional, pretentious, and well deserving of their nicknames.   "Why did you and C.E.O.H. break up this time?" Mom asks casually, looking over both her reading glasses and the Sunday  Times . She's recovered from last night's bastardization of  A Streetcar Named Desire . Which is, of course, just more bastardation at the hands of Henry Jones, my father. He's been screwing with other things, too, namely Regina Wendell, The Typist, and the sacrament of Holy Matrimony.  "I told Esther that she should not be wasting her days away in 20s housedresses and gray houndstooth trench-coats," Campbell replies.   "Really?" I ask. Campbell shakes his head, so Mom makes the prying-eyebrows face.  "Well, because she's a lesbian," Campbell answers solemnly. "I'm not even kidding."  "Oh," Mom and I exhale at the same time. Even if she did have a hideous wardrobe, Campbell probably did love Esther, somewhat, despite her suicidal tendencies and cigarette-stench. Or, judging by his sadness-devoid face, he just liked her to an extent. Or felt the urge for another pretentious artiste girlfriend.   There's no point in analyzing it anymore, truly. He'll find another Maggie Gyllenhaal lookalike in a few hours in a bookshop.

      Dad comes home pissed, as usual. "The phone has been off the hook for the past hour, Lina!" he screams at me.  Mom rolls her eyes. "I was the last person who used it; don't yell at Lina," she sighs, graceful. She's changed into nicer clothes, her socialite clothes, and leads Dad into the kitchen with long, high-heeled strides.  Campbell and I sit at the kitchen table, listening to them battle, and it's like I'm seven all over again, back when my mother still had the bravado to defend herself: "GODDAMN IT, AMELIA! Why are you such a FLAKE?" "I'VE BEEN INHALING PAINT FUMES ALL DAY, YOU ASS!"   Campbell sidles over to the door and opens it a crack to watch. He ushers me over, and I can't do anything but join him. Dad picks up a hardcover from the stack of plays on the island and flings it at the wall. It falls into the trash can, and he stands stubbornly, refusing to pick it up. Mom stumbles over to it, and plops down on the linoleum floor, holding the book to her chest.  "Shit," Campbell murmurs, "It's  Streetcar ."  He could have thrown a bible at her head and hurt her less. No one screws with Tennessee Williams in this house.

      "'LEAD IS TOXIC,'" my brother reads the lid of a paint can in a pompous sports-announcer voice as my mother and I slave away, repainting his bedroom for the third time this year. This time, he's chosen dark purple with a British royalty theme.  "Campbell," Mom sighs, "shut up." She runs her hands through her hair, revealing large Glidden Casa Royale gashes on her forearms. "You're home early," she observes in tones of disgust.  "Esther and I broke up," he explains. He tosses a velour tasseled lampshade up and grasps it just before it hits the paint tray. I told him the shade was tacky and wouldn't be seen in a three-country radius of Buckingham Palace, but he bought it anyway.  "Again?" Mom expostulates. "I hope you at least had the decency to pay for her cab ride home this time."  "Why'd you pick this paint, anyway? It's so... feminine," I interrupt.    "I like plum," he defends himself.   "It's  tacky ," Mom declares.   "I know! That's why it's so great!" he grins, fingering the tassels. Mom rolls her eyes and continues to scrape dried paint off her jeans. "When's dad coming home?" he asks finally.   "Whenever he's done screwing his secretary," she snaps.  "His  typist ," Campbell corrects her. She glares at him and he, in his only act of decency for the day, picks up a roller brush.

      I'm not going to quit this blog, but I am changing it. Instead of the continuing story of the Joneses, it will just be a place for me to post random fiction I've written. Bits of screenplays and things like that, and the shitty one-act plays I've been trying to write so that I don't kill myself from rewriting stress.   Here are my favorite bits of a scene I wrote today for  Untitled Hollywood People are Scary Project , alias  HPaS .   (Harper, Kathleen's daughter, and Kathleen, a depressed actress, are chatting at the kitchen table.)  Kathleen: You know who I named you after?  Harper: The mentally unstable drug addict in Angels in America.  Kathleen: No. Although now that you mention it, I wish I had.   (The phone rings. Harper hops up to get it and checks the caller ID.)  Harper: It's Janie. (Janie is Kathleen's agent.)  Kathleen: Oh, just let it ring.  (Harper picks it up anyway.)  Harper: She's in a state of dishevelment at the moment and she doesn't feel like talking to anyone. Call back later, okay?   (She hangs up.)

      Posted a story on FictionPress last night, you can find it  urlLink here . It's loosely based from a plot in  Love is Nothing , except it's not something that's actually in the screenplay, because it's an internal monologue sort of thing. Anyway, go check it out. I'm gone for the weekend, so I'll see y'all soon.

      I posted another short story to  urlLink FictionPress.com , you can find it  urlLink here . It's loosely based on a screenplay again, one that's just an idea that I'm in the process of fleshing out. If the link doesn't work at first, give it some time, but please go check it out. I really like it, even though the last sentence has very little ending. (My own worst critic speaking.)   Sorry about the double-post last time.

      I posted a few of my stories up on the LiveJournal community writer_girls, and, basically, I was given the feedback that the first two (the ones I posted on FictionPress) needed to be part of something more. And, since they are, I decided that I'm going to post 'Love is Nothing' (the one the first story is cut from) on here. It's nowhere near done, and I still haven't started rewriting, but I'm putting the first few scenes up on here. Basically, it is multi-plot, but it's different from most multi-plot movies because the four main characters have been best friends for thirty years. But it's not 'Sex and the City' or anything like that. It's mildly depressing, but darkly comic.  Basically, they're all going around, pretty much happy-schmappy, until Julia's husband is shot on his way to work. She's appalled, grieving, yada yada yada, we cut to Grace at work. She's an ubernews producer, sort of like Jane in  Broadcast News  if Jane could handle it, but, obviously, she has no love life. She's married but hasn't seen her husband sober in over three years, and he spends most of his time out drinking anyway. Basically, she has to hire a cute new guy and you can all see where this is going. Then we meet Clara, bookstore owner, who gets a phone call from her ex-husband who lives in Chicago with their children, Emmy and Max, saying that Max has gotten a barely-thirteen year old girl pregnant and her parents are "cheesed off" so she better get her "skinny little can to Chicago pronto." And then we see Louisa, a very high profile novelist and her dysfunctional family who breaks down when she realizes what day it is. So, anyway, the first four scenes of 'Love is Nothing'.    ( Scene One: Julia's bedroom, morning.)    Julia Marciano  is asleep, wrapped in bedsheets and murmuring to herself softly, as her husband,  Jimmy , prepares for work, very loudly. She manages to sleep through it, somehow.   Jimmy : HAVE YOU SEEN MY DRESS SHOES?  Julia bolts awake.   Julia : You have four pairs.   Jimmy : Yeah, I need my brown ones!   Julia : They're all brown, Jimmy.   Jimmy : Really?   Julia : Yes.  She starts to fall asleep again, but Jimmy wakes her up.   Jimmy:  I'm going to work now.  He sits next to her on the bed and kisses her on the cheek. He leaves the room and Julia grins.   (Scene Two: Grace's office, around the same time.)   Grace is doing paperwork at her desk when her assistant, Moira, comes in, blushing.   Moira:  The guy for the cameraman job is here and, and he's very good-looking.   Grace:  Well, good for him.   Moira:  He's your type, Grace.   Grace:  I have one? I mean, is this guy a drunk?   Moira:  He seems like someone you would get along with, since he has already started poking fun at the makeup artists.   Grace : Poking fun? Thanks, Grandma Moira.  I know I said I was posting four scenes, but the next two are coming later since they need a bit of editing. So, have fun, comment, whatever.

      Not part of a screenplay or anything, just a short story triggered by... I'm not exactly sure. I like it, though.  I've made an effort for this to look nice. I did what she asked: no black, no heels, no briefcase, nothing designer. I do not look like her daughter, "the ball-busting career bitch." I am also not supposed to act like her daughter, "the ball-busting career bitch", I am not supposed to show that I am pained by all this effort that I am making and she is not returning.  I told her that she couldn't smoke, and if she was going to, she was not to put out the special glass ashtray she truly believes is Waterford crystal. She was to empty my former bedroom of Camels, half-empty gin glasses, half-finished cross-stitching projects, and anything else that might be wont to cause me visceral pain. We agreed that none of the neighbors needed to hear about how large my brownstone is or how much I make each month, because it is twice the size of their duplex and twice what they make in a year.  "Elaine," she smiles, flinging small flecks of ash into the forbidden ashtray, "whatever happened to your marriage?" She knows what happened, she knows that I walked in on my husband sleeping with my "administrative assistant," that I divorced him and fired her and let go.  "If I knew, I would tell you, Mother," I hiss. "Could you please put that out before the black lung sets in?" I made such an effort, and yet, my bedroom still houses abandoned Furbies and pictures of dead relatives I never met.  "Why am I here? What do you want?" I decide, finally. She swore she'd stopped drinking, and yet her array of shot glasses has worked its way to the bottom shelf of the cupboard with glassware that does not traditionally contain alcohol collecting dust on the top. My mother used to be lovely, before the smoker's lines and bad perms and Wal-Mart housedresses. She looked like the duchess of some portion of the United Kingdom, with cheekbones that could slice meat. She never coughed, and when she had to, it was moist and delicate.  "I am looking for a sign," she explains. I don't even ask because I know it. I know she's been drinking and she promised she wouldn't and that's just another thing in a chain of promises that never happened. She thinks I don't know that she killed my father, that the rest of the world is clueless to her murderess status. I am not the "clueless little shit" she has sworn I am so many times. I know it because I saw it.

      The Oscars are tonight.  Hmm, hmm, hmm. IFP Independent Spirit Awards. Hmm. Bill Murray won, yay. Bill Murray rocks because he was in Ghostbusters. Patricia Clarkson did not win. Shoreh Roxaboxen did, but whatever. I didn't watch most of it, because I was tired, but I did catch the sing-a-longs for American Splendor and In America, and Tom McCarthy winning for The Station Agent. But, anyway, I loved the whole In America skit. "I told you not to wear the same outfit as me!" Heh, heh, heh. And Djimon Hounsou won!!! Yay for Djimon.   Kelly Ripa's kids names are so all-over-the-board. Michael, Lola, and Joaquin. What the frick? Michael, Elizabeth, and John all match. What was wrong with having all normal names, all trendy names, or all pretentious names? Jeebus!

      Rented Mario Kart, so don't be surprised if I'm drowned in my obsession and don't post for the next five days.   I've decided to hold a Oscar party amongst my family in revenge for the Fake Sick's Super Bowl party, which so unceremoniously involved the Naked Boob Halftime Show. Therefore, I'm working on finding Entertainment Weekly's printable Oscar ballot things as I've purloined the one my mother printed out to make copies from. Mutti and Vati have gone out to see Fifty First Dates, much to my mother's chagrin.   Me: What are you doing? Mom: Looking for an alternative to 50 First Dates. Me: Oh, how about 21 Grams? Mom: Imagine your father in that. He'd probably leave early, like in 12 Monkeys. He wouldn't get it. Me: Like British humor.  Mom: Exactly. (Long pause, more mindess mother-daughter chatter.) Maybe Welcome to Mooseport? Maybe over my dead, bitter body. Along Came Polly? Hm. No.  Me: You're not allowed to see Miracle without me. You already saw The Station Agent without me. Mom: He didn't like that. Me: Oh, why not? Mom: Midgets.   I love my mom for making a single noun explain everything. Someone should write a Mother's Day card about that so I can give it to her.

      I seriously want the Sims 2. Maybe after Fake Sick and I pitch in and buy Mario Kart Double Dash (which is expensive, addictive cyber-cocaine) for our Cute Purple Game Cube.  Not only do I have a flip-flop addiction, I also apparently have a video game addiction. Please note that Mario Kart, The Sims, and Rollercoaster Tycoon are the only video games I like at all, or have some scrap of talent at. But, seriously, y'all, go to  urlLink The Sims 2   My dishwasher is making these horrible serial killer noises. Jeebus. Argh.

      OH, YAY!! The Independent Spirit Awards are on at 9:00 tonight on Bravo. And they rerun at two in the morning. So I think I'll just watch the first time around, as I will most likely be home and not watching something else. (My parents are Trading Spaces fiends.) I might miss the pre-show, but that's what wireimage.com is for.  And bravo.com is not an actual website. Argh.

      FakeSick now has decided that, since he is ill, everyone else's life must stand still for him. Actually, he thinks that whether he's sick or not, but he's even worse today.   Me: Take the dog out. I'm getting ready. FS: Fine, but you have to take her in. Because I'm sick.   Oh, shut up. Hopefully my mother will take me to see a movie tonight or this afternoon (like we'd planned before the Fake Sick ruined it all) so I can Get Out of the House. And hopefully the Independent Spirit Awards rerun after they're done because I don't think I'll be able to watch them first time around. I'm looking it up on bravo.com.   The EvilDog, we'll call her Stupid, as she answers to that anyway, is bouncing on her butt again. I think she does this when she stupidly gets stuck on the rug. Oh, jeez.

      The Fake Sick can't just ruin one day of my weekend, apparently. Oh, no. He's staying home tomorrow, too. And, knowing him, he will ruin my plans for Sunday by sitting on the couch, gagging, snorting, and watching ESPN on a day that should be devoted entirely to the Academy Awards.  In happier news, I went shopping anyway tonight and I found  Camp Nowhere , which brings fond memories of my childhood and me trying to lipstick Mariana, on DVD at Barnes and Noble. I also found a book on Love, Actually, which I didn't buy but I flipped through all the parts involving Emma Thompson. They had an interview with her in the back, and her answer to the question of what her worst Christmas present ever was, "A half-eaten candy bar from my Aunt Mill. She wasn't well." So then I started laughing and all of Barnes and Noble was staring at me. And I bought a bag, and  Entertainment Weekly , and flip-flops, and Jolly Ranchers, and Starburst lip gloss. And all of it was cheap, which was, of course, the best part.   I have a serious shoe addiction I need to cure. Especially red shoes. I yammered on all night about how "Oh, that shoe is fabulous, too bad it doesn't come in red" and quite possibly drove my mother to tears.   I'm off to watch  Camp Nowhere . Good times, good times.

      Hm. Update on the Fake Sick. He thinks that coughing at random intervals and snorting snot up his nasal canal is going to fool me. Argh. So, thank you, dear younger brother, for usurping my cough-and-cold, destroyificating my weekend, and being an all around annhole. (Annhole is the term for people who are like Ann Coulter. Not that Fake Sick is that fracking crazy yet.)   Fametracker has its' Rasco P. Soultrain awards up:  urlLink Rasco P. Soultrain Awards   Patricia Clarkson is the winner of the William H. Macy H!ITG Memorial Graduation Award. (For those of you not in the loop, a H!ITG is a "Hey, it's that guy!") It sort of reads like someone as equally Patricia Clarkson-worshipping as me wrote it, so y'alls gotsta go read that too. Even if she does not win The Oscar Which She So Deserves, she won that, and Fametracker is what really counts. Not the Oscars, whose members happen to contain Carmine Caridi (someone I hadn't heard of before he became an Official Bad Movie Pirate) and who will probably bestow Best Actress on the woman from  Mighty Joe Young . Argh.   Argh is my word of the day, I think. It's better than my alternatives, which I gave up because THE Jesus died on THE cross for THE people. (/End of Unnecessary Mel Gibson Mocking.)

      I'm writing this during computer class, since I already finished what I needed to do and whatnot.   Oh, jeebus.   I'm sort of depressed. I just wish that I had parents who could pick up on Fake Sick (my brother) and Real Sick (me.) Know who got the last cough pill this morning? Fake Sick. Know who got to stay home from school? Fake Sick. Know who successfully ruined the nice, quiet weekend of awards shows I had planned? Fake Sick.   Arrrrgh.

       urlLink Fametracker.com's Inside the Oscar Star Chamber 2004  is officially my favorite part of the Oscar season. That is some funny stuff, y'all, so if you're wondering why I'll go around making bizarre, lewd comments about all the Oscar nominees for a few days, it's probably spawned from this. And, I loved this bit: "Cold Mountain was hardly nominated for anything." "What, did Harvey [Weinstein]'s check bounce?" Heh, heh, heh.

So don't think I've gone soft when I call people "fracking beaches" an awful lot.   And now for something entirely different...

      Anyway. Am copying a CD as I type this lovely, witty entry because I discovered that just because the computer says you can't run other programs while burning a CD, that doesn't mean you can't. It just means the computer is stupid. Except the burning just takes a lot longer. But this may be related to the fact that I'm burning an incredibly long Wilco CD. The first and the last song are both roughly seven minutes long on this disc, apparently. I am in love with Wilco. And you heard it here first.   "Snowflakes are like angels. They fall on your head." --Mariana, in a highly boring art class most of our class utilized as screwing-off time. Except we were not the morons who demoralized the classroom door with pictures of the elderly from old National Geographics or made bling-bling that said "Jesus" and "$" with Mardi Gras beads and sticky gold paper. We aren't that stupid, yet, just slightly demented, honestly.   Speaking of Mariana, she is being a Nice Friend and getting me  Pieces of April  on DVD as a Late Birthday Present. And since Evangeline bought me  Home for the Holidays  and my mom got me  Sense and Sensibility  and Betty gave me  Raising Arizona , my DVD collection is in the works of being a shrine to My Idols and Dysfunctional Families Everywhere. When I have the monopoly on writing independent films about disgustingly dysfunctional families, no one will ever wonder why.   Why is it that two minutes ago the burner said burning would take two more minutes and now it says it will take thirteen more minutes? Argh.

      More thoughts:   -I had a very interesting birthday party yesterday. Oh, yes. And watching  Home for the Holidays  right after made it obscenely better. My aunt Mary is totally Joanne Larson (alias Cynthia Stevenson, who may have a monopoly on every good bitchy mom role in Hollywood.)  -I told you they looked good. Oh, yes they did. I think my blog should be the Official Awards Season Blog of   urlLink Holly Hunter   and   urlLink Patricia Clarkson   .   -I want to be on the fictional cooking show of Princess Di and her Beloved Aunt. Oh my gods does that sound like fun.

      It's a double angry-letter day, oh yes it is.    A Letter to the SAG   Dear Screen Actors Guild,       I expected better of you. I was actually optimistic about your nominees. I mean, Station Agent for best ensemble, a total of three nominations for Patricia Clarkson! Obviously, going with the Best Choice on Your Ballots was a bit too hard for you people. I'll admit that I'm not too upset about Meryl Streep winning over Emma Thompson (I mean, it's the Screen Actors Guild, and Meryl Streep is God For Actors), and I'm happy Johnny Depp won, but other than that? Squinty! Tim Robbins! Charlize Theron! Let's be like every other awards show. But my Favorite Nominees, at least the ones who showed up, all looked Very Nice. So that gives us something to applaud them for, as we obviously cannot applaud for them as the winners.   Love, Catherine.    A Letter to the People who Don't Use Punctuation in their Away Messages   Dear Punctuationless Bastards,      We can't tell what you're saying, because all your sentences run together when you use no periods. Stupid moron asses.   Love, Catherine.

      Hm. Random Thoughts from me for the Night of Saturday, February 21, 2004.   -Nobody is online. I wish someone would get online. Princess Di? Mariana/Marinara?   -I'm reading a book with a protagonist named Pagan. Now who, for the love of God, would name their daughter Pagan? This isn't even some weird sci-fi book where characters can get away with having strange names, either. The author should just have named her Sarah or Jessica and gotten along with it. Pagan is not even a good name for a fictional character. I mean, really, even if someone doesn't honor God or whatever, it's not nice to name them Pagan. I think I will invent characters named Pagan and Heath-short-for-Heathen. Heh.   -I think Laurie on  Trading Spaces  is having some lipliner issues tonight. Did anyone else notice this? And Hildi's flower bathroom made me tear up a bit. The last time I cried over something on TV was when  Sophie's Choice  was on, and before that it was Sally's impression of Crush-the-Finding-Nemo-turtle on Mike's Super Short Show (not deserving of bold, sorry) on the Disney Channel. Bad things make me cry.   -You would be amazed at the fabulousal CD collection at our local library. I think I may have gone a bit overboard in checking out: the  Chicago  soundtrack, the  School of Rock  soundtrack, a Nick Drake retrospective, Radiohead's Kid A, When the Pawn... by Fiona Apple, a Cranberries CD, Wilco's Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, and the  Josie and the Pussycats  soundtrack (laugh if you want to. But I can't hate a movie with Parker Posey. And Fametrackers reccomended the CD.) And I also checked out a bunch of books, too. But no magazines, since their  Entertainment Weeklys  are suspiciously missing. I haven't told my mother about this yet. I think she might become clinically depressed again when I tell her.

      Going to the library today. My mom works downtown by the Best Library Ever, so she's dropping me off before she works and picking me up when she leaves. She seems to think I will get bored spending at least two hours at the library. Me. Bored, at a library. A library with books and CDs and magazines and videos. And tables. And quiet time, something I vastly need before our entire extended family tyrranizes (sorry, Angie) our house tomorrow afternoon, and also before I have to clean the toilets. For someone who can't shut up, I really enjoy my quiet time, away from my mother, brother, father, etc. I can just sit there and read or whatever, and not be interrupted to let the dog out and whatnot.   Sigh. I love quiet today. Tomorrow, I will also love quiet. Until the SAG Awards broadcast, at least.

       Quotes from my Life   Me: Bitch stole my name, yo. [Later:] I cannot believe I said "bitch stole my name, yo." (Long pause.) That was actually quite funny.  Princess Di: I'm enfulged in the internet games. It's like being eaten alive!  Franny: I mean, I say stupid things but even I know not to say things like that! (About a certain classmate saying that no states joined the Confederacy after South Carolina because, "South Carolina is still part of our country today!")    In other news...   Hallie Todd seriously needs to work more. She's fabulously sarcastic and I like her. I will watch Lizzie McGuire for her if I have nothing better to do, because she manages to look like she's having no fun at all being sarcastic and having cute hair and, well, she probably isn't. But she makes it look like it would be fun to be in her sarcastic, cute-haired presence. There you have it. My not-so-secret secret confession.    And, in awards-show news...  THE SCREEN ACTORS GUILD AWARDS ARE IN TWO DAYS. I heart the SAG Awards, largely because they just give out award after award and don't bother stopping and actors also heart Patricia Clarkson and Holly Hunter and Emma Thompson and Bill Murray and Johnny Depp and might possibly not so much heart Renee Zellweger. Or at least I hope so. Gods.

      I've had a really bad day. I don't know. I had to deal with little kids and was forced to listen to "Milkshake" seven hundred times (or at least it feels like that much.) I'm still rewriting my goddamn first scene and my stomach hurts and I fell flat on my ass in front of the entire preschool class. And they laughed at me. And I think I'm majorly fucking up my math grade again. I think I should be able to pay the school not to take math, as I will go out of my way to find a career that involves nothing more than basic algebra, and no geometry. And I have stupid, demented student-led conferences in a week or something like that and I really shouldn't blog while I'm upset but I do anyway.   Hm. Hm. Think happy thoughts. Puppies, ice cream, fat people falling down.  If I ever get a fish his name will be Prince Chandler Kitty-The-Second Eugene. Betty's mom had a fish named Kitty (yes, as in cat) who died last week, so I feel I must honor Kitty.   Also? Once girls hit puberty and middle school, they become bitchy and thin and somehow unceremoniously feel the right to call normal-sized, sweet girls "fat." If you're reading this, you know who you are and you know you have no right to be doing that. And I don't think you realize how much you piss people off because of your ugly, stupid shallowness. I never would have pegged some of you as bitches. But you are. And you heard it from me first, because, quite frankly, I'm not afraid to say it to any of you stick-figures that would be knocked over by a slight breeze and never be able to pick yourselves up again.   Maybe that's why I'm so pissed. Other than my tanking algebra grade. I think our middle school is infested with morons. Hopefully these bitches will get smarter when they hit seventh and eighth grade. Jesus.

       Catherine's Oscar Fashion Predictions   Not that I'm very good at this sort of thing. But, you know, I'll try.    Patricia Clarkson  will wear red shoes. I bet you any money she does. And  Holly Hunter , my other favorite nominee will be wearing Vera Wang. Those two weren't hard, just observant. And... um...  Renee Zellweger  will look ugly and squinty.  Keisha Castle-Hughes  will be much better dressed than  Charlize Theron , who will wear something predictable and boring that everyone will rave over for no good reason at all. Also predictably dressed will be  Nicole Kidman  if she bothers to show up.  Diane Keaton  will wear gloves.  And all the men will wear predictable, boring tuxedos. Except for  Sting  who will wear his typical uniform of hey-look-at-me-I-am-a-tantric-sex-rock-god. And  Johnny Depp  is bound to wear something weird, as much as I love him.   And you know what I realized, while talking to Evangeline? I really am Miss Kenton from  Remains of the Day . I never shut up ever and people yell at me about it, I'm quite energetic, and my huffy walk is the perfect Miss Kenton walk. I think they should remake that movie when I'm of age, just so I can be the Snarky British Housekeeper Known as Miss Kenton. Except maybe they could give her a first name.

      Hmm. Allrighty. According to Blogger, I officially have a large blog. This should not make me as happy as it does. But it does.   I can't really think of anything to say. Went on a field trip to see a mediocre preduction of West Side Story today. Maria sang like a goat and we had the most obnoxious audience ever, I swear. I think they all had worms eating away at their brains or something, because the kids next to us had to say, "Jose!" forty bazillion times, and then the boys behind us kept singing "I Feel Pretty" through the whole production. Come on. This is not a sing-along Disney video. Jesus.   In case you can't tell, I'm the Theater Etiquette Nazi. I refuse to see Saturday matinees of kids' movies because I continually have to turn around and say "please stop talking, we're trying to watch the movie" (when I really mean: "Stop talking! I did not pay eight and a half dollars to listen to you talk, you assbastards!") or "please stop kicking my seat" to little kids. And, you know what? I don't really care if I'm mean to the little brats. Their parents should tell them not to talk or not to kick seats. My mom always did. And it's not just the kiddies. Oh, no. Adults, especially the elderly, are even worse. Adults are just rude and the elderly tend to state the painfully obvious in highly loud tones, because, you know, their hearing aid battery is draining hazardous chemicals into their brains or something. They like to say "Bye-bye [insert name of dead character here]!" a lot, also.   And that is the story of why you never want to be stuck in a theater with me. And there's a slight chance we might have another snow day tomorrow, and, since I go to a catholic school, I'll never have to make it up! Bwahahaha.   Oh, gods. Hallie is IMing "I Feel Pretty" to me. Oy with the prettiness already.

      My friends and I? We have an innate need to make everything more complicated than it really, truly is. And you know who we can blame for all this? The theoretical beings of Adam and Eve. And we can blame God for Theoretical Adam and Eve, so, therefore, everything is God's fault. Take that, God. You bastard.  Yes, in fact, I am feeling bitter. However could you tell?

      As some of you may have noticed, I changed my template. I realized, in looking at other blogs, that everyone and their brother has my old template.   Dear Harvey Whinestein,  Cold Mountain  was not nominated because it was three hours of suckiness. And it had ugly hats. Note that this worked for  Howard's End , but not for your movie. Hmm.  Love, Catherine.   And, yes, I forgot my Oscar-themed entry yesterday and I'm quite ashamed. So you'll be getting two today. (Oh, shut up. You only have eleven more to live through, then my recap. You'll live.)   Those last three sentences? Were so mom-like of me I'm prepared to make my kids vomit Chicken McNuggets.

       Why O.J. Simpson Is Wholly Responsible for my Unnatural Aversion to Chicken McNuggets   The day of the OJ Simpson trial, my mother was quite entranced with the TV broadcast of it, and I, not having the same criminal justice fixation, was not. I really just wanted to have a Happy Meal and pitched a fit until my mother agreed to go to McDonald's. She doesn't particularly like doing things for me, like feeding me, that make her a Nice Mom when she could be watching a murder trial, though, so the moment I got my nice little Happy Meal she barked: "Eat fast." So I did, and I vomitted all over the shiny surface of our plastic table booth and I've never stuck a Chicken McNugget in my mouth since. So, Mr. Simpson, don't you feel guilty for robbing me of my simple pleasure of Chicken McNuggets? Do ya? Huh?   Sometimes, I worry myself.

      Just discovered that I missed Holly Hunter on Leno a few weeks ago, which also means I missed Holly Hunter throwing a baseball crappily and that sort of just ruined my day.   Hm. What else. No school today. Princess Di, you are not online, and that makes me quite sad.   Ooh. Fametracker has Sean Penn's fame audit up. Reading, reading, reading. I have to admit, as much as I'm annoyed by him, Sean Penn is a fantabulous actor. But I still want Bill Murray to win Best Actor, dammit! Someone on the IMDB message boards was wondering why I was on the Go Keisha Castle-Hughes Bandwagon.  Worked a little on  Love is Nothing . Damn, that is a good title. I'm rather proud of that title. And I used the line, "Put that in your psychology book and smoke it!" which I'm sure is destined to become a classic quote in the same vein as "Gimme back that baby, you warthog from hell!"

       Catherine's Future Oscar Gowns   Okay. I saw this dress today, thanks to a Fametracker, and I decided it would have been my Future Oscar Gown had it not: a) been worn already by someone else or b) been strapless, as I have nothing to keep that up.  urlLink    So now I am looking for Future Oscar Gowns for when I have to go up and give my Witty Acceptance Speech. And not having much luck. And I have no idea how to title my links, so now they look rather ugly. I hate ugly URLs. So here is my list: 1. The Aforementioned Purloined Gown. 2. I hate to be stereotypical, but just about anything in Vera Wang's spring collection, which you can view on  urlLink  . Those are pretty fracking dresses. I especially like the green one at the end of the spring collection. I wish I looked good in green, as opposed to looking like I have leukemia. Perhaps I could special-order it in black.  3. Okay. Am scouring Alexander McQueen for something I could actually pull off. Not succeeding. Wow. Most of this is quite eccentric and a bit foofy for someone who is only 5'1". So now I'm looking at Armani and Fametrackering. Nothing is striking me as awards showsy, and I'm tired. So when I go up to accept my award, looking like Sofia Coppola dressed in some random black dress (except I will be so very unceremoniously wearing red shoes) that looks terrible on me, you will know why: I have Clothing ADD. And Restless Leg Disease.

      Hm. More on screewriting.   Dear Whoever wrote  Screenwriting For Dummies : You spelled both of Shannen Doherty's names wrong. And I don't like hearing that I have construction workers playing basketball in my brain, thankyouverymuch. But at least you leased me some room for artistry, unlike Skip of  The Complete Idiot's Guide to Screenwriting , who wants me to write my ideas in a completely mainstream, crappy manner for no good reason at all. And if I ever attend a screenwriting seminar of my own accord, please just shoot me.   Anyway. I have 16 emails. Oh, gods gods gods.

      I'm no longer at Angie's. I'm at my rather boring house now.   Saw  Adaptation  last night, and  Mostly Martha . Meryl Streep was terribly good in the former, and hilarious, and now I will go around calling people "fat fucks" forever and ever amen. But the end? I was quite lost and laughing shamefully hard.  Mostly Martha  was also very good. Angie and I felt so smart because we were drinking chamomile tea and watching this artsy, English-subtitled film.   In other news, I am predicting Patricia Clarkson to win the best supporting actress Oscar. Why, you may ask? Okay. Renee Zellweger and Shoreh Andgslfjdlkjfladfadroo (I don't know how to spell it) will split the vote. Holly Hunter isn't going to win because   thirteen 's producers weren't smart and released it in August. Marcia Gay Harden already won and her nose is squishy, not that this has anything to do with anything. If this happens, I will throw the Oscar voters a party. Also, I'm jumping on the Bill Murray-not-Sean Penn for Best Actor bandwagon. Because Bill Murray was in  Ghostbusters  and Sean Penn was not. Best Actress? Go  Whale Rider  girl!! Beat the fake-uglies. Although I can't say I'd be terribly upset if Samantha Morton won either. Best Supporting Actor should go to... erm... let's say Djimon Hounsou because he's the only one I can remember at the moment who is not Tim Robbins. And I desperately want Best Original Screenplay to go to  Finding Nemo .   And that is the end of my rant on the suction of the Oscars. None of those people are going to win. Well, perhaps in my head they will.

      Alllrighty then. I'm at Angie's house updating my blog. And I have no idea what to say.   Oh, wait: When is someone going to make a screenwriting book for people that want to write a screenplay they like, not a screenplay some stupid producer will? They do not understand that some people write screenplays without the idea of selling them in mind. In fact, I hadn't thought about selling mine at all until Princess Di brought it up. Although I suppose, if they were to get the right people (no matter how unrealistic) I wouldn't mind selling it. But I'd still be sad. Grrr.  That is all, all, all.

      WHAT BAND/SONG:    Reminds you of an ex-lover : I've never had an ex-lover. Let's pretend that... erm... oh there is no point in answering this.   Favorite song of all time : hmm... there's so many. It changes every hour.   Makes you laugh : "I am Cow."    You never want to hear again : Anything by Hilary Duff, alias Daddyfucker.   You'd like to wake up to : hmmm.... I'd have to say that PJ Harvey's entire album "Dry" would be excellent to wake up to.   You'd like to fall asleep to : Dido's "Life for Rent" album, or "As You Turn to Go" by the Magnetic Fields.   Reminds you of the person you're into now : Hmm. As I don't know the person I'm into now personally, I don't feel I can answer this properly.   A ridiculous song : Ridiculously bad? "Milkshake" by Kelis.   Makes you think of being alone : "Maggie May" by Suzanne Vega and Texas' "I'll See it Through." Oh, god, and "Hallelujah" by Jeff Buckley. I listen to a lot of lonely music.   Perks you up : There's a lot of them. Lately it's been "Sleepy California" by Her Space Holiday.   Makes you wanna go nuts : "Milkshake," especially when Les Poulets (the prostitutes) sing it.   Reminds you of a mean person : "Milkshake." Surprise, surprise.

      Hrm. Posting a comment on Angie's journal. Y'all can now email me at MrWilcoxIAmDemented@hellokitty.com (now my internet life matches. I have never been so proud. Except I'm a bit too lazy to change my journal name. Oh, you know.)   Mariana-- I almost typed Marinara there--- and I took it upon ourselves to steal Betty's fatuous frog bouncy ball and stick it in one of our volcano projects for science. It was rather funny until she found it and chucked it very hard at my thigh from about three inches away. So we tried to, very seriously, be mad at her but we kept giggling so that all went to pot, pardon the old-lady expression.  Had shitloads of homework. Felt the need to type entirely in fragments. Mutti and I had a conversation about Pieces of April: Mutti: Well, you haven't seen it, how do you know you're going to like it? Me: Because I read the script book at Barnes and Noble. Mutti: So? Me: So, it was a good script.  Mutti: Who made you the Script Judge? Me: You were the one who asked.  She is very strange. And she's seriously watching TV at the moment, Princess Di. Hee.

      Princess Di is seriously the best person ever online. She rocks my face, and everyone else's, off.   Di on the fact that she's supposed to be reading the Bible: Di: I've only read twenty verses. Me: Oh my gods. Are you dyslexic or something?  Di: I seriously think I am. Well, I read words backwards sometimes. And numbers, too. Oh! 23 verses! Me: Or is that 32?   Di on my cynicism: Di: You're very cynical today. Me: I am every day. Di: Well, it's especially obvious tonight.   Oh. In case y'all didn't hear, I actually came in first on a Mario Kart race. I know, I know. Mariana and Di have probably hyperventilated while reading this. But Snaggletooth Betty was right there, making Chicken 1-2-3 and fingering the raw meat. She likes raw meat. Heh, heh, heh.    Enjoy me before Betty kills me, okay?

      Have you ever noticed that a stupid person can say something... well, not intelligent, but not quite as insipid as the other things they say, and it still sounds stupid? Even a simple question, such as, "Are we doing writing or grammar in language arts today?" can sound entirely fatuous coming from these people, because they just talk stupidly. Of course, when this conversation goes on you must assume they're the most brain-dead being ever to walk this planet: Other Person: How are you getting to college? Stupid Person: In a car.

I can just picture Beloved Aunt's hair on fire, although I have no idea what she looks like. Anyway.   Now Di believes she has a scar from being stabbed with a fork as a small child. Then again, I have lots of mysterious scars too, and I like to think they're from... I dunno. Something traumatizing.

      Hrm. Won't be blogging as much today due to the fact that I'm going with my cousin Angie to a boat launching, which is supposed to be Very Cool. (My brother went to one in the summer and my uncle got it on tape and it made a very big splash-- I like big splashes-- and apparently it's even cooler when they launch them in the winter.)   Also, I believe we'll be eating lunch at McDonald's. I know it's bad for you and all, but my plan is to eat as many greasy French fries as I can before my metabolism slows down when I'm old. (No, I really don't like the idea of my metabolism slowing down and having to eat things that aren't entirely carbohydrates. Oh, god, I suppose I still will, I'll just go for a run afterward or something.)  Oh, gods. That last sentence? Made me really depressed. And now I may have to second-guess my extra fries.  Hrm. No. Sorry about that. I lied. Still eating greasy fries.   I thought Lauren Holly was Kathie Lee Gifford when the previews for Just Desserts came on the TV Guide Channel (aka the Lesley Ann Machado Channel) for no reason at all yesterday. That was frightening.   Also: I'm beginning to think my mother is truly deranged. I called my dog a butthead (I know, I'm so mature) today, and she said, "don't call your mother a butthead!" and acted all offended using, "well, unh-unh-unh" noises. Oh, gods.   I'm off to watch my tape of Patricia Clarkson's interview on The View.  Yes, that depresses me also, "The View" part.  Cath.

Sometimes I make myself laugh. Now is one of those times.

      My friend Princess Di is so funny. Awful is Di's word of the day, I believe. She's watching Dr. Phil at the moment and being obscenely amused over it. If I were the Television Without Pity people, I would pay Di to do Dr. Phil recaps. "Oh my god! The granny just told the granddaughter that she was fat and that her husband would leave her if she got any fatter! It's awful! I so love the drama." Hee.   [Oh, gods, now PsychoGranny is talking about never speaking to FatGranddaughter ever again. Hee. Please note that this is Di talking, so if something entirely different happened on your episode of Dr. Phil, don't yell at me.]  Evangeline said "All hail the CuteBlog!" in her email to me this morning. Y'all gotta listen to Angie. (Aw. My friends rock my face off.)  Our elderly neighbors across the street are chasing their granddaughter around. It looks like some form of torture. Poor kid. The grandfather looks like John Candy, I think, and my dad is always talking about him dying of heart disease, largely because he has a snowblower and my father doesn't.   That's a really sad note to end an entry on, so I'm adding this sentence.

      I've succumbed. I've watched The View. I even taped the portions involving Patricia Clarkson. She is just that cool. And she and I are on the same page about hockey being sexy.   I was on the phone with Hallie at the time, discussing how sexy hockey is. God almighty, it's some sort of unwritten law that hockey players are hot.   Snow days are just the best. I've been working on my screenplay and watching TV all morning. Speaking of my screenplay, I'm no longer mad at it and I've stopped calling it the Damn Screenplay. Now I'll refer to it as "the screenplay" or "Love is Nothing" (my fantabulous title for it; I'm not very good at titling so I'm quite proud of that.) But of course I'm at the point where everything starts going downhill to Depressingville, like the eleven-page-estimated opus I refer to as The Dinner Scene. You know what's really even more depressing? I like writing the depressing parts. I just make it so that everyone is dead before it takes place and, therefore, I don't need to kill anyone off.   I should eat.  Bye, Catherine.

Is it sad that I am willing to see  Miracle   because hockey is sexy and Patricia Clarkson is the shit?  And is it even sadder that I will be tuning into  The View   at 10:00 when she comes on?   Please don't answer that.

      Ello luvvies!  This is my first post on my shiny new blog (tm pamie.) Thanks to y'all who are reading this, either because I forced you to under pain of death because you're a nice friend or because you read my journal and I sent you here. Don't worry. I'm still keeping up with the journal. I was just frustrated by temporary formatting issues and decided to go with a blog for when my diary-x journal upsets me.   My father and I are doing Donald Trump impressions at the moment. Oh, the joys of family bonding.   Anyone else watch Oliver Beene last night? Charlotte cracks me up. "I just got called an adulterous whore!" I know it's not a good show, but who says I have to watch good TV just because I'm an entertainment snob. I never said I was a sitcom snob, did I?  And that concludes my very long first blog post.

      Wow. I'm sure you missed my Cate-at-Newspaper entry last Wednesday, so here is one that will hopefully be quite long to make up for it.   I am very upset with these arseheads who pieced together this issue of the newspaper. My article inexplicably stops mid-sentence and I am none too thrilled about this fact. I suppose our readers will just have to take this as a "To Be Continued," not that we're getting another issue out before I graduate. The supervisor is not taking my complaints very seriously. Jeebus.   Now we are discussing fudging letters to the advice column, because our ones so far have been things like "my parents are getting Divorced what do i do!" written by a boy in our class whose parents will never get divorced because they are probably bonded by sheer insanity. Betty has started to refer to said boy's parents on a first-name basis, which was hysterical.   Annie, Betty's sister, is walking around in her mother's teal bathroom, which has been the highlight of my day thus far. Happy birthday, Annie!  Anyway. I hope that was interesting enough to feed your insatiable urge for Cate-in-Newspaper entries that I could not feed last week.

       Amusing Referrals, Courtesy of Site Meter   -a Yahoo search for: Patricia Clarkson naked. I bet that person was very disappointed. Sorry about that. Yahoo came up with my entries about her mysterious seat disappearance and the Naked Boob Halftime Show, by the way. I'm amused, and, speaking of the much-revered Ms. Clarkson, here is a  urlLink Hilarious Interview  with her. She swears a lot and she likes writers. I have determined that she is my long-lost mother. It would account for my closet addiction to the scrolling things at the bottom of the CNN screen.  -Someone was referred from blogrolling.com; I suppose they were enamored of the highly witty title. I hope it sucked you in, witty title lover! Now this person will disappear just as quickly as the Yale person. Alas, the title rings true. I am demented.  -Lots of Fametracker referrals. Fametracker loves me, yo. Except sometimes I do not love Fametracker because it doesn't like to load on my stupid computer. Like right now.   I had coffee this morning, can you tell? I refrained from barking at Betty, though, amazingly enough. When I say barking, I really do mean barking like a dog. I kid you not. If you need proof, Betty can comment. She doesn't lie. Most of the time.

      I am a crossword puzzle addict. I don't try to be, it just happens. I am Anne Bancroft in  Home for the Holidays  without the wigs, that is how addicted I am. My mother bought me this book of movie crosswords, and I'm so bad at them, and, yet, it's an addiction. It's like crack, except I'm sure it is very difficult to be bad at doing drugs.   Anyway, I have two of my free iTunes songs left to buy. Does anyone have any recommendations? I suppose, in saying that, I should tell you what I like... Suzanne Vega, Cake, Wilco, P.J. Harvey, Garbage, the Shins, pre-sellout Liz Phair, Badly Drawn Boy, Elliott Smith, Stephin Merritt, Queen, Texas, Her Space Holiday, Jeff Buckley, Gemma Hayes, the Decemberists, Jane's Addiction, Air, the Cranberries, the Flaming Lips, the Pixies, Phantom Planet, Nick Drake, Aimee Mann, Weezer, Mazzy Star, Sam Phillips (the woman, the one who is still alive) Imperial Teen  and, as Franny B. so aptly deems it, "Music That Is Not Played on the Radio." I hope that list was sufficient enough that all these people who read this can COMMENT and RECOMMEND (hint, hint). It was just off the top of my head, there's much more.   When I am rich and famous, I am buying my stupid school twenty-five matching copies of  Johnny Tremain . I have not even read that book (and can't imagine liking it) and I don't like my school, but we have seven different styles of copies of that frickin' book. It irks me to no extent.

      Walking up the stairs from lunch (why does everything mortifying happen to me after lunch but before afternoon classes begin?), I was beaned in the head with a football that was intended for the hands of Larry-the-Allah-Worshipper, thrown by Pat (another alias for the good of society.) So, of course, I made good on my lenten promise and didn't frighten too many small children my screaming, "YOU BUTTFACE!" Then Pat was frightened and he told Urs-jalon, the crazy multi-subject teacher, that I was "attacking people with my big words." I am not sure on which planet "buttface" is considered a "big word."   And, apparently, I am very necessary as a second-rate hooker in this moronic play. Then I realized that my middle school career has been fueled entirely by absolute crap.

       Oliver Beene  did get canceled. I am going to find an address where I can write to Wendy Makkena and tell her that I will miss her delightfully sarcastic self and that she is the best nun in the history of cinema and television, even better than Sally Field, and she didn't even have to fly to get that title, just lip-synch! (Sorry if you are reading this, Miss Makkena. I don't actually try to be this demented. It just sort of happens.)   Note: Mariana now will be referred to as B.B. For reasons only the Select Few may know.    The Story Of Hot Boy   And since my first paragraph just didn't give you enough of an idea of how deranged I truly am, here is a story that will prove that accusation beyond a reasonable doubt. In our cafeteria, we are forced to line up by the Blessed Are the Pacemakers mural. And on the mural, there is a very homely boy riding an elephant. So, of course, I immediately start pointing and singing "Hot Boy!" over and over again and shaking my butt, as it is, of course, natural human instinct to do. Then I announced, loudly, that his feet were the hottest part and did some more rump-rattling and pointing and singing. And, of course, as it would naturally happen, my homeroom/social studies/art teacher (oh, shut up. We go to a Catholic school, what do you think happens without government funding?) walks by. It was truly mortifying, much more so than the time I ran down the halls singing, "PAAAAAARAAAAAAAA-MEEEEEEEEEE-CEEEEEEEEEEEEE-UMMMMMMMMMM" in this ridiculous baritone voice whilst the same teacher walked past.  I worry myself.

       "Holly Hunter has joined Robin Williams in the cast of The Big White, playing the slightly insane wife of an Alaskan travel agent." Any movie in which Holly Hunter is slightly insane is a good movie, even if it does involve Robin Williams.     I think  Oliver Beene  went on hiatus. Or was canceled. Or something. Thus, I am depressed. What will happen to me without my weekly doses of Wendy Makkena being her delightful sarcastic self?    That is about it. I think. As far as I know. More later.

      Cate during newspaper drinking Sprite, amazing, I know. Mariana has joined newspaper and will be stunned at the painstaking dullness, I assure you. Yum. Sprite.   We have three articles for our next newspaper. Oh, gods. This is friggin' stupid. Jeebus. Mariana is amazed at the nonexistent rate at which we produce issues, along with being bored.   We learned about Tourette's and schizophrenia in health class today. It was fascinating, yo.

      Oh, jeebus. Whitney Houston is in rehab. I may be in shock. Not really. I'm just worried that my mocking of this will lead to more related Google searches for rehab. (Now they are for new skates, my favorite one so far has been for Sean Connery. Because I just blog about him all the time, you know.)   Hm. Does anyone else remember the movie  Nell ? With Jodie Foster having perfect teeth despite being raised out in the woods where there is not likely a toothbrush or orthodontics. And she said all those bizarre, half-English things like, "MA TAY INNA WEEEEN." By which she meant, I believe, I am a tree in the wind. Someone should make a translator that turns normal English speak into that language. I mean, who came up with that language? Honestly.

      Had a very misguided attempt to make it so that Garbage's "When I Grow Up" plays over and over again when you visit the blog, but it didn't work out.   My social studies/homeroom/art teacher is possibly a lunatic. No, not possibly, absolutely. She informed me that watertowers are composed mainly of straight lines, then when I brought her one with straight lines, she told me they were supposed to be curved. Then, of course, Adam, alias The Hobo from Junction City (trademarked by Franny B., because she'll kill me if I don't cite her), was making hilarious faces behind her back so I started laughing and it was all just generally mortifying.   Denise Richards and Charlie Sheen had their baby and named it Sam. And it's a girl. I hope this is short for Samantha and they're just calling her Sam. I mean, it's not Audio Science or Reignbeau or anything, but... honestly. If you use the nickname enough, it's pretty much considered their full name, so just give the kid a full name. Really. Unless you have relatives like mine who deem your nickname far too short and insist on calling you by your first and middle name (and mispronouncing either), a full name will get you through life just fine.   Unless your full name is Reignbeau.

      Finally finished the opus that is Cate's Angry Letter to Mr. Jack Valenti. It's not so angry, really. Well, actually, it is, but in a very civilized manner. I know, I know, a relative impossibility there, but I was actually somewhat polite and I never insulted Jack Valenti the way I usually do. I was quite contained, except for the bits where I subtly dissed big-budget films.   Sorry about that. Had to underline my thesis statement, and I did with what is quite possibly the most crooked line ever drawn. Oh, jeebus.

      I need to trim my toenails desperately but for some reason all our clippers have disappeared. That was incredibly mundane of me to share, I know, but you should see my toenails. They get so long when I wear socks on a regular basis, which is not often because I'll stop wearing socks outside of school by the time it's officially spring. I hate socks. Unless, of course, they are toe socks.   I am sorry to inform you that I will be leaving Thursday afternoon to drive to Florida with the Nazi and the Fake Sick and will likely be gone until the next Sunday. And since we are cut off from all civilization down there, I will not be able to update. I know exactly how distraught you are, which is to say, not very.   I actually ended up with perfect timing for once last night and only watched th one part of  The Green Mile  that I like. Except the censorship fart-barons made the whole reason I like that part into what I think was, "pig-filler." Ooh. Diss. And I was also watching it on the telly in my room, where everyone looks yellowish and gray hair becomes green. It was bizarre.

I'll be Margaret Schlegel and she'll be Helen and you can beautifully direct us and we can both be like Meryl Streep.  Vati: So what are you doing about this, Cate? Me: I made tea.  Vati: And?

      Hm. Bored. Vati Nazi is still being bipolar. Thankfully, he is going to be gone for long periods of time tonight, so I will watch  The Green Mile , a movie I do not actually like as much as I should considering four of my favorite actors are in it-- Patricia Clarkson, Bonnie Hunt, Sam Rockwell, Michael Clarke Duncan--, and maybe flip to  Cracking Up  every once in a while.   The really sad part, my grand total of TV hours for last week: one hour, give or take a few minutes of watching the TV Guide channel. (And, no, watching movies doesn't count because that's such a monstrous number that I couldn't even get close guessing.)   My approximate grand total for tonight: three hours. For a movie I don't even like all that much. Maybe I'll just check every half-hour or so to see if Patricia Clarkson's big scene is coming up. Maybe I just want to revisit some good times, wasting three hours of my life, since this is, in fact, the movie that compelled Hallie to shout such comedic gems as "FOUR TIMES IN ONE NIGHT!!" and "Oh my gosh, I keep touching my nose, it's like I'm a cocaine addict!"   And my related Google searches just became all about rehabilitation. Again.

      Since my oh-so-unceremonious pimping on Fametracker, not much has happened, aside from people saying Nice Things about my blog.   The Nazi has become a bit manic-depressive as of late. I still cannot believe my mutti abandoned me so suddenly. (Actually, I was just under-informed. I thought she was leaving tomorrow morning. Nobody tells me anything in these here parts.)   Oh, dear. Princess Di is referring to  urlLink Popcap.com's Zuma  as "The Zumba" as it keeps distracting Betty from our scintillating chat room conversations.

       Random Things Cate Has To Say   1. Finally saw  Miracle  with Betty today. We had quite a few laughs, what with being surrounded by Mad Clappers (the individuals who clapped every time the U.S. scored), my new boyfriend Patrick O'Brian-Demsey, the utter cool talentedness of Patricia Clarkson, and the Unfortunate Fashion Decisions of the 80s. Princess Di was supposed to come along but had to go to a two-and-a-half hour church service, hence the tagboard dementia.  2. Parental abandonment, thanks to my mutti, who has left me with the crab-butt Nazi, alias my dad, and the Fake Sick for a week. And she's telling me not to be so bitter and sarcastic about it because I'm giving the Nazi a complex. Everyone in my house needs to shut up. Including myself.

      Television Without Pity's  Sopranos  recap is up. It's friggin' hilarious, so go read it, because the recapper mentions  Hackers , which I somehow get sucked into for no good reason at all whenever it is on cable, at least three times.   I refuse to see  The Prince and Me  not only because it looks horrible but also because the title is grammatically incorrect, an insult to moviegoers everywhere.

       Dead Again  is officially my favorite movie with scissors as a plot device. Well, actually, the only movie I've seen with scissors used as a plot device, but the point is, it's good.

Except now I did it again and I am a director married to Hugh Grant, living in London in an apartment with our four kids, where we will drive our silver Saturn Vue. Although I suppose I could just put in the same thing in every slot and end up being a single screenwriter living in an apartment in Manhattan's West Village where I drive absolutely nothing, as that is where I seem to be headed.

Not my real boyfriend. I wish.   So, anyway, my dad is going out to dinner with Trista-the-Bachelorette tonight. The fact that I am telling you this is probably a clue that I do not have very much to say.  Except that  Dead Again  is on TV in 48 minutes, yay!

Father, um, Harry (ha, ha, ha... those of you who know him will get the joke) said "bosom" in liturgy this morning. Except he said it "BOO-som," and of course, Mariana was sitting next to me and we were trying so hard not to lose it.  Then we had a sub in band who was a little absurd. He noted that our piece Cedar Valley March was, "kind of a march." (I also sit next to Mari in band, so note more effusive giggles.)   So I'm un-depressed, thanks to the stupidity of others.

      My brother is the biggest arse in the world. My parents (and he) like to forget that he is grounded and that I am not (because I am the Good Daughter and, therefore, I do my homework) and somehow he has been  getting to use the computer a lot lately and hitting me over the head with a pajama shirt or something equally smelly when I call our mother to ask her to tell him to get off the friggin' computer. My mom says she lets him have the computer (not for hours on end like she thinks) because he doesn't get to do much with friends. Okay, the last time I was grounded, I didn't get to do anything but watch TV and read books. No friends, no computer, no phone for all of my Christmas break. I never, ever get a friggin' break from being grounded, and it has nothing to do with how many friends I have. It's just because I can friggin' handle it. This would explain why my chore list says: Feed the dog. Empty/load the dishwasher. Make your bed. Let the dog inside and outside. Clean up the coffee table. And the Fake Sick's says: Make your bed, and he actually gets away with not making it.  Yeah, I know, there are starving kids who would be glad to have a family like mine and whatnot, but I have writer's block, and, quite frankly, this is the only life I can be living right now and I don't really care to be a starving kid and I don't want to be part of this family. I mean, yes, we look quite nice and suburban from the outside, but isn't that always the case with suburban families?   I was going to start whining about how my iPod Mini is not in stock, but you've already deemed be a complete bizotch and a spoiled little brat (although I saved up all the money myself), so I'm just going to let this entry be and hope I'm happier when I arrive home from school, alias the Pit.

      Hello all. It's Cate at Home. And you are very likely not alarmed and wish I would stop as quickly as possible. I nearly forgot to note that I am in one of my Miss Kenton moods, which would account for the chatty British housekeeperishness of this entry.  Mister Stevens, tell me, is that not the wrong Chinaman? Because I believe it is, Mr. Stevens.   I'm trying very hard to stop, to no avail. I am wondering, is Television Without Pity's Sopranos recap up? I am rather shocked to find that it is not. So I'm off to find the right Chinaman.   (Betty is going to say to herself, "but why?" right now, so I feel compelled to add: But why, indeed.)

I just wrote an unbiased article about the Academy Awards. Another thing to be alarmed about. I think I have been shot with a tranquilizer.  Betty wants me to tell you all about deaf people who do not know how to multitask, alias our fellow editors. Oh, our fellow Overacting, Hearing-Impaired Dead Bunny Obsessors at the newspaper, we love to hate them so.   Betty wants to talk. Disregard anything she says.   Betty here. Betty is in th hizouse cuz those bizaches hate my kid yo. hee that was just an inside joke of Cate's. Yes, well anyway, Overacting Dead Bunny Obsessor has a hanger up her crotch and has kept giving me evil looks all day. Cate just informed me that I am ruining her blog so therefore Betty (in the hizouse) is departing.   Sorry about that. It's just that those Pacific Palisades bizotches hate her kid, yo.

      Happy boshday, Mariana!  We had a very large discussion about  The Facts of Life  at lunch today and ended up laughing immoderately. After we finally remembered that the fat one who liked to rollerskate was Natalie, we couldn't remember Mrs. Garrett's last name. (Silent thank you to the IMDb.) It was sheer insanity, largely because I kept shouting, unhelpfully, "THE FAT ONE WHO ROLLERSKATES!! WHAT IS HER FRIGGIN' NAME??!?!?" at the top of my lungs.  I'm off to work on the screenplay.

I wrote a scene I am *gasp* proud of in les screenplay last night. Oh, it's so good. I'm so happy with it I could spit.  Betty has the hiccups. I think I might kill her.

Me: Yes, but I think now that she's single, she has normal person pinkies.   Mariana: ...you know, homonyms and analogies and homilies.  Me: Homilies? Mariana: That should be a grammatical term for something that goes on way too long. That way we can say, "Betty, stop with the homilies!" Me: Or, "Betty, we've already heard this homily four times."  Oh, no, my day just went entirely to pot. Spalding Gray is dead! I am so sad for Mr. Gray and his sad wife, Kathleen Russo. And, possibly even worse, Harvey Keitel is going to father another baby. He apparently married this unborn baby's mother three weeks after meeting her. I hope they don't get divorced again, because I think Harvey Keitel's ex-wife, Lorraine Bracco, has been through enough custody battles to last forever. I don't think his wife ever really heard about this. (Although Lorraine Bracco will forever be cool in my book for flipping Mr. Keitel off in court.)

      I just spent at least two hours serving butter, washing syrup holder things, and smelling sausage of questionable fiber content. Pardon me if I sound a bit angry. Except I got to do all these things with Angie, and that made it so much better, because we had conversations like:  Angie: So, are you controlling people's butter intake? Me: I suppose. Angie: Yeah, I'm controlling their, um, fork intake. Me: Fork intake?   According to emode.com, my celebrity soulmate is... someone Indie. That's what it says. No one specific. Come on, I could say that, I didn't need a quiz. Jeebus.

      Okay, since iTunes will not let me load my mix CDs for whatever reason, I have loaded every CD of my collection into my library in approximately five hours. Twenty-six CDs in five hours. Wow.  Princess Di and I are discussing my mother's inability to have friends who are actually sane, and funny quotes on auditorium walls. Please do not be alarmed.

      Okay. iTunes is all downloaded and installed and you're all probably wishing someone would have told me how addictive it is before I finished downloading it, because it is officially an Obsession. Oh my gods is this fun. And it will be so marvelous when I get my iPod. Oh, man. I am so screwed. Eventually, all the space on my computer will be devoured by my iTunes. Probably not, judging by the immense amount of music Angie has on her iTunes, but still. My life will be devoured by iTunes. Oh, dear.

      Hello, all. It's Early-Morning Cate. I'm sure you all are frightened.   I am downloading iTunes at the moment. I want to start loading music onto it in advance for when I buy my pretty iPod. (Feel free to donate to Cate's iPod fund, by the way, she has less than eighty dollars left to earn!) It takes quite a lot of time to download.   Hm. I promise this is my last entry about Renee Zellweger being such a fart-baron (I hate myself for giving up swearing; stupid Lent): Holly Hunter did a Nice Thing and threw a luncheon for all her fellow nominees, or at least the three of them (other than herself) that showed up. I don't think it is necessary to say who didn't show.   (Cate likes parentheses this morning. And speaking in the third person, like Bob Dole.)

      Okay. The blog revamp which ended up amounting to a whole lot of nothing is officially over. I will not be updating my template again unless it is to change my reading/listening to/visiting section or to add a new link. I promise.   I don't have anything funny to say. Being a computer-illiterate fool has sucked all the life and sarcasm out of me. What has become of my life? Oh, jeebus.   If I really, really wanted to, I could say I was posting this at three in the morning, on Christmas of 1999. Thankfully for you, I am nicer than that most of the time. I don't have any energy left to be mean.

I'm working on getting the tagboard back, I promise.   Oh, dear. I'm babysitting the Fake Sick.  FS: I'm hungry for a Snickers Chruncher! Me: Well, we don't have any. So find something else to eat, bucko.  FS: BUT I WANT A SNICKERS CHRUNCHER!!! Me: If you are so hungry, eat something healthy! FS: I DON'T WANT TO EAT SOMETHING HEALTHY!!! Me: Then find some other unhealthy thing to eat.  FS: I TOLD YOU ALREADY, I AM ONLY HUNGRY FOR SNICKERS CHRUNCHERS!!!!  Allrighty then.

      Okay, I officially changed my blog template. I hope you all like it. I now have a tagboard, commenting, guess a number, a calendar, blah, blah, blah. I'm not too fond of the actual format, but I love all the extra stuff I've accumulated from this change, so you people can just get used to it while you play guess Cate's friggin' number. I'm still trying to figure out how to change that "simple.blue" thing at the top, but whatever. Guess my friggin' number while I wait to fix it, y'all.   And I accidentally lost all your comments. I'm so sad. I wanted to print out Mariana's comment from today about being related to Larry the Muslim and visiting my blog daily. Oh, dear.   The sad part is, all this took me about three hours today. And I'm still mad that I finally get to watch the Ellen DeGeneres Show for the first time since Christmas break, and Gwyneth Paltry is on. Argh.

      Okay, y'all may have noticed that I've been changing the blog a lot. (Note: the tag board posts go from most recent to least recent. Like the blog entries.) I'm trying to find a really nice, imageless, not overly bright template for it on Blogskins.com but I'm having very little luck, as Mariana knows. If anyone who reads this ever succeeds in finding a nice template that doesn't concern gaudy images of Japanese boy bands that are not all that attractive, tell me. Please. I am losing my demented little brain.   Oh, dear. These Blogskins people really need to be convinced to not use images, my gods.

       Top 5 Reasons My Blog Is Special   After reading many other blogs and enjoying approximately three of them, I've compiled a list of the reasons my blog is special, hence the title.  1. The title is not from the lyrics of some dumb "cool" rock song. Instead, it is from  Howard's End . This shouldn't worry you as much as it does. I suppose it could be from a rock song when Mariana and Betty and I get together and make our band, Dental Tart.  2. I figured out to make links and have an Unkymood in my sidebar. Everyone who knows me knows this is quite a feat, as I am a computer-illiterate fool.  3. It's orange. And cute. And witty.  4. Everyone's names are fake to protect their deranged little identities.  5. Random visits from Princess Di. No, not the real one. If you want a visit from her, turn on the Today show every morning.   Thank gods for half-days. Although we're all rather hyper on our half-days and act quite weird. Today, um, Larry was pretending to be a Muslim person and randomly getting on his knees, making his sweatshirt a turban, and shouting "ALLAH!!"   Now you understand the bit in number 4 about protecting identities.

      Okay. The promised, much-anticipated quiz results. I cheated on one so I could get  Say Anything... , but here are my actual, non-cheating results and my actual, non-cheating responses:     You are Woodstock!    urlLink   Which Peanuts Character are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    Oh, yay! I *heart* Woodstock. (I have Suzanne Vega's "Marlene on the Wall" stuck in my head right now, which is lovely and wonderful and beautiful.)    Ballet shoes- beautiful, graceful, and creative, you enjoy dancing writing and music.  You are often very poetic and sometimes dramatic.  You keep to yourself aside from a few close friends that you can relate to. [please vote! thank you! :)]    urlLink   What Kind of Shoe Are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    I wanted to be red stilletos. I think red stilletos are truly a footwear extention of my persona. And I think the only part this guy got right was "creative." I am not graceful and I highly doubt I am beautiful, but feel free to post a comment disagreeing with this.  I just took a very strange quiz where I ended up being Yoshi but there was no picture so I didn't bother posting it.     You're chocolate.  You're the old soul type, people feel that they have known you their entire life.  Many often open up to you for they view you as thoughtful and trustworthy.  Although people trust you, you have a hard time trusting them.  You prefer to keep your feelings bottled up inside, or display them very quietly.  It is alright to open up every once in a while.    urlLink   Which kind of candy are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    Okay. Whatever. I like chocolate. I promise the next two quizzes are my last.     you are the "I hate you so bad" happy bunny. You hate everyone and eveything and your not ashamed of it.     urlLink   which happy bunny are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    I didn't really care what answer I got, 'cuz I love Happy Bunny, oh, yes, I do.  Never mind. The last quiz hasn't got any pictures.

      "Adam is a hobo from Junction City." --My good friend Franny B. after sniffing Sharpies in language arts class a few days ago.  My mom made me walk two miles home from school yesterday. Yes, I am capable of walking two miles. I did it in fifteen minutes, in fact. What happened was is that my mom didn't tell me I was walking home until I was in the car, so I had very bad shoes on for walking, so now my feet are blistered all over and I have a monstrously pulled muscle. So now my feet are all Ace-bandaged, which should not me as amusing as it really is.  I am a bit worried that Dr. Melfi and Tony might get together on   The Sopranos.  I know this is an irrational worry, but Dr. M better say no. She's the hero of the side of me that wants to be a shrink. And that side of me would absolutely say no to Tony. If she says yes, that side of me could very well die. Oh, my. What will happen without my analytical shrink side, the side that has currently been working very hard to self-actualise and not get library fines and whatnot. I will be dominated entirely by my forgetful, snarky screenwriter self.   (Oh, dear. Speaking of library fines, the collection agency letter for my latest fines came. Apparently this goes on my mom's credit report because she's in charge of me, but she's happy that I took care of it so she won't tell my dad until I've gone to college and whatnot. My mom rocks my face off.)

       Random Quotes of Catherine's Life, Part Two   Franny B.: Adam is a hobo from Junction City. (Please note: Miss Franny B. had been sniffing Sharpies in grammar class when she came up with this.)   Mariana: I swear I told you that. Or maybe I just dreamt that.   Mariana's Mutti (speaking of our graduation; I'm paraphrasing): You're all gonna dress up in gunny sacks and sandals and put your hair in ponytails so you look like Jesus. Then, afterwards, we're gonna sit in someone's garage and listen to the Christian rock station.   Me: The lateness of my hour is due not therefore to the dance but to the waiting in line for a horseless carriage of unquestionable size. Princess Di: I have no idea what you're talking about. Me: And neither do I.

       Catherine's Daily Morning Visit to the IMDb   -Take the poll. Laugh at the sentence "Jim Carrey's stunningly unfunny Blake Edwards intro," because apparently Jim Carrey is considered funny in other people's words and it should be a surprise Blake Edwards, who wrote some of the only old movies I like, upstaged him.   -Read the gossip column, whatever it's called. Janet Jackson. Meh. Steven Seagal. Meh. Oh, I'm still sad that Spalding Gray is missing. Really. And his wife seems like such a nice sad person to commiserate with. Aw. Meh, Sylvester Stallone wants another baby; I don't think he deserves one after naming his daughter Sistine (although he has a daughter named Scarlett, which my mom probably would have named me had I been a redhead.) Ben Affleck, Christian Slater, Kate Winslet, Alec Baldwin, Elton John, Jessica Simpson, all MEH. If it hadn't been for Spalding Gray and his sad wife, Kathleen Russo, that all would have been completely for naught.

      Okay, one more gripe about Squinty winning, brought up by Hallie and Angie: her clip blew. (I'm pirating from Angie and I on the phone here, but:) "MY PAW SHOT THAT ALLIGATOR!" "AND THEN HE STOOD OUT IN THE RAIN AND SAID 'IT'S RAININ' BUT THEY MADE THE WEATHER AND THEY SHOT THE ALLIGATORS!" (After the whole line about they stand out the rain and say it's raining in the real clip, my crazy mutti said, "No, really? I thought they would say it's snowing.")   I am writing an email to Betty Who Is Meanly on Vacation. I know you all missed me writing in my blog during newspaper, but I had to yell at our newly-recruited problem child because no one was supervising us.   I'm paraphraising, and badly at that, but I'd like to share with y'all this conversation between two guys in my class during math, when we were in the library doing our homework: Dan: Problem 20 is hard. Matt: No, it's not! It's easy, like your mom! (Mariana and I tell Matt how horrible and stupid and disgusting he is.) Dan: Problem 22 is hard, too. Matt: No, it's not. It's easy. You just gotta work it.   Oh, jeebus. Mrs. Egghead just called. Stupid fartbaron, that woman.

      Just finished watching  Gilmore Girls  in the first time in forever. I must say, I loved DrunkEmily. So I am now reading last week's  West Wing  recap on Television Without Pity, another show I have not watched in forever. (But I hear that Princess Di has the first season on DVD, that little beenerschnieve. I'm "jellos.") Not that those two things have anything to do with each other except, you know, television.   Dear People Who Can't Solve Their Own Problems, Don't ask me what to do about it. If I wanted to answer your questions, I would ask if you had any. And don't even bother trying to ask if it's something I have no control over. Cate.   Angie, I thought you would enjoy this bit:  Me: Oh my gosh. This magazine has obituaries in the back. I hate obituaries. Do you know anyone who does like them? (Long pause.) Mom: Your grandfather.

      I'm writing in language arts class. I had to type up my persuasive essay and whatnot. It's about the screener ban and can properly be titled  An Angry Letter To Mr. Jack Valenti, The Fartbaron Killing Independent Films . But, obviously, it's not titled that. Instead it's called  Screener Ban: I Need A Better Title .   I'm sure everyone that reads my blog is amazed, after reading this, that I actually thought of a title as good as  Love is Nothing . Oh, jeebus.

      My father was very upset with my mother and I for making him watch part of the Oscars. So he made us watch the the semi-retarded CNN Pre-Show and then made fun of everyone and mixed up their names. So, anyway, this is Catherine's Family and Their Stupid Oscar Dialogue.  Me: Oh, ew. Tim Robbins just blew his nose. Thanks, CNN. Dad: Well, Cate, what do you think happens when he snorts cocaine all afternoon?   [This is a good time to mention that my dad assumes everyone at awards shows is some kind of pothead/cokehead.]  Mom: Oh, my gosh. Uma Thurman got attacked by lederhosen. Or Maria from  The Sound of Music .   And so on and so forth. But then my mom/mutti/madre and I vetoed all talking for the rest of the night, except when the stupid guy on the ABC pre-show said "competish" and she shouted, "GO READ A DICTIONARY, YOU FOOL!" I did not bother to remind her that she said roughly the same thing to me when I was in third grade because I interrupted her soaps-- by which I mean Court TV, wanting to go to the library.   But even with the snark, the Oscars were still fracking boring.

      Well, those were the most boring, predictable Oscars ever. Jeebus! Lord of the Rings everything, Charlize Theron, Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, Squinty... blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. I think all this dullness is quite possibly a result of the Oscars being pushed forward a month. There is no space for an upset, people just vote for the obvious winner in the two weeks or whatever they have to vote.  Did anyone else notice that our dear Patricia Clarkson had randomly disappeared from her seat behind Julie Andrews for quite a long time? Then again, who can blame her, getting beat by a bad Ma Cratchett impression and whatnot. And I hate it when the people in the front row don't win and aren't presenting anything. I'm sure that all those poor front row non-winners non-presenters feel awful.  And is it sad that I still love John Cusack for Say Anything? I think it may be.

       Cate is depressed.   I feel awful. I keep going all Holly Hunter in  Broadcast News  for no good reason at all. I just randomly started tearing up in the middle of my (very, very painful and arduous) ortho appointment. Last night I cried so long I forgot what I was crying about. I'm not going to school until lunch, and even then I'm still not sure if I really want to. Plus, I have my frelling algebra testing tomorrow, as if that makes me feel even remotely better. Also, Vati was screaming at me because my band teacher is a dipshitz and Vati apparently needs someone to scream at. This really pisses me off and is not made better by the fact that my mouth tastes like glue and I have a tooth being pulled up from my gum with a 17-square steel nitrate wire. (I didn't have my usual braces lady today, so my appointment ran late, I missed the bus to my band trip, no one talked to me while I was in pain, and she popped off five brackets.) Also not making things better, the fact that I fell on my knee coming out of a booth-- frelling high heels-- at Zesty's last night (an incredibly stupid experience in itself) and it still hurts, and that I'm a female hormonal teenager.   I'm sorry to dump all this on you. It's just that I need the internet so I can download today's free Courtney Love song off iTunes. I also need a shrink.

       A Love Letter to iTunes   Dear iTunes,  I am a pitiful, miserable soul. I am currently downloading something by Avril frelling Lavigne. And all because it is free. This is horrible. How did you know that I am free's bitch? If it is free, I take it. I take concealer samples that do not match my freakishly pale skin. I take lotion samples that dry out my freakishly dry skin. And now, I am downloading a song I hate because it is free.  God. I love iTunes.

       Cate at Newspaper: April 28, 2004   Fametracker forums are back on Monday, happy happy joy joy. And on this Sunday, if I counted correctly, my article on the Academy Awards will be two months old.   BB and I realized today that things like dating will just never click in our heads. And we have the Problem Pow-Wowers sitting outside the newspaper office, inventing problems for the advice column. And a fourth-grader is playing a game that looks vaguely like  Kill Bill , which evidently, made Princess Di say, "I want to puke my liver up." Or something to that extent. Nothing of that had any correlation.

       "God in heaven!" "Yeah, that's where He is."   We have to do this frelling stupid, bloody awful kite project for graduation, largely because Jalonski thinks this will make our parents happy. I don't think my parents will be happy with all the distress and child labor she is putting us through, but Jalonski doesn't seem to care. So, yes, I have to find pictures that describe me, pictures cut from magazines or printed off the newspaper that describe my future (I'm looking for a purdy Vera Wang dress that I'll wear to my first Oscars at the moment and InStyle is not being much of a help), words that describe me, words that describe my future. I don't even know why I'm telling you this. I just have nothing better to day. Perhaps you can think of words that describe me and my future screenwriting/directing future. I'm thinking "stubborn," "controlling," "whiny," and "not very maternal except when it comes to King Oliver Shmu Bonsai the First" aren't going to make the cut.  BB and Me: This is going to be the coolest prison ever! Mrs. W (no, not the math teacher): "It'll be the coolest prison ever!" People will want to come!  Me: Even the moldy bread will be cool!   Giseler: You gols are bwiwwiant. (Translation: You girls are brilliant.)   In other news, a very happy unbirthday to BB's little sister, who will not be given a nickname until further notice. BB's sister is a character. She calls Betty "the big gray blob."

       Ancient Friday Fives on a Monday   Here are a few old Friday Fives, because I have nothing to write about and feel like I must write about something that isn't the script for this frelling play. So here it goes.    1. Where were you born?  Salt Lake City, Utah   2. What is your favorite number?  Three or seven. How about thirty-seven?   3. Vanilla or chocolate?  God. It depends.     4. What section of a bookstore would I find you in?  The section on movie books, the young adult section, the adult fiction section, and the multimedia section. Also, if we are talking about B&N, the Starbucks.   5. What kind of a mattress do you have on your bed?  A very old, not very soft one which I love. For no good reason.     1. What is one thing you dislike about your body?  My pointy chin, which I could probably use as an icepick if I really, truly wanted to. Oh god! And my fivehead.    2. What are two things you love about your body?  My bone structure is rather nice, especially my vertebrae when I wear a low-backed dress, and I have a nice neck.    3. What are three things you want to change about your home?  My bedroom, the hideous  Wizard of Oz  kitchen, and the windowsills, which have been scratched up and mutilated by my dog.   4. What are four books you want to read this year?   urlLink Pamie 's book;  The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay ,  The Virgin Suicides , and the  Pieces of April  screenplay book.    5. What are five promises you have kept?  Oh, god. I have kept a lot of secrets. I promised that I would find a way to make a few of my CDs work on iTunes and I did. I promised to make my bed on a daily basis. I promised to write on a daily basis, not necessarily in the blog. I promised to stop calling strangers "fools" and calling this group of people I don't particularly like "the Eggheads." Although I didn't keep that last one. I can't fucking help that they have egg heads, yo.

       A Present for BB   I wrote this for BB today, in this exact grammar and lack of sentences:  "Okay butterflies once when I was little I had a butterfly named Annabeth after BB but we called her Anna b/c a 3 syllable name got too long after a while, you know my hand hurts oh! holicia was looking thru my notebook today and it really "cheesed me off" as our band teacher would say as his scalp turned red and exploded, shooting his ugly woodshop glasses off his face across the room while BB and I got the giggles as we are prone to do okay, that didn't hapen but it would have been very, very funny like a bong hat now i'm going to go give this to BB."

       Giggles   BB and I had the giggles so frelling bad today. We were told to stand still during rehearsals, and I said, "It smells like dentists. It smells like Jerry Beene." and we giggled nearly half an hour, including full-blown shouting embarassing things such as "DENTAL TART!" and "FUT THE SHUCK UP!" and "I AM DEMENTED" in front of the preschool room.

       Cate at Newspaper: April 21, 2004   Anyway, since I promised, I'm going to explain Poop the dog and calling strangers "fool." And it occurs to me that my newspaper article is two months old. Good god. I hope no one who's part of this ever grows up to be in journalism.    Poop the Dog   Our neighbors have decided to name their dog "Poop." It's short for some offensively long Polish name, but Poop? That's just mean. Mean. MEAN. Poor dog.    "I'm Coming, Fool!"   We were at ShopKo the other night, poking around in the makeup section because Vati has a cold and he sent Mutti and I to go get his prescription. So, some lady who sounds exactly like my madre, shouts "Let's go!" and I shout right back, "I'm coming, fool!" (Mutti and I use "fool" as a term of affection. Really.) Except it wasn't Madre. Madre, rather, is laughing her ass off one aisle over.   I really am a fool.

       Happy Dance, Happy Dance, Cate Loves to do the Happy Dance!   And BB was probably the only person who understood that title.  So, anyway. Good news for my day:    Oliver Beene  is coming back! And BB will also understand my excitement! This means that, although I'm still writing my Sad Letter to Charlotte Beene, I'm a bit leses distraught.    I found out that not only is Holly Hunter "slightly demented" in  The Big White , her character also has Tourette's. For some reason, this makes me very, very happy. Since I am a very mean person, Tourette's makes me laugh quite a lot. And since I also like Holly Hunter quite a lot, she's one of the few actors I'm going to let run away with letting me laugh at faked Tourette's. Oh, I hope it's the kind of Tourette's that makes her shout random swear words.     Angie is back! And she's bringing me a copy of her Texas Greatest Hits CD!    Diana has a blog! I must pimp. It is my rightful duty to pimp Diana's blog.  urlLink Diana's Pimplicious Blog!    Anyway. My next entry will either be about the dog named Poop, shouting "FOOL!" at complete strangers in ShopKo who I mistake for my mother, or it will be my newspaper entry and be about both of these things. Unless something interesting happens before I actually act out my plan to write that entry.

       Dear Madonna   Madonna recently abandoned her best friend, Debi somebody (Kozer, I think), because she doesn't believe in the Kablahblah. I mean, oh, jesus. That is just wrong on so many levels. You don't reject your best friend just because she doesn't have a red string that looks like a fucking hair tie around her wrist! Jesus! I mean, who's gonna be Madonna's best friend now, Demi Moore?   That really pisses me off. If I ever dump any of my friends for a trendy religion, please shoot me. In the head, not in the foot.

       I Can't Write Letters for Beans. Truly.   I'm writing a letter to Emma Thompson. Or trying to. I'm explaining that I mean to harm by my adaptation of her writing, and that I'd write a letter to Jane Austen, also, if Jane Austen wasn't so dead. In case you couldn't tell by the last sentence, it isn't going very well. Here's what I've got so far:  "Dear Emma Thompson, I am adapting a play of  Sense and Sensibilty  using your script. I mean to harm to you or Jane Austen. I'm doing a bad job and I'm really really sorry."   As you can see, I've written myself into a dead end. Perhaps I should write the last sentence out.   And, for a different Emma: The midgets are coming.

       Cate: Your Future Theater Diva   Margo (formerly Hallie) and I are starting a play over the summer. We've decided to take  Sense and Sensibility  and modernize it. We're going to be collaboratively writing, directing, and acting, as Ellie (moi) and Maria (her.) So...yes. And many of the people we know will be participating, whether they wish to participate or not. We're excited, yes. And if this makes you excited, too, send us money. We love money. It will help pay for... something. Probably doughnuts from the Krispy Kreme of the future. But, hey, if it improves the work ethic, it's worth it, right?   And, it's two-for-one entry day!   Princess Di is Priceless   Di: My grandmother is a trash-talking card princess.   [Diana's family is playing Taboo, and Diana on her family playing Taboo]  Di: Beloved Aunt Cheryl seemed to think the Amazon river was somewhere in Africa.   "Boys wear these to prom." "Condoms!"   BAC: You've heard a lot of these in your life.  Di: Lies?   "Boys do this a lot." Di's Mutti: [after cackling] You're going to have to give us a lot more than that.

       Yu-Gi-Oh. That's all. Just Yu-Gi-Oh.   In eight hours, I can swear again. This is, sadly, the highlight of my day.   Mom: [on her cell phone at Target] Do you know what kind of Yu-Gi-Oh cards your brother likes? Me: Um. [Very long pause.] No, actually. [Mother proceeds to rattle off about forty bizarre, pretentious names that one can assume is the product of Japanese words being lost in translation. Are Yu-Gi-Oh cards even made in Japan? I don't know.] Me: I have no clue.   I have convinced my dog that I am the weirdest human being in this house. This morning, I put one of her toys on my lap (I was kneeling the lazy way with my knees on my butt.) Then, I proceeded to wave my arms in the air for no good reason at all. She just looked at me in this hilariously blank way and my mom yelled at me because I'm mean to the dog and I was, apparently, confusing her. But, seriously, if you have a dog that doesn't have fleas (::cough::Betty's dog, Fleabiscuit::cough::), try it. It's worth it all for the blank dog stare.

       The Door Incident   My mom's friend came to drop off this wonky machine that puts holes in things today. Unfortunately, it's very dark out and my dog started barking maniacally, so I panicked a bit. I was in the computer room, and there's a swinging door between the computer room and the kitchen. And I walked right into it. And, of course, my mother's friend saw.  Mom's Friend: Sorry I scared you. Me: Yeah. I walked into a door. Mom's Friend: I saw that.   My mother thought this was absolutely hilarious.   My blog has been a result of searches for "Lesley Ann Machado," "Kelly Ripa's baby names," "Oliver Beene," "how to fake sick," and, famously, "Patricia Clarkson naked." Oh, gods. Is it sad that I'm more worried about the Lesley Ann Machado bit than any of the other ones?   Then again, I just walked into a door. How the hell would I know?

       [Insert Title That Made More Sense in my Head Here]   Okay, even that title made more sense in my head. But you can feel free to shut up about that bit.  Fracking church. I have to go to stupid Stations of the Cross tonight. Because, apparently, my parents do not care that my brother and I had to do this yesterday morning. They just don't want us to be left home alone. (That was a joke. They love to leave us home alone. I think sometimes they just drive around, polluting the ozone layer and wasting gasoline, for the sake of leaving us home alone.) I don't understand why they're doing this. I mean, we have to sing these stupid haiku songs at the end of each station. It's like bad Goth poetry for catholics, really.   Anyway. I saw  Miracle  again today. Such pretty people in that film. Ungodly attractive, really. Well, some of them, not so much. But the pretty people just make up for their comparitive less-attractiveness. ::Cate sighs wistfully.:: I love pretty people.

       Chicka, Chicka, Chickabee   I just took Entertainment Weekly's 90s Pop Culture quiz. Well, now I know where my 90s strengths lie: identifying the Hansons (with Hallie's help), identifying the Spice Girls, identifying the artists of one-hit wonders, identifying Alanis Morisette's ironies ("Isn't it Ironic"),  Seinfeld , the Teletubbies, John Grisham novels (well, the titles are so obvious as to the plots), the names of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (and their favourite food), what Forrest Gump said to the president at the White House, and the secret basement meeting held on  The West Wing . But, shout out to Jodie Foster's demented  Nell  lexicon made me obscenely happy.   In other news, I love Jolly Ranchers. I am thanking Jolly Ranchers in my acceptance speech, because I am orally fixated (don't get any ideas, perverts) and need to have something sugary in my mouth to write well. So: Thanks, Jolly Ranchers.

       Hm. Can't Think of a Title.   Hm. This day was excruciatingly dull. Except getting yelled at by the substitute, hereafter known as Mrs. Gibbles, again today. This time for screwing around with Betty and BB. Betty started laughing uncontrollably, so did BB and I, BB left the room and Betty and I managed to control ourselves but then she walked back in and she got the giggles again. I have no idea what we were laughing at anymore.   Did anyone else catch Lorraine Bracco on  Conan  last night? Her story about Salvador Dali and the painting of the man with the red penis was hysterical. Albeit not as good as Allison Janney's Getting Mugged in L.A. Story, which is a classic. So many of my favourite people give good, charming, witty interviews, though, so it's rather hard to pick just one favourite. For example, Holly Hunter has the best story about being deficient in athletic ability, the Bad Pitching Story. And Patricia Clarkson has the best (only) Hockey is Sexy story. And the best Scary Clothing of the 80s Story. And Emma Thompson tells the best stories ever. So it's quite hard to pick just one, you see. Although I assure you that Lorraine Bracco is the official champion of Salvador Dali stories and Offensive Pictures of Men with Red Penises stories.

My parents already said that they know I've been working my butt off and don't really care if I fail algebra (I won't, but still), but the thing is that I don't like doing bad in math.

       The Neighborly Lawn of Terror   It occurs to me that my screenplays will be full of bizarre things BB says throughout her day, such as "It's times like these when I wish I was a dinosaur."   But, also, I must also add a new element to my screenplay: the Neighborly Lawn of Terror. BB knows the lawn; as does her mother (her mother says if she ever got cancer and had a last wish, she'd like to pick through these people's basements because it would make her feel better about her own.) They have numerous strange things in their lawn. Multiple aquariums, a plethora of computers, bowling balls in the garden. They cut down a perfectly nice tree and replaced it with more bizarre things. I mean, they're very nice people, really, but... they live in Lawn Hell. You know it's getting sad when I'm wondering why we have a screen by our trash cans and BB's mom says we could just put it in their lawn and they'd never notice and it's the absolute truth.  My new motto is, whenever I say something mean, "That was mean and horrible and catty, but I meant it."

       Cate Defends Her Playlist, or Why Joan Cusack Rocks My Face Off    The 6ths, "As You Turn to Go" : Just an excellent song. Stephin Merritt is the best songwriter. And it's on the  Pieces of April  soundtrack, which is a fabulous album.   Stevie Nicks, "Edge of Seventeen" : Okay. I know what you are thinking, that I secretly worship Stevie Nicks. That is not so. I not-so-secretly worship Joan Cusack. Cello,  School of Rock ? It's not as good without Joan's crazy hand gestures, though.   PJ Harvey, "Good Fortune" : Just a good song. All of her songs are good, but this is one of my favourites.   Wilco, "Heavy Metal Drummer" : This is the best song on one of my all-time favourite albums ever made.   The Shins, "Young Pilgrims" : These lyrics are the best strange lyrics ever. Stephin Merritt's are all deep and sensitive and whatnot, but sometimes, I need my weird musical people.   Elliott Smith, "Baby Britain" : Very upbeat, and, although I've never been there, I love Britain.   Travis, "Flowers in the Window" : Also quite upbeat. I don't usually like Travis but this is just a good song.   Sam Phillips, "I Need Love" : I've heard it in a couple movie trailers and was surprised by the title because it's mercifully un-cheesy.   Weezer, "Island in the Sun" : Possibly my favourite song of all time.  Imperial Teen, "Ivanka" : Actually, "Island in the Sun" is probably tied with this song as far as my favourites go. They played this in the  thirteen  trailer and I just loooooved it. It sounds like the theme song of a great 70s spy show.   Jane's Addiction, "Jane Says" : Fantastic song. A classic, really.   The Pixies, "Monkey Gone to Heaven" : Another classic from my other favourite alt-rock band of the 90s.   Sparklehorse, "Piano Fire" : I originally downloaded (shut up, I'm doing it legally now) this song because the title fit with a great inside joke of ours, but it's also quite upbeat except the lyrics are incredibly depressing.   Fleetwood Mac, "Rhiannon" : Okay, this is just a good song, even if it did inspire a bunch of hippies to name their children after it. (Sorry if your name is Rhiannon. It's a very nice name. Just tends to be found on the children of hippies.)  Cake, "Short Skirt/Long Jacket" : A fun, fun song that also has great crazy lyrics. I love Cake.   A Band of Bees, "Sky Holds the Sun" : A calm song. To wind down with.   Her Space Holiday, "Sleepy California" : McDitto.   Suzanne Vega, "Tom's Diner"  : This is less calm, but it gets me all revved up for when I restart the playlist.  I don't know. I had a really crap day and I don't feel like talking about it. So if I don't write as much today as I did yesterday, you know why.

       Playlist Mixes and Why I Adore Catherine O'Hara    The Onion : Who could you take in a fight?   Catherine O'Hara : A physical fight? Um, someone sleeping.    urlLink Here  is the article.

But if I could drive, what I would listen to while I crashed into a vast number of stationary objects.   -The 6ths, "As You Turn to Go" -Stevie Nicks, "Edge of Seventeen" -PJ Harvey, "Good Fortune" -Wilco, "Heavy Metal Drummer" -The Shins, "Young Pilgrims" -Elliott Smith, "Baby Britain" and "Rose Parade" -Travis, "Flowers in the Window" -Sam Phillips, "I Need Love" -Weezer, "Island in the Sun" -Imperial Teen, "Ivanka" -Jane's Addiction, "Jane Says" -The Pixies, "Monkey Gone to Heaven" -Sparklehorse, "Piano Fire" -Fleetwood Mac, "Rhiannon" -Cake, "Short Skirt/Long Jacket" -A Band of Bees, "Sky Holds the Sun" -Her Space Holiday, "Sleepy California" -Suzanne Vega, "Tom's Diner"   I'll explain my attachments to these songs in a later entry when I have more time. (I really do not have a Stevie Nicks addiction. I swear.) But in the meantime, feel free to tell me how much arse my playlist goes around kicking.

       Cate, Meet Blushing.   I blushed for the first time in my own recorded history today. As we all know, I do not have many epidermis-related pigments in my body and am, in fact, just about as white as you can get without being considered albino or medically dead, thus, I do not blush much. Today in language arts, Pat 2 and I were quoting  O Brother Where Art Thou?  and he said the line (in a very bad accent, may I add) "I've stated my piece and counted to three." To which I replied, "Son of a b*tch!" But the class decided to synchronise their awkward silence with my stage-whispered expletive. And we had the Stupid Swearing Sub, who told me, hypocritically, that I would be left with a warning. Well, she's sworn dozens of times and no one's given her a warning, ever, as she is obviously still invited to teach at this school.   According to Tickle.com, my IQ is 117. Which is inaccurate because: a) I got mad at the last page and guessed on the answers and b) I have already taken the government-standard IQ tests and it's much higher than that at 178. (See? I'm not just a pretty face...) Although my extended family occasionally does not believe this and immediately buys into the fact that my other cousins are smarter (well, some of them) largely because their parents do nothing short of posting their report card grades in the newspaper. And, well, I'm sure their kids "apply themselves" in math. Which I don't. Because math sucks. (Another fallasy from the IQ quiz: I'm good at math problems. Um, no. Logic problems, yes. But not math. I guessed at the math ones.) And that is why you should not take Tickle.com's IQ test. Because it sucks and it will only tell you that you're good at guessing at math problems.

       "Is gassy spelled with two S's or three?" --Beans on Even Stevens   B-squared and Betty will get that one. Those of you who don't, you really, truly do not want to know.   I am trying to think of something more interesting to say. I got nothin'. I spent all my free iTunes songs. "Girl from Mars" by Ash is quite a good song; so is their song "A Life Less Ordinary" on the soundtrack of (duh)  A Life Less Ordinary .  Gods. My life is boring. I cannot even think of something witty to say about its dullness. I need some sleep. I think I have slept all of six hours this week. I only sleep like a normal human being when I need sleep desperately. Usually, I will stay up all night until about four in the morning just reading or writing or doing friggin' crossword puzzles. I don't need the sleep, really, to run like a healthy human being, so I utilise it in slightly more useful ways, and, when I need sleep, I will sleep normally. So it's not that freakish, just a bit hyperactive. Although there was one night on vacation when I could not sleep because I kept hearing these very realistic (read: not in my head) cat noises outside on the deck. So maybe my sleep habits are freakish. I don't know.  What is happening to my writing skills? I'm discussing my warped sleeping habits as if people actually care. Perhaps it was all the gas I was exposed to last night. (Yes, I Febreezed my room. It doesn't smell any better.)

       My Wonky Clock   I stupidly threw away my digital clock last year and bought a very cheap one from IKEA that is not digital (which would explain it's ninety-nine cent cost) but very cute. This new, non-digital clock is usually quite accurate, but it told me I had woken up at quarter to seven this morning (it was really 9:30) and I left my bedroom at what the clock said was 8:45 but was really 6:15. Screw you, wonky clock.

Me: Oh my gods! We're talking like Homestar Runner ("homestaw wunnow")! Madre: Sowwy. We'we all out of tape.   (Moments later) Me: Oh my gods!  Pieces of April ! I love that movie!

       "You are number 365. On a scale of one to ten, that is how much you are overacting." -Lars von Trier   Anyway.  Betty will not be at school today and B-squared is probably ill again. Which means I could very well go insane if Franny B. is not there. And that my plans to go see my idol (okay, one of my idols) Patricia Clarkson and my boyfriend Patrick O'Brian-Demsey for the low, low price of $2.25 have likely been squandered, squashed, ruINed.   [sarcasm] You know, I think the print on Ain't it Cool News needs to be a bit larger. I can't exactly read it. [/sarcasm.]  So I'm bitter because I had a very very sucktastic night last night and my brother just had to squander my plans for tomorrow night (again, I cannot wait until I am shipped off to film school in four years) all so he could see LeBron James. I mean, come on, LeBron James will fade and die but my childhood will likely be immortalised on film forever.   Grrr.

       Debra Winger is a spastic die-er.   Urs-jalon had a minor nervous breakdown near the end of the day which led her to dumb the trash can out all over the floor. I don't know why.  I did quite well on my memorisation of the Gettysburg Address today, which proves that doing yoga, memorising, and watching a very bad episode of  The West Wing  all at the same time is fantastic for your report card.   According to amazon.com, Jessica Simpson's new CD is going to help me survive high school, and  Shadowlands  is a great film about greiving. In which Debra Winger, not surprisingly, dies. I am not sure why I hate Debra Winger and her compulsive deaths so much.

      Since I have discovered Yahoo TV Search, my television life is looking much more optimistic.  O Brother Where Art Thou?  is on tomorrow night! I am immensely overjoyed. Then, at eleven the next morning, my favourite episode of  NYPD Blue  is on the telly. Then, that night,  Junior  is on but, as much as I adore Emma Thompson, I don't know if I am willing to sit through two and a half hours of the worst movie ever made (with the small exception of  Honey .)   Anyway. I am trying think of a great  O Brother...  quote to wrap this up, but all I can come up with is: "R-U-N-N-O-F-T" and "You two are dumber than a bag of hammers." And those really aren't working for me this morning.

       Various Random Thoughts   On  urlLink the LJ , I have posted a bit of the screenplay I'm working on right now. It seemed like a good idea. But don't go diss it. If you have a constructive critcism, please share it, but don't diss it. That's just mean and I'm not in the mood to deal with anyone who would do that.  I bought two pairs of flip-flops for five bucks at Old Navy today. I got hot pink and turquoise. They have just the best flip flops. I had the red ones but I lost them in Chicago. I love flip-flops. I have two (formerly three) pairs of Old Navy ones, a pair of red heeled ones (my favorite shoes), a pair of sequined turquoise ones from Old Navy a few years ago, a denim pair, another very cool beaded Old Navy pair, yet another Old Navy pair that ruined my feet (no wonder they were two dollars), and various other pairs. It is insanity.   I wonder if Betty Jean is ever going to call me like her vater promised she would. I am getting rather impatient.

       Cate Reviews 'Raising Helen'   Yes, I have been to the theater again. We were going to do the fireworks at the pier, but it rained, so BB, Betty Jean, Franny, Laurana and I went to see  Raising Helen . So here is my review. Hopefully the bulleting won't go insane again.   LOVED    JOAN CUSACK!!! She is just the best and made it totally worth the eight dollars (and the four dollars for a cherry-blue raspberry swirled Icee). She makes every line a million times funnier. "If you so much as blink in her direction, I will bury you so far down that the heat from the Earth's core will incarcerate your sorry ass." is now going in my AIM profile.     Liked    It really was a very cute movie in general.    DEVO HATS!! "WHIP IT"!!!     Just Okay    Abigail Breslin got really annoying after a few seconds.    The movie got a bit preachy, too. And it wasn't all that well-written.     Hated    Stupid Kate Hudson and her stupid wardrobe of poop brown bathrobes used as shirts. AND UGGS. God, I hate those boots.   And, in non-cinematic affairs, we had the morons who work at the theater emptying trash very loudly and jumping over things behind us, and someone made a very random moaning sound, to which BB and I lost our shit to, and Betty Jean didn't even hear it. She thought we were laughing at this really lame line in the movie because we were crying. It was great.

       Cate Reviews 'Shrek 2' and 'Calendar Girls'    Calendar Girls    Loved    Helen Mirren was just excellent.    The beginning scenes with Chris and Annie laughing their asses off (BB, I thought of you and I during band or some other boring class where we are mainly lectured at) and the Victoria sponge cake.    Just about everything else.    Just Okay    I didn't like how sad it got towards the end. I won't say what happened, but it's more depressing than all the outwardly upsetting stuff, like Annie's husband dying and whatnot.    Hated    I can't actually think of anything off the top of my head that I hated.     Shrek 2    Loved    Jennifer Saunders and John Cleese were both excellent, as was everyone who is not named "Cameron Diaz."    The Pinnochio lying gag    The ending.    Bringing back a few notes of "Hallelujah," which I only noticed because I was listening for it    We had excellent previews again (well, except for  Shark Tale , which looks awful and stupid), including... drumroll please...  The Incredibles , which I am so incredibly excited for, due to the marvelous presence of one of my idols, Holly Hunter.    Just Okay    It was unnervingly short.    I'm not a huge sequel fanatic.

       Letters from Cate   Dear Woman Sitting Behind me at  Shrek 2 :  Stop laughing. And stop talking. And stop telling me what happens at the end. You laugh like a donkey. Just stop.   Hate, Cate (Hahahaha. Rhyming is fun.)   Dear Nice Family Sitting Next to Us at  Shrek 2 :  You were very nice! And strikingly well-behaved! Not a talker or a seat kicker in the bunch, and you shared your popcorn! Plus, the mother gave us this comic gem when one of the four little boys said, "Aww, Mom, look at that!" at one of those puppy-mill ads: "Yes, sweet pea, isn't that sad?" (in a very clipped voice. You had to be there, I guess.)  Love,  Cate   Dear Princess Diana,  Get your skinny little ass back from St. Louis.  Waiting impatiently, Cate

Jack  (slightly bewildered): Well, that wasn't very nice.  I just thought that you all would like to experience the pain I am experiencing at the moment. Also, Betty Jean and I have decided that Patricia Clarkson is now free to date Patrick O'Brien-Demsey and they can have abnormally pretty children together and disregard age barriers everywhere.

       Hello from Franny B.'s Casa   I'm at Franny's. So, yes. Jewel has some serious melisma issues on "Hands," my god. I mean, really, is that note jump necessary? No! It is not! And if it is not necessary (read: entirely erroneous), don't do it! God!  So... yes. Franny's dog has about seven thousand names. Lily, Lucy, Bobo, Sho Sho, Sputnik, Butch, Bill, and Bob, to name a few. Sho Sho is also one of my Franny-induced nicknames. I think this dog is confused on his/her/its gender.  I have about seventeen people reading over my shoulder and we are listening to "Eye of the Tiger." Which Betty Jean has never heard, or so she just said. This is a very 80s song. That is all I will say at the moment.   Something just made a large crash. I'm too lazy to (god forbid) turn myself on this chair and see what it was. I will ask when I'm done writing.

       Cate Shows Some Concern for Celebrity Couples   Oh, god. Bugger, bugger, bugger. I am slightly depressed.  Patricia Clarkson and Campbell Scott broke up. But "remain good friends." Dammit, I am sad. They were my favorite celebrity couple, and now I have to talk about them in the past tense. I hate past tense. (Here, my brain says: "No wonder you dreamt they were in couples therapy." But it wasn't couples therapy in my dream! Because Angie and I are not a couple that is "on the outs," so to speak. It was BONDING THERAPY or something like that. God.)   Okay. I'll see y'all(s) in the morning unless I am possessed to post again before I leave this afternoon. Go admire my purdy icons if you haven't already. I am in a bit of a bad mood involving my icons, too, because no one is posting new bases because they all have to work or go to school or whatnot. And I want bases. Good bases. Anyway.

       Various Thoughts   I bought the new PJ Harvey song, "The Letter", off iTunes and it's very good. I am also re-installing AIM for about the third time. I also have advance tickets to the 7:00 showing of  Harry Potter  the day it comes out so I get to see it before I go to Alaska. (Yes, I'm going to be in Alaska for almost two weeks next month; I might be able to blog and I will when I can.)   Vati is out for "a dinner thing" tonight, which is Mummy's code word for, "he is out drinking with his co-workers." We got a new garage door today and it looks very nice. And it no longer has windows so I can play tennis against it, which is also a plus. A fact about me you might not have known: I love tennis and ping-pong. And air hockey, for that matter. And I am quite good at all of them. Some days, a lot more than "quite good." I also like foosball but I am prone to making the little men move the "cheater" way so no one likes me. And I love pool. Table games amuse me endlessly.  This was a very random post. If anyone asks, Fantasia did not win  American Idol . Even though  urlLink Just Roy , who has a pimplicious blog, will claim that she did.

       [Insert Boring Title to Match Boring Day Here]   Princess Di has joined the workforce, so wish her luck.   Anyway, here is a brief synopsis of the remotely interesting parts of my day:  Science- Got to play with dry ice in film canisters and balloons and got to make carbon dioxide bubbles. It was very, very fun, almost better than blowing up hydrogen balloons and making little puffs of fire yesterday.  Grammar- Listened to the crop dust planes flying overhead. Yes, we got crop dusted. Well, not us, but our nice little suburban community did.   Music- Music sucks. And we never got to sing "We Are the Champions" like I wanted because we had Mrs. Gibbles (the sub who chastized me for saying "son of a bitch"). Found out that Mrs. Gibbles knew/knows Auntie Silence from high school. She said she went to the girls' catholic high school in our city, so everyone was asking if she knew their moms and whatnot, and I asked if she knew Auntie Silence (largely to tell Angie) and she did. So, that is for Angie.  Got screamed at over lunch break, courtesy of Roz (sorry, Angie's Roz, if you are reading this, but she sounds exactly like Roz in  Monsters, Inc. , hence the nickname.) BB and I were not aware that it was indoor recess; then we went in the gym after we had been shunned inside. And apparently we should not have been in there, either. So we ran upstairs and got yelled at for running. Roz is so frightening. I wanted to curl up in the fetal position in a corner and shield my eyes.  Found out Mummy hadn't ordered yearbooks and got home and yelled at her, so she's managed to get me one.  That was all rather boring. I should probably have just told the concrete story, which I keep meaning to tell but I keep forgetting. This is not unusual for me.

I have a skinned knee as a war wound from my victory in Calling All Cars, which I'm not going to even bother to explain. It's a great game, but I'm tired, yo.   We are discussing the politics of Angie's Real Name and its numerous misprunciations courtesy of Grandpa R.J. (I do not have the talent of mean familial nicknames that Angie does. Okay, best nickname for our bitchy aunt ever: Auntie Silence. This may be genetic. Mummy's best insult for her mom is "The Lame-O.")  Anyway. I might be back later unless I get sucked into ABC's lame-ass blooper show.

       Negligent Rabbit Parenting Skills   We have newborn bunnies living in a hole in my mother's phlox. Not baby bunnies, newborns. They don't have fur, they are butt-ugly and my mom was shouting at the mother (she didn't know that she had given birth) since the moment she got home and eventually unleashed our dog on her. And now we have ugly little rabbit babies in a hole in the phlox. And crows are circling for them as their negligent mother has probably had a heart attack after my dog nearly killed her.   Words of wisdom from my latest e-mail to Diana: "****** just spelled rape "rap," which is wrong on so many phonetic and political levels. ::cough::R. Kelly::cough::." Bwahahahaha.

       iPods rock.   That is all. I am not going to enthuse any further. Although my iTunes has been possessed and does not show up on my iTunes. Perhaps that is because there is nothing new to add to it.   Thunderstorms are also very cool, especially when you are home alone.    Science Teacher : Shhhhhhh! Catherine, shhhhhhhhhhh!  Me : (not really listening) Oh.  Yes. I have nothing left to say, really. I think I may get roped into going out to purchase lingerie for my fancy-pants (that was purloined from BB) graduation dress. I have a black dress and black shoes, therefore I'll look like I'm attending a funeral, but I'll look classier then th rest of them, so there! And I'm going to see if the beauty school not-yet-dropouts (nod to Angie's entry about  Grease ) can give me a nice chignon. (I was desperately pushing for red shoes, but Mummy said that would be too non-traditional or something like that. Because, you know, everyone wears black dresses to graduation.) Needless to say, I love my dress except for its lingerie issues.   Ben might start a blog! To which I say, Go Ben! I'm sure your blog will be utterly pimplicious!

       iPod, iPod, iPod! Or: Cate is Ecstatic!   My iPod is "OUT FOR DELIVERY" in my city. (Well, city is a loose term. It is a city, and a well-known one, but I think it just reached 100,000 people, so it still falls under the category of Way Too Small for Cate, much to my mother's chagrin. She doesn't understand why I would go insane living somewhere quiet and laid-back where there are very few people. But anyway.) When I get home from school, where I have just about nothing of interest going on, (oh, well, I have to play Whitney Houston's "I Wanna Dance with Somebody" and talk about the 80s in history class, but whatever), I will have my shiny, adorable, lime-green iPod mini. I may have to get Hello Photoblogging just so I can get pictures of my pretty iPod in my very strange old-woman hands. (Yes, I have old-woman hands. They are even reaching monkey-paw status. They are very small and very bony. And old people in supermarkets like to argue about whether they're "piano hands" or "poet hands" when I just want to get my godforsaken Macaroni and cheese.)   I'm full of tangents today, which happens a lot of the time, but mostly when I am ecstatic! Ecstatic is a mighty cool feeling, yo! And Fake Sick and Vati are gone again for the weekend (I love Boy Scouts and their obsessive-compulsive need to camp), so I get to hang out with my mom all weekend, and with my Awesome Godmom on Saturday, perhaps with Angie. I am a bit foggy on the details except that it will be much fun, as always.   YAY YAY YAY YAY!  I think I may be bipolar.

The iPod Shipping Watch: "IN TRANSIT TO" (direct quote) "OAK CREEK, WI," which is a little less than two hours away from where I live. This is uberexciting. I am ungodly impatient.

       Algebra II, Tracking Shipping, Ashley is a Moron, and Other Random Thoughts   I tested into Algebra II! This is happy news, especially because I don't have to make a schedule change and I might be in the same class as Princess Di. We also discovered that we're taking the same level of English and science. We are nervous for science, because it's very hard, apparently, but very excited for English. I really, really hope I end up with Mrs. Brown, as I have heard nothing but good things about her. And Diana has her. I am ungodly excited for high school. I mean, it's not supposed to be the greatest time of your life, but still, it's a change. I love change.   I am now obsessed with tracking my iPod shipping. It is currently in transit from Chicago, where it has arrived and been unloaded. Hopefully I will get it around Monday! Yay! Living relatively near to the excellent shipping center of Lancaster, Pennsylvania rocks my face off.  Ashley is an utter moron. (Again, apologies to the millions of random Ashleys out there. Not a diss on you.) Today we had to clean the tables in homeroom and her notebook and copy of DumbLiteratureNovella (yes, it's a novella, dammit! A historical novella!) were sitting on one so I said, very loudly, "SOMEONE left their math notebook and DumbLiteratureNovella on the table!" and she decided, not realizing that perhaps the math notebook with her name on the cover and the DumbLiteratureNovella with her name on the inside cover, to throw them out! So now they are gone forever at the hands of a maniacally stupid teenage girl who cannot recognize her own name. ::Sigh:: It was very, very amusing. I laughed so hard I cried.

       Cate Analyses Highly Unscientific Quiz Results     You are KIRSTEN'S HOLIDAY BENDER.    urlLink   What Quirk From THE OC Are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    I didn't cheat, first of all. I cheated on the first few questions trying to get Seth's bizarre hand motions, but then I realized that I'd probably get them by not cheating, so I stopped. Then I realized that this is not so far off from the truth. I mean, think about it: what do I do on the holidays, when I am forced to deal with my family? I hide in my room with Angie and bong on  Home for the Holidays  and  Pieces of April  until I am strikingly less depressed. I can be avoidant, and I'm always procrastinating. Never drunk, yet, but I hope I train myself to stay away from the alcohol when I am Of Age. Because then I will have serious holiday benders. As if the alcoholism gene doesn't run in my family, I also have a really stressful one. So, yes, in fact, I am not Seth's spazzy hand gestures, as I had originally hoped and expected, I am Kirsten's holiday bender. Thank you, quizilla.com, for helping me see the light.  Oh, god. I just typed numerous words about the fact that my quirk is a fictional holiday blender and not jazz hands. Oh, god. It's going to be a long 5-9 days waiting for the iPod, yalls. I may have to rent  Miracle  and immerse myself in the pretty and the bonus features.

       The Gods of Amazon.com Shipping Answered my Prayers   YAY YAY YAY YAY YAY! I got an email from amazon.com today! My iPod has shipped! I will have it in five to seven days. And I just finished jumping up and down with a very happy face on. It was like Laura Linney in  Love Actually , except she has the best dimples ever and mine sort of suck (yes, I actually notice these things. Shut up, you). And she's tall, as opposed to me and my un-tallness. I like Laura Linney quite a lot. She had this thing in that dumb-ass  USA Today  little magazine thing we get in the Saturday paper where she recorded her going-ons of a day in New York City, plus, she was in  The Truman Show , so you just can't deny Laura Linney's coolness.  I don't know how I got from amazon.com's now marvelous shipping skills to Laura Linney. Perhaps she is the god of amazon.com shipping. The world might never know.

       Stop buying iPod minis so I can have mine, dammit!   Frell, frell, frell.  I hate amazon.com. I hate all these mothertruckers who are overbuying iPod minis so that I cannot get mine. I won't get it before my trip to Alaska, and I might not get it until JULY! I ordered on March 29th, you bastards! It is bad enough that I have had to wait this long! Now I will not have it for most of my summer! One more delay and I am going to take my very important business elsewhere.   Dear Gods of Amazon.com Shipping:  Ignore those mothertruckers who have orders before mine. MINE IS THE MOST IMPORTANT BECAUSE I'M A SELF-CENTERED, WHINY, BITCHY, IMPATIENT TEENAGER!  Love, Cate

       Flashers   This will be my most bizarre, unbelievable, controversial entry thus far, that is all I can promise. I can't necessarily guarantee that you enjoy my retelling of the incident, or my point of view, but, in that case, I'd like to ask you when I ever cared what people think of my opinions.   Okay, last year's band trip will probably go down in my school's history as the most horrible band trip ever. The hos, who we are going to give the very bland names of Jessica and Ashley (sorry to any Jessicas or Ashleys out there, I wanted to give very, very common names so as not to make identities known), on top of doing other randomly slutty things, were accused of flashing the boys in our class from their window. Also, Franny B., who had NOTHING to do with this, was involved and blamed for, as I previously stated, NOTHING. And it all blew up from there. That's it. Have fun with that one.

       Hey, if you saw the original title, lucky you!   Today was an eventful day, but not really. I called pears "peaches" for most of my lunch duty and frightened small children, including Frecklie (but it's so fun to be mean to him.)  Um. Have to clean and eat tonight before Vati gets home.   I think I may have to go out and buy the DVD of  Miracle  tomorrow. This is why I am that movie's bitch: 1. My Sexy Hockey Boyfriend, Patrick O'Brien-Demsey 2. Patricia Clarkson 3. Lots of bonus features 4. Blooper reel! My love of bloopers is inordinate and slightly demeaning. I have a fantasy that I will put out this ungodly serious film and release the DVD with a fifteen-minute blooper reel. 5. My Sexy Hockey Boyfriend.

       Float On   "Float On" by Modest Mouse is an excellent song. Also, if you are reading this and watching your telly, turn on Lifetime, as there is an excellently awful movie involving Tracey Gold and Kirsten Cohen playing an ex-stripper. It is, as I said, excellently awful. And I wish someone (i.e., Princess Di) would come online.   Oh, yes. The trip. The Jelly Belly Factory, etc.  Okay. Bus ride. Watched  The Princess Bride . Discovered that Holicia cannot keep track of a plotline and that "Wuv, twoo wuv" has to be my favorite line of that whole movie. This is when I was introduced to "Float On" by Buttface, who, with the exception of his Neil Young addiction, has excellent musical tastes.   Then, Jelly Belly Factory, which was just an obscene amount of fun. Angie, I picked up your frelling margarita Jelly Bellies and Hello Kitty isn't letting me check my e-mail. I'd tell you to re-send it to my AOL address, but it hasn't been letting me get e-mail as of late. Try my Yahoo account, that one might still be functioning. Anyway, I had my picture taken by a picture of Margaret Thatcher constructed entirely of jelly beans. We were depressed because we could not take pictures of the Princess Diana one for Princess Di. It was unendingly disheartening. But I raided the gift shop quite well despite that small bout of depression, and the funny paper hats and riding the train helped quite a lot.   Then, hotel. It was quite a nice hotel. Big pool, played lots of free ping pong and volleyball. Small rooms, though, and insensitive bitchy whores threw a party ("party," a word which usually intones fun, is used loosely, as this "party" was a bunch of wet middle schoolers standing around and watching ESPN and infomercials) and let other people inconsiderately throw other people's things, such as lingerie, on the floor. And, yet, BB and Betty Jean still were not allowed a room change.  Oh, yes, and also the band competition, which was the point we were there. Jazz band did excellent, won first with a superior (The Best) and a Judges' Choice awards but took home no solo awards (which is depressing, because Emma deserved one for her excellent keyboarding skills). Concert band, which I am a very bad part of, did okay, with an excellent (Still Pretty Good) rating at fourth place. Fifth grade band, which is not a very good band at all (sorry, fifth graders, but you have waaaaaay too many trumpets so then the woodwinds have to play waaaaaaay too loud), took second out of two bands with excellent. Which was a bit saddening because it's our director's last year and we wanted to do better for him.   Also, Six Flags on Saturday. We did the Roaring Rapids ride twice in a row and were wet and cold and still having an unbelievable amount of fun. Got to participate in a Mardi Gras parade and dubbed ourself the MGMs, Mardi Gras Mamas. Then we became the MGMSs, the Mardi Gras Mama Screamers. Paid way too much for food, except for the food which Jane (Larry's hilarious mom) smuggled in and the funnel cake, which was paid for by another very nice chaperone.   I know I should have just made this a LiveJournal entry, as it's so long, but also, funny things we said:    Katie : My sister can make funnel cake.  Jane : I bet it's really funnel!   Larry : Hey, Cate, do you have a Teen People or a Seventeen I could borrow? (Cate stares blankly.) I was kidding.   Cate : I gathered that.    Ms. Not So Type-A Perfect As I Had Originally Thought : Piss butts!

       Buhbye, Dahhhhhhhhhhlings.   So long. Farewell. Avederzain (or, for Di, abwidersain). Goodbye. I'll be back Saturday night. Hopefully I'll remain unscarred.   This blog would have been a really good thing to have this time last year, so I guess I'll just have to tell you what happened last year, because it was rather interesting, when I get back. It will be lot's of fun (that was for Di, too, because the lots own the fun, yo.)   Bye.

       Cate is a Band Geek!   Won't be back until Sunday, or late Saturday night, depending on if I feel like blogging or not. Why, do you ask? I have a band trip to attend in Chicago. It will be Lots of Fun. We will go to the Jelly Belly Factory, go to Six Flags, stay at the best hotel ever, and also, get to ride a coach bus down, where Franny B., Betty Jean, BB, and I have absconded the table with my FIRST! PICK! SLIP!  I am a band geek. Yes, indeed I am.   And, in more band geekishness, we had a concert today and BB and I were dancing along to the jazz band. There was this bit of a song that sounded like the Pee-Wee Herman dancing song, so I shouted, "tequila!" at exactly the right moment. We frighten small children. We should have our own frellin' variety show, because, really, if Jessica GigantoChin Simpson can have one, BB and I and our GigantoChin's will be so much better than hers. Take that, bitch! Hahahahaha.   I'm loopy. Tagboard is back. I'm trying to change the colors so the coordinate with the new template. And, admire my pretty picture! I am going to be one of those annoying persons who always changes her picture.

       Cate at Newspaper: May 12, 2004   Okay. I'm sorry, but I'm still figuring out how to get comments and a tagboard again. It's all rather confusing. If anyone knows how to figure this out, send me an email at Elfythefool@gmail.com. Actually, send me an email anyway.  I am sitting across from Frecklie again, but BB is not here to accompany me in my mocking. This is sad. Plus, Mummy is in East St. Louis for a few days, for various reasons, mainly being things like frelling hick gang children and their guns. (Hick gang children makes me think of "Sex Gang Children." Oh, don't go there, girlfriend.)   Franny is purporting stupid things, like child abuse, me being a tattletale, and Betty Jean (formerly Betty) being poor and foodless. Ha ha ha. She makes me laugh so very much. Anyway. I should probably start pretending that I'm doing something productive. Because I'm officially an editor. Or at least Betty Jean and I have elected me as such, since the old bitch of an editor is gone. I'm just fulfilling my duties, yo.

       Jaysus.   I. Hate. Algebra. It isn't even funny anymore. I was all happy and revved up because I got a 90 on my chapter test. I'm thinking, Go Cate! You couldn't have done so bad on your graded assignment. Yeah frelling right. Somehow, I managed to do really well (for me) on the test and COMPLETELY FLUNK the graded assignment. I didn't even fail it, I flunked it. Forty. Three. Percent.   But, you know what, I'm not really sure how I was expected to do well on that. I can raise my hand with a problem all of class and the only person who gets called on is Holicia, and maybe Ms. Perfect. I'm not really sure what is expected of me. So, I go up to Spacey, our math teacher, and say, "Is there any extra credit I can do to bring my grade up? Problems for the book, or a chapter review sheet or something?" Spacey thinks. Drifts off. Maybe attempts another crying spell. I really do not understand Spacey. She is the most outwardly, bizarrely emotional person ever. She randomly cries during class because GASP! The other math class is watching the Sharon Osbourne Show in the library or GASP! BB and Betty and I are talking in class again. Anyway, Spacey finally decides on, "I'll think about it." Think about it! I frelling made the effort to HAVE A DISCUSSION with you! Does she have any idea of the emotional strength that entails?  Oh, wait. Never mind. She wouldn't. That would require emotional strength.

       Frellity frell frell.   Okay. Got midterms today, and they suck quite a lot. So don't be surprised if I'm grounded and can't talk on here until I get back from Alaska. I have decided that I hate teachers who grade midterms low so that you're inspired to do better when they can tell that you really don't care. And ones who wait to correct the things you're good at until after midterms. Also, I'm doing moderately okay in math (a B-, which is really, really good for me, but that's probably because I test really well), which is just bizarre. Also, I'm going to be in Madison visiting Mummy's family all weekend, and next weekend I have my band trip, where we will be visiting the aforementioned Jelly Belly Factory, Six Flags Great America, and a hotel, which will take up my Friday and Saturday.   On a lighter note, here is a dream from last night: Angie and I are sitting amongst many people in a circle of chairs in the cafeteria area of a local grade school. We realize that Patricia Clarkson and Campbell Scott are sitting right across from us and we are very excited. Then we are having some sort of therapy game. Then we are magically transported to some vague theatre-lobby sort of thing, with gray carpets and a row of glass doors, and we run into Patricia and Campbell again. We have a very nice discussion. Patricia is very, very outgoing and exuberant and Campbell is rather reserved.   Talked to Mummy, who is going to talk to Vati about my slightly disappointing language arts grade. I hate the Potato.

       Pudding, Pudding, Pudding   Now, I am going to confess to you how much of a big-ass nerd I am and my love of the  OC . Okay:   I have the season finale on tape. I would like a moment of silence for my love of Adam Brody and Seth Cohen. Aw. Floating away on his boat. With, presumably, his iPod. While Kirsten, my other favourite kick-ass character, cries, and does so very, very well.   But: THERESA SUCKS. I FRELLING HATE THERESA AND SHE CAN FIND A HOLE AND DIE IN IT. Diana and I hope she dies during childbirth. Diana and I? Are mean. And we don't care.   Also, for Betty the Worm: the pubes are coming to get you! (Oh. Don't even ask.)

       What Cate is REALLY Thinking    Mom : No, you can't wear that to school, you have to wear this shirt, here, I'll give you a shirt, oh, that one won't fit, Catherine, if you don't stop you're going to bed earlier than midnight tonight.... Are you feeling okay?   Cate  (in her head): Jesus Christ, woman, I am feeling fine, there's Midol in the medicine cabinet for you.   Cate  (out loud): Well, we better be back from Mother's day shopping by eight.   Fake Sick : Why? What do you need at ShopKo?   Cate : I need to be home in time for the  OC  season finale, mother trucker, and if you waste any time looking at frelling Yu Gi Oh cards and making me late, I'll kill you. We are shopping for Mother's Day, not Fucking Yu Gi Oh Cards Day.

       Cate at Newspaper: Cinco de Mayo 2004   This little boy whose name ends unfortunately in -ie just said something about "dog hump" and he's breaking into silent maniacal laughter. I also just found out that I will be visiting the Jelly Belly Factory next weekend, so I'm inordinately happy despite having just attended a religious retreat. Oh, god. Did it suck. I'm trying to think of something funny and witty to say about it, but it's like they were a cult that sucked the snark out of me, only not really, because all day I thought about the  Strangers with Candy  episode where Jerri gets kidnapped by the crazy cult. (It didn't help that there was a person named Rebecca involved with both ordeals.)  Then I realized that my mum's very funny friend, who I'm not going to assign an alias, looks like a cross between Amy Sedaris and Amy Poehler and is just as funny as both.   Frecklie (ha... excellent alias) is going demented. BB and I just got the giggles. Bwahahaha.

       "Suicides in ShopKo"   At school, checking my SiteMeter. Apparently, someone Googled "Sucides in ShopKo" and found my blog. That is very, very odd and my personal favourite search of all time, even more so than all the naked women and Lesley Ann Machado and "Mike and Sally on Mike and Sally's Super Short Show on the Disney Channel" and "what do parents think of yu-gi-oh?" Yes. Suicides in ShopKo. I'm going to search this and see what else I get. Perhaps it is an obscure book or a stage play or something. Or just really, really odd.

       TV Moms are Funny Stuff.   Courtesy of  urlLink TV Tuesday    1. Who is/was your favorite TV mom?   Just about every mom on FOX's Sunday night lineup, especially Charlotte Beene, Lois, and Lucille Bluth.    2. Was she a realistic mother, or more of a TV fantasy type?  I think they all might be real people exaggerated for comedic purposes, especially Lois.    3. Which TV mom did you find the most unrealistic?  Carol. Frelling. Brady. Or Annie Camden.   ~Bonus~ No disrespect to your dear old mum, but which TV mom did you think it might be neat to have as your own?  Charlotte Beene rocks my face off. And I think that Kirsten Cohen would also be an excellent mom. (Oh. Shut up, you.)

       Cate Reviews "Mean Girls"   Okay. Breaking it down:   Liked    Lacey Chabert, who was absolutely perfect as a prep. The facial expressions, the voice, everything! So excellent. And she wasn't obscenely over-the-top or anything.    Tina Fey, and her excellent, excellent writing. I love Tina Fey. Not only is she smart, she also looks really smart. I am not even ashamed to admit that my haircut is very slightly modeled after hers and we have the same sort of glasses (although I got mine before I became addicted to SNL, Weekend Update in particular).    The whole story, and the fact that it succeeded at being a comedy-with-a-message, unlike  Bruce Sucksmightily .    The previews. We had frelling excellent previews, even. First, we had  Raising Helen , which Angie and I will be first in line to see in order to make sure our obscene Joan Cusack fandom is made known.  The Stepford Wives  was next, which looks very funny, although I am not drawn to the movie by anything in particular. Maybe at the Budget. Then it was  The Notebook , which had me tearing up a bit in my current overly emotional state. Although Rachel McAdams and Gena Rowlands look nothing alike, not like the freakish resemblence between Jessica Lange and Alison Lohman in  Big Fish . But Joan Allen looks excellent as the bitchy mom. And then  Shrek 2 , which I have no comment on.    The well-behaved audience and relatively pleasant theater-going experience.    Just Okay    Although I prefer Lindsay Lohan to most other teen actresses, I think Cady would have been a really great role to give to a complete unknown who was not part of  Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen     Not enough Amy Poehler.    The bad.    My frelling mother's hyena laugh.

       Summer Reading, Fool!   My summer reading list, or what they sent of it, looks rather disappointing. It is either books I am intirely uninterested in, or books I have already read ( To Kill a Mockingbird , which I have read numerous times, and  The Odyssey , which we did a unit on in seventh-grade history, to name a few). Apparently, I can find 350 more books on the school's website, but I can't. So if anyone has found it, please inform me, because I have to read three books from the list I haven't already read. I haven't found it in the "Library Resouces" section, which is where it should be (we promotte lytericie.)

       Cate is Less Depressed.   I really hate shopping unless I am depressed. Here are my purchases from the past 24 hours to give you a good idea of how depressed I was:  Music from the OC: Mix One  (secret confession: Cate likes The OC. She likes the music, the writing, Adam Brody, and Kelly Rowan), a polka-dotted tank top from Gap, a striped tank top from Gap, a three-quarter length light purple mesh hoodie from Gap, a rice paper lantern in the colours of my soon-to-be-painted-anew room,  Teach Yourself Screenwriting , and  Entertainment Weekly 's Summer Movie Preview. Retail therapy is yummy.  Although I still have no patience for department stores.

       Dear Photobucket: I am sorry about all my nasty comments. Kindly do not die.   Okay, those of you who ganked icons from me (Angie... Franny... myself), the reason they're not working is because Photobucket is going insane. It might be better soon, and, if not, I'm going to hire Robert Shapiro to sue them.  The best part of  Camp Nowhere  has got to be Tennessee for Tots: "Blay-unch."   Random label that makes me so, so, so happy: Glaceau VitaminWater, the dragon fruit kind, the label says, "We'd also like to inform some of you that dragons are imaginary. That means they don't exist."  We had the picnic today. BB threw things. A lot. And Princess Di spilled water in her crotch. (When we told Mutti this, her response was a really kick-ass pregnant-lady walk. Almost as good as my kick-ass pregnant-lady walk.)

       Tiny Dancer   BB, that bitch, now has me frelling addicted to this song. But I haven't succumbed and bought it off iTunes yet. Mainly because I know my mother has the CD somewhere.  Speaking of iTunes, I have another complaint with them: how is Hilary Duff's CD on the Independent 100 list? And William Hung? Yeah, you made up for it by putting Elliott Smith, Eddie Izzard, etc., on there, but Hilary frellin' Duff is Not Happening.   I have discovered the goodness that is LJ Icon Contests. I've signed up for three of them and completed all of my icons for it last night. They're very exciting, these contest icons. (Read: Thank God I discovered the goodness of Arial, size five bold, all-caps.)   I'm re-reading my David Sedaris books, that are actually my mother's, and it occurs to me that Charlotte Beene (alias Sister Mary Robert) (alias Wendy Makkena) would very likely kick ass playing David's-- yes, we're on a first name basis-- mother in the movie version. She's my favorite character, possibly even more favorite than The Rooster! She cracks me up. I have numerous away messages of her quotes, and I haven't even reached  Me Talk Pretty One Day . Personal favorites: "That might play back on Mount Olympus, but here, we don't wash our socks in the toilet." from  Get Your Ya-Yas Out! , and just about everything she says to David-- first name basis!-- in  Chipped Beef . Really, once I get to all the Rooster stories in  Me Talk Pretty One Day , it will be very hard to make a decision and, therefore, I just won't. They are both my favorites.  Later today, I just found out that some of the Emma Thompson icons I made will be  urlLink here . If they're not there when you go at first, check back. This has brought forth a plethoric abundance of odd morning-dreams in which Emma Thompson sees my icons (for whatever reason) and, thus, admits that I am her long-lost daughter. Which would absolutely be the kick-assiest thing ever, but like Hilary Duff being called "independent music", it's Not Happening. But it does give me a lot of opportunities to mention all these bizarre things to Angie, and purport that that's the reason I do such a brilliant British accent.   Chapter Three is up on  urlLink The Fiction Blog , so go check it out.

       A Startling Confession   There is photographic evidence of me drinking tea with my pinkie up. Oh, God.  "Oh, God" was one of the funniest things I heard all day. Not my, "Oh, God," someone else's. Upon realizing that she was the next recipient of the Lamebrain Church Spirit award (completely tarnished by Typhoid Mary, if it wasn't a stupid enough concept), in the middle of Father Harry/Mr. Burns' (he looks just like Mr. Burns from The Simpsons, I swear) speech about her, she (sitting in the row behind us) mutters, "Oh, God." It was the best thing ever about today.

       Iconage   I have a new userpic, as you all can see. It's of Julianne Moore, and I made it. I'm not sure why I chose that one, but I figured I should show off one of my icons, and that's one of my favorites.   I made a bunch of icons last night and they'll be on  urlLink The LJ  in a few minutes. Well, as long as LiveJournal quits being slow and asslike.

       BB on TV!   BB was on TV, along with the rest of the people that qualified for Nationals. Of course I recognized her first, because: a) it's BB and b) she has an extra-pretty special leo because she kicks more ass than the rest of them. She did very pretty round-off back-handspring back-handspring step-outs (not sure how to hyphenate that). So, after BB, guess what was the second thing I noticed, just by the curve of a spinal cord?  Slouchy.   [Insert shrieking and hair-tearing noises here.]  Then it was Mr. Bruce! Shout out to Mr. Bruce!  In non-BB Is Famous news, I think Mary-Kate Olsen is the next Tracey Gold. Except I really like Tracey Gold and hate Mary-Kate. But you get the idea. Both are/were child stars, both are/were anorexic, and both have ADD! Just think about that one the next time you read about Skinny-Bones Olsen.   I've started a fiction blog,  urlLink Screw the Typist . It's basically the continuing story of the Jones family. It's odd. Go read it.

       Well, Finally.   I fixed the cookies. I am way to tired to even try to pretend and/or think I am technologically literate.  Guess what? No, seriously. Guess. Whilst I was gone to Alaska (which was very, very fun because it involved rafting, sea otters, and pyromania by way of Michelle), my parents re-did my whole room!!! They painted it green, and it is COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. I love it so. I may post pictures of it on the LJ soon if I ever figure out the godforsaken digital camera. Because it's just way too pretty. And very IKEAized, thanks to Mummy's (and Vati's) trip to Chicago. Also products of the trip: Sephora makeup (the Sephora Lip Marker in rasperry, and Nars eyeshadow in Night Fairy), and a copy of  Eats, Shoots, and Leaves .   I bought Entertainment Weekly's Must List issue. It is, needless to say, a Must. I will talk about that, and my adventures in summer reading, tomorrow when I blog.   But, first, this is what I have to say about Alaska: I now like flying. Whitewater rafting kicks ass and might be my new passion.And quotes:   Attention-Seeker : What's erect-ill die-ess-function?   Kathy : You know, in this family, why can't you just fuck up and not have people think it's premeditated?  Grandma : Yeah, that's what we said. We said, "Yep, she just fucked up."   Michelle  (who is male, but had very long hair; he is speaking of the eskimo drawing on Air Alaska jets): The guys behind me, they were arguing over whether the eskimo was a bulldog or Bob Marley.    Grandma : I'm just going to spark on ahead to the bathroom.   Kathy : We told them, "She drools, she snores, she wets the bed."  Grandma : You told them I wets the bed?!?!?

       Nervous Pervous   Oh, God. I have twenty-four-and-a-half hours to worry about this, and I have already started. God.   I hate take-offs. They are horrible and stupid and make me unbelievably nervous. I am fine being in the air, although it takes me ten minutes to recover from take-off, and I love landing (except at Chicago O'Hare. Actually, I hate that airport in general. It doesn't do anything to help minimize my stress except sell a lot of magazines. And, alas, where do we leave from? Chicago O'Hare.) It's not that I don't want to go on the trip, it's that I really, really desperately do not want to take-off. I don't know what I'm going to do about this. Usually I am seated next to my mother (who just hates flying in general and insists that the only good part is when they have wine) or my father (who isn't necessarily sympathetic, but he tries very hard to talk me through it.) You know who should sit next to me? John Cusack. Then he can give me Lloyd Dobler's airplane speech, and I will be fine. Perhaps I will just read something as we take off and try to ignore the fact that we are. Does anyone have any methods of take-off combat? Because now is a very, very good time to share them.

       Ceramic Grandmothers and Cement.   Two stories I keep forgetting to tell that I'll forget to tell forever after Alaska.  1.  "Ceramic Grandma" : Diana and Betty Jean's friend from gymnastics has a grandma with two fake knees and a fake hip, or some equally synthetic combination, and said friend calls her her "ceramic grandma," which would be an excellent name for a band. Almost as good as Dental Tart, the name of my band that does not yet exist.  2.  Cement : This is better told in conversational format.  (Scene: A hotel room in Madison. DrunkMummy, Vati, Zach, Cate, my grandfather Little Lenny and my uncle Brain are watching TV. Except not really because Vati is channel surfing.)   DrunkMummy : Stop! Cement! (We stop at the cement channel.) I love watching people pour cement.   Me : Oh, God.  DrunkMummy : Seriously! It's therapeutic.  Vati : [Mummy's first name], they're putting dead-people ashes in the cement. To make "living reefs." For people who want to be buried at sea.  Me : Oh, God.  DrunkMummy : I still love cement.

       Frustrated. Or Fustrated (if you happen to be my grandmother.)   I hate packing so very, very much. I also hate airplane take-offs. Which is exactly why I have already deemed the next two days to be not much fun at all. Plus, Vati is in a mood.    urlLink Franny has a blog. Kindly ignore her flagrant use of my real first name. (Ha. Now you shall have to go and find it. Just still call me Cate, which you can consider my pen name. Not my stage name. That would be Ivy Cooper.)   That was pretty much the longest link ever. Wow. I have nothing to type about, really. Franny's impressions are pretty good, especially the one of Betty Jean (it is honest-to-God 100% true.) Diana needs to come online. Frank, stop making Diana fondle flowers and let her talk to me.

       Shut Up, Shut Up, SHUT UP!   The title works best if you say it in Lorraine Bracco's voice, a la  Riding in Cars with Boys , the last movie in recent memory that I liked Brittany Murphy in (along with  Drop Dea Gorgeous  and  Clueless .)  I made some Reese Witherspoon icons up on  urlLink the LJ . They're pretty good, probably the best I've made so far.   Buttface is feeling much better. He can now walk on crutches and has, evidently, been watching a lot of  Lord of the Rings .   ::sigh::. I leave for Alaska tomorrow night. I shall miss you all dearly. I won't see Franny for almost a month, and this is the longest BB and I have ever been separated.

       So, Yeah. That's What Happened.   I have a plethoric abundance of purdy icons of purdy people up at  urlLink the LJ . I made four sets of them today, and only one set was of customized bases. Good God.  I am enormously entertained by the soap opera recap in our local paper. The funniest is: " 'Passions':  When Kay refused to kill Charity, Tabitha cast a spell on Kay, turning her into an evil dog that chased Charita off a cliff, as Miguel struggled to save her." Good God! Who writes that show, and where can I send them a very stern letter as to why they should be fired?

       Quotes and Icons: Pretty Much My Two Favorite Things   Two new sets of icons, these of Famous People, not necessarily ones I like, are up on  urlLink the LiveJournal .    Princess Di : Betty has tunnel vision in the shape of a cell phone.    Cate : I wonder if the Pope does have balls.  Princess Di : Well, it's not like he got castrated or something, Cate.

       Cate Reviews 'Harry Potter'    Loved    Take a wild guess at who was my favorite. No, really. For serious. I think we all know that Emma Thompson rocks all of our faces off. And is deeply bizarre. She is my idol.    The part of me that not-so-secretely wants to be a director absolutely adores Alfonso Cuaron. (And Christopher Guest. This is why we know I'm a free-spirit, and I don't even have to wear knit hats! ::nod to Angie::     Liked    Emma Watson (who I loathed in the first two) and Rupert Grint (who I have always liked quite a lot) are becoming much better actors.    I really agreed with all the changes that they made from the book, except for the ending.    I loved the detail of Lupin liking music. I can't remember if that was a part of the book; I haven't read it in a while, but it was a very nice little detail. (No, I'm not detail-oriented at  all .)     Just Okay    Daniel Radcliffe is not advancing at the same speed his co-stars are as far as acting goes. It's not that he's terrible, it's just that he's not up-to-par, in my opinion. (I really hate to mock child actors unless they're utterly terrible.)    Sucky, sucky previews. Or at least we had one that ruined it all for me,  A Cinderella Story . And  Catwoman , which they could at least try to make look remotely good. I can't even remember the other ones, those just ruined it all. Oh! Wait! We had  The SpongeBob Squarepants Movie ! How dare I forget! That is in my top-three movies I am looking forward to this year, along with  The Incredibles  and... okay. Never mind. Can't narrow it down to three.  Napoleon Dynamite ,  Garden State  and various others are all tied for third. Whoa. Tangent.     Meh    I really hated the ending, which was the change I hated that I mentioned above.

       The Official Graduation Post   I am a high-schooler, a ninth grader, a freshman, whatever you want to call me. I wore a very pretty black dress and my feet hurt from dancing so much (I've heard that I am a "party animal" and that "I got some moves.") BB and I got to sit next to each other for the dinner, between Larry and Buttface (more about him later), which was quite a bit of fun. Except for the bit with the picture of BB and I dressed up as Teletubbies.   Anyway. BB is now in Florida and I will not see her for nineteen days. Angie made me the nicest mix CD ever with the nicest liner notes and made me cry. And Buttface dislocated his hipbone and his flexure tendon(s?) and can't move for three weeks. He's big-time knocked out with Vicodin, so Betty Jean and Franny and I are making him a care package. So I'm making him a mix CD of songs that make people feel better and burning him a copy of my  School of Rock  soundtrack. If anyone has any contributions they would like to make to the mix CD, speak up.   And, my favorite quote of all of last night:  Larry : (discussing a picture of Pegasus climbing a rope in a gym) Nice pole dancing.   We also got these very nice things saying what our teachers and classmates said about us. I feel obliged to post mine here, because it's all very true, so here goes: theatrical, sense of humor, diligent, talkative, excellent writer (I have a feeling that was our language arts teacher), comical, studious work habits, informative, a girl with a mission. Damn straight, yo.   I can't actually believe that I'm on summer vacation. And that people actually think a good way to solve an issue with another person is to ask me about it over AIM.

       Fun with Party Shuffle   Oh, I am such a reetah. This morning I have been all about Pixar movies and iTunes Party Shuffle.   "In Liverpool" by Suzanne Vega is really a very good song. In other musical affairs, I just discovered that Just Roy and I share an affinity for Dave Brubeck.   Props to BB for pointing out that I am the one who started the blog fad. In her header. And you wonder why Mummy calls BB "her favorite."   Harry Potter  tomorrow night! Graduation tonight!   We got a digital camera, so I will start posting lots of random pictures of my feet and my dog for no good reason at all. Or pictures of my TV. I took pictures of Cameron Diaz on  Ellen  just to see if I could without the picture being insane and it worked! It is hilarious and amusing.

       "Do we have to do dreams?"   I fell asleep in the shower tonight and had the weirdest dream I have ever had. So I am going to share this with you exactly the way it happened in the chat, except to, you know, clarify things a bit.    Cate :I dreamt that Mrs. ******, our [very pregnant] preschool teacher, died during childbirth.  Franny : she due june 8      Cate : and then I had to go to the funeral, and there was an open casket, which was disturbing and morbid.  Franny : hee. this is going to be funny. well it already is.  Diana :ewwww     Cate : and then the community of St. Matt's elected me to take her place, but not just as the preschool teacher, as everything that she does (whatever it is that she does.)  Franny : shes a really weird teacher  Diana : AHHH [Diana really just supplies random syllables the whole chat.]  Franny : you mean a mom?  Cate : (franny b voice)whatever it is that she does, having babies and whatever(/franny b voice). yes!!!!!  Franny :and be married to her weird hubby     Cate : and then I had my inititation ceremony, which was like the one in Finding Nemo, except I had to put lots of food on a Chinet plate. and then I woke up, so I never actually had to have babies or deal with anything.  It was a really odd dream, and I'd just like to say that I am not responsible for things that Franny says or things that happen in my dreams.

       "A READOMG FRP, ECC;ESOASTES"   This is the reading I'm supposed to be re-typing for graduation. Except it is written in a foreign language where semicolons are parts of words. I think I shall buy Ursula the Sea Witch a copy of Type to Learn and give it to her at graduation.  So, instead, I am blogging. Go figure. This is probably the last time I will blog to you all from SMS. And I am not very emotional about it at all. The only things I am really sad about are: leaving Margo, leaving KT, and leaving Annie. And maybe brewskies. That's it, those are the four things I'll be upset about.  And, once BB gives me the picture to scan, I will post a picture of the Jelly Belly Margaret Thatcher. And I guess I will chop my head off and post some of my graduation dress (or at least the incredibly well-cut back of it). And blackmail pictures of Angie and various other family members. Hee.  Anyway. I should probably actually type this reading. And there are even more icons up on  urlLink the LJ .

       Oh, God.   I am not even going to get into how upset I am with my mother. It isn't worth it. I'll just end up saying four million unnecessary things that nobody needs to know.  Betty Jean promises to start a blog when her internet is working again (read: when I bother to learn my reflexive/intensive pronouns. I really am a grammar Nazi, just one that hates pronouns.) And BB's blog has a new  urlLink URL .   I'm not sure what else to say. Nothing even remotely interesting happened, except for getting yelled at during my last English class by the Potato. (The yelling wasn't unsolicited. I was sticking my tongue out at Franny and making faces at her, which garnered me a "Catherine, very mature." which Larry tortured me with all day. Then I was quoting AKA Confessions--- you don't want to know what that is--- at Betty and we lost it and so I was yelled at again.)

         I know I haven't blogged much, but I haven't had a lot to say,&nbsp;sadly. Betty Jean and Di called me from camp earlier today, which was very kind of them.&nbsp;I went&nbsp;to the library and checked out a&nbsp;plethoric abundance of books, which I'm posting here because I didn't have time to tell Di on the phone and she was wondering:      The fourth &nbsp;Princess Diaries  book. I know, I know, but they're really very funny.     Knocked out by my Nunga-Nungas  by Louise Rennison     P.S. &nbsp;by Helen Somebody (Shetterly, I think, or Schulman-- I'm almost positive it's Schulman) , because the new Laura Linney/Topher Grace movie is based on it     Stripping and Other Stories  by Pagan Kennedy (okay, apparently non-literary parents name their children Pagan, too)     The Girl&nbsp;in the Flammable Skirt  by Aimee Bender     Kick Me: Adventures in Adolescence  by Paul Feig     The Adventures of Flash Jackson  by William Kowalski, whose parents did not name him Stanley for obvious reasons. Hee. Anyway, it's completely different than what the title sounds like.     The Shape of Things to Come  by Maud Casey    CDs:  You Were Here  by Sarah Harmer,  Figure 8  by Elliott Smith, and  She Hangs Brightly  by Mazzy Star    And, of course, a videotape of  Howards End  because I felt like watching it and I sadly do not have a copy of my own.    Also, I&nbsp;placed holds on  The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay  by Michael Chabon,  Why Girls are Weird  by Pamela Ribon (aka  urlLink pamie ) and  What to Keep  by Rachel Cline (or Cusk, I can't remember) because it had a good review in EW.     &nbsp;   But then I had forgotten my library card, and my whole wallet at home, so, even though I know my card number by heart, they couldn't verify that it was me since I had no ID with me. (Well, in all honesty, I cut my school IDs up thinking I would never use them again.) Thus, I had to wait for Madre to pick me up in order for me to check out on her card.     &nbsp;   Just Roy is in Nashville right now, snaps for him.     &nbsp;   I don't have much else to say.

       I am in a Holly Hunter-on- Letterman  (which is sadly my least favorite talk show that I've had the displeasure of watching, except for the Biff guy segments)-induced happiness. I think she and I would get along quite well, actually, we could just sit around and torment the garbage-dumpers and watch the "smorgasboard of passers-by" (hee!). Plus, she's actually taller than I am. (I know. I'm 5'1", and, according to the IMDb, she's 5'2". And, even sadder, I'm done growing.) &nbsp;Okay. Blogger is not letting me use the "enter" key to make another damn paragraph, so that's all for tonight.

       Just so you don't worry, Betty wasn't actually beat up by them, she was pretending to be Reverend Camden from  Seventh Heaven  and I just randomly remembered that and it cracked my face up.     &nbsp;   I went to the library today, but made the mistake of coming with Fake Sick, who looked around for two minutes and said, "I've looked everywhere. I can't find anything. Let's go." When I informed him that some people actually enjoy going to the library, he fell under a mild state of shock, which bought me another half-hour of time, but I just ended up checking out two CDs (Fountains of Wayne's  Welcome Interstate Managers  and  fold your hands, you walk like a peasant  by Belle and Sebastian)&nbsp;and two books  (The Outcasts of 19 Schuyler Place  by E.L. Konigsburg, a favorite writer of my childhood, and  Northanger Abbey  by Jane Austen) ,  sadly, so my mom's going to drop me off there for a few hours (read: from 9-5) one day this week. I also just got my books today, and I've started  The True and Outstanding Adventures of the Hunt Sisters , which is lovely and hilarious.     &nbsp;   Fake Sick finally bought Mario&nbsp;Kart, figuring that we're already up to half of the cost of it in rental fees, so he&nbsp;insists that he has to copy Betty Jean's memory card so he, essentially, beat the game. I think I'm going to call Betty Jean's&nbsp;lovely&nbsp;sister, Annie, and inform her of this in advance.     &nbsp;   Patricia Clarkson is now doing radio commercials for BMW,&nbsp;which is&nbsp;brilliant casting on their part. Who wouldn't want to buy a BMW if someone with as excellent a voice as Patricia Clarkson's does the commercials? It's very&nbsp;entrancing, and I wish I sounded like her, but I have a little-kid voice, much to my chagrin.&nbsp;&nbsp;My voice sounds very nice in my head, sort of smoky, and then it comes out and I sound like a nine-year-old. It's painful.     &nbsp;   I could use some coffee.

       Well, not completely alone, but alone enough for me to have license to complain about it. Basically, it's me, Angie, and Franny. BB, Betty Jean, and Diana are at Lake Owen, and Roy is in the process of moving.&nbsp; So I'm rather bored. I might go see  13 Going on 30  in the Budget sometime this week, by myself unless Miss Franny would like to accompany me. Sadly, I've never gone to the theater alone, but I've always wanted to.      &nbsp;   In case you haven't already heard, Diana's grandfather passed away this past week. If you pray, pray for her, and, if you don't, think nice thoughts for her and her well-being. She'll really appreciate it.      &nbsp;   I'm in the part of  The Lovely Bones  where I begin to hate everyone but Abigail, because she's the only one doing something interesting. I mean, it's not a good thing or a smart thing she's doing, but it's more than the moping and thinking everyone else is doing, so snaps for her.     &nbsp;   "Does anyone know where my  Better Homes and Gardens  went?" Ten words I never thought my mom would say, and, yet, she just did.

        I just got back from seeing  The Stepford Wives  with Angie. It was absolutely hilarious. I'm not saying it&nbsp;was an epic opus of a film, but it made me laugh a lot. "I used to work for AOL." "Oh, is that why your women are so slow?" Snerk.        &nbsp;   My mother arguably went insane today. She participated in a water fight against Michelle, using the bazooka squirt gun thingummy, and kicked butt, despite inevitably having "Crazy" tagged before her first name for all of time. (Important note: She'd had at least two margaritas-- "Fresh margs!"-- beforehand.)       &nbsp;   Diana's dad is being an ass, not directly to me,&nbsp;and I hate him for it nonetheless. Ugh. I'd say "Family sucks," but that just sounds wrong.

        Don't Screw with Susie       &nbsp;  Ugh. Peter Jackson is making the Lovely Bones movie after he finishes King Kong. Well, that's just stupid. If they hadn't bought the rights about four years ago, I'd make it myself, just to do a better job. I didn't even like the book that much, but I've always thought it would make a good movie, so here's some guidelines for Mr. Jackson and his "people":    &nbsp;  1. Do not cast Alexis Bledel as Susie. If you need to cast some 25-year-old-actress-who-looks-younger, cast Alison Lohman, who has actual talent and doesn't talk through her teeth.     &nbsp;  2. Do not play Buckley for sympathy points. That might be a worse offense than #1.     &nbsp;  3. You might have the most issues with this one, Petey: Do not try to make this some big, epic movie. It really, really shouldn't be turned into one of those.

          Bangs, Or Unsolicited Solicitations         &nbsp;   I just realized that, when I don't straighten my bangs, they get all Meryl Streep-not-channeling-Hilary Clinton-in- The Manchurian Candidate  like  urlLink in these pictures.         When I say I'm not hungry, that is what I actually mean, believe it or not. (No one will get that. It's mainly for my own benefit, so don't ask about it.)   &nbsp;  If unsolicited telemarketing is moderately illegal, why aren't pop-ups? I'm just wondering here. They're basically the World Wide Web's answer to telemarketing. I hate them both dearly.  &nbsp;  I am deeply in love with quoting SpongeBob Squarepants lately and I'm not sure why. "Liar, liar, plants for hire" and "Well, I'm sorry THAT didn't kill me" are completely abused in my world. As are "weesnaw" and "Besides, I have those checks with the little poodles on them!" I mean, there's so many. I just made an enormous Fametracker post of all the ones I abuse. It's insanity.&nbsp;

       I bought "The Dogs of Babel" and "The True and Outstanding Adventures of the Hunt Sisters" used for uberinexpensive off Amazon.com today. Also, my mom is almost done wit h "Dress Your Family in Corduroy in Denim" (I couldn't help myself and&nbsp;have already&nbsp;read "Us and Them" and "Let it Snow".&nbsp;Whilst the book was sitting on the dining room table, of course. Both are excellent.)     &nbsp;  I finished "Eats, Shoots, and Leaves" a while ago. As a Grammar Nazi, I loved it, but I can see how non-grammarists would feel exactly the opposite. It's quite funny, although my&nbsp;family fears that Lynne Truss is a bad influence on me, since I now have actual evidence that their grammar is shit.     &nbsp;  Those are the only interesting things I have to say, sadly. Unless you want to hear about what went wrong with my new haircut, &nbsp;Fake Sick being a spaz in the car, and why doesn't LiveJournal let you have 1,000 userpics like Greatest Journal does, but, good Christ, I'm sparing you from those.

        Oh, wow. I guess my techno posting works now.      &nbsp;  Sorry about the rampant template-changing. I don't know if I'll be able to get the tagboard and/or links back, sadly. The last template got old, so I changed it to the one you are very likely currently seeing, but that doesn't seem to want to work, so now we have a prettier one, which should show up eventually.    &nbsp;  I think I have a bum knee.    &nbsp;  Me: I'm going to order some books used off Amazon tomorrow, okay?   Mom: But... what if they're missing pages?   Me: What if they're dog-eared?   Mom: (in a very dramatic voice) What if... they were peed on?    (I spit water all over the kitchen floor.)    Mom: No, really. Is there, like, a not-peed-on guarantee? We should e-mail Amazon and ask.

       Tijuana Donkey Parades: Quotes from H-Ville   First off, I have to say that we completely abused, "He nice, the Jesus. He die on two... morsels of wood for us" this weekend, and we have David Sedaris to thank for that. But, other than that:   Diana, on what her mother said when she broke a nail : (whispery voice) "Damn! I f*cked it up!"    Diana, on Hoggie, her dog : I just want to beat him to death!  (The next two are from our rabid Taboo session, which DI AND I KICKED ASS AT!)   Di's Mom : I used to be one of these.  Betty Jean : Um, a cheerleader?    Di : They have a lot of these, down in the place with the caliente food.   Me, thinking that "caliente" is the same thing as "Cajun" : Um, bayous?  Di : No! Lower!  Me : Tijuana donkey parades?  And, can I just say that I completely didn't see Annia Hatch coming? Holy frick, that came out of nowhere. But I shouldn't talk. I wasn't at Camp Karolyi, and my gymnastics critiques go as far as "That was pretty" or "That was ugly as sin". And, BB is right: Chellsie Memmel's bars are awesome, so why is she only an alternate? Argh. Although I really enjoyed what I saw of Mohini Bhardwaj, also, and Carly Patterson. (I really have no right to talk about this, do I?)

       Ugh.   Since I couldn't fall asleep until almost six in the morning last night, I just woke up a few minutes before noon.  And I missed I Love the 90s last night, except for the very end of the replay of '91. Did I miss them talking about  Goodfellas , my favorite mob movie ever? I probably did. Oh, no. This cannot be good.   BB and Kathleen (another girl who goes to our school) both kicked ass at Nationals, so snaps for them.  I've just been informed that the Writers' Union at my high school consists of writing, eating, and drinking coffee. And you've just been informed that I'm joining it as soon as I can.

       Eventful Day.    Madre  (at the grocery store; on her cell phone): Which popsicles should I buy?  Me : I don't care, as long as they don't have chunks in them.  Madre : Well, how about these Edy's fruit bar things?  Me : Those have chunks. I just said no chunks. Popsicles, by definition, should not have chunks!  Madre : How about the ones that look like crayons?  Me : Do they have chunks?  Madre : I don't know. They're crayons.  It just goes on and on.  And, Diana's mom's crazy dreams, as described by Diana in our chat room about five seconds ago.:   Diana : okay my mom had a dream that she made milo into a cassorole, and she went to check on it and his head was still sticking out so she picked it up and he was purring  Me : HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA  Diana : and she stroked his head a bit and threw his head in the garbage  Me : HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA  Diana : oh, and while she was making it and chopping him up he was purring too  Me : I am laughing uncontrollably right now. HAHAHAHAHA. I am putting that in my blog.  And a hilarious picture of Teresa Heinz-Kerry, or, as Paul Bunyan is fond of calling her, That Ketchup Heiress Character:

       Pieces of Me. Snerkety snerk.   Since you've all been positively clamoring for them since my lovely description of my chin, hence the Ashlee Simpson reference, here are... gasp... pictures. Of me.      My hand. You all can feel free to debate over whether it is a poet's hand or a piano hand.      The exact file name of this picture is, "ooooh drama."      A ridiculous picture. I look like one of those horrible little girls from  thirteen .  I'm getting old and cynical. I just called people my own age "horrible little girls." So, anyway, feel free to tell me I'm gorgeous (or ugly-ass), tell me who my celebrity look-alikes are, whatever. I don't give a damn anymore. I'm old and cynical.

       "Bwimps are coow."   And here is my uberlong review of  The Station Agent .    Loved    At the top of my list, as always: Patricia Clarkson. She's just so fantastic at everything. And Olivia was such a well-written character. She made me cry.    Joe, alias The Very Handsome Bobby Cannavale. So sweet and funny. I loved the scene where he says grace: "... and for my dad, because he's driving me f*cking crazy."    Fin. I loved his conversations, or lack thereof with everyone.    Cleo and Emily. Michelle Williams is excellent, and Cleo is just such a sweet character.    All the little moments. The beef jerky scene and "walking the right of way." Fin and Olivia talking on the dock while Joe bitches about the lack of a garlic press. Everything.    The ending.    The hilarious, hilarious commentary, which nods to  A Streetcar Named Desire  on multiple instances by Bobby Cannavale. And vampires, and shirts, and lipstick or lack thereof. And all of them doing the little kid voices: "Be cawefuw." "Bwimps are coow." Heh.   All around, a new favorite movie of mine. I'd highly recommend it to anyone, even people I hate and wish they would keep their paws off my movies. (And my songs, for that matter. "Float On" has been stolen by the huddled masses and it's peeving me off.)

       Snaps for everyone who comments on this entry.    urlLink The re-vamped fiction blog  now has a small scene from my new screenplay posted on it, so check it out.  I'm going to review  The Terminal  and  The Station Agent , just because I have nothing more rewarding to do.    The Terminal    Loved    The trailer for  Anchorman . "I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE'RE YELLING ABOUT!!" Heh. Also, just for the fantabulous presence of Holly Hunter, the  Little Black Book  trailers.    Betty's opposition to the ending: "But he built her a Napoleon fountain!"    Stanley Tucci, one of my favorite actors for all of time. And Gupta was a very good character.     Liked    Catherine Zeta-Jones and Diego Luna both did a very nice job. Tom Hanks was his usual good self, but I still maintain that Tony Shalhoub would have been a kick-ass Viktor.     Just Okay    Most of the movie falls into this category.     Hated     The ending.    I'm going to publish this, and then write my review of  TSA , because it's just going to be one big long column of love and it will make this entry far too long.

       Awesome Amounts of Alliteration by Anxious Anchors Placed in Powerful Posts.   I keep forgetting to mention the craploads of icons up on  urlLink the LJ . There's a lot of them, and they're pretty good. Go take a looky-look, all right?   urlLink Yay for Charlotte Beene.  I will conveniently ignore the fact that Jason Alexander has done nothing but unadulterated shit since  Seinfeld  (::cough::KFC commercials::cough::).   "Please go to hell." --me, to my computer. As if being polite yet profinate is going to help. Then again, hitting my TV fixed the DVD sound fuzz issue, so you just don't know.   Posting pictures is fun, and Krispy Kremes are even more fun. And even more fun than that are pictures from Pieces of April of a Krispy Kreme with Patricia Clarkson saying a fantastically true line written by the brilliant Peter Hedges. Confused yet?      Jellyfishing is fun, too, though.

       Bored.   I am so bored at the moment. Betty Jean is coming over later, so we shall hang out and watch movies and do very little of substance.   This picture was the highlight of my day. I sent it to Diana. It cracks me up for no reason at all. Le sigh. Peach is the coolest fish in the tank, yo.      I've been writing, probably not a good thing to do when I'm bored, but I came up with a very good bit of dialogue out of nowhere. Most of you probably won't understand it, but basically, Virginia's in hysterics and Jack's trying to calm her down. And it's just a randomly good one-line assessment that explains Virginia so well. Because she does make things more difficult for herself, really.   Virginia : Go to hell! Don't even try to help, because you have no idea how stressful it is to be me!  Jack : Well, it has to be! You just keep inventing your own stress.  Another highlight of my day that just popped into my head: "Oh, for god's sack."

       Argh.   Either Blogger or AOL is being insane, but whichever it was doesn't seem to be any longer. I felt so lonely without my blog.  I saw  The Terminal  today. It wasn't bad, it was cute, I might review it later if I have nothing else to say.    urlLink Angie  has some excellent poems up on her  urlLink poetry blog , so go read them. Episodes 1-4 is my favorite. It made me miss Angie. A lot.   BB and Di are both gone. Betty Jean and I had fun today, making fun of Ashlee Simpson with Annie and Julia (a nickname coined by Annie herself) and taking bogus teen-magazine quizzes. We all ended up being the anorexic Olsen, as opposed to the Other Morbidly Skinny One.   I'm going to review  The Station Agent  soon. It's a great movie, a new favorite of mine. Patricia Clarkson is amazing in it, as are all the other actors. But she made me cry, something I haven't done in a really long time, surprisingly. (Really long time- read: a few weeks. Which is quite a long time for someone as deeply emotional as I am. I really am emotional, I just fail to show it.)   I miss everyone so, so much. I'm in such a mood, and our lack of summer weather is helping very, very little. I bought things today, though. A lip gloss, nail polish (it was a set), a CD (the knockoff best of Blondie), and notebooks. And I bought myself  Story  by Robert McKee as a treat for myself.  I'm going to bed.   The Los Banditos Cartdriver Special doesn't microwave well. Whoever reads this, it's your duty to remind me of this the next time I mention microwaving a Cartdriver. (It's a Mexican spicy pasta dish thing.)   Good night.

       Nonetheless   I'm leaving for Madison to spend the weekend with my mother and her CrazyFriends. I'm not exactly sure if I'll be able to post or not, so if I don't post until Monday, that was my explanation.  I have determined that I don't photograph well and probably never will. The most recent picture I can think of liking is my school picture for last year, which didn't turn out half bad. Well, and I love the Jane Austen shot (which is a picture only Angie knows of), because, well, it's the Jane Austen shot. I've also determined I would photograph better if I was not always: moving, yapping, using my hands to show something, and if I didn't have braces (probably my first normal-teenager complaint on here: I hate my braces.) It's not that I'm horrendously ugly, because I'm really not. Odd-looking, maybe. I'm very, very fair-skinned, I have a large forehead, and my mouth is slightly crooked. Oh, my chin is pointy, too (I still hate my chin, Angie, I don't really give a toss if you like it anymore.) I mean, not Ashlee Simpson pointy, but pointy enough that I could use it as an ice pick if I truly wanted to do something of that nature.   I should really just shut up. I mean, I just read that and said, "who frelling cares?". Maybe I should just sit still and smile like a sane human being next time, Jesus.

       Dress Your Kitties in Corduroy and Denim   There is a shiny new copy of the shiny new David Sedaris book on the table next to me. I think it is Mummy's and, therefore, I'm trying very, very hard not to reach out and start reading it voraciously. It's causing me physical pain. Plus, I'm sure Vati will take it with him whilst he's gone for the next week, that bungler. Although I'm not sure if Vati really "gets" David Sedaris. It's not his sort of humor, really; so I'm going to guess it's Mummy's.   (Talking about Fake Sick's Camelback, a backpack drinking contraption:)  Vati : There was a kiddie (sounded exactly like "kitty") version inside of it, too.  Me : Kiddie, as in, cats? (Mummy and I crack up.)

       BB! In the Newspaper!   I'm going to copy this in. It's not my writing, it's from  urlLink this newspaper -- you can visit the site, but consider yourself warned, it's not much. (I've been in that newspaper for Irish dancing, but they just showed a picture of my feet. That might not have been mine. And, yes, I Irish dance.) It's about BB being the kick-assiest gymnast ever.  "[BB's real name], a 14-year-old and level 9 gymnast, will be making her fourth trip to nationals. A seven-year veteran of the gymnastics program, [BB] is looking forwared to this year's met more than past competitions because an injury caused her to miss last year's nationals.  "'It's really nice (being able to perform this year)," she said. "Last year, I broke my hand, so I couldn't compete. I just want to do my best.'   (Here, Cate feels urged to add that BB's best is the kick-assiest best she's ever seen, and she's just telling you this because BB's humble little self [tm  urlLink Angie ] won't. Anyway, continuing on:)  "[BB's mom, who we shall call Julie Andrews], [BB]'s mother, helps with different aspects of the program, such as running publicity and working as a representative for the upper levels.  "[Julie Andrews] says that the friendships on the team are one of the reasons the girls compete so well together.   "'They are really supportive of each other,' she said. 'They've known each other for so long.'"   Then, there is a very cool picture of BB kicking ass on bars. So, BB, on behalf of the Mr. Wilcox, I am Demented team (which is only me, but whatever), we would like to say: Good luck and kick all the ass you can.   And, on a less uplifting note, BB, you can come pick up  Return to Me  whenever you want.

      I was on the phone with my good friend Nermel today. Nermel is hilarious, as is her mother, Dr. Sick Genius. I talk on the phone with Nermel a lot, but I do not see her as often as I would like, which is why this is probably the first time she's been mentioned on here.  Nermel: Did Joan Cusack and Jack Black get together at the end of  School of Rock ? Me: No. At least I don't think so. That would be painful for Joan. Nermel: I don't get it. Me: Go ask your mom then, hon. (This part is all overheard by Radar Ear Cate:) Nermel: Hey, Mom, why would it be painful for her? Dr. Sick Genius: Because it's all fun and games until someone skinny has to sleep with a fat, hairy man! (Nermel comes back to the phone.) Nermel: Oh, I get it. She might suffocate or something. (Insane Cate-cackling.)

      Okay, I'm posting this, and yeah, you're supposed to be honest, but if you say anything mean, I'm in a bad mood and I'm going to chew you out. Just a warning. Basically, answer the questions in comments and be nice or I'll tell you off, okay? As I said, I'm crabby and I'm not in the mood for honesty as long as it's nice. If you need to be mean, leave the damn question blank because I have no patience for that.  Who are you? Are we friends? When and how did we meet? How have I affected you? What do you think of me? What's the fondest memory you have of me? How long do you think we will be friends? Do you love me? Do you have a crush on me? Would you kiss me? Would you hug me? Emotionally, what stands out? Do you wish I was cooler? Give me a nickname and explain why you picked it. Am I lovable?How long have you known me? Describe me in one word. What was your first impression? Do you still think that way about me now? What do you think my weakness is? Do you think I'll get married? What makes me happy?What makes me sad? What reminds you of me? If you could give me anything what would it be?How well do you know me?When's the last time you saw me? Ever wanted to tell me something but couldn't? Do you think I could kill someone? Are you going to put this on your blog and see what I say about you?

      Di and I were reading my H-ville essay, and we realized I had forgotten the Trojan man story, which is as hilarious as it sounds, trust me. Di's brother, who is very thin due to his hyperspeed metabolism, decided to play high school football ("Bad idea to begin with." --Di) and the name of his team was, unfortunately, the Trojans. When Di's mom dropped him off for his first practice during freshman year, and as he's walking to the field, still in earshot but not close enough for him to be able to maul Di's madre, Di's madre yells out the window, "There goes my  little Trojan man! " And then he just blushed and gave her the finger and a dirty look and kept walking. (It occurs to me that Hville is moderately like  urlLink Chao Camp  for good little teenage girls. Except, you know, with a trampoline.)  Also, go check out  urlLink the fiction blog  for bits of 'Love is Nothing'.

      I know I haven't posted much lately, but I was gone for the weekend and had to babysit on Monday (for most of the day, but I made money, so whatever), so this is pretty much the first chance I had to post. So I'm recapping the H-Ville trip now with me, BB, Diana/Nana, and Franny B. And we met the infamous Beloved Aunt Cheryl! And we sang "Leavin' on a Jet Plane" in the car, and now I'm forbidden from getting Beloved Aunt Cheryl started on old songs, according to Di.   Franny:  Get your feet off my blankets!   Me:  Do you think it would be better if BB's head was balls? (Long pause.)  Diana's Mom:  What kind of balls?   Hey it's Franklin:  (We're watching the  Lizzie McGuire Movie  to make fun of it, and right before the "hey now" part of that song she sings at the end, Franklin goes:) Hey now.   Hey it's Franklin:  Shhhh, Diana, I want to see the good parts!  Di:  You're sleazy.   Di:  Hey, Franklin, can I have some money for gum?  Franklin:  No! I just put thirty-one dollars on your card, you can use that. Do you have your card?  Di:  I love you, Frank.  Franklin:  Diana. What are people who give love for money called?  BB and I:  Whores!  Di:  Give me money, bitch!  Franklin:  No, Diana, use your card.  Di:  Come on, f*cker! (I am not making this up. And Franklin did not even care.)   Di:  I used to think it was Franklin Delanor Roosevelt. Because 'Delano' was so weird.  Me:  And Delanor wasn't?   Franklin:  (going through the McDonald's drive through) What kinds of pie do you have today?   Di:  (After Franklin went back and fixed BB's order, which was right.) No, Frank, she's not okay. She's crying. Because she doesn't have her cheese.

      Got my schedule at BoringTransitions today. The only good thing about it being that: a) I am a lucky bitch with last-hour study hall, b) I have the same gym and algebra as Diana, c) I have the same lunch as Diana, BB, Frances, and Betty, and d) I have English with Betty. But selection "d" is only partially good, because we're stuck with The English Teacher We Did Not Want. And I might be transferring out, which might sound really snotty and whatever of me and my parents, but the thing is that English is my best subject, and with what I want to do, colleges will look at my English grade more than any other one, and I won't cooperate well with a teacher who sits up there and LECTURES FOR THE WHOLE DAMN CLASS and ALLOWS NO INTERESTING DISCUSSION. (And that's coming from another teacher.) So, yeah, I'm snotty and stuck-up, whatever, I want to write my ass off when I grow up, thank you, shut up, have a nice day. And if I can't, I guess I'm just going to have to work my ass off in order to kick everyone else's.  In case you couldn't tell, my Jane Craig genes have kicked in again. I'm trying to think of something else to say, but I might just have to watch the  West Wing  DVDs I borrowed from The Princess [Diana] and chill out first.

       Survey  Choose a band/artist, or, be indecisive like me, and just go with music you like. Answer the following questions using only song titles by above band/artist. I'm ignoring five and six and eleven since I'm very romantically detached, but you can find the full survey over at Angie's. 1. Are you male or female: 'Just a Girl' by No Doubt 2. Describe yourself: 'I Was Meant for the Stage' by the Decemberists 3. How do some people describe you?: 'God Only Knows' by the Beach Boys 4. How do you feel about yourself?: 'I Think I'm Paranoid' by Garbage 5. Where are you?: 'A Place Called Home' by PJ Harvey 6. Where would you rather be?: 'Island in the Sun' by Weezer 7. Describe what you want to be: 'Paperback Writer' by the Beatles (not exactly, but close enough) 8. Describe how you live: 'A Life Less Ordinary' by Ash 9. Share a few words of wisdom: 'Love Will Tear us Apart" by Joy Division   Boring 'Transitions' Shit  Basically, Transitions is like an extended orienteering with long boring speeches by teachers we will not have until eleventh grade. Of course, we are just bursting at the gills with fun. Well, we were when Di fell into gales upon laughter to find out that Betty is a Future Band Geek, but that's about it. Straight A's to get into any good college, of course.  Someone is at the door shilling a religion, so I'm going to go.
