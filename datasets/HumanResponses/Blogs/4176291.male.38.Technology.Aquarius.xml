       The Sudan has been rocked by bloody civil wars for most of it's history, at least dating to it's independence in 1956. The present conflict in the Sudan is the longest running conflict in the world, an ongoing humanitarian disaster that has progressed unimpeded for about 23 years. So why the sudden interest in the Sudan?  I'm beginning to suspect that Sudan has been on the back burner for quite a while. Judging by  urlLink this article  in May, 2001, I believe it was approaching the front burner, until events led us off in a different direction. Would it be too cynical of me to suggest that we had bigger pipelines to seize? In the meantime, the US has at varying times played both good cop and bad cop in it's dealing's with the Sudan. From imposing sanctions, to lifting sanctions, to creating loopholes in the sanctions, etc. Most recently, despite the fact that the government in Sudan reacted "unfavorably" to the Sudan Peace Act passed by the US Congress in October 2002, President Bush, in April 2004, despite the overwhelming humanitarian crisis, refused to impose the sanctions threatened under the Sudan Peace Act, citing a strategy aimed at speeding along the peace process.  On the news front, I have difficulty finding anything making the corporate press about the Sudan until around late June, articles such as  urlLink this one , when I first see a few rumblings from Secretary of State Powell, and almost simultaneously Condoleeza Rice, National Security Advisor. Interestingly, late June is about the time the US handed over sovereignty of Iraq.   The Sudan is probably not at the forefront of most people's minds. But it soon will be. The original trickle of news on the Sudan in late June has turned into a steady stream as the corporate media certainly has been issued it's orders by now. It's only a matter of time before the media shock troops (Hannity, Coulter, Limbaugh) start weighing in. And even the most die hard of liberals will get sucked into the 'humanitarian cause".   Here's your long-shot for the October Surprise. With overwhelming bi-partisan support for the "humanitarian cause", the US enlists the help of the UN to restore peace to the Sudan, and heads up a peacekeeping mission, with the first of our troops hitting the ground in mid to late September. The overwhelming support for this "humanitarian cause", both here and abroad, obliterates the memories of Iraq and propels Bush to re-election.  I'm working on "Sudan 101", a brief primer on the recent history of the Sudan, and hope to have it posted on the over at brotherspeak in the next few days.

       The newest page is up at brotherspeak.com. The site is still a work in progress     urlLink Support Our Troops    I'm still working on the Enron page, taking much longer than I thought, it's certainly a bigger mess than even I imagined.    Will be back later with some festering thoughts on the Sudan. Stay tuned.

      I was working on a piece about the Enron scandal, which I hope to have finished later today, when during my research I ran across this article at the Motley Fool. I think it is a very good read about the influence of money on politics.   urlLink http://www.fool.com/news/foth/2002/foth020930.htm?source=EDNWFH   Of course, we can write all the articles we want, and nothing will change. It is up to the American people to hold it's leaders accountable to the governed, and to force the complete removal of corporate money from the political process. Up to now, it seems the American people have more important things on their minds than democracy.

      Nature instills in all man a natural hope. Even when things look their bleakest, it is instinct to hope for better. But what if there were no hope? What if what we believed in so dearly, in this case democracy, turned out to be nothing more than an elaborate hoax? Most, I believe, are naturally unwilling to let go of their grip on hope. It is just as unnatural to let go of your belief in a system or way of life. It is easier to live the fullness of the lie than to face the bleakness of reality. With the lie you have something to believe in. And with the lie, you continue to feed the machine. Just because they tell you that you have democracy does not make it so. Simply putting two names on a ballot does not give you a choice. If both names answer to the same master, was there really a choice? I have not lost all hope. While I no longer believe that the left is better than the right, or that they are even different, I do retain the hope that the American people will pull their collective heads out of their asses, because they have taken democracy for granted for far too long. If you have not read George Orwell's 1984, please do.

      There is no exit strategy for Iraq. This should not come as a surprise, if you follow the mad ramblings of the zealots over at PNAC. ( urlLink http://www.newamericancentury.org/ ) There was never the intention to have an exit strategy. Instead, there was meant to be a military force in the region in perpetuity. And as such, I don't believe there was ever the intent to build a lot of support for our cause there, and to bring in extensive numbers of "allies". Bringing in "allies" would reduce our need to keep troops in the region, which would certainly run counter to the stated objectives of PNAC. Now, if we examine recent statements by Kerry, we see where he has a plan to reduce our forces in Iraq by the end of his first term. So where is his strategy any different than that of the the Shrub? It's really an amazing feat of newspeak, and both the incumbent and the challenger have basicly said the same things. They want to enlist help from other countries (who they know are too pissed to help us), they want to bring the troops home as quickly as possible, but the jobs not done, so plan to be there at least through the next presidential term. And I am sure that even that timeframe will change to "the extendable future". While they do a great little dance with the charade we call democracy, the semantics of their plans aside, the results will be the same. I am sure in the interim we will hear a lot, especially on the Fox Neocon Channel, about how Bush's "vision" is so much better than Kerry's "plan". And in some circles the argument will be vice versa. But when you wade through the muck of newspeak, you can see that both have subtly left us with the impression that we are going to be there awhile. And realistically, there are just too many good reasons to stay. All those reconstruction contracts, not to mention the oil, and the chance to intimidate and threaten other would be rogues in the neighborhood. Much like Bush, Kerry's fate will be decided by the millionaires and billionaires he serves, and cutting them off from the reconstruction contracts and the oil is not in the cards. Here's the link to Kerry's brotherspeak on the issue -  urlLink http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-kerryiraq9aug09,1,7671568.story?coll=la-headlines-nation

      The below article is scary. And do you know what really makes it scary? It was printed in a conservative publication.   urlLink http://www.amconmag.com/12_15_03/feature.html   And how far over the edge does a government have to go to get the following quote out of Pat Robertson?  "The Conservative movement has been hijacked and turned into a globalist, interventionist, open borders ideology, which is not the conservative movement I grew up with?"  So those in charge at the moment have scared the piss out of Pat Robertson. (If the irreverent reverend FLAWell starts quivering, I'll take that as one of the signs of the apocolypse.)  What is so troubling is the lengths at which the authorities are now going. It is one thing to ignore dissent, or to ridicule dissent. It is another thing altogether when the authorities will use draconian measures to stomp out dissent altogether. The images from the recent DNC in Boston, where protestors were rounded up into razor wired containment areas well away from the conventioneers were reminiscant of pictures of the internees at Guatanamo Bay, the ethnic prisoners in the Balkans, and yes, even of the Holocaust (did I mention I prefer the Patriot Act when read in it's original German? Inspiring.).  We have become political prisoners in our own countries, telling ourselves we still have democracy, yet opposing points of view are frowned upon, ridiculed, shamed, and threatened. Open debate is no longer permissable, and attempts at starting a dialogue are met with reactions such as "Go Fuck Yourself".  urlLink http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A3699-2004Jun24.html   But of course, the royal court demands an apology when someone utters profanity in their direction, as well intentioned as it might be.  urlLink http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/1036304/posts   So we know both sides can use profanity, though those sitting on the throne at the moment might resort to a beheading or two.  And they'll both have razor wires pens outside of their national conventions. And they'll both sling arrows at each other as they play along with the charade we call democracy. But when the votes are counted, or not counted as the case may be, did you really have a choice? Do you really think either millionairre has your interests at heart?

      Free Speech Zones? For too long I ignored the truth about the political process in this country. But events of the last four years have permanently altered my perception. But much more than my perception changing, my voice has changed. While my perception has changed over time, the final straw to set me into trying to accurately portray the charade we call democracy is the creation of Free Speech Zones. I love the terminology. And it's so easy to see the terminolgy written into the First Amendment. My guess is it took the Ministry of Truth about 20 seconds to re-write that amendment. Could you have imagined our history for the last 230 years if King George had just implemented Free Speech Zones? It certainly would have avoided that ugly Boston Tea Party scene. I want to take my country back, and restore democracy for future generations. And despite my inclination to believe that most Americans are too fat, dumb, and lazy to actually question the process, I must make the effort. For democracy is a beautiful thing, but like any other form of government, it is easily perverted and manipulated by the wealthy and powerful. Certainly I will be labeled as seditous, traiterous, an extremist, etc. Because I will not believe the spin doctors and the frigid pawns of the tyrannical, I will be, in thier eyes, committing Thought Crime. I will be the enemy of the right, and the enemy of the left, but most of all, I will be the enemy of those that hold keys to the tyranny that is to be subjected upon the unquestioning masses. I will not let lies and deceit continue to go unnoticed, and unquestioned, and unpunished.  There is nothing in Room 101 that can scare me, because the death roll of democracy in the jaws of the powerful is more damaging to my soul than any physical pain or mental anguish they could subject me to. I think for myself.  I love my country.  I love democracy. I love freedom.  I am their enemy.

       The way this whole Swift Boat issue has taken legs as a campaign issue is rather disgusting. But rather than getting into the debate over a meaningless issue, I want to look at the root causes and effects of dirty politics. For those looking for an in-depth look at the Swift Boat issue,  urlLink here is a link .  It is said that money is the root of all evil. You need no better example of this than the effect that money has on politics. The amount of money involved in campaigns for national office is mind boggling, and the source of a great deal of this money is corporations and wealthy private donors. The amount of money donated to campaigns by the middle class worker is basically inconsequential. Campaign finance reform has been a popular political issue for more than a century, but despite the best efforts of many who have championed this cause, there has been little change for the good and a great deal of change that has made the influence of corporate money even worse.   Looking specifically at the corporate money being spent in this falls presidential campaign is very enlightening to those of us who understand how the Oligarchy controls the politics of this country, and thus controls this country. Let's look specifically at the top contributors to this years presidential candidates. Using the latest figures from  urlLink OpenSecrets , we find that 6 companies show up in the top 20 list of contributors for BOTH candidates. The six companies which have donated heavily to both candidates are: Morgan Stanley, UBS Americas, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Bank of America, and Microsoft. Now, of these 6 companies who are donating heavily to both candidates, how many do you think have your best interests at heart?  If you were to break down each candidate by the amount of money donated by industry, you get some interesting comparisons. Lawyers and Law firms are the leading industry donating to Kerry, the second leading industry donating to Bush. Securities companies are the 4th leading donor industry to Kerry, the 4th leading donor industry to Bush as well. Health professionals (doctors and their organizations) are the 6th leading industry donating to Kerry, the 6th leading industry donating to Bush. Miscellaneous Financial companies are the 7th leading donor by industry to Bush, the 13th leading donor by industry to Kerry. Commercial Banks are the 16th leading donor by industry to Kerry, the 10th leading donor by industry to Bush. Again, how many of these industries do you think are looking out for your interests?  In the end, you have no choice. Both candidates are controlled by the Oligarchy. The Oligarchs do not have the best interests of the people at heart. The candidates themselves are beholden to the Oligarchs. Democracy at this point is nothing more than a charade. The enormous amounts of money spent is not meant to elect one candidate or another, it is meant to dull the senses of the average short-sighted American, who is cleverly deceived into thinking the Swift Boat issue actually means something. And this process is repeated over and over at every level. Issues that mean nothing, mud slinging, name calling, labeling. Divisive politics meant to divide the people and divert their attention from the man behind the curtain. Wake up Toto, your not in America anymore.   (Definition from  urlLink Wikipedia .  Oligarchy  is a form of government where most political power effectively rests with a small segment of society (typically the most powerful, whether by wealth, military strength, ruthlessness, or political influence). The word  oligarchy  is from the Greek for "few" and "rule". Many political theorists have argued that all societies are inevitably oligarchies no matter the supposed political system.)

      Paula Jones' former lawyer, columnist, writer, author, and psychopath. To the enlightened, she is merely a subpar caricature of a reactionary extremist. It might be easy to dismiss her rants as the culmination of intellectual dwarfism meets menopause. Unfortunately, to the more easily fooled reactionary lemmings, she is a demi-goddess, and her bile filled diatribes are gospel. And this is what makes her dangerous.  How anyone can take Ann Coulter seriously is probably more a question for the psychiatric community than for sociologists. But the fact that a small extremely radical faction does take her seriously is not the most troubling thing. More troubling is that she is given the venue to spill her venomous dung. Simple common decency by channels such as FOX should determine that her brand of radical, racist, hate filled, factually inaccurate commentary never be given life in a mainstream format. But no one has ever accused the the FOX Neo-Con Channel of common decency, nor factual reporting for that matter.  Ann has spewed forth racial hate on a daily basis for the better part of her public life. A small sampling of her most hateful portrayal of non-white races include:  "To get into university without achievement or grades, you wanna have a name like Shafiqua, Jeffrika or Leroy," says Ann, who is not a fan of racial quotas.  "We should invade their countries, kill their leaders and convert them to Christianity."  No one has ever questioned Ann's blatant racism, certainly not the corporate media she works for, or the small but extremely radical portion of the population to whom she preaches. Many others have lost their jobs in the media for much less. Jimmy The Greek Snyder, a regular on the NFL Today on CBS during the 70's and 80's, was run off the air for a drunken comment he made in a restaurant, where only a handful of people could have heard it, and to Jimmy's credit, while the remark hinted of racism, at least part of it was factually accurate. Ann makes no attempt at factual accuracy.  When it comes to factual accuracy and what most non-psychopaths normally refer to as reality, Ann makes no attempt to approach either. In one recent example from Ann, we get the following pathological lie ,  So far, we have found chemical and biological weapons  brucella and Congo-Crimean hemorrhagic fever, ricin, sarin, aflatoxin  and long-range missiles in Iraq. -May 26, 2004.  Do I even need to comment? Did any of the rest of us miss the fact that every member of the administration has not even mentioned WMD as the reason for going into Iraq in over a year, lest they relive the obvious embarrassment of their criminal actions? But in Ann's world, ahh, all is bliss as long as she can continue to manufacture untruths to justify killing anyone that is not white.  Ann's blatant hatred extends to anyone whom does not share her extreme radical ideology. And Ann's ideology is hate. In it's purest form. Ann will bully, twist, and lie to get her point across, and it does not matter how far from reality her point is. And in those rare moments when she can not quickly come up with some distorted facts to make her point, she resorts to the childish art of name calling. I think the obvious point to be made here is that it is not worth even engaging someone in debate if the best that particular opponent can offer in exchange is name calling. But then again, Ann is not actually inviting anyone her to debate her. A lawyer by training, she knows that if she can just plant her lies with the jury often enough, the lie soon becomes perceived as fact. Most in the political arena have mastered this art to one degree or another. Ann takes it to it's pathological extreme.  Ann has become a darling of the corporate media. She has free reign to spill her bile onto the unsuspecting public. She is undoubtedly the most divisive personality to be involved in political commentary in this country. And someone so divisive is actually what the corporate media needs as they march forward with their agenda to subvert democracy. Divide and conquer. The more divided the American people, the better it is for the corporate media, and ultimately, those pulling the strings of the corporate media. It doesn't matter if you love Ann or loathe Ann. As long as Ann divides, she serves her purpose.
