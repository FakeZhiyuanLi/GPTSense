      24 June  2004 : 11.00pm : Thursday  I was having a comfortable sleep. Snuggling in side my duvet and being lazy. Semester break just started and life is great.  Woke up went out side just want to check out the weather.  Oh! What a perfect day.  Hang out side for a moment before taking a shower.  I notice a flat mate has waked up.    She took a shower. About 1 hour later, another flat woke up and wanting to take a shower. Suddenly, she said, no water. There is no water in the house. I was like ahhhhhhhh. I haven’t brush my teeth yetttt. Cam ne nak makan????   So nasib baik ade extra mineral water in my room. I used it to brush my teeth and wash my face.  Had my late breakfast. Lepak untuk 4 pm. Still no water. I notice the dishes is paling up. Some of my flat mate had to go the big one but tak boleh coz there is no waterrrrrrr.  We waited sampai malam. Still no water. I had to go to my friends house just to take a shower and did the big one!!! U know what I mean. But then, I malas nak balik umah. Coz takut tak de air.  So I tido there for one nite. Esok, I was happy coz, ade air at my friends place. Took a shower blah blah. And about 1pm  I balik.   Still no water. I was hungry for water. Dishes was growing like a monster. Clothing paling like garabage. Ahhhhhh my head was so messed up. I don’t want to stay at home. I hate it. One of my flat mate had to go to the comp lab just to did the big one. Kesian die. Kul 4 pm baru a plummer dtg… he said the neighbor turn of the water with out noticing our water pipe was connected with the house. I was pissed off. But lega coz we got our water back for the week end.  Tapi, bengang sangat coz.. we had to live with out water for 2 dayyys. And it felt like 2 yearrrssss. glad we got water know.

      22 June 2004 : 4 8.30am : 31 Harrison Street  A funny thing happened early morning today.  Have u ever had friends, which they are having conflict with each other? Having u stuck in the middle confuse and don’t know what to do?  Well, it’s happening to me right know. …. Since I move into this house everything has been like sittz.  Mostly about “mengumpat”.  Tuhan dah kater. Tak elok mengungpat. Tapi kiter sebagai manusia yang hatinye senang tergoda dengan dugaan saitan kiter pun “Mengumpat” jugak. I don’t remember what start this sitzz. Who started it or why we even bother about it.    Anyways, what happened was there is A and there is B. A hate’s B. coz B likes to talks behind people’s back, lazy, thinks she is the best and never likes to agree with people but when confronted, B never admits what had happened was not her doing.  A on the other hand likes to make B uncomfortable coz B like to play the innocent person.  A being a real B***CH. Makes everybody sees that A is the predator and B is the victim. Me on the other hand stuck between 2 friends.   But then B don’t really trust me coz, I have known A longer then B. A on the other hand hates it when I don’t agree with her at times. Anyways, the funny thing happened was, these 2 got into a loud catfight. I was shocked surprise stund whatever u name it. Pagi2x buta dorg dah bertekak. Sorg cakap cam nie  and lagi sorg cakap cam nie. Dua2x tak betul. how do I fix this messed? This stupid problem which includes me. Coz I pun terlibat dgn mengumpat nie.  I call them to sit my room so they can talk but it. Everybody had involved with this mengumpat. Not just me not just A or B. what mean is semua salah.  But A and B just coundn’t agreee with what ever sitzzz  they had and they just couldn’t get along.  I got really upset and I felt I don’t know what to do and how to solve the problem.  But I feel I had manage to calm down the conflict that was happening. I guess that was okay. Better then nothing  Still, I guess A will never be friends again with B and I guess it goes the same way with B.  I wish them well. Hope they’ll be happy in their live without each other, it might be for their own good.  Maybe it’s just “naluri’ that they can never be an understanding friend’s coz how much they change or how much they try to understand the other person. They just can’t get along.  I pray for them. May peace be with them always………..chowww~~~~~~~~~~~

      19 June 2004 : Student Flat : 3:00pm  Why? Fucked up people are so fucked up? How do I handle this kind of people? When do I know how to trust a friend? Who is my friend? Some times I feel FUCKED UP by stupid childish people! Who are ignorant, immature, selfish, bossy, suspicious……… …….  I suppose I have part of those negative attitudes but I try not to make people feel fucked up.  Sometimes you just feel so fucked up, u just end up in a fucking mess. Sorry for my rude language.  Why !!! me why do I have to stand between 2 groups of friends that is so BUSUK HATI with each other? I don’t like to be hated and I don’t like to hate another. What  I am saying is that I don’t hate people but when u hate someone bertempat ahhhh. Jangan ahh bersepah sane sini… mengumpat sana mengumpat sini samapi u can not fix the fucking problemmm!!! I do admit that I mengumpat if I feel disappointed with that person but I don’t go tell everybody that has nothing to do with the fucking problem. It will make the problem worseeeee. Arrghhhh bodohh betulll.  I’m still hating my situation with friends here.  I just don’t understand them.  I can’t afford to have an enemy.  It’s a small town and we are in the same reason. Study for our future and become successful.  Please someone just help me!! So I can  get out of this mess and start a new life with couple of new people. I’m  kinda feedup looking at the same problem and childish solution.  But then, I’m glad that I can know that someone out there I can trust. Some one that listen to me and understand me and even went to trough the same problem, I had.  Well, I suppose this is the bitterness of life. I just feel disappointed today. With people I just met.  I want to say thanks to my friend freakin instict that gave me helpful adviseee on what to do. I’m so gladddddd u are there with me. Even though u r far, tapi dekat di hati.  Thank youu babeee.    Okay ahh more about my emotional feelings when I am free. Cheerssssss~~~~~~~~~

      i've been experimenting with picutres. wanted play around with lights and see what i could get.  yup, this the best picturee of all. it kinda define the house and us living in it. i'm flating with 4 other people. we don't do much activitiy with each other. most of us have personality that doen't fit one - another. so might as well, we do our own thingssss.   so what i can say, the house is secluded the people are seclutive. i am lonely =(  what'ca think about this picture????

      what am i doing right know? I am reading online and i am inspired by this photographyer - Andre Kertesz  A great photographer in the 20th century....  André Kertész was born in Budapest, Hungary in 1894.  He immigrated to Paris, France in 1925, then to the U.S. in 1936, where he became a citizen in 1944. Kertész died in New York in 1985.  He is known for his meditative still life’s, street photography that captures the "mysticism of the real".  His most popular images:  "Melancholic Tulip"      "Satiric Dancer, 1926"     Quote: “What I feel, I do."  i love his quote - short an simple.  like my professor used to say to us in class ----> K.I.S.S ( K eep  I t  S imple  S tupid)
