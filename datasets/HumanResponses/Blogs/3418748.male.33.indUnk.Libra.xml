         Ah Monday, not my favourite day of the week. Work had a few revelations today, and I learnt some important lessons...    There is no standard RS232   Sharp edges on things are sharp and may cut you   Trying to do a job that needs 2 hands in a hole big enough for one hand just doesn't work. Ever.    I realised today that I said I'd get back to playing football next month, but that that would stop me watching all of Euro 2004, d'oh!  Apart from all that, absolutely nothing has happened today. Maybe if I keep having days like this, I'll have to make something up. Maybe    Music : Faith No More Greatest hits thing still (due to idleness of not changing the CD) Reading : Monstrous Regiment by Terry Pratchett (Maybe I'll just list these things when they change...)

         Well 15 men anyway. 'Twas FA Cup Final day yesterday, Man Utd won, and man was it dull. I've never seen such a boring Cup final, and I now realise it's just not like it used to be. Let's have Wembley back, the stairs, the Queen giving the Cup over, and it being passed back down the line. Not all this wishy-washy in the middle of the pitch, everyone get their medals, the captain get the Cup from some practically nobody (it was Sven this time (and he's not even English, so what does he know), then have this big bun-fight as everyone trys to touch the cup. Grrrr. Wish it was us  urlLink (Saints)  again, but we've had an inconsistent season, and got knocked out of the cup in the third round (just like the good old days then, but at least it was a premiership team this time).  I've done a bit of research into the Light Brigade, and it would appear that it took place near Balaklava, on the black sea, in Crimea (thus the Crimean war). I also guess that Balaklava is wear we get the name for those lovely wooly face warmers from. Anyway, 600 men were ordered (somewhat erroneously) to charge the Russian guns. Only 195 came back. French general Bosquet, who watched the charge, famously remarked "c'est magnifique, mais ce n'est pas la guerre!" (it's magnificent, but it's not warfare).  The film, made in 1936, directed by Michael Curtiz, and starring Errol Flynn and Olivia De Havilland tells the story. I believe this is the one that my Grandfather was an extra in. Can't find anything about the extras though. Did find out that my Grandfather was a guardsman.  Saw my nephew today, he's filling out well, and looks more like my brother. Best part of my day :)   Music : Didn't listen to any today Reading : Still Monstrous Regiment by Terry Pratchett

        Having just finished reading "The Kraken Wakes" by  urlLink John Wyndham  , which has a poem by  urlLink Tennyson  in it (called "The Kraken") I became (slightly) interested in Tennyson, and Google'd to find more stuff by him. The title of this blog is a line from "The Kraken" BTW. Anyway, during my vague interest I found that Tennyson wrote a poem called  urlLink "The Charge of the Light Brigade" , which is interesting to me, as my Grandfather was in it - well the film anyway, as an extra. I intend to find out more about it (the charge, the film, my Grandfather and much more). I am feeling inspired today to rip myself into the 21st century (which is why I now have a blog), and make a new website, with interesting stuff (well interesting to me anyway).  Part of the inspiration comes from my friend, Richard, who went to New Zealand, and is now blogging using this blogger, to blog. Hello Richard, if you ever read this. I really must contact him again, and I can do via his  urlLink website  and  urlLink blog , which I will link on here somehow, when I've actually worked out how (which I just did already).  Ah, so many intentions, but I will do them all.   Music :  urlLink Faith No More  - greatest hits album thingy Reading : Monstrous Regiment -  urlLink Terry Pratchett  Football : End of season, but looking forward to  urlLink Euro 2004

         At last, a new update. I've not done one for ages, but here we are. I   finally finished reading Monstrous Regiment, it was very enjoyable indeed. But  now  I am reading  urlLink Dave  Gorman 's Googlewhack adventure. Follow the link and it'll  tell you  what a googlewhack, and just who Dave Gorman is. Basically it's  looking up two  words on Google and trying to  only get 1 hit, with words found in  dictionary.com.   Dave Gorman (DG) started his  adventure because he was a  Googlewhack, due to his previous adventure "Are you  Dave Gorman?". The book is  hilarious, the guy is hilarious. There's another  strange feature of a  Googlewhack (Gwhack), and that is, when one is found, and  people are told about it, if  they link to that Gwhack, then it is no longer a  Gwhack. I discovered this by  searching for the first Gwhack that DG found, and  it was no longer a Gwhack.  It probably says something deep and meaningful about  the web and life, the  universe and all that - but I don't know what.  I've also stopped listening to Faith No More for now, and have Slipknot in my stereo instead. It's not quite what I expected it to be, but is good none-the-less.   Got my new Sony Ericsson T610 mobile phone this week. Lovin' it. Got it to   bluetooth to my PC too. I should be able to sort out email on it, and then post   to my blog from wherever I am. Nice.   I think that's all for today, until next time...
