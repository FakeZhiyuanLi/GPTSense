       &nbsp;&nbsp; Well, I'm not sure wut tooh say, I'm new on thyz site.&nbsp; My name iz&nbsp;Kristina. I am 15 years old an I was born an raised in Mississippi.&nbsp; In tha past years I have lost over&nbsp;7 people in muh family,&nbsp;not includin tha one'z I didn't kno.&nbsp; &nbsp; Last October, my 15 year old cousin Dustin Louis Hoefler was killed instantly in a two vehicle accident. In our family, most of us teenagers are close in age. Every weekend on Sunday, my aunt would have cook out at her house till my uncle died&nbsp;last Feburary. All of us teens would chill wit each otha, play gamez, pool, swim, listen tooh music, or sumthyn lyke that. When muh ma told meh he got in an accident an didn't make it, I didn't believe it. If I hadn't seen him in his coffin, I styll wouldn't believe&nbsp;it tooh thyz day.So as yooh can c, muh lyfe haz been pretty&nbsp;rough. After he got killed, that&nbsp;made a&nbsp;big change in muh lyfe. Well, hea iz a lil bout tha problem.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  In the year of 1999, when I was about 10 years old, I made a choice that would change my life forever. Self mutilation was the one thing that came to my mind everytime I got upset. It all started five years ago, I got in trouble by my ma for something. I would go behind our couch an scratch my face till I bled. A few years later, I had a pocket knife. With that I started to cut myself on my left leg down by my&nbsp;ancle where it was invisiable to everyone. Then, in October of 2003, my 15 year old cousin got killed in a car accident an things just got worse. I would cry and pray to God, "Please take me out of this world. I am ready to come home an be with Dustin." I was very depressed. Before that, I had found a razor on the road in front of my house where my brother had droped it out of his car. I finally got it an hide it in my dresser in my room. When I got upset I would go in my room or bathroom, take out the razor, an cut my wrist. I would then put tape over it so no one could notice. There were many times when I would think of my cousin an want to be with him. I would cut myself an wish I was dead. When I cut myself I didn't think of my life an the future that lay ahead of me. I just wanted to die. When I did cut myself, I didn't feel any pain. It's like you got a hot potato, you cut it open an steam is released. Well, that's how it is with me. It releases all my anger an depression. After that, I feel better. It's not like I would wake up every morning an say, "I'm going to cut myself an try to kill myself today." It's nothing like that. It's something that just happens. Well, finally in March of 2004, I punched a girl in school. They sent me to the Youth Court Detention Center in Pascagoula for 3 days. I had to take an SI test there along with everybody else that gets sent there. My score was high. The lady that gave the test to me said, "Damn girl!" She called some guy from a Memorial Behaveriol Health place that helps people with their problems. He came there an talked to me. He also mentioned my cousin. I couldn't talk about him an I started to cry.Two days later when I got home my parent's told me I had to go to a Hospital called Pine Grove in Hattisburg. I stayed one night home then the next day they called an we were off to Pine Grove. That place didn't help me at all. They had people there for drugs, drinking, suicide, depression,anger, an ect. They say it is your own choice to stop, no one can help you. All they do is teach you coping skills. They put me on pills, but I would see stuff, so they took me of them. People may believe I did this for attention, but I didn't. I didn't want people to see or know what I did to myself. If I did do this for attention, then why did I hide it for so long? I finally decided I wanted help an I couldn't face my parent's to tell them what I did, so I got help in another way. I mean, we either got attention or we don't. If we don't got any then why would we want some now. There are other ways to show that we want attention. Now I am doing better. To this day I haven't picked up a knife or razor to cut myself. I have to see a councler every month. I thank God every day that he helped me through this an I am still alive. It is hard to look back in my past an see what I did an what my life was like. I now know that I have a whole future ahead of me along with my goals an dreams that I want to someday reach. I never knew cutting yourself was something major. I think about what I did everyday, I know that death is not the answer to my problems, it will just cause more problems upon others. Some people ask how can we cut ourself? It's not how we cut ourself, it's why? Everyone has their own problems an their ways of solving them. That was my way. I am very thankful for my family and friends who stuck by my side an helped me through this hard time. If it wasen't for all the love an support, there is no telling where I would be right now: in a coffin, Mental Instatute, or hospital...
