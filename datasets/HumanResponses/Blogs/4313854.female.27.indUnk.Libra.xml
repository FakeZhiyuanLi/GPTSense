       Just posted my first entry and surfed about to see what other people write about. Now I am slightly embarassed for bitching on the internet in the manner of an angst-ridden teenager. (Not that there's anything wrong with being a pissed off teenaged who likes to say "fuck" a lot. By all means, be my guest...)      Seems like everyone else in my situation is sleeping or screwing or tending to a howling infant at present. Makes me feel like a bit of a loser. I could entertain myself by describing one of the sanctimonious do-gooder ASSHOLES that drives me crazy on a regular basis...or I could lay in bed and read the 9/11 Report.       Eh, I'm going to bed... g'night digital world.

       Ah, the internet...where the sad, lonely and bitchy congregate in droves when they could be out scrapbooking, falling in love or starting fires...  Me? Completely normal if not a little grumpy by day, obsessive in a scratch a mosquito bite until it gushes blood and requires stitches kind of way by night. Not good, but I'm working on it. Maybe this diary will help. At any rate, I've got a lot of itches to scratch. (I'm prone to tangents so hang on, all of this shit comes full circle eventually.)  Most elements of my life are within a few millimeters of perfection. My husband is wonderful and thinks that celestial movements occur when I bat my eyelashes. I have a cute house. I have a 4.0 in graduate school and my career is promising...my truck is brand new, my hair naturally blonde, my toilet bowl minty fucking fresh. By all accounts, I have no right to bitch about anything, but I will anyway.  The thing is things bother me, almost every day in ways that I can't always explain. If you haven't already figured it out I don't exactly have a million friends hanging off my belt loops...more by choice than anything else (people think I'm funnier than shit but I don't feel like dragging the dead weight of friendship.) I just don't think anyone will really understand why compliments catch in my throat and friendly remarks come blasting out as sarcasm. If I do by chance end up in the presence of my peers, I have to carefully administer mental novocaine...if I imagine myself in the regular company of women wearing denim shirts with snowman appliques I might have to stick my head in an oven. No joke. I really prefer the presence of my husband or a more raw and uninhibited version of myself. Here's an example of why I don't go out much: My husband's brother's wife (sister-in-law? no, that makes her sound like a relative which she's NOT) had a kid last year. And MAAAN, did someone beat that kid with the ugly stick...hooo! Anyway, I asked the mother what the kid was going to be for Halloween, which brought about a big dumb smile and a bunch of blather about how she didn't know if he should be a pumpkin, or Winnie the Pooh, blah blah blah.... So I offered a suggestion of my own: the kid should get dressed up like a hot dog! Like with oversized buns on either side of him and maybe some yellow and red yarn to signify ketchup and mustard...cause after all the kid WAS all bright red and elongated... This, as you can imagine, brought about an awkward silence followed by snivelling (tear formation was apparent.) The worst part was that I couldn't stop laughing at my own joke....        So you see, that's the problem. I really am the Devil.
