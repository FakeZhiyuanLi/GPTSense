        urlLink     LUXEMBOURG CITY    Accomodations:   8  As far as hostels go in Luxembourg there is only one.  It's the HI hostel.  Since it's the only game in town, however, it's actually a pretty decent hostel.  The price is good, there is no curfew, and it's easy to meet people since everyone stays there.  Breakfast is also nice, with a choice of cereal, meats, cheeses, breads, and spreads.   Alcohol:   8  Nothing much to speak of as far as local beers go, but the good thing about being close to Belgium is that the bars all offer Belgian brews.  The prices are reasonable.    urlLink      Beauty:   9.5  Seriously, Luxembourg City is beautiful.  One of the most memorable images of Europe is when I was standing on top of the hill looking out over the old part of the city surrounded by the "U" shaped canal.  Gorgeous.   Attractions (Non-Artsy):   8  If you don't want to go to museums, there are still things to do in Luxembourg City.  One of the best is the Wenzler Walk.  Go to the tourist office to get a map for the walk.  There are different paths you can follow that take you all over the city and give you a really good feel for Luxembourg's past.  If you go in late August or early September, go to Schueberfouer, a huge carnival where all the locals congregate to eat, drink, and go on rides that look both exhilarating and nauseating (watch out for the broken glass all over the ground though).   Attractions (Artsy for the Non-Artsy):   5.5  If you're like me and art museums don't thrill you, then there's not really any need to check out anything here unless you've done everything else there is to do.   Nightlife:   7  The nightlife in Lux. City is pretty decent.  There are the typical bars where you can chill out and relax, and there are the more trendy nightclubs where you can dance the night away.  They are easy to find because there seems to be only one major area where people go at night.   Food (Cuisine):   6  Nothing special here.  Lux. pretty much copies French, Belgian, and German cuisine, and they don't do it as well as any of the places they are trying to emulate.   Food (Quick):   6.5  There is a McDonald's if need be, but most people eat baguette sandwiches that can be found pretty much everywhere.  The only problem is that they tend to be a little expensive compared to the rest of Western Europe.   Walkability:   9.5  Lux. City is very walkable.  There is no reason to ever take a bus or cab except when going to the train station.  If you don't walk Lux. City you might as well not go there.   People:   8  People are very friendly in Lux. City.  Most of them speak English and are happy to use it.  It's a small place, so the people have that "everyone knows everyone" kind of hominess quality about them (much like South Philly).   Romance:   8.5  If you want a place a little off the beaten path for a nice romantic day or two, then Lux. City is great.  It's charming, quaint, scenic, and distinctive.   Annoyance Factor:   7.5  I had to pay for the bathroom at McDonald's even though I purchased something.  Plus, ketchup or mayo for your fries costs extra.  Banks are closed on the weekends, so try to get there with euros in your pocket.  When sending a postcard, make sure to get the additional stamps to supplement the regular ones.   Reputation:   10  The fact that Lux. City remains relatively untalked about definitely helps it.  The first reaction I get whenever I tell someone I went to Luxembourg is, "why the hell did you go to Luxembourg?"  However, when people visit they are rarely disappointed, because they don't have the expectations created by the reputations of some of Europe's bigger, more famous cities.    urlLink      Warm Fuzzy Factor:   9  This is a totally biased opinion based on what I felt when I first started walking around the city.  Lux. City is a cozy place that made me feel welcome immediately.   Girls:   4  Not really much to look at in Luxembourg.  The tourists are generally more attractive and more approachable.   Public Transportation:   7.5  The buses are clean and on time (although a bit infrequent), the drivers speak english, and they will get you anywhere you need to go.  However, like I said, there really isn't much need to use them.   Trains:   5.5  When going to/from Belgium, France, or Germany you must use the services of that country's trains.  The comfort, frequency, and punctuality of the train will depend on the origin/destination.   Tourists:   8.5  They exist, but not in intolerable numbers.  I didn't have to push my way through crowds of people and I encountered more European tourists than English speaking ones.   Prices:   7  I found that most things that a backpacker needs are reasonably priced for a country that is so wealthy.  Food and alcohol aren't too expensive, and neither are the museums and attractions.  That isn't to say that they're cheap either.  It's just about average, but at least you won't feel like you've gotten ripped off most of the time.   Overall Likability:   9  I just really liked it here.  The scenery blew me away.  Two solid days here would be perfect.  I think that for anyone who has never been to Europe before, Luxembourg is a great place to start the trip.  Its size is not intimidating, the people are nice and speak English, and the hostel is dorm style and clean, so it allowed me to gradually get accustomed to life as a backpacker.   Final Score:   76.25

      The categories I've devised are the following:   Accomodations:   this is a rating based on the hotels/hostels I stayed at, plus the recommendations and opinions of other travelers about the places they stayed.   Alcohol:   i think this is pretty obvious.   Beauty:   also obvious, no?   Attractions (Non-Artsy):   things to do that don't involve the fine arts.   Attractions (Artsy for the Non-Artsy):   attractions that specifically have to do with fine art, but reviewed for people who don't really have much of an interest or appreciation in fine art, yet feel the need to try and be cultured anyway (only to often be disappointed).   Nightlife:   for night-owls like myself.   Food (Cuisine):   the quality of food that is culturally significant to a particular region.   Food (Quick):   the availablity of appetizing, inexpensive food that can be purchased quickly, and eaten while standing or on the go.   Walkability:   the ease and enjoyability of walking around the city.   People:   how friendly the inhabitants are, how helpful they choose to be, and how willing/able they are to speak english when necessary.   Romance:   tells whether a place is suited for two sickeningly happy lovebirds.   Annoyance Degree:   a totally biased opinion based on how annoyed I got by stupid little things.   Reputation:   the ability for a city to live up to its good reputation or, contrarily, to overcome the lack of one.   Warm Fuzzy/Holy Shit Factor:   again, a ridiculously biased category based solely upon the warm fuzzy feeling I got from being in the city and the number of times I stopped and thought "holy shit, I'm in (insert city here)!"   Girls:   are they pretty?  do they speak english?  and will they talk to foreign boys?   Public Transportation:   does the city provide comprehensive, cheap, and efficient public transportation?   Trains:   train travel both internally and internationally.   Tourists:   the amount of tourists and how obnoxious they are.   Prices:   a general guideline for how expensive things are.   Overall Likability:   one last unashamedly prejudiced score for how much I liked the city.    Final Score:    everything totalled and divided by two.

      Before I begin, this is a quick explanation of what this is and why I'm doing it.  I just took my first trip to Western Europe.  It was a two month excursion through thirteen countries.  It was the most incredible experience I've ever had, and I wish that more people had the desire and motivation to take a trip like this one.  I am writing this "guide," and I use that term loosely, partially because I want to help out anyone who is interested in going to Europe, and partially because I am bored and have way too much time on my hands.  Nothing can replace a professionally published travel guide such as the ones from Let's Go, Lonely Planet, and Rough Guides (especially not an incredibly biased one from yours truly).  They all give you essential advice about the preparations that are necessary both before and during your trip.  They are incredibly in depth and list a variety of good accomodations, restaurants/bars, and sights.  However, the one thing that no guide can do is cater to everyone's tastes.  I'm not a big art guy.  I don't know much about technique, or symbolism, or any of that stuff.  All I know is that some things I like to look at and others make me shrug my shoulders; and you know what?  I'm okay with that.  I'm not going to enjoy looking at Renaissance paintings.  I just don't care.  On the other hand, show me some mosaics, or Dali, or photography, and I'm fascinated.  The thing about these guides is that the people who write them are a bit more cultured than myself.  They make me feel guilty that I don't want to pay and to go to the Van Gogh museum by putting a big "thumbs up" symbol next to it.  So then I go and feel like I am wasting my time and, more importantly, my money.  So this is my attempt at the guiltless guide for the fun loving single guy who wants to do a little bit of everything, but whose priorities are a little less noble than the Harvard students who contribute to Let's Go.  I have attempted to separate each city into 20 categories.  Yes, I am absolutely insane, and like I said before I have much too much time.  I'm sure there are better ways of rating each city than in the categories and subcategories that I've devised, but this is the best I could do on my own.  If you have any suggestions, or anything to add, feel free to e-mail me and hopefully it will help make my reviews more comprehensive.  I will give a "final" score for each city, but that score doesn't mean all that much.  It's just there for people like me who feel the need to tally up points and rank things in some kind of neat list.  You will probably be better served by taking each rating into consideration individually because not every city has everything.  I'd rather go somewhere that has more contrast of good vs. poor qualities than a place that is average across the board, even though the average city may have a better overall score.  One other thing to keep in mind--a lot of these ratings are based on my own personal bias of things that interest me.  Make sure you read my descriptions so you get a feel for whether or not the information I give is of value to you.  That being said, let's get the show on the road.

        urlLink     BRUSSELS    Accomodations:   6.5  The are not many hostels to choose from in Brussels.  The ones that do exist are far from the main attractions in the heart of Brussels.  I was there during a beer festival (it seems like there is always a beer festival somewhere in Beligum) and all the hostels were full.  Luckily, I was able to find a three star hotel with one room left for 60 euros.    urlLink      Alcohol:   10  Right.  I was debating whether or not to give a score of 15, but I didn't want to go crazy.  In case you didn't know, Belgium makes the most (and best) different kinds of beer in the world.  There are over 300 varieties of beer made in Belgium, and over 1000 breweries.  That being said, the beer is really good, cheap, and high in alcohol content.  That's a winning combination in my book.    urlLink      Beauty:   7.5  Brussels is underrated and underappreciated.  Is it the most beautiful city in Europe?  No.  A lot of people don't like Brussels.  That's understandable.  It has an industrial feel to it at first.  But, after spending a few days there it starts to brighten up.  Grand Place is stunning, and was my favorite square in Europe.  The architecture is unique and gives the city an identity of its own.  Brussels' beauty cannot be compared to some of the major cities in Europe, but it shouldn't be dismissed either.    urlLink      Attractions (Non-Artsy):   6.5  The attractions in Brussels are few.  I found the best attraction was the walking tour I gave myself.  It wasn't until I walked a good portion of the city that I found a real appreciation for it.  The Atomium is a neat attraction to see.  It's a giant iron molecule magnified 150,000 times built for the Expo in 1958.  But, other than that, there really wasn't too much to do, unless I wanted to waste money going to Little Europe, a silly park with mini versions of famous places in Europe.  It's ok, I was really only in Brussels for one foamy reason...   Attractions (Artsy for the Non-Artsy):   6  If you don't know anything about art, then chances are you don't care much about Belgian art.  Especially with so much beer to drink and so many frites to eat.  The art museum in Brussels is supposed to be great, and the fact that I considered going is why I scored it a 6.  Oh well, I'm sure I missed some beautiful pieces of art work, but I don't lose sleep over it.   Nightlife:   8.5  Brussels is a fun town.  There is something for everyone.  There are chill pubs, hip singles spots, trendy nightclubs, and combinations of all three.  What looks like a simple Irish Pub on the outside may actually be a two story pub and dance club, where you can relax at a table and chat with people from all over the world, and then go dance the night away upstairs until five or six in the morning while enjoying the two for one beer specials.   Food (Cuisine):   8  Very good.  I had a great dinner for about $15.  It started with mussels, which are a must in Belgium.  Then a rabbit that was so good I couldn't believe it.  Throw in some ice cream and a free drink and you have a happy tourist.   Food (Quick):   10  The best in Europe.  Belgian Waffle stands line the street.  Go grab a warm, plain waffle for about $1.50.  It's the best you'll ever have, and incredibly filling.  Don't feel like a waffle?  Grab a cone of frites from one of the many places that sell them, or make the pilgrimmage to Place Jourdan to find the best fries you'll ever have in your life.  There are about 30 sauces to choose from.  Personally, I recommend the "special."  That's mayo, curry ketchup, and chopped onions.  Has to be tasted to be believed.  The only thing I don't recommend is stopping at a Quick.  It's the French equivalent of McDonald's.  Unless you like corn and zucchini and crap on your burger, stay away.   Walkability:   7.5  I wouldn't walk all of Brussels, and I don't think you could do it if you wanted to.  It's a large city, and one of the main attractions, the Atomium, is outside of walking distance.  That isn't to say that walking isn't enjoyable in Brussels.  Brussels is a cool city to walk through.  It's just a bit spread out to do all your sightseeing by foot.   People:   9  I met tons of cool people in Brussels.  Not only were the locals friendly, but I met people from all over the world.  Maybe that's because the European Union HQ is in town.  Whatever the reason, you're sure to meet some interesting people.   Romance:   3  Unless your idea of romance is getting wasted and scarfing down fries at 4 in the morning, Brussels isn't really meant for mushiness.  There is certainly a charm to the city, and I'm not saying you can't go with your significant other and have a ton of fun, but it's going to be a more active kind of fun.   Annoyance Factor:   9  Train stations in all of Belgium charge 30 cents to use the bathroom.   Reputation:   7  A lot of people I talked to who went to Brussels didn't like it.  That's understandable if a couple days of great beer and food aren't enough to keep you happy.  So, although I liked Brussels, I can't give it a higher score than 8 because it does a good job of living up to it's reputations, both positive and negative.     Warm Fuzzy Factor:   6.5  I didn't get the warm fuzzies when I first started checking out Brussels.  At first, it's a cold city, but eventually I warmed up to it a little.   Girls:   5  The girls in Brussels, well, they're OK.  Not much else to say.   Public Transportation:   7  The metro is not very extensive, but it gets you basically where you need to go.   Trains:   5  The trains in Belgium are not very comfortable.  They are usually on time, though.  But, really, not comfortable, seriously.   Tourists:   7.5  There are tourists in Brussels.  It is the capital and largest city in the country, so that is to be expected.  By no means was it unmanagable, though, and this is when the city was packed because of the beer festival.   Prices:   8.5  Most things in Brussels are affordable.  You can eat cheap, travel cheap, surf the web cheap, and get nice accomodations at reasonable prices.  Certainly a budget friendly place.   Overall Likability:   8  Despite the negatives, the city has a life and energy that triumphs.  The positive aspects of the city outweigh everything else.  It has a homey feeling and after I got past the initial indifference, I felt comfortable there.  Like being wrapped in a big warm blanket with a cup of hot chocolate.   Final Score:   73.00

      basically, when i got out of the train station and onto the streets of london, i knew that what i was about to do would rock some serious fucking shit.  i took a deep breath, tried to hide my silly looking smile, and dropped my backpack to the cement.  "ok, i need to figure out where my hotel is."  i flipped through my "let's go: western europe" guidebook and found the location of the luna simone hotel on the map.  then i read the information about the hotel.  "funny, the map shows the hotel in one spot, but the description places it somewhere else.  which one should i follow?  hmmm.  i think i'll go with the map."     RULE #1  NEVER trust a guidebook's map.  there is a very good chance that the map in the guide will be wrong at least once.  there is also a good chance it will be incorrect on several occasions.  also, the map usually seems to be wrong when you really, REALLY need it to be right.     it's important to accept that (a) you're lost, and (b) your map is stupid, as soon as possible.  otherwise, you will be like me, and wander around the city mumbling, "but the guide says it's right around here..."  i eventually figured out that the map was wrong.  so i started asking people if they knew where the correct street was.  of course, nobody had even heard of the street.     RULE #2  do NOT trust londoners with giving you directions.  streets in london make absolutely no sense.  it's not a grid system, and you WILL get confused.  hell, they don't even know where most of the streets are.     the great thing about cities here is that, for the most part, a street has the same name until it is no longer a street.  not so in london (and for a lot of europe, actually).  a street you have been walking on for several blocks will suddenly be something else.  two blocks later it changes names again.  three blocks later and it's back to the name that it was when you first started on it.  it's enough to make you want to give some annoying brit a nasty paper cut and pour malt vinegar on it.  oh, one thing really quick -- MAKE SURE WHEN YOU ARE ABOUT TO CROSS A STREET THAT YOU LOOK DOWN AT THE STREET.  you will see friendly words that say "look right" or "look left."  these words are important if you don't want to get run over by the absolutely insane drivers in london.  anyway, some very nice people tried very hard to help me find my way.  eventually, after about an hour of walking around, i stumbled across the hotel.  honestly, it was pure luck.  it was fairly nice, and it was clean.  i wasn't exactly expecting the four seasons, and i was just happy to have a place to drop all of my shit off.  i got to the room, opened the door, and wondered why they gave me a key to some strange looking closet with a bed and toilet.     RULE #3  hotel rooms in europe are tiny.  many times the one bedroom rooms are about as big as a walk in closet with a bed inside.  sometimes there is actually a toilet or shower in the room, and, occasionally, both.  but don't count on it.     i mean, i'm sure if you stayed at a hilton or something it would pretty much be similar to here.  but, unlike here, there are tons and tons of affordable, relatively clean hotels to stay in that are not chains.  spending a ton of money on a chain hotel in europe is not cost effective.  i left the hotel to do a little exploring and found a nice little pub.  i saddled up to the bar, screwed a cig into my mouth, and ordered an english beer.    after downing it pretty quickly, i looked at the menu and ordered a BLT.  perfect.  i was so hungry, i just wanted something recognizable.     RULE #4  food in europe is not the same as food here, no matter how much it sounds like it will be.  hamburgers are different.  hot dogs are different.  pizza is different.  if you want something good to eat, don't eat american food.  find something palatable that is unique to that area.  you will be happier that way.     for example, what do you think when you think BLT?  crispy bacon?  toasty bread?  creamy mayo, perhaps?  sure, sounds good.    how about thick, fatty, soggy bacon?  or plain, mushy white bread?  or something that may or may not be mayo?  right.  it wasn't exactly what i was expecting, but, ultimately, it got the job done.  it's not that it was terrible, it was just totally different.  ok, it was kind of bad.  but still...  after a couple more beers and smokes, i went back to take a nap.  i slept for about 4 hours, and when i woke up, the daylight was gone.  i went down to the eurostar office and purchased a ticket to brussels for 8:37 the next morning.  it cost me roughly $100.  i left there to check out some of the town again, and ended up at a decent little bar.  i drank a few beers, played some golden tee, and talked with some brits.  they were impressed by my golden tee abilities.  i squeezed in another beer before the eleven o'clock cut off (yes, in case you didn't know, pubs in the UK stop serving at eleven) and headed on back to the hotel.  i tried to sleep, but couldn't.  eventually, i fell asleep around 4:30.     RULE #5  jetlag sucks.  if you're not used to it, just try to do the best you can to go to bed at the same time you normally would at home.  trust me, it's not easy.  the time difference will fuck you.     case in point, i woke up at 8:44 in the morning.  not good.  not only did i miss my free breakfast, but i also missed the train i was supposed to take.  i got my shit and went down to the eurostar office.  the next train was at 10:37.  i waited patiently in line for about thirty minutes.  finally, i got to the counter at 10:27.  now, grant it, i lied.  i told the guy that i had asked for the 10:37 train, but the agent misheard me and made my reservation for the 8:37 train, but i hadn't realized the mistake until i got ready to board.  the guy look at me and said, "normally, i wouldn't do this, but..."     RULE #6  being patient, polite, and flashing a big fucking smile pays off.  this is true about many things in life.  remember it.     quickly, me and my free replacement ticket ran over to the platform and boarded the high speed train to belgium.  i got to brussels and, soon after, hopped on a train to luxembourg city.     RULE #7  belgian trains are super uncomfortable.  the seats are hard and, apparently, they are contoured to fit some alien species.  try to be rested before you get on one, because you will be cursing out those damned seats after a three hour train ride into or out of luxembourg.     i arrived in luxembourg in the afternoon, and when i stepped outside the train station, that's when i really felt like my trip had truly begun.

      ok, i'm not sure what to make of this blog.  i originally started it as a way to assign ratings to each city i visited and score them accordingly.  i'm not sure that's such a great idea anymore.  not only have i not updated this blog in a while, but i only ever got 2 cities into it.  well, 3, but somehow i erased the one i did about bruges before i ever got to publish it.  i'm retarded.  i know.  but, basically, what i've decided to do now is just take each city and write a small (or big) blurb on what happened there and what my experiences were like.  hopefully it will give you an idea of what to expect if you ever go backpacking in europe.  it may not be as subjective and neat as numerical ratings, but i think it will paint a better picture.  and, really, that's more important.
