      Almost ready to hit the road. For those of you who don't know I am driving down to DC to visit my family and my buddy Jason for the Memorial Day Weekend. It's actually turned into an extended vacation. I got Friday and Tuesday off as well. Less than two months on the job and I'm already relishing the moment.   Oh yes, did I tell you I'm driving down to DC. This will be my second time I'm making the midnight trek. This time with my mom. And we're leaving any moment now...  Home: 11:20 PM ETA DC 8:00 AM   I'll have more stories and pics to share when I'm back.   Hope everyone has a good weekend. Have some BBQ for me. Go Sox!

      There is always a give and take going on between my belly and my head.  "Wow, this food is really yummy, I want to eat all of it." "I'm so full, I should save my leftovers for later." The breaking point comes when you eat more than two thirds of your meal and your leftovers become a moot point. I crossed that point just a while back. I am so full right now and I don't want to write any more BzzReports...  The trip to Chinatown with Brendan was lovely and I am very happy with my choice of Hon Sue Fish over rice.

      As of Monday May 26 11:52 EST my fantasy baseball team, the  Fraggle Rox , is beating the FayBobsters (a girl guy couple hybrid that is destined to fail, again) 10-0.   Incredible considering I just won my first match up of the season last week. Seven weeks into the season! Mind you, I am  the reigning 2003 BUMLB Fantasy Champion . This is my hobby, my life, my addiction.  p.s. It's a marathon, not a sprint

      Brief recap on my "career": I work at  urlLink BzzAgent , a word of mouth advertising agency located in Boston, MA. MORE ON MY JOB LATER My title is Communication Developer (Com Dev). I essentially develop communication (get it, get it) i.e. responding to emails from participants (BzzAgents) in a variety of product campaigns. I do not work in a high stress environment. In fact the casual, low-key atmosphere is one of the highlights of working here.   A few weeks ago we had a meeting to discuss the number of BzzReports that every Com Dev'er has to do. I need to complete between 90-100 reports a day, an average of 13-15 per my eight hour day, seven working, sans lunch break. Today I guess I had my follow-up review and I am clocking in at a blistering 72 a day, just a tad over 10 an hour. Suffice it to say, your humble Quan has not been living up to expectations... sigh

      First off, I would like to welcome everyone to my new blog. I plan on using this page as a forum for writing my inner thoughts, personal insight, random shout outs and plugs. While the page may seem to be a bit discombobulated, but please bear with me. This is all new to me. You see I didn't have a pulsating headache from night of hard drinking.  In fact I woke up this morning on time. Instead, I was greeted with the realization that I have my very own blog.   Last night I asked my best friend Frank to show me how to start a web log and instead he created one for me. Thanks Frank (dripping with sarcasm). You’ll probably hear a lot about Frank in this space. In fact he will probably provide his two cents on a majority of postings. WORD OF CAUTION: He's as two-faced as the sun is bright. Don't trust a thing he says! EVER!  I'll be updating the site as the week progresses. Back to work. The Bzz never stops...

      Here is a smattering of my horscopes today:  "There's no end to the things you've yet to learn -- book-knowledge and otherwise."  "Drama is the sharpest tool in your drawer. Going for full visibility and perfect pitch instantly makes you the tallest thing in the landscape. You're so bright and loud that you're a magnet for interesting people and events. As far as you're concerned, strange is good and bizarre is better. Every odd angle and unintended consequence is brimming with possible adventure. And you're not especially concerned about the trail of disorder that you leave behind you. It's good for neighbors and witnesses to have their world reconfigured from time to time. You're making quite a name for yourself."  "You could do some traveling over short distances today, mike. You'll enjoy being on the road, attending to unfinished business. Or you might visit a friend. You'll be around some new faces and experimenting with some new relationships. Just present yourself in your usual friendly, professional way, and then you'll be appreciated wherever you go. You'll enjoy introducing yourself and networking your socks off, so keep some business cards handy!"  Well that settles it, the weekend will be good!

      It has come to my attention that a lot of people are rooting for the Detroit Pistons in the NBA Finals. And for the life of me I don't know why. Watching the Pistons play basketball is reminiscent of having a root canal.   Detroit cannot and will not win a NBA title because of the following reasons:   1). You cannot win without at least two bona fide "I will tell my children how I saw X play" superstars (let alone not a single one). You can’t win against history.   2) Darko Millic will have more championship rings than T-Mac, AI, KG, J Kidd, and Paul Pierce combined. Not to mention the Mailman, Chuck Wagon, Stockton, and Ewing  3) Rasheed will be invited to the White House. That's got "incident" written all over it.  4) David Stern does not want the Pistons to win. And what David Stern wants he gets.   5) Ben Wallace will appear on a box of Wheaties. He's got one ugly mug.  6) Darko again…   7) No team since 1979 has won a title without one of the NBA's 50 Greatest Players on the roster. Once again, history will stymie the Pistons.  8) Kobe Bryant. Who else would you rather have taking a game winning shot?  9) Larry Brown is a nice guy and all, but  “It’s not team policy to foul in that situation.”  Come on?  10) Shaq. The Wallaces’ can’t stop him; they can only hope to contain him.   Showtime in six.  LET’S GO LAKESHOW!

      Everyone morning I trek the same path to work. Get off at South Station, walk across the bridge, turn down the street, right into the building and up an ungodly four flights of stairs. This past Monday, I was greeted with the unpleasant sight of a dead pigeon. This bird did not die of natural causes mind you (although I have seen pigeons fall out of the sky before, perishing of heat exhaustion), but it looks to have been hit by a motor vehicle. Beats me how a bird can get hit by a car, the whole flying thing and all, but SPLAT. Dead as can be. Flat as can be, too. I degress...  It's been a gradual process that I only realized today. No one really makes an effort to step around the carcass anymore. It seems that the bird has become one with the pavement. There is no more blood or goo. Only a few feathers.   Urban renewal at its finest.

      DISCLAIMER: This has nothing to do with my present situation.  You know what I hate, when you are in the beginning stages, less than 90 days (it's like waiting until you get health/dental benefits at work) of dating someone and a major gift giving relationship holiday (V Day, Christmas, Chanukah, etc.), or worse a birthday, rears its ugly head. Do you have to get the significant other something? Yes, you do. But why? Well it's come to my understanding that only women and third world dictators consider their post teenage year birthdays to be national events.   And what to get? This is a dilemma that may very well establish gift-giving etiquette for the tenure of the relationship. It goes without saying, get a bad gift (i.e. too cheap, no consideration) and you'll find yourself in a hole so deep you'll be lucky to get out in time for next season's Opening Day. On the flip side, if you get an over extravagantly luxurious gift you can either a) scare her off for moving too fast. Or worse b) set the precedent of always having to break the bank on any trivial gift giving holiday, such as Secretary's day, Arbor Day, Day Light Savings Time Day and days of similar ilk.   My advice something cute, yet funny, and shows that you are thinking of her. Try to incorporate it into one of your first few dates. If you went to the aquarium, a stuffed penguin perhaps. And please save the mega exorbitant bling bling for the special occasions or get out of jail free cards (see Kobe Bryant).   Thanks for humoring me.

      I am never a person to hold grudges. I may pout, stew, and whine, but bygones tend to be bygones. For those of you who have known me for some time may recall my "falling out" with Krissy.   I meet her my junior year at BU and we immediately hit it off. We were in the same major and shared many a class together. We even lived in the same building, so we were able to walk to and from class with each other. It seems that people thought that we should have been dating. She was definitely a cute girl, but I was dating Lauren at the time (big mistake) and she was dating this guy Jake. In hindsight Lauren and Jake were made for each other: both Jewish and incredibly, horrifically anal.   Long story short...  Do not let friends borrow money . Loaning your best friends money is no biggie, because things like that tend to even out. A drink here, grabbing the check there. But when you front someone a $300 plane ticket, you had be better making the "amore". That was the summer after graduation, so almost two years ago and we haven't spoken since then. A few weeks ago we were both put in the awkward position of meeting up. Our common friend Matt (my boy) was the mediator of this little get together and through him we realized how silly and petty this all was. I was nervous, she was nervous. We should have dated, it sure felt like meeting an ex.   A few margaritas later and it was just like the good old days at BU. Krissy is one crazy "craka" who I am glad is back in my life.

      Last night was a pretty tough pill to swallow. I was supposed to pick up my cousin Jon at Logan last night after work. His plane should have arrived shortly before six which would have been perfect for me. Leave work the normal time and swing by. Pick him up, grab some drink and food, watch the game. For some weather related reason his plane did not come in until almost 8. Fine I'll just wander around the city for a bit. And then the beauty of airport traffic and believing Massport. Exits changed, roads closed. There's a reason I always fly out of Providence. And if anyone wants to visit me, I advise you flying into T.F. Greene.   Finally after securing the pickup, Jon and I were able to head off to Brookline and the Coolidge Corner Clubhouse just in time for the 6th inning of the game. That Manny can sure swing a big stick! Good times had by all. But for those of you who aren't a part of the Red Sox nation and do not know... Sox lost 5-4 in 13th.  SWEPT BY THE YANKEES  It doesn't get any lower. Oh yeah, the Devil Rays are right on our tails in the AL East.   So there is only one thing to do. Packing up it up and heading on down to the  urlLink Sun  Come Play! Yes, indeed we shall. Indeed we shall.

      Just sitting here quietly at work doing BzzReports and all of a sudden Tim freaks out. Something from the ceiling has been dripping on him and he just now realized what it was: urine. The company above us has a dog and it seems that they forgot to take him for a walk today. Tim is not amused. He is covered in dog piss. So is his desk, his laptop, and his mouse pad. I'm sorry I can't stop laughing, Tim.

      So this guy:    is sampling these guys:   in his latest single.   In April of 1999 Mase, Puff Daddy's anointed golden child, left the glamorous world of hip hop behind; making an abrupt about face, turning to a new found spirituality. Mase, born Mason Betha, said no to a life of celebrity, bling bling, Cristal and hoes, instead seeking something greater.   "This is the realest thing you've ever seen," he said. "I'm walking away from this not knowing where my next job is coming from. That's how much I believe in myself. You want a role model? I'm gonna show you what role models do."  Suffice it to say that Mase has made his triumphant (MTV fueled) return to mainstream music in the form of his latest single,  urlLink Welcome Back . Yes, the spiritual unrest is over. He is a man now at peace with the world and joy appears to be in his heart.

      I'm all for being a friendly guy and all, but why do people insist on giving me a smile when I pass them on the way to the bathroom at work. This isn't a bar, there doesn't need to be any chit chat or small talk. Do they know something I don't. My fly is up, I didn't wet myself. I just don't get it.   I think in retaliation I am going to be leaving the seat up at all time and opening the window, which faces across from another building.

      Been feeling down kind of lately so I decided to extend my hour lunch break and take a walk to Down Town Crossing. Nothing like a little afternoon stroll/shopping extravaganza to brighten the mood. I scored myself a pair of designer shades (knock off of course), a coupon for a Quizno's sub (Hepatitis scares tends to drive business away) and a medium Frosty from Wendy's. Ah material excess, if the feeling wasn't so fleeting...

      By no means would I consider myself a ladies man. In fact I often refer to myself, and have been refereed to, as being "as smooth as broken glass" when it comes to the fairer sex. But I have had encounters with my fair share of lady friends and have observed that like snowflakes no two female bodys are alike. With that being said, I am curious to see what you the reader (both male and female, alike) are fond of when regarding the  color of a nipple .  We know that they come in three distinct shades:  pink, tan and brown . I don't know if color is a direct reflection of race, but essentially these are the three categories I am going with.   Personally I favor a tan nipples, slightly darker than the surrounding skin tone. Your feedback would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.

      I am writing this because I know that you will be reading this. I hope that the old saying is true and that the third time is the charm. Of all the people I have given my heart to, you are the one I want to continue having in my life. Whatever silly, beautiful, ugly thing that we had for the past year was a part of me. That is why it hurts so much; you were a part of my life and now that you are gone, a part of me has gone too. The finality of this is really quite sobering. Like I said I never want things to go back the way they were because the way things were, was not letting you be happy. I wish things could be that unique, special thing that we once shared. However brief and fleeting that special time was, it was worth it.   Love,   me

      Well, the streak is finally over. Eric Gagne's streak of 84 straight saves ended Monday night when the Arizona Diamondbacks scored a run in the ninth. 84 saves over the course of two-seasons. Amazing.   I've always been a fan of Eric Gagne. One, he plays for the Dodgers. I was born in LA and proudly wore my Dodger Blue satin jacket from '84-'87. If Nomar was to ever be traded to/or acquired by LA I might have to take a long hard look in the mirror. Two, in BUMLB II I took a waiver wire flyer on this Canadian lefty, barley hanging onto the number five spot in LA's rotation. Suffice it to say I struck gold. You don't have t-shirts with  "Game Over"  and your face printed on them by being some kind of stiff. Oh yeah, and that face. That beautiful goateed, goggle eyed mug. The one wearing the sweat-stained hat, that's good for an entire 162 games. The epitome of a closer.   I can say that I saw the game's greatest closer at his best. A few years back I was at Dodger Stadium, with Matt, to see LA take on the D Backs*. The Dodgers were up 2-0 going into the top of the ninth. Like the typical LA fan base, everyone was pretty much on the way out. But I had to stick around. I had some extra incentive on this game. A little action, if you will. Every time the Dodgers shutout an opponent, every fan in attendance receives a dozen free Krispy Kreme Donuts. Two outs, none on, with Gagne having just struck out the previous batter with a 97 MPH fastball up high, a ridiculous 76 MPH changeup and the most beautiful 12-6 curveball that these eyes have ever seen and Matt Williams* at bat. The fans that remained were going crazy. Matt and I were exchanging high fives with everyone around. Intense. FREE DONUTS and a Dodger win; traffic back to Newport Beach wouldn't be that bad at all. The windup, the pitch... and gone. Thome sent Gagne's 98 mph offering back into deep right field. 2-1 Dodgers win. No shutout, no Krispy Kreme, 2 hours playing soccer and smoking cigarettes in parking lot waiting for traffic to die down. And being able to see the master at work.  GAME OVER    &nbsp;  *edited with help from Matt

      No decision is completely arbitrary. Roll a die, pick a card – some unarticulated motive will affect the outcome. Nothing is pure chance.   At the start of each day, you make a choice. And you have to live with it. You’ve learned how to navigate your top drawer and the silks and cottons it holds, but getting her has been a process. In the beginning, you had no say - someone else put them on and took them off. But then underwear became perhaps the first sartorial choice in your life. Your inner child knows that the skivvies you put on are intimately connected to who you are, hence the wailing echo of “I wanna wear my Underoooos!” Outside, you were just another goofy three-year old. Inside, you were Aquaman.  The change from Justice League to snug and silky is subtle; underwear evolution comes without color commentary. But each year, your natural selections take on greater import. It’s a complicated cocktail of mood and intentions, choosing underwear is: an expression of how you forecast the day ahead, your expectations and hopes, maybe eve your dreams.  Your underwear sends a signal. But it also transmits a message inward, whether you want to receive it or not. Like on those days when you catch yourself lingering just a little too long at the top drawer as you mentally fast-forward to the shank of the evening.  No! you say, that has nothing to with it , claiming mom and paramedics as you select. But as you anxiously gulp one more beer with your best friend’s recent ex and your silky blues struggle to readjust themselves, you know that something that was not supposed to be there is. It’s taunting you, flaunting you; it’s got you under its skin. At the end of the day, you can’t hide who you are. Or what you want. Your underwear does not lie.

      When all of a sudden you realize how hot one of your acquaintances, friend or even coworkers are. BAM! It just hits you.  Wow, she is really hot.  A girl that I know has just returned from an extended hiatus and for whatever reason... I'm totally digging her this morning. Maybe it's the fact that I haven't seen her in a while? Maybe it's that freshly bronzed tan that she is sporting from a week away on holiday? Or perhaps, it's that snug black cotton/lycra top she is wearing. Yeah, it's definitely the top. Sweater kittens are a glorious thing ladies. :)

      Well it's Friday morning and the WillStock has come and gone. I HAVE A SPLITTING HEADACHE. God does this feel anticlimactic. And for one very good reason: Will is sitting across from me right now. Still at work. Hey you got to give it to the guy he is a trooper. He took his licks like a champ last night and made it in to work at 8:30 (lucky for him Kerry got him home in once piece).   It's like this, yesterday was the like the last day of middle school. Everyone is stir crazy just waiting for the bell to rind and get the hell out of there. You got a full summer ahead of you. Swimming, playing some catch, eating Popsicles and nothing expected out of you except some quality lounging. But wait... all of sudden the school committee lets you know that there was an extra snow day back in January that needs to be made up the next day. Your heart drops and it's like, "Why am I hear?"  Oh well, got to make the best of the situation. The NY Times is here to write up a story about BzzAgent. Looks like we are going to be big news. It's really dawning on me that Bzz and Word of Mouth is going to the next big thing. The wave of the future? Hopefully. Maybe we'll even take the jump to Pantheon level (insert Sports Guy plug here). Only one thing left to do: take an Advil, get some OJ in my system and act awake for the remainder of the day.

      Dear Ron,   I am sorry that I ever doubted you. I am sorry that I was simply too lazy to visit more often. I should have cared more. Sure I was tired, but you have always been there for me when I needed you. I have to make a confession. I visited "you know who" down the street. I know it was wrong, but I had no choice. It was late, I wasn't thinking. It made perfect sense at the time.   And today, sitting here at work eating my lunch I realize what a fool I had been.  Lettuce, I hate shredded lettuce.  You know that, of course you would know that. You've been a part of my life since high school. Every Tuesday, we would share something special. Oh and don't get me started. It jus wasn't the same. They didn't care if I wanted cheese or not. They didn't even ask what kind of bread I wanted. I panicked and had plain wheat. Just pathetic. I am so disappointed with my sandwich. A foot long chicken salad sub for $3.99 when everyone worth their salt, knows that on Tuesdays, that should be a $2.99 sub. Cucumbers, hot peppers, carrots... all extra. GOD, what's wrong with them?   I knew I was making a mistake when I went to the Subway at the Rotary and now I'm in a world of hurt. I have only myself to blame. I have learned from my mistakes and will be buying my Subway only from you. &nbsp;   Sincerely,   Disappointed and hungry

      Have been living at home for the past two years and there's only so many movies to watch and if you go to the Orchid more than once a month you can really sign up for full-fledged townie status (shudder). So when the chance to do something fun arises, I jump at the opportunity... and jump I did.   Veronica, a former co-worker of mine at the Hive, attended local State U. and has family that lives in my town. At work, over IM we used to bond over to Dave's Diner, the bowling alley (her granddad used to own) and best of all, the Galleria. This mall is pretty much the only show in town when you&nbsp;don't have your license. God, I know I'm not  that  old yet, but teenagers are the worst. Nothing like seeing 14 years girls wearing pink thongs and fake Coach hats. Except, their prepubescent male counterparts in their Mike Vick throwbacks. A recent venture to see a Friday night flick with Frank in literally drove me to drink. But I digress.   V invited me to attend her annual family BBQ/gathering. But what the heck? I like cold drinks. I like hot eats. And it's Sunday night. I guess I didn't really know what I was getting into. Man this was one huge shindig. Three gas grills, horseshoe pits, and allegedly hayrides on the tractor. Doesn't get more wholesome, small town white bread than that. Not that I felt out of place, I've been the only Asian kid in town (save my cousins) since Bush 1.0 was in office, so I'm used to it. And best of all:  a giant inflatable orange dinosaur  to bounce in.   A good time had by all... in... with a giant inflatable orange dinosaur. Go figure.

      Alright, Boston's day in the sun is almost over and hopefully we can get back to some sort of normalcy. Lot's of  urlLink protests  and  urlLink celeb sightings  have been going down but unfortunetly I have not been able to check any of them out.   Moving onto something more important. It's the dawn of a new season for the defending  SuperBowl Champion New England Patriots , as they open mini camp today. It should be an exciting few weeks as they gear up for the September 9 KickOff Extravaganza vs. Peyton and the boys from Indy on the nationally televised season opener.

       I shouldn't even be here today.    So there was  suspicious activity  on the Red Line tracks today. Whatever this was, lead my Commuter Rail to be be delayed in Quincy Center. MBTA's brilliant thinking was to load us up on the Red Line to North Quincy, where we were to take shuttle buses to Ashmont and then to take the Red Line into South Station. All in all quite the clusterfuck.   I'm so glad that Jon asked me to come in today.

      Hey guys, this is a very special week. The DNC is in town for the next 4 days and I'll be coming at you as often as I can with my nonpartisan take on things.   Everyone know what's going on? Hometown Senator makes his triumphant return to accept the Democratic nomination. Hosted by a local mayor who has put Boston squarely in the national media spotlight. A city brought to its knees by traffic hassle and aforementioned mayor's contract squabbles with local police unions. So that's the cliff notes version of things for you out of town readers.

      Saw  I, Robot  this weekend. And much to everyone else's disagreement I thought it was a pretty good movie. Quite frankly I think the movie was marketed all wrong. This wasn't your typical Will Smith summer blockbuster fare. There was no comedic cornball angle, no one getting jiggy with it and we are still waiting on the Pepsi/Taco Bell tie-ins. Instead it was a psychological thriller with Smith flexing his acting chops just as much as his still Ali-esque muscles.    But that might be due to the fact that I went into it with absolutely no expectations whatsoever. Don't get me wrong, I know about the great hype machine that has been working overdrive the past few weeks, putting Will Smith's mug everywhere I turn. I can handle the MTV specials, and the endless trailers during prime time coverage, but the 10 feet posters hanging in the Galleria was a bit much.    Long story short: if science fiction has ever taught us anything it is.... to never give computers Artificial Intelligence. Bad things man, bad things.    With that being said, check this bad Larry out:  urlLink 20 Q's

      My commuter rail was delayed for an hour today. One freaking hour. And this had absolutely nothing to do with the DNC traffic snarls. This was a simple old-fashioned case "engine trouble"... or so they tell us.

      Oh my god... I feel it in my bones. It's only a week away until the release of  urlLink Madden 2005 .  ONLY THE GREATEST VIDEO GAME FRANCHISE EVER!  Have you seen the commercials with Ray Lewis in them? That man knows how to put the fear of God into people. Thump, thump, thump... What is that? My PS 2's Dual Shock Controller? No it's my heart beating with trepidation.  August 12. One day after my birthday if anyone is interested.   I'm so in the game.

      Since I have started my new job it has been really hard to find time to work out. I even quit the gym, but that based more on economical reasons than anything else.  Sure I went through my running kick, after reading that  urlLink Roger Bannister book,  a while back. I was running one mile a day, consistently clocking in under the  Magical 8 Minute Barrier  and if I missed a day I would run two the next. And so on (yeah I know not much, but it's a start). Well I was keeping up with that for about two weeks and my times were decreasing everyday. But then I just ended up being busy for a few days in a row and next thing you know I was staring at a 7-mile day. End of that.  And then there was my dream of the  Tour de Lakeville . Got my purple 10-speed Huffy all cleaned up and I was on my way. I bought a bike helmet (which unbeknownst to me I was wearing backwards for three days) and had my yellow livestrong bracelet. Oh to be like Lance... It was fun too. I was honestly enjoying myself. Cruising down the streets, wind blowing in my face it was a blast.  I still try to make it out every now and then, but for whatever reason that came to an end as well.  Now I punish myself with a grueling regimen of  prison style workouts : an hour of yard time where I do push ups, sit-ups and a variety of yoga like stretches. That, two shakes one sensible meal a day...  And if physical activity isn't your bad, I suggest checking out this  urlLink website .

      Today is my birthday. I am now 24.  Youth, future, endless potential yada yada.... I'm not living that anymore.  I'm officially too old to be on the Real World now. If you really know me, you know how much this hurts.

      During my last semester senior year, a professor once asked "do you think ethics have a role in advertising?" He gave the hypothetical example of: if you were given the task of creating work for a gun or a tobacco company what would you do? I (You) can live a complete harmonious life if you exist solely in theory, but only when you are faced with a real choice do your principles come into play.  Today is a big day at the Hive. Jono literally told me that this is the biggest meeting that we have ever had. Make or break, if you will. The balance between "selling out" and "surviving". It's not going to be an easy task. It has already been roundly debated.  Time to look across the table at the face of  Big Tobacco . I don't want to blink.
