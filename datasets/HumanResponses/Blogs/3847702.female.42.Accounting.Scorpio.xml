      The oak tree on the hill what wonders it’s heard from far and near  The words of love like wings of a bird flutter and take flight  But the words of hatred in the soul are mirrored forever to endure  The whispers of souls just born and words of souls long gone  The oak tree on the hill the branches stirred by breezes of a spoken word  Copyright 2000 TMD    I'm trying to change a few things in this poem.  But I haven't figured out what needs changed.

      I wore the tie-dye I wore the look  Trying to find pieces of me he took  I protested his touch I was no longer there  I told him to stop he didn’t care  I thought I was happy on acid, speed & Mary Jane  They called me groovy living life in the cosmic lane  I thought the drugs would hide broken spirit, stained soul  I tried to live in life’s commune music played such a vital role  I tried several times to drop out of life  The thought of you saved me from alcohol, drugs and a knife  The first time I loved I was the innocent age of ten  You could not see the ugly it was there even then  In my life you came back  You made it easy to love away the black  You loved & accepted me for who I was  You gave me peace White as the doves  With you I have continued  to blossom and grow  Eighteen years now the gray, beginning to show  Two beautiful daughters now we have raised  I cannot tell you how much everyday I am amazed  The passion, the quiver and butterflies Your look, your breath, your touch  I know this is so little I love you so much  Copyright 2000 TMD  This poem arose from an assignment given on a poem web site.  They gave us 10 words we had to use.  When I looked at the words I thought it impossible.  But it soon began to flow.

      I was able to get off the drugs and alcohol for my baby.  We were married. It lasted about 1 year.  He beat me at least every other day and raped me several times.  I finally left 1 day after our first anniversary party.  That night it took 3 guys to pull him off of me.  He said he was afraid he was going to kill me and not really mean to.  Moved back home.  Was still a little wild, but calmed down a lot.  For valentines day that year I received a dozen roses.  I thought that SOB, what is he trying now.  I opened the card and they were from my Navy guy.  He was out of the Navy and my brother told him I was divorced.  So we went out a few times.  Moved in together.  Lived together for a year.  I never knew life could be so good.  We were married 22 years this April 04.  Two beautiful daughters and 2 delightful grandbabies later.  Our olderest daughter knew my husband was not her biological father, but he has been the only dad she's known.  Next posting will be some poems.

      Got dinner started, so I'll post some more.  At about 13 or 14 I had a crush (major) on my oldest brother's best friend.  He was so cute.  My mom kept telling me to leave him alone I would get him trouble.  When I was 14 1\2 he went into the Navy.  He was 18.  I was crushed, cried for 2 days.  Went to his going away party but couldn't even look at him.  Of course being 14, my life did go on.  But I was heavy into alcohol and some drugs.  Mainly speed, pot, and downers.  Had several boyfriends.  Defied my parents and any authority.  Would be gone for days sometimes weeks.  Mom didn't want me there anyway, was my analogy.  Had a serious boyfriend at 16.  He introduced me to my first LSD cube.  I was out of it for about 3 days. Seen all sorts of things.  And some lady there, told me my soul was trying to leave my body, and that really freaked me out.  At 17 I bacame pregnant by above boyfriend.  We had been dating for about 6 months.

      I was born in a rural town in Illinois, the 3rd of 5 children.  We were not poor, but by far not rich.  My parents and all siblings are still alive.  I don't remember much of my childhood.  I have never experienced unconditional love from my mother.  My father is the best.  But to this day I do not feel love from my mother.  I was the sick child, the one the docs said would not live.  I spent a lot of time with 2 other families.  With an aunt until I was about 4 and later with friends of the family, so I am told.  I still have not asked my parents why?  I was molested from age 8 to 13 by a family member.  I have not told anyone in the family except my only sister.  At age 14 I was raped at a cousin's party.  An older boy walked in with a 6 pack of beer and I said you give me a couple, I'll give you something later.  When it was my turn to give I ran.  He chased me through the house and found me in my aunt's closet where he proceeded to rape me.  My older cousin came home and caught him and beat the hell out of him.  I wasn't really ashamed I always thought of it as being my fault and still do.  No one in the family, but my cousin knows.  After that came the drugs, alcohol and sex and more drugs, alcohol and sex.  I am lucky to be alive.

      Well hubby came home without the daughter, she's staying at some friends.&nbsp; I was feeling pretty good by the time he got home.&nbsp; After a long time he finally showed some interest and&nbsp;we made love, no we fucked.&nbsp; Is it to late to repair the feelings of neglect and of being lost that&nbsp;I have developed over the last 2 years?&nbsp; I can tell you this, it wasn't him I was fucking in my mind.&nbsp; It started out to be him, until a bead of sweat from his brow hit my forehead.&nbsp; And I began thinking, I wonder if he can tell I want to fuck (you know who you are)&nbsp;someone else.&nbsp; He senses something, because he has been more attentive and asked me if I'm ok.&nbsp; I have talked to him about our sex life or lack of it.&nbsp; I'm still a young, sensual woman.&nbsp; I'm not ready to give up sex.&nbsp; He said we will work on it.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; Tina

      You don't want me.  You want the girl I was 27 years ago at 15.  In those white pants, so tight I needed help to zip them.  In a halter top just barely cupping my size C breast. Just barely showing my belly until I did my back bends. At 15 I knew what I was doing with every back bend I did in front of you.  With every sommersault.  I knew I turned you on and melted you.  You could of took me then, I would of never said a word.  I was already very sexually active with guys my age and older guys.  Older then you were at the time. See I also remember that day.  I went to the kitchen to try to do the splits, but my pants were to tight.  You said if I took them off you would lay under me to be my kickstand so I would not fall.  I don't remember if we were alone or not.  But if we were I would of let you.  When you told me about this memory the other day, it sent me for a loop.  Really shocked me.  If you want contact later you know where to find me.  River

      And there wasn't even anything to dump.  It scared him that I posted about the way things were going.  Like the millions and millions of websites out there and someone was going to happen by and say hey thats so and so.  I'm gonna tell his wife.  But that's fine.  I understand I guess.  But I need this place to post my feelings, wants and thoughts.  I have no one to talk to openly that is.  HE is the only one that knows who I am.  So the ball's in his court.  If my family finds out about this site, it had to be him that leaked.    Tina

      Sitting, watching the river go by flowing, rolling and turning  The river reflects the sky cannot control, stop or slow  As I watch the current take its course I try to envision where it will go  It's own wishes to enforce flowing, rolling and turning  The water between the banks it's cold, fast and swift  In this river many souls have sank this river called life, this gift  Copyright  2001 TMD

      Have you lost you desire Heart and soul bound by barbwire  What is different, What is the same You made the woman I became  Your passion use to consume like a wildfire Is it not easy to reacquire  Why your passion did you tame What is the path, What is the aim  Are we caught in a quagmire Like a switch can we rewire  Our desires no longer the same Where do we place the blame  Copyright June 10 2004 TMD

      I'm drunk, Again. This is getting to be a habit. Not really. I guess this is the 3rd or 4th time in 2 weeks. But I have a about 1 drink a day. Before that it had been about 10 years. But we use to be heavy drinkers. I stopped when I ended up in the hospital with a bleeding ulcer, but thanks to science and expensive meds, no stomach problems for quit awhile. He stopped too, but he can't drink much because of his heart medications. I'm afraid that as horny as I've been, I'm gonna give him another heart attack. He has been really good, patient and understanding. He thinks it is the hormones, but I have always wanted sex more often then he did. I have always wanted to try different things, but I can never tell him these things.  I could always tell   you  .   You   would never judge me or think bad of me. And it was good, until I couldn't get you out of my head. You were there, everywhere I looked, everytime I closed my eyes. I am trying desperately to re-connect with my husband. At times I feel that incrediable connection. And at other times, it doesn't feel like me in his arms. We have always been extremely close. But I was lost before   you and I   started talking again.

      We all have something we regret doing or not doing.  What are my regrets?  I regret not graduating high school.  I did go back when I was about 25 and got my GED and on to college and now have a bachelor's degree in psychology.  Have never worked in my field.  I don't have enough confidence in myself to do that.  So I am a secretary.  I regret letting my health go downhill.  I may not be at death's door yet, but I'm working on it.  I regret the loss of friendships over the years.  I regret not staying close to some of my family members.  I regret putting my father through hell as a teenager.  Staying gone and high on LSD and everything else for days and sometimes weeks at a time.  My mother was different story.  I guess she did the best she could.   I do not regret either of my daughters.  The oldest maybe could of waited awhile, but then she wouldn't be her.  The second daughter also maybe could of waited.  My husband and I got married in April, I found out I was pregnant in July.  I almost died having her and they told me I would not live through another, so I got my tubes tied.  Had major heart issues during labor.       I do regret not trying to give my husband a son.  But he always said he wanted me, not a son.  And then there are the little things, wish I  hadn't  said that, wish I  had  said that.  Wish I  hadn't  done this , wish I  had  done that.

      Today has been a bad day for me.&nbsp; Really depressed.&nbsp; I don't know if what I am experiencing is a regret on life, what did I accomplish?&nbsp; I wish I had done more.&nbsp; Loss of youth.&nbsp; Or just middle age blahs, but I don't like it.  I know our kids are driving us (at least me) fucking nuts.&nbsp; We went into debt again for the oldest.&nbsp; I wouldn't go to the bank and borrow the money, but he did.&nbsp; And when I question her today on why something was bought with the money instead of a bill being paid, she said does it matter.&nbsp; Well for me yes.&nbsp; We did borrow money to buy her a car and she did pay the bank everything on time and never missed.&nbsp; So maybe this will be ok, but we are behind and doing without for the kids and I've had enough.&nbsp; This is suppose to be my time, so when does the fun begin?????????????

      Our 21 yr old daughter and her 19 yr old boyfriend moved in with us.&nbsp;&nbsp; They are driving me nuts.&nbsp; We have had the house to ourselves for a year or longer now and I want my privacy back!!!&nbsp; And he is just a fucking idiot.&nbsp; She is working part time and he is not working at all.  A mother should not feel this way.&nbsp; It makes me feel bad to feel this way.&nbsp; But we could no longer pay their bills.&nbsp; Our kids has us behind on everything trying to keep them afloat.&nbsp; But no more.&nbsp; I refuse to pay anything else.&nbsp; So when they got evicted, she moved back home and he went to work somewhere.&nbsp; He got fired and brought back last week.&nbsp; Now both of them are here.&nbsp; And I want to scream!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  &nbsp;

      I miss our talks.&nbsp; I miss the way you make me feel.&nbsp; And yes I miss the fucking with words.&nbsp; But   mostly   I miss knowing I had you to tell everything & anything&nbsp;to.&nbsp; You are still on my mind and&nbsp;in my heart.&nbsp; But things are getting better.   I finally got a proper fuck today.&nbsp; I have been so depressed that I even had him worried.&nbsp; After he came to bed last night and did nothing but fall asleep I went to the couch.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought all the talking we have done and the emotional mess he knows I'm in how can he just lay there and not make love to me. &nbsp;First time in 23 years I went to sleep on the couch.&nbsp; I stayed there for about 2 hrs went back to bed and stayed on my side.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Told him&nbsp;I'm coming back to bed only because the couch was so uncomfortable&nbsp;and didn't touch him.&nbsp; I figured our marriage was over.&nbsp;&nbsp; I stayed in bed for about 13 hours.&nbsp; Haven't eaten in about 18 hrs, I did do some drinking.&nbsp; Thought maybe the alcohol would take away some of my thoughts and emotions.&nbsp; Hubby&nbsp;came back to bed about 10:30 this morning.&nbsp; I told him he didn't have to stay in with me, he said he couldn't concentrate on anything else.&nbsp; Pretty well laid in one spot for about an hour.&nbsp; I rolled over toward him and he had his eyes closed.&nbsp; He started rubbing me and kissing me.&nbsp; Got all hot and bothered.&nbsp; He rolled me over and lifted my hips to put me on my knees and fucked me from behind and fucked me hard.&nbsp; I can say I NEEDED THAT.&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn't have an orgasm, but that didn't matter, I felt his passion and his love for me .&nbsp; That is what I have missed for almost 2 years now.&nbsp; We talked some more.&nbsp; He siad he too has missed the sex, but he always thought&nbsp;I was happy with it like this.&nbsp; We would fool around, I would perform oral sex and he would finger me, but I missed the actual intercourse.&nbsp; And the fooling around was few and far between.&nbsp;   I told him today, that if I hadn't known better I would of thought he was having an affair.&nbsp; But we work together and are virtually never apart.&nbsp; So an affair on either part would of been difficult to do.   I&nbsp;think some of my problems are hormones.&nbsp; And I think some are stress.&nbsp; I know I was   SO, SO incrediably   close to doing something I would have regretted the rest of my life.&nbsp; If you and I lived closer I would have already fucked you and really be in trouble.&nbsp; I do miss the&nbsp;  FRIENDSHIP   and   maybe   I can go back to that friendship someday.&nbsp; But not for awhile.

      I have missed this place.  But I have been feeling pretty good.  I still have my moments of feeling down, but they are getting less, each day.  Maybe someday I will be free to be me, but not today.

      Today was the first good day I have had in months.  What made it so good?  Well I couldn't say just one thing.  But I think it was a combination of everything, new meds, getting some when I went to bed last night, FRIENDS, grandbabies and daughter and her boyfriend are gone for right now.  That makes me feel bad for feeling glad that they left for awhile.  Realizing that I have to live with what life gives me.  And today I can say that, tomorrow may be a different story.

      You have been the one constant in my life for many years now. The person I can count on through good times and troubled times.  You have always come through when I needed you. Always listening to my babble. Never judging, never condemning.  I don’t feel I have ever been an equal partner in this friendship. You have always given me more than I have given you. You help me reason; help me keep my head on semi-straight.  You help remind me what I have at home. I KNOW I have it GOOD.   Real good  .   Just remember no matter what I do, I love you G.  I know she will never read this, because she does not know about this site.  But I wanted to post it here and in a personal email to her.

      The last day and half has not been real good days. Feeling kinda lonely. Emotionally lonely, if that makes since to anyone. Even went to my grandson's birthday party/BBQ yesterday and felt lonely with all those people there. I looked around the room and thought to myself, all these people that love me, really don't know me. I have always been a true believer in that no matter how long or how much you know someone you REALLY DON'T KNOW them. Know their wants, wishes, desires and their needs. I wish for all my emotions to stop, I wish to die. I haven't wished that for at least a week now. I don't think I'm happy anymore. I don't think my marriage is happy anymore. We just muddle along in life not knowing what's underneath.  Of course the doc says menopause, give the medicine time to work. My fear is: What if I feel the same after the medicine "works". What if it's not menopause? What if it's ME that's wrong??? And nothing else, JUST ME.

        F  reaked Out,   I  nsecure,   N  eaurotic,   E  motional.  I am   not   feeling that way today.  I just think it is a good analogy of somedays.  I am feeling much better.  I did get a diagnosis of PCOS this week.  Which, they tell me runs with women my age and diabetes.   The medication the doc gave is helping me sleep better and that is a BIG help.  I am still unsure of several things in my life, but hey who is'nt.
