      These were the notes last time when I used to be very negative and pretty much sad. I still am, a little but not as much.  So here are the phrases that I used to scrible all over the place and keep rereading to prevent myself from doing anything drastic or stupid.    Love yourself for who you are. Respect others and they will in return. Shut up and listen to yourself. You can never please everyone. Not everyone can like you. You have a voice, a heart and a brain. Use it. Nothing is impossible. You are an individual, be proud of it. Choose the right path, handle things your way. Believe in what you do, believe in what is right. Don't run away in fear, stand up even if it means showing your tears. Fight for yourself, don't lose your voice over the crowds.    Okay, there's much more but I can't find where I scribbled it all to...

      English sucked. I messed up both papers, comprehension and writing. The texts in the ocmprehension were damn stupid.  How was I suppose to answer the questions when the passages were so idiotic?  Science was quite easy  except a few questions. I made a few careless mistakes though.  I can be so stupid.

       Hmmm...    Well, my   summer holidays   have began!!    Hmmm...      Not that anything has change. That is.    My mom is still forcing me to sleep early and wake up early.    Incredibly annoying.      I got a ridicculous paper cut from my piano book today.    On my left pinky too.      I don't have anything inteligent to say.    In fact, I hardly ever do.      At the moment, I'm wishing for ultimate privacy, silence and time and space to be alone.    Those, I rarely ever get since the people in this household (except me, well of course except me) never seem to know privacy. My mom would just walk in anytime. So will my brother and sister and any other person in the house.       It's not that I have anything to hide but most of the time I don't like to be *  surprised  * by unexpected *  visits  *.       I have piano class.   Bleh.
