      I guess we'll see if all our (meaning NOT a certain individual that starts with a "B") hard work pays off!!  I don't mean to sound like the outing is just a horrible thing, because it most certainly is not!!  It's just the fact that people aren't doing what they committed to and it didn't go as smoothly as planned :(  The thing is I love doing this, I'm happy to be doing it, I just want to feel comfortable with everything.  I guess it's a learning process and not too mention I'm not a golf scramble pro.  Oh well it'll all come together and guess what, if it doesn't I'll just get super inebriated Saturday night to numb it all ;)  Oops, I'll be getting uber drunk regardless.  Soooo, it seems that a certain someone labeled a certain drunk phone call a "booty call" WHAT!?!?!?!  You try and be friends with someone and you and some girlfriends get a bit tipsy, make a few calls to recruit more people to get tipsy at the Green Door with you and it's a "booty call", puh-lease, grow up!!  Although, hmmm, well we won't go there, somethings should just be left to the people that know the full story.   Question of the day: How the hell do I lose 15lbs. by November 10th????

      I will quit my job and send in bagels, but ONLY jalepeno bagels AND no cream cheese.  That's what me and my "lottery partner" have decided, what better way to say thanks then sh*tty bagels and nothing to top them with ;)  Anyways, Happy Frigging Monday.  When I do hit it big, I will give all my close friends the name of the bar we open in Key West with directions and a plane ticket (round trip of course, I don't want a bunch of freeloaders ;)  I hate to be such a grumpy human being, but I've hit my limit with ignorant, lazy, take all the credit, self-centered people.  It's not as if I'm looking for a pat on the back (yep I'm still on a tangent about the golf outing) for doing anything, I would rather go without credit, but what pisses me off is the motherscratchers (or motherscratcher) that are taking credit for crap they DID NOT do.  Oh well, life's too short to be angry...  Moving away from the grumpy Jenn...  So, I went to visit my cousins this weekend in St. Clair Shores, I love my family!  When we get together, something crazy always happens.  We are all fun loving booze bags :)  We hung out on the boats all Saturday evening, took the dingy out for a cruise, got crazy on some Scooters, good times!  My grandpa was happy we all got together, it's been tough on him since my grandma passed away, but we have a super close family to help everyone through it!  Not too mention we tend to numb ourselves over scotch...  JUST KIDDING, we aren't always drinking!!  (Just when we get together...)  My cousins fiance had her bridal shower on Sunday, I am so extremely happy for Matt & Michelle they were totally made for eachother!  There are only a few of us single VanDerMaas' left the pressure is going to move on to someone else...  Yikes.  See us VanDerMaas' sure do like a good weddin' ;)  Actually we just like any type of party, we're just very sociable people.

      Yep ONLY 89 days until I'm drinking like a fish, talking like a sailor (hmm talking to a sailor wouldn't hurt either), frying like a piggy in the sun, and just plain RELAXING with no worries, no kiddies and no one to tell me what the f*ck to do!!!  WooHoo!!!  I CANNOT wait!!  Here's my only dilemma, to look up "Keys Jeff" while I'm down there or not...  He was cute, a fireman (oops...) and a fishing captain, which equals a great tan and a nice body ;)  We'll see, knowing me I'll get tipsy and try to get a hold of him, so typical of me :(  Someone needs to take away my phone and screen my calls when I get a beer or few in me!!  I have been stricken with some sort of flu today :(  I think there was something weird in those damn beers, hmm...  Definitely a Famous Taco buffet day!  My eyes are swollen shut, my car is not where it is supposed to be (with me at work), and my head is yelling at me.  I need to get with it!!!  I had a good time though, good friends, cheap beer what more can you ask for!?!?!?  So I get my BuddhaCakes (aka Preston, Big P) back today, I miss him SO much!!  I'm sure my dad and stepmom are ready for a break ;)  He can be quite the character, very bullheaded and stubborn (not sure where he gets that from...).  Unfortunately, he leaves for his daddy time tomorrow, but I know Matt misses him just as much!  Mommy gets to be a booze bag again at Venetian Night in G.P., I love whooping it up with my family, ALWAYS a good time!!

      This summer is flying by!!!  It SUCKS.  I had a fun weekend in Lexington, where else would I be ;)  We took Preston tubing, he had a blast!  As soon as I get the pictures and figure out how to do it I will post them.  Big P is camping for the week with his Grammie Kim, Papa Gerrit, Uncle Ben and Uncle Brian, mommy can't go because she gets to work, yippy...   I learned how to drive the boat this weekend, so as soon as I'm a bit more comfortable we'll have to get all the girlies out.  Now that would be a sight!  Lexington had an awesome Art Fair, I ended up buying some pretty nifty jewelry.  I miss living there so much, someday I'll be back have no fear!!!  My rich husband (TBD) will have to buy me a cottage, trust me I have it all mapped out ;)  There was a pretty drunken mess of a beer tent (too many VanDerMaas' in town)...  I do the most retarded things after a few drinks (most of my friends already know this), what would possess someone to take more than a couple pulls of Jack and my old friend Morgan at 4am????  Alot of peer pressure from "Married Michael" and gang is what I will blame it on. Sunday I met up with my long lost friend Christy (I've missed you girlie!!!) for some Bloody Mary's (much needed see above), beer and some charity softball.  Was pretty funny watching the "ex's" compete against one another (you had to be there).  We were home early and I passed out on my couch for a good 6 hours, oops... The next couple weeks are going to be mostly devoted to get this golf outing ready to go!!  I know it'll all come together, but I still can't help but stress out about it, that's just my nature I guess.  Why do people have to procrastinate all the freaking time, why!?!?!?!?!

      Christy you've gotten me addicted to this!!!  Damn you!!!  I think it's a great way to keep everyone up to date, since I suck at staying in touch!!  So this is my practice run to see if I know what the hell I am doing!!
