        We look so 'maalaala mo kaya' like in here.  We're supposed to appear as sophisticated and sexy.    It's hard to project, though... i'm sorry girls but i think we appear rather funny.  We had tons of giggles looking at the outcome, though and that's better than our goal.   Au and Annie looked like mom and child here.  Dey and I were laughin at it still on our way home riding the MRT. Yeah, we're giggling like lil girls in the crowded train all because of au and annie's dove commercial pose.    Okay, if you take a look at each of us individually, we look ok.  It's chaotic when you put all of us in one shot, Ugh!  But i've pretty pretty friends.  I remember having disagreements with Ann and Annie and Dey took her side.  Except for the sweet au au, she was the one i had lunch with when the rest of the witches (he he) decided to ignore me like i am the kontrabida.  Maybe I was a bit insensitive then.  heck, maybe a bit bitchy!  Just remembering the times, it's over now.  Ann said i should update the people i'd tell my 'fights' with, like how i told john what them witches did to me.  I am so easy to talk to and i forgive easily but John's like, 'you're not friends with em anymore, right?"  I guess every good relationship would have 'downs' like what happened.  Heck, everything's forgotten and i love my girls to the bits.

       232 2323549;;8498ot1lsi">  Aaw, the seventeeners...all grown up.  I was a wall flower (or just a wall) in college.  It didn't matter, though.  I've spent college with the best girls!  Gladys is a law practicing bitch (she'll like to be called that!), Hazel is ever so charming and funny!, Ruthie's always exude the witty and wild on the inside gurlie for me, Enjo is the 'achiever'- embarking on the family life so early, i'm jealous of her little Faith Anne!   232 2323549;:;347ot1lsi">  Having dinner at Gerri's in Makati.  Hazel just came back from a seminar in Cagayan de Oro.  She's an Asst Training Manager or something like that and she travels all over the Philippines a looot!  She met her 1st bf in her Baguio trip.  The guy was sorta psycho though.  Guys like that are so easy to get over.  Oh, ruthie's guy is in China...yeah, a chidikongkwoyla guy.  They're still technically together but no clear future plans whatsoever.  I can so relate to that!  Oh, oh, I forgot to mention...this was Enjo's treat...her 28th birthday!   232 2323549;:8:85ot1lsi">  The ordeal of being friends with an OC-OC he he.  Gladys, the 'hey-you-beautiful-pinay' uptight lawyer can be funny sometimes!  Well, we make fun of her when she'd go irate on us!  She's this normal smart woman who wants to be rich and successful.  She likes travelling around the Phil Island too.  Too bad i dont get to join her, my lazy ass can't get up when she'd ask.  She's like, 'wag mo boboyprenin yan ha, di kayo bagay' -- she has a point but it's kinda superficial if you percieve love like that...hehe...yuch, magmarunong ba ako?   232 2323549;;5584ot1lsi">  Birthday Lady -- such a supple skin still...i'm so jealous of how creamy her skin is he he...i remember she used to complain on how she thinks she aint pretty! HELLOOO...she's ever so pretty for me, hope she gets that in her brain please!   232 2323549;:8794ot1lsi">  Our little 'support group' -- Hazel's really glowing these days!   232 2323549;;6547ot1lsi"> Ruthie's back in school...she's finishing law.  My sister's friend said she's so cool like getting through the strenuous 'recitation' after workin in the day.  She'd answer correctly without consulting her notes. Prouda her there!

      It's really our first time to 'come out'...    Ann and Au looked real pretty here    Ann, Au and me after a sumptuous meal-at least for them, i think my chicken was bland, ugh!    Dey, Me, Annie and Ann don't look at all sober -- pier0ne, the fort    Japayuki's to go...note to self: make up doesn't make me pretty, it made me look a baduff,as john would say    A bit wasted...not really...it's not what it looks like    havin a fun time with the girls    Famous Dey look      It's the flash from the camera...they ain't drunk (yeah, right!)

      My father said we should've taken the picture of HK and China not of ourselves.   232;=92 2323565339748ot1lsi"> We didn't get anything from this jewelry shop, after 15 mins, we lost interest he he.  We don't have much parties to attend to anyway, if so, we'd borrow from mother instead.   232;=92 23235653636;8ot1lsi"> Outside Jackie Chan's shop,my mother would have enjoyed it there...the jewelry are not that expensive and has a life time guarantee.  The chinese sales people speak tagalog.  Fave word: maganda, guapo, pasalubong.  Oh, stressing on feng shui and how lucky one could get, naturally pinoys would like that.  Our tourist mates bought boxes and boxes, guess we need luck!   232;=92 2323565333:56ot1lsi"> With Hongkonger, i noticed he liked to talk to Maling better since i yakked on him a lot...what can i do, i got excited about 'hk night'.  Oh, when i offered coins to pay the fare, i was giving hongkonger 'funhouse' , maling's arcade coins!     232;=92 2323565334;53ot1lsi" The bus there's my dream bus.  No people to hit my elbows when they pass by the aisle.  No vendors of garlic peanuts in a pail.  No bugs.  No kundoctor.  No sticky floors. No traffic jams.  No suffocating bus smoke getting inside  the bus. No stopping anywhere as there are designated bus stops.  No stinkin whatever.    Anyway, i wish i didn't wear that pants ugh! My fashion sense getting worse.   232;=92 232356535;343ot1lsi" After a nice and sumptuous cantonese lunch.  My sister loved the duck, i think it's too greasy and meatless.  I loved the pancit with clams, simot ko pa sha when everyone was done eating, my sister got embarrassed some.  I look drunk here.  Mebbe the chinese tea.  My sister think it tastes like soil.   232;=92 2323565336964ot1lsi" By the Victoria Harbour.  This is how i've always pictured HK.  We didn't get to ride the ferry boat since it's kinda late.  It's pretty much like Baywalk in Roxas Boulevard without much noise.  The baywalk's breezier though, it was too darn hot there even if it's the night time.  Lights were fabulous!     232;=92 232356548;63:ot1lsi" Mall in Kowloon Tong is like a bigger version of Shangrila Mall.  But like in any other malls, i enjoyed observing hongkongers and tourists.  I can hear my father saying, how can i tell if that's a mall, all i see are your faces.   232;=92 2323565524339ot1lsi" Father, look there's the double deck bus on the background.   232;=92 232356533:7:5ot1lsi" Maling and I enjoyed the HK airport! Free internet use even.  Lotsa things to see.  Sassy girl's on every post, she's popular in HK, she's lovely as ever!  Oh, tour guide left us.  We had our pictures taken in every corner of the airport. It's real huge. (oh, did i mention cute guys?)    232;=92 2323565546296ot1lsi" Park in China.  Nice grass.  Tired.  Roaming around that park is equivalent to 5 hours in the gym.
