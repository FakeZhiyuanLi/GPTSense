      Today I went on an LRT adventure and then I watched Shrek 2. OMG that movie is SO funny! haha its so great - Puss in Boots is the BEST!  Ha ha! Maybe I have an affinity for cats now I dunno but OMG Puss in Boots Rocks my Socks! They based his character on Zorro - man I love that cat!  Anyway from the beginning. I missed the bus at first today - whoops my bad. Oh well I think I also phoned Tom by accident. On my cell phone. Whoopsies. Yeh - I forgot to lock it. (i'm sorry!) anyway what was i talking about... Oh right my GRAND LRT ADVENTURE!   It started at the university - then it snaked across to the governement center (which is across the river) and then to other stations and it ended at Churchill station. whoo hoo! and it kinda ends there. But then it goes in rewind. because i took it back the the university after that day... and it was more eventfull because chris broke a bylaw... hahaha yeh - that was eventful  -till next time

      I think my English teacher is paranoid with other people doing other work in english class. - he kept walking around today looking for not worker people dudes. i though that was funny becuase he normally doesn't do that. hmmm... what else is funny. Oh i know what's funny. Mr "english teacher" stands behind our "asian group" because we talk and its great. hmm what else  Oh today is the nineteenth by the way i decided to like ...not write? i dunno i'm really tired right now and its late. I'm analyzing a poem and my silly goose... nevermind he came back... hehe he's so awesome! i love him! okay yeh i should go though.. bye!

      You know what? I got two phone calls today - from Sammy!  Sammy told me to call Andy: "Andy Pandy" - but I don't know why! haha yup! And oh and um... Midterms are scary  Oh um I know! I was just talking to nick ,and the words that I most often use are "good", "great" and "awesome!" because I am either good, great, or awesome! - if anyone has ever noticed..(although its hard not to notice.) hehe ohh and we told everyone about Nick and I going out. Chu took it rather well - haha a little over hyper but quite well! And then Willy was like "no surprise there." and then Kau was like...Well there's a lot to what Kau said. Here it is according to Nick --> and if memory serves well:  Nick walked into his hallway and one of his friends is like "Hey Who's your new  girlfriend ?" and Nick figured that chu has been talking about it. And then Kau is like "you have a new girlfriend? Already?" and Nick's like "yea" and then Kau was like "do I know her?" and nick was like "yea it's Donna" and then kau is like - well lets just say I was worried of the awkwardness of it where two friends meet who meet two more friends and one of the original friends adds a friend and then the two friends that the two original friends have met pulls another guy into the loop. And then the other new guy and one of the original friends starts going out --> although the outcome was awesome! hehe they have taken it quite well, quite well indeed! And its awesome because its almost like people expected it to happen, without us even realizing it.   Come to think of it, it's kind of scary - in a good way.

      Evil. Well, I can't say that because math is okayish - I don't mind it, I just don't like it much. You know how many people have asked to see my "non existent" math portfolio? A lot and you know what? I don't have to do a math portfolio because I'm not in IB math - haha I've disappointed so many people with my not math IB-iness.  another thing. Math is hard to do without a graphing calculator. Mine broke... Twice. haha maybe I should stop abusing it. haha well the first one I didn't break - the second one I did break. But that's beside the point... I still need a graphing calculator to study for my midterm - unless I can do a whole bunch of math tonight and then graph stuff tomorrow afternoon (double math) and then hope I do well on the midterm... *ahem* 3/4 term test. haha you know what's funny?... Nothing that's what!  Oh yea I made a funny. Anyway I have to study for math. Bye bye! (where would I be without spell check?)

       TODAY  was more then I could eve thought just one night would be. Oh My it was so Great! Actually, no, it was more then great... It was the most amazing night I've had in a long time. Ha! It no wonder I love him so much. He makes me feel all great and special inside and I love that. He's so shy, but to me, he's everything in a word... Perfect.  Haha.. I guess I should tell you who I'm talking about - I'm talking about: Nick! My Silly Goose - Two birds of a feather. He and I had the most awesome time together, and I wish that time would just stop and we'd forever be there in the same moment. Wow, people think I may have fallen head over heels, but I truly think that Nick is my other puzzle piece.  Anyway - about my night. Well we met at four at the bridge in west ed, the one over by TNT in West Edmonton Mall Chinatown. Haha man was I nervous, haha oh well he was there and that was all that mattered. Well, we went to get bubble tea and He's such a gentleman. He paid for Everything today - Everything. He paid for Bubble tea, paid for supper, paid for the movie tickets - A gentleman. It was great, although I kept questioning if he was sure he got it all. -being Donna you know. Anyway, we walked around hand in hand and yea he was walking behind me and I was holding his hands - and us being both klutzes well... haha we were CAREFUL! We went "browsing" haha anyway we ummmmmmmmmmmm...... Right we walked through Galaxyland and stuff and yea ^__^  And then, and then, and then: we went for supper! Supper man Supper! haha we went to the old spaghetti factory. The old spaghetti factory was so awesome! Haha even though we didn't eat much - because we were slightly full - we had so much fun together. haha we talked and well I talked because he's so shy, but yea hehe we laughed so much. We also left a $3.00 tip - not the best but its not bad saying that its 10 percent of out meal.   and then we went to the movie. Oh my - Van Helsing was soooo awesome. haha scary but awesome. Haha I'm so glad he was with me. I was soo scared. I must have jumped like eight million times before the movie actually got going. haha I held on to his hands all movie long and everytime a scary part came up, I would bury my head into his jacket and squeeze his hands. Haha, He's got strong hands they are so great. Because I'd squeeze then and he'd just hold tighter - I felt so loved. haha and then yea it was so beautiful.(no we weren't snogging, I actually know what the movie is about) - but yea - No kiss if you are wondering though. haha so many opportunities for one too. ^__^ - oh well... Still I had a Wonderful time with him. *sigh*

      Here's a big coincidence... I was at school today till like 5:00 pm because of leadership. (that I so wanted to skip but didn't because I don't know why.) Me and Tyler and Kathy and Will are walking around the school - this is about 4:30 ish - anyway we're in the parking lot and yea I see the ME Lazerte Van sitting in the parking lot. So I'm like -"Hey! That's the ME Lazerte Van!" and then my mind jumps to Nick! Haha! And yea I was thinking -man if he played soccer that would mean that he'd be here. Yea! Anyway I was like "I said I'd phone him..."  So yea me being me and this is  Nick  we're talking about man. Anyway I decide that I want to Phone him! Anyway I have his number on my cell phone because well come on think about it... Haha! So I dial it up and you know what I get? A  BUSY  signal! Haha!! Yea so I kind of didn't phone him for fear or the Busy signal again...  Anyway I'm talking to him (right now too) and yea he's like "I phoned you but you weren't home" and here I am I was like " hey I phoned you and you were busy" and I have caller id so I go ID his call ... He phoned at about 4:40 ish...  I phoned at about 4:40ish - which means that we phoned each other at the same time! Haha! What a coincidence hey? Yea... That's my story.. Bye now!

      You know what's funny? I sleep like a rock. I also get to bed pretty late - which isn't good because I'm always tired - and then I'm always tired (as was said before... But I don't know why I said it again...) But then I get to school and All that jazz, and Dan is being... Well Dan, the guys are just are like all "drone" like first thing in the morning and then you see me. Now as you probably can tell, I'm one of those people who are like extremely off the wall weird sort of hyper chick - here I am all really tired, but I have so much energy and its like "wow... She's got a lot of energy for this time in the morning." and it blows my mind how I'm So awake-like in the morning.  Anyway that's beside the point. This morning I woke up really late - like 8:30 late. Ha Ha and yea I don't know if Matichuk saw me at all today - cause I kind of skipped the last ten minutes of class because I was sleeping and I got to school late... But then honestly (I hate skipping / missing class) if you were late and there were ten minutes left in class, would you go in say hi and face the wrath of Matichuk? - He's really scary when it comes to people being late, because people are always late to his class... But I mean no one is like 50 minutes late to his classes - haha I love bio too... hmm which reminds me - I should check if I have soil for a plant lab... erm yea..

      Wow - I kind of forgot about this.... Ha ha I can't even keep a written journal no less a blog. Hn. I just got oral surgery done though... Ha ha so I guess this is where you can find me for a week. If you really needed to find me... And if you wanted to find me too. Anyway, let's find a new topic shall we?  Hey New topic! Teeth! I hate oral surgery. It hurts. And there are too many antibiotics and drugs to deal with. hmm.. Which reminds me that I need to take my antibiotics soon.. ick and I hate codeine! I can't wait to be able to eat solid foods again. Yeh, oh well I get out of most things with this excuse... Though I'd like to be able to go outside and get a nice tan.. Sigh... Soon though. Very soon.  I saw The Terminal with Nick last week. It was so awesome. I cried twice during that movie. It was a good Sad movie. Yeh - go see it.  And I broke my key board slidey things so I'm typing on my lap right now. Its interesting because... Its doesn't click as much. But it isn't as stable so I'm gonna .. Yea... Crooked but it works. Yeh. well i'm out for the night - see ya!

      The Gravitron is a harsh ride. Haha - Too many "g's" acting on one person... It was tough. Somewhat too spiny for me... But fun. At one point there was too much pressure where it was rather hard trying to breathe. And then after that the only people capable of standing on their two feet ready for more was Dan. Where as Ben looked a little sick, and Nick.. Well lets just say that  it was not his cup of tea. Just like the drop of fear isn't mine. They forced me on it. And I wasn't very "happy happy joy joy" about it. It's too High! I hate heights. And yea. But ironically I love the Ferris wheel. I don't know there is something about that ride that makes me feel relaxed and stuff. It's a great ride.  Oh and the carnie couldn't guess my weight. Which was kind funny I guess... pshh I fooled him! Hahah! Go Donna!

      Okay, after a close to 2 hour bus ride around the north side of Edmonton, I have come to the conclusion of this... That's a long bus ride. I mean it too. Okay, so we didn't exactly know where we were going, but we went on an adventure today. It was very spur of the moment and haha fun. We figured out how long the bus rides are from here to there. Anyway enough jabbering... I really need to learn how to tell stories.   Anyway at Southgate Sondy, Whitney and I were going to go home and like well do movie night on a weekday. So we are waiting for the bus and haha the 9&nbsp;Northgate just happens to be sitting in front of us. One of the cool "slinky" buses. Anyway we're like "let go for a ride on the bus, it'll be an adventure!" So yeh we went on&nbsp;a ride. So we're just sitting there on the bus at southgate waiting for our adventure to begin, still debating, but for sure going to go on a long needed&nbsp;adventure that summer school had postponed. So the bus leaves the terminal and Sondra's like "Are you sure you want to go on this?" and we both pointed out that it was her idea. So we're going on an adventure. "Wow this bus is really long!"   Not only was the bus long, we were going through downtown when we started to get bored. Yeh, when people say that this is a long bus ride... Believe them. We get to Kingsway garden mall and we had a chance to get off and go home, but we didn't for some strange reason. so we're going along still... still riding the nine. and then we get to northgate finally after watchin what type of people got on to the bus. yeh there were alot of people all shapes and SIZES! (Bad thought, bad thought! Mind caving in.. Oh no!)&nbsp; Yeh so we get to Northgate and by this time... lunch has had a little time to sit in our stomachs and nature calls. So we get into Northgate Center... And the thing is like... DEAD! So we are aimlessly wandering around the mall that is full of pretty much just air looking for a washroom. We walked all the way from one end to another looking for a food court, because food courts always have washrooms. Well we didn't find one. Luckily we found a "mall directory." You know what we&nbsp;found out? The Food court is on the Upper Level... and there's only one washroom!&nbsp;GAH! It was... Well unbelievable... So an empty mall with a food court upstairs and 1 washroom. Though the washroom was quite nice.   &nbsp;We left after that. And we took the 12... Which is just like the 30. The longest most pointless bus ride in the world.. At least the 30 goes places that are like... in need of buses where as the 12 is like... Empty residential areas.&nbsp; Anyway we eventually got home... 4 hours after we got out of school. yeh - great stuff hey?

       Hello everyone! How's it going? Today is too hot so&nbsp;I got bored. Moo. And yea&nbsp;I was gonna go to a moovie but then plans were mooved and screwed up to there is no moovie today. Bummer hey? Wow that last sentence was a run on sentence... Good moove Donna.&nbsp;So yeh I'm sitting here not mooving really except my fingers and I am incredibly bored to bits.&nbsp;I just filled up my waterbottle though outside the clouds are mooving and its making things all cool.     &nbsp;  I hope it rains tonight. Moo. It'll be good if the clouds do moove in with some mooving rains tonight. Not epic rains of torture, but rain would be good. Oh look, the air is mooving now. That makes wind doesn't it. Anyway this isn't mooving anywhere so I'm gonna go moove some where else. Maybe in front of the mooving air coming in from the window.

       Hey you know what's funny? NOTHING!!! hahahahahah! Oh I believe I have gone insane due to heat and boredom.&nbsp; Not a very good combination in fact its almost lethal! ... Almost at any rate. Though you do start to question people's judgments when they become all... Like this. Weird and insane... Not that I'm not already weird and insane and people aren't all weird and insane with me because some people who are weird and insane are cool weird and insane.  &nbsp;  anyway enough about being weird and insane. It's just occurred to me that I am a super fast reader. Though there are other people who are probably faster than me, I read a whole novel in 5 hours yesterday. 355 pages. Cover to cover. All done in 5 hours.. And I had started it that morning and picked it up here and there during the day. And then while I was volunteering I finished homework and then did it all. Yes! I rock my socks! Mwahahahah! and i think that i've gone quite insane because of it.     The fan is going and the day is coming to an end and&nbsp;I know why the sky is blue!&nbsp;Anyway... Bye bye! &nbsp;

       Our diploma marks came in. Do you know how scary this is? Its like beyond scary. I'm so terrified that I'm not scared of this. Though it's kinda funny...Because I already opened it. So there really should be not that big of an emergency here right?? - I passed just 2 % under my goal. Which sucks because&nbsp;2 whole percent sucks like a sucks thing.   Updating the past while since I've written. Summer school sucks - though I have a very awesome cool mark of 91 - 4th highest in the class. So I'm happy. Which is more than I can say of my math mark... Oh well. I never exactly did that bad in math. I made a 15 percent raise in like 5 months right? Yea so school is a bummer.   Though it does have its perks I must say. haha me and ban and Dan and Sondy and nick have bonded as a group better over the weeks. I see nick Monday to Friday from like 8:00 to about 2:30. And yea I'm having fun. But you know what's funny?     &nbsp;   Me and&nbsp;Chu were talking today and we got on to the subject of university. So yea we're talking about what we'd be doing and than he went on about how the biggest thing that has kept us together would be our biggest divider. You know its funny how no one realizes that. Its like ... So not obvious. But think: We've spent most of our lives together in the same classes - or somewhat, we've spent lunches together, spent time together out of school, Spent money together even. Its interesting that University will be the force that may separate us from one another.     &nbsp;   But your base group will always be your base group no matter what. The people who you call to when you want to do something at lunch, the people who you can hang out with,the people who are just there for you 24/7 as you know that will. Sure a&nbsp;new school means like&nbsp;a million students and like new friends. But I mean how close can you really get to another person who is fresh out of high school hanging out with the old crew on campus. The chances of that may be very slim.. But hey I still want to&nbsp; hang out with the old people that I love to hang out with from school and stuff.&nbsp; yea that was my argument.     &nbsp;   But I know that most of us won't fall out of loop with each other - I just know we won't... Right?

      You know what the worst thing is? Getting lemon juice in your eye. That's like... Not good. Haha yea - It's funny but it not because it hurts like...Okay imagine licking your wounds and pouring salt on them. Or a really small but really deep paper cut. Though it wasn't me who got lemon juice in the eye. It was Nick! Yea - but he's okay though. Anyway the story goes...  His birthday was on the Sunday - July 11th, and unfortunately (or fortunately) I was busy - so we couldn't get together that night. (I'll explain the fortunately part later and why I couldn't later.) So to make it up to him - I just HAD to take him out or else I'd feel really bad how we kind planned stuff and then stuff got cancelled. Yea so anyway I took him out for lunch today! Hehe what a pair we make. haha - I can never say That we haven't tripped and fallen because if I did than five minutes later guess what'll we do? - trip and fall! Anyway back to the story - one of the noodles of my Cajun Chicken Alfredo, Slipped off my fork spraying sauce at my forehead ..Some thing got on to my eyebrow. Anyway five minutes later, he's squeezing a lemon and the lemon decided to take revenge. Take revenge as in spraying lemon juice back into Nick's eye. It wasn't good. Yea - but he;s okay though.   Anyway the reason why I couldn't see him on Sunday was because I had a double shift at the hospital last week. One on Friday and than one on Sunday. Though I did get my work done on Sunday pretty fast. Also its kind of a good thing that me and nick never got together because the weather decided to take a turn for the worst. Holy man did anyone see how hard it rained on Sunday?  IT was like the Niagara falls of all storms. Not to mention the big lighting thunder and tornado warnings all around the city. It was scary - we had to drive through it. Also you know what? Edmonton was a lake and archly road was one of those points that was like... Whoa that's deep.

      Well, The week has almost let up and soon the weekend will come upon us and be..Weekend-Y. It seems so long since Monday came along and now it has surely been a very slow week and stuff but its almost Friday right??  Okay cool because since tomorrow is Friday and Monday was about three weeks back, why does it seem to have a long time lapse in between??? Maybe it because summer is suppose to be warm, sunny and care free. Where as right now, well not right now because the sun is out, we have had three days of straight cold and rain, and plus early mornings... The whole prospect of school right now seems very ... Not relaxing, nor is it any fun like a summer day is suppose to be.  anyway now that, that is done. I should go study, but as you all know I'm not going to go study. I'm actually probably going to go and I don't know, do something else...

      Hey its August now! And it looks like a repeat of Sunday's storm like three weeks back. That was a bad bad storm. So anyway right now I'm sitting here typing while listening to the melodies that the storm has to play out for us. The low rumble of thunder, the soft patter of the rain. Bliss isn't it? I like the rain. Okay! What makes more sense: "Oh look, thunder" or "Oh hear, thunder"? I think "Oh look, thunder" personally because it just rolls off the tongue.  Anyway me and Sondy are gonna rent a movie later. Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen! Yea! Haha its gonna be fun fun fun! Ooh! Mean Girls was a good good movie! Tina Fey is awesome, and haha it was funny. Very Stereotypical but hah so good. Yeh, Its summer, the month of Chick Flicks have dawned upon us and now we must go make fun of stupid movies. Haha won't that be great? Anyway - going to go rent them / eat supper - what ever comes first... bye!
