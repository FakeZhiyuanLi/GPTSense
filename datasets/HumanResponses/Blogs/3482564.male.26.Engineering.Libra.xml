      I hope this will capture and reflect the latest experience in my career.  Right now I have given it a name that define the beginning of my career.  I hope one day it will evolve into a broader envelope from the enriching experiences I receive on a daily basis.

      When things don't go according to plan, step back and make sure you've cover all the small changes before moving forward.  Try to explain the anomaly.  Be confident about your judgement.  That's how most brilliant people shine, they believe in themselves.

      This book is superb in describing how most large companies stumble in fostering innovation. I am totally amazed by the amount of research and case studies that goes into this very book. I suppose this is how most profs at the Havard school of business approach the class room. Glad to have picked up this great work.  The Innovator's Dilemma by Clayton M. Christensen  ISBN 0-06-052199-6

      Here is a very good passage from a book I'm reading.  Since most of us are engineers it's worth sharing with the rest of you - David.   Solving problems is a high-visibility process; preventing problems is low-visibility.  This is illustrated by an old parable.  In ancient China there was a family  of healers, one of whom was known throughout the land and employed as a physician to a great lord.  The physician was asked which of his family was the most skillful healer.  He replied, "I tend to the sick and dying with drastic and dramatic treatments, and on occasion someone is cured and my name gets out among the lords."  "My elder brother cures sickness when it just begins to take root, and his skills are known among the local peasants and neighbors."  "My eldest brother is able to sense the spirit of sickness and eradicate it before it takes form.  His name is unknown outside our home."  Great [engineers/developers] recognize that their [work/code] will be flawed, so instrument their [work/code], and create [design tools/toolchains] designed to sniff out problems  before  a symptom even exists.

      Do you know more Chineses died in WWII than Jews? Do you know there were more than seventeen millions WWII casualties in China? More than 90% of those are civilians slaughtered by the Japanese invaders. The death toll is the second highese below Germany and higher than America. While most country has their WWII memorial day, there is no such date in China because of the political circumstance. Someone is in the process of collecting millions of signature to support the idea of naming September the 18th as the Chinese WWII Memorial Day, please spend a minute to sign up in this website:  urlLink http://www.wwgc.cc/qianming/gcqm.asp  This is a simplified Chinese website.

It takes a week to get your tires but it worth the wait.  I save around a hundred buck. You get a big discount right of the bat, shipping is $10x4 and there is no PST!!!  Once the tires arrived, bring them to Costco to enjoy another saving $10x4 for installation.

      Hi,  Anyone interested in some building tours on Saturday (June 5)?  Some buildings that interest me are:  Canada Post National Control Centre (reservation required,  only a few space left !!) Canada Post Ottawa Mail Processing Plant Ottawa Jail Ottawa Citizen (the printing press room is described as "the size of a football field") Lemieux Island Water Purification Plant (the island along the Parkway) Supreme Court NRC Lab Government House  Most buildings open from 10am to 4pm on Saturday.  If you plan to go, let me know NOW.  Some tours require advance registration.  If you have other buildings that interest you, feel free to add to the list.  urlLink    It should be a fun day!

      All right! Now the ever famous Ottawa Bunch (aka Ottawa Group) is now moving on to bigger and better things. We know have our own web central to express our gratitude, emotions, feelings, philosophies, principles, morals, ethics, pet peeves, and any other unstable and traumatizing emotion that a person may experience. Please do not be alarmed by some of the postings that may appear...we may be crazy but we're not insane...not when we were last checked out anyway... ;-)  Special thanks goes out to our technical guru, David, who I'm sure laboured tirelessly through the night to set this up. ;-) We can only imagine the trauma and the sacrifice that he put out in order to create an outlet for this crazy bunch of people. hahaha Thanks a lot man! :-)  All right, the stage is set...is the world ready for us? Well ready or not, here we come!  Feel the storm...it's coming.

      Rumour has it that Paulo and Henry will be moving out their apartment and close to signing a deal with our rental office.  To see if this is for real, make sure to tune in on the Ottawa Bunch late breaking news update on the hour...

      Not sure if everyone know about Charles' new Acura EL.  It has a beautiful rally blue exterior and luxurious black leather seats with wood trims.  One very elegant piece of machinery.  Check out his new car next time you drop by!

      Without our extremely dedicated and skilled organizers, we wouldn't have such a fun filled exciting weekend.  The delicious food prepared were unmatched by any who dares to compare.  The real-time event/expense management is world-class.  We should take this moment to applaud the time, effort and generosity given by these relentless individuals.  I am sure pictures of the trip will be posted shortly.  Thanks again to all who helped and participated.

       urlLink Hondata K Pro . This thing can read every possible sensor output the ECU receives (40 in total) and can program VTEC switch points, Cam advance/retard, Fuel and ignition for a vast set RPM intervals. It's a bit on the pricey end though... personally I'm really only interested in all the sensor readings and how the engine cope with the environment. I don't fancy screwing up my factory engine tuning.

       urlLink Rogers PVR . Finally the long awaited Tivo service offered by Rogers. Rogers is getting extremely smart these days, maybe it's a good idea to invest in them so when they finally take over the holy grail of wired communications - combined video, voice and data, they will be unbeatable.  Bell has some serious catch up to do.

      Jetsgo.com - Fly to the states for $1  Right now, you have until the 8th of August to book. Your flight to the states is only $1, and you pay the regular return fare, which is still really cheap. A trip to New York would cost you about $110 return. That's really good.   urlLink http://www.jetsgo.com/en/046buckUSA.shtm
