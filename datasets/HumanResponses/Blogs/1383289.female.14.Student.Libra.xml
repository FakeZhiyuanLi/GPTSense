      last night was the 1st time a drank. it was an ok way to start the new year. it was crzy. i drank a lot actually. like most of this carmel stuff...and sum of this arbor mist wine stuff...and like a couple sips of corona. it was ok. like i had fun being drunk. but not when u throw up and have a headache in the morning.   i duno. last night i spent the night at kellys and when we woke up at like 4 we just talked and i felt really bad about drinking. i feel like im a dissapointment to all my non drinking friends and family. tear tear. i was just talking to my homie darren and he seems really upset at me. i dont want him to feel like that. i feel like i betrayed him or whatever. i hate feeling that way. grr. i dont know what im gona do with myself. i know im not gona do it for a while.

      yeah! our 1st game is in a week! im so excited to cheer and dance again! foot ball season seems like it was so loong ago. ah! im getting nervous. bc i duno what to expect. shiver its gona be crazy ... yeah but im excited. lol. i sound like a loser right now i know. but i luv being out there and actually caring about sumthing. teehee. teehee. oh my. im excited. hehehehe. basketball season is gona be fun. the games gona go by really fast but its ok. we have a lot more of them though. so its all good. mmhm. and the dances are so much more laid back. theres a lot of more hip/ass action. more body rolls, ass shaking...its all good. hahaa. yea i can preform for all the hot guys there for their game or whatever. lol. my dream come true! lol. i hope i dont mess up though. i think ill do ok...i practice a lot.  oh my... i brought in music i thought would be good for this one dance (hit that by the offspring) but it wasnt good enough for my team ...they wanted sumthing more "sensual" says my coach. they want a girl to sing it. and they want basiclly a slutty "take my clothes off" song. it kinda bothers me. bc its like if you dont like my music then find ur own. and i dont want to do only hip hop/ pop songs. it gets old and predictable. it is..we should mix it up a little. you know. oh i hope they know that hip hop isnt the only type of music to dance too...even though its the most obvious bc it has rythm and all that.  dont get me wrong...i luv hip hop. thats what i was brought up to listen to..kinda...if that makes sense. its gr8. like thats the 1st kinda of music i ever listen to. besides the spice girls of course. lol. but i think we shouldnt just stick to one type of music. but whatever iguess...just as long as i get to dance i am happy. i think i was born to be a cheerleader or dancer. bc this is when im happy. like im never mad at a game. just being there...as if i made a difference if we won or not...feeling like im part of the game, part of the out come of it...it gives me a rush. i feel a big accomplishment after i preform. like ive over came my fear. i have many fears....of rejection...of failure. but when i finish and every one is cheering for me (no literally..my friends who arnt really into the game actually go just to cheer me on) i feel like i made a lot of ppl proud. which makes me feel proud to be where i am. mmm not a lot can make me feel this way. you know. im mostly in my room being depressed. or whatever. thinking about how the world has screwed me over. and why it doesnt just kill me already. sumtimes i wonder why it doesnt just hit me with a car. it would make everyones life easier, instead of listening to me or having to deal with me. life would be easier with out me...or at least with out my "dark" side.  but thats the side of me that keeps me balanced. if i was always happy...drifting off into my own little land...i wouldnt know whats really happening around me. it would be like looking through a glass window, i guess. and totally blocking the dark side of the world from my view. and just seeing only the good, bright side.  yeah. maybe i should look through my magic window and not care what ppl think of me and only pay attention to the good. bc that would make me less depressed i guess.  i really dontknow. im a very complexed person i guess...looking for only the simple things in life to make me happy.  even though i have no idea what i want in life or for anything.   mmm. its getting late..and im stay out laaate tonight/tomoro night..whatever u want to call it....so i better get my sleep on homie

      mmkay, you see theres a guy named tony. i guess you can say theres sum history. just put it this way...if your a guy wondering why im so mean when you hit on me..blame tony. well i dont know why i cant forget about him like all the other guys? maybe its because he kisses me at all the right time. and gives me the biggest hugs when i need it most. and he tells me the nicest things when im feeling down.  but.. there are sumthings that make me want to smack him to tomoro. like calling me names for no reason, not meeting me when he says he would. grrr its stuff like this that makes him and any other guys an asshole!!

      no body should worry about me. no matter how down i am. its not like ive never been like this before. and its not like ive had ppl to talk to before. its not that new. thats why im keeping an online journal. bc no one else hears me except this. it keeps everything in my head in order. but when i look back on what ive written over the year...since spring break (my other one at www.stupidcourtney.blogspot.com) i feel like theres a lot i need to talk about. i duno. but most of the time i dont even remember. like all my anger goes through my body and out of my ears if i listen to music out of my feet when i take a walk or out of my fingers when i draw or write.   i dont know whats wrong with me. when im at school i look around at everyone and they all seem happy. i feel like i should be happy too like i dont deserve feeling bad bc i have such a good life. but i cant seem to get out of the hole. as if im jelous of everyone bc theyr having a good time. and im stuck here. in time. i feel like im standing still when everyone is moving around me in hyperspeed.   thank god for Emo. if it werent here i think i might have already killed myself. theres something about it that makes u want to either cry or be happy about ur life. i dont know how to explain it. this is a good album : "say it like you mean it" by starting line. i have to get it. right now im borrowing a cd. i would burn it...but i dont really know how to. but ill buy it then. but its really good. and i think the new dashboard confessional cd will be good too.

      maybe i shouldnt be saying this but some of the new cheerleaders for basketball season are a pain. they always complain about the music i bring in for our dance...even though they dont bring in any. it pisses me off. and when weve been doing a dance since football season...they always think they know it so much more better or they know the right way. it makes me want to scream bc im like...dude uve only known it for a week. grrrr.

      its a fact. i think im going to die not knowing how it feels to be loved. im gona die alone. but its not like anyone cares anyways. everyones wrapped up in their problems. but can i blame them. if i was sumone else i would want nothing to do with me. im just a pain in the ass. ive got so many flaws i dont get why ppl even want to talk to me. im gona be one of those ppl who go in to chatrooms looking for ppl to cyber with, because im not gona get any in real life. why? bc no body wants me. im a looser for life. i guess ill get use to spending my days and nights alone. hey! im like almost use to it now!!! lifes gorgeous like that. ::eye roll:: shit it sucks.   mmm welll i guess its ok for now. bc when i actually do meet someone special...ill feel it for real. like the feeling of being cared about and caring for someone else. if that makes sense at all.  i duno. right now i feel like im never gona feel that. and that im all alone. and no body understands how im feeling. i wonder if other ppl are thinking the same thing as me. if they are going through the same thing as me. i wonder if ill ever meet that person.

MC is such a good team in everything. like they kicked our asses in football and basketball. probably other sports too. its bc theyr rich and have money for professional coaches or whatever. i dont know...maybe its bc they practice a lot more... i do not know their secret.   i met pablo! hes coo. i guess. i think i look really young to him i guess. i dont know. whatever...i want to hang out wiht him sumtime soon for sure. yea. he seems like a lot of fun.   haha! i saw this 8th grader daniel there too. hes hecka cool! and his friend josh. he goes to novato marin school of the arts. and hes liek coreys best friend! thats soo crazy. yep.

      i was talking to jessi and she says no one really thinks im a slut. its just that its a suprise for everyone bc im courtney. i guess i do give a good good grl vibe/ attiude. but im tired of that though. yet i dont want to totally abandon my values and lose trust with everyone. i still want to be respected i guess.

      why do ppl feel like they have to lie to me in order to keep me happy? do they not think i can handle the truth? why is that anyway? it makes me even more pissed then i was before. its gay. especially when my friends do it. and my family. it seems like everyone actually. i just want to know the truth. everyone thinks they know me when in reality they dont. i just met them like 3 months ago. they may have an idea of me...dont get me wrong. but do they really know whats going on inside of me? noh! everytime they lie about sumthing stupid, it hurts. it makes me want to go away even more. it makes me want to sink in a hole and never get out. especially at a time like this. when i need their support the most. but instead they started and made everything much much worse.  i still cant process that through my head. i cant believe that happened. it gives me a new outlook on whos my real friend and whos not...and right now...i have more not friends then real ones. its ok though..id rather have 1 friend thats true than 12 that arent.  u kno what im talking about.

      my "friends" are being gay. they can kiss my ass. what kind of friends spread your secrets anyways? i thought i could trust them. i knew it. you cant trust anyone u just meet. who am i suppose to trust now??? i thought they were my friends. my close friends too. i thought i could tell them anything. and for the ppl i already knew from sinaloa but didnt really know them before....what assholes. i thought they were different. i thought they were all different. but i guess not. i guess thats why i havent talk to them before. i hate it. i hate everything in the world. EVERYTHING. aaahhhh. And for the ppl i dotn really hang out with it btu they know. i dont know how but they do. it suuucks.   i think im just gona fake sick tomoro. ive never done it before. but hopefully itll work. i never want to go bac to that hell hole ever again. it should just fuck a tree. im feeling more depressed everyday. and my family isnt making it any better. they always bitch about everything i do.   [[:I: [H]:A:[T]:E:  [E]:V:[E]:R:[Y]:T:[H]:I:[N]:G:]] and the world

      phyllis is my coach. shes the gr8est ever. like she doesnt just care about courtney the cheerleader ...but also courtney the teenager going though that time in her life. like she talked to me at practice today thinking i was having a problem with not being on the competition team or whatever. but instead it was because of how unsure i was about everything in my life. so she just talked to me about how ppl use to pick on her in high school. it was kinda like my story...almost.   about the competition team..phyllis said i wasnt on it bc ive never been to competition before and they only had a couple weeks to perfect it. and that i wasnt a sophomore who was strong to base stunts like that. i guess thats ok..bc id rather fly. but it would be hella cool if i was on it....but i dont think i would be ready for it either. maybe next year and i have for experience preforming in front of a lot of ppl and we have mroe time to work on a routine.

      jessica is my best friend in the whole wide world! i luv her so much. shes been there for me thorough everything. and she still doesnt think im bad. all she says is to be my self and do watever the fuck i want but to also be careful and not to get hurt.  she knows me so well. how im always attracted to everything unhealthy for me. and how i alwyas manage to get hurt at the end.  i feel so bad though bc she has to get sucked in to all my problems. she has to put up with me every day. listen to me complain about my life. and all that shit.   but thats what makes her so special to me. shes my best friend in the whole world. if she werent around i dont know what i would do. i think i would probably kill myself already. shes a gr8 person. i feel bad for all the ppl who dont know her.

      apperently no body...mostly varsity... thinks we deserve to go to nationals. like at practice lydia had us sit in a circle while everyone said why we shouldnt go. it hurts. like after half of the ppl talked i just walked out into the boys locker room. it hurts alot. like im in tears just thinking about it. liek i understand why and i partly agree with them. but like i feel so excluded when i go to practice and just sit there watching them for 2 hours.  it hurts so bad. almost as bad as being dumped. it hurts more bc theyr your friends that are suppose to be there for you. like im more sad then angry. even though i know its not personal ... but still. its not like i didnt want to compete. like i would be the 1st one to sign up if i could. but yea. hopefully my mom will let me go and watch. like im not gona look down on sumone bc they dont want me to go. im still gona be there and support my team. and im gona be proud of them no matter what. of course. like it would be so wrong to not be proud. i dont know how to take it all in thoguh. my 1st thing was to eat. so my mom went to apple on the way home and got hot dogs for me. i kinda just wanna lay there. but i know i shouldnt and preform the best i can and show them what theyr missing.   but at the end ...it hurts like like a bitch. like having ppl tell you that u dont deserve to do sumthing after being excluded the whole time. im feelin so down. i hate it. i just want to cry about it...i know in like a week its gona be no big deal. but its depressing right now.

      Playful Kisser  Talk about freestyle! You've got originality points when it comes to kissing. You are probably the type of person who goes with the flow and plants your pecks accordingly as each situation dictates. And why shouldn't you? The only real important rule is for you to be yourself — and to keep experimenting. If something feels good, you should keep doing it. And especially in lessons of l'amour, there's no reason to conform.  So pucker up and keep seizing your moments! But before you get all crazy experimenting, sticking your tongue in your partner's ear, or getting carried away with your little love bites, remember that a kiss is between two people. You don't want to turn them off while you're getting turned on. So if that happens, take a deep breath, slow down, and try a little tenderness.

      yea. im a lot better than i was before. i talked to jessica on the phone. it was good for me. im glad i have jessica here for me. she doesnt try to give me advice when i dont want it. she just listens. and i like that. bc i hate it when ppl give me advice before actually understanding teh situation. like jessica stops and listens to me. its nice to have sum one like that.  uh i talked to her about whatever was on my mind and waht was pissing me off. and i think ive concluded that the world is just messed up. and that i dont understand it. i was telling jessica how i feel like as if i was looking at the world and just asking why we do the things we do. i feel like im seperated from everyone. like everyone knows whats goin on and im like just looking on confused.

      i wish i could just drop dead right here. it would just put me out of my misery. no one to bother me anymore. i think id like that. no one to give me crap. and i think itd work the other way around too. like everyone can live easier. is it wrong to want to die? like i know ive got a lot ahead of me. and id probably never remember this bc its just highschool ( says stef) but is it normal to feel like shit all the time and wanting to die. is it normal to imagine ur school in flames and everyone trapped inside. and ur standing in front of it. watching. with out emotion? just stareing at everyone begging to get out and not feeling any sympathy? is it normal? am i normal?

        Apathy, well I can say your lucky, in some ways. You see Apathy is no emotion, basically you don't care. But that does not make you a bad person. Some of my friends are apathetic and I love them, but it wouldn't hurt to care a little more. Trust me life hurts, most people who are apathetic do it cause they were hurt. But don't worry, life is pain, its also pleasure. Good luck. (please vote)    urlLink   What Emotion Dominates you?      brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      well maybe its too soon to tell. but i really like leo. he makes me feel different than other guys ive been with. like good different. like i feel safe and loved when im in his arms. and it feels like the world stops when i kiss him. even in the middle of the grocery store. and wen i look at him i smile. im so happy when im with him. and like i just want to lay with him forever. like yeah i always end up sayin that about other guys, but this time i really mean it. bc like leo really isnt with me just for the hook ups. he really cares. he tells me he really cares too. adn i care about him. a lot. like he told me hes had a lil crush on me since basketball season. he says he goes to the boys game earlier just to see me. like thats so freakin awesum. and he tellls me i make him happy. like before we met/ really chilled he was depressed and down. but now hes happy. ive never ever in my life made anyone happy or changed sumones life like that. ive never been the reason why sumones life has turned around. its weird though like i remember one time thinkin how one of my life goals was to change sumones life.... its crazy you know. maybe its fate. maybe were meant to be together.  its sad though. bc like hes a senior ready to gradute in a couple months. and im a freshman only beginning my future. but then again it works out. but ill miss him like crazy. like when ever i hug him i want to cry sumtimes. bc like once he starts collage im not gona see him in between classes. im not gona be able to give him a good bye kiss on my way to spanish. but then agian i dont want to think that...i just want to have a good time with him now and not think about wahts gona happen....hey who knows we jsut might be together forever. But like i dont want ot set my self up for a heart break. weve been going out for 2 freakin weeks. its a good start. kelly and alex have been goin out for like almost 6 months. but then again they dont even talk anymore. i dont want to be like that. i like leo a lot. i luv him. i care about him. right now i cant really remember being with out him. i remember beign kinda down. and hookin up with guys who just wanted head. but with leo its different. he doesnt want that. he actualy want to be with me.  im excited.   i luv leo

      leo broke up wit me today. he was sweet about it. it was for the right reasons. but it was nice how he spent the whole day with me. we sat in the parking lot of the bowling alley for a half hour talking. and crying. then he tried to cheer meh up wit round of bowling. too bad i suck so i was like grrr. but on our way to in n out i was looking out the window and i just had to let sum tears out. then i was fine eating my burger. but i could tell iwas gettin kinda ...u know..closed up i guess. but then we were walking out and talking he asked me sumthing. but i forgot and i was like ' i feel heart broken..or sumthign like that but i know it had sumthing to do wit a heart break. and hes like..'i broke your heart?'  and said yeah. hes like the 1st guy to ever make me feel good. and ive met plenty of jerks. but seriously ive met sumone who treated me so differently and like now i find him and he leaves. it hurts a lot. and i know its hurting him too. he says he cares so much about me bc i tell him to not worry about me. and i care about him. i dont want to hold him back from his life...he deserves it. hes worked hella hard. so im happy for him. but im guna miss him soo freakin much though. ::sigh:: i guess its for the best. he said that it would be easier to end it now then it would be a couple months from now. leo does have a point. weve grown to close in a month...its gona be harder to let go when we grow closer in the next couple months. but oh well...its for the best. i dont want to hold him back or anything.    I GOTS THE MAGIC TOUCH   ok so after i spend the whole day with leo. i come home at 9 15. im in my room and im like. dude i dont want to be alone for the weekend so i call my friend ricky. he lives in freakin santa rosa. but its alright. i leave a message and like a lil bit later he calls back and is like..'ay im in the city i was thinking of stopin by to chill' so im coo sounds good. so like he rolls by and i get into his car. we stop at the square at the gas station..apperently thats were everyone kicks it before headin off to a party. pretty tight. but anyways ricky and i go off to sum random street to talk. we get in the back bc the lil middle thang is in the way. so thats were we are. he kisses me and i kiss him back. he was an amazing kisser. and like his hands are in my pants. ooooh my gooood! so good. and like im just resting my hand on his dick. and well uknow..like just kinda yeah. well like uknow. he hit the finish line..hahahaha. he was like freakin out, he was like theres sumthing wrong wit you. uve got the magic touch. and all that. and he got hella embarrassed. teehee. but then we were like theres nohting to do. so like he droped me off at home. and i was like..i had a good time we gots to chill again. and hes like yeah we do then i said 'i promise i wont touch you' and hes like 'u better touch me i want you too' so i was like ok. sounds good. then we kissed. FABULOUS KISSA! for sure. soooo nice.

      i was talking to my mom today. she feels like im maturing faster than everyone else my age. she says she wants me to slow down. but i was thinking..how? i cant help it. i feel like i need to prepare myself for the real world. i told this to my mom..but all she said was that i was only 14 years old and still young. i told this to leo..and he said i need to just let loose and have fun before its gone. but like...i duno wat to feel let alone wat to do. so much pressure. like my parents are always telling me to get serious about school. and to go to a good college to get ahead in life...but then again i do that...they tell me to slow down...how does that work? what to ppl want from me?  AND THEN theres leo leaving for college. i cried. literally. i didnt tell him why though. but i couldnt help it. i think im just sad bc i feel like hes going sumwhere ..which he is..in his life. and hes gona leave me behind..which he is.  like i duno how to react...i know i should be happy for him. but then i hate the fact i wont be seeing him taht often. which sucks. like i knew hed be leaving high school and going to college. but the last couple days it finally sunk in. hes gona be leaving me really soon. in like 2 months. i hate thinking about that. but its the fact. i have to.   thats the thing. i think the reason why i mature faster than my cousins or sum of my friends is bc ive been though stuff that they have to idea. like having sumone you care about very very much leave you. or being held up at gun point. or having your dad call you a problem child and wanting to push you out a window. or even having thier best friend talk shit about them. and then tell the whole school. giving you the worst name you could possibly think. at least for a girl. or being used by ppl just for their own pleasure. ive actually met guys who want head..if they dont get it..they wont talk to you again.   is it just me or is every good day followed by a bad day? like my last entry talked abou the best day ever. seriously it was. but now i feel ....weird. i duno what i feel. but im starting to think its true. maybe theres a balance...good and bad...hmm. it does make sense..or at least to me it does. but all the good days and good ppl you meet(ricky) make the bad days worth it.   oh well. Leo called me and said were gona spend the whole tomoro together. were gona talk. i love this man. i hate to see him down. and hes down when im down. so i guess i should work though this for him. and myself. no one wants to feel bad. i dont want anyone to feel bad. i told him not to worry. but he said he cant help it. he likes me a lot. he says. i trust him. but why is it so hard to tell him im gona miss him? maybe im not ready to let him go.

      just had like an hour conversation with paul. about our "relationship." i duno. like im just not really ready to have another boyfriend. or another heartbreak. i just want to give it a rest. but not just like being with one person. but like going out and looking for sumone to kiss. like i just want to chill. and whatever happens happens. like friday night with paul hollingsworth. all i was planing to do was to have a couple drinks with him. yeah i admit. i did think about hooking up with him before. and i do think hes a lil hottie. but like i wouldnt have made any moves on him...even if i was drunk out of my mind. and saturday with chris. i would have been cool with just hanging out and walking with the boys. but he was the one who kissed me. i duno what to do. im tired of chasing after guys. i just want to work on my school work and when the weekend rolls around just go with the flow and chill with who ever. like i dont want to be tied down....or let loose. i duno. paul likes me. i have feelings. sum for him and sum not. like chris says he likes me still. and he did kiss me. so its hard to just forget it. especially when al we had were good times. but then again its either good times or no time. i duno sumthing like that.   i feel so divided. what am i suppose to do ...suppose to say. i dont want to hurt anyone. like thats not my intentions. no matter wat i say...my whole theory about playing and hookin up with guys to get at them for not liking me when i was a dork. i just say taht to have sum kind of reasoning. but as teh days progress the more and more i dont want to hurt anyone. like no one should deserve to get heartbroken. no matter how bad they act. i just dont know waht to do. im lost and confused. i need to listen to my mest cd. it has sum pretty powerful lyrics. that make sense if u really listen.   OMG! i duno what to feel. i have mixed emotions of hooking up (being wild) and holding (being caring). like i want those 2. i want ot be wild and free, yet theres a side that wants to settle a little. i duno. but wiht who. like paul ...chris...i duno i duno. theyr both great great guys.   i feel like my past has finally caught up with me. like i use to be soo ahead of the game. like i was able to go make out iwth sumone..then a couple hours later i was with sumone completly different. it was crazy bad. but now its like..im not happy with that anymore. i sorta want more, but i dont want to cry over another guy right now and so soon.   sumthing like that

      ahh. im so fusterated with boys. i quit. tonight prom. and like i cant help thinking about leo. its been like a month and a half, one boyfriend, 4+ hook ups, and a million flirty words since he broke up wiht me. and like im all over it. like its waaay in the past. but like tonight. i cant help it. maybe its bc im grounded just for today bc i stayed out past curfew. oh well. but yesterday nina told me he was going to prom with lindsey walsh. im not jealous, i duno why i even mentioned it. oh well. that sucks. but whatever. i kinda hope sumone calls me later tonight so i can sneak out and maybe have a drink or sumthing. anyone..paul marcelo ricky...even kyle burke from novato. just anyone. hey i havent heard from carl in a while...oh well. wahtever. but yeah. i need a drink. i know it doesnt solve my problems but like it makes me forget about them for at least a lil while.   yeah.   but right now im feeling kinda lonley. i feel like ive lost my touch with the boys. i duno how to explain it in typing. but like i feel so nervous around them. and like i actually sweat when im with them. especailly when theyr realy cute. usually im hella cool. and im like hey whats up. how are you. whats ur name. i like make the 1st move after they look at me or say hi. i duno. but now i feel like a lil girl. like..when a guy says hi im like giggle giggle hey giggle giggle. like im sweating over what they think. i duno maybe its just a phase and il get back on track once i get un confused. i duno ...lemme think about it a lil more.

      chris and i got in a fight last night. it was bad. it ended in a "if ur gona be sketch about it then dont even bother talking to me at all" the worst words ive heard... i dont even want to talk about wat happened.  i feel empty. yet heavy at the same time. its driving me crazy. INSANE IN THE MEMBRANE. it sucks. ehehehehheadflhfasdjhfwaiueyfaj fuck fuck fuck im alway screw EVERYTHING up. kelly says i should of just said yeah ill try to keep the promise of not hooking up with anyone. i was like no bc 1)thats giving up everything i stand for...random hook ups. 2)a promise shouldnt make a relationship work. bc if he really did want me then he should actually trust me. bc that jsut makes me mad and makes me want to go and make out with sumone. 3) i dont want to make a promise while were not going out and have another drunken night. 4) how do i even know if its gona work. like what if i did sumthing else and it was over. .....WAIT i  already  did! and it  probably  is over. fuck it.   i duno waht to do anymore. should i just give up like he did? or keep trying to get him back? i duno. it would be such a waste if he didnt want to see me. waht a heartbreak. kelly told me he told her to tell me that he gives up. and that he doesnt want to try any more. like all day ive been ..blah.. it sucks. like i dont even want to go out. i duno. maybe if sumone called me. i duno i duno. ijust feel ..eh.. empty. like my stomach dropped. and doing summersaults. i duno how to explain it...like i feel like i can float. yet im scared of heights. its the feeling in your stomach wehn ur about to go down on a roller coaster or wehn ur looking down over the edge a building. and you feel like ur about to fall... i cant breath. like the air feels so stuffy...even wehn im out side. i duno. im completly lost. so many thoughts through my head. but theyr so smushed together that i dont know what the problem is. iduno what im thinking about.   fuck this is hard.
