      It actually took me a couple hours for me to write that last post.   It doesn't look that long, does it?  Now it must look really lame for me to post immediately after it, but I've just had a thought about what I'm going to do with this journal. It's a pity that I've created this journal only to rant about my friends and problems.  So, I've decided that I'm going to put everything that's personal in here, whereas the rest of my life, the fun stuff, the online quizzes and things like that will go onto livejournal for the enjoyment of my buddies.  I'm sure that  someone  may notice and ask.  Georgia already knows that I've got a new journal.  She doesn't know where and I don't think this turns up on any searches.  Not Google anyway. My love life has just begun to blossom.  I've got a guy who's interested in me and I'm interested in him.  It's still in the crush stage, so it's still nothing serious. Nonetheless, that, too, will be making an appearance here instead of on LJ.  If there's something that I want to tell Georgia, then I will tell her in person, face-to-face, or in her email.  And here we go... this is going to be a very bumpy ride.

       This is, perhaps, not the best thing to put as my first post on this blog. It makes my life seem overly dramatized, hence the soap opera comment in the title. Nonetheless, the fight that only really began today between my friend, Veronica, and I is what made me realize that I really needed a journal that I could call my very own.   One where the friends I have in my day-to-day life wouldn't be able to barge into.     The fight wasn't much different than what any of our fights usually are. It had started out with the determined suggestion that we clear up the issues that have continuously cropped up between us. And clearing up issues is a good thing, is it not? It's theraputic to talk about things that we have problems with and to get closure and move on with our lives.   Veronica doggedly insisted that we not fight. That fighting was "just too childish and you have to admit that much!" Meanwhile, my mind is saying that Veronica and I have never been able to talk anything out like rational, mature adults and that fighting is inevitable... along with flaming insults and low blows. Needless to say, I tell her that we'll go ahead and try to discuss it like mature adults, because, with both of us being seventeen... eighteen years old, it should be possible.       So completely wrong!          urlLink The whole fight is here , but as it's all the comments (78 total right now...) on that page, it's best just to know that the main topics were my mother and "head vs. heart."      The thing about my mom is that she is always looking out for my best interest. A good thing, to be sure, but something that requires a person to see the big picture and be able to see what needs to be done to get from A to Z. Rather ruthless, but something that's admirable to me. My mom knows what I need to have so that I can have a good life, an easier life. This does not mean a social life. It means, money and finances and retirement. She makes sure that I will have the tools to have a good amount of those three things.   My mom gives me responsibilities around the house that keep me busy. It teaches me, but there's no doubt that sometimes it keeps me away from my friends. I don't get to attend all the parties that my friends have, like the one that's tomorrow and the one a couple Saturday's ago, but I don't view parties as one of the top things I need to have in my life. I see plenty of my friends when I'm at school.   Veronica thinks that friends should be put before one's self. I think self should be put first. Veronica is ruled by her heart and thinks that one should stand up for one's friends no matter what. I am ruled by my head and I think that one's friends should be able to stand up on their own -- and if they can't now, they need to learn. After all, I'm not going be around to protect them.      She thinks I'm cold and calculating. I think I'm logical and intelligent. She thinks that she's motherly. I think she's dependent and fickle.      It's just stressful. It's enough to make me break out overnight because she just refuses to see where I'm coming from. And I do know where she comes from... to a point. Only to a point because I don't know everything that she feels. She's a horrible explainer when it comes to little comments that she makes. Usually, I can't tell if she's joking or serious. Usually, I guess wrongly. And it pisses me off!      This fight will last for a while.... quite a while. I wouldn't be surprised if it was still going well into next week. We'll probably still be mad each other, at least. I can't guarantee that we'll still be talking... as if that would be such a horrible thing. Honestly, she's bad for me to have as a friend just as she's bad for me not to have as a friend. When she's mad at me and I still see her every day, she has this habit of pointedly ignoring me that makes me want to throw something at her. Like a dictionary or something else that's just as heavy or more.      And what's horrible is that I sort of dragged Georgia into it. She's my best friend in the whole world and I'd promised her that I wouldn't do it. And then I went and emailed her... thus, dragging her into it and breaking my promise. I felt so stupid when I realized what I'd done (she brought it to my attention). I don't think when I'm angry. I blurt things and say things and wish that I could do some real bodily harm. I don't fear taking the low blows. Taking all the dirty shots is what I'm best at.  I think Georgia once said in an old blog of hers that I can be very mean when I want to be. It's true. A little depressing, but true.    There's a party tomorrow at another friend's house. Georgia will be there and Veronica, too, no doubt. Which is why I won't be making my own appearance. Georgia kind of wants her quiet night out with the gang and if I show up, she won't have it. Not that I think she'll have it with Veronica there either. I can just picture them yelling at each other now.      It's horrific and dramatic and very much a part of high school.   It's a soap opera.
