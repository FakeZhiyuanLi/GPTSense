           Since I went to my nephew school funfair and saw there were tattoo stalls, so i just pick the cheapest one and make it as my memory. This tattoo last for 6 days on my hand. The aunty said adult hands are bigger than children so she charged me SGD2 but actually my hand is as big as my nephew!!!

       Been sg for so long, never been Esplanade... Finally, last night went there with my best friend. at first, i thought i will be deadly late then i sms her and told her that i might be late. who knows she just took the train right before me! so after she alight a while, i be there with her! feel like luckly...  then we planned to dine at foodcourt... walk walk walk... foodcourt seems disappear... so we asked the security guard. He told us that the foodcourt vanish since month ago... with no choice, we go McD, both ordered McWing... four tiny chicken and french fries and one cup of coke...  when we were Esplanade, it was already 8:30pm. The Nyoba Dance was showing... dont know wat they acting .. like typical japanese weird movie style.. Really feel like "gui3 yi4" There is one scene that the man with the fake horse walk straight. All of us thought it will stop before the edge... who knows it just walk walk walk and go through the audience. Those sitting audience quickly stand up and move away. For those standing of course just "dan hoi"(canto) la  After the show, we watch New Asia performance. The Indian drummer really terro~~ He called as Kamar. The speed and his finger strength really incredible! I fancy the another modern drummer. Tama Goh dont know i spell it correct or not... later check out his detail...i mean i will try  He looks like so serious and when he play drum he kept looking at Kamar direction! I feel like he is challenge kamar when he played the drum as solo performance.  Really a nice trip... can meet up with my best friend.
