       so today was good, finally there was nice weather, so we were able to go outside this morning and collect samples. .. that was good, i liked that.. then this afternoon i learned about a new project that i might be working on - collecting paint reflectance data.. so if that works out that will be good.. uh. then it was soo nice this afternoon that we just had to play volleyball (finally!!) .. so today was a good day.. i had fun..

        today's lab was quite amusing... music and laughter really helps make it fun... even tho we took forever.. and i made the triangle too&nbsp; big.. but .. ya kno.. it's all good. i'm not sure if i learned anything.. but the optics kits are cool.. and uh.. yeah. Lunch at subway was fun.. the i got back and researched plant life in trona, ca. i've got a list of over 1,000 plants.. wow.. uh... and hopefully it'll be nice enough to play volleyball in a few minutes.. so.. good stuff. i could use some coffee right about now. &nbsp; oh, yeah, and some guys from the D&amp;C showed up today .. so.. yeah..

      Today we went to Kodak. We got an interesting tour of various labs. We learned about upcoming software and imaging devices. The re-touching software and the stereo-something or another- were "MAD" neat! The elevators were also really fast! If RIT had them&nbsp;I would ride them everyday. The Cary500 is broken for the&nbsp; summer and the weather is still bad...

         today started off pretty good.. we went up to the roof and took measurements with the hirp. the bad weather streak had kept us from going out more often (we've only been out once). the rest of the day was research on plant life in Trona, CA. i've learned that there are tons of plants out there.. even tho it's desert, there's something like 1000 plants out there. so... that was about it.         |-|-|-|-|-|    Java Wally's of the day:     Double, Large Shot in the Dark

       well.. today wasn't very exciting.. i looked up some rock and mineral info this morning.. and that's about it. hopefully everyone will get access to the health club soon.. then we can&nbsp;play racquetball !

        well, today has been productive ... i researched minerals for quite some time while jim was researching rocks.. i didn't really learn much from it.. other than research is alot of work.. uh.. that's about it.. oh, our plume making device doesn't work.. the source doesn't produce enough airflow for the large tubes.. so we'll see how that goes.      --------    today's Java Wally:     1/2 coffee 1/2 hot chocolate

        today we visited the engineering departments.. that was fun.. hopefully this will become a weekly event so we can see lots of different things we can do in college..  uhh... that took about 2 hrs.. and i learned alot... but that was about all I did.. volleyball was moved to today.. that was really good. finally a nice day this summer!

       this morning i .. uh.. listened to a guy talk.. but i didn't really understand much of that, so i can't say that i learned anything..&nbsp; the lab we did this morning was annoying .. it really needed tweeking... uh.. then we went to lunch.. and soon i'll be playing volleyball!! (come on.. no rain!)

       uh.. today i learned how to use the SOC 100 .. and i did more mineral research.. also, i've discovered addictinggames.com .. the mario shoot game is awesome .. and the driver's ed one is really funny.. other than taking some measurements i didn't do much else.. so .. yeah.. icky weather still :(

         today was alright... we went over to  c  o  l  o  r  science in the morning to take color vision  test s.. although i had a few mistakes, i was well within the normal range for good color vision.. after that i did a little more researching of minerals .. and went to the roof to look for planes.. (sadly i didn't see any up there) ... and that was about it..

      another rainy day :( .. but the good news is that the plume-generating device (which i named "moonshine") works.. well, at least when powered by a shop-vac it can shoot out paper balls.. other than finishing that i didn't do much.. oh, i did try to make a hologram, that didn't work .. it was still fun trying tho. today is payday! woohoo! :D

      today jim and i were given the task of constructing a device for making gas plumes.. which really is just a bunch of pipes and converters and a few valves.. but it's rather nifty.. we almost have everything.. tomorrow we'll make another lowes trip with the department's credit card.. fun stuff.. it'll be interesting to see if it works. .. oh, and we watched some videos.. and if this is being used for future reference, the color tape number 2 was boring.. really boring.. the first one was good.. and i'm told that the third one is good too, but i have yet to see it. either way.. getting free pizza was worth sitting there and laughing at a movie with cheesy music and horrible camera work.. they just kept zooming in on this guy's head.. anyway.. oh, right.. and "moonshine" is a quote from this guy in lowes who was behind us .. he saw all of the various pipes and was like "oh, are you making moonshine?" i think he was serious too.. but then again he looked drunk, so idk.  cualquiera

      well we did our first lab today.. it was ok.. we had to project an image through a pinhole onto wax paper.. but it was kind of awkward since i don't have three hands... then we went to the china buffet.. which is really cheap .. come on, 7 bucks for all you can eat chinese.. then it was up to the roof with the asd, taking samples for a year-long project which will see how different materials age.. which is a nifty idea,  but it was insanely hot up  there.. up.. then there's uh.. that game that we play every tuesday :D fun stuff

      so today we (the interns in remote sensing) did research about rocks and death valley for an project that will be coming up. (sadly it's in like october.. so i can't go) so the library 'class' we had last week was helpful in using the Wally library's databases.. but there really isn't a whole lot of info out there, so it's pretty long, and boring work. Dr. Basu from the U of R came and talked to us as well.. about rocks.. and the earth.. it was ok.. we will get to use his rock collection.. which includes meteors .. fun stuff.. uh.. what else.. OH! tomorrow on i don't have to go in until 8:45!!! woohoo! half an hour later is cool! and we've declared tuesdays to be eat-out day.. tomorrow will be the China Buffet!  and hopefully the weather will be good for volleyball (which is also tomorrow-- tuesdays are the best days...)

      well, ok.. today was the best so far.. we weren't just hanging around inside.. we went out to camp eastman to collect info about a group of trees (which was like measuring distance to a referace and identifying which type of tree it was) .. then we went for lunch on the beach.. that was cool.. got back to RIT.. uh.. sorta collected more rock samples.. mostly just hung around... fun stuff ..

      um.. ok, so today we learned about the library.. which was really just how to use wally.rit.edu .. but anyway, after that i read some documents about a project to take info about clouds of various gases - which might be what i'm working on .. and i read parts of a thesis on BRDF and how it's useful ... um... lets see.... i learned how to use the SOC 400, which we then used to take data about rocks ... it's really just pushing a few buttons and sitting around for about 10 mins.. but that's ok i guess. tomorrow we're going to eastman park for a collect.. should be fun stuff.

      hey hey.. cool.. now i have this blog "journal" for everyone to see... well, the second day was mostly sitting around, but i did learn some things.. we went outside and attempted to collect data .. then we went all over campus... had lunch.. and sat around.. or at least i sat around. well, ok i learned about the project that i'm working on (there's some acronym, but i really don't remember it) and i learned that the camera doesn't work as of yet, and even if it did it's an outside only project, and thanks to the rain, that wouldn't have worked out anyway. tomorrow i'll be learning how to use some machines, and i'll hopefully be learning some of the basics of how they work.. and/or the ideas behind the stuff we're doing..

         ook.... so today i made a sign for the car wash and took more samples of blue tarps with the ASD and the HIRP .. oh, and we did a lab this morning. the lab was ok .. better than the other ones, but it was still rather annoying. and then i found out that we really don't have access to the health club because we're "interns" and we have to pay 35 bucks for a week.. i just loved the lies that we could all have access to the health club and that everything was good for us to get in.. i think it makes a great recruiting tool to give us such problems over access to the gym for a few weeks to play racquetball every now and again. i'm sure every intern this summer is jumping to come to RIT next year.. (oh, wait, that's right, i'm the ONLY one coming here, and it's only because it's free .. so much for recruiting new students!.. for you future interns that read this .. don't expect to play a game of racquetball without paying 35 bucks and jumping through hoops for weeks)

      so .. the feild trip was good... it's cool that they're using machines from 100 years ago.. that trip was better than the kodak one.. less talk and more seeing stuff... and we got stuff to take with us. not that i'm going to read that book, but still.. then after than i used the HIRP from kodak, which is alot smaller and different shaped than the RIT HIRP.. so we wanted to see if the data is different.. and ... uh. yeah.. that's it. fun day

      so, yesterday was a long and collection filled day. we took samples of white cars in the parking lot all morning with the ASD w/ the HIRP. next week some time we're going to continue this project, taking data of any car, after we wash it. that should be fun. then in the afternoon, we went back up to camp eastman and used the ASD w/ HIRP on some trees.

      today i worked with jim trying to fix the ASD.. well, actually, we were trying to break it .. it wasn't working right yesterday, and we were trying to make it do the same stuff it did yesterday.. but it didn't .. it's working great today.. soooo i guess we'll be doing the same stuff on monday. uh.. that's about it...

      uh.. ok.. today i took measurements on the cary of more tarp samples.. then we took measurements and pictures of weeds .. and uh ... that's about it.

       today has been good.. this morning we did another campus tour with a high school kid who might want to come here.. and we checked out the field house.. which is really nice.. wow .. i wana go swimming now.. good stuff.. uh.. then this afternoon i learned how to use the cary, which is fixed now.. and i took measurements of blue tarp samples .. now we're taking samples of the same tarp with the ASD with the HIRP again.. most of the stuff we took yesterday was rejected.. so. uh.. i guess that's it.

      hmmmmm.. tuesday.. ok, so today we went to a presentation on imaging of water .. then we did a lab. the lab was pretty good.. it went really fast, and was pretty simple.. although the directions weren't the best.. but whatever .. uh.. then lunch.. then Jim and I used the ASD with the HIRP to take samples of a blue tarp.. that was interesting.. there was a huge jump at 1000 .. and there was quite a lot of noise around the UV range.. so ... idk.. lon's wondering if the fiber is broken, and he said that the battery was probably low, causing the noise. .. either way that was good.. then we played volley ball.. even through the rain.. good stuff

      today we went up to camp eastman and the irondequiot high school. that was cool.. it's soo nice out.. finally! .. we used the D&P and the ASD.. i learned how to use the D&P ... so ... that was cool.. uh.. i guess that's it.. hopefully there will be more nice days to go out on more collects.
