       Okay, so today i was in bashes with my step mom and my aunt and i was thinking, "I wonder if people think I have gay moms" LOL. My new favorite color is electric blue. AKA 80s blue. its so aweosome. (this isnt it, but close). its especially awesome with a hot pink background. lol. ok so on the way home from blockbuster i saw a jack rabbit get hit. it didnt die right away, it looked like it was struggling. i cried all the way home, it was so fucking sad. however my dad had monte python sings in and he was singing "sit on my face and tell me that you love me" and shit like that. so i guess it lightened the mood a little bit.

       So last night after my family (Dad, Barb  , Gretchen  , Chrissy  , and I ate at NYPD Pizza Chrissy and I went to see Napolian Dynomite. It was the stupidest movie I've ever seen. Although fucking hilarious!! Anywho, I stayed the night at her house. Keep in mind I didnt have any clothes or anything with me (I thought I was going to die, I hate wearing the same under pantilones twice in a row). So I watched two episodes of Full House (The one where Joey got onto Star Search and where a dog named Minnie has puppies at the Tanner household, thus were Commet comes into the picture). After Full House I went to bed. Tyler called me at about 11 P.M. We talked for about an hour and a half. Then Stevie's (my cell phone) battery died so I kinda hung up on him. Oh well, I freaking fell asleep on the phone about 5 time. Once I even drolled on the phone. *Lots of Laughs* On to today: I woke up at about 10. Chrissy and I went to Manwells for some Mexican food. I got a bean and cheese burro (same thing as a burrito) and a side of rice. After breakfast, yes breakfast, we went to get pedicures. It was so fucking awesome. I sat in a massage chair that rolled up and down my back, did a chopping affect, and a rolled all over my back. They gave me a foot and leg massage before they painted my toes a hot pink color. I love it, and now i'm addicted to pedicures. *Lots of Laughs*

       Why is there a song about the YMCA?? Doesnt that just baffle you? OH man.    So anyways I'm hella bored today. And on the way to the bank I was driving behind the slowest   person in the world. So naturally, I had to pass the Jerk off. and oops, it was somone from   school. I'm just hella glad I didnt flip them off as I passed them.     Okay, so Either I'm hearing things or there's seiously a horse in the living room.. I think I need   to go get my brows done. Its been like 2 weeks. Gross, huh? I want a Pina collada. kinda. it   souds good.  oooh a slushie. Okay so If anyone reads this by tonite and wants to hang out my   number is %&^ )&amp;$&amp; (omg the percent sign looks like 69.)

       SO, Okay. Right after school ended, I went to New Jersey for a week. While I was there I boogie   boarded and tried to tan. (however I'm Irish, which means, I don't tan.) Just about every day I   ate at a pizza place called Mack and Manco's. (HELLA GOOD PIZZA. I MEAN, DONT EVEN   GET ME STARTED). On the last night I went on rides. I went on the scrambler. and The guys   running the ride let me on free just about 3 times....I guess I was looking pretty good. Either   that or my shirt was still wet from that Log ride, who knows?. When I got home I went back to   volunteering at the Lakewood YMCA ( I tought lil kids how to swim). However that didnt last   long. The guy who was supposed to give me a job didnt give me a job and had the nerve to tell   me not to wear my 2 piece to teach even though i had a surf shirt on, and Stacy wore 2 pieces as   well. in the words of Stephanie Tanner, "how rude!". Anywho. 4th of July was okay. Thats   where @%@^^ felt me up (cool at the time, but horrible now) and when I started hanging out   with Tyler (or as he likes me to call him Ty ty.) However, I think its all because he wanted to   see my boobs. Although He never saw them. haha. Okay so after the 4th I went tubing for the   first time. IT WAS AWESOME. I fell pretty hard though, and lost my pantalones a couple of   times. but its all good. Then we went to Megan oops i mean my lesbian lovers house and went   tubing again. OMG I FUCKING HURT MYSELF, I STILL HAVE A BRUISE. Thats when i   realized that Dan Sanchez is not a fucking moron prick. So thats lucky. (haha sorry, I had to say   it). OKay so then on July 27th I went to Arizona. I did a lot of stuff there. So I got home on the   11th of August. Did my triathalon on the 15th. and here I am.    Dude I thought that as you get older there wont be as much drama. but i was wrong. Because   Sarah and I arent talking. (well for like a day, but thats hella long for us. lol) all i have to say is   "Eat your soup Billy". ..."Thank you daddy"

       Okay, so I did this breast cancer triathalon thingy on the 15th. My mom, Meg and I were on a team called Luck 'o' the Irish. I swam, Meg biked, and my mom ran. I had to swim a 750 which is a mile and 1/2. I placed 432 out of 3,700. NICE!! haha

        So on the way home from my "birthday" dinner, my daddy and I had the talk. NO not the SEX   talk, but the Divorce talk. I told him something that took me 11 years to say. I try to talk to   other people about it but I dont think they understand. I think the only way they will   understand is if they're parents get divorced. Until then dont say you get it, because you really   dont. You dont know how it is to visit your dad then have to leave knowing that he cries when   you leave. then you go home to your mom who says she missed you so much and you say the   same, but really you were having the time of your life. My mom and I get along, but my dad and   I are exactly the same. He is where I get all of my crazy humor from. Anyways, I dont feel any   better telling him that information, because he told me stuff too. Now I just feel like I miss him   even more. Having a step dad isnt the same. Sometimes he doesnt get my humor. With my   mom I use a cleaner version of my humor just so I wont get in trouble. I use to be really bad   around my dad because I thought that he didnt like me. What I found out was that he noticed   we are exactly the same, so he was more surprised with me. So now I can be myself, which is    awesome. So Have a Great day you sick fucks

       So I have this hot bikini Pic. of me, from when I was 14. I'm sitting down and my stomach looks   kinda good, if I do say so myself. However the face is totally ugly, so I did a wonderful edit job.   Just ask Megan. Speaking of Megan, that little whore signed off and didnt say bye. MEGAN IF   YOU READ THIS YOUR A BITCH. but I love you, because you're my number one lesbian lover.   shhh dont tell Dan, He'll wanna get in on the action between you and me.    I think when I'm older *like late 20s* I want a guy with Johnny Knoxvills face. The guy who   plays Seamus O'Grady ( Justin Theroux) on Charlies Angels Full Throttle body and hair, his fox   hawk is so freaking hot, like so hot I just might have to change the pantalones. Either his irish   accecnt, Orlando Blooms accent, or I hate to say it, but a hot preppy type of voice. hehe. Or if he   just wants to look like Seamus all the time, that would be cool too.

OMG anyone who doesnt know   Megan, she is so totally awesome. and she's my sexy friend. teehee. anyways i've gotta eat.

       three guys walk into a bar. a black guy, a white guy, and an asian guy. The bar tender bets then $50 that all of them together dont have a 25 inch dick. The black guy pulls his out and its 12 inches. The asian guy pulls his out and its 12 inches also. The white guy pulls his out and its 1 inch. So they win and then they try to figure out how to split the money. Both the black guy and asian guy think they should get half because they had the 12 inch dicks. the white guy says, I should get it all, because if i wasnt hard we wouldnt have won the money at all

       I read a very interesting article online today. And I think it's true, the way you sleep does say something about your personality.      1. FETUS People who sleep this way are tough on the outside but shy and sensitive underneath. This was the most common sleep position of study participants, with 41 percent saying they sleep this way. With women, however, the percentage was higher. Fifty-one percent of the women in the study sleep this way. 2. LOG Sleepers in this position are easygoing and like to be part of the "in crowd." 3. YEARNER [YER-ner] Study participants who slept in the yearner position had open natures but could be suspicious. 4. SOLDIER People who sleep this way are quiet and reserved but set high standards for themselves and others. 5. FREE FALL Sleepers in free-fall position are sociable and bold, and they don't like criticism. 6. SEA STAR People who sleep in the sea star position are good listeners who make friends easily.

       Have you ever been humped by a dog? Yanno, the kind of humping where the dog holds you down and you can't do anything about it? Well, has that dog ever been a year old chawawa? Hell yea I got humped by a small ass dog....... about 5 times. haha. Not only was I humped, but Erin and Derek took pictures and helped him hold me down. Then just now the fucking dog jizzed on me. EW!!!!       Well, not that I'm freaking out or anything, but Tyler is at a party. And word around the internet he's gonna get drunk. And no doubt there are a bunch of drunk girls there. Oh man. That will be a hella interesting conversation later. Well, I guess we'll be even if something happens.       Anyways, today I let Lady Barbara pick out clothes for me to try on. Believe you me, she's totally into the preppy look. HAHA. Anyways I got some cute clothes. HAHA oh man      So right now I'm at Erin and Derek's house. Derek just let me do his makeup. Now we're watching Uptown Girls. The sad part is about to come up, which means I'm about to cry. haha.

       It has come to my attention that someone thinks I have a cute butt....Now, at first i thought it was Tyler, but then i was like, no he says, "ass". So now I'm very much confussed. And they called me baby or some shit like that. Who the HELL calls me "baby"? Besides that one guy online who also calls me Hunny, Hun, Babie, Babe, and Sweetheart. LOL It's kinda weird becuase he doesnt even know me. .. ... .... ..... ...... ....... ......... ......... ........... ............ ..............      Anyways, it's raining here in AZ. For real though.  I was so excited because I was going to go swimming this morning, but I looked outside at the pool and there were drops of water hitting the pool. So I'm sitting here in listening to music. HOLY FUCKING HELL my step mom just scared the shit out of me. She's very very sneaky. hehe

        I really wish i was in arizona right now. i left last year thinking that i had the best time and i for sure was gonna be back this year. but im not. and i understand why im not there. shit happens. stupid stuff that i look back now. and i could of very easily prevented. with just one switch of the mood. and im sorry for all of that. i know i've said my sorrys. we both have. but this is just kind of an indirect way of saying. im sorry for all the stuff i did. you are one of my best friends. and i have a feeling you always will be. and i hope that one week didnt ruin what you think of me as a friend. i know im over it. but you know you never really get to say exactly everything you want to say to someone when there talking face to face with you or over the phone. you say hurtful things to each other and you get side-tracked. and forget what ur gonna say. i know im bringing shit up that already has past. but you being in arizona just got me thinking about stuff. and i called one day and barb was like to bad you cant be here. and i couldnt be like. well i wanna be. but this whole message is just kind of a sorry for the whole incident. it really put a damper on our realationship as "Best Friends". and i just wanted to tell you that you will be my best friend forever. and i can only be as much of a friend that you are to me
