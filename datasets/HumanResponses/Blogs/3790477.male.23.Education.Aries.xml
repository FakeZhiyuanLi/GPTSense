      this is a from an e-mail to my friend and pastor, i had written earlier that i had been blessed by taking communion every week.  there's all kind of mutually understood insider jargon here, but if you read the the whole and think about it, probably all the unclear words and allusions will become clear, if not comment away.  "well about convenant renewal,, i think its the same stuff that comes out in words like we have talked about before when you were at newlife.  complaints of just not really taking it seriously, and presumming to understand what the church has for its history really struggled with, yet always held as deeply sacred.  in my study of God's word, and the catechisms and creeds and sermons i've read, i get the impression it is certianly one deep means of faith, if not one of the 'means of grace'... Understanding this relationship struck by God.. communion points to such a deepness of the covenant.. and there is so much of a 'doing' that is missing in the concept of memorial only idea. (and this actual fuller then renacting kind of doing is so helfpfull appropriate for my postmondern mind) i think the holy meal we have reckonizing the body, as often as we meet. untill the Lord's return, is renewing to us, it is another unexplainable sermon to us.. it is ultimately Christs command and way together to have a meal with him and fellowship with Him that he gave to us, that we need to cherish as a people..  it just makes sense to have it every week.. to me it ultimately builds up my faith in this interesting way, that i'm encouraged that the gates of hell have not prevailed against the gospel and the truth, because i'm right here doing this, eating this holy meal along with saints for two thousand years.. it is a awesome sign of God's covenant faithfullness to his people, and our faithfullness to Him, which is a strange kind, to recieve christ like food, the truest way we can understand faith.. life giving, and not of our own merit.  anyway i of course feel there is always room to grow in understanding and restoring the use of this meal of God.. it has been in my heart a lot to want to appericiate the sacredness of God and the things of God in a world that has lost every sense of the sacred, and laughs and crys in all the wronge times.."

      in the illusionary infinite regress how do we express ourselves the faceless face of time make our faces melt and rhyme because a breathing out and in suriving only animal realities of sexual sin beyond there is no doubt nor faith but only personalities which bubble up and out from within an edge no straight nor spherical no rational nor removable i wonder where we will go when there is no roads to show no path to know  what i'm wondering about is in unconscience universe there is no difference for me and no peference to be morality is crazy and logic is insane and the potrait that is made is all there is to fake then how does this jive with the way that i live and how does this jive with the way that i die and if the story self made then how do i surive  no faith no individuals, no community no beauty, no reality, just pretended personalitie? faith a oddity on the curvatur of that bubble, making it easier to pop, the short lived, forgotten rott in the ground and the worms will dine tonight with a smile and delight

      Hey welcome folks, so i've come around and have decided to have another outlet for my own personal developement.  I want to think out loud in this site with the added benefit of possibly getting feedback from friends and strangers.  I probably won't be posting to much very personal information, I try and use other not so self-voyeuristic means to communicate whats happening in my life to my friends. Of course my website on sourceofhope.com/joe has plenty of background information on me and what I'm doing if your interested.  Anything you don't want on this site feel free to email me, and i'd be gratefull, and will happily reply.  My attention is not costly, I am willing to learn how to pray for anyone, and give advice those times when I may have some.  I'm happy that you came to this blog, and hope you enjoy it and are challenged and built up by it somehow.  I am praying for those who read it, that they might be encouraged, and this little light of mine might shine on another side of the world wide web.

      This is from another email i wrote to my pastor, I made up the term Flanderization from Ned Flander's Homer Simpsons evangelical neighbor in the Simpsons.  ------------- hey steve   struggling with lately with what i think is like a christian law of a particular personality of christian.  be friendly, orient your life, for your health, your talents, ect.. for the goal of christian community and winsome soul catching in the world.  i don't deny my created need for others.    but i wonder when you look at epistles to struggling communities (which is going to major on community issues), and when the church speaks of personal growth in the broken modern reality, the community concept can be overstated.  we create an ideal of a particular friendly, people-engaging one that we all should conform too, and displace the individual as unique, with different strengths and weakness's.   Relationship.. covenant.. we aren't alone, and I am not saying we should ever be or were meant to be.  But i think it may manifest it in more than the Ned Flander's way.  value your family, value truth and be really skilled at being nice to others, it places a lot of value on the outward skill at relationships.. i dont know if what im saying connects?   I think its vague for me what i am bother'd by.  what captures it is like this.  I've heard something like before "christian community is the main place that we grow, and without it we hardly grow."  then I wonder about some examples in history and the bible and see strong individuals who seem to know how to meditiate.  or the women i have meet whose christian community was a couple times a decade when they escaped the're families for an afternoon to enjoy some fellowship and pray, who where strong in their faith, however fearing there death if they disobey'd there father's.  They needed the fellowship, they would of been better off.. but the orientation of there life and the possiblity of life as a follower of God would not inseperable with it.   my own experience is that what i've learned and the insights i've often received has been certianly from communing, in relationship of some kind.. with God in mediatition, with dead saints through sermons.. If i try to measure up with other's who can make friends quickly, I loose sight of my idenity.. I feel that the law prodding me more to dependence on God.. should be the law of dependence  on God, open'd up by Christ alone.. but i am troubled by the loud noise of being and living a certian way..  one the old scots, the prophets, the missionary pioneers, the blessed Sadhu in India would not fit into.   the train of captives of Christ is going to be very diverse, its natural to focus, and the church has, on one or another sort of personality to be valued, .. its been sometimes to develop character, some to develop people skills, some to develop a sense of the sacredness of God, and God's thing's.. ect.. ect..  take one of these things, we may cut off gritty, or quiet or eccentric people, who still reflect God's image, people who can work hard for God's glory and know His reward..   Godbless brother..  i haven't put my finger on these things, but i am uneasy about them.. i wanted to share it with you

      easy to be cynical, there is a freedom that i can't miss talking about.  One that transcends and rocks our existence.  but we have to be carefull, this is not a whatever you want to fill in kind of thing. everything screams at us, of bondage.  the dog barks, and the man ruins.  ruins creation, ruins other people, and ruins himself.   its not the only thing he does, but it seems to be one he does rather 'well'.  He is totally free to ruin everything around him.. but this is the kind of freedom that is like the only thing tieing a man down is the gravity of his his depravity.  This is one falling down, and gaining greater and greater volicity just like anything that falls.  claw as one might, there is absolutely nothing the falling man can do, since he has not hit anything yet he might even conclude he isn't falling at all, besides, other people are level with him and it seems like they are just floating.  sometimes the airball of truth pops from under the water, no matter how hard we supress it.  so utterly unable to do anything about it, and ussually ignorant of the real state.  The effect of this speeding up life is a cause of a mor horrible then imaginable crash.  One infinitely greater than certian death that comes when someone falls from a great hieght in a physical realm.  It usually takes some time to understand bondage before you can begin to understand freedom.  So I will continue and bring some more analogies and exposition on spiritual bondage first if for only my own edification.

      there freedom an't free uhgg. shaddap!  freedom is way to broad.. to fall, to have a hold, to go, to stay, or what does it have to do with confluence with existence as it unwraps, there is always heads and tails on a silvery dollar that an't silver.  or what does it have to do with my nature to bark, I am dog.. I am free to bark, what else?  ok ok, eat poop, sleep and pee.  sorry folks, freedoms the cheapest thing every, at least what I am thinkin about.

      Wanna read something that will help you in the school of prayer?  Alexander Whyte (Scottish preacher 1836-1921) book is one of my favorites.  He's very honest, he reminds us that no one is fit to pray, it is a huge obstical.  But the man who get's into meditation and communication with God changes, from the hardest, meanest people to gentle and quiet.  What makes this different then any other work on prayer is the ephasis Whyte put's on imagination.  He'll give you many helps on focusing yourself, and will always be using his own word's to spark your heart on the eternal truths of the gospel.  Sometimes we need to put ourselve in the way of desperate pleadings to Love God, to know the way He first loved us, to think on Jesus, and have our hearts warmed to him.  Sometimes we need to hear clear portraites of heaven and hell before to spur us on, and bring us back form insanity and infatuation with the world, and the numbing and shrinking of our attention of the world.   urlLink On Amazon.. Lord, Teach Us To Pray by Alexander Whyte
