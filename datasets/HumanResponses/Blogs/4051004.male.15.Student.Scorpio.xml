      Sure we could say..George W. Bush is "worse" than the John and John dynamic duo, but what does that even mean?! If you put two people together and asked someone to choose who is "worse", they'll usually pick who is the bigger jerk. In the end, the problem isnt Bush, it's the democrats! We need to stop kidding ourselves. The democrats did not and will not do what is best for us or the modern day world. If the Democrats were a TRUE opposition party Bush would be practically paralyzed. In fact had one Democrat in the House stood up and challenged the electoral college, BUSH WOULDNT BE THERE! Bill after bill has been passed to congress from the Bush occupied white house and welcomed by Democrats. The issue on the bush tax cut was passed overwhelmingly with democratic support even though it was designed to benefit the top 10%. Democrats have also backed Bush on his bombings of Iraq as well. Not only is the fact that many of the bills have such wide democratic support disturbing, the Democrats also approved of EVERY single one of Bush's cabinet nomination. Even controvercial ones like John Ashcroft picked up crucial democratic votes. Did the Democrats forget that Janet Reno was choice number THREE for Clinton..the first two were rejected after Republicans went nuts over  differing views . Democrats have NO spine, in fact I think its safe to say that they have become nothing more than Republican wannabes. And so a new 2 party system must be created. The democrats must merge with the republicans. That way they can keep doing what they do best, representing the top 10. That way the new second party will be able to represent the other 90 percent of america. For all i care, they can breed the donkey with the elephant to make some new mascot for there merger party. I feel that an injunction needs to be made for all present day democrats that will keep them from using the word democrat without the word republican attached to it.  If the democrats can't clean up there act...fuck them and the donkey they rode in on!

      Here I sit, soon to be sophmore in high school with the realization that I have no plan. I live at home, I make semi-decent grades, but in a couple of years I'm on my own. Ive talked to a few friends of mine they've got it all figured out...tatoo artist, journalist, U.S ambassador to France, you can name the lot. They've got their career, where they want to live, and what college they hope to attend all planned, and with the wealth of some of the kids I know, their plans are definitly set in stone and will most likely be carried out. But what lies ahead for me? I don't know what profession I seek, where I want to live, or if I even want to fill out this so called "American Dream" of getting a job, living in suburbia, picket fence and a wife. So I'm going to work on my life day by day, and post some blogs along the way (hows that rhyme right there). But I'm resolving that these blogs will not be summaries of my day, but more of summaries of my thoughts. And so begins the blogging of Matt...

      Turn on Fox News right now, and just listen. Can you imagine that someone actually comes up with these reassuring lies about how everything is going great in Iraq and all is according to plan. Lets take a look.... This war is a fraud. I dont even need to talk about the weapons of mass destruction that were never found, or the non-existant links between Saddam and Al Qaida, or any of the other lies we based this war on. I'm talking about new lies, remember when I told you to listen..here's what you might have heard. 1. Same as before the war, the government tells us of threats that dont exist. This creates an atmosphere of fear, and instability. Then the ruling party offers itself as the only solution to comfort the public's fears. What are these threats, why is there an alert....fear of the unknown is always the strongest fear. 2. The second lie is that America's new government is in control of Iraq. Hmm...When suicide bombers ram their cars into hundreds of recruits outside police stations, how on earth can anyone hold an election for their "democratic prime minister" next January? Even the National Conference to appoint those who will arrange elections has been twice postponed. Iraq is deteriorating by the day, why dont journalists tell you that? 3. We arent told any thing that happens unless an American dies. This propaganda is designed to show that our soldiers have feelings, hopes, families, etc. I dont know if I can believe that our soldiers are "only doing a duty" and do not want to kill, while we emphasize that their soldiers are not doing a job and are only heartless muderers who enjoy killing.  What, indeed, are we to make of a war which is turned into a fantasy by those who started it? Our foreign workers pour out of Iraq for fear of their lives , meanwhile our US Secretary of State,Colin Powell tells a press conference that hostage-taking is having an "effect" on reconstruction. Effect! Oil pipeline explosions are now as regular as power cuts. In parts of Baghdad now, they have only four hours of electricity a day; the streets swarm with foreign mercenaries, guns poking from windows, shouting abusively at Iraqis who donâ€™t clear the way for them. I don't even think I need to get into the Abu-Gharaib prison abuse. This is the "safer" Iraq which Mr Tony Blair was boasting of the other day. What world does the British Government exist in? And Bush's regime?  This countrys on the brink. People on the top should learn from history, that when you dont control your own government, people want to kill you.
