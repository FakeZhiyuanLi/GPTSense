						   The  Washington Post   urlLink reports  that President Bush will visit "a children's hospital in Nashville, Tenn., that pioneered the computerization of patient records and will promote his goal of having all patient information available electronically in 10 years."  Bush claims that " the federal government will play an important role by setting standards for the conversion, which will help doctors and hospitals share patient records electronically nationwide."  I'll be the first to admit that this is a noble goal and one that I will wholeheartedly support.  But after having nearly 3 years of experience working to integrate health care among disparate providers using Electronic Medical Records (EMR), I'd like to inform the Bush administration that they may face some challenges that they haven't even begun to fathom.  I have to admit that the idea of sharing everyone's medical history sounds good in theory.  Physicians would always have all the information necessary to make sound decisions in our medical care.  They would know what medications and in what doses we are taking without us having to try and remember on our own.  They would have ready access to contact information for all physicians that have treated us, not that many current physicians would use it. There would no longer be a lengthy process of taking a medical history that may or may not turn up relevant information.  The idea would be more than just novel if we lived in a world without the prejudice or stigma that is often attached to many diseases, such as HIV or diabetes.  Further, it's been my experience that hospitals are almost completely unwilling to share any information electronically.  Hell, for the last 2 years I've been working with only one of the numerous clinics within Duke Medical Center and it has recently come to light that they don't even share anything other than billing info within their own walls much less with any other medical providers.  Convincing hospitals to share information is only the first and probably the easiest hurdle to overcome.  Getting physicians to actually use technology is a monumental task unto itself.  Short of some new revolutionary technology that can readily demonstrate that it saves lives, doctors are often reluctant to make use of new technologies.  They would much rather rely on the skills that they were taught in medical school and have honed through experience with patient interaction.  Add that to the fact that most physicians today are not the most technologically savvy people around and your faced a nearly impossible short-term goal.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that there aren't any tech-savvy doctors out there, just that right now they are few in number.  Those who are in medical school now and those that graduated with their MDs in the last 4-5 years will be the ones that eventually lead the transition to a more comprehensive EMR.  Unfortunately, we're at least 2 decades away from today's young doctors-to-be from gaining the power and influence necessary to create such a shift in behavior.  Such behavior change only happens rapidly when it is imminent and inevitable.  Even in those cases, rapidly likely means years or decades rather than centuries.  My point is, that from experience I know that we will eventually end up with some sort of EMR that can be shared across the country, maybe even the world.  If for no other reason than the fact that it makes it that much easier for the Dept. of Justice to know more about those of us it supposedly protects (but that's another issue entirely).  I just know that it will not happen within the next ten years.  Especially since federal legislation actually prevents such sharing of medical information.  Thus, new laws would have to passed governing how and when a persons health information can be shared (yet one more challenge for Bush's proposed EMR).  What this all adds up to is just another one of those campaign promises that sounds good to middle and upper-middle classes, suburbanite, tech-savvy voters that really won't work in practice.  I fully support the idea in theory, but it is a very complicated issue to consider.  There is still much work to be done on deciding what information should be shared and how the patient can limit information that they may not want to be in a database for all physicians to see.  We have to figure out how that information can be kept securely so that parties who should not have access to our medical records (i.e. life insurance companies) are kept out.  This is only the beginning of a long and arduous process and we should not expect it to end within the next decade.

						   Welcome to Dreams of Logic.  I'll start by telling you a little about myself and why I've decided to finally join the 21st century and start blogging.  I'm a young father in a liberal community in the Southeastern US.  I work for a major university researching issues regarding disparities in health care.  I have a degree in Political Science.  I look at most issues with an open mind and can usually understand why a person maintains their point-of-view.  I like to express myself creatively, so don't be surprised to find a poem or two show up here.  I'll use this blog mostly to editorialize on current events.  I encourage anyone and everyone to comment, especially if you disagree with me.  There's nothing that I enjoy more than a lively debate.  I certainly respect the fact that each person has the right to speak about and share his beliefs.  I may rant from time-to-time if something boils my blood, but bear with me.  I usually cool off pretty quickly.  I have a keen interest in human interaction and blogging is an arena that I have yet to explore.  I've participated in numerous forums and chatrooms and found internet communication to be fascinating.  It is always amazing what people are willing to share with a complete, yet anonymous, stranger.  I like to play devil's advocate sometimes just to see what kind of response I'll get and to keep everyone on their toes.  I hope to spark some thoughts among others out there.  I also sincerely hope to develop a debate as a way to keep this interesting.  Feel free to drop me a line at anytime.  I'll probably post my first real entry in the next few days, so stay tuned.  Always keep the lines of communication open!
