       ...life kinda of sucks! I wish I had my permit. That way I could have went to drivers ed so I could drive places. Everyone I know is and that kind of makes me mad. My cousin has her permit so doesn't shelly. But shelly and my cousin really doesn't drive around that often where if it was me i would be like casey and jeremy driven everywhere my parents would let me.

      yesterday or should I say last night Casey came over and we took a walk I had a thing of Sprite. We was in the middle of tellin me a funny story and of course there was this really funny part and of course the sprite I was drinking came out of my nose. He laughed and said "Soda came out my nose" IS.J.(inside joke) so to be stupid I turned I and made soda fly over to where he was and he got it all in the face. So then as we walk his walk ahead of me and acted like he does when something's wrong so I walked over to him  asked what was wrong and of course he said nothing but I still knew that there was someting wrong. Then he told me and I didn't understand why he got mad it was just to be funny and it's not like I meant for it to get all over his face. So, the rest of the night he was like quiet and everything. So, I don't know anymore. I'm just I don't know the word for it. I was only being stupid. Anyway's that's not what got me upset it was the fact that I don't know. I know now it's I need to do something fun in my life. So, that's why I'm hoping I can go to my cousin's that and so I can get out of town. I know if I go to Worcester that i'm gonna come home feeling so much better. Well, Talk to you on Monday LaTeR!

      ...Yea Shelly called me last night and I told her that I couldn't sleep over on Friday and she said it was kinda a good thing but it was a little bad. The reason why she's glad is that way her boyfriend can sleep over. That makes me mad because now she's not sleeping over on saturday. I should see what my cousin is doing i'll give her a call tonight. Yea my sister has life eay. Yesterday/last night. I had to be nice and lock her bike up and then I had to cream her toast even though I didn't want to. Life sucks for me. My best friend doesn't care about me all she cares for is her boyfriend. I laugh because we told each other that we wouldn't let guys get between us and well I kept up my promise. That's why when Jenifer and Casey don't get along I get mad. Because I told her that just cause me and him are dating that's not gonna change our friendship at all. I told him the same thing just cause where dating doesn't mean that i'll ignore my chick friends. He understands that. I really hope that my cousin wants to come out this weekend. I don't know. Saturday I'm thinkin of sleepin all day. Unless my parents are going to the GreyMountLock. I think that's what it's called. If they go i might go or like I said I'll sleep all day. Today, when I woke up I thought I might have pink eye cause it was all bloodshot and red and it felt as if I had redeye. I might I don't know. This afternoon Jen and I are taken bus fifteen. We have to because we gonna go to the park and her mom will be home and her mom thinks that she's stayin after today at school so we can't walk by her house. I hope at 2:00 i can go to the gym and get a soda. I hope so. Joe was gonna ride his bike today to school but took a fall on it. So, now he's gonna have to have it fixed. Well, that's all for now. same time next week!

      yea my cousin decided to call me in the middle of shop I went to go and answer it by the time I did she hanged up the phone. What a B*tch. No, i'm just kidding she isn't. Or is she? LOL )*Laugh Out Loud*( Yea so, beside that my mom told me somethings yesterday and when i heard it i just left and went for a walk. Well, i was thinking about what she told me i started to cry. I couldn't believe it. Noone understands me. I feel all alone but, I know i'm not. I hope the Shelly will understand why i can't sleep over her house Friday night also I hope she still wants to sleep over my house. I miss her a lot. I'm gonna see if my cousin wants to sleep over Friday night. I don't know right now all i can think about is what my mom told me and what caused it. Well, besides that how's your life doing? So, what do you think of this blog is it total the new me? I do't know but i like it. It's something different. I wonder if my mom will let me go to my cousin house thursday night and miss school on friday. If she does then I can take all my tests in my classes on Thursday that if I was in school I would take on Friday. I hope she lets me go. I want to sleep over Shelly's you know get out of town for a night but, I can't my mom says she need me at home. so maybe some other night. Yea, so... if Shelly sleep overs on Saturday I'm gonna see if she wants to go to the AO maybe Casey and Jeremy would like to come it doesn't matter to me. I know that if Shelly and I was to go to the AO that us two would be able to talk and hang out and I know she can use it from all the stress and school and from work. I hope she sleeps over on Saturday and she can get out here by noon time that way we have a lot of time at the AO. Well, i'll call her tonight and you can read up on what happen on the phone and if she's still gonna come out for the night. Later  LOVE YA!
