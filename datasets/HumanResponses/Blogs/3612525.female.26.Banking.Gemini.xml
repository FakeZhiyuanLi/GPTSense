      Well, my math final is done.  I feel extremely well about it.  I had most of the problems in my notes or examples of them so I could use them to get the problem done.  The one I didn't put in my notes was the circle problem and figures it was on the final.  Oh well, at most I can get is a 95 on the final .  As long as I pass the class with a 2.5 or better I'm happy.  I got to get back to work...will sit here and daydream as well.  Dolphy

      I went to church today, the first time in a couple of years.  I liked it.  The pastor was friendly and a couple of the others were as well.  There were a couple of baby dedications today which was nice.  They are having a picnic up there today and it would have been nice to stay and enjoy but I knew I had to get home and study.  I have 3 tests from my math class to redo to help me study and 4 chapters to reread for my final on tuesday. I'm not worried about the final in my computer class so i'm spending more time on my math class in hope that it will help get a better grade and help me at least past this class.  I think the main problem is the instructor, he just does the problem and doesnt give the problem and let the student work it out before he works it out.  I understand we have a lot to cover but its not helping the student either.    Back to studying....

      I've just dragged myself out of bed after my morning ritual of giving my cat attention.  I put my laundry up that I did last week and started a new load. I straightened up my bedroom as well so it looks  a little better.  Looks around the rest of my apartment, I need to do the same to my living room, but I need to buy my organizer cabinet so that I can get my paperwork in order.  So what's on the agenda for today?  Well.  Study is on the agenda....  Type up my study sheet for my operating systems class and then start taking my math quizzes all over again and use them to study and write my notes from them. Yes I know most of this is boring but it has to be done.    Dolphy

      I'm sitting here at home bored.  I need to be studying for finals but I don't want to.    Can't wait until this quarter is over so I'm done with my general education classes.  I don't know how many more classes I have to take until I graduate.

      It  is looking like it is going to be possible for me to do the website for my boyfriends work, looks like I am  competing with a company that will end up costing them $2000 .... which is a lot of money to be spending.  It really is.  I wasnt asking for a lot of money to do it either.   So I don't know.  I could use the extra money but I guess I will go down the other route for other possible money...   more later.  dolphy

      I've been doing a lot of thinking lately and a lot of praying.  I don't really know what I want to do in life, where I want to be or anything. I'm just taking things one day at a time.  A couple of friends have been irritating me lately, although I know they don't mean to.  But I don't think they realize that they are making assumptions that aren't true and aren't really listening either.  I don't know what to do but it is getting annoying because I don't like having to correct them on it either.    So I guess I take it one day at a time and see what happens.   Dolphy
