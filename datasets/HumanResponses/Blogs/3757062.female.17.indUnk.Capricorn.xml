       The day before the birth of July is about to end. Yet I’m not asleep. This is all your fault. You have kept me walking on the clouds even at this late hour. Sleepiness would not visit me still. Maybe you told it to.  Your voice still echoes in my head. The way you looked when you called me out in the restaurant a few hours ago still stretches out a smile in me. Up to now, all the time we spent talking alone in that bench, seemed like a dream. I never thought that could happen.  I should not be falling for you. It will just cause me pain in the end. You are someone unreachable. Someone so perfect. But I could not help it. Before I knew it, I have fallen already.  Before this remarkable night, I was sure I was feeling everything except love. But now, it seemed like everything faded and love came in. This is not anymore mere infatuation or obsession for your face still brighten me up even when I’m supposed to be mad at you.

       My heart wants to tell you something…  About how I feel… that’s what this is about.  You. It’s about you. And how I’ve been falling for you,  since the first time I laid my eyes on you.  Be it because I find you brilliant, attractive, and in a way, amazing,  my day never gets to be complete without seeing you.  Every tiny cell in my system jumps at the very sight of you.  I have never imagined someone as great as you  could actually exist in this damn earth.  Like Helen, your face could launch a thousand ships.  Or maybe even a million… with a face as beautiful as that.  Vague images of you run into my mind every now and then,  making my knees tremble and my lips stretch out for a smile.  Everytime I’m near you, I’m restless, not knowing what to do,  trying to hide my admiration and happiness.  You make me stutter each time you try to talk to me. Why?  Is it because you have hit me harder than anyone ever could?  Or is it just that you are someone created to make people like me mad?  Under this face that I show you, lies someone so desperately hoping  that someday, we could actually talk and laugh together without fright.  Things seem way too wonderful not just when I am with you  but even when I’m just thinking about you.  I cannot really tell if “I love you” are the exact words to tell you,  for the feeling is something crazier than that.  As funny as it may sound, to be loved by you is one of my greatest dreams.  It’s my greatest fantasy.  Nothing more. Nothing less.

       i do not know what has gotten into me... the very first time i saw you, i was already sure that i was feeling something for you. it was a monday. you were with someone i know, standing in one corner of the atrium. i was on a bench that time, behind you. for that span of time, nothing mattered to me other than you. you caught me at first glance. that time, i thought it was just mere admiration. days have passed and i realized that the memory of you never left my mind since that certain day of June. and i pondered. this could never be just a simple infatuation for i always seek your presence.   i ignored what i felt. yet, something happened that pushed me closer to you. i got confused of what i was feeling that special moment that you were with me. it was a mixture of happiness, embarrassment, and fright. happiness for finally, you were aware that i existed in this crazy world. embarrassment, for you have seen what i did that time. fright, that you may sense the weird feelings i have for you.   since that day, my feelings for you grew. unfortunately, it got complicated. so complicated that i want to make you feel loved and yet, when i think about how i feel for you, i cannot tell myself that i do love you.   the sight of you trembles my heart. your voice weakens my knees. the air that bounces back and forth our arms everytime you're beside me gives me shivers that would not stop till the day ends. your kindness pulls out a smile in me. your smile and laughs take away all the worries i have.   you have hit me hard at the least time i expected. so hard that you could make me walk on the clouds with just a single memory of you. wonder now how i feel when we're together... it feels like heaven in hell.   i have wanted you to know how i feel for you. but everytime i make attempts of giving you clues, i chicken out. i guess there's just something in you that changes the terrible me.   i hope this life-changing 'period' would come to an end sooner. for that would mean a brighter beginning.   call me pathetic. call me any names. but never call me stupid nor tell me i'm blind... for i have seen the brilliance in you inside and out.
