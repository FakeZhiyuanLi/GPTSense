      Something Oswald Chambers wrote over 100 years ago in My Utmost For His Highest.  For June 19th.  "Lovest thou Me?...Feed My sheep" JOHN 21:16  Jesus did not say--Make converts to your way of thinking, but look after My sheep, see that they get nourished in the knowledge of Me. We count as service what we do in the way of Christian work; Jesus Christ calls service what we are to Him, not what we do for Him. Discipleship is based on devotion to Jesus Christ, not on adherence to a belief or creed. "If any man come to Me and hate not..., he cannot be My disciple." There is no argument and no compulsion, but simply--If you would be My disciple, you must be devoted to Me. A man touched by the Spirit of God suddenly says--"Now I see Who Jesus is" and that is the source of devotion.  To-day we have substituted credal belief for personal belief, and that is why so many are devoted to causes and so few devoted to Jesus Christ. People do not want to be devoted to Jesus, but only to the cause He started. Jesus Christ is a source of deep offence to the educated mind of today that does not want Him in any other way than a Comarade. Our Lord's first obedience was to the will of His Father, no to the needs of men; the saving of men was the natural outcome of His obedience to the Father. If I am devoted to the cause of humanity only, I will soon be exhausted and come to the place where my love will falter; but if I love Jesus Christ personally and passionately, I can serve humanity though men treat me as a door-mat. The secret of a disciple's life is its unobtrusiveness. It is like a corn of wheat, which falls into the ground and dies, but presently it will spring up and alter the whole landscape (John 12:24).

       The body that is sown is perishable, it is raised imperishable; it is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power; it is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body. So it is written: "The first man Adam became a living being" ; the last Adam, a lifegiving spirit. The spiritual did not come first, but the natural, and after that the spiritual. The first man was of the dust of the earth, the second man from heaven. As was the earthly man, so are those who are of the earth; and as is the man from heaven, so also are those who are of heaven. And just as we have borne the likeness of the earthly man, so shall we bear the likeness of the man from heaven. (1 Cor 15:42-49)     In Christ, each of us has become a new creation.  Not a living being but a lifegiving spirit.

       You know every Dad thinks his kids are the greatest.  But I think I have an entirely unbiased opinion when I say that my kids truly  are  the greatest.  We had some non-Christian/semi-Christian (  One of our friends chuckled and said "as if that'll work..."  At about 8:50 I decided that 5 minutes were up (don't do the math...) and went to tell the kids it was time.  They weren't downstairs any more.  One of the other kids told me they went upstairs.  I found them already in their PJs and preparing their evening "toilette"!  I could've crushed them with hugs.  What a family witness!  A home that honors God is honored by God.  Like I said,  my kids really   are   the greatest...

       My sister really impressed me last week.  She is 5 years older than me.  After going to school for Early Childhood Education; working as a teacher; retiring to raise 4 great kids; returning to work as a pre-school teacher, she has retired again.  This time, at the age of 42, she is going back to school to pursue a new career as a Surgical Technician.  She has always been fascinated with the human body and decided to embark on a new journey.  It just makes me realize that it is never too late to re-invent yourself.  How many dreams have I passed by because I was uncertain of the future (or maybe too certain of the present...)?

       These are comments on  urlLink a topic  started by  urlLink Michael Gowan  on the Developing Church.  I have been participating in an effort to restructure a church.  As we tried to move from the Constantinian/"business" hierarchical model to a "body" model there is one element that constently muddies the waters--the introduction of salaries, benefits, raises, reviews, etc.  The church should be lead by a collegial body of shepherd-leaders.  In current churches, these leaders are commonly made up of elders/deacons, staff, and ministry leaders.  Obviously this can be a rather large body of people.  In the business model (BM--pun intended), a CEO is required.  As soon as there is a CEO, the decision-making dynamic changes: all can particpate up to a point with ideas but the decision is made by the CEO.  In a body, the decision 'forms' from the participation of the members of the body.  For example, what I do, largely is determined by what I am --I don't do acrobatics because I am muscularly weak and have too fine an understanding of gravity, I *do* do swimming challenges because I 'float' well and have large lung capacity.  My head (CEO) doesn't make the final call, the make up of my body determines my actions.  This sounds wonderful but what do you do when you have established a central decision-making element of the body (the CEO).  Now *all* ideas pass through that and the body can never (or not easily) move beyond it (without a perceived "power-play" or expression of discontent with the current CEO).   We could chalk this up to pride on behalf of the CEO but it is made far more complex when the CEO is "valued" (in salary) by the organization more than others.  The church should be self-disciplining and self-governing.  In a collegial body, the weakness of any element should be felt by all the other elements.  A concerted effort should be made to always strengthen the weakest link because the stronger elements are hindered by it's weakness.  If I play racquetball and have low body control, my endurance, strength and speed are useless unless I can place those parts in the proper position.  My coordination is intimately tied to my overall ability to perform.  In the BM, as long as my "department" is doing well, I'm in no fear of losing my job.  Sure I am concerned about the rest of the company but only in that they are the source of resources for my own department.  I have found at the root of this is a "job".  I was hired to do something, I am evaluated against my performance in that area.  As long as I perform, I am o.k.  As a result, in the BM, there is a constant battle to establish and maintain communication and coordination.  There has to be someone "in charge".  In a body, all members participate.  You don't go into something with just you arms or your legs.  Each part of the body has a role but all particpate.  With the BM model, someone has been hired to do a task so that frees me from responsibilty in this area.  This is the source of much of the consumer mentality in churches today--that's XXX's job, I'll talk to him about it...he can make the call.  If I don't like the call, I'll just go somewhere else--where they make the calls I like.  In the BM model, there is the constant danger of the head losing its connection with the body.  This seems to occur in far too many cases.  The head, being the 'leadership', is charged with setting the direction, defining the programming and pushing the agenda.  Unfortunately, any slight disconnect with the heart or abilities of the body will result in failure (not necessarily a complete failure but not the 'abundance' expected).  The fact that setting the direction is 'someone else's job' only exacerbates the situation and makes implementation harder (most of the body is not participating/apathetic).  In the body model, the things we do well will succeed, the things we do not will not.  The direction we take is determined by our abilities, passion and make-up.  All feel a connection and all feel a direct impact on the result.    I think I'm rambling.  I'll revise this later....

       My youngest daughter Andie (soon to be 5) broke her arm on Monday.  It was quite the affair.  The girls were playing on Blake's room and Andie fell off the bed and hit her arm on a heavy nightstand on the way down.  Many tears and moans.  When I got home I had to go upstairs right away and check on her.  I was greeted with "I don't want to go to the doctor!  I don't want you to touch it!  I don't want to move it!   I don't want you to look at it!"  She has a low pain tolerance and generally is quite into the 'drama' at any  urlLink bump or scrape  so when she initially hurt it, it was hard to tell if she really  was  hurt.  Of course, like any good, caring Father, I didn't believe her and told her to knock off the bawling.  In the end we gave her some children's Advil and put her to bed.  In the morning she couldn't really move her arm.  Amy took her to the hopsital and sure enough, it was broken--clean break of the radius near the elbow.  I, of course, feel like the biggest jerk on the face of the planet.  But Andie has forgiven me and is in good spirits now and God is healing her as we speak.  Now we have a joke in our house:    Q. What has 8 legs and 7 arms? A. Our family.

       Jake and I met last night.  He told me he went to church that morning.  Apparently a friend of his invited him to go with him.  Jake was pretty excited about all of the stuff he learned about Jesus--like the fact that his cloak was without seams was a sign of perfection and that the blood and water that issued from his side symbolized forgiveness and cleansing.  He was exicted and I was excited for him.  He's going to follow up with his friend to see if he can go more often.  He'd only be able to go every other week because the other weekends he is with his Dad.  Suddenly, I feel like I'm just a small part of something much larger going on with him.  The Holy Spirit is so active in his life and I'm just a bit player in it.  It is great to be used by Him but it's even better to see Him working in Jake.  I'm so proud of him and the initiative he is taking to seek higher things.

       So I went to "the Menard's Park" with my daughter Blake today and as we were hanging out playing, another boy started to "tag along" with our play.  He seemed to be looking for someone to play with.  Blake and I got to the spinny tire swing and he came up and asked if he could swing too.  I usually will let kids like this join in our fun when we go to the park simply because it seems like there are so many lonely children out there who desperately seek companionship.  Blake and Calvin (his name as we found out) were having a great time as we invented different swinging "styles"--tornado swing, boring swing, hurricane swing, astronaut swing, circle swing, snail swing, etc..  After probably 15 minutes of swinging, his Mom came up.  We continued to play and swing and laugh together and she seemed to enjoy watching.  Once the kids were tired of swinging (or I was), we stopped and went off.  I struck up a conversation with the Mom.  She was very talkative and we talked mostly about Calvin and his school, interests, challenges, habits, you name it.   Calvin had been diagnosed with mild autism and had delayed speech and social development but he seemed to be a very well-behaved, happy boy.  He was apparently an excellent student.  As we talked, I listened for leadings from the Holy Spirit.  In the end, I made a few comments of how she had been blessed with a wonderful boy, said our goodbyes and took off.  Blake and I talked on the way home about how it's nice to show Christ's love to people and that was part of the reason we stayed so long at the park with Calvin and his Mom.  Blake commented "but we didn't say anything about Jesus..?"  I told her we did.  We showed his love by sharing our love with them, by listening and encouraging.  We didn't  say  anything but we  showed  them.  Blake said "sometimes showing people God's love is just as good as telling them about Him."  Amen, little girl, Amen.  So now I am more encouraged to simply be.  To look for every opportunity to just show this wonderful love we've been given.  And make some friends along the way...  Anybody want to astronaut swing?

       We went to the Tebala Shrine Circus last night.  What a riot!  The expressions on the kids faces was priceless--awe, glee, joy, surprise, tension.  More than one point where they broke out into spontaneous dance.  More than one time they screamed with delight at the surprises before them.  More than one time they covered their faces as a performer attempted "a death-defying feat, never seen before".    Everything about it conjured up memories from the past--the big-top, the clowns, the cotton candy, the whistles, the cheezy souveniers, the barkers, the ring-master, the tigers, elephants, leopards, trick dogs, the trapeze act, jugglers, acrobats, magicians--the show.  I had to (got to?) hold Andie on my lap the whole time because she was scared of falling through the bleachers.  It gave me a front row seat to her excitement.  At one point a clown was throwing balls into the crowd.  We were way in the back, but Andie's little hands shot up to express her desire to have it thrown to her and in readiness to catch the ball when it came.  I loved it.  Blake stood and watched, jumped, danced, shrieked, gasped and laughed every step of the way.  We were all pooped when it was over (on a school night on top of that) but it was the best kind of pooped (we even got to see an elephant poop!).  It was a wonder-full family memory that I'm sure will resurface in dinner conversation for years to come.

       Driving home yesterday I saw what will have to be my next car.  I need a Nissan Altima and the first thing I'll do is bust the 'L' out of Altima.    Then I'll have "A Timmaay!"  (Said in a voice like Timmy from South Park).

       Once I fell in love With an idea.  It was a small idea at first And then it grew. As it grew, I loved it more. As I loved it, it grew more.  So I decided to share my idea. It still grew but it grew slowly.  I started to sell my idea. I started to defend my idea. But I couldn't get others to love my idea Like I did.  I still loved my idea but now it was....work.  Then I got tired of selling. I got tired of defending. Maybe they are right. Maybe my idea isn't as lovely as I think. Maybe it isn't such a good idea after all.  So now, I'll let my idea...die.  It makes me sad-- I used to love my idea.  Now it asks me, "Do you love me?"

       This morning, my daughters asked to play with some books we have laying around.  One was a book of American poetry called  Six American Poets .  I'm not a real poetry buff but when I get down, I find it is just the thing my soul needs.  Something about the simplicity and the depth of poetry that connects.  I found this old favorite of mine by Langston Hughes called  Mother To Son .  It helps me perservere.  It was refreshing to read it again.   Well, son, I'll tell you: Life for me ain't been no crystal stair. It's had tacks in it, And splinters,  And boards torn up, And place with no carpet on the floor-- Bare. But all the time I'se been a-climbin' on, And reachin' landin's, And turnin' corners. And sometimes goin' in the dark Where there ain't been no light. So boy, don't you turn back. Don't you set down on the steps 'Cause you finds it's kinder hard. Don't you fall now-- For I'se still goin', honey, I'se still climbin', And life for me ain't been no crystal stair.

       The Christ-ites met this morning.  As usual, it was very stimulating.  All of us are getting impatient to  do  something.  So Ron, in his usual way, suggests the logical first step--pray together.  How novel.  Seriously.    This idea is foreign to my church experience (believe it or not).  We usually get together with a plan in mind and then try to acomplish something.  Now we're getting together with a plan in mind and then expect to have something happen.    Novel.  God's Holy Spirit is already at work all around us and for once, rather than trying to work  for  God, we are determined to work  with  God.  I'm not sure any of us really can define what that looks like but when I've encountered the Holy Spirit's action in the past it has generally been something that just happens.  You set up a meeting/assembly/gathering/whatever and something unexpected yet fully expected begins to take shape in the conversation.  You didn't bring it, you didn't plan it, you didn't make it happen--it flows out of you and the people you are with.  It's bigger and better than anything you imagined and leaves you energized ("The glory of God is man fully alive")  I'm waiting.  It's in me.  It's in us.  We just have to let it out.

       I came home on Tuesday and as soon as I walked in the door, Blake plopped herself on the floor, pulled up her pantlegs, and showed me two band-aids she had--one on each knee.  Then she pulled her pantlegs back down and showed me the two holes she had torn in her pants.    It happened at school.  "Running too fast" was the self-assessed cause, Blake informed me.  I came home on Wednesday and as soon as I walked in the door, Andie showed me three band-aids--one on each knee and one on her elbow.  She had also fallen down.  "I hate summer.  I'm never going outside again." was Andie's planned course of action to prevent further mishaps.  I love summer.  Skinned knees and all.

       A great evening!!  The meal Amy made us was fantastic.  Beef Tenderloin, roasted carrots, orzo w/ pesto, green beans, bread, salad.  All perfect.  But the thing that was best about the evening was the conversation.  We have gotten together with her family many times in the past.  Her brother and sister-in-law are Christians and very like-minded with Amy and I--earnestly seeking to please God in all aspects of life.  But since the other 6 people have not begun to walk with God, the conversation rarely turns to spiritual things.  If it does, it doesn't stay there long.  This time was different. There was an extended conversation about rasing children to be principled and prepared to make right decisions, about right and wrong, about truth.  Much was couched in the application to family life but each line of questioning seemed to lead to God's path.  Amy's brother Scott was really the center point of the conversation.  He is a great Dad and a man of God.  A wonderful example of a father.  I really appreciate the role he plays as the trailblazer in this thing called parenting (his kids are 6 years older than mine so he seems to hit the milestones first).  He has always been able to see a clear, right path and has been consistently proactive in pouring Godly decision-making skills into his kids.  In all of this he acknowledges God's leading and plan.  I am blessed to know him, my home was blessed this evening, God was glorified in all of it.   Christ the Lord is risen today! A-a-a-a-al-le-lu-ia!!!

       So Jake and I were reading Genesis together and about how God had become disappointed with the human race and decided to destroy them. In reading that I came across this:    When the human population began to grow rapidly on the earth, the sons of God saw the beautiful women of the human race and took any they wanted as their wives. Then the LORD said, "My Spirit will not put up with humans for such a long time, for they are only mortal flesh. In the future, they will live no more than 120 years."  In those days, and even afterward, giants (Nehilim) lived on the earth, for whenever the sons of God had intercourse with human women, they gave birth to children who became the heroes mentioned in legends of old. (Gen 6:1-4 NLT)    Later that night Amy and I were watching a bad documentary called  Banned from the Bible  about all of the books that did not become part of the canon. One of them was  The Lives of Adam and Eve . In it, it talked about how angels were having children with human women and creating a new semi-human race of people. It used the above text (apparently) as a jumping off point.   Now I don't put too much faith in this other book (thought to have been written in the 1st century) but still, the fact of the verses in the Bible make me wonder. Why is there such a distinction between the "sons of God" and the earthly women if all they were referring to were men? Does this really give credence to some of the stories of Greek mythology?   Again, they do not add or detract or change the story of God and Christ. They are just verses that I have not noticed before.   Anyone ever look at these verses closely before?

       Went good tonight.  Jake is a great kid and he really set the pace of the evening.  He's really interested in learning about the Bible and what it says.  We're starting from a clean slate and that will be a refreshing place to be.  No denominational or theological or philosophical questions.  No axe to grind.  Just "what's it all about?"  I thank God for letting me be a part of simple, pure discovery.  I think I'll learn more than he will.

       I guess this is a blog kind of day for me.  Work is pretty slow...  Tonight I'm meeting with the son of one of my wife's friends.  His name is Jake, he's 12, and we're getting together to eat ice cream and talk about Jesus.  His family had been over for dinner a few weeks ago (see the March 31 "Blake & Andie" post) and as we talked about  The Passion  he had a bunch of questions about what Jesus did and why.  I've never done anything like this before.   Holy Spirit give me the words you want to say and, through me, show Jake the way you have for him.  Move powerfully in our conversation and have your way with both of us.  Open our hearts to Truth.  To God be the glory now and forever.  Amen.   I'll let you know how it comes out.

       This weekend we are hosting Easter for my wife's side of the family.  I'm really looking forward to it.  We just re-did our dining room (in the Trading-Spaces-bold-color style) and we just purchased a new dining room set.  It'll be the 'family' debut of both.  Amy's making beef tenderloin and of course she's really nervous that everything comes out o.k.  She may be nervous on the inside but she is as cool as can be on the outside and one of the best hostesses I've ever met.  The best part of us hosting these things is that she always has to try out the recipes before the actual day a couple times so she has it down.  As a result we get to eat like kings for a couple of weeks before the holiday.  (Last time it was Beef Wellington which is a filet mignon with gorgonzola cheese, sauteed mushrooms, shallots, and garlic all wrapped in a pastry shell--Wow those were  good !).  So far both trials of the beef tenderloin (roasted with fresh rosemary on top served with garlic mashed potatoes) have been fantastic.  You gotta be a red-meat fan though.  Beef tenderloin (like prime rib) is supposed to be prepared rare.  It'll be a great afternoon of food, conversation, and fun.  A great way to celebrate the new life we have in Christ.

       So I'm reading through the book of Judges and I get to  urlLink Chapters 17 and 18  where the story of Micah and his idols is told.  I was very confused over what this story meant and what its purpose is in the Bible.  The portions I was especially confused about were:   Now this man Micah had a shrine, and he made an ephod and some idols and installed one of his sons as his priest.  In those days Israel had no king; everyone did as he saw fit.   A young Levite from Bethlehem in Judah, who had been living within the clan of Judah, left that town in search of some other place to stay. On his way he came to Micah's house in the hill country of Ephraim.  Micah asked him, "Where are you from?"  "I'm a Levite from Bethlehem in Judah," he said, "and I'm looking for a place to stay."  Then Micah said to him, "Live with me and be my father and priest, and I'll give you ten shekels of silver a year, your clothes and your food." So the Levite agreed to live with him, and the young man was to him like one of his sons. Then Micah installed the Levite, and the young man became his priest and lived in his house.  And Micah said, "Now I know that the LORD will be good to me, since this Levite has become my priest."  (Jud 17:5-13)   The six hundred Danites, armed for battle, stood at the entrance to the gate. The five men who had spied out the land went inside and took the carved image, the ephod, the other household gods and the cast idol while the priest and the six hundred armed men stood at the entrance to the gate.  When these men went into Micah's house and took the carved image, the ephod, the other household gods and the cast idol, the priest said to them, "What are you doing?"  They answered him, "Be quiet! Don't say a word. Come with us, and be our father and priest. Isn't it better that you serve a tribe and clan in Israel as priest rather than just one man's household?" Then the priest was glad. He took the ephod, the other household gods and the carved image and went along with the people. (Jud 18:16-20)   The commentaries I read were spotty at best on these two chapters and they mostly addressed the historical context of the story and the actions of Micah and the Danites.  None of them addressed the actions of the Levite.  He seems to be completely self-serving.  Ignoring the fact that idolatry is taking place and prostituting himself for whatever office he can hold to increase his own perceived importance.  If this was commonplace, I can see why the Levites were reprimanded so stongly by God through the prophets.

        Once, having been asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come, Jesus replied, "The kingdom of God does not come with your careful observation, nor will people say, 'Here it is,' or 'There it is,' because the kingdom of God is  within  you."  (Luke 17:20b-21)   The alternate translation for "within" is "among".  As I "seek first the Kingdom" an expression of an old friend comes to my mind when I read the verse from Luke -- "this must be the place because there's no place closer to this place than this place."

       From the book  Restoring the Balance Between the King, the Kingdom and the Holy Spirit  by Ern Baxter    And when He is come [unto you], He will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment (John 16:8)  Through whom is He going to reprove the world?  Where does the Holy Spirit live at this moment?  He lives  in  the corporate Body of God's people and  through  the corporate Body of God's people.  His purpose is to reprove the world of sin, of righteousness, and of judgment.  Christianity is not primarily an individual matter; it's a corporate matter. (p16)  ...the time has come when we can no longer go around like a bunch of "inspired" individuals doing our own thing.  We must become mixed into the Body of Christ so we will become that reproving community. (p 17)  Out of our righteousness we say to the world, "This is how you live."  It is not a matter of getting in a pulpit and saying "Now you shouldn't do this, and you shouldn't do that."  Rather by our lives we must say to them, "Come with us and we'll do you good.  See how our marriages are run.  See how our families are run.  See how we conduct ourselves."  We must become a community of righteousness. (p18)  We all love to be personally blessed.  But until you are tied to the redeemed community as the ongoing instrument of the Holy Spirit to corporately speak to the world about sin, righteousness, and judgment, you haven't skinned your moose (p19)   I struggle with 'church' and its seeming ineffectiveness in the world to truly embody the will of God and participate in the work of the Holy Spirit.  I have gotten quite good at 'playing church' but remain weak at 'being Christlike'.  I am continually honing my skills at being a good church member but neglect my skills at being a good Kingdom citizen.  I hunger and thirst for a community of righteousness that 'speaks to the world'.  I have Christian friends with whom I experience true Christian fellowship--we rejoice and mourn for each other, we build each other up, we accept each other for what we are, we view each other as what God has made us to be--but I have yet to figure out how to make this fellowship visible.    Maybe it is visible and maybe people are noticing...  Maybe I'm too impatient...  Or maybe I'm not looking in the right places...

       In  The Passion of the Christ  there is a scene where Mary wants to get closer to Christ.  She positions herself in an alley off a narrow road that Jesus must walk down.  As Jesus passes by, he falls under the weight of the cross.  Mary's mother instincts kick in and she rushes to His side.  As He gets up, He sees her and says, "Behold, I am making all things new!".  What an odd thing to say...  How can this bloodied, beaten man who is barely able to stand, much less carry a cross be making  anything  new?   Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and there was no longer any sea. I saw the Holy City, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride beautifully dressed for her husband. And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, "Now the dwelling of God is with men, and he will live with them. They will be his people, and God himself will be with them and be their God. He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away."  He who was seated on the throne said, " I am making everything new! " Then he said, "Write this down, for these words are trustworthy and true."  He said to me: "It is done. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End. To him who is thirsty I will give to drink without cost from the spring of the water of life. He who overcomes will inherit all this, and I will be his God and he will be my son.  (Rev 21:1-7 NLT)   This is the joy of the Christian life.  The miracle of Easter.  The hope we have.  Christ's work at the cross was a necessary part of a higher goal that is offered to all without charge.  It is in the resurrection of Christ that we have new life.  The old order of things has passed away.  Each has been made into a new creation with the same power that rose Christ from the dead.  It is this that we celebrate on Easter and every time we participate in communion.  If you are a believer Jesus Christ, we invite you, as the trays are passed, to take the wafer that represents Christ's body and the juice that represents Christ's shed blood.  If you do not know Jesus, He has invited you to come and drink "from the spring of the water of life" and allow Him to make you into a new creation.  The decision to accept or reject that invitation is yours.

       I asked a question at small group last week:  "What do you want to ask God but are afraid to because you think it is impossible?"  Two members immediately jumped in with what we call "the low fruit" or "the Sunday-school answer" -- Nothing is impossible for God, I've already asked Him for everything.  Hmmm...  After a couple more answers, a woman told a little story:   A little girl and her father were in a grocery store and noticed a man with no legs in a wheelchair who needed help.  The father went over to help him and then continued shopping.  Later that night, at bedtime, the little girl asked her Dad if they should pray for the man at the store.  The father started to pray for the man and prayed for good health, good friends, long life, love, etc.  At the end the little girl looked at her Dad and said "But Dad, what about the legs?  He needed  legs !"   Ahhh   What is impossible for God?  How often do we unconsciously limit Him by only asking for what we would see as a reasonalble request?  After this, small group really picked up and we really began to appreciate God as a specialist in the impossible.  Ask the impossible.  After all, "nothing is impossible for God".  Right?

       What does it mean to give? Is it a contribution? An offering? A tithe? What's a tithe? Should it be a tenth or should it be all? What is 'all'?  Can we 'give' to God? What is important about giving to God? The heart of the giver? The size of the gift? The way the gift is used?  The discipline of giving? Is giving a discipline? If so, what is the purpose of the discipline?  When we give to a local church, who is the recipient of the gift? Is it even a gift or is it an investment? Should we expect a return? Where does the gift go after it is given? Where should it go? Should we care?  If you are concerned about what happens to it after it is given, was it truly given?  Does it go to those in need? Who determines need? If it goes to others, does it still go to God? What role does God play in this? Are we pooling resources? Pooling them where? For what? Are we sharing or giving? With whom? To whom?  If you are worried about what happens after it is given, was it really given in the first place?

       Andie had her follow up visit today.  Everything seems to be going fine--the bone is lined up perfectly.  The pin can come out in 2 weeks but I think we'll be leaving it in for an extra week just to be sure.  When we take it out, we will be able to remove the cast for short periods to bathe her and go swimming and stuff.  That is really good news.  We have vacation the third week of June and it would be nice to have her be able to get into the water.  Still don't know when we'll be completely done with the cast.  But I think I'm o.k. with it on for now...still a little nervous (even though  she  doesn't seem to be).  Now we just have to wait for the bills to come...

       Met with the Christ-ites this morning.  It has been a long time since we have gotten together and even then we were missing  urlLink Tim .  I have been reading  The Shaping of Things to Come  and had read a story about a couple that went skydiving and due to a sudden thunderstorm, were instead introduced into the community of a group of avid skydivers.  They shared lunch, stories, good times and were told they could come out every Saturday to hang out with them.  The book used this story to illustrate the difference between an attractional church (which would develop "skydiving-based ministries" to attract these people into the church) and the incarnational church (which would continue to send people on Saturdays and infiltrate the group to eventually spread the values and life of Christ).  But, as usual, I missed the point.  The thing that intrigued me was what is it about skydiving that kept these people together?  What made them devote a significant amount of their free time (and finances) to skydiving--possibly even rearranging their schedules to accomodate it?  What made them so enthusiastic about their sport that they were excited about spreading it to more people?  What made them accept a newcomer into their fellowship and encourage them to return?  I'm not really concerned with beating the metaphor to death.  I'll make the jump right away.  What is it about Jesus Christ that binds me to Him?  What is it about Him that makes me want to spend a significant portion of my free time (and finances) with Him?  Even to the point of rearranging my schedule?  What makes me so enthusiastic about knowing Him that I want others to know Him as well?  Do I love Him so much that I think others just  have  to meet Him--not "accept" Him but just to taste and see?    Are these things even true of my relationship with Christ...  You think about how we get devoted to sports or hobbies and allow them to consume and define us--how our time is spent, how our money is spent, the clothes we buy, the equipment we buy, the magazines we read, the events we attend, the TV we watch, the things we talk about...    I'll ask what I asked the Christ-ites this morning:  What's so great about Jesus Christ?

       I was just boggled by the symbolism held in the story of Sodom and Gomorrah in  urlLink Genesis 18 and 19 .  I really don't understand it but I know there's a bunch to it.    God reveals His plan that destruction is coming because of their wickness 18:17   God goes down to see for himself 18:21   God's grace abounds as he will    listen to the pleadings of a man 18:25,27,29,30,31,32  spare everything for the sake of a few righteous men 18:33     God's judgement comes swiftly 19:15,16   God's destruction is total 19:25   God's judgement is final, there is no looking back and desiring what is condemned 19:17,26   God is faithful to his promise 18:32 and proves to be a just judge 18:25 who does not kill the righteous with the wicked 19:29    There is so much of the OT that is a shadow of the reality that will face us in under the NT.  Each of these elements appear in the themes of the NT and the coming judgement of God.  I'm only just beginning to appreciate the depth of this book.

       So I find out through my Mom that my Dad is having some sort of trouble with his heart.  About 3 years ago he had bypass surgery (I think it was a triple).  He came through fine and was back out on the golf course in good time.  Now, at their last physical, the doctor said he thought something was wrong.  He went back in for one of those "dye test" things where they squirt the dye in there to see where the blockages are.  The doctor found something and wanted to do a stress test to see how much damage there was.  The stress test is on May 24.  They don't get the results until June 8 and they leave for California on June 11, returning July 24.  The kicker of the whole thing is that my Dad doesn't want anyone in the family to know about it.  He figures that until they know for sure what is going on, he doesn't want to get anyone alarmed.  My Mom, of course, is pulling all of us aside, real hush-hush like to tell us what's going on without my Dad knowing.  When I think about my Dad, my first reaction is:  what are you thinking; this is the time you need the support of your family; you should be telling us.  My second reaction is:  I'd probably handle it exactly the same way; keep it close; don't draw attention to yourself; it could be nothing.  I'm not sure his reasons are the same as mine but since he's the one who taught me to be a man, I'd guess I'm roughly the same type of man he is.  The same type of man a lot of guys are.   We're supposed to be independent, fearless.  It's dangerous to show weakness.  Not sure I'm going anywhere with this.  Just writing/recording, I guess...

       From  The Imitation of Christ  by Thomas E Kempis:    It is vanity to wish for long life and to care little about a well-spent life.    Amen.  How often do I pray for safety and "good"?  I want my children to grow up healthy ahd happy.  I want my wife to be fulfilled as a person.  I want my friends' burdens to be lifted.  I want my home to be blessed.  But why?

       We're home.  Andie made it with flying colors.  We got there early--6:30--with Andie still snoozing in my arms.  Checked in, got our temperature, blood oxygen, pulse, etc.  They had to take a blood test which, by far was the worst part of the process.  She was cool as a cucumber as we talked with the nurses and doctors.  She bravely rode off in the wheelchair/car with the anesthesiologist.  That was the last we saw her for a few hours.  It was weird seeing my little girl go off into the hospital where we could not follow.  She was alone and very brave--a smile on her face.  We were praying that the doctor would be able to "push" the bone back into alignment so he would not have to operate.  Turns out that wasn't the case.  The bone was completely out of alignment and the healing process had not even begun.  The operation took the full 1-1/2 hours.  The doctor was glad we operated at this point.  He realigned the bones and put in a small pin to keep it in place.  She won't get a permanent cast since the pin will hold the bone--she'll just have a splint.  The pin stays in for 4 weeks.    When she came to afterward she was a little grumpy.  It tore my heart up to see her in pain/confusion.  But after she saw us, she rested quietly for about an hour.  She woke up happy.  Slammed down a popscicle and seemed in good spirits.  The nurse showed her the pain chart (happy face (0) to crying face (10)) and Andie pointed at the "0" happy face.  Apparently she felt great, had another popscicle and wanted to check out.  Now we're home.  She initially went off with her sister upstairs gabbing away about her experience.  But we had to slow her down and now we are watching  Brother Bear , none the worse for wear.  We haven't heard about the healing process yet.  Amy has an appointment next Tuesday where I'm sure we'll find out what the prognosis will be.  Now we take it one day at a time.  We praise God for walking her through the whole process.

       Dropped Blake off at the Joneses tonight.  She'll spend the night there so Amy and I can take Andie to the hospital for her surgery/procedure.  She seemed like she couldn't wait for me to leave.  No problem staying at someone else's house.  Of course, she has spent the night at the Joneses a couple of times before and they treat her great.  They're a blessing to our family.  Andie went to bed without fear it seems.  No last minute questions or concerns.  Now we just await tomorrow and whatever that will bring...

       Brian Simkins had this on his  urlLink blog .    I wish that the mystic could get up and go to work with me tomorrow. He will not. He will sit here in my little office and wait patiently for me to come home so that we can pick up where we left off with the latest book, or with some thought that I want to write down. The mystic will not go to work with me tomorrow because he would get devoured there. He could not do my job the way that it is expected to be done. He'd certainly never get promoted. Isn't it obvious? Taking the mystic to work would cause way too much of a radical change. I'd no sooner take the mystic to work with me tomorrow than I would have 7 years ago when I was getting paid every week to tell kids about Jesus. The mystic, the lover of Jesus, the one who plays and sings in the dark . . . he is much better left at home to wait for me in this little office. Things are so much easier that way.  It is exactly where I'm at.  I find that I can only really become in touch with Christ in a very controlled environment--at home or on a walk with my Bible or a book--quiet.  In the chaos of the rat-race, the spiritual side of my soul gets crushed.  It tears me up inside to face this.  Satan tells me lies and says I'm two-faced; that I'm ashamed of Christ; that I can be good at home but not in the world.  He's a good liar and at times I find myself believing him.

       Well, I guess we got some bad news about Andie's arm.  Apparently it is not healing properly and she can't rotate her wrist all the way from palm down to palm up--she gets a little past vertical and it stops.  So now we have to go back in on Wednesday to have the doctor rebreak it and set it properly.  He's gonna try to do it just by pushing on it but if he can't, he'll have to do surgery.  Both require Andie to be put out.  Andie doesn't have the highest pain tolerance and she doesn't have the greatest feelings for doctors so this will be quite a challenge for her.  They say they'll be putting in an IV which I think will be the worst part of the whole thing for her.  Amy and I were talking about our prayers over this matter.  We were disappointed when we got the bad news from the doctor--I guess both of us just expected God to have healed her.  But as we thought about it, God's healing is what  we  desire but our true prayer will be that His will be done and that regardless of the outcome, that He be given glory.  If Andie doesn't need surgery--to God be the glory.  If she does and heals perfectly--to God be the glory.  If she does not and will never regain full range of motion--to God be the glory.  If something unforeseen happens--to God be the glory.    God's ways are so far above our ways that I cannot even hope to understand them.  The plan He has and the ways He uses us and our lives is so incredibly complex that I do not want to hang my hopes on what I see is best in my eyes.  I will rest in His will and be alert for how He needs Amy, Blake, Andie and me to respond throughout the entire process.  He has something in mind and it will be beyond our wildest expectations.  It has given us great peace to realize this.  We aren't worried and we are of one mind going in.  I pray that this peace will extend to Andie as she faces something she cannot understand.  But God does...

       How do you know when you are being lead by God?  I've had an awfully uncomfortable feeling about a lot of things in my walk while at the same time I get goosebumps about other parts of my walk.  Lots of things that have been a part of my "Christian life" (I have no idea what that means but I'll use the term) I am now seeing as scaffolding around the real life of the Kingdom.  That "Kingdom life" (again, no  real  idea of what that means but I'll use the term) is the thing that it at the center of the scaffolding.  It all really started over a year ago as I started to look at Christianity in a new way.  A simpler but more demanding way.  A way that required more of me--more consistency, more conviction, more understanding, more faithfulness, more accountability, more involvement.  A Way.  Being.    This is the stuff that really excites me.  The stuff that gives me goosebumps as I lay down at night and realize that something that happened that evening or that day was completely unplanned but completely wonderful.  A God thing.  It's a leading you follow for no apparent reason at all that blossoms into something you expected but didn't expect.  Know what I mean?  Like inviting friends over and having God run the conversation and the evening.  Like having a simple conversation with someone that turns into a real soul-to-soul connection where you reveal something you never thought you would--and having it understood.  Like looking at a building and having a vision of what could be.  Like giving up on trying to force relationships and then having the relationship really turn into something easy.  That's what God has been showing me lately but now I'm beginning to wonder where He is leading me.  The problem is what I do with the scaffolding.  Unfortunately, I can look at it with nothing but disdain.  A terrible word.  An improper stance.  An incorrect conclusion.  I'm not saying it's right, I'm just saying it is (  I believe that in my head but getting it to my heart is a totally different story.

       I got passed this book Rediscovering the Sabbath by Bruce Ray from a friend of mine.  I really had some preconceived notions going into it--especially since the cover had this slicked-down little boy in his "Sunday suit" and a girl in a frilly dress.  But then I was pleasantly surprised at the approach the book took.    It was basically a study of how the Sabbath has been gradually revealed throughout Scripture.  The first time it is mentioned the Israelites are told to keep the Sabbath because it was the day God rested after creating the earth.  "A day to rest in God as creator".  The next time the Sabbath is mentioned in Scripture, the Israelites are told to remember how they LORD freed them from slavery in Egypt.  "A day to rest in the redemption provided by God".  In the New Testament, Christ came as the completer and perfecter of our faith.  He did not abolish the law but rather came to fulfill it.  In the NT, we still find "the Lord's Day" being celebrated.  The author pointed out the parallels between the OT and NT Sabbath.  In the OT, we rest in God the creator.  In the NT, we rest in Christ the creator (each of us is a new creation in Christ).  In the OT, we rest in God the Redeemer from slavery in Egypt.  In the NT, we rest in Christ the Redeemer from slavery to sin and death.  Lastly, he pointed to Hebrews 4 where we read about the final Sabbath rest that God has prepared for us.  How we long for the day when we can finally "enter God's rest".  It really made me think of how God, in His perfect plan, has created a Day for us to rest in Him.  A day when we can get to all of those things we never seem to have time for in our walks with Him.  The book really stopped short of laying out any "do's and don'ts" of the Sabbath.  It merely presented this background (past, present, future) and allowed us to work out how this principle will be applied to life.  I haven't really gotten to far in the implementation but I look forward to exploring the idea of truly setting aside a day for the LORD.

       Amy and I were taking a walk in our neighborhood tonight and I stumbled across my dream home.  It's an old building that was once the Rockford Riding Club.  812 Camlin Ave.  Built in 1920.  A very interesting structure with a large barn door in front on a large grassy lot.  It looks like there are two stories in the back with a hayloft above and old stables below.  Most of the building looks like a wide open, two-story space with 2 skylights.  Probably the old exercise area.  Attached to the front, on the street, is a small addition that looks like it may have been the old business office.  Wonderful brick exterior.  The whole thing, with the attached land, takes up half a city block.  We were thinking it would be great to turn it into a semi-public space.  Put in a big kitchen, dining room and family room in the lower level in back where the stables are.  Bedrooms upstairs in the loft.  The large space out front would be left open for a living/fellowship space.  The offices in the small addition would be converted into two or three guest rooms with a bed and a sink each.  I'd get a job programming out of the house so I could work when I wanted to and stay home all day.  It'd basically be an open home where people could come to hang out.  We could be church with our spiritual family in the big room and have picnics on the grassy lawn.  We'd do music, meals, reading Scripture whenever people happened to show up.  Maybe sometimes when we weren't even there.  No signs, no name, no bulletin, no programs, just a semi-public residence.  Word of mouth publicitiy and Word of God life.  Friends could come and just be.  Those needing a place to stay for a while could stay in a guest room.  Amy and I just stood looking at the building, letting these ideas roll out of us.  It'd be a dream...  Now all we'd need is a million dollars to do the renovation.

       After Andie  urlLink broke her arm , some friends of ours (Patrick and Erin) bought her the game  urlLink Sorry!   It was a really nice gesture.  Completely unexpected.  I think Erin felt for us because she called on the actual evening of "the incident"--when we still weren't sure if Andie was truly hurt or not.  Anyways, we were playing tonight and about 45 minutes into the game I noticed I was getting quite annoyed with the fact that the girls were spending more time adjusting Barbie's or rolling around or readjusting their pieces than they were playing the game.  "It's your turn"  "Okay, you go now"  "Take a card"  "Hurry up".  Dang!  I was the task master.  It didn't help that it was getting more and more past bedtime with each minor delay.  In the end, Andie was allowed to just roll around and play with her toes or whatever and Amy and I played her turns.  It got me thinking about games and how, when you play, there's a certain attention that has to be paid to actualy keeping the game going.  If you aren't paying attention the game really lacks some punch.  But is it really the game that is the important part or is it more the fact that we are interracting as family?   If it wasn't for the fact that is was getting late, I think I would have been much more relaxed.  I guess we just misjudged how long the game would take.  It really makes me take a step back though, and worry less about the task at hand and more about what is taking place.  I'm back to the "be" vs. "do" battle.  I've been programmed to "do".  So much so that I really find it difficult to simply "be".  Work in progress, I guess.  By the way, Andie ended up winning.  Rolling and singing right across the finish line.   For her, the victory was just as sweet as if she had actually played the second half of the game.  Way to be, little girl!

       So I just found out this morning that I'll probably be heading to  urlLink Israel  the third week of July.  This sounds wonderful but it's not.  You see, my company is owned by an  urlLink Israeli firm .  The whole week will probably be spent in meetings or at the hotel.  I went there once before in December 2000.  That was right before we got bought by Iscar.  Where we stay, Nahariya, is way North.  A few miles from the Lebanon border in Galilee.  It's really pretty safe there.  Most of the fighting is South (around Jerusalem) or way-South (near Gaza).  The town is nice and relatively quiet.  Right on the Mediterranian Sea.  We can walk there from the hotel.  A nice beach and a park where you can always see kids playing soccer or riding bikes.  The food is great and to be surrounded by so much history is pretty cool (seeing a road sign for Bethlehem or Nazareth or Jericho is wild).  The problem is that I don't really get along too well with our Israeli friends.  I can't really explain why.  Probably comes down to my pride more than anything else.  That and the fact that it is very difficult to get the "straight story" as to how their system works.   So sometime between now and then I have to figure out how to get over my bad feelings.  Being nice always gets you futher then being mean.  Grace  and  Truth...

       Just felt like blogging a bit about what is going on at my job.  I'm a programmer.  I write custom software for  urlLink Ingersoll Cutting Tools .  We're a manufacturing firm that makes rotary milling and drilling cutters.  To be honest, I know next to nothing about our products.  I know a few terms about the cutters.   I know a little bit about the machining and the manufacturing process, a couple of terms for the warehouse/inventory/logistics side but if you actually showed me one of our products and asked me to tell you about it, I'd know next to squat.  I guess that's o.k. because in the software world, you are slightly detached from reality.  To me it is a "product".  This product has a process to create it, a price, a cost, a usage.  It is used in other products and other products are used to create it.  We have demand for the product (from something called a customer) and we need to generate supply to meet that demand.  Sometimes we can anticipate demand and generate the supply beforehand.   This is called maintaining inventory.  Inventory is something that entails risk, since you are guessing at future customer demand, you may guess wrong.  Then you're stuck with the stuff.  Inventory also has value.  You have spent money in labor and materials to produce the product and those dollars are wrapped up in that product.  This is called an asset.  But, if you ask me, it's junk until a customer buys it.  Then its revenue.  Revenue is good because the more revenue we generate the more can be distributed to employees or put back into the company in capital improvements.  Both of which are good to me.  Distributed to employees means I get paid.  Capital improvements mean new technology which means my market value goes up.  If you didn't know what ERP means, you basically do now.  ERP is a system used to support all of the activities I just described.   I write the software that does that.  It's pretty interesting.  Especially when the company is a global concern with subsidiaries all over the world.  Things are always changing and there's always imrpovements to be made.  You also have to take into account tarriffs, exchange rates, and export duties.  Pretty cool.  I've worked there since Dec '88.  I started out programming CNC milling machines (big ones), then moved to doing software support for design.  Then I moved into System Administration and a slightly broader application development role.  Still supporting the engineers and designers.  Now I work on the commercial side and write stuff that supports a much broader user base.   I program in RPG (old as the hills) on and AS/400 (old as the hills).  RPG is a pretty boring language--not very powerful but it is simple.  The AS/400 is what they would have called a mini-computer in your Computer 101 class.  If you ask me it's a kickin' machine--solid as a rock and stinkin' fast.  Pretty open and well designed as well.  I've worked on Unix workstations and Windows machines and both of them take a back seat to the AS/400 if you ask me.  We have a 5 person programming department.  There's a woman who covers accounting and costing, a guy in charge of purchasing, pricing, and management statistics, a guy who covers budgets, sales support, shipping, the warehouse, and invoicing, the web and e-mail, a woman who covers order entry, customer info, and management statistics.  I cover engineering, manufacturing, production control, logistics (inventory planning), and communications with our other divisions.  There's one last guy who was, until recently, in charge of customer quotations.  I say "until recently" because I think I just took that system from him.  He now has been re-assigned to help the woman who works on the accounting stuff.  I think it'll be better for the company since he really wasn't making the kind of changes we need in this area.  I'm looking forward to it.  I like my little world.  I am basically support the activityies that surround the definition, design, manufacture and inventory of our products.  If you work for a manufacturing company, that's a pretty good spot.  All in all Ingersoll is a good company and my job is enough to keep me interested.  And I'm sure this is far more than you ever wanted to know.

       Andie had a follow up appointment today with Dr. White.  It went great.  He X-rayed it and said it was healing perfectly (praise God).  He was impressed with her range of motion (straighten, touch shoulder, twist).  Things are apparently going great.  He lifted all of her activity restrictions (of course, I think Amy and I had already lifted those restrictions...oops).  We have a follow up appointment in 3 months to make sure everything continues normally.  Quite the experience.  (On the other broken arms--Jeff had his reset twice and surgery and still doesn't have good range of motion, Matt got a past the elbow cast for now and in 3 weeks will get a gortex wrist cast--no prognosis yet, Jake goes in on Friday to get a permanent cast--he separated his bone from the growth plate and will need X-rays every 6 months 'till he stops growing (next 6 years?) to make sure everything is o.k.)

       Here is the list of people I know who have broken their arms this summer:    my alley neighbor, Jeff   my daughter, Andie   my nephew, Matt   my friend's son, Jake    I'm a little worried.  Broken bones seem to be happening all around me.

       The first day of our vacation was spent with my brother-in-law and his family.  The kids were staying home and the adults were going to a Mark Schultz concert at their church.  The occasion for the concert was pretty cool.  The church ran a "Day of Serving" where members of the congregation were going to spend a day serving in the community and at their church.  They had private homes, parks, schools, community centers, etc. lined up that needed work.  They said about 850 people took part in the day.  The concert was then that night and served as sort of a celebration for the day.  Pretty cool.  People involved in demonstrating God's love and then getting together for a chance to celebrate and worship in community.  Mark Schultz was good but Amy and I were confused as to how to take it.  With our current dilemmas with the "attractional church" and all that goes along with it, we are extra-sensitive to the things that churches do and the audiences they reach.  This includes the genre of Christian music.  Like it or not, clothe it in Christendom or not, Christian music is a money-making industry.  Record companies are just as willing to take money for music made in the name of God as they are to take money for music made in the name of...uh..."self-expression" (if you know what I mean).  As Mark played songs "off of his latest CD", we were confused as to who was the focus of the concert.  Again, this was made to be a celebration of a community of believers so it wasn't really  for  Mark but it was a thin line between the two.  It really left us wondering how to balance the use of one's gifts (in this case musical) to the glory of God without glorifying yourself.  I know very little about Mark Schultz other than the fact that he has written some very popular songs.  He seemed to be a very humble man who didn't seek the applause he got.  Maybe the bigger problem lies in the audience he attracted--were they there to see him or to see Him?    I'm not condemning Christian music, I'm just a little confused about it right now...

       Well, just got home this afternoon.  It's good to be home.  I didn't think about anything for a whole week.  It was great!  The weather was 20 degrees below normal up there so we didn't get to do a lot of the water-based activities that we had planned--a bummer.  But we made the best of it.  Cousin Larry turned out to be a really nice guy.  The three families fit together pretty well.  Larry's daughters--Jaime (16), Katelyn (13), and Francis (10) were great.  They did a good job playing with the girls and I think they had a little fun of their own.  We didn't play as many games at night as we usually do--had more campfires.  Went to see some pretty cool waterfalls one of the days.  I got some nice time spent with Andie that was a treat for me.  We got ice cream at The Windmill 3 times and the even though Ed Bessie's is under new ownership, they kept the same chef and the prime rib was scrumptillyicious!  Didn't get out in the canoe as a family but Steve and I floated around "the fill" for a few hours solo-canoeing (each to our own) and fishing.  Caught nothing but had a great time--peaceful.  Now it's back to the grind and catching up with everything that happened around here.    Gotta go unpack...

       I had to post-date this to be June 19th.  I'm reading through  My Utmost for His Highest  by Oswald Chambers as a devotional recently and this was the entry for that date.  Oswald Chambers wrote these words over 100 years ago yet the seem to carry many of the themes I have been wrestling with lately.  The emphasis added below is mine.    "Lovest thou Me?...Feed My sheep"  JOHN 21:16   Jesus did not say--Make converts to your way of thinking, but look after My sheep, see that they get nourished in the knowledge of Me.   We count as service what we do in the way of Christian work; Jesus Christ calls service what we are to Him, not what we do for Him.   Discipleship is based on devotion to Jesus Christ, not on adherence to a belief or creed.   "If any man come to Me and hate not..., he cannot be My disciple."  There is no argument and no compulsion, but simply--If you would be My disciple, you must be devoted to Me.  A man touched by the Spirit of God suddenly says-- "Now I see Who Jesus is" and that is the source of devotion .   To-day we have substituted credal belief for personal belief, and that is why so many are devoted to causes and so few devoted to Jesus Christ.   People do not want to be devoted to Jesus, but only to the cause He started.  Jesus Christ is a source of deep offence to the educated mind of today that does not want Him in any other way than a Comarade.  Our Lord's first obedience was to the will of His Father, no to the needs of men; the saving of men was the natural outcome of His obedience to the Father.  If I am devoted to the cause of humanity only, I will soon be exhausted and come to the place where my love will falter; but if I love Jesus Christ personally and passionately, I can serve humanity though men treat me as a door-mat.  The secret of a disciple's life is its unobtrusiveness.  It is like a corn of wheat, which falls into the ground and dies, but presently it will spring up and alter the whole landscape (John 12:24).   Kind of hit me where I've been living...

       In two days we're leaving for one of our annual traditions--the week in Tomahawk at the 3T's Resort.  The 3T's is a small place, a little run-down but it's quite and clean (enough).  We've been going up there for 7 years or so with two of my roomates from college, Steve and Adam, and their families.  We all have kids that are roughly the same ages.   The last couple years Adam hasn't been going up--I'm not sure his wife really likes the trip.  This year, Steve's cousin Larry (and family) will be joining us.  Larry lives on a farm in Effingham IL and is the subject of many of Steve's stories.  Amy and I are unsure of how this will be since we've never met Larry before and aren't sure how we'll all get along.  I'm sure it will go swimmingly.  Regardless, we're going away and that's all that really matters right now.  Work has been just that--work.  Evenings seem to have been very hectic at my house--I haven't seemed to have much time with my 3 girls lately.  Church has been going through some sort of transition or something lately.  Blogging seems to have gotten a little too contentious for me--self-provoked, I'll admit.  So I'm taking a break from it all.  Probably won't blog again until June 27 or so, won't talk on the phone, won't watch TV, won't go to church, won't get e-mail, won't work, won't go to bed early, won't wake up early.  I will get some reading in (picked up  As I Lay Dying  by William Faulkner), some card playing, some dominoes, Rummicube, Milles Borne, Chinese checkers, canoeing (or should I say catamarooing--we lash two canoes together like a catmaran, nice and stable for the kids), fire-staring, swimming, hiking, napping, playing, pushing the girls on the swings, ice cream eating, and last but not least, the grand finale of a week in Tomahawk: Ed Bessie's Prime Rib--King-cut, RARE.  So long cruel, cruel world...hello Tomahawk.  I want to leave today.

       Tonight at dinner, in fact pretty much as soon as I got home, Blake asked if we could go out and get her a Bible.  She went to VBS at our church that day and apparently she found out that she needed a Bible to follow along with the lesson.  Well, what Dad could refuse the request of his daughter to buy one?  We went out to Barnes & Noble because we had some old gift cards to use up.  We picked out a Bible based on the weight and size of print.  She wanted one that was light but with big print.  We found the title version and started to look for Bible covers.  She was so excited babbling away about her new possession.  When we got to the checkout, we inadvertantly stepped in front of another lady who was waiting in line (got enthralled with all the little bookmarks and gizmos at the checkout.)  We noticed our mistake and went back into line.  But Blake never quite made it.  She excitedly began telling the woman all about the fact that she was getting a Bible of her very own.  "I already have a baby Bible and a story Bible but they didn't have *all* of the stories.  This one has all of the stories.  It's just like my Dad's.  Now I can read this one all the time.  I went to Vacation Bible School at my church and they wanted us to bring a Bible so now I decided to go out and get one of my very own..."  The woman must have been a believer because she asked my daughter intelligent questions about the Bible, VBS and the occasion.  Blake then proceeded to tell the checkout girl the same story (but she was uninterested.)  It was great to see my daughter so jazzed about a Bible.  To the point that she was telling every person she encountered about it.  A child has no inhibitions and the adults she spoke to didn't have any preconceived notions that she's trying to "hook them into something".  It's just one excited person contagiously sharing her excitement.  Faith like a child.  Excitement just for excitement's sake--not with the intention of "converting" anyone to her point of view.  Just excited about something that she finds interesting.  For some reason I think I got a little glimpse of "what's so cool about Jesus"...

       From the title book again:   David Bosch, in his magisterial book on mission, reamrked "The mission of the church needs constantly to be renewed and reconceived."  Without directly referring to Einstein's axiom "If you can't imagine it, you can't do it", Bosch nonthless refers to the same dynamic process by which the people of God are to relentlessly reimagine their fundamental tasks in the world.  ...   Just reflect on this in relation to the building you are now in as you read this book.  You might question aspects of the design and its functionality, but you can be sure of this--it could not have been built unless there were a blueprint of sorts.  Even the crudest of buildings requires some forethought and conceptual preparation.  The buildings must have "existed" in the mind of the designer or builder before it existed in concrete reality.  The same is the case for all artistic expresion, but is also as true for the social structure of human communities as it is for the mission of God's people in the world. (p.187)   This was in a chapter on creativity in the church but once again I think I missed the point.  It really got me excited to think that every aspect of this world, the Kingdom and eternity existed in the mind of God before anything was created.  Of course, this is implied throughout Scripture but every once in a while the reality of it strikes you.  Whay does it mean to say that I and all I am existed in the mind of the Designer before a single cell was placed in my body?  My self, my parents, my personality, my job, my family, my friends all were gently designed--conceived--by the Master.  "Fearfully and wonderfully made".  Ps 139 shouts out.  But then extending this beyond the individual to everything and everyone I come into contact with.  There is a perfect design behind each of my days and each of my actions.  Not a moment is wasted in the design of the Creator who authored time itself.    I forget the reference now, I think it was in The Younger Evangelicals, about how the modernist man wants to view things as mechanisms with pulleys and levers and linkages that all interract to form this wonderful machine.  But God doesn't seem to work that way.  His is a story full of deceipt, lies, failures, crimes, murder, lust, and death.  A story that contains hundreds of flawed characters who, despite their flaws, were used by the Supreme to glorify Himself.  What kind of designer constructs a mechanism full of flawed parts and mismatched components and produces a thing of beauty, wonder and perfection?  My God, that's who.

       Today was Andie's 5th birthday.  Amy always decorates the kitchen with streamers and balloons and stuff and put the birthday cake out on the table first thing in the morning so when the girls wake up, they see it all.  It was great to see the joy that such simple things put on Andie's face.  Since her birthday is the first one of the kids, I think she's surprised every year.  It was a simple celebration, just family and cake with our surrogate grandparents, Ron and Cher (even though Ron was sick).  Andie picked pancakes as her birthday meal.  Our family was made richer 5 years ago and God continues to bless us with the life that is hers.  Happy birthday, little girl.

       We found out yesterday that our water softener died.  The water pressure in the house had been "low" for several weeks so we called the Water Department about it.  They came out, put the water softener on bypass, and, voila, the pressure is back.  Now we have to go out and buy a new one or recondition the old one.  We keep a "house fund" for occasions such as these but you usually like to choose when to spend it rather than have it forced on you.  And soft water isn't one of those things you get excited about (like windows...).  Oh well...

       Tonight was kind of a kick-off meeting for a short-term missions trip that I guess I'm kind of leading.  We'll be building a church in Chuchuca Bajo and classrooms on a church in Chuchuca Alto.  I went last October and it was a life changing experience.  There's something about going to a completely different context that will open your eyes.  To get myself in the mood, I thought I'd post a few pictures from the last trip:   urlLink    The "project".  Building classrooms on the back of a church in Xetxan Bajo.  Building with concrete block was something I had never done before.  I'm not exactly handy around the house.  The cool part about it was that, when you needed to cut a block to size, you cut it with a machete.  Something primitive and fun about it.&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Here's "the boys" in the village of Patzun with one of our interpreters, Otto.  We're standing in front of a free medical clinic that Andrew, the local missionary, works with.&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Lake Attilan.  A beautiful place where we spent out R&R days.  Surrounded by 7 volcanoes.  One of those lakes that is incredibly deep.  They have soundings to 1850 feet but the aren't sure that is the deepest point.&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    One of the guys we went with, Chris Williams, who made closer connections than anyone else on the trip.  He had a way with the kids that was great to watch.  I hear he is thinking about going again this year.  I hope he does.&nbsp; urlLink

       I guess I started  urlLink this topic  with the idea that it would spawn a conversation.  It did and I'm glad.  The question of what church would be without "Sunday morning" has been one that Ron posed to me a while ago (8 months?) and has been bugging me ever since.  I honestly did not have an answer in mind when I asked this question (I call that asking like a child--I wanted to know; not have something proven to me).  But I think the child in me got an "adult" response.  I read a blog a while ago (I think it was  urlLink Chris Marshall  but I can't remember) that talked about the church having things in the wrong order.  They start with getting people to church (ecclesiology) and then getting them plugged in to service in the church (missiology) and, through that, hope that they will come to a relationship with Jesus (Christology).  This has been my experience with church.  Ideally, the blog said, this should be reversed.  People should come to know and love Jesus (Christology) and discover who they were made to be by their Creator and out of that love should spring a desire to serve and worship Him (missiology). Eventually, these people would band together into a fellowship or a church (ecclesiology).  By and large I agree with this observation.  But now how do you start with Christ?  The quest to understand this process is what spurred my  urlLink "What's So Great?"  conversation.  I wanted to start with Christology.  Understand simply who He is and what it means to know Him (in the immortal words of Aaron "I think if I really faced Christ, He'd scare the crap out of me".  I agree).  ( urlLink Col 1:15-23 ) Because, somehow, He needs to be clearly seen and communicated for who He is.  In the church today, I think He can be hidden by the stage, music, programs, ministries, buildings. ( urlLink Lk 10;41-42 ) People start to think that going to church is the same as knowing God.   So I wanted to see what people had left after this layer was stripped away.  The conversation that ensued was more a defense of the retention/reconstruction of this layer rather than an identification of what life would be like without it.  Probably a poorly phrased question.  Maybe it should have been something more like "how does your spirituality manifest itself outside of organized religion?"  I really am looking for answers to these questions because I really don't know the answers.  Maybe I'm not supposed to.  The original instruction was probably all I needed: "Follow me."

       The Christ-ites met Tuesday morning.  We were talking about  urlLink Tim's transition  and the next steps.  One of the things that was brought to my mind during that conversation was  urlLink Isaiah 42  (quoted also by Jesus in  urlLink Matthew 12 ).  It really struck me about Jesus' approach to changing this world.  Is 42:19,20 states     He will not quarrel or cry out;         no one will hear his voice in the streets.      A bruised reed he will not break,         and a smoldering wick he will not snuff out,     till he leads justice to victory.    What does it say about Christ to be characterized by not breaking a bruised reed or snuffing out a smoldering wick?  What does it say about my attitude in regard to things that are bruised or "smoldering"?   The full text of Isaiah 42 is very interesting....

       Got the pin out today.  Pretty funny.  They had to take an X-ray first and started to unwrap the temporary cast.  It was sticky because some of the blood from the surgery is stuck in there so rather than pulling all the stuff off, they just took the pictures as is.  When the doctor came in, the first thing he did was pull the pin out.  It slipped out "just like butter".  Andie didn't even notice him doing it.  But then the doctor started to pull some of the dressing off to look at how the incision was healing and Andie started getting uncomfortable about it.  Gradually she started crying and begging them not to pull the pin out.  Amy had to break the news to her that it was already done.  "Oh."  We need to keep the cast on but can take it off tomorrow to bathe her and then take it off for longer and longer periods each day.  The doctor is a man of few words so the details about how long we have to deal with the cast are sketchy.  Now it's just a matter of taking baby steps and slowly trying to move the arm a little more each day.  The prognosis is good.  We'll see how the recovery goes.

       So Ron started making fun of me tonight because I have this burr in my shorts about group study.  I can't really define it but I can say that it is  not  a "Bible study".  You know, everyone is supposed to study a section of Scripture each day and then we get together to share the insights gathered and the meanings we have extracted from the text.  What really happens is that people skim it in the car (if at all) before they walk into the meeting and it falls to the leader/teacher to give a leading exposition of the text and then ask a series of thought-provoking questions.  If you're lucky, someone will actually disclose something about themselves that is remotely related to the text being "studied".  No, I'm talking about something else.  I'm talking about that excitement that comes as you pour over a section of Scripture and allow it to speak to you.  The discovery of a meaning or word or connection or symbol that has you flipping through the Bible and bathing in God's amazing, time-spanning play.  The kind of reading and discovery that makes a group of verses you have read dozens of times before suddenly become new.  The revelation that this really is the  living  Word of God and the Spirit of God is sharing Truth.  The point where you understand what drove David to write his 176 verse love song to the Word in Psalm 119.  It's  that  experience that I would love to share with a body of my brothers and sisters.  Group Discovery.  Joint Revelation.  Truth and Life.  That's the "holy grail" that has been eating away at me over the past few months.  The problem is how to share the revelation.  God speaks to each of us so individually and each of us walk at a different pace and a different level and in a different way with our God that it seems impossible to ever have a group of people walk in step.  What speaks to me may not speak to you.  What the Spirit needs to teach me will most likely not be what the Spirit needs to teach you.    But I guess the more I seek it, the more it will elude me.  The more I try to manufacture it, the more is will disintegrate in my hands.  If it ever happens, God will have to bring it, lead it, make it, and, in the process, blow me away.  I can hardly wait...

       I am just completing an "end" in my life.  For the last 3 years I have served as an elder for  urlLink my church  and today was my last official act--confirming the new elder board.  Over all, the last three yeasrs have been an amazing experience.  It was a time of some pretty dramatic change for us.  It involved a rather emotional change of leadership and more than one attempt at restructuring.  At the same time, God started churning things around in me that lead, among other things, to a short-term missions trip and, semi-relatedly, to a keen interest in the missional/emerging church.  That churning has left me pretty much where I am today--at the end of leadership in the church and at the beginning of ????.  I think that's the interesting thing about "ends"--they are really the beginning of something else.  They give you a rare chance to stand at the top of a hill to look back on the good, the bad, and the ugly things of the past.  To reflect on the changes God has made in your heart.  You also can turn and look to the uncharted future.  Look at the pieces you have available to yourself and start on a new life-puzzle.  I wish I would have recorded my expectations of the eldership when I started it.  The doubts I had, the challenges I perceived, the strengths and weaknesses I identified in myself, my reactions to the other guys.  I would be great to read through that and see how truly clueless I was.  The thing I do remember is that, at that point, I felt a strong sense of comfort and 'being prepared'.  I had just gone through a huge conversion at work that had placed me as leader in the midst of change.  I had discovered some leadership and organizational skills that I know God had placed in me and chose that time to reveal them.    Now I sit at the end of eldership and the start of who-knows-what.  It'll take a few days for it to sink in, I think.  Sundays will be weird for a while.  But that's o.k.  I think I needed a break.

       Some good stuff from the title book:   What is more interesting is that none of the creeds get to talk at all on right  living , the very topic the Bible itself cannot seem to talk enough about.  In its Hellenistic bent, doctrine shifted from right  acting  to right  thinking .  This has been referred to as the distinction between ortho praxy  and ortho doxy .  Orthopraxy is a system that believes that right living provides context for us to embrace right thinking.  Note the Pauline Epistles and Paul's constant references to righteous Christian living as the framework for Christian theologizing.  The reverse is called orthodoxy.  It assumes that if we change a person's thinking, we will change the way he or she lives.  But there is too much evidence to the contrary.  Many great theologians have "thought" rightly about Christian teaching, but their lives have not necessarily mirrored their beliefs. (p.121)    There is one more theme of the post-Jesus Jewish mysticism that needs to be explored.  And that is the difference between the Hebraic and the Hellenistic definitions and assumptions about the nature of faith.  It must be mentioned here because of its reorienting significance and its usefulness for us in becoming a truly missional people of God.  The difference between the two worldviews is summed up in the two words used for "faith" by the two language groups--these being the Hebrew  emunah  and the Greek  pistis .  Essentially the meaning of the word  emunah  is that of active faith, better translated by the word "faith -fullness " or "active trust".  It is a typically Hebraic word in that it focuses on concrete actions and relationships.  It has strong existential tones and is thus life-oriented.  The Hellenistic idea of  pistis , on the other hand, focuses on the intellectual content of faith, its propositional base.  Faith is thus a kind of knowledge or belief.  Essentially, therefore, the focus on the Hellenistic concept of faith is on its  creedal  nature while the Hebraic is on its  existential  character. (p.133)

       Being sedentary sucks.  Let me re-phrase that, the  transition  from being sedentary to being active sucks.  I got invited to play racquetball with Tim and Aaron on Memorial Day.  Sounded like fun.  I used to play a lot or racquetball and got to be an average player.  But I haven't played in 2 years and really haven't done anything remotely like exercise since last October.  Well, that all changed yesterday.  Aaron, Tim and I played for a little while cut-throat and then some round-robin stuff when a guy approached us and started watching our play.  To make a long story short, this guy asked if I wanted to play him.  I said o.k.--we were down there to  urlLink build relationships  anyways, right?  Well, that was my first mistake.  The guy, Drossen, had me running around the court like a chicken with goggles on.  I held close for a little while but then the wheels fell off of this flabby, old body.  Today, I can barely get out of my car or climb the stairs.  Little daggers trickle up and down my thigh with every step.  My wife is making fun of me (I'm not sure that's new, though).  Feels good, though (except for the pain...)

       Met with the Christ-ites this morning although it was only a subset thereof.  O.k. it was just me and Aaron.  Anyways, Amy and I had been over to Aaron's over the weekend and spent some time with their small group.  It was good.  There was a point when Amy and I were talking to Alicia in the kitchen and were discussing a friend who was a goldsmith.  We commented on how goldsmithing is a cool, old career.  Like a stonecutter or something.  Alicia was reminded about the story that a metal worker knows when metal is refined when you can see your reflection in it.  She commented on how this was related to our Christian walk, that when we are properly refined, Christ can see His reflection in us.    "Yeah..."    But there's more to this conversation.  There's deeper ground that can be covered as we leap off of this comment.  But what is it?  As Amy and I reflected on it, we were wondering about how you transistion from 'regular' topics to 'spiritual' topics?  From 'news' to 'self'?  Normal conversation seems to realy boil down to the exchange of news items--redoing my deck, taking a vacation, what the kid did yesterday, problems my relatives are having, what we thought of the church service last weekend.  Each of these can be discussed in an objecttive sort of way.  There's very little depth to the conversation and almost no personal stake in them (even though we are sharing details of our lives).  Does that make sense?  But there is another whole class of conversation that deals with our hearts and our relationship with God.  These cannot be discussed in an objective sort of way.  These can only be discussed in the realm of personal disclosure.  They involve some level of exposure and vulnerability.  Without a doubt, these conversations happen best among close, 'safe' friends.  But, in an equally cathartic way, they can also happen with a complete stranger (the bartender scenario).  Of course with a complete stranger, there is little accountability or long-term benefit for those involved.  But that's getting off the topic.  The question is how do you transition from sharing news to sharing hearts and then back out again?  Or better yet, how do you establish an environment where the deeper type of exchanges can happen naturally?  Somewhere, buried in the answer to this question, is how you turn a social gathering of people Christians into Church.  I'd like to be able to do this without calling the conversation to a screeching halt.  But maybe you can't.  Maybe, due to the weight of 'real' conversation and out of respect of the person embarking on it, the situation requires that all 'shallower' conversation stop.  All of this goes back to wrestling with how we can make sure our conversations are always 'seasoned with salt'.  How we can avoid 'idle words' and 'coarse joking'.  Simply put, how our conversations reflect that we belong to Christ.  I know that doesn't mean that all of the laughter is taken out of hanging out and everyone has to speak King James English.  But I think there is an element that needs to be present.  The problem is, I don't know what that element is.  As usual, I don't know where I'm going with this.  So I'll just stop here.

       We hit the coffee shop this morning.  Just to have some coffee and hang out.  This is the second week in a row that Amy and I have gone down there.  The owners recognize us and we exchange pleasantries and I'm starting to recognize some of the other regulars.    On the way out, I scanned their free publication rack.  I was sucked in by one that said "Science of Spirituality" presented by Sant Rajinder Singh Ji Maharaj.  It turned out to be an ad on the back of  The Monthly Aspectarian--Dedicated to Awakening Consciousness .  I couldn't pass it up.   I love 'em.  Of course, I love picking up a  Weekly World News  or  National Enquirer  once or twice a year just for yucks.    There was a review of a book called  How To Make One Hell Of A Profit And Still Get To Heaven .  Sweet.  It stated:  For the purposes of this book, heaven represents a heartfelt state of appreciation, fulfillment, and presence--which means being in the here-and-now, not in the future with imagined fear or in the past with remembered guilt.  This heartfelt state arises from a perception of balance, harmony and order.  Lovely.  Heaven is a state of mind.  The book is about self-actualization as a means of creating "heaven".  There was another article called  The Essential Question .  About these essential questions that arise in the course of any life.  The question the guy asked was "What do you really want?"  Another decide-what-you-want-and-go-get-it piece of advice.  Another classic about two guys that went out for lunch and stopped in a clothing store on the way home.  They were admiring this $250 sweater and discussing its purchase.  (Now I'm not sure about two guys that go shopping for $250 sweaters together but I guess it happens...)  Anyway, the one guy ends up talking the other into buying it because "he's worth it".  The lesson learned by the author was:  Everything I purchase (and do) is a statement of what I believe I am worth. I am worth having anything I love. ... What I did: Wore my new sweater to work. Gave away the clothes I once bought because they were cheap, yet hated every time I wore them because they reminded me I am poor. Went through my credit card statement and considered every purchase an investment in myself. Holy Smokes!  What Horsgeschickte!  Do people really believe this stuff?  But after the laughter stopped, I really started looking at the magazine.  Page after page with ad after ad promising happiness, fulfillment, healing, answers, spirituality.  The solutions ranged from crystals to astrology to meditation to massage to hypnosis to chanelling and psychics.  People all have that hole in them that makes them incomplete.  The God-shaped hole that the Holy Spirit fills through the work of Jesus Christ.  Divination and paganism is as old as creation (well, almost as old).  People still chase it, actively searching for purpose and wholeness.  Their need is real.  Their pursuit is honest.  Only what they find is false.  The kicker was an interview with Weston Jolly.  A guy who channels with some sort of "divine connection" to answer people's questions.  The interview goes:   TMA:   What was your religious background?  WJ:  Very strict, biblically oriented, usuallyh referred to as fundamentalist.  Very strict biblical reference and everything is literal.  TMA:   Did you buy that version of the universe right up until this phenomena started?  WJ:   It was something that I joined when I met my beautiful wife, while we were engaged, and it's something that we left almost a year before this transition took place.  We outgrew what we felt like the ability of the church to share with us.  It was interesting because there were certain words in the Bible that really jumped and there weren't necessarily talked about.  Just the word  "light".  I remember I turned to her at church and pointed to that word and said, "Wow, there's something to that word that we're not talking about here."  In hindsight, of course, there's a whole aspect of illumination that oftentimes is missed in those kinds of organizations.  There are a vast number of people in the USA that are searching for spirituality and they are listening to people like Weston Jolly and Sant Rajinder Singh Ji Maharaj.  When you read or listen to some of this stuff (like that guy on PBS that talks about "Source") you hear so many of the themes that run through Christianity--a higher power/creator, other-orientedness, prayer, faith, kindness, the Spirit of light/love, finding fulfillment and purpose in a relationship to God.  It is everything  except  Jesus Christ.  By definition, you can't have Christianity without Jesus Christ but when you talk about what it means to be Christian how do you make clear Christ's role in it all?   I guess this is a question that bothers me because I have a sister-in-law who's quite interested in this kind of spirituality.  In fact, Jesus is one of the persons portrayed along side Swami Ramajamaspumoni (or whatever).  When the visible lifestyle is so similar, it's hard to describe the difference in the origin of that life.  For me, the one question that keeps me centered is: if this stuff is true, then why did Jesus have to die on the cross?  I dunno.

       So I got a pretty cool little gift in the mail last night.  It was a CD from my Mom.  Apparently, while she was at my brother's house in Boulder Creek, they had a little recording session.  It contains 27 classical piano pieces plus a "original musings" track of her own plinking.  My Mom was a dual major in college:  Education and Music.  Her music major was in Concert Piano and we grew up with a baby grand piano in the house and someone who could actually play it.  I don't know much about pianos but the one we had must have been a pretty good one because every piano tuner that came to the house asked if they could play it for a while after they tuned it.  All I know is that when my Mom would play, the entire house would be overflow.  I'll always remember her playing on Saturday afternoons.  We would go to church on Saturday evenings so we could have Sundays at home together.  But after we would play outside all day Saturday, we would be called in to get cleaned up for church.  Well, as soon as Mom was ready, she'd sit down at the piano and begin to play.  When you heard that music you knew that you'd better get going or else!  But I can also remember laying underneath the piano while she played.  The sound would penetrate my entire being.  To this day, I love the sound of live piano and I credit my Mom with giving me an appreciation for classical music of all kinds.  Now, I have a recording--forever--of her playing.  It's great to hear her.  I don't get to much anymore.  Her arthritis got too bad to play often so she gave our piano to my oldest sister.  Mom bought one of those electric pianos and still plays but it isn't the same.  I really appreciate having a memory of her that speaks more than a picture.  Listening conjurs up all kinds of feelings of growing up and of her.  She's a pretty special lady with a gift for giving of herself.  She's 76 now but around her 70th birthday she took the time to write down her life story.  It's a timeless treasure that gives me insight into her childhood, courtship and marriage to my father, her working career, her experiences in motherhood and as a wife, her walk with God, her struggles with cancer, etc.  As I grow I meet very few people who had the childhood I had.  I grew up in a family where Mom and Dad loved each other, where the kids got along (most of the time), where we were always provided for.  I was never worried about the love and support of my parents (regardless of how many times I screwed up).  I was taught how to handle money, cook, teach myself and others, be a loyal worker, be faithful to my wife, and care for my kids.  Priceless.  Thanks for the tunes, Mom...and so much more.

       Another amazing devotion from Oswald Chambers in  My Utmost .  In our little human minds it is so easy to forget that God created time and is eternal.  (Emphasis added is mine.)       AFTER OBEDIENCE - WHAT?       And straightway He constrained His disciples to get into the ship, and to go to the other side. . . ." Mark 6:45-52   We are apt to imagine that if Jesus Christ constrains us, and we obey Him, He will lead us to great success. We must never put our dreams of success as God's purpose for us; His purpose may be exactly the opposite. We have an idea that God is leading us to a particular end, a desired goal; He is not. The question of getting to a particular end is a mere incident.  What we call the process, God calls the end.    What is my dream of God's purpose? His purpose is that I depend on Him and on His power now. If I can stay in the middle of the turmoil calm and unperplexed, that is the end of the purpose of God.  God is not working towards a particular finish; His end is the process  - that I see Him walking on the waves, no shore in sight, no success, no goal, just the absolute certainty that it is all right because I see Him walking on the sea.  It is the process, not the end, which is glorifying to God.    God's training is for now, not presently. His purpose is for this minute, not for something in the future. We have nothing to do with the afterwards of obedience; we get wrong when we think of the afterwards. What men call training and preparation, God calls the end.   God's end is to enable me to see that He can walk on the chaos of my life just now. If we have a further end in view, we do not pay sufficient attention to the immediate present: if we realize that obedience is the end, then each moment as it comes is precious.

       So I finished reading  The Secret Life of Cowboys  on my trip to Israel.&nbsp; I started out not liking it too much but then it really started to grow on me.&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't usually read&nbsp;biographies so I wasn't used to the 'untidiness' of our life stories.&nbsp; But really, life doesn't come with an antogonist and protagonist, a theme, central characters, etc.   Anyways I'll probably post comments on a couple of the things I read.&nbsp; One of the sections that really struck me was Tom's experience with trying to learn to ride broncos.&nbsp; In sort of a thrill-seeking endeavor, he signed up at a Bronco Riding school.&nbsp; The following is what he wrote about the first day in class:    When I climb off the machine, I am wheezing and out of breath.&nbsp; Red says, "Let's go to the horses."   I didn't think we'd go near the horses the first day.&nbsp; I thought we'd spend time talking about it first, discussing bucking chute procedure, the basic psychology of a horse, strategies of mounting and dismounting broncs.&nbsp; I imagined the class would include a battle plan mapped out on a big chalkboard with mock-ups of the arena and the position of the pickup men and paramedics clearly labeled.&nbsp; Videotapes would be played and paused at critical moments, the action frozen so we could analyze the mistakes of other riders.&nbsp; We would get a lesson on the theory and practice of rodeo.&nbsp; But here we are, gathering our saddles and gear and heading for the bucking chutes, which are already loaded with horses.&nbsp; I can hear the gates slamming, men swearing, hooves kicking steel and wood.&nbsp; It is otherworldly, like the moment Jennifer walked down the aisle toward me.&nbsp; Like the time I jumped out of the airplane.&nbsp;&nbsp; Here I go again.     I couldn't help but think of my walk with God in this example.&nbsp; How I would so much rather study my Bible in the safety of my home; discuss the finer points of "loving my neighbor" with my already-Christian friends.&nbsp; How I'd really rather just mind my own business rather than place others ahead of myself.&nbsp; How I'd rather know  about  Christ rather than  know  Christ.&nbsp;   Lately, as I embark on my journey toward a new kind of Christianity (for me), I am forced to deal with this issue again and again:&nbsp; the thought of a Christian life that is lived out rather than understood.&nbsp; Where the Holy Spirit is truly given free reign with my day and my life rather than me picking an choosing the way I will "serve" Him.&nbsp; One that is focused on developing right- living  rather than right- believing .   It's a wonderful adventure but, like riding a bucking bronco for the first time or getting married or going skydiving, you cannot know the end from the beginning and once you start, there is no looking back.

       A neighbor of mine fell sick a couple weeks ago.&nbsp;&nbsp;Her husband&nbsp;couldn't get her to the car/hospital because of the pain so they called 911.&nbsp; After a night in the hospital and some surgery a few days later, she is on her road to recovery.  Amy and I knew them and had talked with them before.&nbsp; They are both Christians--out there working out their salvation, not perfect but walking with Him.&nbsp; As I was talking to her, she began to share the lessons that God was teaching her and the people around her--what's important, to slow down, to listen.&nbsp; She talked about changes that would now have to take place at her job and in her home--physical, emotional, and spiritual.&nbsp; Since they had called 911 and a big fire truck had been parked in the street for a couple hours, she also had the attention of the neighbors.&nbsp; It was great to hear of the conversations she and her husband&nbsp;had had with our neighbors.&nbsp; We talked about what a great opportunity it was to share the grace and goodness of God with them.  After we parted, I began to reflect on the conversation.&nbsp; God revealed something to me--she's a member of my church.&nbsp; I don't mean that we go to the same place on Sunday mornings--we don't.&nbsp; I mean that she is a member of my Church. God has placed me in a specific place and has placed people all around me.&nbsp; These people are members of my Church.&nbsp; Some of them know Jesus.&nbsp; Some of them still need to meet Him.&nbsp; Regardless, they are members of my Church.  I began to recognize each of my neighbors in this same way.&nbsp; But that doesn't mean that I am going to start "intentional" relationships so I can disciple them and "lead them to Christ".&nbsp; I'm not going to start a Bible study for my block or hold worship services in the street.&nbsp; I don't think I have to.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Spirit is already on it.&nbsp; What I will do is start to look at each of them through different eyes.&nbsp; To begin to simply care for them, help them, meet them where they are, love them.&nbsp; I have finally woken up to their presence (and God's presence among them).&nbsp; When I see opportunity, I pray that I will move to respond--not with a Gospel tract but with what they need at the time.  After all, they  are  members of my Church...

       Well,&nbsp; I'm back.&nbsp; The trip went really well.&nbsp; My seats weren't as bad as expected on the plane.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I still had the middle and had to climb over people but only one.&nbsp; One of the guys I went with was up a lot so it wasn't a big deal to get out and stretch.   The meetings went well.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was funny, the first night, we went to a Chinese restaurant and my fortune cookie fortune basically said "keep your mouth shut".&nbsp; Now, I don't place my faith in fortune cookies but I do believe that God can speak to me in any way He chooses.&nbsp; Since I had been praying along these lines, I took the advice.&nbsp;&nbsp; I spent time listening and evaluating.&nbsp; I asked questions or pointed out facts when appropriate.&nbsp;&nbsp; As a company and a corporation, I think we moved forward.&nbsp; Personally, I didn't burn any bridges.  The trip was nice, too.&nbsp; The food there is fantastic.&nbsp; It is so interesting to spend a week eating food which you can only identify about half the time.&nbsp; One night was spent at&nbsp;The Decks restaurant&nbsp;in Tiberias on the Sea of Galilee.&nbsp; A cook-at-the-table place.&nbsp; We sat on basically a dock with tables right out into the lake.&nbsp; Pretty cool to scan around the hills and think that Jesus spent most of His ministry right there.&nbsp; I kept looking for the cliff where the herd of pigs ran off and drown themselves but I didn't know which direction Gergasenes was.  I think I'll be going back, just don't know when.&nbsp;&nbsp; Next time it would be nice to be able to take my wife.&nbsp; It's kind of sad to be sitting on&nbsp;the beach&nbsp;watching the sun dip into the Mediterranean or to enjoy a phenomenal meal with all the trimmings&nbsp;and not have the love-of-your-life beside you.&nbsp;

       Will this saga nver end?&nbsp; Andie is heading back to the doctor today (in fact, in about an hour).&nbsp; One of the internal stitches is pocking up out of her scar and it has become just a little bit infected.&nbsp; Amy has to take her to the doctor so they and get the rogue stitch out of there and clean up the infection.&nbsp; This will involve making a small incision.  &nbsp; Our prayer is that Andie can remain calm or at least not cry hysterically before the procedure&nbsp; starts.&nbsp; Once it's going, that she can endure it bravely.&nbsp;&nbsp; And once it is over, to calm down quickly.&nbsp;

       So, now that  urlLink the ideas  are out there, it's time to reflect on myself. When I first moved to Rockford in '88 I was young, single, employed, and, looking back on it, had nothing but time on my hands. I was also without Christ.   Within the first year, I was hanging out with "the boys" from work 3-4 nights per week. Mostly we hit the bars and drank too much but we'd also other stuff together--canoe, fish, frisbee golf, volleyball, saw concerts, whatever. In the summer, I was in a golf league and golfed a couple times a week outside of league time. I started biking and doing&nbsp;"fun rides" with the Blackhawk Bicycle Club. In the winter, I joined&nbsp;racquetball leagues at the Y, used to go down on Monday nights for the challenge court, and got into a couple of tournaments. I joined the Masters (an adult swim team), also at the Y, and swam 4 days a week plus a couple of meets per year. We used to go out for breakfast at the Stockholm Inn after practice on Saturday.   After 8 years of this, I found my wife and Jesus Christ. Both of whom completely changed my life...for the best.   Within a year, I was regularly attending church. I was helping out as teacher for 2-3 year olds on Wednesday nights. I was attending a small group each week. I was helping out with the chair set up for Sunday mornings and helping with the communion and offering during service. I was hanging out with a lot of new friends--playing games, grilling out, watching movies, sharing lives. I got married and we started life as "a couple". We started a home and a family. We took several trips to various places. I spent almost all of my free time with my wife and kids. I stopped almost all of my other activities. I loved my kids and knew that I had limited time to invest in their lives--and this was the most important (and rewarding) thing I could do. Over time, I served as a deacon and then an elder. I hosted and then led a small group. We attended almost all of the church events (there were many and they were a lot of fun) and helped out where we could.   Again, after about 8 years of this, I started to look at things in a slightly different way.   Now, I see the shift in my relationship to the world. At first, I was 'in' the world--the good, the bad and the ugly of it. Of course, this was easy because that's all there was, I thought. Then, I found out about another 'world' and more importantly, I found out that I belonged in that world and not this one. I no longer felt comfortable in this world so I withdrew from it and involved myself in what I thought was "God's world". But I've come to realize that the world that "God so loved" was the same world I withdrew from. Now I have to ask myself how to insert myself back into that world and begin to love it the way He does (not the way I did). I guess this is what they call "being missional".  &nbsp;  So now we'll see where I go.&nbsp; God never does anything randomly.&nbsp;&nbsp; He gave me all of these experiences over the last 16 years and now He is ready to show me more.&nbsp;&nbsp; It will be interesting to integrate my 'wordly' experience with the teaching He has given me inside the church.&nbsp;&nbsp; There's a quote in  The Secret Life of Cowboys  from Tom's first boss.&nbsp; He (Tom) was fresh out of college and fresh into ranching.&nbsp; He boss said "Now that you have learned by rote, you are ready to learn by magic."&nbsp; That's it.&nbsp; I've spent 8 years learning "by rote" inside the church.&nbsp; Now it's time to take that knowledge out and begin to learn "by magic".

       I read  urlLink this post  on the Living Room blog and, of course, I took another turn off of the topic to ask a different question.  The sentence that got me thinking was this one:  Cafes in Australia are not very interactive spaces (we go to the pub to interact with strangers - cafes are for quite chats with friends or silent times alone with a book or paper).   The question I asked myself is--where is an American's "interactive space"?  Where do we go "to interract with strangers"?  I started thinking about  bars --people seem to go with their friends and, if anything, are out to pick up members of the opposite sex for...  I guess there are some areas of a bar that are good for interraction--like the dart board or pool table.  You can always take on challengers and meet someone that way.  But of course becoming a regular has its own problems.   Coffee shops  seem to be similar to the ones in Australia--people go either for quiet chats with friends or quiet times of reading alone.  Regulars do interract and the owner is almost always ready to sit and chat with the patrons.   Malls  are definitely compartmentalized with either groups of friends just hanging out together (and checking out other groups of friends) or people just shopping.   Parks  hold a chance for interraction among children and adults.  Probably a good space to hang out but it would be hard to develop something over time.  People generally don't frequent parks at the same time or day.   Neighborhoods  are probably the easiest place to hang out but when I think of American culture, the trend is more toward the back deck than the front porch.  (Back deck being a private space, Front porch being an exposed, semi-private space.)  Even then, if you hang out on your front stoop (more likely in today's architecture) there probably isn't a sidewalk in front of your house.   Work  is another public place where you can establish meaningful and regular relationships.  This is a fine-line since I really thing I was hired to work, not build friendships.  But there still are breaks, lunches, after work times where the people you see everyday can be invested in.   Clubs and sports leagues  are still another way of placing yourself into an environment that will generate interraction.  I have built some good relationships with people through friendly competition or shared fitness training.  I just was never intentional about the direction of those relationships before.   Hmmm....  I really didn't have an answer in mind when I started the post but writing it got the juices flowing.  Got any others?

       I CAN'T BELIEVE IT!  I just got my seat assignments for my flight to Israel.  On the leg from O'Hare to Zurich, I will be stuck in the  center  seat of the 5 seat center section!!!!  This is the exact same seat I had on my flight to and from Germany in January and it SUCKED!  You don't get an armrest and if you have to go to the bathroom or get up, you have to climb over 2 people regardless of which way you go.  Aaaaaaaaaaauuugh!  At least on the way home, it looks like I get the window.  (Whew!  I feel better now but it doesn't make the flight any easier.)

       I just got my copy of  The Secret Life of Cowboys  from Amazon.  I pretty pumped.  It was written by Tom Groneberg who is a friend of mine from Jr. High/High School.  He found my blog and  urlLink commented  on my Missing Photo post.   It is the second time he has contacted me in the last 4 years.  The first time, he had just gotten married and moved to Montana to become a rancher.  He had taken in a couple of foster children.  Now he has a 4 year old son and two twin boys.    We were in a  really  bad band in high school called Terrible Tim and the Trippers.  Named after our bassist, Terrible, Trippin' Tim Pyburn (where is he now?).  Tom played drums and I played rhythm guitar.  Our lead guitarist, Steve Timble, I know continued to pursue a career as a rock 'n' roll star and was in a band with his little brother called Reaction Formation.  They played in the U of I bar scene for a while and opened for The Replacements (I think) when they played at NIU somewhere around '85-86.  Don't know where he is now either.  Anyways, I'm looking forward to reading  Cowboys  since it seems to be largely autobiographical.  It'll be like crawling into Tom's head to see what he's been doing over the last 10 years or so.

       Tim made  urlLink reference  to detoxing from the church and the adjustment from having his Christianity defined by what he did on Sundays and Wednesdays.  I think I'm seeing what he means.  For one reason or another, I have not been in service on Sunday morning for the past 4 weeks and I will be missing 2 of the next 3 Sundays as well.  This usually happens every summer for my family as we begin our cluster of vacations but this time it seems like it is longer than normal.  Helping in children's church a couple times and taking a business trip aren't helping matters either.  But as I reflect on all this time away from the Sunday gatherings, I'm examining what is left of my Christianity.  If you walked with me the whole time, you would see choices I make and language I use that differs from what the world calls 'normal'.  You'd see me spending time in prayer, devotions and Bible reading.  You'd see me pray before meals, travel and bed with my family.  Eat with, meet with and help my brothers and sisters in Christ.  Occasionally, you'd hear a comment that reflected a 'Christian world-view' (whatever that is) or see me refrain from conversations that aren't 'edifying'.  (Of course, you'd also see me screw up more than a few times and lose my temper or joke unbecomingly or judge others harshly.)  I guess this *is* being a Christian--but why doesn't it *feel* like being a Christian?  The only conclusion I can come to is that these day-to-day things aren't what I  traditionally identified as Christian behaviors.  Sure, these are practices that every Christian should be doing but is it the primary definition of what I term a Christian?  I seem to have limited Christian behavior into church attendance and church involvement.  If I go to church every Sunday--I'm a 'practicing' or 'active' Christian.  If I serve in my church every Sunday--I'm an 'involved' Christian.   If I lead a ministry or a small group--I'm a 'committed' Christian.   I know that I cannot live a full Christian life apart from a community of believers that are engaged in worship, teaching, fellowship, and prayer but I also know that I cannot rely on that community for my identity in Christ.  This will be next challenge in my developing relationship with Jesus Christ--to seek Him and Him alone; to lose (and find) my identity solely in Him.

       We're back.  A long, tiring but fun weekend.  Packing up on Friday the clouds were building and the thunder was rumbling.  There's something nerve-racking about packing up a sleeping bag and a tent when it's fixing to rain.  Visions of being wet for 60 hours straight come flashing past.  Of course, looking at the hourly forecast and seeing "Scattered Thunderstorms" for the whole weekend wasn't encouraging either.    It rained for most of the drive to the campground--pretty hard at times--but when we got there it had stopped.  The campround apparently got socked.  A bunch of the sites (unoccupied) were underwater and ours had some pretty large puddles on it.  It turned out to work in our favor, though.  Now we knew where the water would collect if it *did* rain later and we could set up elsewhere.  We set up without getting wet.  My sisters arrived and soon our camp looked like home.  We had some time to hang out, get the lay of the land, let the kids take a dip in the pool, and play a little in the lake.  After dinner the rain started.   A gentle, persistent rain.  Blake was going to be sleeping with Kristina in my sister's tent.  They were in there playing while it rained with the door open.  Needless to say, the tent and half of their stuff got soaked before the adults were called in.  This, of course, led to a full-fledged sleeping bag shuffle as everyone's sleeping arrangements were shifted.   It ended up with Kristina sleeping in the camper, Therese and John sleeping in the car, and Blake sleeping with us.  That meant, for the first time since we have been camping, our whole family was sleeping together in the same tent. (Usually, the girls sleep in a little 2-man tent by themselves while Amy and I sleep in the "big tent".)  It was neat to lay there in the dark together listening to the rain softly drumming on the tent.  We talked about the rain and the tent and staying dry.  Amy prayed and we all went to sleep.  In the morning, another neat time of waking up and beginning to talk and tickle the day to a start.  Saturday was full of swimming and playing at the lake and pool and playground and was capped off with a great meal of country ribs and burgers accompanied by the traditional s'mores around the campfire.  A good day.  Sunday we went to pack up.  Always a melancholy part of the trip.  The girls were sitting in the car (out of the way) while we packed up.  Amy was over there and the girls said the car was making a funny clicking noise.  I went over and the sound was coming from the ignition.  It got the key and tried to start the car--nothing.  Crap!  Somehow, the battery had gotten drained after all the ins and outs over the weekend.  I was ticked but it really turned out to be no big deal.  We got a jump and were on our way.  After packing up camp we went to D-Z's house to see my sister Marybeth.  She moved to Tennessee last Christmas and this was a rare opportunity to see her family while they were in the area.  Another nice visit.    Recently, I've really enjoyed getting together with my family.  There are 16 cousins (only 9 present this weekend) who all get along great.  I love to see the kids interract as they enjoy their extended family.  It was something I didn't have growing up.  After a tearful good bye (Blake crying because she hates to leave her cousin's house, Andie crying because she hates being forced to use the bathroom before we leave), we got on the road for home.  It was good to get back home and to sleep in a real bed.  I'm getting too old to sleep on the ground.  A good trip.

       I got my itinerary for my trip to the Holy Land (on business) finally.  It kind of perturbs me--they tell me  urlLink 8 weeks ago  that I will be going to Israel the third week of July (week 30) but then don't actually book the flight until 9 days before.  It would have been nice to know a little earlier...but that's all crumbs off the muffin now, so to speak.  This should prove to be a rather interesting trip.  I really don't get along too well with our Israeli counterparts.  I think some of it is cultural (self-absorbed independent American meets do-as-I-say Israeli), some of it is my own stubbornness, and some of it is actually business.  I had been dreading it but, over the last few weeks as I have prayed about it, I'm finding that I'm am less and less worried about it.  Now I'm even a little excited about discussing some of the future design of the system that links our companies.  The funny thing is that the guys I'm going with seem to be getting more and more excited about the trip (in a bad, confrontational way) as we go along.  No matter what happens, it will be another chance for me to be cramped up in a coach class seat for 8 hours, drink a German beer in a Swiss airport, and see a little bit of Galilee.  I leave from O'Hare at 4:40pm on the 17th (that means leaving from Rockford at 1:10) and arrive in Tel Aviv at 2:49 on the 18th.  We'll drive from Tel Aviv to Nahariya--about a 2 hour drive.  The roads are pretty good there--Western style--more like USA than Europe.  Then we go to work on Monday morning in Tefen.  It'll be a meeting between the production and logistics (inventory planning) people from Israel (Iscar), Korea (TeaguTec), Germany and USA (Ingersoll).  I'm sure there will be a vast smattering of other side issues that will basically either result in a task list that would last me until '07 or much ado about nothing.  We leave at 5:30 am (that's like the crack of dawn--if you have to get to the airport 2 hours before International travel that's like 3:30 in the middle of the night!) from Tel Aviv on the 22nd and arrive around 12:50pm at O'Hare the same day.  I should be home for dinner on Thursday the 22nd.  I think I'll take Friday off to recoup and spend with the kids.

       Well, we're off again.  This time were camping at the  urlLink Hi-Tide Recreation  area in Leland IL.  We're going with my two sisters and their families for the 4th or 5th annual GVA camping trip.  Our kids are the youngest so it's usually pretty cool because all of the cousins go off together to play leaving the adults to take care of the serious camping work.  The weather looks like it is shaping up to be pretty warm this weekend--hopefully it will cool down in the evenings.  I'm looking forward to chatting with my brother-in-law.  We had some nice conversation shortly after the Passion came out but haven't had time to follow up on it.  He is a Catholic that "gets it" and has a true appreciation for the traditions of the Catholic faith on top of it.  Nothing wrong with traditions, as long as you understand their purpose.   Think of me as I bask in the pool or at the beach...

       It is becoming our tradition on the 4th of July to skip the "big" fireworks that Rockford puts on and go up to the Rockford Country Club and enjoy a fireworks display that they put on.  It a little smaller than the city show but the crowd is a lot smaller and we can walk there rather than drive (that avoids the whole parking hassle).  We gathered at Ron and Cher's place and formed a mini wagon parade up to the park.  Once we got there, Northeast had pretty much a whole section of the park--Mike and Dee, Ed and Kory, Erin and Patrick (even though Patrick stayed home), Frank and Amanda, Stu and Stacia, Wayne and Angie, Tim and Amy, Amy and Bob, Ron and Cher, Tim and Deb, Aaron and Tina, Alex and Amanda, Dave and Kim, Val and Ron, not counting everyone's kids.  I, of course, was able to eat my traditional cherries at the fireworks which is really the most important aspect of the whole day.  Here's some of the photos that Aaron sent over.     urlLink    Aaaah&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Here's a gang of goobers if ever I saw one&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Deb, Tim, and the funniest little girl I've met in a long time.&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Alex the kid-magnet and his wife.&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Zowie!&nbsp; urlLink       urlLink    Our friendly neighborhood photographer and the woman who makes him great.&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    The ever-photogenic couple, chillin' on the deck.&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Oooooh&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    These are the glasses that will change the world for Ron.  He's already been that ray of sunshine that lights every room he enters (cough) but now he can see what it's like to know him.  With these glasses the whole room looks like it is filled with sunshine--now our drab existences can be artifically altered into light-shedding, life-giving rays of sun.  Will the miracles of modern technology never cease....&nbsp; urlLink

       Here are some snippets of conversations I had with Andie tonight:   D:  Andie don't pull at your bottom.  A:  O.K.   (Later)   D : Andie, do you have to go potty?  A:  No.  D:  Then why do you keep pulling at your bottom?  A:  My undies keep bunching up my crack.   (Later)   A:  Daddy, I think I know why my undies were bunching up, I think they are Blake's.  D:  How did you get Blake's undies on?  A:  I don't know.  (further inspection)   D:  Andie, you have them on wrong.  You used a leg hole as the top.  The top is over here.  A:  Oh (hee hee hee hee)    (Night-time prayers)   A:  Thank you God for my elephants. Thank you for watching 3-2-1 Penguins. Thank you for Nicholas and Ainsley. Thank you for how they treat us. Amen.

       Well, it's raining tonight and our suspicions about a leaky roof have been confirmed.  It looks like we have a leak around our sewer vent.  The water is running down the outside of the pipe and getting into the ceiling of our first floor.  Put a  very  temporary stop-gap up there tonight and will have to take another look at it when it's dry.  We had the bathroom done 7 years ago and the guy who did it did something up on the roof 'cause we had the leak then, too.  Hopefully, we can do something like that again rather than getting a whole new roof (which Ron estimates at $4,100--he's not a roofer but he plays a Chaplain during the day...)

       In our study on Sunday night, we were discussing  urlLink Psalm 101  and the forceful language David uses when dealing with evil.  He, being king, was able to exert this type of force on his subjects and his enemies.  As we discussed "force", Luke 16:16 came up:   The Law and the Prophets were proclaimed until John. Since that time, the good news of the kingdom of God is being preached, and everyone is forcing his way into it.   The NIV Life Application Bible has a footnote that indicates that while the exact interpretation was disputed, it is generally accepted that this speaks to the multitudes that were responding to Jesus' message of the Kingdom of God.   The Bible Gateway  urlLink commentary  puts a different spin on it stating that the word for "force" is a passive use that refers to the message being applied  to  everyone rather than  by  everyone.  I'm not sure I agree with either.  In  urlLink context , Jesus is addressing the Pharisees and their desire to appear righteous before men rather than before God.  This coupled with the reality of Jesus ministry (he ended up with relatively few devoted followers--most of the multitudes that followed Him seemed more interested in the healing and miracles than Kingdom life) makes me think that this verse doesn't address His "success" or some promise that is extended to all.  A very similar phrasing appears also in  urlLink Matthew .  Here there is an interesting illustration of how "this generation" is like children who want things their way.  I plan to study this this week but my initial impression is that Jesus is addressing people who hear the Good News of the Kingdom and then adapt what it means to suit their own desires--rather than the Truth.    If you want to look into this section too, please do.
