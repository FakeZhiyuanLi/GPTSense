      Life is good. Mwahahahahahaha!!! ^_^  Anyway, I didn't get to go with my friend to Megamall today *sigh*. My dad got home early and didn't let me *curses*. Pero, ok lang. Masarap matulog. ^_^  I've finished my  urlLink barkada's website ! Yipee! Check it out! ^_+ I'm glad they liked it. Bwehehehehe!  (I'm gonna start being random again) My sister left 1:00 in the morning today and went to Baguio with his boyfriend's family to see him. His boyfriend is studying in PMA (Phil. Military Academy) and they have a grand ball or something and my sister was invited. Wala lang, I just felt like sharing. My sister always talks about her boyfriend and I really think she really loves him. My sister is a sucker when it comes to love. She's been hurt many times - I should know, because I'm always the one teasing her whenever she's crying about a guy. ^_^ But I'm glad that this time, she finally found him. Congrats! ^_^  Tomorrow is my cousin's birthday. Woohoo! Kainan na naman. ^_^ I dunno, I've been eating too much food for the past few days. I'm so glad that I'm not getting fat!  ^_^ Share ko ulit sa inyo - you know what my classmates tell me - I'm one of the most attractive girls in my school because of my body. "Really funny." I would tell them sarcastically and roll my eyes. ^_^  Oops, gotta run, I think 7th Heaven na! Babush!

      Woohoo!! No classes today! Thank God we can take a rest after those cruel exams!! I think I only got 79% in Mathematics! God, I can't sleep last night because I was thinking about my grades! I'm just gonna approach my teacher and ask for a remedial because I'm obviously not contented with that grade if I'm running for 2nd Honor.  Anyway, this morning, I watched "You Got Served" on DVD. They really had great moves and I was like "Uuhhh....whoah....uuuhhhh....COOL!!" By the time I finished it, I took a quick shower, got dressed, then went to my friend's house. We're supposed to meet by 10 in the morning to play Badminton somewhere in Project 6. But before we did, we dropped by our school to pick up our other friend. By 12, we were on our way. The court was pretty big and cheap too. I played one round for doubles and stopped because I don't wanna sweat too much cuz I didn't bring any extra clothes. By 1:30, our guys had to go cuz they have a basketball game, so me and the 2 girls went to Robinsons Metro East.   Tomorrow we still don't have classes. I don't know why but I'm still glad. ^_^ I'll just stay at home for a change cuz I MIGHT go to Megamall on Saturday cuz my friend wants me to accompany her to an EB with "really cute guys". The offer is too temptating. ^_^

I think I already have another account here, but I can't remember my password and username. Can someone slap me right in the face and tell me "Stop bitching around and decide which blog you're gonna keep!!!" hahahaha! O.A.!  Anyway, I'm gonna blog again maybe next week or on Friday. I really got I tight schedule but I'll try and squeeze this in. ^_^ Ciao!
