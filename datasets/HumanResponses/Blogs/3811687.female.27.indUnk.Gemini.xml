       So today's the 31st.... My ex's wedding day, yup the bastard's getting married... again. At least this time he told me. So maybe i'm still upset about the last time, even though it is kind of funny

      Slowly cheering up... actually it's not that bad... . just tired is all. but it helps to go online but sadly i'm becoming more antisocial in real life. although sometimes i feel bad for ignoring my r/l  friends to be online

      Theres something to be said for random people. People who come into your life for a brief time, even just a few seconds. The old man at the grocery store who makes you laugh, or a baby that makes you smile. Sometimes someone says something and it changes the way you look at people.  That was cheesy....  I'm usually not this nice...  You'll see

      my first post...   Life's a little crazy right now.  meaningless stuff in the grand scheme of things.  but anyway...  my minds a little lost, and I need a place to put my thoughts...however crazy they might be.    J~

       yet another sleepless night... my evil bitchboi kitty keeps biting me. i could shut the door, but of course that thought just came to me now.  he bites in the weirdest places too, my nose, fingertips and toes.  freak of a cat. So yeah... I have an evil kitty, actually 2 kitties and probably 20 or so gerbils. the fuckers keep multipying.  I seperated them, but I didn't do a good job. the cage that was supposed to have all boys, now has babies.   yes this is my blog and i may ramble on about my pets if i wish
