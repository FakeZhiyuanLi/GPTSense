      Why does anyone do a blog, if no one's gonna read it. No one's gonna read this, so I might as well not write it. Maybe we do it to escape. To think out loud. To let some shit out. I don't know. Over and Out

      I have nothing to do while my cd's burning, so I'm going to write my second blog today. Let's talk about theme park rides. I like coasters. They're all like 'whooooooooooo!' I went on my first loop today. It was scary, and I've got fucking bad whiplash, but I'm Ok. I think. Hell's Gate is so scary, you get in this big tube thing and you spin and turn and oh shit, it's scary! Oh shit, that's the name of one of my 3 cactai, Ouch, Arrrgh! and Oh Shit! I named them after what I said after touching their spikes for the first time. They like to soak up the sun in my room. Ah bless...........Ouch! Arrgh! Oh Shit! It was dark once and I went through my room, almost tripped on the crap on the floor and landed on them. I mainly got Arrrgh!ed, as he (or she)'s the tallest. Ouch is a normal castus, tall and straight (Like me :) ) Arrgh is taller than Ouch and his (or her) spikes are surrounded with soft fluff. Oh Shit is a big yellow flower with killer inch-long spikes hidden underneath (you can imagine why I said 'Oh Shit'). I don't favor any of them anymore than any other flower or plant, but I love them, awwww......Ouch! Arrgh! Oh, Shit!

      I got an MP3 player a few days ago! It's a tiny RCA Lyra one with 190megs of space with my card in. I have 101 tracks of pure 'Tones, Blink, Lostprophets, and other good shit. It's so small! Anyway, school's out and I'm now officially a grade 8. For our last day of school we went to Playland, the theme park place in Vancouver. I got whiplash, sick and bruised, but it was fun. Over and out.

      It's 3am Sunday morning. I hate Sundays. It's like a weekend with all the crappy parts of school (apart from school). And the atmosphere's always cold and dark, like someone's just died. It's weird; apart from Tuesday (The day when it suddenly dawns on you that you've got the whole week to go: Monday's just 'Ug' day.), Sunday's my least favorite day, yet I was born on a Sunday. Ironic. I was actually due on Friday the 13th, but I was 2 days late. I've only had 2hrs sleep in over 48 hours, and I'm slipping off now. Must........finish.......blog.............. My hair's a lot longer now, or it seems longer now it's all fluffed up. My profile pic was taken yesterday, and now my hair seems twice as long. Strange. I'm trying to grow it to my shoulders or longer, but my brother, who I was racing with, gave up and had it cut. Loser. Anyway, I'm sleepy. Gonna go in my room and listen to some 'Tones. Night.

      Welcome to my blog. I will tell you about the teeny-eeny parts of my life that I want to tell you. Most of the stuff I don't want to tell you, but I don't care. Over and out.

      As you should know, I support filesharing and http://www.suprnova.org is the king of all things good and shared. I also spend a lot of my time on the forums: http://www.suprnovaforums.com where I can be found as kier. Anyway, I have recently been looking around and playing with Photoshop and have made some quite nice banners (in my opinion) here are some of them:  urlLink     urlLink    And my current Suprnovaforum Sig:   If you want a free sig, feel free to email me (djcrazymonkey@gmail.com)or leave a comment. I like to leave with a question, it's like my thing (from now on anyway). So, what do you think of filesharing? Is it good, bad or don't you really care? Something for you to think about. Leave comments on your thoughts.
