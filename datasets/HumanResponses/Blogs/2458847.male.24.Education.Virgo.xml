      I like the snow. This blizzard is kind of a blessing for me. Walking in, and marveling at the snow this evening, my mind, probably staying with the theme "good things", started to move to St. Petersburg, Russia where this summer I had the experience of venerating the relics of  urlLink St. Xenia of Petersburg ...the fool for Christ.    urlLink This isn't my picture , in fact...it's much better than the one I took there. I began by walking through an almost empty graveyard, with just a few old women praying by the grave sides of departed husbands, mothers and fathers. After a short walk I came upon  the chapel that houses St. Xenia's coffin and holy relics. This Friday morning there were a couple of women outside of the chapel lighting candles and praying to St. Xenia. I walked around the side of the tiny chapel to find the door... upon walking in I was surprised to find the place packed with people. As I walked in and got on line to venerate the relics, a priest and what appeared to be part of the choir from his parish came into the chapel.  Almost immediately the choir went to a little "choir loft" and the priest began a panakhida . Suddenly the chapel was filled with prayers for the reposed and the choir beautifully and loudly chanting "Gospodi Pomilui!"(Lord, have mercy!) Really a tremendous experience...to witness all of this devotion. After finally leaving the chapel I made my way out of the cemetery, this time going a different route. At the cemetery's exit I came to a couple of old women begging for some money. After giving them a few rubles they gratefully crossed themselves and prayed for me... I couldn't help but think of St. Xenia's days spent wandering and praying around that very spot.

      Welcome to my blog.  Just what is it that I, living a life of near absolute boredom and depravity, have to offer the viewing public? Not much. Enjoy!

      Today marks the two year anniversary of my mother's miraculous healing after emergency surgery to remove a brain tumor. At that time, her doctors believed she would live about one year. After surgery, radiation, and clinical trials to treat her tumor (Glioblastoma Multiforme-worst tumor there is) and through Christ and the prayers of St. Nektarios and St. John of San Francisco, there are no signs of this tumor left.  She still suffers greatly from the affects of her medication, and the cancer could reappear at any time...but for now we are thankful to God for what we have!   O Lord my Savior and my Master, I, Thine unprofitable servant, with fear and trembling give thanks unto Thy loving goodness for all Thy benefits which Thou hast poured so abundantly upon me, Thy servant. I fall down in adoration before Thee and offer Thee, O God, my praises. With fervor I cry to Thee: O God, deliver me henceforth from all adversities and mercifully fulfill in me such of my desires as may be expedient for me. Hear me, I entreat Thee, and have mercy, for Thou art the Hope of all the ends of the earth, and unto Thee, with the Father, and the Holy Spirit, be ascribed glory, now and ever, and unto ages of ages. Amen.

      I've been listening to a lot of bluegrass lately. Is it due to the fact that I live alone at the base of a mountain in western mass? Could be...  anyway, i think it's great. Louvin Brothers, Bill Monroe, and newer stuff like The Mammals. Also, NPR plays some great bluegrass and folk on occasion. Does that make me a hick as a friend of mine claims? Proabably.   Just read this review and tell me we're not dealing with quality stuff here! ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   http://www.popmatters.com/music/reviews/l/louvinbrothers-satan.shtml  If gospel bluegrass can fathom its own Velvet Underground, then here they are: Ira and Charlie Louvin, a.k.a. The Louvin Brothers. Their comprehension of the tortured throes of a drunkard's Satan-infested soul are no less profound than Lou Reed's own understanding of a heroin junkie wrestling with a world devoid of meaning beyond the piercing tip of the needle. (Ironically enough, the title track to this album was featured in the soundtrack to the film Jesus' Son, the title of which was taken from a Velvet Underground song.) Yet the comparison cuts a bit deeper. It is the ability to musically express this understanding that is the sign of true artistry. The brothers Louvin and the Velvet Underground share a bare-bones approach to songwriting where relatively simple chords are combined with a brutally honest lyrical approach. It is the guitar in "Waiting For My Man" which allows the listener to share in the urgency of the junkie who knows "you always gotta wait". And so it is with the melody in the Louvin's "River of Jordan" that we feel the "cool waters that quench [our] souls".  Ira Louvin's own struggles with the bottle and fiery death in a car accident allow him the same inherent knowledge of one in league with one's own personal devil that Lou Reed surely gained in his experiences with heroin. The brothers speak with the authority and assurance of those who have felt the hand of God and are left with no real choice but to preach it to the masses. "It's sweet to know that God is real . . . but, sinner friend, Satan is real too, and hell is a real place". Harsh words, but the Louvins are the salt in the wounds of the faithless and they merely sing it the way they see it. Ultimately, the choice to stay adrift in the cold with the kneeling drunkard, or to come into the country church, where the harsh outside is reduced to a cool breeze blowing through an open window, is left to the listener.  Yet the departure from the Velvet Underground, of course, is profound as well. The existentialism of those adrift in Lou Reed's seedy societal underbelly is perhaps their only redemption. The Louvins people their music with similar troubled characters: the kneeling drunkard, the father who gambles. But for the Louvins, there are concrete solutions. The soul can be washed in Jordan's river of its sins and offered for grace from the Higher Power. The song "Higher Power" has an infectious flow to it reminiscent of an old time revival meeting. It is perhaps one of white America's finer plunges into the depths of the musical spirituality that has been rooted in the African-American church since the dawning of its history in slavery times.  The modern listener is perhaps skeptical to listen to an album so rooted in its faith. Perhaps the burning plywood cut-out of a buck-toothed devil that graces the cover is a deterrent to a mind so rooted in rational estimations of worth. But that is a symptom of the close-mindedness that is a part of our contemporary, more urban world. The depth is there in Satan is Real. This album transcends the immediate kitsch appeal of its cover. There is a reason why songs from this album have been performed by the more commonly accepted genius of artists such as Gram Parsons, Johnny Cash, and Emmylou Harris.  Lacking John Milton's human sympathy towards Satan, the Louvins trace all of the evils in the world to his door. They even enlist support in their musical ass-kicking of old Saint Nick with their cover of the Carter Family's "The Kneeling Drunkard's Plea".  The Louvins have no fear plunging into the metaphysical undercurrents that control the sensible world. "Are you afraid? Are you unsaved? Are you afraid to die?" they cry as they set out on the long road to personal salvation, unwilling to wait for skeptics. The music they have left us with, though simple in its banjo and guitar construction, is powerful enough to conjure the flaming tongues of hell that will lick those who fall by the wayside.

      Ah...going back to work after a good 2 week break. The perks of working at a high school where the kiddies are given near college length vacations.  As an added bonus, one of the kids a worked with (an 18 year old repeat junion) just withdrew, lightening my work load more than one can imagine.  I'm sure I'll be given 2 or 3 more students to take his place. Good times.

       Yet once more, O ye laurels, and once more Ye myrtles brown, with ivy never sere, I come to pluck your berries harsh and crude, And with forced fingers rude Shatter your leaves before the mellowing year. Bitter constraint and sad occasion dear Compels me to disturb your season due; For Lycidas is dead, dead ere his prime, Young Lycidas, and hath not left his peer. Who would not sing for Lycidas? He knew Himself to sing, and build the lofty rhyme. He must not float upon his watery bier Unwept, and welter to the parching wind, Without the meed of some melodious tear.  -Milton, from Lycidas

      My first evening in Prague was spent in the  urlLink Smetana Concert Hall  listening to Mozart's  Requiem . What a beautiful piece of music- quite otherworldly  and moving from start to finish. That first night kind of set the mood for the next two days of my trip as I wandered around Prague with the Requiem still in my head staring up at old gothic cathedrals. Unfortunately, the Czech Republic is now about 40% atheist...horrible what years of communism can do.    Dies irae, dies illa Solvet saeclum in favilla, Teste David cum Sibylla.  Quantus tremor est futurus Quando judex est venturus Cuncta stricte discussurus.     Day of wrath, that day Will dissolve the earth in ashes As David and the Sibyl bear witness.  What dread there will be When the Judge shall come To judge all things strictly.

       There is nothing heavier than compassion. Not even one's own pain weighs so heavy as the pain one feels for someone, for someone, pain intensified by the imagination and prolonged by a hundred echos.   Milan Kundera

      Off to Prague tomorrow morning and will be gone for a little over a week. I've never traveled alone so I'm not sure what to expect. Hopefully the trip will give me some time to sort out some life questions that have been eating at me...   Well, if you're reading this, pray that I'll have a fruitful and clarifying trip...and that I won't get mugged or beaten... thanks.

      Created a new layout for the site. Unfortunately, all past comments were deleted.  If anyone would like to comment on a comment made yesterday, I'd be appreciative.   Oh, the mystery!   Let me know what you think of the new layout. I know it's nothing spectacular, but I think it's slightly easier on the eyes.

        FAITH    Lately I've been questioning the motivation behind my beliefs. I know for certain this questioning will not lead to a complete overhaul of what I know and understand to be true but, God willing, it will lead to a deeper knowledge and understanding of who I am, and what my motivations are- particularly in the "religious" sense.  The other night trying to fall asleep I found myself restless....kept awake by the idea that I'm a cheater, that I'm insincere, that my attempt at a spiritual life is being kept alive by nothing more than self-motivation and ego.  I began to ask myself - "Why do I make attempts to worship God in the Orthodox Church?"  Is it the need to feel superior to the "other half" who live without the Church. Is it a feeling of belonging which drives me? Is it a psychological need, possibly stemming from  my personal experiences, which has led me to attempt feebly to approach God?Is it a desire for some kind of mystical experience which will deliver me from the monotony of day to day life?  Is it the fear of death and final judgement? Do I only call on God in times of need- reducing God to a wish-giver of sorts? Is my religion a  crutch ?  If these things are true... then my Christianity is fake- it is a thin and cheap facade only existing to satisfy myself, not God.  If this is true, then perhaps the critics of "organized religion" are correct, at least about me and my ego driven self-satisfying motivations.  My former priest used to say frequently:  "We must become less, so that He may become more."   Is my Christianity an emptying of the self, or is it pleasing to the self in its comforting concepts, its ritual, its talk of Church life which foster feelings of self-importance.   God preserve me from the superficial, so that I may worship  in  Truth  and in self emptying  Love .

      Ah, and now something for April. A bit of T.S. Eliot's  The Wasteland    April is the cruelest month, breeding 	Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing 	Memory and desire, stirring 	Dull roots with spring rain. 	Winter kept us warm, covering 	Earth in forgetful snow, feeding 	A little life with dried tubers. 	Summer surprised us, coming over the Starnbergersee 	With a shower of rain; we stopped in the colonnade 10 	And went on in sunlight, into the Hofgarten, 	And drank coffee, and talked for an hour. 	Bin gar keine Russin, stamm' aus Litauen, echt deutsch. 	And when we were children, staying at the arch-duke's, 	My cousin's, he took me out on a sled, 	And I was frightened. He said, Marie, 	Marie, hold on tight. And down we went. 	In the mountains, there you feel free. 	I read, much of the night, and go south in winter.

      The new  urlLink Bonnie Prince Billy  album is out. It's not really new, as it's re-recorded and spruced up versions of some of  urlLink Will Oldham's  songs from his early days...back when he had a bit more indie rock and a little less country in his style. Will Oldham has been called by some the best American songwriter of the past 10 years... I say they're right. I've been listening to his music for the past 7 years and still it hasn't gotten old for me.   Anyway, I recommend  urlLink this interview  for those interested in finding out something more about him. Also, check out my Will Oldham link to the right.

      Tomorrow is  urlLink Lazarus Saturday .  Here is Sonia in Dostoevsky's  Crime and Punishment    reading  The Raising of Lazarus  to Raskolnikov- one of my favorite selections from all of Dostoevsky's writings.   Sonia still hesitated. Her heart was throbbing. She hardly dared to read to him. He looked almost with exasperation at the "unhappy lunatic."  "What for? You don't believe? . . ." she whispered softly and as it were breathlessly.  "Read! I want you to," he persisted. "You used to read to Lizaveta."  Sonia opened the book and found the place. Her hands were shaking, her voice failed her. Twice she tried to begin and could not bring out the first syllable.  "Now a certain man was sick named Lazarus of Bethany . . ." she forced herself at last to read, but at the third word her voice broke like an overstrained string. There was a catch in her breath.  Raskolnikov saw in part why Sonia could not bring herself to read to him and the more he saw this, the more roughly and irritably he insisted on her doing so. He understood only too well how painful it was for her to betray and unveil all that was her /own/. He understood that these feelings really were her /secret treasure/, which she had kept perhaps for years, perhaps from childhood, while she lived with an unhappy father and a distracted stepmother crazed by grief, in the midst of starving children and unseemly abuse and reproaches. But at the same time he knew now and knew for certain that, although it filled her with dread and suffering, yet she had a tormenting desire to read and to read to /him/ that he might hear it, and to read /now/ whatever might come of it! . . . He read this in her eyes, he could see it in her intense emotion. She mastered herself, controlled the spasm in her throat and went on reading the eleventh chapter of St. John. She went on to the nineteenth verse:  "And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary to comfort them concerning their brother.  "Then Martha as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming went and met Him: but Mary sat still in the house.  "Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if Thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.  "But I know that even now whatsoever Thou wilt ask of God, God will give it Thee. . . ."  Then she stopped again with a shamefaced feeling that her voice would quiver and break again.  "Jesus said unto her, thy brother shall rise again.  "Martha saith unto Him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection, at the last day.  "Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection and the life: he that believeth in Me though he were dead, yet shall he live.  "And whosoever liveth and believeth in Me shall never die. Believest thou this?  "She saith unto Him,"  (And drawing a painful breath, Sonia read distinctly and forcibly as though she were making a public confession of faith.)  "Yea, Lord: I believe that Thou art the Christ, the Son of God Which should come into the world."  She stopped and looked up quickly at him, but controlling herself went on reading. Raskolnikov sat without moving, his elbows on the table and his eyes turned away. She read to the thirty-second verse.  "Then when Mary was come where Jesus was and saw Him, she fell down at His feet, saying unto Him, Lord if Thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.  "When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping which came with her, He groaned in the spirit and was troubled,  "And said, Where have ye laid him? They said unto Him, Lord, come and see.  "Jesus wept.  "Then said the Jews, behold how He loved him!  "And some of them said, could not this Man which opened the eyes of the blind, have caused that even this man should not have died?"  Raskolnikov turned and looked at her with emotion. Yes, he had known it! She was trembling in a real physical fever. He had expected it. She was getting near the story of the greatest miracle and a feeling of immense triumph came over her. Her voice rang out like a bell; triumph and joy gave it power. The lines danced before her eyes, but she knew what she was reading by heart. At the last verse "Could not this Man which opened the eyes of the blind . . ." dropping her voice she passionately reproduced the doubt, the reproach and censure of the blind disbelieving Jews, who in another moment would fall at His feet as though struck by thunder, sobbing and believing. . . . "And /he, he/--too, is blinded and unbelieving, he, too, will hear, he, too, will believe, yes, yes! At once, now," was what she was dreaming, and she was quivering with happy anticipation.  "Jesus therefore again groaning in Himself cometh to the grave. It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it.  "Jesus said, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith unto Him, Lord by this time he stinketh: for he hath been dead four days."  She laid emphasis on the word /four/.  "Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee that if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?  "Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up His eyes and said, Father, I thank Thee that Thou hast heard Me.  "And I knew that Thou hearest Me always; but because of the people which stand by I said it, that they may believe that Thou hast sent Me.  "And when He thus had spoken, He cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth.  "And he that was dead came forth."  (She read loudly, cold and trembling with ecstasy, as though she were seeing it before her eyes.)  "Bound hand and foot with graveclothes; and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, Loose him and let him go.  "Then many of the Jews which came to Mary and had seen the things which Jesus did believed on Him."  She could read no more, closed the book and got up from her chair quickly.

       David Lynch? What's happening to me?   I've been on a  urlLink David Lynch  kick. I can't stop watching his movies. Over the past week I've watched  Blue Velvet, Twin Peaks-Fire Walk With Me, Lost Highway, and Mulholland Drive . I'm either slightly more insane since this movie watching adventure began, or a little bit better because of it. I never thought I'd get into his films. My first two years of college were spent at a liberal-hippy-commie-artsy-school where "being into" Lynch was hip, so out of spite I only watched one of his films and didn't pay much attention. Living in the woods and having oodles of free time and no one to be cooler than has given me the opportunity to really appreciate what he does. Worth checking out!

       The War, Iraq, Bush, etc.   Quick rant: Though I would not describe myself as a "liberal" and in no way subscribe to the "liberal agenda" in America, I have to say that I find the current occupation of Iraq and the actions of our president to be disgraceful and thoroughy dishonest. To many, I'm just pointing out the obvious, but this is my rant so I can be as obvious as I want. More obvious facts:   -The greatest success of our president has been in making a connection between the events of 9/11 and the former Iraqi government, a connection which does not exist.   -Stemming from this lie was the lie that WMDs are in Iraq and are an imminent threat to world stability. Based on this second lie, a justification for invading Iraq was manufactured and sold to the American people.  - The American people, incidentally, have the memory capacity of goldfish...as a majority of Americans continue to support this war even though the two lies which provided the only justification for war have been exposed.  -Between 8 and 10 thousand innocent lives have been lost in Iraq as a result of our invasion. About 3 times as many as were lost in the 9/11 attacks. Innocent life is innocent life, no matter how you slice it. It's all valuable. So, based on two lies and a vague notion of "justice" we were sold a plan of action which resulted in more innocent bloodshed than the attack which prompted any US action. Despite this, nothing has been accomplished to bring real justice for the 3,000 victims of 9/11. Instead, we're hated even more by the world which will only result in more attacks.  -What the hell are we doing supporting the Zionists in Israel? That's half our problem, but that's obvious.  - We have become an Empire, straying far from the original concept of Republic. Get out your 10th grade history books....now....what happens to all Empires?  - Following Septemeber 11th we had the  urlLink support of the whole  world. For the first time in decades people sympathized with the United States. Bush took that sympathy, possibly our last chance at building solid relations with the world community, and destroyed it. Within two years, we have become more hated than at any other time in history.   - We need a new president, but Kerry is nothing more than Bush"light", and a third party candidate will not be elected. Some may argue that Bush is pro-life, pro-religion, etc. These are all good things. I say this is should be a secondary consideration at this point in choosing a president. The fate of our nation is in the balance at this point. The hatred around the globe that is felt for us must be our primary concern. We've gotta fix that...quick. Besides, Bush will never push to overturn Roe V. Wade, as it would damage his career too much.   My thoughts.
