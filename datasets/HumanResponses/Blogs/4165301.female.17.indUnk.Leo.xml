       Hey there, i know its a friday night and its 7:30 pm.    But i'm in SUCH a thinking mood that i need to write. The last couple days for me, actually this whole summer really have been kinda hard. I have my ups and downs with friends and family and even my boyfriend, but i somehow always manage to get my way through it all. Its funny really, how much one person can take before they just explode. I try hard to not blame it on everyone and get stressed out and over-worked...but you know things happen. I have been super lucky in my past and present to have been blessed with such great friends. It's a part of me i guess, friends come first. Haha i could quote 'pac here, " you aint shit without ur homeboys" yeah you've got that right, thats for sure. I am the person i am and im not gonna change for anyone. I wana keep me for me and not let anyone get in between that. Not saying i dont have faults or anything, cuz beeeeeeelieve dat i do. I have many, more than most people. I guess theres just a part of us that wants to let loose some of the time...even if we can't.  Any advice for today...nope, stay the same person you are...follow your own advice. Consider other peoples when they give it to you...but stick to your own...anyways i'm outta here (L)

       I think birthdays are overrated. I mean you wait 364 days a year for one day. And then when it comes its like k, watever. Oh man. Thats annoying. Its not about presents or even the cake...(okay well maybe some of it is the cake...) but its the family recognizing that you have turned another year older and this year in my case it's 17. Woo! But guess wat, guess how many phone calls i got yesterday,  from the family i mean. My grandparents and many aunts and uncles. None. Not one. NOt like i expected it or antyhign but you know...its kinda sad when you dont get any recognition. BUT!!!! There is the others who are MOST important to me! My parents and Chase, and Aunt Carrie and Grandpa! But those arent the bestest. They have to like me...the bestest are my friends. And brax of course! I love everyone who spoils me. THey do way too much. They are all amazing, and i just wanted to say that :)

Amanda and I have our Subway days at LEAST once a week...ahaha okay maybe twice! haha my drinking partner, my soulmate...my bestest. I've never met someone so cool in my life. She makes me laugh and also like J makes me cry. We never fight...its just not us. And if we had ever fought...we would have gotten through it. I love her with all my heart and i cant wait for grade 12!! Oh and uhh sorry about the jokes...i know their stupid...but what can i say? ;)...blaze? ONE DAY!

       Crazy how it feels isn't it?  So many feelings, the strongest of sort I might add...but really no words could amount to them. I wonder why that is? I'm sure many people can relate, and for the some that can't, it's an amazing feeling that you just want to hold onto for the rest of your life. Yes I know, boyfriends and girlfriends come and go...but when you find that one person, the one you want to spend the rest of your life with. That's a miracle. But the feelings, why is it that Love cannot be expressed into words? Is it because "when you fall in love you should be speechless, cuz no words can express true love?" Or because you have so many wonderful thoughts going through your head that you can't imagine even trying to talk because it would be mentally impossible to say every single word that you want to say? I don't exactly know why Love can't be verbally expressed. I guess it's just one of those things that you know deep in your heart. Advice...don't take Love for granted, say as much as you can...because if you dont...in the end you'll regret it.

      When was the last time you saw a snail, bent down and picked him up from the grass? I did yesterday, and i stood there holding a snail, feeling most like an idiot i said hello to him. He of course didn't talk back to me, that would have been too cool for words. Instead he bobbed his head a bit and slithered around in my hand. You have to feel for these guys, i mean...all they do is squish around on the ground and when they sense danger they curl up into their shell. They are harmless!! and really cute...so why does everyone like stepping on them?  I was just wondering...
