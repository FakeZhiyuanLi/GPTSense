      Another day that will probably go down as being wasted, went and looked up shiny rocks for zak, not sure what will come of that, gettin ready for the wedding this weekend and trying to figure out what the heck I am gonna do about an apartment next month.  This town is too freakin expensive.  But at least I get my daily call from the annoying client who just can't take a hint.

      Black Mage is my Idol Flight Sim 2002 is 19.99 at best buy, seriously its just like flying a plane, I dont know why the terrorists bothered taking lessons. Hurricanes Blow, Tornadoes Suck City of Heroes is a GREAT way to waste time. So is Doom 3 Doom 3 STILL nearly requires adult diapers to play By week 6 of this football season, according to Madden Miami is 6-0, Ricky Williams has 15 TDs, David Boston has another 7 and 800 yards receiving.

      I made it through the Hurricane.  Didn't actually have too much excitement out where I was.  We lost power for about 12 hours, and have had intermittent blackouts since then.  But at least its all over now and we can get on with helping other rebui... wait... whats that on the weather chart  SUNUVA  Yes ladies and gents, the great joker in the sky has decided on a two for one sale, not on pepsi or any of the MILLION things on my brothers wedding registry, but on natural freaking disasters.  This one is currently heading towards the Yucatan but I really doubt we will be that lucky.  Not that I would wish a hurricane on anyone, but another one right now could get REAL bad, all the shelters and temporary housing up, all the homeless people trying to get out, yeah not good.  But the only thing we can do is get as much done while we can and hope that it dies out or hits some uninhabited spot.  My thoughts and prayers are with everyone who has lost in this disaster.

      She finally got me the address of one of my fraternity brothers, who is a Marine serving in Iraq.  Every day I get a chill like ice running down my spine when I hear about Marines getting killed.  My thoughts and prayers go out to everyone who has lost a friend or loved one in this war.  I know that, misguided as our leadership might be the men and women in uniform are doing a good thing.  If there is the slightest possibility of bringing the freedom that we enjoy to another country, one which does suffer then we should do it.  This is not to say we should invade anyone we dont like, but an unjust nation, like Iraq, or Iran, where the leader holds power by fear of force rather than the consent of the governed should be offered all the help we can muster.  On a lighter note, WHAT THE HELL ELSE CAN HAPPEN TO MY DOLPHINS (note: God this is a rhetorical question, PLEASE DO NOT ANSWER!)

      So I'm going to watchIaido tonight.  So let me tell you a little about my arts  Kendo is the art of Japanese Fencing. Its a lot more spiritual the western fencing, and the equipment is very distinctive, definately not the kind of stuff you bring through airport security. The goal of the matches is to score a hit on the head (men) body (do) wrist (kote) or to score on a thrust to the throat (tsuki) while I've never participated in a match, being a relative newbie it seems that men and kote are very common, do rather less so and tsuki is usually the result of someone just totally screwing up.  Iaido is the art of drawing the sword. It teaches you how to use a sword against one or more opponents through a series of forms. It isn't a self-defense technique but rather one of self-discovery through a sword art.  If you live in South West Florida and want more info check out www.bushi-kan.com or email me (but I'll probably just send you to the website unless its something real easy)  Other news: Ran into an old buddy at Best Buy, then another one, CSN day I guess.  All in good fun.  Thats all I can think of now, I'm all alone at the office... I'll do my indexing, maybe take a nap (j/k) then do some filing.  Cheers!

      Anyone want a boxer?  She's cute, housetrained, doesn't eat much, and runs like a freaking deer.  She got loose this morning and ran over 2 miles away, I had to drag her back by her collar (getting later to work every minute) which took a total of almost 3 HOURS of running, stalking or dragging.  All of this in the Golden Ghetto, a great neighboorhood to be running around in the back yards.   So yeah if you want one shes yours.   I'm thinking of going to Iaido tomorrow.  Just watching, seeing if I want to go to the all-day deal on saturday.  Any opinions?  And to the people who have commented on me, you rock!  Although the one of love was kinda irrational.  But thats ok!  (I work for a divorce attorney, we treat love like the iceberg treated the titanic)  Back to (allegedly) working!

      I am going to try to post a few random thoughts I have had over the last week every sunday.  Hopefully I'll do this at least twice in a row so I can call it a tradition.  Nothing says love like a Restraining order on Valentines Day Bush is a Moron, there I said it, and I feel better for saying it Vote Zelman/Rios in 2016, because America shouldn't have to settle for the lesser of two evils Suburi flat out hurts the next day Foamy is the true Lord and Master.

      Nothing gets done on Friday  I started 4 or 5 tasks and worked on 2 of my ongoing projects... and NOTHING got done, just built a breastworks on my desk big enough to protect me from atomic weapons (or anything Bush can think of to do to me, even if he continues to come up with new ideas)  So I get out of "work"and watch a movie... because I can  What did I watch  FIGHT CLUB  Mischief.... Mayhem... Soap  this movie speaks directly to nearly every man in my generation.  Even if you arent a total psycho (I suppose I am not quite that out of it yet).  But the whole message of  Not everyone can be an astronaut or a movie star, or the all singing all dancing crap of the world.  Once you accept that you will fail, on occasion, success becomes a lot more possible to achieve.  So many of my friends dont accept the possibility of failure, even after one of us (including me) falls flat on our faces.   Tomorrow I get a woman who we shall call the lusty busty blonde over.   Watching movies and drinking, she's one of the people I could be on a desert island naked with and not really have any weird tension.  We understand each other, shes very attractive, we just managed to hit that point on the ladder ( urlLink www.intellectualwhores.com ) where our desire to be friends (even mine) overrides our desire to throw down in a wild sex fest (not that I'd complain TOO much)  and its an excuse to watch Last Samurai.  Kind of an action oriented Dances with Wolves with fewer ugly people.  Everyone likes swords.  Dan out

      Amazing what 6 hours of sleep can do for you.  Not only have I woken up much less tired and sore, but almost immediately found out that my president is trying to kill me.  If he does as well as he has with OBL I am worried that I will die comfortably in my bed of natural causes at 82.   Actually the prez was about _____   Another day of work, another McDs breakfast, its a miracle I'm not 500 pounds.  Oh well, I get to have lunch with a hot blonde today.  She isn't interested in me but I can just be in denial on that to feel better about myself.

      Every once in a while I play fireman at work.  That means I dont get a single thing I want to get done done, but I sure am in a rush and I sure do produce a lot of paperwork.   Today was one of those days, I didnt do a thing I wanted to, but my "To Be Filed" stack could be a fire hazard and the crumpled up garbage behind me definately is.  But I get to knock out of here early to pick up my sisters car from the shop.  SCORE.  Kendo tonight, the real reason I have the focus of a hummingbird on amphetamines.

      So I've finally given into temptation and started a blog.  First a bit about me, I work for an attorney in SW Florida, I grew up here, went to college and came back in more or less total defeat.  Since then I've been trying to put my life in something that at least looks like order.  I'm 23, a student at just about everything and have managed to go to 5 years of college without a degree (and will start year 6 in the spring!).  Currently working on a Business degree, kendo, and a pilots license.   Naples is not a good town to do this unless your bank accounts end with 7 zeroes.  But I've got a lot of friends here and have been staying active, trying to move my life forward (or in any direction really, its easy to just stall out in Florida).  Today I will work until 5, finishing at least one project, probably two, and most likely spend the last hour shredding old documents while trying to convince my boss that its a bad idea for an attorney to have a computer on a wireless network.  At least the sensitive stuff has some extra security.  After work I will go back to my bros place (where I am staying until moving into an apartment) and get ready for Kendo.  If you guys are real lucky I will figure out how to get photos of my gear and set that up.  My boss is actually pretty cool, she tells you what to do, lets you decide how to do it, doesnt' complain if you have "one of those days" as long as you dont make a habit of it, actually apologizes when she makes a mistake that you have to clean up, and even her bad days are really mild.   Ok all that aside I should at least PRETEND to work she's cool, but she's not stupid.  Other websites open  urlLink www.illwillpress.com  - FOAMY  urlLink www.pvponline.com  - Player Vs. Player (GET BACK TO THE STORYLINE)
