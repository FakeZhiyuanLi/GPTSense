						   All I need is a little Jazz to get me thinking.  Today went to the music store around 6 in the afternoon to buy some more music to choreograph to. I bought Soulive and Jamiroquai. Man, is just something about really good soul music that gets me thinking.  It is really big decision time in my life right now. I can either 1. Head to NY to study at the Atlantic Conservatory or 2. Stay here and continue to focus on my theatre project.  Its such a double edged circumstance. If I go, then I embark on that all too unstable starving artist life (which is something I actually would enjoy). If I stay and work on my theatre project thing there is the big chance of my regreting not going. I just wish that I had one of thost Eight Ball question things...only this one would actually work. Then I wouldn't have to bother with whether or not I am making the right decision or not.  What I do know is that I have to make a decision soon. Honestly, it all depends on how well my one-man show goes later this month. I am getting more excited about it as time gets closer.  I just need to continue to pray and stay focused.

						   Well, Today's friday.  Today I am going to have to rethink the choreography for the workshop because I won't be able to use any of the dancers from OHS. Which I'm sure is a blessing in disguise. I got stuck with the choreography yesterday. Usually this happens, when I can't think of a good next step. But, I will spend most of the day today working on it.  I spoke with the Zach and found out that he was actually pretty upset with the fact that was giving his role in my play away. He, from what he said, had been reading it every night. I'm glad I gave the role back to him. I think he really needs theatre. I saw something in him that I haven't seen before.   When I got to his house he and Lindsey were cleaning up. I think they are a good couple. But, you sure as hell wouldn't be able to tell just by watching them. They are constantly bickering with each other about simple things. But despite that, I see something that I haven't had in a long time; they are comfortable together. Now, I know that we are still young (22,23), but everyone needs the loving touch of another person. Most of the people who seriously deny this usually end up becoming serial killers or something . Its natural. You cant deny it. When you find a person that fits you...it makes you feel great. I think though, that Zach and Lindsey have some things missing in their relationship. They both have that old high school mentality with each other. But, there is something that can HIT two people that brings them to a brand new level. I can't put a name to it because it has no name. But its that one thing that I have always dreamed about.   You see, for a very long time I have been some what of a romantic. Ok, Ok, I'm a freaking hush puppy, but that's not the point!!! The point is, since I was a child, god has given me this vision about this woman that he is going to send to me. I'm talking about a special woman that he has molded expecially for me. Now, just imagine, woman in general are absolutely amazing to me. But, this one is going to be twice that. Man, I get nervous even thinking about it! The problem is, a guy like me, I go out all the time thinking that if I keep my eyes open and scope out every woman that crosses my path, just maybe, I might be able to find her for myself. But, that's not the way it's going to happen. The truth, well, I think that's why god has given me all of my talents. He wants me to come to the realization that the only thing that I need to do is focus on those talents and grow as a man. That's also, why he hasn't sent me a relationship that has worked out. I mean, I'm only 23, but I have had plenty of relationships. I was even engaged at one time. However, in all of those relationships I knew before even half way in that it wouldn't work out. Even the, what I call, Great Exploration relationship with Allison. I met her in High School and talk to her still today. Honestly, everytime I hear her voice on the phone it makes me happy. I truly still have love for her. But, I have come to the point where not matter what happens I would never committ to her again just because I know it doesn't compare to what I deserve. Talking to her is too complicated. That's not the way its suppose to be. My parents for instance, they have been married over 25 years and they truly love each other. But I don't think that they have discovered what I know is out there. Yeah, it may sound like I'm talking about that romantic mumbo jumbo you find in most love stories. But, I see it like this. How is it possible for someone to think it up if it can't happen for real. This isn't sci-fi futuristic space machinery I'm talkin about, this is people!!! And I believe in it all the way!!! It exists and I'm going to prove it. I know that God is going to use me to prove to the people around me what true love is meant to be. And, I accept the challenge...  what?  oh excuse me guys...  I think Allison is calling!!! :)

						   Well, I'm up.  Now I just need to kick into gear. I could either get dressed and head to the arts center to work on some choreography or I can stay here and work on the curriculum. I'm thinking I'll just stay here for now.  Yesterday I met with the local High School's dance team to see if they would like to dance with me in the workshop.  I had forgotten how irritating high school kids could be. For the most part the dancers had a good attitude. I only saw a couple I might have a problem with. But, maybe they wont show up for the first rehearsal. I hope that I am able to get them out of school to participate. That is going to be one hell of a road block.  I think about what I would be doing if I stayed in Pensacola. I would've really like to continue to work with the Dance Company, but this move is just something that I have to do.  I think my one-man show will do fine here in Auburn. I thought of some really nice lighting ideas for the three shows. I really think the atmosphere is going to be the most important. That will be the key. Even if many people don't show I have to make those that do show feel that they are a part of something special.
