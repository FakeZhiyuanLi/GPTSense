       Today was was teh fun... We (As in Alfred, Jeff, and I) went to Munjal's house for a few mintues after Jeff was being a fscking dick and not giving the proper diredctions and making my Grandma CraZy... We stayed there for like five mintues then we all piled into Munjal's Mom's minivan. Alfred and I were talking in teh back and Jeff kept tell us to shut up... but i didn't see teh reason:). We arrived at our destination (which was teh Computer Fair)  at about 11:30. There was a Cheerleading Compitition going on or something because there was ALOT of Cheerleaders(about 500-600). Munjal and Jeff got lucky and didn't have to pay the $8 entrance fee but me and Alfred weren't so lucky. Once we got in the fair we walked around the booths and noticed there was a Adult Section, we were tempted to go in (no one was looks and i think no one cared either... What a country!!!) We walked around somemore.About 12:00 i made my first purchase, which was a 450 watt power supply(Which is a vast improvment over my old 300 watt power supply). After about 15mintues of more walking and mulling around we went to the other building (hehehe). I kept telling Alfred not to mess with the Asains because you never know if they know Karate or some other Marital Arts to kick your ass with. Then Alfred thought of asking all the salepeople if all the prices were in American Currency, it was funny for a while then it got kinda old (but funny nonetheless). I found a table where they were selling Tri-flame lighters, I was pondering whether or not just to take it and walk away but i deicided to be a good kid and pay for it (besides it was cheap any ways,$3!!!!). So me and Alfred walked outside because Munjal and Jeff went to find a Dual-layer DVD burner. Then me and Alfred went to the table were the lighters were and bought Alfred one. On the way back from that raunting trip i found a wire-less keyboard and mouse for $30 but i only had $22, so Alfred was a good friend and spotted me $8 :). After the Computer Fair we came to my house. my Grandma ordered pizza and then we had the bright idea to go to Seven-Eleven which is about 1/4 mile away from my house up a very very slight incline over a stretch of road about 1000 feet it might be yards i don't know...When we came back i took  a picture for his fake Canadian school ID. Then jeff called his Parental Units and had to go home,Alfred went with him:(.....Now im alone talking to you gay peoples... Im outta here, Later......
