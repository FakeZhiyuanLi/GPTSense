      Why is it that when you finally find exactly what you are looking for..that you have to say goodbye practically as soon as you've said hello?   Goodbyes BITE.

      The road trip is officially over. :( And what a road trip it was! But, details will come later, as I'm absolutely pooped and want to go to bed!    Crap, I gotta go back to work tomorrow...

       urlLink Have you seen this?   A fellow Beatles fan told me about it today, and told me to Google it. I did, and read a lot of the stuff, and it really creeped me out. I can't believe that I had never heard this stuff before!  Hey, I saw Paul in concert about two years ago. No way is that am imposter! It's amazing how these crazy ideas get started.

      I had to make myself take a nap today. There was so much for me to do today, and I just had all this energy suddenly, and just couldn't stop going! Finally, at about 2:30, I stopped and rested, and slept for about an hour and a half. I know that in a few hours I'm going to be zombified again! Guess I'll sleep in the car tomorrow!  I took my friends out to dinner tonight, in honor of their 2 year anniversary, which is tomorrow. We had a great night! A very nice dinner (yes, I went off my diet to enjoy it, but I wasn't  too  bad.) The next three days will be the hardest, since I won't be at home. Eating on the go is never a good thing.  Wow, three whole days! This is going to be fun!

I won't try to explain the origins of it, but she and I have this princess thing going. Today's box brought me some awesome princess flip-flops (which I plan to take on my road trip!), a deck of princess playing cards (strip princess poker, anyone?), a royal writing implement (otherwise known as a pen), a princess membership card (I'm official!), a cute picture of a royal frog, that she colored all on her own (if I kiss it will it turn into a prince?), and some queen lip balm!!!  Thank you my little Princess friend, you have made my day!!!!

      Yep, that's right. This time tomorrow, yours truly will be on a road trip! Too bad it isn't somewhere better than Phoenix. But three days away from San Diego, from work, from my mother, from everything, and three days hanging out with two of the best people in my life is gonna be GREAT!!!  :)  I'll be back sometime on Thursday...I hope I have a story or two to share when I return!    P.S. Still haven't been to sleep yet...

      Oh my goodness...I am so sleepy, and I won't be able to sleep for a few more hours. Lucky me, after working my 10 p.m. to 7 a.m. shift, I have to go to a doctor's appointment at 9:30. THEN I can sleep.  I wanted to cancel it, but because I've already had to reschedule it twice, and since I've had *this* appointment for a month already, I'd hate to put it off.   Man, I am taking a looonnng nap when I get home!

      Yes, life is still good. And if it's possible, it's even better today. :)  There is so much going on in my head right now, so much for me to be happy about...but my blog is definitely not the place for me to get too personal!! There are some things a girl has to keep to herself!!! :)  My friend emailed me earlier, and she told me she was watching some late night TV and saw penguins having sex. Hmm....penguin porn? Have we come to that as a society?   LOL  Currently, it is 11:33 p.m. and I am at work. I'll be here until 7 a.m. I will also be here at this time tomorrow, Sunday, and Monday. Filling in for someone else. I kinda enjoy it, as it's really quiet here, and I can do my own thing (like write in my blog) and get paid while I'm doing it!! I know around 2 or 3 a.m. I'll really be missing the sleep...

      Yes, today was a good day!   Last summer, a guy I dated like a couple of times a few years back got in touch with me. We chatted some for a while, and then I had sent a few emails and a few PMs and didn't hear back, so I&nbsp;just gave up.  Well, he finally got ahold of me this past week and we chatted online and on the phone. He's married now, and wanted to see me and have me meet his wife.   Today, I ended up going over to their place after work. I had such fun! It's been a long time since I've just hung out with people near my own age.&nbsp; I thought it would be kind of awkward hanging out with a guy I kinda dated and his  wife  but it was actually fine! We hit it off famously! I really like her. She and I are so much alike we could have been separated at birth, LOL.&nbsp; I love making a new friend, and hitting it off like that.  The three of us are getting together tomorrow night, and I'm really looking forward to it.

      Tomorrow is the  other  ex's birthday. (The most recent ex.) So on top of all the other crappy feelings I am feeling,&nbsp;I have to think about HIM too. *sigh*

      I was going through some old emails I had saved, and found one from a guy I knew briefly a couple of years ago or so. A new job had moved him up north, and we lost contact. I decided to email him today, for some reason, only to have the message returned. The email address was no longer valid. Kinda bummed me out, as he was a really nice guy, and I wish I hadn't lost touch with him. Anyway, for some strange reason, I decided to Google him.  Well.  Imagine my surprise when Google found him. Or maybe I should say, found him and his wife. My search brought up a link to a photographer's website that had pictures from his recent wedding. May 1 of this year to be exact. One week before my 33rd birthday. I guess I should be happy it wasn't  on  my birthday...that really would have bummed me out, even more so than I already am. Seeing the pictures made me wonder what may have been if I had stayed in contact with him, you know? All the men I used to date, or just plain  used  (you know the ones, the sex buddies) are all off the market, either legally (married) or just  really  attached. Some even have kids.  &nbsp;  I never pictured my life this way - being single at 33.&nbsp; All I ever wanted was to be married. And be a mom. Maybe that sounds old fashioned, but that's the way it is. I just wanted to be a wife.&nbsp; Have someone to fall asleep next to, and wake up with. Someone who would take care of me, and I could take care of.&nbsp; Why isn't that in the cards for  me ? What's wrong with me?&nbsp; Seeing those pictures of this guy getting married really upset me. When is it   my   turn? Huh? When do  I  get to fall in love and get to wear the pretty white dress and flowers in my hair?  When I first heard the No Doubt song, "Simple Kind of Life", I cried. I could have written that song. I felt like Gwen saw right into my head and heart with those lyrics.  &nbsp;   And all I wanted was the simple things    A simple kind of life    And all I needed was a simple man    So I could be a wife     &nbsp;   I always thought I’d be a mom    Sometimes I'd wish for a mistake    The longer that I wait the more selfish that I get    You seem like you’d be a good dad     &nbsp;    &nbsp;  I find myself feeling lonely a lot. A lot more than I ever let on to anyone. If you are my friend, and you are reading this...well, there's lots of stuff you don't know. I don't tell everyone how I feel. It's especially hard to tell anyone how I feel when everyone around me is married, or getting married, or engaged, or moving in together, or having babies. . .etc.    &nbsp;  You know what I am? I'm a jar loosener.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Well, have you ever tried to get a jar open and tried and tried and couldn't, then handed the jar to someone else and they just popped it open, like it was nothing? And then jokingly, you say it's because you loosened it for them?  Well, men are like those jars. They need their "lids" loosened before they're ready to take the plunge into marriage.&nbsp; It seems that the majority of the men I've dated in my lifetime have gone off and gotten married to the next person they've dated after me.&nbsp; So obviously I've&nbsp;loosened their lids!&nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;  What really gets me is the women who have a good man, and they either don't realize it, or they  do  realize it and don't care! They don't appreciate what they have, and either treat him disrespectfully, or take him for granted, or both! Or, worse yet, the nice guy has one of these women and he  puts up with her shit .&nbsp; WTF?&nbsp;&nbsp; What happened to being a man?  &nbsp;  Maybe it's just my fate to be alone. I mean, I've fucked up my share of opportunities. Mostly by being blind to my real feelings and then not realizing those real feelings until it was too damn late. It doesn't help that every time I seem to hit it off with a man, or am just attracted&nbsp;to one, they're either married or gay. I kid you not.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now what's really confusing me is having The Ex pop back into my life in the midst of divorce. I honestly didn't need that right now, as it has opened up all those feelings again. When he and I first broke up, my sister-in-law used to tell me that if The Ex and I were meant to be together, we would find our way back to each other, whether it be a week, a month, or  years  down the road. Well, guess what? It's years down the road and here he is, soon-to-be-single.&nbsp; I don't want to find myself falling in love with him all over again and getting hurt all over again. Oh, and&nbsp;what else? That sister-in-law has served my brother with divorce papers. See what I mean about women having a good man and not appreciating them?  &nbsp;  I really shouldn't be dwelling on this stuff. I mean, it's only going to upset me, and cause me to have what I call a "depression session". (I was diagnosed in February, and for the most part, the meds have helped and I've been doing really well.)&nbsp; I can't fall apart now - I have an appointment with my psychiatrist next week!  &nbsp;  &nbsp;    &nbsp;

      I found this poem in a book, and have remembered it ever since.&nbsp; &nbsp;   He looks like a bowling pin, she looks like the ball.  All over the neighborhood, I meet them,  walking hand in hand, his stretching way down to hers.  They waddle-walk as really fat, or stupid, people do.  When I climb the stairs and pass their apartment  I see them sitting at their kitchen table.  They always leave their door open at dinnertime.  The smell of cabbage and old linoleum overpowers the hall.  &nbsp;  His face is like a shy bell, , fat and friendly at the bottom.  Her shape is shapeless with an overall impression of round.  He has a grey-flecked crew cut and an expression like a cow.  She has wispy mouse hair and cackles through rotten teeth.  I make small talk with them as they lumber up the stairs:  "You're out late," I say. "We're out late," he giggles.  "We're out late," she echoes. "It's late," he elaborates.  Poor, stupid, mismatched, and ugly, they have love.  &nbsp;  Yesterday, the Super told me that she was dead.  She had stepped out between parked cars and  got run over by a truck.  I walk up the stairs past their closed door  and picture him sitting on the padded chrome chair,  staring at the pearly Formica of the kitchen table,  his big, shy hands hanging between his knees, unheld,  and I cry.  &nbsp;  ~ Doug Dorph

      (This excerpt shamelessly stole from my buddy Jordan over on LJ.)  New Retirement Plan -  If you had purchased $1000.00 of Nortel stock one year ago, it would now be worth $49.00.  With Enron, you would have $16.50 left of the original $1,000.00.  With WorldCom, you would have less than $5.00 left.  But, if you had purchased $1,000.00 worth of beer one year ago, drank all the beer, then turned in the cans for the aluminum recycling price, you would have $214.00.  Based on the above, current investment advice is to drink heavily and recycle.  It's called the 401-Keg Plan...

I have one friend who flakes out on me all the time, one that seems to be lying to me, others that just don't seem to care...am  I  the problem? Is there something wrong with me that just attracts these people?? Hmm...next time I see my psychiatrist, I think I might pursue this line of thought.

      I woke up after three full hours of sleep, and although I'm tired, I can't seem to fall asleep again. So, after almost an hour and 15 minutes of just lying in bed, here I am.  I keep thinking about The Ex. (I've decided he needs to be capitalized, because he truly is  the  ex.) He's home now, and I can't help wondering how he's doing. I really don't want to let myself get hung up on him again. That's all I need.    When he and I were talking, he had asked me about my last boyfriend. Funny, but when I found myself telling The Ex about my other ex, I couldn't think of one good reason why he (the other ex) and I had even dated. The more I spoke about him, the more it became clear that we were  totally  different. Ironically enough, all the things that the other ex and I did not have in common, The Ex and I did!  Why the hell did The Ex and I ever break up? Oh wait. He dumped me, that's why. Right.  There is some wacko bird outside my apartment that must have his birdie body clock messed up. He's chirping away like it's sunrise and his job is to wake the neighborhood! It's not even 2 a.m. yet! Cuckoo bird. I suppose I should just shut the window.

      Today is a day of mixed feelings. Seeing my ex was great. He's beautiful, and I know I could very easily fall for him again. I guess I should be glad he lives in another state, or I think I'd be in big trouble!  I won't say too much here, as one day he might just come across my ramblings, but our visit was nice. I hope that this "new" friendship we have can flourish, because I really care about him. At first I was afraid that my feelings were only remnants of what we had in the past, but I've realized it's not. We are both the same people as we were, but yet different people, and the feelings I have for him now are new, if that makes any sense.   He'll be on a plane home shortly...I'm gonna miss that man. I can see planes depart and fly in from my front patio..I wonder if I looked out at just the right time, if I'd see his??  God, I'm such a sap.

      Hear that heavy breathing? It's me, recuperating from my daily exercise. I may groan, I may bitch, I may complain - but I keep pressing on, since the weight's coming off.  There may be heavy breathing of another kind going on tomorrow. That ex-boyfriend I mentioned before? He's coming over to see me. His last night in town, and he's spending it with me! I don't know whether I should feel flattered or not. Maybe it's just circumstance. I have  no  idea what to expect. This whole thing is kinda weird.  Speaking of weird...why are there so many stupid people in this world? I mean, because of the type of job I have, I speak to stupid people  every day.  But it wasn't until today that I realized I WORK with them, too! I'm an avid reader, and always have my nose in a book when I'm eating lunch. So there I sit, eating my lasagna, sipping my water, reading my book...and here comes someone. First of all, they decide that just because my nose is in a book, I can't possibly be  doing  something, so obviously it's okay to talk to me. Secondly, they ask one of the most stupidest questions ever to ask someone whose nose is in a book:  "You reading?"  Uhm...yeah. This is usually followed by a.) "Whatcha reading?" (I always want to say something very sarcastic after THAT question!) or, b.) "Any good?".  The very worst? "A book?"  Well, thank you Captain Obvious!  Bill Engvall, hand that person a sign!!

         Here I've started my very first blog, and I have no idea what to write. That's strange coming from a person that usually is never at a loss of what to say.  News this week: 16 pounds lost. I'm so excited! My clothes are beginning to feel loose, and I love it. Still a long way to go, but I'm doing it!  A friend of mine got engaged. I feel so old. I've never even been close to getting engaged, and haven't had a long-term boyfriend in ages. Hmm...maybe when I get skinny. :)  Speaking of boyfriends...my ex is in town. And this is no ordinary ex. This is my senior year of high school ex, the ex I was with for two years, the ex that I lost my virginity to, among other things. I'm supposed to see him this week. I've kept in touch with him off and on over the years, but I haven't actually seen him for about 13 years. I know we've both changed. He's going through a divorce right now. I'm a bit nervous to see him, but I'm sure it will be all right. I get all fluttery when I think about it, though. I have such a soft spot for him. You'd think this was our first date all over again, the way I'm feeling.  Well, work comes early in the a.m., so guess I'll sign off. Time to read for a while before the sandman claims me for his own for the night.

      The fastest part of your commute is down your driveway.   You were born somewhere else.   You know how to eat an artichoke.   The primary bugs that you worry about are electronic.   Your car has bullet-proof windows.   Left is right and right is wrong.   Your monthly house payments exceed your annual income.   You can't find your other earring because your son is wearing it.   You drive to your neighborhood block party.   Your family tree contains "significant others."   You don't exterminate your roaches, you smoke them.   You see 25 lawyers chasing an ambulance.   More than clothes come out of the closets.   You go to a tanning salon before going to the beach.   More money is spent on facelifts than on diapers.   Smoking in your office is not optional.   You pack shorts and a T-shirt for skiing in the snow, and a sweater and a wetsuit for the beach.   When you can't schedule a meeting because you must "do lunch."   Your children learn to walk in Birkenstocks.   Rainstorms or thunder are the lead story for the local news.   You'll reluctantly miss yoga class to wait for the hot tub repairman.   You consult your horoscope before planning your day.   A glass has been reserved for you at your favorite winery.   All highways into the state say: "no fruits."   All highways out of the state say: "Go back."   The Terminator is your governor.   You can't remember . . . is pot illegal?   It's barely sprinkling rain and there's a report on every news station: "STORM WATCH"   You actually get these jokes and pass them on to other friends from California.

      I ended up staying an extra day in Laughlin. I was having too much fun, and really didn't want to leave. I don't do well with goodbyes, and it was just as hard leaving yesterday as it was for me to say goodbye to my friends last week on their last day in San Diego. At least they have each other when I leave, I don't have anyone! :(  As most of you have probably guessed, these friends are a bit more than "friends". My love life has taken a turn, as I am now dating a couple instead of just one person. It suits me though, and it works for all of us. I'm very happy. :) (Aside from the fact that they moved 300 some odd miles away just as this relationship was getting off the ground.) All this time I've been looking for Mr. Right, when I should have been looking for Mr. AND Mrs. Right all along! LOL If you don't know about polyamory or polyfidelity, please  urlLink click here  for more info.   Laughlin was very hot, around 110-115 degrees each day. However, Monday was 122 DEGREES! Can we say HELL, boys and girls????? Ugh. Utterly miserable. The kind of heat in which you don't even want to go outside, or wear clothing, or even MOVE. I'm glad it wasn't like that every day I was there. I will never complain about the hot days in San Diego ever again.  My trip pretty much consisted of gambling, food, and errands. My friends are still in the "settling down" part of their move, and there were still things to be done. I got to visit SuperWalMart while I was there (actually, it was in Bullhead City, which is right across the river).  No matter where I go, I somehow always seem to end up at a WalMart! At least I had the opportunity to try some of the hotel buffets, which I've never done before. If you are planning a trip to Laughlin, eat at the Harrah's buffet.  Trust me on this one!  Yummy yummy stuff, and a lot of it!  I've never been much of a gambler. Usually just play around on the slots and that's it. However, my friends are into blackjack and craps. After standing around waiting for them, I've since decided something.  If you can't beat 'em, join 'em.  So I will have S teach me how to play cards and stuff so I can try my hand at gambling too.   A very funny thing happened my second day there. We were in a casino, waiting near the restroom, when I ran into a woman I used to work with many, many years ago. I probably hadn't seen her in 8 years or something close to that. Imagine running into her there. I wonder what the odds are? I have no idea. Anyway, she had just moved there last year. How crazy. I've always seemed to have friends that would run into people they knew no matter where we went, so I'm finally glad it happened to me!   The drive itself wasn't too bad. This is the first time I've driven anywhere long distance alone. Kinda quiet, gave me way too much time to think. Going up the 15 to Barstow wasn't bad, but I40 - geez! Nothing out there to look at but the other cars and it's so straight I thought I'd go nuts.  And there's only so many CDs a girl can listen to! At least the Needles Highway was entertaining - all these hills and valleys made it feel I was riding in a roller coaster!

       It doesn't interest me to know where you live or how much money you have.  I want to know if you can get up, after the night of grief and despair, weary and bruised to the bone, and do what needs to be done to feed the children.   It doesn't interest me who you know or how you came to be here.   I want to know if you will stand in the center of the fire with me and  not shrink back.   It doesn't interest me where or what or with whom you have studied.  I want to know what sustains you, from the inside, when all else falls away. I want to know if you can be alone with yourself and if you truly like the company you keep in the empty moments.

      I am feeling  so  much better! Been kinda bummed out the last couple of days, 'cause my honeys (I despise the word "partners", it's so impersonal) left on Saturday, for a temporary move to Laughlin.  Anyway, I spoke with them tonight, and it looks like I'm road tripping to Laughlin this weekend! Yay! I'm sure this is only the first of many!

      So, I was in Phoenix last week, right? Well, since I was there, I decided to call The Ex. Yes, that ex. I hadn't heard from him since he was in town last month. We chatted for a bit, and then of course, we moved on to other things, such as why I was in Phoenix in the first place. He told me that he and this woman he had kinda dated previously were going to try and see if a real relationship would work between them. Because of the way he had my feelings all loopdee-loo when he visited, I expected to be hurt, disappointed, sad, that he was starting a relationship with someone else, someone that wasn't me.   So what was the epiphany?  The epiphany was that I was honestly, genuinely HAPPY for him!  It didn't bother me in the least when he told me his news. I didn't have One. Little. Twinge. Not one. This made me realize that the relationship that I was developing in my life at the present time must be right! I'm happy, I'm content..I finally feel that I  fit  with someone, if that makes sense.  Sure, I know it's not gonna be an easy road ahead..but it's worth the effort when it's something you want, right?
