      well last night was alot of fun. Before the dance my dad sat down and talked to me... u kno one of "those" talks... "don't get to close to that girl or i'll break your arms." ... ok he didn't say that but was hinting at it... Then John and i met at my date, sam's house where johns date, lauren, also met us. Tuns of pics were taken... and of corse my dad forgot the camera.... hopefully sam will send me some. Johns sister must have taken at least 15. Then off to the dance... We got there just as they were letting everyone in. handed my $20 to mr. chinechi... then got our pic taken. after droping our stuff off at a table, we headed strait for the food/candy... about an hour later, we were on the dance floor. alot of it's a blur right now cus i'm tired lol... I think we slow danced 2 or 3 times... not as many times as usuall. Some people said we grinded once... but i kinda think it was a one handed slowdance to a fast song... I dono... we all had fun.. It had an abrupt ending cus u could take any poster u wanted home. They had at least 30 all over the walls... I got the recruit, and everone else got at least 2 each. Usuaully they play like 3 slow songs at the end so i was a little dissapointed that i didn't get to slowdance again. but o well! Then my dad picked us up and drove us to Uno's! On the way we sang to some Yellow Card on the radio.   At unos it took us a while to order. not many peeps were there. I got oreo cheese cake but it wasn't as good as i was expecting. we also got some bread sticks... Talked alot about random stuff... Then we went back, droped off the girls at sam's house... sadly they couldn't sleep over mine :( ... Later while john was playing with the trinkets in my room, i called sam and we talked for like 20 on the phone... them watching tv us ... being bored... Leme tell u the conversation was... very intersting... like every 2 min we were both like... "watcha doin?" cus we were so tired and forgot wat the other was doin. We finnally got to sleep around 2:30....  We woke up at 9 cus my dad made us, he made us waffles and backon.... We went down in the basment to play drums and later i kicked johns but in halo. We had fun. I called sam cus we were bored again but she didn't pick up. she's either still asleep.. or too lazy to answer the phone... or just forgot about her phone... Oops i'm sopposed to be at strike for the nda play in 10 min.. guess i'm not goin.   After john got picked up my parents talked about their party and my dance last night. It was kinda weird... now they started talking like... "Mike it's ok if u want to drink some beer at home... just to explore what the possiblities are like but never outside the home. We heard that there was alot of drinking at Malvern dances." #1 I've had beer once in my life... champane numerous times but i won't go there... #2 i'm responsible. There is a little drinking at the dances but not enough that shows. After party's on the other hand.... Then they were also like "We just don't want an unplanned pregnacy ... we might get sued". I mean come on! I wouldn't do a thing like that even if i was drunk.... i hope... Most people i kno kno that i believe in abstenence. O well... today i have tuns of homework... i feel yuky so i'm probably gona take a shower... thank god schools almost over... i can't wait for summer where i can go out and do stuff like this more often. I'll leave u with a dashbored confeshonal song i'm sure uve all heard.... I kno it's a girly band but i just think this part kinda fits... i have a feeling i'll probably write a song later today...  Hands down this is the best day I can ever remember, I'll always remember the sound of the stereo, the dim of the soft lights, the scent of your hair that you twirled in your fingers and the time on the clock when we realized it's so late and this walk that we shared together. The streets were wet and the gate was locked so I jumped it, and I let you in. And you stood at your door with your hands on my waist and you kissed me like you meant it. And I knew that you meant it, that you meant it, that you meant it, and I knew, that you meant it, that you meant it.

      as promised here are the lyrics to the song that i just wrote:  i felt a good feeling when i stood there, my arms around your waist, your arms on my shoulders... swaying back and forth, to the sounds of the music.  lookin around, past each others eyes. staring up at the movie, on the wall. and then the slow song stopped... but we continued to dance! we continued to dancee!...  when the song stopped,  we never stopped dancing. we kept goin on an on an on an on and ...we were dancing.  it was gettin kinda late, and the dance was almost over. the girls said sit, i said no way. so i said, baby gime one last dance...  so we ran out on the dance floor, put my arms around your waist, she put her your arms on my shoulders... and started to sway back and forth, to the sounds of the music.  when the song stopped,  we never stopped dancing. we kept goin on an on an on an on and ...we were dancing. (we kept dancing, Mike Splain)

Musical,  the best show in the world, its the musical... i'm never gona do a thing like this again(background person)  Tuesday after school,  i went back to the show. looked at the paper, and saw that i didn't get a lead part...  i was a little bit sadd.... a little bit lownly... then i realized... that i wasn't the only one there!  It was the Musical,  the best show in the world, its the musical... i'm never gona do a thing like this again  Opening night, i walk out on stage, the lights shine down, bright in my eyes. now i'm staring out, into the crowd. waiting for my que to move... ... closing night, we had a blast, it's all over, over at last. i made so many friends, and i hope to see them all again!  in next years Musical,  the best show in the world, its the musical... maybe i'll do a thing like this again (Musical, Mike Splain)

      well it's been along time since my last update... last week sucked.. alot of stuff but clases are now over.   Friday: First review day, in gym we played hockey which was awsome. Pat, trying to do a slapshot, missed and hit my leg with the stick, breaking it in half. It really didn't hurt much but it was funny.  Sat and sun were filled with studying for exams and sun we had the gloria concert. It sounded great.   Today we had our first exam, Math, and i think it went well. Afterwards we went to the frosh awards cerimony. My dad gave out some fathers club awards cus he's the 9th grade representitive dad.. or watever it is.... Later near the end, i got a special award for Music. The teachers vote on the kids with the highest GPA in that class and choose who they think worked the hardest and they like the most. I was really suprised. Afterwards my mom, dad, and i went to unos for some food. Then we came home and i studied for awhile then i went for a bike ride... i went for awhile, about 5 miles through the park and the pathways.   Now i'm off to studying for this impossible Spanish exam tomorrow... i'm so excited...
