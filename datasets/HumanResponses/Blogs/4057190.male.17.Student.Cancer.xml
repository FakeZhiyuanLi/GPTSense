      Hey peeps   well as i mentioned yesterday, Imma start working today and at 1st it was a Nightmare!.. I work now at a McDonalds and like Im the guy who does the burgers and I feel sorry for whoever eats my burgers because I cant cook!..lol  At first it was hard to understand how to use the oven and all the machinary but I figured it all out in the end thanks to a very cool co-worker of mines, Alejandro. He basically taught me everything there is to know while working in Mickey D's.  From what I see. Imma try to keep the job or at least until I get my check! :D  lol.   Wel to conclude its been a great 1st day of work as my 1st job. I gotta go sleep now its getting late. I'll keep blogging lata aight ;-).  Jay Jay

      Hey People wassup!   Well&nbsp; as from what you can see from my Blog Title I'm Finally Making Money!!... Well Not really, one of my best friends,  urlLink  Miriam  , hooked me up at a McDonalds right here in Manhatan. I'm worried because I really dont want to be a Cashier because of the fact that I gotta be handling w/ the stores money and I dont wanna be blamed for having missing money, when I already know that the Manager actually steals from it!!   Im expected to go to work for my first day tomorrow and I hope that&nbsp; I do great!  Wish me luck people!   Jay Jay

      Hey peeps  Its been awhile since I last blogged well FYI its been cuz I quit my job because I couldnt stand the employees at the McDonalds, everything was going swell until Like the the managers were starting to act stupid w/ me. and Im not all about stupidity. Shit why the fuck you pressuring the new guy to be superfast on everything if I never even worked there before and I dont even have a week.  Some bitchy manager (who seemed super cool at 1st) tried to blame me for losing her keys. well I did gave them back to her and since i got a good memory i specifically told her where at, the time, and almost made her feel mad dumb. Then she was like "ooh then maybe I might've gave it to some other guy", then after the next 1/2 hr she comes saying that the "other guy" had it. i couldnt tolerate w/ this bullshit anymore, and plus she didnt even appologize for blaming me. so then I decided to quit. I personally dont agree to like work at a place where im not comfortable and that at least lets you select the days that you will be working for. not just some  Radom Days    I really was too ashamed to tell this to  Miriam  because the poor gurl really wanted for me to stay and wanted for us to stay working there. Im too ashamed and embarassed to look at her right in the eye but hey. I prefer not wasting 8hrs everyday of my life doing something that I dont not enjoy doing.  Bad ending  Jay Jay
