      I dont like the feeling of wet bracelets on my skin. If I weren't lazy I'd take them off before I washed my hands.   Silent Hill Remixes:  1 Fukuro 2 Caramel  3 Kinoko    maniac, yes.   Every time I get those muscular spasms telling me it's "time" for some bowel movement, I have to stop and kill ants around the toilet. It's getting on my nerves. As soon as I stoop to smash them the spasms stop. Then I know that I have to wait for them to start again or I get NOTHING.  stupid ants. So I just ate more laxatives and I'm waiting for magic to happen. I don't even know what the ants are after in the bathroom. Do ants like toothepaste?   Henry is doing good at the hospital. He just needs to pass some gas and they'll let him out. It means he's recovering.   Urp. Peristalsis is happening.

      Shake: You are the gayest monster since GAY came to GAYTOWN.  Willie: Whoaa, easy! Where..where's this coming from?  Shake: No, let's get down to it. What I say is very baffling!  Frylock: WHOA WHOA WHOA YOU TWO! We don't want any trouble here now, ok?  Willie: No, I'm with you. I don't think violent solves anything.  Shake: GOD you're gay! You don't think violence "solves anything"? What kind of monster are you?  Willie: I-I'm pretty hardcore. I mean, I've been known to do a number on plenty of cats.   Shake: "Do a number"?? Yeah, I bet you do a number.        In your tights,        On Broadway,        Which is where you'd move to,        After Texas Chainsaw Mascara, Where you're FROM.   Willie: What's he talking about?  Shake: How much do you wanna bet me-you couldn't scare  jack

      A dog ate my head But he told me it needed a side of oysters  Henry has appendicitis. He's at the hospital. He made my mom go through the hospital cabinets to see what kind of drugs they had. Weird man. Likes them drugs too much.  I still have a week's worth of stool in me. For once I'll be glad to see my own fecal matter, outside my body, in a toilet of course.   I dreamt I was married yesterday. I hate to admit it but was very pleasant and I felt secure and happy. And all of a sudden the shadowy guy [a recurring character in several dreams] is there. Obscure subconscious longings, I guess.   Obscure references to bad Things

      I like them very very much. His voice rings more majestic than the those of the seraphs in heaven. Nobody can yodel "burn chest hair" like Jimmy Urine. NOBODY. I like to repeat things. Over and over and over. No one can yodel "burn chest hair" like Jimmy Urine.   I don't need no chemical blow to pull no ho, all I need is chemical bank to pay her up. That's something kids should learn in school.   I got the idea to do this blog from Achewood. I guess I'm the target consumer for any apocalyptic corporate.. place since I'm so easily manipulated.   I could've grouped all 3 of my posts today into one long entry. But I don't feel like it. I don't like armpit hair, it's very uncomfortable. Why do I keep forgetting to take care of this when I'm showering? I don't know. Do you know? Maybe. Probably.   I quit xanga today so I can devote [a creepy amount of] time to you. My new obsession for the week. My obsession/mania/fixation with Gorillaz/Blur went on hiatus yesterday. A hiatus from which there is no return. If that's even...logical. Yeah, I don't make a lot of sense.   My own mother has a blog.  I didn't think it was weird. Until all my friends gave me negative comments. My mom isn't really sad and lonely.  ... ... Well maybe. Shut up! Get out of my head! If my mom is sad and lonely than I don't even deserve to live.      maybe if you stared    long enough into the sun    you might become blind.   So try it.

      For the sake of testing templates I'm going to write an obnoxiously long post. Just because. I like to see how blogs look with a lot of text. since I'm garrulous when it comes to writing. SO.  Wow. Where did the warm sloshing fluid of creativeness go? I do not know. Certain persons keep bombarding me with boring talk on aim. Somehow I always mess up when I make new sns. I forget I'm keeping a low profile and talk to people. then they go "eunice?" and I go "oops". and then they know. they know dammit they know.  yes, no, maybe so. I'm being a horrible sarcastic mocking-type-thing now. If only sarcasm killed. If only.  yeah that wasn't very long. I don't have the warm shloshing fluids in me right now. That would sound very bad if someone misinterpretted it. Misinterprettededinpretded? asjkljers hard word.

      I am sensing something very strong right now. Those herbal pills my dad suggest I eat might be working. Bless them herbal pills.    I like blogger.com. People can spell properly here. They also know their grammar. They don't show cleavage or post porn to get some traffic to their blog. When I think about it, that was really [ultimately] sad.   I read some really awesome blogs today, full of substance. I really wanted to post a comment but I chickened out for the billionth time and I don't understand. I wasn't so shy before, maybe a year or two ago. But now every time I try to push the submit button I'm seized with a sudden terror. It's really a shame because I want to tell people I like their well-written entries. I thought the whole point of the "blog" was to share feelings and make friends, eunice. What the feck's wrong with you??  Must be all those prepubescent rantings I did at forums. They can emotionally cripple you sometimes.
