      I cannot believe that you have that picture up.  Where did you get that? How old is that? I still have bangs! Well, not like THAT's anything new or exciting.  I think Monique was here when we took that.  Funfun.  you know, I am quite proud over the fact that I don't really have bangs anymore. I mean, yes, they're there, and they're kind of annoying, but I took the time to actually GROW THEM OUT! You being a boy, you don't understand the difficulties.  It is HARD.  Cos they get in the way, and they look really unflattering when they stick up out of a headband.  And since I have a cowlick, (shudders), they NEVER do what would be nice.  They're always flopping over in the wrong direction.  And I kind of miss them. They hid my eyes quite nicely from my wierd old man, and hid my forehead which is quite gross from everyone else.  Yeah.   Jiminy Crickets, I'm hungry.  Which means I have to go upstairs.  Crud.

      Why did they have to come home? I mean, really, besides the fact that they both have jobs and that they have a house here, why couldn't they just stay down there and be miserable without inflicting it on us? I just don't get it at all.  You know, I usually plot my day around, "How much time will I have to spend with them?" If I go upstairs now, I know I'm going to have to spend at least an hour with them, and hear absolutely EVERYTHING about AZ at least twice.  Then they'll get pissed at me when I tell them that I won't go out to eat with them....   They really are too much.

      Just went out and purchased Mega Millions lottery tickets. I assumed the drawings were on Wednesdays and Saturdays (like the regular ticket drawings) but, instead, MM drawings are held Tuesdays and Fridays.   Poop.  Anyway, if I win, that makes me officially rich and beautiful. I'll celebrate by buying every reader of this blog a bottle of your favorite sparkling beverage.**  **Overall odds of winning 1:43. You get the bottle only if I win more than $100,000.

      W00t.  What is with the pic of you without a SHIRT on?  I mean, are you trying to get a cold or something? I just don't understand.   Margaret Cho was hilarious.   Right now I am listing slightly to the right. I can see out a windo wnad all that is visible is a partial view of a neighbor's old green fence and part of their roof.  If I list slightly to the left, I can see a white wall with a view of an old bulletin board.  Straight ahead is my computer, and to the side of that is a picture of Alan Rickman when he was about twenty.    How did you like my Hemingyway interpretation? Maybe I should go back and take out the periods and discriptive words.  God I hate Hemingway.  He was a fat old bastard who flouted the rules of the english language and got away with it.  If I tried to write a story like that, I would get laughed out of every single publisher's building in the GALAXY, but when he does it, it becomes symbolic.  Fuck that. It's raining outside = My life is a complete mess and my true love is dead. I didn't know she was my true love but that was because I was drunk and stupid and somehow this rain on my face conveys to me the message of how deep my love was for her and now that she's dead I can't do anything about it.   All that from "It's raining outside." Then the book ends. Hemingway rewrote that sentence an estimated 27 times.  What did he do? "Raining, it was outside?" or possibly, "Outside, raining, is was?" I'm glad his editor caught that one.

      First post on blogspot. I just got this blog so I could post comments in  urlLink my sister's blog .   I hate the word "blog." It sounds like a small creature you'd squash with your shoe, or perhaps the noise said creature would make once you squished it.  I'm a grammar Nazi and far-far-far-left liberal. If you found me here, then you probably know what you're getting yourself into.   One would hope.   Oh, and to get things started off on the right foot, here's Bob the Angry Flower:

      Can I just say in a totally non-offensive way that you pick crummy boyfriends? I mean, I just got yelled at by mo because I'm too picky (apparently) and then we got into this conversation about how people pick people that aren't good for them. They pick people that won't stand up for them or be there when they're needed or be nice, everyone always picks really crappy people.  I don't know why.  Like, why is it that people go out and find someone who has flaws like their parents and says, "Oh, I can fix them. They'll get better to be around me."  I don't get that. It seems so stupid.  You can't fix anyone, any more than you can change what you had for breakfast yesterday. I don't get why people think that. And I'm not picky, but high school boys are gross.  To quote, "Have you seen the unwashed miscreants that go to that school?"  People start to like eachother just because they're around them all the time.  It's like everyone "pairs off", so stupid.  You wouldn't like them if you had other options. WHY are people stupid? Why don't they get that?   I hate people.   By the way, Did you win the lottery?

        You are a  STUDENT  of the English language!   You are on your way to becoming gramatically sound; however, you must keep studying if you ever want to be a master.  You do manage to speak better than most Americans, but then again, that's not really saying too much...    urlLink   How grammatically sound are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    I bow to thee, you great Grammar Genie!

      I am so sick and tired. Where do you go when you're done? I want to be DONE. Tomorrow, after all of my tests and stuff, I have a graduation practice. Yucky. But it's all good. Then I'll be done. That is, until Thursday, when there is senior mass and breakfast. Ucky.  Do you have to sit with your parents for that? What was it like?  Was it embarrassing or did you get to sit with people you liked/knew? I really hope seating isn't assigned cos I want to sit with my FRIENDS. Yeah. Sucks, though, cos my parents will probably make me sit with Pierson (this really really gross disgusting boy who deserves to go to that dark scary place underground for at least a month who mom and dad actually wanted me to go out with, grosssssssssss....) ok, yeah, I realize that's a long explination. I read in the paper today that there is this A-list celeb that publishes a blog on tripod.  Just because he's famous, his blog gets read. It's an ok blog, I read some of the entries. whoever he is, he's a well-versed guy, knows what he's talking about, and when he doesn't know, he doesn't bullshit his way through.  But he has like three million readers and I (who am ever so much more deserving) only have like 5 readers, and they're all either related to me or are my friends.  Mom yelled at me today about my face.  "Darling, there's medicine for that sort of thing! Are you sure you're using it? I just don't like to see you like this. You're not taking proper care of yourself." PUH-LEASE. Like it wasn't her genes that gave me this dreaded disease anyways.

      The scanner is broken. I can't seem to get it to connect to my computer or I'd scan in fabulous old pictures.   But in the meantime -- see how you stack up.    You are a  GRAMMAR GOD !   If your mission in life is not already to preserve the English tongue, it should be. Congratulations and thank you!    urlLink   How grammatically sound are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      I'm so tired. It's been a day. Sorry you got stuck with the 'rents -- I got stuck with allergies. Who was worse off?   Besides, you looked totally cute with bangs, and there's nothing wrong with your forehead. I think you inherited your negative self-image from me, but I've decided to disown you from that particular bequeathing. Because it's  lame  and  untrue .   And that's not just me as your big brother talking. That's everyone who's ever seen a picture of you, so there.   I am so off to bed. Hurry up and turn 21 so you can be my designated driver.

      I love you! You are the coolest ever. Did you know that God loves you too? Yup. True true true.  He made u for a specific reason and you are who you are because of Him.  He loves you so so so much.  Go read Ephesians. Yeah. So last night we looked through the dell catalog, and dad had a few questions... so we call the guys at dell to ask some questions and then dad finds out he can get $50.00 off if he orders right then, so he starts haggling over the price. he took so long that the lady helping him had her compie switched off and then couldn't complete the order.  yeah. But I'm getting a dell laptop.  Yay me.  But it's much more money than I want to let mom and dad spend, cos they'll lord it over me forever...

        Get a  urlLink  LiveJournal   account.    Mom is too cranky. I thought PMS stopped when the periods do, and I know for a fact she had a hysterectomy.    I am having a bad hair day.    Remember: Wonder Woman died for your sins.    George Bush looks kinda sexy bald:
