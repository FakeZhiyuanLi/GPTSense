      Now that this is not battletech how are we going to use warhammer 40k. I mean i guess&nbsp;it could be in a completely differant galaxy. Like the people evacuated when the horus heresy (giant war) started maybe. That wouldnt be that hard because they could still have all their technology. Maybe new races would be in the new galaxy? Oh yeah I also have some great space marine pictures. And other pictures. Should I post them?

      I think I found some new leaders for ÆGIS, which means I have only 13 leadership spots left on the board. And for those who think leading will be easy: It's not. You need to be able to spend time online, often, working on this. For the new leaders, you will need to choose a  urlLink government type , or make one.&nbsp; Our Ideas have changed. The story, to save me a whole bunch of legal troubles, is not going to be based on battletech. Yeah, I know that sucks. But if we based it on Battletech, I would have to work out&nbsp;killer legal matters with Microsoft, and I would probably make a wrong step and end up getting sued, which would suck. We can still make the galaxy, but I am going to be making an all new backstory for it. Which will take me forever. But hey, it's just a means to an end. I GET TO WASH DISHES ALL DAY TODAY! Great. Culinary Arts is nearing the end of it's usefulness. Well, I'll see you tomorrow.

      ... ... I am suffering... From Writer's Block... ... ... Help... Me... ... ... If you still don't understand what ÆGIS is, it's basically just about the biggest scifi roleplay you will ever find, (I Hope it will become this, at least)

      Well, It comes down to this. In the backstory, seventeen exploration teams were particle-warped, which means I'm looking for 16 other leaders, you will need to be fanatically committed because we will need to work the hardest to maintain each empire. You will create a backstory for your empire, choose a government, divide it up, etc. Apply by emailing me above.

      Hey Everybody. This is my first post here, and I'm itching to get to bed, so I am going to explain away some rough things that typically can be very difficult for an Idea like this to overcome.   -I'm going to need LOTS of people with a variety of skills. Apply by emailing me.  urlLink dakro@myway.com    -The BackStory is Basically Taken Care of, due to a few weeks of homework on my part. It spawns from Battletech&nbsp;about 100 years before the Succession Wars, (really big wars that destroyed a whole bunch of kingdoms and technology). &nbsp;&nbsp;

      IP. Short for Intellectual Property. The stuff we've been dealing with since I first said, "Let's make our own galaxy!". It can very easily be stolen and used by bad people for maniacal evil we cannot begin to comprehend. Or that's what the guy at 1-900-need-law said. Don't quote me on that. But really, IP is fragile and very easily stolen. I'm going to check some random expert sites to try and see what we need to do. From an article in  Game Developer Magazine  I gathered that the best way to protect IP is through a copyright. And to prevent the negligent chance I might flip you all off and run away with your ideas, It seems as though the best way to protect IP is to put it in the name of a company. Problem is, we don't have a company. Question is, How do we create a company? My dad says when he made his company (Paragon Marble and Tile) He had to file a stack of paperwork as tall as himself and shuck out a good deal of cash. He said most of that was an insurance deposit in case he screwed up someone's house. Making the business was the easy part. I need to check this out, but for now, we need contracts put in the name of the, oh I dunno, Sykes group, stating that you will not run away with ÆGIS. Like that would happen. We also need to file a copyright and make friends with an attorney. Any help on this from anyone would be grand. I accept investments in the form of cash and check.

      How ya doing guys? Ok. Enough of the small talk. The aliens are a go, if you're up to it. Though I am not sure if they will be the reason we moved offplanet. I need someone (who is not working on aliens. Yes, she knows I'm talking to her. 'What about the other girls?' What other girls!? Shutup or get outta my head you piece of alien scum!  STONEHENGE.  Oh, Did I just hint that I think Celtic religion would be a good one? Oops. The aliens should be about a next to impossible challenge for us to face, be it through technological superiority or just overwhelming numbers of genetically engineered super-chickens.) As I was saying before I was so rudely interrupted, I need someone to work on the "Means and the Motive" of our trip to another galaxy. Why did we do it and how did we get cut off from Earth (or Terra or whatever) so completely that we were forced to start anew on the planets with no palpable plans whatsoever? That's about it for the old, in with the new. You guys must post  at least  once every thirty days before you lose your position as Empire commanders. You may still be able to contribute but it will probably never be at the same level as before. Another big post will come in roughly 5 min. After I relogin to the Library internet.

      Alriiight, I'm one o' da guys! Honored, to be sure! :P. I've been on 'vacation' (if it's not relaxing, it shouldn't be called a vacation, dammit!) for the last few days, and it looks like my computer time for August is gonna be limited. Why must I be so freakin' busy all of a sudden? Anyway. I It's not surprising that we can't officially do anything with Warhammer 40K, which sucks. but Games Workshop is kinda uptight about their stuff, I think. Reaper Miniatures is a way cool company ( urlLink www.reapermini.com ), and they have a game involving mechs. If we still want to work with a pre-existing game world, you might want to check out CAV and their background. No idea if it's got anything we can play around with, but I do know that they have big stompie vehicles!  But if we're gonna go off on a completely new thing all our own, I'd be totally willing to 'adopt' an alien race. Just give me a few basics (humanoid, reptilian, insectiod, primitive, advanced...etc...) and I'd be happy to mess around with creating some culture, basic language and history. I'll admit right off the bat that I've always leaned more toward the inhuman. So if we want some aliens, I'll be there for makin' aliens.  Just throwing some stuff out there. Also, if we do go our own original way, is there anything at all form making this totally our own...series of books, perhaps? (At the least...a game would be totally awesome, but I'm no programmer).  Hmmm...tried to edit this to fix that address link...hope I didn't double or triple post.

      I just wanted to tell all of you, the ideas have been changed, once again. I have (after hellish trial and error) found that we cannot use Warhammer for our base either. The company, Gameworks, I think it is, would charge us excorbiant amounts of money for the rights to base our story off theirs. So that said, our supplies our exhausted. We have to be completely original to do this, and I have come upon a few ideas to begin with, though if you guys (and gal, oh screw it, you're one of the guys now) come up with others I would be delighted. Think of things that would force us to expand:   Global Warming  Over-Crowding  Disease  Decline of Natural Resources  Radical Expansion, (Where a group of radicals, e.g. Naturalists or Survivalists, Embark to another star system in order to, uh, get away from it all?  Scientific Expansion, (Cold Wars, perhaps?)  War  Alien Life (Please, no aliens. Unless you want to design them, make languages, history, culture, technology, government, clothing, etc.)  Anything else you can come up with   Let your imagination run wild.  Give me a list of 7 or more Ideas  with a short (sentence or two) explanation about them.   "Once we lay the foundation, then we may build the fortress."       -Hephaeustus
