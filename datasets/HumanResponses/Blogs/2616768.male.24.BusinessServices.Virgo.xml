      Our song plays on the radio. It evokes memories of a time when everything was just so right. We didn't worry so much about our differences. We didn't worry so much about the obstacles in our path. We didn't worry so much about the future. We had our dreams which we were determined to achieve. We had our plans which we were determined to carry out. But reality eventually crept in, and we found our differences scrutinized under the harsh light of day. The obstacles were larger than we expected and the future was irresolute. We realized that our bond wasn't strong enough, and we, along with our dreams and plans, were no more.  Our song plays on the radio. It conjures up memories of a past, our past, that I will not part with. Memories that will always remind me of how love became possible, however one's fortress seemed impregnable, however contrarily I once believed. These are just about everything that I have of you these days, and I will not be denied of them.  Our song plays on the radio. It elicits a vision of you, and along with it, a ray of light that enables me to see the real you. This "you" that is good and giving and thoughtful and kind. This "you" that is steadfast and zealous and unshakable and will stand by your beliefs. I finally see myself in you; and armed with a new wisdom that comes with accrued experiences, our differences don't anymore seem to loom as large as they once did.  Our song plays on the radio. It reminds me of your perseverance. It reminds me that you are stronger than you appear to be. It reminds me that you, despite everything, are still there for me. The song evolves into something else. It becomes our personal truth conveniently parceled into stanzas and refrains and bridges and whatnot. It elicits a very distinct emotion that I couldn't even begin to justify with words. And as the song now draws to a close, allow me to hope once more that ours can begin anew.

       On the westbound 10Fwy:   ·Vincent Av. 1¾ mi  ·Vincent Av. 1 mi  ·Vincent Av. ½ mi  ·Vincent Av. ¼ mi  ·Vincent Av. Exit.   I didn't take my exit.  Perhaps half-intentionally. I kept on driving all the way to downtown Los Angeles some twenty or so miles west. I didn't have one good reason to do this. Miss my appointment and waste gas...no one does that. Yet I did. I just felt I had to. Maybe I needed a physical analogy to where I am in my life right now. Something tangible I can catalogue into my personal experiences.  I missed my exit today. Just like how I've missed a lot of exits in the past. It took me to places I never planned on going. I was sure of my course but not my destination. Was I looking for some catharsis today? Maybe. Wow. Catharsis. Something I haven't encountered since my psych undergrad days. Did I find it today? I felt I did. And by this one unexplained act, I knew that I could read my map again, without confusion, without ambivalence.

      Just coz I try to be a good role model doesn't mean I won't make bad choices.  Just coz I'm here to support you all the way doesn't mean I don't need some support myself.  Just coz I'm diligent at my work doesn't mean you can overwork me to the ground.  Just coz I keep secrets tightly guarded doesn't mean you can burden me with lots of yours.  Just coz I always give excellent advice doesn't mean you'll get one anytime you fancy asking.  Just coz I'm your lifeline to sanity doesn't mean you couldn't possibly drive me crazy.  Just coz I give you my time to help solve your problems doesn't mean I don't have my own to solve.  Just coz I'm zealously tidy in all things doesn't mean I'd gladly clean up your mess.  Just coz I'm great with kids doesn't mean I'm willing to babysit yours.  Just coz I'm generous doesn't mean I don't run out of resources.  Just coz I'm just a phone call away doesn't mean I'll always entertain you.  Just coz I'm understanding doesn't mean you can abuse my good nature.  Just coz I don't get tired doesn't mean I won't tire of you.  Just coz we're inextricably entwined doesn't mean I wouldn't sever our ties.  I may be good. I may be kind.  I may  be the most wonderful, compassionate, unselfish, non-judgmental person you'll ever come across.  You know me more than I'd suffer anyone else to, so I'd have you know this as well: It doesn't follow I couldn't be otherwise.

      My best friend just got his order for army deployment today. He'll be leaving by the end of January. First stop, Washington state; then it's Germany, and from there either to Afghanistan or Kosovo or Iraq. It hasn't yet sunk in my mind. You see this kind of stuff on television everyday, but you hoped it wouldn't happen to you, how someone so close to you will be engaged in a war half a world away. For a moment, time stops, noises fade, your vision blurs... it has become personal. Twelve to eighteen months away from home....

      What do I want?  I want to enjoy my family and friends. I want good health. I want a cat. I want to be able to pursue my dreams. I want to go to places I planned on going to. I want to be able to do the things that others say I couldn't do. I want to prove them wrong. I want to pave the way for others. I want to be good, I want to be strong. Not only for myself but for the ones that matter to me. I want them to be proud of me as much as I am proud of them. I want them to know that. I want to be able to continue remembering everyone's birthdays. That one matters, you know, for sometimes almost everyone forgets-- and my remembering could have made all the difference . I want to be able to read the books I've shelved over the years. I want to go to Barcelona and speak fluent Catalan. I want to be able to mix drinks as expertly as my best friend does. I want to remember everyone's little and big kindnesses. I want to be able to pay them back. I want to be able to hug my all friends, my acquaintances, my family, even those whom I've had a falling out with. They have molded me into what I am now. They equally deserve the credit (and the blame ~hahah~). I want to make a difference, little ones and big ones, every single day that I've been given to live out. I want to have good counsel and be wealthy in all aspects--material, spiritual, social, emotional--so I can be efficiently provident. And in the end, this for me shall suffice: that I, having been given this much, had given back something more.

      Carlo n'est jamais satisfait complètement de lui. Il y a plus à accomplir, il y a plus à réaliser, il y a plus à s'en améliorer. Il peut devenir assez ennuyant, vraiment. Il aime examiner ses limites, et cela n'a pas toujours fonctionné à son avantage. Mais il insiste sur le fait qu'on ne sait jamais ce qu'il attrapera s'il ne lance pas sa ligne de pêche plus loin et plus loin dehors chaque fois. On n'est jamais sûr simplement ce qui pourrait être hors de cacher là dans les profondeurs.  Carlo ose caractéristiquement dans le grand inconnu, les eaux inexplorées, et il est merveilleusement étonné chaque fois. Une femme écrivain britannique, dont l'aphorisme Carlo se rappelle maintenant plus que sa nom, une fois a remarquée «Ne jamais regrette. S'il est bon, il est merveilleux; s'il est mauvais, c'est expérience.» C'est une sagesse de poche qui Carlo se rappelle à chaque heure. Le monde dans ses manifestations empiriques et abstractions impondérables entièrement est un endroit immensément merveilleux qu'aucun mot ne peut guère commencer pour décrire. Il lui défie. Et le savoir qu'il ne peut pas contenir entièrement dans le catalogue de ses expériences personnelles rend seulement le monde infiniment intéressant pour lui. Il le respire tout puisqu'il pourrait.    «Au Nouveau Monde!»,   cria  urlLink le genois . C'est où Carlo naviguera, partout où ce soit.

      Last Tuesday, I saw the sea again. I haven't been to the sea in such a long time that I had nearly forgotten how beautiful it is. We had somewhat clear skies last Tuesday (it's been raining here for over a week now), and it was fantastic to see the sea glisten under a mid-afternoon sun. It's humbling, really, when you begin to think about it. You worry constantly about the little things, but what are all your worries compared to the magnificence that is around you? It more than compensates for the trifling inconveniences we encounter everyday.  Starting Monday, I'll be seeing more of the sea. It will be good for me.

      "Give me solitude," so said I when pressed for what I want. "...Solitude."  I need to be alone. I need to think. I want my thoughts to wander far and search for answers. I'm stuck in a rut, and only I can pull myself out. But I cannot do it if you don't stop jabbering. I'll reach out to you when I do, but for now, give me solitude.

      Yes, amazing. There's simply no other word for it.  I thought that when I bid them goodbye, yet another one of my goodbyes, it won't affect me. Life goes on, so don't let's now stop to pay attention to the pain of parting. I thought that time has made me a tough one; I thought that I wouldn't be affected. And yet I am. This present poignancy crosses its threshold and it becomes an undeniable truth.  I am so used to leaving. People, places, pets, everything I guess. But I never get used to the rituals of farewells. Maybe that's why I'd rather leave unannounced, "taking the French leave" as it's called. And I have quite built up a notoriety for it. For I want to spare everyone these rituals. I want to spare everyone these awkward emotions. When I leave, I always want to do so preemptively, and I'll have none of your  despedidas . And the customary two week's notice? It just ain't my thing.  This sadness I now feel leaves me quite amazed. Amazed at the fact that I, whose life has been a catalogue of departures, still feel this way everytime I leave. Amazed that it never gets easy, amazed that I never get used to it. And yet it is a constant source of contentment, for it reaffirms my own appropriately imperfect humanity, and validates the significance of all that I go to, go through, and go with in life.

      I just saw my first hummingbird of the year today, hovering about the pomegranate bush in the backyard. It's a sure sign that, here in the land of eternal sunshine, spring has (nearly) arrived. I guess I should start with my spring cleaning soon. Then again, there's not much for me to discard this year anyway. Coz unlike my kinfolk, I am not a pack rat. Not a physical pack rat, that is. And I wish I could say the same for the rest of my life. But however we wish to discard seemingly worthless chunks of our lives, we can only at best recycle them into something functional or at least something ornamental, if we are so inclined to the task.  Life doesn't come with a Big Eraser , so goes the cliché. You cannot repudiate your past; you can only move on.   Lenten is come with love to toune, With blosmen and with briddes roune, That all this blisse bringeth.   Spring has come with love among us, With flowers and with the song of birds, That brings all this happiness.

      And in the end, what does it really matter? To have lived, to have loved, to have lost and gained and brought home the bacon. To have laughed, to have cried, to have felt a little hope and just enjoyed the moment. To have been kind, to have been cruel, to have been acquiescent to the point of perfected indifference. To have sung, to have danced, to have delivered your life's soliloquy on a stage that had never been entirely yours. To have been vanquished, to have been triumphant, to have been wretched and divine all at once just to prove your point. To have made good on some of your promises, to have defaulted on others, to have redeemed yourself and crucified your soul. To be remembered, to be forgotten, to have flowers brought to your grave and a prayer uttered for your eternal repose. For in the end, what does it really matter? Whether you've been the Queen of Castile or the Harlot of Seville, we all are just migrants through time and space and consciousness, nothing more than a trifling handful of dust.

      And all of a sudden, I am overcome with tremendous sorrow. For all of my sins, for all of my shortcomings, for all the good things that I have let go of. Such tremendous sorrow that it borders on grief. I have never been an emotional person, having always turned instead to thinking things through. Everything has a reason, all things that befall us; it may not be at once apparent, but there is always a reason. And I want to give up on it.

      So yeah. It's been one month since I decided to set up my own weblog. I've really been writing a journal in my mind ever since I could form coherent thoughts. About stuff around me, about my friends and family, about other people, about my experiences in general, personal and vicarious. My two cents on what is right and wrong with the world. Drew, a dear friend from grade school, once remarked that what I said needed to be heard (or read) by many more.  But me being Carlo , I just shrugged it off.  "They don't need to know about what I think."  was my characteristic response. Still, as the years progressed, I felt I needed some outlet for all the things that were brewing in my mind. Hence, this weblog, some ten years after those words were uttered.  I have long been ambivalent on advertising my thoughts anywhere--online, in my organizations' logbooks, on message boards, wherever. While I have always believed that what I said (or thought) made sense, two reasons held me back as well. First, I always got myself in trouble for saying too much.  "The more you say, the more likely you are to say something foolish,"  so said Gracián. Second, I always felt that my ideas and thoughts were like my children: once I put them in print, once I let them go, they're not anymore privately mine. I guess it's one of the sunk costs of this weblog thing.  I'm still figuring out this voice in my head, listening to its haphazard narrative of the world according to me. I'm still finding my bearings, discovering where I stand on issues. There are some entries heretofore that upon reexamination I have regretted ever posting; and I have resisted the colossal temptation of deleting them. There are also entries that I am perfectly content with. Those that have embodied all the churning emotions and ideas within me at the time. Just the same, being able to post all these adds a new layer of meaning to my journey. It has become one other outlet for me, in essence an  alter ego  who lives in a parallel universe, from which I can derive fulfillment (or at least relief), and hopefully become something from which others may derive whatever they can--humor, joy, motivation, case-in-points, advice, challenges, superiority, inferiority, intrigues, updates, gossip fodder, even--as my college friend Geraldine told me--an  "insight into how [my mind] can be dissected."  *sigh* The perils of having psych majors as friends! LOL  For all these, I give gratitude to everyone who has/had been a part of my life in each way, shape and form. To my parents, my brother and sister [both left handed--don't ask.], my aunt & uncle; to my intimate circles of friends--Mark my best friend who's now serving in the war, Drew who'll be entering a new career, Lester who'll be off to a new continent, Mike, Jeremy, Ryan; to my mentor Paul, Patrick, Peter, Francis, Mark Ohny; to Louise, Bambi, Chelat, Grace, Katch, Maharahnee, Maharlika, Ian, May Angela; to Carmela, Monica, Sab, Rain, Weng; to Chris, Gilles, Justin; to all those who have sauntered more intimately into and out of my life--you know who you are; to ancient friends, to new ones, to those I forgot to mention  «¡Ay de mi!»  --   cheers to us all  ; to Mrs. Perry Cabo and her 5th grade  Jottings  class; and to all those who underwent the trouble of sending me their reactions/comments/hate mail, notwithstanding my comments link having been shut down...I regret not being able to accommodate everything in my posts, but your own two centimes are invaluable nonetheless, and y'all are fantastic!! ¡Muah!  I'll continue to sail westward, to this fabled New World that holds many surprises in store for those who reach its shores. Who knows when I'll get there, if at all I do. But who cares really? The answer must be in the attempt to cross the high seas." And while I do, I'll continue to post whatever I feel may be personally important and attempt to find my true voice. I hope that through this, you'll find yours as well.    «Au Nouveau Monde!», cria le genois.

      I walk around, carrying a big shiny fire extinguisher. Put out this flame, put out that one, watch out for that fire lest it grow out of control. Life as a troubleshooter is gruelling. But just dive right into the turmoil, and keep believing that you will strike upon that elusive reason why things are how they are. Fortune's darlings are lavishly rewarded, on the condition of absolute submission.

      Beauty is in imagining, in building novelties from what you already know. Beauty is in courage, in attempting to make a difference in the face of acknowledged fear. Beauty is in unadulterated faith, in trusting without reservation in something greater than yourself. Beauty is in forgiveness, the prerogative of the truly powerful. Beauty is in your own imperfections, which allows room for complementarity, interdependence, and synergy. Beauty is in chaos, a more interesting alternative to the monotony of a perfect world. Beauty is in sorrow, that singular experience which validates your humanity. Beauty is in defeat, in picking yourself up and henceforth being the wiser for it. Beauty is in the unknown, the primordial motivator for you to uncover the truth. Beauty manifests itself in a whole lot more things than dare we expect to find it. It is a paradox, a puzzle, a thing abstract. Beauty is in knowing this, in craving more, in being intoxicated by it.

      I'm returning to forgotten pastimes and recreations--music, calligraphy, poetry, origami. I'm re-learning a language I've shelved for some time--Portuguese--and I thought French was hard. I'm reflecting on my neglected past from which I draw fresh insights into my daily existence. I'm discovering how, where and why I fit in this world. I'm making a conscious effort to live Life one day at a time: not to rush into and out of each day I've been given to live out. I strive to see both the tree and the forest so I can strike a prudent balance between the details and the big picture. I'm beginning to accept that I cannot possibly please everyone everytime. They will all have to wait for their turn, and if that inconveniences them, it is through no fault of mine anymore. I know that voices abound to give their own two cents on every matter--some in good faith, some not--and realize that the most important voice I should heed is my own. I am making peace with the way things are with me and adjust accordingly. I believe that my destiny and purpose are bigger than my own self and that I had best learn how to harness it properly for the greatest good. I am daily pleased at the little accretions to my admittedly inferior wisdom, comforted by the fact that all things I suffer myself to go through are never futile. I believe in vicarious learning, but that the mistakes you commit yourself have the more lasting effects. I believe that all the good--and bad--that you do comes around to pay you in full with accrued interest. I believe in a pluralistic society, not so much out of tolerance as out of a genuine appreciation of our vibrant and essentially human diversity. I believe that happiness is possible if we count ourselves worthy of it. Although it hasn't yet come in my life, I believe I'm getting there. And I'm not afraid to ask for the moon; it's but commensurate to what you'll get in return.

      My world is now; tomorrow doesn't exist for me.  Which doesn't say I live a hedonistic life. Quite the opposite. My world is now;  now  is what counts,  now  is when I can do the things I need to do. Tomorrow doesn't exist; tomorrow was never promised to anyone, and no one can claim tomorrow as theirs.  So I often find myself, against better judgment, attempting to do more things than what I can handle. Which is maladaptive.  Note to self: live life one day at a time. Be a little less demanding. Be a little less neurotic.  (...yeah, right...)  In the meantime, my world is now...and tomorrow...tomorrow doesn't exist for me.

      "Do you ever visit the pier?," asked Justin. Well, I haven't lately. I've been there a couple of years ago. It was late summer and the weather was gorgeous. "I've never really been to the California beaches a whole lot," he says.  What is it with the sea? There is something so irresistible about it. Something which cannot be explained in plain and simple terms.

      A lot of things are where I want them to be at the moment, and I feel a semblance of peace settling within me. I'm learning how to apply the brakes and observe the posted speed limit for life, which unravels itself at its own unhurried pace. It would be a shame if I couldn't appreciate that. It's odd how stuff turn out right when you relax your grip on them.  For my part, I've had to insist on some people that they loosen their grip on me as well. It's not entirely unfair, as I have been a little more obliging than I ought to be. I want to be inaccessible again; and never mind that I burn bridges indiscriminately, tragically confident, through the conviction of my own vanity, that the tab of rebuilding will be picked up by the other side. For although I know I will be proven wrong, it will be motivation enough for me to move on and reconfigure my valence, and I'll reach out when I do.  Until then, they had best content themselves with secondhand narratives of my personal reality... postcards without the obligatory "Wish You Were Here."

      Things are starting to fall into their proper places, and I feel vindicated at having stuck it out. Life is starting to catch up with me, and one by one my frustrations and doubts all seem to shrink away. I feel I'm being taken care of, by a higher being, by fortune, I'm not sure by whom or by what.  I was on several occasions asked by different people if I believed in predestination. I always said, no, that goes against the principle of free will and all the strings attached to it. Had I said no because it was the prudent, polite and proper thing to say? Perhaps. But privately, I believed--and still believe--otherwise.  Go where the wind blows, see where it takes you. You do what you do now...you interact with the people you've been granted to meet...you are who you are, what you are, why you are, how you are all for a reason... a reason you're not necessarily entitled to know.

      "Sometimes, no, a lot of times, I want so badly to make conversation with you, to try to rebuild the connection we once had. The more I got to know you the more I saw in you that evanescent, rare character, that certain  je ne sais quoi , that which convinced me that you're "The One."  "But along with knowing the good comes knowing, well, the not so good. I had my doubts. I made that very plain to you. Yet I was prepared to overlook your faults and dismiss my doubts. But you have to work on them too. Just because I am willing to disregard and dismiss them doesn't mean I'll be forever okay with it.  "So, yes, I would wait for you to catch up, that much I'm willing to do. But I'm not sure how long I can wait. The winds will blow, and when they do and your sails aren't ready still, well, they're not ready. And I've never been one to pass up a good strong easterly. That's how I got here, that's how I'll be gone.  "Take your time if you want to. That's your entitlement. But I cannot guarantee you my stay, and I dare not guarantee you anything. I can only say these things to you, in good faith, so you may be aware, so you may act wisely upon that which you now know. I've been aloof for good reason; take your cue from my silence. I've met you halfway, now it's your turn to approach."    (But these I never told.)

      I remember the autumn.  Early evening, clear starry skies, a crisp cool breeze, a favorite song on the radio, through one fragrant back road of a Valencian orange grove. Nothing but me, and my song, on this quiet stretch of my world. Ah, the little pleasures that more than made up for my misery.  I remember the autumn. I remember the smile.

      My trouble with quietude, the sort which comes when I tune out external noises, is that my internal demons emerge to the surface and quickly fill the void. They bring with them a hundred issues that have lain dormant and a hundred mistakes that I have tried to justify. I always stood firm on the position that there never was anything I regretted ever doing. Yet the time comes when we must come to terms with our past, and for my part, a past that had been so patched up with so many things on so many occasions to give the semblance that I got it all together. That the world has treated me right, as I deserve, for I never did anything so gravely wrong. Which is hardly the truth.  What is it so frightening and awful about failure? What does it matter if you can't achieve everything you were expected/supposed/implored to achieve? Could it be that you're running in the wrong race after all? Which, when I think about it, scares me more like naught else.  I will continue to compete, and I have no doubt that, me being who I am, my run will be spectacular. And that someday, if I win, when I win, I should be prepared to confront a new demon: how much would I have enjoyed the prize?

      We've laughed, we've cried, vacillated between extremes. Two lifetimes shared at our destiny's juncture. Now we stand somewhere in between, unsure of what we are to each other, unsure of who we are on our own. Why is it, when the one approaches, the other retreats? Afraid of letting go, yet unwilling to meet halfway? What are we? Who are we? Neither this one nor the other... should we just accept something in between?

      "I measured the skies, now the shadows I measure Skybound was the mind, Earthbound the body rests."   epitaph, Johannes Kepler   I had my first thought about death when I was four. It was of my grandmother. From what my  4-year old powers of observation and rationale could muster, I learned that old people died. That's it. They didn't die sooner or more often, they just died. I thought if she did, I'd be very sad indeed.  But we grow up, experience the world, and learn new stuff. Our outlooks eventually change. I learned that death isn't so much an event as it is a process. I learned that it takes a lifetime to die. We die a little everyday, of various causes--failure, distrust, miscommunication, loathing, disappointment, anger, even regret. We die of life's general unpleasantness. We die of ourselves.  Today, I'll allow myself to die a little more freely. I'll let the pieces fall to the ground. I'll resist the urge to pick them up. I'll let them rest there. And I'll be completely okay with it. We all die sometimes, and some die more entirely than others. Find your place in the spectrum.

      Wanna know the truth? I don't know how I can be won. I don't think I've ever been. Some have tried; they gave their best, but only got frustrated. I accepted their best, then I got frustrated. So they never lasted. With me, nothing ever does. Let me tell you this: when you do not know your own standards, refuse to settle where they lie, and much less recognize when they've been met, you never find contentment with anyone or in anything. And I take much offence when you say you're here to change that; when you see it as a problem to solve... when you treat it as a disease to cure. My behavior and attitude towards relationships may be self-defeating, but let me sort them out on my own terms. Let me take my time to grow and learn. You cannot erase my doubts for me. I think it's very condescending of you, and it will only serve to prejudice your cause. I just thought you had to know that.

      I never buried our past. Maybe I was holding out hope, hoping for something new. Maybe I was reluctant to let go, even if I won't admit it. Maybe I don't even want to find the closure that comes with it, afraid of dealing with a life less complex. My maybes are endless... changing with the seasons, each one never quite right.  Now the past comes to haunt me, with your resurrected voice that brings with it memories I wanted to forget that I have. A whisper in the dark, faint enough to not startle, but the whisper is there, I heard it through the haze, unmistakable and clear.  One more maybe that I'd like to entertain now, a new maybe from which you might find insight and draw your own closure: maybe, just maybe, it was not worth it.     The souls of the unburied might not pass the river that encircles the kingdom of death  But must wander in desolation, with no abiding place, no rest ever for their weariness.

      On the west 60 freeway, heading towards Los Angeles just out of Riverside city limits, one encounters a brownish-gray stone mastodon perched upon a steep rocky hill. It is an odd sight that a commuter on both sides of the 60 won't miss. "There used to be a theme park there," someone had told me. But as it went with a lot of things, the place got mismanaged and eventually forced to shut down. Now only the lone pachyderm stands there, a strange relic, forced to be extinct a second time.

      Fine. I admit it. I'm an   urlLink American Idol   junkie. :p  I saw their Hawaii auditions the other night. As with the show's previous season openers, this year's openers featured the judges' gruesome task of selecting who goes to Hollywood and who doesn't. Same old same old, I guess. Last season there was this guy who did a rendition of Madonna's "Like A Virgin." Totally gave me the creeps. This season there was this guy who...ehr...danced...(?)...[how does one describe it]...well lemme just say he did a very interesting gymnastic/acrobatic number that would surely earn him a spot in the traveling production  Cirque du Grotesque .  Well anyway. No more of that icky stuff. Off they go to Hollywood for a battery of elimination rounds. There will be lots of tears again, I bet. They say they've raised the bar this year. The Hollywood picks would have to perform better than last year's Magic 12 to earn them  a spot in the finals; and last year's finalist was an admirable batch! So that's a tall order. Last year I so wanted Trenyce to win. She just exuded this diva vibe. She didn't go on to win, everyone now knows that, and I wonder where she is now. Maybe Ruben ate her? Heck he must have eaten everyone who got voted off each week.  Going back much farther: Season One's Kelly Clarkson. I never really expected her to win. The other finalist had more stage presence than her and whipped up audience support spectacularly. But when Clarkson sang the designated make-or-break song...oh God...her vibratto...her pitch...her diction...her timing and falsetto...everything was executed perfectly. Masterful. Wow. Her rendition still haunts me everytime I listen to it.  If any of the finalists this Third Season can top that, I'd be truly truly amazed.

      I'm back to obsessing on my MP3s again. This time it's Peggy Lee's  Sweet Happy Life  that's on track repeat in my player. It's such a nice song. A nice break from the other "misery" songs I've been listening to lately. So yeah, I can pull my sorry self out of my own disconsolation whenever I want to. (Note to self: keyword is   want  .) Heck, it's what I've been trained to do...though I'm not as productive when I'm "happy" as when I'm in a dour mood. Oh well, it's a fair tradeoff. Heyyy, ya know what would complete the "happy" sensory experience? Clinique's  Happy  for men. Jaja. Maybe I should spend the day someplace nice while I'm on a natural high...~thinking~thinking~thinking~... the beach?

      I was given a very nice gift last Christmas. A calligraphy set. So I took to practicing my Italic hand again. It's been years since I held my last pen and cleaned my last nib. But two pages down and it's all coming back. I used to write quite beautifully, if I may say so. I had even developed my own distinctive, intricate monogram, like how any proper gentleman should. This is an unusual feat, considering I'm left handed, for left handed people are usually clumsy with pens.  It's comforting to have a pen in my hand once more. It's comforting to create something beautiful just for the sake of creating it. There's a wonderful sense of accomplishment in each line and each page that I successfully finish. All the swirls, straight lines and serifs combining harmoniously. It feels as though I'm creating something sacred and divine, austerity exuding from the concomitant regularity and fluidity of the characters.  I used to be big with handwritten correspondences. With my intimate friends, every birthday, every milestone, every moment of relative importance was a cause for me to write them a note if just to say "Carlo here, I remembered, hope you're doing fine." And I liked that. Being able to impart something personal of yourself. Being able to say that you care not just through words but through deeds. Coz it's easy to just log on to a computer and type away an email. But the physicality of a personally handwritten correspondence entails more thoughtfulness and care. With my renewed hobby, maybe I'll take that up again. My little way of celebrating beauty and being a whole lot more thoughtful.

      Our song plays on the radio. It evokes memories of a time when everything was just so right. We didn't worry so much about our differences. We didn't worry so much about the obstacles in our path. We didn't worry so much about the future. We had our dreams which we were determined to achieve. We had our plans which we were determined to carry out. But reality eventually crept in, and we found our differences scrutinized under the harsh light of day. The obstacles were larger than we expected and the future was irresolute. We realized that our bond wasn't strong enough, and we, along with our dreams and plans, were no more.  Our song plays on the radio. It conjures up memories of a past, our past, that I will not part with. Memories that will always remind me of how love became possible, however one's fortress seemed impregnable, however contrarily I once believed. These are just about everything that I have of you these days, and I will not be denied of them.  Our song plays on the radio. It elicits a vision of you, and along with it, a ray of light that enables me to see the real you. This "you" that is good and giving and thoughtful and kind. This "you" that is steadfast and zealous and unshakable and will stand by your beliefs. I finally see myself in you; and armed with a new wisdom that comes with accrued experiences, our differences don't anymore seem to loom as large as they once did.  Our song plays on the radio. It reminds me of your perseverance. It reminds me that you are stronger than you appear to be. It reminds me that you, despite everything, are still there for me. The song evolves into something else. It becomes our personal truth conveniently parceled into stanzas and refrains and bridges and whatnot. It elicits a very distinct emotion that I couldn't even begin to justify with words. And as the song now draws to a close, allow me to hope once more that ours can begin anew.

      Sounds of samba emanate from another room:     the singer's swarthy voice,    the imperfect syncopations of a perfectly plucked guitar,    the interjections of an obligatory saxophone.  It elegizes a longing, a gaze into the distance-- over there! --where you saw the sun set. It is a desire to reconcile a world of aspirations with a world that is. It is the aftertaste of unrealized potentials. It is that feeling everytime you catch yourself asking,  "Is this all there is to it?"   Life is one exquisite samba number. Dominated by minor keys, always flat by one step. It is at once lacking and complete, a thing of paradoxical beauty.  So just close your eyes.  Now let out a sigh.  And enjoy the samba.

       On the westbound 10Fwy:   ·Vincent Av. 1¾ mi  ·Vincent Av. 1 mi  ·Vincent Av. ½ mi  ·Vincent Av. ¼ mi  ·Vincent Av. Exit.   I didn't take my exit.  Perhaps half-intentionally. I kept on driving all the way to downtown Los Angeles some twenty or so miles west. I didn't have one good reason to do this. Miss my appointment and waste gas...no one does that. Yet I did. I just felt I had to. Maybe I needed a physical analogy to where I am in my life right now. Something tangible I can catalogue into my personal experiences.  I missed my exit today. Just like how I've missed a lot of exits in the past. It took me to places I never planned on going. I was sure of my course but not my destination. Was I looking for some catharsis today? Maybe. Wow. Catharsis. Something I haven't encountered since my psych undergrad days. Did I find it today? I felt I did. And by this one unexplained act, I knew that I could read my map again, without confusion, without ambivalence.

      Hmm.  Right now I'm struggling to wring out every ounce of  ~meaning~  from that singular line.  If at all there is one. If I haven't deluded myself.  Desperate to make sense of everything that is-- and isn't--  ~happening~  in my life.  My porcelain sky is caving in on  me,  and there's nothing I can do about it.  We try our best Which is never enough And is never an excuse.  I close my eyes  and listen...  (..listens..)  ...as the pieces shatter. Dare I open my eyes anew?  Everything is starting to sink in. My limbs are now numb.  **sigh**  Never regret.  Ne jamais regretter.  Malgré que nous sommes prêsque vaincus.

      Well, Green Eyes, I guess this is it. The proverbial end of the road. Our end of the road. I never anticipated to see this day, but I guess we all are entitled to be naïve once in a while. Remember what you told me about your Januaries? Never did I imagine it would come true this time. Not with us. There's a lot more we haven't achieved together, I know, but be proud of those that we have. The hurt, the pain, the anger, the blame--all very legitimate reactions, but we should learn to let go of them. I have started to, you should too. It's liberating that way.  I really thought I had much more than these to say. I won't try to say more than I ought to this time. Sometimes answers can be found in what is left unsaid. You know that's how it works with me. Do not weep too long for me, Green Eyes. Take care of yourself. Stay hydrated and remember to put on your sunscreen especially on your early shifts. Keep that menu we *borrowed* from Carino's--it's got their phone number and I think they also cater to private parties. You can also keep the CD. Remember what I've always told you: dream big, aim high, love more. You'll always be precious to me.  With much affection, CF.

      Dorothy's cats lounge regally in our yard. It's not their turf, really, for Dorothy being our neighbor doesn't have much of a yard for her cats to play in. These cats are afternoon regulars here, taking advantage of the green, geometrically mowed grass to lounge on. They must think they're in paradise. God knows what misfortune their feline brethren are suffering back east. Temperatures in the teens, and that doesn't even take wind chill into account. One brief pass outside is enough to make them five lives lighter. And only today did Peter, a friend who now lives in New York, have some wonderful news about it. "We're having a heatwave," he remarks. "28F!" Yup, it's balmy compared previous days. So yeah one could think that we really live in Paradise out here in the west. Beautiful weather, beautiful people, beautiful places to go to. And lo, beautiful cats adorning our yard.  But this isn't paradise for me. Paradise is a place where the rains are a quotidian fixture. Paradise is a place where the sun hides behind the grays. It is a place where people wear their black turtlenecks and have their black umbrellas handy. Or perhaps paradise is a place deep within the convolutions of my mind, a place I retreat to every now and then. Amidst the cold and gloom, feelings are incubated, words are formed, ideas are born. Ideas that rarely agree with the rest of the world. But who cares, really? When you come to think of it, paradise, like all else, is a subjective thing. The cats can have their sunny day in their park, and I'll have my gloomy day in my mind.

      Just coz I try to be a good role model doesn't mean I won't make bad choices.  Just coz I'm here to support you all the way doesn't mean I don't need some support myself.  Just coz I'm diligent at my work doesn't mean you can overwork me to the ground.  Just coz I keep secrets tightly guarded doesn't mean you can burden me with lots of yours.  Just coz I always give excellent advice doesn't mean you'll get one anytime you fancy asking.  Just coz I'm your lifeline to sanity doesn't mean you couldn't possibly drive me crazy.  Just coz I give you my time to help solve your problems doesn't mean I don't have my own to solve.  Just coz I'm zealously tidy in all things doesn't mean I'd gladly clean up your mess.  Just coz I'm great with kids doesn't mean I'm willing to babysit yours.  Just coz I'm generous doesn't mean I don't run out of resources.  Just coz I'm just a phone call away doesn't mean I'll always entertain you.  Just coz I'm understanding doesn't mean you can abuse my good nature.  Just coz I don't get tired doesn't mean I won't tire of you.  Just coz we're inextricably entwined doesn't mean I wouldn't sever our ties.  I may be good. I may be kind.  I may  be the most wonderful, compassionate, unselfish, non-judgmental person you'll ever come across.  You know me more than I'd suffer anyone else to, so I'd have you know this as well: It doesn't follow I couldn't be otherwise.

      We live our lives in tragedy, through every single day, an existence that never fails to produce a fresh batch of misery. Heartaches to pile up, lost opportunities to regret, momentary joys to pine for. We endure our pain, without which happiness can never be recognized, and sometimes wallow in our pain, for in such we discover our humanity.  Pain reminds us to sort out our messy lives and pay a little more attention to the ones that truly matter.  Pain sensitizes us and magnifies life around us, forcing us to accommodate a bigger picture into our perspective, to listen more closely to the tiny voices once left unheard. Pain challenges us to dream a little bigger, to aim a little higher, to do a little better, to love a little more.  Pain occasions us, despite ourselves, to transcend into something greater.

      "You can't be serious! Christ, have you seen what's out there?" asked my friend Gilles, referring to his competition, as he frantically searched for his lighter. "Sure I have. And I think you got something better." I honestly believed this as much as he didn't. "I wouldn't say it if I didn't think so. You know that."  "Nonetheless...I wouldn't have some editor rake through my work! Besides, my work is for few and few alone to know."  "See here, if you only spent half as much time organizing your work into something coherent and fit for public consumption than you do stuffing your face with one cigarette after another...you'd be well on your way to.." "Fame?!", Gilles interjected. "Fame is poison. We've been through this a thousand times, and a thousand times more you'll get this same answer... I WON'T PUBLISH! "  Gilles could get so impassioned at times, especially when it concerns the delicate issue of his works. I honestly haven't seen him this upset before. He was quivering.  "I'd kill to have half the talent that you got. All I'm saying is that it's a shame to keep it to a few. A public disservice, even."  Gilles lights up another stick no sooner than he'd tossed out the one before it. "You're starting to annoy me."  There's no persuading him, that I know too well. But it'll give him something to think about, one other nagging thought to add to the pile. He's big on thinking about things. And I'll let him have the last word for now.

This country needs a president who knows how to prioritize, who has sensible foresight, who will tackle the really important issues while they can still be overhauled. Social security. Education. Employment. Welfare reform. The rising cost of healthcare. Let's send him once and for all off his merry way, on a one way ticket to space.

       I am afraid you will suppose that a midwinter moon hath taken large possession of my brains, but you must needs take things as they come to my mind, though order be left behind.   I am tired. I have driven all over the county all day. Enough miles to get me from LA all the way to Ensenada. I have had little sleep. I was half-dozing in the middle of the midday and evening rush hours. I was exhausted beyond description. But I also had two job interviews to go to, and I had to be perky and sharp and amiable and must appear to know what I'm talking about. Being the consummate actor that I am, I think I pulled it off nicely. But one cannot possibly be acting out happiness everytime. That can be draining.  And then I get a call. " I might be leaving by month's end, " Mark says.  Everything was suspended in mid-air. This  is  the phone call I've been dreading to get for months.  Ugh. I am emotionally drained.

      My best friend just got his order for army deployment today. He'll be leaving by the end of January. First stop, Washington state; then it's Germany, and from there either to Afghanistan or Kosovo or Iraq. It hasn't yet sunk in my mind. You see this kind of stuff on television everyday, but you hoped it wouldn't happen to you, how someone so close to you will be engaged in a war half a world away. For a moment, time stops, noises fade, your vision blurs... it has become personal. Twelve to eighteen months away from home....

It was theoretically tedious, but it didn't feel that way in practice. Now I'm left with time in my hands...what to do next, what to do next...I still haven't found that freakin piece of paper, and it will no doubt show up when its importance had long expired. Wtf, what's this, a Yahoo Messenger chatter logging in and out like crazy. NgrRRRR!!! It's driving me mad. Time to delete another friend from the list!! ~heh~  Uhm okay, the BlogSpeak comments link had worked only intermittently the whole day...what's up with that?

      Green Eyes looks at me knowingly. Green Eyes sees what most could not. Green Eyes is privy to a world whereinto few are admitted. Green Eyes sees through me, a place through my eyes, a place beyond me, a place almost within my reach. Green Eyes looks on intently, too intently that it bothers me what that piercing glance might capture, what those green green eyes might see. The sacred intimate imperfections of my soul are mine and mine alone to know. Green Eyes must know that, lest I ask Green Eyes to let me go.  Voici, vite, est ton cœur de retour.

      Another day online, another hoax. Here's how to tell the true from the false warnings: if the "Advisory" comes directly from the "Site" (Yahoo, Friendster, etc), it probably is authentic. If it got to you by word of mouth, it probably isn't true. (Oh, and misspelled words are red flags too.) The sad thing is, smart people fall prey to this forwarding scam! Now that we know better, let us please stop clogging the system.

       «fourth entry on a day I'd like to forget»   I lost something today. A piece of paper containing a phone number I was supposed to call. Nothing significant, really, and there would have been no consequence had I forgone to call the guy. But it kills me, because I rarely rarely (and I mean)   rarely lose anything  . The last item I lost was a Reading and Comprehension notebook in third grade. Ngrrrr, it really really kills me. Maybe it was my subconscious taking over and acting on my behalf. " Nothing significant " = " lose it ". Still. I hoped it consulted me first before making any desicions. Where the f*ck did I put that friggin piece of paper?!?

      Okay, the idea dawned on me right after posting the previous entry. Two entries down, I was pondering on how to deal with something that falls short of what it's expected to be. By the same token, there are those which surpass expectations, and I think that balances out the equation. I'm just thinking out loud here. It came to me when I was going through the B&B script. So there. My two centimes. Now if only Blogspeak would be so kind at maintaining the comments link up and running  properly , I would be glad to hear out your two centimes too.

      " Once upon a time, in a faraway land, a young prince lived in a shining castle.  Although he had everything his heart desired, the prince was spoiled, selfish, and unkind.  But then, one winter's night, an old beggar woman came to the castle and offered him a single rose in return for shelter from the bitter cold. Repulsed by her haggard appearance, the prince sneered at the gift and turned the old woman away, but she warned him not to be deceived by appearances, for beauty is found within. And when he dismissed her again, the old woman's ugliness melted away to reveal a beautiful enchantress. The prince tried to apologize, but it was too late, for she had seen that there was no love in his heart, and as punishment, she transformed him into a hideous beast, and placed a powerful spell on the castle, and all who lived there. Ashamed of his monstrous form, the beast concealed himself inside his castle, with a magic mirror as his only window to the outside world.  The rose she had offered was truly an enchanted rose, which would bloom until his twenty-first year.  If he could learn to love another, and earn her love in return by the time the last petal fell, then the spell would be broken.  If not, he would be doomed to remain a beast for all time.  As the years passed, he fell into despair, and lost all hope, for who could ever learn to love a  urlLink beast ? "  Sometimes we could be so obsessive!

      How do you deal when you find out that something isn't what it's cracked up to be? When you discover, it ain't all that? A bag of hot air. Phony, pretentious, nothing but lies. Should you gloat at not being so blinded any longer? Do you spread the word? Do you kill the suspense? Or let others discover it for themselves, in their own time, at their own convenience? How do you deal with that?

      Went to see the last installment of The Lord of the Rings tonight (last night, technically). I'm not really a fan. But my ticket was free, so what the hey... better see a movie than spend a crummy night at home. The film was...oh what's the word... unimpressive . Yes, the special effects were great, but once...twice...three times...I wanted to discover something beyond just special effects. Something improved upon from the first and second installments. One grows wont to expect this as the trilogy progresses, and everything was inundated with too much fluff. If you want eye (and ear) candy, this movie is for you. Otherwise, suffer your crummy night at home.

      What do I want?  I want to enjoy my family and friends. I want good health. I want a cat. I want to be able to pursue my dreams. I want to go to places I planned on going to. I want to be able to do the things that others say I couldn't do. I want to prove them wrong. I want to pave the way for others. I want to be good, I want to be strong. Not only for myself but for the ones that matter to me. I want them to be proud of me as much as I am proud of them. I want them to know that. I want to be able to continue remembering everyone's birthdays. That one matters, you know, for sometimes almost everyone forgets-- and my remembering could have made all the difference . I want to be able to read the books I've shelved over the years. I want to go to Barcelona and speak fluent Catalan. I want to be able to mix drinks as expertly as my best friend does. I want to remember everyone's little and big kindnesses. I want to be able to pay them back. I want to be able to hug my all friends, my acquaintances, my family, even those whom I've had a falling out with. They have molded me into what I am now. They equally deserve the credit (and the blame ~hahah~). I want to make a difference, little ones and big ones, every single day that I've been given to live out. I want to have good counsel and be wealthy in all aspects--material, spiritual, social, emotional--so I can be efficiently provident. And in the end, this for me shall suffice: that I, having been given this much, had given back something more.  **Here's the    urlLink other list   of what I want. Heheh.**

      I grew up in a house filled with music. My father was at one time a composer, commissioned by a major pop production company. He had composed several songs that became popular well before my time. He never seriously made a living out of it, choosing instead to devote his time and talent as an executive to a semiconductor MNE. But once you have music in your heart, which he does, it never goes away. I grew up listening to him strum his guitar. I watched him tinker his fancy synthesizers. My fondest memories were hearing him spontaneously play Antonio Carlos Jobim's   urlLink Vou Te Contar  , re-titled   Wave   in its English version, on the keyboards.  Everywhere around the house we were reminded of how music plays so large a part in our lives. We had two working phonographs, one large component with three-foot-high speakers, and countless cassette players of all shapes and sizes scattered around. We had two keyboards, one piano, several guitars, and I suspect my pitch pipe is still within the house, lost somewhere in one of the storage boxes.  It was a magical place to grow up in, and I and my sister made full use of what we found. We listened to Porgy & Bess, the Flight of the Bumblebee, Connie Francis songs, the Sound of Music soundtrack, all in vinyl. We were purists early on. Then we learned how to custom-make our own cassette tapes from these. And Disney movies, especially the ones with song, hardly ever left the the VCR.  I've tried my hand at music when I was little. My mum enlisted a piano teacher for my instructions. I never really had the patience to play it the classical (or traditional...?) way, and it was right about the time my instructor pulled out the "Theme from Voltes V" music sheet that I freaked out. I decided that piano wasn't for me. No more lessons. (I have, however, re-composed the entire Voltes V score and saved it as a ring tone in my phone. In three movements.)  We've since grown up and had more important things to attend to. Music takes a back seat when you want to get into nice colleges, when you prioritize official and personal responsibilities, when you yearn for professional growth. But music is still tucked neatly in my heart, and more so in my sister's (who plays three instruments and now also composes). Music never went away. There's never an emotion, a thought, a desire or frustration or expectation, that hasn't already been translated into music. It's what we turn to when we need empathy.   Vou te contar, os olhos já não podem ver, Coisas que só o coração pode entender. .. ...Let me tell you what the eyes cannot see, things that only the heart can understand.

      When I start to get comfortable with someone, when I start to know their personal stories, that's my cue to move on. I hesitate on investing myself, cor et anima, having learned how temporary everything in this world is. People come and go, however trite that sounds. If I start to get lonely and start missing them, and I eventually do, I can at least say to myself that it was out of my own volition. I controlled fate and never allowed her to play cruel tricks on me. Call it my personal fault...but that's what works for me.  Last night, I and a couple of friends got together. We had a send-off gathering for another friend relocating to another state. We traded stories and cracked jokes and laughed at our silly and good times until the wee hours. Memories relived for our friend to take with him. Towards the end, he did some sort of a peroration, an account of a chapter in his life that will soon be coming to a close. He was thankful for all of his blessings and to all of his friends. It was poignant.  It got me thinking. It wasn't only him who's turning a new leaf. Three among the group are also giving up their shared flat and moving on to their own places within days. My best friend is on standby for army deployment. Even I will have to be going away in a few months. In a way, the gathering's significance was magnified in my mind.  Fate, it seems, played a trick on me this time. Hindsight comes into play, and I felt dumb at not having paid attention to the signs. I have started to invest myself, uncertain if dividends will ever drizzle on me. But I'll take away whatever I can.

      During the holidays, a very good college friend of mine came by Los Angeles to visit her family. She flew in from out of the country, out on holiday break from law school. We had talks of meeting up during her stay. We exchanged personal stories. We kept each other updated about our other friends. We couldn't wait to see each other.  The holidays came and went quickly and we both had our own schedules to keep. Sadly, our plans of meeting up, having coffee, and me helping her pack the "pasalubong" on her way back home never materialized. We never got past talking on the phone and greeting each other during Christmas and New Year's days.  It would have been wonderfully surreal to see her. To see someone who comes from a nicer time in your life, where all things were simple and the future seemed so certain and everything was very well taken care of. I was desperate to relive that feeling, especially here, especially now.  I was desperate to open the floodgates of my cherished memories. I needed to feel that I could be happy once again. Not faked happiness, but happiness that's so true and real that you start to have an out of body experience.  I am still so very much attached to my past. Sometimes I suspect having feelings of regret at how I have changed the course of my life so drastically. I was never meant to be here. I was destined for something else. I never planned to sail away and leave my berth for good. The sea was turbulent, and I didn't think I was ready.  Yet leaving land has been a spiritual thing for me. I forced myself to let go of the familiar, the stable and the nurturing. I found myself suddenly grappling to come up with some sense of closure. I embarked on a new journey, my fate left entirely to the mercy of the gods.  In a way, each new year is a kind of sailing off. You learn to let go of some people in your life and usher in new ones. You learn to not expect constancy. The experiences gained, the lessons learned, the little successes and stumbling blocks and whatnot of the past year all spread out before you. Pick out the ones to bring along, and hope to be a little wiser at the end of each day.

      Carlo is never completely satisfied with himself. There's more to accomplish, there's more to achieve, there's more to improve upon. It can get pretty annoying, really. He likes to test his limits, and it hasn't always worked to his advantage. But he insists that one never knows what he'll catch if he doesn't cast his line farther and farther out each time. One is just never certain what might be out there lurking in the depths.   Carlo characteristically ventures out to uncharted waters, and he's been wonderfully surprised each time. A British writer, whose aphorism Carlo now remembers more than her name, once remarked "Never regret. If it's good, it's wonderful; if it's bad, it's experience." It's pocket wisdom Carlo turns to every single time. The world in all its empirical manifestations and imponderable abstractions is an immensely wonderful place that no words can begin to describe. It challenges Carlo. And knowing that he cannot contain it entirely within the catalogue of his personal experiences only makes the world infinitely interesting for him. He breathes it all in as much as he could.    " To the New World! "  cried  urlLink the Genoese . That's where Carlo will go, wherever that may be.

      If Life were a duet, I sing it in the second voice. I cannot content myself with just going with the flow, doing what everyone else and his brother are doing. It betrays my character, for I know I can offer much, and offer much I do. I want to add something of value, to leave an unmistakable mark of my being, and I do it with sure timbre, deliberate timing, and arresting vibratto. Life in monotone is simply offensive, the one great tragedy of living. I've seen some do fantastic counterpoints, and some who, perhaps carrying a lot of baggage that holds them back, perform a rather uninspiring rendition. They fall short of wonderful. You just have got to let go of it all. Dare you sing in my voice too?

      Last Tuesday, I saw the sea again. I haven't been to the sea in such a long time that I had nearly forgotten how beautiful it is. We had somewhat clear skies last Tuesday (it's been raining here for over a week now), and it was fantastic to see the sea glisten under a mid-afternoon sun. It's humbling, really, when you begin to think about it. You worry constantly about the little things, but what are all your worries compared to the magnificence that is around you? It more than compensates for the trifling inconveniences we encounter everyday.  Starting Monday, I'll be seeing more of the sea. It will be good for me.

      "Give me solitude," so said I when pressed for what I want. "...Solitude."  I need to be alone. I need to think. I want my thoughts to wander far and search for answers. I'm stuck in a rut, and only I can pull myself out. But I cannot do it if you don't stop jabbering. I'll reach out to you when I do, but for now, give me solitude.

          A Felicidade    Tristeza não tem fim, felicidade sim.  A felicidade é como a gota de orvalho numa pétala de flor Brilha tranquila depois de leve oscila e cai como uma lágrima de amor. A felicidade do pobre parece a grande ilusão do carnaval A gente trabalha o ano inteiro por um momento de sonho Pra fazer a fantasia  de rei ou de pirata ou jardineira pra tudo se acabar na quarta feira.  Tristeza não tem fim, felicidade sim.  A felicidade é como a pluma que o vento vai levando pelo ar  Voa tão leve mas tem a vida breve precisa que haja vento sem parar. A minha felicidade está sonhando nos olhos da minha namorada  É como esta noite passando, passando em busca da madrugada Falem baixo, por favor prá que ela acorde alegre como o dia oferecendo beijos de amor  Tristeza não tem fim, felicidade sim...    ~Happy Mardi Gras!~

      Yes, amazing. There's simply no other word for it.  I thought that when I bid them goodbye, yet another one of my goodbyes, it won't affect me. Life goes on, so don't let's now stop to pay attention to the pain of parting. I thought that time has made me a tough one; I thought that I wouldn't be affected. And yet I am. This present poignancy crosses its threshold and it becomes an undeniable truth.  I am so used to leaving. People, places, pets, everything I guess. But I never get used to the rituals of farewells. Maybe that's why I'd rather leave unannounced, "taking the French leave" as it's called. And I have quite built up a notoriety for it. For I want to spare everyone these rituals. I want to spare everyone these awkward emotions. When I leave, I always want to do so preemptively, and I'll have none of your  despedidas . And the customary two week's notice? It just ain't my thing.  This sadness I now feel leaves me quite amazed. Amazed at the fact that I, whose life has been a catalogue of departures, still feel this way everytime I leave. Amazed that it never gets easy, amazed that I never get used to it. And yet it is a constant source of contentment, for it reaffirms my own appropriately imperfect humanity, and validates the significance of all that I go to, go through, and go with in life.

      Tonight, I started divesting myself of things I accumulated these past few years. Documents, letters, photos, memos, cards and souvenirs. Things that were at one time useful but now serve only as a remembrance of a venturesome past. Tonight's some sort of a symbolic liberation for me, which I need in order face a new day and sail a whole nother course.  Bittersweet change. Hmm. This is what I live for.

      Rainy Saturday afternoon. Everyone has gone out, leaving me home alone for the better part of the day. It used to be so different from this. I, the consummate partygoer; I, who had perfect attendance; I, who was to be found at this club here, at that bar there, at  friends' and relatives' parties. But today  I  have got nowhere to go. It was rainy anyway, this latest winter storm having been forecasted to last until Monday. No point of getting my hide and habit all wet and cold now.  So I rummaged through our tapes and DVDs, hoping to find something interesting to watch, catch up on any movies, and while my time away. Found a copy of the Voltes V series I got from a friend. Watched a couple of episodes until I started zoning out. Switched shows...ooh, Bend It Like Beckham...haven't seen that. It turned out to be a good film; I should have seen it in a movie theatre instead.  Still bored, though, so I went through my music. I got a lot of them that I haven't listened to in a long time. Flamenco, medieval, house, Broadway, soundtracks, and bingo...a copy of Puccini's "Turandot," recorded live from Milan in 1964. And then..."Nessun dorma" came up. I just couldn't resist belting out one rendition of it myself. Or twelve. I kinda lost track. But the important thing was that  I  found myself singing again. I was flexing my dormant chords, reprising my vibratto. And for a moment, I was in  the zone .  Is a bird happy when it sings? Or does it sing because it's happy? Perhaps one feeds off of the other. Was it because I was doing something I immensely enjoyed in the past? Or was it the words that have become so personal and definitive of where I am? I suspect that it's both.   All'alba vincerò! Vincerò, vincerò!

      She sits alone at a table for two, this elderly Hispanic woman, quietly supping by candlelight. One can tell that she is a refined lady--from her punctiliously coiffed shoulder-length white hair, to her elegant but conservatively subdued evening dress, and her careful gestures and polished manners. All these combining to command from everyone the respect and reverence commensurate to her personal dignity. The woman had dressed for the occasion, on this Valentine's evening. And she was by herself. This last fact was enough to unfortunately divert my curious attention from my date to the old woman, floating here and there and here again, never entirely devoted to either place.  In the course of the evening, questions began popping in my head.  Where must her husband have been? Was she even married at all?  I was sure she was unaccompanied when she came in, when she was seated, when she ordered, indeed the whole time she was in the  ristorante .  Why had she gone out dateless on this particular evening?  She certainly was, at least to me, a conspicuous sight. I would have been painfully conscious about it had I been in her place. But I guess she didn't care what other people thought. After all, she  was  here. For all I know, this old woman must have been honoring a Valentine tradition with a now-gone beloved. And most certainly, I was never meant to know.  The sight of this old woman on Valentine's evening--how the soft candlelight illuminated her austere face; how she, with indifference, defied popular expectations of not being out  and  alone on this night; how she did not allow inevitable circumstances (or so I can only surmise) to hinder her enjoyment--it was enough to evoke in me how some things endure for everyone. It's different things for different people, but we all have some things that endure in our lives. Those things that matter to us. And how we validate them through our devotion.  The old woman gets up and prepares to leave just as I and my date were finishing our dinner. As she walks out of the  ristorante , I take one final mental snapshot of her through the corner of my eye. I file her image into my catalogue of personal experiences-- "La vecchia da Portofino, 14Feb2004" --and along with it, certain abstractions that I can pull up and contemplate whenever I need to.    **This blog in no way endorses  Portofino , located at 651 W Whittier Blvd. La Habra, CA 90631 Tel: (714)-680-3311. But if you find yourself in the said  ristorante , which is excellent by the way, you should try their  melanzane parmigiana ripiene , a breaded eggplant dish with garlic, Caciovallo cheese, tomato, capers and oregano.

      I just saw my first hummingbird of the year today, hovering about the pomegranate bush in the backyard. It's a sure sign that, here in the land of eternal sunshine, spring has (nearly) arrived. I guess I should start with my spring cleaning soon. Then again, there's not much for me to discard this year anyway. Coz unlike my kinfolk, I am not a pack rat. Not a physical pack rat, that is. And I wish I could say the same for the rest of my life. But however we wish to discard seemingly worthless chunks of our lives, we can only at best recycle them into something functional or at least something ornamental, if we are so inclined to the task.  Life doesn't come with a Big Eraser , so goes the cliché. You cannot repudiate your past; you can only move on.   Lenten is come with love to toune, With blosmen and with briddes roune, That all this blisse bringeth.   Spring has come with love among us, With flowers and with the song of birds, That brings all this happiness.

      Gesu! I'm turning into a manic-depressive! I was quite in low spirits last night; now here I am elated at some unknown thing, suddenly and inexplicably euphoric. I suddenly feel alive... ALIVE!  I feel the blood rushing through my entire body. Can one be called crazy when he smiles at nothing? Maybe. DSM-IV would probably have something on this. Hah. My vacillating moods are exhausting me. I wonder how long this episode will last...probably not more than a couple of hours. Hope I find something to do to channel this sudden burst of this mysterious rapture.

      How quickly do people offer you their opinions on where you went wrong in your life and how you could have made better choices. Forgetting, quite tragically, that they only do so with the added benefit of their hindsight, and that they weren't the ones to personally suffer your predicament. They really mean good, and even you know it deep down, only they don't realize how self-righteous they could inadvertently sound. I was never one to dismiss a sound opinion and a good piece of advice; but I get annoyed, as I take would anyone, when, unsolicited, these opinions and advice are constantly held up to your face. So there.  *sigh*  These days I simply want to slip into an emotional coma. To fall into a really good depression. To be alone for a little while. To not have to listen to other people's opinions. I want to take a peek at the edge of the earth, to jump, and to see how far down it goes. I want to be embraced by darkness. To not care for anything. To shed all traces of a life that finds itself someplace you didn't want it to, a consequence of all the things good and bad and blah. I want to wallow in nothingness. To feel this nothingness, this empty space. To hear nothing but my own beating heart. To not be obliged to face another day. To not force myself to smile,to laugh, to get out of bed and share in the goodness of living. I want to be able to pause as long as it takes for me to come around. And to at last reinvent myself--again--and rise from the ashes. To be the same person fundamentally, without the baggage of an overly felt, overly analyzed, overly experienced past.  So stop the world, I wanna get off. But maybe after I do the dishes.

      After what seemed like an eternity, there was actually one good show that turned up on television tonight. PBS started airing a 2-part, 5-hour documentary on  urlLink the Medicis  of Renaissance Europe. I have never been one to pass up on exceptional television, especially historical documentaries. Like the one PBS did on Napoleon. Anyway. The Medicis are an interesting bunch. Never quite the nobility, the Medicis managed to wriggle their way into European aristocracies, monarchies, even the papacy itself. They were the original Friendsters, underscoring the importance of their networks and connectedness to wrestle influence and power to their side, with loyalty being the singular principle by which they have catapulted themselves to divine heights. They were generous patrons of the arts as well. Without them, the world wouldn't have probably known its Brunelleschi, its Boticelli, its Michelangelo and its da Vinci, the way it does today. Part Two airs next week. It's the more interesting part, and I can't wait. Until then, I'll content myself with what passes for *television* these days. ~ sigh ~  urlLink

      And in the end, what does it really matter? To have lived, to have loved, to have lost and gained and brought home the bacon. To have laughed, to have cried, to have felt a little hope and just enjoyed the moment. To have been kind, to have been cruel, to have been acquiescent to the point of perfected indifference. To have sung, to have danced, to have delivered your life's soliloquy on a stage that had never been entirely yours. To have been vanquished, to have been triumphant, to have been wretched and divine all at once just to prove your point. To have made good on some of your promises, to have defaulted on others, to have redeemed yourself and crucified your soul. To be remembered, to be forgotten, to have flowers brought to your grave and a prayer uttered for your eternal repose. For in the end, what does it really matter? Whether you've been the Queen of Castile or the Harlot of Seville, we all are just migrants through time and space and consciousness, nothing more than a trifling handful of dust.

      I promise to be a little nicer and a little less uptight. I promise to be a little less obsessive-compulsive. I promise to be a little less anxious if we are ever late for anything. I promise we'll go skydiving. And scuba diving. And rock climbing. Whatever you want to do, wherever you want to go. I even promise to visit Argentina with you. Will you come and visit France with me too? I promise to let you have a dog. I promise we'll take a walk, barefoot, by the shore, as often as we like. I promise to let you teach me how to cook. As long as you eat it and say "Good job, Carlo." With conviction.  I promise these, and perhaps much more.  If I make it to "40."

      There's so much I want to tell you, you who've earned your right to know. You see deep into me, but not deep enough to fully understand why I am the way I am. Perhaps a consequence of spending too little time together. I want to show you, but one thing holds me back every time. The reason being, I do not want to burden you with my own troubles. That would be enormously unfair. It is why there is no "us" right now. I know the question that you ask, not by the words that you utter, but by the tone of your voice, by the way you hold my hand, by the sadness I see in your eyes. That question to which no answer is forthcoming. We do things in our own time, and I reckon that making you privy to every single thing isn't appropriate for now. But just let me fight my own battles, resolve my own issues, and hold my distance for a while. Should you decide that I'm not worth the wait, I wouldn't hold it against you; for neither would I wait for me too. Always with the same affection, CF.

      And all of a sudden, I am overcome with tremendous sorrow. For all of my sins, for all of my shortcomings, for all the good things that I have let go of. Such tremendous sorrow that it borders on grief. I have never been an emotional person, having always turned instead to thinking things through. Everything has a reason, all things that befall us; it may not be at once apparent, but there is always a reason. And I want to give up on it.

      Are you ready?  Here goes.    I woke up today to the sight of this Monet reproduction framed on my table:     It's Claude Monet's  Fisherman's Cottage on the Cliffs at Varengeville . I chanced upon it once at a Barnes & Noble store, the painting being the design on a set of blank cards. Which I promptly bought. Three boxes of them. Among the cards I ever sent out in my life, I think the ones bearing this Monet piece are the most circulated. (So if you got one from me, holler out so I know whom I gave it to and how many I sent out. LOL. Anyway.) This particular Monet piece evokes a longing to travel, to visit new places, to see what's beyond the blue horizon. Through the years, I got to associate this Monet painting with a CD one friend gave me some years back: National Public Radio's  urlLink  All Songs Considered  .      All Songs Considered  is a collection of compositions played as musical interludes and segues between stories and news clips at National Public Radio (89.3  urlLink KPCC  in Pasadena). It is music from around the world. It's got some very wonderful instruments and sounds that I've never heard before: a thumb piano, a cymbalom, a trikitrixa, a glass harmonica, even a Finnish vocal technique called a "yoik." It's a gorgeous compilation of world music without the pretensions common to such albums. I love every piece, but among them, one stands out:  urlLink Kepa Junkera's   Santimamiñeko Fandangoa & Ioaeoe .      Santimamiñeko Fandangoa & Ioaeoe  sounds a lot like a rondilla piece. It comes from Junkera's hit album  urlLink Bilbao 00:00h . It's a 2-CD compilation of songs having an unmistakable "world" flavor but fused with a very distinct Basque polyphony. I bought  Bilbao 00:00h  solely because I was impressed with Junkera's piece in  All Songs Considered , and a friend from Bilbao was quite surprised to find out I have a Junkera album. Apparently, Kepa Junkera is a big artist in that part of Spain. From  Bilbao 00:00h , one other number stands out; a song that, unlike the others, is sung in Castilian:     Del Hierro a Madagascar  .   Una lengua común, un idioma mestizo. Un sonido de arena y de fondo de mar. Una sola canción para dar a los hijos. A aquellos que han partido, que vienen y van. Una lengua común, una casa de todos. Una mezcla de lluvia y mañanas del sol. Una sola canción por que nadie esté solo. El verbo compartido en racimos de voz. Del campo y de la sierra, de Itoiz hasta Portugal; Del baile y de la siembra, del Hierro a Madagascar.   One common language, one mixed tongue. A sound in the sand and the sea bottom. One song to give to your children. To those who are gone, to those who come and go. One common language, one house for all. A mixture of rain and sunshine mornings. One song so nobody is alone, sharing the word in clusters of voices. From the contry and the mountains, from Itoiz to Portugal; From the dancing and the sowing, from El Hierro to Madagascar.   I always thought it was a perfect song for the United Nations, if ever the United Nations adopted a song. Or maybe Miss Universe. It would be nice to see this song performed in a Miss Universe competition instead of those cheesy Joey McIntyre or Enrique Iglesias songs.  Del Hierro a Madagascar  evokes some things that are very fundamental and very profound: unity, harmony and endless possibilities which are as numerous as the sands on the shore. Which brought me back to Monet's painting.  But anyways. It was getting late, and I thought I had best get up.

      So yeah. It's been one month since I decided to set up my own weblog. I've really been writing a journal in my mind ever since I could form coherent thoughts. About stuff around me, about my friends and family, about other people, about my experiences in general, personal and vicarious. My two cents on what is right and wrong with the world. Drew, a dear friend from grade school, once remarked that what I said needed to be heard (or read) by many more.  But me being Carlo , I just shrugged it off.  "They don't need to know about what I think."  was my characteristic response. Still, as the years progressed, I felt I needed some outlet for all the things that were brewing in my mind. Hence, this weblog, some ten years after those words were uttered.  I have long been ambivalent on advertising my thoughts anywhere--online, in my organizations' logbooks, on message boards, wherever. While I have always believed that what I said (or thought) made sense, two reasons held me back as well. First, I always got myself in trouble for saying too much.  "The more you say, the more likely you are to say something foolish,"  so said Gracián. Second, I always felt that my ideas and thoughts were like my children: once I put them in print, once I let them go, they're not anymore privately mine. I guess it's one of the sunk costs of this weblog thing.  I'm still figuring out this voice in my head, listening to its haphazard narrative of the world according to me. I'm still finding my bearings, discovering where I stand on issues. There are some entries heretofore that upon reexamination I have regretted ever posting; and I have resisted the colossal temptation of deleting them. There are also entries that I am perfectly content with. Those that have embodied all the churning emotions and ideas within me at the time. Just the same, being able to post all these adds a new layer of meaning to my journey. It has become one other outlet for me, in essence an  alter ego  who lives in a parallel universe, from which I can derive fulfillment (or at least relief), and hopefully become something from which others may derive whatever they can--humor, joy, motivation, case-in-points, advice, challenges, superiority, inferiority, intrigues, updates, gossip fodder, even--as my college friend Geraldine told me--an  "insight into how [my mind] can be dissected."  *sigh* The perils of having psych majors as friends! LOL  For all these, I give gratitude to everyone who has/had been a part of my life in each way, shape and form. To my parents, my brother and sister [both left handed--don't ask.], my aunt & uncle; to my intimate circles of friends--Mark my best friend who's now serving in the war, Drew who'll be entering a new career, Lester who'll be off to a new continent, Mike, Jeremy, Ryan; to my mentor Paul, Patrick, Peter, Francis, Mark Ohny; to Louise, Bambi, Chelat, Grace, Katch, Maharahnee, Maharlika, Ian, May Angela; to Carmela, Monica, Sab, Rain, Weng; to Chris, Gilles, Justin; to all those who have sauntered more intimately into and out of my life--you know who you are; to ancient friends, to new ones, to those I forgot to mention  «¡Ay de mi!»  --   cheers to us all  ; to Mrs. Perry Cabo and her 5th grade  Jottings  class; and to all those who underwent the trouble of sending me their reactions/comments/hate mail, notwithstanding my comments link having been shut down...I regret not being able to accommodate everything in my posts, but your own two centimes are invaluable nonetheless, and y'all are fantastic!! ¡Muah!  I'll continue to sail westward, to this fabled New World that holds many surprises in store for those who reach its shores. Who knows when I'll get there, if at all I do. But who cares really? The answer must be in the attempt to cross the high seas." And while I do, I'll continue to post whatever I feel may be personally important and attempt to find my true voice. I hope that through this, you'll find yours as well.    «Au Nouveau Monde!», cria le genois.

      Heard from Mark today. He's in Washington state now. "It's cold," he says. "I sent you a postcard yesterday so you should be getting it soon.... I'll try to purchase a laptop when I get there so I can fully access my AOL and attach a Yahoo messenger so we can talk again."  There , being Germany, is where he's waiting to be deployed to. And from there who knows where.  I've lapsed into episodes of catatonia since he left. It's not everyday your best friend gets deployed to engage in a war on the other side of the globe. I didn't even know what to say in those video diaries the other folks at his send-off party were making for him. I didn't know what to say to a guy I've known for 16 years. "Come back soon, come back healthy" was all I could blurt out. Even my date, who barely knew Mark, did a better job than me. I am so embarrassed.  I guess we've reached a point where nothing needs to be said just to get the message across. Not that there's nothing left to say, for God knows how we would chat ourselves right into the break of dawn after a night of partying. But yeah, a moment of silence, a hug, a gesture, these are all that's needed to tell him to take good care of himself. "You don't even need to write me an email everytime," I said. "Just check on your Friendster page once in a while, and I'll know you're alright."  He'll do good; I just know it. We'll all be waiting for him.

      I used to be (and  kind of  still am) the habitual complainer. I used to complain about anything I could ever complain about. I used to complain in varying magnitude, from subtle sarcasm to outright loathing. Complaining has not been so much an obsession as it was a force of habit, as one discovers how all my flaws are invariably explained away.  One of my friends got quite irritated with it and retorted that I had nothing to complain about. "You live your life in relative comfort," he said, "and there are things much worse that other people live through, yet you don't hear them complaining half as much." I couldn't recall how I was ever able to win the argument, but suffice it to say that I did, through some convoluted reasoning that even I couldn't regurgitate now.  His words were true, but I just had to win my case, and while I was at it, to pound him on the noggin with the gavel for audaciously arguing with me. God am I now so ashamed of myself. I've begun to realize just how annoying I used to be (and  kind of  still am).  And I wish I weren't this creature that was so impossible to please. I wish I were this person who could appreciate the good things about life and not brood so much on its faults. I've never ever felt pure delight in anything, that much I'll admit. And there is something fundamentally wrong with that. It just kills me every single day.

        Is it gone yet?    Reports came in late Friday night that yet another worm will roam the Internet this [past] weekend. Same MO, the worm being disseminated as an e-mail attachment from supposedly "Microsoft" or "Mail Administrator." I have no idea how worms proliferate or how they're different from a virus or a bug, much less how to counter them. The best advice I heard over the local news, well at least the best-sounding advice in my humble opinion, was this:  to limit the usage of, or stay away altogether from, the Internet during the weekend when the worm is expected to wreak the most havoc .  Which I did. So forty-eight hours later, here I am emerging from my figurative storm shelter... surveying my surroundings... assessing the damage... and with the notebook and its files and programs immaculately intact, I emerge apprehensively and ask, "  Is it gone yet?  "  I used to shrug off these "worm" or "virus" warnings whenever they announce it in the news. We were somehow generally spared of these malicious creations, or if not, were able to recover our PC's contents successfully. Heck, we spend money on antivirus software and virus definition updates; might as well get our bang for our buck! But this time I thought to follow that "stay away" advice. Maybe my subconscious was telling me that it was the prudent thing to do. That maybe it wasn't worth the risk.  Funny how I assess risk these days. I've always lived for them.  "Life ain't life without the risks,"  so has everyone always remembered me saying. I have taken numerous risky and life-altering  ventures thus far, and I always believed it has made me a better person. Risk makes one's life a little more fun, a little more interesting, a little more breathtaking than others'. Risk-taking has somewhat defined who I am. But I guess this... this sudden reassessment of risk... this more prudent approach... I guess this is what comes with being a little more mature now than you were, say, yesterday or last month or last year.  Life will still be fun and interesting and breathtaking. But your priorities change as you grow older; and you have to be more careful at how you budget your time to accommodate these priorities. Time shouldn't be anymore wasted on recovering lost files and reinstalling corrupted programs. Time shouldn't be wasted on correcting mistakes whereon you have been given due warning anyways. You realize that time is expensive, some people's time more so than others.  So uhm yeah. Maybe this is a slightly more mature version of me, and I am liking it. I'm still far from being a great wisdom dispenser, from possessing that wisdom derived from a rich life and sundry experiences. But hey, baby steps. Little by little. I'll be that person someday.  __________________________________________________________________  **Special shoutout to "crustac  ee  n" who celebrated another birthday yesterday.

      I walk around, carrying a big shiny fire extinguisher. Put out this flame, put out that one, watch out for that fire lest it grow out of control. Life as a troubleshooter is gruelling. But just dive right into the turmoil, and keep believing that you will strike upon that elusive reason why things are how they are. Fortune's darlings are lavishly rewarded, on the condition of absolute submission.

      He sends me photographs everyday, images of life as it unfolds about him. A billboard, a landscape, the stray cat he's come to befriend. Snapshots of the flurry he finds himself in. The stories he tells with those images! He doesn't even give them titles. Why bother? His photos are their own narrative.

      Beauty is in imagining, in building novelties from what you already know. Beauty is in courage, in attempting to make a difference in the face of acknowledged fear. Beauty is in unadulterated faith, in trusting without reservation in something greater than yourself. Beauty is in forgiveness, the prerogative of the truly powerful. Beauty is in your own imperfections, which allows room for complementarity, interdependence, and synergy. Beauty is in chaos, a more interesting alternative to the monotony of a perfect world. Beauty is in sorrow, that singular experience which validates your humanity. Beauty is in defeat, in picking yourself up and henceforth being the wiser for it. Beauty is in the unknown, the primordial motivator for you to uncover the truth. Beauty manifests itself in a whole lot more things than dare we expect to find it. It is a paradox, a puzzle, a thing abstract. Beauty is in knowing this, in craving more, in being intoxicated by it.

      I'll capture this moment in a bottle, take a mental snapshot and file it in my mind. Now is not something I'd consider to be "joy"; now is more of "relief". The latter is harder to come by than the former. Preserve it, contain it, lock it away in a hermetically sealed canister. One of the few consolations for a weary pilgrim.

      I'm returning to forgotten pastimes and recreations--music, calligraphy, poetry, origami. I'm re-learning a language I've shelved for some time--Portuguese--and I thought French was hard. I'm reflecting on my neglected past from which I draw fresh insights into my daily existence. I'm discovering how, where and why I fit in this world. I'm making a conscious effort to live Life one day at a time: not to rush into and out of each day I've been given to live out. I strive to see both the tree and the forest so I can strike a prudent balance between the details and the big picture. I'm beginning to accept that I cannot possibly please everyone everytime. They will all have to wait for their turn, and if that inconveniences them, it is through no fault of mine anymore. I know that voices abound to give their own two cents on every matter--some in good faith, some not--and realize that the most important voice I should heed is my own. I am making peace with the way things are with me and adjust accordingly. I believe that my destiny and purpose are bigger than my own self and that I had best learn how to harness it properly for the greatest good. I am daily pleased at the little accretions to my admittedly inferior wisdom, comforted by the fact that all things I suffer myself to go through are never futile. I believe in vicarious learning, but that the mistakes you commit yourself have the more lasting effects. I believe that all the good--and bad--that you do comes around to pay you in full with accrued interest. I believe in a pluralistic society, not so much out of tolerance as out of a genuine appreciation of our vibrant and essentially human diversity. I believe that happiness is possible if we count ourselves worthy of it. Although it hasn't yet come in my life, I believe I'm getting there. And I'm not afraid to ask for the moon; it's but commensurate to what you'll get in return.

      My world is now; tomorrow doesn't exist for me.  Which doesn't say I live a hedonistic life. Quite the opposite. My world is now;  now  is what counts,  now  is when I can do the things I need to do. Tomorrow doesn't exist; tomorrow was never promised to anyone, and no one can claim tomorrow as theirs.  So I often find myself, against better judgment, attempting to do more things than what I can handle. Which is maladaptive.  Note to self: live life one day at a time. Be a little less demanding.

      I wanted to write something about this week's terrorist attacks in Madrid, but for personal reasons and in honor of a particular promise, I'd rather stay away from the matter. In its stead I'll write about some things that are more important to me.  Earlier this week my dad had a health scare. He was taken to the hospital after having suffered from a protracted fever and physical weakness. He had an initial x-ray taken, through the which it was found that he had what looked like a malignant tumor in one of his lungs. After a battery of standard tests, a CT scan and 3 biopsies, he was, to our immense relief, cleared of any cancer. It must have been an x-ray anomaly that had happened. Still, my dad used to be a heavy smoker, so the possibility of him contracting cancer was never really out of our minds. "Malignant lung tumor" still resonates in my mind; most people die from it within months.  I also just learned that my sister, who's earning her degree in mass media productions this month, had won the recognition of having co-authored one of the ten best theses of their graduating class, as well as several other awards on top of that. And this she managed while at the same time serving as one of the editors of the school paper. I've always been unequivocal about how proud I am of her. She's intuitively brilliant at what she does, and just as important, she works hard on perfecting her craft. She is just phenomenal.  And then there's the issue of my work. My work is invariably toxic. But my co-workers are great, which more than makes up for the stresses of earning our daily bread. I was late once this week, by five minutes, which I doubt that anyone noticed, but it freaked me out. And in any event, it's always a miracle that I even get to work on time, considering my drive between home and work to be 50 miles through the reticulated Los Angeles freeways at rush hour. Throw in the occasional early morning fog and it becomes for me a harrowing commute that borders on the traumatic.  Tomorrow, Saturday, I'm going to sleep through the morning.  (What a crappy way to end an entry, eh?)

       "What is truth?" said jesting Pilate, and would not stay for an answer.  -Francis Bacon  I saw The Passion of The Christ today. It is everything it was described to be, and more. I was moved, yea, moved, and touched. It is a narrative that doesn't as much rely on enunciated words as it does on imagery, gestures, and orchestration. Symbolism was very powerfully employed, none more so than through Christ's clear eye--expressing that he is at once human by his wounds and at once divine by his eye. It also made me reexamine my faith. It confounds my existing beliefs and assumptions about what it is to be Christian, it challenges my understanding, and it makes me search for truth. It makes me realize that truth can only be discovered through resolute faith.

      The other day, the  urlLink Los Angeles Times  was reported to have refrained from using the phrase  pro-life  in a review on an opera by Richard Strauss, saying that such usage connotes that by the same token there are people who are  anti-life .  Hmm. That was the funniest news brief I have heard this week.

      So I was driving west on Olympic on my way to work when Ryan Seacrest (oh like you don't listen to his show too LOL) said, "Air Force One just took off twelve seconds ago from LAX to Bakersfield." Sure enough, within seconds, it was visible from the ground. It was a long aircraft, appearing gray through the smog.   I didn't like the occupant as much as his opponent back in 2000, and I still don't like him because of his staunchly Republican policies; but it was a pretty neat experience to see that aircraft. "I've never been this close to the president before," so I thought. Hah. It was very cool.

      "Do you ever visit the pier?," asked Justin. Well, I haven't lately. I've been there a couple of years ago. It was late summer and the weather was gorgeous. "I've never really been to the California beaches a whole lot," he says.  What is it with the sea? There is something so irresistible about it. Something which cannot be explained in plain and simple terms.

      I was at the B&N store over at The Grove on Fairfax yesterday where I picked up a small bargain book on astrology. I never believed in any of that stuff. I always believed that what's said about you under your sign was a bait that fed your vanity, enticing you to give credence in all that crap. (Again, just my opinion!) "You tend to be a perfectionist," or "You tend to put others before you," or "You tend to work too much." Please. But for fun, I flipped over to my sign (I'm a Virgo, by the way), and actually perused the whole chapter. I hoped to come across something I've never read before. And there it was: "Your expectations on others are tough, but your expectations on yourself are even tougher." GASP! Me, me, me, me, me!! That was me!! Hahahah. Then I remembered my personal anathema to astrology. So what's the point here? Well, no point really. I just wanted to share how grave my ennui was, that I started veering into B&N's astrology section.  A: My weekend is almost over; B: I haven't completed my mental detox; I therefore conclude: the coming week should be interesting....  ....« evil laughter »

      A lot of things are where I want them to be at the moment, and I feel a semblance of peace settling within me. I'm learning how to apply the brakes and observe the posted speed limit for life, which unravels itself at its own unhurried pace. It would be a shame if I couldn't appreciate that. It's odd how stuff turn out right when you relax your grip on them.  For my part, I've had to insist on some people that they loosen their grip on me as well. It's not entirely unfair, as I have been a little more obliging than I ought to be. I want to be inaccessible again; and never mind that I burn bridges indiscriminately, tragically confident, through the conviction of my own vanity, that the tab of rebuilding will be picked up by the other side. For although I know I will be proven wrong, it will be motivation enough for me to move on and reconfigure my valence, and I'll reach out when I do.  Until then, they had best content themselves with secondhand narratives of my personal reality... postcards without the obligatory "Wish You Were Here."

      Things are starting to fall into their proper places, and I feel vindicated at having stuck it out. Life is starting to catch up with me, and one by one my frustrations and doubts all seem to shrink away. I feel I'm being taken care of, by a higher being, by fortune, I'm not sure by whom or by what.  I was on several occasions asked by different people if I believed in predestination. I always said, no, that goes against the principle of free will and all the strings attached to it. Had I said no because it was the prudent, polite and proper thing to say? Perhaps. But privately, I believed--and still believe--otherwise.  Go where the wind blows, see where it takes you. You do what you do now...you interact with the people you've been granted to meet...you are who you are, what you are, why you are, how you are all for a reason... a reason you're not necessarily entitled to know.

      Please do not remove the rock, the stumbling block in my way. I travel this path often, but that which tripped me up the first time is more than just an inconvenience. It reminds me of an important lesson. It reminds me to slow down. It teaches me to recognize disaster when I see one, and that I, being the wiser for it, ought to act as prudence would dictate. So I thank you for your concern; and I recognize that the gesture you make is made in good faith. But please do not remove the rock.

      Guess what? I'm finally over you. I thought the time would never come. I thought you'd haunt me forever. You've tormented me for years, made me jaded, driven me mad with inspiration, forced me to seek friendlier shores. I was consumed by thoughts of you, every single day, in every corner of the world I found myself in, and, yes, I confess, I was becoming obsessive. It was an obsession bordering on the maladaptive, and getting away was my sole consolation. It kept my sanity intact...more or less...and God be thanked,  more  than  less . You had been my muse; and I will admit, you still are. None other could ever be that worthy. But we operate on a different level now, and our relationship had transcended onto something else. So thank you for all the thoughts you've forced me to think, for all the emotions you've forced me to feel, for forcing me to know myself, my shortcomings, my limitations, my potentials, my humanity. If these are the only things I could ever hope to take with me, I will forever be content.

      "Sometimes, no, a lot of times, I want so badly to make conversation with you, to try to rebuild the connection we once had. The more I got to know you the more I saw in you that evanescent, rare character, that certain  je ne sais quoi , that which convinced me that you're "The One."  "But along with knowing the good comes knowing, well, the not so good. I had my doubts. I made that very plain to you. Yet I was prepared to overlook your faults and dismiss my doubts. But you have to work on them too. Just because I am willing to disregard and dismiss them doesn't mean I'll be forever okay with it.  "So, yes, I would wait for you to catch up, that much I'm willing to do. But I'm not sure how long I can wait. The winds will blow, and when they do and your sails aren't ready still, well, they're not ready. And I've never been one to pass up a good strong easterly. That's how I got here, that's how I'll be gone.  "Take your time if you want to. That's your entitlement. But I cannot guarantee you my stay, and I dare not guarantee you anything. I can only say these things to you, in good faith, so you may be aware, so you may act wisely upon that which you now know. I've been aloof for good reason; take your cue from my silence. I've met you halfway, now it's your turn to approach."    (But these I never told.)

      My trouble with quietude, the sort which comes when I tune out external noises, is that my internal demons emerge to the surface and quickly fill the void. They bring with them a hundred issues that have lain dormant and a hundred mistakes that I have tried to justify. I always stood firm on the position that there never was anything I regretted ever doing. Yet the time comes when we must come to terms with our past, and for my part, a past that had been so patched up with so many things on so many occasions to give the semblance that I got it all together. That the world has treated me right, as I deserve, for I never did anything so gravely wrong. Which is hardly the truth.  What is it so frightening and awful about failure? What does it matter if you can't achieve everything you were expected/supposed/implored to achieve? Could it be that you're running in the wrong race after all? Which, when I think about it, scares me more like naught else.  I will continue to compete, and I have no doubt that, me being who I am, my run will be spectacular. And that someday, if I win, when I win, I should be prepared to confront a new demon: how much would I have enjoyed the prize?

      I finally got burnt out. I took on too much burden than I could hold. It all came crashing down. I have but myself to blame.  So I withdrew. No more doing favors, no more running errands, no more saving the world. I flipped the sign on the door: Carlo is temporarily  out of order .  I guess it bothers some people how I can flip my lines of communication on and off as if it were a light switch. I've isolated myself for a week now. No email, no text messages, nothing. I should congratulate myself then. I finally have the precious silence I was craving for.  As always, I will reach out when I do.

      We've laughed, we've cried, vacillated between extremes. Two lifetimes shared at our destiny's juncture. Now we stand somewhere in between, unsure of what we are to each other, unsure of who we are on our own. Why is it, when the one approaches, the other retreats? Afraid of letting go, yet unwilling to meet halfway? What are we? Who are we? Neither this one nor the other... should we just accept something in between?

      I was surveying my fields this afternoon when I came across a crop circle, in the middle of which stood this four-foot green alien.    (not shown in actual size)    "Hey, you can't squat here," I said.    "Yes I  can ," it adamantly said.         "Can  NOT! "         "  CAN TO!  "    So I threatened to call the cops.         Which was only met with a peal of laughter.    "I'm sorry you didn't get the memo, earth person," it said, "but your lease on the planet expires in  two weeks ..."         "... and we're not renewing your contract ."

      "The less the words, the less the litigation."   Oráculo Manual y Arte de Prudencia   Baltasar Gracián   I guess my fault is not striking the right balance. I guess my fault is I clam up when your words inundate me. I guess my fault is not having an infinite amount of faith in you.  Understand that once you weave something out of words, it cannot be unwoven, it cannot be undone. So I humbly ask you to judge me objectively, and use caution with your words.

      "I measured the skies, now the shadows I measure Skybound was the mind, Earthbound the body rests."   epitaph, Johannes Kepler   I had my first thought about death when I was four. It was of my grandmother. From what my  4-year old powers of observation and rationale could muster, I learned that old people died. That's it. They didn't die sooner or more often, they just died. I thought if she did, I'd be very sad indeed.  But we grow up, experience the world, and learn new stuff. Our outlooks eventually change. I learned that death isn't so much an event as it is a process. I learned that it takes a lifetime to die. We die a little everyday, of various causes--failure, distrust, miscommunication, loathing, disappointment, anger, even regret. We die of life's general unpleasantness. We die of ourselves.  Today, I'll allow myself to die a little more freely. I'll let the pieces fall to the ground. I'll resist the urge to pick them up. I'll let them rest there. And I'll be completely okay with it. We all die sometimes, and some die more entirely than others. Find your place in the spectrum.

      Wanna know the truth? I don't know how I can be won. I don't think I've ever been. Some have tried; they gave their best, but only got frustrated. I accepted their best, then I got frustrated. So they never lasted. With me, nothing ever does. Let me tell you this: when you do not know your own standards, refuse to settle where they lie, and much less recognize when they've been met, you never find contentment with anyone or in anything. And I take much offence when you say you're here to change that; when you see it as a problem to solve... when you treat it as a disease to cure. My behavior and attitude towards relationships may be self-defeating, but let me sort them out on my own terms. Let me take my time to grow and learn. You cannot erase my doubts for me. I think it's very condescending of you, and it will only serve to prejudice your cause. I just thought you had to know that.

      Ironic as it sounds, maybe I'll catch up. And then we'll talk. Swap stories. Share perspectives. The way I see it, we never really went our own separate ways. We just got caught up with everything around us. You with your own affairs, I with mine. The road we travel is the same, passing up exits we never cared to take. So I guess I'll see you sometime.

      I never buried our past. Maybe I was holding out hope, hoping for something new. Maybe I was reluctant to let go, even if I won't admit it. Maybe I don't even want to find the closure that comes with it, afraid of dealing with a life less complex. My maybes are endless... changing with the seasons, each one never quite right.  Now the past comes to haunt me, with your resurrected voice that brings with it memories I wanted to forget that I have. A whisper in the dark, faint enough to not startle, but the whisper is there, I heard it through the haze, unmistakable and clear.  One more maybe that I'd like to entertain now, a new maybe from which you might find insight and draw your own closure: maybe, just maybe, it was not worth it.     The souls of the unburied might not pass the river that encircles the kingdom of death  But must wander in desolation, with no abiding place, no rest ever for their weariness.  Sophocles

      Went to the movies yesterday and I freaking forgot my phone at home, so instead of texting everyone individually (God knows what time it is at their respective locales now),&nbsp;I thought to respond here (in the order they were received):      Peter   , it was Spider-Man. I think I'm getting a little too old for it. You were right, even my aunt said the inside shots of the cathedral looked different from real life.      Justin   , hope you enjoyed the game. I heard the Dodgers won.      Rain   , hihihi! You were the first to respond in the circle posting. I'm doing great, thanks for asking. Ang daya naman, sa bibihirang pagkakataong pareho tayo nasa YM, I left pa my means of reply at home.      Mikey   , cra ka talaga. Punta ka dito, sabay tayong maghanap. LOL   *********   Aye, went to the movies yesterday and saw Spider-Man 2. Did you actually know that it's a hyphenated title? Only noticed it yesterday. Was that Hank Azaria doing the multiple cameos? Anyway. I think I'm getting old for Spider-Man. Act 1 put me to sleep. Act 2 made me nauseous.   *********   Argh. Doctor says I need to wear prescription glasses.  Again . I'm really aging.   *********   So there, I'm not snubbing anyone, or anything remotely like that. I just left my phone at home. Happy weekend everyone (or what's left of it). News from Lake Wobegon is next.

      On the west 60 freeway, heading towards Los Angeles just out of Riverside city limits, one encounters a brownish-gray stone mastodon perched upon a steep rocky hill. It is an odd sight that a commuter on both sides of the 60 won't miss. "There used to be a theme park there," someone had told me. But as it went with a lot of things, the place got mismanaged and eventually forced to shut down. Now only the lone pachyderm stands there, a strange relic, forced to be extinct a second time.

       Black Butterflies  I guess it's too much to ask that my week wind down pretty much like everyone else's. Instead, crises, problems and issues tend to crop up just when my workweek is about to end. It's a weekly crescendo I've had to come to terms with. My Fridays have invariably felt like me riding my car off a cliff at a hundred miles per hour. Saturdays find me flying in mid-air, disoriented, charging into nothingness, unaware that my awaited weekend is here. Monday, that's when I crash and repeat my weekly run. Well. I guess I should be content at how my manager entrusts me with these black butterflies. These crises to manage. These problems to solve. I mean, that should count for some, right?  Fifteen minutes away from my official weekend, I was hoping that nothing else would disturb my uneasy peace. It was when I got the note. A distant voice, from a not so distant past.    Letter from Pamplona   Dear,  How are you? I have not heard from you in a long while. Maybe I haven't written enough too. But in any event, I hope you're fine. I've been here for several weeks now. The town had started celebrations for San Fermin. I saw the running once again. That's when I realized, I AM HOME. I was doing my own running too, I thought I would end up somewhere else, but my finish line is here at home. How ironic. It would be very good to hear from you. Maybe I will come by to visit; I will let you know when.   (...at which point, I shudder...)   Yours,  (someone I promised not to name).  ...as Sheryl Crow renders a song in my head...    Song in my head   You can't see your shadow Reaching for the sky Lay your head down on my bed Please don't ask me why Why am I leaving Why don't I know Something deep inside me Is forcing me to go You say you need me But you can't tell me no When I ask you to stop me baby You just let me go  C'mon, c'mon c'mon Break my heart again For old times sake   "C'mon, C'mon," Sheryl Crow

Now the Ligurian calls me In that language intimate She seeks now the stories I cannot wait to tell her.

      Today I am awash on a strange coast. Today I awoke incognizant of my past. I have crossed my yesterdays, and found today like nothing the priestess on a tripod had foretold. My yesterdays are but a blur; my memory of them is gone. What remains is the aftertaste, vivid and distinct emotions. Feeling vulnerable to be abandoned by reason, I grasp for it in places where none will be found. In its stead, the vulgarity of emotions. I grasp a handful of coarse, black sand, I let them trickle through the digits: these, dear, are the reasons of the weary.

      Walking by the shore is the antidote to the neurosis that has recently become the story of my life; and bringing a good friend for these walks is double the relief. Peter, a good friend from New York, someone I knew from grade school, came by this weekend to visit some friends of his. So I thought it would be nice to take him to the pier and fair grounds down in Santa Monica.  It felt very good to spend time with someone you can completely trust and let your guard down, someone you can rant and rave about everything and you know won't judge you for it. Maybe it's how you reestablish connections with the past that makes your journey seem not too haphazard, and lends you more courage to go on a little farther still. No matter the failures, what keeps you going is knowing that you carry with you experiences that have--hopefully--made you one the wiser; if that fails, pray that you'll have good friends to remind you of them when you need reminding.  The early evening summer breeze had a hint of hyssop, which must just have been a lingering scent from the local parfumerie. Hyssop, an herb related to mint, was often cultivated as a remedy for bruises, I recalled. And as we made our way back to the car, I began to hope that my personal bruises would also start to heal.

      1. Have a beginning. 2. Have an end. 3. Have them fairly close to one another. 4. If you have a point, state it near the start of your story. When your audience is still awake.  Of course, I too have on occasion transgressed these laws. But some...some just disobey them a little too consistently, they should be prosecuted.
