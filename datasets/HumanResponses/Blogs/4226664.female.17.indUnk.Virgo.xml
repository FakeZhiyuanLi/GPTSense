      I m rather tired now. Sitting in front of my labtop after my bath and doing nothing. My mind is blank now, having some headache too. Today went to Melvin house, if i'm not wrong i reach there at 12 plus. Jun packed food for me and Melvin. I ate 1 serving of carrot cake and fish porridge. Then 3 of us start doing the Math quiz, it's tough and it's a real killer... The teacher is mean, set such a tough quiz for us. We only did the Quiz today and nothing else. Suppose to do our ASP project that is almost dueing. sigh. I haven't even started at all. So sad. Can't help it. I really don't have the energy and mind of think of it now. However, today is a laughter day, 3 of us laugh non-stop till we actually roll on the floor. haha. MAN... Melvin' s mouse is so real. Both Jun and me scream when we saw that. haha. Then Melvin start giggling away. Then i ate quite alot of snacks today too. =X Nothing much to say bout today either. Kind of moody now cos' he didn't reply my sms the whole day. sigh. MIA again. Well, it's expected anyway. When things start to get better, he's gone again. I m so tired. Maybe he's really busy with his things plus his bill is getting higher. But i m sure he will sms me tomorrow. I'll wait. Well.. i shall sign off now cos' i don't think i have anything else to say. tata~~ =)

      Gee.. i just got home not long. Took night rider home just now but still got to walk quite a distance b4 i reach home.Damn tired. Humph... must be wondering where i went so late in the night right? I went to my workplace cos' we got a meeting regarding Dinner & Dance organised by the company. We are going to take part in the competition so we need to discuss bout what we are going to perform and plots, everything. The first prize , if i didn't remember wrongly is $1.5k. haha. Quite alot yea? But i guess it's the fun that counts more. Yea! Today finally went swimming in the morning bout 11 with my sister at Woodlands Swimming Complex. Man.. The weather was damn fine,except too many people already. Many coach conducting swimming lessons plus today is Saturday, so u can imagine how crowded it was.  Everytime i swim pass someone from the opposite side, i scared i might accidentally kick the person or kena kicked. haha. But den, we managed to swim 10 laps. Quite tiring. Too long didn't do sports or exercise. lol. Well... after swimming, we met up with donny and together with him, we went to swensen to have our lunch. The food taste really YuMmY!! I ate everything up. Gee. Eh.. their food are much better, more varieties after they change their menus. Plus their services are quite good. *thumb up* . Went home after lunch. Took a nap after i came home and woke up to do my maths tutorial, i finished it. hee. Bout 10 plus in the night, on my way to take train, i saw my classmate, James. He's was acting so weird, talking to my other classmate, hehehe.. i know who u are if i m not wrong. *grins* Went to bukit batok to meet up with "him" cos' he needs to go to orchard for the meeting too. He's swweet tis time... So different from the other time we met. I wonder is it b'cos we haven't meet up for quite some time. Anyway, i had a great time with "him". Oh ya, i miss my colleagues too. Man.. All of them gave me a big warm hug upon my arrival. I felt so happpy.. so dear to me. They kept asking me when i coming back to work. I can't give them a definite answer, so just told them after my common test. When i was bout to leave, everyone gave me a big hug... Mann... they ROX! hee. Make me wanna go back to work asap. =)

      Yesh! Finally today is FRIDAY. so happy. At last i can have a good night rest later. haha. Have been quite busy these few days. Projects,Quzzies and home assessments... one after another. Yesterday was damn tired, so i didn't update blog. Only thing i can remember bout yesterday was that i had 3/4 of a huge pizza for dinner and worked on my Java homework till v late in the night. LoL. Today lesson start at 8 am, able to reach there on time. thanks to OCC for giving me a morning call or else i m sure i can't wake up by 6.45am. hee. Plus i already got a warning letter for this module,Java programming. =/ Can't afford to skip another time already else sure kena debar. After school went to e-learning plaza to do my E-Quiz with Jun. hmm... did badly. So i m going to re-do it. After that, i went to meet my sister about 2 plus. The whole morning i didn't have any meals...Suddenly have the urge to eat KFC so she accompanied me to eat. We actually planned to go swimming after that, we even prepared everything but then, weather played us out. The whole day was raining... sad case. lol. Just had my dinner with my sister and dad.The food was yummy but quite expensive. I m quite worried for my dad, he wasn't in the mood from the way i see. I know he must be troubling with lots of stuffs, especially the family and his work. I can't help him much, if only i were older then maybe i can help him out. Oh ya... there 's a new band call "nan quan ma ma", this is best recommended. Their songs are grrreattt! Very nice! Mostly RnB type. I'm sure u guys will like it too. I think i shall end here today. Going to do my homework now. tata~ ^^ Today sure is a gd night to sleep!

      I'm such a fool. so toopid! I actually thought that my Oral is today but then when i got into the classroom, my sixth sense tells me that something is wrong. I was RIGHT! I took out my entry proof and double check with the calender then i saw my examination date was on the 16 of August. It was 2 days back already. ha... So sad. haix. However, since it's over, i just got to accept it. I didn't really like the feeling when i'm in the class room either, waiting to be tested. So, I just left the room after i found out i make a fool of myself. Hmm... Straight away, i went to Jun's house. I reached there bout 3 ? Then both of us slack for 2 hours trying to identify problems for our project. haha. Jun's dog,Joe, is cute and small. so obedient too unlike my dogs. So irritating. but den they have their cute sides too. Not that bad lah. ^.- Melvin and his girlfriend joined us later on. We managed to identify all the problems and solutions by 10.30pm. By then, when we are bout to leave Jun's house, her family just returned. We took cab home, 4 of us. Jun went to Melvin's house to get the labtop. Hmm... I'm tired, but i'm still doing my Java labwork now, got 3 questions altogether, how m i going to finish it and date due on friday. =/ eh... But i know there's someone else who is still working on the project and she's Jun. She must be tired and stress. Take it easy gal. Hmm... Melvin is also not in mood now. I feel kind of helpless. =/ Don't really know wad can i do for you people. But if you guys need help or a listening ear, you can look for me . =) -I may not be able to cheer you up, but i can share your unhappiness with you.- Gd night.

Almost fall asleep during the last lab. But i got up and went to toilet to wash my face. This morning i had a bad dream that woke me up.  =(  I actually dreamt of him and dreamt of myself kissing another gal. Man, this is horrible!!! I miss him terribly. Sms-ed him the whole day but not even one reply from him so during my second-break at 6, when i really can't helped it, i took out my phone and called him. However, as expected, he gave me the cold shoulder, giving excuses for not replying den just hanged up like that. I feel so heart-pain. * sigh * Lucky enough i have my classmates to accompany me and joke with me, else i will surely collaspe again. Ha.. enough of all these! Hmm... I'm kind of addicted to typing blog everyday. It's a way of expressing my thoughts so that i won't keep it in my heart. *clap clap* haha. Wah.. time is passing real fast. Tomorrow i will have to take my O level english Oral. * good luck to myself * And after my oral tomorrow still got to rush down to meet my friend to do my creativity and productivity project! No choice, cause thursday is the date line.  -.-!  haha. humph... Oh ya, today i ate quite alot too, too tempting already. Must start exercising already, i m getting fatter le. * piang * Even my uncle said that i have gain quite alot of weigh le. haha.  I shall sign off now. tata~  =)                                                                 - tomorrow will be better -

I miss my uncle... man! haven seen him for 2 weeks plus. Finally he's free to meet up with me. Oh ya, it's not advisable to stay out late at night during this month. I don't really believe in such things, so  hack care ! hahaha. My mum is nagging at me non-stop now, asking me to go and eat my dinner. So i got to end here b4 she  buey tahan  me. Man..
