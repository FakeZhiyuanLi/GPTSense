      The edge of a Thunderstorm which popped up only a little while ago. This storm is actually back at the New York border, so the clouds stretch at least 50 to me. Nice.   urlLink     Martin

      This is Dublin. This also happens to be the city I was born in. I took this photo on one of my many trips home. I love and hate this city all at the same time. What exactly does that mean?   urlLink     Martin

      This is a picture taken from my front porch during the winter. I'm really lucky to live where I do as it gives me a chance to see some really great sunsets.   urlLink     Martin

      A few weeks ago, actually back in May, we had a nasty thunderstorm come through in which a huge willow tree behind my house got hit by lightning and fell down. Today the tree was finally cut to pieces and made into molch. You can see from the photo that the fence is in bits, and also the metal one behind it. Mother nature is stonger than we know.   urlLink     Martin

      A long hot, hazy and humid day comes to an end. There is nothing like evening, especially after it has been so nasty all day. This is my street with the lights coming on. My camera has this setting for taking night photos. Works nice. Soon all those tress will be bursting with color, and again the snows will come. Not too I hope.   urlLink     Martin

      Shot this on the way to work this morning. I love old cars, especially from the pre 1950's years. They just had so much class, unlike the boxes that are being built today. Not sure what kind this is, but it's just great to see someone is probably taking it to be brought back to it's original splendour.   urlLink     Martin

      A little bit of Ireland right here in the good old USA. This is my local, when I go. I haven't been there in almost a year. Sorry Paul, I'll be down for a pint soon. I promise. Irish pubs are all over this country, and that's a good thing. This particular one just happens to actually look and feel like an Irish pub, probably because it's run by an actual Irishman. I will be down, I will. :)   urlLink     Martin

      Like my office at work, I like to have two screen available to me for working at home also. A little cluttered I know, but then again, is there really too many home office's that aren't full of stuff. Having two monitirs hooked up is so much easier than having only one. I also have my t.v. hooked up too, so I have a complete media center right in front of me so to speak.   urlLink     Martin

      Today was a really warm, typical summers day with thunderstorms building throughout. We got scimmed by one of these storms from which I took this photo during it's infant stage. A little lightning, a few rumbles of thunder and that was it. No rain. Right now it's getting pretty humid, and I think the AC will be in order for some good sleeping. Bring on the Autumn.   urlLink     Martin

      I took this shot in April in Patomac Park, Washington D.C. This hand is part of a whole body that is for the most part giving the illusion of coming up from under the ground. The hand alone is about 5 feet high, so you can imagine how big this sculpture is. If you ever visit D.C., this is well worth a visit. "If you can find it".   urlLink     Martin

      My two crazy cats. Trouble is the youngest, and likes to sit on the fridge, probably because of the fish tank. The other one is Psycho, and he loves to be outside on the porch just soaking up the sun. He would stay out there all day if he could.   urlLink     Martin

      The one thing I love about the States is coming upon relics of the past. They are everywhere. Here is a picture I took last year on the Berlin Turnpike of an old "Drive In" sign. Now all it previews are Christmas trees. Shame they don't keep things like this going.   urlLink     Martin

      Just after sunset over Wallingford. The Fall is starting to make it's mark on the Summer as is evident in this sunset shot. I also have noticed a lot of trees are starting to turn also. Time for some great Fall shots soon.   urlLink     Martin

      This is my cat "Psycho" with one paw over his head. I think he was asleep, although one eye is sort of open. I guess thats the always alert part of him.   urlLink     Martin

      Here is another shot of Wallingford. This is Route 5 heading north, I make my turn at that green light to my house. If you turn left you will cross over the railroad tracks, go right and you end up in the main town area, go straigh and you end up heading towards Meriden.   urlLink     Martin

      This is my watch. It has a couple of scratches on it, which just means it's worn everyday, and has been ticking for almost 5 years now. I got a little experimental with Photoshop on this photo. Just figured I'd try something different.   urlLink     Martin

      This looks more menecing than it actually is. After days of hot humid weather, a cold front finally pushed it's way across New England and the result is this dark sky. It feels so much better out today, and I can finally turn off the AC.   urlLink     Martin
