      oh well...probably start with sumthing happy b4 going on to something sad...let's start with wad happened yesterday...  Yesterday was Guitar Nite 2004 aka "El Inicio"...ya...anw, yesterday was a day of laughter and tears. Early in d morning, got school lohz...dan d beginning of the day is like kena sai la...coz got class n stuff...ya...dan...until recess...sherry told me that she din bring d wire for d banner...i was like, shit wad happened man...so we started to panic. We thot of shaf...but shaf oso din bring a single shit (from wad i noe, she completely forgotten abt it after watching OC, ahaha!). So i suggested that we should come out earlier from class to buy wires outside school lohz. So sherry said we should call Jared to let him noe. In the end, Jared approved and ya...I happily waited for my lessons of that day to end...frankly speakin, it is becoz of guitar that i find school interesting...other than that...school suck like a piece of shit la...ya. Anyway, thats beside my point. Uh ya, as i was saying...time passed very VERY slowly for me. Dan, FINALLY...12 o clock came and i happily went outta class 2 meet Sherry. *fast forward* We both met fuz n ruz and we went to eat and buy d wire at S11. After eating, we went back school to hang d banner and stuff...ya. Dan...we went for rehearsal and prac at d audi...I was so proud (and I still am) of my banner...haiz...so nice sia...too bad it had to be taken down today 4 that  Manifestasi ...yupz...anw...prac for like CHAO long liaoz...ard 5 pluz...we broke for dinner. Ya...by that time...everyone was like CHAO excited lohz...ya...so each of us were super hyper. yepz. Dan, dinner was not say 'han suan' la coz like got a lot of meat and stuff...and then got curry veg...rice like malay d nasi lemak kind...prob everything is HALAL la...ya. During dinner, e whole table of us: me, sherry, fuz, ruz and shaf were laffing n laffing like no tmr liddat...ahaha! ya...uh...dan we changed. THE BIG THING HAS FINALLY ARRIVED! LIke the song that Clay Aiken sang, 'This is the Night'.  YEPZ! In the audi...we see ppl filling d seats one by one...ya...dan we saw Eugene's sis lohz. She LOOKS EXACTLY like Eugene...ony prettier and thinner, haha! Some say they like photocopy items of each other...heh. Anw...like we CHAO happi that a lot of ppl (ok...to be frank, not say a lot la ha? LIke 5/6 audi full?) came lohz. Was an encouragement tho...ya...soon, the thing starts le. "Shall we dance" as usual...guitar 2 sped like shit when its our turn to solo. Ya...dan ya...*fast forward* first half ended (for us...it's till Andante). Me and shaf went to change into our performing costume...ya...dan we CHAO excited...and we commented that time really passed realli fast la. Ya...dan soon, it's my turn to feel nervous...coz interval end le...me, Gab and Weiliang gotta perform those 2 chinese songs! Ya...dan everything went on smoothly...except 4 d fact my guitar part 4  'Qing Fei De Yi'  was bad la...play wrongly...ahah! But nvm sia...i had fun on stage. ahaha! Ya...soon, IT IS MY GURL BAND! YAY! MOFFATTS! ahaha! Ya...dan wah...CHAO high man...d feeling was there...ya...Shaf play d speed juz right and ya...our item was completed with smiles. ahaha! Yupz...everything soon ended. our last song...an encore piece was  La Bamba  lohz...ya...IT WAS THE BEZ THAT WE'VE PLAYED ALL D TIME! Yupz...end le...dan JIngyu surprised me by giving me n Miying ROSES! YUPZ...dan i CHAO surprised...and ya...that time...veh emotional...coz yesterday was the last time I play on stage with Miying le...ya...so i cried and cried. Dan...i stopped crying 4 like a while...Xinwei came and say wad dun cry and stuff like Ridz will come back 4 some HALAL pork and stuff...make me cry more...haiz...anw...the day ended...and i went home with Ameer...yupz...  Today came...wad a day and i realli din noe wad i was doin in school today...how i wish i had juz went 4 my piano lesson. Anyway...today d account kinda short la...but inside like a lot of my "bu zhi" feelings...  Today ish d day for interview 4 exco in guitar la...dan i thot maybe i CHAO excited but early in d morning when i first stepped into school, Mr choo gave out scores and I din haf a copy...thot maybe he 4got or wad...but subsiquently(or wadeva u spell it)...I still din get a single shit, so I've concluded that Mr choo din really kan zhong me as a player in Guitar. It's CHAO demoralising lohz...seeing even Aaron has d score and i dun...sometimes i think mr choo is bias or wad...i dunno...but i definitely feel that way la...kinda sad la...but ya. Anw...I felt demoralised d whole day lohz. Dan, ya...while waiting, they prac that 2pid new song...dan mei you wo de fen...i still am anry dan...i dunno somehow...i dunno...i hate d feeling...being left out of this shit. Ya...aiya...dan my turn to be interviewed. So they saw my application thingy and Mr choo was like, "ay...u NO A lvl pass ah?! WAH! GP ony juz pass?!" ...dan i was like ya...in my mind i was like so what? anw...interview continued...he asked why i wanna be VP and student conductor, i gave my reasons...and ya...aft that Mr Choo say wad...let's say u...u got MC or wad...(yah...i noe wad u driving at la...u dun want me to be student conductor juz say so straight on my face la!), hu wud u choose to assist u in conducting and stuff...wahlao...fuck la...hu oso noe u dun want me to be student conductor...altho i conduct in choir b4...kao...i think guitar is super bias la...ony favour ppl like Fuz, Jasmin and adam and co. WAD SHIT LA! Work so hard for d banner...like CHAO committed...and yet...I'm NOT EVEN RECOGNISED IN ANY WAY! FUCK! anw...I m still feeling angry n demoralised now...no matter wad shit reasons r given or said or explained to me...anw...stop here..if not i mite juz blow up...again...ya...aft a while...i got a msg from jasmine (miying) saying wad juz accept any positions given to u kk? WAD FUCK LA...means what...i'm given some lowly SHIT position la...FUCK! Neverhaf i felt so low b4...even in choir at least i was still in d Music Comm...where i do wad i really wanna do. FUCK SIA...they say oh we let u choose wadeva post n stuff...all fake one lohz...early they decided and stuff...KAO! dan now...aiya...FUCK la...4get it. Anw...went to cut hair today...and now...i shall continue my anger n 2pid PW...and 2pid GP...FUCK D WORLD MAN!

      It starts with One thing I don't know why                                                                                          It doesn't even matter how hard you try Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme To explain in due time All I know Time is a valuable thing Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings Watch it count down to the end of the day The clock ticks life away It's so unreal Didn't look out below Watch the time go right out the window Trying to hold on but didn't even know I wasted it all just to Watch you go I kept everything inside and even though I tried it all fell apart What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when... I tried so hard And got so far But in the end It doesn't even matter I had to fall to lose it all But in the end It doesn't even matter One thing I don't know why It doesn't even matter how hard you try Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme To remind myself how I tried so hard In spite of the way you were mocking me Acting like I was part of your property Remembering all the times you fought with me I'm surprised it got so (far) Things aren't the way they were before You wouldn't even recognize me anymore Not that you knew me back then But it all comes back to me In the end You kept everything inside and even though I tried it all fell apart What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when I tried I tried so hard And got so far But in the end It doesn't even matter I had to fall to lose it all But in the end It doesn't even matter I've put my trust in you Pushed as far as I can go for all this There's only one thing you should know I've put my trust in you Pushed as far as I can go And for all this There's only one thing you should know I tried so hard And got so far But in the end It doesn't even matter I had to fall to lose it all But in the end It doesn't even matter
