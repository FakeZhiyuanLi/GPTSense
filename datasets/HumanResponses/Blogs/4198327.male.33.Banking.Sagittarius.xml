      Well, Despo and I took the plunge last night. Our realtor is absolutely the best. He probably spent more time talking us out of buying it, then once we decided he let us know how he believes we made the best decision.  What do I mean by that? He spent a lot of time talking about how much work it's going to be...... how many headaches..... how emotionally exhausting..... etc etc etc..... Then, he ran the numbers for us and showed how good of an investment it is.  At 11:00 last night, we signed the contract. We'll see what's going to happen from here!  BTW - In case you didn't realize, the translation for the title is "House of WHO'S YO DADDY"

      Sting: I'd like to welcome you all here. Thank you for coming. As you know, I've been elected to serve as group president for this quarter. Our first order of business is to welcome new members. Shepherd, please stand.  Shep: Hi. My name is Shepherd Smith, and I'm a pretend celebrity boyfriend.  Group: Hi, Shep!  Sting: Welcome, Shep. OK, gang. Last week we discussed whether to reveal the identities of our pretend civilian girlfriends and the vote was taken. It was close, but ultimately we decided to do it. We'll begin with Anthony. Anthony?  Anthony: Well, I really don't know her true identity. She identifies herself only as the Doctor's friend CrazyTrain. I'm not sure what that means.  Vince: You're kidding! CrazyTrain? That's what mine's been calling herself too! I mean, right after "Dodgeball" came out, she called herself Average Jane, kind of in tribute to me, I guess. But recently, it's been CrazyTrain. I don't get it.  Sting: Well, well, well. It seems as if we've all been chosen by the same psycho. My PCG also has recently adopted CrazyTrain after a long string of pseudonyms, including SweatyTeeth, LeatherGirl and DisasterRelief.  Shep: Guys, you're not going to believe this. But the reason I'm here tonight is I got this letter yesterday from some woman who signed herself CrazyTrain.  Group: GASP!  Shep: Do you think we are all being pursued by the same woman? Could it be?  Group: Hubbub! Hubbub!  Bob: Interesting theory, gentleman. However, this CrazyTrain bedlamite is not the femme fatale that has been consorting with yours truly. Nay, it seems my fancier is a lass who goes by the dubious "Desperado. "  Group: Huh?  Sting: As always, it seems Bob's vocabulary has confused us all. Oh well. That's all the time we have for this week. Thank you all for coming. Don't forget: next week is potluck and is also the meeting where we all read our favorite passages from our PCG's letters. Meanwhile, all aboard the Crazy Train. Goodnight.

      Erin, I totally get your fascination with Shep. He's totally rad. I've always thought so. It's just weird that his name is Shepherd. It's like being named Farmer or Mechanic or Blacksmith or something. It's very odd.  Speaking of our favorite journalists, Dave has some pretty hilarious Olympics  commentary today at  urlLink www.miamiherald.com . If it asks you to log in, use mine.  Email address:  urlLink lerlanson@sbc.net  Password: cowbell  Funny stuff. I highly recommend it.  P.S. Am I the only one who didn't get Chris' post this morning? First of all, I don't know what a "swag" is, and when I clicked on the link, the page had nothing on it but a picture of W and a place that said "click here to order W products" or something like that. Did I miss something?

      Of course, I'm not demeaning the severity of yesterday's distressing decision, and  I applaud Erin's candid discussion of her homicidal desires.  It's just that today is Friday. It's WEEKEND time. And tonight we're going to see the freakin' Village, baby! No non-funny, non-trivial posts today. Nosiree.  Nevermind that my family is about to be blown into oblivion by nature's wrath.

      Days like this make me want to go home and drink.  I just called our vet to advise them of our decision regarding Jane Dog. We did decide after many tears to end her life.  Mean people suck and they go straight to hell.  Days like today make me wish I could help them get there a little faster.

      I discovered that I can leave home with wet hair and by the time I get to work it will be dry and will actually look halfway decent.  This is  HUGE .

      OK. So The Dr. and I are now the proud owners of a brand new, $17 Mr. Potato Head. He even comes in a clear plastic suitcase to store him and all his parts. Of course, I think you can still store some things in his butt, which I think must be really handy.  I spent my lunch break driving to Bellevue to the Toys R Us to buy him. After calling all the Wal-Marts, Targets and Toys R Uses in the greater Nashville area, I found that to be the ONLY store that had one in stock. The Dr. wants him for something he's doing in his lesson tonight. I have no idea what.  I just know that I've been looking longingly through the plastic to the little fireman hat and the big red lips, and I'm DYING to play with him. I also want to give him a name.  Funny story that I'm reminded of: My sister's pastor has two young boys. One of them, when he was very small, because of his extended exposure to church and church people, called his own carbohydrate friend Brother Potato Head. When I heard that story, I immediately thought of all kinds of marketing tie-ins. For instance, he could come with his own offering plate and large KJV Bible.
