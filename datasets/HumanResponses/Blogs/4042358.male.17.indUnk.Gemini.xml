       SEATTLE — Evil — a word usually reserved for the likes of Adolph Hitler or Usama bin Laden — is now being used by more than a third of Canadian teens to describe the United States.   Well, looks like our neighbors to the north dont seem to approve of us anymore, shame, we used to get along so well, oh well, your beer still sucks (movie line, not a drinker myself)  The article goes on to say:   French-Canadians were even harsher, with 64 percent of them calling America a force for evil.     I don't know much about Canada, but arent French Canadians the low end of the totem pole in Canada? All the canadian jokes ive heard always seem to center around French Canadians.  More:   The anti-Americanism from the United States' northern neighbors seemed to peak when the Iraq war started.      No shit, really? I thought the World Community really loved us for invading Iraq. And damnit, where is my cheaper gas if we went in for oil!?!      In one incident, hockey fans in Montreal booed during the playing of the American national anthem.   Crazy Canadians, sure, that pisses me off, but hey, whatcha gunna do?   Well, thats all I for now, thanks for reading.

      I have noticed that a lot of my hits are coming from 1 site:  urlLink http://www.technorati.com  did some reading on their site, and turns out, they search the web for different blogs, and allow users to search using keywords, I have to say im pleased to find out I am getting coverage, some of the searches that bring people here:  Michael Moore Don Mischer Bill O'Reilly (Your guess is as good as mine)  I'd like to thank the people over at technorati for bringing me some traffic, and for those who came from there, just remember to tell your friends.  Oh yeah, no major news today.

      Ok, let me put this out there right from the start, I think Michael Moore is the biggest moron in the Political Sphere.  Here is some of the interview between Bill O'Rielly and Michael Moore:  MOORE: Would you sacrifice — just finish on this — would you sacrifice your child to remove one of the other 30 brutal dictators on this planet?  O'REILLY: Depends what the circumstances were.  MOORE: You would sacrifice your child?  O'REILLY:  I would sacrifice myself   That is in essence, what those troops are doing, their parents (at least most of them) did not sign them up for the military, those Men and Women signed themselves up.  People are not sacrificing their children, the soldiers are sacrificing themselves, I'll give it to Michael Moore, he is a very good speaker, but his facts are SOOOO bad, its ugly.

       urlLink http://media1.stream2you.com/rnc/072304v2.wmv   Good video, it shows John Kerry's Iraq views starting from after 9/11 to the present. Like i said before, a flip flopper makes a good senator, since you are in essence voting for the people, but as a president, he will need to stick to his beliefs.  Problem is, as soon as it becomes politically expedient to tell an "ally" to go pound sand, Kerry will do just that. And the next time it's politically expedient to suck up to that "ally", Kerry is the one who will be told to screw off.

        AN on-air curse broadcast by CNN after US Presidential candidate John Kerry's nomination acceptance speech has left Democrats and network officials with red faces.After Senator Kerry's speech accepting the Democratic Party's nomination, balloons and confetti were released into the crowd.  But apparently there weren't enough for DNC convention centre director Don Mischer, who was heard on voiceover urging workers to release more balloons and confetti.  'No confetti. No confetti yet. Go balloons. Go balloons. More balloons. All balloons. All balloons. Come on guys, let's move it," began a relatively calm Mr Mischer.  Soon afterward however the DNC director begam to panic.  "Jesus, we need more balloons. I want all balloons to go, goddamn. No confetti. No confetti. No confetti. I want more balloons. What's happening to the balloons? We need more balloons. We need all of them coming down... balloons.  "Go balloons, balloons... what's happening balloons, there's not enough coming down. All balloons - where the hell - there's nothing falling," Mr Mischer said, before finally exploding: " What the f... are you guys doing up there?"    Oh my, time to freak out America, there was a curse word (other than Mrs. Heinz' "Shove it") muttered at the DNC, as the article reads, the director was trying to tell the balloon droppers what to do on a voiceover, and by the looks of it, got a little bothered by the lack of balloons.  Is this a big deal? not for me, it will prolly get very little airtime on CNN, because they are too busy Bush-bashing. On FOX it may be another story, especially on the O'Reilly Factor (Did I mention how big of an idiot Michael Moore(an)&nbsp; was during that interview), since Bill is a fairly hard republican, he himself evens out the partisanship on the cable news networks.   More on the Michael Moore interview in a later Post.

      Title speaks for itself, I have to say I'm not surprised, seeing as going into the DNC he was already the nominee, but just because, the delegates have to vote. Time to jump on a bandwagon ladies and gentlemen, or not...   More to come later, I'm tired.

        I may not be the nominee, but I can tell you this: For the next hundred days, I’ll be doing everything I can to make sure that John Kerry and John Edwards take our country back for the people who built it. Because tonight, we’re all here to represent the Democratic wing of the Democratic party.  I’m proud of John Kerry’s leadership, and I intend to stand shoulder to shoulder with him as we fight for the things Harry Truman promised in 1948: health insurance for every American, a real jobs plan to create jobs instead of destroy them. Standing up for middle class and working Americans who got a tax increase, not a tax cut. And a foreign policy that relies on telling the truth to the American people before we send our brave American soldiers to fight in foreign lands.   I’d like a commander-in-chief who supports our soldiers   and our veterans, instead of cutting their hardship pay when they’re abroad, and their health benefits when they get home.      HAHAHAHA, *gag* *cough* *weeze* HA!   Ok, back to why I posted this. Howard Dean is saying that John Kerry should be President because he supports our troops. This is why I'm laughing:   Voted NO on $86.5 billion for military operations in Iraq & Afghanistan. (Oct 2003)   Source:  urlLink http://www.issues2000.org/John_Kerry.htm       &nbsp;

      Let's start out with this, I dont like John Kerry, I think he can never make up his mind, and just says what you want to hear, sure,&nbsp;h makes a good senator with that attitute, but I dont want someone like that leading our country. Also, I believe Kerry and Edwards are putting way to much effort into their image, sure, that will work a little bit, but if they talk more about what they are going to do instead of just being "not Bush", they would get a lot farther. There is a very large Anti-Bush group out there, so that may be what they are going for, but if your just voting Anti-Bush, why not vote independant, or not vote at all.  I am also not a Bush fan either, he has made his fair share of mistakes while in office, some of the major things ive noticed in the recent weeks, before we are even done in Iraq, he starts asking if Iran was involved in 9/11. He needs to finish one thing before jumping into something else.  Being the first Politcal political post, I should give another disclaimer: I am going to piss off a lot of people, thats what I'm going for, I want people to think, not just eat what is spoon fed to them from the media.
