      what a tiring weekend.   there was a little going-away party for a friend of mine on friday. i was only able to attend for a little while, totally undercover since i'm still in the doghouse, and i didn't get to enjoy the after-party. i guess i was missed, because my cell never stopped ringing. the bastards just had to rub it in my face all night, and i know i'm going to hear all about it all day.   but at least i was able to see her off, since i don't have any idea when we'll all be able to hang out again. i was also fortunate enough to speak with her for an hour just before her flight.   on saturday, the wife and i hosted our first real dinner at our place, for our parents and relatives. it also marked the first time that the place looked decent. but damn, it was loud. filipinos, food, drink and karaoke are a volatile combination.   then on sunday we had to be at church at 8 in the morning. i didn't even know 8 am existed on sunday. then we watched a couple of movies at home to chill, a little pearl harbor and some mystery men before we hit the hay...  and now it's monday...

      that superstar usa show is absolutely hi-larious. it hurts so good to watch this show; like watching those funny home videos where a guy gets squared right in the jewels. painful, yet surprisingly funny.  so they found their constestants, and just like in idol, they give them a quasi-makeover. they ask: "who would like to look like? who should we pattern your image enhancement after?" then this guy, i can't remember his name - skinny guy, spiky hair, and he's really, really, really, really not straight. heh.  anyhow, they ask him the question, and he answers: "i really enjoy the style of britney spears and try to emulate as much as i can. but i can't be too risque, because, well, i'm a guy." the judges are pretty much pissing themselves, how they maintain such a straight face is absolutely beyond my comprehension. the female judge (who i think is vitamin c, i haven't been paying that much attention), says "well, i think you could be twice as risque as britney. after all, she has two areas she has to cover. you only have one." you should have seen the face on this guy; and then when he came out in his get-up...i won't even try to describe it. *shudder*  as for the singing part - hoo boy. there's the latina girl who sings like she has mush in her mouth (i only caught the word borderline the entire time she was singing), there's ross/rose the slightly ambiguous and high pitched singing wonder (he/she actually has a decent singing voice). there's the trashy girl from minnesota who can't memorize lyrics if her life depended on it. and then there's nina diva. Can't remember the rest, and i fell asleep on the sofa watching this. but i am officially hooked.   as for today: a good friend of mine is leaving on vacation today, and when she returns she'll be starting her new job at another office within our company. i'm sad to see her go, but i'm glad that she's out of that mind-numbing job she had. and there's always email. still...  and i'm wearing a pink golf shirt today. why my wife still lets me leave the house dressed the way i do, i'll never know.

      i've only been adjusting vehicle claims for about a year, but this is what i've observed:  -language translators have just a good a grasp of the english language as the people they are translating for  -old people are always amazed that i can speak "good" english - for a foreigner  -everyone always mistakes the "v" in my name for a "c"  -any car older than 1988 or is not immediately seen on the road is deemed a "classic", "antique" or "rarity", never a "piece-of-shit", "deathtrap" or "rustbucket"  -everyone's car is in mint condition and has low mileage, no rust.  -it's never their fault. i mean, if i was driving at 80 on the highway, in rush hour, in the middle of the worst snow day of the winter, driving with summer tires, i've done everything i could have done to drive as safely as possible, right?  -claimants seems nice up to the point we talk about money. nothing like 80-year old grammas saying, "listen fucker, i paid $36000 for that car four years ago..."   -people always assume that their problems are my problems. see example above. my response: "well, i'm sorry you got ripped off by your dealer, but..."  man, i can't wait till i move over into injury claims...if i'm not cynical enough now, give me a year in there.

      i'm still not used to this whole marriage thing.  actually, that's not really fair to say. i just messed up big.  i was supposed to take my wife out on friday in gratitude for letting me out on the thursday with my crew. but on friday, since it was a long weekend, my friends wanted to do something right after work, and because i have the best decision-making skills in the world, decide to tag along. needless to say, my wife was not amused because i was late, i had kept her waiting, chose to go out with my friends instead of her...you get the idea. i had smoothed things over that night (two dozen roses always helps, so does a lot of ass-kissing), but it was a hot topic all weekend.   looks like i'll be spending less and less time with friends - i had the lockdown all weekend. i know that was bound to happen, but it'll take some getting used to, especially since a lot of my high school friends are coming back from university. but i guess it's one of those sacrifices you have to make. really trying not to bitter about it, but...  friday aside, it was a productive weekend. almost finished a complete cleaning out of the apartment, readying ot for this saturday. hosting our families for dinner, to show them we're not a charity case.   as for the rest of the week...who knows what the future holds?

      *groan*  going out on thursday night is not such a good idea. especially when you don't have the day off tomorrow. or when you have to wake up the next day at quarter to 6 in the morning to catch your bus. i guess the allure of $1.50 drinks was too much for me to deny.   at least i didn't have any rye. the last time that happened, i threw up, passed out, and woke up to someone attempting to teabag me. to the uninitiated, i will explain what a teabag is another time. damn, that was a good bachelor party.  and at least i didn't leave the club thinking i was a sexy beast. then again, wearing a lavender striped shirt doesn't do much to attract members of the opposite sex. maybe that what my wife had in mind when she okayed that decision. at the very least, my girlfriends (no, not those kind of girlfriends) liked it...  (on a side: is it okay for a guy to use the term girlfriend in a strictly platonic way?)  then on the way home, after dropping off my drunk copilot/navigator/backseat driver/human entertainment system, some lady absolutely loses it on the road after running over a raccoon. while the raccon didn't make it, her car blows its front tire - she loses control and hits a barrier on the curb side of the road, spins, then her intertia carries her backwards onto the road. being a nice guy, and considering my work background, i pull over to help them out, to make sure that both of them are all right, if they need me to call a tow truck, help them change the tire. but the her guy pretty much tells me to get lost, saying he's got everything under control, even though it seems that both of them are in shock. looking back in my rear view mirror, i could see that all they were doing was standing around the car, doing nothing. i know that no one likes to lose face, but...  anyhow, that's my thursday. for the weekend, the wife and i were thinking of going to home depot. looking at some wallpaper, some bathroom stuff...don't know if we'll have enough time...

      i've finally been drawn in. enjoyed reading these things so much, that i thought i'd join in the fun. i've picked a fine time to do it too...  disconnected from my isp because of my new move, partially because i couldn't afford paying for all three of cable, internet and my cell, and mostly because i would rather throw my dispoable cash at something that i would use on a more consistent basis. and i've also found a way to mess up my computer - acidentally deleted some important shared files while i was deleting and reinstalling a new printer and its software. never try to split your attention between a delicate computer setup and a slightly peeved wife. guess who wins.  speaking of wives, i got married just recently. i think this blog will come in especially handy as a way to vent. i think my multitude of single and unattached friends can only give me so much advice...  and if you're wondering how i'm posting without a home internet connection...well, let's just say that work isn't exactly pouring in right now, and when i do get to work, i'm pretty diligent. besides, i can only talk to so many idiots in one day...  so how's that for an intro?

      a couple of friends at work just ended their several-month long office romance. i can't get into specifics as to how long they were seeing each other - all i do know is that for something they wanted to keep on the low-low, they were highly conspicuous. damn, don't even get me started on their drinking - these guys were up and down so many times, i lost count.  to cut to the chase, she wanted commitment, he didn't, but she stayed on hoping that he would eventually commit. he just went along, enjoying the ride.  ahem - so to speak.  so they broke up this weekend. a whole bunch of reasons were thrown about as to why she didn't want to stay. then a couple of hours later, she asks to get back together, because she's not sure if she can find someone as good-looking as him again.   yup. good-looking. not good to her, just good-looking.   so as my respect for this girl recedes to new levels, i get wind that she's still trying to reconnect with him. this makes for a very interesting and awkward situation for the rest of us, as we consider both of them friends, and now we're forced to take sides.   to paraphrase mrs. lovejoy: "won't somebody think of the children?!"

      had the worst brain cramp ever.   i had changed my cell plan to what i thought was a $30 monthly plan that included unlimited weeknights and weekends. when i opened my phone bill this month, i had an invoice for four times my regular amount. so before i ream into a random rep from my provider, i check up my plan. it turns out i had chosen the wrong plan: i had chosen a plan with almost the same title and cost, but had only given me 150 minutes TOTAL. i managed to use 550 minutes, thinking i had free minutes.  sweet mother of fu...  my only bright side is this: at least i saved on my international, long distance and romaing fees. and i wasn't an ass. to anyone, i mean.  damn. good thing i pay for my own cell phone, on my own credit card. gonna have to keep this on the low-low from the wife.   one foot in, one foot out...

      ...has taken its toll on me.  sorry, last song i heard this morning. the commute was hell today. man, i only drive one day of the week, and i get burned everytime. at least i have a soccer game, although my gimpy ankle is even gimpier thanks to my overzealous attempt to improve my tennis game.   i should probably be working. probably.

      you never realize how sheltered your life is until you begin to live on your own. and i'm not just talking about distance. i'm just starting to bear some of the hardships and make the decisions that my parents have strived long and hard to prepare me for. now everything's catching up to me.  this all began when my wife and i were pre-approved for a mortgage. it's not that much, considering that i'm still paying off some school debt and collectively, we have a bit of a hole from our wedding and planned honeymoon/vacation. but the amount is good enough to by a decent home. we now have to ask ourselves: do we buy a condo or a house? if a house, should it be a townhome, semi or detached? how big should this house be? where is our place going to be? should we buy now while prices are still relatively down and incur a larger debt, or wait it out a bit until we increase our earning potential but suffer in terms of higher prices?  so many questions.  dude, i'm only 25. i had planned to be married around this age, but never had i considered all the indirect consequences. i have to plan for the day i have kids. plan for the day my parents get too old or sick to live by themselves. my plan only a few weeks ago was to go to cancun in august. that was pretty much it. oh, and to get my sweet ride in a year and a half.  maybe i'm just stressing myself out needlessly. after all, it's not like there's a pressing need for a larger home. it's not like there's a kid or two on the way...  or is there?...

      had a sweet friday - was still in training so i had practically no work to speak of. then went out with the wife and some work friends for dinner and dancing, which was a minor miracle in itself, considering my wife is not their biggest fan. but they all got along so well; they were chatting the night away.   the only downside was our uninvited guest.  another colleague from work, someone unfamiliar to the rest off us had decided that since we were already headed downtown, she would ride along with us to meet her friends. not that she asked; i guess it was inevitable that she would be riding with us. when we got there, did she offer to pay for parking? did she even say thanks for the ride? nope and nope. just takes off to meet with her friends.  so we're having dinner on the patio, because that's the only place people can smoke now, when she comes back up to the patio. she was not allowed into the club where her friends are because she was still wearing jeans and sneakers from our casual work day. who goes to a club wearing jeans and sneakers? at any rate, she decides to join us.   she is loud and obnoxious. as the night progresses, she only gets louder and more obnoxious. she doesn't offer to buy anyone a drink. everyone is trying to avoid her, especially when she starts dancing. and she drinks. and drinks. like a guy. we all end up leaving early for various reasons, but i think the maind reason was that no one wanted to be the one to drive her home. we would have stayed until last call since we knew the bartender, but we couldn't stand it.  i think that was probably the best night of her life. i'm dreading having to talk to her this week.

      tennis, anyone?  gonna play some tennis this weekend with the wife and some friends from work. i have never played tennis. ever. this will be the funniest saturday morning. but hey, i'll at least look like i know what i'm doing. got the nice shiny racquet, the wristbands, the headband, white tennis shirt - i'll look decent enough just up until i hit that return over the fence.   sounds like a kodak moment. i'll have to bring the digicam.  stay tuned. i learn how to play golf next weekend.

      i've been fortunate enough to have been included in these week-long workshops that my company is hosting. while i appreciate the week off from doing any actual or intensive work, i happy to have been given an opportunity to learn a little something about the field i really want to get into. it's one of my company's new intiatives, to cross-train select individuals to fill demands across the office. hopefully, this'll lead to a new job, either at this company or at different one. but preferably here.  had a meeting with a financial advisor, one of our family friends, last night. i was kind of expecting him to sell us something as these kind of visits lend themselves towards that direction. but he just gave us a bunch of good advice on how to bank, what kind of things to avoid, and made us really consider our plan for the future. i now see that there's no way i'm going to balance my frivolous needs (mazda rx-8) with my needs (a house with room for my future kids and our parents).   i feel old. but happy.

       nothing like a government-mandated long weekend to rejuvenate the system...      gonna check out "the village" tonight. hope it's a good one. i wonder what his surprise ending will be? truth be told, i'm more interested in seeing "harold and kumar go to white castle". nothing better than a stoner film. but since i chose the last one, it's the wife's call this time...      i'm not even sure if she should see that movie, since we're planning to visit my folks up in their cabin the following day. that place could have easily been the location for that movie - they don't have any power, running water, and they're surrounded by acres of trees and thick underbrush. i haven't heard a peep from my parents since they went up there, so i'm eager to check up on them.       upon our return on sunday, i think i'm going to hit the driving range. got a big golf day lined up with some buddies next week, so i want to get some practice in. my buddy's girlfriend-of-sorts is going with me, so we can learn (ie. look like a pair of losers) together. we have a little wager going on, to see who can get offered a free hands-on golf lesson. man, i hope she wins. * shudder * i promised her that i would act as her jealous boyfriend if things get out of hand.       and now, only 40 more minutes until i escape this desk.       i have the same scene from starsky and hutch paying over in my head: "get me a (some drink i can't remember). do it. do it. (pause) do it." i think i've just adopted a new catch phrase.

       i've managed to catch a cold in the middle of summer. mind you, we haven't been exactly been getting typical summer weather as-of-late, so i think i can attribute this cold to the elements. damn you, mother nature!    &nbsp;  while i was home sick, i was pondering how the recent weather sort of reminds me of the movie "the day after tomorrow". and yes, i know it's only a movie, and highly improbable. but i remember a time this "summer" when i was driving just north of the city, and i was facing some crazy-ass weather. it was hailing, rain was coming down in sheets, and the clouds in the sky...i've never seen a funnel cloud before, but lemme tell you, it didn't long to recognize one and simultaneously run for cover.     &nbsp;  as for my cold: well, besides the migraines and the dizziness, it's not too bad. i just can't make any sudden movements, which pretty much rules out doing a lot of things. just need to get better enough so i can practice some golf, so i don't look like&nbsp; a complete hack when i'm golfing with my supervisors and directors.     &nbsp;  one bright side to today: someone asked me if i was working out, they noticed that my back and shoulders were getting broader. i personally haven't noticed anything or been doing anything different lately, so it definitely made my day...

       this past week has been crazy. the wife's been sick, which is odd considering the weather we've been experiencing lately. jokingly, i remarked that she was pregnant, and it struck me odd that she didn't laugh it off. that was early on this week.    &nbsp;  then last night, as we were lying in bed, i asked her again if she was pregnant. she goes on to recount all these symptoms - morning sickness, fatigue, etc. i was kind of taken aback - until she mentioned that she hasn't actually been experiencing ANY of these symptoms, just her cold messing with her...    &nbsp;  what was even more suprising was my reaction - i was actually happy to hear that she might have been or could have been pregnant, unusual because i can just barely tolerate children, and we hadn't been planning on having kid(s) anytime soon. am i getting mellow(er) in my old age? LOL    &nbsp;  i guess all the people who are rooting for us having kids are going to have their wishes granted sooner rather than later...    &nbsp;

       ...i wash my hands clean.     &nbsp;  the events of the past week make me wonder: why does everyone around me have so much drama? i guess i'm speaking in relative terms, because i really have none to speak of. is my life that much more inherently stable? am i just fortunate enough to make the right decisions at the right time?     &nbsp;  i mean sure, i have the usual and common gripes, mainly about work (because it often sucks) but&nbsp; i have no immense philosophical, spiritual, or emotional things to debate. i don't think i'm bland, but jeevus - it makes me wonder if i'm doing anything wrong LOL    &nbsp;  new topic - so i've been married for almost three months now, and we have not yet had a proper honeymoon. well, in terms of actually going away somewhere. but right now it's so low in the list of priorities. personally, i don't see why i need to go somewhere warm right now, when it's already hella warm over here. i would prefer to go in the winter, but i'm sure if we find the right deal (read: last minute specials) we would probably jump all over it. but before then, gonna need to take care of a few things, mainly hitting the gym again (the six pack is slowly melting away, confirming my observations about skinny guys who get married - they end up getting fat), and hitting fake-and-bake, so i have a nice base tan. nothing's worse than showing up at the beach with the farmer's tan. even worse, i think one of my arms is already darker than the other from when i drive.     &nbsp;  the main thing that concerns me - what of the magnum trust fund? we're only three months away from that&nbsp;ride, and i'm already burning to drop the hammer on that sweetness, baby. i think my dad's itching for a ride too - surprisingly, he hasn't jumped down my throat over choosing to buy a car which even i may concede (rarely) is a bit excessive.     &nbsp;  heh. but you know how i do.    &nbsp;   &nbsp;

       *sigh*    &nbsp;  just looking at all the available work out there, and what a similar job is paying at other companies, is starting to upset me. there are only a few things that are holding me back - i have a greater potential for career advancement where i'm working now. plus, i have a great bunch of friends here that i would be sorry to leave. don't get me wrong - i love my job, and i consider it a tremendous blessing.&nbsp;but after being spurned the last couple of promotions, it sort of disheartens you.     &nbsp;  so this is the pact that i've made with myself: if&nbsp;i don't get the promotion by the end of the year or end up at a more respectable salary mark, i'm outta here. that leaves me five months, a period in which i've already applied for another position within the company, and also where i'm due for another increase.     &nbsp;  things don't sound too bad. but considering the recent restructuring in my own company, maybe a change in scenery will be a sort of pre-emptive strike against future unemployment...

      ...it means i still have a job where i can mooch off the internet.   couple weeks ago, some people from my department got laid off. i had seriously thought that i would have been one of those unlucky bastards, considering what a miserable month of work i put in - all those hours, and less-than-spectacular results. it was kind of odd really - my company has been posting profits lately after a huge restructuring. they said that the work wasn't there to justify all those bodies, although most of my colleagues believe that the firings were performance-related. i'm wondering when someone will wake up to the fact that all the people let go were visible minorities...  don't get me wrong, i'm not a fan of our litigation-happy environment, but it does make you wonder if there were any other considerations being made...  such is life. at least i still have my job. i'm not getting paid huge amounts, but it provides for my small family, and i can still do things like travel abroad, go on vacation, and buy a new car...  speaking of which: between december and february, the magnum will be mine. ricers beware - i'm packing a hemi.  ...  and beleive it or not, i actually missed blogging. how sad is that?

       saw  "the village" this weekend. what a disappointment. i know that with his films, he doesn't follow a genre's usual characteristics, so i was expecting some sort of twist that i had to figure out for myself. without giving away too much, he gives away the secret a bit too early, making the ending a foregone conclusion. and the other little twist near the end - it just makes the whole thing entirely implausible. word of mouth is going to kill this movie.       otherwise, the weekend was awesome. went to the driving range. had one monster drive, about 250 yards. if any experienced golfers read this, they would probably say "so what?", but for my first attempt at golfing, i'm going to cherish this little victory. unfortunately, this was the only drive of that distance; i ended up driving around 185-200 yards. but at least they were all heading the direction i intended them to go. however, i think i should have got a glove- i ended up with a blister the size of a dime on my left thumb. i should have known better, considering that i usually get blisters whenever i play baseball.      and i just realized that's going to be  a short month. short week this week, as well as the next. then i leave for vacation the week after, destination unknown. don't have a passport yet - i've been draggin my feet on this one - so our choice of places are a bit limited. not that i'm complaining - as far as i'm concerned, a week of vacation is a week of vacation.      on a side, we started looking at houses officially this weekend. this is some scary shit - i feel years older just thinking about it. and i still can't help feeling that my new car plans are going to be sacrificed. is that so bad?
