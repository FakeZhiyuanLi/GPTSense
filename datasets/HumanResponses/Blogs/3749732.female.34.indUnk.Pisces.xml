						   UPN has released a new show that is one of only two reality shows that has interested me (and the other, "Queer Eye for the Straight Guy" doesn't really qualify as a reality show). It's called " urlLink Amish in the City ," and it brings together five young Amish people and their six "city" peers to live in a house in the Hollywood hills for a while. The Amish youth are all taking part in a rite of passage their community calls "rumspringa," a Pennsylvania Dutch term that means "running around." During this time, Amish teens are permitted, at age 16 and older, to move away from their homes to encounter the outside world and decide if they want to permanently commit to the Amish lifestyle. The show premiered Tuesday night in a two-hour episode.  Of course, there has been immediate  urlLink reaction  to the idea, centering on how it will make fun of a religious minority (one that ironically won't see the show since the Amish do not use electricity to speak of). Criticism that included a statement signed by several Penn. politicians, the leader of whom hadn't seen the show. But if you saw the Tuesday premiere, you might disagree. In fact, the people who really look stupid in this show are the "city kids." Not only do they initially make fun of their Amish peers--including the gay kid who made a point of saying in the intro. that he can't stand anyone who doesn't accept people--but they often seem to be almost impossibly ignorant. Take Ariel, the vegan from Cali.; one minute she is telling people that she thinks cows originated in outer space and the next she tells Mose, an young Amish man, that eggs are chicken abortions and that Abe Lincoln probably died at age 35 from eating too many. Mose for all his old world manners can't help but laugh at her.  There are some touching scenes, too. The best is when Ruth, Mose, and the others gets their first glimpse of the ocean. Ruth in particular has been dreaming of this for years and has only seen pictures of the ocean. To be sure, there are lots of other people in America who haven't seen an ocean, but somehow her childlike delight when she finally gets there seems unique. (Mose has to be rescued from the waves by a lifeguard, but that's another story.)  For a more detailed look at rumspringa, there is a documentary called " urlLink Devil's Playground ." But on Tuesday nights you can take an hour out of your evening to see the UPN version of cultures clashing without suffering through the antics of Paris Hilton!

						   OK, in theory I like the idea of a blog. It's an online journal of sorts where I can keep track of my life and let other people check out what I'm doing and comment. But I've surfed some other blogs and they are way better than mine, especially because lots  of people post comments (not that I'm asking for gratuitous comments). Plus they are so well formatted and have other interesting links.  I hate starting something and then having it be half-assed like this. Well, maybe once this crazy apartment starts to look better, and once I've had more sleep by getting used to the insanely noisy street below (that's Broadway), I can devote more time to making this blog appealing.

						   While surfing the web to find my textbooks at low prices, I discovered much more important information. JK Rowling's next book has a title:  Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince . Exciting! No idea when it comes out, but the title sounds delicious!

						   OK, so I know I should be happy that I am missing the traffic nightmares associated with the Democratic National Convention in Boston, but I feel like I'm missing out! This is the convention I'm (kinda) interested in but here I am in New York where the Republican convention will be coming later this summer. Oh well. Luckily I have cable and can listen to NPR to see what I'm missing, like Mrs Heinz Kerry explaining to us why women can have opinions too. Hmmm... maybe I'm not missing much after all. ;-)

						    BASICS   My first retreat will certainly not be my last. I highly recommend a retreat as a way to step out of daily life and reconnect--with God, with yourself, with nature, with whatever greater good calls you back to the true center of your being. I made my retreat at the  urlLink Campion Renewal Center  in Weston, MA (see  urlLink my photo  of the building; their website is awful).  This was what's called a guided retreat, meaning that there is a director who makes one or more presentations each day to a group on a certain theme. In this case it was "God Wants Our Friendship." This is in contrast to a directed retreat, in which the retreatant meets once or more a day with a spiritual director and spends the rest of the time in prayer. (Or you could have a silent retreat where you just do your own thing.)   Our schedule was breakfast at 7:45 am, first presentation from 9-9:30, lunch at 11:45, second presentation from 2-2:30 pm, liturgy at 4:45, and dinner at 5:45. Can you see how much spare time this leaves... ?! I had a tough time filling it all, but by the third day I had learned that not every single free moment needs to be spent in prayer. Then I was able to take long walks (at Walden Pond, for example), read, and meet other people. OK, I snuck into town once or twice, too, to get snacks.    PRESENTATIONS   I really liked our director  urlLink Fr. William Barry  and cannot do justice here to the eloquence with which he presented his ideas and suggestions. The talks centered on the readings--some from scripture, some not--and music that he offered to expound on his themes. He had a way of explaining Bible passages that was a new pleasure for me, someone with no formal religious education. And the other readings he presented were in turn funny or sad. He shared experiences from his own life and those of others, including battles with alcohol and sickness as well as conversions. The music he chose was terrific and included everything from the Boston Camarata to Loreena McKennitt. And he read the Parable of the Prodigal Son in a way that made me cry all over again.  He began the week by discussing how much God wants our friendship. What's important, he said, is that not only does God love us (we kind of expect that) but he really  likes  us (not as easy to see somehow). So he suggested that we pray with that in mind and try to have a good conversation with God, being sure not to skip over the negative feelings we might have toward this Friend. Later he talked about the obstacles that come between us and this friendship; he spoke about fear as chief among these obstacles. And he also touched on discernment. I found him to be a sincerely sweet man, with a very straightforward approach and a maddening way of not answering your questions (more on that later). At first, he didn't talk as much or as long as I wanted, but when it was easy to think back and reflect on what he had said and to chew on it during the quiet times.   PEOPLE   I met some lovely people on this retreat, foremost of course being Fr. Barry. He made time for us to meet him individually, and I did that twice, once for 15 minutes to get tips on my first retreat and again for 30 minutes to talk about issues in my life and about discernment. He was always truly present during these times, especially the second, and is a great listener. Trouble is, that's most of what he does--listen! He didn't seem to want to give advice or to comment much. I thought this was just God's way of telling me to find my own answers, since I tend to like to get them from other folks. Then...  I went to the retreat lounge one evening to get a soda and found the three Carmelite nuns there who were on the same retreat. One of these sisters was 85 years old and from Italy originally. I started chatting with her about the old country and then the two other (young) sisters joined in. We came to find out that all of us had been to see Fr. Barry and all had had the same experience: He wouldn't answer our questions! He just sat there and looked at us and said things like "that's a good question." I thought maybe it was his training as a psychologist. At any rate, we all had a great laugh over it together. One of the sisters has also thought it was just her, so we were glad to have compared notes. And we all agreed that we liked him a lot.  I met two other sisters on the retreat. One just moved to the Bronx to teach so I may see her again. The other lives in New England and asked me to write to her. She talked a great deal about herself and her health, but she was very sweet and seemed impressed that a layperson would take time out for a retreat. I think it was, as Fr. Barry said, a "vacation with God."  Well, looking back it feels like I am not conveying the power of the retreat. I did find some quiet time with God, including one good talk where I bared my soul (not that He doesn't know it all already). I did read some of the good books I brought (including Thomas Moore's  Dark Nights of the Soul ) and some that I found in the library when I needed a break (C.S Lewis's  The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe ). I did attend a healing service and was annointed, an amazing experience with many old and infirm Jesuits there who live at the Center. I did feel centered, which is all that I can ask. The trick is to keep hold of some of this peace now that I am back in my real life. I'll let you know how I make out.

						   My brother-in-law, Robert Zappa, got married on July 24. He's the baby of the family and when I first met him, he was just 16 or 17 years old! The wedding was at St. Mary's church in Melrose, MA, a lovely formal church, and the reception was at a golf club in nearby Stoneham. Here are Chris and me at the reception. I no longer have access to Photoshop, so you're seeing an unedited version. But you may be able to tell that my hair is a little redder than usual -- I got bored, but it washes out.  Everyone enjoyed themselves and danced the night away. Well, at least until they kicked us out at 11:30 pm.

						   The five days I spent at the Campion Renewal &amp; Retreat Center in Weston, MA, were just what I needed. It was what I imagine summer camp is like for kids: When you first arrive, you don't like it, but by the end you just don't want to leave. As I review my journal, I will post reflections on my time there, but for now I am including two photos. (I am new to posting images and haven't yet figured out how to format them well and allow viewers to see larger images.)   This first one shows a shot of the outside of one half of the building. It is a huge complex with two wings and a large chapel in the middle. The retreatants usually stay in one wing, and the other is for the Jesuits living there, many of whom are old or infirm.       And here is my own room. You can see my bed, wash stand, window, and a large desk that has several of the books I used on retreat. The accomodations were basic but perfectly adequate.

						   As of today, I am beginning my week-long retreat at the Campion Renewal Center in Weston, MA. I then go straight to Stoneham/Melrose for my brother-in-law's wedding. So look for me to post again later next week. By then my new laptop will have arrived, and I should be able to start posting photos! &nbsp; Peace.

						   I was a little late, but I finally got around to seeing the latest Harry Potter film: Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Saw it on Imax, no less! Well, here's the scoop and it's no surprise -- if you read (and enjoyed) the book, the movie is OK. But I imagine that if you didn't read the book, the film could be quite entertaining. It's always the way. If you're a fan of the book, then you notice things. Like Hermione shouldn't look so "cute"; I mean she's sweet but also a bit of a nerd and a bookworm, isn' t she? On the other hand, Harry is looking more as I imagine him -- kind of rumpled and stressed and smart. The 2.5 hour movie tries to pack everything in but only succeeds in skimming the surface, so you lose some of the nuances. I miss the actor who played Dumbledore in the last movie and has since passed away, but the guy who plays Snape is as greasy as ever. And Emma Thompson is perfect in a cameo role as Professor Trelawney. &nbsp; Ummm, I think I give it three stars out of five. Can't wait for the next book!

						   A quick response to someone who posted a comment: It need hardly be said but my favorite author is  urlLink Louisa May Alcott . I've read many others who are certainly considered more prominent in the literary sphere, but her books are like an old friend. I never tire of them, like to revisit them, and often find something new there, and they make me laugh and cry (something that virtually never happens when I read in spite of my sentimental nature). So I'm not ashamed to recommend all her works highly, but especially Little Women and all of the related chronicles of the March family, as well as Jack and Jill, Eight Cousins, and Rose in Bloom.

						   Many thanks to my friends in IT at Harvard Divinity School for their parting gift of a sparkling red wine. I've never tried this kind of wine before andwas looking forward to it. Chris and I decided to go rather&nbsp;casual and pair it with a pizza. The wine -- a Pineto, Brachetto D'Acqui 2003 -- was delightfully fruity and bubbly. It was much sweeter than I expected, almost like a cooler of sorts, and it went perfectly with the pizza. This sparkling wine would be a good choice with any light cuisine, even dessert. And since it's lower in alcohol than most wines, it's great for any time of day or situation. &nbsp; So, cheers mates. Thanks again!

						   Well, I finally made it to NYC! Now let's see, how many things could go wrong with just one move? First, the movers were quite late, so late, in fact, that the parking permit I had bought for them expired before they arrived. Then, they go lost in Somerville and made me come find them and lead them back to Cambridge. They managed to get everything into the truck by 7 pm! (So much for reaching the City in time to see the Harry Potter movie.)  Today it took them 3.5 hours to get all the stuff in because... well, I think there were a bit slow, myself. But I was also not the one doing the heavy lifting. Anyway it is all in there with minor scratches. I am even managed to find a computer on campus that I can use, although I am probably not supposed to.  I won't have computer access for the next week or two, even. So I will post more when I return from my retreat at Campion Retreat Center in Weston, MA, and also from Robert's wedding (that's Chris's little brother -- how can he be getting married?! He's only 17! Oh wait, that's how old he was when I first met him.).

						   Got back last night from my brief weekend at  urlLink Kripalu , a yoga center in western Mass (across the street from Tanglewood). It was a gorgeous weekend! They've made some improvements to the grounds since I was there last year, including this great outdoor labyrinth. My room was perfect too (I splurged on a private room). If you ever go there and can afford a private room, I recommend #283; it is at the end of a hallway and overlooks the lake.  The workshop itself was just OK. The title was "Mind, Mood & Happiness," and it seemed like a good choice given my moods of late. But the teacher, a kind of Zen psychologist from LA, was a little beyond me. I don't have practice with making connections between my emotions and what I am feeling in my body, so he was often over my head. Plus I got an introduction to Gestalt therapy and didn't buy it. But overall, I am glad I went. It was good to get away and to get some ideas about starting a meditation practice of my own. Now, back to the packing... !

						   My intention with this blog, first and foremost, is to chronicle my new journey through graduate school. But I also plan to post other items of interest to me (and hopefully to others). I've titled it Pilgrim's Progress because that fits where I am in my life right now, and because I was first introduced to that book by my favorite author, who mentions it in one of her books.  Right off the bat, I have to say that I am taking some time off this summer to go on retreat and on vacation. Therefore, I won't be able to post much until I start school in early September. So, stay tuned! :-)

						   Wish I had time to do a full-blown review of the play last night in Central Park. It featured some well-known actors, including Jimmy Smits as Benedick, and Beatrice was played by that large Amazon woman from "Third Rock From the Sun" (forget her name now, but she was great). Aside from the silly fireworks that they set off at the end, it was an excellent production with plenty of wit and laughs, and of course a happy ending. For those new to Shakespeare, I highly recommend this play. The dialogue is easy to follow, as is the story.   NOTE: I am off on various vacations for a while, so most likely will not be posting until late in August. See you then!

						   I just returned from a long, but successful, morning and afternoon in Central Park. I now have tickets to this evening's performance of Much Ado About Nothing. The day started when I arose at 5:30 am to get to the park by 6. Once there, I realized things were looking good because there were only about 50 people in line -- compared to about 500 when I showed up yesterday at 9:15.  It was  so  cold, but with layers, hot chocolate, and the loan of a tarp from the nice women beside me, I stuck it out until they distributed tickets at 1 pm. (The weather has changed quite a bit from last week's heat and humidity.) I think my state of mind also made it easier for me to sit and wait, with no real desire to be anywhere else.  In just about an hour I read the entire first volume of the  Unfortunate Events  series by Lemony Snicket. It's good with a wicked sense of humor at times and although melancholy and tragic, seemed to suit me. I'm not the only one who thinks stories don't always have happy endings. The women "next door" asked me if I liked it. Turns out their friend, Daniel Handler, writes the series. They didn't care for one of his adult books and wondered if they should read this one. I said they should. I will definitely be looking for more in the series and thank my HDS colleague Chris Bower for making me a gift of this one.  Last thing to report is that in chatting with someone else (one of the ladies I met yesterday in line), I learned that the fund raising people at HDS were right all along. They always said that many people do not know that Harvard Divinity School is at Harvard. "How could this be," I used to think. Well I was wearing my new HDS sweatshirt, and my Shakespeare fan asked me if it was in NY. Horrors!

						   I waited in line from 9:15 am to 1 pm to try and get tickets for Shakespeare in the Park. Turns out the last person in line who got tickets was there at 8 am. I am seriously considering trying again tomorrow, although that would mean showing up closer to 6 am, because the play is one of my favorites -- Much Ado About Nothing. It didn't feel completely like wasted time; I chatted with some nice people next to me in line and read, but it would have been a nice way to spend the evening. Perhaps tomorrow.

						   Two poems shared with me by friends from  urlLink HDS .   The Guest House   This being human is a guest house. Every morning a new arrival.  A joy, a depression, a meanness, some momentary awareness comes as an unexpected visitor.  Welcome and entertain them all! Even if they are a crowd of sorrows, who violently sweep your house empty of its furniture, still, treat each guest honorably. He may be clearing you out for some new delight.  The dark thought, the shame, the malice. meet them at the door laughing and invite them in.  Be grateful for whatever comes. because each has been sent as a guide from beyond.  Jelaluddin Rumi, translation by Coleman Barks   i am running into a new year   i am running into a new year and the old years blow back like a wind that I catch in my hair like strong fingers like all my old promises and it will be hard to let go of what I said to myself about myself when I was sixteen and twentysix and thirtysix even thirtysix but i am running into a new year and i beg what i love and i leave to forgive me  by Lucille Clifton

						   One way to beat the heat, and to distract oneself, is to get out for the day. I spent today at Ringwood state park in New Jersey. It's quite an amazing park, offering lake swimming, a lovely botanical garden, two manors houses, and many hiking trails.  I was really looking forward to swimming in the lake. So what happens when you get your hopes up? Reality sets in. The lake is terrific, but you're only allowed to swim in a small, roped-off portion with lots of kids and camp counselors (see photo). As someone who spent many summer days swimming in a lake in upstate NY, this was tough. But the lifeguards weren't convinced by my arguments, so I stayed inside the ropes.   urlLink     The next stop was the  urlLink botanical gardens . These were my kind of gardens: lots of individual gardens with rolling lawns and hills inbetween. Some were formal and manicured, some definitely were not. Here are some photos with captions. I apologize for the poor quality. It was very sunny today, and my digital camera does not let me adjust for light settings. (You can click any of the photos to see a larger size at flickr.com.)   urlLink     Skylands Manor (closed today) is attached to the gardens, and this is one of the upper gardens just behind the manor house.    urlLink     A lily pad garden, also attached to Skylands Manor.     urlLink     A lovely white lily. I waited for a while to catch some of the carp in this picture too but to no avail.    urlLink     More lily pads and flowers.    urlLink     Purple pansies. :-)    urlLink     An arbor. Again, the bright sunshine does not do justice to the colors.    urlLink     No idea what the heck this is. Spooky, isn't it?    urlLink     This butterfly was so hungry that he didn't even notice as I got close for a shot.    urlLink     Uranus? What could make for a better picture?! Seriously, this is one of several markings with the names of our solar system's planets. They are spaced around the property in proportions from each other equal to their actual distances. This is supposed to give you an idea of how far Uranus is from Earth, for example.    urlLink     I indulged my romantic nature to take just one photo of the many cherubs and fauns all around.   The last stop for today was Ringwood Manor, the other house at the park which was open today for a tours. I had a private tour since I'm the only that showed up for the 2 pm time. I always love looking at old homes, and this one was fun too. I enjoyed seeing the old decorations, furniture, and paintings. For some reason, what sticks in my mind is one of the grandfather clocks in the house. It dated to the 18th century but still kept time, and on top of the clock was the image of an angel with a scythe -- it was the grim reaper, set there to remind us, perhaps, that time waits for no man. No photos allowed inside, but here are some from the grounds.   urlLink     Mr. and Mrs. Swan with their two "ugly ducklings."    urlLink     A small graveyard on the property, with typical sentiments on the stones (i.e., we're all going to die eventually).    urlLink     This one tells us the gentleman was born in Ireland and died here at the age of 30.

						   It must be a strictly New York phenomenon. Driving to the grocery store last night, a pigeon grabbed onto the car door on the driver's side and hung on for a ride all the way. Granted it wasn't on the highway, but I was still amazed that it could hold on to the side of the window all that time. It actually seemed to have trouble getting off and climbed up to sit on the top of the car for a while, even after the car stopped. I'm told this is not such a rare event. Wish I'd had my camera to capture its beady little eyes staring through the car window. Maybe it was just having fun.

						   OK, I deleted my previous post and am merging it with this one because I'm not done complaining yet. First, it is way too hot and sticky here! It doesn't make for good sleeping, or good anything. And as I mentioned, can't close the windows to block out the infernal din of the street because... you guessed it; it's too hot!  I miss Boston and everything about it. Which means my life there. I know that my life here is only about two weeks old, so I need to give it some time. (How much time?) But I'm lonely here, I'm too old to enjoy this much activity, and I'm so tired of adapting. Humans are very adaptable beings I'm told, but I don't want to be adaptable anymore. I want to be settled somewhere with my loved ones around me, the prospect of a family (if not an actual one), and I also want a little kitten/cat to cuddle. Can't have those things right now, so this is my whine for the day. Looking for a good kick in the pants if anyone cares to send me one.
