      Last night was pretty fun! Had my brother's B-Day party and hung out with the cousins, watched movies(always watching movies when we're with the cousins). Messed around, ate food, played games etc... After everyone left I ate some more and talked to people for a while, kat went to sleep and I was talking to Dane about Soul Caliber 2. We planned on playing it today but he got an idea for me to just spend the night and play it all night. So that's just what we did, he picked me up around 11:30... Went to his house and started it up, did single player until we figured out Link didnt' have to be unlocked(Dane's character). So we played PvP and he got his ass kicked, poor Dane couldn't get it... So we playeed SSBM and he kicked my ass, I'm just sorta at my skill limit for that game. He felt better afterwards... So around 2 we went to sleep. Woke up to a fog horn, that was nice*cough*... Got up around 8 and started Soul Caliber again, but this time he was even with me! That was strange, he got better over night... He kept throwing the dan bombs*twitch*. Anyways, we played a game out of 15 and he lost 15-13. We're about even though, it's sooo fucking fun!! So yeah, came back around 11, took a shower and har I am. That's good for now, buh bye...

      Christmas day was pretty quiet, it was a nice quiet though. Got up around 7 and was dragged out of bed by my brother, he was more exited than I was about getting up at 7 in the morning... But hey! It's Christmas! So yeah, got pretty much everything I wanted... The only other thing I didn't get was a CD my mom couldn't find. It's all good, umm... Should I bore you!? I suppose so... Anyways, I got a Gamecube controller, Soul Caliber 2(fucking awesomest game ever!), Akira on DVD, some nice ballpoints, a Nalgene bottle, the softest down blanket known to mankind, Eternity(Kat knows;D), a new chair(that doesn't tip forward), A MONITOR(of which I don't have to hit) and AN ALF PATCH!!!! YEEESSSS!!!!... Alf eats cats, hehe. Afterwards I had breakfast and set up my monitor*drool*... So not a little P.O.S., I feel better now. Then for most of the day I sat in front of my computer, played games and drew in Photoshop(fun!). I'm usually on my computer, but not for that long of periods of time. Been a long time since I have... Well I had fun, beat COD on Normal and am working on Hardened(hehe)... YEAH!! SOOO!! Made a flaming tree in Photoshop, that was fun... I just can't get it to look how I want, just like all the others I've made :\. Must mess around some more! Eventually we went to my cousins house for a Christmas dinner, my mom forgot a present so I had to run back down to my house and get it(don't mind, exersize is good). So we ate and messed around a little... More like sat and watched a movie while the adults got drunk off of scotch, yeah... There's a little Christmas cheer for ya! After a while I started to fall asleep so I just walked home, didn't feel like waiting... And I wanted to talk to Kat. I was walking and wanted to get there faster so I jogged, that was refreshing... It's fun to jog in the cold ;). That should be it for today, probably forgot something, oh well... Have to do a chore... at 11:30 at night, ttyl!

      Came back from Nate's yesterday, had so much fun. Played mostly BF1942, if not that then Savage(wierd but fun game) or COD(WW2). It was harder for Nathan when we left than anyone else, he misses Bend and all the friends he used to have. Least while we were there we had fun, that's what matters. Drive back was alright, Zak's mom was bitching for a while 'cause she had to wait for us... Yeah, that's too fucking bad, gee we're sorry... not... Yeah, so oh well, whatever. Afterwards when I got home I thought I wouldn't be able to see Katherine, it was sorta late etc... But she proved me wrong, so I went to her house and we extanged gifts. I got her a bobbly Patrick, a dragon figurene, caffiene and two itailian charms... One was of Spngebob and Patrick, and the other was a gold rose with emeralds and diamonds(she liked that one the most ;). She got me a CD/DVD of a really good stand-up comedian that I like, also 28 days later(fricking awesome zombie movie, she didn't understand why I liked it so much). I was really tired from staying up all night the night before so Kat and her mom were trying to get me to fall asleep... Now is it me or does that make no sense at all, falling asleep while your at someones house visiting them... My girlfriend none the less. So yeah, went home and watched the Dane Cook DVD she got me. Really funny, no clue how she found it. Didn't sleep as long as I wanted but oh well, maybe tonight... Probably not, considering it's Christmas. Anyways, that's all I can think of to write about atm... Yeah, it's not much at all, sry Kat. Kinda braindead right now. Merry Christmas!

      It's about 3:30 in the morning on Teusday, we're staying up the last night we're here. Probably end up sleeping in the cars on the way home, meeting Zak's mom somewhere to pick us up... I have no idea how we're going to fit all our stuff in her car. Don't think we'll be able to fit everything in the tiny little sports car... Oh well, whatever, it'll suck if it doesn't work out. Whatr you gonna do?... Having trouble staying awake, I'll make it through the night, just won't be a breeze. Drinking Mountain Dew... Been drinking it for a while, sorta stops working after a while, probably help a little... Just doesn't give me a caffeine high. Still playing games, gonna start a Freelancer server... |)u|\| r311y W4|\|7 70 p14y, |\|p!! Yeah, havin fun and stuff... Umm, want to type more. I have it in my head right now, just can't get it out for some reason or another.  Was talking to Katherine around 8-8:30 and things  seemed  to be fine. But suddenly out of no where she says shes gotta go and doesn't know or whatever, that was different... I tried to get her to talk to me before she left but she said her dad was yelling at her, I think it might've been a lie to go... :\ umm... yeah, so I'm kinda lost atm. Got really frustrated that she just left without saying anything else, hate it when people leave without explanation... Can't fucking stand it! Uhg, ok... So yeah, played some freelancer and now finishing this post. Ttyl...

      Got to Nate's yesterday, slept most the way then watched some of LotR: The Two Towers... Finally got there around 11, hooked up and played some games. Went to bed at 4 and woke up around 10, continued playing games... Trying to get more music, only chance for a while. Played CoD for the first time, I loved it and getting pretty close to beating it. Playing GunBound periodically, when nothing's really happening. Going to CompUSA tommorrow, dunno what I'm getting there but I'm getting something... Can't get my mind off Kat, no matter how deep into a game I am. It's a good thing ^_^. Three more days 'til I go back to Bend, gonna try to make the best out of 'em... Even though I'm kind of reluctant to now :\, wish you were here too... Going to get some more presents for my peeps, should have a good christmas when I get back. Hoping so anyways... Yeah, so drinking my Bawls... Writing in my journal, talking to Kat... She's having a really hard time, it's hard to understand her sometimes. I'll finish things up some other time, not in the mood right now...

      Time to post... Yeah, posting is good. Takes up room in my journal... The bad part about it is when I can't think of anything to post. So, crap... Hummm, where to start. Ok, think... So another day of school. THURSDAY!! Which means it's Friday tomorrow which is a fucking good thing, goin to Nathan's!!! OMFG!! GOING TO HAVE SO MUCH FUCKING FUN!!! AAAAHHH!!... Yeah, plan on picking up Kat during lunch, not sure if she'll skip C-Block but if not least I'll get to se her before I leave :). Zak's mom was supposed to drive us back to Bend from Portland on the 23rd but she backed out and we didn't have anyone to drive us. Luckily Nathan's mom is like the nicest person in the world and said she'd drive us!!! THANK YOU SO MUCH!! There's going to be some fucking serious gaming/caffeine consuming/DDRing/making asses of ourselves good times! So yeah, exited about that.  As for today, well... It was dayish, went to my house for the second day... 'cept we didn't eat lunch. I made breakfast... Made eggs, sausage, hasbrowns, toast etc... Yesterday it was really crappy but I skipped the mistakes I made yesterday, I haven't cooked since I was about 12... Just felt like cooking a cople days ;). Now I know I can, W007 :D... So after school went home obviously and made up the rest of Kat's presents, hehe. Played some Gunbound, went to Dane's and played some SSBM(got my ass kicked unfortunately). Came home, went to Katherine's Choir Concert... Was awesome, saw someone from the Germany trip. So yeah, that was it... Not a whole lot as usual but it was a day in the life of.....

      I want to post... There's lot's to post about, but I'm not really feeling that great... I had the best day ever! Don't get me wrong. But just started to go through some stuff I was looking at last night... I'll start with the good part of my day. So, after the long A and B-Block I went to lunch and talked to my friends a while, blah blah blah... Went downtown to buy Christmas presents for Kat and Adrian. I said where I needed to go so we went and Jen and I looked at Kat's present's and she helped pick 'em out. So down goes half of my wallet ;). Then we went to the Bento Bar and Jen got something to eat, then to the Bank... Went to get Adrians present's etc... Blah blah blah... After walking around we went back to Summit and met Dane, made up my costume(leave and a couple sticks). Off we went to MV to save Katherine, Sarah and Conley! We ran, almost got lost on the way and stopped by the japanese room... Then we crammed into Dane's car and drove off to LotR: RotK. That was a fucking awesome movie!! OMFG!!! So yeah, afterwards we went to Red Robin(crammed to hell and back). Then decided to go to Cibellis down near OfficeMax. Had dinner(which I payed for) and met this lady that sounded like she knew me... It was kinda creepy, and apparently I made a really funny face when she said, "go smoke another bowl"... I think she thought I was high 'cause of how I was acting, *shifty eyes* or she knew my past... Hummm. Yeah, soo... Anyways, after that we dropped Adrian and Jen off at the Old Mill and met Sarah at the arcade. There we played some DDR and took pictures in the picture booth, Katherine looked really funny in the pictures we had... Yep, just lost my train of thought... Oh well, that was about it for the good part... I was doing great until I got home and sat down at my desk, the articles and the picture of me where out on my desk from last night... I broke down last night after I started reading them and it just finally really hit me, it hit me fucking hard... I was afraid I was going to wake up my brother, then I left sooner than Katherine thought I would and freaked her out... 'Course she thought she said something wrong *rolls eyes*... Yeah, that's right, rolling my eyes at you! Anyways, it's come back down to me posting another paragragh of crap producing from my mind... ttyl  Oh yeah, and now I am down to about 1 dollar from 105 in one day... I love Christmas!

      Alrighty, so yeah... Goin to RotK tomorrow, gonna kick ass 'cause a crap-load of my friends are going... It'll be the single best thing to do for the week, with going to Nate's right behind it... Maybe... And, umm... If Katherine didn't read my journal I would say what I got her today, one of many things to come ;P Looked around downtown for anything anyone would like, found some cool stuff... Saw my wallet full of money and all the music at Boomtown... Must... Hold... Back!!! ACK!! But yeah, gonna have a fun Christmas Break, tons of fun! Back to tomorrow... Dane's going to run into Cannon's D-Block English class where Kat, Sarah and Conley will be and rescue 'em from him. I'll stand somewhere behind him with leaves taped to my sweatshirt holding up sticks(treant ;D). Gonna wake up early tomorrow and run to 7-11 to get a couple rockstars for the day... Need as much energy as my body can hold!! ACK! I'm so fucking sore from yesterday's D-Block, OMG... Could barely bend over to turn on the shower, uhg... hope it leaves by tomorrow, really probably won't... Oh well... So yeah... Um, theres more I know it. Fought with Dane some more today... The usual, 'cept annoying stupid people that follow Arron(fucking awesome) try to get in... Just not gonna happen, so me and Dane take 'em down in a second and continue. So fun! I've been trying to throw him outside but he catches his balance too fast, dam him and his balance... Anyways, umm... thinking of posting a Rage to give my Journal a little more... "interesting... things", been persuaded by Katherine to post it... 'Course, so yeah... Love you Katherine  This be a tired rage that I made sometime early in the morning(probably about 2-3)  uhg, tired... i wonder how i can be so tired after sleeping twelve hours straight last night, is there a reason... damn my tiredness, i just wanted to catch up from being at dads. this sucks, i just want to go to take a hot shower and fall asleep. but i cant do that, i have to talk to kat first, itd be wouldnt be very nice of me. cause i have to be nice or i might hurt someones feelings, and i dont wanna do that now do i... oh no, none of fucking that, be nice to everyone. cause if you change they'll all fucking hate you! ya, thats right, wouldnt want to dissapoint anyone. there will be none of that, DONT LET IT FUCKING HAPPEN!!

      Ok... What has happened since my last post, humm... Well,   talked to Katherine for a few hours and played Gunbound last night... Went to bed aound 12, got up around 9. Got a little further on my Halo game, then got stuck again. Sorta just waited for Kat to get up... She woke up around 1, thought we'd attmp to go to Gothika with Sarah... Didn't work out so well, so we went to Barnes & Nobel and hung out there for a while. After that we walked over to Blockbuster and rented Darkness Falls(demented tooth fairy, very different) and Silent Hill 3(strange Resident Evil look-a-like, has zombies with twitchy heads). Did all that and had some really good spare ribs Sarah's dad made. Then Conley came over and they planned out their costumes for the LOTR on Wednesday, their gonna look awesome and I'm gonna be with them. Ran around town, first to Kat's(had some conflict with her parents, I knew there was gonna be some argument of some sort), then to Sarah's mom's house(found some... dress bluerint or something), then the last place was the Wal-Mart fabrics section(by now it was about 8:30 and that's where I'd be 'til about 11). So they looked at all the fabrics, I helped by being patient and holding anything they needed to be held. They found out it was gonna cost a lot more than they had expected. Katherine had to leave early so Sarah went to the bank but the ATM wasn't working so Kat gave her 90 bucks to buy the fabrics... Then she dropped her off, the roads were slick as-fucking-snot. God, by the time we got out of Wal-Mart I knew it was gonna suck. We slipped a little bit, but then Sarah was going to fast and had to turn of the highway... Haha, she turned the wheel as far as it would go but the car just kept sliding and eventually hit the curb of the turnoff. No one was near us when it happened so it was alright, she just backed up and drove on. Yeah, so it was really fucking fun and was a good use of a Saturday!

      What a fucking day, the weirdest ass day I've had for a long while. Went to A and B blah, blah, blah... Went to lunch, haven't eaten all day... Probably should, maybe... Got to MV late 'cause Jen had to go to C-Block, went to Cibellis with Trevor, Adrian and Katherine... Had fun, made jokes etc... Felt like crap the rest of the day, made an idiot of myself... Drama sucked, didn't want to be there at all... Really tried to laugh but no, Jason didn't like that I wasn't in a good mood... Him and I always have fun in Drama, but yeah. Was doing alright 'til after C-Block, oh well... Ups and fucking downs, have to deal with 'em. What a waste...

      Woke up before my brother today, what a feat it was... Yeah, how exiting is that. Went to school, A and B-Block... Same old 'sept I actually worked in both of 'em, that was a first. Had fun at lunch, went to my house and ate most of the cookies we had. Afterwards went to Trevors and made breakfast, he's a good cook. Had a lot of fun as usual, distracted him when he was driving... Honked the horn. turned the wheel, yelled at the livestock(grade school kids). It's the best look ever to see their terrified faces look over at the monsters driving by in the car ;). I had a Bawls bottle with me so people were stealing it and gripping it all through lunch. Then I poked everyone at least once with it, fun!  So yeah, hearing rumbles in my house now... Not sure what it is, just hope it's not a gremlin or a... Ack! now my lip is twitching, that's strange... Um... I think I'm going to sleep now, going to stop obsessing over Gunbound and get enough sleep for the awesome Friday in store for me tomorrow!!!!!! W007!!!! Can't wait 'til lunch, gonna have FUN!!! And they will act the same, why wouldn't they... Your crazy, you and your brain!!! Love ya ;)

      Things turned up from yesterday, today was a 2 hour delay! So I got to sleep in an extra hour then talked to Katherine and played Gunbound for a while... Went to A and B-Block, wasn't bad, I had energy to interact with all the others so I got stuff done. Carpenter didn't seem in the best mood so I didn't bug him today, yeah... Umm, then there was lunch... It was one of the more scaring than any others I've had. Not mentally but physically, me and Dane started to fight some more and he gave me indian burns as usual. But then I pulled him outside and I got whitewashed so I was cold all over. It wasn't the cold but the whole slapping my wrist as hard as possible that did it. At first it was just Dane so no scars 'cept for a little one on my left arm, but then Kenneth wanted to try(I was holding my arm out, I was letting them... I have issues). Anyways, I had him wait for my arm to get feeling again and he slapped as hard as he coud(he's really fucking strong, looks kinda like a dwarf). So after that my arm was all purple... I think he popped a few veins in my arm, but now I've got his brand on my wrist... He felt guilty after he looked at it, so yeah... FUN!! Then Zak decided I was masocistic, from what I was letting them do I might be... But I don't know, anyways... Went with Trevor and Adrian and ate some hotdogs and cookies at my house. Had fun with them, Adrain pretended to be a Pokemon and attacked Trevor... He kept evolving into different Adrians. FUN! ONCE AGAIN!! Then I went to Drama 2, had tons of fun in there. We played games and I made an ass of myself more than most but they all thought it was funny so yeah... That's all I've got for now ^^.  Congratulations to Katherine figureing out the message! It was unexpected... I love you Kat!

      Hooray! Ha d  a nice shitty day today, pr o bably just cause I was tired all day. I dra n k 3 packs of Emergen-C s t uff, wanted to wake mysel f  up but it just gave me a headache. So yay for that, and after I played 2 ho u rs worth of Gunbound(won like 2 games) I attempted to take some Advil but we didn't have any... No aspirin whatsoever! What kind of fu c king house doesn't have fucking aspirin, such bullshit! So I went to sleep and my brother  k ept turning the l i ght on before I was about to get to sleep, that just made my headache worse. Tha n k you Andy! Yeah, so I finally  g ot to sleep and d r eamt about some guy fighting a l i ttle dog 'til my brother woke me up again from jumping off his be d  constantly and having the T.V. blasting ZOOM! FUCK!! SO FUCKING SICK OF THAT FUCKING PIECE OF SHIT SHOW!!! He watches it every day, including the fucking R e ading Rainbow and fucking Cyber so m ething or other... Felt like smashing my h e ad against the wall. Stupid fucking T.V. shows, damned! After dinner I tried Gunbound again and just lost some more games, didn't help cheer me up at all. I really hate interacting with anything right now, can't even listen to music... That's not right !  The walls are looking real friendly right now. I wish I had better things to write about at the moment but there's honestly nothing happening right now, just want it to snow really hard for a week straight. That would make me feel better, wouldn't mind that at all. I love the snow, so many things you can do with it, including the snow ball fights *shifty eyes*.  I didn't laugh nearly enough as I wanted today, just that nothing was amusing to me. Something annoying I was thinking about just now is how I smile even if I don't want to... For example: If someone makes a joke that I don't think is funny I'll smile like it's funny, since they think I think it's funny they'll keep making the shitty jokes or whatever... I'l keep smiling, eventually I'll get so sick of their joke and smiling that I'll suddenly loose all character in my face. That's when they give me the look like,"asshole, who do you think you are... just don't laugh if it's not funny"... MY ARM STILL FUCKING ITCHES!!! GAAH!! *itch* I was itching it all throughout the schoolday, really annoying but I can't help it. It's on my wrist now too, not as much but it's still there and it itches as well. I won't say what it is 'cause then I'd give away something some might still be trying to figure out, don't know why they would but anyways... I can already tell this is going to be a really crappy week, but I suppose that alright. There a time for everything. Everyone has it, no one's being singled out by life...  That's what I really hate, how people think their life is so fucking worse than everyone elses... I give it to the ones who really do have it worse, but people that complain all the fucking time about anything they can get out piss me off. It's either for attention or empathy from others. That's one of my least favorite things in the world, sure it's good to get help... But fucking complaining about anything you can fucking get out is such bullshit, so fucking tiring to listen to someone complain about the smallest fucking things. With my personality I pretend to feel bad, I just zone out and whenever it sounds like they finish a sentance I reply with "uh huh" or "yeah, that sucks"... I understand completely when someone has an actual issue to talk about... Not about how far they had to walk, how hard it is to get something done, or any little, useless, uninteresting, stupid thing there is to complain about. I dont know if I did that in any of my posts but if I did than I'm so sorry I had to subject you to that, I probably wasn't thinking when I did... Just one more thing I really hate!  People that brag... *cringe* OH MY GOD I FUCKING HATE BAGGERS!!! I can't stand people that sit there and brag about shit, I would be so much more impressed if I jsut found it out by myself or if someone else told me... But when someone tells me there soooo good at something I just want to go off on them and smash their head on a door! Me... I hate bragging, makes me feel like crap... I don't mind if someone tells me I'm good at whatever(no shit) but I really hate telling someone I'm better at something than them or have more or what-the fuck-ever. Fucking bragging pisses me off, but then of course if someone's doing it I can't say anything... Just, "wow!" and "nice!" 'cause that's how I fucking am, FUCK!  So yeah, definitely wrote more than expected... Just some dislikes, might as well get them out eventually. By the way, there's a message in there... Find it and tell me what it says, I'll be surprised if one does. I WILL NOT GIVE ANY HINTS TO IT!!! Including you Katherine, sry ;)... You'll never find it!!

      Another day gone by, not much interesting unfortunately... Did the same stuff I usually do in school. Play games in Design Tech, then do half of my homework assignment in Math and draw the rest of the time. Oh ya! Hella fun, had a blast! Just been really tired lately, getting more sleep doesn't seem to help as much as I want. I skipped D-Block again, didn't have time to drop me off. So I messed around in Halo, caught up on Gunbound, got some gold etc... Now I have a killer headache, getting a little sensitive to lights. Just feel like going to sleep and not waking up for a few weeks. Also feeling some pressure behind my eyes, that's different. So yeah, just sitting here being tired and writing. I'd get more in if I could think straight, really would. Just missing Katherine at the moment :\... Oh well, I'll see her eventually. Just hoping it's sooner than sometime next week, if not that that's really gonna suck. Crap, ok... I'm done for now, I'll post again when/if I have more energy to think straighter. Cya.

      Here's a little short story I wrote a while ago, I was more fond of it than my others... I couldn't come up with a very good title though, hope you like it.  The Parting It was a cold autumn evening somewhere in the deep South, an old man walked down the rotting stairs towards the kitchen to fetch himself a glass of milk. The white paint was chipped from the long years of sun. Cob webs were strung across the chandeliers and stair case railing. Outside, the light brown grass begged for water. An old rusted swing sat unused after the event of a families death. The single tree in the front yard was hanging on to the last days of it’s life. Shutters hung on one hinge waiting to fall to the dead ground. The old man was the last of his name. His droopy eyes made him look as if he were to be forever mournful. He had long bony hands and dry wrinkled skin. The only thing in goo shape was his business suit, it was never taken off. He was an easily agitated man and the things that happened in his mansion did not help to mend this trait. The old man needed help to take care of the mansion, but he had none. The only help he had were the social service workers that brought him food every week, he refused to go outside. The old man walked into the kitchen, there was only opening to the kitchen and he was within it. There were butcher knives to his right lying on the counter. Dishes were strewn in and around the sink dirty with condiments from previous meals. He walked around the island in the middle of the kitchen and opened the refrigerator door. There was plenty of food, anything he wanted was most likely in the refrigerator. He reached for the milk and a glass from the cupboard. As he poured the glass he heard a loud noise, it was one of the many common things that occurred in his aged mansion. They had slowly caused psychological damage throughout the years he’d lived there, his sanity was on the brink. As he raised the cup to his lips the noise got louder, he was petrified. The old man dropped the glass. It shattered and cold milk spilled across the floor. He curled up into a ball in a corner of the kitchen, covered his ears and began to cry. He called out for his family, there was no response. There was no one there for him; he was completely and utterly alone. The screeching sounded of people slowly dying away calling for help just as he had done. The old mans ears were in pain from the high pitch shrieks, soon enough it started to die down and eventually it was no more. He sat in the corner crying hysterically from the event, he wondered how such a thing could exist. The old man, slowly and shaken, got up and took a breath. He could not handle these moments on madness. His sanity was destroying the rest of what was left of his life and he couldn’t support the burden. One foot on front of the other he walked out of the kitchen, subconsciously grabbing a butcher knife from the counter on the way out. He walked up the rickety stairs with a slouched posture, his face still wet from the tears. With the knife in his hand he dragged his feet down the dim hallway towards the study. As he walked down the hall its walls began to bleed out dark red blood, the large paintings of his family members glared at him. He heard footsteps above him coming from the attic. Light from the setting sun seeped through the windows lining the right side of the hall. The old man walked up to the study and opened the door with ease. He took two steps into the study and shut the door behind him. He sat dow at his work desk and stretched out his arm revealing the bulging veins under his thin skin. For a moment he looked around, he saw books neatly organized in the bookshelves, behind him was a fireplace and a mantle with a vase containing the ashes of his mother. Candles lit the study with a low glare, in the glare was the family he had for so long and lost so quickly. The old man thought of his life, what he had failed and accomplished, what he’d lost and found. He had skeletons in his closet he still hadn’t cleaned out, just like everyone else on this god forsaken earth earth. He lifted the knife to his open wrist lying on the desk, closed his eyes and ran the cold blade across his skin. The old man flinched when he felt the sharp knife slice his wrist. He opened his eyes, the knife was still dry, as was his wrist. He was too disoriented to notice what was wrong with this. He looked back up to see the faded ghosts, they were gone. He wasn’t understanding anything, he looked back down at his wrist and it was still dry. Frustrated and confused he yelled out for someone, he wanted to know what was going on. The old man heard a soft calm voice beside him, it was his wife. The specter reached out her hand and touched his wound, it then began to bleed ice cold blood. Finally he started feeling light headed and he saw doubles of his surroundings. The old man was gratified to leave his life of fear and resentment. He could finally release the burden of his sanity.

      Fun day today, woke up and was pretty tired but I got over that. Played Worms Armageddon in Design Tech, didn't get anything done like every other day and I still have an A ^^. Went to math and neither of my old friends were there, usually I'm the loudest one there always joking with the teacher but I guess I'm not like that when I have no one there to talk to... Nikita's...Umm... B-Day... I think, she got a bag with lolly-condoms(condoms with toothpicks taped to the side) and frog socks that ribbited when you pressed a button, so awesome! Made an ass of myself at lunch once again today, Zak and Ken helped out a little as well! I was just being my hyper self and they decided to do what always happens at least once a day... Pull the strings on my sweatshirt to tighten up the hood, wrap the strings around my neck and tie them in a knot. I ran around for a while constantly running into walls and people, eventually ending up outside... I had one hole that I had to switch between one of my eyes to see and my nose to breath, I got out once but they just held my arms back and did it again. Then finally they gave and I started fighting Jen a little, yelling and screaming etc. Fun! Ah yes, then came Dane, me and him started to fight 'til Ken broke us up and through me around for hitting the blue haired one... *sigh* I was having so much fun too, oh well... That's when Dane told me to come to LOTR with him on Wednesday, here it is... He's gonna dress up as link(sword, shield, white tights and all) and drive to MVHS after C-Block to steal everyone from their classes, he wants to pack as many people in him car as possible. It'll be SO FUN! Can't wait to see it...  Then of course after lunch I went with Trevor and Adrian to my house to eat hotdogs and my moms cookies, we had an ass slapping time! j/k, the only asses we slap are our own, MUAHAHA! Trevor's the kitty, always being a kitty, Trevor is also Adrian's creation... Trevor IS Adrian...And Adrian... umm, he's like a sex fiend that gets whatever he wants whenever he wants(sex-wise that is)... Then there's me, I'm the punisher/bitch who's never touched by anyone, hehe... Yeah, we have interesting times, really fun times, but interesting... Don't think we're... Umm, just having a threesome in the back of Trevors car, we are very not that way... We all just like to act it, 'cept for Trevor... He rejects Adrian... WOW! I am now really debating whether or not I should delete this part, you lucky if I haven't... That's enough of that subject... Don't think of me any differently after reading this, it's just how we are at lunch/C-Block... There's more to it than just that ^^...  No more for now, have something more important to do!

      Just beat Halo on the Hero difficulty, easier than the last time when I accidentally clicked it instead of normal. Had fun obviously, now I just need to beat it on Legendary and I will be content. Which game should I finish next? Humm, maybe Freelancer, or Shogun(I've beaten it on Normal, was about to beat it on Hard but it crashes after I finish the season I'm on... So yah, that sucks, I worked my ass off on that game too :*(... I'll start over I guess). There's also Elite Force 2, I am currently stuck on a part where I can't find where the hell I'm supposed to go. Ah and of course Homeworld, I'm stuck on the last level where you have to rescue a commander from a ship. In your way are like 30 Destroyers(pain in the ass) and 15 or 16 Battlecruisers(bigger pain in the ass) not excluding the enemy mothership with its own escort. Now that I come to think of it, I haven't even beaten half of my games. Sooo, ya... I need help, kind of obsessive about beating things... MUST FINISH!!! ACK!  It's amazing after I think about it how people lie so much just to get things to fit the way they want it, mostly even little ones. As long as the lie proves them right or makes them look a little better. Kinda sad how people have always been that way, it almost becomes a reflex to do so. Kind of makes me sick how we all, least the self conscious ones(a good chunk of the human population), lie to each other. There's no trust, yet if we had trust we'd have peace and with peace comes harmony. That is an impossibility in our world, unfortunately. I think before I talk after I thought of all this, if it is really worth it and if it will really change my life so much. Very suprisingly to me the answer is always "no", at least from the ones that I'd make. I really hate myself for what I do to make myself, again, look better or prove myself right. I wash I could go back and take them all back, there are so many that I know I've forgotten about because they were so small and useless, fuck, this is starting to really piss me off. I can't believe myself, how I could be so selfish about the little things that wouldn't have effected my life in any way, just that one second of the self concious high we all crave for 24/7. MAKES ME SICK!!  Just one more thing, kinda skims the same category of the last, I'm in that mood tonight. So yeah, about this country. Everyone knows this but I'm gonna talk about it anyways, it's the way this country lives off of fear. If you watch or read the news even in a small town there's always something on about a murder, rape, kidnapping, robbery, crashes etc... When the news stations have no new stories with any kind of fearful conflict they go to for example... Dangerous escalators, killer bees(they never got to Arizona), Y2K, Terrorism(big one, from what I know there wasn't any other kind of attack of terrorism after the Anthrax virus and they were still at it a year later), "video games can influence you child(ren) to kill(BULLSHIT! If you think your child is disturbed because of the fucking video games look at your kid, NOT THE FUCKING GAMES! your the fucking one that bought them the fucking games, it's them! not the fucking games!). Everyone knows this country is fueled off of fear, not everyone wants to believe it of course, in my eye it seems there's never going to be anything to fix that. Kinda sucks huh...?  I hope that satisfies all your journal reading cravings, sorry if it doesn't.

      Heya! It be 3 A.M. in the morning! It's the perfect time to post! Today was one of the better days of my week, glad it was. I woke up to the alarm for my brother to get up to the mountain. After that I fell back to sleep and was woken back up by my mom yelling at me to turn my computer off at night... "Andy turned it on this moring to get a CD", "Ya... well... turn it off!"... Anyways, went back into a half asleep state an was like that 'til 11, I was still pretty sleepy after that. Nothing a good shower couldn't fix ^^. Zak came by when I was in the shower, he had the Christmas parade to attend in his penguin suit. I showed him Gunbound and Halo, then he went back downtown around 12. Kat had gotten Adobe Premier day before yesterday and had no clue how to use it, so most of the day I helped her with her Health assignment. She didn't really approve of working on a Depression and Suicide project all day, so we went to a movie with Sarah and her dad. Saw The Last Samurai, it was FUCKING AWESOME!!! Andy was there with friends as well, I always end up seeing him at movies I don't expect to see him at. So we finished that at around 9, then we felt like renting some movies and staying up 'til 2 watching them(hence my posting at 3). We made a scene at the Food4Less, rode the merry-go-round and were out of there! We rented Terminator 3(awesome) and 28 Days Later(so fucking awesome!!! really gory and weird but really awesome... unfortunately Kat and Sarah didn't think so, they were just kinda grossed out by the guy getting his eyes gouged out). So yeah, almost ended up spending the night but Sarah's but her dad didn't want to deal with the other parents crap about letting a teenage guy spend the night with a couple girls, one of which is his girlfriend, very understandable. Oh well, no matter... I had a shitload of fun anyways, wanted to watch 28 Days Later one more time, think I'll just ask for it for Christmas... Kind of an awkward present but THAT'S OK!! It's a cool movie, there are the best zombies EVER in that movie. Yep, so... can't really think of anything else to say, kinda want to go to bed... Will after this last song, Good morning!

      Just got back from Jen's LAN/B-Day party, very much fun. Lot's of good games, everyone had good taste of games there... Would've been more fun if we had stayed the night, but oh well, can't have everything. My mind just went blank, crap this sucks... Must think! Damn TV always makes me go braindead. Um... Well I skipped D-Block once again, only cause I couldn't get a ride to the bowling alley(used to be mountain biking but it got too cold, so now the teacher decided that we would go bowling at the Sun Mountain Fun Center, W007!). Had Cibellis for lunch, needed that. Before that we(Trevor, Adrian, Jen and I) went to MVHS and talked to... I still can't remember his name, I should, I know him! Dam... Anyways, looked for Kat, apparently she was in the opposite hall of which I was. Still got to see her today fortunately ^^. After that we went to Barnes and Nobel and looked around, saw the "great" selection of Manga they had, actually pretty good. Had most of the Love Hina series, no Hellsing though which frustrated me... After Cibellis we went to my house for something to drink, they left me there since there wasn't enough time to drop me off at the bowling alley. So I played Halo and watched Kung Pow, such a funny movie... Very strange but very funny.  I had a nice talk with Kat's dad in the car when she was getting presents for Jen. It was interesting, he umm... Dare I say anything... He makes himself sound like a really good guy, but then again he's... I can't get the words out at the moment, too paranoid and also believe in bad carma. He told me whenever I'm about to get in a fight and am walking outside to have it 90% of the time I'll get hit before I get to the door, then to keep my eye on the guy as I do. Gee, thanks Tom^^!!! I really don't like parents that think if they did exceedingly well in school that their son/daughter should as well, it's not right. After zoning out for about 15 minutes and replying with "ya" and "mhmm" then doing a little sucking up Kat came back and stopped talking crap about her, he really pisses me off sometimes. Well, I have no right to be talking crap about him... Not my dad, just wanted to say that.  Jen's B-day party was awesome, we had a lot of fun. They all play Gunbound which surprised me, didn't think so many people that I knew played it! Yay! I played SSBM, had a lot of fun with that like always. Didn't do too bad either, the one I was playing was good. 'Bout as good as Dane, Dane might have been a little better. Watched Kat power level, had to leave right before she was about to lvl. It was Jen's first LAN at her house, she was pretty exited about that. She's a good host, lot's of fun stuff. That should be it for today, post another time!

      So much for the "stay up 'til 2 in the morning for the rest of the week", I'm so tired... Missed my bus this morning, luckily my mom was nice enough to give me a ride. I'm usually tired at A and B block then really energetic at lunch but today I was still wiped, kinda sucked... Dane was busy anyways, so tomorrow will be the day that we continue. After lunch I learned to crimp network cables for the LAN, Blanton was supposed to be doing it but after I learned all he did was snap the heads on the wire. That was my exiting open block, Tevor wasn't there 'cause Kelly stopped by for the school day... Don't know what's goin' on there, no one tells me anything. I wasn't gonna be able to see Katherine today apparently, luckily her mom decided otherwise later on. I got to surprise her, I was gonna sneak in and go through her dad's office and sit down on the chair behind her 'til she noticed. Kat's mom already had a plan, so oh well. Muahaha! Then later on I took over her computer when she was playing DAoC and "accidentally" got her killed. Then she was trying to do a quest, I pointed her in a random direction and hit NumLock(lets you run without having to push anything). Gave it a break eventually, but it was very entertaining. Thank god tomorrow is Friday, I need to sleep in this weekend and also it's a weekend. TWO MORE WEEKS 'TIL CHRISTMAS BREAK! W007, it'll be so nice to have a two week vacation to forget all the stuff I've learned so far in school. Right on for large checks of money, yay for expensive presents*cough* Katherine ;). I'm gonna get as much sleep as I can tonight, must not die of exhaustion. That's it for tonight, post some other time...

      Humm, there's really nothing to talk about at the moment, yet I feel like posting. I just need to get going and I can go forever, just need a single thought to get me a head start. Dam, this kinda sucks, really kinda bugging me. I guess I could tell about my trip to Germany, so here we go...  Well, first off, coincidentally the girl I ended up liking there stayed at my grandparents house before the flight day, that's Kesh. I was still to shy to even look at her, she was kinda anti-social at the meetings we had before. Anyways, we all got there and got our tickets... I went to get something to eat and a magazine for the trip, ended up leaving my wallet there with about 100 bucks inside. Lucky me the salesclerk didn't steal it and told me to come back over the intercom, my mom was real pissed about that little event. Luckily she couldn't get any further than the metal detectors ;). So I met up with everyone at the loading bay and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited, eventually my teacher went to ask what was going on and it just so happened that our plane blew a tire while making an emergency landing in Seattle because someone on it was sick... LUCKY US! So we waited for 5 hours to get a plane, in some ways it was a good trade... We missed where the other schools would meet in Chicago and a tour of the first city we would've been visiting with a town guard. Since we were "so patient"(we played shithead for 4 hours straight and didn't stop 'til we all got back to Portland) they set us up in Business Class, it was worth it. The food was actually good! Amazing! Anyways, we ended up staying in Chicago for the night, took a Hotel we got for free from the Airlines cause they'd made us miss something "important". We ran across the street to a burger place and made asses of ourselves, god we had fun. Went to bed, woke up, went to the airport, got on the plane and began to Germany. Landed in Frankfurt, first time to see the SmartCar, so funny... It's barely bigger than my desk, since the gas is so expensive they've got to have small cars so there's an excuse for ya. We saw a guy with an MP5 SD6 and continued onto the bus, nice charter bus(it's what we'd be traveling in for the three weeks). Since the only time I can really remember and is the only really interesing part of my trip I will make the rest shorter. So we meet the other groups and start to tour Germany, yay... All the schools stayed pretty separate, we were the smallest one yet we made the most amount of noise. Got yelled at quite a bunch for waking them up(time zones). We laughed so much on the trip, must've given everyone harder stomachs. Back to the tour... So we went around to separate cities... Ate, drank(just "one" beer for the trip ;), ha! ya right!) and sang!(not really). The ice cream was the best part about the whole eating part, SOO GOOD! After sight seeing we drove up to Vreden on the eastern border of Germany right on(next to Austria). There we et our host families, everyone was scared shitless, I didn't know what to do... But they were so nice, my host brother was Max, he had to be the coolest person I'd ever met. Just like me when I was a Frosh! We went home and had cakes, cookies, pies, shortbread and pretty much any other desert you could think of. After that he showed me around the house, then we went swinging on a rope over a stream that was behind the house. Pretty much just hung out the next day, they told me we were going to a punk rock festival at the end of the week before we have to leave... Best part, so much fun. School was fun, got to see the classes and how different the programs were. Also it ended at 12:00 which was very nice, afterwards we ate big meal(lunch is their main meal of the day) and went to meet people at the bar. It was loud and everyone we were all still pretty shy but everyone from my school was there. So we just hung out and watched everyone do what they do, sorta learn what's up... The next day after school we went to the park, the park is the main hang out place. This is where most of the fun happened. We all met in a back firepit area and brought meat to cook on a grill, it was Max's 16th B-Day(the age where one in Germany can legally drink). He got 3 cases of 24 32 ounce beers. We had to carry them on road bikes, that was frickin hard. Everyone met up at the park and started a fire, somehow one of the other students was able to buy a bottle of Jack Danials. There was so much alcohol there, but wait... There came more, a couple hippie friends came with weed and started rolling joints. I never thought this would ever happen on a school trip to Germany. I dare say it was the best time I'd had for a long time, they opened up the Jack Danials and mixed a quarter of the bottle with some pepsi, no one would drink it... So I did, they were cheering me on as I chugged the mix down... Wasn't too bad actually, it went fast and I was already buzzed from the beers I had drunken. In about 10 minutes the Danials started to kick in, I've never been so drunk, it was the most fun time ever. I was trying to run and would just fall flat on my face after a few feet, I tackled my friend and we landed into a bush of stinging nettle. That kinda hurt, but at that moment I didn't care, I was having way too much fun. I couldn't stop laughing, even if I were alone somewhere in a tree I would just start cracking up. At one point I was laughing so hard I started feeling a sharp pain in my chest. I tried waling in a straight line and obviously didn't do to well, then someone picked me up and started spinning me... That was awful, I had a big headache after they put me down and just lay there waiting for it to go away so I could keep on having fun. The hardest part about that night was riding home on the bikes, everyone was falling on their asses and scraping up their elbows and knees trying to get home. The next day suprisingly I didn't have a hangover and I had drunken more than anyone else that night, it was a great relief. Must've been my fast metabolism, thank god... The Punk Rock festival was different, there was alcohol but I was a little more responsible, there were about 5,000 people in this huge field... There were about 4 or 5 stages all but one playing punk, the one that wasn't was playing rap(skrew that), two american bands were there: The Helicopters and boysetsfire. We went to the stage closest to us and got in the mosh pit, if you've never been in a real mosh pit then you haven't been born, it's gotta be one of the most fun things to be a part of ever. I didn't weigh that much obviously but if you fall over people make a wall around you, pick you up, dust you off and ask if your alright. SO FUN!! After the mosh pit we went to look for food and drink. My friend bought 2 beers right off the bat, apparently he hadn't gotten enough yet. He was drunk in no time, so I brought him to a hill and had him sit down. As we sat and listened the music Kesh(the one I liked) came by and I told her we needed to steal his wallet so he'd stop buying beer. I asked to see his wallet so he gave it to me, I handed it to her and he figured out what was going on. She sprinted off and she ran fast, my friend went after her but in his drunkenness couldn't catch up with her for his life. He rambled on how he wanted something to drink and how it was so mean that she stole his wallet as we "looked for her". There was no way we were going to find one person in a crowd of over 5,000 people. We went moshing some more and he couldn't keep himself up so we went to find some people, amazingly we found Kesh. He was sober by now so she gave his wallet back, he didn't buy any more alcohol after that. But as for Kesh, she started buying Smirnoff Ice, very very tasty but heavy. She was now drunk, so me and my friend walked her around, keeping her away from the Smirnoff booths. It was about time to go and we lost each other, me and Kesh went looking around for everyone. She was falling asleep while we were walking back to bus, I had to hold her up and slap her face to keep her up until we got there. Everyone slept on the way back... The next day we left, said our good byes, we were all really good friends after all the fun. Another week of touring and we went back to Portland, I miss it. I had the best time there, I want to go back sometime.  I'm sure this is enough for now, thanks for reading.

      Here's the journal I kept from last year, can't remember what's there... But it's there!  December 18, 2002 	I’m waiting for mom to get off the dam phone at the moment so I thought I would make a journal, relieve some stress.  	I’ve been going after Lynne for quite some time now and I think she’s finally giving in.  She’ll be at the next LAN Party I’m praying.  God, I don’t understand why I’m so incredibly attracted to her, I mean she’s really hot and sweet and all that other shit but it was so sudden. Have all these years of loneliness finally caught up with me? That is quite defiantly a possibility, I’ve been fine for all my life so why now?  Oh well, I’m having the time of my life!  Zak got mad after I told him I was going to ask her out because he thought he could’ve gotten her. I don’t know about that, it doesn’t seem like he’s her type of person.   	 	Ok, now Zak is way too immature for his age.  He says it’s to piss me off but it’ll be there for a while I know it.  I really wish he would mature A LOT, and lighten up on Nathan.  Whenever Zak is being all immature everyone tells him to stop but he just ignores them and keeps stealing peoples stuff because he want’s more attention.  But whenever Nathan does it and Zak isn’t in the mood he yells at Nathan and insults him in any way possible most likely to make himself feel superior in some way.  He always needs to be right, and when he's wrong we starts to either attack you in some way or insult you.    	Those are the pretty much the only bad things about him, overall he’s a really great friend.  I’m lucky to know him *talk about mood swings*.  He and I are going to start an Airsoft Team, that is if I get a gun after what I told Dad.  For the records, I asked for an airsoft gun for Christmas(MP5SD5) and he made a deal with me.  For every C I get I pitch in $50.00 toward the gun, it was $330.00, that includes shipping.  Anyway, I sent him an E-Mail telling him I had all A’s and B’s when I actually had C’s and a D.  So when progress reports came my mom got mad, like she usually does, and had me get progress reports every friday.  Knowing that my dad would see the grades eventually I called him up to tell him, but didn’t have the guts to spit it out.  After the phone call I took a shower and thought it would be a lot easier if I were to E-Mail him, god was it ever.  This happened today so I am now waiting anxiously for a phone call or an E-Mail.  I’m relaxed for some reason though, it feels like he’ll be glad I told him myself and work out another deal with him.  I shouldn’t be saying that though, I don’t want to jinx it.  	Basically, right now life sucks, but everyone has their moments and this is one of them.  I’m really worried about dad’s reaction to me E-Mail, he is the coolest most caring person I know but he has his limits.  I don’t want to lose his trust in me, we’ve had it so good for years and I may have just ruined it.  Please god, give me some slack this one time.  Being shy SUCKS, coming on to Lynne when I’m still not sure she likes me is tough but I’m gonna keep going until she either tells me to stop or lets me date her.  Lynne can not be described, she makes me so happy when I’m with her and I can’t help but look at her eyes.  Lynne makes my life easier and more enjoyable, she keeps me up at night for hours by just existing.  This may sound like I’m an obsessed maniac but I think about her 24/7.  I don’t think any of this shows in the way I talk to her or look at her, all because I’m shy.  “Sleep, those little slices of death, how I loath them” 					-Edgar Allan Poe  December 19, 2002  	It’s way too fucking late to put anything down right now, not even a quote so good-fucking-night!  December 20, 2002 	At LAN Party!  December 21, 2002  	Yesterday was the start of the best LAN Party we’ve ever held, it was at Nathan’s house in his garage.  It was perfect, the warmest part of the house apparently, there was no shortage of warmth.  Then got into a snowball fight with Alex and her friend, then my hands got so cold that the snow started feeling warm, weird.  I got really good at my Undead strategy with the mass Skeleton Warriors.  One comp is really easy now, so when I get really good I’ll start on two, which will be a feat to everyone else.  	Lynne called this morning sick off her ass, I felt so bad that I couldn’t do anything.  She has a really high fever and was throwing up all last night, then after she threw up everything there was to throw up she’d just start to gag.  Fuck, I couldn’t do a single fucking thing to help her.  I’m kinda worried that it will get worse, I really want her to feel her best before Christmas at least, I love Lynne.  I’m starting to get some bad thoughts, I’m gonna quit for now.  “Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there... Wondering... Fearing... Doubting...”  	-Edgar Allan Poe  January 14, 2003  	It’s about fucking time that I write some shit.  I have some catching up to do, sometimes I just don’t feel like typing.  Well, this thing with Lynne is getting stupid.  I’m sure she wants to go out with me but can never get to Bend, so I think that I’ll just chill.  I’ll just ask her if she thinks if it would ever work out, I wonder what she’d say.  	Fuck! I snapped my fucking gun in half this weekend, I am so pissed. I can’t tell dad, he’ll flip after the big conflict with us.  I think I’ll just epoxy it as a sub for now until I get a metal body for it and just replace it.  God, I hope this works out in the end.  When I slide it back together it seems fine even when I shoot it, the only problem I found was when I shoot it on Full Auto after I stop a few BB’s fall out of the barrel.  Arron said something is loose, I can’t remember what.  I’ll just keep buying parts to replace the broken ones and every other one for maximum durability.  	This week\end I’m gonna try to get a job at the Disk Space.  I think that would be a cool to have a job there, they build comps which I can do pretty easily and sell games which I’ve been playing since Prince of Persia on the Power Mac.  Maybe Hartke’s class will help with applying for this job or any other.  I really hope I get this job, it would help in so many ways.  	I have concluded that you can’t fully trust anyone, eventually they’ll turn on you in some way no matter what.  “Tourists are terrorists with cameras, terrorists are tourists with guns”                   - Anon  January 17, 2003 	 	Well, I never asked Lynne about the thing.  I don’t think it would have mattered, she’s starting to flirt a little more.  She may be able to do something this weekend, that would be so fucking awesome.  She is the only person that is actually nice to me, she’s so hot.  	Zak’s pissing me off again, he can’t do one simple thing for me.  I asked him to put Black Hawk Down on a CD and he take his sweet fucking time.  It takes him one week to even try to burn it on but gets an error, I guess that was just too much for him to handle.  Then this week he was sick so he compressed the first part of the movie ‘cause he couldn’t fit it on a CD.  Well, he never got past there, that little shit is the laziest moron I’ve ever known.  	As for my airsoft gun, I’m just gonna buy a new one.  I don’t feel like dealing with any hassle to fix it or buy the right metal body or internals.  It’ll cost less just to get a new one than to upgrade the shit out of it, I’ll trade the broken one to Arron for his Colt so I have a sidearm.  Ya, that’ll be pretty cool to have, a sidearm goin’ about 300 fps to your face.    	Havin’ a LAN Party on Sunday, we’ve got monday off.  John’s coming who I really don’t want to come, Zak invited him of course.  I guess he could be some more target practice for the real gamers, the core of the LAN Parties.  I’ve established that those gamers are Nathan, Zak, Alex, and I, we are ALWAYS there.  Even if there aren’t gonna’ be anyone but us we go anyway, good group.  We are also the airsoft group including Arron, the one who introduced airsoft to us god bless ‘im.  That be it!  “If you can’t beat ‘em, run ‘em over with a semi” 	- Jeremy Brookshire  January 18, 2003  	I can’t wait ‘til the LAN Party tomorrow, there’s going to be eight people there not including the one that may be able to come.  It’s gonna be so fucking fun, and Nathan put the sever on his other computer so there won’t be any more lag, ya!  Kenneth thinks he’s gonna kick all our asses at all the games we’ve have been playing at all the LAN Parties, bull shit!  Zak and I are the best at CS, I’m the best at Warcraft 3 and Nathan's pretty fucking good at Red Faction.  We sort of played Tribes but it just wasn’t much of a LAN Party type of game, it’s all right we just have better games to play.  	I tried drawing yesterday and I suck now, I’m really disappointed.  I just couldn’t think of anything to draw, my imagination is gone.  All these years of games got rid of all my ideas, it really does suck.  I’ll keep thinking of something, hopefully it’ll come up because I really want to start drawing again.  I have a feeling it’ll work out eventually.  	I still  haven’t gone and asked about a job at The Disk Space, I really need to.  Especially now that dad said I need to get one, he’s not forcing me but wants me to get one to help with Germany.  When I talked to him last week it it was really awkward, I knew he was thinking about me lying to him and he knew I knew.  It was awful, I don’t want to go to Phoenix next weekend.  This sucks.  “Work is a necessary evil to be avoided.” 	- Mark Twain  January 23, 2003  	Last night Lynne decided to stop talking to me because I called her a weirdo.  After she hung up last night I knew she was gonna call back in some way, she did.  About 20 minutes after she decided to I get a call from someone named Bailey, Taylor (Lynne).  So  picked up and heard a couple of people whispering, then Zak started talking.  I then knew she did some kind of 3-way dealy with the phone.  I told Zak that I had caller ID and Lynne got pissed that she forgot to block her call, that’s just like her.  She’s great, I love ‘er.  	I finally got a laser pen, YES!  Vic has a fit when he sees it, it’s great.  Not much else to say.  “It’s always better to die trying than to quit before the end.” 	- RedCell  February 25, 2003  	It’s probably time to write some more... So here's the shit!  	Lynne’s a really good friend, love ‘er.  I’m starting to hang out with Nathan’s friends, it’s fun.  They’re really nice and I always have a good time with them.  Among them is a girl, really cute, she reminds me of Lain.  I’m pretty sure she likes me cause we’ve been extending smiles for a couple days, now the only thing I need is the courage to talk to her.  Once again, being shy sucks ass!  I just have to do it, it’s not a difficult task for Christ’s sake.  I need to break out of my shell and just talk to her, she won’t bite my head off.  I wish I wasn’t shy, it really sucks... Ok, I’ll talk to her tomorrow and I will not hesitate.  I must not hesitate, if that happens I will end up not talking to her.  	Everyone are asses to Nathan and I’m the only one to defend him, no one else.  He’s gotten used to it, but I will back him up every time he’s criticized.  They don’t realize the fact that he can kick them out of LAN Parties since he is the LAN Party host/manager.  He’s becoming more friendly and less annoying than Zak, which may or may not be a good thing.  Well, as long as he doesn’t turn on me or decide to stop hosting LAN PArties it’s all good.  	It was about time I put something in here, that’s it for now. Until next time.  “Only the dead have seen the end of war.” 	-Plato  February 26, 2003  	Thought that Id make a code, I’m bored so it makes perfect sense.  A-%		L-]		X-} B-*		M-\		Y-/ C-&		N-{		Z-[		0-7		FUN STUFF! D-+		O-_				1-8 E-!

First off, me and Lynne stopped talking after the first semester ended.  It does suck but I don’t think it matters to her, no problem.  We say ‘hi’ in the halls and stuff but that's about it.  I think she’s going out with Clint, or was.  Anyway, she was/is a good friend and I should probably call her again some time so we can catch up.  	My B-day was pretty fun, ate lots of food and I subconsciously started cleaning at 3:00 in the morning.  I don’t know why but I did, it was pretty effective too!  We had so much fun, in fact it spanned al the way through the next day.  Nathan was the last one to leave, he left at 10:00 pm.  What fun we all had and I got some kick ass presents, such as: Boosters(Alex and Alex), 16 GIG certificate(Zak), Networking and power strips(Nathan), Trigun DVD Box Set(Adrian) and Dane brought his console stuff.  	That is about everything that has happened, not much at all really.  “Our parents ruin the first half of our lives, our children ruin the second”. 	-Someone  July 3, 2003  	I’m back from Germany and I had a fucking good time.  I think Vreden was the best, Maximilian made sure I had fun every day.  I got drunk a couple times which was one of the best parts of the trip, of course coming after Kesh.  I gave her a note with my number, I really hope she goes out with me.  She said she likes and wants me, unfortunately she was drunk at the time so I don’t know if it really true.  We do flirt a lot, lots of tickling, touching and that crap.  I hope she calls today so I can have a conclusion to the subject, that would be nice.  	Zak got a summer love as well, as  Blanton told me.  Better yet a gaming love.  That is so awesome, I’m happy for him.  He tried to get a girlfriend all of sophomore year and it’s finally caught up to him.  I want to meet her and see what she's like.  	I must go now...  “We're laying the groundwork for a national campaign... A national campaign that I believe will result in a great victory in November 2002”. George W.

      Interesting day today, just barely got out of bed. I guess I was wrong about the whole staying up thing, I still like it better than sleeping thought. Well, as long as I can get up in the morning, I always go in and out of sleep... This time I had to literally roll out of bed, house was cold so that woke me up a good deal. In design tech we made prank phone calls to one of the golf courses saying we lost a ball, it sounded like they acually believed us and were concerned. "I was frolicking along with my uncle and tripped on a gopher hole, that's when I dropped my golf ball... I looked for it but never found it, can you help me"? Yeah, that was amusing. But before that we called a grocery store and had some strange Chinese accent or something... "I want to buy the meats!", "please hold... Hello, this is meats", "I want to buy the meats, the meats, MYAH MYAH MYAH!!!", "slow down sir, I cant take your order", "Myah!", "you want beef?", "no! no! MYAH!! I want Myah!!", "um... sir, we don't sell cat meat, you'll have to find a more authentic store to buy from"... *click*... What a waste of time that was, fun though. Math was like it usually was, boring and fun at the same time... I drew and talked with my old friends, acually started drawing something interesting. I've got plenty of homework today, good for me!. Then there was lunch, which is always the highlight of my school-day. I drew some more and was interrupted by Dane and Trevor, I attacked them both(Trevor by himself could snap me in half but Dane was more of a even fight ;)) ... Trevor left me alone and went to lay down eventually, but Dane kept fighting. He liked giving me indian burns, my arms are all red from it now... He held out his chest and told me to it him as hard as I could, so I did... He almost threw up, but he recovered and we kept fighting... Evenly matched we both were worn out and will continue it tomorrow. Then I went with Trevor and Adrian to eat like every day, didn't feel like going to D Block so I just had them drop me off after we were full of food and here I am writing in my journal once again...

      All the stupid ass good for shit words on this god forsaken planet couldn't describe the shit I'm feeling right now. Stupid fucking piece of shit mindless moron, has no clue what the fuck to say... Who the fuck does he think he is. Oh ya, sure, he wants to help but there's nothing coming out of his fucking mouth... Why? Because there's no fucking cause, it's all a fucking waste of his time, stupid bastard. DAMNIT! He's gotta be so sick of so much crap he puts up with every fucking day of his shit life! He pretends that he can't hear anyone that tries to talk to him because he's his music up too loud. "don't bother, I can't hear you" THEN TURN IT THE FUCK DOWN!! God damnit, if the stupid fuck keeps being as anti-social as he his he'll never be able to help the people he wants to help. Oh ya, such a nice guy!! Really funny! Always making people laugh, sure. And there goes his slow ass mind, it's gone and lost itself again... Has to get the fucking ice to make himself feel better, sick son of a bitch. Too pussy to get some fucking help, just wants to smash his head on a concrete floor. Sick twisted mind of his driving him insane, acually wants the red burning sensation... Acually wants to sit there with his hand over his shaking arm... Fucking psycho, doesn't know what to do anymore so he does this. YOUR SICK!! YOU SICK FREAK! Leave it, just fucking leave it! Don't loose it, you'll get way to many words in your head about that bullshit everyone tells each other. You don't fucking want that do you, fuck no. There's no way your gonna get that bullshit, skrew that. You just want your corner, that's all you need right now. It doesn't understand you, it wants to but it can't cause you don't let it. You want it to, but you can't understand your own fucking self. Neither can all the other fucking livestock. There's no end to the shit you and everyone else has to put up with while they're all the mind boggling retards that they are. Everyone is at some point, but it can suck a little fucking more for the mentally unstable than others. Stupid fucking morons.  Now you'll go get the things you love the most and inflict the pain you and everyone else gets all put to-fucking-gether in a cute, fuzzy little P.O.S. BALL! Oh sure, it'll help a whole fucking lot for you, but think about the others... Think about it... Think about the ones who push you further and further into the life of a fucking teenager, there's no end to it and that's the reason they keep pushing. They couldn't care less about you yet they come to you for the repairs, of course your too fucking obedient from your bitch mother yelling at you for not saying please and thank you when you were A LITTLE FUCKING KID!!! There's so much to remember and so much to put down. You could scribble for hours on end, but it makes no fucking sense... THERE'S NO WAY IT CAN BE THAT EASY!!! But it is, and you like it... It doesn't know, it wants to , but it doesn't. Do you care? YES YOU DO!!! You want it to know, but there's no possible fucking way for it to understand when you don't, unless it's some kind of fucking mind reader...  Yes I have Rage, but it's different than the others... Pardon my french...

      You'll find that when there's more "interesting" things to read on my Blog it'll be considerably late. I go a whole lot deeper into my thoughts when I'm dead tired, strange and sorta inconvenient but otherwise pretty "interesting". So even if I want to type(like now) I can't always be effective at it. Also, if I lose my train of thought everything goes, I can't get anything back. This sucks especially when I have a lot to say, the only thing the produce this annoying piece of crap event is the GOD DAMNED TV of which my brother is watching. Well dam, it just happens so that my brother if FRICKING WATCHING IT RIGHT NOW! Thank you Andy, stupid little crap. I'm staying up from now on just cause I like falling asleep when my head hits the pillow better than sitting there for a few hours thinking about whatever worries I've got. That then will make it easier to make those long ass posts that make sense only to me and the ones I explain them to.  My new semi-favorite things are now water, salt and ice. Why? Try putting the three together in a certain order, any more and I'll give it away. First one to figure it out is special, not sure how many people know what they do. But if you already know then it doesn't count, so very fun. Oh wait, another clue... Zen! Good luck with it, if you even attempt it!

      Looking back at what I wrote last night made me wonder how I could come up with so much to write about for so long. I was typing for an hour straight and I didn't stop until I just couldn't keep my eyes open, I'm a completely different person when I'm tired. I think I'll regret what I posted last night, but oh well, no one else's fault other than mine ^^. I'm kinda glad I wrote so much, I don't remember anything I was talking about... So it's gonna be one of those unexplainable things where it makes complete sense to me when I type it but afterwards I won't be sure how it came to me. Maybe I'll eventually make this Blog informative of something that acually tells about me, or anything in that area of stuff 0.o... Anyways, on to something more Christmasy, considering that Christmas is in fact coming. This means buying presents for the loved ones, I don't know if I come off as the "loves to walk around looking for presents they won't be emotionally scarred by for the remainder of their life" type of person.   I lost my train of thought and have gone blank and I'm suddenly really frickin tired, guess I shouldn't have stayed up so late last night. All that just may be a sign to... um... stop, I'm tired of typing anyways. Ok then, GOODBYE.

      I want to understand myself, I'm tired of faking everything. I'm tired of pretending I'm someone else, I'm not who anyone thinks I am. The only problem I have is that I've used the fake so much I cant remember myself anymore, or has the fake become me after using it for so long. I wish I could tell you who I am, I wish I could satisfy your mind, I wish I could make you happy... I try, I really do and I won't stop until I find him, I have to do it for myself as well as you. It's unbelievable how unhappy someone can be for so long, mostly it's the fucking teenage mind but there's always gotta be more to it than that. Like the surroundings of one, or how one reacts to others. One can really fuck up their lives if they don't vent all the crap that comes out of their mouths. They'll just be another psycho roaming the streets looking for victims to stash in the cold dark basement they built just for taking out all their misery on the innocent. Now I wonder where that came from, frankly I don't care, as long as it's out of the way.   I hate sleep, it's such a waste of time but at the same fucking time it's one of the most important things for the human body to get. There's so much one could accomplish if they didn't have to sleep, it's insane. Caffeine works to fix it, but only temporarily. For example, at the moment I'm dead tired but I'm waiting for someone. Since they've been gone for about two hours I'm guessing that they will not be back anytime soon, which brings me to the thought of my bed. I would rather stay up but there's another obstacle in front of me if I were to stay up the other five hours... School, ah yes, school(I won't comment on it right now). The only two reasons I sleep is for energy so I can participate with my friends and family and school. School sucks it all from you with no effort involved, this is very inconvenient. Where the energy sucking forces come from I will in fact mention, because I've got plenty of time.       1. Classes - The first basic force is the series of classes one takes, if you acually have to pay attention in class like me that's about half to two-thirds of your good "well spent" energy gone.      2. Friends - Friends take more than enough from one, especially my friends. There is almost always some kind of wrestling match between (a) friend(s) of mine and I, I am commonly the one to start it and lose awfully. Even so, I still have fun, which is another important part of my day(I won't get into that, lucky you). These events are usually pretty vigorous(induenoes not intended) and I come out sore and worn out.  I have forgotten what I was trying to prove if I was at all and I can reach the arrow buttons from where my hands are(once again, induendoes not intended). At this point I don't care what I've got up there, all I care about is hopefully having the one I'm waiting for to come back. This I think will not happen, which is very very unfortunate. With my seeing spots and blank mind I think I may post one of my "Rage" pages of which I've made over the past couple months. If you read it, PLEASE don't apply any of it to yourself you any other person, for I am in the most pissed off moods I ever get in when I make them. They help a lot and when I look back at them they make no sense to me, take my plead into consideration... I just want to post this.   im so fucking tired of everything and everyone, is there no peace in humanity? Fuck no! Theres nothing but a shitload of fucking hypocrits, and im so mother fucking tired of all of them. They can all go fuck off into there own little fucking corner, fuck them!I fucking hate everyone! WHY? NO FUCKING IDEA!! WHO THE FUCK CARES!!! APPARENTLY SHE DOES!!!! WHY?! CAUSE SHES A FUCKING WORRY WART, WHAT THE FUCK!! just leave me the fuck alone you bitch, theres nothing wrong with me... so fucking deal with it! jesus fucking christ!!

I HATE YOU SO FUCKING MUCH!!! FUCK YOU ALL TO FUCKING HELL AND FUCKING BACK!!!!! FUCK YOU!!!!  Thats my vent of anger, hope you... um... This is what happens when you don't vent after sixteen long years of life. If you've gone through and read this entire enry I envy you, you must have some kind of zone out and read Myles's stupid, boring, long ass, journal entry. Good Night, Love you Katherine.

      After reading my friend's Blog I've decided to create my own. I've been keeping one of my own but it just hasn't been accessible to anyone else but myself and the gremlins hacking into my computer. I'll eventually add in my entries from before this all, there's a whole fucking lot. I think there may be about 12 pages of 12 font single spaced, that's from a year of idiocy. This to me is nothing more than a stress reliever, it works well for me and I prefer it over the other options I have(no need to mention). With my crap personality(well aren't we positive!) I'm really edgy about what I put out, yell at me if you know I'm not posting something. Trying to fix myself to do so. I can so very easily ramble on like this for-fucking-ever and since I feel like it I will continue. Whoever reads would do me a great favor by yelling at me some more if I just stop posting, because once again that's the opposite of what I want to accomplish at the moment. From what I can tell I only have about 3 or 4 different personalities, shall I bore you more with what they are?! YES I SHALL!! HOORAH! Anyways, the personalities strangely depend on my mood. Who would've thought of that?   Caffeine High = Do not attempt to understand Tired = Something close to depressed or maybe even tired 0.0 Pissed off = This is when you should not apply anything I say to yourself, no matter who you are... You'll understand when you read it if you ever do. Just Fine = I enjoy triangles  All of that crap above is only the beginning. I just put the moods thing there 'cause I couldn't think of anything else to post, I hope to continue with this and maybe even have some kind of self respective agency come by and congratulate me on my great work in the field of anatomy. Please send the Pope a pigeon telling him I have his wagon and to be careful in Alaska for the flaming squirrels from the fiery depths of Hell...   One more thing, I do not intend on explaining a lot of my posts. Sorry for any inconveniance.

      in the dark with only the light of the monitor to show me where to go. i have no other, there is nothing for me... what is this, i try to write whats in my head and things that i dont understand come out. i want to know, let me understand. are you doing what i was so used to doing? i want to know, why if so? ive thought of it all and lost every bit of it, there is no end. youve done something with the mind hammered onto what it should be, but there are others that think differently. there are others that want to think what they benifit from, there is no end. why was there so much chaos... why the fuck was it so hard, is that really why that was how it was? or was it the many years of complete control and the crack of the whip, was it the sight or the whip... which one...? you think so differently of what i mean, you dont hear what i really have to say... you dont listen, you seem to but you really dont. i wish i understood, though everyone does. there always has to be pain... you say you will but you block it completly and do the thing i dispise the very most... you think i am what im not, you dont know me as well as you think. i hate it so so much, but you think its fine... i never wanted to but it was forced, you couldnt handle what it was and did what you shouldnt have. theres no more room for hypocricy, deal with it or stop it yourself. PLEASE!!! i hate it so much!... how am i still here, i dont know how i managed to stay and take all the shit in... is what i feel true? is it all real? does it seem right? i dont believe i want to take the risk of knowing... i cant take it, i need my corner. i need my gun. i need my life. i need my lock... its so very tempting to do what will release you from the pain and pressure all towards the center of one. will i ever have rest, will i ever have peace, will i ever have a clear uncorrupted mind, i think not...

      what the fuck... im so sick of this shit i turn into at night, it sucks! every fucking night i get all sad and pissy at everything and everyone... why!! uhg! even when the lights on, it doesnt matter... doesnt make sense, im completly fine when im out and in the day but then its like 11 at night and im in the worst mood ever... fuck that, that what all the Rage's are fucking from... god damnit, least i can fucking wake up in the morning and be perfectly fine. yay for that, fourtunatly its only when im alone. thats an upside to all this shit i think of and dispise... none of its expected to think of in such a way but i do... i dunno why i even bother with these entries any more, is it really for me anymore... or for attention, the thing ive said to hate the most. but only on paper... i write some things so only i can understand, so maybe it still is for me. i hope so, cause atm i cant figure that out. i know of 2 people that read this... and they only read it cause they asked if i had one... is there really a point to it, is it manditory for someone like me... i really dont know and i really dont care... still i prefer the pencil over the keyboard extensivly, you can show more emotion in drawings and words... darkness does make the mind a little hostile to just about everything it can think of... least from my experiences, oh well. now im calm after typing... guess it does help, gues thats good... i can function now, dont have to be so pissy at so much crap. its nice to have this to go to, easy to vent all the shit of the world.. i type so much useless crap too. theres so much shit to deal with all the time, theres no reason to give on anything thats brought my way... im here and sometimes im used as a pillar... but thats good for the others, theres more to this all than what everyone including myself thinks. a lot of this is subcontiously typed... i know what it means, but i cant explain it... i need to open my mind to what others think and what they want me to say/think... i try but i wish i could think deeper and be a little more helpful with things.. theres not limit to anything... there are only obsticles, sometimes so big they seem impossible.. but no, there is always a way. btw, dont forget to remember to not forget!

      I dont know how this is going to turn out... im in the dark again... i hope nothing to bad... um, i was suprised to see someone taunt another with something they hated so much... it wasnt right, especially after this person had been heling the other with their problems... it doesnt seems right at all, i regret not saying anything about it to them when they did it. I wish id reminded them of what they were doing, theres no use now though... the damage is done and theres nothing else that can help that. it just sorta suprised me to see them do this after all they'd been helping the other with... as was i, i didnt do what i shouldve... im sorry... i shouldve acted sooner... other than all that, there is of course more to speak of... i went to kats with zak and sarah to watch the extended version of The Two Towers... her mom only let us watch the first disk :\ wouldve been better if we had stayed up til 11 :D we had fun... ate a good dinner, i spun in a bunch of circles and got really really dizzy... i had fun, The Two Towers is awesome... i THINK we'll finish it Friday or something, dunno. thatd be nice... a few words were popped into my head while i was there, it was part of a joke but ive been thinking of them and they make perfect sense to me... it sounds sorta surreal but if me and kat are lucky enough then it can work, there will be no falling into place... thats saying it lightly, but if she really loves me the way she says than i could end up spending the rest of my life with her... im not getting to any conclusions whatsoever, but if we're lucky enough i would be the happiest guy alive. im not sure if i should be posting this, but its whats in my head... this all depends on where we both go after high school, i really hope nothing happens to us... I love her more than anything.

      Ok, time to update :) when did I leave f 0.o... well... don't know how to start off of that, but um... Had a good time at Kat's New Years Eve LAN party(btw, Happy New Year!), we had the most people we'de ever had at a LAN party before... It was awesome, 'cept for Katherine getting more sick... Like really more sick, not so good for the whole not getting sick part. My computer wasn't turned on once during... But we fixed it and I got a new better Mobo! W007!!:D So it's working now and I'm playing DAoC a whole fucking lot, as are Zak and Nate with me so that's very nice! I'm having tons of fun with that... Must not forget anything >.0... Had some ups and downs, but who doesn't... mmmm, lays *drool*. I slept a whole lot after the LAN, as much of the day as I was home then 'till 1:00. Felt better afterwards, then spent the night at Zak's with Nate there and we played DAoC 'till about 1:30. Got up about 8 to get Nate to the bus stop... we missed it after we went to breakfast with Tom and Kat at Alpenglow... Zak's mom went balistic, she was so pissed. So Tom drove Nate, Kat and I to Portland. That was fun, didn't do much but I was glad to be with Nate before he left. His mom was cool about it, we met in a brew pub and ate dinner(they had to force me into something, I got chicken strips*rolls eyes*). Afterwards we got to the Inn and watched Once Upon A Time In Mexico... um... that was definatly a strange movie, it was like they were trying to make it funny but were trying to make it really serious at the same time... Yeah, Kat liked it though so we had to watch it*cough* brat! *cough* ;D. Drove me nuts when I went to bed 'cause Kat was sleeping just in the other room... So close yet so far, big obsical between us :/... oh well, it was all fun. We went to Powells and headed off, she wasn't feeling all that great and slept most the time... She needed it :). Got home and sorta didn't know what to do, my computer was still at Zak's... My desk feels really crappy with just my Mac sitting there, very empty and good-computerless... So my day... I got ready with my eyes closed, that was hard... took me a long time to find something to wear, but I was too tired to open my eyes. I got it eventually, 'twas fun. So I stood there in the 6 degree weather talking to Alex, John and the little freshman kid. Then I stood some more. Then a little more. Then a lot more. Then we realized the bus wasn't coming after being a half an hour late! So John dad gave us a ride, got to school and went to class 15 minutes late... Didn't do a thing in Design Tech, didn't want to do anything in Math but Carpenter was teaching something new so I had to pay attention. Was nice to see Trevor again, he was in a good mood after going to Eugene(youd know if you did)... So we went to Taco Bell for Jen and then to my house and ate, I had the strangest assortment of food for lunch... little cookie dough balls, cheese and crackers, 3 Eggo waffles, Enchiladas and some chips... But then Trevor had my old Mountain Dew from a while back, it was frozen but it was stil good. He decided to start putting stuff in it like Eggnog, chocolate, strawberry candies, lemon juice, apple cider and honey... It was... interesting, it wasn't awful but it wasn't good... It was fun!:D By that time we had skrewed around a lot and had to go back, so we did... I went to Drama and did stuff, was fun... I'm so happy Kat's going to Summit for the second semster, I still don't know if she actually wants to... But she still has time to think about it. I'm really trying to update more, just don't have the energy to think of something to post. Sometimes I just sit here and stare at the screen thinking, oh well... Love you Kat!

      Ive wondered why its always night time when im like this... and yet Im so used to going to LAN Parties and having a great time. Must be the solitary feeling in my corner with my whole life right in front of me... Seems its all I need when im here, though it isnt in any way, it just feels that way. Like I don't need anyone else but myself and my corner... But thats not true at all, I need everyone and everything thats in my life at the moment... they are the only things that really help me on my feet after falling all the time. theres so much crap to deal with... and when i look back theres all these people to help me with all of it... I take for granted too many things that i have and should cherish always, theres no telling when something might happen to them. Theres no way to keep anything forever, thats why it should be taken for granted to see as everything i have as a privelage... I dont need it all but fuck if i didnt id be somewhere completly different right now, so much support. there are more things i need to change about myself, there are more things i need to improve. there always seems to be, but its worth the time and effort... i cant get enought sleep, im always tired and when im tired im in a crappy mood... bad timing... that and night dont add well, anyways... I promise it wont happen Kat, trust me... im out of words, going to sleep... night

      I guess i do know, I don't want to though. It's getting worse, I don't want it to. It gets worse the more I deny it, I thought it would leave. It used to only be when this was away from one, but it didn't seem to matter where this was this time. I don't know what to do, I'm afraid of the time after it's all done. I'm afraid of the pressure on my chest growing. All the pain it will cause and what these things will think, will I feel better or worse. I refuse to stop looking, there has to be something to hold on to. There has to be something to keep with me to remind me of the times, there has to be something hold me up... But there isn't, theres nothing keeping me from this feeling and it's starting to get out of control. I get nothing out of this, but I want nothing... Yet, I wish for something, I get nothing still. I should expect something more than what I get... Should I? I need to find this and stop hiding it... I'm making myself doubt this and want more and different things. I need to stop, I can't sleep. This is awful, I can't think. The words are lies and truth, I don't know which is stronger than the other. I want to figure out what I've got to do, the longer I take the more pain will be set upon me. What do I do...

      turns the light off to get out what he wants, hes consumed... the glare of the screen hurts his eyes, yet he stares without blinking for minutes on end... there is no way out, leave now or suffer. spin, get up and walk... the cusions are there for you, they keep you safe and keep you warm. just stop, do what you should be doing... stop everything and give in, dont listen to the others, dont listen to anyone else but yourself... or is it better to listen to the others. whats beyond the darkness, it has to stop... there has to be an end to it, find the bottom and be content. find the bottom and be complete. find the bottom... then what, whats after that.. go back to what, the warm places? there are no warm places other that the arms you wish to be held in, no others... keep your mind on everything and dont give, theres nothing stopping you. make it all make sense eventually, be sure to keep yourself intact and sane.. HA! no one is sane here... not a single person, theres is no way to get any better than you are... there is no changing, there is only hiding. eat the black spawn inside you and choke, choke to the point of no hope... dont drop them, hold them both up with sticks if you have to... sleep can wait, but you told them youd sleep... listening are you? or are you just hearing... doesnt make sense, theres no way its a possibility... take it all and stuff it away like always and the door will pop open after too long. take it all and burn it... Impossible...  Rants that make no sense even to the writer...

      cant sleep.... its in my chest and in my throat... whats wrong, something. what? something doesnt feel right, or is it the sad excuse for the blue inside me... whats going on, whats wrong, theres someting bothering me. whats happening, i want to know why... why cant i sleep, why am i never tired til the light. its all forced but completly usless... theres something pushing to get out, its almost there. but what is it... whats so temped to escape, must know and know now. i cant be what you..... you stop in mid sentance to play? your hiding it, you dont believe yourself but is it really that true. can you think that after the time spent, theres no way... you wont allow it, not now, not after all this. it cant be, but you feel it and.... want it? is that truth im hearing from your mind? or is it the blue?... you stop again, what does this mean, are you trying to tell me something... lying to yourself wont get you anywhere... it will only make the push and all the blue worse. you can lie about this, it will haunt you and hide in your shadow... there is no escape from this, make it known. your afraid of the pain it will cause, and the losses that will occur... you cant cause pain, you cant make it worse for the light... play and quit, keep it up. there cant be more pain, its grown so big... theres nothing to do but hold... youve done this and the pushing is still there, your chest still has all the pressure it had before, what is it!! cmon! deeper!! think!!! it has to be this! what was going on, what the fuck was it, you must know! but musnt ever ask, or cause pain. stop and see, is there more of the light than there is all the crap you dispise so much. sure, make up and kiss... works every time, but theres always a little piece left behind, it adds to all the other pieces and never goes away. they get so big, but has there really been that much pain for yourself to have such a problem now? cant you ever stop, cant you ever think of the others... make up your mind you fucking maniac, make up your fucking mind. are you more selfish than youve ever thought, is that why the light has to stay? or is it true, is all that true to you... thats it....

      something is wrong with me, what... why do i feel empty, why do i feel like i did before... this is different, i cant accomplish anything at all, not even sleep. i almost broke, it was right there... i dont know what wouldve happened if i had, i didnt want to be there. i didnt remember, i had nothing, my chest wants to burst. i want to close my eyes and never have to open them again... why do these things always seem to be the trigger, i dont know what to do. i dont want to be. do i deserve it, i cant hardly breath anymore. i feel like ripping out my lungs, do they deserve the air... this isnt helping any at all, what am i supposed to do... do i dare, i made the promise already... what have i done to deserve this... nothing, nothing at all. i shouldnt have any of anything... i need to be alone in the cold. i want to be alone in the cold. i just want solitude and a frozen mind.

      had the LAN finally weekend before last... that was fucking awesome! was the best LAN we've had in my opinion. most people weve had and was just really organized and the games were very nice. we didnt play anything to long, everyone got to play what they wanted and we were all happy... I love that, how you can forget every one of your worries and just have fun with your friends. so nice to have... nathan came down for it which was good of course, its not the same without him... we got plenty of video of him being tackled by conley, kat, jen... and i sat on his head :P there was very little sleeping, it was too hard to find anywhere to sleep in that room so most people didnt bother... the admins took power naps, kat tried but really couldnt due to the hollering of ken, hehe. i was feeling really sick after the LAN and just wanted to go home and sleep. that is exactly what i did, ate some chips and beandip :P and went to sleep around 3... til i was woken up by my mom to get ready for school... thats about 15 hours of sleep, so nice, mustve been the most ive ever slept... so yeah, that was enjoyable, um... actually started reading again, its about time. went to my dads last weekend, just hung out pretty much... my sister was there as well, nice to see her... came back and hung out with kat, witnessed the cleaning of my closet by my brother... eh, hehe... that was interesting. back in school after the weekend, so very interesting. got my computer back, missed the guildies a lot... were growing and are active, good people and tons of fun to play with them. thats as well as i can do to update... nothing personal, prolly better that way ;P trying to think... i feel a rant comin on so ill just end it, thx for reading :)

      had my 17th birthday this weekend, 17 years old on the 17th day of april. Apparently its special er something... everyone asks me if i feel different, i dont like always. finally got excited for it when nate got here, it was defiantly great to see him. kat came over, we played games and hung out, she left sometime at night or somethin. we stayed up til about 3 and were woken up by kat around 930, she gave me my bday presents and i slowly woke up. so yeah, the bday was fun... first people to be here were, not counting nat, kat and i, were adrian and jen... so yeah, everyone got here and we pretty much chilled, it was nice... i didnt want anything too big er anything. i stayed up til 3 again, adrian had to stay the night cause he thought thats what was goin on, im glad he did. watching him play games was a good background to whatever i was doing. nate was playin with fruity loops, dont know what he was doing... but he was doing it with his eyes closed. the night was over and we woke up again around 930, but without any help... didnt expect that, anyways... adrian went home and kat came back, shed left her comp here for the night, and we played more games and stuff... so nate went to retrieve zak, then zak was here. nate left for Washington around 2, zak went to a play... im finished writing about that... dont feel like it, that was about it. just felt like shit all day, when people started coming over this morning i just broke and didnt want anyone here. so i played sacred and focused my concentration on something else than the ones behind me. it was decently fun, kept me occupied. everyone is gone now, relieving. dont know whats goin on for the rest of the year, nothing would be good though.

      I sorta wish i had the urge to post like i did before, i did pretty well for a long time about posting. the blog site added some new templates and i decided to refresh this with some sort of post(below)... lots has been going on and i have told it so many times that im not even going to try to put it down here, so not worth it. Summary, i made some bad decisions and classified myself as an asshole. this month has just been the worst month ive had for a long time, no comparison. i think and hope that its ending, just want to go back to my life and finish with this. i think it started when i realized i missed my brothers anniversery, that was in late april form what i can remember. that really got me down and i beat myself up for that, i promised myself i wouldnt miss it. now i wonder what i did that day and how i was feeling... sorta kinda got back into drawing for a while but not really, i want to i just cant get any good ideas in my head, its frustrating... suddenly im distracted by photoshop, thx for reading

      Finally edited this, took me a while to get it right... still isn't but im tired of reading it over and over again...  It was a cold autumn evening somewhere in the deep South, an old man walked down the rotting stairs toward the kitchen to fetch himself a glass of milk. The house was as old if not older than he, its white paint was chipped from the long years of sun, cob webs were strung across the chandeliers, stair case railing and all around in the corners of the rooms. Outside, the light brown grass begged for water, an old rusted swing set unused after the event of a families death. The single tree in the front yard was hanging on to the last days of it’s life and shutters hung on one hinge waiting to fall to the dead ground. 	The old man was the last of his name, his droopy eyes made him look as if he'd been mourning something for ages. His long bony hands, dry wrinkled skin, his thin gray hair, his petrified frown, all stereo types of the senile old man. The only thing near good shape was his suit; the only time he ever took it off was to sleep. He was an easily agitated man and all the things that consistently happened in his mansion did not help to mend this weakness. The old man needed help to take care of the mansion, but he had none. The only help he had were the social service workers that filled his refrigerator every week. He refused to go outside. 	The old man walked to the kitchen entrance and stopped to look around to be sure of his solitude. There were butcher knives to his right lying on the counter and dishes were strewn in and around the sink dirty with condiments from previous meals. He walked around the island in the middle of the kitchen and opened the refrigerator door. The social services had brought plenty of food, anything he wanted was most likely in the refrigerator. He reached for the milk and a glass from the cupboard. As he poured the glass he heard a noise, it was one of the many common things that occurred in his aged mansion. They had slowly caused psychological damage throughout the years he’d lived there. His sanity was on the brink. He tried to ignore it as he raised  the cup to his lips, the noise got louder, he froze. The old man dropped the glass, it shattered and cold milk spilled across the floor. He got down and held his knees to his face in a corner of the kitchen, rocking back and forth screaming back at the noise in sheer horror. He called out for his family, no response.  There was no one there for him; he was completely and utterly alone. The constant screeching sounded of people slowly dying as if they were calling out for help. The old mans ears were in pain from the high pitch shrieks, soon enough it started to die down and eventually it was no more. 	He sat in the corner crying hysterically from what had happened. He didn't understand why they had tortured him for so long. The old man, shaking, got up and took a breath. He could not handle those moments of madness anymore, he could not stand being the victim of the dead for any longer. His sanity was destroying the rest of what was left of his life and he couldn’t support the burden. One foot in front of the other he walked out of the kitchen, subconsciously grabbing a butcher knife from the counter on the way out. He walked up the rickety stairs with a slouched posture, his face still wet from the tears. With the knife on his left he dragged his feet down the dim hallway towards the study. As he walked down the hall, its walls began to bleed out dark red blood. He saw the large paintings of his family members glaring at him and heard footsteps above him coming from the attic. Down the end of the hallway he saw a girls body, no older than seventeen wearing a stained white dress, hanging from the ceiling with the noose tightened around her neck. Light from the setting sun seeped through the windows lining the right side of the hall, casting dim orange spaces on the wall. The old man walked up to the study and opened the door with ease, took two steps in and shut the door behind him. 	Sitting down at his work desk he stretched out his right arm revealing the bulging purple veins under his thin skin. For a moment, he recognized the order of the books neatly organized on the bookshelves. Behind him, the fireplace and a mantle with a vase containing the ashes of his mother. Candles lit the study with a dim glare, in the glare was the family of ghosts he had for so long and lost in a heartbeat. The old man thought of his life, what he had failed and accomplished, what he’d lost and found. He had skeletons in his closet he still hadn’t cleaned out, just like every other human being. He lifted the knife to his open wrist lying on the desk, closed his eyes and ran the cold blade across his skin. The old man flinched when he felt the sharp knife slice his wrist. He opened his eyes, the knife was still dry, as was his wrist. He looked back up to find the faded ghosts, they were gone. He didn't understand anything, he looked back down at his wrist and it was still dry. The old man heard a soft calm voice beside him; it was his wife. The spectre reached out her hand and touched his wound, it then began to bleed dark, crimson red blood. Finally he started feeling light headed and he saw doubles of his surroundings. The old man was gratified to leave his life of fear and resentment, he could finally release the burden of his sanity.

      Busy summer once again, or at least the first half. I don't want to do anything but hang out in Bend for the last half of the summer, just want to hang out with friends, really don't want to go anywhere at all this summer. I've got the LAN on the last day of school, that will be really fun i know. Then family raft trip on the Dschutes on Sunday going 'til Wednesday, so it'll be get in and out to Nates on that day. Will hang at Nates from then to the 26th-27th, depending on his mother. If it ends up being the 27th we'll go to LPNW which will obviously kick ass, can't wait to just get up there with 'im and game! After that I'll head to Portland apparently and go to my dads from there... Don't really understand that, I'll have to fix it. I'll be at my dad's for a month working and taking Drivers Ed *sigh*, Stupid... Save up for car insurence and a nice airsoft gun I think, then the rest in savings if there's any left(which there should be by the time I'm done working). When I get back I really hope there's nothing else planned that I don't know about, staying in Bend sounds good to me. I'll be set when all this stuff has passed, summer will be nice... I hope.
