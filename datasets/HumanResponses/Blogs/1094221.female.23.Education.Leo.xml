      It has been two days that I've been feeling down...I just don't know why. I feel so upset, I feel so unergetic, I feel so tired of everything...Why did I  missed that "Friends" comedy show, again?! onh.. I had class tonight from 6pm-8pm. Hmmm...I missed the one show that could have made me laugh:9 hmmmmm...Maybe everything will be okay tomorrow...  That's all for today, I guess...Better go to bed, now!

      My day started around 1 pm, today. Yeah...I finally got the chance to sleep in as I wanted a long time ago. I slept for 11 hours, and I still felt so sleepy. I guess cumulative lack of sleeps can't really catch up, after all:p Hmmm...Maybe I'll may have to sleep in for the entire day to recover all my energy. Or...I can go to the gym and get sweating. Nothing but some good sweat to help me feel more dynamic^^   So, YMCA, please bring out all your towels cause suensuen is ready to sweat!   :p Ewwwwwwwwwwww...

      I never really experienced car driving during the winter time because people have told that the road are too dangerous and too slippery. I think this is perhaps the reason why my mother doesn't allow me to drive as much as during the summer. Well, I have been driving a lot lately, I don't  see any differences with my driving skills. Of course, driving more carfully and slowly helps, when driving on snow. But, what about the road vision? Cars are five times dirtier to compare with than the rest of the year...  I was driving with my dirty windows, today. I found out how dangerous it was to switch lanes because it was like impossible to glance at my dead spots without giving my full concentration to see right through the dirt on my windows. I think I should really consider getting my car washed tomorrow before heading on the road, again:p  What is it about washing cars during winter time? When the minute you drive on the street, the car will be dirty, again. Now, isn't it obvious? Driving with a clean car does not only means greater appearance, it also means to have better windows to see the roads.   Onnnnnnnnnnnhhh...This is like a win-win solution!!! ^^   hmmm...I just hope the car washing place will be open, tomorrow :p

      It has been months I have been trying to update my homepage...I can't believe how much time it takes to add something new and to modify something old. I worked on it the entire night, yesterday, and I haven't finished it, yet.:9 GEss...  Today, I went to work around 11h30am to 14:45pm, and came back home around 3h15pm. I am so exhausted and angry. I can't really believe that it has been two days in a row that I eat only once in a day. I have been starving and stuffing myself with one big meal...;p hmmm...What is the problem with myself?  School is starting tomorrow, again. Onhh! I feel so tired... I still can't believe I will have to start reading and studying again...Ishhhhhhhh!   I am so so tired...I think I better stay in bed for the rest of the evening ^o^

      It is so rare for me to be mad at someone. I don't know why I am so mad at this friend of mine, tonight! I hate it when someone denies the fact that he/she is wrong. Such...Stupid misunderstanding and arguments have ruined my day...So stupid that I don't want to write about it anymore!!!  So, I've finally tried this dessert called "La coupe dragon" or a name similar to it. It is a fried ice cream dessert!! Kinda interresting for a dessert! It is at the same time hot and cold! I tasted the green tea flavor! Soooo delicious!!!! :p

      It is already almost 1a.m...I shouldn't have watched that chinese soap on t.v a while ago. I should have started revising my English grammar and verb tense. My UWT (University Writing Test) is tomorrow, and I still feel unprepared!! What am I going to do?  Well...I just hope to pass it:( In the next half an hour, I will be going through all my past English essays. My English has gone so bad lately. Maybe, I should really consider reading more:p  Ishhhhhhhhhhhh...I have to work from 9:45am- 2pm tomorrow, and my UWT will be at 3pm. Then, after my exam, I will have to rush back home to get my car, and to go pick up some friends of mine around 6pm, so we can go to MIKASA sushi bar before 7h30pm (Apparently, I've made reservation at 7h30pm). hmmm... What a day I am going to have!!! >  No wonder, most of my friends say that I am a very busy woman =^^=

      It has been days now, since the last time I wrote on this page. You know what happens when you feel down, right? Well...When I feel down, nothing really matters for me...I only cared for a good laugh, I fake one>  Yeah... I can get kinda weird sometimes too, when I am upset. Wandering around alone, looking down, not speaking...   Some people told me that I hide my feelings very well, and some people have said the contrary, What do you think? hmmm:p Confusing isn't?  I went to school today...I had two classes :p Didn't really know what I learned today>  Around 4h30pm, I went to the YMCA. It was so good to have sweat... I felt so great after exercising! I think It is a good ways to get away from follish ideas...  So... You want to know why I was sad for the past few days? hmmm...I think loneliness have finally got to me. I feel so alone, I think it is time to meet new people, a boyfriend can help! Maybe? What do you think? I kinda would have to stop rejecting people from now on. Perhaps, I should start think about giving a chance to...  Or is it only PMS??? You know that girls get mood swings the week before getting periods, do you?   Well...What can I say else? I am so tired...still (Tired of being single, or tired of life in general?) Can't really say...Let's see what happens tomorrow....

      I went to school, today (Jan 22nd), as a attempt after my very ill day. It was almost like I was crawling to go to school by bus and metro today because I had such trouble breathing with my breath and lungs. I don't don't what happened to me, it is like I never exercised in my life. WHICH IS FALSE...Cause I am a very active person!!!   For the first time of my school life, I felt the need to be QUIET!! Yeah... Talking wasn't at my best, today! I am finally losing my voice!! > Hmmm... Considering drinking more water, now!  So, after my last class (4pm), I decided, for some unknown reason, that I should stay at school to continue my readings that was due this week! Hmmm... I did finished parts of my readings, but my energy did suffered a bit! I already had some problems concentrating because of my headaches and my giggling stomach nausea. I still wonder why am I doing all this to torture myself.  Weird...very very weird!  I came home, took my shower...and I discovered that those nasty little zits are appearing again on my skin...Something resemble to rashes:(  Looks like I am dying...HELP!!!

I skipped my Chinese class for work!! haahaa! At least I am earning money!  Ever happened to wear high heels for more than 8 hours??? Well, that is what I had done, today! I wore heels the whole day!! Such a bad decision!  Waaaaah! I can't believe how much pain I am having right now!!! I really need some foot massage!  In the evening, I went to my friend Khammy's birthday, we ate at "Zen Ya", a classy Japanese restaurant on St-Catherine. The place was nice and romantic, I loved it especially because our waiter (David) was cute and charming!! he eheee Awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww...I am dreaming, again!  Anyhow, I couldn't really flirt with him cause a friend of Khammy was already flirting with him!! hee hee... I will surely go again to see him....huh huh...To eat their delicious sushis, I meant ^o^ onh.. I heard that they have that tempura icecream, too!!! NIcE:p

      I told myself each day that I will head home to read my books...It never happened:p Each time I start reading a third page, I fall asleep~ What is wrong with me??? >  Hmmm...Sleeping in the library is not such a bad idea! Though, I have to admit that I sleep a lot to compare with my reading time! Wahhhhhhh! Maybe I should start drinking coffee again!  What is it with me and sleeping??? Hmmm...Maybe sleeping on an average of  6 hour a day is really not enough!  Okieeeeeeeeeee...Got to go ZZzzZZZzzz...

      I think being part of a radio team is very hard, nowdays. Every time you do a show, you have to make sure that there are enough Djs in the room to host a show, and you have to find a topic that is talkable. Well... It doesn't sound that hard, when read these two tasks. Is it?  I really must say that people have to experience it to feel the pressure. I am hosting this radio show for about half a year, now! Our team is falling apart. I can really see it happening...  Today, Phillip called me to advise me that he won't be attending any show from now on, but he said that he will still show up a couples of time to be a guest on our show. Moreover, as if three in a team wasn't bad enough, Wendy called to tell me the same thing...Her resignation!!!   Well...I must understand that they ARE busy people and that being home around midnight on each Wednesday is hard, indeed. But, why didn't they thought so before joinging the CREW...I feel so outcast, right now! I am lacking evergy to lead...I really want to abandon everything! But, I CAN'T because I have my respect! My DIGNITY  Hmmmm... So, what is it about giving their resignation to me? Have I become the leader, somehow without knowing? YEahh... Since, the very beginning, everyone kept addressing me as if, I was the main person of the team, or may I say.. The leader of a group. What responsibilities does a leader really have, when other members fail to take on responsabilities?  Is there a way that I can find a responsible and respectful volunteer, who will want to dedicate an hour, and a half of their time each week for some radio broadcasting? HELppppppppppppppppppppppppp!!!

There are soooo much information to retain! How am I able to concentrate on 4 chapters, when the test itself worth 15%...This is so so little!!!:> I am really lacking energy and motivation!  Plus!!! Everything in this book looks too obvious and easy! I am so scared of failing this test... I always fail, when I put myself too high! I just have to stop having too much confidence and start studying as I am supposed to be doing, right now!! Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!!!! ^o^

      I feel so bad driving my car, today! I could have taken the bus and metro, but I end up being too lazy to get out of the house before 11am. Yeahhh! Gaz is so expensive! I have seen in some places in Montreal that cost nearly  89.9/ L . I hope it won't go up again, if it does I will go crazy paying gaz! Plus, each time I head to school with my car, I have to pay for my parking...YEahhh! I am lazy to park far away from school. > As it wasn't bad enough, I bought my montly bus pass. What is wrong with me??? > I am paying double for the cost for my transportation!!!  Issssssssssh!

      Saturday...I can't really remember what I have done special of this day of the week! I feel like I have done nothing much! My day started at 9h in the morning, I was tossing and turning on my bed for about an hour to try to make myself wake up. I was so tired this morning, I couldn't even open my eyes properly because my body was still sleeping. (Physically, it felt like it was still 6am, after  4 hours of sleep)  I went to the CFSGM centre to hand in my Schorlarship Application form around 1pm. I was so happy to see everyone there; they were all laughing and smiling because all they were preparing the sketch for the elderly visit. I talked a bit with Kimberly and Crystal, today! I told them that I was looking forward to go to YMCA with them on Monday for that Hip Hop dance class...I'll see what I can do! Can't really promise that I'll find time! :p  Chinese school was my second destination, in this very cold day! I finally learned about "Wat Yuen", the story about a poet, who abandoned himself to the sea because the Emperor of "Cho" stopped believing in him! >>>The story about the history of DRAGON BOAT!!!  Then, I went back to chinatown to get my hair an oil treatment. My hair has been so damaged from dyeing it! >  My car is half full and CLEANnnnnnnnnn!!! Waaaaaaaaaaahh!! I still can't believe that gaz cost 87.9 cent a litre> So expensive!!! Snif snif! My wallet is in pain, now!  Talking on the phone with Katay was the last thing I've done before the clock hits midnight! Hmmm...How about if, we continue the chat in dreamland, tonight!!!! =^o^= hee heee...  hmmm... I guess my day was quite good afterall~ Some very good quality time by myself!   Nyoooo~ ^o^

      Ever happened to be sick and not wanting to stay in bed all day long? Well, that is what happened to me, today! I have a bad cold and can't wait for it to be healed.   I was looking at my dull facial colours on my face, in my bathroom's mirror, this after noon. I end up cleaning my washroom. Silly things I do, when I am bored. I couldn't stand that stain I was looking at.  As if, doing chores wasn't bad enough for my cold, I went to the kitchen to drink some water.  I spent the whole hour cleaning the kitchen. Rubbing those pots and dishes. I hate seing dirty dishes lying around.   I downloaded so much videos, while I was sleeping. Somehow, I kinda thought that my cold was healed because I was sweating in my bed while dreaming. But, NOoooo...I am still as sick >  I have dry skin under my nostrals from blowing my nose too much! Gotta have to buy more kleenexx too! Woahhhhhhh! Those Puff aren't that soft after all... I really need those with lotion on it!! hee hee AttChoOm.!!!

      Sunday was really a very interesting day with my family. Before going to "dim sum", we park our car at a local parking (were we had to pay an amount of 6$). Like usual, I was the person, who is getting off the car to buy the parking ticket. As I arrived at the machine, an average white man came to me and asked me if, I wanted a ticket for the parking. I replied to him by saying "Yes". Then, he offered to do the service of purchasing the ticket with "his" Mastercard, and he expected me to give him the 6$ cash. Well, it was quite obvious that the card this dude was holding was a "stolen" card.   When I came back to my mother, I asked her if, we should call the police or do something because everyone in the parking lot is paying him for his stolen credit card's credit. Well...How can I say it more obvious...WE ARE HELPING A THIEFT TO ROB SOMEONE'S WALLET!!! This is so bad...> AS if it wasn't bad enough, my mother said that we better leave it as if, we haven't seen anything. "Mind our own business!!!" Ish this really the proper action to take? I know that I would have love it if some good citizen calls the police to advise my stolen creditcard has been used by a thieft. It would ban the thieft from using all the money, or even help to cancel the activation of my card.  Stu stu stu...

      While I was crossing the street to go to the metro, yesterday, a saw a girl looking at me as if, she knew me. She was smiling, and it was like she was about to say hi to a friend. I thought that she saw her friend, who might be walking behind me, or something. Then, she spoke " Oh! I am sorry! I didn't meant to stare...It is just that I find you so pretty! You look like a doll...So cute!"   This was is a Kodak...I meant awkward moment! A situation like this never happened to me, before! Especially, when the person who gave me that compliment was as pretty and as cute...^^  I never thought that "pretty and looking like a doll" would apply to my looks ^^ Anyhow, I  replied back by saying "Eeeeeer...Thank you" >>>All this with a very very shy little voice and with my eyes looking at the ground...>   Nyoooooooo~

      Wow...I never thought that time flew that fast...I am so surprised! Coming onto this site to post my blog seems like decades ago^^  Sunday, was my last day of work at Dynamite! I feel so empty not having to work there anymore. It was such a nice experience I had there! I really enjoyed being a fashion consultant or a sale person. It was so fun! Will I go back and work there if, I do not like working my family's restaurant? I have no idea! If, I was to look for a job... I think I'll choose a place with a more high paying one^^  Monday, was a great cold day. I skipped my sociology class again, today! I could dare showing late again, especially when I haven't done my readings or finished half of my research assignment...Help! I am so bad in research and conducting a survey...I have been working on it for weeks, now!  Maisonneuve's talent show is approaching!!! Woahhhhhhhhh! I think that I will go nuts!  We can't even decide on the second song we want to integrate in our routine! I don't even know the dance by heart! I am going to drop dead nervous in the next few weeks!

      I went to the YMCA, today! I can't believe how many people there were! All machines were occupied by the time I arrived around 4pm. Looks like people are really looking forward to wear their bathing suit in summer. You can really sense the need to lose weight and to get toned when you are at the YMCA.  As I looked around me, so many people are comparing their bodies to others. Everyone stares in there. Including myself! hee hee... "I wish I have that girls toned body..."  Really have to workout more...The show is in a few weeks! Have to look at my best you know? Oh yeah! What's wrong with losing some weight to feel more confident^^ Yeahh!  Exercising and watching what you eat is the best way to lose weight! Remember people!! There no special diet. Simple eat less calories and exercise...I'll bet you'll lose your 2 lb a week!^^ (Or 5lb if, you really want to cut your food intake...which you don't want to do cause you'll be playing yo-yo in your weight" Meaning, you might lose 5 in a week, but you might gain back 8 in the following week because of your cravings. So, eat smart!

      (Tursday, March 27) I really lack of patience, today! I don't know why... but really. What's wrong with me? I am usually quite patience when waiting for some friends. Yalan, Ngoc, Mae and I were supposed to practice our dance routine at 8pm at the Faubourgh. They were late...And I was waitng for half an hour! I had nothing to do with me...no books, no nothing! I decided to go and stop waiting. I really thought that the practice was cancelled. No one really confirmed the practice anyways. So after I left Faubourgh, I decided to go to Dawson College (9pm)...I thought I might have heard wrong, and that we are practicing there. 10min. of looking and wandering around the empty building...No one! So desperate! I was so confused and mad>  I drove back home in a very rough manner; I was fast and tough. heehee...I promised never to do that again! It was scary to see a little girl like me driving like that! I can't believe that guy wanted to race with me...until he saw that I was a girl! haa haa

      I can't believe that it is going to be 3 am soon! I spent the whole evening cleaning up the basement closet! There were so many old clothes and clothes that have not been worn at all! I really hate when my mom brings home bunch of ugly clothes from work. Clothes that are free are not all nice to wear! Who would where a size 7 and more in our family! Ishhhhhhhhhhhh! Our house looks like a manufacturer's dumpster. I cleaned up 6 big garbage bags of clothes ready to be recycled!  Well... I will donate the clothes to the "Salvation Army", tomorrow! I hope they will accept our old clothing!   Hmmm...I think they will be more than happy to take them^^  I feel so dusty right now... I better take a quick shower:p hee hee heee...

The dinner party is over  ^^     I had such a great time preparing my hot and sour soup today:p  Katay, Yalan, Sing, Noy, Vy, Kou, Mae and Dave were all here at my house! (The order is according to their arrival at my house)  :p      It is so funny because most of the guys were sooo drunk, from the lack of sleep, that they kept making dirty jokes... hee hee I think they have had too much booze before coming here!! haa haa...  Yeah... Of course they will be invited again! They are fun people, who know how to have fun! Laughing like crazy...I think we have gained and lost the energy from those crzy horny jokes...stu stu stu ^0^

      I am done with all my semester's classes^^ It is such a relief! Now, all I have to do left is to finish my two term papers by next week and to study for my two finals that is held on May 6th...> Why me!!!  Hmm...Today, Emily called me to ask me if I was interested in going on a trip with Crystal, Michelle, and herself. Going to Toronto Wonderland for 3 days two nights~ Such a big temptation! Since I am not going to Hong Kong any more! Why not going on a nice trip to compensate^^ I will be going for sure now! May 17-19...I hope that SARS thingy will be less a treat by then! Or I'll be wearing a mask all trip long!

        It must have been days since my last blog! Wow...I really had a busy week! :p     There have been soo many events going on in my life lately. I almost had no time to breath!      April 3rd, 2003   The New Peking Restaurant has finally opened it's door to the public! The grand opening started with a religious ceremony (Monks came to the restaurant to pray), then we had a big lions dance event! I never really saw lions dances this close in my life! For some seconds, the lions were rushing toward me...I guess I was on their way because I was filming it with my camera recorder^^    April 5th, 2003   My performance group, N.Y.M.A., have shown our routine to the C.A.C.M talent show at College Maisonneuve. I was so nervous before the show. I can't believe that the show has already ended. I feel so relieved and TIRED...  I am sooooo sleepy right now, as I am typing these words, that I am starting to dream half way while writing this.  ZzzzzzzzzzzzZZZZZZzZzzzZZZZZzzzzzzzzZZZZZ NoW....^^

      It has been a week since the last day of school! I can't believe how fast this week passed by. My two great final papers are done. NOw, all I have to do is to study for my two other finals! IShhhhhhhhhh!!! When will my holidays begin?  SARS is spreading accross the country, now. I heard on the radio that Canada is now rank second in the world wide for being contracted with SARS...Or can I say that the number of people who are in "quarantine" are growing by the day because people are careless of SARS.  Montreal in danger? On the radio, I heard that it was preferable to stay home rather than going out on the street. What the hell the Toronto man was thinking when he went to Montreal's conference about SARS. What tha *beep ~?  Now, should I start wearing a mask from today on?

Why did they have to worn out! Holes were getting bigger by the day. I even started to feel air out of my shoe soles...Ishhh! Anyhow, I wore them for three years. I think this is the life expectancy of mr shoes. wou wou wouuuuuu...

      It is so hard to concentrate in my readings when the weather is so beautiful outside. I admit that the temperature is rather cold for this time of the year, but as long as we do not get snow anymore, everything is just wonderful! From my open window, I can hear children playing with each other, neighbours mowing their lawns, and birds singing nice little songs up in the trees. The view from my house is so nice, and everything seems to be so clean thanks to the rain we had a few days ago!  I can't believe that I will be trapped inside of the house to study while many friends of mine are enjoying the beautiful sunshine! I just can't wait till my finals are over. I still have till Tuesday... Time is really flying as I type all this :p  Wahhhhhhh! Help~

      I've never been so happy in my life! Well, I have been more happy than that :p Anyhow, my two major concerns this week is over. Finally, all my finals are over! I started to put away all my books and notes onto my basement's library. I found out quite a collection of Education books! Wow! So many years of hard work! ^^ I wonder if, that will ever pay off?  After having an interesting group study session with Fazia and Justina, I have realized how time really flies when you are around school! Spending most of my years in school! I wonder when life really begins? hmmm...I am now 22 >  I should really try to apply to some daycare centres. I really enjoy being around young children. They are so energetic and so full of spirit! I can't wait to work at the CFSGM, again! This year, they are trying out some new program for adopted children from China. I will be helping in that program of  Brothers and Sisters ...Oh! I will finally have a little sister to care of!^^ Yesu...This will be one another volunteer program that I am going to participate in.  Ever felt the need to rebuild friendships? My circle of friends have deteriorated soo much since University. I wonder what have possibly happened! Maybe I have became too busy or too self-centered to understand my friends' feelings. I feel guilty... Yeah! I feel baaad! I have been blaming myself for not having time to go out on their gatherings. Well, actually...It is maybe my fault for being so inconsiderate:( Hmmm...Who is to blame? Myself perhaps!  Never having the time to call them OR Never finding the right time to reach those friends of mine?    Maybe I just lack of destiny with personal relationships these past few years! Who said that the year of the Goat will bring luck in Monkey's personal relationships? I completely refuse to believe in those *beep, any longer!  For these coming weeks, I promise myself to gather up with my good friends. Go out for a drink. Call them for a chat. Go to movies with them. Invite them over. To hang out with them, and to do whatever activity they want to do...As long as it is legal and morally right!    I just want my social life back!    I feel soo lonely! What happened to all of my loyal friends? Do I have friends anymore? I have definetly tried calling them tonight (Yalan, Mae, Kimberly, Dary, Sing, Katay, Teng, Anna, and Emily) I have reach only 3 of them to chat. Just want a friendly chat! :( How hard is it to borrow some little friendly time?  Julie was right...Most people in their 20s are so occupied with their busy schedules (school, work, love life, family life, organisations) That they reserve so little time to spend with their friends. No wonder I keep hearing: As we all grow older, one's circle of friends tend to strink, in size. Not because we want this to happen. As time passes by, one might want to hang out with smaller groups of friends that one feels more comfortable with. Wahh! I don't make any sense! Do friends choose us? Or we choose our friends? Where are my friends? Have I become an outcast of all friends?  Can I be included in your group of friends? Can I? >        Hmmm...Let me repeat myself once again...Who is the blame in all of this? Should I blame myself or should the blame goes to both parties?

      I didn't believe that Montreal has the worse drivers in the province, when I first heard about it. But, after this week...everything changed. A few weeks ago, my car was hit, in front of my own house, by a woman who thought that she could cut me on my right, while speeding 50/km on a street that fits only one car at a time. Stupid woman who taught she could save time by running into me. Why couldn't she see that my right light was flickering, and that I was breaking. Such a dumbo! It was a raining and grey day, and she was wearing black shades. No wonder she couldn't see my signals. She was too blind, and too in a hurry to care for other people's security!  Most women don't know how to drive. Some are slow and undecided, some think that they own the road they are driving in, and some believe that they are always right. GEsss... The SAAQ must do more effort in evaluating drivers' driving skills.  Last Sunday, my mom got hit by another crazy driver. This time this stupid driver thought that his red light was changing into green light. He drove so fast, that he did not break on his red light. My mother was crossing on a green light, then ran to finish crossing her street, when the light turned yellow. That dumb ass hit my mother so hard that she went over the car. :*(  Luckily my mom had nothing broken. I have spent the whole night in the hospital with my mother at the emergency room waiting for her x-rays. My mom got no fractures in her bones or bruises on her body. I think that is thanks to god. She was carrying a buddha on her that day. My mother lost was her whole set of teeth. She was hit so hard that the accident broke most of her teeth. She will have to have her teeth fixed. Hopefully, the assurance will pay for that, and the person who hit my mother will be sued. WE WILL MAKE HIM PAY FOR WHAT HE HAS DONE TO MY MOM.   I just hate those crazy drivers.  Because of that crazy and irresponsible driver, my mom is now going through a lot of pain from swelling and trauma. She can't even go to work because her medications is causing her drowsiness, and lack of energy.

      I finally took control of the mess in my room! I never thought my room could be that dusty. Especially with all those dog hair (and mine) on the floor! Ewwwwwwwww... My room looks slightly bigger cause I moved two of my furnitures. Not that much of a differences, though! I only reorganized the stuff that was on my furnitures^^  Now, I can work peacefully with my desk so organized^^ I just hope it'll stay that way till the end of the month:p

      It is so beautiful and sunny outside. My skin is burning when I stand outside in the sun for 5 minutes! Woahhhh! That means that we will probably have to start wearing sun lotion, when going out in the sun! ^^ haa haa  I am organizing a pique-nique on the first week of June! Why am I organizing it to early?  ho ho ho! I have absolutely no idea! This pique-nique will hold at Park Angrinion! Like last year's!   June 7th is the day^^...   We will meet at 12am...Yup! You heard me right! We will have lunch, not dinner! I just hope it'll not be windy, cold, or   RAINY  ! :9

      It has been weeks since I heard from it. My family has decided to sale the house...Soon, my family and I will have to move away into a smaller place.   It all started with our family restaurant "Pekin"... Opening a restaurant cost time, energy and MONEY!!! I have been so depressed, lately. Everything is so wrong! Do you want to know why? I guess you'll probable pitty me after reading my blog.  Do you believe in palm reading? I think I do now...My right palm has many small and difficult lines. People have told me that my life was complicated, and bitter. I never really believe that crap. I shape my own future! But, still...everything is so unpredictable.  I am really discouraged with my life! God is really playing a trick on my family Or me!   Here are my biggest worries during the past two months: I had to do a root canal ($600), my mom got hit by a car, car accident in front of my own house, stolen luxuries at our restaurent, one of my good friends is mad at me, my dog is obviously going to die from her ovarian cancer (since we have no money for her operation) I can really see my family falling apart! What kind of curse do we have here?  Where can I get support? Who should borrow a shoulder to cry on? Luckily Katay has been by my side to bright up my day. I thank you so much...Your hugs mean so much to me! Have you been wondering why I haven't wrote in here? Why have I disappeared  from everyone? Haaaa... You read my words! My life is miserable!  Don't pitty me, please! Cause I am trying to stay strong and positive!  Try to guess why I always sound so joyful and happy? I have always hide my feelings away...It this really that bad? Yeah! I guess so...cause after typing all this up...I feel so good letting all of this out of my head!  When will I write again? I really don't know...

      Wow...Is it really already June 14th? No way... Seems like yesterday that summer school has started. I just can't believe that my final exam is going to be on Sunday evening:( Waahhhhhhhhhh...I am going to cry! I should have studied earlier instead of making those " cute tiny origami stars   " out of plastic straws. They are really addictive! Really, they are! My fingers are really in pain now! So tiny and so small, it takes up to 8 minutes per star! Moreover, those tiny stars don't even occupy 1cm square of my jar space! issssssssh! >,<

      Yesterday (Saturday),I had a pique-nique/BBQ with Katay, Sing, Mae, Dave, Crystal, Vim, Bao, Diana, Tommy, Noy and Kou. I think it is one of the beautiful days I have had with sooo many people since a long time! It didn't rain like the wheather forecast predicted. I am just so overwheled by the warm sun and gentle wind. We had tons of hot-dogs and hamburgers. I admit...This BBQ was a success! I loved the watermelons and all the junks available! Onhhhh... I might have to cut back after today!  I never really thought that I liked playing frisbee that much! I am still an amateur, but I am getting there! I did wish that Dave haven't broke that lovely frisbee he and Mae have bought previously...:p stu stu stu...

      On Friday, June 27th (which was yesterday), I had a big day^^ It was a rather interesting and not like any ither ordinary day because of my busy schedule (Yeah right)  I had a meeting today with my employer at BCBG (Yes...I am part of their family now^^) I signed some papers concerning rules and stuff:p Wow! What a classy store! Chic and gorgeous! So what does BCBG stands for? Beau Chic Bon Genre...Something to remember!  Then, I got to my bank to take a specimen check! I just can't believe how many people there were at the cash! I waited for 30 minutes (that is standing and watching the floor)  When I got home, Katay came to see me! (Onnhhh...How can I spend a day without holding your hands or kissing your soft lips!)  By 7pm, I went at my High School for a reunion. The school was so cheap that they actually didn't planned anything for us! We couldn't even go into our old high school building to visit that place out. The temperature started to drop and the wind started to get strong while we were waiting for our old classmates to arrive! Plus, no teachers were there and to make things more worse, we were only 40 people at this so-called gathering!  Hmmm...After an hour and a half of standing in the parking lot, most of the girls went to some restaurant nearby to continue talking about their success and talking behind people's back! I decided to go home instead!   I didn't really enjoyed my high school years, anyways! Back then, most of my classmates were snobs and were jerks anyways. Looking on their little mirrors, wearing their little brand names clothings, and acting like of they were at school for a fashion show.  The sad part was that most of the friends that I used to hang with, weren't even here!  No wonder! No one was responsible to remind us about our high school reunion!   I am assuming that most people didn't even know that there was one high school meeting!

      I woke up today feeling hot and dizzy today (Monday). As I step my foot down on the floor, I felt my dog sleeping on the floor. Not wanting to step on her, I moved my foot further away in order to stand up. Then, I realized that I've step on my dog's tail (not on her bones luckily)...The moment I knew, I slipped and fell hard on the floor and bumping my head at the corner of my giant desk:9 What a morning! I felt that bump on the back on my back rising up just like in mangas. OUach! >.<

      My part-time job at BCBG is very exhausting. I can't believe that some people thought that being a salesman is an easy task. I have stayed half of my day standing up on my two feets. Working 5 straight hours on my heels and walking from floor 0 to floor 3. Most people don't really know that the BCBG on St-Catherine st. has 4 floors. but after working there! I kinda feel the rush for giving the quality of services in such huge boutique! I can't even remember how many stairs I have walked each hour! This is what I call exercise^^

      Today, I had a busy day. I worked for 6 hours at BCBG and I went to school for 3 hours. It is like a normal work day. But, I don't know why I feel so tired. Is it because of the accumulation of the lack of sleep and rest, or is it because of my eating disorder I've been having! My schedule is so *beep up! I do not hate it though for having a busy life. It helps me because less lazy, anyways. So, why am I so calm? I really don't know how to show my surplus of energy, anymore. All my energy is gone. Could you share some of your energy?

      The manager at BCBG loves me? Hoo hoo...I don't really know if I am truly a good employee, but I only know that I AM the top female sale person at this store. I sold a lot of clothes not because I push my clients to buy anything. I like making suggestions and having fun with them. What's the deal with harassing clients? It would only scare them away! Just be nice and helpful^^ hee hee!

I have no access to my computer for weeks anyways! So, you have been wondering where I've been for all this time? haahaa... Hanging around with my broken computer! :P  Katay took my computer to his house to repair it for me^^ I am so happy! Soon, I will be online again~ But until then... I am going to use my brother's computer! I do hope that he doesn't mind at all~ hmm...Am I bothering him right now? I am such a pain...:p haa haa...Always nagging about broken computers! haa haa...  BCBG is really one cool store! And when I meant cool, I meant quiet and that we can definetly feel the A/C when the store is empty! What happened to all the customers BCBG used to have last year? Are there any tourists in Montreal right now who are looking forward to spend $1000 on two pieces of clothes? haa haaa...No commission and working for $8/ hour? I don't think I am able to pay for my BCBG wardrobe anymore! Yeah.. I am cheap on clothes...I can't allow myself to pay $200 a one single shirt!

      It is my birthday today^^ I feel so desperatly old. Hmm...Tired and old~ Wahhhhhhhh! Maybe it is because of the humidity outside! hmmm...I am now 23 years old! I can't believe that I am about to approach the age of 25. Yikkkk!  How am I going to celebrate it? With most of my friends of course! It'll be like a gathering~ It has been a while since I've had such a large dinner with so many people! We are going to be about 27 people at my family's restaurant today! And that is not even all of my friends! I wish it'll be fun tonight! I have a big cake (That is a gift from my uncle), Karaoke machine (That we can use to sing with only original karaoke VCDs), and a dance floor! It should be okay! I guess...I do hope that everyone will get along with each other! Should I invent one ice-breaking game to play? NAaaaah! It'll be too boring...(I have no imagination)  Anxious and nervous...  I really have to finish writing my paper...It is due tomorrow and I am only half way through...wahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!

      Wow....What a day I had! I never met so many friends in one day in my whole life! Several different meetings in several different places... haahaaa:p  At ~1:30pm: I met Yalan and Ewe. We ate brunch together Chez Cora. Huge pancakes and tons of fruits! Very tasty and fatning. (Luckily I have had plenty of exercises walking on St-Catherine from Atwater to McGill and vice versa ! I think I did that trip about 3 times today!  At ~3:30pm: I met Mae and went shopping for Crystal's Birthday gift! Ends up meeting Dave because Mae was going out with him after our shopping session!  At ~6:00pm: I met Dawn and Anna at Holt Henfrew...Dawn's birthday dinner! I wouldn't want to miss that! ^^ We went to ate at a Thai restaurant on Crescent...I ate only small amount of an appetizer. Not hungry! :9  At ~7:45pm: I met Yalan again because it was Thien's Birthday! Woahhhhhhhhh! There were so many people! :p Many beautiful Japanese girls! I got two numbers! hee hee...Not for flirting, thought *wink! Funny thing...All the Japanese at the party thought I was Japanese! Most of them started speaking to me in Japanese! I was amazed^^...Do I really look Japanese? onhhhhhhhhhh...I should really consider learning Japanese seriously then!  Another friend (Van) saw me on T.V this week. Wow! Does Vox always repeats its shows? I did the "Mosaique" show last year and was broadcasted during the fall season of 2002! I can't believe that I am still on T.V. Once a while for 30 minutes? That is too cool!

      Mom told me weeks ago that I drive too fast and that I should drive like my brother...that is more slowly! What? I thought I was driving slow. I thought that was why people kept sticking up to my bumpers. hmmm...This is so contradicting~  I was driving to school today! I had such a scare because I thought I was going to have another car accident! Thanx good my breaks were working, I could have hit that car in front of me! Never drive too fast~ Even though I see a green light ahead of me because you can never tell when the car in front of you suddendly breaks:9  I think I should revise my driving skills.. stu stu stu~ And I had the guts to laugh at those who have difficulties parking their cars. HAaaaaaaaa...

      Body piercing is a kind of art...  For months, me and Mae talked about getting our ears pierced; one on the upper part of the ear and two others on the lobe.   Today, I finally got my ears pierced with Mae. We have 5 ear holes, right now! That is 3 on our left ear and 2 on our right ear lobes.   Awwwwwouch...Since, I was the first to get my ears pierced...I did a bad thing because I lied about my pain to Mae. Sweet little Mae...hee heee!^^ You are so cute when you are nervous and scared. How can I possibly tell you about the pain...I am sure that you'll run away from it... It still stings a bit now...  I wonder if, my family will notice it ...I've told no one in the family about it, yet!  hoo hooo...:p  Me, bad bad girl^^  I am actually thinking of getting two other holes on my ears. Making 3 holes on the lower part on each side of my ear lobes. In 6 months maybe...I have 6 weeks till my ears heal! It takes 6 weeks! Wahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!

      Plastic utility boxes are very convenient! Really they are...Because they help you store away things that you do not need regularly and they help you put away things that you don't want to see (And don't have the heart to throw them away) ^^   Yesterday night, I shown Katay my under-the-bed junk...I think he was kinda surprised with the number of boxes and junk I had inside...Or perhaps he was surprised of seeing so much dust bunnies :9 Ewwwwwwwwwww...I got to do something about that today^^  I am packing and getting really to move... hmmmmmmmm! This is such a long proccess...My hands are so chapped from washing>< Wahhhhhhhhhhhh!

       Sunday, August 24,  2003   After my work tonight, me and my friends (Mae, Emily, Wing Man and Michelle) went to 3 Amigos to celebrate Crystal's birthday^^ Everything was so good...and the food was delicious! I think I ate for my next two meals^^ haahaa...  By the end of our dinner, we all expected the waiter to come to our table with a cake and mexico hat to sing "Happy Birthday" to Crystal. But, before I realized it...they were bringing two cakes and two hats...^^ What a surprise! They told the waiter that it my birthday too:) I am so happy because it is such a surprise for them to celebrate my late-birthday. (i.e. Most of them didn't come to my resto. on Aug 11th because of conflicting timing) All night long I thought tonight was all for Crystal!^^ I guess it was the biggest unexpected surprise ever. Your girls are the best! Thank you so much!  Afterward, we went to Michelle's place to watch a movie...Then by 11:30pm we all went home :p What an evening!  And guess what? At 3 Amigos, you get a free mexican hat and a piece of cake on you birthday^^ They are so cool! Tonight, there were at least 6 people's birthdays! Wow...That is such a joyous place to celebrate a birthday! Giving hats and cake on a person's birthday...I think many restaurants could use this idea too^^

After my work shift, I will go eat with Youna in Chinatown at a chinese buffet! I hope she wouldn't get bored with me... Wahhhhhhhhhh...I am so boring when I am tired. :9  Clubbing on a Sunday night, after a hard day of work? Haa haa... I'll think about it!

       Saturday, August 30, 2003   Working at BCBG is so amazing. Today, I met another Hong Kong actress. Christy Chung Lai-Tai came shopping at BCBG with her friends. At first, I thought I was dreaming or hallucinating...then, I dared myself to ask her "I am sorry...Has anyone ever told you that you look so much like Christy Chung?" Tehn, she responded: "Well, ... I am Christy Chung" haa haa...So funny!  She is kinda shorter than I thought she would be. She was like 5 feet 4...or something. She is lovely, but I can't really compare her to Tong Ying Ying because they are so different. Christy Chung is so outgoing and fun^^. Well...She is one typical CBC.

      Today, in one of my education course, I told one of my fellow classmate about my summer and my schedule in general. I replied: I didn't have any real summer vacation because I was working full-time at BCBG, part-time at the restaurant, I had 3 summer courses, and I had radio each week! How do I deal with all there? I don't know! Let's just say that I have no real social life! Are you wondering how do I do to see my bf? HAaaaaa...I don't even know:p  Let's just say that I see him more than I see my family and friends^^... And I am not complaining! I love you, Katay!

      It has been a week that I've moved into my new house. Everything is so different in here! The place is still a mess and still under renovation! I can't say that I enjoy living here! But, one thing for sure....I really like the changes. Changing places to sleep and to live really make a difference in life!  Hey...I am living just next to The Bay^^ haa haa... I can even spot the people shopping there!  I wonder if there are any nice things on sales right now! Whatever, I don't even have money to buy anything!

Well...Anyhow, I did celebrate with him yesterday night! We went to BAr B Barn and we went to the casino! We almost won $50 with $5...It is so bad we we had to lose it all! I knew that we should have left with the money in our bucket! IShhhhhhhhh! Temptation to win more:P  I finally brought a new phone^^ I am so happy that I have a small cordless in my bedroom right now! It is white and has a blue keypads and light. So cute :p  Moving to another place isn't as bad as I thought! I have the same phone number as before! Cool huh? ^^ I won't even need to tell anyone that I changed my home phone number!  I am still working at BCBG! I don't know why I am still there! Maybe it is because I pitty my manager for having so many people quiting each months! hmm...Or maybe am I staying only because I like clothes and I like having a paycheck each two weeks! haa haa...I need money! Who doesn't?

      About three weeks ago, I started having one of those stomach aches. It was so painful that I couldn't even walk on my two feets. Then, I decided to go see the clinic near my house...I was told that I had enormous amount of gas in my stomach! Wahhhh! So wonder I kept farting! Woups!  This week would be the seond week after I've seen the clinic. Still no enormous progress...The pain kept coming back to hunt me! I had to phone my manager so I can have my day off tomorrow!  So, I taught that I was going to die or maybe I will have a major operation. I had this scared of my life! How can a pain last that long!  Katay brought me to the hospital for a check yesterday night at 11pm. It was late, but at least we didn't have to wait 6 hours. We waited about 2h last night! I have my temperature taken, my blood taken, my urine sample taken, and some x-rays. I was so relieved when the doctor told me taht everything was normal with my body and that my stomach was irregular. Maybe due to stress:(   So my medication cost about 110$...wahhh.. I am ganna die!

      It is so weird...  I feel like I have not ate much today or in the last few days. LIke today, I ate only a pineapple chinese bun and a small plate of korean pasta. It will be 7h30pm soon, I should feel hungry by now since it has been 8 hours since the last time I ate! Funny how the pain and the air of my stomach hides my hunger! So, should I eat something or not?   I learned my lesson from eating an apple yesterday....It was too acid for my stomach...So, no more fruit for me:( Noooooooooooooooooo...

      I am taking my medication for my stomach for three days now! It does not seem to help much in the pain or in the augmentation of air in my stomach! And worse of all...I can really sleep much! So tired!  I had such a bad night yesterday. My stomach was hurting so much that I wanted to die. My mom rubbed some "Tiger bond" on my tummy and gave me some extra pepper pork soup~ It is suppose to help my stomach problem she said. I just thought it irritates my troat even more. Sore throat and can't really drink water... I feel like cutting my stomach to let all the gas out.   I checked out the indication on the box of my medication. Seems like I have what they call "GASTRIC ULCER" Is it contagious? No... It is not! So, don't feel afraid to approach me!

Is chocolate really good for energy? Some nutritionist says that little bit is good for you! It is good for the body, brain and what else? My sweet-tooth of course! Yes. I do have a sweet-tooth! I guess most people would know that by now! I always have candy on me!  Want a piece of mint? ^^

      Trying to figure what is the best way that I can do to follow the class topic for today's EXCI 204, when I did not read the chapter or have a hard copy of the notes from powerpoints! :( I am at my university lab. It suck when the computer doesn't even have powerpoint installed... ha haaa... Not all computer labs at Concordia University are well equiped:p Well...At least it is better then McGill's ones. Puhaa haa...  So, I heard that the movie "The Matrix 3" was bad. I just wonder how bad is it really? Katay even told me that he heard from somewhere that the movie will be on DVD in 3-4 weeks! gesss...And we were supposed to go see today! I guess we'll wait for it...Renting a movie is way much cheaper than seeing a lousy movie at a theatre!  Got to go to class now! gess.... I am stuck at school till 3pm. I am so lucky that the Metro is starting again by the time I finish my class!

      I guess I was pretty lucky today. I went to work in the morning at 9am without knowing that the STM was having a strike. When I thought of it, I might have got the last train of  the morning. The STM is limiting the numbers of hours of public transportation. Train and buses only works during the rush hours...which is not that bad. The metro works between 6am to 9am, 3pm- 6h30pm and starting at 11pm till close. What will I do on Thursday when I will have class at 1pm. Will I have to go to school at 9am also?  woahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!><

      The day ended very fast today. I began my day at 8 am because I had to finish editing one of my essays. Then, at 11am, I went to work at BCBG. The store was so dead and slow that an hour on the floor was like a day of working....Yarn! ~ I eventually finished work at 6pm. I then realized how hungry I was, I was simply dumb for not taking my break to eat lunch I guess...Anyway!  I thought I fixed a date with Katay tonight. We were supposed to go to Caroline's birthday and Justina's birthday. I hate  when people disappear like that. He doesn't answer the phone or even call me. I am really starting to get pissed off.  He better give me a good reason for not calling me, and not showing up tonight!  So, I managed to have fun without my boyfriend. *Baka baka baka baka...  It was at Caroline's brother's house, that she celebrated her birthday. That place was so cool, is was small, cozy and filled with IKEA furnitures and decorations. Wow... I would love to have an appartment on my own too! The food was delicious and the strawberry mousse cake was a sensational dessert. Miammmmmmm!  Didn't go to Justina's birthday tonight...Everyone kinda wander back home after eating at 3 Amigos. Too bad:(  I went to play Cosmic Bowling with Caroline, Jonathan,Teng, Trong, Sit Troun, and Gung. It was very fun. At least I didn't made any zeros tonight. I actually think that I am getting better! ^^  So, where is my rabbit tonight? What is he doing? Why should I care for him...I am mad ><

      After 6 days of strike, the STM finally got their wishes come true.  Employees now have better benefices and work salaries. So, I am happy that the metro and the  buses are back into normal schedule at 3pm, today. It is so true when people say that it cost something to get something in return. Six days of strikes and without public transportation was hard for everyone in Montreal.  I think it was especially hard on commercial boutiques and restaurants in downtown. Most business number went down a  lot during the strike. Even where I worked, everyone have had an hard week. Less commission and less money to the boutique:( stu stu...  And I thought that having that strike was good for the nature because people where walking and bicycling more. I was wrong because most people seems to take more taxis and drove their cars more often. Ishhhhh.... Such a pollution week! I guess public transportation IS AFTER ALL, VERY IMPORTANT TO EVERYONE OF US. :p

After handing-in my logbook and final papers, I went home to give myself a little break in front of the tube.  After all this effort, I really deserve a break! aww...  So, I end-up staying awake and cleaning around the house, instead of taking a nap, like I should. But, it was as satisfying because I saw how neat and clean my house was. Therefore, I decided to buy myself a little gift! A lovely daisy bouquet^^  Ohhh...They smell so nice~  Hey! Wait a minute! I have a boyfriend...Why do I have to buy my own flowers? stu stu stu...  Now, when should I start to worry about my final exam in EXCI? >.<

      Today, I have one thing to be thankful for...I am thankful for arcade car racing games. Why?  I was driving to work this morning, and the road was very slippery. I was only driving 90km/h. Then, when I decided to break because I was heading to close to the vehicle in front of me. Suddenly, my tires slipped, and my breaks refused to work as I command. (i.e: I really had to change my all seasons' tires for winter tires)  So, I tried to control my wheel and the direction of my vehicle. Luckily, no cars were around me because I could have had an accident with at least two cars.  For this moment, the incident reminds me of one of the car racing game on wet roads. Luckily, I have been practicing my driving skills...Unintentionally, I meant~  Thank you arcade race games!

      I gave my resignation at BCBG today. I felt guilty leaving the store after half of year of work because I never thought that I would quit a job in this short period. I still have two weeks of work at BCBG, I do hope I'll make more sales to compensate my loss. ^^ I think I am too kind...  On January 5th, I will be starting my training at Ogilvy. I will be working at the cash office, I just can't wait because I know this is a job that I would want to keep after my graduation in May 2004.  It was a crazy Boxing Day, people were everywhere at the store. I hope the security was tight enough to prevent thieves.

      Christmas day will be over in any minutes...I really don't know how I should feel right now. My family's restaurant is in a rush and a lot of customers came in for a fest. The restaurant was so busy that there was a waiting line for meals to be served. Some customers were frustrated for the waiting and some were understanding. It was so hard for the chefs because they were only two in the kitchen. With a lot of starving customers, I can't remember how many times we apologized for the lateness.  My mother asked me to work at the cash today because my brother had an headache from the morning dim sum rush hour. Almost every restaurants were closed for Christmas. It is funny how many times I was asked by a Caucasian, if Chinese ever celebrate Christmas. For some, I replied. Some families would gather up in some Chinese restaurants for a big fest. Yeah! A big fest with the whole family like I used to have in the past years.  My family was supposed to eat together, today. But, the restaurant's rush forbid us from joining the rest of the family. My mom was busy in the kitchen, and I was struggling at the cash. I hate numbers, and I hate noise. I totally get distracted when people talk to me when I am busy with some other things. I feel so bad...I really had a bad temper, tonight for a while. I think I even scared my love away.  I feel so bad...I couldn't enjoy this special day with him. I feel so bad...I was angry for no reason. I feel so bad about tonight.  Yet, I feel happy for the restaurant. I think we beat the record of the year. So many unexpected big tables.  It was amazing. It was also surprising how many phone calls we received. So many customers called-in to ask whether or not we were open.   It'll be midnight soon, some families are still eating at the restaurant. I wonder when the evening will end...  Have to go downstairs at the restaurant again...I suddenly hope that customers stop coming-in.  Merry Christmas! I will be having   BBQ Turkey for Christmas...:p

      We had another gift-exchange on Sunday night...I meant tonight? Yeah...ON Sunday December 21! It was at my family's restaurant NEW PEKIN with most of my closest friends!^^ The meal was very nice! There were so many plates and food to taste! It has been such a long time since I ate there! YEahh...I rarely have had a meal at the restaurant during the time I live above it from then to now.  Ho ho ho ^0^ So, I have no idea what I have interesting in the menu! :(  We were 10 people doing the gift exchange event: Caroline, Jo, Sing, Ewe, Teng, Trong, Mae, Dave, Katay, and Myself! ^^ I receive a Stainless desk mug from Jo:) I love it so much because I always wanted one! Thanx a lot JO ^^  We went to bowling, afterward! Thank God I still had the energy to play after those crazy events!  I am still awake, after Katay told me to go to bed early! I was so exhausted that I slept in the car, on the way home. Katay was so nice to drive Mae to her house! I can't imagine taking one and a half bus and metro on a Sunday night (I meant after midnight)  I have to sleep now...Before I start to type whatever crap is on my mind...

      It was such a crazy night I had... Or may I also say that I had a crazy MORNING???  My day stated on Saturday, December 20 at 7am, after having only 3 hours of sleep from the night between Friday and Saturday. I worked from 9h to 6h pm. It was such a unpleasant day as a seller. This store was so dead! BCBG is really doing bad during christmas time to compare with any other months of the day. Well, It is an fancy expensive store...Who want to spend over 200$ on one single gift? haa haaa...  After my work, I went to eat sushi at Sakura with some friends! We had an gift-exchange x-mas party! The food was okay! But, the atmosphere was very warm and fun! I had a lot of fun eating there tonight!  Then, by 10pm...The night was still on the road! I had to go to my friend Khammy's house to join her before we went to Club Sona! Yeah...I went clubbin' or should I say ravin'? The event started from 2am till 9am.  Most people there were on drugs such as Weed* and Speed*...Some of the people I went with took Speed to stay awake! Of course, I didn't touch those things...NO WAY! I took Coffee before the night, instead! ha haaa...  So I slept like 3 hours during two day...I am still awake for an unknown reason...I should go to bed now. I feel to week! My body aches! ><

      I just came back from Khammy's house! We have had a dinner party together with her friends and sisters! It was very fun! We made sushis and Tamakhoung (Papaya salad). For dessert, we had chocolate fondue (Yes, again...It was my suggestion) I met some friends of hers, tonight! And most of them were much other than me. But, I felt okay....We got along pretty well tonight, I think!  At her house, she has a lot of animals...A puppy, a miniature poddle, a cat, a rabbit, and some fishes...A real pet store! Wow...This is my kind of a house! One of her dog is called Pocky, she is so adorable and cute! I kinda wanted to take her home with me ^^ (Shhh...It's my secret plan)  So, I finally saw "Finding Nemo"...A movie from Disney! I love it so much! Nemo is so cute! I want to buy one... Now, all I have to do is to convince Katay is buy a "clown fish" as his pet fish! hee hee hee...  Oh pretty please...Or I'll be naming our kid (If, ever) Nemo^^

      This will be the last blog before year 2004. This year 2003 has been amazing...and somehow a little bit too crazy:p  First of all, I've suddenly realized that I've changed 3 jobs in one year...Second, my family opened a Chinese restaurant call Pekin. Third, I finally found my true love and now, happily dating Mr. Kentaro. Fourth, I moved to another house. And fourth, I finally got an "A" in one of my courses...I am too happy =^^=  What a great year...  I wonder what Year 2004 is expecting for me. Who knows? I might become millionnaire...I wish! It is too early to start dreaming...It is time to go to work, now!  I am going to Ewe's house for the countdown tonight! Hope it'll be a blast! We are having chocolate fondue! Youppi^^  Bye bye 2003!

      I went on a little trip with Katay to Quebec city on Monday. When we arrived at the city, it was already sunset...Luckily, it wasn't as chilly that night! We visited the Old Quebec sites, and we ate cheese fondue at a Breton restaurant called "Au Petit Coin Breton". The food was great, although it tasted almost the same in every single dish. From appetizer to meal course, there was always the taste of garlic and onions. :p hmmm...  After the meal, we went to a Amusement Arcade, funny how I discovered the fun of DDR and Initial D. I am really starting to enjoy going to arcades...Am I bad?  It was surprising to see how many Japanese tourists on the street during our visit to Quebec city. Quebec is no doubt one of many great sites in Canada to visit. (Of course, Montreal is still No.1 on the list! haa haa haaa...)  We also went to see the exposition of "Asterix and the Romans" and many other topics at the Museum of Civilisation of Quebec. It was a surprise to us, when we heard that the entrance to the museum was free. We visited at least 4 different sections of the museum. My favorite tour was about The Middle Age called "Gratia Dei". We have had a tour guide along our visit, the guide introduced important characteristics during the period  of Middle Age. It was fun and interesting because it was like a story-telling. That is what I called learning and having fun at a same time.  We left Quebec city around 5h30pm...Snif snif! Have to go back to Montreal one day! Quebec is a very great place to visit...But Montreal is the best place to live. I LOVE MONTREAL!  I spent a wonderful time there...Thanx Katay! =^0^=  Sarang hee yoh!

      It is already Friday, I can't believe that I've went to all of my classes already. I have so many books to buy and many of them are so expensive!! I am really broke now :(  MY first week at Ogilvy was great. I've learned a lot from my training and I like the office work very much! There is many things that I have to learn at my part-time job that make this job challenging. It is so different from being a salesperson...I don't have to sale or to promote any items in order to make my day...So different, yet so great! I would miss all the clothes though because I like to see what is trendy.  I don't know what to write anymore because the house is so cold. I guess mother nature decided to give us misery in Montreal. The heat is not fonctioning as it should...I think I'll get a cold soon:( snif snif...

      It will be a week since we had heat in our house...I am not getting used to the coldness at all...Unable to shower correctly at the night, and unable to move around the house without shivering. I entered my house with a smoke of heat coming out of my mouth, like I just step outside on a breezing winter day. I feel that there is no longer a difference between outside and inside of my house, anymore. How can people live with such conditions? I asked myself so many times. But, when I think that homeless people live on the street on harsher conditions, I still think to be lucky to be living in a house.  How long will this misery persist? I don't know...Lack of money in every way. I just hope that the weather will be nicer tomorrow...Winning the Super 7 could be nice!

      The day was misery, I never felt so tired in my whole life...Going to work was a torture this morning. I should have listened to Katay and to go to bed as soon as I showered, last night. Suddenly, sleeping 6 hours was no longer effective to rebuilt my energy. Maybe it is because I kept waking up at night to pull my blankets closer to myself or maybe it was the disturbing noise that the electrical heater made.  I woke up very early this morning because my dog was coughing really badly. It was like a big cough or something that was tickling her throat. My mom thinks she got sick because of the cold. We even gave Bobo a little sweater to keep her warm. But, it didn't seem to do much. We have to bring her to the vet. And yet, with what money?  I came back home around 6 pm with a very unfortunate news waiting for me...The electrical room caught on fire! It was a relief for me, when I saw no smoke when I entered the restaurant. The lights were all closed and I saw the firefighters departing the restaurant after their job was done. A big silence persist. (In my head, I guess) I saw my mom and my brother standing in front of me...I was happy to see that they are okay. I went to the kitchen...I asked if everyone is okay. I was more than happy to hear that no one was hurt. Our Chef told me that there was smoke coming out of the electrical room. I was scared. Then, I rushed upstairs to see if everything was okay.  It was funny because the house was warmer than in the morning. The house's heat was on...And it was very hot! My mom told me not to worry. How can I not be? My brother told me that the electrician, this afternoon, have put too many wires, for electricity. The electrician should have considered the fact that this building was too old to support so much electricity. Hopefully, insurance will pay for the damage...The electrician is the one to blame.   I feel that, the business is not running well, tonight. What can we expect from customers, when half of the restaurant has no electricity?   Year 2004 is only beginning...And so many things have happened in front of us. Will the future be brighter for my family this year? I hope so... Wait a sec... Chinese New Year hasn't begun yet. Technically, the bad luck we had will be in the past. Perhaps, year 4701 in the lunar calendar is reserving luck, fortune, prosperity, wealth, and respect. In a Chinese saying "Let all the bad luck pass through us, the good luck will be waiting for us."

      After spending the whole day, at home, in the coldness of winter, I suddenly realized how lucky I was, when I lived at my other house.  I had a garden...But,  now I have a balcony. I had a nice kitchen...But, now I have a kitchen that cannot be used. Moreover, I had heat all around my house...But, now I only have a little heater to warm me up.  The more I live in this house, the more I hate it...I tried so many times to like it! I should be grateful to have a roof under my head. What is wrong with me? No one choose to move in here...It was a sacrifice that my family took to run this business. (A business that most families envy...)  I woke up on a Saturday morning with no heat to warm me up. The building was freezing because the weather was freezing cold outside. The heat systems was down because of some electrical problems. It was the first time in my life that I see a white smoke coming out of my mouth when I speak inside of the house. I felt like I was inside an Igloo.   In this house, I can't even open my electrical heater while boiling water...I can't watch TV while using the microwave...I can't put the heater on at my mom's room while using another heater in my room. WHAT KIND OF A HOUSE IS THIS?  I just can't wait to go to work and to go to school...At least, I won't have to worry about seating on a freezing toilet bowl to do my deed (Well, you know what I am talking about!)

      I just came back from my friend's birthday party about half an hour ago. A dinner party on a Wednesday night, and karaoke on a school night! Wouahhhh! That is a first! I never quite imagine how cool it was to go to "Cash Box" during the weekdays, especially when every students are having their mid-terms! We took the whole salon by ourselves....with only 9 cutomers in it! haa haa! I sang too much in one night! My troat is suffering from it now!  I kinda wished I came back home earlier...I missed Mr. Rabbit's call :(

      It is Valentine's day today... A day where couples use it as a reason to celebrate their love for each other! Do we really need valentine's day? What was it intended to do anyways? If, you trully love someone, shouldn't you be celebrating your love each time you see him/her? Why do we always have to wait for this special day to treat someone with love? I don't need one day to tell a person, that I love, that I love him.   It is sooooooo about commercials and profits! The only things V-day does is to encourage people to spend more money on presents and to make their lovers fat because of chocolates~  I do love Valentine's day, though! If, it wasn't for V-day shy people wouldn't know how to send cards or gifts to their crush!   So, is Valentine's day a romantic day or a day filled with taboo? This is for you to judge!  I love you ^0^ ( I meant my mom, my brothers, my dog, my friends...And my one and true love, Katay)

      I am letting myself down,again...I should have studied since I've finished eating dinner. Instead, I spent the whole three hours playing games on MSN. These games are really addicting! hmmmm...  I have a headache, again! Why do I always have to have an headache when I need to concentrate the most? hmmm...  I am still tired from the lack of sleep I had last week. I told myself to take a little nap when I come back to school... I wonder what happened here... hmmmmmm...  Ten chapters to catch up for next week! I feel like dying right now!

      I learned a lesson these past few days... "Never get too addicted in making stars out of straws." My tumb is in pain right now! It takes up to 4 minutes per star.  (^_^;)  I still wonder if it still worth it to make so much! I only wanted to filled up my bottle and to use up all the straws I bought for it! Anyhow...The result is so beautiful! I think I am going to keep this bottle for once (^o^)v

      William Hung...Is a famous rising "STAR"?!? Since the day American Idol aired William Hung's audition on January 27th 2004, all I hear was about how great and amazing William Hung is. For so long, I wondered why he was liked so much...Until I watched his audition on his official website!  Woooh...This guy has his own fanclub website! This is so incredible! ^.^  So, he seems like a fun and loving person. He seems friendly with everyone and definetly not afraid of showing "what he can do on the stage". Moreover William Hung is liked and admired by hundreds of fans because of his attitudes of confidence of doing his best and having no regrets for trying. This is the power of William Hung! (^o^)v  Wait a sec... Do people really like him for his attitude or are they laughing at him for his "talents"??? What do the media really meant when they say that "William Hung is a very unique person" or "no one quite like William Hung" or "Unique experience for having him in the studio"? I just think that the majority of people are laughing at him when he sings, and when they give praise or encouragements. I think his so-called "fans" are so mean!!!  A dedicated to William Hung fanclub website??? HAAAaaah...Which girl is really true when they said about marrying William Hung?  All this is just crazy....Why should people make fun of a guy, praise him for his unfortunate "talent" and put a clown hat on his head at the same time? At the end, the only person who will get hurt is...the star himself, William Hung!  Don't get me wrong...I really like William Hung's attitudes about performing in public...But, what some media is doing to him is just plain evil! :9  To conclude... William Hung, I admire your courage! Cheers~ (^_^)v

        I've just came back from Yalan's party. She'll will be going on a mission for 18 months. That'll be 18 months before I can see her beautiful and cheerful smile again. It is so hard to see a friend leaving us for so long...But, I guess we all have our own way to go. Someday, friends will be separated due to job, family, and new life experiences. I am so mad at myself for not being a good friend this past year. For not calling often, and not going out so often... She'll come back eventually...And when this day will come, I hope that our friendship will still be as strong as before. I am so happy that she has accomplished one of her biggest wishes in life. I do hope all the best for her. Hopefully, Yalan will remain the same as today...Cause I still need a friend like Yalan in my life. Don't we all? ^o^  ~Yalan,            I hope the best for you. Hope we keep on touch...during your mission and after your mission, whether what stage in life we are in. 18 months is nothing...In a blink, and you'll be back! (^_- )  right?

      There are many reasons why classmates suddenly become nice to you. One of the most obvious reason is to get copies from your notes. I don't remember having a lot of real friends at school. Most of them just want a person, who they can rely on when they decide to skip a class or to miss a class due to some "illness".  Why me? I can't remember how many times I've been ask to borrow my notes. I don't think I write the best notes...They seems clear but I really don't think they are the best.  So, how can someone knows that he/she has find the best person to borrow notes from? I, myself, usually go for the classmate who has the most nice handwriting. Reading the handwriting on a piece of paper that I can barely understand can be real dreadful! >  One of my classmates have asked me for my notes, today. Surprisingly, she was so nice to me... She was talking to me and asking me some questions like it has been years since we knew each other. I had her in one of my other classes...and we never spoke to each other:p What made her talk to me today? haahaa...This are the wonders of communication and interactions.     Today, I feel asleep on the bus again. When I woke up, some guy was staring at me smiling. He was in his 20s, a nice tall hispanic guy...I wonder why is it so interesting to stare at someone who kept falling asleep on the bus? Of course, this is not the only time that happened to me. I have been stared and smiled at many times when I fell asleep on the bus or metro... Weird isn't it? I wonder if I talked in my dreams or something?  (^^=)

      People often misunderstood the meaning for having an online journal. When someone decides to post something on the internet, that doesn't mean the content is personal or confidential. An online journal is meant to be read by the public or those who are interested in peaking into people's thoughts...  What am I thinking today? ^^  Well, I am thinking that it is silly not to click on a web link when the posting of one message was intentional. If, I didn't want anyone to know about anything on the net, I would have written it in my personal journal (hard copy) Right? :p  Speaking of journals, I realized that I have two online journals; one that is active, and one that is not-really-that-active-online journal! hee hee...

      Another week has ended, and another week is beginning! There is not a lot of time left till the end of this semester. I wonder if I should feel happy or stressed out by now! I am definitely stressed out for sure! I have so many assignments due next week! I feel like going crazy~  During this lovely weekend, I spent some wonderful time at work! Talking about it...It has been years since I had my weekends off! No! I am lying I had one weekend off last January! That was one weekend in 3 years? Hmm...What is the feeling of sleeping-in on a Saturday morning again?     It was the first day of spring today...What is snow doing here? It shouldn't be snowing...Waaaaaaaaaaaah! I hate snow! >  It is true when they say that people tend to gain weight as they get old. But, not for everyone! I will definetly prove them wrong. I refuse to gain weight! I want to lose weight! Where are my curves? Oh yeah! I have to do more exercises to deserve a better body! Darn~ "No pain, no game!" Hmm... Can I change this sentence into "No pain, no gain!" ? Puhaaa haaa haaa...

      One of my budgies died today. I don't know why she died. My brother told me that she was probably hurt in fight with another budgie.  I believe that it was a broken heart that killed her. Her name was "ar Lam". She was a little blue budgie born in my house. Her father was blue and her mother was a beautiful yellow budgie. As the eldest bird left in the cage, I guess she struggled to gain property in the cage. No budgies wanted her because she was old and fragile. We have two couples of budgies who are having little babies. All the females are nesting, except "ar Lam". No male budgies even dare to glance at her. So, now "ar Lam" is gone. All the males are outside of the black box waiting for the birth of their babies, and all the females are nesting. Why are budgies so cruel? They didn't even show respect or mourning for the dead budgie.  My brother had the idea of wrapping "ar Lam" in a empty granola box. Moreover, he put some seeds over her and burnt a candle, like it was a real funeral. Puhaa~ What a sensitive geek! haa haa...

It is so un-cool to leave things for the last minute. I will have to kick myself harder to do better in the future! I still have one final on Friday! I just hope to pass it! I will be so happy to just pass all my courses now! Seems like I've become more stupid by the day! Studying for the wrong questions and forgetting to study for a topic... when will my studying days be over? Fed-up? You bet! I just want to pass my courses! Please pray with me! Wish me loads of luck! I feel like crying all all the stupid mistakes i've done on my last two finals, right now!  Doubting about my future right now! I want to good job related with my degree! I will have to kick myself again to send CVs next week! Me, proud? ha haa haa...Not, right now! Not, right now!

Then, when I am at work, I don't even mind doing most of the office work! Hmmmm...this is bad!  I can't even stand being at home doing nothing now! It is sooooooooo boring! >. Now, do I really need vacations? I need to go on trips, staying at home is definetly a torture!

Sure, having no more homeworks, assignments, readings, tests, and lectures really seemed cool?! :p But, after spending two days at home vegetating...I am starting to feel useless!  Gotta find something to do! Gotta find another job! What job can I do? Snif snif! :(

            Voici une petite pensée qui ramène les 2 pieds    sur terre.         Imaginez que chaque matin, une banque vous ouvre un compte de 86 400$ - tout    ce que vous n'avez pas dépensé dans la journée vous est enlevé le soir.         Vous ne pouvez pas tricher, ne pouvez pas virer cet argent sur un autre compte,    ne pouvez que le dépenser mais chaque matin au réveil, la banque vous rouvre    un nouveau compte, avec à nouveau 86 400$ pour la journée.   &nbsp;    Deuxième règle : La banque peut interrompre ce &quot;jeu&quot; sans préavis; à n'importe    quel moment elle peut vous dire que c'est fini, qu'elle ferme le compte et    qu'il n'y en aura pas d'autre.   &nbsp;    Que feriez-vous? À mon avis, vous dépenseriez chaque dollar à vous faire    plaisir, et à offrir quantité de cadeaux aux gens que vous aimez.   &nbsp;    Cette banque magique existe vraiment, nous l'avons tous, c'est le temps!   &nbsp;    Chaque matin, au réveil, nous sommes crédités de 86 400 secondes de vie pour    la journée, et lorsque nous nous endormons le soir, il n'y a pas de report.&nbsp;    Ce qui n'a pas été vécu dans la journée est perdu, hier vient de passer.&nbsp;    Chaque matin, cette magie recommence.   &nbsp;    Nous jouons avec cette règle incontournable: la banque peut fermer notre    compte à n'importe quel moment, sans aucun préavis; à tout moment, la vie peut    s'arrêter.         Alors qu'en faisons-nous de nos 86 400 secondes quotidiennes? &quot;La vie est    courte, même pour ceux qui passent leur temps à la trouver longue?...&quot;            Alors profitez-en !      &nbsp;

      Today, seems to be the most interesting day I ever had at a daycare centre! I never really worked with babies (18-24 months), it took me a while before I got used to it! As an educator and a  BA graduate in Child Studies, I truly believe that you can never learn everything from books and lecture classes. I didn't even know how to change a diaper or to entertain them. I had all my 4 yrs old's activities readay this morning, but I didn't even use them because, the principal put me into a classroom with babies! > All the preparations wasted!  I smell like puke and peepee...Children are so dirty! But, so cute^^  I learned how to change diapers, today. I think I am becoming more and more handy!!! It is one of the first time that I saw so many "peepees" in one day! What is a peepee? hmmmf! Please! Don't play innocent...I am pretty sure you know what I am talking about^^

      Starting this week, I will be busy like a bee, working every single day from 9am-5pm. In addition to my part-time job, as a clerk at Ogilvy, I will be working 3 days a week at a daycare center! I don't know why I've promised them that...I must be crazy or something! I won't be having any summer this year neither! Anyhow, it is always good to make some more money^^ I surely need it to pay off all my debts! >< I am so broke! waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

      For the past few weeks, I've been lacking energy to update any on my journals! I failed to surf on the net because I have been too busy with my 7/7 days of work :(  Summer? I will have none! Not until the end of august, I guess!  In a few days (Thursday, June 10th), I will attend my own convocation ceremony. Talking of it makes me a little bit nervous! I will go up on the stage and have a Restor caps me by tapping my hat on my shoulder, then I will receive my diploma from the Dean Faculty, and I will shake hands with the Dean. This is suppose to be tradition when you graduate from a BA. A Masters or a Doctor have their own traditions.  Now, how to lose 5 pounds in 5 days? I don't know why, but I feel that my body is going through a yo-yo phase just on and off! Ishhh! ><

       I really don't know how to describe my feelings right now.  I just came back from the daycare centre after being told that "I was not needed, today". Should I be happy or mad? It takes me about 30 minutes to prepare myself and a good 40 minutes of traveling to arrive at the daycare centre. How could they assume that I would not be coming? I didn't even called for another sick day > Well, I should not be complaining since, I am still sick, and another day of rest would be great for me. I didn't feel like staying sick in front of the children, anyways. So, I have been layed off and sent home. So another 40 minutes was wasted. I should have called in sick, so I could have slept all this time. >  So, I am pretty wake-up,now...How can I go back into my sleep?  How about another game of Gunbound to calm my nerves down! hmm...Better get some herbal tea, first!

      My my, oh-my...I hate being sick on a beautiful sunny day! I can't beleive that I have finally gave in my first sick-day. How can I work with children while sneezing and caughing:( I never really took a sick-day from work. When I was sick, during school year, I've always been in school... No matter what!  So, am I supposed to stay in bed all day? I am so tired of sleeping, my head is starting to ache! snif snif

      I've been working too much lately. 7 days a week is a little bit to much to do during all summer long! I know that it has been weeks since I had a good night of sleep. I don't even remember how it is to feel satisfied after sleeping all day^^ Bahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! Sleeping-in is a lazy habit that no one should take, anyways.  I've been chatting with sonce friend, yesterdat. I can't believe that he actually feels bad about the amount of work I have and the lack of vacation I have for myself. Haaaaaaaaaaaa...At least I am paid for what I do! It isn't like some volunteer work that I did years ago.   Overworked? YEahh...I'm feeling the stress and the lack of energy, now. Especially when I feel that my eyelids are dropping as I write this blog. :P  So, are you asking why I haven't updated my blog as recent as before? Well, it is pretty obvious...I am so dead tired >  ZzzzZZ  huh...Not yet! I am going to see Harry Potter and the prisoner of Azkaban! I hope it'll be good! I don't have the intention of sleeping in the theatre for the first time =^o^=

      Private daycares sucks~ I've been working for almost two months at a private daycare, now. I can't wait to get myself out of there!  Not enough toys, not enough materials to work on, unsecure doors with no inside locks...Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!  Parents pay too much for this kind of a service for their children when compared to CPE daycares.  I love children so much, I love to take care of babies. Sometimes, I kinda wished I had kids of my own so, I could share my toys with the children at the daycare. Most of the educators bring their own toys, classroom decorations, and classroom activities + materials. hmmmmmmm...How awful does it sound?  Listen to this, educators who are paid $8.50/hour have to use their own money to satisfy the children at the daycare? Gess...  I am so happy that I am only doing some replacements there. Next week will be my last week at the daycare! I am so relief~ I must find a career in CPEs, now!  Snif snif...I will miss the babies so much! All the kuddlings, laughters, feedings, and changing their diapers >.<

      It's July already^^...Time does fly when you are doing nothing special! No school, no studies...Gesss! I got to find myself something more productive to do, other than work!  I do work a lot lately, despite some sick days that I had...I've been working most of the time to earn more money and to repay all my debts! Working does not necessarily means to have more pocket money. I realized finally how hard it is to save an extra dollard, $20, $100, or a $1000???  During a discussion about money with some friends this week, a friend gave some suggestions about how to earn more money with ING direct and to have some tax savings from RRSP. So, I've got into this stage of life where money can be good, if we invest to earn some money! I have so much to learn about money earning! Now, where can I get that easy extra money to put aside!  I really don't want anymore debts or deficit! noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!  Well, maybe I could bare with some more debts when I'll buy my first car, house, country house? boat? business? :p Who knows what will come up?

       I am really starting to believe that I am a workaholic.   Last month, I was busy because I worked 7 days a week; working as a clerk at Ogilvy (my usual work place) and working as an educator at a daycare center. My mind and body became so tired that I got sick at the end of June.   Now, that my job as an educator is over. I've decided to accept the book-keeper position that a friend of my mom introduced me to. As if, it wasn't enough to work 40 hours a week at Ogilvy's...:9   I am currently working 12 hours more as a book-keeper.   hoo hoo hoo...   Money in, money in, money in and money outtttttttttttttt...     It it so sad, since I can't  actually spend it. I have to pay my debts, and I have to at  tempt to bring up   my savings. wahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh...That sucks!      Suffering...Yarning...kicking...Sooooooo  o damn tired right now! I can't believe that I am doing a 12 hours shift today!      =^.^= Onh...Have you heard? I got a kitten from a co-worker   at Ogilvy's. Little Biko-chan is so cute! He is orange with a little bit of yellow!   Hey! I am like a busy full time mother and full time worker. Can I get any subvention or aid from an organization for poor recent graduates? ho ho hoo...
