         The Mysterious thing called "LOVE"....          If you find yourself in love with someone who does not love you,   be gentle with yourself.   There is nothing wrongwith you. Love just didn't choose to rest in the otherperson's heart.     If you find someone else in love with you and you don't love him/her, feel honored that love came and called at yourdoor, but gently refuse the gift you cannot return. Do nottake advantage, do not cause pain.   How you deal with love is how you deal with you, and all our hearts feel the same pains and joys, even if our livesand ways are different...   If you fall in love with another, and he/she falls inlove with you, and then love chooses to leave, do not try toreclaim it or to assess blame, let it go. There is a reasonand there is a meaning. You will know in time...   Remember that you don't choose love. Love chooses you. Allyou can really do is accept it for all its mystery when itcomes into your life. Feel the way it fills you tooverflowing, then reach out and give it away.Give it back to the person who brought it alive in you. Give it to others who deem it poor in spirit. Give it to theworld around you in anyway you can....   There is where many lovers go wrong. Having been so long without love, they understand love only as a need. They see their hearts as empty places that will be filled by love, and they begin to look at love as something that flows to them rather than from them-   The first blush of new love is filled to overflowing,but as their love cools, they revert to seeing their love as a need. They cease to be someone who generates love andinstead become someone who seeks love.They forget that the secret of love is that it is a gift, and that it can be made to grow only by giving it away.   Remember this, and keep it to your heart. Love has its owntime, its own seasons, and its own reason for coming and going. You cannot bribe it or coerce it, or reason it intosaying. You can only embrace it when it arrives and give it away when it comes to you.    But if it chooses to leavefrom your heart or from the heart of your lover, there is nothing you can do and there is nothing you should do.Love always has been and always will be a mystery.Be glad that it came to live for a moment in your life....        got this from a friend's friendster board message...amp! panay lab na ko a.. hahaha.. am scared... really scared. pramis... its not that i don't wanna accept it.. it's more of like.. i don't think im prepared to get hurt again...   stupid stupid me.. cno ba naman ang ayaw magmahal at mahalin ren diba? hindi na tao un...awwww.. its so obvious that errol (mahbaby sa ro.. actually.. its not like "kame" prang nasanay lang,,, kung yung iba jan TAE tawag sakin,, parang ganun ren ke errol... baby nga lang.. hahaha) is in love.. and im so happy for him... ako ren kaya?? hahaha..   wag muna...   sbi nman ni kinky.. baka daw maiwanan ako...e di ganto nalang..

        Drastic Thoughts... what i always had in me... anyway, here's my new blog page... another way of sharing to whoever it is that's interested.. my point of view..my world.     &nbsp;   i've been playing an online game since my last encounter with pain. "Diversional Therapy" as we call it. It was quite effective, i learned how to laugh again, make friends, and open minds...    however... it has consumed me... all of me...     &nbsp;   i slept at around 8-9AM... waiting for "someone" to finally show up. Anyways, what's bothering me is the fact that i get too absorbed by this game.. as well as some players that i know of..   i'm planning on quitting soon.. after all it's just a game, a role playing game- before it gets the best of me...   but i learned a lot...met a lot of people who helped me grow in someways...friendship.     &nbsp;   i woke up at like 5-6 pm... im not really sure, quite lost track of time since ive been "involved" in the game so much.    logged on... and checked my mails...read some old stuffs from a particular person whom i have crossed paths with... a certain "michael".. how long has it been.- it made me smile -    but smiles don't last...thoughts do linger only for period of time...people change...time passes... same ol same ol...     &nbsp;   then i started to think about me... what have i become after all these years...25 to be exact...then i saw nothing...    my head started to rattle and think about death all of a sudden...smoked and played and smoked and played...but empty still...i'm just so clueless. un lang un...    i wanted to have a dream again.. a drive.. something that i can look forward to once more...    maybe i'll start reviewing nalang...     &nbsp;   people now see me as this dumb, clueless nada nada who's only happiness is being ONLINE... i want them to see me that way anyway...i've been playing dumb for so long that i completely forgot what it's like being what i really am... sometimes, i think&nbsp;it's better that&nbsp;people see me the way they see me now (as a slowpoke...dumb.../?...clueless about everything, broken and depressed freak of nature...)... keeps them from asking too many questions about me... i like it that way... sometimes..    but sometimes i miss my sense of freedom...i miss being the person i know i am.. i guess im just afraid that they wouldn't be able to "dig" that. We do more to please other people than ourselves...just to feel that&nbsp;we "belong".    Why do we have to feel that we "belong" anyway? ... what a shitty question.     &nbsp;   DYSTONIC- my current mood... i just laughed a while ago though...sa guild... they were making fun of everyone...it was happy anyway... "love" was the topic...hahaha...(insidious laugh)     &nbsp;   so un lang.. for my 1st blog, this is quite borrrrring...i know... u don't have to tell me that...    believe me.. im quite aware of how boring i get... MOST OF THE TIME.    so un lang muna... been listening to JEWEL's -FOOLISH games...    "these foolish games...are tearing me apart" -got me thinkin again... drastic thoughts...     &nbsp;   but im more in a "bloody romance" mood right now... by senses fail... here are the words:     Life, is floating fast away.  But I look, your head is turned away.  From the moment you left I knew that something wasn't right.  But the feeling inside has kept me up all night.  You and me are like one heart-beat.  SO SLICE open my veins.  AND LET the romance bleed away.  From the moment you left I knew that something wasn't right.  But the feeling inside has kept me up all night.  You and me are like one heart-beat.  Back into I thought I knew, these words inside me, tell me what to do.  My heart held, in the palm of your hand.  (Forget my name) Now I know, the way to go, this place inside my demented mind.  (Forget my name) You saw me bleeding on the bathroom floor.  (Forget my name) This time in silence, this time I win.     &nbsp;

BIGTIME... i guess the only thing that was nice about him was his voice... fone voice... hahaha...e un lang nman talaga e... i couldnt even possibly imagine myself spending the rest of my life with him... he's so.. RAGNAROK.. panay RO... as in kung addik ako... sha... ibang klase... he lives for the game... ok i admit.. i do that sometimes.. pero ibang klase sha... GRABE.. un lang.. saka  lagi sha pa boost sakin tapos amp.. ni a ni o na TY wala... galit pa pag na ded... tingnan mo nga naman ugali.. kaka badtrip..eniwei... not my loss...   never mine...      balik soundtrip and vcd mode hahaha.. la na ka phone pal e.. ahihih... eniweis... sabi nga...   "IM BETTER OF ALONE ANYWAY..."       im in like with this song:      WORLD SO COLD   When passion's lost and all the trust is gone Way too far, for way too long Children crying, cast out and neglected Only in a World so cold, only in a World this cold Hold the hand of your best friend Look into their eyes Then watch them drift away Some might say, we've done the wrong things For way too long, for way to long Fever inside the storm So I'm turning away Away from the name (Calling your names) Away from the stones (Throw sticks and stones) 'Cause I'm through mending the wounds of us Keep your thorns 'Cause I'm running away Away from the games (Fucking head games) Away from the space (Hate this head space) The circumstances of a World so cold Burning whispers, remind me of the days I was left alone, in a World this cold Guilty of the same things, provoked by the cause I've left alone, in a World so cold Fever inside the storm So I'm turning away Away from the name (Calling your names) Away from the stones (Throw sticks and stones) 'Cause I'm through mending the wounds of us Keep your thorns 'Cause I'm running away Away from the games (Fucking head games) Away from the space (Hate this head space) The circumstances of a World so cold I'm flying, I'm flying away Away from the names (Calling your names) Away from the games (Fucking head games) The circumstances of a World so cold Why does everyone feel like my enemy? Don't want any part of depression or darkness I've had enough Sick and tired Bring the sun Or I'm gone, or I'm gone I'm backing out, I'm no pawn No mother fucking slave to this Never lied Never left Never lived Never loved Never lost Never hurt Never worry about being me, or anyone else Not a care, no concern, don't give a shit about anything Backing out, giving up No mother fucking slave to this Never lied Never left Never lived Never loved Never lost Never hurt Never worry about being me, or anyone else Not a care, no concern, don't give a shit about anything I need to find a darkened corner A lightless corner Where it's safer and calmer I'm turning away Away from the name (Calling your names) Away from the stones (Throw sticks and stones) 'Cause I'm through mending the wounds of us I'm running away Away from the games (Fucking head games) Away from the space (Hate this head space) The circumstances of a World so cold I'm flying, I'm flying away Away from the names (Calling your names) Away from the games (Fucking head games) The circumstances of a World so cold

And when you feel the pain,   I'm wishing I could stay.    How can I say I love you back,   You never made me happy...      I know! (I know!)   You'll never change!    I won't be good enough for you.   I know! (I know!)   You'll make it through, I   i'll never be around to see....

        i hate myself and i want to die.. always made the "wrong move" always chose the "wrong decisions" im sick and tired of me...wanting to try things that i know... wouldn't really work for me... im sick of giving chances to myself and to "others"... i hate myself more than you hate me... that's one thing you probably DON'T know... i hate myself so much i don't even know if i do still have.. the capacity to love... i have changed a lot... and im so sory u met me at a time like this. im sorry for hurting u if i have... in anyway deemingly possible. i am lost... i have always been since u came in my life, but i tried to find my way back with u hopefully by my side... but u were man enough to be u.. while i was scared enough to be me... things fell apart... dreams got broken and empty promises unkept... and i actually believed in some parts of what u said... that you will never leave me no matter what... but then again... maybe i was just trying to live a dream... u lost nothing... and anyway it's not supposed to matter to me anymore. i never meant to lose you... but i never ever would want to lose myself with you... i just got it back.. my thoughts , my dreams and me... my heart and my love, and i realized... im not ready to give it away yet... im sorry i could never devote myself to you that way you expect me too...i am not ready, that now i know. i wanted to love you...i really did and i did try... but i felt terribly scared when i realized that i was falling too fast for u... and guess what. u never did catch me.

       if papa was still alive.. i wud like him to dedicate this song for me.. in case i got married... IN CASE...      "Well I want you to noticeTo notice when I'm not aroundAnd I know that your eyes see straight through meAnd speak to me without a sound   I want to hold youProtect you from all of the things I've already endured I want to show youShow you all the things that this life has in store for youI'll always love you    The way that a father should love his daughter   When I walked out this morningI cried as I walked to the doorI cried about how long I'd be away for   I cried about leaving you all alone Sweet Zoe Jane    So I wanted to say this Cuz I wouldn't know where to begin    To explain to you what I have been through   To explain where your daddy has been... Sweet Zoe Jane"   that is... if papa was still here and if i am... ever gonna be wed...    someone that i used to know has left me once again... nuthin new in that sense... i guess he just finds joy in doing stuffs like that to me... ME- the masochistic... *sigh*      and i smell someone leaving me soon... for reasons so typical of someone with his track of mind... pity... not that im thinkin of holding him still... he wants me to look at him "differently" from the way the "usual" people look at him... i am giving him that chance... but my patience is near its end... and i being a cynic.. has no hope left in me...   i want to find a way out of all this...   i need to find me...

       It's down to this...   I've got to make this life make sense    Can anyone tell what I've done    I missed the life... I missed the colours of the world    Can anyone tell where I am    'Cause now again I've found myself So far down, away from the sun    That shines into the darkest place I'm so far down, away from the sun again... Away from the sun again   I'm over this I'm tired of living in the dark    Can anyone see me down here...    The feeling's gone-     There's nothing left to lift me up   Back into the world I've known      'Cause now again I've found myself So far down, away from the sun    That shines into the darkest place I'm so far down, away from the sun    That shines the life away from me    To find my way back into the arms That care about the ones like me I'm so far down, away from the sun again    It's down to this I've got to make this life make sense    And now I can't do what I've done    And now again I've found myself So far down, away from the sun    That shines the life away from me 'Cause now again I've found myself So far down, away from the sun    That shines into the darkest place I'm so far down, away from the sun    That shines the life away from me To find my way back into the arms    That care about the ones like me I'm so far down,    away from the sun again...
