       _I woke up like any other summer morning, but today my maternal parental unit decided that I should clean my room. Although I begrudged the activity, I knew it had to be done. Most of the family's out of the house now, but yeah.... So I started by cleaning up the schoolwork. The recycling bin (the big blue one) is full to the rim, and the trash can is on its way. Lots of memories in some of the papers, but memories come and go. Vaccuumed too; let in some light and fresh air. Then I set to work on my clothes. My drawers were so messy before; now they're all organized; well for the most part, for now. Next, I suppose will be my closet, and then organizing my desk and the shelves that make up the head of my bed. Vaccuum in the area trapped between the bed and the wall. Dust  everything . Set everything straight. Hopefully, I'll be able to breathe more healthily in the nights to come. The goal was to not allow myself to get meningitis (>_ _I don't know if I want to go to my aunt's party because I have no idea what it's for! (XB) However, that's not uncommon for our family. I hardly know my family on my mother's side, just my close relatives like first cousins. On the other hand, I know most of my dad's side pretty well, mostly because they live in the vicinity of San Diego, whereas my mom's family is scattered all over California, Washington, Canada, Everywhere! Once I go to college, I wonder if I'll even have time for family... I definitely want to remain active; not for sports' sake, but for my own health. It's ridiculous how out of shape I am right now. I've been meaning to run in the mornings and sometimes at nights, but I've been kept awake by the creative writing bursts, which never seem to come at an appropriate or convenient time... _Eh... I started trying that idea I had of an oekaki comic strip for practice, but I didn't realize how much I sucked at it (>_ at least ). Once I get my driver's license, most of the worst complications will get cleared up, and I will be so happy. I've grown so tired of having to wait for my parents to pick me up all the time or bum rides off people or walking home. It's so stinky. _I hope this blog doesn't become a burden like the deadjournal did. It would get to the point like Mr. Kutzner's reflections, where I would have to force myself to think of something on which to reflect. With this blog, everything just seems to flow out onto the keyboard. *sigh*. Okay, mom left, so I'd better get back to cleaning. ~Spamu signing out!

       _Bored out of my mind as of now. I guess I could do something productive, but that would require effort of which I have not, at least, over summer. We kind of have a flea problem with our pets, and a few of them got into our family room. That last statement kinda seems random, but it's actually a segueway into another random statement. So, anyways, I was hiding on the couch from the fleas, and two jumped on my leg. I caught one and tried to kill it, but when I checked to see if it had died, it jumped away. T_T. _One thing has always been a mystery to me. I thought there might be some authority pertaining to this subject, but I have yet to see a definitive statement. What it is: Are Filipinos considered Asians or Pacific Islanders? ... Okay, so I asked a Filipino friend who is more closely associated with our ethnic background, and he says we think we're Pacific Islanders, while I hear from Margaret Cho that we're Asians. I've added up and balanced all the stereotypes in a mental Venn diagram, but it seems we're stuck in this gray zone. This has plagued my mind on many a standardized test. In any case, I've decided to put that aside for now and just accept whatever labels I receive. Except that being a Pacific Islander might have benefits in scholarships C,C. I've never really associated race with people. It's always just been person and person. Not until recently, in our studies, have such things as racism been brought to the forefront. _For some reason, I've found my muse again. I'm not quite sure what it is exactly, but I've been on a writing spree lately. I've been staying up 'til six in the morning just writing. Actually, on a material basis, I have not made it that far since the beginning of summer, but the fact that the juices are flowing in my mind again makes me glad. I wanted to start a comic just for summer. "Suburbania." I suppose Peanuts already covered that, but I s'pose I could take it a step further. It would just be an exercise in practicing drawing on my tablet, since I cannot scan as of now and still do not have Photoshop when people all around me do. I've had the urge to draw lately, but I'm afraid that if I start it up and fail I won't want to do it anymore. Or worse, I won't want to get my summer work done. _Recently, my self-esteem's been pretty low. I don't really like myself. I can't blame it on media or oppression like other people. It's just my own inner conscience suppressing any ability of mine to accept who I am. I'm not reluctant to be who I am. Or am I? I can never tell. Confusion has always been an integral part of my life, that, at least, I've come to accept. One thing I pride myself on is my honesty, albeit, frank honesty, when it comes to how I feel towards others, but unlike MacBeth, I lie to myself. I don't think I'm quite ready to talk about everything that goes on internally, but I  am  making progress. _With all this free time on my hands, I've been able to take a step back and view the world and people's views. For a long time now, I've wondered what could have possibly made me so bitter and cynical from the once trusting person I was my freshman year. Perhaps, being such a naive person earlier made it that much more difficult to cope later on. eh... but what do I know? Self-examination and self-assessment has never been a strong point of mine. Sometimes, I dunno, it just makes me sick to think of all the horrible things humans do. Sometimes religious zealots too, in the name of "God" or "Allah" or what-have-you. I mean, logic that even a child possesses should tell you that what you are doing is wrong. I don't see how humans can bore that hole into the very essence of what makes humans humane and replace it with the capacity to do such twisted things. Everywhere I look, hate, when there are so many good people in the world too, but their voices just aren't loud enough. They get drowned out by the sensational evil things that people do. *sigh*... It would seem nothing anyone can do will ever fix what humans have wrought upon themselves. _Oh, what? oh yes. You were wondering about the title? Well, we got Cinnamon Toast Crunch, which I have been craving for some time now, and while I was eating it, I read the box (like I always do, to keep myself occupied). And I saw Wendel the baker and wondered, "what happened to the other two bakers?" eh... *researches* AHA! http://www.lavasurfer.com/cereal-generalmills2.html Bob and Quello? huh... I'll bet Wendel ate them.

       _UGH! omfg! I don't get it. People think I'm just being petulant when it comes to my grades, and I realize that there are those who are not as well off. But I know I could have done so much better. I've turned into a slacker, and that makes me angry. YES! I realize it's my own fault, and I don't expect pity, and I don't pity myself. I want to incite change! Some people just like to think I'm crying over spilled milk. Well, guess what? this isn't farking spilled milk! Grades might not mean anything one hundred, fifty, or even ten years from now, but right now, grades are the only thing I have and the only thing that can help me make something out of my mess! Everyone has  their  thing. I don't even know what mine is yet, and when I do realize what that "thing" is, I wanna be frickin' prepared. Is that so much to ask? doG almighty! Yeah it sounds selfish, but what of it? I want to lead a regular life, just like and maybe even less than anyone else. There are so many things about me that work to prevent that... Gah! and when people complain to me about my conduct, all they're really doing is feeling sorry for themselves, and it makes me SICK! _I don't normally get angry with anyone, and usually the anger will pass rather quickly. But I can't stand always being angry like this. It shouldn't happen on a weekly basis. Up and Down like I'm on frickin' drugs or estrogen. NO! I really don't need that; it's unnecessary. I shouldn't  have  to explain myself, everytime a person takes what I say out of context. Hell, I say nebulous things all the time. Frankly, I don't give a sh*t anymore. People can kiss my @$$. Every time I try to make an effort to ameliorate something, they just spit it in my face and childishly give me the cold shoulder. I don't mind talking things over, because it gets sh*t done. _So what if I'm self-conscious and worried about my grades? If you think it's wrong of me, then maybe you don't place enough emphasis on them. Yeah, that was bitter! no apologies! You think it's sOOooO easy to be me. You think ALL I do is just sit around and slack off. uh-huh, yeah, sure, you believe what you want. I  do  get things done once in a while, and I make an earnest effort. I may not put out that much, but it's the best I can give. With each year, the tiredness just accumulates. The stress, the anxiety, the frustration. I hate to sound like a stereotypical, angst-filled teen, but people DON'T understand me. And don't think that you do, because you can hardly begin to comprehend. I know myself. Yeah, I'm pretty f***ed up....

       _Today was one of the more uneventful days of summer. I basically sat in front of the computer all day and let the microwaves burn my retinae. I find it incredible just how long I can remain stationary for hours on end. Usually, I have attention deficit disorder-like symptoms, and other times I'm perfectly patient. Funny how it works out that way. Are you wondering about the title? Well, normally, people say, "bless you" when someone sneezes; so, being the good agnostic that I am, decided to go the extra mile and say it in German (because, you know, that makes  so  much sense). What am I doing now, you ask? Nothing, same as all day. I merely figured that since I did not take the time to make an entry yesterday, I ought to make up for it now. _My blog is pretty plain, wouldn't you say? I was thinking of redesigning the template, but I'm far too lazy. Onto another subject: I have a friend, A.J., who is working scientifically to eliminate all contractions from his speech (e.g., "don't," "I'm," etc.). I was thinking of doing the same earlier on, not to seem pompous and stilted, but simply for the sake of being more articulate. However, as I have worked on this ongoing project of mine (a literary work, hardly worth a second-glance), the people have no contractions, and I have stumbled upon situations where the phrasing, no matter the syntax, sounds so awkward that it almost  requires  the contraction to even read correctly. Speaking of that ongoing project. I haven't told you about it, huh? Well, it's sort of this thing I do. I don't know why, the story feeds itself into my mind. I've developed this complex world with intricately-woven stories that I thought I might try to write down, in case I forget it. When I grew older, I became interested in Manga and Anime; so I thought, "Hey! why not try to turn it into a webcomic! :D" How foolish... And yet, I still pursue that whim. In any case, most of the time spent in front of the computer today was for the specific reason of writing. Nothing truly flowed out, but I am now deep into the third chapter, page 98 (1 pg. = a half, landscape 8x10 page). I figure if I write about 15 chapters with 36 pages per chapter, I'll be at 540 pages by the end of ONE of the three major stories. _Now that that's settled, about today? Well, earlier this morning, I woke up around 6:30 AM, turned of the clock/radio, and woke up again at about 8AM. So, I put on my everything, and get ready. My paternal parental unit asked me earlier if our track coach made us sprinters run with weights like dumbells, and although we didn't, I took it into consideration for my summer training. Seeing as I really,  really  want my 400m time to go down, I thought I ought to test the idea. I took my mom's pregnant-lady-but-used-for-physical-therapy dumbells (5 lb. each) and headed out. [One thing that really bugs me: the key doesn't slip into the lock the same as it used to before, and it makes a lot of noise]. I didn't bring my CD player this time because it was jigglin' all over the place the time before. So, I walk down my hill, and start running. OUCH! Even though they were just five pounds each, it slowed me down considerably, made it difficult to breath. I dunno, maybe I'm just a wuss, but it was definitely strenuous. That was the approximate makeup of my day. Not so interesting, ne? So goes the story of my life. Perhaps something amazing, someday, will happen to me like the people in my story.

       Okay. I woke up today, fairly late. No time to run, but I managed to eat a decent breakfast. When I get out of the shower, my sister prompts me, telling me that we are going to go somewhere and that I am going to be the driver. (You must understand, I am a relative "late bloomer" when it comes to driving). So this will be the second time for me on the freeway. I assume we are going to take HWY 78 to San Marcos and the Fry's there, but my problem lies in the word "assume." Once we are in the car (Nissan, Sentra, standard), he gives me directions to his favorite gas station on Felicita. This catches my attention (ô_o):  why go out of the way?  I think to myself, only to realize we are heading down the 15 towards the downtown San Diego Fry's. Ahhh!! Thankfully, didn't run into many problems (just a side note: we left at about 11:30 AM). So we drive back to a parking lot in Escondido eventually, and set up some cones so's I can learn me how 'ta parallel parks. After several hours of stepping on the shift, stepping on the gas, stepping on the brakes, shifting gears, we head home. It's 4:30 PM (Xb). I don't know what else to do now; so I think I'll either stay on the computer for a while, then exercise and/or eat, then stay up until I crash on my bed. hahaha. okay. I'm done.

       -Okay, so I had a blog elsewhere before, but then I was trying to limit it to this crazy project I was hoping to at least work on during the last year or two. Anyways, I guess this will be my new home *snuggles in as only a whale can*. I just love how the safety valve theory applies to the internet in such a way. Not much happens in my life, and I doubt I will retain the conviction to make entries regularly, especially when the school year starts.  For now, this will simply have to do. Where to start? Well, first off, my summer plans are as follows:......---and that's all. However, I wanted to get my driver's license, do some drawing, work on my summer assignments, volunteer service, improve my 400 meter time, and apply for a summer job. Nice summer, huh? Well, that's the way the penguin plummets. -So yeah, my grades are down the toilet, not that I can help it much now anyways. I got my SAT I scores back a while ago, I tested average. Tim got a 1520 *green-eyed monster* haha... no, I'm happy for him. Didn't get accepted as an NHS officer, but that's to be expected. Even though I say I think it was because it's rigged, and they're all Nazis, I truly believe that I didn't have a sexy-enough résumé or teacher recommendations ('cuz we all know what those would say don't we? ô_o). I'm still directonless in life. Don't know what I want to be, don't know which college I want to go to, don't know anything  about  college. For the past, what?, eight or nine years, about which all my life has revolved is school. and what for? I couldn't tell you. I guess the best thing I thought I could do was appear as good as possible so that when the time came to decide, I wouldn't be a mess. -You know, before, I never considered Track & Field my "thing." Never whole-heartedly dedicated myself to it, but it's given me so much that I thought I ought to see what else it could do for me. This coming school year will be interesting to say the least. The anticipatory anxiety is enough to make me go insane, not to mention that AP exam results are coming in July. Seriously, I don't know why we put ourselves through so much stress. I quit tae kwon do and jazz a while ago. I never appreciated them so much as I do now. Colleges will look at my application and see my junior year: I quit a good deal of extracurriculur activities and STILL didn't make good grades. It's enough to make a cetacean grow tear ducts and cry. That's all for now, not that you were ever interested before in any case. ~SPAMU

       _This would be today's entry, only the last entry missed being yesterday's by about ten minutes. So what happened this time around? It was weird (like most all dreams). I was a little bit younger than I am now, maybe early teens. Our class (I'm guessing, though I didn't know anyone) was on some field trip through a building, perhaps, a museum. Its architecture was new-age industrial, but that doesn't matter. Anyways, for some reason, I was an assassin, but my weapon of choice? hefty coins that I chucked at people's heads (¦P). Apparently, my targets were just about anyone; it was completely random. No one else seemed to notice that I was taking out people from behind with those big old coins. So we get near some kind of unisex bathroom (since EVERYONE was going through it and it was part of the tour >_ _ _ _Here it is:  Lately, I've been remembering several of my dreams... I just thought I'd share the most recent and memorable one.... So, my family, my cousin's family, and I are at this hotel, vacationing, and we decide to go down and do some sight-seeing. We end up in this interactive museum/aquarium (figures, I'd dream us to a nerdy place). Anyways, there are these exhibits which are actually pretty cool, cuz' you see through these windows, and there are entire expansive environments contained within them. One of them was this beach set up, and inside, this lil' ferret-looking thing pops out of a the water in the distance. For sum reason, ppl show up inside and start playing with it. Then, the ferret thing transforms O_o, into a sandwich and a bunhc of other things. It crawls close to the window, and my sister says, "that's not a bear" for some reason, and then it turns into a cartoony bear XP. The bear turns into a slot machine kinda thing and starts spewing out these lil' prizes (don't ask). I get most of the prizes, which makes no sense. Then my cousin's lil' sister complains about not having received any. We leave the exhibit, but she stays behind and gets rejcted by the bear >.  _I don't know why a lot of my dreams take place in buildings like that. The architecture was really neat though. Although, some room transitions are physically impossible (>_

       _It has actually been a while since this has plagued my mind, and I've forgotten what it was that triggered it in my memory. Anyways, I was thinking about leadership positions because I'm still kinda bent out of shape by not getting a position, not even the lowest for which I applied (>_ that ." I've been so focused on taking everything one step at a time that I forget to look ahead. Some people would say that I don't really need it, that I would get accepted based on my current résumé alone. Maybe it's true, but I believe I am one of those caught in that crowd. There are of course the valedictorians, the athletes, some combination of the two, lower-rung students, and then my group. My group is comprised of a wide range of people with varying checks and balances that make them all look like a swarm of bees. All the same. So, then, it becomes a rat race for whomever looks sexiest to the colleges based on other contributing factors. SAT scores, extracurriculur activities, community service, and leadership.  _1) SAT scores: Okay, this is pretty much hit and miss. There are no two ways about it. Colleges accept standardized tests because they feel that it is a "good measure of how a student MIGHT [not 'will,'  might ] perform in college," based on mathematical, language, and not to mention, standardized test-taking skills *gasp*! even if you want to be a Bio major?! YES! _2) Extracurriculur activities: Everybody does  something  afterschool or outside of it. Just lather, rinse, repeat, and you've got a certified extracurriculur activity. _3) Community Service: this is a big one too. (Doesn't it seem like we're trying out for a beauty pageant? yeah, well, at least in this edition, they don't rate you on looks >_ could , I suppose, work somewhere more consistently, like say, the senior center, or the hospital, but I enjoy the flexibility of the community service provider for teens here "Education Compact." _3.5) Did I forget to mention? They take into account any overcoming of adversities in life too. Adversity? that's kind of happenstance, don't you think? not everyone is blessed/cursed with natural obstacles, at least, not the ones that people care to read about. _4) Here's the end all: Leadership. What it says to a college: I've got big cajones and will make you proud, because when I grow up and am all successful 'n' $#!%, you can say, "Hey, that guy went to our school!" Captains of teams, club officers, community leaders, speech contest winners, and all that goodness. That is where the action is at. Of course, you do have to have decent grades. I mean, you can't expect to get in on leadership alone, unless you're one of those people who can get in with teh sehksi monies or ur dean's the uncle. The great thing about leadership? NOT EVERYONE CAN BE A LEADER! there have to be followers for there to be leaders, right? and the leaders cannot outnumber the followers. Now here's the dilemma: who the hell chooses the leaders? I guess you could make your own leadership position and just say you're the leader of shitland. (notice I've stopped censoring myself, as I am now getting more intense and involved). But just what does it take to be a leader of anything? A lot of people can handle stress. I guess I wouldn't know because I've never held one before. Usually, I've lost the ones where the public votes (not exactly Mr. Popular of the year, if you know what I mean), but I tried nonetheless. I wonder if that would work on a college application, leadership? "Well.... I ran for yadda-yadda, blah blah, etc., etc., didn't win any of 'em." I also wonder, can you stage a coup de tat if you don't like the people who get elected? What would happen to the organization then? Would the burgeoisie rise up against the upper middle class partisans and start guillotining royalty? Could there be a club civil war? Could another club steal the business from another club and start a takeover, breaching into other chapters? I imagine my ideal club would be autonomous and definitely liberal. "Community Honorable-mention Organization"? I'd find it hilarious if CSF suddenly pulled a blitzkrieg on NHS and later got into a nuclear-cookie arms race against MeCHA. heh heh, Mecha.... like those giant robots. I really hope that it is not too late for Jay and I to start a club. Our last resort would be a Manga club, but there's gotta be more we could do. In any case, what I'm trying to get at is: BE MORE CONSIDERATE WHEN CHOOSING LEADERS, losers have feelings too. There is absolutely NO need to be playing monopoly with leadership positions. I just don't get it. That kind of thinking encourages unhealthy competition and  will  necessarily result in someone's lowering of self-esteem. We get it, you're an official, let's roll out the metaphorical red carpet, now give us a chance. Oh wait, I forgot about nepotism and oligarchy. Ohhh that just really burns me up. No matter, life goes on as it always does, with or without you.  _We can only hope for the best and look ahead past all the bullshit you have to deal with in your adolescence only to see the same process repeated through adulthood. It would seem right now, that the best choice to be successful, would be a musician. You could be in, then out, and rich. Gosh, if I could make just enough capital so that work wouldn't be heading down to the fund of general living costs, I would start getting more serious in manga as a hobby and maybe eventually, a career. I love the imagination the escapism it provides in a world where all you can do is escape (unless, that is, you're a leader, in which case, you can influence change). Just the stimulation of it. Not to mention, if you're good at it, the effect storytelling has on an audience. Until now, I had never really thought of why I liked watching anime or reading comics or books. Wow! isn't amazing on what a tangent I can go off? I didn't even finish my angry rant about colleges and then I get all optimistic suddenly! that isn't me! that's a lie! hahaha. _So, colleges. First of all, they're the first big step. the Gateway drugs. You'd probably end up overeducated anyways. Those in business, politics, cutthroat as they are, the arts (all forms), and technology are the ones making serious money. And while money may not buy happiness, it can buy time (since we know that "time is money"), and time can be spared for the search of happiness. Colleges are the first time that the sheep (for those not attending rich-ass private schools or just rich schools cuz' they live in rich areas) are segregated by grade A, AA, AAA, or 'suck'. Ohhh Ohhh, I'm writing too much, aren't I? Oh well, screw it. .hack// doesn't come on until 1:30 or something. And depending on what college you go to, the esteem of the college will determine what job positions on a hierarchy of limited social mobility you are qualified for. (If you don't mind prepositions at the end of sentences.) College (if and when I go *fingers crossed*, parents are making sure of that, whether it be Palomar Community college or Ivy league >_ amazing  in my life? Who knows? _One more thing before I go. I cannot type at all lately! I've been making so many errors like, switching "there"s with "their"s, or just plain missing keys. I don't know what exactly it is, but over summer I get extra stupid. My backspace/delete/back arrow keys are all being worn out. I've taken special strides so as not to mess up too poorly on this post, but oh well. I've been thinking of teaching myself how to speed type. It hasn't been going too well as of late. I'd also like to get into better shape, if not for other people and social pressures, at least for myself. I want to retain.... *be* healthy as an adult (>_

       _Hooray! New character design! I finally finished the sketch I started yesterday (took long enough for a sketch >_ _My teeth hurt (T_T). I've needed my wisdom teeth pulled for ages now, but my parents ignore my all but subtle hints (T_T). I can feel them crowding around and sometimes try to manually push them back (XD). I'm such a loser. If I drink enough cold water, it numbs the pain (:D), not exactly the best remedy, but it soothes, OH HOW IT SOOTHES! *deep exhalation* So I guess not much is going on in my life right now. Now that I can't think of anything really to write about. I suppose I'll skip days like these when nothing of note pops up in my mind or elsewhere. I hate running down my writing average for this, but this is, again, for myself, fundamentally. I find writing thoughts out to be therapeutic, and since I can't even decipher poetry, let alone write it, simple prose will just have to do. I've stopped writing the story, by the way. Nothing permanent, just hiatus, I can't write and draw at the same time: it hurts my head. Okay, well I ought to shower and workout as I'm long overdue for the latter. G'night.

       _Rude awakening to find out we were going to the beach. The weather along the coast was overcast when we got there, and it was cold and windy. We decided to stick it out until we thought it wouldn't clear up. It didn't. But I  did  start a new sketch. Slowly, I've been picking away at drawing these characters for a story I'm writing (I hesitate to say "book" or "novel," because that would mean I knew what I was doing), and slowly but surely, I've had about six done by now. This one will be the seventh out of an approximate twenty or so characters (main and secondary), not including costume changes. This specific character "Kyron" is the first whole male I'll have drawn seriously. I am so terrible with the male figure. You thought my females were bad... oh man. lol. Anyways, I'm working on him and am currently stuck on what I should have him wear. He was originally slated to be wearing a suit, but that entire character design went to another character. Then I had him as a doctor; so I tried to think of a doctor's uniform. That didn't work. I got so desperate, I started looking to my REALLY old character designs. I managed to resist, but one was really tempting me. Now I'm thinking of placing him in some street clothes, maybe shorts, shoes, t-shirt deal? Who knows. I finally got his face down though. That had been a major barrier before. Wow, it's already 8:30PM >_ _So after the beach, we went to Applebee's. Omg, I luv their food. lol. (apologies for the consistent use of the internet-isms). Then, we went to Toys R Us, because my dad is crazy. I got to catch up with the video game world for once in the life. The last game I played was Suikoden III, last X-mas or summer?. Too bad about that, I truly think video games drive my imagination. We came home, and washed the cars. It's always been a weird family tradition. I guess we used to wash our own cars a lot when we were poorer, and the habit just stuck. *shrugs* _I've missed the past few days of exercise. Not good. I'm going to start up again tonight and tomorrow. I think I actually tanned a lil at the beach :D. Now, I have to try and think of something interesting from my day to focus on like the blogs before.... *rocks back and forth* _I give up. I guess this entry will be a lot shorter than its predecessors, huh? Now for the title... Not a really interesting day. [Edit: Okay, I guess since the day wasn't over yet I couldn't rule out the chance for inspiration. Anyways, I went to heat up some leftovers for dinner and checked to see if the rice was still good... It was not. OMG! I hate the rank and rancid smell of spoiled rice Yyyyuck! It's like Howard Carter and Lord Carnarvon opening up Pharoah Tutankhamen's tomb (>,

       _Oohhh my goodness. Here we go again, with the drama. You know, I really do hate feeling negative emotions, but when you subject yourself to them... My friend insists on feeling miserable and seeing the bad side of everything, and whenever she feels badly and I try to listen, she rubs it off on me. I'm  sorry  if I can't always be there for you, but we're just friends. Her definition of a friend extends up and beyond. She wants a  boyfriend  or some kind of higher-level commitment because that's what she's lacking right now. She misses her old boyfriend, and so there's this vaccuum there that she feels her friends need to fill. We just can't fill that position! The best we can do for her is to help her grow out of him and move on, but she doesn't want to move on. And people wonder why I don't like serious relationships. She told me that I was lecturing her, and I  was . I watch her torture herself, and her ex-boyfriend has probably never been driven to such extremes. It's really sad for me to see her bent out of shape over him, and I don't know what to do. I'm no expert on that subject. I recall many people earlier on in life asking me what to do about their friendships, and I could give them a little advice or help. However, I have VERY little experience in romance. My goodness how it boggles the mind. The best I can see it, is a chain reaction of brain-chemical stimulations. But what aroused this entry today (I was originally going to talk about fortune cookies) was the fact that she wanted to go out. _You know, I like spending time with her, but I have to get ready before I go out. I got   out of bed at like 3:30 PM, and suddenly she wants to go out. Normally, if my parents are conscious, I'll just ask them, and maybe they'll take me, maybe not. She just cannot accept an answer of "no." So she insists that I go with her, and gets one of her parents to drive me, which I am hesitant to accept for my own personal reasons (think Cunninghams vs. Ewells + appearance-obsessed parental units = me rocking back and forth in corner). However, there arise complications brought on by the extremity of the spontaneity. Of course, the night before I told her to be more capricious. Whenever I try to help her, it seems, my advice always backfires, even like studying for tests, and it makes me feel bad and not want to help her, ESPECIALLY when she gets angry with me and I can't do anything except to hope for forgiveness. I wish she would just accept my amphetamine-like properties ("uppers") as they are and nothing else. Sometimes, when she gets this agitated by such a small matter, it makes me angry, knowing that there are so many wrong things going on in the world. It's not as if either I or she can do anything about it, but there is more sour milk to be fretting about. (For those of you who read my "reserving my right to be angry," this is different somehow). I don't know why I'm trying to persuade you. You don't even know me. I guess I'm trying to defend myself. Oh well, I give up. _I had always imagined summer as a time to relax, because school was over and so there should be nothing to get in the way. And for the past few summers that has held true, but this summer, oh boy, I can't seem to go a week without something bothering me internally. wha-? sorry I got distracted by this article. I guess I'll talk about fortune cookies now... _So I was cleaning my room, and stumbled upon my old jar of fortune cookie fortunes. -_-.... I have the worst luck with those things. Honest-to-goodness, one of them said, "Listen to a good song everyday." WHAT KIND OF FORTUNE IS THAT? I'll tell you:  it isn't ! It's an advisory statement! I guess that's the backup plan for fortunes when nothing happens in your life. They just tell you what you should do so that maybe you'll actually get a fortune (XP). Now, whenever I go to a Chinese restaurant, I dread the advent of the bill. Those smug little cookies, smiling at me with their crescent shape, taunting me to open it up. I don't even really like them, they're so bland. hey! I am  not  going to let my life be ruled by a cookie, I'll tell you that much! What ever gave little baked morsels the right to command their makers about? Even when I do get the occasional fortune fortune, it'll just be mocking me by dangling words about "romance" or "marriage." Yes, I truly believe there is this old prognosticator with a cutthroat sense of humor writing these for me. Or you know, they could also be randomly generated by computers. But what are the odds? That  every  time I get one of those cookies they order me around? I thought about writing a comic pertaining to them, just to spite it, but... just like "Suburbania," I never got around to it, or it just, slipped through my fingers. *Goes up and edits title*... What else? oh, that's all? okay, well, before I go, I think I should start making my own fortune cookies, except they would be more specific and bitingly sarcastic. Like "Your significant other is cheating on you with the secretary one floor below, because you're right, 'it  is  you...' Oh! and also you will also find ten pennies on the ground face-up this week! :-)"

       _I swear I have the worst short term memory. I just went downstairs for something, and I got distracted for if only a minute. Then when I tried to remember why it was I left the computer, I couldn't, for the life of me, recall why it was. (on a side note, I just now remembered why). Earlier, we were having a conversation, my family, and when we paused, I couldn't remember what I wanted to say just a minute or so earlier. I can foresee this as a major problem in my adult life. Also, I'm afraid of spiders. Not deathly so, just don't like 'em. They've bitten me in my sleep, and that I don't mind so much, but if they ever tried that shit while I was awake, I would be all up on that bitch! lol *sad attempt at ebonics*. Anyways, I was going to write about my drawing skill envy problem then cleverly segueway (or, you know, just rant until I ended up on the subject) into how I miss the extinct snacks I used to eat/drink as a child like Squeezits or Gobble Stix, but now I'm tired, so this is officially my shortest blog entry. Funny though. For a lot of people, this is as long as it gets (XP).

       _In case I can't think of anything to write later.... I expect this dream came about because I had just watched Vandread and seen a magazine with pictures of space in it, but here goes. The furthest back I can remember, (don't laugh, now, but) there were two girls who looked remarkably like Sailor Neptune and Sailor Uranus (>_ they  knew what they were talking about). Then, for no apparent reason, the crimson thingies and the other martians took on human forms it was really weird, and they had families walking around and stuff and weren't all nasty and scary. Then, I think my alarm went off, so I woke up half-way and the dream got interrupted. _Then it's like a flashforward, or maybe just a complete shift in setting. So we're (I am now included in my dream) in some western setting around sunset/sunrise? There's a girl and some man (the antagonist) with me.  There's a sole tree in the middle of a field, and to the side is a wheat field. We mess around with some really poisonous spiders cuz' we're fighting the bad guy. Another blank spot. Then he grabs a spider, and I steal his gun. he chases me around with the spider, and the girl, I guess, is just sitting there by the tree. The spider shoots off his hand and starts biting at me, which was really weird. Naturally (sarcastic), I dove into the wheat fields to hide myself, but I had the gun (it was a big clunking pistol too). SO there was like a chase or something. Then villagers from a nearby (>_>)... village, approach, and start attacking anyone. I shot a couple of them (just injured), and just when they discovered me, the ground started rumbling. Apparently, there was a tidal wave coming from the side, and so we all had to work together to knock down the bridges in order to dam up the valley. Then I woke up. I wish I'd remembered more from my dream, cuz' that didn't make any sense I suppose from the outside. Lately, I've been trying different sleeping methods so that I could remember my dreams. Sounds weird, but before, during the schoolyear when I got hardly any sleep or was just too tired for words, I was unable to remember ANY of my dreams. My friend could recall all of her weird dreams, and I was jealous so I've been doing my best to remember them (XD). That's all.

       _Okay, so I haven't been updating this thing religiously. Actually, I had a couple of things in the back of my mind that I wanted to write about, but there were more pressing matters at hand during the time (i.e., anime, drawing, reading XP). So yeah, I guess I could just play catch up with this entry until I figure out exactly what I want to focus on... or, maybe not. So, what's happened since last I wrote? Eh. well, looking over the last entry didn't help much. OH! July 3rd! So the next day was the Fourth of July (shh. don't say anything). Now I remember. Well, let's start with the personal stuffs: Today, not much happened. Got bored, watched White Chicks the uber pirated version (>_ _Okay, now the fun stuff: Well, as I mentioned, I watched a movie on the fourth. It was kind of sad, I noticed, not the movie, but the moviegoers. There weren't too many people in the theater (seeing as it was the Fourth of July), and there was plenty of space. Everyone decided to spread themselves out as far as they could. No one is willing to sit next to a stranger if they can help it. I realize some people just like to be left alone, and if the theater was empty except for a couple, you wouldn't just sit next to them. However, people were willing to force themselves to the front rows and nosebleed seats just to avoid the proximity of others. We don't bite, honest! Well, not most of us anyways. Utter xenophobia. Somehow, I sense there is not much brotherhood among the public, even on the fourth of July. It is certainly a person's right to reserve his or her own privacy, but there comes a point when it stops being a necessity of personal bubble so much as just a detachment and distrust for human beings. Personally, I feel comfortable around most everyone (except, maybe, my family. heh), and I don't exercise prejudice, at least I don't think I do. And even if I think it (no one is without their prejudgments: it is what enables us to interact successfully), I don't practice it or dwell on it. I wonder just how much more we could accomplish if everyone stuck together, heard out everyone's opinion, and never jumped to conclusion. If we could just wipe out ignorance. Buuut, I recognize the fact that people may also reserve their right to remain ignorant. Everyone is a little ignorant in their own ways, but the hope is to ameliorate that, to achieve better understanding. One should choose not to stand stagnant mentally, because there is so much we could learn from each other. I think an obstacle on this path is the people's refusal to learn from and let go of the past. People use history as an excuse or a way to complain instead of analyzing it and progressing. People don't realize that those who are born now are not the same people as their fathers. They may genetically half the man their father was and half the woman their mother was, but what was done in the past was done in the past and not by the newer generation's hands. Also, when a mistake is made, I hope the parents recognize it and teach their offspring what not to do (again, analyzing the past). If we could break down social barriers, that don't even exist in the minds of children who have the simplest, fundamental form of logic, we would all be better off and could focus on more imperative matters at hand. _The other thing I wanted to talk about is the beach. Is it just me, or does everyone around you seem sexier than yourself. Of course, there are those who are confident in their prowess and physique. I, however, am not one of them. Like, even kids younger than me seem to have twice my muscle mass. It's disturbing and a severe blow to my ego or self-esteem or w/e. It seems as if no amount of push-ups and sit ups and whatever the hell else I might do would help my situation. About three times this summer I've gone to the beach. At no point, during all three visits, did I remove my tank top shirt. Granted, two of the days it was cold, but still... and then, there will be the people who jog by, and be all like, "look at how sexy we are and you aren't hahahhaa." What? no one else feels that way? Well, whoever said "no," you're the people laughing and flaunting "it." *sigh* I suppose there must be those who look at "it" and admire "it" from a distance, otherwise, no one would appreciate those who flaunt it. At least with this case, people  do  have the ability to change this, or so I think. Somehow, I have this feeling that genetics is against me. Like, even if I did eventually gain more muscle mass (and people, we're talking very little bare minimum, just enough to carry all the shit I need for school), somehow, my thirties would just murder my metabolism. "Yeah? Yeah? you like eating? EAT THIS! *kapow*" no more speedy digestion, no more I-can-eat-what-I-want mentality. I hope I NEVER, EVER,  never ever ever never never ever  end up a diet freak or a victim of a fad diet. I don't think I could ever see myself cutting out an entire food group or more, or having to "watch" what I eat. I mean, food is pretty interesting, but not interesting enough to watch at every sitting. I prefer to just consume the stuff. Stipulations: a) it's gotta taste good; b) it's gotta have some kind of health benefits; c) it's gotta have a nice texture (no soggy, mushy, craptastic-feeling-in-your-mouth B.S.). Simple enough, ne? There's always dangers with eating whatever one wants whenever one wants [Shakira reference (I can't believe I actually liked her at one point O.O)], but that's just a risk I am willing to take. I've been trained enough mentally by my family (although sometimes it doesn't seem like it), teachers, and mind-manipulating media to know what's good for me and what's not. And I'm certainly not going to live all paranoid of what doesn't have nutrition facts on the side label. Hm. Exercise seems the best and only way to go. Except the problem with exercise, is that it requires times, and it has that nasty side-effect of tiring you out (if you do a good enough job of it). If it weren't for those two factors, I imagine I would be in a lot better shape, but society demands more from an individual than performing well internally and externally, depending on what career one assumes. For myself in particular, there is no hope for the star-studded jobs of hollywood, music, etc. and besides that, I don't think I'd really be-good-at-it/like-it, you know? cuz' not everyone's cut out for anything. _Okay, well, that's it for tonight. Spamtastic spamu, signing out.

       _Hooray! I have two readers (inconsistently): Tisha and Diana! W00t! hahaha... Yeah, I think if too many people read this stuff, which I doubt they do (I keep all the good stuff in the middle, anyways ~_^ ), it might just cause the universe to implode. And we wouldn't want that, now, would we? or  would  we (ô_o)? It's been quiet around here lately. Just birds chirping and me eating. Yes, oh how I do love to eat. Summer reading has been coming along nicely, that is to say, not at all. Do you think I'm antisocial for not wanting to go out much? Maybe a recluse, but not antisocial. Wait. That doesn't make any sense (XD). Anyways, I do love talking to people, but when I'm feeling tired, I don't like to go out. Some times I expend so much energy during the day, the time meant for fun usually gets deposited into the bank of relaxation. I don't think I could go an entire day without talking, even just in my head. I need interaction, though. I feed off of that energy. It's what keeps me going. Otherwise, I don't know... what it is about socializing that I like so much. Perhaps because I can't stand not talking even just idle chit-chat or small talk. Or maybe I just need to get things off my mind sometimes. I know it likes to overflow, as you may have seen, and so letting out the dam a little bit every now and then maintains my sanity.  _It's a beautiful day, today. Too bad it's so damned hot. Is it wrong to wear sweaters on hot days? I have to keep explaining to people that it's not the hot air that bothers me, it's the sun's burning light that I don't like (vampire. lol). I don't care too much for any heat in the first place, but at least with just hot air, I can drink water or something. When the sun's beaming down on you, there's not much you can do except sunscreen or sunblock and shade. Shade isn't exactly available all the time; so, I guess the best thing to do would be to wear something to cover, not necessarily thick, but covering. The people in the desert do it (>_ _Super powers. I guess I thought of them 'cuz Comic-Con is happening soon, but anyways.... If I were to ever have superhuman powers, it would have to be telekinesis. Telekinesis ROCKS MY SOCKS! You know, like Jean Grey from X-Men? Moving things with your mind? The only reason why, is because I'm lazy and would rather have things come to me (XP). But yeah, I wouldn't try out that whole Spider-Man bit, where I have to save everyone's asses, and I wouldn't be an evil villain either. What would I do with them, I wonder? Probably just use them for my convenience. Hell, it would save a lot of money for traveling, and I could fly. Oh that would be so cool. And there would be no limit to "strength." You know, how like, Superman, sure he's strong, but there is a stopping point. Mental abilities, however, are abstract and far-reaching. Booyah! I might like telepathy, but if it wasn't included in the package, I wouldn't care much. Like, you could accidentally, connect with someone when they're on the toilet, doing the dirty deed, or hear something you might not like or misconstrue. And with telekinesis, I could get more things done at once. I could type up an essay, eat, draw, and wash the dishes all at once. I would also hope that other people could be telekinetic too, so I wouldn't be all sticking-out and people wouldn't get mad at me for not stopping a plummeting airplane because I wanted to watch "I Love the 2000's Strikes Back." Ahh, that would be so nice. But stopping to consider if ever super powers came into existence, I wonder: what would come first? the hero? or the villain? I imagine villainy would be a popular initial choice since other people would have a hard time stopping you, and being a super hero would come with so many complications. I'm sure no one imagines themselves as evil, but I know there are people who would definitely take advantage of any kind of power above another to get what they wanted. At some point, super heroes probably wouldn't even be needed were there no super villains. I mean, there are accidents and disasters, but a person, even a super hero, would have limitations. Having those kinds of superhuman abilities would attract too much attention as a hero or villain, which is why I would try to obscure mine as much as possible. *And yes, I realize that I am a total nerd for talking about this, but hey, I think about it, and this is  my  blog; so I'll do whatever I damn-well want, damnit! (>_ _Wishes. Of course, I would wish for telekinesis. The point of this paragraph has to do with that hypothetical situation where someone is offered a wish and they goof it up by saying it too vaguely. I thought I'd compose exactly what and how I would verbalize mine. *clears throat*:  Before the wish is granted, all of these words should be taken into consideration for the wish. Under no circumstances is my wish itself and not including its resulting products (as the products should have influence once manifested) to affect the universe in any way, except for the wish's subject in question, which is myself. However, this does not include any external or internal alterations that might change my being. The latter means that my body and mind should not require change in order to assume the wish's product. With that said, "I wish for unlimited telekinesis." I should be able to control all aspects of said wish at all times and possess knowledge and skill over how to use the abilities gained. The term "unlimited" in the wish itself should be defined as the impossibility of another force to resist it and for the powers to remain within me as long as I so shall live. And that's it. Why are you looking at me like that? That's just how I would go about making a wish. yeah. sure. I'm crazy, fine, whatever (¬_¬).  _Yeah, I realize this is a long entry, but I don't wanna forget anything. Anyways, one more thing before I go. About this blog itself. Do I necessarily retain any responsibility to it? I mean, yes, I committed myself to it, but no one really reads it. I guess the purpose for it, is so I can look back on how stupid I was. I do that a lot. I don't tend to forget my bad mistakes or instances of embarrassment so easily, and they'll come back and haunt me at random. Then I'll proceed to slap myself for ever doing whatever I did. But yeah, I get progressively dumber as time goes backwards. This thing though. What is it for? I don't really share it with anyone, and no one goes through blog archives to read EVERYTHING. Not much I have to say is really of any importance anyways. Hm... I guess, once the school year starts. I'll just use this for whenever I feel like it or just small day-to-day entries. Boy that was long. okay, buh-bye.

       _Damn, transitioning from complete nocturnalism to regular diurnal sleeping hours is a bitch! I feel like shit and probably look like it too (>_ ha ! I am winning." Then July annihilated it (XP). Today, I took my final behind-the-wheel. I guess I've been relatively lucky. I got a two really nice people and a lady who at least had common sense and good advice. I don't know if I've practiced enough, but I definitely don't want to become a DWO (driving wild oriental). I'm prolly going to be a middle driver. Like, not an excellent driver, but not a terrible one. My problem, though: I get so nervous behind the wheel with other people. As if their judgment will crush me. All the DMV person has to do to fail me is to make a big deal out of something like a missed point. My morale is so fragile. I don't take criticism too well, even constructive criticism, when it's in that tone. That tone of OMG- TERRIBLE ! I break down. I can tolerate a lot of things, believe me, I can be a very patient person with others, but that, I cannot handle. It just gets to me when I know I did something wrong and someone else opints it out. My kryptonite. _One thing I can talk about. My body. what a disappointment. It keeps failing me, and making me angry. It's so awkward and stupid. It's falling out of shape (more my fault, but still!). I know I abuse my body's limits, but it can at least try to keep up, right? Muscles. Problem? I don't have any (>_ _AP scores have been coming in. Apparently, this last year's AP calculus class all passed with 5s and a few 4s, with one not heard from yet, that's so incredible! Personally, i got a 4 in AP U.S. history and a 5 in Biology. I was so happy about biology. To some extent I guess I have to give credit to Mr. Cornelius. Even though I felt totally unprepared for the test, it turned out okay. I guess whenever I rush through things like that, it just doesn't occur to me, or maybe I'm just a lucky bastard (;D). Hell, I'll deal with luck, I'll take the bad if it gives me good on tests. Doesn't seem like the AP chem-ers did all that well. I was actually surprised by a few, but I didn't think it would be this bad (no harm meant towards the test takers, just that the class wasn't taught all that well, I guess, I dunno). This year has definitely been an eye-opener. So many things revealed themselves to me (hahaha, that didn't come out right) and I feel like I've grown so much mentally, perhaps, not on a social level, but you know what I mean. I just know that our future is tugging at us, and we simply cannot afford to ignore it. Some are more prepared than others. That's all for tonight, if I want to get some sleep.

       _Had another dream I remembered when I woke up. This time it was at school. I don't actually remember a lot of it, just that I eventually headed down to the track. At the track, like... the whole team was there doing stuff, but it wasn't a meet. The weird thing was, Jeff was there(O_o). I was running, but it was so slow. It seemed no matter how hard I pushed, I couldn't get any faster, at least, my normal speed, which isn't even that fast with which to begin (>_ _It was hot last night. I actually went to bed at a decent hour (oh, say... 1-ish), but it was so frickin' hot that I had to open my sliding glass door. Even then, it was still burning in those blankets. I didn't actually sleep straight until about 3 AM. I wasn't expecting it to be so hot, so I did a lil workout before bed and that made it even worse. Uguu~. If there was one inefficiency in humans that artificial replicants lack, it's the need for long periods of unconsciousness. I've said it a million times, and I'll say it again, "If sleep weren't so damned comfortable, I wouldn't do it." But sleep... it gets in the way of things, productivity, activity, learning, working, fun. I could do without it. If there were some scientific way of getting around sleep and still leading a healthy, normal life I'd take it. If humans could have evolved out of sleep, we would've ruled the world a long long time ago. We're talking, BAM! No resistance. And one is always so prone in his or her sleep. It's just inviting for some nasty parasite to attack like a spider or mosquitoes. Without sleep, people could have more time to relax and truly enjoy it, because... who consciously enjoys sleep while they're sleeping? no one, that's why they call it "unconscious." Sleep tricks you though. While your body is paralyzed, it creates a dream world for you, a Matrix of sorts. Sure, it can be entertaining at times, but most of the time, I don't even remember it. And the dream is conveniently accelerated, so that it seems as if hardly any time has passed. One has absolutely no control over sleep, at least, not total control, and that's what humans like, right? control. That's all we've ever taken strides for, control over the land, the seas, the sky, space, the elements. Of course, there are abstract things over which we have no control, like time, but sleep is a thing. Sleep is something that can be monitored in a controlled system, something that can be counted and varies, is multidirectional. If someone could develop a way around sleep, he/she would be a very successful man/woman. I suppose there would be downsides to eschewing sleep. There might be longer work hours, etc. but think of the progress we could make. And if the process were artificially imposed anyway, a person would have a choice. Eh, well, that's enough of that. _Man, I just can't believe it. In August, our senior year begins. college applications, testing, more testing, studying, sports, academic league, long goodbyes, responsibility. It's kind of a big step. I wonder just how much I'll change over the next year. Hopefully, I won't get any uglier or less attractive (XP). Hopefully, this year will be more fruitful and full of happy news, although I know Fate doesn't work that way. I'm guessing my school week will be as follows: -Monday: Been up all night studying, breakfast, class, class, talk, class, class, lunch @ NCAL or homework, class, class, something afterschool like tutorial, get home, study and hw, eat maybe, anime?(if there's time), maybe workout while I watch anime, hw, study, sleep(?) -Tuesday: barely awake, school early, quick breakfast, class, talk, class, lunch @ NCAL or with hw, again, class, afterschool tutorial, eventually sports, home, nap?, hw hw hw, eat, workout, hw, sleep(?) -Wednesday-Friday: lather, rinse, repeat. -Saturday: Usually something, like family get-together, if not volunteer work, hw hw hw hw hw, eat and sleep. college stuffs. -Sunday: volunteer if not on Saturday, hw hw hw hw hw hw. .... Sounds fun, ne? well, that'll just have to be how it is for a while. And if Jay and I start a club (if it's not too late to already XP), I'll be even busier, hooray! but to some extent, I do like being kept busy. Summer like this is so .... not what I would want it to be. you know? okay, time to go shopping at Target. bye!

       _I've decided: today, the laziness dies within me. No more screwing around. Perhaps, before, I've said something similar, and that fact kind of discourages me. But for some reason, I suddenly have this innate desire to be productive. Scary as it may seem. I guess, I don't mean seriously productive, nothing like work-a-mania, just, productivity. Laziness is so.... boring, and outdated. I sat around playing Monster Rancher Three from 1PM to 9PM today. I think I lost a pound or two in the process. To some extent it was interesting, but at some point, I felt my breathing become labored, just from sitting there. Anyways, somehow, I can't see myself doing nothing for so long. I know it will be difficult for me. If there is one thing that I am sure of about myself, it's that I'm one helluva good lazy ass. I want to get better. I want to look, feel, better than a pile of trash. I know currently, even my teachers agree, I look like hell walking in Monday morning after having procrastinated on some project or essay. It's not that I like it, just that's what I've grown accustomed to. Last semester though, after having pushed like the Dickens and a woman experiencing labor to pull my grades up, my body quit at the very end, kinda like my 400m. My body had never done that before, and it scared me. Even before then, I couldn't stay awake past 11PM maybe even earlier. No, I didn't like that. So how to start? First, get organized. Perhaps, follow in suit of Diana's footsteps (Maybe not to her degree of neatness, though o_O, that's more like obessession). When I think back on all that time, that youth, wasted... I guess I just don't have that innate, or perhaps environmental influence even, ability to focus. I've seen those with a keen control over their concentration, and it has served them well. I think I have the capacity for that kind of focus. I've seen myself demonstrate it before, albeit, in insignificant and irrelevant situations (i.e., video games, weddings, etc.). The writing of this blog entry... is not one of those times (XP). Usually, when I write these, the lengthy ones, I tend to get distracted and have to try and remember what it was I was writing about, and, as you may have noticed, I skip around from topic to topic quite often. Ack! Distracted again. I guess that's all for that topic; I've burned it out enough, plus, now I'm biding space until I can think of about what to write in the next paragraph. _Lately, I've been reading a ton of webcomics. Sometimes, when there's a slowdown in the comics I'm currently reading, I start feeling the itch, and I just google and web directory until I find ones I like. I guess, it's because of them, other writers and artists, that I want to be like them. Because I enjoy reading their stories and looking at their art. And when I have all these things stored in my head. Just... people, places, happenings, designs, stories. I feel like writing them down or expressing them any way I can. Not for anyone else (as many of my friends know XP), just for myself. _If you were wondering what the hell the misguided thoughts part has to do with anything in my title. I realized, it just is that I envisioned this pied piper in my head, leading my thoughts off a cliff like lemmings, and sometimes, they wind up in the gutter, or just so brutally mangled, that they're almost not worth sharing. Anyways, that's the story behind that. It wasn't any kind of poetic or artsy thing. When I read the title a while ago, I realized it might come off as something of that nature, but nope, I'm not that deep so as to claim any title of artsiness. _Hmph. This blog entry seems to be lacking in any "straight line." Just kinda goes off into tangents. I wonder what exactly in my mind sparks that, the random surfacing thoughts. The same drive that generates my dreams I suppose. But usually, everything is non-sequitur and irrelated (real word? I don't know, but you get it, right? so that must make it a world, irregardless of Webster. and yes, "irregardless"  is  a real word) oh.... unrelated hahaha wow it's late. _Recently, too, I've seen a ton of Anime. not enough that I would be happy, but more than I'm used to during the school year. *Yawn* I really do want to write more, and probably could. In fact, were it not so late and I not so hungry, I would probably go back and delete a paragraph or two and redo them (XP). It's too late for that now though (so much for adjusting to regular diurnal cercadian rhythms XP). _Oh how I love biology. Not just being able to use words and pretend to look smart (although that can be fun too ;D), I enjoy biology for the sake of knowing how things, life, in particular works. Life is always such a mystery. Baffling and beautiful. Just how everything works out kinda like a symphony of coincidence and right timing. Like sometimes, I wonder at the odds that I ever came into existence or that slim chance life could have ceased to exist. That earth just happened to possess the right conditions at the right time to hold life. I know for a fact, that there are aliens out there. Perhaps, even more like ourselves than we know. Maybe, conditions on the planet have caused different evolutionary outcomes, but I doubt there is much difference. In this universe I can imagine plenty of life forms out there, at all stages, perhaps, unable to communicate with foreign planets. But I can imagine us, looking through our telescopes, not seeing them looking right back at us unknowingly, like that Rocky and Bullwinkle stuff. Anyways, i'd better head out for the night. Signing out, SpAmU

       _Where have I been? For three and one half days, it seemed as if I'd just fallen off the face of the earth. So yeah, Final Fantasy X-2 came into my life. I had hoped video games wouldn't be a large part of this summer, but... anyways, when I game, I game straight up. I think my mass atrophied tenfold >_ some  of the designs. The story was more engrossing than I thought it'd be, but the style had a major shift: very cartoony and yet human in certain aspects (I know that doesn't quite make sense, but you have to see it for yourself). I only completed 55% of the overall game and managed to finish it (o_0). I went one day without sleeping altogether; that took a serious toll on my lucidity. It's weird, I think I lose brain mass, cuz' I feel all light-headed and my really-short-term memory gets shot to hell. E.g., I'd hear something or say something and doubt it was even said/heard a second later. I feel like I'm not really filling my entire body, just there, inside of it. This whole thing's been rather dangerous for my health, not to mention, when I did sleep, the hours were so erratic, my perception of time itself faded. I saw myself slowly slipping, I forgot what day it was first, then, when I blocked out the sun (to keep out the glare on the screen), I completely lost my sense of time. At one point, I recall, there was a game that dealt with numbers and simple addition, it took all of my power just to perform those tasks. My diet has been thrown out of whack too, and I didn't take care to tend to my appearance. So right now, I have heavy bags under my eyes, my hair's all messy.... it's not pretty. I've spent most of my time since 4PM today, just catching up with the internet world and friends. But I tell ya, if there ever was a more effective diet, this is it. It's like conscious hibernation, because... the game substitutes for the dreams and you do nothing. I tried playing standing up, but I found myself immediately wanting to sit. I wonder why it is, I cannot let a game go without having beaten it. I suppose I like closure. I know that I don't do well with books that have vague endings. I need to know what happens before the people die or spend the rest of their lives without event. Even though I physically saw my summer reading and drawings, I couldn't resist the gravitational pull of the video game. In any case, that was a nice little escape from reality. That's another thing (before I finish this train of thought): Sometimes, the screen would become like blinders, and everything around me just fastforwarded like in those movies where the people are walking slowly, while objects flash around them. Scary. At least with games like Monster Rancher, there's no real ending, and so I can sleep easily without the suspense. Okay, topic is dead. _The thing I was wanting to write about on the 16th was my career choice. I know I'm indecisive, and so for people to expect me to just come outright and choose (especially without having experienced a day-in-the-life) is too much to ask. But I know that "time is money" for the adult world, and it can't be wasted on dilly-dallying about considering all options. I just don't know if I would do well in the world of biology. I wanted to do something great, not for recognition, just to merely live life outside the norm. And as interesting as I find biology, I don't think a drive to learn more is enough to truly love a lifetime career. I had always expected to follow the stable (or so I thought) route and just keep drawing on the side as a hobby, but now, the more I consider it, I've seriously thought about changing my life path to something in graphic or digital arts. I know that it's difficult since there are not many scholarships for that kind of thing, but I can really see myself still drawing in thirty years... whereas, with biology, I'm still not even sure of exactly what it is I want in which to specialize. I've found virology and biology in general on a molecular and micro- level the most interesting. It's kind of scary to think that that future is so close. I'm running out of time. "Two roads diverge at a yellow wood," indeed.

       _I thought I might be able to suppress my desire to play that damned game to the very end. Not the case. The moment I picked up that controller, my fate was sealed. I NEED TO KNOW!!! What happens?! What am I missing?! Oh it's terrible, I've been deteriorating both mentally and physically. I realize this, and yet, I keep playing? WHY?! What is it about those flashing colors and harmonized symphony of sounds that keeps me glued to the couch? Like a moth to the flame (-_-). At first I thought that if I beat the game, I would be through with the damned thing, but it wasn't enough. I thought it was just the suspense relating to the story's ending that kept me planted, and to some extent, it was. However, the true culprit? My need to complete it. This game, unlike others I've played less-than recently (rather, I should say "sequentially prior to"), has seemingly endless sidequests and possible outcomes that keep that 99% from reaching 100%. I'm currently at 99% completion. I'd rather not touch the thing again, but now, I've read that there is a "final" ending (-_-) achievable only via 100% completion. That would mean, another at-least-60 hour session of playing. My eyes are burning. This definitely cannot be healthy. I've even lost contact with the internet. To put it plainly: it's sad. I have been conquered. I never really, truly had a strong will with which to begin (I can foresee overeating a prominent problem in my future ¦B). At least, after I got through the storyline the first time, I began sleeping, eating, and showering on my regular schedule. I wasn't thoroughly absorbed to the brink of death or imagining the world had switched places with the game world (a.k.a., insane). I wish I had that thing inside me, er... inhibition? something to fight my urge to play those games. I know I said laziness was supposed to have died, but this lovely wrench has managed to stick itself betwen my cogs. *sigh* I suppose I am incapable of change. Yes... So the story goes... I want to start over. I know once summer ends, I'll regret having wasted it so carelessly on such a frivolity. But no one ever does anything about it! They just stand on the sidelines and watch. I guess that's really all they can do now. I'm supposed to be all grown-up and mature and responsible and strong enough not to use polysyndeton so often (-_-). This must be one of those tests in life. Perhaps it is not so difficult as one would think or in comparison to others' struggles, but to me, I can't quit. It seems so silly from a distance, but if you could only come inside to the nuthouse, you'd see just how insane I am as well as how hard I'm trying. whine whine whine, complain complain, I know. Next paragraph. _Anyways, I've had much going on in my head (after the second cycle of the storyline, much of the twice-completed game becomes routine and not needing of full attention). It' just too bad I forgot most of it (-_-). I do remember my fortune cookie from Panda Express. It was empty. No fortune. Isn't that terrible? You'd think they'd at least have the common decency to insult me with their psychobabble, but apparently, they'd rather threaten me with the prospect of death (or at least, I think that's how the superstition goes). You know? one of those ancient Chinese folktales-- Oh wait! that's right, the fortune cookie was created here in America (-_-)  _I suddenly remembered one of the things I wanted to talk about! heh. It's actually kinda silly, but if you take my life experiences and add in a few explosions, gun shots, and rippling muscles here and there, my life would be a slo-mo action film (or is that list the entire contingency and standard for an action flick?). Take for instance: we were at the Outback Steakhouse and I couldn't decide. Cyclone chicken or the fried shrimp? I saw the waitress out of the corner of my eye: she was fast-approaching our table. I could feel my palms beginning to perspire. which would it be? my eyes darted back and forth, my mind listing the pros and cons, the consequences of either choice. No! I can think under this pressure! I glanced up from the menu for only an instant, and there before the table's edge was the black apron. I watched as a hand reached into one of the pouches, retrieving a pad of paper and pencil. Time was running out. My paternal parental unit had already begun to order. Then my mind became flooded with questions: which was the better deal? how hungry was I? How could the waitress expect the order of drinks and appetizers warm-up enough for the main course ordering?! This was no time to dwell on off-topic thoughts! I needed to recollect myself, but then, my maternal parental unit had already finished her order! Red wire?! Blue wire?! They both looked equally appetizing, but ordering one meant not having the other. I'd just eaten BBQ chicken on my frozen pizza for lunch, but then again, we had coconut shrimp as appetizers! NOooooO! she had arrived at me. One instant seemed to drag on forever, and I, like a deer in the spotlights, panicked. "Chicken! The cyclone chicken, please."  whew!  the decision had been made, and the world was still spinning. Just when i thought I had cleared the hurdle, the woman had the audacity to throw a curveball. "And would you like soup or salad?" Ahh, but I had prepared for this as I had heard the previous orders. a solid, confident "no, thank you." Now I was in. or so I thought. She bombarded me with options, "french fries, this or that, blah blah blah, or garlic mashed potatoes?" I grew tense, thoroughly unprepared for this surprise and verbal trap she had set. I honed in on the last words she said from my memory. "garlic Mashed potatoes" it was. I'd made it, but only to find out, I had tripped the security defenses and all my spy-buddies had died. The chicken? not so great. The potatoes? lack-luster (no offense to Outback Steakhouse, as I imagined their shrimp as exponentially more scrumptious). The only thing that saved me were the stolen mushrooms marinated in wine. Whoops. hehehee....... You see?! totally riveting. I know  I  was on the edge of my seat, well, more or less because the seats were pretty wide from the table. But yes, indeed, much of my life follows suit with this kind of slow fast-paced action. haha if this is all the action my life holds, I'm at least thankful it's not so much a comedy with me as the center joke. _Okay, gots to go. Physicals are tonight. wanna be in tip-top shape (XP). 50 push-ups, baby. Or else feel the wrath of the doctor's hand (>_
