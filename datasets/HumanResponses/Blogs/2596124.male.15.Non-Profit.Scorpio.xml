      Ani Difranco - Make me Stay   I'm going to turn and walk away You can wait til I am far along Then run and come and catch my arm And say you'd die if I were gone I want to hear you call my name It's too easy just to say it soft If I were gone, yes I'm going to turn And walk away you can watch me go Or you can make me stay

      Soundgarden - My Wave   Cry, if you want to cry If it helps you see If it clears your eyes  Hate, if you want to hate If it keeps you safe If it makes you brave   I love this song! Great tune.

      Tell me...how many guys do you have to play before you are satisfied? How many hearts must you break? Why did you have to play me?  The words you spoke, are now meaningless.    Now I know that when you say 'one and only' You mean, as long as there wasn't another.... When you say I love you, you mean I love whoever gives me the most ass wiping.  You never cease to break my heart....I can't believe...those words meant so much to me, when they meant nothing to you.  I don't know how I could love such a hollow person... But...  I do hate you, for everything...yet... I love you so god damned much...I had to let go, don't you understand?  Haven't you ever stepped back and saw what you were doing?  You were going to do the 'unthinkable'....Wasn't that god damned obvious?

      Always in love! Wilco - I'm always in love ---> I'm the man who loves you  I'm bragging, I'm always in love!  If I could, you know I would just hold your hand and you'd understand.. I'M THE MAN WHO LOVES YOU!   WHiskeytown - Crazy about you   If you think I'm crazy,  I'm just crazy about you!!   Cars - You might think  You might think I'm crazy to hang around with you ... You might think I'm crazy All I want is you!   I love, yet hate these lyrics at the same time.

      In response to Celina's question... Yes I have! and...its not pretty.  It hurts, no? Especially if it's right in front of your fucking face....  To add to the pain, they just happened to realize that you're there and go back to say you still mean so much...  How can you really know how much you mean to others?  Or tell others how much they mean to you? I'm sorry, but it's not the fucking words you use...even though they may mean so much to you.  It's what you do....you're actions.  If you don't show someone you love them through your actions....how....how would they ever fucking know?   ...How would I know that you wouldn't do the unthinkable? I don't.  I was scared you would because...I seem to know you better, and I know what you want.  It wasn't what you thought you wanted.  Btw, you can sure turn around real fast on that...It's as if your words all those months were simply...meaningless. I have to say you played me fucking good.  I'm sure you feel happy now, actually I know, having people at your finger tips...how could you...seriously, how can you play people like that....You know what they want, and you know they don't want your friendship. Fuck, I'd rather be a loner!  How many hearts must you break? How many tiil you're satisfied?  Or do you just want to leave people's hearts hanging on a string, just about to break, but you, the great messiah, is there to pull that string up, just enough?  I just to say...you may be a wonderful person.  But you don't care about others... You don't care about the person.   You care about all that attention you get, you think it is not obvious? .... I need to take a walk...

      Bowling for SOup - Life after Lisa   I'm waking up and bakin' Watching the parade cause today's the day I got over you Taking out the trash and the pictures that I stashed Of the two of us in 1992  You stole my heart when Eddie Veder was king I gave you a foot massage I gave you my ring You left me for a drummer cause you said I couldn't sing But, That's ok  Cause there'll be No more mountain climbing in the rain No more Long hair clogging up the drain No more Life will never be the same Life after Lisa is not so bad at all  Saw you with the dude who gave us our first tattoos Did he cover up my name that was fast Can you believe that I'm alive, still not working 9 to 5 And my little band is kicking some ass  So when you asked me if I hated you now It's not you it's just all of the times I missed out On sleeping with your roommate every time you passed out But, That's ok  I'll bet you're saying to yourself that you'll find somebody else like me But all I've gotta say is there ain't no fucking way that you're getting me to say I'm sorry..........No today!!!  Cleaning up the house again Listening to House Of Pain Having headaches in my brain Listening to you complain Shopping at the mall again I'm out of rhymes I've gotta say Life after Lisa is not so bad at all!!!!

       it's your life...just don't take the easy way out by not telling them and just leaving them alone and avoiding them, its selfish and wrong. Happiness exists only on top of somebody else's unhappiness.    One of the most beautiful things I've seen...  I...I am simply sorry.

      Wow...that was a fast recovery...fucking skank.  Now I'm kinda glad about what I did, so I wouldn't have to deal with what you are doing now, fucking bitch. Why the fuck did you fucking talk to me, why the fuck did you start all this shit.  You know, I was perfectly happy before!  Now it's all ruined.  Now I've seen too much, I will never be ignorant again, and I will never be happy.  BTW, why do you even bother to keep on talking to me, isn't it obvious I Don't want to talk to you? What?! Trying to show off your fucking skankiness to me? WTf is wrong with you bitch.

      What's wrong with me? ... I dunno I just feel bad... Guess it's my fault, right? Wait , of course it's my fault.  But what can I do, there was no way out of it...this is just the way it is...it's better than...if it was the other way....that's probably why I did it.. Because it would hurt more if you did what I know you were going to do, I could see it and feel it, don't lie to me. I know what you were thinking

      Kindness is an attribute that is not natural to people.  Therefore, I do not wish to express it.  It's meaningless. And you, you're just bullshit :)  Why bother? Why do I bother with you, why do I even bother...all you do is create pain.  Just fucking fuck off.  Don't fucking look at me, talk to me, because frankly.  I don't give a shit about you, all you do is make my life miserable.  Just, just go away.

      Dead Poetic - Tell myself goodbye   I thought you had me forever. But I'm sure you thought the same about me. And I'm sorry, so sorry.  These dreams run through my head that frolic through some tube of my brain. I'm going insane, I've forgotten my name. So I'll use yours, like a dropped friend I wish I never left. I wish I never left you. I wish I never left you. I can't tell the light from the dark.  The rain falls, and I never meant to leave you standing.

      I don't understand why peopel want to 'expand' their social lives and know more people....like seriously, dipshit, Don't you know enough people? Why give yourself more worries?  Personally, I'd perfer to have absolutely no social connetions and have no worries, so when I disappear, nothing happens. But that's a little too late to do...

Plus, I simply cannot bring myself to do so...I would be speechless... I would want to tell you so much, but...you cannot know, you simply cannot know.  Since...it would completely defeat the purpose of the past while...  ------------------------  Feels like a weekend...fuck....oh well.

Too late Tonight To drag the past out into the light We're one, but we're not the same We get to  Carry each other One...  Have you come here for forgiveness Have you come to raise the dead Have you come here to play Jesus To the lepers in your head  Did I ask too much More than a lot You gave me nothing Now it's all I got We're one But we're not the same Well we  Hurt each other Then we do it again You say Love is a temple Love a higher law Love is a temple Love the higher law You ask me to enter But then you make me crawl And I can't be holding on To what you got When all you got is hurt  One love One blood One life You got to do what you should One life With each other Sisters Brothers One life But we're not the same We get to  Carry each other Carry each other  One...life  One    Well...not much to cut from this beauty, it's just so beautiful!

Nothing matters in this world. Nothing.  THe only reason I don't die is because....  ANything worth living for?  No  Anything worth dying for?  No.  Dashboard Confessionals - Am I missing  Am I missing? ...well enough about me Are you missing?

All my marks suddenly went down quite a bit since...well the past week, when a lot of important stuff was to be done, *Sigh* Who cares?!  Oh well, I'm not really complaining too much, that's what I get for not doing anything.  I kinda like not having to care.  I hate caring, it only brings pain and disappointment.

      For today, Ill go ahead and repeat a lyric from before, but the WHOLE thing.  That will be all for today, then I'm off to chill!  Nine Days - Back to Me   If you would just come back to me I would be so GOOD!  Put your trust back in me the least I think you should.  We'll call it my pathology so I misunderSTOOD!  A bit selfish I should be if I could change I would.  See it on my FACE!   All I wanted was a freind to look in me to comprehend.  All I wanted was to fly how could you sit and watch me die  All I wanted was you there your cruelty was my despair.  You just killed me so the story goes.   Once upon a time there was a girl who loved me more than life itself.  By the duck pond she said,  Carved our names into the bark we climbed the tree.  I slipped and fell behind,  Now I'm sorry.   All reminds me of your name we sought fortune through the rain.  Every day and every place everywhere I kissed your face.  All the sacrifice in vain how could you put all the blame on me  That's not fair so the story goes.   Once upon a time we had the moon we had the stars we were divine.  Upon my shoulder she cried.  Now she hides the faith she fears she throws herself.  Before her bed of lies.  She'll be sorry.   If you would just come back to me!...  It's alright.  It's alright.  It's alright.   I simply love this song! for some reason...*rolls eyes*  D /// *Out*

      Am I strange for limiting my social connections, rather than expanding them?  I do not know, but what I know is that I do not wish to know anyone more because, less to care about, less to worry about...  Isn't it better that way?  Why burden yourself, and have to spread your energy and care to so many people? I rather just care about the few people that matter to me, so I can at least have a better chance of helping them out, and being a friend.

And if the love is real you gotta' let yourself go, Just to bring it back.     If you truly love someone...and you know, well you know  you are wasting their time etc.  You need to let them go... But you can't bring them back....no you can't.  [If you've been in my shoes, you'll know what I mean, but if you aren't in my shoes...then you won't :P THe lovelyness of secrets, ya?]  Treble Charger - Another Dollar   Maybe this time I'm finally losing my mind Cause I could use the change Haven't you heard Things are way more absurd They're even kind of strange  So why do we even bother Cause I don't recall inviting you here You're spending another dollar watching me fall  It doesn't look so good I'd get out if I could And never start again

      Weezer - El Scorcho    How stupid is it? I can't talk about it  I gotta sing about it and make a record of my heart   How stupid is it? For all I know you want me too  And maybe you just don't know what to do or maybe you're scared to say:  "I'm falling for you"   I wish I could get my head out of the sand  'Cuz I think we'd make a good team  And you would keep my fingernails clean  But that's just a stupid dream that I won't realize  'Cuz I can't even look in your eyes without shakin', and i ain't fakin'     Funny song but yeah, I'm just like that!   If you look me in the eyes and have something serious to say...I'll be speechless, especially if you mean something to me.... I dunno, I am always at a loss of words, but it's not because I don't care it's just because...I don't want to say the wrong things...because I care for you too much...

Last time I talked to you You were lonely and out of place You were looking down on me  Lost out in space We laid underneath the stars Strung out and feeling brave  I watched the red orange glow I watched you float away   Down here in the atmosphere Garbage and city lights You've gone to save your tired soul You've gone to save our lives I turned on the radio To find you on satellite  I'm waiting for this sky to fall I'm waiting for a sign All we are Is all so far    You're falling back to me You're a star that I can see I know you're out there Somewhere out there  You're falling out of reach Defying gravity I know you're out there Somewhere out there   Hope you remember me When you're home sick  and need a change I miss your purple hair I miss the way you taste I know you'll come back someday  On a bed of nails I'll wait  I'm praying that you don't burn out Or fade away All we are Is all so far   I know you're out there Somewhere out there You're falling back to me I know I know  You're falling out of reach  I know    I know you're out there.  But you will never fall back on me, and you, and no one will ever come back in reach.  You will only fade, You can fade forever in me.  But I am already faded in you.

      Well read a poem basically saying how this kid, followed what his parents wanted for him, a good life and such.  He ended up hating it, but sacrificed his life for others...it hurts I tell you it burns!  Another poem is when the kid did not want to hurt those that he loved by disappointing them and such, so....he ran..... I can feel for both of them....  Bah, sacrifice is a double-edged sword [/cliche] It will hurt you, but benifit others so much! And for that, you should feel good.  But if some people are just not...I dunno grateful? It's hard not to just break down and let life pass you by.

      Well today was fucked up.  Got horrible on everythin I did, oh well I don't care anymore.  If my parents piss me off too much, I'll just get up and walk the fuck out of here, so yeah.  Heh, I'm such a loser, I don't even know why I bother talking to some people.  Just like fuck off yeah. Yep...probably because I tend to ignore people and dont' show any interesting in talking to them because....well I do not have any interest.  So go fuck a goat

      Good song  -->  Ani DiFranco - FUck you   Think I'm going for a walk now I feel a little unsteady I don't want nobody to follow me 'Cept maybe you I could make you happy you know If you weren't already I could do a lot of things And i do :]  So fuck you And your untouchable face And fuck you For existing in the first place And who am I That I should be vying for your touch And who am I I bet you can't even tell me that much  Y'know, I don't look forward To seeing you again soon You'll look like a photograph of yourself taken from far far away And I won't know what to do And I won't know what to say  Except fuck you...  I see you and I'm so perplexed What was I thinking What will I think of next Where can I hide In the back room there's a lamp that hangs over the pool table And when the fan is on it swings Gently side to side There's a changing constellation Of balls as we are playing I see orion and say nothing The only thing i can think of saying  Is fuck you...   I cut out a lot of lyrics because..well she likes to talk a lot  But she's a great artist indeed

      You know what? I am biased, so what?  I don't give a shit what you may think.  I have a set of beliefs and such, and well you cant' do shit to change that, so fuck you.  Also, I hate some people just because well they are them, and are absolute fags and piss me off.  Other than that, I don't know why I don't like them, sometime I just have a feeling, and then I think they are fags and don't like them. That's that.  So basically, don't bring them up, and if you are one of those people I hate, then fuck off and dont' aggravate me.   I simply hate you.

      Rejoice I got a guitar stand, less space, and easy grabbing (y) Now...my finger tips hurt, I need more finger strength and stronger calluses.  Then I can do a full bend with no trouble!  The only problem now is that  it hurts my fingers if I do it too often.  Heard Stairway to Heaven? no? Then you're a fucking fuck nut.

      Here's a quote from 'I got the music in me' by Kiki Dee   Ain't got no trouble in my life, No foolish dream to make me cry. I'm never frightened or worried, I know I'll always get by.   I knew you'd like it  -------------------------------- Here is another great song  Great to listen to too, good beat  The Postal Service - Such great heights [Btw, it was a bitch to find the lyrics, need "!]   In our eyes are mirror images and when We kiss they're perfectly aligned  And I have to speculate that God himself Did make us into corresponding shapes like Puzzle pieces from the clay True, it may seem like a stretch, but Its thoughts like this that catch my troubled Head when you're away when I am missing you to death  When you are out there on the road for Several weeks of shows and when you scan The radio, I hope this song will guide you home  I tried my best to leave this all on your machine but the persistent beat it sounded thin upon listening

      If you have the will and you feel it is right, and what you want. You can do anything, and you can be anyone.  Tis true!  Beatles - We can work it out   While you see it your way, Run the risk of knowing that our love may soon be gone. We can work it out   Too lazy to find the rest  Another great song is Judy Collins - Both Sides Now

      Weezer - Only in Dreams basically as the title says...    You can’t resist her. She’s in your bones. She is your marrow, and your ride home.  You can’t avoid her. She’s in the air. And in between molecules of oxygen and carbon dioxide.  Only in dreams, you’ll see what it means. Reach out our hands. Hold on to hers. But when we wake, it’s all been erased. And so it seems... only in dreams.  You walk up to her. Ask her to dance. She says ’hey baby, I just might take a chance.’  You say it’s a good thing. That you float in the air. Up where there’s no way I will crush Your pretty toenails into a thousand pieces.   7 minute song...BUt i love it, I love it dearly  Some times...you just can't avoid that which you want to avoid, too bad, eh....yeah... Unfotunately.  So you either deal with them up front. or You just let them hurt you everytime you see them.

      Here are some tid bits of Nine Days - Back to Me  It's a real good song, so ask me for it.   If you would just come back to me I would be so good! Put your trust back in me the least I think you should. We’ll call it my pathology so I misunderstood! A bit selfish I should be if I could change I would. See it on my face!  You just killed me so the story goes. Once upon a time there was a girl who loved me more than life itself. By the duck pond she said, Carved our names into the bark we climbed the tree. I slipped and fell behind, Now I’m sorry.  All reminds me of your name we sought fortune through the rain. Every day and every place everywhere I kissed your face. All the sacrifice in vain how could you put all the blame on me?   Once upon a time we had the moon we had the stars we were divine. Upon my shoulder she cried. Now she hides the faith she fears she throws herself. Before her bed of lies. She’ll be sorry.

      I swear some people are just fucking advertising themselves, really pisses me off. Seriously. People don't just come swarming because they do. Because you fucking give them something they want, in most cases.  ATTENTION!   Attention whores! Oh I wish I could put that picture up, ya!   Attention whores need attention and attention whores give attention to other attention whores, thus they are all one big happy family of attention whores. And I have attention whores, why? Because the fucking way they act to try to get attention, and persist as if they are fucking mentally handicapped or something.   Thing is that, attention whores, when they fall, they fall hard. And if you are an attention whore, don't you fucking dare come running to me, fuck no. I'll fucking shoot you down and beat you so bad you're gonna cry. SO fucking fuck off, dicks Fucking dicks.   Question:  What do you look for in a person? Who they are?  Or how much attention you get from them regardless?   Sadly enough, lots of people look for the latter, and that...that's just fucking pitiful, it is indeed.

      You can be all that you want to be.  You just need to believe in yourself, and have someone to believe in you. I believe in you.  I believe you can be anything you want, you just have to let yourself get there.  And if you need a backstop, I'll be there, to catch you if you fall  Weezer - Photograph   If you want it,  You can have it, But you gotta learn to reach up there and grab it    Our Lady Peace - Made of Steel   They knock you down I’ll pick you up... They laugh at you I’ll shut them up   I would do that for any friend of mine, at any expense.  You need only to test me.  Rancid - Fall Back Down   If I fall back down, you're gonna help me back up again If I fall back down, you're gonna be my friend    I feel strange...  Btw I am a hypocrite, I know the things I say, are what I should do.  But I have reasons to do otherwise, reasons that may not be logical, but logic is nothing compared to the strength of a beating heart. So don't you fucking tell me why should you do this shit and not me, don't give me that bullshit, just don't.  You think I haven't thought about this long enough?  Nothing is ever certain.  That's what Life is about, taking risks, finding things out.  THe hard way...or the easy  way.

Or that I know who you are. I am probably very different from what you think I am.  You can only see what I do.  You can't see what I think.  YOu can feel what I feel. How can you know me.  Seriously...If you knew the shit that went up in my head, you wouldn't even want to know me. You'd think I am a complete sadistic evil shit, which I am.  What am I trying to say, I have no clue.  Just wanted to say that...Hey I'm not pissed, lol...it's been a while since I was actually really pisssed off and depressed...now I just don't really give a shit about what goes on.  It just flies past me...  I'm stuck at a stop sign And life still rides along  - Me!

      You know what I realized today.  I am really sadistic, lol...  Showed a friend the scene in Saving Private Ryan on the beach with lots of blowing up and death and stuff.... I laughed...like lots, I thought it was amusing, the people's lives were so fuckign expendable and they were like fuckign rag dolls...just like in Return of the King with the elephant things kicking people around and people flying around and stuff..meh  But him, yeah he was just all...I dunno didn't feel great about it..*shrugs*

      All American Rejects - Swing, Swing   I'm dreaming of her  She's seeing other guys  Emotions they stir  The sun is gone.  The nights are long  And I am left while the tears fall.   Do you know what it feels like,  being alone?  I'll find someone new   Swing, Swing, Swing from the tangles of  My heart is crushed by a former love  Can you help me find a way  To carry on again.   Wish cast into the sky  I'm moving on  Sweet beginnings do arise  She knows I was wrong  The notes are old,  They bend, they fold  and so do I to a new love.

That everyone, you know Someday, will Die ANd instead of saying all of your goodbyes,  Let them know you Realize That life goes fast,  It's hard to make a good things last    I love flaming lips, so funky  -------------------------  Well one good thing is that yesterday I went to a movie and hung out with a couple friends, which is good. Was pretty fun I can say! :D

      Ok fuck this, my dad is a fuckng penis!!! god damned!  I come back and he gets all loco on me, like wtf, then he's picking up the smallest things on me and then fucking goes all crazy ass on me, like wtf! I want to get out of here, this is fucking pissing me off.  He has no fucking respect for anyone, why the fucking should I resepct him, like wtf.  He askes a stupid question, why the fuck should I answer something.  I tell him something, he fucking goes crazy on me, why the fuck should I have told him. Fuck him, seriously fuck him.  And fuck, he bursts into my room at 3AM and yells at me and starts screaming at me to answer him, like fuck him, then he left and came back again to yell so more.  Like, you fuck face, go fuck a goat you fucking Cunt!!!!  He askes me why I dont' want to talk to him...oh I wonder why, if I step off wrong, then I get yelled at and then have to explain why I said that...like WHAT THE FUCK   go fuck a fucking goat you dick sucking shit face!  ---------------------------------  I was thinking on the bus...quite a bit actually, had about...6 hours to do so?  Why do I deserve life? ... I don't.  Have I made anyone's life any better? No. Have I made the world any better? No. Do I plan to do any of those? No.  In other words, I haven't done anything to warrant my existance.... In addition, the end of me, wouldnt be so bad after all, people would be happy and life would roll on.  I have no reason to be here.  I am only here to hurt people, to do bad.  THe reason we live is to die.  Why wait for death?  When you could simply let it in and end your waiting.  Well the trip was fun up until then.  --------------------------  How do you find YOU... I believe that....you have to spend oddles of time alone.  Away from everyone and everything...then just start to think and wonder what are you....  ----------------------------  Just wondering....does anything good you've done..mean anything? Or...is it just a given. But if you do something wrong, you get the whole shit ass act shit bitchin' shit kicking crap...   Ok, I'm not really complaining...I'm just wondering, because when I look at things....I try to see the whole picture, not just the now and what you did right now..because that is hardly fair and right....  I dunno...I just think some people should die and stop being cocky and shit.  Because one of these days I'll just go off and kill all of you, then end it with my life.

      To truly be yourself, I believe that you must spend time alone. Only when you are alone, can you understand who you are and what you stand for, and what it it you are striving for in life.  -------------------------------  It's funny....it's not always easy to be cruel..  Sometimes, it's easy to be cruel and hard to be nice.... but other times....I dunno.... I find that sometimes it's hard to be cruel...and easy to be nice...I dunno....  BYe

      Funny: I dreamed about how fun and happy this day would be.  I planned what I would do! I knew that all I wanted was...you Now, all that, all those dreams, washed away forever....yet those feelings never died.  I think of you every night...just wondering...how you are doing...how things are...  I used to think of you every night too, but now, it's different, it's not about how lucky I am, how nice things were...  I know I cannot get things back.  SInce it's me, that slammed the door.  Odd, no?  I just wonder....how do you feel...what do you really think.  -----------------------------  Just tell me you're alright, do not tell me what I want to hear.  Tell me...tell me if you are fine now, if you are happy... But don't ever tell me to...just move along, have a sudden change of heart because...that is not going to happen.  Sometimes I just want to tell you shut up, but...I can't bring myself to it...it doesnt' feel right...  HOpe all those stupid reminders of fuckign fags just go away soon.  Or I, I will disappear.  I will simply slip behind the scene without notice.  ALl will be well, all will be well...  That I can promise you.

      *sigh* I'm simply tired.  Tired of all.  All this complaining, all the thought put into complaining.  I don't know...I used to...think so differently, care so much... I found that absolutely retarded.  Now...I simply don't care.  Eveything can slip right by me, and...I wouldn't shed a tear, I wouldn't give it a second thought. Everything is pointless, useless, frustrating.  I just have to say...my favourite song is Eric Clapton - Tears in Heaven. It's just so beautiful. It will be my favourite for a long time.

      I do not understand why you want to shove that shit in my face.  Why do you treat people like they are a fucking game? Do you realize...[flaming lips!] You are a fucking fag shit ass bitch cock sucking prick? no?  Well you are, and you can shut your mouth.  I don't need you talking to me, or me listening to you, why I haven't just simply told you to shut up, is a wonder. I actually really want to just tell you to shut up and have nothing to do with me...the only reason why you talk to me is if you want something....like always.  You made me feel like shit...like always. Did I feel like something? Maybe, but those were lies.  Once I look back...nvm.

        People are afraid to pursue their most important dreams because they feel that they don't deserve them, or that they'll be unable to achieve them.  - The Alchemist  What if...my dream was you... What if...what I wanted to achieve was for you to be happy, not matter what.  At whatever cost, even if it meant I...I would suffer as well.  I can see how Vicky sees that this book speaks to her...well yeah... I can also see how it speaks to me.

      This here is a real sad song...Clapton wrote this after his baby fell out of an apartment and died...[thanks to david for the info]  Eric Clapton - Tears in Heaven   Would you know my name If I saw you in heaven?  Would it be the same If I saw you in heaven? I must be strong and carry on 'Cause I know I don't belong here in heaven...    Would you hold my hand If I saw you in heaven? Would you help me stand If I saw you in heaven?  I'll find my way through night and day 'Cause I know I just can't stay here in heaven...   Time can bring you down, time can bend your knees Time can break your heart, have you begging please...begging please   Beyond the door there's peace I'm sure And I know there'll be no more tears in heaven...

      If you think that you would do whatever is best for the one you love, think again.  Would you?  What is best for the one you love? FOr you to pull them on a chain dragging them along because frankly, you are not good enough? I think not.  Step back, take a look.    Maybe the I did the wrong thing, but I can rest at the fact that I did it for... the one I love.  Do you really believe I wanted things like this? It's not what you want, it's what your loved ones' NEED, it's not what your loved ones' WANT. You know what they need, give them what they need.

Seriously...You can go to hell.  The world is a litle bigger than that, and since you've been through that shit...one would assume you would...have more awareness and respect? Guess not..bitch.  Only known you for a few months, plus...I'm not really attached to you anyways so just...fuck off?

You do go and say, oh I'll go be a jerk so you can have a chance.... Wtf....wtf...You just make me want to kill you...just kill you for even thinking of playing people's feelings like that...  And the other YOU! You hear this stuff, yet you calmly brush it aside...look at what you have been through... Do you like it when people play with your feelings?

The CUre - Lovesong   Whenever I'm alone with you you make me feel Like i am home again whenever I'm alone with You you make me feel like I am whole again  Whenever I'm alone with you you make me feel Like I am young again whenever I'm alone with You you make me feel like i am fun again  However far away I will always love you however Long i stay i will always love you whatever Words I say I will always love you I will always Love you  Whenever I'm alone with you you make me feel Like I am free again whenever I'm alone with You you make me feel like I am clean again   Maybe just..remember this?

Like if you want to say something, just say it, don't like stare at people.... It's not like people know what you're trying to say when you just look at them, lol...

      Ok that was weird...in a class today, I just felt...so out of it....it was real queer...  I just felt like...crying. *Shrugs* I can keep compsure. Strange thing, I don't even know what was bothering me...hell maybe I just don't want to know.  ------------------------------  Dashboard Confessionals - Several Ways to Die Trying   Pacific Sun, you should have warned us, it gets so cold here. And the night can freeze, before you set it on fire.  And our flares go unnoticed. Dimminished, faded just as soon as they are fired.  We are, we are, intrigued. We are, we are, invisible.  Oh, how we've shouted, how we've screamed, take notice, take interest, take me with you.  But all our fears fall on deaf ears.  Tonight, they're burning the roads they built to lead us to the light. And blinding our hearts with their shining lies, while closing our caskets cold and tight. But I'm dying to live.  Pacific sun, you should have warned us, these heights are dizzying, and the climb can kill you long before the fall.  And our trails go unmarked and unmapped and covered just as soon as they are crossed.  We are, we are, intriguing. We are, we are, desirable.  Oh how we've shouted, how we've screamed, take notice, take interest, take me with you.  But all our fears fall on deaf ears.

      Today I woke up...happy.  That's unusual!   *shrugs*  MSN is dumb! the 'idle' thing overlaps the status I put...psh stupid Microsoft!!!   ANyways, yeah it's a good day, for now. I'm eating strawberries..mmm, yummy.  Expect after I rinse my mouth a whole load of seeds and crap comes out....it's so disgusting but funny! haha first time I saw it was just like'....o_O wtf ahaahaa!'  ANyhow, have a good day to you all!  --------------------------------  Dashboard Confessionals - So Beatiful   Your smile is in place so that Everyone watching will see You've got them all convinced But I know so well That you could list your friends But you can't count on them Hold it now, you've got everyone convinced That you're all right When no one else is quite as vulnerable   More of this song later.

      Only have a couple things to say today:  Just because we did a project together doesn't mean I want to be your friend, so shut up and fuck off!  ----------------------  Hey...if someone made a mistake...and if you were really friends...could you not forgive?  I dunno about you...but my friends...just mean so much to me.   I couldn't shun them or get really pissed off at them...without feeling so empty and regretful...  I really don't understand...maybe you were never friends...  Basically...if your friend fucks up, forgive them. If they are doing somthing that really bothers you...won't you have the decency to at least let them know about  it?  BEFORE shutting them out? ... :(  I hate being in the middle... I hate people.  ---------------------------   Hi, I'm Derrick; Attention ain't my game So fuck a goat, And Leave me Alone.  - 'D'

      hmmm...over-emotional.  That'd could describe me...before, maybe even now.  I just fail to show it.   I don't feel like spending energy into showing that shit.  Because simply, Stupid shits never get it, no matter what you do.  How to piss me off... - Really annoy me, in which case, I will just walk off and ignore you utterly for the rest of your life.  - Try to force me to cross my own fucking values.  I dont' care if you cross them, just don't try to make me!  - Crossing your own fucking values.  This pisses me off because if you mean anything to me, I'd be more upseting...that you would actually do something that would make you stand for absolutely jack shit!  If that made sense congratulations! If not, your loss.   This all leads somewhere...I want to be a fucking stone.  And you harden from the outside --> In. Therefore, through showing lack of emotions, lack of a heart/emotions will come in time.

      Another song, lot shoter: Simon & Garfunkel - I am a Rock   A winter's day In a deep and dark December; I am alone, Gazing from my window to the streets below On a freshly fallen silent shroud of snow.   I am a rock, I am an island.    I've built walls, A fortress deep and mighty, That none may penetrate. I have no need of friendship; friendship causes pain. It's laughter and it's loving I disdain.   That's me!!!    I am a rock, I am an island.    Don't talk of love, But I've heard the words before; It's sleeping in my memory. I won't disturb the slumber of feelings that have died. If I never loved I never would have cried.   Ummm...me again!    I am a rock, I am an island.   I have my books And my poetry to protect me; I am shielded in my armor,  Hiding in my room, safe within my womb. I touch no one and no one touches me.   I love this song! Me once again!    I am a rock, I am an island.  And a rock feels no pain; And an island never cries.

      I love this song, here it is: Vroom - Dumb like That   I think I see every star in the sky tonight Removed from the city lights Has never seemed so bright   I know I shouldnt believe a word you say I do anyway  'Cause I'm dumb like that Oh, and all the words I've given to you  When you smiled I thought that it meant something else You were just being yourself, being nice You're always rather polite, to me   [Chorus]: You let me down again You ignored the things I said to you If I was scared of you Then maybe I could leave  And if I walked away right now There would be nothing left for me to loose but doubt    I never fell so far for anyone before Never again I sworex With you hope was restored You make me feel like I've been torn apart I dont like that at all  I've lost control  Oh, And all the words I've given you  I poured my heart out into an empty coffee cup You drank it up, left me here to drown, alone   [Chorus]   I think I've seen every star that I care to see, But I don't wanna leave.  It hurts when you're self deceived I know I shouldn't believe a word you say,  I do it anyway, 'cause I'm dumb like that. And all the words, I've given to you When you smiled I thought that it meant something else. You were just being yourself, being nice,  your always rather polite, to me.   [Chorus]

He doesn't even deserve to die, he deserves to be tortured and suffer for eternity! My god! I wish he'd just fuck off, so I don't have to see his fucking pissed off face ever again!

      When you reflect upon your life, and you're looking at who are your friends and why, remember this.  What does a friend mean to you & what is it you ask of them? What do you expect from yourself in a friendship? How far will you go to keep a friend? and How far will you go for a friend?  Also, acquaintances and friends are VERY different.  So if I do not act like a friend, it's probably because I consider you an acquaintance.  --------------------  For me...a friend means a lot.  I do not like to use 'best' friend because...well if you are my friend, I put you all on this leve playing field.  Because, you all mean a lot to me, and I could not rank you, but make no mistake, you are all the best.

      Here's  short thing:  Why do we always end up alone?   I wonder...what if we felt whole if we are alone.  Why has society seemed to have stressed that....you will be happy if you have friends.  You will be happy if you are in a relationship.  What if things were like this: Yer always surrounded by relationships and friends, but happiness lies in being alone?  Shit for thought.

      You know what pisses me off...(insipred by ryan) People who think the world is hating them because they're going through fucking  Hard TImes :  - Oh no my marks are going down - Oh I can't pick up this chick - Damn, I can't get this $$$$ thing    Dude, SHUT...THE....FUCK...UP!!!!! I'm sorry, but if you're going to break down over that stupid shit, you might as well kill yourself now, before you suffer the real shit.  Have you ever thought what would happen if someone you loved died? Is in pain? Is suffering?  (The latter being the worst :'( )   Have you thought what would happen if you hurt someone you love? and You can't go back and fix it and tell them what you needed to?  Do you ever think about anyone but yourself.  Don't give me that 'of course' shit you dick ass shit cake! THINK ABOUT IT.  What do you worry about, what do you cry for, for what reasons? Do you  care  for someone because you love them.  Or do you care because you want something in return?  If that's the case, go and kill yourself, Or I'll kill you for your sake.  Before you get smacked in the face and realize, YOU'RE A FUCKING FUCK FACE.  -----------------------------------------   Sometimes’  You gotta set free what you love just to bring it back  Would you ever lose me? Would you ever let go of that?  And if the love is real you gotta’ let yourself go’  Just to bring it back.   Question: What if you never get it back.

      My past shall not be revealed.  Who passed through my life and what they meant has no concern with you. My question is why did I let you pass through my life.  That's against all my beliefs, and frankly keeping you around isn't my highest priority.  So, stop fucking reminding my fucking past!! Do you think it brings back good memories? Are you fucking psychotic?! DO YOU KNOW WTF TEARS ARE?! DO YOU KNOW WHY SOME OF US GET THEM?! IT'S BECAUSE WE'RE FUCKING SAD, GET THE FUCKING POINT?!  There is one thing I'll let you know, I cannot love another. My explaination for that, None.  So don't bother me with that stupid shit, I dont' exactly care to think about it more than I already have.  Period, ENd of story.  No more discussion about this shit.

      Do you think this is a fucking joke? WTf is wrong with you.  Does someone always have to smile or else they are fucking sad or pissed or something?  Do you think I smile because I'm happy? I fucking smile so you don't fucking ask me fucking questions.  So you don't fucking get me thinking about all that shit I threw away.  I rather fucking smile than hear your fucking questions pounding in my fucking head! Just fucking pisses me off, so...SHUT THE FUCK UP, get it?  If one day I disappear one lunch or sometime.  Don't look for me, I'll either come back, or I'll be gone.  Away from you.  Away from this place.  Away from memories that haunt my heart each and every fucking day.  That bring my eyes begging to tear. That bring my heart to wrentch. That bring my smile to fade. That brings the world before my eyes, to fade.  That brings me down into the pit of despair where I linger, where I shall die.

That person, makes you see that you are a great person, that you are spcial, and when they do that, you have come to realize how great you really are! If you are not prepared to lose that support...that's what makes you feel empty, get it?  -------------------------------------  Sacrifice....that group said the hardest sacrifice is mental...I'd have to say it's emotional...if tha'ts the same thing....  I sacrificed all my happiness and joy....for You...*sigh*  What have I done...

      Hey I'm not that strange...in the way that I think some people are complete fags and need to die, like really need to die.  They need to die so badly that I wouldn't mind doing the task myself, just give me something to do it with.  Ahahaha..yeah I'm evil, so?  SO what If I think it's funny to see non-real people get killed and such.  I also believe that I would take pleasure in really killing some people.  I kid you not.  Nor do I wish I wasn't kidding. I really wanna just kill some people.  Like, why the hell not, they piss me off, they are fags and they deserve to die.  ANd HEY! don't give me that shit about how I dont' decide who lives and who dies.  Well guess what, everyone has that choice, maybe not the right, but we can sure as hell do whatever the fuck we want!  Well that's that...I'd just like to say...ahahha.  If it's your turn to die, then it's your turn to die.

      hey look! SOmeone' smart! lol   When you have a gf or bf the basic realization is you do NOT flirt with other people and make others fall in love with you when it is a little too late.  - Celina the skanky whore...(ahaha! just jokes bitch, just jokes :D)  But she speaks the truth! And I have a couple more questions... Why would you want someone to fall in love with you? and why the hell would you want to fall in love? Are you a fucking idiot? Or are you just stupid?   When people say it's better to have loved and lost, than to have never loved...I think that's just a dumb thing to say. I Completely disagree with that!!!  Rather ben ignorant and hapy than to have suffered and be pessimistic until the day you die.

      Here's another understanding artist and great tune:  The Used - Bulimic   From the way that you acted To the way that I felt it It wasn't worth my time And now it's sad cause all I missed Wasn't that good to begin with And now I've started you begging  Saying things that you don't mean It isn't worth my time A line's a dime a million times And I'm about to see all of them   Goodbye to you You're taking up my time   It's all I've got just to stay down Why the fuck am I still down I'm hoarding all thats mine Each time I let just one slip by I'm wasting what is mine  I’m about to see a million things I thought I’ve never seen before And I’m bout to do all of the things I dreamed of and I don’t even miss you at  all  (Fuck you)   As I said, music is my way of expressing emotions.  This one just about hits the nail on the head.

      People are not to be understood...How am I to be understand, how are you to be understood...  We cannot depend on people to be able to understand us and what we are feeling and what we value. We are not to bash what people value if it is different from what we value.  You should respect people's values, even though you may not understand them.  Take a second, see what you value, can you justify all you value? Not likely.  The only person who can understand you is you.  Some may not understand themselves or what they value or want.  FOr those people...you need to take time off life, take some time alone, take a walk.  Clear your mind, think...what is it I feel passionate about, what is that I value? Don't give a shit what the world thinks, just what do you believe in?  From that, you will discover what you really want.  -----------------------------------  Do what...whatever you want basically.  YOu get an impluse, do it...if you stop and think, you'll fall in line with society's stereotype ass shit and you'll be like the rest of the stupid fucks following their fucking logic and shit...  Don't do something that...all your values and beliefs contridict...because you'll just be a complete idiot to do so...YOu have to stand up for what you believe in! Or else..you are fucking nothing.  Don't try to be something you aren't, because if you do, you're a fag, and I can name too many of them.  They piss me off and want to make me piss on them.

      My english teacher said the ultimate sign of love, or whatnot is....  To be able to let go...when you see in the future and see that...the one you love cannot be happy with simply staying with you... Therefore...YOu have to let them go, so they can be happy...does that make sense?  Sure does to me...lol...>_

      I never thought I'd ever say this, but life is alright....I guess.  But one thing to keep in mind, prevention is the best cure! In other words! Don't put myself in a situation that WILL, not probably will, but WILL put myself down again.  Shot down shot down! [Hot Hot Heat!!!!] Put all that shit behind! And don't make any new shit!  Some things don't need to experienced TWICE!  There!  So things should be ok from now, onwards.    -----  Wow that felt kinda good to throw that down and if feels alright to write that *thumbs up!*

       U2 - Walk On   And love It's not the easy thing The only baggage That you can bring Not the easy thing The only baggage you can bring Is all that you can't leave behind  And if the darkness is to keep us apart And if the daylight feels like it's a long way off And if your glass heart should crack Before the second you turn back Oh no, be strong  Walk on What you got, they can't steal it No they can't even feel it Walk on Stay safe tonight  You're packing a suitcase for a place None of us has been A place that has to be believed To be seen  You could have flown away A singing bird In an open cage Who will only fly Only fly for freedom  Walk on What you got You can't deny it Can't sell it or buy it Walk on You stay safe tonight  And I know it aches How your heart it breaks You can only take so much  Walk on Home Hard to know what it is If you never had one Home I can't say where it is But I know I'm going Home That's where the heart is  And I know it aches And your heart it breaks You can only take so much Walk on  Leave it behind You've got to leave it behind  All that you fashion All that you make All that you build All that you break  All that you measure All that you feel All this you can leave behind  All that you reason All that you care  It's only time And I'll never fill up all my mind  All that you sense All that you scheme All you dress up And all that you see  All you create All that you wreck All that you hate

       You almost always pick the best times To drop the worst lines You almost made me cry again this time Another false alarm Red flashing lights Well this time I'm not going to watch myself die  I think I made it a game to play your game And let myself cry I buried myself aive on the inside So I could shut you out And let you go away for a long time  I guess it's ok I puked the day away I guess it's better you trapped yourself in your own way And if you want me back You're gonna have to ask Nicer than that  I think the chain broke away And I felt it the day that I had my own time I took advantage of myself and felt fine But it was worth the night I caught an early flight and I made it home With my foot on your neck I finally have you Right where I want you  - THe Used [Buried myself alive]

       Ok I just want to warn you that when I wrote this song I was listening to the  Cure a lot, so...  You don’t know how much I need you. While you’re around I don’t feel blue. And when we kiss I know that you need me too. I can’t believe I found a love that’s so pure and true.  But it all was bullshit. It was a goddam joke. And when I think of you and  I hope you fucking choke.  I hope you’re glad with what you’ve done to me. I lay in bed all day long feeling melancholy. You left me here all alone’ tears running constantly.  Oh somebody kill me please somebody kill me please I’m on my knees pretty pretty please kill me.  I want to die. Put a bullet in my head.  - Adam Sandler [Somebody Kill me]

      I would just like to say, EO is really gay! It's owned by a bunch of snotty kids who pay a few bucks and live on it.  Which is real sad, and I have to say unprofessional.  Just because someone donates money doesn't mean you give them all the powers in the world.  I dunno...this may sound weird, but in this case it's like you're trying to appeal to their evil side? You're giving them all this power and such.  You can tell they're in it for the power because EO is not something you would wanna simply donate because you like it...I'm sorry, but it's too poor.  As far as I've seen when you 'donate', wether to a website or charity...you do it because you care and because you simply want to help out! Maybe because it's a good cause, or the people are doing a superb job and you want to show your appreciate.  NOT  because you want some administrative powers or your fucking name on some shit.  Oh well, lesson kids:  You can buy yourself all the power you want, but will you really be satisfied in that investment? OR would you feel better giving that money somewhere it just might matter?  P.S This might sound weird...it's one of those good vs. bad kinda things, I guess

      hmmm, carrying on from saturday...  SO ULTIMATELY, protect yourself! Because in the very very end, you're going to pay the price. Protect yourself from anything that could possibly hurt you!!! Deploy any measures necessary!! HATE, CRUELTY, DEATH!!  Well maybe kindness...but unfortunately that usually tends to hurt you, or so I've experienced.  Don't ask, it's freaking complicated, and probably won't make any sense because you aren't me.  But yeah, hell, no one can blame you for just trying to keep your heart out of trouble! And if they do, beat the shit out of them! or if you are a little more controlled ignore them! :D

      Love is something everyone should experience, but the saddness that follows is something no one should ever experience.  THEREFORE, love should not be experienced.  Not because it's a bad thing, because it leads to a pile of horse shit.  THUS, I will not even attempt to throw myself into love's arms again.  That's a lesson to all of you :P

      You know what, there is no point in speaking when the person obviously doesn't wanna talk to you sooo, why the hell bother? It's so fucking useless it makes me laff.  And don't say you don't really know if the person's interested in talking or something...ARE YOU A FUCKING BLIND SHIT OR SOMETHING?!?!  Don't even put the in the effort.  So pointless... And yes this lil thing pisses me off, both sides of it.  -----------------  Something that takes too much effort and heart is to attempt to satisfy and make people happy.  It is simply futile.  And only results in...letting you down anyways.  So as said so many times, why bother try for something and getting shot down? Why not just stay at the same level, and get your hopes up only to be shot down?  Psh, that may sound messed up but I don't care.  This is for me, not for you.   I'm surprised I'm not yelling and screaming in this blog or at someone. My temper has been alright lately I guess.

      Do things for your sake.  Whether it's for you directly or if it's so you can sleep at night knowing that you did you what you could.  It's all about you.  Remember that.  -------------------  Lol, what does it take for some people to realize things? or even care?  A dead body? A slap in the face?  An obvious seris of words?  Hahaha yeah I am pretty naive myself and such...this thing is probably refering to me *laffs*  -------------------------  Haha I was listening to K-rock  I tend to stay away from jogging because have you notice, it's always the jogger who finds the dead bodies... I much rather just be at home eating popcorn and watching porn. OH C"MON! I know you like porno!   hahaha that cracked me up   ------------------------   No one listens, but I'm ok with it.  - Our Lady Peace [Blister] goooooood song!

        I should laugh, but I cry Because your love has passed me by. You took me by surprise. You didn't realize That I was waiting.  Time goes slowly, But carries on. And now the best years Have come and gone. You took me by surprise. I didn't realize That you were laughing.  Laughing! The things you're doing to me. Laughing! They're not the way it should be. You took away everything I had. You put the hurt on me.  I go alone now Calling your name After losing At the game. You took me by surprise. I didn't realize That you were laughing    - The Guess Who

You have to spend time with someone to develop any kind of trust between them.

You'll have to figure that one out :P  By the way, I mean nothing negative towards god. And I guess it's a good thing that he did it, not bad.

       Please send me anything but signals that are mixed, cause I can't read your rolling eyes. Out of touch; are we out of time?  - Dashboard Confessional  He's right! Don't send mixed signals! It's really weird o_O  --------------------  You know what I just kinda realized? Most chicks are a lot more emotionally than most guys....ahahaha Well I'm just saying this from what I see :P

      hm, I have an ebloggy now, uh here it is:  urlLink CLICK BITCH CLICK!   I might be switching over to that, who knows, it looks simple, the way I like it. Whadda ya think?  -----------------------------  You know when people say how we're all waiting for some love to come around and pop into our lives? I think they are fucked up! HAhaha!   Yeah but really...if you want something, you go and get it, eh? Ok good 'unf!   If you want it, you can have it,  But you gotta learn to reach up there and grab it  - Weezer  I've said that before, but I love it so much

       Show me how you do that trick The one that makes me scream she said The one that makes me laugh she said And threw her arms around my neck Show me how you do it and I promise you I promise that I'll run away with you I'll run away with you  - The Cure  -------------------------------------------  Why spread the love when can keep it tight and strong? Rather than loose and weak.  Why do you want to know more people? So you can subject yourself to more pain? Is it because you like to suffer? Don't you have enough people to spill your heart for?    Am I selfish? Yes, so what's your point? Negative characteristics are the way to go! They keep you safe, like how Hate keeps you safe.  -------------------  Is it just me or are the ones that care for you are the ones that scare you the most? lol, wait...I can't tell if I'm joking...  -------------------------------------------  Why do I write this stuff?  Because where else would I be able to write my thoughts? hm?  You know, it feels a lot better to write stuff out rather than have it eat you inside out.  This is where a record my thoughts, you may take them into account or ignore them, I really don't care.  Blogging is not for YOU, it's for ME.  It's for me to just...say what the hell is on my mind! There.

      My Life, my very existance is so meaningless.   AFTER-THOUGHT: Maybe I do have meaning, to create shit :D I don't think I've actually done any good, ahahaha.  I've hindered, hurt, destroyed...I'm sure you can think of more So basically, in my path there has only been suffering.   ---------------------------  If you want to say something to someone, just say it.  Why wait? It could be your last chance.  ---------------------------  You want true love? Ok, but think about this: There is a price for true love.  Are you willing to suffer?

       News  Ok, I'm home now...  Ok...well maybe you knew, maybe you didn't but I was always on the edge, just waiting for something to push me over.  I've been pushed.    Everything you do, will catch up to you.  It's up to you now to decide how to deal with it. I don't know what I'm going to do, maybe I'm being rash....We'll see...basically...nothing's definite btw, if I do something 'stupid' uh just go ahead and let me because, that's the only way people learn.  So yeah,  I'll just leave it at this song:  U2 - Kite   Something Is about to give  I can feel it coming  I think I know what it is   I’m not afraid to die  I’m not afraid to live  And when I’m flat on my back  I hope to feel like I did   And hardness  It sets in  You need some protection  The thinner the skin   I want you to know  That you don’t need me anymore  I want you to know  You don’t need anyone  Or anything at all   Chorus: Who’s to say where the wind will take you  Who’s to say what it is will break you  I don’t know  Which way the wind will blow   Who’s to know when the time has come around  Don’t want to see you cry  I know that this is not goodbye   It’s somewhere I can taste the salty sea  There’s a kite blowing out of control on the breeze  I wonder what’s gonna happen to you  You wonder what has happened to me   I’m a man  I’m not a child  A man who sees  The shadow behind your eyes   Did I waste it  Not so much I couldn’t taste it  "ife should be fragrant  Rooftop to the basement    The last of the rocks stars  When hip’hop drove the big cars  In the time when new media  Was the big idea  What was the big idea

      Be indifferent.  Hell, how can you get hurt if you're indifferent?! EXACTLY! DAMN!  There is a reason for everything, you just probably don't want to see what it is. Or you just don't want to find out :P  Kuddos to you! It's better knowing nothing at all, than knowing something. Forgot where that's from...maybe the shuffle wil bring it up one of these days :P  ---------------  Ok here's something for the whole family!!!  Flaming Lips - She don't use Jelly   I know a girl who,  Thinks of ghosts She'll make you breakfast, She'll make you toast; But she don't use butter And she don't use cheese She don't use jelly, Or any of these. She uses... Vaseline!  I know a guy who, goes to shows, When he's at home And he blows his nose; He don't use tissues Or his sleeve He don't use napkins,  Or any of these He uses... Magazines!  I know a girl who, Reminds me of cher, She's always changing The colour of her hair She don't use nothing That you buy at the store She likes her hair to... be real organe She uses Tangerines!!

       Everything is Skin Deep - Matthew Good Band -----------  I, remember feeling low And I, remember losing hope And I, remember all the feelings And the day they stopped  -----------  I know I've put this up before, but we all have to reminded that..we're young souls! :P Thanks to Celina again for this song  Third Eye Blind - Wake for Young Souls   Today I found my soul I felt it die inside of me yeah So I turn to you Life is like we never know  I have your face in a photo in high school And you were alive But that's all I had And I can't remember  Who I was myself then And it doesn't help Still I look to you as a friend To tell me  Who we are now, who we are It's who we are now, who we are Where does time go now on a wake for young souls  Another lullaby go sing oh  Well the wind that blows It's blowing colder And the child that grows She's growing older And the friends we know They'll turn a shoulder But the friends we know They're growing colder   Cycle of the moon brings blood to the woman And blood of the woman brings birth of a child The child grow up Keep forgetting something Birth of a child comes someplace while  You're living great days with the shade of the wind Unbodied unsouled unheard unseen On the day of the dead like a song in my head Hear you speak to me in the shape of a dress say Treat me natural like a wind that blows Follow the direction no matter where it goes So it shall be the earth and the sea Let the truth blow like a hurricane through me  If I've been cold, if I've spoken in anger Two have been born Forgive me No I don't see your mother Not like before Though she hasn't forgotten She doesn't like to be reminded anymore Then he got married It didn't come without tears But the day you died I had laughter for these years  All the things we know They're gonna fall away from me yeah Like a grain of sand, it slips through a good friend's hand

And David (Queen lover) would agree with me! :P that whitey!  Queen - Old Fashioned Lover Boy   I can dim the lights And sing you songs full of sad things We can do the tango just for two I can serenade and gently play On your heart strings Be your Valentino just for you  Ooh love Ooh lover boy What you did tonight hey boy? Set my alarm turn on my charm That's because I'm a good old fashioned lover boy  Ooh let me feel you heartbeat Ooh can you feel my love heat Come on and sit on my hot seat of love And tell me how do you feel right after all I'd like for you and I to go romancing Say the word your wish is my command  Ooh love Ooh lover boy what you did tonight hey boy? Write my letter feel much better And use my fancy patter on the telephone  When I'm not with you Think of you always I miss you When I'm not with you Think of me always love you love you Hey boy where did you get it from? Hey boy where did you go? I learned my passion In the good old fashioned school of lover boys   haha, I cut out the last stanza for fun haha!

      Beatles, The - The Long and Winding Road   The long and winding road That leads to your door Will never disappear I've seen that road before It always leads me here leads me to your door.  The wild and windy night That the rain washed away Has left a pool of tears Crying for the day Why leave me standing here let me know the way.  Many times I've been alone And many times I've cried, Anyway you'll never know The many ways I've tried.  But still they lead me back To the long, winding road You left me standing here A long, long time ago Don't leave me waiting here Lead me to your door.   Awsome song!

      I know I posted this before, but I love it so much!!!  Guess Who - Laughing   I should laugh, but I cry  Because your love has passed me by  You took me by surprise  You didn't realize, that I was waiting...  Time goes slowly but carries on  And now the best years have come and gone  You took me by surprise  I didn't realize, that you were laughing...  Laughing, the things you're doin' to me  Laughing, that ain't the way it should be  You took away everything I had  You put the hurt on me   I go alone now, calling your name  After losing at the game  You took me by surprise  I didn't realize, that you were laughing...

      An awsomely awsome song, here we go:  Our Lay Peace - Made of Steel   I can be anything that you want me to be  A punching bag, a piece of string,  That reminds you not to think      I found the note down in your car  And its not your fault it gets this hard  Gets this hard     Hold your head high  Don't look down  I'm by your side  Won't back down  You wanted a hero tonight     Well I'm not made of steel  I'm not made of steel  But your secrets safe with me     I can be anything that you want me to be  A holy cross, some sympathy, That reminds you not to bleed     I found the note down in your car  And you climbed up here to fall apart  Fall apart         They knock you down  I'll pick you up!! They laugh at you  I'll shut them up!!       But I'm not made of steel  But your secrets safe with me  Yeah  Your secrets safe with me  But yeah  Dedicated to those hard times...Those times that are past...but for some reason decide to come back and haunt us.  And have no purpose...but to strike up some sympathy in you.  But worst of all, makes you scared of the future...  Of what you may do next: Makes you scared that if you do anything...things can turn out  like they did.  What if you even talk? What if you let out a couple words that were never meant to be said? What if you do something that you do all the time...and bang! Something happens.  That shit makes you look over your whole life...makes you...blah! Makes you freaking paranoid!!! What kinda of good comes from that?!?! NOTHING!!!!!  ---------  Makes you sense, eh? :P  HURRAY!

       They knock you down, I'll pick you up! They laugh at you,  I'll Shut them UP!   ----------------------   The key is to not get yourself in such deep hole.  Then it's a hell of a lot easier to just reach up and pull yourself out...but sometimes you just want to dig the hole a lil deeper and see what you'll find...  Then when you find something so beautiful...you don't want to let go of it, then you want to keep on digging until you find something quite as beautiful.  But you never will. You'll find only emptiness, and if you're lucky: Some dog p00p.  Then you give up, but you never noticed how far down that hole you really were.  So now you're stuck.  Waiting for someone to pull you out of that hole. OR If you're really strong, you can climb out of it.  That takes experience and a strong heart.  Sooooo...how do you like my story? It just started off with that first paragraph...then I decided: Hell! why not go all the way! So, Enjoy! haha :P  Have I found something beautiful? Good question, I'll have to check my treasure box :P

Heave they ever seen your pain?

The answer my friend, is blowing in the wind!   Haha...he can turn his head..A LOT! :D haha!  And he needs a whole shit load of ear to hear :P  And YES! All the answers are blowing in the wind.  The ones you may ask God, the ones you may ask life, nature. ANNND the ones you may ask me *laffs*  Everything's blowing in the wind, and don't bother trying to reach out and catch it.  Or even worse, don't bother chasing them. Because, frankly, you aren't going to get any answers...that's the point of the answers blowing in the wind...hahaha! daaamn that's goooood! Damn I love saying that!  ---------------------  Are you saaad? Well, look up, and admire the beautiful of the great blue sky.  How can you not be happy to see such a blessed beauty before your eyes?

       Summer time and the wind is blowing outside In lower Chelsea and I don't know What I'm doing in this city The sun is always in my eyes It crashes through the windows And I'm sleeping on the couch  When I came to visit you That's when I knew I could never have you I knew that before you did Still I'm the one who's stupid   And there's this burning Like there's always been I never been so alone And I've never been so alive  Visions of you on a motorcycle drive by The cigarette ash flies in your eyes And you don't mind, you smile And say the world doesn't fit with you I don't believe you, you're so serene Careening through the universe Your axis on a tilt, you're guiltless and free I hope you take a piece of me with you  And there's things I'd like to do That you don't believe in I would like to build something But you never see it happen  Where's the soul I want to know New York City is evil The surface is everything but I could never do that Someone would see through that  And this is our last time We'll be friends again I'll get over you, you'll wonder who I am   I go home to the coast It starts to rain I paddle out on the water Alone  Taste the salt and taste the pain I'm not thinking of you again Summer dies and swells rise The sun goes down in my eyes See this rolling wave Darkly coming to take me Home And I've never been so alone And I've never been so alive

      Funny:  You know those 'life changing' events?  And how they're supposed to make you a better person, and embrace life! Live life to the fullest!  HAHAHA...now that's in "perfect", like in that commercial...lol  Life changing events...for what I've noticed, for the normal person, like you and me.  It doesn't make you embrace life.  It makes you afraid of life, it makes you know more than you ever wanted to know...  BUT! It is still changes your life :P For the better of for the worse.

      Well, it's a new day.  Let's just hope no surprises coming jumping in my face!!  Now if life had no surprises, that'd be somewhat lovely.  Life's all about if's!!! If this happens, if that doesn't happen!  What happens if I do this...what if I DON'T do this?  Takes too much effort to think about that crap, so just do whatever! Don't think about the if's!! Just do whatever pleasese you!!!  ------------------------   'Cuz I fell in love with the girl at the Rock Show! She said 'What' and I told her that 'I didn't know!' She's so cool!  HAHA!...They're so funny!!  ------------------------  Early November, The - Sunday Drive   And we wait above a road. We're turning to go home. And the silence from the side of the car, Tells me everything and how we are.   Is there no more trying to make this so right. Theres no more trying tonight.    And you know it's not so easy when you're all alone,  And I wonder if, I'm alone in your head.    I know something is wrong,  I just don't know what to do.   You say it's only me, and, that I'm so perfect for you.   I don't want to try no more,  I don't want to make this right.  I just want you to be true to me one time.   Twelve days gone by, since I have saw you last, I'll give this one more try I'll give it all my best, and, I'll ask  What could you be doing that is so much fun? Without me by your side, Without me by your side!! And, I will take a step back, and, I'll let you ahead,  And, I will take a step away, and, see if you come back,  Because there's no more trying to make this so right,  Theres no more trying, Theres no more trying tonight.     We will never be the same, Until you're done.  -----------------------  Hey check this out! It's my long lost love song!! *laffs* Well part of it :P  Ataris, The - Hey Kid!    Bitch, Bitch, Bitch! That's all you ever do. Bitch, bitch, bitch! Your ego will destroy you. Bitch, bitch, bitch! That's all i have to say. Bitch, bitch, bitch! Now i'll just fade away.  Just as long as I act cool Then people will suck up to me. They won't realize that I'm a fake And that's what I'm going to be. A dream and a kid Who changes every day. Someone that has to talk When he's got nothing to say  Bitch, Bitch, Bitch! That's all you ever do. Bitch, bitch, bitch! No one's more punk than you. Bitch, bitch, bitch! Your life is just a trend. Bitch, bitch, bitch! We'll see who's happy in the end.

       When you're on a holiday You can't find the words to say All the things that come to you And I wanna feel it too  On an island in the sun We'll be playing and having fun And it makes me feel so fine I can't control my brain  When you're on a golden sea You don't need no memory Just a place to call your own As we drift into the zone  We'll run away together We'll spend some time forever We'll never feel bad anymore  We'll never feel bad anymore No no We'll never feel bad anymore No no   - Weezer  ----------------------   Don't wanna know how you're feeling I don't care Don't wanna know when you'll meet me I'm not there Don't wanna know why just to wanna know why  When I... breathe in, breathe out. Carry on, carry out. Try to... drive through your life Breathe in, breathe out. Carry on, carry out. Try to... never say goodbye  I wish I knew How to tell you How to tell me why

And if you know me, you should know that I haven't really seen the difference between cute and hot very well...soooo :P  Hotties: Usually have the serious look thing  Cuties: Usually have the smile thing going  Haha..I find that amusing :P  BUt yeah anyways...I guess for me it's still Hot or not Hot...there's no 'cute' *laffs* Fun fun!

        And love It's not the easy thing The only baggage That you can bring Not the easy thing The only baggage you can bring Is all that you can't leave behind   And if the darkness is to keep us apart And if the daylight feels like it's a long way off And if your glass heart should crack Before the second you turn back Oh no, be strong  Walk on  What you got, they can't steal it No they can't even feel it Walk on Stay safe tonight   You're packing a suitcase for a place None of us has been A place that has to be believed To be seen  You could have flown away A singing bird In an open cage Who will only fly Only fly for freedom  Walk on What you got You can't deny it Can't sell it or buy it  Walk on You stay safe tonight And I know it aches How your heart it breaks You can only take so much  Home Hard to know what it is If you never had one  Home I can't say where it is But I know I'm going   Home That's where the heart is  And I know it aches And your heart it breaks You can only take so much Walk on    Leave it behind You've got to leave it behind   [Haha! You wish Bono! You wish!]  I cut out the last part, not that it's bad..just listen to the song! :D BONO IS AWSOME!!! ONE OF THE BEST SINGERS I'D HAVE TO SAY!!!

       I remember low and I remember losing hope I remembe all the feelings And the day they stopped!  - Our Lady Peace  I all too well remember what it felt like... To be so low...helpless, in despair...*sigh*  And why do I think I'm still around here...WHY? Because of my friends! Who are really awsome :] and because of God. Why god you ask? Well let' see...the day I had everything and was on the brink of just...leaving.  Guess what?! It just snows! for the next two days, for no reason! And no one really expected it until like the night before!  And I saw the clouds just rushing in...they were simply bloody fast! It's crazy!  So yeah, now I'm in an alright, which is good.  I can't believe I was actually that low... And I hope that everyone I care about is alright...but I know that isn't the case...but I don't what to do...*sigh*...   Nothing ever seems to last! Can it Last?! Will it last?!

       Just bend the pieces til the FIT! Like they were made for it! BUt they weren't meant for this! NO! They weren't meant fot this!   ------------------------  You know...sometimes I wonder if these lyrics mean anything to me...and the answer..HELL YA! or else why would I like them so much? "Sad songs (say so much)" Elton John  See, songs are...vague, like a secret message!  That's what I love about them, they aren't blunt like me!  So I can use the lyrics to say what I want, but in a way that it's not so obvious...which is good, because then usually only I know what I'm trying to say :P I wish I could come up with some of this stuff, that'd be a good skill to have...  But yeah, I'll leave it up to you to figure out what these things mean...and what I mean :P haha! GOOD LUCK!!!! *Laffs!!*

       Is there anything, Worth looking for? Worth loving for? Worth lying for? Is there anything, Worth waiting for? Worth living for? Worth dying for?    Well then...sometimes 'setting things right' isn't what may be the best thing, believe it or not! Imagine what that could lead to...hmmm NO!  Sorry, but meh.  Sometimes I do things or don't because...I'm scared.  Scared about a few things....afraid that maybe this might happen or not.  And sometimes things that happen is no good.  So all in all I believe sometimes it's best to protect myself! Before things get out of hand :P And hell maybe I'm protecting you too, who knows!  But GUESS WHAT! What we least expect and what we don't want to happen, has a knack of happening anyways...unfortunately.   We pray...We beg,  But everything still happens anyways...   So un-understandable, buuut Hell! I write these to just get shit out, it feels better.  Plus not many people read these so it's all good :P  -------------------   P.S.

       You can't resist her, She's in your bones, She is your marrow And your ride home You can't avoid her She's in the air,  In between molecules Of oxygen and carbon dioxide   Only in dreams We see what it means Reach out our hands Hold on to hers But when we wake It's all been erased And so it seems Only in dreams   You walk up to her Ask her to dance She says, Hey baby I just might take the chance You say, It's a good thing That you float in the air That way there's no way I will crush your pretty Toenails into a thousand pieces.

When the night takes a deep breath And the daylight has no end  If I crawl, if I come crawling home WiIl you be there?   In a little while I will blow by every breeze Friday night running To Sunday on my knees  That girl, that girl! She's mine And I've know her since Since you were a little girl With Spanish eyes Oh, when I saw her In a pram they pushed her by  My, how you've grown Well it's been It's been a little while  Slow down my bleeding heart Man dreams one day to fly A man takes a rocketship into the skys He lives on starlets dying in the night And follows in the trail The scatter of light  Turn it on You turn me on  Slow down my bleeding heart Slowly, slowly love

She said, "You've gotta be crazy, what do you take me for...some kind of easy mark?" You've got wits...you've got looks, you've got passion, but I swear that you've got me all wrong.  but you got me...  I'll be true, I'll be useful I'll be cavalier...I'll be yours my dear and I'll belong to you   If you'll just let me through This is easy as lovers go, So don't complicate it by hesitating And this is wonderful as loving goes, This is taylor made "what's the sense in waiting?"   -----------------------   Once you've got it, you want something else!

       English Distraction thinking   Ha, I was just thinking...looking at things.  Why is it I just don't like some people, and hate others?  Well the hate is I think is mostly just people are how so fagish it really pisses me off.  People I don't like...I don't really like passive people...if you know what I mean? You can tell if someone is passive, no?  Maybe it's because I'm a pretty passive person myself.  But people I like, are people who are 'movers' like they just DO things, for whatever reason! Ya know? I think that's always fun!  Plus they usually aren't afraid to do whatever the hell it is they want...mmm, make sense?   Well! That's my world! :P

       We live, we die  I don’t know the reasons we ask why  We hate, we push  Recent tests show we are all misunderstood   Something’s seizing  You know you lost your mind  You know we all need saving  She found you late last night  You feel the madness gaining  You know you just can’t win  You know this  But I’m just so tired of waking up on the ground  I never knew the girl  And I never knew the world hurt    We beg, we pray  But everything still happens anyway   Something’s teasing  Your conscience can’t decide   She stopped your will from caving  But left you paranoid    You feel the constant straining  She reappears divine  You noticed  But I’m just so tired of waking up all alone

Why speak, when there could be silence!   That's also a bit from Pulp Fiction.  The chick goes on to say something like, it's better to have comfortable silence than to yatter about nothing. And if you find someone who you can share a comfortable silence with; Don't let go of them because they are speial *Shrugs* Just a lil tid bit!

       Turn Turn Turn A time you may embrace, a time to refrain from embracing    To Everything  There is a season  And a time for every purpose, under Heaven  A time to be born, a time to die A time to plant, a time to reap A time to kill, a time to heal  A time to laugh, a time to weep    A time to build up,a time to break down A time to dance, a time to mourn A time to cast away stones, a time to gather stones together  [I think there's only a time to cast away the stones...no need to gather them!]   A time of love, a time of hate  A time of war, a time of peace  A time you may embrace, a time to refrain from embracing  [RIGHT ON! I really like that line actually...]  A time to gain, a time to lose A time to rend, a time to sew A time to love, a time to hate A time for peace, I swear it's not too late  - The Byrds

      If that made sense..congratz! we've got something on common *laffs*  But yeah where did this come from? GOod question, probably won't be answered though :P la la!

      I must say this,   Is it better to spread your love around?  OR Keep it Tight and strong?  I like to do the latter, why?  I believe in keeping few, but AWSOMELY GOOD FRIENDS!  That care for the ones that matter to me, and not feel like I'm stringed out..does that make sense?  Have no doubt though! I you all are awsome! I'd spill my heart for you guys!  SO yeah...that's one reason I like to keep things as 'tight' as possible  The other reason...waaaaait can you guess? I probably said it before, no? Ok anyways I just feel like blogging.   Simple fact: Less people you care about, the less likely you're gonna get hurt. Because of another simple fact.  It's the people and things you care about, that hurt you the most.

How eveything just happened to end up like this? So beautiful?  Why isn't everything all ugly and shit? Why is nature so beautiful? Why isn't eveything grey and dull and crap?  Do you know where I'm going with this? Well just think about it.

       Moving On -------------  Something to realize, which lightened up my heart: It's okay to move on!  There is a time to grieve and a time to live. What's done is done, right? There is nothing left to grieve.  You don't have to remain in constant sadness.  You don't have to be sad to protect yourself, to prevent something from happening. You don't have to remain sad to show that you cared.  You can live on! Really, it does not matter what went past, that's freaking gone!  You may remember it, acknowledge it, But there is absolutely NO point in meddling around in sadness of the past; when there is so much happiness right in front of you!  Here's a song to express what I'm trying to say better:   Eagles, The - Desperado     Desperado, why don’t you come to your senses  You been out ridin’ fences for so long now   Oh you’re a hard one   I know that you got your reasons   These things that are pleasin' you  Can hurt you somehow   Don’t you draw the queen of diamonds boy  She’ll beat you if she’s able  You know the queen of heats is always your best bet    Now it seems to me some fine things  Have been laid upon your table  But you only want the ones that you can’t get   [SO true!]  Desperado, oh you ain’t gettin' no younger  Your pain and your hunge’ they’re drivin’ you home  And freedom, oh freedom well that’s just some people talkin’  Your prison is walking through this world all alone   Don’t your feet get cold in the winter time  The sky won’t snow and the sun won’t shine  It’s hard to tell the night time from the day   You’re loosin’ all your highs and lows  Ain’t it funny how the feeling goes away   [haha, ya! ...I thought they'd never go away...but they do!]  Desperado, why don’t you come to your senses  Come down from your fences open the gate  It may be rainin’ but there’s a rainbow above you  You better let somebody love you before it’s too late You better let somebody love you....before it’s too late   ASK AND I SEND! IT'S SUCH A BEAUTIFUL SONG!!!!  --------------  YOu know what I just realized my title for the blog is almost the same title for...Billy Joel - Moving Out!! Great song too! :P

       READ CELINA'S BLOG!   I have to agree with that, buuuut!  Sometimes...you just feel you need to take the risk because one of these days, you never know maybe you'll hit the jackpot.  But like ME (or hopefully), some people won't take the risk and will not feel anymore pain from that stuff! Good, eh?  Lonliness is a good thing!

       And all the words I've given to you When you smiled, I thought that it meant something else You were just being yourself, being nice,  You're always rather polite to me!  I've never fell so far for anyone so far  Never again I swore   - Vroom  Can that promise be kept? I dunno...I sure hope so...unless I am very very sure you know? Oh! I forgot the last part!  With you hope was restored You make me feel like I've been torn apart  ...  Decisions

      Haha...you know what I realized... I'm living a very sad life.  And it's took someone to say something very simple for that realization...  But I don't know what do...I'm scared, I really am.  But I want to do so many things, but I don't know if it's a good thing to do... I just think...I just wonder how things will be.  What happens if I do somethings? and things change...  But then I can always just do nothing and live this sad life...  I can't decide.  I can't choose... What path...if there even is a path to take...  I feel lost.  I can never see the future...I never know what's right to do... I never do what's right...so why not try out another 'wrong'?

      ok SERIOUSLY!! Don't want to be cruel or something and tell you to shut up, but... I really don't need to know the details of your sex life!!!  Like uhhh, thanks for telling me that, but I really don't need the intimate details... DO you think I would actually enjoy hearing about that? And discussing it? uhh, NO!  psh!  Some info's ok, but you should know what to leave out... trying to erupt some kinda jealousy or some sort? uhhh...Kinda past that! All things end the same way -- HORRIBLY! so I'm not jealous, just kinda "wtf?!"

      Haha...I dunno.  Things just feel weird...too many conflicting emotions! Rationality! It's all so very crazy.  One can only do so much, but one can never do enough...  Is there a point in doing 'so much'? Or is that 'so much' really meaningful? or not? haha...  Life's funny...It's all about missing those opportunities!!! hahaha... :P  The Name of the Game!!!

      I really do confuse myself...I really do contradict(Ooooooo contradictions! haha....) myself in my thoughts and actions...  I really want to do something, but I don't because I know it's right, then I feel happy. But when opportunity knocks...I feel so tempted, but it's not...right....then I feel sad because I don't know if I didn't the right thing...  I thought I could run away from some things...but you can't  Some stay there, and will never leave...  ----  Here's a song I just want to tag on:  Blink 182 - Stay Together for the Kids    Its hard to wake up, when the shades have been pulled shut. This house is haunted, its so pathetic,  It makes no sense at all.  Im ripe with things to say, the words rot and fall away. No stupid poem could fix this home, I'd read it every day.   So heres your holiday Hope you, enjoy this time. You Gave it all away. It was mine. So when your penis is dead and gone, will you remember this night. Twenty years now lost,  It's not right.   Their anger hurts my ears - been running strong for seven years.  Rather then fix the problem, they never solve them, it makes no sense at all.  I see them everyday - we get along so why can't they?  If this is what he wants, and its what she wants, then whys there so much pain?    It's not right.

      When I look at what I do, and why I do it...I just have to ask myself...:  Can I ever truly protect myself? Am I fooling myself...is it impossible? Is there a hidden reason I do not wish to uncover?  And finally...maybe the most important:  Is this what I really need?  haha...these questions shall be anwswered in time! I shall find out if I've been wasting my time, or if I've been on the right track.  That's what life's about, eh? :P  No regrets  ...Yeah right! *rolls eyes*  *sigh* I do have to admit though, I do miss...(it) How amusing, eh? Of my own doing :P lovely.  Here's  song that really fits me and this blog... (already put up, but it just seems 'right', right now) Whiskeytown - Don't wanna know why     Don't wanna know why you like me, I don't care... Don't wanna know why I walk by and you stare Don't wanna know why just to wanna know why   When I... breathe in, breathe out.  Carry on, carry out. Try to... drive through your life  Breathe in, breathe out.  Carry on, carry out. Try to... never say goodbye    Don't wanna know how you're feeling, I don't care  Don't wanna know when you'll meet me I'm not there Don't wanna know why just to wanna know why   I wish I knew How to tell you How to tell me why    This is a beautiful song...kinda slowish melody, so good :D

      mmm, I like the word 'sometimes' It's...so indefinite! I love it! And Ash has a song called sometimes too, sooo :P   Cigarettes keep you skinny And your mind off your weight   Anyways! Yeah 'Sometimes', here are some:  Sometimes you hate...because you care too much Sometimes you love...because you can't help it. Sometimes you cast away love...because you know you can't hold on Sometimes you turn a cold shoulder...because you are afraid of what turning a warm smile may do Sometimes you supress your wants...because you know your wants will only cause pain Sometimes you feel helpless...because you are, and you care too much Sometimes you do what you need to...because in the end, you feel great about it (which leads me to wonder what's better? Feel like crap first, then feel good later: or :Feel 'Just like Heaven[The Cure]' then feel like crap?) Sometimes you let your feelings take over...because we're you're only human  Sometimes life gets us down... BUT  the ones who care about us are always there to lift us back up!! :D   And that's where your priorities should be, I think, to repay and give all you can to those who have been by your side, fighting off life, picking you up, shutting them up :D :D  Things go alright, which is more than good :D haha!  P.S. Yeah...those 'sometimes' things I just shot out, most of those you's are more like 'I am' or 'I' But it just sounds too personal and too directly linked to me...if that makes any sense, haha! :P  Ok, well here's a song that's says something that is slowly creeping into MY life...unfortunately, or fortunately? Who knows. Am I ignorant now or before? Who knows.  Dashboard Confessional - The Places You have come to Fear the Most    Buried deep as you can dig inside yourself,  And covered with a perfect shell,  Such a charming beautiful exterior. Laced with brilliant smiles and shining eyes Perfect posture but you're barely scraping by But you’re barely scraping by  This is one time,  That you can't fake it hard enough to please everyone or anyone at all.   And the grave that you refuse to leave  The refuge that you've built to flee The places you have come to fear the most.   [That's kinda what's creeping up...*shrugs*]  Such a stellar monument to loneliness.  Laced with brilliant smiles and shining eyes  And perfect makeup but you're barely scraping by. But you’re barely scraping by   So yeah, basically the chorus is the biggy  The place I have built to take me away from where I was, is now a curse.  It's not working out the way I wish it had, maybe this is my lesson? the hard way.  Been at two extremes...where is the middle ground? Can I find it?  But I'm too afraid to leave this place I have built, I don't know anything else now.  What if there is nothing better outside these walls I have built? What if I stumble into another abyss?    I'm just too scared, so why bother doing anything? We live, and we die.  Simple.  We live, we die But I don't understand the reasons we ask "Why?"

      Ok here's my second theme...YEAH! WEEZER AGAIN! GEEK ROCK! HAHAHAHA!!! I know you love it!     When I look in the mirror I can't believe what I see Tell me, who's that funky dude Staring back at me   Broken, beaten down Can't even get around Without an old-man cane I fall and hit the ground Shivering in the cold I'm bitter and alone    Excuse the bitching I shouldn't complain I should have no feeling Cos feeling is pain  As everything I need Is denied me And everything I want Is taken away from me  But who do I got to blame? Nobody but me!!!    And I don't wanna be an old man anymore It's been a year or two since I was out on the floor Shaking booty, making sweet love all the night  It's time I got back to the good life It's time I got back, it's time I got back And I don't even know how I got off the track I wanna go back, yeah!   Screw this crap, I've had it! I ain't no Mr. Cool  I'm a pig, I'm a dog So excuse me if I drool  I ain't gonna hurt nobody Ain't gonna cause a scene Just need to admit That I want sugar in my tea Hear me (hear me) I want sugar in my tea!    I love this song!!! YES YES YES!!! You love it too! I know you do! it's so funky you cant' say no!!! :D haha!

      Ok time for some music...talk later, music now!!! Three songs coming up: Beatles, Jimmy Eat World, Bouncing Souls  Well actually, let's start off with some Dashboard Confessional:  I'm reading your note,  Over again And there's not a word that I comprehend, expect When you signed it,   "I'll love you always, forever..."  Yes...forever is a nice thing, is there such thing?  -------    Can’t buy me love! Can’t buy me love  I’ll buy you a diamond ring, my friend, if it makes you feel alright! I’ll get you anything my friend if it makes you feel alright!! ’cause I don’t care too much for money, money can’t buy me love!!  I’ll give you all I got to give if you say you love me, too! I may not have a lot to give but what I got I’ll give to you I don’t care too much for money, money can’t buy me love  Can’t buy me love, everybody tells me so!  Say you don’t need no diamond ring and I’ll be satisfied :D Tell me that you want the kind of thing that money just can’t buy I don’t care too much for money, money can’t buy me love     - Can't buy me Love YES! Now this is a me song! hahaha, Beatles are awsome!! I love this song :D Reminds me of good old days!! How about some good new days? haha I CONTRADICT SOCIETY!!! :D  And YES, boys and girls, money CAN'T buy you love!  -------     We're lowering the standard in a process selective.  The formulas to thin.  But it takes more than one person.  So everyone jump on.    I'll miss you when you're just like them.  I remember back then thinking:  Easy comes but doesn't stay, what comes easy never stays.      - Jimmy Eat World  --------    I wanna make you know I can do everything, but I don't ever show you How I really am  I wish I could say I have no regrets I wanted too much from you  I don't wanna be this way I kick myself I wish I could say that I have no regrets today   - Bouncing Souls  --------

        Who am I?   Now that is the ultimate question...if you can answer that, truthfully and in complete confidence, you're well on your way to a great life!  But, unfortunately, it can be a lil difficult to truly know...I think we go through our lives, always changing, it's ok the change It's ok to modifiy your values, your beliefs.  What matters is how we feel about it NOW, not how we felt about it in the past. I guess I shall just do whatever feels right and I have confidence in...  If what I'm going to do doesn't feel right  OR  I don't have any confidence in it... It must not come to pass! I must not act! haha!  ALright, there's my morning tid-bits :P

      Haha! I'm sitting here reading some old surveys...they're freaking funny! haha I think I'm going to choke on my apples and hurt my stomach :( tis sore! haha!  ----  uh, here's a song by Hayden, I doubt any of you will like him, but his lyrics are pretty damned good. Somewhere along the line of Dashboard Confessional... deep   Hayden - Carried Away   Don't be scared to leave him  You've been sad all season  You should think of something to say.   Maybe you could tell him  That from the day you met him  You've been liking him less and less.  Things have got to change  'Cause if they stay the same  You'll both get carried away.   He might really love you  And be crushed by the news  And you can take back everything you said   And if he feels the same way --  Has been waiting to say  The same things but on a different day   You'll go your separate ways  And all your days with him will fade --  Be carried away.   Haha...for people who like CHICKFLICKS Hayden - Skates lyrics are somewhat sad, and perfect for a chickflick movie, haha! :P

      Do you feel it coming? I do!  It feels like it's about a good time to look at one's self again.  Well maybe before Gr.11, eh? Then I'll be ready to take on anything! haha! Hopefully...   Hopefully I can be a tad stronger when it comes to some things.  Hopefully I can be a tad braver when it comes to some things. Hopefully I will not repeat the past. Hopefully I can keep some of those long over due promises. Hopefully I won't make any other promises that I can't keep Hopefully I will bring no more sadness and hurt into the world! & Hopefully none of that hurt shall come to me...hopefully That'll be the day...Hopefully    No more sadness, no more sorrow, no more bad times  Good times, good times, everybody walkin’ by the river now  - Guess Who, The

      Ok, here goes my last song of the day song:  Something Corporate - Hurricane   Shake down you make me break  For goodness sake I think I'm on the edge Of something new with you  Shout out don't drown the sound I'll drown you out  You'll never screan so loud As I want to scream with you   [SCREEEEAAAMMM!!!]   Standing there with your smile blinding Your eyes from seeing  My face as I'm dying To figure out a girl But she drifts so far away I'm on her coast So maybe I should stay And map around your world   Stand up don't make a sound Your ears might bleed There are sweet flourescent enemies That live inside me The world moves faster than I knew  Not fast enough to not creep up on you And the space we put between  So pull me under your weather patterns   Your cold fronts and the rain don't matter Because a sun burn's what I needed    [Funky easy pianoy part!]   You don't do it on purpose  But you make me shake Now I count the hours 'til you wake With your babies breath Breathe symphonies Come on sweet catastrophe!!   [That's right punk!]    Well, maybe this time I can follow through  I can feel complete Stop paying dues  Stop the rain from falling Keep my ocean calm  This time I know nothings wrong   [Because there's nothign to make wrong! haha damn I'm goood!]

      This is a very interesting song, used to be one of my favourite!!! Back in the day, haha  In the car, I just cant wait To pick you up on our very first date Is it cool if I hold your hand? Is it wrong if I think its lame to dance? Do you like my stupid hair? Would you guess that I didnt know what to wear? I'm just scared of what you think you make me nervous so I really cant eat!  Let's Go! Dont wait! This nights almost over! Honest....Let's make this night last forever Forever!and Ever! Lets make this last forever  When you smile, I melt inside I'm not worthy for a minute of your time I really wish it was only me and you I'm jealous of everbody in the room Please dont look at me with those eyes Please dont hint that your capable of lies I dread a thought of our very first kiss A target that I'm probably gonna miss   Ok here's a song..HAHAHA  WE CAN WORK IT OUT!!!!!! HAHAHA lol!  Beatles, The - We can work it out  Try to see it my way Do I have to keep on talking till I can't go on? While you see it your way Run the risk of knowing that our love may soon be gone  We can work it out Think of what you're saying You can get it wrong And still you think that it's all right  Think of what I'm saying We can work it out and get it straight or say goodnight  Life is very short and there's no time for fussing and fighting, my friend  I have always thought  that it's a crime So I will ask you once again:  Try to see it my way Only time will tell if I am right or wrong While you see it your way There's a chance that we might fall apart Before too long  We can work it out...   haha, how sad...*sniff* hahaha!

      Ok, gotta put this jokin' song up! So funny!  Offspring, The - She's got Issues    Just might be out of her mind Well she's got baggage and it's all the emotional kind She talks about closure and that validation bit  I don't mean to be insensitive, but I really hate that shit   Oh man she's got issues And I'm gonna pay She thinks she's the victim  Now I know she'll feel abandoned If I don't stay over late  And I know she's afraid to commit But it's only our second date    I don't know why you're messed up I don't know why your whole life is a chore  Just do me a favor And check your baggage at the door  Now she talks about her ex nonstop, but I don't mind  But when she calls out his name in bed That's where I draw the line  You told me a hundred times how your father left and he's gone  But I wish you wouldn't call me daddy When we're gettin' it on   If you think I'm controlling Then why do you follow me around If you're not co-dependent Then why do you let others drag you down   Don't you think this song is so amusing! haha it's great to listen to! A nice laugh!

      This is a great song!  Mary Wells - You beat me to the Punch   That day, I first saw you passing by   I wanted, to ask your name but I...was much too shy  But I was looking at you so hard   That you must have had a hunch.  So you came up to me and asked me my name.    You beat me to the punch  That time  You beat me to the punch  Yes you did.    After, I had known you for what seems like a long, long time   I wanted, wanted to ask you would you please, please be mine  Whenever you came around, my heart would pound  So you must have had a hunch.  So you came up to me and asked me to be yours.     Since I loved you  I thought you would be true  And love me tender  So I let my heart surrender  To you, yes I did.  But I found out  Beyond a doubt   One day, boy  You were a playboy  Who would go away and leave me  Blue.    So I ain't gonna wait around for you to put me down  This time I'm gonna play my hunch   And walk away this very day.   And beat you to the punch  Yes I will  I'll beat you to the punch  This time.

      Well here's something I came up with: Urges --> What should be done  To hold someone --> Hold yourself To hold a hand --> Hold your own hand To (fall in)love --> Smack yourself; Turn your back & Run away before you fall too hard!  Kill --> Go right ahead! Run away --> Preferable if you kill someone Die --> Why the hell not?  Our Lady Peace - Naveed  And for you particularly should we let a young man die?  Let him die if he wants to! I can't live here anymore  It's hard when you reach for that floor and  And there's something that tears me inside, so I can't go   I'll have to try once again, I'll have to try when I want to   There he's on his knees again  Trying hard to understand  Why Naveed would let a young man die  Convinced that he might break he reaches for that phone  And then another day has gone... Another day is gone...

      My heart aches.  There are some things that you simply cannot avoid feeling; no matter how hard you try. Just try not to act upon 'em too much :P   I tried to laugh about it Cover it up with lies I tried to laugh about it Hiding my tears in my eyes Cuz boys don't cry...  - The Cure  ----  Ok I don't really know what I'm doing right now...I'm doing almost exactly what I used to do...which is not good at all...  I must slap myself! I must sort out my head! I must slice my heart! It deserves no better!!! I need a distraction...I need to sleep soon. I think I might just snap.  ------  Ok, last thing for today:  To everyone he meets,  He stays a stranger!  Ok, that's actually really good, even though it's a playful song.  Stay a stranger.  That's as close as one should get.  I'm not perfect, mistakes have been made.  We shall learn from our mistakes. :]

       I want to read good new! But nothing good is happening!  - Something Corporate  You want to read some good news? Well here is some!!! I'm semi-happy!!! :P (Semi-charmed Life!!!)  Haha...holding out, and following my advice/theories seems to have worked out this time...which will lead me to continue my life as is! And what may those theories be? Well let's see, how to put it simlpy...  RUN AWAY BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE!!! DON'T LET YOUR HEART GUIDE YOU! ANNND!! Keep up that fake smile! Pretend your happy! Then you'll die 'happy'!! :P Or else you'll have to deal with too much crap!  Yeah...that's what I do, and that's what has kept me here, alive, and well.  Everything just works out nicely..see if I didn't do what I promised myself etc, then things would probably be very different, Thank god that's not true!!   So yeah, now I'm kinda happy because I what I'm doing is right and works out just fine for me! How do I know that it's working out? I'm not crying.  WeeeeEEEEeeee!!!  ------  Being alone can be sad and lonely sometimes.  Sometimes you just wanna...well yeah do things, you just want to feel that 'happiness' again. Then you look at yourself right now, and see, "hey, I guess I'm kinda happy, things are alright!" So that's always good.  But, seriously, what other options do you have? At least being alone does have some very good advantages...such as...it won't break you, you won't have much to care about...hmmm lots more!  I was just looking at a post I made...in January or so...  The things that hurt you the most Are the things you care about the most  How stupid is that?  SOLUTION! Don't care much about anything!!! Hahaha...la la la This isn't making sense...but makes sense to me! yah! That's all that matters :P  One day, I'm going to look back at all of these and see how dumb I was, and how many years I have wasted...but better to waste the years, rather than crying your years away! (Pretty slick, eh? :P)  ---------  I'm just blabbing because...I need somewhere to record my thoughts and yeah not really many people read this, and you think about a lot of stuff when you walk, so yeah!  --------  Hey since I'm happy..I won't feel bad to: "CLean" Derrick's MSN list!!!   :D Bring it!!! haha!

I'll tell you something, I think you'll understand, When I say that something; I Want to Hold Your Hand!!  Ok here's the CLUE! ....The Beatles!! And..the answer's in the excerpt :P (look what comm did do to me!!!)   ---  Ok, try this one, it's not the Beatles though!! It has the word 'flowers' in the band name..GUESS!   The only difference, That I see, Is you are exactly the same As you used to be!

      Ok I promise, last lyrics for today...  This song is so awsome!! I love it! Just has some stuff cut out, so no need to bold :P The goods are right here!! :P  Whiskeytown - Under your Breath   Sometimes I wish I were deaf Then I wouldn't hear the words you say Under your breath  Anything that you put on me All the things your head needs, You believe Read my mind 'Cause I can't say anything The sick heart potion Two parts pain One part true again

      Ok here goes another Dashboard Confessional song that I love:  Again I go Unnoticed   So quiet.  Another wasted night.  The television steals the conversation.  Exhale.   Another wasted breath  Again it goes unnoticed.    Please tell me you're just feeling tired,  'Cause if it's more than that I feel that I might break.   Out of touch. Out of time.   Please send me anything but signals that are mixed,  'Cause I can't read your rolling eyes.  Out of touch. Are we out of time?   Closed lipped.   Another goodnight kiss  Is robbed of all it's passion.  Your grip.  Another time is slack  It leaves me feeling empty.    I'll wait until tomorrow.  Maybe you'll feel better then,  Mmaybe we'll be better then.  So what's another day?   When I can't bear these nights of thoughts of going on without you?   This mood of yours is temporary.   It seems worth the wait to see you smile again.  Out of the corner of your eye  won't be the only way you're looking at me then.     AND, the bolded parts are the...BIG MEANING parts! *gasp* HAHA! Or just parts that are nice, or well sung :D IT's all goooood!  ---------   You almsot always pick the best times, To drop the worst lines You almost made me cry this time  Well this time I'm not going to watch myself die I buried myself aive on the inside So I could shut you out And let you go away for a long time   I guess it's ok I puked the day away I guess it's better you trapped yourself in your own way And if you want me back You're gonna have to ask Nicer than that   With my foot on your neck,  I finally have you,  Right where I want you!    Guess....:P  --------------  Guess what..this song is! mmm, I love blockquotes :P  I would say "I'm sorry" if I thought that it would change your mind But I know that this time  I have said too much, been too unkind I tried to laugh about it Covered it all up with lies   Funky-sad-true-ish song :P Makes it worth my while *laffs*  -------------  haha..it took me like a day to realize that I can walk and walk and walk and it doesn't really do anything now! Hurray! I'm going to walk to the Nort Pole and meet Santa!  Well, it could very well be that.... When you've got things on your mind, nothing else seems to really matter, you're just a void in space, floating around...what a feeling, eh? :P

      Now, it's long over due since I posted up my Blog's theme song... Though it meant something else when I made the blog...IT'S A FREAKING FUNKY SONG!!!  Weezer - Why Bother   I know I should get next to you You got a look that makes me think you're cool  But it's just sexual attraction Not something real so I'd rather keep wackin'!    Why bother? it's gonna hurt me It's gonna kill when you desert me  This happened to me twice before It won't happen to me anymore!  I've known a lotta girls before What's the harm in knowin' one more? Maybe we could even get together Maybe you could break my heart next summer   [Funny man!]     It's a cryin' shame I'm all alone  Not with you, nor her, nor anyone Won't you knock me on my head  Crack it open let me outta here     [Haha! I like it!]   Btw, it's a short song, just barely two minutes, so easy to downalod :P  --------  Here's a lil thing from Weezer:  I'm dumb, she's a lesbian! I thought I had found the one...

      Things go up, things go down. And when things go down, well, you get stressed eh?  Stress relieving tip:  Take a long ass walk. Soak up the scenes, feels great.  It's just you and the world!   Speaking of tips, here's one by Neil Diamond  First they say they want you, Then say how they really need you, Suddenly you find you're out there Walking in a storm!  And when they know they have you,  Then they really have you; Nothing you can do, or say, You've got to leave! Just get away!

      Ok...I don't understand why some people have to fuck up someone else's life so much...don't they fucking see what they're doing?!?!  LIKE, HOLY SHIT! what do you think that is going to get you... DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND THAT...IT'S FUCKIGN OVER!!! FINISHED! GO HOME!!!!  Damn it! Piss me off so much...  If you're life is that fucked up...dont' bother going over to fuck up someone else's life!!! Especially if you 'care' for them. Liek WTF! If you really care for them...why are you saying this? Don't you realize what you are saying only causes pain? Not out of love, but out of pure sympathy and guilt!!!  IS that what you want for the one you 'love/care for'?  Personally, I think you're a fucking dip shit, cock sucking, prick fuck!  Ok that was the rant, here goes the main thingys..haha:  ------  Ok, if you really feel that way...why are you saying this? Just tell me that...why are you saying this stuff?!?! Where do you think it'll get you? Let's see...it'll hurt you...it'll hurt the ones you love OH! that's just freaking great, eh?  So why exactly are you saying this? To strike up...some guilt?  You think you're the only one who's lost something, and really want it back?  Well you're not! If you really want that back...this isn't the way to to do. Seriously, go off and start something new! (If you want to take the risk, but you know, that's another whole topic on it's own) So yeah, if you really care for them...SAY NOTHING!!!  So Get Over This!! MOVE ON! and GO HOME!!!!   -------  Ok that's repetitive, but I do that when I'm pissed off.  Well here's a good song to compliment that thought:  Jimmy Eat World - Your House   When you're on...I swear, you're on You rip my heart right out  I think the whole room can hear me clear my throat You rip my heart right out   If you still care at all, don't go tell me now If you love me at all...  Don't call   Then out of no where, You put me right back there You rip my heart right out  And we know what happens When we get to your house You rip my heart right out   If you still care at all, Don't go tell me now If you love me at all, Please don't tell me now If you still care at all, Don't go tell me now If you love me at all...  Don't call   I throw away everything I've written you  Anything just keep my mind from Thinking how I had you once No, I can't forget that Sometimes I wish I could lose you again   Your winning me over with everything you say You rip my heart right out When I let you closer, I only want you closer You rip my heart right out

       Where does your Heart Lie?  ----------------- Here's a great great purely great song! By the Emotions! Some Oldies, Decide! Emotions! or Foundations! hahaha  Emotions, The - Best of My Love     Doesn't take much to make me happy! and make me smile with glee,  Never, never will I feel discouraged Cause our love's no mystery  Demonstrating love and affection That you give so openly yeah  I like the way ya make me about you baby Want the whole wide world to see  Whoa whoa, you've got the best of my love Whoa whoa, you've got the best of my love Whoa whoa, you've got the best of my love  Goin' in and out of changes The kind that come around each day My life has a better meaning Love has kissed me in a beautiful way My Love! My Love!  Oh you got the best of my love  Demonstrating sweet love and affection That you give so openly yeah The way I feel about ya baby can't explain it Want the whole wide world to see  But in my heart You're all I need You for me and me for you It's growin' every day    Ohhh, givin' you the best of my love  my love ohh my love  You've got the best of My Love     -----------------  Well like that song said:   All we seem to know is how to show the feelings that are wrong  That begs the question! Should we show those wrong feelings? And let things get complicated and take that chance OR Just leave them locked up in that box? Leave things simple as they are, always wondering...  It's actually always the same freaking stupid question, just in a little bit of a different form...which is annoying...>:{  I dunno, but I think almost everyone likes to keep things simple.  So let's just leave those feeling be? :P That's how it's been and that's how it'll always be!  (That's the right attitude Derrick! Keep on being stupid!)  haha...

       All we seem to know is how to show the feelings that are wrong  Screw it! haha! We were never exactly smart... :P  ----  Haha, I never noticed how good these lyrics are! They really hit home now:  Gloria Gaynor - I Will Survive     First I was afraid, I was petrified! Kept thinking I could never live without you by my side But I spent so many nights thinking how you did me wrong I grew strong I learned how to get along!  And so you're back from outer space I just walked in to find you here with that sad look upon your face I should have changed my stupid lock I should have made you leave your key If I had known for just one second you'd be back to bother me  Go on now go walk out the door just turn around now 'cause you're not welcome anymore weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye  You think I'd crumble You think I'd lay down and die Oh no, not I!! I will survive! as long as i know how to love I know I will stay alive I've got all my life to live I've got all my love to give and I'll survive I will survive    It took all the strength I had not to fall apart kept trying hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart and I spent oh so many nights just feeling sorry for myself I used to cry  Now I hold my head up high! and you see me somebody new I'm not that chained up little person still in love with you and so you felt like dropping in and just expect me to be free  now I'm saving all my loving for someone who's loving me

      Here's some Johnny Cash:  Johnny Cash - I'm so Lonesome I Could Cry    Hear that lonesome whippoorwill? He sounds too blue to fly. The midnight train is whining low:  I'm so lonesome I could cry.  I've never seen a night so long, When time goes crawling by. The moon just went behind a cloud, To hide its face and cry.  Did you ever see a Robin weep, When leaves begin to die? That means he's lost his will to live. I'm so lonesome I could cry.  The silence of a falling star,  Lights up a purple sky. And as I wonder where you are, I'm so lonesome I could cry. I'm so lonesome I could cry.

       I feeeel Gooooood!  Thank you thank you! James Brown everyone!! *Claps* *thinks what song to put up now* haha!  Here's a superb song! It's a nice slow-ish oldies gooood stuff!!  Terry Jacks - Seasons in the Sun    Goodbye to you, my trusted friend. We've known each other since we're nine or ten. Together we climbed hills or trees. Learned of love and ABC's, skinned our hearts and skinned our knees.  Goodbye my friend, it's hard to die, when all the birds are singing in the sky, Now that the spring is in the air. Pretty girls are everywhere.  When you see them I'll be there. We had joy, we had fun, we had seasons in the sun. But the hills that we climbed were just seasons out of time.  Goodbye, Papa, please pray for me, I was the black sheep of the family. You tried to teach me right from wrong. Too much wine and too much song, wonder how I get along.  Goodbye, Papa, it's hard to die when all the birds are singing in the sky, Now that the spring is in the air. Little children everywhere.  Goodbye, Michelle, my little one. You gave me love and helped me find the sun.  And every time that I was down you would always come around and get my feet back on the ground.   Goodbye, Michelle, it's hard to die when all the bird are singing in the sky, Now that the spring is in the air. With the flowers everywhere. I wish that we could both be there. We had joy, we had fun, we had seasons in the sun. But the stars we could reach were just starfishs on the beach

       Meet me on the South Beach, my 'lil Georgia Peach!  Wow...it's been so long!!!  Time to catch up! I have so many things to say! I probably forgot most...hopefully not the important parts :P    This will be a bunch of rambling that I was thinking about over my holiday. So it'll be scattered and stuff.  I found that leaving every social scene, it really helps you relax.  Helps you think.  Throughout the whole time, I was missing...And I longed to return!  It was like...I was reliving something! Amazing!  I was watchign Along came Polly and the guy's dad said something to the effect that " Something good can pass us by when we least exepected it.  No matter how hard we tried to prepare for it " Now that's pretty good!  And I wonder...I just wonder, has something good passed me by? Or is it still not too late? That is for time to see!!  hmmm, ok next "topic"  This is a kind of weird thing I thought of and felt...It's probably something only I would think of or feel...very strange :P But here it goooeees!  Ok,getting over a person is one thing.  It can be very hard...but we do eventually in one way or another... The next step (for me) was even harder...: The fact that we feel(no matter what), and we do fall in love(even thought it is probably one of the stupidest things ever).  And this love drives our lives in some way or another, and I guess it's kinda important to acknowledge it, rather than shun it and let it eat at you. It's more hurtful to force loneliness upon yourself than to embrace a love...I guess that's what I'm trying to say...  So these walls...I wonder if they do more harm than good...We can't stop our heart from feeling, so why shut it off?  Another movie I watched...Laws of Attraction, hahaha...but they had a statistic that I'm not sure is right or not, but is interesting:  80% of women who say they are too busy to have a relationship are actually lonely  Also in that movie...it kinda also speaks the point I just made, haha, I swear I thought about that long before I watched it!!  You can't walk away from love  -------  Also, I've been stealing songs from my brother and found some pretty good ones, you guys might like them...who knows! haha!  This one's is indie rock I think, I really like them!  Lightning Seeds - Pure   Night time slows Raindrops splash rainbows Perhaps someone you know Could sparkle and shine  As daydreams slide To color from shadow Picture the moonglow That dazzles my eyes  And I... Love you! Just lying, smiling in the dark  Shooting stars around your heart Dreams come bouncing in your head Pure and simple every time!  Now you’re crying in your sleep I wish you’d never learnt to weep Don’t sell the dreams, you should be keeping Pure and simple every time    Dream of sights Of sleigh rides in seasons Where feelings, not reasons Can make you decide  As leaves pour down Splash autumn on gardens As colder nights harden Their moonlit delights   Look at me with starry eyes Push me up to starry skies  There’s stardust in my head Pure and simple every time Fresh and deep as oceans new  Shiver at the sight of you I’ll sing a softer tune Pure and simple over you    If love’s the truth, then look no lies  [Very nice Line!!]  And let me swim around your eyes I’ve found a place I’ll never leave Shut my mouth and just believe  Love is the truth, I realize Not a stream of pretty lies To use us up And waste our time   Pure and simple over you Pure and simple just for you    Hahaha something I just remembered I was listening to a lil jazz, and this person made a cover on a pop song, but forgot the lyrics mid way through and just made up her own ahahahaha, she was like "What was the chorus to this song? I forgot it...I just know it was sweet etc" hahaha fun stuff!  The next one is pretty funky I like a certain line...guess it! the answer's at the bottom :P I don't know if these guys were popular or not...but who cares! hahahaha I don't listen to the radio much...so it doesn't quite strike me as over used  Refreshments - Banditos    Just how far down do you want to go We can talk it out over a cup of joe  And you can look deep in my eyes Like I was a super-model   It’s just you and me baby No one else we can trust We’ll say nuthin to no one No how or we’ll bust Never crack a smile, or flinch, or cry For nobody  So give you ID card to the border guard  Your alias says you captain John Luke Picard Of the United Federation of Planets Cause they won’t speak english any ways    Everybody knows that the world is full of stupid people  So meet me at the mission at midnight We’ll divvy up there  Everybody knows that the world is full of stupid people So I got the pistol So I get the pesos  That seems fair!  We’ll put the sugar in the tank of the sheriff’s car We’ll slash the deputy’s tires They won’t get very far When they finally get the word that there’s been a hold-up    Everyboy knows that the world is full of stupid people! I got the pistol, so I get the pesos!!  More shall come! and other stuff too! I haven't had a chance to listen to all this 'new' stuff yet!  Oh and any oldie fans...Trooper!!! Boys in the bright white sports car!!! ahahah I love it!!! lates!!!
