						   I'm so tired. Brian and I eneded up having a "discussion" until 3:30am I'm at work trying to keep my brain functioning with only 2.5 hours of sleep and am failing miserably. I'm not in the best of moods otherwise either since the "discussion" is practically a repeat of the one 3 weeks ago which means that I pour my heart out, and doesn't even register for a month. I've been trying to say the same thing in different ways at least every other month for 10 years and I'm just explained out... If I have to have this conversation with him again, I think I'll just implode.

						   Amanda is getting so sick.. She missed school yesterday and today she had to come home twice! She went to school, but came home to sleep another hour, went back to school after lunch and the nurse calls me at work to come get her. She's zonked out on the couch getting annoyed because I keep telling her DRINK WATER... She doesn't deal with stress well and it's just wearing her down, and even though I know I didn't create this situation, I still feel responsible since I'm so deeply involved in it, so she feels bad because I feel guilty, which makes me feel even worse so here we sit on the precipice of a downword spiral with nothing to hold on to, but one another as we're pulled into it knowing that we'll still be holding on when we're through it. Poop.   On to other stuff.... I went and made my very own laminated TO DO list at work today. With it being laminated I can use it as a dry erase board and it works really slick (Oh the things I can do with binder clips and sheet protectors!) Unfortunately I filled the damn thing up so fast that I should have used legal paper! I've been given so many little jobs lately that I was starting to forget things, so I thought I'd write them down along with their priority of high, medium and low. The bad thing is that it created yet another little job... 3 people want their own now! Linda is calling me a "crafty ass" again... it's one of the greatest compliments she gives! I discovered a bonus with having it hanging up for all to see... I was asked to write up a document, and told him to just add it to the list.. when he saw the list he asked Kathryn. :) Of course she griped about it, worked through her break to do it, and then got pissy because I took mine, but no one asked her to do that. There is a term for someone who will do what you ask, but make you sorry you asked in the first place. It's not passive aggressive or passive resitant.. I'll remember eventually.   I have to attend the CMMS training conference with my supervisor tomorrow. I hate conferences... No matter what the topic is, it is always the same schmoozy people with their fake smiles and lame attempts to cover the fact that they can't remember your name... JUST BE HONEST PEOPLE! My feelings won't be hurt if you say you forgot my name, but when you lie and pretend, and act pleased that you fooled me, I'm just going to be annoyed! Is that really so difficult a concept to grasp? And then there are always the keynote speakers droning on about all sorts of things you've heard a million times before, but trying to do it in a way that makes you believe it's all new info that will change your life. That's not to say conferences are bad things... just not the way I prefer to learn new things or meet new people.

						   This poor man is so confused. Part of me is so filled with pity, but I'm keeping my caretaker instincts in check because I know it would only exacerbate his confusion. He has twisted and turned things so much in his brain that he actually thinks I have a restraining order against him, and that I think he's going to molest Amanda because of our concerns about Johnny Miller (a level 3 sex offender) who is living 2 blocks away from us. He made a public post to Teri's group about what he believes is going on after he read about my conversation with Dawn my diary. (Which he read after he said he would move on, not that I'm surprised, but it really shows anyone that has even a mild grasp of logic that what he says and what he does are two entirely different things.) I apologized to Teri for the situation this puts her in because, like it or not, I'm the focus of all this insanity. I don't think my friends would believe his ranting for a moment, but if they have doubts, I'd be happy to forward them the e-mails and let them judge for themselves. I'd hate to think that this will cost me friendships that I've taken such a long time to build, but the cynical part of me is starting to wonder if that is his intention, like it's some sort of pay back for whatever wrong he believes I did him. I'm so sad and frustrated because I had been concerned about taking the risk to meet someone new... I'm always hessitant around new people, but I was so proud of myself for fighting my normal behavior of withdrawing (which I should have listened too this time), and followed through with keeping in contact with this man so that he would have at least one familiar face. It's going to be a long time before I extend friendship to anyone new. All I was trying to do was clarify that he was not expecting a relationship beyond friendship, but because it became very obvious that he would say one thing and do another, I realized that I didn't want anything to do with him at all. In a society that is filled with hatred and war, I prefer to only spend time with people who bring peace and happiness to my life... Life is too short to squander in the company of fools, I have to do that at work! LOL

						   I'll try to summarize for those who may not be aware of the insane situation I find myself in. A man who lived rather far away e-mailed me back in April of 2003 because he was planning on relocating to the area and found that we had similar interests and views. We exchanged a number of e-mails, with me telling him about the area, suggesting links to different sites I thought he'd find interesting and even offering to show him the sights once he arrived. It was all with the intention that he would have at least one person up here that he sort of knew so it wouldn't be all strangers. The first meeting wasn't really a meeting at all. We picked him up at the airport and dropping him off where he's now living which took a total of 1 hour. It was almost 3 weeks before we met a second time on the 18th. After spending a significant amount of time in his company, I determined I was not interested in anything other than friendship and told him that. He appeared to agree with me on that point so we finished our meal, I dropped him back at his home, shook his hand and said goodbye. I write in my Random Ramblings about the pleasant time I had as the conservatory, how we had agreed that there were no expectations of anything beyond friendship and really never expected to hear from him again except to occasionally cross paths at bi, poly or pagan events around town. On Tuesday (1/20), he e-mails me to correct me, saying that at no time in the 5 hours we were together did he say he had no expections. He said his expectation are tempered meaning he accepts that the chances are slim of anything more developing "for now". I respond and tell him that I am the one who said there could be no expectations and he agreed with me at the time. I also stressed that for friendship to even be possible, he needs to abandon any expectations he may have regarding me. So, he e-mails me on Wednesday (1/21) to say he made a mistake, and understands now that nothing more than friendship is possible, is sorry for any "wounds" that this brought up and stated that he wouldn't write anything more until I've had a chance to respond. I don't know what "wounds" he thinks have been brought up because I've never really gave him much thought except for making sure we were at the airport on time so he wouldn't be waiting around. So, I finally get around to responding to him last night, planning on telling him that I am sorry for the loss he must be feeling since he obviously has attributed much more to our communication than I ever intended and find that he sent me another e-mail on Thursday entitled "tired of fighting" where he says that he hopes we resolve this without name calling and that he's losing sleep, that he could have won the argument about expectations, but doesn't want to lose our "special friendship". My first thought is "So much for not writing until I've had a chance to respond!" My second thought is, "I didn't have this much drama when Robert left and tried to file for custody!" SHEESH! I tend to not waste my time in the company of people who annoy me, so it's pretty damn obvious to me that friendship isn't even an option (which Brian and I figure is the case 9 times out of 10 when meeting people we've been e-mailing). I decide that I'd better just end it right now because it's pretty clear that he's going to read way to much into any kindness or compassion I show him. Brian advises that I should try to keep it short to limit the possibility of him taking something I say as encouragement to pursue a friendship. I pretty much told him that in light of his most recent e-mail, I do not believe that friendship is possible. We gave friendship a shot and missed, that he needs to just get over it and move on with his life and all that was lost was a few hours of our time. So what does he do? He CALLS me on the phone and says he is willing to accept 100% responsibilty for the misunderstanding in the hopes that we can resolve this dispute. All I could think as I played the message was "What part of NO do you not understand?" I'm just devastated because Amanda is now worried that this guy is a stalker in addition to the stress of having a level 3 sex offender living in the neighborhood. I've read back over the 2 dozen or so messages we've exchanged and with new eyes, I can now see a pattern that was not obvious before.... boiled frog syndrome I guess, it was happening so slowly that I didn't realize it. Of course hindsight is 20/20, so I don't think I did anything wrong other than not being suspicious enough of a stranger. I can see now that I dismissed a number of comments he made that in light of the events of the past few days are serious red flags. I asked Dawn in security to take a look to get her take on it and she asked me if I had a gun. She also suggested that she keep them as dated evidence so that an outside party has proof of me ending the "relationship".

						   Now I feel like I live in Minnesota... -14 and -35 to -45 windchills. Brian and Amanda won't be going out this evening! We'll probably just record my shows and we'll stay warm and snug. Long day today. I put in an hour overtime so I can get caught up on a whole bunch of 2003 invoices that a certain supervisor decided that weren't due until the 22nd... he missed the December part of that request I guess.   I came home to find Brian running a cable to the antenna while installing the TV he bought me! I just mentioned it in passing that it would be nice to have a TV in my room so I could just watch my shows without them having to leave if they didn't want to. What a sweetie!

						   The meeting last night about the level 3 sex offender was rather unproductive. Mostly the police officers wound up being the punching bag for the people in the neighborhood. They took it well, and tried to be informative without being defensive. It turns out that this Johnny Miller has been living here for 3 weeks already and has quite a history. He's been in and out of prison for 25 years for raping women ages 15 - 60 with many arrests for prostutition, drugs, and domestic abuse. He has a 96% chance of reoffending, and has always stuck to areas and victims near his residence. He is going to rape again.. we need to make sure it isn't Amanda or I this time. I thought of some ideas after the fact. I think that there should be some self defense classes offered at the rec centers. I spoke with the rec director and the security supervisor. If I can find an instructor and get the local business association to pay the fee, then they would waive the fee for the classes. I think that this would be a good idea for it to be standard practice to arrange self defense classes at the rec centers when a level 3 sex offender relocates to a neighborhood. I may take another step and contact the Wetterling foundation or Child Find Minnesota... they have some pull with the police... I'm just the mother of a teenager.   My mind is so distracted that I completely wrecked a sign I was working on. 24"x 90" vinyl on plexiglass using only a tweezer, a box cutter and a 3" rubber squeegee. I was rushing too so after 3 attempts and 3 failures I finally gave up. Ugh.

						   Got some wonderful kudo's today. Karen asked me to make up a quick summary for the director of Parks using data from the objectives submitted by the supervisors. He liked it so much that he has told all the other departments in parks to use the same format.   Helps take the sting out of the fact that I have made a big mistake in my personal life. I extended friendship to someone who has decided that I was offering much more. Mostly I'm just annoyed, and concerned that I'm going to hurt his feelings.  I am decorating my bedroom. I bought the most beautiful duvet cover and a down comforter... my bedroom is going to be red and gold and absolutely lovely. I am building my own space and it's just going to be mine, I worry about Brian feeling like I'm pushing him away, but he seems happy about how much I'm enjoying this.

						   Had a somewhat pleasant day today. Spent most of it getting aquainted with Bryant. We picked him up at noon and came back to the house because Amanda wanted to come to the conservatory and Q.Cumbers with us. I was worried about him being offended by Gingersnap barking and making a growling fuss, but I told him to just ignore her completly to let her get used to him at her own pace and sure enough, she jumps up on the couch and is sniffing his ears in only 10 minutes. She even ate a biscuit that Brian gave her... something she NEVER does around anyone else, of course no one else just ignores her. Bob challenges her so she has to go outside whenever he is over. Chuck tries to pet her and talk to her so she takes that as aggression or a challenge, if he'd just ignore her, she'd probably lick his feet until his toes were prunes! Anyway! The conservatory was a really nice break from winter. We're all kicking ourselves for not having gone earlier, and will try to make a regular thing of it when it gets cold. I needed to hear the birds singing, and smell fresh earth. We got to know each other more over lunch/dinner, and he's seems nice but I am confident that Bryant understands that it will just remain a casual friendship. He did say that he would be patient and was "in it for the long haul" so I had been concerned that he was expecting more to come of it, but he assured me that he had no expectations.   He loaned us a book called "Big Big Love".. it's all sorts of resources relating to people of size... not just positions and shtuff like that, but other things relating to heath and beauty. Something that would be great to keep in mind as a gift for some of my plus sized friends who don't realize how desireable they are to a large percentage of the population. We dropped him off little after 5pm so it was a good patch of time.  We stopped at Target afterwards and I finally bought myself some new shoes... I looked at the high heels, and the slip ons... even some nice dress boots.. what do I buy? A pair of black joggers! I crack myself up sometimes. I bought an inexpensive dresser too so tomorrow will be spent assembling it.   I was just going through some boxes under my bed and I found an old pipe with some very old ash in it. It's been so long that I lit it anyway just to remember the taste. I hadn't really thought about how long it's been since I had anything fresh... must be 2 years now. Obvously I'm not addicted, but man I miss experiencing that wonderful sensation. Not worth getting arrested over it, but if any feel in my lap I sure wouldn't throw it a way! LOL

						   ICK! That is how I'm feeling! ICK! We just received a notice about a neighborhood meeting. It turns out that a level 3 sex offender is moving in just 2 blocks away. His victims have been 15 year old girls... Amanda is the right age. I've been reasurring Court's mom that just because he's likely to reoffend, doesn't mean he's going to, and doesn't change the fact that the girls have been walking past other sex offenders who weren't convicted so we don't know who they are. That this notification is an opportunity on many levels: to remind the girls that there are bad people in the real world, not just on television, to point out that the rule that they come straight home after their bus drops them off isn't because we don't trust them, but because we need to know that they are ok, to teach them to defend themselves if they find themselves in a situation, to reassure them that if they can't get out of the situation that we'll be there for them and know it's not their fault. Needless to say, I'm not going anywhere tonight, just for my own peice of mind, I need to stay in the comfort of my home with the doors locked. I feel helpless and I don't like that one little bit. I'll attend the meeting and that will help... being around other parents who will likely feel the same way.

						   I think the fasting worked... although I'm not counting my chickens yet... Sticking to crackers and peppermint tea just to be safe.   We will be seeing Bryant on Sunday... a visit to the Como Conservatory, a swing through downtown to see the Ice Palace being built, and then off to Q.Cumbers for an early dinner/late lunch. It will be nice to finally spend some time getting aquainted. Our first meeting was very short and didn't allow for much conversation.   Short notice about a polyamory discussion group. I wish I'd had more time to let others know so they could make their plans. Brian has his transformers group on Saturday so I don't know about when that will end. I could always go myself, but I really don't like to spring sudden plan changes on Amanda. The world is a very uncertain place... I'd like her to know that home is the one place she can count on for stability.

						   Amanda and I are so sick. Brian is starting to feel better, but he was pretty miserable as well. I was supposed to be at the Non-monogamy group get-togther and it was going to be the first time that I spent any real time with Bryant, but didn't dare risk a 30 minute car drive. I think I was running to the bathroom every 15 minutes. It hit Amanda around 10:30pm after Brian got home he told me it hit him as well, so it HAD to have been something the 3 of us ate. I called in ill at 7:15am, laid back down and didn't wake up again until 1:30pm. Turns out Amanda stayed home from school. She stayed home today too because she had a dental appointment in addition to feeling sick. I tried eating something mild for lunch, but it went right though me. Amanda and I have decided that a 24 hour fast with lots of water won't do us any harm.

						   Ok.. I'm feeling much better today I get depressed and then everything seems so overwhelming. Brian and I had a talk, I told him how I feel and we've agreed to try some things as a compromise. I hope he follows through. He agreed that I really need to have my own space so he is going to remove his things from the bedroom so I haved that space as my own. I will likely invite him in regularly, but it's my call. He also apologized for his childish behavior. He knows it's old programming and something he needs to stop doing.. he's not the abused and neglected youngest of 9 anymore, and he needs to stop acting like it. I know it's hard, but it's been 25 years since he left that situation, and time to stop reacting to it because it's driving me away, and now he knows that.

						   I've got some serious things going on. I'm at a point that I need to make a decision, and no matter which choice I make, I'm going to be devastated. I am so tired of having to be the "parent" in what is supposed to be an equal relationship, but I don't want to end the relationship because there is so much good... I feel like I'm dying though. Each day it is getting harder to find a reason to keep going and I'm starting to wonder why I even bother. We are supposed to be partners, but I spend as much time trying to get him to talk to me as I do trying to get my 14 year old to. I don't have a partner, I have another teenager, and I've spent the past 10 years trying to teach him how to become an adult, but it's not working. I've kept hoping that he'd get it, but I'm losing hope... and hope really is the only thing that keeps us alive.

						   What a busy day yesterday was. I'm just going to ramble a bit. The order of events is in no order what-so-ever. First off, I survived my first experience of opening day of permit season. I was on the news twice much to my dismay. I didn't even get a chance to let my hair dry and then my choice of clothes made me look like a giant tomato! And forget about having time to put on any make-up. I hadn't realized just how gray my skin looks in fluorescent lighting. I'm glad I at least had a chance to shower. I don't ever want to start work at 5am again... at least until next year. I only had two crabby people to deal with so that was nice, but man are my legs and hips sore from standing up and sitting back down again about 100 times. It didn't occur to me until around 2pm when it was getting harder and harder to do it, that it was really taking a toll on me physically. By 3:30 my brain was such mush that I couldn't even calculate the fees without using my fingers (nice representation of government employee there). When I finally got home I was so tired I went right to sleep and didn't wake up again until around 8:30... just long enough to eat something, brush my teeth and go back to bed at 9:30. We were supposed to go to a party, but Brian said I just sort of moaned at him so he went ahead without me. I'm glad because it was Bryant's first party here in Minnesota and if I couldn't be there, then at least Brian was. I'm really sad that I missed it though.. it sounded like an absolutely wonderful time! I did wake up when he got home and made him tell me all about it! (**EVIL GRIN**)   During work I got a surprise.. the roses that I was sneaking sniffs of in Pat Voyda's office turned out to be MY birthday roses and Karen found a carrot cake for me at Byerly's, and then we had pizza for lunch. It was such a nice surprise. I had suggested that we have the birthday observance on Wednesday because I figured it would be too nuts on Friday, but I was so busy with invoices and cleaning that I totally spaced it off. Kathryn thought it was funny that I would have thought they forgot about it, but it was even funnier that I forgot about it too! Linda made me a BEAUTIFUL card that says "Play in the warmth of the Sun, Dance in the light of the Moon" and it's embossed with pastel rainbow moons and stars. Too fun!  Rita had an incredibly sucky day. To start with, she had been upset because the toilet had been leaking around the base (the wax seal obviously) and she just can't afford a plumber (but she is on a first name basis with the sales people at Marshall Fields). Around 10:30 Scott came and told me that they were towing a silver Saturn because it was parked in front of a driveway, so I made two announcements that whom ever owned a silver Saturn that had been parked on Winnee, they had better get out there immediately. About 15 minutes later Rita comes charging in and changes into her sneakers so she can run out and save her car but was too late... so she vented at me a bit because she hadn't heard the first two announcements (I kept my mouth shut about the fact that if she'd been up in the office helping with permits like she was supposed to, she wouldn't have even needed the first announcment). She tried to call home to get one of her children to deal with it since she's at work, and it turns out that her phone had been disconnected. Well, that was the final straw and she had a little mini break down with an office full of customers. Karen tried to get Rita to go into her office, but rather than taking it as a suggestion to get out of the public eye and deal with it privatly she decided that she was being reprimanded and became quite indignant. Thankfully we were all pretty understanding even though it did leave us in a bit of a tight spot when she left to go get her car out of the impound lot. She was even more upset when she got back though because on top of the impound fee, she has a ticket now. The really sad thing about it is that it could have been avoided. She could have parked at my house and had Brian drop us off, or she could have parked in the area where the contruction workers have been parking since they didn't work due to the long holiday, but I wasn't about to point that out to her... I'll just take it as a lesson on my part to look at all the options so I don't end up in the same fix. Hopefully she will have had a good weekend when Monday come's around...   Just before Brian had to pick me up he found Amanda walking around the house in her robe and slippers crying. It turns out that the shelves and clothes rod at the foot of my bed finally gave way and made such a horrible noise that she thought Brian fell off the roof! Once he got her calmed down he came in to survey the damage. I'd had some glass jars with bath salts in them... and one empty one... of course the empty one shattered all over the blanket we had on top of the bedspread. Thankfully it was all contained so it was a simple matter of rolling it up carefully. Now we just have to figure out what to do with it so that there aren't any glass shards anywhere. I'm thinking that we should just toss the blanket because all we need is to miss one little peice of glass and and someone is going to be miserable. I'm somewhat pissed because I'd mentioned a couple of weeks ago that I thought one of the screws had pulled away from the wall. I made the mistake of trusting him to repair it on his own (15 minutes?) so didn't feel that I needed to check on it, but I'm kicking myself because I KNOW that I need to. Right now, he's trying to put the shelf back up, but there is lots of swearing going on because the screws are slotted instead of phillips so he's completely stripped the screw head, so Gingersnap is hiding under the table with her nose peaking out between my feet. I've asked if he wants help, but he just snarls at me and says "No, I can do it myself." I can hear him crying he's so frustrated. still 1/3/04 He just asked me what I wanted for my birthday. How do I say that I want to have place I enjoy coming home to? Instead, this house is so cluttered that I feel claustrophobic most of the time, which isn't doing a thing for my bood pressure OR my depression... sometimes I even have trouble breathing because there is so little room. And this was before my clothes all ended piled up on the couch. I've pretty much resigned myself to living in a place where there are just pathways. Every now and then I'll come home and the living room with be cleared and vacuumed... of course it's all been piled on the bed in our bedroom. I've stopped asking if he had company because he gets insulted by the implication... despite the fact that the answer is always "yes". It's quite bittersweet... I just enjoy it for the few hours that I get it but it makes me feel so worthless that he won't clean for me. I've learned not to open the bedroom door because that's usually just too much of a shock. Instead I announce that I'm going to go brush my teeth and he brings the mess back out into the living room so I can sleep. He gets angry that I don't show more appreciation, but it's hard to do when I'm waiting for the other show to drop... and it always does. He has a serious pack-rat problem and it's becoming apparent that there soon won't be room for me here anymore. His stuff has taken over the basement, the living room, the attic and most of the bedroom we share. I'm slowly going insane not having even a little closet under the stairs to be alone if I want to. Amanda has her room, Brian has the entire basement, the attic and his workshop/shed, plus he has the entire house to himself when I'm at work and Amanda is at school. I don't know what to do because even though I've told him how difficult it is, how it doesn't feel like a home, how it is causing damage to my health, he doesn't do anything about it. His usual response is "I know I need to get organized, which turns out to be another excuse to buy some bins or shelves that he won't use. Oh, man I could go on and on about the empty boxes and pet food bags folded and set on top of shelving units still in boxes. He just gets caught in the trap of believing he can't organize his tools, until he puts the shelves together, but can't put the shelves together until he buys this neat new tool, but realizing that he needs room to assemble the shelves but there are too many tools in the way. I've tried to do it for him, but it's just wasted effort. He fills up the space faster than I can clear it. I still don't know how Rae and Kelli could have had a living room, bedroom, fridge and microwave down in the basement... I can't even get to the washing machine any more (last time I tried, I got hurt stepping on a saw). What do I want for my birthday? I want something that he'll never be able to give me... a comfortable home in which to live.   I started out very happy when I started writing, but in the past hour I've become very down. I would like to just go to sleep but I can't because he's got tools and plaster dust all over the bed, and my clothes are all over the couch. If it wasn't so cold, I'd just go sit in my car and listen to the radio... it's about the only place in the world I have that is neat and clean.. a reflection of how I'd like my life to be, instead of how it actually is. I really can only see one possible way to make it a reality, and I'm just not desperate enough for that yet. I keep hoping that he'll grow up, that I'll be able to make the right suggestion as a starting point, that he won't find some excuse for not finishing.. A fools hope I'm sure, but still a hope that I'm just not ready to give up on.

						   Oh man am I sore! I really pitched in and helped clean up some junky yards with the abatement crew. I was lifting tires, shoveling dog poop and even ran the packer. My back started to stiffen up after a few hours back at my desk, and by the time I got home from work, I was totally exhausted. I got out of my icky clothes and thought I'd just lay down for a bit before dinner, and I didn't wake up until my alarm went off this morning. I got up and showered, dressed and got myself to work by 7:30 but by 9:00 I realized I should have stayed home, so I came home for the rest of the day. Problem with that of course was that it was TOO NICE TO STAY IN BED!!! I did some VERY LIGHT yard work, burned some wood and got tons of fresh air. My back feels fine if I keep taking my Motrin and I should be fine.

						   Had a wonderful evening Friday. Teri and Deb hosted a Meet and greet at a bar in St Cloud. I can't do the smoke, so I hosted a after party at a hotel nearby. We had a lot of fun and didn't wrap up until after 1:30am. It was good to see familiar faces and meet a new one. I can't wait until we can all get together again. I wish my house was bigger. It's just so small, and Gingersnap is so intollerant of strangers even NEAR the house that it's not even a possibility to host a party here.   It was a nice mini vacation and a bit of a rite of passage at the same time. This was the first time ever Amanda was home alone over night. It was no big deal to her at all.. I of course am mildly wacked out over the whole thing... torn because I'm very proud to know that she is responsible enough to handle it, but feel that sad sense of loss of childhood at the same time. She got a bit nervous because Gingersnap kept barking, but it's a nightly routine for our neighbor's cat go exploring in the alley.... it's time to refresh our territory markings again. :)   I'm having a nice day today watching the race at Darlington. It's been an exciting race so far... I was joking to Brian last night that he's a NASCAR widower... Just pretend I'm not even here. I have no interest in any other sport, but I just LOVE racing.   I'll need to go waterproof boot shopping later today... Tuesday it's my turn to go out with the abatement crew to see what they do. When Rita went out there was a dead ferret in an abandoned freezer in someone's back yard, When Kathryn went out the homeowner got hostile and the police had to be called... I wonder what excitement I'll experience when I go out. I have a great respect for the job that the PED/Abatement crew does, but I do NOT want to pick up someone elses garbage! EEEWWWWWW

						   Ok, what the hell happened to February? March is half over even. I decided to take a break from the public airing of my thoughts for a while. I figure that 6 weeks would be long enough for that one particular freak of nature to get over it all and leave me in peace. I've never liked the month of February much anyway, there are a number of reasons, but the most obvious is that I was married to my ex-husband on Valentine's day and he was living elsewhere just after Mother's day. There is also the weather issue. I can handle just cold, but when you get a couple of days that are shockingly nice making you long for spring and then WHAM, winter comes back bites you in the ass. Ah well. I'm back now that spring is definately on its' way.

						   Today is going to be a busy busy day. I just took Gingersnap for her walk to the park. She is really starting to become more behaved. I bought her a new type of harness that she doesn't pull as much as when we attach the lead to her collar (You'd think it would be the other way around, but apparently not) and I bought this new type of lead that can be used multiple ways. I looped it around my waist and then attached it to her harness so she was forced to walk at my side... then when we got to the park, I used the flexi-lead (25 foot retractable) and just attached it so it turned out to be a totally hands free walk. I enjoyed it very much, and Gingersnap is exhausted!   Now I'm going to go make some raised garden beds to start my square-foot vegie garden, but only have until 3pm because tonight we go off to Treasure Island Casino with some people from work (it's a fund raiser for the retiree recognition committee), and the bus leaves at 4pm sharp.

						   Only mildly teased at work today about getting locked out of the house. I've been calling around to get tree services to give estimates on taking the tree out and it's not looking good. The first one said $5500 and that does not include grinding the stump or dropping the power lines to do it

						   Our old icky metal shed that was partially crushed is finally a pile of flat peices ready to be hauled off to the recycling place... I am reclaiming my yard THANK YOU BRIAN! It's nice to have something finished. He's been having a rough time completing things. He had two heavy blows to his self-esteem... The second to the last being when he tried to do the quick project of replacing the medicine cabinet in early March only to discover that the opening wasn't big enough AFTER ripping out the old one (I'm officially sick of looking at a roughed out opening and the back side of a plaster and lathe wall that has the desicated remains of spiders imbedded in it whenever I brush my stupid teeth. The final one was when Amanda confessed that the loft has to go because being left only half complete 6 months ago (it was supposed to be finished the following weekend) it had now become so wobbly that she didn't feel safe, sleeping under it on the floor most of the time because she was sore from climbing her dressers to get up into it (I had thought that a ladder had been put in there). The result is now that the mattress is on the floor, and her posessions are in the front porch.. and she's HAPPY so it was really bad.   I don't blame Brian completely for the unfinished projects.. things come up that suddenly have a higher priority... it's called life, and for most people it's a small detour, but for Brian, it's a major stumbling block and rather than dealing with it, tends to just give up and ignore it until it becomes a hazard that requires a quick fix. I am angry at Brian for allowing his procrastinating tendancies to put my daughter at risk for so long.. he put his emotional needs before the physical safety of my child and I can't understand that. I didn't make a big deal out of, because I knew that if I told him how I felt about it, would drag him down even more, and the effort that it takes to pull him out of that place is just too emotionally draining. It's a hard choice because just thinking about the number of times we are forced to make due and settle for temporary fixes is downright pathetic.   I accept that he is this way (and don't expect him to ever change), but it is with a sense of hopelessness that concerns me.... greatly. As long as I'm depending on Brian to fulfill his promises, will I ever be able to look forward to something being done? or will my life be a series of "good enough for now" quick fixes that are never completed. This of course goes back years and years... the original agreement was that I would pay the bills, and he would, with his handyman skills, take care of the household chores and repairs. I don't deny that he tries, and that he does help... the difference is that he never ever has to think about the bills, not rent, taxs, insurance or utilities.. it's something he can depend on... I don't have that same dependability... I can't count on anything... not a clean house (unless Chuck comes over for lunch, then he cleans for sure), not dinner, not repairs (I am always wondering when I'll be good enough to be worth real fix).   Ugh... I didn't mean to go here.. It depresses me because when I start thinking about how it makes me feel, I get into the whole why don't I just do it myself, because then it's too unfair, why don't you kick him out, because he has other things to offer to my life than fixing stuff, but you don't enjoy the other things when your so sad, but I'm not always sad.. and well, there you go. I get myself down start running "rehersal conversations" with him and then get confused about what I've said and what I want to say.. Man relationships are complicated. You know, to be honest, I never wanted to be in a relationship in the first place. We were just friends who derived mutual benefit from one another's company... he slowly moved in (over a period of months) and gave up the apartment. I wonder at times if I'm having commitment anxiety or if he changed... I don't think he would have been around much if his promises fell through as much as they do now... I try to fight the feeling that I've been tricked and lied to, because I don't believe for a minute that it was intentional.. just old programming that he can't stop, but it's getting hard to be the one to pay for his shitty childhood and unresolved issues. And I start to wonder if I'm being patient and understanding, or have fallen into the role of co-dependant, enabling him to continue to do this... At which point do I stop being a nagging bitch and become someone who is fighting for her sanity? Which begs the question... is there any sanity left worth fighting for? Tomorrow had better be a good day dammit!

						   Well, it's been an eventful day. Today was my last day off for the long weekend and rather than being relaxing, it's been quite eventful. I woke up in a good mood to an house empty of all humans (Brian went to Becker and Amanda was in school) and just had a lazy morning, first enjoying the beautiful day, having some private time, scouting out the perfect area in Como Park where I'd love to have a Memorial Bench for Grampa (Note to self: I need to find out if I can have another plaque installed later to add Gramma as well), I'm informed that the Cottonwood needs to be removed (note to anyone with a shred of emotion, this tree was planted by my Great-grandfather the day my Grampa was born), then when I tried to go back into the house discovered that I'd accidentally locked it, so I'm stuck outside in socks, crop sweat pants, short sleeved t-shirt and NOTHING else while a co-worker (the forestry person who recommends the tree's demise) watches as I try to break into my house. I've of course panicked because since I had the house to myself and will for the next 5 hours decided to pack a pipe just for the hell of it so I'm getting a serious case of paranoia because I'm certain that something is going to happen to me, call for Brian in Becker on the forestry crew's cell phone (after calling work first to ask Kathryn to call Brian ... don't ask why I did it, I don't know ok?) so know everyone at work is going to have a field day with the locked out jokes. Back to work tomorrow so I'd better get to bed.

						   The race yesterday was quite exciting. Some people think it's a strange way to honor my grandfather.. they say I should go to Fort Snelling and put a flag by his headstone, but he's not at Fort Snelling. His bones are, but he isn't. He was right here watching the race with me as he and I have done for 38 years. The only time we didn't watch it together was when he and Gramma actually went to Indiana.. something many fans try to do, but Grampa thought it was a terrible disappointment because he loved watching the pit crews and you only get that when you watch the race on TV. I miss him. May 9th marked 14 years since he died. It doesn't seem that long ago, but at the same time it feels like forever.   It seems like such a duh, but I think I just figured out why I get so depressed this time of year... In January of 1989 was when Grampa was diagnosed with prostate cancer, he had a very successful surgery, but emotionally it took months for him to recover. Just as he was getting used to the idea that this was his second chance, he had a massive heart attack out of the blue. What a horrible time that was for all of us... the shock of cancer, the worry over the surgery, the joy of successs and then the sudden death of someone we loved so much.

						   Surprised the heck out of my Mom today! It's her birthday today and so I called Rae to make sure she was going to be home. Rae said she wasn't going anywhere and asked if we wanted to suprise her, I said that if she was going to be there, don't bother to say anything. So we went over there, but no answer, so we go next door to Gramma's. Rae decides to call over there and tells Mom to come over right now, but wouldn't tell her why. Well, she was in the tub and comes racing over in a terrycloth wrap because Rae makes it sound like an emergency! (That kid!) So there's Mom opening gifts from Amanda, Brian and I practically naked. She really enjoyed them... especially when she was able to go back and finish her bath. LOL

						   Rita's dad died at 5:30 this morning.  It's weird because she told me on Monday that she knew he'd die on Wednesday and sure enough, he did.  Work is going to be nuts, especially this time of the year.  I told her the other day that I hope I'm hit by a bus because this long drawn out death is tough not only on the person dying, but on the family too.  It's unfortunate because there is going to be such a sense of relief and then the guilt for feeling that way.

						   We didn't get a chance to get to Minneapolis today.  No one was feeling particularly well, and the idea of being ill and being in the rain didn't appeal at all.  Instead we worked a bit in the yard.  Brian finished the alley steps, and we were able to fill in the low spots with some leaves and compost.  It will shrink, but hopefully by fall the walkway will be in so it won't matter.  I really wish he'd get rid of the truck.  It's becoming very peaceful, but then my eyes hit that ugly truck and I cringe!  I'll have to push again, I know that both our cars will fit during the parking ban for the Hmong Soccer Festival, but maybe I can convince him that we should get rid of it.    The Vet called today to let us know that the mass Tasha had removed was NOT cancerous.  She is doing quite well.. hates the antibiotics... likes the pain killers and is healing quite well. I keep checking the incision though.  We're supposed to limit her activity, but that's quite impossible.  She leaps around all over the place.  You'd never guess that she's 13 years old.

						   Yesterday the cats had to go in for their boosters and dental cleanings and the vet discovered a mass on Tasha's abdomen.  Thank heaven I have the Banfield wellness plan because it WOULD have cost me over $1500... instead it was $208. So she's back on antibiotics again as well as painkillers.  She'll have to go back in 2 weeks to get the staples removed and get the boosters because she couldn't get them and have surgery.  Amanda had to go in to the Dr as well because she has another ear infection.  They had to try a different antibiotic for her because she just finished a round for the right ear.  The pharmacy didn't have the pills so they gave her the children's liquid which means that Tasha and Amanda are both taking pink liquid antibiotics that smell like bubblegum.... how weird is that  It was supposed to be my Thursday night, but no such luck, Amanda knocking on the door, the dog barking to be let in, The TV up so loud that I can't even hear mine... and Brian? Oh, he's out in his shed working on a shut of thing for the dust collector he's been working on for months.  So guess who has to deal with it all, THE MOM of course. It really pisses me off that I can't get one lousy day..  I suppose that I should just not even bother coming home, but the whole idea was that I could just be in my pj's, watch my shows, do my nails, go through catalogs, whatever!  Just stuff for me to do for me from 7 to 10.. it's not even a day, its 3 hours.  I don't know why I even bother trying.

						   I don't know what it is with people. I had been chatting with someone who seemed really excited about meeting in person, so I arrange to meet them. I double check the times and locations to make sure there is no misunderstanding and I just end up sitting there for 45 minutes. Granted we weren't supposed to meet until 4:30 and I got there are 4:15, but I waited until 5:00 before leaving. It has been months since I even considered meeting anyone new so it's really annoying. Brian said that rejection is hard, but it's not about being rejected. I can handle being told not interested, I'm just really annoyed because I had a rough day at work and would much rather have just gone straight home and slipped into some sweats than sit there listening to some woman shouting into her cell phone. Needless to say, I wont' be bothering making any appointments with this individual again... his first impression was, to put it simply, non-existant.   One of the reason's work was so crazy is that Rita had to go home. About a week or so ago, her pit bull bit her other dog B.J. so she finally realized that she'd better have him put to sleep before he attacks one of her grandkids. It was really hard for her to do. She was ok through the whole procedure but when it was over, he looked like he was still awake so she expected him to get up when she did and he didn't, so it finally hit her that he was dead, and that her father would be next (advanced stages of alzheimers) so she lost it. Her eyes were so puffy and bloodshot that she couldn't function properly, so it was better for her to just go home.

						   Had a very nice Father's day. I brought Brian breakfast in bed.. he really liked that, then we went off to the TCPride picnic at Como Park and met some friends from TCBOP. Then we hit the library and grabbed an ice cream cake. We had a lazy day until we started getting hungry and I orderd a couple of pizza's from Papa Johns. Tried the Chicken club, but it wasn't to our taste. I've fallen in love with the Hawaiian BBW Chicken, so it's my new favorite.

						   Les Miserables was WONDERFUL!! Oh man it was just so amazing I can't even begin to describe it. We have decided that we will try to see a live performance at least once a year. Amanda wanted the soundtrack, but the 3cd set was $60 and that was more than a ticket so unfortunately we couldn't get it. I'm going to have to keep an eye on Amazon or E-bay.   We went out to Great Moon which is our favorite place because you can pick your own ingredients and have them cooked up in front of you. My favorite recipe is lamb, pea pods, bean sprouts and sliced onions with garlic and pepper. The sauces are the key though. I wonder if it's an actual asian recipe or if I created it.  We decided to swing by Gram's to shock everyone with Brian's new hair. Of course they went nuts and think it's just a great look for him. I'm very pleased with it myself. It still startles Brian when he looks in the mirror, but he's getting used to it. :)   After we left Gram's we decided to pop into Target and there were lots of street rods on University. I had completely forgotten about the 50's car show at the State Fair grounds. It was a blast to see all those old cars. One was showing off it's sound system and got pulled over right in front of us... the twit. :) But we went way out of the way to see as many as we could. If I was a mechanic, I would love to have my own blast from the past... It's not a car for your average consumer.  Tomorrow is the TCBOP picnic at Como Park... it's the same time and location as the TC Pride Picnic so we'll just HAVE to make an appearance. Amanda is interested in going

						   Went to St Cloud for Steve and Penny's party tonight. Penny wasn't able to attend which left me being the sole female.... which is fun, but can feel a bit overwhelming. We were having an really enjoyable time when some kid came walking down the hall knocking on doors. It was like a bucked of cold water, and we just couldn't get back into a party mood. Very disappointing for everyone. I felt bad for Steve and hope that he was able to recoup the cost. I know how expensive it can be to have a hotel party.   Had dinner with Wendy on Thursday and it was so nice to catch up. She was telling me about her friends that make up her Goddess circle... the whole concept sounds great, and it's easy to see how happy she is knowing she has these "sisters" in her life to turn to... It's a real good example to me of how magick happens if you just let it. The only annoying thing was that Olive Garden changed their recipe for Seafood Alfredo... it use to be shrimp and crawfish, but now it's shrimp and sea scallops with chopped red bell pepper and I don't like it. The tirimisu was the same as always, but the conversation was the high point. I know schedules are tough, but I hope we get to catch up before another 18 months goes by!

						   I buzzed Brian's head today. I didn't mean to. It seemed simple in the instructions, but zip! his hair is about 3/4" long all over his head. It doesn't look bad, but it is strange to seem him with such short hair. The big plus is that his head feels as soft as velvet, so I can't stop touching it. He said if this is the result, I can keep buzzing it short. :) Thankfully his hair grows very fast. In a month it will probably fit him better.   I wasn't even thinking about the party we are attending tomorrow, or the fact that he's picking Lula up from Amtrack tonight (she won't recognize him!). I DID remember that we are going out Saturday to see Les Miserables at the Ordway, but figured that it wouldn't be so bad. We're all pretty excited about it. Amanda wanted to see a real musical, and it's been quite sucessful... I think this is the 2nd run through the Ordway. I wasn't expecting Brian to be interested, seeing as how he is tone deaf, but he thought it would be great so I bought 3 tickets. The better seats were sold out so we are in the balcony, but we have field glasses. Should be fun.

						   What a strange couple of days it's been. Bradley brought Fluffy over yesterday, and oh, he was such a little love. He purred all day and all night. Gingersnap wouldn't leave him alone, sniffing and cleaning him constantly. I did some basic grooming but I didn't bother too much with his mats since we'd be bringing him to the vet today and would have a professional take care of it. When I was cleaning his ears however, he shook his head and blood and puss came flying out (eeeewwww). He was still purring so it was my hope that it was just like a tick that I squished. Brian brought him into the vet and we got some very bad news. Fluffy apparently had very advanced Feline Leukemia and a severe ear infection, gum infection and urinary infection. Along with the sores all over his skin and under the mats there was just no way he was going to heal. They ran all the tests twice and had two vets examine him before telling us that the only thing to do would be to put him to sleep. Dr. Ballanger is great though, she waived all the exam and blood test fees ... It was only $105 for the drugs to put him to sleep (they have to keep records of that stuff) and the creamation. Poor Brian could barely handle it... he held Fluffy during the process and he purred right to the end. Oh it was horrible to tell Bradley, but he as two other cats who have had long term exposure and are likely to need treatment. Tasha and Cloudy have all their vacinations and were only exposed for a day so the chances are good that they didn't contract it, but we'll have to bring them in every couple of months to be sure.

						   Ronald Reagan's funeral was today. Nearly every channel had coverage. I didn't pay much attention to it until after 8:00 for the sunset service. It was quite touching. It was sweet to hear the humor from his children, I especially loved the goldfish memory from his daughter... I'm glad she chose to share it with us. Being a devoted Christian in his life, the service had a strong Christian overtone which was a bit much for my taste, but competely appropriate for him. It really tore my heart out when Mrs. Reagan said her final goodbye and started to cry. I can't imagine having to mourn in such a public eye. There were thousands of people watching at the ceremony and millions watching all over the entire world.   I was shocked when I was about to leave work today. Armstead came up to me and said he had enjoyed working with me and would miss me. He never said a thing about getting his transfer request approved. I can understand... I don't like a lot of fuss made over farewells and things like that. My "funeral" will be quite simple (if anyone respects my wishes of course). After they take whatever parts can be used by someone else, I want the rest to be cremated and then have each person who loves me to take a different type of tree and a scoop of my ashes and go plant the tree using the ashes as fertilizer... and that's it. Plain and simple, that's me.

						   Brian, Rae, Kelli, Amanda and I went and saw Harry Potter on Saturday evening. We had hoped to see the 7:30 show, but they sold out just as we got there. So we bought tickets for the 8:45 and went to get some dinner. It really bites because I scraped against Monica's fence and dented the car to get there on time.  We got back to the theater by 8:30 and had a hell of a time finding 5 seats together. Amanda sat by herself in front of us so she could see better. It was good. LOTS of stuff missing from the book, but it was a loooonnnnggg book. I don't know what they are going to do with the fourth one! Brian spent most of the weekend helping Bradley and Paul replace his roof. I went just to say "Hi" and have been offered to take Bradley's cat Fluffy/scruffy... he's old and not able to clean himself anymore, and Bradley just doesn't have the time. We're considering it, but a lot depends on how our cats and dog cope with the addition.   The heat really rolled in today... I wasn't expecting it until Wednesday so I was quite impressed that Brian was able to get the main AC in by the time I got home from work... it really sucks that our office is so damn cold (very old HVAC system.. either it's blowing cold, or blowing hot, take your pick) by the time we left it was down to 62 in there and I was ready to turn my heater on! I stepped outside and almost couldn't breathe because the air was so hot and heavy. It's supposed to cool down this evening so hopefully we can sleep. He's still very sore from working on the roof so carrying the small AC units up from the basement is NOT a task he's excited about doing.   Linda loved my new outfit. I have been buying more "girl clothes"... I'm most comfortable in jeans and t-shirts, but I'm getting bored wearing the same things all the time, so last week I splurged on new clothes and got some very girly outfits. It's rather strange to be worrying about getting my clothes wrecked too... at the library I had to wear disposable clothes because everything got so dirty and more than once one of the book crates tore a pair of jeans. I haven't had to buy a new pair of jeans in 18 months so I decided it was safe to buy nice stuff.

						   Oh MAN! I just found out today that Rita's pit bull Norton killed her little blind puppy Max over the weekend! She had been keeping up to date on how he was learning to obey commands and was getting so confident that he hardly ran into anything anymore, I was starting to feel like he was one of my own. She wasn't home at the time, but what happened was that her oldest son Nathan was cleaning his room and her youngest Ryan was helping. A pig ear was ejected from Nathan's room and Ryan put it on the toy box. Norton must have found it, and the puppy Max wandered too close and Norton attacked. Both Nathan's and Ryan's hands are swollen and cut up because they were punching that damn dog in the head over and over again to get him to let go. Her daughter Jessica was taking Max out to the car to bring him to the vet when his heart stopped, so she's all traumatized by having the little thing die in her arms, Ryan is blaming himself and Nathan wants to have Norton put down. Rita is hessitant because she loves Norton and knows it was just instinct (like when my cat Fred killed my pet rat Cleo), but also knows that this is the 2nd time he's attacked one of her dogs (she broke a bone in her hand getting him to release BJ who survived, but had big vet bills), and that next time it could be one of the grandkids who gets too close to the food. She's very much a "3 strikes and your out" type of person, but it's hard for me to understand because I'm a "you only get one second chance" type. It's weird because over the weekend was an incident with a family that owned 2 lions. One of the lions attacked this man's daughter and he had to shoot it, and let a wildlife refuge take the other one because he didn't want to risk anyone else getting hurt.   Personally, I don't believe that just anyone should be allowed to own exotic/wild animals. I can understand someone who is a professional animal trainer, or a retired zoo keeper, but just any old idiot who thinks it'd be cool to have a lion is apalling (in my not so humble opinion)! Of course I'm not thrilled with zoos either. I know they have their reasons, but I really hate the idea of keeping any kind of animals in cages no matter how big or how hard they try to replicate their native habitat... especially birds. Not that I'm saying that all the birds from the pet stores should be released into the wild... they wouldn't last a day, it's just that it breaks my heart that an animal that is meant to fly NEEDS to be in a cage. I know that the that domesticated animals have a longer life expectancy, but you know what? Humans will live longer if they are put into a nursing home, but how many of us say we'd rather die that whither away in a nursing home? I can't imagine that a creature even more wild than myself wouldn't feel just as strongly.

						   Had the "joy" of seeing a really viscious side of a member in one of my adult groups.&nbsp; One of the men happened to mention the attributes of his genitals in his introductory post and she went balistic.&nbsp; The poor man unsubscribed with apologies to me, but rejoined after I pointed out that I approved his post in the first place, and he did nothing wrong, but may want to refrain from mentioning his penis in the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; I deleted&nbsp;the &nbsp;personal attack toward him, &nbsp;and sent her a note asking her to refrain from personal attacks.&nbsp; Nothing mean, just reminding her that if she doesn't like something someone posts, to use her delete key.&nbsp; The e-mail she hit me with was obviously a showing of her true personality.&nbsp; She was so hostile in her e-mail that she couldn't even compose a proper sentence.&nbsp; The e-mail is filled with typos and vulgarities that don't even make sense.&nbsp; She concluded with the fact that she was deleting her pictures and unsubscribing from the group.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a bit difficult not to respond with "Don't let the door hit you on the way out," but she's not worth it.&nbsp;  Now I can understand the idea that it is a group for BBWS and Oral, so a reference to penis size is not really appropriate, but this same woman has posted for submissives despite the fact that this is not a BDSM group.&nbsp; No difference at all in my mind.&nbsp; I allow posts that mention BDSM, if the rest of the post is on topic because it's just personal information being relayed, right?&nbsp;   Of course there is a chorus of "Right on" and "way to go" from 3 other members.&nbsp; It pisses me off that people who are in an adult group don't know how to behave like mature adults.&nbsp; I posted a special notice stating that I will not permit personal attacks toward anyone, and that I'll delete the group before I allow it to become a venue for male bashing.&nbsp;&nbsp; At the moment, all posts are moderated, which sucks.&nbsp; I hate babysitting adults who just don't know how to be polite.&nbsp; They wouldn't dream of talking to another person that way in person, but hiding behind the keyboard, their true personality comes to light.&nbsp; In over a year I've never had this type of hostility in my group.&nbsp; It makes me sad.

						   Amanda had her orthodontist appointment today... She doesn't have to wear the binders anymore, and they figure that she can get the braces off the appointment after next... then it's retainers for many years, but she doesn't mind.&nbsp;&nbsp; She is really getting excited about how pretty she looks.&nbsp; I'm so happy that she is fitting in her own skin...That's really all a parent can wish for.

						   A new picture on my profile.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was playing around with&nbsp; urlLink NeoPaint  last night and made an interesting self-portrait based on a photograph of me.&nbsp; It's quite fetching if I do say&nbsp;so myself... reminds me of how I looked when I was in my late teens.&nbsp;&nbsp; I had been using my geocities site&nbsp;for the picture since blogger&nbsp;doesn't host&nbsp;pictures, but it was unreliable.&nbsp; I did a quick search and found a quick and easy place to keep it  urlLink http://www.imageshack.us/ &nbsp;&nbsp;You can upload a single picture and it gives you the appropriate link including html codes for eBay,&nbsp;message boards and the like... if you register&nbsp;(give an e-mail address and click the url they send) you can manage your images and access them anytime.&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope&nbsp;it sticks around for a while. &nbsp;  I was asked to attend Swingstock this evening.&nbsp; I hated to decline because I really enjoy being around him, but I really dislike crowds.&nbsp; I don't mind smaller gatherings (10-15 people), but I was hiding at my own wedding because there were just too many people.&nbsp; SHOOT!&nbsp; There's a name for it, but I forgot it... it's similar to claustrophobia, but that's not it.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Thank you&nbsp; urlLink dictionary.com !&nbsp;  Demophobia; fear of crowds, masses, or people; also called ochlophobia. &nbsp; It's not that I FEAR crowds... I just don't&nbsp;enjoy them, and I can't see any reason to do something I don't enjoy.&nbsp; Some people enjoy being in a mass of people... I do not.&nbsp; I love WATCHING people, but in smaller settings.&nbsp; It does sound fun, and I hope he can find someone to attend with.&nbsp; I do believe that it's couples only, so if his wife cannot make it, and he can't find a woman to attend, he can't go.&nbsp;

						   EEEKKK!  I bought myself another laptop.  It's pretty nice.  And IBM PentiumII 333MgHz, 10 Gig harddrive, DVD/CD rom, and only $436 with tax..  It's not cutting edge, but I don't need all the fancy stuff.  It's bigger and faster than what I have, and Amanda will be happy with this one.  She only has 21 hours more of hard labor to earn it.  I made a thermometer type of thing for her to have a visual reminder of how far she has to go... nearly 1/3 the way.      A weird thing that happened... I had pretty much decided on the one I bought, but after paying $8 to get in, I was going to take a look around before actually buying anything.  There were lots of vendors that were selling laptops, and I stopped at one table that had a similar computer at $550, and a CD option for $149.  I proceded to tell Brian that the one I wanted had the DVD/CD Rom and the salesman started YELLING at me... WHAT THE HELL??  I just walked away, but how weird was that?  Like I'm actually going to buy anything from that ass now? Everyone who was nearby totally skipped that table too which was really funny to see.  And of course he just stares daggers at me as I'm walking away.  I caught him looking at me a couple more times too.

						   We just got back from the off-leash dog area and Gingersnap is exhausted.  She got a bit growly because the other dogs were getting too close to me and it was pretty hot, but she enjoyed herself.  A couple of kids came into the area to play with the dogs, but Ginger wanted nothing to do with them which is really odd because usually she LOVES children.  The girl picked up a stick and was trying to get Gingersnap to play and when she wouldn't, she  "accidentally"  hit Ginger in the face. I made a bit of a fuss, and she went away to play with some of the other dogs.    Brian was surprised at the size of the place.  It's over 4 acres all fenced in with hills and valleys lots of trees and hiking trails.  We're going to try to visit there at least once a week.  I'm pretty wiped out because while Brian was at his Lego group, I decided to take down the buckthorn bushes.  I did it all in just over an hour.  Brian and Amanda can take care of getting rid of the cut brush since I did the hardest part.  It looks awful back there now, but that won't be for long, and it's good to have those things out since they do so much harm to the song birds.  My arms are terribly scratched up and at one point I noticed that there was blood dripping too.  Good thing I was done. :)    I want to put a simple privacy fence coming out from the shed to the alley. Eventually I would want it to encircle the entire back yard, but that can be done slowly, so there is no rush.  I asked if there had been any progress with getting rid of Quasimodo (the rusted out Suburban that needs to have gas poured into the carborator to start) and Brian said he'd get rid of it this week!  OH I HOPE SO!!  It's so ugly and there is no reason at all for a house with 2 drivers to have 3 vehicles, especially one that had it's tabs expire in December.  I get sick of looking out the back and seeing that thing so I'm thrilled to believe that it's going to be gone... but I'm not going to count my chickens.  I know Brian, and I know that something is bound to come up that will postpone it.

						   When I was at Michael's I decided to pick up a couple of skeins of Woolease because I've been talking about the idea of picking up knitting again.  Since it's been a couple of years I wasn't sure how long it would take me to remember.  .  Well, I dug out my needles and I'm ready to turn the heel.  I had to stop myself, otherwise I'd be up all night finishing the pair.  I've really missed the knitting and I still got it... 3" in about an hour.  Cool.

He said he'd e-mail me his pic, but didn't so I'm not surprised that he didn't show up.  I'm glad I didn't invest too much time into getting to know him, otherwise I'd be really annoyed.

						   Rae called me at work to tell me that she was offered the job at she did accept it.  My daughter is a boss person now, with her own office, her own staff, and tons of benefits that includes full medical for herself and Kelli!  She's going to give her notice on Friday and and will finish out the next week and then starts on the 19th. She is concerned about telling the parents of the babies she's been caring for.  She knows that some are going to feel betrayed, but she is smart and knows she has to make the choices that are right for her.

						   Oh my GAWD!  I know all sorts of women rant about their ex's, and that many women have worse situations than mine, but this deserves a good rant.  Some background.  Christmas 1988 Robert asks me to marry him, I say yes.  We're married Valentine's Day 1989.  I discover I'm pregnant, he leaves.  I end up with complications, he comes back.  Amanda is 3 months old, he leaves me for another woman, I file for divorce, he comes back.  He stays for 6 months (long enough for the child support order to expire) and then moves back in with the other woman and HE files for divorce.  He and his 2nd wife move to Wyoming.  He comes back in 1993 and promises to be the father that she deserves.  Fine, he's back.  We agree on a visitation schedule, and despite the interference of his wife, is able to maintain contact.    In 1998, his marriage starts going bad and they separate.  He starts being treated for depression, and I support him and befriend him again.  We are friends for a while until his divorce is finalized, and now ex-wife who was downright cruel to Amanda and barely civil to me, e-mails me to say she and I have to stick together now.  I tell her to stuff it, she tells Robert, and HE attacks me.  Eventually he apologizes, but I want nothing to do with being his friend anymore.  He continues the visits until  September of 2000... Just a month before her 11th birthday.  His 2nd wife is moving to Boston, and taking their son and daughter with her, so he's going to become a truck driver because there is nothing to keep him here in Minnesota anymore.  (Horrible enough, add to that the fact that he was standing at the front door, and I was standing next to the couch where Amanda was sitting.)  He said he would still visit when he came through Minneapolis, but it was no surprise that he never showed up again.   I kept wondering if he would just do the right thing and stay away, or if he would be an ass again.  Guess what?  He's an ass through and through.  He sent Amanda a letter today.  I had great hopes that it was an apology for being gone, and maybe an offer to be someone she could talk to and perhaps they could be friends again.  Well, no such luck.  He's coming out as gay because his father was gay, his mother doesn't love him, he tried to kill himself a month ago, he's in treatment, and needs to know that people love him, we stole $6000 in child support (it's a warrant issued by the Ramsey County Attorney's office to garnish his wages for back child support) but wants to pay her what he owes her. This isn't counting the $990 he still owes my grandmother for the loan for the obstetritian, half of the $5200 orthodontist bill, and at least half of every medical expense that I had to pay out of my pocket because he was supposed to be responsible for health coverage).  He ends with it being about HIS right to see her (what about her right to have had him in her life all along) and how he wants to be the daddy that she deserves.    OH MY GAWD!  What a selfish bastard!  It's not about what is best for her, it's about what he needs again.  He's depressed, he's lonely, he needs somebody to love him, and the lightbulb goes off... "I have kids, I can use them to validate my need for unconditional love."  Apparently the other two have been back in Minnesota (she had every right to see her brother and sister, but no one thought about that did they?) and he's been seeing them since they only live 5 miles away, but he misses her too and wants to visit like they use to.  At what point can we say ENOUGH?!?!  How many times does he get to do this to her?  Why is it expected that since he decides he wants to play daddy, we have to let him?  Where was he when daddy was needed?  Brian has been the one fixing her meals, getting her ready for school, bringing her to her appointments... doing all the things that a Dad is supposed to do, but that just doesn't matter to him does it?  It's not about what's fair, it's about what he wants, and if it screws us and our lives, well that's just a bonus isn't it.    Why couldn't he have just stayed away... I'd finally gotten Amanda to stop calling him a loser and wishing he was dead.  She was to the point where she could almost feel sorry for him, but she is so upset now she can barely speak.  She's crying one minute and throwing things the next.  And I'm at such a loss.. I don't want to say anything negative about him, but... oh man, I'm so pissed.

						   Just got back from Taste of Minnesota. It was my first time ever and a good day for it.  Not too hot and a nice breeze.  The cost of the food nuts of course, but we tried a couple of new things. we shared a pulled pork tostada which was nice and spicy, some deep-fried oreos that I'll never try again, and some haystack fried onions with garlic sauce which was quite good.  Brian got a Pepsi, and I got a bottle of water.  After spending $20 that left us with 3 tickets.  Brian got a shrimp coctail and we gave 1 ticket away as we left.  We didn't do any of the rides of course, but the trolly shuttle was quite frightening enough. :)

						   I'll love the paycheck, but it sure sucks working Saturday and Sunday on 4th of July Weekend.  Our friend Michael invited us and a few other friends over on Saturday night to enjoy his pool.  Even with the rain it was fun.  I didn't bring my suit so I just sat on the edge of the pool with my feet dangling thinking I wouldn't get too wet.. YAH RIGHT! There were kids in the pool so I got DRENCHED!  Thankfully I remembered that I had one of those neat sheets in the car so I made a little sarong out of it. :)  I started getting really tired so we left around 10 but it was a fun break.  Here's hoping that there will be future fun.

						   My daughter bought herself a new car!  She had bought my grandmothers 89 Escort with all of 26,000 miles on it, but the bottom rusted out finally and she needed some new wheels.  She gave me a call, but didn't let on that she was going to swing by.  I was pretty surprised when she knocked on the door so I knew then that the call was just to make sure we were home. She holds up the keys and asks if I want to see her new toy!  OHMYGAWD!  It was a 2003 Dodge Neon with 16,000 miles on it. She has a 15 YEAR bumper to bumper warranty, 10 years of FREE oil changes and 50 FREE car washes at the Downtowner car wash.  Only $165 a month for 5 years.  What the HEY?  She has a nicer car than I do now! LOL  My mom and Gramma are going to help with the insurance until she gets the call about the job she is CERTAIN she's going to be called to accept on Tuesday, which includes her own office. I can hardly believe it.  I'm so thrilled for her... thought a little scared too... A brand new car at 21 years old... that's a big debt at a young age and I'm concerned that she won't realize just how big of a responsibility it is.

						   What a LONG day! I'd say I'm glad it's Friday, but I'm working tomorrow and Sunday because of the Taste of Minnesota, Grand Excursion, AND the Hmong Sports Festival.  There have been so many MEAN people calling.  I had one person ask me why we allow it.. the 4th of July is an AMERICAN holiday and we should just ship all the "gooks" back.  All because for 2 days, there will be parking on one side of the street only to ensure that emergency vehicles can get through.  Big deal you racist bastard!

						   I received a major compliment today at work. All city vehicles are required to have an envelope with the necessary forms in case they are in an accident with the public. The problem was that the employees didn't always know what to do in case of an accident. So I suggested the idea that we print the steps on the outside of the envelope. I did a prototype and my supervisor liked it so much that they said go ahead and do 200 for all the vehicles in our department. My supervisor's supervisor liked it so much that he showed it to his supervisor, who in turn showed it to the Mayor. The Mayor wants them to be the standard for all the vehicles in the entire city. I can't quite believe it. You know, I'm great at making forms and shit like that, but I don't know how to market that as a skill.. is that actually a job? I would love to have a job that is just making forms. I actually do most of it on my breaks because I just think it's fun.   We also had to make some non-reproducible vendor passes for the upcoming events over the 4th of July, so I said, we should just do them on colored paper with the logo a couple shades darker as a watermark behind the text. They look FABULOUS! I'm just tickled. The really funny thing was when Linda had a really blonde moment. She was annoyed because she printed out one original and copied about 200. She was getting stressed because they had to be done TODAY and she had to start from scratch because the watermark didn't show. So I said "So it works! They can't be copied... perfect!" Oh man was she pissed at herself. It's one of those DUH things that took all my strength NOT to laugh at.

						   I really goofed at work today.  I'm annoying everyone because I keep apologizing.  The issue was resolved, and no one outside of the office will ever know, but man am I disappointed in myself.  I know that accidents happen, but it's MY responsiblity to ensure that Pat knows when the Showmobile is going out so he can schedule staff... giving him one day's notice was just plain bad.  I've been frazzled because people keep retiring, but no one is being hired in their place so I'm now doing to the work that 3 people use to do.  It's a good reason, but not an excuse.  Karen told me to just let it go, but I told her that I just have to beat myself up about it today and I'll be fine tomorrow.   Everyone kept trying to make me laugh and smile, and I think Karen asked me 3 times if I was really ok, or if there was more going on.  She and I have similar personalities... easily forgiving of the mistakes of others, but very tough on ourselves.  Ok.. so now I've "confessed my sin" so I can just enjoy the rest of the evening... pulling weeds!

						   The man I was supposed to meet a couple weeks ago wanted to try it again.  I always believe in giving people a second chance, so I agreed to meet him again yesterday.  Well, I got to sit there waiting again.  He never showed up.... I thought.  I received an apology from him saying that he was there  and saw me (he even described my clothes)  but was too shy and nervous to approach me.   So instead he watches me waiting for him.. How creepy is that?   On the plus side, I found a cute little thing to wear at a party I'm attending at the end of the month and happened upon the Caring Tree at Har Mar Mall.  What you do is take the shopping list of a low income child and buy some of the items that they have requested.  The first card I picked was a little girl named Amanda who is just starting Kindergarten.  When my Amanda was starting Kindergarten funds were pretty tight for us as well, so it really hit home for me.  Other than the standard markers and crayons, she needs a backpack, shoes and uniforms.   I'm so happy that I can buy the things she needs as well as a few things she will enjoy as well.   That is what success is all about I think.   I don't have a lot of money, but I have enough to take care of our needs and to lend a hand to others.

						   I am so tired of the two faced, passive agressive co-workers that I share an office with that I'm ready to quit. I found out today that the two lousy days I had off, all they did was complain about how I have this, or I get that, and how unfair it all is, when to my face they are all smiles.  The final straw was the 3 hole punch. About a month ago, Kathryn asked if I could order her a new 3-hole punch and held up hers with paper jammed in it. I gave her mine which was NOT jammed and asked if she wanted to take mine since it's still pretty sharp. She said "sure" and I thought that was the end of it. About 2 weeks ago, I "won" this stupid oversized 3 hole punch that takes up way too much desk space and that I never used. Last Wednesday, Kathryn asked to borrow it, I told her she could have it because I didn't use it as often as she did, but she said no just to order her one. I told her that it was a door prize at the seminar that the new vendor for office supplies had and I didn't know if I could order it or not. I was off Friday and Monday so when I came back on Tuesday I looked it up and discovered that it was not an authorized purchase. It was a busy day but before I left on Wednesday night, I gave her the one she liked and took back the one she DIDN'T like. She had already gone home and was off Wednesday and Thursday, so she didn't see it until this morning. She thanked me, and I thought that was the end of it.  After work today, Linda says she needs to talk to me, and I find out that Monday, Kathryn told her that I am always ordering nice things for myself, and giving everyone else the rejects. Rita made sure to point out my matching tape and post-it note dispenser and how I even had my own paper cutter. So now I have to explain what happened with the 3-hole punch, how the tape and post-it dispensers were Mother's Day gifts from my kids for the new "office" I'm going to get (just a bigger cubicle when the construction is completed) and that the papercutter was something I picked up from Target when I bought school supplies for Amanda since it was so cheap.  I asked what I'm supposed to do, and am just told to not let it bother me, but how? I have to go to work on Monday, knowing that she thinks I'm so selfish while she's drinking hot cocoa out of the $15 Survivor mug I bought her just for the hell of it and I don't want to give Rita the cute little door hanger I bought for her yesterday... I'm actually having a hard time not setting it on fire!  The thing that really pisses me off is that knowing Kathryn, she probably thinks that I only gave her the 3-hole punch after she complained, not realizing that I had given it to her BEFORE I heard about her complaints because what is most important to me is making sure that everyone else has their needs met, and that I make every effort to ensure that everyone's wants are met as well.

						   I was going to run to Lunds after work today to pick up a treat for my Thursday night, but traffic was bad and I had time to think about the fact that I really couldn't afford it.  So I decided to go back home and turned West onto University from Snelling.  I saw some people with signs, and being a Union member I took a closer look and saw that they were protest signs to shut down the an adult store.  Of course signs that say "Protect our community standards" pisses me off because it makes the assumption that everyone in the community shares THEIR standards.  The only choice I had was to park and go in. :)    A few of the protesters glared at me, and there wasn't a single person in the store but me.  I bought a cute door hanger for Rita who is seriously PMSing right now, and some of those non-peircing nipple rings just for fun.  Lots of movies, toys, clothes that wouldn't fit one of my thighs let alone my body.   When I left I made a big show of having just purchased something in the store, mostly to be "in their face", what happened was totally unexpected.  The traffic on the street had been pretty quiet but busy.  Some cars started honking, so the protesters waved, and one driver shouted, "Not you!  YOU GO GIRL!"  It took me a couple of beats to realize that they were talking about me!  So of course I smiled and waved which got a bunch of other cars to start honking their horns as well with shouts of "WE LIKE HER!"   I encourage everyone in the Metro area to give them some much needed business.  They are located at  urlLink 1607 University Ave, Saint Paul, MN 55104   and are 1/2 block West of Snelling on University.

						   Graduation went quite well.  All dolled up with make-up and NOT jeans and t-shirt, many of Amanda's friend's didn't even recognize her.  The dance was a lot of fun for her too... It was her first dance so I am thrilled she enjoyed it.  There was a bit of teenage drama as two of her friends had a falling out based on some rumors ("sombody said that someone thought they saw..." ) .  I told her that she shouldn't take sides because what someone thinks they saw, or what someone thought someone said, may not be what ACTUALLY happened.  Not that they are lying, but that it could be a simple misunderstanding.   I also told her that it's ok to be understanding and sympathetic of what others are going through, but if there is nothing that she can do to help, she shouldn't let it ruin her fun because on top of feeling bad about the situation, her friend would feel guilty about ruining her fun.  She said that made a lot of sense.  Not only does my daughter think I'm cool, she thinks I'm smart too!

						   We found a nice outfit for Amanda yesterday.  And it didn't cost nearly as much as I thought it would, including shoes and jewelry.... Thank you Fashion Bug!  Brian got home from Chicago and made a killing at the Transformer Convention.  He was able to repay the money I loaned him from last year and this year.  Very nice.   Of course he missed me terribly, and even though it was nice I invited him to sleep with me... not much sleeping, and a couple of new and enjoyable experiences.  Very worth the while.

						   Went to the Rice Street Festival yesterday.  Amanda was in the talent show and was disappointed that she didn't win, but it was a nice day to be outside.  Today was fun too.  We picked up Rae and Kelli and went to see "The Village".  That was one very freaky movie.  It will definately become a cult classic very quickly.  We then went to OCB and as usual when it's the four of us we became the entertainment when I went "knock on wood" while rapping on my head and caused Amanda to shoot milk out her nose... AGAIN!    I don't know what happens when the four of us are together, but it's really crazy.  We went to a number of stores to find a dress for Amanda's graduation.  Nothing really was what she wanted, but did settle on a skirt and top that is nice.  We'll keep looking though... we have to find shoes anyway.  Sunday evening is a bad time to  be shopping since everything closes.  Tomorrow is the last shot, so I'll keep my fingers crossed.  I don't want her to just "settle"... ever.
