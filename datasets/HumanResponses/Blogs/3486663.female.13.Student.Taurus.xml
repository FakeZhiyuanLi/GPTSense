       I laugh Wierd   If you notice I misspelled the word 'weird' up there, good for you. I'm wierd so I spell wierd. Dana calls it 'Katyanese.' I would rather give it a cooler sounding name. Like....Amanstyrelcodaron? Ya I'm good at making up names and stuff. anyway...I was just reading  urlLink Joe's  blog, and I suddenly realised I have a very wierd laugh. Not at all ladylike. Not that I'm very ladylike in the first place, but you know. Its all wierd. All...snorty and stuff. I don't laugh like that with my friends. Only at stuff I read on the net in blogs. I was laughing at someone else's blog too. I forgot who. But it was the same laugh--all wierd and high-pitched and snorting ike a pig. When I read anything else on the net (eg. webcomics) even if they're funny as I still don't alugh that wierd. Okay, so I have a wierd laugh normally too. But its nowhere near as close to that. I would give you a nice recording of it but my laptop's sound recorder doesn't work. :) Be thankful.  PS. I don't care if this is my third post. I don't feel like editing them so that they're all in one nice big post. Okay? Good. Now shut up.

       Teachers have very bad organisational problems   Firstly, my drama play was NOT a disaster. This was mainly because we didn't even DO it. Mrs. Mann, our drama teacher, wasn't there. So we had Mr. Farnesworth. -shudder- The Teacher Of Hell. He told us off for about 15 minutes and then told us to practise on stage. So of course the other three groups go and practise, but the 15 minutes he used to tell us off were supposed to be OUR practise time.  And then, before Art(last period) Freya told me that Siana(someone in my Drama class) had seen Mrs. Mann just then. I was like screaming out every single swear I know (and I know how to swear fully in like three languages: English, Russian and Indonesian, lol) because I PAINTED MY NAILS, MISSED MY NORMAL TRAIN NOT GETTING THE PROPS, BROUGHT THREE COSTUMES FOR SOMEONE WHO TURNED OUT NOT TO BE THERE EVEN and actually fucking MEMORISED almost everyones lines!!!  I am soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo pissed now.   If you can't figure out the title of this post, (which you probably can't) I'll probably mention it in some other one later.   MSN Problems   This girl and I have been doing this RP on MSN. So now we kinda grind to a halt in the storyline and we decide to add another character, preferably a male because we both RP as female characters. I've already mentioned my disability to RP as males. Well now I will mention my disability to RP as more than one character. There is one single exeption, and that is my wierd ice myrmidion Kerinjoren. He's just wierd. so I can do him. Anyway. So now we're stuck. If, by some amazing chance, a LITERATE, Medieval/Fantasy RPer comes along and reads this, my MSN is mystiknest@hotmail.com. Or just if you happen to know a literate Medieval/Fantasy RPer. Either way. Please? -tilts head and gives cute-pathetic-puppydog look to world of RPers-

       Bloodbath   This morning I woke up in a huge puddle of blood. My leg was bleeding again. The cut's like totally small but it bleeds SO MUCH. I cut my leg when I was shaving. My razor...its like totally messed. I really really want an electric one. My current razor catches on my skin all the time. Its no wonder I'm so skinny even though I eat about five times as much as the average person--I probably lose so much blood the food doesn't count. o.o   Bugs   I had this horrible itch on my back today. It was like in the middle of my back, and UNDER MY DAMN BRA. That of course makes me really suspicious. Tash once had this bug in her bra and she didn't even know until she tried to scratch it. It was one of those huge black ones, the freaky ones. It was at my house. I think its still lying squashed on the floor. It wasn't a bug but I got very annoyed. It's really itchy and hard to reach. Shit.   More RP Tragedies   HE WAS MAKING MY CHARACTER DO STUFF IN HIS POST!!! Whatever that's called. Either way, HE USED MY CHARACTER!!! I am soooooo pissed, because this leaves her in exactly the same position as before pretty much. Men are total idiots.   Macca's is totally fucked   I had to get maccas for my drama thing. So I miss my normal train in the morning and totally kill myself trying to get to maccas before the next train leaves. AND THEN I FIND OUT THEY ONLY HAVE BREAKFAST MEALS!!! I am sooooo pissed. Again.

       Tiny Teh Tiger   I'm assuming that anyone who reads this will be a huge fan of Crash Bandicoot. The game, I mean. Because if you're not, jsut skip ahead to the next story. But this is funny. If you don't understand it read it anyway.  Tiny the tiger is now the centre of my world. Heck, my universe even. TINY THE TIGER ROCKS.  The female parent got me one of those cursed packs of various chips and stuff. You know, the ones that ALWAYS have some promotional toy thing? Well...yeah. Out of boredom, I took the toy out, and it HAPPENED to be TINY THE TIGER!!! -huggles Tiny- Umm...yeah. Since then I have been collecting Tiny stuff.  Anyway, this morning I was doing my nails. WOW I hear you say sarcastically. Yeah. So interesting. either way, so I was doing my nails. I just covered them with a transparent coat to make them all shiny and then painted the tips metallic blue. Its so cool, over half of my nails are now blue. Yeah, my nails are long. I dunno how I manage to type. Of course I have to take it off tomorrow for damn school but so waht.   Weather Options   It was SO fucking freezing this morning. Still is, actually. Really, God should let us choose what the weather will be every day.  So I was just sitting there still in my PJs doing my nails in the fucking freezing cold of the non-snowing Australian winter.   Harry Potter 3Harry Potter 3   That is NOt a typo. I have to see Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban twice in a row. First is on Saturday, in two weeks. Nicola's bday party. Bday movie rather. So I have to go then. And then with Tracey the day after, because Tracey can't go. And I thought I wouldn't be able to go so I offered to go with Tracey. Now I discover I CAN go but I'm still sdtuck going with Tracey and Dana the day after. And Dan's friend, Steph.   Intermission: Friend Bio   Nicola: Half-Chinese. In my opinion she smiles too much. She's happy too much. But wtf. She's my friend. :) -huggles huge group of friends-   The Tragedies of Drama(And being tall)   We have Drama first period tomorrow. We have to do a play. I didn't practise my lines and I have one of the main parts. I need to put my costume together tonite. I only found this out right now right after I had finished typing the Intermission. omigoshwhythefuckdidntanyonetellmebeforewewonthavetimetopractiseourlineswhatifsomeoneslatewhatiftheymakeusgofirstgghasntpractisedtheemotioninhermostimportantlinewhatiflottydoesntwanttodoitagain?  I need black pants. GG told me I could borrow her size 12 ones. I was like, size *12*??? I'm like size *16*. Note the difference there. And then I NEED BLACK SHOES. I dont have any. No one who has any is in my size. FUCKFUCKFUCKFUCK. GG is the only person who I have the msn of. Shes a midget. FUCKFUCKFUCKFUCKLFUCK. I am SO Doomed.   Now the tragedies of RPing   I'm doing this RP on Warriors Realm and this guy just DECIDED to make his character go out cold. This totally wrecks anything I could have been hoping to do(eg, fight finally?) and leaves me in a position where my character can't really do anything except be all 'girly.' She's only like part of a species that is totally warriorness, like. She's like me only I don't fight, I just draw blood. -drooling fangs-  Its totally ruined. Just when I managed to get the storyline going again he brings it to a total halt. Now I have no idea what to write. I am at a loss.   So go  urlLink HERE  and read it all. I am of course the lovely Mystik Drake. If you go to the second page you will see my amazing storyline-boost and his total storyline-kill.

      If you are one of the staff of Blogger and you are reading this, I would like you to know: I SIGNED UP FOR  BLOGSPOT  NOT BLOGGER.  anyway.  Origin of my name  I'm Kitty. Well, my name isn't technically Kitty. Its Yekaterina. Since no one could say that, we shortened it to Katya. People still have trouble pronouncing it and I got tired of telling them that its pronounced 'ka-dee-ah' not 'cat-sha.' So then that is shortened to Kat, and my friends call me Kitty because I'm lazy, have claws, hiss when annoyed and/or angry, sleep and eat a lot, and scratch people like a cat. (The creature.) So...yeah.   The Outback Kitty  I am...me. I have BROWN hair(ha to all you people that say its dark blonde!) and blue-grey eyes that randomly change colour slightly(not because of the light.) I am a 13-year-old wierdo. TWO whole people have told me I'm cool though. and to MY FACE!!! As in, in real life not on the computer. :) One was some wierdo guy who had a crush on me years ago. (He's a year younger than me and a midget. why do I get stuck with the wierd guys?) The second was my friend, Sam. As in [Sam]antha, if you were wondering. -_- But that was probably because I read her future once. But now my Tarot cards are gone. :(   Origins of my Name[2]  Did you know that there are three possible places my name could have come from: (a) Yekaterina, the person, a really really famous Tsarina once in Russia(yeah I'm Russian. Get over it.) (b) St. Yekaterina, some saint in Russia. (c) (Yeah, you can laugh here. Just finish the whole sentence first.) Yekaterinburg, the city, in Russia once again, which is highly doubtful but then my friend said that me getting into a private school was highly doubtful and here I am at Loreto Mandeville Hall, private school.  Actaully my dad told me that I was named after choice (a) there. So...yeah. I don't know much about her other than she was really really famous and she was a ruler of a really really huge country. (Have you seen the size of Russia? Whoa)   Friends are a Girl's Best Friend......sometimes, anyway   Um...so that you know what I talk about later, here are a few of my friends and the ex-friend that all-to-often rings me up. If I mention anyone who is not here in later posts I will explain about them there.  Tracey: A Vietnamese midget. She has black hair and...um...dark eyes? (I've never bothered to look, I've been too busy reading) She loves the Tamora Pierce books almsot as much as I do and we drive Freya crazy talking about them on the way home on the train. Its so funny when I stand next to her because I'm this huge skinny giant and she's...a midget.  Freya: I am SO lucky to have a friend named after a goddess! They even look alike only Freya(the one that I know) doesn't have red hair like Freya(the goddess). She had brownish hair. She walks really really fast. She takes the train home with Tracey. And me of course.  Tash(Natasha): Another midget. Really really small. Even for a midget she's small. I love standing next to her. Its so funny to look down at people.  GG(Actually Georgie but her nickname is Gigi so I shorten it to GG): Not really a midget but still small. She comes up to my nose. I know because we were doing this thing for health and GG was the only one who remembered the exact height she was so we were all measuring against her to roughly figure out our height. (Don't ask)  Chelsea: The ex Friend. I've known her since my fourth day of prep(unfortunately) She used to be my friend, or at least I THOUGHT she was my friend. she is just a bitch. She is a tryhard. And I swear, she calls me up just to brag or tease or annoy me. Here is an example of the last conversation we had, on my birthday(7th May):  Kitty(answers the phone while pigging out on chips): Hello? Chelsea: Happy birthday! (in singsong voice that immediately tells K that she will be complaining annoyingly) K: Oh...um...thanks...(frantically tries to think of a way out of this conversation) C: (in an annoyingly accusing voice) You didn't call me earlier this week, when it was MY birthday. (by unlucky chance, b an unlucky alignment of the planets, her birthday is four days before mine. If you're realy stupud and can't figure it out, that's the third of May.) K: Oh...uh...sorry. I...got my second holes done on Sunday so I was kinda excited on Monday(her birthday this year was on monday. she called me on thursday after school) So I was kinda, you know...(whew. I did actually get my second holes :) and before she, the copybitch, did.) C: Oh. whatever. anyway, I was talking to James, and he said that he doesn't hate you. But I think I should have introduced Nicole to him instead. She's more normal. (The person that made up soemthing called the 'hairy chicken dance' is supposedly normal?)  I think you can imagine the rest of the conversation. James is some guy from her new school, I met him. He's a midget, even smaller than chelsea, who is like half my height (this is the part where i LIKE being so damn tall) Nicole is a girl from my, chelsea,s and Dana's primary school. we used to be really good friends until chelsea intervened.  Dana(the maths freak): Okay. Dana was and is my best friend. I've known her since like year 2 or something. She's chinese. And really skinny. Liek a stick. Even skinnier than me. We are best friends because I am a spelling freak and she's a maths freak. We're both above average students, we both got academic scholarships to private schools this year. We both got the hgihest scholarship our schools give. (I got a 50% she got a full because my schools really snobby with scholarships and they dont have full ones. sucky huh.) We both go to(or used to go to) saturday schools: her chinese school, me russian school. We both quit now. We're both wierd. Her nicknames are Dan(that's pronounced dahn by the way) and DNA. I call her DNA because I was playing around with name anagrams once(forgot what they're called, you know, where you mess up their names to make a new name?) And I accidently forgot the first A and so I call her DNA now, partly bcoz of that artly because she's aa maths freak. She calls me Kat. I am so happy she's stopped calling me KTY. Don't ask.

       ...  I saw the third movie! How sweet was it! ^^     Only the hippogriff really pissed me off. They used a HORSE for the ground scenes, but since the front half of a hippogriff is a bird, and bird's legs bend the opposite way to horses legs, it was just really unnatural.  Tracey and I were annoying everyone else. We both changed our school notebook desktops to the photo above. -squeal-

       Curtain Ties   Okay. Before you read this, steel yourself for my wierdness. You already know that I am like a human cat-reincarnate. Well. Now that comes to a new level. You know those curtain-ties with the cool little silky tassels on the end? Well...yeah. I LOVE to play with those things. And string. Like cats. Like my namesake. I really MUST BE a cat reincarnate. Go me. >^-^<

       Meep   This morning I wke up late because I forgot to put my mobile alarm on. I woke up at 6:55am. And it was STILL fucking freezing. I was like hopping around squealing 'ow, ow, ow,' while trying to get dressed. And my lovely warm finger gloves are gone. Well one is at least. That's not good. If you leave at 7:15 in the morning just to get my 7:30 train. And its fucking so cold then. My hands are still half-numb from this morning because I couldn't wear my gloves. I mean, really, who would wear one single fucking glove?   Sticks and Stones.........and large heavy flying objects...   I am wierd. If you haven't noticed. GG called me an annoying bitch last night on MSN because I told her that I called her GG instead of Gigi. I was like, 'Lol, whatever!'  I find it funny when people swear. And when people insult me. Its just so fucking funny. Even as I speak Tash is sitting next to me totally telling HER laptop to fuck off. My laptops more messed than hers but *I* don't swear at it. Right now she's stomping her feet on the ground and screaming 'you cunt' at her Alex the Alligater game. I personally think it's totally lame, but you know. She's a midget. She's allowed to be lame.   Art Requests   I have like a million things to do for people. Like a million art requests. Really I should start doing commissions but the female parent won't let me. So anyway. I have this long list of stuff my friends want me to do.   Lotus Dragon   I finished this last night. IT started out as a random sketch but I liek how it turned out. It was originally going to be sitting in a little lotus flower and I decided to use a photo for that but I can't find a good one. So...yah.

      I read somewhere that if you ask most people how to get somewhere, even if they know exactly what they're talking about, they'll most likely just give you this long involved explanation and then keep going on and on about it, and then just randomly finish with, 'and...yeah...' Not that anyone really cares but I felt like writing it down even though I read it like three years ago.

      I havent posted for ages. I've been busy...playing DMC, finishing DMC twice, getting told I should become a forensics expert because of my uncanny interest in death and killing people...etc. My friend got Devil May Cry (second-hand) and the game manual smells like tea. So I got to borrow it, and finished it twice in a single weekend. Yay for Easy Automatic mode! I did try Normal mode...but I missed the rapid-fire you get to use in EA mode.
