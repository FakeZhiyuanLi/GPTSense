      I was disappointed to hear the classic Rolling Stones’ song, “You Can’t Always Get What You Want”, used to hawk Coke’s new product, Coca-Cola 2. Do the Stones really need any more money? I know it’s not the first time the Stones sold out to hawk products but this was always a favorite song of mine. It’s an excellently produced song that always gave me that special feeling inside whenever I heard it growing up. Everyone has songs that move him or her inside. I remember seeing them live in 1989 at Shea Stadium (Back then people were wondering when they were going to retire). I remember feeling that tingle well up in me when I heard the French horn accompany the acoustic guitar in the intro. The emotions that it conjures up are amazing. That’s the power of music. Now the song is heard over this ultra-slick footage with action that matches titles that appear on the screen that say; you can’t choose your parents, you can’t choose the weather, you can’t jump the line, etc., but now you can have half the carbs. I guess that’s what the song was about all along. Now the song is cheapened. It looses it’s meaning to me. They also use Queen’s “I Want to Break Free” for another spot. I remember when the song came out around 1984. I didn’t really think too much about it then but listening to it now I think it’s a pretty good song. Too bad it’s in this commercial.  Of course advertisers have been using popular music for years to sell their crap to convince us to be free, unique and an individual if only we use their products. Some people might say what’s the big deal anyway. The big deal is that this music that I covet was something that I could make my own. The music and melodies of songs speak to people in different ways. You can identify with sounds and lyrics that make a particular song unique for you. Everything changes when songs like “Blitzkrieg Bop” by The Ramones, begin to sell Budweiser beer. Songs of counterculture and rebellion are now used to sell lousy beer. The songs that once put out the middle finger to this shit, have become part of Madison Avenue. I’m not naïve. Obviously it works to use celebrities and things familiar with consumers, such as songs, to help sell products. In the 80’s The California Raisins had big success when they used the popular Marvin Gaye song “I Heard it Through the Grapevine”. The sales of raisins dramatically went up. I only knew Carly Simon’s song, “Anticipation”, as the Heinz Ketchup song. There is no way that they wouldn’t at least try to use the most popular songs or artists to sell stuff. Back in the 1980’s, Eric Clapton reworked his “After Midnight” song for Miller beer and stared in the commercials as well. Songs by groundbreaking bands like The Clash and The Buzzcocks just don’t seem edgy when they’re used to sell cars. You wouldn’t think these bands would be the first choice to help sell, sell, sell but their fans are now in their forties and probably less idealistic. Iggy Pop’s “Lust for Life” has been used countless times to sell many different things. Nike used The Beatles “Revolution” to sell its sneakers. Paul McCartney didn’t want them to use it, but Michael Jackson owned the rights so there was nothing he could do. However there was such a public outcry for using the song that Nike eventually went in another direction. I don’t believe a Beatle’s song has been used since. It’s interesting to note that McCartney didn’t like the use of his songs for selling wares but allowed songs of Buddy Holly’s, of which he owns the rights, to be used in commercials.   The artist, of course, can always choose not to sell their rights to advertisers. REM did not want Microsoft to use their song “It’s The End of the World as We Know It” for the release of Microsoft Windows 95. Instead they went with The Rolling Stones’ “Start Me Up”. So it must come down to money. For The Stones’ latest commercial, I’m thinking that Coca-Cola made an offer that they couldn’t refuse. And I don’t mean they would have put a horse’s head in each one of the Stones’ beds had they refused. I mean that it probably was too good a deal to pass up, especially when you think all they had to do was nothing, except to have written and recorded this song over 30 years ago. Any one familiar with The Who’s songs knows that in the past 5 years there has been a plethora of their songs used in commercials, movies and TV. Pete Townshend must have realized the money to be made in allowing people to use your music for whatever. I’m sure he can demand a hefty price for his impressive catalogue of music.   If you’re an artist that has had a one hit wonder and someone wants to use your music to sell something, of course they’ll probably do it. They need the money. A perfect example is Survivor’s “Eye of the Tiger” which was a big hit and the theme song to Rocky III, back in’83. Not only did they let Starbucks use the song but they reworked the lyrics and starred in the commercial as well. But that’s such a lesser song. A song like that might have well been written exclusively for a commercial anyway. But the Rock ‘n’ Roll elite seems to be the most popular choices these days. If a David Bowie or Led Zeppelin song is used in commercials, the advertisers are going after that huge fan base but it also benefits these artist because after all music is a product too, and a popular ad campaign could result in increased sales of their music.  So where does this leave us? I know that compared to things going on today’s turbulent world this doesn't really matter. There are certainly more important things to focus on than this. If an artist wants to sell the rights to their song, that’s their business, regardless of how much I like it. But I’m glad that there are still artists who only want their music to be listened to for the music, not to be grouped with selling cool to the masses by way of drinking the right cola. In one of their songs Public Enemy’s Chuck D raps “if we sell out, then we’ll get the hell out”. Maybe years after the ad campaign for C2 has gone, I can reclaim the song as my own again and the memory of the association with soda will be gone. I guess I should be grateful, after all they could have used this song to sell diarrhea medicine.

      Well it was only two days ago that I talked about how the US Army finally denied Halliburton 15% of their invoices because they could not account for all of our tax money they billed us for. I was satisfied because at least they were being called for what seemed like obvious mismanagement and fraud, but it didn't last long. Yesterday the army, for the third time, waived that rule. According to Linda Theis,  a spokeswoman for the Army Field Support Command,  "I just got a phone call putting on hold the 15% withhold clause implementation, and I don't know why or any of the particulars". Probably what happened is that some big wigs of Halliburton gave old Dick Cheney a call and said what's all this bullshit. Then Cheney had some one deal with it which resulted in call to Linda Theis. Who's really in charge anyway? The stink gets worse.

      When I think back to the times when I was in school and I learned about all these different invading hordes in Europe (Huns, Vikings, Moors etc,) raping and pillaging different lands or in more modern times, Europe's colonization of the rest of the world (Africa, Asia, South America), I would think that we live in a much better time where that no longer happens. After all America is a beacon of hope to the world. As I got older I began to understand this was not the case. In the last couple of years, however, it’s become apparent that the reality is much worse. The realization that we are an imperialist country doing whatever we want without any regard for world opinion has been a harsh, bitter pill to swallow.   The imperialism actually never stopped but today it's more prevalent and insidious than ever before with the US leading the way. I was definitely naive as a lot of people are still naive today. They don't believe or wish to believe that America is guilty of any thing because we are America. They don’t want to believe we are imperialistic as the countries and hordes in those history books. The more people who stay naive the harder it will be to have a country that is a true democratic society that is really a beacon to the world. These people will believe what the government tells them, as our leaders do what they want with our tax money but always paint a picture that whatever they do is in our best interest, whether fighting the war on terror or “modernizing” Medicare.  I do believe it's important to mention that there are also a lot of people in this country, along with different organizations, who really do care about what goes on here and the rest of the world and try to do what they can through volunteer work, financial aid and other humanitarian efforts. It is people associated with the Bush Government, big business and the military industrial complex, which has helped give America two black eyes and a fat lip. It’s self will run riot.  There is so much war profiteering going on in Iraq it’s obscene. Total privatization, with billions and billions of taxes dollars going to different well connected big corporations.  These corporations deal in rebuilding Iraq (including military bases), provide mercenaries for security, and a host of other things the army used to do. There is such little oversight in the ways these companies operate and do business. There are many criminal investigations into the fleecing of the American taxpayer by these corporations and no one seems to be talking about it. There is mismanagement, theft and greed. Employees of these companies are not held to the same standards that seem to get in the way of Bush and company from doing what they want to do. Soldiers of fortune are not bound by any of the international laws demanding fair treatment of world citizens. There is serious conflict of interests as former political aides and other government employees now have financial ties to the imperialistic operations in Iraq. There are all these special conferences headed by well-connected people that tell these companies about the opportunities in Iraq. It would help these companies greatly if they the made some significant campaign contributions to their senators, congress people and political party. No free rides here. Opponents of the war said before our invasion that this was all about money. If it wasn’t, our government should have gone out of their way to show to the world it was not about money or oil but it was about humanitarian reasons and the liberation of Iraq. The US has not shown the world that.   If these companies stand to make billions and billions on invading countries, it’s reasonable to believe (and I do) that’s these same countries would and could influence our leaders that they should invade Syria or Iran or evil Venezuela with all that oil in the hands of a lefty. It does not matter if their financial interests jive with the best interests of the American people or whatever citizens in whatever country we help “liberate”. The top levels of government, heads of huge corporations and big wigs at the Pentagon are interchangeable as former CEO’s become vice presidents, secretaries of state become consultants to big firms and it goes on and on. They all have the same interest, no matter what field or position they’re in. Money. They will not want to give up that money and they will do whatever they can to keep their shithooks deep inside all these world resources to ensure that the money never stops. It’s all just modern day rape and pillaging.

       Governor McGreevey needs to stop down now or an appropriate time  for an interim governor to be brought up to speed, like  maybe two weeks. McGreevey said himself on Thursday that the circumstances around his affair with a man, Golan Cipel, and its effects on his family threatened to undermine his “ability to govern.”  If that's the case that why his he waiting for Nov 15th to officially step down? The reason is he wants to leave office in November is because it would allow Democratic Senate President Richard J. Codey to finish the term, instead of having a special election to elect someone to finish out his term which ends in 2006. That is not fair to the people of New Jersey, whether republican or democrat.  Had it just been an extramarital affair, I would believe that he shouldn't have to step down immediately or at all for that matter. It does not matter to me if it was a homosexual affair. But there's a lot more than that. First it's turning into a he said he said thing. Governor McGreevey has said it was a consensual affair and later McGreevey's people said that the other man, Cipel, was trying to extort millions of dollars from the governor. Cipel has said he is heterosexual and that he was the victim of repeated sexual advances and that it was the governor's camp that offered him hush money. Both scenarios are possible. Also Cipel, who is an Israeli, was named by McGreevey to be the director of homeland security for the state of New Jersey in 2002. This caused a lot of controversy as lawmakers felt this person was not experienced enough for the $110,000 a year job. Just these facts alone would make it hard for McGreevey to govern effectively and 3 months is just too long govern uneffectively. Democrats have been worried that other allegations might see the light, further hurting the governor's credibility. Charles Kushner, a top Democratic campaign contributor who gave more than $1 million dollars to McGreevey's campaign,  plead gulity today to things such as witness retaliation, tax fraud and making false statements, a total of 18 Counts. Prosecutor's have said McGreevey has nothing to do with their investigation of Kushner.  It's bad timing at best. Things like this, though, can cause the flood gates to open and not only drown McGreevey but also the New Jersey democratic party. He should not drag this out as his counterpart in Connecticut, Governor John Rowland,  has done.   Maybe McGreevey's innocent of any wrongdoing or maybe he's not. One thing is for sure, McGreevey brought this on himself.

      Halliburton was denied additional time to tell the US army where the hell all our tax dollars have gone. The way it works is that government contractors cannot be paid more than 85% of their innvoices until the account for their costs. This rule had already been waived twice for Halliburton and it's subsidiary, Kellog, Brown & Root.   A spokeswoman for Halliburton, Wendy Hall, said that company officials thought they had an extension "based on clear oral assurances from senior Pentagon representatives." She also said "we believe these issues will be resolved in our favor." Ms. Hall also had to mention this audit question is only gaining media attention because it's an election year. I love when people just throw that into the mix. It must be part of their "press release templates". However, because of the contracts they have with their subcontractors, Halliburton will withhold payments to them. At least, though, Halliburton was finally called to task for their creative bookeeping in Iraq. Creative bookeeping at our expense mind you. Last week Halliburton was also fined 7.5 million, a mere drop in the bucket for them, by the SEC for their creative account practices that tried to boost its profits back in 1998, when Cheney was CEO. Cheney was not implicated in the SEC's findings. He was only the CEO.  How about this? A former CEO of major defense contractor now a hawkish vice president. That same company now has the 8 billion in contracts in Iraq, some of them being no-bid contracts. One should also note that Halliburton has contributed almost $800,000 in the past 4 years, 95% to republicans. Like I often say, just follow the money. Halliburton is also the largest recepient of contracts in Iraq. They have also been a company that has been accused by members of congress of overcharging and overspending, most notably Rep. Henry Waxman of California. Rep Waxman has definately been a thorn in the side of the Bush Administationin, the now defunct CPA in Iraq and major contractors such as Halliburton. But it's very difficult work because when a major corporation has ties to the very top levels of government, as Halliburton does, it's going to be hard for others, both in and out of government, to hold them accoutable for there actions.  There are people who are against welfare and other programs that assist other people in need , because they claim they are cheats, you know, the "welfare queens". These same people should be outraged tenfold then that tax dollars are going to big conglomerate corporations like Halliburton, with their offshore tax shelters, that are padding the bill and moving numbers around.

      Today President Bush, speaking at the Veterans of Foreign Wars Convention in Cincinnati, talked about a plan to redeploy 70,000 troops over 10 years. But he also talked about, once again, his defense of invading Iraq. He said, concerning the missing WMDs, "Knowing what I know today, I would have taken the same action." So is he saying that if he knew there were no WMDs and all the other chemical and biological agents, in other words Saddam was not an imminent or immediate threat, he would have still invaded Iraq. How would he have gotten his policy to invade Iraq across to to the people of the US? There was still Afghanistan and Osama was still at large. That was our most immediate threat. Maybe, in the fear after 9/11, he could start by saying that Saddam was linked to the terrorists. He could start mentioning Saddam, 9/11 and Osama bin-Laden in the same sentence over and over again. Hell, he might as well just start saying that he does have weapons of mass destruction. After all he would have invaded if he had them or not, so as to make it a better sell, just say he has this ridiculous amount weapons ready to be used against us. It would be for our own good anyway.    It is not a stretch at all to suggest that maybe they knew there were no WMD's in Iraq but wanted to invade the country, not to bring democracy in the middle east but to control corporate interests. Who's making money in Iraq today?  That's one way to look at it. Another way is to look at how the post invasion was handled. There was no plan once mission was accomplished. Even if you believed that we would be greeted with flowers and candy, you'd still have to plan for everything, especially in a turbulent place like Iraq.  You always have to ask yourself, what if? No their main objective was to get into Iraq and build hi-tech, state of the art military bases. We know that the neo-conservative group Project for a New American Century, has wanted to invade Iraq since before Bush II. They talked about military domination in order to bring stability in that region. They believed that we must police the world. We would become this imperialist empire. Some of the members of that group now hold top positions in this administration such as; Vice President Cheney, Defense Secretary Rumsfeld and Asst. Defense Secretary Wolfowitz.    Bush also mentioned that now Iraq has a strong leader and if we were to leave Iraq(as Kerry says is his plan) it will send "the wrong message to the Iraqi people who (will) wonder whether or not America means what it says". The Iraqi people do not want us there. They are not sitting around and hoping that we stay. They believe the current interim Iraqi leader, Ayad Allawi is but an American puppet. There is chaos and depression through out Iraq today.  Why shouldn't the Iraqi people believe we are only in out for their resources and that those military bases will be a place where American muscle will be flexed at will whenever we deem it neccesary.  Despite all of Bush's talk about spreading peace and freedom, it doesn't seem to be working. Serving the ideal of liberty, as Bush said, will bring hope to others and make America safer. I agree but we're not serving that ideal very well. There is less peace. Bush also said , "We have an historic opportunity to win the war on terror by spreading freedom and peace". He had an excellent opportunity. It was right after 9/11, when the world was in solidarity with us. A true leader would have seen that but Bush and company had other plans.  As long as Bush continues to say that America is safer without Saddam in power, as long as he states he would have invaded Iraq regardless of WMD's or not, as long as he mentions he's bringing peace and freedom to Iraq, I'm going to call him on it.

      That's the term that George H W Bush used to describe Reagan's trickle-down economic policies while they were still both vying for the republican nomination for president back in 1980. Today George W Bush's economic policies are Voodoo economics in the extreme, with some Santeria mixed in. Now I'll admit I'm no economic genius with all it's nuances and complexities, but Bush's adamant insistence to make his tax cuts permanent are ridiculous. According to a report by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office to be published today, one-third of President Bush's tax cuts in the last three years have gone to people with the top 1 percent of income. Bush sold the tax cuts by saying they would get us out of the recession and that people would have more money to help pursue the American dream. But here's what's going today. The U.S. budget deficit will hit a record $445 billion this year. The number of declared bankruptcies and home foreclosings are at record highs. More families are carrying more debt, through credit cards, in order to make ends meet. Bush says the economy is strong and that we've turned the corner( I don't know what street this corner is on) but it has not translated to prosperity for most of us. There is more profit being made but wages have not increased. So the idea of trickle-down economics does not seem to be the case. All these tax breaks for the top tier has not been reinvested in factories, new employees or whatever. Big companies are only concerned with making as much profit as possible. As you know they have a responsibility to the shareholders.  The report also mentioned that people at the bottom got an average of $250. That has some republicans saying that the tax cuts are benefiting everyone and we're all better off than before. Yes, I agree. We're so much better off than during the horrible Clinton years when we were all in financial chaos (I'm kidding of course). How far is that $250 going to go? States are getting less money so they're raising taxes. The price of milk and gas are at all times highs. The money that pays for government programs is no longer available, so they have been cut. I support government programs that help people financially as well as programs like assisted day care and Head Start. We live in a rich country and I think there should be a safety net. Do people abuse the system. Yes I'm sure. That is no reason to cut programs. Reagan put the idea of the cheating "Welfare Queen" in a lot of people's heads . Anyone on welfare is cheating or bad or it's their own fault. They don't like the idea of welfare. What about corporate welfare? What about corporations getting huge tax breaks or maybe opening Bermuda tax shelters? What about big business cheating the system? Look at Enron accounting techniques and their rape of California. Quit ridiculous. There are people who can't pay bills and have no health insurance. I'm for paying taxes for these things that would help people. I'm not for paying taxes in to a black hole called Iraq. Remember when selling the war the Bushites said it could be done on the cheap. Iraq oil would help defray our costs. Now we're in the hole for $130 billion and there seems no end in sight. Some of the biggest contractors in Iraq have been accused of padding the bill. 27,000 defense contractors owed a combined $3 billion in taxes in 2002. Some of the theft was as simple as contractors not forwarding the payroll taxes they take out of their employees checks to the federal government. These companies though, continue to get paid by the department of defense. Who here is getting a free ride?  Of course some people believe the real reason behind these tax breaks is to starve the beast. But it's not getting starved. There's more spending. Even some prominent republicans, like Senentor McCain, have criticised these economic policies. "All we're called upon to do is not spend our nation into bankruptcy while our soldiers risk their lives," McCain suggested. "I fondly remember a time when real Republicans stood for fiscal responsibility. Apparently those days are long gone for some in our party." We have to get rid of this idea that permanent tax cuts and constant deficit spending are going to make our economy, a strong economy for everyone. The best way to do that is to get rid of Bush November 2nd.

      The Swift Boat Veterans for Truth (SBVT)are deplorable. Though these veterans are coming out against Kerry and the veracity of his heroism on the day of March 13, 1969, I blame the Bush Republicans(not regular republicans) for the smear campaign. Just as the heroism and Vietnam service of John McCain and Max Cleland was not only questioned but disputed by republican lies, so goes John Kerry's. Now some some say this attack has nothing to do with the White House. I disagree. The White House has not condemned these adds and SBVT is financed by 3 Bush cronies in Texas. The Men in SBVT never served with Kerry on his swift boat. The man who's life Kerry saved, Jim Rassmann, expains in his side of the  urlLink story  how Kerry saved his life. Jim had fallen overboard off of Kerry's swift boat when their boat had hit a mine on the Mekong River. Jim was in the water taking enemy fire from the banks of the river. Kerry eventually turned his boat around and, exposing himself to hostile gun fire, pulled Jim in. As a result he recommended Kerry for the Silver star although Kerry ending up with the Bronze Star with Combat V for his valor for his efforts. This is what happened. Now, however, we are told that this is all lies, a fabrication.  There are so many things in the Bush Administration that are Orwellian and this swift boat crap reminds me of his classic book, Animal Farm. In Animal Farm when Mr. Jones and his cronies try to retake control of his farm, they are defeated in the battle of the cowshed. Snowball, the idealistic pig, show's courage and bravery during this conflict and is awarded for his service. As the novel progresses, Snowball and the other pig, Napoleon, begin to disagree on how things should be on the farm. Then Napoleon sicks the dogs on Snowball, runs him off the farm and takes full totalitarian control. Then with the help of Squealer, another pig, Napoleon uses propaganda that suggests that Snowball cowered in a corner during the battle of the cowshed and the fact he received an award for his bravery was but a myth. Then Snowball is blamed for all the ills of the farm under Napoleon. Aren't we lucky to have our own Animal Farm/1984 in Bush.  Not only are these SBVT's sickening but so are the pundits and politicos who support it and the columnists who insist that Kerry must disprove these claims although his valor has been on record for 35 years now. This is not like Bush and his disputable Air National Guard service. The records that people have been asking for that would put the rest this issue have not been presented by Bush. Though these issues are similar in terms of military service they are different. Basically Bush won't admit he got a free ride and got out of Vietnam service. Instead he spent half the time in The Texas Air National Guard and the other half pursuing other interests such as liquor and drugs. Now I would not hold it against Bush if he said I was messed up back then and I couldn't fufill my duty. Instead he says he served honorably. This issue is compounded by the fact that Bush is asking our present day soldiers to put their lives on the line but when he was called upon to do the same, he did not and he was pro Vietnam War. In fact none of those at the top who were so hell bent to invade Iraq have served in the military, (Cheney, Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz). This Kerry attack is just another example of outright lies by Bush and Co. Bush's dubious military record can't compare to Kerry's distinguished military record so, like Squealer, Bushites will say up is down and black is white.  Lies, lies, lies... they're gonna get you.  Thanks to John McCain for continuing to come to Kerry's defense in condemning these SBVT attacks.

      Last month in Iowa, President Bush said he doesn’t want to be the “war” president; he wants to be the “peace” president. During that speech he listed off his accomplishments during the past four years: the liberation of Iraq and Afghanistan, The Medicare bill, No Child Left Behind Act and his tax cuts. All of these can be rigorously debated as to whether they’re accomplishments or not. Then Bush said that he has made America safer the past four years and if elected another term he will make it even safer. So the conclusion is that if Senator Kerry is elected he will, in addition to raising taxes hundreds of times, make America less safe.  So now we see the next strategies for the Bush campaign, a vote for Kerry is a vote for the terrorists and Bush is about Peace. Not everyone in the Bush campaign is as literal as the terrorist statement suggests. Pro-Bush people have been more subtle in talking about how Kerry will be soft on terrorism but others such as Vice President Cheney have said in the past if Bush loses the election the terrorist will have won. In the Kentucky GOP someone, we don’t know who, is responsible for making and distributing bumper stickers that says, “Kerry is bin-Laden’s man, Bush is mine”. The GOP said they don’t agree with that statement and will make sure no more of these bumper stickers are distributed. But it’s already out there. Look for other similar statements in the up-coming months coming from a conservative pundit here a GOP congressman there. Repetition is one of the most important weapons in Bush’s presidency. Just look at all the people who believe Saddam had a hand in 9/11. Now this technique will be used against Kerry in this campaign and people will believe that if he is elected the terrorists will cheer, as they will be able to expand their agenda of America’s destruction much more easily. It’s quit ridiculous that opponents of Kerry want people to believe that bin-Laden is in a cave some where studying the candidates and coming to a conclusion that Kerry is exactly who he wants in the White House in order to bring the destruction of the United States.  Yes the peace president has made us much safer. After invading Afghanistan, Bush diverted many resources, such as soldiers and intelligence gathering, to go after Iraq in a pre-emptive strike in order to stop Saddam and his vast cache of WMDs. As a result, al-Queda was not stopped and was able to regroup. Once in Iraq, we basically became a recruitment poster for terrorist groups, including al-Queda. The killing of innocent civilians, Abu-Gharib prison and war profiteering has all helped with that recruitment. Also remember the state departments gaffe about decreased terrorism in 2003 was eventually corrected to show an increase in terrorism around the globe. But as long as Bush continues to say America is safer over and over again, the hope is people will start to believe we are safer and that Kerry can only falter and make our country ripe for attack by terrorist groups.

      There are lot of people who still believe that Bush is their man for another 4 years. The reasons for this, I admit, escapes me. Even if you believed that the Invasion of Iraq was the right thing to do, even if you believed his tax cuts would help us get out of the recession and get our economy back on track, even if you believed that he would bring honor and integrity back to the White House, even if you believed all of these things, as well as many of the other Bush Administration policies, you have to admit it's all turned out pretty bad.   Iraq is a mess. No WMDs. NO Iraqi- al Qaeda link. Just over 900 dead american soldiers, 5000 wounded and 10,000 dead Iraqis. Iraq is a country where we are not wanted. Iraq is a country we invaded but had no real plan to deal with all the complexities of it's population.   The economy is horrible. There is a record deficit. There are more bankruptcies declared. Families are carrying a lot more debt. The wage increases are not keeping up with inflation. People are not consuming.   There has not been straight talk from the White House. There have been less press confrences and more secrecy. There has been more contempt for any questioning of said policies and more arrogance in pursuing them.   The Bush Administration has not been successful and as a result, we as voters, having been given the right to vote, will vote for a change.   It seems there a lot of Bush people who are very cynical when it comes to Kerry. I can understand being cynical when it comes to politicians but painting Kerry as this devious and dubious candidate when they have the Mack Daddy in their own corner does not make sense.   Bush had 4 years. He did a terrible job. Next.       poc67
