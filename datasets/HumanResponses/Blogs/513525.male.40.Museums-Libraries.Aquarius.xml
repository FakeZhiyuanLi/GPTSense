      Preparing my Libraries orientation for graduate computer science students, and found this fascinating article on  urlLink  ACM Queue  vol. 1, no. 4 - June 2003 - "How Much Storage is Enough?"  : "In 1999, the world produced about 1.5 exabytes of storable content (1018 bytes). This is 1.5 billion gigabytes, and is equivalent to about 250 megabytes for every man, woman, and child on earth. Printed documents of all kinds make up only .003 percent of the total. Magnetic storage is by far the largest medium for storing information and is the most rapidly growing, with shipped hard-drive capacity doubling every year. Magnetic storage is rapidly becoming the universal medium for information storage...Although the social impact of the Web has been phenomenal, about 500 times as much e-mail is being produced per year than Web pages. It appears that about 610 billion e-mails are sent per year, compared with 2.1 billion static Web pages. Even the yearly flow of Usenet news is more than three times the stock of Web pages. As Andrew Odlyzko puts it,  "Communication, not content, is the killer app."  "

      Matty (a  link I found via Let Me Get This Straight) gives  urlLink a good overview  of Internet trends over the past year.  Bang on.    I hear so much about Friendster, and I've signed myself up, but I haven't recommended any friends yet, so I can't surf :-( but it does sound interesting. and it certainly is generating a lot of buzz.  I wonder how well something like Friendster would work if you live in what the beautiful people of SF, LA, and NYC would probably consider to be the hinterlands LOL   Oh God, I'm indulging in a Winnipegger's favourite pastime: putting ourselves down.  Somebody slap me.

        urlLink Why you should fall to your knees and worship a librarian : "People become librarians because they know too much."

       Well, I have been sucked into blogspace, and I may never return :-)  
 I listed my  urlLink Rainbow Lives Blog  with the  urlLink Blog Search Engine ,    urlLink Blogdex , and the  urlLink Eatonweb portal .   
 I also went merrily a-blog-hopping using the top 100 lists at  urlLink BlogStreet .  I'm discovering a world that I barely knew existed!   
 I could sit and watch  urlLink Geoblog  for an hour...it's somewhat mesmerizing when you realize that you're watching bloggers in real time, all over the world.

       urlLink MemeFirst  reports that Chuck Palahniuk, the author of Fight Club, has come out to avoid being outed by Entertainment Weekly:
   So Palahniuk, the author of Fight Club, went and audio-blogged a very angry message, talking about the EW writer's suicide attempt and generally coming out because he felt he had no choice in the wake of the publication of the article. (I can't seem to access that message any more: maybe Palahniuk is trying to crawl back into the closet.)

  Palahniuk then received a lot of supportive messages – if you consider death threats against the EW writer to be supportive. I guess at this point he went back and actually read the article again, and realised that nowhere was his partner mentioned, and that the closest it came to outing him was to say "he is not married". So he audioblogged a retraction of sorts, in which he urged everybody to calm down and "not kill anybody".

  In the world of print media, none of this would have happened. Palahniuk would have been angry upon reading the article, but would have slept on it, and would have realised that if he did nothing, then no one would be any the wiser. Instead, in a fit of passion, he pulls out his cellphone and announces his homosexual partnership of 11 years to the world at large – something which he'd thereunto successfully kept secret. Now the secret's out, and no amount of pulling messages is going to help. Worse, a largely blameless EW writer is probably now petrified that a crazy Palahniuk fan (and there's no shortage of them around) is going to do her some serious harm. 
  I agree...for God's sake JUST COME OUT already and stop dancing around the subject.

      Had a bit of fun going through Joe Clark's  urlLink Alternadomains , and thinking about some of the fun domain names I could make up.  My personal favourite is: http://fel.la (hey.fel.la! fun.fel.la! gay.fel.la!)... but it's not worth shelling out US$200 for that particular pleasure :-)
  I thought it was hilarious that  urlLink this site  states "Los Angeles is the world's first and only city to receive its own unique Internet address; .la."  Uh, I hate to break it to you Angelenos, but .la stands for Laos, not Los Angeles.

      Here's the article on blogs that got me started on my investigation of blogging:  urlLink The Intimacy of Blogs  (Maclean's magazine, September 15th, 2003).  I first heard about Layne Johnson and her blog here.  So if I have to blame somebody, she's it... j/k :-)

      Over lunch, I printed off and read  urlLink an article in The Altantic  by Paul Davies about the impact of finding extraterrestrial life would have on Earth's organized religions: "...the discovery of just a single bacterium somewhere beyond Earth would force us to revise our understanding of who we are and where we fit into the cosmic scheme of things, throwing us into a deep spiritual identity crisis that would be every bit as dramatic as the one Copernicus brought about in the early 1500s, when he asserted that Earth was not at the center of the universe."

      Wow.  Blogdex is full of  very  good stuff today.  A quote from an article on why weblogs should be allowed to apply for International Standard Serial Numbers (ISSNs):  urlLink Compatibility of Weblogs and ISSN : "For the first time in history, A.J. Liebling’s maxim that freedom of the press belongs to whoever owns one has actually come true. In the past, only corporations and institutions could afford to publish. Now it is possible for individuals and groups to publish. "  Bravo and Amen.

      My favourite Michael Moore quote about librarians, from a  urlLink Buzzflash  interview:   "I really didn't realize the librarians were, you know, such a dangerous group...They are subversive. You think they're just sitting there at the desk, all quiet and everything. They're like plotting the revolution, man."    I just  love  this quote.

      Oh my God!  Michael Moore has a Web site.  I should have known he would  (duh!) , it's an obvious medium for him, but I cannot believe I have never stumbled across it before in all my Web surfing.  Or maybe I had, filed it away somewhere, and forgot about it.   urlLink Michael Moore.com  (found this due to a  urlLink story  linked via  urlLink Blogdex )

      On a coffee break at work.  You know, I am really starting to have serious second thoughts about this whole blog business.   urlLink Plain Layne  writes how she's afraid that her girlfriend will find out she writes a blog.  I don't know that I feel comfortable about  hiding  something I do, like it's shameful or something.  I mean, if you put it up on the Internet, why the fuck don't you just  tell  her already?!?  She's gonna find out anyway.   And if you have serious doubts about  anybody  seeing what you wrote... and that's where I have to do some more thinking about this endeavour.  Maybe I don't want to do this after all, or maybe I will do it in a more de-personalized area of my life.  I dunno, just thinking out loud right now.  I may decide to gut this whole thing and start over.

      Puttering around in my housecoat, still feeling sick.  Housecleaning gets put aside again, as I plunk myself down in front of the TV to watch urlLink  La Barbra  in  Timeless .  (I didn't plan it, I just came across it while channel-surfing.)  I came to Streisand late, and I haven't been playing it much lately, but it's fun to hear her belt out the tunes.  Aaaah... she's doing Evergreen.  "You and I will make each night a first; every day a beginning / Spirits rise and their dance is unrehearsed / They warm and excite us because we have the brightest love / Two lights that shine as one / Morning glory and midnight sun" mmmm....

      Still trolling thru blogpsace, using Layne as my jump-off.  A few links led me to  urlLink Space Waitress Gate A , where she posts about the problems she is having with depression and thoughts of suicide.  

  Having struggled with that myself in the past, I felt compelled to respond.  So I actually posted a comment on a blog: my first ever.

  In her most recent post, spacewaitress talks about getting drunk.  Nuh-uh.  Bad move.  There's a lot of drunks in bars who are medicating away their depressions with alcohol... trading one problem for an even bigger one.  But I can't seem to bring myself to say that.  Why?  Am I afraid of offending someone?  Maybe.  

  Another question to live:  How involved in others' lives do I get?

      Wow.  WOW.  The woman behind  urlLink Plain Layne  can really write: "I remember walking along that sugar cane field like it was earlier today, skirting its knife-edged emerald fringe in the moist torrid heat. Everything was plastered to me with sweat -- hair, clothes, dirt. Even my backpack was soaked. Jungle-coated mountains were slicing open the bellies of clouds and I could smell the unmistakeable odor of a diesel-powered cane grinder, all smoky exhaust and sweet aroma."  I've decided to use Plain Layne as my starting point for blogspace exploration (why not?  gotta start somewhere, right?)

      At lunch today I created a couple of new  urlLink gay.com  userids.  I find it hilarious when I sign on as someone new and immediately get hit upon as "fresh meat".

      I was reading  Maclean's  (the Sept. 15, 2003 issue) on my morning coffee-break when I came across the article on blogs, and I surfed over to  urlLink Plain Layne  to take a peek (she's discussed at length in the article).  

Fascinating.  The idea of posting the most intimate details of your life, then actually encouraging feedback from strangers (and fans...this woman has  fans !!!) is still a little strange to me, even someone so out-there-and-open-book-and-here-is-my-life as me.  But I think I will investigate blogspace further.  Anyways, back 2 work, gotta catalogue orientation to update to match the latest makeover  (sigh)  .  I have a class of Environmental Science students at 2:30 that this needs to be ready for...

One last thing.  I was worried about how self-absorbed I would look to post a few photos of myself...this woman has  urlLink dozens and dozens .  In comparison I look like I'm in the Witness Protection Program :-)

      Well, that spur-of-moment decision to purchase the Rio S10 player is turning out to be one of the best things I've done lately.  After finding out that I can only stuff about about a dozen tunes onto the built-in 64MB memory, I went out and bout a 256MB SanDisk SD memory card, went back onto puretracks.com and brought in my CD collection to pillage songs from and convert them to WMA, and  presto!

 Frankie Goes to Hollywood: Relax
 Like I said...eclectic :-)
 I wandered into a&b sound today just to browse, and walked out with one of their doorcrasher specials: a Rio S10 digital music player, which handles both MP3 and WMA  files.  So I'll give it a whirl and see how it works out...it was a cheap introduction, and if I really like it, I'll upgrade to an iPod (Canadians don't have access to iTunes yet anyways :-( ...)

      Meanwhile, I am installing  urlLink Mozilla Firebird  on my work PC, again because I am getting so fed up with Microsoft's Internet Explorer failing to load images.  I'll give it a test drive for a week or two, and report back to the blog on what I think of it.

      Microsoft's Internet Explorer is driving me crazy...after a few pages, it refuses to load images, especially after browsing through all the thumbnails at friendster.  It's gotten so bad on my less pwerful home PC that I finally threw up my hands and switched to the  urlLink Opera  browser.  Problem solved.

       urlLink Puretracks  was officially launched yesterday...Canada's first (legal) download music service.  And me with a brand-new work PC, complete with CD burner.  Hmmm...guess I should test out my new equipment (in my off-work hours of course).  I'm really glad to see the music industry wake up a bit; a service like this should have been launched several years ago.  Now they're madly playing catch-up while everybody's on KaZaA (or however the hell you spell it)...

The author talks about systems that demonstrate adaptive behavior, such as ant colonies, urban areas, and character-recognition software.  A very engaging read.

      Well, it's nice to know that I'm not the  only  one doing this :-) ...
 Jackie Spinner writes for  The Age :  urlLink Click for clique - www.theage.com.au : "Counting friends — the contest"
 Mike Nguyen admits he’s addicted. Nearly every day for the past five months, the 27-year-old has logged on to count his friends and the friends of his friends. And their friends. At last check, he was up to 210,185 in all. 
 Lawyer Andy Kamage, 31, has been counting for only a few weeks. She is connected to a mere 17,000 people, or “friendsters”, the term for cyber-acquaintances made through Friendster.com, an online networking service that has burst on to the urban hipster scene this year. 
 Friendster was conceived as a twist on online dating, but many have treated it as a giant parlour game to see who’s connected to the most people. 
“It helps you quantify how popular you are,” says Jen Chung, 26, a New York marketing strategist who has 432,475 friendsters. “People get bent out of shape if someone they don’t think is as cool has more friends.” 
As with all flashing pop-culture trends, Friendster has already spawned a backlash. There’s a website called Introvertster that bills itself as “an online community that prevents stupid people and friends from harassing them online”. 
Duncan Watts, a Columbia University sociologist and the author of Six Degrees: The Science of a Connected Age, says people are “deeply fascinated about how they are connected to each other. 
 “It’s a funny obsession,” says Watts. “But they’re obsessed in a way that doesn’t require them to think about it very much … a momentary pleasure.” 
Nguyen got hooked on Friendster after a friend sent him an email asking him to join. “Next thing I know, I’m on it, and it’s become a pseudo-obsession.” 
“Kamage, who has never met Nguyen but is connected to him through his cousin, said she would never sign up for an online dating service. 

 “It’s free entertainment,” she says. “It’s an interesting diversion.”

      Actually,  urlLink this person's post kinda sums up my ambivalent feelings about Friendster : "Maybe I'm wrong. But my first impression of Friendster is that it sucks. I mean, you have to invite friends in order to do ANYTHING on that netowrk. 
'Invite Friends' = give out your friends private email addresses. NICE.
Ok, ok, they SAY they won't sell, lease, give out, share, your email address, but suppose the database gets hacked or they change their rules? I would KILL anyone who gave out my private email address to something like friendster. I certainly wouldn't do that to a friend. 
So, since I won't violate my friend's privacy, I can't invite anyone, and since I can't invite anyone, I can't DO anything on Friendster. "

       Well, I've spent two days tinkering with  urlLink Friendster  and  urlLink Tribe , and perusing the comments that bloggers have made on both systems (which, I've discovered, can be a very effective way to get a sense of what's going on).
 Friendster is great--provided you can plug into a large network without too much work.  If you're starting from scratch, it's frustrating, and you feel like a loser just because you're not part of the "right" group...sounds too much like grade school for my liking.
 Tribe has one thing going for it: you can join public "tribes" (groups) without having to know someone to get in, so you can get down to business without wearing yourself (and your Rolodex) out.  Also, if you can't find a public tribe you want to join, you can create your own, which is a great idea.  Why bust your gut trying to connect to someone else's node on the network, when you can create your own node?  That's more along my line of thinking :-)
 Both Friendster and Tribe are beta software.  There are clear signs that Friendster is going o start charging for its services at some future point, whereas Tribe has vowed not to charge users for its services unless it can't make money from other streams such as advertising and special services.
 Verdict?  I'm keeping my Friendster account, but I think I'll be spending more time--and having more fun--on Tribe.net.  And I will be watching with interest as both services grow and develop.
 Now... I am going to put all this away and focus on my life  off-line .

      From a  Fortune  article by David Kirkpatrick:  urlLink Fortune.com - Fast Forward - I Get By With a Little Help From My Friends of Friends of Friends : "There may be a new kind of Internet emerging--one more about connecting people to people than people to websites. The blog phenomenon, where blogs link to blogs, is another aspect of this same trend. Mark Pincus, an investor in Friendster and founder of Tribe.net, calls this the early phases of the 'peopleweb'--a user-controlled network of identities and relationships that transcends any one site or company. How that web will take shape remains murky, but in the explosive growth of social networking we are surely seeing the future, using the Net to connect people with bonds of trust and friendship--and maybe sex.

      Quote from the  Abstract Dynamics  article on Friendster:  urlLink The Idiot Savant (Friendster Triumphant) : "Now Metcalfe's Law actually isn't much of a law, its a conjecture that, at the moment, is pretty reasonably supported by empirical evidence. What it says is that the value of a network increases exponentially with the number of members in the network. Now Friendster's network is shockingly large. Close to 2 million accounts at the moment, and still growing fast (exponentially?). If Metcalfe's law is even close to true, the value of the Friendster network is increasing tremendously each day. And quite honestly I just don't see how any competitor is going to be able to build up a comparable network. "

      Well, here's a sign of the times: our library just received a new Prentice Hall book...  urlLink New Biology for Engineers and Computer Scientists , a primer on the essentials of new biology (genes, proteins, cells, the Human Genome Project, etc.) for intotech geeks making the shift to cash in on the biotech gold rush.  "This book provides an effective tool to teach new biology to those engineers and computer scientists wanting to join the biotechnology workforce."  Actually, it's a good read, although at only 286 pages the overview moves very quickly, perhaps too fast for some.

      Report from the Browser Wars :-) Well, having used Opera, Mozilla Firebird, and Netscape 7.1 for several weeks, both on my work and home PCs, I can report back.  My favourite browser, and the one that I will use from here on in, is Opera.  I will only be using Internet Explorer for those Web sites that demand it.  Mozilla comes a close second, but Opera still gets my vote.  Frankly I am so sick and tired of the little bugs and quirks in IE that it was inevitable that I was goint to throw it over sooner or later.

      It's been a week since I got this blog set up, and nothing more posted. Yesterday I did some research on cameras and when I was in Winnipeg, I stopped in at Best Buy.  I was not intending to buy one, but rather just to look.  However, I am now the proud owner of a Canon SD110.  It's a funky looking   little   silver jobbie. I can actually get an underwater case for it that is supposed to be good up to a depth of 130'. My only complaint is that it only has 2X optical zoom.  It's 3.2 megapixels and I don't really want more than that, since that will be quite fine for sending you all pics, but I find I'm frustrated with the lack of zoom...so I may keep on looking.  Today was 'working on my bedroom, sorting out the clothes' day and tonight is working on my Visa night. The letter from the U of M, stating that 'who I was is who I am' has arrived, so that's a major hurdle jumped. (i.e. my married name on my degrees, which I have to take to Thailand with me, is the same person as my maiden name on my passport)  Now (aside from report cards at school and finishing up everything there and moving out) the next thing is to sort out Pharmacare and medical coverage for while I'm away.   Then, of course, there's all the renting out the house and sorting out how to pay the bills while I'm away and what to do about my mail and, and, and...

      I've spent, as you can well imagine,   many   hours over the past number of months looking for things Thai. Here are some sites that might interest you as well.   urlLink Lertlah School  This is my school's site, or rather, one of them.  I'm teaching at the Petkasem (street?, road? avenue?) school. If you come to a site that is all in Thai, look in the top right hand corner for a small word "English" and click on it. It makes all the difference! :-)   urlLink Tourism Thailand  Probably more info on all the regions of Thailand than you ever wanted...   urlLink Learning Thai the Easy Way  Ok...that's a misnomer, if ever there was one!  If I ever do find an easy way, I'll let you know.  With 44 consonants, 32 vowels, and each of them capable of being pronounced in 5 different ways (low, middle, high, rising and falling tones), an alphabet that is incredibly beautiful but bears no resemblance to any letters we have ever seen, and no spaces between the words,  easy  is NOT a word that I feel can be applied to learning Thai.  Try looking at  urlLink Learn to Read Thai  You can hear some of the mistakes I'm bound to make at  urlLink Tone Bloopers . Be sure to read all the way to the bottom of the page. For an account of the troubles of one farang (foreigner), take a look at  urlLink Mis-Adventures in Thai Language .   urlLink Thailand Life  This site was begun by "Gor" when he was 12 years old.  He has continued it through his teen years and now makes his living at it. He is now a young married man with a baby daughter. The site has many photos of everyday life in Thailand...the food, stores, his initiation as a monk.    urlLink Sriwittayapaknam School  Gor started his website when he was attending this school. Check out their websites...it's quite amazing!   urlLink Ajarn.com  The banner modestly calls it "Thailand's most popular and best-known teaching website". There's certainly lots of info!

Online diary or journal with dated entries. From a concatenation of "web log." (concatenation...I had to look it up...A series of links united; a series or order of things depending on each other, as if linked together; a chain, a succession)   I need to get a digital camera so that you can actually  be  there with me, in spirit, if not in body.  You can also make comments, so I expect to get lots of oohs and ahhs!

      Well, folks, it's been a VERY busy couple of weeks! Trying to sort out things in my house, finish last minute paperwork, see dear friends and family....oh my! Thanks to some very good friends who came and helped me (ran errands, cleared out my cupboards, came over at 10:30 PM to pack, etc.) I managed to be almost, sort of, just about ready for the movers to come on July 15th.  &nbsp; My house got emptied, except for the room containing all my Thailand possibilities (way too many possibilities, I know), and I stayed at Norv &amp; Arl's that night.&nbsp; They took me to the airport Friday morning and here I am in Montreal at the GALA festival. &nbsp; GALA (Gay and Lesbian Association of Choruses) is holding their 7th international festival here. A small group from the choir I co-direct is here, along with 163 other choruses (over 5000 participants).&nbsp; Imagine the sound as we sang the 'theme song' at the opening ceremonies tonight.&nbsp; Mind-bending!  &nbsp; Our&nbsp;mixed chorus performs tomorrow and the women's ensemble on Tuesday. We've been busy with rehearsals, both vocal and tech (to position ourselves on stage, etc.) It will be very good to have our performances out of the way so we can relax. &nbsp; Montreal is quite hot and humid...preparation for Bangkok, I feel.&nbsp; It's a jumping place with at least 3 festivals going on right now...the GALA one, a comedy festival and and African music festival that I would dearly love to get to, but fear will happen without&nbsp;me. &nbsp; I return home on the 25th, then 3 short days of intense last minute details, and it's up, up and  away .

She tells us that we arrive on Friday evening of a 4 day weekend. (The other person in 'us' is Karen, a former colleague who is going over the same day as me, but NOT on the same plane.) Her suggestion is to stay the night with her and Vic, her husband, and head for Hua Hin, the nearest beach (2 or 3 hours away), the next morning. Karen and I think that is a   fine   idea!

There are some nifty add-ons (emoticons, guestbook, hit counter, etc.) that I can implement...time, expertise and Internet availability (and functionality) in Thailand permitting. But for now, it's just words and pics.  I'd best be off now to one of the myriad things still to be accomplished before I actually set off myself.  Thanks for travelling with me!

      It hit me at choir practice last Wed. night (June 30), several hours after I left school for the last time. I was feeling happily giddy and suddenly realized why.  I exclaimed, "Excuse me...I just have to say,  'I'm retired! '", and then uttered a victory cry. Great cheering from all...and right away I lost all the words to the songs and couldn't concentrate.  Oops!  It was quite a last month, with an assembly at school for fellow retiree, Dolores, and me.  They sang two of my favourite songs,  The Tree Song  and  Child of the Universe , and then students from our classes danced the Maypole. It was enthralling and beautiful. The assembly finished with a tear-jerker goodbye song.  On June 24, the staff had a retirement party...what a blast! The highlights: --music by a local band,  Chaos  (members of my former church choir)--dancing and singing along --a Survivor game featuring Dolores and me --the staff singing a personalized version of 'These Boots are Made for Walkin' (complete with appropriate attire) and 'Happy Trails to You' (including one fellow riding in with a horse get-up) --incredibly touching speeches   Trying to vacate my classroom was a   real   challenge. I had to dispose of (or move home) years of accumulation of precious junk. I had a 'classroom' sale, next put things up for grabs, then pleaded with folks to take things, and finally resorted to surreptitiously leaving things in mailboxes and outside doors.   Instead of a retirement gift, I asked that money be donated to World Vision for classroom supplies. They are able to turn $50 into $500 worth of supplies. So far, between donations and money from selling my 'junk', I've raised over $700!   Thank you to all who helped!

      Carrefour, a small local mall, is pronounced Gahfoo by the Thais. We went shopping there to buy some staples. In the mall were vendors selling clothing, items carved from wood, and many other things. The supermarket is much like a Wal-Mart with a food section. We saw fruits and vegetables we've never seen before.  I'm absolutely astounded by how many things here are the same as in N.A.  I could even have bought Nutella (but I didn't, may I hear some applause, please...I was REALLY tempted).  Some things have the same name (like Nutella), some look the same but have a Thai name.  I bought Scott tissues in a 3 pack.  One of them has a snow scene on it.  I'm keeping it in my room to keep me cool!  And yes, there are post-it notes. :-)  The curious thing is the escalator. The supermarket is on the second floor, and the escalator is made up of small metal sections, about 4 inches wide, which fit together to form a slanted surface rather than steps. Then, when you've finished shopping, the shopping cart attaches magnetically to the surface and you can take it downstairs and right outside. Neat!!!

      Hua Hin in a beach resort area a few hours south of Bangkok.  It has a wonderful beach area (think Grand Beach sand) with horses if you would like to ride, and chairs and umbrellas to rent for the day, which we have not done yet.  I confess that I still haven't been actually swimming, as I've been too busy with other things.  There are a number of things to see around the town and area, and Karen and I are moving rather slowly--trying to keep sweating down to small streams rather than rivers running off our faces.  Taking showers a number of times a day cuts down on sightseeing time as well.  Yesterday we scouted out the temple in town.  There are a number of buildings in a large enclosed area. One is a library, set up with Dewey decimal system (the books weren't marked...only the 100's above the shelves).  We found a section of English books, including Gone with the Wind, Mental Health, Readers' Digest, National Geographic, and some on hygiene and ethics for public healthnurses....all apparently very old.  The building was not kept up well in many areas...an old couch with the foam showing, things stacked up in corners, but a gentleman sitting at a table reading.  We found the main temple (obvious by the shoes left outside). People were buying bits of gold leaf to press onto a Buddha image (and 4other male images...more Buddhas?)  At one end was a hollowed out flat stone (about the size of a coffee table). People would press gold leaf into it, and some had left coins, which then were becoming imbedded into the leaf.  Some people would sit (mermaid style) in front of the Buddha, and shake atall cylinder filled with wooden sticks (which would rattle), and light Joss sticks (incense).  In the afternoon, we saw the old railway station.  It was built especially for one of the kings in the 1920's, and I don't think it's changed much since.  It reminded me very much of the railway setup at the Children's Museum or at the Manitoba Museum.  Got a picture of Karen going through what looks like a saloon door!  For supper we met Ev and Vic, and also the other Lertlah teachers at The Admiral's Head, a restaurant that serves what they think are the best hamburgers this side of Wpg.  After that, Karen and I strolled through the Night Market.  Some areas are regular stores, some are permanent booths, some are temporary moveable food and goods stalls set up along both sides of some of the streets.  There was quite a crush of people, and corresponding crush of sounds and smells.  I'm learning to bargain, and bought a ring that I think I will be very fond of.
