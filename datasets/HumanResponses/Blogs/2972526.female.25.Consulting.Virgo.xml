      If I'm in the business of planning, why does it seem that things are never planned & I barely get by when "planning" with my boss? Why is it that we organize one thing, she gets involved & all plans are changed without our knowledge. It's fine to change things, but let us know sooner than the day before! Deb's going to this meeting completely blind, and I'm not even sure what's been arranged anymore even though I've been in it from the beginning. It's all extremely frustrating... especially when you have more than one event being planned like this.

      It's amazing how many different features humans have in common with other animals. Our powerful spring-like legs, our sense of hearing, our molar & fingernails. It's a wonder that we don't have more scales or feathers.

      Hurray for the Madness! The games are good, but the brackets aren't always so kind.  This time of year is always exciting... spring is around the corner (although it's 94 in Phoenix today), and the sports are exciting. First college basketball, then college hockey, then pro hockey & basketball... all the while pro baseball is coming to life.

      Who says the bad guys aren't winning?  Spain's got a new president, Putin's still in (democratically?) & Osama's still on the loose.  According to French General Henri Bentegeat,  "Our men were not very far, on several occasions, I even think that he slipped out of a net that was well closed."  ...and Maryland won the ACC tournament?!?

It kind of follows from my previous post.  Good notion by the lawmakers...  Even though un-nutricious food is an option for the public, doesn't mean they are forced into purchasing and consuming. If people choose a Big Mac over a carrot stick, that's not the food industry's fault.

Maybe because I "appreciate the fashion statement SUVs make in the sea of small economy cars and hatchbacks". Maybe because they haul a lot of stuff. Maybe because my first car was a Plymouth Grand Caravan & a SUV is the next logical step.

      I’m not sure what happened. I graduated from college & started gaining weight – a lot of weight. Lots of ideas have been tossed around as to the cause. Maybe I have never eaten properly, but lots of exercise and activity had offset the negative habits. Maybe I became depressed & sought comfort in food.  The result remains the same: I’m much heavier and less physically fit than I’ve ever been. For the last 2 years, I’ve been fighting & relapsing into my old ways. As Dr. Marion Nestle (former chairwoman of the Department of Food Studies & Public Health at NYU) has mentioned, “If people want to be smaller, they have to eat smaller amounts."  I read in  USAToday  that according to a new study published in today’s  JAMA  “poor diet and lack of exercise might end up killing more people than tobacco use and become the leading cause of preventable deaths in the USA by as early as next year.”  There’s a sobering thought.  I just thought that I was enjoying new & flavorful food that I never had been able to purchase on a high school & college student’s budget. I didn’t realize how bad the situation has become across the nation.  Sounds like people may be sucked into the same wonderful pictures and aromas of new foods that swayed me to become more rotund.   No wonder the fast food companies continue to post profits; more Americans than ever are eating out at fast food restaurants. Why not? With the advent of the $1 menus everywhere, it’s cheaper to eat out than fix something at home or go somewhere more nutritiously conscious – not to mention quicker & more convenient.  A helpful step in the right direction is McD’s discontinuing the super-size menu options. Pepsi is looking to enter a pseudo-diet drink, “Pepsi Edge” (70 calories versus the full 150 in the regular version), into the market this summer. FritoLay has decided to take trans fats out of their products. Maybe if companies continue to realize that killing customers is bad for business, people will be forced to eat the more healthful choices that are becoming available.

      March Madness is about to begin. Some may say it has already started. I was asked recently if I could think of any ways to keep more people involved for longer in tournament bracket pools. The guy at work that sets up the pool was concerned because after the first round is played a substantial number of the people no longer have a shot at winning the pool. He was looking for a way to keep more people involved for longer.  The first thing that came to my mind was the people shouldn’t have picked crappy teams. The second thing that came to my mind was possibly adding a ‘margin of victory’ (MOV) pick along with the pick for winning team. This way, even though people may not pick winning teams, maybe their MOV was close to the outcome of some other games. Even if they choose the losing team, if they had a good MOV pick, then they would still get points.  For instance: Winning team pick = 5 points MOV point pick (within 5pts ranges) = 2 points Duke vs. Michigan, you pick Michigan to win, and pick a MOV of 6 points. If Duke wins by 10 points, you get 2 points for being within the MOV 5-10 point range.  This way, people may still be competitive if they pick correct MOVs.  The guy at work agree to consider this idea, but seemed like he was leaning towards having people re-pick after the 1st or 2nd round (in case all their teams were gone). The way I see it, this doesn’t reward the people that did pick the correct teams from the start.

      One marine's mother tried to explain the pictures of abuse at the Abu Ghraib Iraqi prison as "stupid, kid things - pranks." Really?? I don't remember ever pulling those kind of pranks when I was younger.  Now, I'm not saying these soldiers are innocent or guilty, but the pictures are pretty damning. I'm sure there's some scapegoating going on, but they can't hide from the fact that they were there & took some part (active or passive) in the abuse.

I can only imagine what they did to Cheney. I'm sure the White House staff knew that there would be some censorship, but I doubt they envisioned the extent to which the Chinese would go out of their way to hide what he said.

      Even after 8 hours of decent sleep for the first time in quite a while, I'm exhausted. I think everything is catching up with me. I'm basically exhausted. I probably wouldn't have come in to work today until noon (ish) except I had scheduled an 65k service for drop-off this morning. I'd leave early, except I have no car.  I have totally moved beyond the "so tired I'm punchy" stage to the "mush for brains" stage. I don't believe I've had a complete, coherent thought all day.   I should go running tonight because I haven't moved since Thursday (and even then, it was sporadic). But I'm exhausted. But then again, the game is on Thursday & then we'll be on vacation & lazy. I haven't shaved. ??? I don't know what to do.  So sleepy.

      Last night it I determined the perfect tattoo for me. Ready for it?  "Sproingy"  Good stuff, huh? It would be green letters, possibly outlined in black. There would be tiger stripes on all of the letters, but not too many as to take away from the word.  The green and tiger stripes would symbolize frogs & tigers. Both frogs & tigers have powerful legs that are very similar to springs. Just like my legs :) They may not look like much (just like frog legs look pretty pathetic), but they contain the hidden potential similar to a compressed spring ready to release its power. My arms are like pythons, so I may include some scaley texture to the tattoo, but that would need to be worked out by the artist that draws the design.  Where would I get the tattoo? Well, I don't want it to be anywhere that could potentially be stretched or get horribly saggy. I also don't want it to be anywhere that would be extremely painful to get a tattoo (like on a bone). I've determined that my right butt cheek would be the ideal setting for Sproingy. I can get my butt to go numb by sitting in a funny position so the needle wouldn't hurt, and I've always had a fairly static butt, so it won't get too stretched or saggy. If it does get stretched somehow, then the stretch marks would just add to the tiger stripe effect.  I should say that this is a work in progress, but it seems like a solid idea to me.

      So my dad's moving to Salt Lake City. I know very little about the area, so it should be neat to visit sometime. Ever since I learned of his move out west, I've found myself wondering "what's a Ute?" Well, to help all my faithful fans out there, a Ute is an American Indian tribe for which the state of Utah is named. They've been in the Utah/Colorado area for at least 1,000 years & they were among the 1st American Indians to use the horse as transportation.  According to my dad, who has also done some research on the area, the Utes & Mormons really didn't get along too well, so the Mormons sought help from the government. To show their gratitude, the Mormons have generally been supportive of the government & its programs. Which is why big chunks of Utah are owned by the government for testing & military bases/research. I must add that this paragraph is oversimplified, but it's the gist of what has transpired over the last couple hundred years. -- On a separate note, I must say that Duke should not have lost to UConn. UConn is an excellent team & they won fairly, but Duke allowed them to do so. Poorly timed passes, lax defense at times, and poor shot selection were all factors in Duke's loss. They have the knowledge and the skill level to perform at a much higher level, but almost seemed as though they chose not to. I honestly believe they were playing at a level that would have helped them to the championship. I'm not sure what crumpled (Maybe pressure of being underdogs? Maybe too many young players looking forward? Maybe...) I suppose there's always next year.

      If I run for just a half a mile 3 out of 7 days (but really push myself on the pace), and then go & play indoor soccer, I can play almost as aggressively as I'd like. I still get winded & tired, but it's a great improvement over what I would deem to be my most horrific showing ever. Hopefully, if I keep up the run & expand its distance, I'll be able to go for longer indoor without getting winded. -------- In other news, despite his party membership, I've never really cared for Benson. While he was running, I had an opportunity to meet him, albeit pretty briefly. He didn't strike me as a good politician then, and he certainly doesn't now. The rumor mill amongst the different campaigns at the time held that he was pretty much a jerk with the money to get where he was aiming. Now that he's in the top spot, I can't see that he's done much good or bad. However, what was he thinking on importing Canadian drugs? Political suicide. I'm not sure that I mind what's following, but you would hope a governor would have decent advisors & really think something through without going ahead with what seems to be a cutesy exercise in civic disobedience. Nevermind that it's a federal crime (I believe). Perhaps he has terrible advisors because the good ones turned down the chance to work for a jerk after the campaigning ended.  He's losing the only support he had, for what gain? Even if the labs show identical drugs, that still doesn't mean it legal to import them. Without the rank & file support he used to have, there's no chance of passing a law in either NH house that would make the importation legal. I'm not sure he really has any good option for a next move.

      On the way home last night I was listening to Marketplace, All Things Considered or some such program on NPR. A commentator (Christie Mellor) came on & gave told a little story about going to a friend’s party were a lot of alcohol was consumed by all. She eventually went to the bathroom, only to find the toilet seat locked – much like every other hinged object in the house. She went on to describe the lengths her friends had gone in order to make their house childproof.   After describing the unattractive table bumpers and locked rubber band drawers, she put her finger on what had happened to the previously normal couple. Fear. They were bullied by safety product manufacturers into believing that serious harm and/or death would befall their child if they didn’t spend $39.99 on rubber bumpers for their coffee table. The commentator went on to say that the money (and appearance of the furnishings) could have been saved by simply telling their child “no.” If a child gets a bump on the head after disobeying & running in the house, they’ll develop some character, think twice & understand the consequences of disobeying. She concluded that saying “no” more often to the child would also help prevent embarrassed guests from having a potential real accident in the bathroom with a locked toilet seat.  I understand some childproofing is necessary, but there should be limits on the protection, too. I’m curious to see the how far my previously normal friends will go as they start baby-proofing their house.

      Every once in a while, I find myself thinking that it’d be nice to lead a more exciting life. I’m not sure what I deem to be more exciting. Maybe exciting means I want to get more life goals accomplished (or even starting in the general direction of accomplishing them), travel to more exotic locals (read: not New England or the Midwest), go to more sporting or theater events, have a social life or meet more people from across the US or world.  The problem is that I lead a fairly fast paced life as it is. I travel pretty frequently both for work and for familial affairs. I see movies on a pretty regular basis. When there’s time, I watch sporting events (on TV). I’d love to fit time in to volunteer somewhere, to read interesting books, or to go to school. I’m not sure where I’d fit it in… we don’t eat dinner until 9ish as it is.   Honestly, my life is pretty cool. I do travel some neat places & see some neat things (I just wish I could bring my husband, too). We’re further ahead of the “average” person in terms of financial independence. I work for a company that does is interesting governmental work. I have a wonderful husband and a crazy (but interesting) family. My car runs reliably (and has a turbo, CD changer, sunroof & heated seats). I do have good friends that I’ve known for over a decade.  Maybe I’m happiest when I’m complaining about my life: not enough time, not as much money as I’d like, a job with not much satisfaction or intellectual stimulation, only human interaction is with co-workers & husband, out of shape, lack of life direction. Maybe I just enjoy living in a state of pseudo-depression?

      I started thinking about blogs today. I wondered why people start them & why people read them. I know my reasons for starting one and I'm its similar to some others'. I went a step further & began thinking about why I read other peoples blogs.  At first, I was ready to chalk it up to some sort of voyeuristic curiosity of how other people live. It's always interesting to learn new opinions, perspectives, storylines, and people. It's nice to see the ups & downs of daily life that happen in someone else. It helps remind me that the grass is greener on my side sometimes, too.  I also believe that I read blogs to gather information. I'm always poking around on the internet, trying to find more info on different topics. Much of the time, the topics I research have little relation to each other (ignoring the fact that they all started as a fleeting thought through my head). Blogs are an excellent source of my fleeting whim topics. I can read opinion blogs and then try to find an opposing opinion. Or, I can read information/news related blogs and then try to find more information on the current events. I crave information & really love the search for solid, credible info.  In a somewhat related vein, the DNC is issuing press credentials to some bloggers. My guess is because they distribute information (for better or worse) to more people than other news organizations. People in Wildrose, North Dakota may not receive many news carriers, but if they have a modem, they can reach a broad range of opinions & facts.

      Mass. Governor Mitt Romney wants to bring back the death penalty to Massachusetts. He says that basing the sentences off of science (mainly DNA evidence) will corroborate guilt or innocence. He claims it would be foolproof.  The only foolproof plan, in my view, is no death penalty. Then there's no chance of an "oops."

      A comment made by a co-worker yesterday has been bothering me.  She very recently signed up for Eharmony.com and received a few matches with her personality profile. One of the matches asked her a few questions (implying he’s interested). By answering the questions, she was then able to ask him some questions.  Since this all happened yesterday, she was pretty excited, but I can tell she’s not necessarily expecting the sky to fall. Today, she’s looking around match.com. I wonder if she’s going about this with the wrong attitude. One of the questions she wanted to ask was if he’s comfortable being on his own. It seems she doesn’t want a full-time relationship. If he comes over for dinner or something, she’d like him to leave eventually. It seems to me that if you don’t want to spend time with someone, maybe you aren’t ready for a relationship?  Between that comment & a few others, it just doesn’t seem like she’s going into this whole match-finder thing with a very open mind.

      The airshow in RI was great! The only way I knew about it was through a co-worker. She found out from a flier she had picked up at Ace Hardware. I'm not sure what Ace has to do with the planes, but I guess it doesn't matter.  The weather on Sunday was beautiful... not too hot with a slight breeze. The planes were pretty amazing. The museum-type planes were sort of ho-hum, especially after a recent visit to the  urlLink Museum of Flight  near Seattle. However, the aerobatic planes did incredible maneuvers throughout the day. The USAF Thunderbirds were a great way to end the day. It's almost frightening how precise they are. If my life depended on that type of precision all of the time, I'd be in trouble.  Monday, I left for NYC for business. I was to arrive around 1pm, check into the hotel & meet with our contact and my boss around 2:30. In the taxi, on the way to the hotel, my boss calls and says "it's such a nice day, why don't we change the meeting until 3?" I okay it - it's only another 1/2 hour.  Around 2:15, my boss calls again and wanted to move the meeting until 4. It was a nice day, but I wasn't able to go too far or accomplish anything because I needed to hang around to do actual work. (You know, what I was there to do.) In the end, we did meet around 4, but our contact had gone home for the day (as she usually does) around 3. I warned my boss about this, but I'm guessing she thought I was joking. What the whole day boiled down to, was I only managed 2 hours of directly billable work - and I had anticipated more.  Later, we met with another co-worker & went wandering around Greenwich Village. My boss thought she knew where she was going, so it took us 1 subway stop too far & 30 mins of walking before she found the general vicinity she had thought of. It was a very nice area & I did see an entirely new area NYC.  Tuesday's meeting went well and I was able to catch an earlier shuttle back to Boston. Woot! That meant I would land when it was still a little light out, so I could read the construction signs to determine a way out of Logan Airport. All in all, a good trip, but very tiring. Not only due to the long hours and business attire (although I only buy what's comfortable), but also because it's draining keeping up & placating my twitchy boss.  I'm really glad that summer-like weather seems to be in the Boston area for good. :)  side note: the spell check wanted to replace aerobatic with arbutus and billable with bilabial. ???

      I'm supposed to go see the  urlLink Thunderbirds  today.  I've really been looking forward to this for a little while now. Even with my love of things that fly (especially airplanes), I've never been to an airshow. This one looks pretty cool. The down side of it is the location. It's in Rhode Island & it'll take me about 2.5 hours to get there (not assuming traffic) - and I want to be there for the opening parachute jump at 9:55.  I was planning on getting to sleep at a decent time... but I was waiting for Paul's show to end (it wound up being a 2 hour show); meanwhile, he was waiting for me to get off the computer.  Grrrr!  We didn't get to bed until way late.  I don't know if I was too excited to sleep, or just too uncomfortable to sleep (my leg is pretty banged up from this week's pick-up soccer game, so I can't really find a position that doesn't hurt). Now that it's 1.5 hours of sleep later and I'm wide awake, I know that later I'll cranky. Paul's the same way. He didn't get much sleep, so he'll be cranky. The cranky twins have shown their ugly heads before & we never enjoy ourselves when it happens. Since it's my first airshow, I want to see & do everything.   On the plus side, there's a chance of showers throughout today down in RI (in fact, it's heavily raining right now). Tomorrow looks like it'll be 5 or 6 degrees cooler, but sunny all day. I guess I'll wait another day.

      I've been doing a lot of thinking about short term & long term goals lately. It's starting to bother me that I haven't even started down the paths to achieve some of them. I keep thinking about all the interviews I had that asked where I saw myself in 5 years. Well... 5 years has now become next year.  Some of the people I went to high school with have achieved & accomplished what I hold to be pretty amazing things. Things I wouldn't mind trying. Learning new language s , advanced degrees, neat/unusual travel and jobs, etc. I've done some pretty cool stuff, but I'm not sure it's the kind of thing they write about in my smallish town paper. I've accomplished more than some, but less than others. That should be good, but I strive for more.  My biggest problem is wanting to do, see & understand everything. However, I never make any concrete decisions in terms of direction, so I wind up doing absolutely nothing. In some ways, it's procrastinating. In other ways, it's a severe case of indecisiveness.  I've got a lot to do before next year's 10 high school reunion. I suppose I should get a direction. Or skip the 10yr. reunion. Maybe I'll do something that'll make me proud by my 15 or 20 yr. reunion.

      What a good weekend. I managed to accomplish almost everything on my list. After a very slow start on Saturday, I cleaned our porch, washed my car, went to storage to get the boxes for the Christmas tree, took down the Christmas tree, returned the full boxes to storage, vacuumed, watched the Red Sox game, purchased some flowers, planted the flowers & cleaned up afterwards.  After Paul returned and showered (he was helping friends move apartments all afternoon), we went to a bar that was having live music. We managed to last all the way from 8:15 until 1am (closing). It was a good time, although afterwards I have to admit we’re getting old.  The music was loud & the smoke bothered me at times. The third band was nothing but noise. I’m not sure if there was music involved because my ears were ringing the entire time. The band took away from the fourth band, which was pretty good.  At any rate, Sunday was just as nice weather-wise & we took turns walking once we finally woke up after the late night. (We also stayed up late on Friday night watching Reagan’s funeral & related coverage.) We then went out & purchased about $100 worth of clothes & discovered we left a credit card at Friday night’s restaurant.  All in all, a good weekend. I’m hoping for more sunny days & less rain (even though it rained again today) as summer is set to officially begin soon. I really hope next weekend is going to be nice – we have a trip to Rhode Island for an air show in the works.

      I follow 7 blogs (8 if you count my husband's). Everyone seems to have creative or insightful things to say on a decently regular basis.  I'm wondering if the only way I can display creativity or insightfulness is when my brain is already working overtime. Lately, my job has been exceptionally slow. I've pretty much given up on trying to find things to do. As a result of inactivity, I don't seem to have much to say.  Sorry.

      Harry Potter starts today in theaters. How did it sneak up on me with all of the hype that surrounds the whole marketing empire? I was even in NYC the day of its US debut! I could've sworn I had another month.  I usually read the book before I watch the movie - I guess it's the appropriate college-graduate thing to do. However, I haven't even purchased the book and it certainly isn't going to be available in my library for the next 7 months, either. I'm not sure it'll still be in the theaters by the time I'm done reading all 560 pages (yes, I know that it's a quick read... but come on, I can't finish an interesting 80 page magazine in less than a week).  Do I go ahead & watch it without reading the book? Do I delude myself into thinking I'll read the book after I see the movie? Do I save myself $14 & not by the hardcover? (It would have to be hardcover to match the previous 2 volumes I've purchased.)  Then again, outside of Harry Potter books, I can't remember the last book-turned-movie I've read. Maybe something like Patriot Games - and I read it after I saw the movie several times. Then again, I'm not sure if I ever finished reading that.

      Well, I managed to haul my ass around for 3.5 miles at the  urlLink JPMorgan Chase Corporate Challenge . I was 2nd place within the women from my company. However, I really think I could've been 1st if I hadn't stopped & walked briefly a couple of times. I never really got too winded, but the humidity caused it to be very sticky early on in the race. At the same point in time, I have a long way to go to get into shape, so I could've done worse, too. Last year's goal was to run this year. I think next year's goal is to run the whole time in 35 minutes, or less.

      A new look for the page. I think I like it, but maybe it's just a way to waste time at work... I keep changing settings.  New addition - the ability to leave comments! Woot! I'm excited already at the idea that all the millions of folks (read: my husband) that read my page will be able to leave a little note of appreciation, dissatisfaction, tidbits of inspiration or anecdotes, etc.

      So much for the random thought blogging, eh?   July has been a pretty busy month so far, and August, September, and October look to be as busy, too. Actually, the weekdays are pretty standard from week to week:   Monday: Guys poker night. I either exercise or veg in front of the TV/computer  Tuesday: Exercise  Wednesday: Company softball game for me (hubby’s version of my&nbsp;Mondays)  Thursday: Indoor soccer game  Friday: Eat out after work (aka non-fast food)   You would think that these things wouldn’t fill an entire night. However, it takes me about an hour to get from work to home. After completing the activity of the night &amp; driving home, it’s typically 8:30 or 9 when I finally get around to walking in the door of the apartment &amp; thinking about dinner. Dinner then winds up being fast food or a couple mini York peppermint patty (and yet we’re both able to keep off the weight we’ve lost).   The weekends have been filled lately, too. It’s amazing our laundry is sort of up-to-date.   The weekend after the 4th of July we drove down to Queens for my friend’s wedding reception. Since she got married during our trip out west in April, it was a reception primarily for his family &amp; family friends. We arrived on Saturday afternoon, checked in to the hotel &amp; hopped on the train into Manhattan to meet up with them. We wandered mostly around the Greenwich Village/Little Italy area. After wandering, drinks &amp; dinner we took the train back to the hotel. Long day, but a lot of fun. The reception in  urlLink Bayside  was really nice, although we didn’t know anyone but the bride &amp; groom. They were pretty grateful to see familiar faces (especially the bride). The groom’s friends made us feel welcome &amp; included us in pictures &amp; discussion. The drive back was pretty uneventful. I think traffic was light because everyone had traveled the previous long weekend.   This past weekend was nothing but down time. We thought we’d clean and straighten out stuff with the apartment, and shopping. In the end, not much was accomplished. It was really nice. We managed to clean a lot of things off of the TiVo (although we still haven’t watch the last 2 Friends episodes). We began the weekend watching Rally Magazine and ended the weekend with the Rally Argentina. I’ll have more to post about the rally &amp;  urlLink Subaru  later.   This coming weekend I’ll be off to NYC (again). I like my trips there, but they’re never long enough. Not nearly enough "play" time since it’s for work. It should be interesting flying out of Boston with the  urlLink Democratic National Convention  officially starting on Monday. A lot of people&nbsp;are less than excited about it coming.

      Alright, so lately I've been unreliable with blogging. I figure the blog was originally supposed to be an outlet for some of my random thoughts, so I should go back to the basic randomness.  The fireworks  urlLink on the Esplanade  were great. Again. David Lee Roth was okay, but the original 1st choice of Aerosmith would've been better. I've probably more than my fair share of fireworks & the Boston 4th is always impressive. I think the hubby & I are making this into some sort of tradition. Each year, we perfect the whole process a little more (for example, we didn't sit directly next to the howitzers this year). If you ever get the chance to visit Boston around the 4th of July, I  highly  recommend finding a good viewing spot in Cambridge or Boston along the Charles.  I've allowed a few more blogs into my daily reading circle. Some of them seem to do a lot of quizzes. One caught my eye, so I tried it out. It seems pretty accurate to me (and I had some pretty non-nerd responses scattered throughout):    You're a Speak & Spell!!  You nerd, you.  Just because you were disguised as a toy doesn't mean you weren't educational, you sneaky bastard.    urlLink   What childhood toy from the 80s are you?      brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      Paul & I are still getting over the "vacation" back to Michigan for his sister's wedding. From the moment we touched down Thursday afternoon, until we took off again on Sunday, we were scheduled to be somewhere or do something the entire time. There was even a bathroom schedule that we had to abide by. As I wasn't part of the bridal party, so my "to do" list was actually pretty lengthy. When everyone else was off doing pictures, or ushering guests, etc, I was running around setting up hors d'ouerves, shuttling toasting glasses, etc. Lots of little stuff. Not much down time.  Friday, I did get to drive down to visit with my mom &amp; grandma for a bit. It was really good to see both of them and wander the farm briefly. I'm still struggling with the idea that it very likely was the last time that I would see my grandma alive. Although she was doing really well when we saw her, she had last rites (a Catholic sacrament) the day before we were there. I guess she was planning on dying Saturday. She didn't, but even still... Even with 3 years to prepare for this, I don't think I'm very close to being ready for her to die.  Back to the wedding... It was nice to see the same people that were at our wedding, but without the hassle of being the bride & groom. Congrats to Kelly &amp; Andy. They both seemed very excited and happy to begin their married life in the Bahamas.  I've always been curious about the Bahamas because it's tropical, but doesn't take a lot of time to travel to. Apparently the rainy season in the Bahamas is from May-October. After checking out weather.com, it seems the newlyweds have picked a bad week to vacation. It's warm, but there is a good chance of thunderstorms & rain every day this week. I guess being in the middle of both the hurricane &amp; rainy season means I shouldn't think of visiting the Bahamas during this time of year.  I keep thinking that I could use a short vacation to catch up on sleep (or rather, start sleeping through the night again) and just relax. Something warm, involving a pool or beach would be nice. It's not going to happen, though. Things are starting to pick up a bit at work, and our weekends are either rainy, or booked with other obligations.  Now we are back in New England & literally hitting the ground running. We've signed up for a 5K race as part of HP's team. Since Paul did a race as a part of my company's team, I can do one as part of his company's team. The race is Thursday, and we ate a lot of bad foods &amp; didn't exercise over the extended weekend, so we are trying to prepare ourselves in the limited time before the race.

      Maybe it's just me being overly sensitive, but I don't think it's very professional to send an email to a client saying:  "Soooo, ummmmm, "Show me da money!" and later in the same paragraph... "Where the hell's my money?"  Even though we (by we I mean the sender of the email) have a good relationship with this particular client, it still seems like it's stepping over some sort of client-contractor professional courtesy line.

      It's amazing how my time gets sucked into a big black hole. I think nothing much is going on & before I know what has happened, it's all gone &amp; it's a week later.  I didn't feel too well last week. Some weird feeling. People kept asking if I was pregnant. What kind of question is that?? If I was, would I tell people this soon? No. However, I am not pregnant, so I can fight that question off. My guess is I felt weird because I haven't been able to sleep very well for about a month now. No real reason why I can't sleep much. Just a frustrating situation.  This weekend we went to  urlLink Cirque du Soleil's Varekai  performance in Boston. It's a very good show. It's amazing what the human body can be told to do. I had seen the show on TV & followed the performers from the start to the launch of the tour on the Bravo series, so I was wary about paying so much for a show I'd pretty much seen. I had nothing to fear. While I was familiar with the acts &amp; the performers names, there is a lot more that goes on during the act besides the main performance. The whole show was good & our seats were awesome. I'm glad we didn't pay for the $75 tickets, since our view was just as excellent. It may be pricey, but it's definitely not typical theater, either.  The rest of the weekend (Saturday morning and all Sunday) fell into the black hole. We accomplished some little things, but not enough to account for the amount of time spent.  Now we're gearing up for Paul's sister's wedding. We leave Thursday, but literally every minute is accounted for from the time we land Thursday until we fly out Sunday. I hate using my vacation days on things like this... there's absolutely no time to relax &amp; we wind up exhausted going into another work week. It'll be nice to see people that I haven't seen in a while, but I'll only have 30 mins available to spend with them before my next appointment. Look out SE Michigan; Paul &amp; I will be tearin' it up soon.
