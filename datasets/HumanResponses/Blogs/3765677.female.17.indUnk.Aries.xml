      For the past couple of days have been confusing.  I have been on the road to "success", doing everything I am supposed to and reading my book "Calm My Anxious Heart" (really good Christian book by Linda Dillow) and also working for my father.  I have been talking with the Lord and really have a strong relationship now and don't want to lose it.  I really have to thank my friend Kristin that I met in Florida for really inspiring me.  Her and the youth group from OU were down in Florida and they showed me what it really meant to believe and be with Gods grace.  It was really amazing to see college students really live the Christian life.  She is apart of my testimony.  That's another story, but about these past couple of days.. My ex-b/f, Rew (not going to say his name), has recently been calling and I call back and we talk.  Harmless right? Wrong. I went out with him for a year and so in love we were but money split us apart.  He had to get his "life" together.  Surprising, money has everything to do with relationships nowadays.  What happened to just having God and both having a relationship with him to further the intimacy?  It's so true.  The closer two people that are together really believe in God and talk with him on an everyday basis have a better relationship, as to those who don't.  Well, Rew has been calling and I haven't seen him in a while.  He was in town so we hung out.  We played tennis, went to the pool and fixed sandwiches, and saw The Notebook.  It is definitely a girl movie guys! Romance it is..  The first time I saw it was with a friend.  All I could think about though was re.  The movie had almost everything that happened in our relationship.  I was like "WOW".  So, of course I made him go watch it with me and he agreed that it looked like how things  were  with us.  He broke up with me back Feb. The first.  For three months I cried and pitied myself.  How foolish is that.  I am sure everyone has done it. Well, I learned that I had to get over it and do something because I was loosing my friends and I wasn't happy.  I told him never to call.  It was only for my sake and being fair.  He wanted me to still talk to him and still say sweet words only it broke my heart and kept me on his "orbit".  Going around and around and I was on an emotional rollercoaster.  Not good, I know.  May and June have been better. June the best! May was the ending of school and I was happy for that.  June however was when I started my relationship with God again.  Okay, back to the story.  After Rew and I saw that movie I had to drive him back to Liberty (where his truck was at his moms).  Then I followed him back to 90 so I could find my way home.  We stopped in a parking lot before we both went our separate ways.  I told him to know that I will always love him and to keep up with college and everything.  I told him to stop calling.  I know it seems so cold hearted but it's for the best.  He gets what he wants so I got what I want.  Sometimes I don't understand.  He can talk to me and everything like we were boyfriend and girlfriend, but he can't go out with me.  Only because he can't see me whenever he wants but yet he still wants to talk sweet.  Ugh! I say enough and just go do what you have to and if God wants us to be together then we will be.  If not, then it wasn't meant to be.  Right now though I am just keeping my faith with God and till I leave this life.  It has been the best choice of my life.  That has been the past couple of days plus a couple weeks ago in Florida without details.  Anyways, I'll post another soon.

      Okay, well I found this website and it looked cool so thought I might try it out.  Anyways, it's about 6:30 and I just got home from the gym.  I usually don't get up this early during the summer but I have been trained a week of it.  I was at tennis camp all last week.  Played six hours every day.  Wake up at 6:30 and go to bed by 9.  So, now I am like "trained" to get up.  Anyways, a little about myself, 17, Christian, sweetheart, and well I love to do anything outdoors.

      Monday and Tuesday I'm finally home.  It feels nice to say that.  The beach was great! I went with Frog and her family.  We drove down there in the red minivan.  It's an old Pontiac.  If you have ever heard "Piece of sh*t car" by Adam Sandler it's exactly how the van was.  No radio, seatbelt is broke, windshield is cracked.. The whole shabang!  We went to her Dads friends beach house.  It was really nice compared to all the other beach houses we have stayed in.  We took all our stuff and put it in a room and went back to the minivan.  Frog doesn't exactly have a car and I didn't drive my truck down there because I have been going and driving way too much so we were stuck with the evil minivan.  I told her we should go drive on the beach, but she didn't want to.  She was way too embarrassed by it.  I really didn't want to drive it, but finally I said what the heck. I didn't go to the beach to just sit around at the beach house and do nothing.  I came there to have a good time and I made the best of what we had.  So anyways, we got in the red minivan and rolled down the windows.  We started singing for our music.  Lovely, huh?  Well we drove up and down and honked the horn for the fun of it.  To honk the horn:   1. Pull off the cover of steering wheel 2. Find something sharp to hold down the button 3. Hold it down really hard then "BEEP" Yeah it was great.  Two pretty girls in an ugly van.  Well, after driving up and down the beach and checking out all the guys (there weren't many) we parked and started walking.  We figured maybe we would actually get to talk to people.  Soon as we started walking these guys in a PT cruiser rolled up and started talking to us.  They were both 17, Colten and Dan.  Cute Georgia boys! So we hung out with them and played pool and horseshoes.  We had fun, but they had to go back home.  They were there for the 4th and we had just missed all the big party.  That was okay though.  We told them that we were driving a minivan and asked them if they would have talked to us if they saw us in it.  They said yes because were so gorgeous and didn't care what we drove.  Frog and I just laughed and were like whatever.  So after they left she and I just hung out at the beach house and had fun on Tuesday hanging out with her family.  Later towards the end of Tuesday I invited my ex, Rew, up to the beach house.  He said he would come and he did.  We got along well and just hung out and drove around on the beach then he had to leave and I went back home.    Wednesday Woke up and went to the gym! YAY! I was so happy to go back to the gym and work out.  I felt so much better afterwards!  Came home and took a shower and got ready for the day.  I had to take care of a ticket from a long time ago.  I took defensive driving for it and I had to turn my certificate to the court so I could get it dismissed.  The ticket was for speeding.  This was November 21, 2003.  My ex bfs 21rst birthday.  I was driving fast to his house because I was afraid the cake would get to cold.  Yeah, I was really stupid.  Oh well, that's out of the way now and the ticket is done with.  Anyways, my friend Moto that has been in California for the past 2 and a half weeks calls me and asks me to pick him up from the airport so I say sure and I picked him up.  He told me all about Cali and how he wants to move out there.  I really want to visit there!  We went back to where he lives and hung out.  He had to pay bills, check on stuff and pick up mail from his parents house.  We went and checked on his dirt bikes and jet skies.  I rode around on his pit bike.  That was fun! Fast little bike. After that we went to Blockbuster and rented "Along Came Polly". I had already seen it, but he wanted to see it.  We went back to his place and the power was out.  It was out for like a couple hours so we ran some errands and waited for them to come back on so we could watch the movie.  After we got back from Wally world they were on and we watched it.  Then, I drove back home.  On my way home Rew calls me.  He asks where I am driving from so late.  I told him Motos house and he got jealous and mad.  I told him I'm not his girlfriend anymore and we have been broken up.  I said stop all this BS (waiting and crap to get back together) if you're going to act like this then be with me.  He thinks that Moto and I have kissed and all that.  I would never kiss him or anything.  He is like a brother to me.  He farts, burps, and treats me like I'm his sister.  I would never lay a hand on him.  Rew thinks the opposite and starts saying all this stuff.  Anyways, my point is is that I'm not his girlfriend and he's acting like it.  He said he would call me tomorrow but it's now today and he didn't.  I didn't really expect him to.  That was all the drama last night! UGH! Thursday! Life is just plum peachy, I must say! My flight for Florida is Sunday at 10:35 in the morning! I am so happy! My mom, brother, and I are going to Disney World in Orlando! YAY! Hopefully I will get to see my friend Kristin I met last time when I was in Florida.  She is so awesome and has helped me through a lot and believing.  I love her!  All I really did today was just work out and run.  I did a little shopping at Kohl's because they were having a great sale.  I bought a lot of new work out clothes that are really cute and I can't wait to work out in them.  Pathetic. I'm going to shut up now.  My friend Katy that I met at tennis camp called me tonight and we talked for a while.  She was my roommate and she is really sweet.  We have a lot in common and we get along great.  She's in Colorado right now visiting the University up there.  My life has been pretty great this summer.  This has been awesome and there is so much more to come and do and I'm really excited.  God has truly blessed me in so many ways.  I thank him for this opportunity to be writing right now and I hope that I can spread the "Good News" to all my friends.  Well, I'm off to bed.  Tomorrow I think I'm going to go jet skiing.  Night night!

      Re=again Union=as one. Those are my definitions of a reunion, but I have never been to the Wisenbaker one so we were just a Family Union to me. Hopefully next year it will be a Re.  Ha! Anyways, it was nice seeing my cousins.  I didn't know I had about 50 of them.  My oldest ones are 90 and 95.  They are awesome! Great Great Grandma was wearing pink shoes!  Yeah it was cool.  I got to see my Pops too (my moms dad).  He's doing well.  My mom, brother, and I left around 3 and then I went to Frogs house (1 of my best friends).  We just hung out and drove to get something at my house and went back to hers. We did a little something to one of our friends cars on the way.  Left a nice note because it was on the side of the road.  After we got back to our house we had to go to the store to get toilet paper. Her parents asked us to.  So, her dad gave her a 20 and it flew out the window on the way.  We were like "oh sh*t".  We stopped and I parked my truck and we went looking in the middle of the road for a 20 dollar bill.  I felt like I was homeless or something.  This was like at 10 night and some guys yelled at us some names I guess cause we were on the side of the road waiting to go back and see if we could find the money.  We never did.  That sucked.  After that we went to Randals anyways and pulled up and saw her brother and his gf.  They already got some! Yeah, so we just went up there lost 20 bucks for no reason! Were some smart cookies, huh? Well, Frogs mom called her son and left a message earlier and forgot so that's why he was there.  Then Frogs bf calls.  They just got on a break that night. (sorry I left that out earlier) and he says to stay at Randals because he wants to talk to Frog.  We stayed there.  He drove up and they talked for a while and finally we left.  I dropped her off and went to a friends house back where I live.   I walked in the only sober one.  Everyone was either on something or drinking.  I stayed for about an hour and talked then came back home (I was only 2 blocks away from my house).  FINALLY.. Prayed for family and friends then   WENT TO BED!zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz 4th of July! Woke up about seven and went to the gym.  Hardly anyone was there.  I didn't really do much but worked out and came home and took a shower.  I got ready for the day and drove to Livingston.  My old best friend lives there.  I'll call her Rabbit.  Her and her bf got in a fight earlier that day so when I got there she was gone.  Everyone else was there though. All I did was just watch fireworks on the lake and hung out with him and all their friends.  I saw M (Rabbits friend) there! I was really happy to see her.  She hadn't talked to Rabbit all day either and kept trying to get a hold to her.  Yeah, we tried to have fun without her, but it just wasn't the same.  I went to bed around one and woke up and cooked some eggs for everyone, all of ten people in Panchos house (it's the name of his mole on his back).  Now I'm back at home doing nothing but writing this journal thing wondering if anyone ever reads these things.  Anyways, later today I'm going with Frog and some other people to the beach.  I'll be back Tuesday! Ciao-

      From the last place I left off I went to the gym the other day (morning) and now I'm just getting back again (everyday habit). This was yesterday during the day after the gym.   I was about 3,400 miles over my oil change when I got it changed.  I know, not good! Typical girl.  I just didn't have much time.  Went to Florida in June for a week, Tennis camp for another week, Austin for the weekend, Ride jet skis by the Boardwalk another weekend.  Finally stopped and told myself I needed to get some stuff done.  The only thing I really got done, that was good, yesterday was my oil changed.  While I was waiting I read another marvelous chapter in my book.  After I left the Toyota center I came back home and put on some paint clothes.  I volunteer at the Atria, Mondays and some Fridays.  Mondays I am the Bingo caller.  Fridays I do arts and crafts.  I knocked on all their doors to try and round up some people to get in the room where we paint.  Some of them wouldn't answer because they can't walk and some were just surprised that I was there and couldn't say anything.  I knocked on this one lady's door and she said "come in". I went. She was sitting in a chair and her hands were shaking really bad.  I asked her if she wanted to come paint.  She said "don't be mad at me". I said, "I'm not, why would I be mad?", "My hands are too shaky and I haven't slept", the teary eyed lady said.  She wanted to paint so bad but she couldn't.  That made me feel really bad. And the worst part of all is that she was thinking that I was mad at her.  No, I just felt really bad and wanted to give her a hug, but I closed the door and moved on to the next.  No one seemed to answer or they were sleeping.  I came back into the room and there was an old couple painting.  They had already came in there earlier, but I was trying to find more people than us three.  They were cute.  Her cute round face with wrinkles of age in love, smiling.  Her husband right by her side telling her that he's painting a beautiful flower for her.  It was adorable.  Anyways, I left the Atria and went home and took a shower.  I had dinner with one of my friends that I haven't seen in three years.  She's Rumanian.  I moved to my fathers house so she lives where my Mom lives.  She's still the same.  As happy as she could be and just full of joy.  I love her. We ate at Joe's Crab Shack and then did a little shopping.  I enjoyed her company and we caught up on a lot of stuff.  After I dropped her off I went to my Memaw and Papa's.  I love them so much! Every time I come over they just greet me, feed me, and they love me! Grandparents are great! It was really good to see them.  I hung out there and ate banana pudding (homemade).  After I left their house and I checked my cell phone.  My friend called. I went over to their house and watched the Butterfly Effect.  I thought it was a good movie.  A lot of my friends didn't like it though.  I do agree that it is a little strange, but you have to look in depth.  He was trying to play God.  Notice how every time he tried to play God and he was "in control" everything went wrong.  When you let God control your life things seem to go better.  In my life I just recently started letting God control my life instead of me.  Life has been a lot simpler. Anyways, I left my friends house and came back home and went to bed.  I have to cut this short because I'm about to go to a family reunion on my Moms side.  Hopefully I will get to write tonight.

      Ever have that feeling where it just doesn't feel right.  Everything feels just like the wrong way round.  I was reading my book yesterday and it said, "I'm sure his feelings gave him problems just like ours do. Many of us have trained ourselves to live by our feelings, to give in to every implulse and emotion.  As Christians we reject the 'if it feels good, do it' philosophy of our society, but some of it has slowly seeped into our souls.  Our pragmatic society has trained us to believe only what we can see" (Linda Dillow).    The Problem:  We live by our feelings and what we can see  The Solution:  Living by Faith We must live by trusting God for what we can't see.  The Result of living by faith? A calm heart. Yes, that's all from the book I'm reading and it's great.  After reading this my option was last night was to either keep feeling like somethings wrong or just talk with God and have faith into why I'm here and what I'm doing.  Sometimes I wonder, "what's my purpose".  I just have to remember that God planned everything out for my and nothing is by chance.  Sometimes I catch myself saying that and I don't thank Him.  God knows me inside and out.  He knows my feelings and I try to take control of everything and that's when my life goes wrong. Anyways....      I saw the movie Spider Man 2 last night.  It was pretty good, but kinda slow.  I saw it with my friend Moto (keeping the names on the DL).  He's really smart and a great person to talk to.  I enjoyed the company.  Anyways, I'm about to go to the gym.

      Last night was interesting.  I had to take defensive driving for six hours.  I took it at this place called Laff Spot.  It wasn't that bad at all.  I actually laughed and the guy was a comedian so we didn't do much work.  Every 15 min there was a 10 min break.  Anyways, lovely night then I came come at 10:30 and went to bed.  I just woke up and I'm about to go to the gym now.  I normally go every day.  "ILL BE BACK"
