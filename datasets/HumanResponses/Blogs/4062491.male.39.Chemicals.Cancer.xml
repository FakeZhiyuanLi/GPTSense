      Hi All  Well this is my first BLOG and I thought I'd try it out and see what you all think of it. If you like it then I'll keep updating it. I'll try to keep this up to date and current as possible so it does not get boring.   For those visiting this BLOG and are not a&nbsp;part of the 'Buddies' list, here is a brief explanation:  Basically this has developed as a result of an email distribution list from  urlLink JokeShop@rogers.com &nbsp;(no affiliation or association in anyway with Rogers Communications and it's subsidiaries).   The purpose of the email address  urlLink JokeShop@rogers.com &nbsp;is to share anything under 5mb and/or URLs to crazy sites.&nbsp;Anyone with a twisted sense of humour and curiousity for the completely obsurd have joined and sent their fare share of wierd, wacky and even sexually explicit finds from the internet. As a result of certain emails, I do receive feedback to emails sent from me which is appreciated and welcomed however&nbsp;those who complain the loudest strangely never ask me to delete them from the list.   If it's on the internet chances are I emailed it to you. For the guys there is plenty of Porn related crap.&nbsp;I am&nbsp;not shy to pass that around as I am a guy and truly enjoy the piggish nature the male species posesses.&nbsp;I send what I get and find for my own collection and make no appologies for doing so. For the girls, well sorry but the only thing I can say is once in a while you are included one way or another.  For those not yet part of the "List" and want to join, it's as easy as sending me a Non-Work-Related email address, this means an internet email account, and you are in., it's just that easy. Please send your email address to  urlLink JokeShop@rogers.com , or if you wish, SendJokes@rogers.com. I will not use the address for any other purpose but to send you quality eye popping, face cringing stuff.&nbsp; The rules are simple; if iget three days in a row of bounce backs due to Mail Quota at your end then you will be deleted from the list. Please keep in mind that anything goes, and I mean anything goes! If it is immoral to me, and most of the time it will be to you as well unless your just plain sick, I will warn you properly before hand.&nbsp; If you are going away for an extended period of time and cannot check your mail, drop me a line and ask me to remove you from the list and I can re-instate your address when you return.  Well that's it for now, I hope you are still enjoying the smutt, humour and or terrifying nonsense I keep sending, and if you are not a part of my list well then come on, what's the problem? Join in, it doesn't cost anything.  JokeShop@Rogers.com
