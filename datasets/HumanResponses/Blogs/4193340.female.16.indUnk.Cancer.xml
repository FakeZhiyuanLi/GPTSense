LITERALLY.. ( BIGGG thanks to u brett ) .. i got to drive bretts truck.. and i watched brett for hours try to bribe money from his drunken friends.. which by the way  :: did not work :: nice effort though haha -- On a brighter note.. i found out miss ashley holmes herself is n my chemistry class.. YAYYYY.. :0) // lord guys school starts in like 5 days.. that frikn blows some serious ass because that is just not cool ya know-- just for the record.. im still "chuckling" to myself over those crazy drunken dikes tonight.. it was some funny crap- DEF.

       welll.. its about 12 oo clockkk ... and im sitting here at my house alone with my stepdad.. YAYY for me.. last night was about one of the weirdest** nights in my whole life-- no frikn lie-. but today i have an orthopedic appt @ 230.. yes im soo looking forward to it- NO. i hate going there you walk in and theres abunch of people who seriously look like everytime they move they are in serious pain.. and no matter if you show up 30 min early, you never get in when you supposed too.. and if by chance you do- you go and sit in a room in the back for about an hour until the doc. decides hes ready to come in-- how convient for us righT? i know.  but ne ways, last night i went to bretts house, then we decided we would WALK to cody n corys to meet up w/ mace and cody.. we sat around thereeeeee and yes I HAD A TWELVE OCLOCK curfew.. for those of you who dont know.. my curfew is normally BEFORE 11.. that means lindsey is normally home at 1045.. // 12 is much better.. doNt u think? tonight im staying the night with the wonderful kaycie- so is macy bc her mother is not home.. and wont be until like sundayyy - can u actually believe school starts in less than a week.. i dont think im so excited about it anymore.. i just want my car back from miss. ive waited all summmer.. and im beg. to think im long overdue for it to come home- wow guys, im so tired and i went to bed around 1 then my lovely boyfriend calls and wakes me up about 1030 so im like bLah.. but at least he woke me up for a good reason.. HIS CAR IS FINALLY COMING OUT OF THE SHOP.. its about time.. do you know how difficult it is when two people dont have vehicles.. we just kinda sat around bc we had no way of transportation.. talk about totally sucking huh ? its okay though, we made it throughhh :0) lol Absolutely no one is online therefore im stuck blogging my life away on this blogy thing.. thats when you know your at an ultimate boredom.. when you go to a website and just write what youve done.. all day details and everything.. hopefully people are somewhat amused.. and im not the only pyscho who has no life.. at least im giving something back to our community right? welll.. ill come back later and finish this thing..

                  Wow.. so its 11:20 and ive been up sense about 10:45, considering i went to bed at normal time.. despite staying w/ kase  and mace who stayed up until 5.. so needless to say they are still asleep and im wide awake.. and decided to make this blog crap to entertain everyone.. and myself. nice idea right? (( thanks mace)) ne ways.. im jamming to avril right now.. this is after i had to restart macys cool computer because windows play thing wasnt coming on- that only took me about 15 minutes.                 So is anyone except me excited for school.. its not like i actually like the place, i just like the fact of having a ""routine"" everyday, im sure after awhile i will greatly regret the fact that  i was ever ready for it to start, but as of now.. im hyped ya know?--  i went friday and got my schedule-- my classes are..    1-  chemistry-hardaway   2-eng. 3-harper   3-leadership-blackwell   4-financial math-yellott ( YES! i think im the only loser/junior who took this class)   5-am. history- hall   6-health-baggett //  anatomy -bonsall  (( yes! health w/ brett :0) :0) ))   7-anatomy-bonsall// comp. lit- villery   editors note:: yes my anatomy classes change after midterms.. why i have no clue-- i dont awnt to go to the counselors bc i like my classes bc i have alot w/ my friends.. how nerdy am i ? ::  overall.. i like who i have in my classes.. i could go without some people that i have in them.. but i can cope.    Well today my mom left for houston with my brother and her friends and their kids- i decided to stay behind- kinda sad- me n my mother are actually getting along so im kinda depressed she wont be home for a few days, but while shes going i will get to stay w/ mace n kase at Kase's casa.. how frikn lucky am i guys? i probably should have went.. im still in desperate need of school clothes and supplies.. not so much clothes as supplies.. i always wait until last minute to do school things.. and by the time i go-- they have basically nothing.. very much a pain in the ass.. the other day me kase and mace all went shopping n beaumont.. got the same shirts and pants.. WOW TRIPLETS for schoool.. h ow cute are we?..      sorry guys.. but i have absolutely NOTHING to do .. so i keep rambling on about not a dern thing.. in like 11 days miss kels kibbie comes down.. YAY.. drama drama huh girl?.. what an exciting/ interesting week it will be.. ::cant wait::  :0) -- and ive officially decided macy has NOTHING in her house except spaghettio's to eat.. and that does NOT sound appealing- oh and BACON- i love bacon for those who dont know--.. but who honestly wants to get up and cook bacon bc i know my sorry self def. doesnt. thats what i had to cook last time i was here.. nearly burned half my arm off.. linds is not a cooker.. i really feel sorry for my future husband.. he doesnt know what he is getting himself into at allll .. well guys.. i guess im done. im sure ill be back w/ more
