      Standing here at the edge of a cliff Looking across my life at this rift Emotions too strong I feel crushed Everything feels far beyond my touch  A crossroads is here but which way to go Which way is better, does anybody know No eight ball in sight to shake up and ask I'd rather face anything than decide what path

      No matter how I do this No matter what I say I'll be the bitch  Forget the fact you've left me Left alone in the blackness Left to rot away in this ditch  That's okay, I'll be that person I'll be the bad guy, the wrong one I know inside that I'm better than that  I'm tried of this life, this hell Of the way I feel when I'm around you Tired of being here and playing your emotional doormat  I'm pushed to the point that I don't feel I look at you in disbelief and I'm amazed Look what I've turned myself into  Yeah, so what I'm mad and I should be I've turned my life upside down and inside out Just to be what I thought you wanted me to be

      I want to yell at how life can be I am angry that I couldn't see That it wasn't going to be prince's and fairytales That going day to day would be it's own hell   Driving down the road this morning I glanced at passing cars.  I noticed happy people, sad people but I mostly noticed the stuffy people in their pretty expensive cars.  I smiled to myself...happy I'll never be one of them.

      Why do you just push me aside Last night you looked my way and I cried I wonder where our forever lies I feel lost at the thought of our goodbye

      Digging and clawing from the darkness in sight Searching for some hope or a sliver of light Forcing the loneliness to some dank blank space There is such coldness in this bitter empty place  Screaming and shouting for someone to hear Do they not see that I have become controlled by fear It scratches my skin and makes me bleed Mocking my pain as it plants its seed  Terror and fright close in from all sides I slip and I stumble seeking to hide It finds me again and begins to burn in my eyes I hear its laugh as it claims its prize  Crackling and snickering bring me to my feet If I can just overcome the gloom I can have it beat I will not be ruled by such a sinister thing I will fight the pain to fly out on fateâ€™s wing

      Have you ever wished you were the stars To be able to look at life from afar Would the hurt you now feel be any less Or would you think love was just a mess

      I wake in the night with dreams of you Wishing you were here just so you knew The way I feel without ever touching your face If you could only see how my heart can race  I imagine the way your voice sounds in the morning Just the thought of it sends me soaring The way my name would sound across your lips The chance to touch you with my fingertips  I think of you taking away all this pain Of standing with you at dusk in the rain To hold you and watch the sunrise in your eyes To look deep to where this trust I have lies  I dream of touching you, feeling you Knowing what your breath on my skin would do Of falling asleep in your embrace And sensing that this is just a taste

      I once knew a girl who had the brightest eyes She never understood the world was full of lies Each day was met with a sweet embrace Always with an innocent smile upon her face  I once knew a girl who had a trusting heart To see a tear fall would rip her apart Holding her hand out to each person she saw Not knowing or caring that each could make her fall  I once knew a girl whose spirit was light Holding close those around her with all of her might Putting her heart out for each person to see The beauty of her spirit was always the key  I once knew a girl who lived in my soul She made me feel like I was absolute and whole I lost her somewhere along the way If you find her can you tell her to come back and stay
