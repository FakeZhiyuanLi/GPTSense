      I got two Gmail invitations!  As we all know, Gmail is hard to come by.  It's great, though, and I'm going to start using that instead of my provider's email.  I'm now on the hunt for Orkut invitations.  If you have any, please forward them my way!  Jen

      Today was an ordinary day . . . I was off from Wal-Mart and didn't really have anything to do.  There's no food in my house, and it was kind of an adventure trying to find something to eat.  I'm really feeling too lazy to go to the grocery store.  I've been searching for Gmail invites and Orkut invites, but so far to no avail.  Gmail Swap has proven to be a bust as well.  Will has actually done more today than me.  He had some stuff to turn in for classes and wasn't gone long.  On days like today, we both feel like a waste of humanity, but it's nice to not have to do something every day of the week.  Sometimes, it's better just to sit around and have a lazy day playing with the dog.  Jen

      I'm sitting here at 2:30 A.M. wondering . . . is it possible to fall in love with a place?  Is it possible to want to be somewhere so much that you would forsake everything . . . just to have a moment in that place?  I think that is what Chicago is to me, as corny as that may be.  I'm interviewing for jobs at the moment, and I can't sleep.  Part of me really wants the job, but another part wants to fly on a whim.  I know what I   should   do, but there is a great difference between what you should do and what you want to do.  I am so nervous right now--about the job, about the possibility of moving, about everything.  I'm literally at a time in my life when I am in serious upheaval.  It's a transition period, and I don't like it.  I wish I had a crystal ball that would tell me where I will be in five years, ten, twenty even.  Maybe then I would know the path that I am supposed to take.  But no one can tell you that, can they?  You can only do what you feel you should and hope that it is the right decision.  Jen
