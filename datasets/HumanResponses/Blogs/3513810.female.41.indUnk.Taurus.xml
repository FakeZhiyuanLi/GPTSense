      I agree that we need turtles, or Truths, at least that's what experience tells me.  What I question is the veracity of these turtles.    Societies has rules that we sometimes "discover" by breaking, but these rules are not fixed and absolute.  You might say that these rules "emanate" from turtles -- religion, custom, justice, family, etc.  They are not absolutes.  They change sometimes suddenly and other times gradually.  The rate of change and trajectory of change for these rules (and there turles) is not predictable, as evidenced by the "absurdity" of our ancestors' rules, like bathing in underwear and eating at segregated lunch counters.    To bring the discussion to our times, let's look at Iraq. What are the rules at play here and the turtles?  What will people think of them in 10, 20, 100, 1000 years? Bush & Co. are playing their version of "democracy", "justice", "legality", etc.  You and I seem to agree that their version of these rules is erroneous and  dangerous.  We must, admit, however that we don't know squat about what future people will think.  We can try to guess by looking at historical "precedents".  (The Roman Revolution, Cato & Co versus Cesar & Co. for example, makes for rich ruminations as does Sartre & the Communists versus Aron & the "Squares"...)  We can also look to contemporary societies for "comparisons".  At the end of the day, however, we can't be certain of the future events or opinions.   As much as I hate to admit it, in the future, people may look upon the American's actions in Iraq as a positive, even a crucial "catalyst" for some eventual desirable state of affairs.  Maybe there will be widespread democracy à la américain.  Maybe Islam will rule (and people will sings its praises).  Maybe there will be a groovy, new amalgam of Islam and democracy.  Just look at how Ronald Reagan's history is being "rewritten" before our eyes! Are we wrong?  Did we miss something?  It does make me think twice about what I think about Reagan and why, as well as, what I think of "reality" in general.   I admit that I am being polemical about turtles, however I am not "joking".  To try to live without turtles is a "valid" experiment for me.  For one, I would like to test the warning that throwing out turtles will result in egotistical, irrational solipsism; insanity; or nihilism.  "Sinking to the cold, dark bottom of the sea" sounds a lot like "rotting in hell", which is, according to the Catechism teachers of my youth, where I am already going.   For another, I would like to see if turtles makes us better (less egotistical, rational, altruistic, sane and constructive).  Or if,  it may be the case that we are worse not better for our belief.  It's important to acknowled that we spend a lot of time and energy creating and stacking turtles.  Doesn't it seem worth taking the risk to test their value?  Or do you really think we will sink to the cold depths of the sea?    It seems that all we can conclude about turtles is that they provide a mere "semblance" of coherence and consistency.  I see the value of coherence and consistency in some aspects of life, a methodology, for instance.  What makes us think, however, that coherence and consistency are good in other aspects of life?  Or even possible?  If we think about our daily lives, we see instances of chaos peeking out from even our routines.   We can all probably explain the "logic" behind our "systems" for shaving, brushing the dog, vacuuming, mowing the lawn, and  tucking in the kids, but can we really answer why we have that routine?  Why we do it at all?  Doesn't the routine (albeit usefuly) mask a certain incoherence and inconsistency in our lives?  Does a turtle make the routine cohere any better?  Perhaps a more poignant example to examine is the decisions we make to say or act in a specific way, or to "encourage" someone else (like our spouse or kids).  Are we always coherent and consistent?  Or do we appeal to what we might call personal ( i.e. "esthetic")  reasons?  How often are we left saying (perhaps only to ourselves) "We do it this way, because that's the way WE do it"? For example, "WE don't do torture ... ants, dogs, people."  Do we need a turtle to communicate what "WE do and don't do"?   Personally, I think that a turteless, "esthetic reason is any less valid or effective  than a turtleful "rational" one.  Moreover I question the staying power of the "rational" one.  If we are taking a moral stand, it may be the case that an esthetic argument is the safest bet.  It is immune to reason.  We've seen in Iraq, that once you start down the legal, common sense or logical road, morality may get left in a ditch.   It seems that turtles may even enable us  to act "immorally"?  After all, the purpose of the turtle is to provide a reference point from which our decisions and actions can logically, reasonably, rationally unfurl.  Imagine  the question of torture and the following turltes.  Turtle one, Nation.  If an Iraqi prisoner might endanger our country, the. Turtle two, God.  If Christianity is the true religion, then.  Turtle three, Law.  If it is legal to perform the following "stress" activities on prisoners, then.   If, if, if...then...  Turtles release us from the first question.  Why do we have that particular turtle?  It seems to me that turtles do not keep us from sinking to the dark, cold, lonely bottom of the sea.  Moreover, "sinking", "dark" and "bottom" are merely relative positions.  I find the suggested alternative, "floating" to the to the "illuminated" "surface" with the "crowd" to be problematic.   There is no guarantee that one is lighter, cozier our better than the other.     Perhaps it's more appropriate to imagine ourselves taken by an avalanche and needing to find a way to get oriented so that we dig ourselves out, not further in.

      I went to the Dalai Lama to ask, "What holds the World up?"  "A turtle," he responded. "What is under the turtle?"  "Another turtle."  "And under that turtle?"   "It's turtles all the way down!"  For at least the first three and a half decades of my life, I believed in turtles.  They weren't always the same turtles, but there was always at least one holding up my world.  First there was the turtle called my parents, followed by, Susie MacGee (my best friend in elementary school), God, America, the Invisible Hand, Reason, Humanity, Democracy, Socialism, Activism, World Peace, Human Rights...   When I wanted to see my turtle, I would only have to close my eyes and imagine it, and lo and behold, when I opened my eyes, there it was -- shiny, strong, well-formed, and firmly placed.   It's what you might call the "power of prayer", a skill I honed as a fervent Catholic.   Over time, when I suffered from " cognitive dissonance", I replaced each turtle on an as-need basis.  Some turtles persisted longer than others, but it became clear to me that the choice was arbitrary and my own.  They were my inventions, and it was I who selected and kept them, as if they were garments in the emperor's new wardrobe.  They existed by virtue of my believing in them.  Did I continue to believe in them when I came to see them as constructs to be discarded at will?  It seemed at the time I did, but I suspect that I acted as if I believed because I was not willing to part with them.    What did these turtles give me?  An identity.  My turtles helped me define myself in social interactions.  I could wear them like fashion accessories, pointing to them when discussing issues, for instance, my human rights turtle, when discussing torture and the death penalty.  We act as if having a turtle makes a difference.  It appears that to not have a turtle is at best a symptom of moral sloth and at worst, a symptom of "relativism".  Being labeled a "relativist" is like being diagnosed with a degenerative disease.  The prognosis includes egoism, nihilism, immorality, insanity, and can result in ostracism.  Like most taboos, the idea of a being "relativist" is tantalizing.   What would it be like to live without turtles?  Would I lose my moral bearings? My care for other people? My sanity? My friends?   Would I bring about the demise of the civilized world?  Would it be not only self-destructive but also "selfishly" destructive of the world to commit turtles to the dump heap or museum of history?   The problem with "selfishness" as a metric is that it is contingent upon common sense, and common sense is notoriously unreliable on all kinds of questions: scientific, moral, legal.  What constitutes "selfishness" in the case of the turtles?  Is it "selfish" to admit that you don't believe if you think it is impossible to be certain of the value of turtles?  Or is it "selfish" to not admit disbelief in order to perpetuate a "beau mensonge", a useful lie? "Selflessness" is one of the turtles I try to resist seeing.    "Resisting turtles" is not an easy undertaking. It seems to be "natural" (whether through genes or culture) for us to believe. Like most people I act as if I am equipped  with a turtle making tool and with the drive to use it.  It's not that Turtles, like Vitamin C, works whether you believe in them or not, but rather that they don't make a damned bit of difference.  As long as I'm not bothered about not believing in turtles and no one else knows, it makes no difference to my daily life.  The fact is that it doesn't change how I make decisions.  It doesn't change how I treat other people.  It simply does not matter what specific turtles are or are not holding up my world.  It doesn't matter to me and it doesn't matter to other people.  In fact no one else would ever need to know I was turtle-less if I didn't tell them.  Moreover, there is no way to know whether or  not others really believe in turtles.  Maybe their public opinions and bumper stickers are a front.    Custom says that we are to leave other people's turtles alone, unexamined.  We aren't supposed to talk about "sacred" beliefs, such as religion, politics and family relations. It used to bother me that this taboo existed. It seemed like a vehicle for delusion.  Now I see the taboo as liberating.  It means that I am free to live without turtles.  Until very recently, I have taken the habit of "having" turtles as proof of its necessity to human existence.  Now I have shifted the burden of proof to the believer.    Why have I changed my mind?  It's easier? Turtle stacking is tricky.  Mostly they don't fit together well and there is no reason to think they ever will.  After all, what has capitalism go to do with democracy? Catholicism with morality? World peace with organic vegetables?.  Usually one turtle is not enough to hold up a world.  Once there is more than one, there are conflicts and contradictions.   The never-ending process of selecting, reshuffling, restacking and balancing beliefs is major preoccupation, if not occupation.  Unchecked it can consume the entire public and private spheres of life.  It's a relief not to have to keep track of them anymore.  It reminds me of the adage, "It's best not to lie, but if you're going to lie, it's better to have a good memory".    It is so difficult to remember all our beliefs, that I think it worth considering life without turtles.     Let's try a simple experiment.  Close your eyes.  Imagine that there are no theoretical underpinnings for democracy, humanity, family, nation, every turtle you care about.  Tell yourself you don't believe in turtles.  Go around for a day and see what happens.  Do you become a nihilist? Depressed? Morally depraved?  Do you lose your friends?  I would like to point out that there was a day when people were afraid to travel across the Atlantic Ocean.  They were told that they might fall off the edge of the Earth.  When a few brave sailors tried it, they didn't fall off.  Were they nihilistic or morally depraved for trying? By definition, yes, because it is society that determines morality.  This morality, however, is not an absolute and, furthermore, it is impossible to predict what will be considered "nihilistic" and "morally depraved' in the future.  A belief in a specific turtle now does not hold any guarantee for your morality in the future or viewed by posterity.  Speculation about causes and effects, outside the controlled scientific experiment, is itself a turtle.  We have no reason to believe that we can shape or predict the future based on observed "facts" in the present.  I like to imagine a world in which no one believes in turtles.  I envision us freed from our turtles, including the turtle of causality, rising like a balloon that has dropped its last sandbag.  Perhaps this self-liberation, this detachment from the imaginary problem of turtle stacking, is what  the Buddha taught and what Milan Kundera referred to as the "Incredible Lightness of Being".

      Americans are gregarious.   We smile at, say hello to and strike up conversations with strangers.  We invite new acquaintances home for dinner and bake cookies for the newcomers across the street.  We pride ourselves in being open, friendly, neighborly, even in our work places and public institutions. For many Americans, being a "team player", "community member", in other words, gregarious, is a synonym for being American.  It's a point of distinction with most Europeans, and for some, a point of honor.  It's fun.  It's inclusive.  It's democratic.  What could possibly be wrong with it?  What's wrong is that gregariousness may have unintended negative consequences.  When we are gregarious, especially to people who are not accustomed to gregariousness, we may be sending an ambiguous, or even negative message.   Our friendly overture may suggest that the differences between us do not matter.  That "differences do not matter" can be taken in various ways.  One way is that even if you have a different accent, skin color, religion, political party, we can still be friends.  On a less positive note, however, we may we also send the message that "we are not going to acknowledge our differences". To ignore differences by making light of them, even out of niceness, may have a negative effect.     Common sense tells us that conflict is bad.  Where there are differences, there is often conflict.  If by avoiding differences we might avoid conflict, it follows logically that it is best not to acknowledge differences.  On the other hand, we have learned from psychoanalysis and history that the price of short-term peace may be a crisis further deepened by all forms of repression.   Take as an example the contested presence of U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia after the First Iraq War.    Many Saudis were angered by their continued presence and made public complaints especially after the Americans ignored their request to keep American women soldiers from driving in public.  I remember that a lot of jokes circulated in the U.S. at the time about the Muslim fundamentalism and Arab culture in general.  We didn't acknowledge any difference between our cultures.  We acted as if their culture were the same, which was interpreted by some, most notably Osama Bin Laden, as a way of asserting our cultural hegemony. Who knows what connection if any could be made between the attacks on September 11 and our failure to acknowledge our differences?  It is striking that we are now at war with an entire culture whose differences we did not recognize.  I do not want to condone the curtailment of women's freedoms in Saudi Arabia.  My point is to critically examine gregariousness, which we American often take for granted as a desirable and admirable character trait.   It is possible that it is a problem for us in our relations with other cultures and our political process.  Is it possible that it is a sign of ethnocentrism?  Or a symptom of repression?  Might we duping ourselves into thinking that gregariousness is a positive character trait just because it feels "gemütlich" (homey, comfortable) to us who have grown up with it?   It is interesting to note that there are democracies in which gregariousness is not an extant trait.  Take France, for instance, an example that may infuriate some people, because the French appear to obstruct American efforts at democratization.  The French are often portrayed as cold, unfriendly, unhelpful, contradictory and contemptuous. When I first moved to France, I must admit to having perceiving their behavior that way.  I wondered: why don't they say hello when we "meet" on the street?  Why do they stare unabashedly at each other and me while sitting in the café?  Why are their schoolteachers so cold to the children?   Don't they realize what a even better place France would be -- with its great food, wine, culture, social programs, academic standards and intellectual traditions -- if only its people were only more gregarious?  More American?    Now that I have lived in France a few years, I do not see their aloof behaviors in the same way.  Rather, I have redescribed them as examples of "respect", "autonomy" and "discretion".  Similarly, I have changed my perception of gregariousness.  It strikes me as dangerously ambiguous.  Couldn't gregariousness be viewed as insincerity, inconstancy, disrespect, intolerance and self-indulgence?   Couldn't it be considered exhibitionism or the sign of a craven need to be liked?  Couldn't it be seen as a tendency toward conformism -- an invitation to manipulation, oppression and domination?  In what way does gregariousness make us better participants in a democracy?  Is it possible that it make us less critical?  More sheep like?  Is it possible that it is an opiate for the masses and that it serves the bellicose ends of our political leaders?  The French, for all of their modish behavior in other aspects of their lives, display no gregariousness in their relationship to the State and its institutions.  Schoolteachers, for instance, do not attempt to "create a classroom family". I must admit that some teachers seem to take this to the limit of alienation.  Although other teachers and administrators recognize the extremism of their colleagues, they do not tend to intervene on the part of the child.   School is not supposed to be fun.  The meanness of some teachers is representative of a general attitude of detachment and severity that the teachers display toward their students.  School is supposed to inculcate a spirit of skepticism and contrariness regarding all institutions.  The classroom is not supposed to be a family.  The family is supposed to be a family.  The classroom is supposed to be a classroom.  That "school is no fun" may be the price the French pay for freedom and autonomy.   In France, this division between the family and the State may lead to other problems, for instance France's recent legislation prohibiting the wearing of the veil in public schools. I am not defending France's legislation against the veil, which I oppose, but rather I am pointing out that there are other democratic models for the citizen.  Contrary to common belief in the U.S., it is not to create the sensation or the goal of one big happy family, in order to be a democracy.  What makes us think that a sense of "family" is good for young citizens in a democracy?  Why are we advocating the complex interpersonal relations of the family in the public sphere?  Don't we risk muddying the waters?  If a French teacher undertook to cultivate a "classroom family".  I suspect that the administration and the public would immediately and severely reprimand him or her. In France, there is a "terre brülée" (a scorched earth) between the individual and the State.  The French do not look to these institutions for personal affirmation.  The school is not, for instance, charged with the mission of cultivating a positive sense of self in its students.  In fact, I suspect that most French people would find the American "classroom family" to be creepily proto-totalitarian.  This separation in France between the individual and the state presents a paradox, which I have found perplexing.  This individual who is self-defined as "contestetaire" (in opposition to all institutions) is the same individual who "depends" on the State in terms of subsidies for child care, health care, education).  I don't claim to fully this paradox, but I would point out that it hinges on the word "depend".   I think that "depend" comes from me, the American observer, who assumes that all aid from the state is synonymous with dependence.   That is an American (capitalist?) myth.   I believe that the French don't see it that way.  It seems that the subsidies are their right -- that the state owes its existence to the support of individuals, and it exists to support them as individuals.    Being French seems to include opposing the State. I would go so far as to say that the sense of self that the French aim for, their myth of the individual, is formed in opposition to the state, and that liberty includes this opposition.  Moreover, they seem to be very proud of the fact that they have this relationship to their State.  There is no denying their pride in being French.    Whereas the American motto is "love it or leave it", the French motto could be expressed as, "leave it and love it".   In a perverse way, the French opposition to American hegemony could be read as a back handed compliment.  The French political leaders are treating the United States as the individual French citizen treats his or her government -- with contempt.  It is unthinkable to most Americans that contempt is an acceptable and appropriate attitude to hold toward political power.  For many French it may be the only acceptable relationship to have.

      I must admit that the terrorists have succeeded.  I am scared.  I am scared about flying back to the United States this summer, taking the tram into the center of town, dropping my children off at school, even going inside a crowded elevator at the university. One day I got up and left a conference on the Chicago School of Sociology when a sociologist of Middle Easter origin left his suitcase in the middle of the room.  It turns out that he had only gone to the bathroom.  I later attended the presentation he made and was ashamed at having let myself be carried away by fear.   I am not just worried about being blown up personally.  I am terrified to imagine that someone I love might be maimed or killed and that they might witness such a scene of carnage.   How would anyone go on living after that?  This morning I saw a car parked on the sidewalk in front of our daughters' school, between the road barriers and the playground fence where cars aren't allowed to park.  As soon as I saw it, I was overwhelmed with fear.  I would have liked to run away with my family.  I resisted the urge and  held a frantic, interior dialogue: should I turn around and take the girls home? Alter our route to avoid the car?  Tell the principal about the car? Or walk straight by it and leave the kids at school like I always do?   I looked around at the other children and parents chatting, and saying good bye like they always do, and I wondered whether or not anyone else had noticed the car.  Were they worried by its presence?  Had the threat of a terrorist attack ever consumed them the way it was consuming me?  The fact that today is June 11 didn't help.  For months, I have noticed that my anxiety grows as we approach the eleventh of the month.  This month, however, I was frequently overcome by dread -- to the point that I have had numerous nightmares and one morning even vomited . Is this a new monthly cycle?  It's hard for me to imagine what it used to be like, when I rarely knew the exact date. I feel like someone who has just become ill with an invasive ailment?  The overwhelming question is whether or not my ailment will ever go away. Will it get worse, to the point that I can't function?  Will I infect others?   What's the best way to cope with it?   One possible response is a recourse to statistics.  After all, it is more likely that a loved one be the victim of a traffic accident than of a terrorist attack.  But this doesn't help.  Because of the randomness and high visibility of attacks, there is no enduring salvo for me in statistics.  Another recourse, is to adopt a Buddhist outlook.  If were less attached to life, there would be no cause for fear.  This outlook is appealing to me aesthetically, and one which I believe might help me to cope if I were alone.  However, I am living very happily in the midst of my beloved family.  I find it impossible to imagine relinquishing my attachment to my children.  It seems that I have no choice but to be terrified.  This morning, I held my course past the abandoned or parked car and gave the children an extra hug when saying good bye.  I didn't want to  let on that I was anxious, and I don't think I did. Ironically, I was confronted with fear for their physical lives and chose to protect their emotional lives.  And perhaps my own too.  If I were to cave in to my terror today, what might happen?  Would I upset the children if I told them why?  Would I lie to them?  Would I tell their teachers, friends, friends' parents?  Would I keep them home in general?  Would I stop working to do so?  What would happen if other people did the same?   It seems to me that the terror in terrorism comes in part from this hellish imaginary world which threatens at each second to become our real lives.  It's only our personal resolves that keeps it at bay.

      It seems to me that there might be a lot to learn by publicly examining our family conversations about politics.  When we talk to our family members about politics, even if we disagree with them and express our frank opinions, we are inclined to find a way to maintain our relationships.  The conciliatory nature of the exchange sets it off from most political discourse.  It would be fascinating to look at these private conversations.  As interesting as it might be, it's difficult to imagine a scenario in which people would be willing to make such conversations public. There's a taboo against it. Conversations between intimates are supposed to be private.  If you want to test the taboo, try revealing a private conversation about someone's beliefs, opinions or values.  If the interlocutor hears about it, you can expect a swift and harsh reprimand or, worse yet, ostracism.    Most people probably wouldn't even be tempted by the challenge.  We find the idea of revealing our private lives too creepy to test.  It seems like voyeurism and a self-indulgent erosion of the private sphere.    But is this highly esteemed private sphere merely an excuse for avoiding self-examination and improvement of our democracy?    The private sphere is after all just another social construct. It could be argued that we make or acquire nothing that is really private.  Anything that we have (art objects, essays, letters, photos, books, diaries, bills, stamp collections, underwear, larders full of salad dressing) may be sorted through by someone else some day.  By claiming to have a private life, are we deluding ourselves?  Is this delusion pernicious?  A case be made, for breaking this taboo, denouncing the private sphere, at least in so far as politics are concerned.  After all, we live in a democracy.  Should we treat political discourse differently depending on who we are talking to?  Should we treat people differently if, we are all citizens, and thus, equally responsible for the vigor of our democracy?  Freud, and psychoanalysts in general, undertook to make it "healthy" and socially acceptable to talk about sex, which was no small feat if you consider how uptight the Victorians were. Some day will our descendants look upon us as political prudes?  The repressed who rejected the political talking cure?  If we knew that we would learn more about how and why we formulate our political beliefs would we open up our private conversations about politics?  If we knew that our democracy would be healthier?  Or should we eschew all interrogations of the private sphere?  Is the taboo a warning signal that we ought to heed?  Is it possible that if we cede some of our private sphere to the public sphere, we will lose it completely?  Is the private sphere the only thing between us and totalitarianism?

      As an American ex-patriot living in France, I don't experience the "buzz" of politics which most people are surrounded by in their daily lives.    The buzz is made up of the conversations, talk shows, stories and jokes we hear or overhear all day long as we drive, work, cook, clean, get our mail, hang out with our friends and pick up the kids at school.  Most of the people I know here are not American, and even if they are, they are no more connected to the daily American life than I am.    Without the buzz, I feel a kind of detachment from the social and political situation in the U.S..  This detachment is both liberating and oppressive. I feel liberated in that I am virtually alone to think about the information I get via electronic news and to formulate an opinion free from the static interference of social interactions.  Moreover, I am not preoccupied in the same way by my social and  professional reputation.    It is possible that the fact that I feel freer now is due to a pathology on my part.  I did experience a certain amount of trauma growing up as a New York transplant and the principal's daughter in a small New Hampshire town.   I suspect that although I may be more susceptible to peer pressure than the average person, most grown ups are not immune to it.  Most of us seem to struggle to reconcile our reputations with our autonomous ideas.  You could say that by being an ex-patriot I have avoided the struggle.  Since I am not part of the buzz, I am not preoccupied with presenting a respectable social and professional "front" on a day to day basis.  I am free to  cultivate  new ideas, like experimental plantings in a garden.  Bully for me, but why should anyone who is living in the "middle of life" back in the States, who may hold a position in which their public opinions could affect their private lives, take them seriously?    I'll set aside the question of "holding a position" and being in the "middle of life".  Whether or not these spatial references are real or imaginary, chosen or necessary is a complicated question and rich in material for a longer essay.  Let's simply look at my legitimacy as an ex-patriot from the point of view of the American living in the States.   If an opinion is formulated and expressed by someone who does not have to "wear" it to the general store, playground and water bubbler, why should anyone take it seriously?     My imaginary problem is not unlike that of the politicized college student whose parents refuse to take her opinions seriously, because she is not really living in the world as a "grown up". They may advise her to wait and see how she feels about things when she has responsibilities, i.e. a family and a reputation to maintain.  Of course, the retort of the young activist may be "What a convenient way to maintain the status quo!"  or "How bourgeois!"  or "By then it will be too late!  The world will already be created in the image of the next bourgeois."   I am not a young activist.  I'm not young and I don't want to be an activist, by that I mean someone who is foremost a "woman of action", someone who tries to effect political change and thus, moves between important issues.    I would like to see changed effected, but I am more conservative about the way to affect that change.  I would prefer to be a "woman of science" as Max Weber put it, a person focused on understanding the situation.  Of course, as Weber was well aware, it is difficult, if not impossible, to separate these two modes.  Nonetheless we can choose to focus one mode or the other, and my intent is to focus foremost on the knowing.    Out of the Iraq fiasco, one of the foremost issues which has emerged for me is personal responsibility.  Who is responsible for what goes wrong in American politics and policies? Are we like members of a corporation (an S.A. -- a  "société anonyme" as the French say) who have voting powers and receive dividends but are indemnified personally?  Or should we be held responsible in some way for our political opinions?  Should elected officials be held responsible for the effects of their governance?  Currently, our democratic process allows great freedom to its participants, both the representatives and the represented, but it demands little liability.  Are their negative consequences to this freedom?  What would happen if we introduced liability in some form or another?   Thinking about personal liability probably gives most people the willies.  Isn't anonymity and indemnity necessary for the democratic process?  Who would want to vote if it weren't?  express an opinion? hold an office?  Obviously, introducing liability would shake up the system.  Common sense tells us all not to mess with such a complicated idea.    It is important to recognize that  we are already in a mess and would do better to take some initiative in sorting out the problems with our democracy.  What worries me most about Americans is that we are too quick to forgive and forget.  I am not an advocate of retribution.  However, I am an enemy of deception, including self-deception.  I think we have to pinch ourselves hard to stay awake and take the initiative to understand how a nice country like ours got in a bad place like this.    Thinking about responsibility in democracy may be the kind of pinch we need.  To get beyond our reflex for self preservation, perhaps it is best to think of the an exercise, a brainstorming device.  The book group, for example, is the kind of place we try out such an exercise with others without having to "go public".     By brainstorming about responsibility and other topics in politics, perhaps we could become aware of the way we think and speak about politics.  Currently we hear a lot about abstract forces, such as, freedom, democracy, dictatorship, Islam, terrorism, justice, intelligence gathering and patriotism -- terms which are ill-defined and emotive.  It seems to me that talking in the abstract makes rational discourse impossible.   Perhaps by examining responsibility in politics, we will learn to speak of the specific individual and collective actors, their actions and the outcomes of those actions.

      President Bush, in his announcement of George Tenet's resignation as Director of the C.I.A., described Tenet as resolute and the kind of person you want to have as a public servant because of this quality.  Through this accolade of Tenet, Bush revealed the importance he places on resolve.   Few people would contest that it is a character trait which Bush aspires to and his supporters admire. The image seems to be equally valued by his administrative team.   They pride themselves on being tough on terrorism, unyielding in the face of international dissent and willing to "go it alone" when necessary.  Is being "resolute" all that it's cracked up to be?  I don't think so.  Resolve has its down side, too.  Look at Iraq.  If we hadn't been so willing to "go it alone", would we have gone to war in the name of eradicating  weapons of mass destruction?  Would we be scrambling to make a multi-national exit strategy?  If we had not resolved to end the war quickly and with few troops, would we still be fighting for peace? If we had showed a little less resolve, would we have created a more desirable reputation in the world and changed our international relations for the better?  Where can we look to understand the consequences of having "resolve"?  One place that we all know first hand is our experience of interpersonal relations.  Resolve is frequently at hand.  Sometimes it may be portrayed positively by terms such as being persistent, goal-centered, focused.  At other times, it may be referred to by less flattering names -- for instance, being strong headed, stubborn, unyielding, close minded , immature or just plain stupid.  After all, isn't "being resolute" a way in which you could redescribe the intransigence of a spouse or the tantrum of a two-year-old?     In my mind, the term "resolute", which has an immediate positive connotation for most people, masks the complexity of human interactions.  It is a euphemism which denies the latent struggle present in encounters with other people, the struggle to preserve our unique person and to admit the unique person of the other.      Does Bush bandy about the euphemism "resolute", because he doesn't know about its negative side?  Does he assume that we Americans are uncritical of resolve and will remain that way?  At best, Bush and we live by a myth, the "myth of the resolute".  Wrapped up in this myth is a conception of the individual as enlightened and virtuous (or why else would we be resolute)?  At worst, it's a clever campaign tool.  Whatever its source, "tout se passe comme si" (all is unrolling as if) we believe that this version of the self is embraced by the American public.  When we accept "resolute" in a list of positive character traits, are we saying that we prefer to the version of ourselves prescribed by the "myth of the resolute" to alternative versions, for example, "the myth of the listener", "teacher", "healer", "diplomat", "ambassador", "truth seeker" or "conflict mediator"? What is the value, if any, in this "myth of the resolute"?  If it has any value, it lies in being a myth that gives a partial solution to our existential angst.  Despite our progressive understanding of the world through the sciences, the world is and probably always will be an unknowable and unpredictable place.   Hard as we may try , we can't know, let alone control, our personal and collective destinies.  Not even for our children.  Moreover, we must come to terms with the fact that we are all going to die.  It is unusual, perhaps, to be reminded of the human condition in a discussion of politics and social interactions, but the human condition leaves its imprint on our politics and personal myths whether we recognize it or not.    Contingency and death.  It is scary to confront these two inescapable realities that preoccupy all of us and that we talk about so infrequently.  Like Freud showed us in his analysis of dreams, jokes and habits, what we repress finds its way out in other places.  For me, the myth  of "being resolute" is a delusion and a symptom of our repression.    "Being resolute", although it may serve a partial solution to our angst is not a solution to the unsolvable problem of the cause of our angst -- contingency and mortality.  It is important to recognize that "being resolute" may be an effective coping mechanism for individuals. (It may provide psychic comfort and help us become and remain functional).  Nonetheless, it bears with it significantly negative side effects. We are deluded if we think we can will ourselves into a state of control and immortality.     Bush, in applauding Tenet for being resolute, and exemplifying his own resolve in the face of each new crisis, may be soothing the existential angst of the American voter and providing an example of personal functionality, but he is also teaching us (along with others) to live in denial of our human condition.  ( I'll point out that there are many signs of the depths of Bush's denial.  For example, he admitted unabashedly to not reading the newspapers.  This practice is ununsual for a world leader and points to a willingness to eschew conflicting points of view, rather than face potential cognitive dissonance.)  It is important to note that the human condition is what we have in common with all people -- terrorist and non-terrorist, present, past and future.    Is Bush's version of "being resolute", the only one there is?  Are there other ways that are more critical and self-reflexive?  Ones which take into consideration the negative consequences of being merely resolute and which, thereby, leave a space for considering divergent points of view and for changing your mind?  Is "being resolute and open to change" still "being resolute"?  Or is there a fundamental problem with "being  resolute"?  Does it lead directly to social and political impasses?  Does resolve mean that we will never admit conflicting evidence, change our minds or apologize?    Does "being resolute" mean that we would rather have the whole thing go up in flames than let go of our convictions?  If so, is "being resolute" something we ought to hope for in ourselves and in our leaders?  No, I do not believe so.  To be honest, I think it is diametrically opposed to what  a leader should be.  "Resolve" frightens me.  It is a sign that a person is immune to evidence, that he or she is acting upon conviction and thus, beyond the limits of human knowing.  It could be argued that we all exhibit some degree of resolution each time we speak or act.  Defining yourself as resolute, however, is to aspire to the most extreme form of conviction.  "Being resolute" is the first character trait I would give for an Al Qaeda terrorist.    Does abandoning the myth of the resolute mean abandoning social and political engagement?  Absolutely not, although it is often the counter myth provided by the proponents of the 'myth of the resolute".  Being irresolute and being responsible are not contradictory.  In fact it could be argued that it is only by being irresolute, rather than resolutely fixated on a particular point of view, that you can be open to evidence and willing to reconsider your point of view in order to take the most responsible actions possible.    If you want to live by this version of the individual, it is necessary to confront the counterparts to the "myth of the resolute", the "myth of the spineless worm" or the "myth of the knee jerk liberal".     Perhaps our political and social discourse would be improved by the invention of some alternative myths we could live by.

      My husband Jeff and I tried to launch a "virtual salon" in order to discuss the Iraq situation and democracy in general.  The salon was a flop, so we shelved the project for now.  I hope to be involved with something like in the future.  Here is a posting I made to that salon in which I tried to make a case for the potential power of such an on-line discussion group:  In Jeff's first post, he said that he was trying to not have opinions, except about Iraq because a moment of history has arisen which makes it impossible not to have an opinion. I have felt the same urgency to become political. Like Jeff, I am critical and suspicious of my sense of responding to a "call".   For one reason, there have been many moments in the history of the world at which people have been politicized. Jeff invoked the Dreyfuss Affair. He could have invoked any one of a number of political crises including the Salem witch trials, the McCarthy investigations, the anti-Viet Nam War protests, the Civil Rights Movement, Kent State, CIA operations in Latin America, "Iran Gate", the Alaskan pipeline, the Lake Mead project, the Spotted Owl -- and that's just some of the possibilities in the contemporary history of the U.S. let alone the rest of the world. The fact that I could reel off such a long list with so little effort raises a question for me. Isn't there a crisis ready-to-hand for anyone who is looking to become political? As Virginia Woolf remarked (and the Pythagoreans before her) even when we walk across the grass we can imagine the screams of the creatures we are crushing. What constitues a moment that compels us to be political?   This question leads me to reflect upon the crisis of 1968 in France, where a slogan emerged, "Mieux vaut avoir tort avec Sartre que raison avec Aaron." (Better to be wrong with Sartre than right with Aaron). As far as I understand the situation, Sartre, a charismatic and persuasive public intellectual advocated revolutionary change in society. Aaron, a "square", failed at first to raise opposition to revolution despite the mounting evidence that actual communist governments were totalitarian. Sartre and his supporters seemed to have become immune to evidence.   Are there circumstances in which we can defend being immune to evidence? Religious faith may be one such circumstance. St. Paul, Kierkegaard, Pascal, the Buddha, among others, have showed that for the faithful, the commitment to faith is of a different nature than reason. As Pascal said in Les Pensées, "The heart has its reason which Reason cannot know."   Regarding personal faith conviction (a belief derived despite contrary evidence, i.e. irrational ) seems defensible. (I recognize that this point is highly debatable!) But is there a role for a conviction, the irrational, in politics? When we adopt an opinion and act upon it politically, is it possible that we change our mind? If so, what evidence would it take for us to change an opinion? If it is possible that under some unknown, future circumstance we may change our opinion, what kind of actions do we choose in the present?   The example of Jane Fonda springs to mind. The only facts I facts I know are true about Jane Fonda are that she opposed the U.S. war against Viet Nam, made a visit to North Viet Nam and was photographed in front of some North Vietnamese anti-aircraft missiles for which she later apologized. What I find relevant to this discussion is Fonda's conviction. I would like to know more about her "conversion". For example, what contributed to her politicization including sociological and psychological analysis, as well as her version or versions of the story? Did she ever study or discuss theory? What made her decide to become an activist? What does she think about the opinion she held then?   Her actions marked the rest of her life and the history of the U.S. in ways that no one could ever fully understand. Her action constituted an "event" at the time and continues to occupy a place in our collective memory. Although no one could ever measure the specific effects of her action, it seems to have been a watershed. Like with all "events" (whatever their scope and magnitude), "way leads onto way". Our present contains our past, including Jane Fonda's visit to North Viet Nam and all of the subsequent re-visitations of the event through various means, including news reports, interviews and family discussions.   If we believe that the present contains the past and the possibilities for the future, then it is apparent that expressing one's opinions is a weighty responsibility. To have an opinion and act on it is to affect our world in contingent ways. How can we be certain that our opinion is founded and our subsequent acts justified?   One possible means is to subject our ideas to a kind of peer review -- like academics do. By consulting others, we may avoid being rash, but how do we protect ourselves from being co-opted -- of letting ourselves be swayed by "common sense". "Common sense" is after-all, a more problematic term than it appears at first. Our everyday interpretation of "common sense" is that it is desirable, because it is moderate, measured, rational. Upon reflection, however, "common sense" takes on a more sinister character, derived from the word "sens" (direction in French) -- a unidirectional movement of mass thinking.   The question then arrives as to which society to submit one's opinions for review. Considered in this light, the potential power of the virtual salon takes on a new dimension. Should we be talking to each other at all or simply posting our thoughts independently without inviting or offering further comment? If we are going to converse, who do we want to include -- people who are more like us or less? Should there be any ground rules for interaction?

      This is my Gehenna, a written version of the web of ideas I live with.     Some ideas appear to stand alone, embedded in a web of strong threads that isolate them from others.  Others cluster together so closely that they seem (probably erroneously) to be linked strongly to one another.  Still others dangle by a few threads. I believe that one idea is likely to hide at least another. For that reason I compare my Gehenna to a Tarantula's web, a web as thick as it is wide.  This web is a web of appearances, but they are what I live with.  Some of these ideas are ugly or may become ugly over time, and I may be tempted to change them or to tear them out for the sake of appearances.  Any such sacrifice is likely to leave its trace in this Gehenna.  Moreover, I believe that the ideas I attempt to suppress will reemerge elsewhere in perhaps only a slightly veiled form.   That is what makes writing my Gehenna so frightening and so tantalizing.  By writing, I rendering a version of my interior life, exterior, where it exists as a kind of living record of my conscience and consciousness.    Am I trying to become self actualized through the Gehenna? Am I trying to affect how other people think?  Am I trying to contribute a cultural relic, like the pottery shards, Gallic fibulas and newspaper clippings social historians collect and analyze?    Am I doing this for me, for someone else, for "society" or humanity?  And why have I, at aged 41, someone who has never written for publication before, decided to write in a public forum now?   One version I live by is my recent "calling" to politics.  Since the Bush Administration started threatening to "go it alone" in Iraq, I've opposed the invasion. Now and again I have stated my opinion whenever the "occasion arose".  Since the photos and news broke of torture in the Iraqi prisons, however, I have "become politicized".  What I mean by becoming politicized is that I feel an irrepressible need to express myself freely and frankly against not only the acts of torture (which I see as only symptomatic of a systematic problem) but also the policies of President Bush and his advisors and the complacency of the American press and public. I want to talk about how a "nice" country like us got ourselves into a "bad" "place" like this.    My need to do something is so strong that it would be easy for me to take recourse to myths and fabulations in order to describe the totality of its grip on me.  It seems to me that the gravity of the situation requires me stop my quotidian life, direct all of my attention to the Iraqi situation and try to get others to do the same.   It's as if a wet dog has gotten into the pup tent while I'm making dinner over the camp stove.    The wet dog phenomena is familiar to me.  When I was a college student twenty years ago, I abandoned myself to the anti-Apartheid movement.  We were protesting our university's investments in companies in racist South Africa and were part of a larger political movement calling for divestment by all American and international corporations.  On our campus, we built shanties and held protests, teach-ins and sit-ins.  During that time, it seemed not only useless, but inappropriate to continue to got to class, study, exercise, wash and eat.  Every quotidian act felt like a slide toward co-optation.  The need to be political was so total and unremitting that it seems fitting to use the word "a calling" with its religious connotations.    I feel that calling again now.  And yet, I am acutely aware that the Iraq situation falls rather conviently for me.  Having recently decided to become a political theorist, what better opportunity than a political crisis to define myself and my work?  Because of the convenience of the issue to my career aspirations, I am doubly suspicious of my ability to interpret evidence.  Am I selecting what I want to see (whether consciously or unconsciously the effect seems to be the same)?  Am I denying any evidence that contradicts my interpretation?  What evidence would have to appear for me to change my mind about the situation?   Moreover, what is the appropriate response given my reservations regarding my calling?  I want to be careful to neither abandon the call nor invent a myth of urgency to suit my own illusions or interests.  "Mieux vaut avoir tort avec Sartre, que raison avec Aron!" (Better to be wrong with Sartre than right with Aaron!" is a mantra that frequently sounds in my head.  It's a phrase that political activists chanted in France during the uprisings in 1968.  The question was whether to support Communism with Jean Paul Sartre, a communist, or oppose it with Raymond Aron, a conservative.  Sartre, a charismatic public figure and persuasive writer, won "blind" support for communism in the face of mounting evidence that Russia and other communist states were abusive, totalitarian regimes.  Aron, who had evidence on his side, failed to communicate his criticisms of communism to those who were "called" to politics with Sartre, mostly because Aron was a "square".    The lesson I have drawn from this scenario is that it is difficult and important to be both receptive and critical of ALL evidence -- evidence that supports and undermines my current position.  I  don't think that it is possible, nor desirable, to live a life free of opinion (although it is an interesting exercise to try).  I believe, however, that I -- like most people -- hold too many opinions, arrive at them hastily and cling to them tenaciously.   Perhaps in general it is useful to our survival that we are tenacious and complacent.   It seems to me, however, that at times our quality of life and survival are threatened by complacency.  At these times our myth of the status quo is dangerous.  I fear that Americans are facing such a time right now.  I am not calling for a revolution.  I support democracy.  What I want is for the American people to demand accountability from our government.    There is plenty evidence that Bush and his circle of advisors are guilty of having systematically abused and misused their power.  They have used the treat of terrorism (albeit a real threat) to convince the American people, legislature and press to accept the erosion of American civil rights, the invasion of Iraq, the abuse of human rights and the weakening of many of our foreign relations.  I want Bush and company to admit their guilt and apologize.  Moreover I want the entire team of advisors under Bush to resign, as outlined by Al Gore in his recent speech.   By merely permitting them to remain, after mishandling their offices, we are accepting their dishonesty.  Moreover, we are potentially exposing ourselves to further manipulations?  After all, what is to keep the government from silencing dissenters? I have to admit to being nervous about returning to the U.S. this summer from our home in France.  Will we be stopped and "questioned" as "enemies of the government"?  That may seem paranoid, but don't we have a parallel system of "justice" in place?  And what is to keep the Administration from  "influencing" the elections through press releases?  Haven't they already issued a renewed terrorist advisory, despite the absence of any evidence of heightened concern? Resignation is the only honorable thing for Bush's team; and that is the only situation that Americans should accept.  In addition to the resignation of the Bush team, we should also compel our political leaders to be honest.  That includes John Kerry.  Why do we accept that the Republican and Democrat campaign committees are deliberately falsifying information?  Although I do not believe it is possible for anyone to be completely honest with him or herself all the time, if at all, I do believe that it is possible to live by standards for truth that are higher than the ones we live by now as a political people.  Maybe we all ought to be writing Gehenna!
