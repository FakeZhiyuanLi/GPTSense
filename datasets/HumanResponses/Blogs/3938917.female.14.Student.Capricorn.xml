       Updating my blog whoo...It's got to be the most boring blog in the world, which isn't a problem I guess because as of right now, I'm the only one who knows about it.&nbsp; It's just my way to keep track of what goes on in my life since I'm not too good at it.&nbsp; Haha, I'm ridiculous.&nbsp; Yesterday I got to see Tyler and play which made me very happy because one thing I'm sure of is that he's leaving for Canada tommorow...I'm such a sad girl.&nbsp; Oh well, he's supposed to be back the 11th so I have something to look forward to.&nbsp; It's so&nbsp;bad that he's the only thing I can ever thing to&nbsp;write about...it's become an obsession...but some obsessions&nbsp;you just can't avoid and I think hes definetly ok to be obsessed with.&nbsp; I saw Stacey yesterday too which was definetly a cool thing because she hasn't came around since December or so...but she took us to the mall and I got the new TBS cd...which is excellent for those of you who haven't heard it (it's so pathetic that I pretend I'm writing to people...lol) and I got RHPS and ATHF Vol. 1 and 2 on DVD so I'm set for a while.&nbsp; Then we went to DQ for some ice cream...yum.&nbsp; K-Woody called me last night and wants us to go to the Charleston fair today so I'm getting ready...to go get ready for that lol.&nbsp; It could be ok I guess, town fairs aren't too bad sometimes...but that's where I'll be today.&nbsp; As of tomorrow, and this weekend, and until the 11th, I'll wander about aimlessly trying to find something to do as I await the return of Tyler...and Lloyd...HAHA...ok, but as of now, I'm going to go get ready.&nbsp; Bye!

      Ok, so me and Damian went to Bub's house tonight cause that's where you go to "have a good time."&nbsp; Lol, or so Damian told me that before we left...it was his motive to go.&nbsp; Anyways, we got there and Andy and Tyler were there too so I watched Bub play his Gamecube for a while and then played with his snake which was really cool cause I like snakes :)&nbsp; But anyways, didn't really have time to play...and he's leaving for Canada for Friday which is sad...oh well, he'll have fun for sure.&nbsp; But anyways, that's about all that went on today on this busy Monday in July...whooo...and I'm watching Newsies and listening music and talking to people AND playing Sims on my other computer; I'm a multitasker.&nbsp; Well, I'm going now, maybe something interesting will happen soon that can take up more space to write about.

      Wow, I have the stupidest computer on the face of the earth.&nbsp; I haven't been able to get on since like...Thursday becase it's been down the whole time, causing me to be incredibly angry.&nbsp; Oh well, I'm on now and I guess that's all that matters...right?&nbsp; No, I guess things could be a lot better.&nbsp; Tyler says you can always be happier...but sometimes I think I couldn't be happier anywhere else on earth.&nbsp; For example, when I'm with him, we don't even have to be doing anything and I'm perfect.&nbsp; It's just my surroundings I guess.&nbsp; But anyways, Friday was kind of crazy.&nbsp; Brock had a band practice at his house and he left kinda early from it and everyone else just kind of happened to hang around afterwards.&nbsp; I didn't even realize Brock had left, but then&nbsp;Steve and Trena got home...and they weren't too happy that we were all there...without Brock.&nbsp; So we tried to explain that we didn't know Brock had even left but they didn't believe us.&nbsp; So we left, and Damian, Jesse, Fox, and I were on our way to Mike James' house and Steve called...apparently someone went into his bathroom and knocked over some jar that had his wedding ring on top of it and he couldn't find it.&nbsp; Well, we didn't know what had happened, so Damian finished his convo with him and hung up.&nbsp; He called later and Steve had found it...good deal, because the blame could have easily been pushed over onto any one of us, and that would have sucked.&nbsp; So anyways, we hung out at Mike's the rest of the night...it was kind of boring but what can you expect?&nbsp; Then, Saturday we all went to Kim's party thing that she had...which I thought was pretty boring too.&nbsp; Bitter Ending got to play and so did Jade's band whatever they're called, so it wasn't a total drag, but Jesse insisted we leave at 8 o'clock which again angered me.&nbsp; So many stupid little things can set me off, maybe I'm bipolar or something.&nbsp; Not sure, doesn't really matter I guess...I'm breathing and it gets me through.&nbsp; Anyways, when I got home I watched Labyrinth and then went&nbsp;to bed which brings us to today...Sunday.&nbsp; I slept until 1 p.m. because I was really tired, though I'm not sure why, it's not like I stayed up very late.&nbsp; When I did wake up though, the family was eating lunch...barbecue ribs and some kind of steak...ick...so I fixed some peanut butter and jelly and then came down and fiddled with the computer for&nbsp;a couple of hours before I finally got it working.&nbsp; I had to do a restore on it, and that made it kind of work...but anyways, I'm bored yet again, so I'm going to find something productive to do...hopefully.&nbsp; Until my next post, later dayz.

       So today's Thursday.&nbsp; I have had a wonderful 2 days.&nbsp; Yesterday, I went to Tyler's and played, which was a lot of fun.&nbsp; Then I went to my dad's house which isn't important, but that was basically my day.&nbsp; Then, today, me and Damian went to Brock's house for band practice and then to Ty's at around 7.&nbsp; Not really much to say about it, except it's been fun!!&nbsp; I like days like these.&nbsp; Tomorrow is Friday and Damian has to go back to work, so I'm going to have to find something to do...which could be hard, because there's not a whole lot around here.&nbsp; Oh well, I'll manage (hopefully).&nbsp; Well,&nbsp;this was quite a short post for such good days, but I don't have anything else to put, so I'm flyin!&nbsp; Laterz

      Today was ridiculous.&nbsp; Parents fought allll day, which angered me because I wanted Tyler to come over...grr...oh well, I complain way too much.&nbsp; But, when there's only one thing I ever want, and I can't get it on account of them, it angers me greatly.&nbsp; Oh well, I suppose I'm just a silly girl.&nbsp; But I miss him...and want him...and need him.&nbsp; I'll get to him somehow, for now I just have to cuddle with his shirt and call it good.&nbsp; But anyways, yesterday was filled with bore as usual.&nbsp; I hate it that everyone has a job and never can do anything, but I guess that's just part of life right?&nbsp; Right.&nbsp; Stupid Girl just came on,&nbsp;and I haven't heard this song for a really long time.&nbsp; Maybe it's a message to me that I'm a stupid girl...but don't they know that I'm already aware?&nbsp; Apparently not.&nbsp; But what can a girl expect?&nbsp; I don't know.&nbsp; Well, I don't really have anything to talk about since everything's been so boring...so I'll leave you with one final message...Goonies NEVER say die!&nbsp; Hehe!

      It's Sunday...the end of yet another boring weekend.&nbsp; I didn't post last night because my computer was being ridiculous, but it's ok...for now.&nbsp; But anyhow, my yesterday consisted of waking up at 9 am and going shopping in Champaign which was great.&nbsp; I got the coolest boots in the world...they're all Herman Munster style with like 3 inch platforms and buckles all the way up both sides...I did borrow them from him after all...we're pretty tight.&nbsp; I got a couple pair of sunglasses, a Texas Roadhouse&nbsp;T-shirt,&nbsp;and some pink capris too, but they're definetly&nbsp;not as fun.&nbsp; Today&nbsp;started out&nbsp;&nbsp;ok...then it got better...then it got worse...then it got better again, so I'm good.&nbsp;&nbsp;I went to Rieman's for a cookout thing, mainly to see Tyler...but everyone else was there too so it all worked out; except for the stupid girls.&nbsp; There were 3 or so girls there that I couldn't stand.&nbsp; They were the type that found a stupid way to get around the guys, but really it just made them look more retarted.&nbsp; Then they were doing a bunch of dumb stuff that they apparently thought made them seem cool...yea it didn't work.&nbsp; We got away from them after an hour or so though and went to ol' Brockies house for band practice...then came home.&nbsp; It could've been better, but I suppose it was good for what it was.&nbsp;&nbsp;I was just happy because I got to see Ty.&nbsp; I stole his shirt...haha, I'm such a thief, but it smells good...just like him, so I'm keeping it hehe.&nbsp; But for now, I'm gonna chat myself up good and tired on MSN.&nbsp; Night!!

       It's 8:40 and I'm awake, what's wrong with this picture?&nbsp; I stayed at Rachel's last night and she had to bring me home early for work...a logical explanation.&nbsp; Ugh...I woke up with a migraine, I could definetly tell when we would go through trees and the sunlight would shine back at us again when we entered a clear spot.&nbsp; It was horrible...flash flash flash, like someone repeatedly hitting me in the head with a hammer.&nbsp; Oh well, I took some medication, should be gone in a while.&nbsp; I'm incredibly bored though, those who I'd like to talk to are all in bed at this hour and conversations with myself are getting old.&nbsp; It's Friday, another weekend where I'll search for something ridiculous to do to pass away the hours.&nbsp; I think I might go with Rachel and Gabel tomorrow to get Gabel's tattoo, not sure...something more interesting might come up.&nbsp; Hopefully I'll get to see Ty sometime; hopefully.&nbsp; It all depends I suppose.&nbsp; Well, this was quite long for my first post...I still have a lot to figure out about this whole blog thing so it's going to be under construction for a while.&nbsp; Haha, that sounds silly...WARNING: Website under construction.&nbsp; lol ok,&nbsp;I'm going for now, might post tonight.&nbsp; Bye!

      -+-Rose tints my world, keeps me safe from my trouble and pain.  Well I couldn't stay away too long, it hasn't even been a week and I was getting blogger fever lol...is that gay or what?  Well Rachel definetly thought so, she's sitting right beside me repeating "blogger fever"  over and over and over...goo.  Well anyways it's Monday and I've spent the day with Rachel.  Not much has happened since I wrote last...we went to the movies Friday and saw AVP which was definetly good...predator won of course.  (and the sexy black chick) ok just kidding.  That night I heard some things about Tyler too and it made me mad so we went to Calebs for about 2 minutes and he was there and I just completely ignored him.  Then, the next morning I left to Belleville for the whole weekend to shop and my mom spent about 600$ on me which I definetly thought was good.  Then I came back and well...got chewed out by Tyler because apparently he was worried or something and the stuff I heard was false.  Oh well, nothing can be done about it now.  Then today as I said before was spent with Rachel, we got the cops called on us!  Haha, such rebellion, but it was for a stupid reason...just because we turned around in some people's driveway...apparently they didn't like it.  They'll get over it for sure.  But before that we roamed around in Casey desperately seeking something to do but it was to no avail.  So we came back to Greenup and picked up the ferret and chilled like polar bears, driving around town and such.  Then came home and ate doughnuts and pizza.  It was good times.  Now we've decided that we're going to make scrapbooks of just ourselves throughout this year.  That should be cool.  But for now I think I'm going to go, possibly chat some more, possibly go to bed because Rachel is gettin seepy...awww...haha.  Ok, then tomorrow we're going to get up early I guess and venture to Casey.  We'll see how that works out.  Until then, may your dreams and thought be filled with...me!!

       --He changes your mind when you see the joy in his eyes. It makes you feel. He draws your eye from all the things that have made you numb and makes you feel. If I could open up my heart and let him out I would never have to sing his name aloud. It was your "hello" that kept me hanging on every word and your "good-bye" that keeps me listening for your voice around each corner. I'll sing songs to help me stay up all night. I don't want to go to sleep. I'l sing songs and hope you're listening carefully and know exactly what I mean. It's the song you must seek out when your night has just began. In the distance you can find the lips from which was sung a melody.--      Not many Mondays of mine are very exciting, including this one. I pulled weeds for a couple of hours and planted a few trees...yard work whoo...and that's about all. Tomorrow Tyler's coming home, he should be back Wednesday...and I have to go to my step-grandma's funeral...yay. But then maybe I'll get to see him...hopefully, lol he got me some presents. But that's all that's went on...so I'm going to finish my talking and then go to bed...but first I'll leave you with some thoughts I wrote out earlier, lol it's kind of a short story...oh well.       **I walk hand-in-hand with life's uncertainty, wanting one thing one minute and something completely different the next. A fickle mind can easily get a girl in trouble, leading her into dangerous corners she's never entered before. But there's one thing that stay's constant; my need for you.      I'd truthfully rather be uncertain about you too, noting the sick, painful consequences of your actions. Wanting you is just a subtle way of asking for death. You've killed me before, and oh did you ever pull it off with grace; a style all your own. Just the thought makes me shake, and sure you hate to see me tremble, but it didn't stop you.       It's as if you feast on my heart, cold though it may be. So many things done to create the lifelessness inside, and yet it's always my fault. I wasn't made like a robot. Such a shame that I can't turn off my emotions with the click of a switch. Too bad, I'd make myself like stone, putting an end to the fear, anger, sorrow, hate, and even the love that got me there in the first place.      It generally starts with my glass dreams. Just fragile thoughts, uncertain at first, but once settled become essential. And with every start there's an end, so being the sudden shatter of the once beautiful needs that in all actuality aren't needed at all. They lead on to envy and jealousy, two of life's greatest enemies; predator's of the heart slowly consuming every bit of feeling you own, and if they're going to do it, I wish they'd get it over with so that I can dry my eyes and walk on, only to run into a new and more difficult scenario that will once more make me feel alive to only kill me again. Oh well, it's just a game I've not mastered yet; no one has.      It's not possible to become rich from Monopoly of the heart.

      +Urban Definition of the Day: Shasty. Pronounced: Shas-tee. Adjective describing things that are messed up or wrong. For example, "Sometimes, life is shasty," or, "That girls face is shasty!"     I never quite start my blog out right. It always ends up boring, so today I decided to put a crazy definition to spice things up a bit. Anyways, if I was a different person reading my blog, the first thing today I would want ao know would be there whereabouts of the small child also known as Fizzgig. So this is what happened with him since I last posted: at about 4 a.m. I finally got him to go to bed, so I went to bed too, alone...:(...sleeping so lightly because I was afraid he would come in my room and do something. Then apparently he woke up at around 6 a. m...yea, running on 2 hours of sleep, not something I would do but if he wants to, sure...why not? So he got up and watched TV for a while and sometime his grandpa brought out some medicine for him and notified the parentals that he was going out of town for the day, leaving him with us, so Mom and Jim took him shopping in Champaigne and then out to dinner at Red Lobster. He left with about 10 pair of shorts, 5 shirts, 2 pair of shoes, a hat, and some boxers. I'm beginning to think this retrieving tennis balls thing is a good idea...worked perfectly for him anyways. They returned home around 7 and he just did random things such as riding his bike and the scooter and swimming and finally he went home at about 8. Other than this, I can faitfully describe my day in one word: uneventful. I was left home alone, which doesn't bother me at all. It gave me some time to think about things, everything...but where'd it leave me? Nowhere really. Screw brains, they don't help anything. I actually spent time thinking of phrases I would learn if I went to a country that speaks a language other than English, but most of them are mean, so for the sake of my life in case a foreigner would just happen to come apon my site, I'll only post one of them. It came about when I was thinking of the trip to Mexico we took back in May or around then...one thing that sticks out in my mind is all of the male Mexicans hitting on me, no matter what age. So I thought of something I could reply to that, in any country with horny men lol. "Jo kashish hai, woh tho sirf andar ki dard chhupa raha hai," which translates to: "The magnetism you talk about is only hiding the pain inside." Sure it would turn a couple of heads and possibly confuse them, but it would stop them from throwing comments and proposals for a few minutes right? I surfed around on the net for a good many hours today just looking for something to occupy my time, and came across a site that told me what my name would be if I were a squirrel. "Arch Bishop McNutt"...lol, so for a small furry animal, I think being the leader of a province or something of equal power doesn't sound half bad! That's about all I found that sparked my interest on the net. I got offline at about 6 and spent a couple of hours playing Pacman, still unable to beat the level me and Tyler got stuck at that one morning...speaking of Tyler, I talked to him once today only for about 10 minutes, and the conversation consisted of a bet...which I lost...and a few nice thoughts. Well, that's all that's coming to mind tonight so I'm going to leave you with some lyrics and talk the night away on MSN...such a wonderful life...yea right...      Underoath-A Boy Brushed Red...Living in Black and White  Can you feel your heart beat racing? Can you taste the fear in her sweat?  You've done this wrong  It's too far gone  These sheets tell of regret   I admit that I'm just a fool for you   I'm just a fool for you.   Here is where we both go wrong  Tonight's your last chance to do exactly what you want to do And this could be my night this is what makes me feel alive Makes you feel alive  Here is where we both go wrong  So tie me up and toss this key cause for now we're living   In this momment that we both ignore the truth It's all over It's all over I feel your heart against mine So take a breath and close your eyes  Your lungs have failed and they've both stopped breathing  My heart is dead, it's way past beating    Something has gone terribly wrong   I'm scared you're scared, we're scared of this  I never thought we'd make it out alive I never told you, but it's all in your goodbyes It's all in your goodbyes  Well look who's dying now, slit wristless, sleeping with the girl next door I always knew you were such a sucker for that It doesn't matter what you say You never mattered anyway You never mattered anyway  In this momment that we both ignore the truth It's all over It's all over I feel your heart against mine So take a breath and close your eyes  Your lungs have failed and they've both stopped breathing  My heart is dead, it's way past beating   Something has gone terribly wrong   I'm scared you're scared, we're scared of this  I never thought we'd make it out alive I never told you, but it's all in your goodbyes it's all in your goodbyes   Don't shake, I hate to see you tremble  trembling You've lost your touch haven't you?  And I'm so addicted   so addicted.   Your lungs have failed and they've both stopped breathing  My heart is dead, it's way past beating   Something has gone terribly wrong   Your lungs have failed and they've both stopped breathing  My heart is dead, it's way past beating    Something has gone terribly wrong   I'm scared you're scared, we're scared of this  I never thought we'd make it out alive I never told you, but it's all in your goodbyes It's all in your goodbyes  I never thought we'd make it out alive I never thought we'd make it out alive I never thought we'd make it out alive It's all in your goodbyes

      +Very very rarely, I feel love. But when I feel it, I feel it like a hurricane.  Well the last time I blogged was Thursday and it's Sunday morning...a lot has occured since then. I've just been slacking lol. I don't remember it all of course, so I'm going to kind of summarize it. It's been crazy up and down with me and Tyler, and our status now? I have no clue. I talked to him a little tonight, and it was happy talking...but that still doesn't make me understand anything any better. He knows what I want...who doesn't? Don't know if I'll get it though. Suppose only time can tell. Some crazy things happened today though. At around 4 or so my mom and step-dad went to play tennis...nothing out of the ordinary...but then we stopped by my Grandma's house on our way to Casey and there was a strange child in her living room, just watching TV. It confused me, so of course I asked. Apparently he was fetching their tennis balls for them when they were playing, so they took him to DQ for some ice cream and then went to my grandma's to hang out for a while. That was kind of strange but then I didn't think anything of it. So, anyways we left and went to Caleb's house where we watched a bit of Fern Gully and then played tag with the hacky sack...yea I don't recommend it. I got pegged in the face, back, and leg by Rieman and once in the arm by Caleb...I get the feeling tomorrow I'll wake up with some bruises. Anyways, we left Caleb's after about an hour and went to Bub's house, where Caleb worked on his bike for about 5 minutes and then Bub showed up and so we chilled in the garage for a while before going over to the tennis court across the road. After hanging out there and the boys getting hit on by some nasty girls, we got kicked out by some adults I assumed to be the owners. Oh well, so we went back and chilled in his garage a little more then came home. This is the new picture, its about 11 o'clock...I walk in the door...my step-dad's asleep in a chair and my mom on the couch, nothing new. So I look in the other chair...and there he is. That same boy, I'm beginning to think we've adopted him lol. No, just kidding. So anyways it leads me here to about 3 a.m...and he's about 20 feet behind me settled on the couch watching cartoons...AWAKE...small children aren't supposed to be awake at such hours, but what am I to do but cater his every service. I've been bringing him pop tarts and soda and anything else he needs. I feel like a mom...hope I get payed for this...oh well. But that's about all that's happened.  + Pick up your China Doll    Pick up your China Doll  It's only fractured, Just a little nervous from the fall. –Grateful Dead, China Doll   --*I've been watching your world from afar,

       Wow. The last couple of days have been confusing to say the least. Monday, I don't remember doing much of anything but worrying about what Tyler was supposed to tell me. And what was it? I found out Tuesday it was that Tyler had cheated on me before he left for Canada...yea...definetly not something that made me all smiles. It was more of all tears. So that happened, but we've talked since then...and this is where it gets even more confusing. By Wednesday night we were pretty much fine, we'd talked about 3 hours, though he was drunk...which was scaring me because I didn't want him to pass out...at all...but now it's Thursday morning at about 4 o'clock. We talked about an hour ago, and the crazy "l word" was pulled out...by him...for the first time. Yea, weird time for it huh? That's what I was thinking. Oh well, I'm still pretty lost about it all. I guess only time will tell. But for now I'm going to try to sleep...because he got offline a bit ago...kicked off I'm hoping. Left without good-bye..and yea he was crazy drunk again. I guess I'll find out soon enough...good night!

      Well today started out okay I guess, then I talked to Followell and it totally screwed things up...just because I'm a dumb girl. Otherwise I probably wouldn't have worried about it. Anyways he got online and the first thing he said was, "Have you talked to Tyler lately?" I hadn't since Thursday so of course I said no and then he said somethin about he was just wondering if he'd told me anything...which really got me angry because then he wouldn't tell me what Tyler's supposed to tell me or whatever, only that it's nothing I should worry about, but how do I not worry?? I don't know...it's so confusing and its made me crazy all day and so now I really need to talk to someone who knows...it's probably something tiny that he was just trying to make me worry about when really it's nothing to worry about at all...oh well, I guess I'll find out soon enough. -Nothing hurts my world, just affects the ones around me...  *My wrists hurt. They hurt bad; bad enough to make to make me forget about the blood that randomly drips down my head. I'm dirty and soaked with sweat, but it's a different kind of sweat. The kind that comes straight from your adrenal glands and makes you shake. Rope burn has eaten away the skin on my wrists and the sweat that slowly rolls down my arms reminds me that my nerves are frayed, but good enough to prioritize pain. How... how did I end up here?  I shift around in the chair nearly tipping over. I have no idea how you got me in this chair. It must have been during one of my classic blackouts; the kind that start on Monday and last for a days at a time. I challenge you to find a quicker way to the weekend.  I can't even remember how this drag race into a brick wall started. Christ I feel like roadkill. I assume I’ve done something wrong that you would have me in this chair tied up and padlocked?! For the love of God, padlocked? I don’t even know anymore; the blackouts are my carte blanche. This is all your fault anyway. You should know better. Moving into my place, bringing along a truck full of baggage in just two suitcases. I should have known better.  Nothing worse than throwing the two of us together. Nothing worse than you. I’d rather be doing shots of brake fluid than having to deal another day with you. Yet somehow, I have a feeling I’m going to get my wish; sans brake fluid. And there it is, right against the back of my head. The .45 I kept under the bed by the magazines and an empty bottle of Jim Beam. Not that I tried to hide it very well.  ”You never loved me.”  I let out a pretty good scream when you pistol whipped me on the head, but the real pain came when you circled around and followed up with a hit to the right side of my face. I thought my head was imploding, but no, just my teeth splintering and my jaw fracturing. That’s all.  I’m leaned over and I can faithfully say that this is the most pain I’ve ever been in. And now here I am at the quintessential point of existence, the end of it. You’re crying and shouting something at me. I’d like to tell you I’ll miss you, but lying isn’t the way I should go. I’ll miss this kitchen I’m about to cover, the burn that Jimmy B leaves as he cascades down my throat, hey I might even miss the thrill of the chase that got me here, but the shovel that dug me deeper can go back in the shed with the rest of the tools.  I'd like to go out with a line, give you a wink, a sneer, but I can't even breathe and you don't play with your food. You pull the trigger; a deafening pop and the silence of darkness.  From the silent depths of darkness, it comes back crushingly heavy and without warning; an ocean of conciousness drops on you and the sound is deafening. Black subsides to white and slowly you come to a hazy light in this room of your own design. Disoriented at best; the sweat, the blood, the fear and pain all fighting to register at the same time in your cranium. Your chest rattles as you try to breathe from the periodic bouts of crying and pain, the little you remember.  The crulest tricks are the happy endings your mind tries to write from the failures you have created. All you can do is wait to wake up. One thing stands out in this vertiginous shift in reality: The cold, round shape firmly pressed against your head. Your entire life balanced between your temple and the hammer of my .45. Cutting through the static in your ear drums, my parting love in a shouted whisper:  "Just remember baby, I'm fatally yours..."

      I've not blogged for a while because I've been at my dad's house all weekend, but I'm here now.  Ok, in the time thats passed...hmm...Thursday I ended up getting to see Tyler anyways because the fair got boring and so we went to Caleb's house and voila...there he is.  Then the rest of my weekend has sucked.  I'm just a pathetic little girl that misses my beautiful boy; I haven't even talked to him since Thursday night.  Oh man, how am I ever going to make it the next 10 days without him?  I have no clue...well leaving that subject this is what went down this weekend: Friday: After Damian got off work, we went to see The Village.  It sucked terribly and was nothing close to what I had in mind it would be like.  After that, we went back to my dads house and chilled by ourselves because Dad was out playing cards and Vicki was in the hospital with her mom. Saturday: Damian and I went to El Rancherito with Dad and Vicki and Holly and the kids and then left and chilled at various sites until 11.  Got back to dads house and got online until about 1 because he was yelling for me to get offline, so I did and went to bed. Sunday: Woke up at about 1:30 and did nothing all day.  At around 5:30 Damian and I came back to moms house where I currently reside...waiting... and that was my weekend...I know, I know, I need a life.  Oh well, I'm now going to go and wait...and wait a little more in hopes that I get to talk to Ty...dang I bring him up to much.  It's kinda creepy isn't it?
