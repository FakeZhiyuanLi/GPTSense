       Hey, it's Sean,     I just, uh, decided that to start of a blog with comedic roots, it would be cool if I mentioned a few.  Mitch Hedberg is the world's greatest comedian, and I'm not even joking.  If you don't know him*, you should get to know him.  I'm not going to go on much more about him because I can tell by the look on your face that blah blah blah here's a quote;  "I have a feeling that a duck's opinion of me is strongly influenced by whether or not I have bread."  -Mitch  Until next time, Sean  * "How many of you people know me?  Well, if you don't know me why are you coming to my special?"

       Sean.......aaaagain.   Rosie O'Donnell is a useless, ignorant, fat, useless, fat, ignorant, fat, useless, ignorant fat ass, with no use. She shouldn't be paid for anything she does, ever. Lucifer has a special seat to his right waiting for her, crafted with thousands of souls (and we're still not sure if she'll fit). The only thing bigger than Rosie is her big, useless ego. She's a stupid lesbian who's ruining the world with her fat cries for attention. If I owned a tabloid, I'd publish "Rosie O'Donnell does something else while looking fat and hideous and STILL no one cares." Where are those crazed gunmen I'm always hearing about? You guys should get off your asses, there's work to be done. Let's not remove the blame from our unamiable target. She's a fat ass. She's useless. No one likes her. Cry Rosie, cry prz! God bless her 'children' for being around knives and ropes and still being alive today. Fatty. Rosie O'Donnell does not deserve to have rights! GRR!

       Sean, yet again.  I heard about this new game Manhunt for PS2, and well every system I guess...It looks really really awesome, needless violence  and  somewhat deep gameplay.  I haven't played video games in a  looooong  time, but this is definately worth my time...I think.  Anyways, check it out at  urlLink Rockstar Games .  The Manhunt site drove me nuts, but I finished it!  On a completely unrelated note, I found this Personality Disorder test and it seems to be decent, although I'm basing that on the fact that there are no "did you ever poop your pants when you were little" type questions.   urlLink Here's the test  if you wanna take it, and here are my results...I don't suggest believing these results at all, I mean, what are shrinks for if this 'amazing' test could tell me what I am.

       Sean, again.  Hope Dain's having an awesome trip :D.  I would just like to shoot down that stupid "Test the Nation" show. The 'on the spot' questions with contestants are more fake than wrestling, and worse acting than 'orno. I answered every question within like, the first couple seconds, and I used the rest of the time to think about how stupid Americans are, sitting at home crappin' themselves over the right answer. I've taken real I.Q. tests, the kind you pay money for, the real kind, and some people portray the show as if it were a 'real I.Q. test'. It's not, it's just not. Don't be gay, don't watch the show, unless you feel like barfing all over your TV.   Dissapointed in the human race,  Sean

       'Tis Sean here.  A quick thought on the Careers/Civics course.   Civics  = important, depending on your future  career , which you don't need an  ENTIRE  half a semester to stress over.  Remember those people, down in the office?  The ones who you can make appointments with to help direct your future?  Yes people, they still exist, and trust me, they're helpful.  Careers, however, is a load of hooey.  We watched a movie in "careers" about the top ten jobs, I'm soooo glad we did!  If it wasn't for that movie I would be completely oblivious to the world of  Sand Sculpting , and lets not forget  Food Critic !  What would we do without amazing educational videos like that?  With 90% of the cource being common knowledge, the boredom sets in.  This class must have dropped my I.Q. by like a trillion [ joke, I'm not stupid ].  Oh, lets not forget our E.Q.!  'Cause your future doesn't depend on a silly thing like math, no no, it depends on your Emotional Quotient.  The only think that class is good for is reminding smart kids they are smart, and giving leaving dumb kids open to ridicule.  This class is easy, unless of course your teacher is a gym teacher.  Sure, he is a wicked guy, I bet he's very smart too, but why can't you just let the guy teach gym?  I complain about careers SO much that the teacher is just failing me on purpose by now, an excellent opportunity for me to grab some evidence that I'm wasting my time in this class, I bet my mom would love to see a teacher who is ACTUALLY doing their job wrong.  For once, the 'dumb 15-year-old' is right.  To quote Rob, "Careers should be optional, and civics should be a full course, and you should have a choice, too."  Of course I cleared up some grammar :P but he has a sweet-ass point.  Good luck getting through the course, try to ignore the inevitable anhedonia you will soon be fond of.  OMG CIAO LOLZ!!!!111, Sean

       Sean here.  If you are easily offended, don't read this...  assuming you can read...    The majority of rap artists  these days don't make their own music.  Now, lets just say, hypothetically, that the music industry was about  music , they wouldn't have jobs, n'est pas? So, really, what are these guys getting paid for?  Oh yeah, they can rhyme.  You see, back when I was in  kindergarten  I also learned how to rhyme.  Why am  I  not making millions? I must have used proper grammar or real words, or maybe it's because I did not mention my 'gat' enough. So in pseudo-conclusion, they are getting payed to flash their bling, and shake their tail feathers.  What the hell?!  Millions of people work hard, get educations, get jobs that help today's work force, and by the time they die they will not have made a third of what these  artists  are making.  Problem number 1:  Rap artists + Money = More Rap Artists  You see, a rap artist can coast his way through life.  After making billions, his brother says, "Yo, G, can you loan me a record deal or two, bro?"  Problem number 2:  This means the more rap artists we have now, the more dumbass rap artists we will have in the future.  I call it the  Parabola of Brothas  effect.  y = x^2  .'. Sean goes on a rampage and destroys the earth. And because it's in popular culture, kids will eat out of these turds' hands.  Problem number 3:  The future, a generation of illiterate gang members.  If you're not in a gang, ask yourself this, how many people do you know who are in gangs?  Now how many of them can spell "intelligence", "employment", or "literacy"?  Exactly. The only problem is, anyone who complains will get a 'cap' in their ass.   Thank god for skaters.   Don't get me wrong I'm not super pro-punk, but they are the positive to the Thug negative.  I'd like to see a huge gangs vs. skater war, no guns, unless you're a big pussy.  Jackass rap dildos.  Grr.  "Payce" [ GRR! ], Sean

       Sean here.  For  les record , let's call it  80's DEVO!  Ahhh.  Alright, we need less fat dumbass thugs, and less suicidal goths making the world so serious.  Be a kid!  Be whoever the hell you want!  We need the 80's!  Screw the 70's, no one wants hippies, and screw the future, who wants neo-techno-hydraulic-pneumatic pancakes?  I want pancakes with ripped jeans, and self esteem through the roof!  Lets synthesize our ways into equality people!  (Except for the gays.)  We need an   80's DEVO  , and we need it now!  If you see the world as an awesome place, you're trying too hard; we have to make the world a place first!  This won't happen without you people.  Screw world vision, all Africa needs is more lasers!  Lasers and synthesizers.  Alright, take all your money that you're giving to dying kids in Africa, the freezing in Antartica, the homeless in Toronto, the paralyzed, the handicapped, the deaf, the blind, the impotent, the foreign, the obese, take all that money, and send it to ME!  A vote for  devo  isn't a vote for progress!  Let's make the world how it was before a gun was a gat, and it was cool to strut and hold your groin while abusing countless substances!  That's stupid, you don't need that!  Come on!  Let's go!  WTF ARE U WAitING 4?!!!1  LOLZ!!11 ROFLMAO WATTTTT!!!!  LET'S GO GO GO,   DEEEEEEEEEEEEEVOOOOOOOOOOOO .

       Sean.  Again.  Because Dain isn't posting.  So I have to post  all the time .  Heheh.  Okay, so I had this crazy dream where I was black, and Eddie Murphy lived on my street.  He only wore a yellow jacket and grey pants every day (yes, the dream was so long there were 'days').  Anyways, I kept going down the street every 'day' and breaking down Eddie Murphy's door, and then he would greet me and hand me a new Celine Dion (or someone like that) CD that he burned for me.  I did this a bunch of times until eventually, I became a black  woman .  Weird.  So I went down to Eddie's house as a woman, and this time my friend Andrew was with me.  I broke down the door as usual and Eddie got really mad, I think he didn't recognize me now that I was female. He pulled out an automatic something, like an Uzi, and started spraying bullets everywhere, and then Andrew disappeared.  I ran back up the street and went home and as soon as I stepped in the door I was me again, and Eddie Murphy was making out with the black chick that  I was  a couple minutes ago, and it wasn't me anymore.  I looked in the mirror and I was kind of shocked, that's when I woke up. I then had another dream with James celebrating a certain day, that day being today, but I'm hungry and I'm gonna go eat so I won't get into details.  G'day!

       Hey, it's Sean.  A quick thought on the show Cops;  isn't it aaaaawesome?  ^_^ Don't get me wrong, I dislike *, but so do the cops on the show, and if you can't see that you're missing the point of filming the great duty of busting *.  I've seen  Bowling for Columbine  and yes, there is too much violence on TV, but pinning a guy down and sending him to jail, and then listening to a cop explain the technical components of his lunch break is insignificant when compared to the exploding heads in Dawn of the Dead, or something along those lines.   Which reminds me, Maddox is a doodie sometimes.   Anyways I'm watching Cops right now, and a squad car just got a flat tire  on  some train tracks.  Why were they there?  Some nut job dirt biker was shooting down the tracks.  What could make this better?  A train's coming.  So these cops are wiggin' out trying to get it off the tracks, and then the train takes a left on these other tracks; the train's original route.  Funny?  It happens twice in a row.  Could this be better?  Nope, the cop who got his car stuck has a lisp.  I agree, Charlton Heston is a dink, but I think Cops is one of the greatest low-budget shows out there.   * Drug dealers, 'thugs', addicts, criminals, anyone over 200 lbs., anyone with an I.Q. under 100, any man with a tattoo anywhere below the belt, anyone with over 20 piercings, those 'goths' with black nails and clothes, 'thugs', anyone who has bling, anyone over the age of 30 missing 2+ teeth, and anyone who loved Hellboy, 'thugs', idiots who stand in circles free styling, and Brad Taylor, the world's largest animate boulder.

       Before I write this post, which I assume will be long, I'd like to thank [insert god] for helping make this video, and get it to a theatre near me. For those of you who didn't recognize the title of this post, I'm talking about Jim Carrey's new movie  Eternal Sunshine .  I'll start by rating it.  4 trillion trillion trillion TRILLION stars / 5.  It is truly the work of geniuses, namely;  Charlie Kaufman  - Writer/Producer of  'Confessions of a Dangerous Mind', 'Adaptation', and 'Human Nature'.   The guy is 130% genius.  Michel Gondry  - Writer/Director of  'The Science of Sleep' and 'One Day...'.   Awesome guy.  Pierre Bismuth  - Helped out with  'I've Been Twelve Forever' , which all three men worked on...   My crappy synopsis:  Lacuna Inc. has this technology that erases bad memories, and all it really takes is one night of being hooked up to a machine where they track down the memories in your brain and erase them one by one.  Joel Barish (Jim Carrey) is an astoundingly complex introverted character, kinda shy, kinda funny.  He meets Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslet) in Montauk (sp?) and they kinda flirt, even though she's a nut.  "Why does he fall in love with every girl that shows him the least bit of attention?"  Anyways, they go out, and get in fights because Clem is a h00r, so Clem erases Joel from her memory.  Joel accidentally finds out and gets pissed, so he erases goes to Lacuna to erase her from  his  memory.  Still with me?  The majority of the movie is after all this; it takes place in Joel's mind where it goes back memory by memory, erasing Clem step by step from his mind, and the whole time Joel is living out his mind, watching the memories get erased.  As they are being erased, Joel realizes that he really loves Clem, and changes his mind about wanting her erased.  Twist?  He can't get out; he's hooked up to this crazy contraption all night and can't escape (or can he?).  So in his mind, he tries to avoid the Lacuna workers and protect his memories of Clem by burying her deeper and deeper in his memories, and they travel all the way to his childhood and back.  That's about all I can say without spoilers, all though I'm sure that wasn't exactly spoiler-free.  The movie is so good.  When we walked out of the dark theatre back into the hall, Ryan kinda looked shocked, and I sure as hell was.  I don't think we were capable of mentally classifying what we just watched, we just knew it kicked ass (Ashworth and Spence seemed a bit too confuzzled...).  The movie flicks back and forth between scenes quickly sometimes, so confusion is understandable, but when the rush dies down a bit the scenes blend a lot more, and there's definitely a visual flow that goes with it.   If you haven't seen the movie yet, go see it before you read the following.   I love how they do things like the store blending into the apartment room, and the barbed-wire type fence in his room to switch from one scene to another closely related scene, it's pure genius.  One of my favorite scenes overall is the Kitchen scene (in his mind).  It's so complex because Clem is acting 'normal', trying not to be noticed, but  really , that is Joel, because she is just composed of his memories.  I find it amazing how his childhood memories lull him into repeating actions like getting the cookie and reaching for ice cream, yet his mind manages to recreate Clem's character on a completely different train of thought, all entirely possible and the multitasking type stuff like that is just cool.  It's like a form abstraction; you can see something from a couple viewpoints at a time.  If something like that were pulled off in any other movie, you wouldn't feel the characters' emotions at all, that's one of this movie's strongest features.  The funniest scene would definitely have to be the childhood memory of the bullies, the one with the hammer and he's wearing a cape and stuff.  It was refreshing to see Joel's character played by a boy for a second, and after it switches back to him wearing the cape and he tries to fight the kid, he remembers the guy as a bully so he is still tossed down, even though he's like thrice his size.  It's done so well, and I can't picture watching it being filmed on set without pissing myself.  I also love the scene in town where his memories get mixed up, if I remember correctly it's about the first time you hear the Lacuna workers, Patrick and Stan, talk and their voice is subliminally heard and Joel hears it blasted throughout the streets of his mind.  Crazy concepts in this movie, I'd like to see anyone who owns a gat wrap their mind around it, or any comic book loving 4 year-old try to sit through it without reading his latest issue of Inquest.   I love this movie.

        Sean here.  I was MUDding it up when I came across this girl who had this joke, and it's really funny.  Maybe not, maybe I'm just really tired and I'll laugh at anything.  Either way, this man is a genius:   If you don't know the difference between exothermic and endothermic, stop reading now.  The following was a question given on a University of Washington chemistry mid-term exam paper: "Is Hell exothermic , or endothermic? Support your answer with proof."  Most of the students wrote proofs of their beliefs using Boyle's Law (gas cools off when it expands and heats up when it is compressed) or some variant thereof.  One student, however, wrote the following:  First, we need to know how the mass of Hell is changing in time.  So, we need to know the rate at which souls are moving into Hell and the rate at which they are leaving. I think that we can safely assume that once a soul gets to Hell, it will not leave. Therefore, no souls are leaving.  As for how many souls are entering Hell, let's look at the different religions that exist in the world today. Some of these religions state that if you are not a member of their religion, you will go to Hell. Since, there are more than one of these religions, and since people do not belong to more than one religion, we can project that all people and all souls go to Hell.  With birth and death rates as they are, we can expect the number of souls in Hell to increase exponentially. Now, we look at the rate of change of the volume in Hell, because Boyle's Law states that in order for the temperature and pressure in Hell to stay the same, the volume of Hell has to expand as souls are added. This gives two possibilities:  If Hell is expanding at a slower rate than the rate at which souls enter Hell, then the temperature and pressure in Hell will increase until all Hell breaks loose. Of course, if Hell is expanding at a rate faster than the increase of souls in Hell, then the temperature and pressure will drop until Hell freezes over.  So which is it?  If we accept the postulate given to me by Ms. Krissy Jones during my Freshman year that "it will be a cold night in Hell before I sleep with you" and take into account the fact that I still have not succeeded in having sexual relations with her, then (2) cannot be true, and thus I am sure that Hell is exothermic.   I'd give my life to come up with stuff like that.  Sir, I salute you!

If you're going to be educating future workers of society, you have to do a damn good job. For any of you incredibly smart teachers designing the curriculum, I'll put it this way. Managing Time == Good Cramming Work != Good WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU!? HOW DO I READ A BOOK WHILE PRACTICALLY WRITING ONE?! HOW DO I PRESENT THE DAY AFTER I'M ASSIGNED A PRESENTATION?! HOW DO I STUDY FOR 3 EXAMS, WITH 4 UNITS IN EACH?! HOW DO I DO ALL THAT WHILE MAKING AN ART PROJECT ON HOW WRONG EDUCATION IS HANDLED?! HUH!?! H U H!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?! I HATE YOU!!!!!!  Ahhh. All better. Teachers, get smart you fucking idiots, if you're going to teach us do it right. If anything, the last couple weeks of school should be EMPTY so we can just study in order to pass! YOU IDIOTS! YOU STUPID GODDAMN IDIOTS YOU ARE SO STUPID I WANT TO SHOVE SALAD IN YOUR EYES AND SHAVE YOUR HEADS. UGH! I want to do good, but I just can't decide what to do good on first! I'll put my 10 pieces of work due into a hat, and I'll draw maybe 4, and do those. Joking. I will get it done. You'll see. I'll do it for all the slackers out there.

       "So what's in the book?" If you watch the movie and ask that question, thinking it will pull the plot together on your head, I think you need a new approach to it. Let me start over.  Clutch  is a good movie. Somewhat indie, Canadian, 1998, Tom Green (not-so-good) cameo, makes you tick. It's a dark comedy in the greatest sense of the term, well...A good sense of the term. The only thing in the movie that unfolds to be crazier than the plot itself are the characters in it. The writer/director Chris Grismer seems to be kind of an amateur, very talented, obscure kind of guy, at least to the extent that he projects himself in the movie...I mean, I thought at times my sense of humor was morbid, but I'd  never  be able to pull it off like he did in the movie. I'm gonna go ahead and use the line  if you haven't seen the movie, go rent it before you read the rest of this . Actually, I don't want to review it, I'm not good enough to put it into words, so let me rephrase that to  go rent the movie , and I hope you'll like it.  That's it for Clutch...Other than that, this has been a decent fake holiday weekend. I think my dog has done more for Canada by fertilizing grass than the Queen has in her whole life (all what, six-hundred and thirty years?). Yes, that is something to be proud of Queen Victoria, you were born...But wait! I was born too! We all were! Well most of us. Yes, the Queen is about as useful as all the bullcrap traditions that take place in Canadian government. Useless. Wanna cut back taxes? Use some tax money to buy a noose for the Queen and all other 'royalty'. Where do they get money for diamonds, nice dresses, and being the only people in that entire area with good teeth? I don't remember seeing the Queen flipping burgers when she was young. I suddenly understand why other countries, ie USA, make fun of Canada. We're faggots! Okay, so Canada isn't that bad, but the overseas government and everything ever related to it is incredibly stupid, and should die. The end. No more Queen.  Goodnight!  Sean

       Nananananananana-Sean hereeeee.  Feminists suck.  How would good ol' Rob put it?  Check out his thoughts here:  urlLink Rob's thoughts on feminism.  I think this may be one pivotal issue where Rob has a more conservative stand than I do. It's great through, read it...Just ignore the irony of him spelling 'neanderthal' wrong, among other words, he just didn't spell check. :P As for my thoughts?  Right here:  Feminism is competing for the top of the list of stupid causes for the  underemployed . People, you're losing your edge. Women don't have rights? Here's a right for you: shut up about being underpaid and all this incredibly bullshitty bullshit! My Mom works, she gets paid just as much as anyone else there. It doesn't even have anything to do with equal pay anymore, it's unemployed activist ugly fat women who can't shut up and be happy!   If you weigh 300 pounds don't complain that there is pressure on female appearance, be an  activist  and get off the goddamn couch! Feminism is an excuse for being ugly and lazy.  So, in order to clear up the jargon the dikes use, I'll write a quick  3-point feminism translation guide . It's all you need to know.  "We're underpaid." == "Give us money, we're lazy." "Women in the workplace." == "We don't want anyone to be more successful than us." "Too much pressure on female appearance." == "I'm ugly/fat/disfigured."  Gay pride, feminism, racism, sexism, and all other 'causes' don't need to be paraded, they need to be held up in a court of law! If someone punches you because you're black, good for you, sue their asses off and play the racism card! If someone punches you because you're white, good for you, sue their asses off and play the racism card! Yes, racism and all this stuff exist, and they're wrong, but they need to be dealt with by a man (or   woman  ) in a court of law, not some ugly fat woman with a shaved head waddling down the street holding a sign, a sign she had to get her son to write because she never went to school, she was too busy being paid for doing  shit , just complaining all day.  Damn you! Love, Sean

You also agree that the person who wrote this is in no way responsible for anything you do.     If you're going to slit your wrists, how about instead of talking about it you  finish the job ?

Nevermind, keep the ugliness, just GO, or in the words of my outspoken, unnamed internet buddy, GTFO! I'll  pay  you to die. PLEASE. JUST GTFO, I DON'T WANT YOU HERE ANYMORE. LEAAAVE. Jackasses, get a friggin' I.Q.. Here's some truth to cry about; no one loves you. That's why you're a Goth in the first place right? Same with 'hardcore anarchists'. Anarchy, as far as I know, comes from the French  laissez-faire , which means 'let it be'. I'm pretty sure it was a pseudo-neutral political party. Anarchy doesn't mean rebel, it means leave shit alone! Quite the opposite if you ask me.     A new guy at school, I think his name is brain-dead moron, once said to me, "You know, total anarchy can't exist because there will always be one organization to take down all the others." Hey, dildo, do you know what anarchy means? No? Eat my rubber. You know the evolution of the human race is slowed every day by people like you? No? Eat my plastic. I actually think I'd prefer looking at feces over looking at an 'anarchist' because that way I don't have to brace myself for inane remarks. Everyone on earth exists because there is some agreement between the people that live on earth.  If you don't agree, then don't live. It's that simple.     In conclusion, the more you brag about being an anarchist or a Goth or a shit head, the more you deserve to be shot, and when I become president of the world, you will see just how right I am. Want to have a cause? Want to be against a cause? NO! NO NO NO! Maddox put it best in the heading 'Looking for a safe stance on abortion? Me neither', and I'd say it's safe to replace 'abortion' with anarchy, atheism (or religion in general), feminism, or any other stupid cause that these inbreds can come up with. I'm starting a cause. It's called   logicism  . Get smart or GTFO. I urge you to be  logicist , too. You know why I can force people to join my cause? Because technically the people who aren't  logicist  are stupid, and I'm right. Do you want to be stupid? Then don't join my cause. If you are smart, feel free to call yourself  logicist , and go enforce your extremely correct opinions on others, and keep working at it until one day you're almost as right as I am.  Love, Sean

       Alright, Sean here, thanks to Evan I'm now officially a cantaloupe. You see, Evan and I were at the local coffee shop sipping our cappucinos when a guy wearing a scarf rollerbladed by and quickly said, "If you glue your balls to the carpet you turn into a cantaloupe!"  So I did.  Evan and I discussed which type of glue would work best, and I decided on rubber cement.  I quickly rubber cemented my genitalia to the carpet and BAM! I was a cantaloupe.  Just like that.  It was crazy!  Now that I'm a cantaloupe I have so many career choices...like...Cantaloupe!  Yeah!  That's what I'll do!  I'll be a cantaloupe, and I'll be a cantaloupe.  Think of how much money I'll make...I can't wait.  Thanks evan, I owe you a  brass monkey .

       Sean posting. Oh Jehovah, you really know how to push my buttons. Imagine you're about 3 years old and you're playing in a park, when suddenly this fat kid comes over and throws sand in your eyes.  Alright, now let's say the fat kid's name was Jehovah, and replace the sand with witnesses.  A couple weeks back some  j-ho's  came to my door.  Two young men fully dressed in ties, suits, and fancy black shoes.  There's one thing they forgot to wear: an I.Q..  I quickly said, "Oh, you're not Jehovah's witnesses are you?!"  They barely responded, just kind of walked away.  Score one for not enforcing religion!  Now today, on this wonderful Mothers' Day, big fat Jehovah decided to send  two  very attractive female  pornstars  witnesses to my house.  Radical!  How do you tell a pornstar to get the hell away from your house without going impotent?  It went something like this:  Pornstars:   "Hello, we're doing a something something for  better living ."  Me:             "Better living?  It says Watchtower, so aren't you Jehovah's witnesses?"  Pornstars:   "Well yes but..."  Me:             "I'm pretty busy right now actually."  Pornstars:   "Oh, well then let us give you this handy dandy guide to our cult, so that instead of spending Mothers' Day with your Mom, you can sit alone in your room and read it.  Everyone's doing it, it's all the rage, homeboy."  Me:             "I am  actually  going to kill you."  Pornstars:   "Eat my shit, clear thinking child!" We then began to throw fecal matter at each other but Jehovah's witnesses are incapable of anything other than looking stupid, so imagine if you will two ladies in suits on my front lawn trying to pick up feces with their wrists, while yelling, "Ahhh me so stupid can't get poopie throw at boy."    Okay  , so it didn't go exactly like that.  Use your imagination, people, you get the point though.  I can't make Jehovah's witnesses look any stupider than they already are.  So, in conclusion, next time you see one scream, "Eat my crap, you pornstars from hell!"  Then throw some poop at them even if they don't immediately react, trust me they know what you're talking about, they'll get it.  Hugs not drugs, Sean

       Sean, again.  So soon? So soon.  Angelfire was cool, they hosted our images, and our images were cool.  In a matter of seconds Angelfire went from cool to tool, and we don't have images anymore.  Down with Angelfire.com!!!  Poop.

       I've had too much sugar in the last 30 minutes.  Like, too much. I'm watching a Cops marathon. I just wanted to clarify the rules of being a cop, aka the rules of being awesome: 1.  Whenever you enter a room traveling above walking speed, you must hold an object (preferably a firearm) at a potent 90° 'strong-arm' angle, and scream, "Get on the ground!" or, "Put your hands above your head!" at least once, and it has to be at least 4.6 dB (decibels) louder than your normal voice. 2.  Anytime you witness an awry or corrupt occurrence you  must  intervene by means of physical, verbal, or mental force, but don't waste your time trying to shoot mind rays, only I can do that.  Trust me, I'm awesome. 3.  If someone is really stupid, like  really  stupid (ie "The Cheese Dentures Incedent" hahah) you  must  kill them.  What?  Oh, right, there are laws against that. Well...Kill them, then kill anyone who objects, and just to be sure you're safe, kill yourself. 4. Buy me a digital video camera, I'll love you for life and I'm serious.  Aww hell, I can't resist that smile, I'll always love  you .  It would be appreciated though.  There you have it, so now it is up to you.  I leave you with these words of wisdom passed down onto me by my good friend glucose;  Be awesome, kick some ass, and don't be stupid.  Practice every day, you'll know you've achieved awesomeness when you can shoot mind rays like me.  G'night!

       This post brought to you in part by  SEAN-O-VISION .    "Hell yes, we have color, what are you, stupid?"     Imagine videos.  Really good videos.  Really  great  videos.  No, I'm not talking about Tom Green on DVD or even porn.  I'm talking about the  Sean Show *.  Yeah, I have some great ideas cooking in my little head and they need to be filmed, but this is where I run into a problem.  I do not own a video camera, and people who do are incredible tight asses!  Yes, you guessed it, I, Sean Berwick, the one and only abuser of commas, am asking  YOU , yes  YOU  for help.  Please lend me your video camera every once in a while or...   Send any donations to the Sean Needs a Goddamn Video Camera fund! 1084 Queen Street West - Unit 32b Mississauga, Ontario, Canada L5H 4K4 (People who know me can always donate personally)   Not only will you get a sweet ass hug (or the female variant known as an ass grab), but people who donate will receive  a FREE secret prize !**  SWEET!  Oh, and I am also currently accepting souls if you have an extra you could spare.   * Show name subject to change. ** You only get a prize if A) I feel like it. B) You're liked by me (see the COPS post).

       Alright, Sean here, and I have a wonderful treat for everyone to enjoy. First, anyone who knows me knows I hate the United Kingdom, and anyone who knows I hate the UK knows I hate Stacey Mellish.  Sure, I don't actually  know  Stacey, but that doesn't stop me from hating her does it?  Besides, she's always bugging me, and it seems no one from the UK can spell.  My good old friend Shum (*tips hat*) introduced me to Stacey  Faggish  a while back, and hilarity ensued.  Today was different.  Why?  Because I went to hotmail, looked at her secret question and then simply said, "Stacey, what's your dad's middle name?"...A couple seconds later, "Anthony."  I proceeded to change her password to ' stupidf ' (yes, stupidf) and logged onto her account.  I had nothing planned, it just happened.  Anyways, a bunch of her friends started talking to me, and I saved a couple conversations, and well, they're funny.  I am here today to present to you  the Mellish archives :     urlLink Eine ,  urlLink Zwei ,  urlLink Drei ,  urlLink Vier  The messages in  blue  are from me. The information at the top of each convo is stuff I got from their profile.

       Sorry I haven't posted in a while...I was working on the server and now it's exam week.  School's pretty much over though, and I present to you  one of my favourite posts so far.  =D  Do you know Andy Rooney? If so, I feel your pain. Usually as a person gets older, they get uglier, however in this case Andy got stupider. He must have been smelling the fumes off his 200 plastic candles at his last birthday party. I just don't understand how anyone can be as brain dead as sir Rooney.  For those of you that don't know Andy Rooney, he is the rotting corpse on 60 Minutes who delivers the news that all of us are interested in. An example? Sure, I happen to have one right here;   "You can't tell much about a store from the store windows.   I'm not a window-shopper, anyway. If I go to a store, I don't stand outside looking at their windows. As a matter of fact, most people don't seem to pay much attention to the windows.   That must bother the people who do them. Stores go to a lot of trouble making their windows attractive, but they do some strange things. They try to make the mannequins look real, but then, half the time they ruin it by leaving the heads off."   - Andy Rooney (read: overpaid ass)

        Everyone who reads this will hate it. But,  I do give Lord of the Rings credit for being the  least  bit interesting. You know whyyyyy? Because Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings are very well made movies. They're made so well that even if you hate the movie, after you see it you will enjoy it. I hate both, because;  a)  The Neverending Story  was shorter. b) Wizards, talking trees, massive computer generated wars, there is only so much I can take. c) Harry Potter, written by some homeless dyke mom who is a good writer, was created to be read to her little kids.  The books got published, and somehow it was not only little kids who read the little kids books. Now she's really rich.  If Harry Potter is your thing, then, whatever, but something's not right when you try to act uber mature and then you go put your wizard hat on to catch the first release at 1:30 AM. It's just not possible.   I would rather see someone get stabbed through their temples, or better yet,  I  would rather stab  myself  through the temples than watch someone who hasn't hit puberty go to a fictional school (HP). Also, I don't know much about Harry Potter, but they all talk like they're from the UK, and I detest the UK. It's just not possible.   The only thing I hate more than Harry Potter are the retarded parents who tried to  BAN  the book! OMG! He's casting a spell, call the pope.  The whole thing is messed up, you have university graduates reaching climax at the thought of seeing the new movie, and you have parents trying to ban a childrens book!  It's just not not not possible.  Lord of the Rings on the other hand is okay. I finally watched the first one, and it was not bad. Yes, that's right, everyone who tried to get me to see the movie but I refused, there you have it. I might actually consider it a great movie if a third of the characters weren't  the gayest things anyone could come up with, ever . Overall though, LOTR is okay, but Harry Potter...Come on...

       Guess whaaaaaaaaaaaat... =D  Sean Berwick, yes me, the awesomest of all that is awesome, has finally set up his home server!  Hosting hooray!  I will divide this introduction into two sections;    Basically,   This means I will host Audio, Video, Art, Text, and other stuff all one one   urlLink big huge server   known as my computer.  You can see all my stuff, and if you want, send me your stuff over MSN Messenger and I might post it! =D    But technically,   My 802.11b router had to be disconnected for the site to work.  Unfortunately, we need to have the router up so my mom can use the other computer that is networked to it, so until I find out how to negociate the site and the router to work together, there will be a problem.  If you have any information on how I could solve that, please inform me at stringtheory@gmail.com.  If you need details, it's a microsoft wireless router, 802.11b as I said before, and my server is running on Faststream NETFile 6.6.  I'm guessing the quickest solution is to use different hosting software, but this is free and yeah.  Well, I hope you guys like the changes! Keep checking for updates.  Love, Sean

       Howdy-do!  I've come to the conclusion that everyone has something they want to share, and if possible, I'd like to make that possible.  I might be hosting it with my ISP or buying some cheap web space, but this means I need money.  I don't have a job yet, so if you have music/art/videos that you would like to contribute, I might have like a sign up page and members etc. and I'll host it all somewhere.  You get the idea.  No guarantees here, this is all hypothetical.  I will probably end up creating a large FTP on my hard drive and just using my PC as a server.  If you have any ideas or can help me with this, I'd gladly give you credit so drop me an IM at stringtheory@gmail.com on MSN Messenger.  Hooray!  Love, Sean

       Hello everybody!  I just want to mention some changes...Dain left, he seems very busy, so now it's just me =).  Also, I changed the colors a bit I guess, and the title.  If you want to see a full picture of that check it out  urlLink here . That's pretty much it for now. I won't be posting for a while because it's exam week and stuff, but as soon as that's over I promise I'll have some good fresh stuff.  Hooray!  Sean
