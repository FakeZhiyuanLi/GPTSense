      Well, the past week has been hectic. It started all well and good...me and my husband officially became God Parents. We celebrated with a small party and lunch with family. I am so glad to be a part of the Linstad Clan. They do everything together. I never had that growing-up. Attending the baptism and lunch did however bring about the question of when John and I will begin to multiply. My repetitive answer is "it will be awhile". I am just having WAY too much fun now to start that chapter yet. My new sister-in-law/best friend told me to stop worrying about what everyone else thinks. So I will. She is pretty good with advise. Speaking of advise, Katie took me shopping for a wedding on saturday...she trampled all over the mall of america with me looking for the perfect dress. We found it, with three minutes left to go. Now I have to decide on accessories....back to Katie.   Work has been busy but I like it. We are getting ready for the State of MN to come in and do their annual suprise survey. That will be a headache and a 1/2. Well, I'm taking several residents to the Zoo today, should be a good time. Got steaks thawing to use on Johns new "manly" grill...he is so excited to break it in...  casey

      Well, this is my first attempt to blog. I was interested in this after I read a beautiful blog entry on my cousins boyfriends page. He had written so beautifully about our Grandma who has recently made her trip to heaven. He inspired me to give this a try. Plus I think it will be nice to be able to journal using the computer. Today my new husband and I are in La Crosse (my alma matter), attending the graduation ceremony of one of my best girlfriends. Tomorrow our niece is being baptized and we are the God parents. Good things come in simple gestures and small packages. -Casey

      The stress of the Health Department Survey is OVER. Today the survey team did their exit conference. Our nursing home did VERY well, we had only 5 minor deficiencies. All of which can be corrected. The survey was very stressful but it truly is a validation that Saint Paul's Church Home is a good place to work and to live. The staff all should be proud of themselves.

      WHOA! Most people think of a nursing home as a quiet place filled with little old people. That is completely wrong. It is it's own world, filled with overworked staff, an interesting variety of residents, and once a year State of Minnesota Health department surveyers. They come into the home unnanounced and take a look at everything we are doing (did I forget that i work in a nursing home?). All of our documentation, how we care for our residents and in my department...how our Recreation Therapy programs run. I know that everyone says that if you are doing your job correctly all the time that having someone come and observe you should be no big deal. I will say that it is indeed, a stressful time for everyone at the home. The one bright spot in all of this is that if we are truly offering a good home for our residens (aka doing our job) the survey is a vaidation of our good works. I can say proudly that I turned over some of my records today with confidence that they were as good as they could be, and that they hopefully will find that I am doing a good job. This being my first survey process, I am approachin it with open eyes and a bit of anticipation. I am watching my co-workers and seeing how they are dealing with the extra stress of the survey....enough survey onto something else.   My husband and I are getting ready to have our wedding reception on the 12th. We did a "planned elope" wedding and want to celebrate with our family and friends who couldn't elope with us. We are having a wedding reception pig roast...BBQ, beer and people I love. Who could ask for more? Details to follow.
