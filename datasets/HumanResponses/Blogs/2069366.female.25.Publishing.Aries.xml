      Yesterday was kinda moody. Surrounded with tempered 'aroma' where I could sense the anger feeling. Basically oneself could show off the anger when someone who get near to that person who you are not suppose to be although you do nothing wrong. What's make that person who expresses the temper? Not satisfy? Angry with something or someone? Or to much thinking that you couldn't get the answer? Here is what I have found out the sources about the 'anger':     The Nature of Anger     Anger is "an emotional state that varies in intensity from mild irritation to intense fury and rage," according to Charles Spielberger, PhD, a psychologist who specializes in the study of anger. Like other emotions, it is accompanied by physiological and biological changes; when you get angry, your heart rate and blood pressure go up, as do the levels of your energy hormones, adrenaline, and noradrenaline.  Anger can be caused by both external and internal events. You could be angry at a specific person(Such as a coworker or supervisor) or event (a traffic jam, a canceled flight),or your anger could be caused by worrying or brooding about your personal problems.Memories of traumatic or enraging events can also trigger angry feelings.      Expressing Anger     The instinctive, natural way to express anger is to respond aggressively. Anger is a natural, adaptive response to threats; it inspires powerful, often aggressive, feelings and behaviors, which allow us to fight and to defend ourselves when we are attacked. A certain amount of anger, therefore, is necessary to our survival.   On the other hand, we can't physically lash out at every person or object that irritates or annoys us; laws, social norms, and common sense place limits on how far our anger can take us.  People use a variety of both conscious and unconscious processes to deal with their angry feelings. The three main approaches are expressing, suppressing, and calming. Expressing your angry feelings in an assertive not aggressive manner is the healthiest way to express anger. To do this, you have to learn how to make clear what your needs are, and how to get them met, without hurting others. Being assertive doesn't mean being pushy or demanding; it means being respectful of yourself and others.   Anger can be suppressed, and then converted or redirected. This happens when you hold in your anger, stop thinking about it, and focus on something positive. The aim is to inhibit or suppress your anger and convert it into more constructive behavior. The danger in this type of response is that if it isn't allowed outward expression, your anger can turn inward on yourself. Anger turned inward may cause hypertension, high blood pressure, or depression.   Unexpressed anger can create other problems. It can lead to pathological expressions of anger, such as passive-aggressive behavior (getting back at people indirectly, without telling them why, rather than confronting them head-on) or a personality that seems perpetually cynical and hostile. People who are constantly putting others down, criticizing everything, and making cynical comments haven't learned how to constructively express their anger. Not surprisingly, they aren't likely to have many successful relationships.   Finally, you can calm down inside. This means not just controlling your outward behavior, but also controlling your internal responses, taking steps to lower your heart rate, calm yourself down, and let the feelings subside.   As Dr. Spielberger notes, "when none of these three techniques work, that's when someone or something is going to get hurt."   Sound interesting? Have you guys watch 'Anger Management'? Pretty funny movie!  :)

      Yesterday night I was watching TV at home. Kinda bored staying the in the house when no one around except my 3rd brother sleeping soundly at the living hall. Then Joe called me to let me know that he wanted to return back my Digital Camera and as well called me to yam char at Mid Valley, Kim Gary's Restaurant. That was the time almost 10.00pm. Me, Joe, Jeffery, Alan and Mee Lan called our own dishes for their own supper or dinner.    The interior of the restaurant.    I like the bulp mini lights in here.    My French Toast - yummies~    Toast into cutting edges.    I dunno what kind of burger is this. ;)    My tea...hot tea.    Our last call drinks.  Overall, we were enjoying ourselves. Jokes around while check out some babes and guys in the restaurant but unluckily Joe can't get to shoot the babe's picture which my friends (the guys) claimed 'she' was natural beautiful. Heee

      This morning was kind of moody because of the stomach troubling my body but then I managed to control my emotion and pain. I took medicines...phew...luckily I remember to bring the pain-killer. Oh, well...guess nothing much to report.

      Yesterday my family asked me how come I got back home so early. Oh, dear.....! I told them nothing much to do in the office so here I am. Then my eldest brother came back checking on his left armpit...the acne...big gigantic pimple at least 4cm size! WOW~ The head pustule came out with juicy yellowish color blister....yucks! He asked me to help him to squeeze out the pustules....Yheeww~ I squeezed pathetically so that the whole damn pustules out it. Bloody out from his armpit while he can't stand the pain on his armpit. Kinda funny when seeing my brother curse in pain. Heeheee.  Hmmm......I should keep in clean and drink more water to get out of these gigantic pimple especially on the armpit side. LOL.

      Today is the 1st blogging here. I do not know what to say here but I would rather say....at last I could really spend some minutes to write something here.  Today not much happening since last weekends. Last weekends were amazing as I spent almost half of the day sleeping like a Sleeping Beauty. Last Saturday I woke up at 6.00pm and slept at 6.30am. On Sunday I woke up at 5.30pm. ;)  Sunday was a amazing day. I spent the day wth my ex-collegemates at his house. Kinda cool when someone (a guy) cooked spaghetti and beef steaks for all of 7 people for dinner. I was kinda surprising but anyway I managed to eat his cooking. Not bad at all, at least edible. heeeheee.  While we were eating, we were watching F1 at Bahrain Grand Prix. That was cool watching Michael Schumacher won again for the third time. Later on, we were head to yam cha session at Steven's Corner until midnight. There we need to sleep to get up in the morning for work.  Practically, everything seem so lame with the weather of wet. Last weekends was pouring like cat and dog and now...seem raining heavily. Well, guess need to be home soon if not stuck in the traffic jam.

      I was surfing the net, as usual in the morning where I found this URL  urlLink http://www.mgskl.edu.my/index2.html  which was my ex-school's website. I was so surprised to see the website but kinda upset cos my pictures was not there. Hee  Anyway, I have surfed the whole website...and not bad to find the structure of the website but then too bad that it was not up-to-date the contents. Hmm, maybe I guess the 'Web Team' is busy with the preparation of the functions or events that happening in the school.  Then I checked out the Guestbook and thoroughly read all. I found a familiar name who was my ex-classmate. I had emailed her and hopefully is the person who I knew. I've been trying to keep in touch with others who really lost contact. Memories were bond in my heart to remember. I was very happy in that years together. I wondered what they're doing.

      Yesterday was nothing much happened but this morning was really a bad news that I heard from my mum. She said my cousin-bro has an accident which damaged his car but then he was okay....safe. My mum was worried about him cos he's just 21 and if anything happen to him, not only we all the families will be sad but his mum will deeply sad.  I hope and wish that he will be fine and find the positive paths toward his life as he's been 'lost' in nowhere.  Cherish the life along with closest families that really love and care for him.

      I have a good times during weekends. Last Friday I went to Zouk, Velvet Underground to see the Heineken Finalist DJ-ing but then I didn't watched the whole competition cos I and Michael went there very early before the event. Good exploring the whole place.....not bad the place but unlucky I couldn't take any snapshots to show here coz...not enough lighting on my mobile. :)  Anyway, I managed to take the outside of the place.    Then on Saturday, I went to IKEA to accompany friends. Not bad but I like so much the foods there. In the night, yam char session at Mount Kiara, Coffee Beans with a bunch of friends....kinda tired but then managed to stay up quite late. :)  Yesterday, I went to Bukit Bintang the area to have lunch with Michael. He want to treat me a lunch for a birthday treats. We ate at DOME Cafe....not bad the foods there. We went to Sungei Wang to look for my new shoe. I bought a sport shoe...quite affordable..and not bad too...at least i have new shoe at last!  Well, today is my birthday! I hope those who know me will have a wonderful and cheerful life. And as for me...hope all my wishes may come true......

      I'm getting better although still with the sickness. Anyway, I was browsing the Yahoo Music website....I watched several music videos...here I found a MV sang by Weird Al Yankovic is called 'Fat'. The whole idea of the MV is exactly same as Michael Jackson's MV - 'Bad'....It is so funny and I burst out loud. Here is the lyrics:    Fat - Weird Al Yankovic    Your butt is wide, well mine is too Just watch your mouth or I'll sit on you The word is out, better treat me right 'Cause I'm the king of cellulite Ham on, ham on, ham on whole wheat, all right  My zippers bust, my buckles break I'm too much man for you to take The pavement cracks when I fall down I've got more chins than Chinatown  Well, I've never used a phone booth And I've never seen my toes When I'm goin' to the movies I take up seven rows  Because I'm fat, I'm fat, come on (Fat, fat, really really fat) You know I'm fat, I'm fat, you know it (Fat, fat, really really fat) You know I'm fat, I'm fat, come on you know (Fat, fat, really really fat) Don'tcha call me pudgy, portly or stout Just now tell me once again who's fat  When I walk out to get my mail It measures on the Richter scale Down at the beach I'm a lucky man I'm the only one who gets a tan If I have one more pie a la mode I'm gonna need my own zip code  When you're only having seconds I'm having twenty-thirds When I go to get my shoes shined I gotta take their word  Because I'm fat, I'm fat, sha mone (Fat, fat, really really fat) You know I'm fat, I'm fat, you know it (Fat, fat, really really fat) You know I'm fat, I'm fat, you know it you know (Fat, fat, really really fat) And my shadow weighs forty-two pounds Lemme tell you once again who's fat  If you see me comin' your way Better give me plenty space If I tell you that I'm hungry Then won't you feed my face  Because I'm fat, I'm fat, come on (Fat, fat, really really fat) You know I'm fat, I'm fat, you know it (Fat, fat, really really fat) You know I'm fat, I'm fat, you know it, you know (Fat, fat, really really fat) Woo woo woo, when I sit around the house I really sit around the house  You know I'm fat, I'm fat, come on (Fat, fat, really really fat) You know I'm fat, I'm fat, you know it, you know it (Fat, fat, really really fat) You know, you know, you know, come on (Fat, fat, really really fat) And you know all by myself I'm a crowd Lemme tell you once again  You know I'm huge, I'm fat, you know it (Fat, fat, really really fat) You know I'm fat, you know, hoo (Fat, fat, really really fat) You know I'm fat, I'm fat, you know it, you know (Fat, fat, really really fat) And the whole world knows I'm fat and I'm proud Just tell me once again who's fat   Funny, huh?! This guy is really funny. Almost of his MVs are funny. Heehee  Hmm...yesterday and today I drank the same bottle of orange juice manufactured by Coca-Cola Qoo Orange Soft Drink. Delicious and yummie~ Tried to get more vitamin C. Therefore, I like the Qoo cute little creature, bottle design. Qoo fanatic. heeeheeee. Hardly to get Qoo drinks in Malaysia but I know in Singapore got alot. Sometimes whoever my friends go there, I will ask them to buy some for me. Qoooooo   Should try this....

      Last Friday, while I was watching ASTRO TV, I changed channels after had watched the usual Chinese Drama Series. There, I saw Disney Channel has shown 'The Sound Of Music'. Thank goodness, at last I could see the whole show of 'The Sound Of Music'. Maybe you think the show is very very classic old show/movie but for me that was my favourite's one. I watched the whole show....for about almost 3 hours. I was touched with the song of 'Edelweiss' sang by Christopher Plummer (Captain von Trapp). Ohh, he was a legend charming man who really make me wondering/fantasize while he was singing that song. Therefore, it's flashback my memories during my secondary school where I was then a School Brigade. I still can remember the lyrics of the song. Simple and easy to sing too. Try it yourself:    Edelweiss     Edelweiss, Edelweiss   Every morning you greet me Small and white, clean and bright You look happy to meet me  Blossom of snow may you bloom and grow Bloom and grow forever  Edelweiss, Edelweiss Bless my homeland forever   Not only that song but got other songs played in the show...   Sixteen Going on Seventeen     Maria:  You are sixteen going on seventeen  Waiting for life to start  Somebody kind who touches your mind  Will suddenly touch your heart   Liesl:  When that happens, after it happens  Nothing is quite the same  Somehow I know I'll jump up and go  If ever he calls my name   Maria:  Gone are your old ideas of life  The old ideas grow dim  Lo and behold you're someone's wife  And you belong to him   You may think this kind of adventure  Never may come to you  Darling sixteen going on seventeen  Wait a year . . .  Liesl:  I'll wait a year . . .  Maria:  Just wait a year . . .  Maria and Liesl:  Or two   And last but not least, the main song:   The Sound of Music     The hills are alive with the sound of music  With songs they have sung for a thousand years  The hills fill my heart with the sound of music  My heart wants to sing every song it hears   My heart wants to beat like the wings of the birds  that rise from the lake to the trees  My heart wants to sigh like a chime that flies  from a church on a breeze  To laugh like a brook when it trips and falls over  stones on its way  To sing through the night like a lark who is learning to pray   I go to the hills when my heart is lonely  I know I will hear what I've heard before  My heart will be blessed with the sound of music  And I'll sing once more   Not to forget, Julie Andrews (Maria) was a sweet and extra-ordinary artist. The latest I saw her casting in 'The Princess Diaries' movie. Well, she is still charming as last time although ages is around. :)

      Yesterday after work I was nearly sick. My left-side nose has a running nose, weird huh?! Therefore, I have slightly cough. I guess because of the weather is hot or because of lately I've been not drinking water alot. Kind of irritating of one side of my nose blocked. Feel distress and tired although I haven't seen any doctor yet but I took Vitamins to build up my antibody. Anyway, if there nothing much of help from Vitamins, then I should really really need to see doctor. ;P

Going up to Genting Highlands...dunno what to do but guess hang out there seem so long didn't go there since last year ago. Gonna spend a night there, after that dunno what's up to.  Oh, yah! I was listening to a Internet Radio through my iTunes 4.5: HitzRadio.com, got a song very interesting that was originally sang by Eamon-"F**k It (I Don't Want You Right Back)" but then this one is a respond and answer to his song - cool.        F**k It (I Don't Want You Right Back) by Eamon   Whoa oh oh Ooh hooh No No No  See i dont, know why..i liked you so much I gave you all...of my trust I told you i loved you...now thats all down the drain Ya put me through pain, i wanna let u know (ahhh) that i feel how i feel  Fuck what i said it dont mean shit now Fuck the presents might as well throw 'em out Fuck all those kisses, it didnt mean jack Fuck you...you hoe!!! i dont want you back (ahhh)  Fuck what i said it dont mean shit now Fuck the presents might as well throw em out Fuck all those kisses it didnt mean jack Fuck you, you hoe, i dont want you back  You thought, you could, Keep this shit from me, yeah Ya burnt bitch, i heard the story Ya played me, you even gave him head Now ya askin for me back Ya just another act, look elsewhere Cuz you're done with me  Fuck what i said it dont mean shit now Fuck the presents might as well throw em out Fuck all those kisses it didnt mean jack Fuck you you hoe, i dont want you back  Fuck what i said it dont mean shit now Fuck the presents might as well throw em out Fuck all those kisses it didnt mean jack Fuck you you hoe, i dont want you back  Oh oh Uh hun yeah Oh oh Uh hun yeah Oh oh Uh hun yeah Oh oh Uh hun yeah  Ya questioned, did i care?

When there a singer sings something that can related or get the respond throught the lyrics and into a song. Anyway, that is cool. At least we, listeners could hear 2 kind of versions but then unlucky that our nation radio couldn't air these songs. Wanna hear? Get it from Yahoo.  Cheers everybody! Happy Holidays!!!!!!!!!!

      I was given a pair of tickets, thanks to my colleague, to see a premiere screening of 'Van Helsing' movie at TGV KLCC.  It was a great show but unfortunately the show was disturbed with the screen out of frame. Kinda annoying and out of mood to see this exciting moments. Pathetic.  Anyway, should recommend on this show to be seen. Nice, compact, scary, cool, charming, horror, terror, touched......   urlLink      urlLink   Van Helsing Official Website

      Last Saturday was my grandma's birthday (mum's side), was her 80th Birthday, if I'm not mistaken. But then she was not interested to have a major party or what-so-ever huge restaurant, invitations and cake celebration on her birthday. My grandma kinda superstitious person although she insisted she's not. :)p  Anyway, she just want to have a gathering/potluck on Sunday, some sort like that so that everyone her children, grandchildren et cetera et cetera could come and enjoy the day with grandma although there were not any singing birthday song. The law in the house whoever come to my house where my grandma is staying with me and my family, not to wish her 'Happy Birthday'; these 2 words, against her law of celebration. Heee.  Got rules set. Don't mess with my grandma. Heeeheee. She asked every of her children which she has 3 daughters including my mum and 2 sons; means that are my aunties and uncles to cook one or two dishes and bring them to my house. Kinda cool concept although this concept have been used ages. Hee. But then once the gathering over....me and my family need to clean-up the house, prepare forks and spoons and cup and everything to be prepared before they come. Pheww~ kinda exhausted but fun seeing everyone is happy and enjoying the foods and people. I managed to see almost all my cousins who came.     Super-duber dishes. Thanks to those aunties and uncles for your contributions on such a delicious and yummies foods!!!  After the gathering over, we almost all of us went to Buddhist Temple at Brickfields to have a prayer on Wesak Eve. That time was nearly past 10pm but alot of people have their blessing and prayer there.  It was cool, meeting up with my aunties uncles and cousins during the gathering dinner with grandma as her wished. Although it was exhusted but worth for grandma to be happy. Happy Belated Birthday, Ah-Mah!!!!  On Monday, me, my boy and his mum went to Genting Highlands for a night stay there. We reached there by noon. Frankly, this was my 1st time to see that we got to take number at the counter to get into the check-in reception. Wow~ This is really amazing and not bad at all that Genting is fairly welcome by all sort of people to hang out here. Hmm...  After we check-in, we walked all the path-way through First World Plaza, Genting Hotel....and other hotels that we went through forgotten bout the name of the hotel. Busy and crowded with people but enjoying the weather of cold that I almost forgot bout the bustling people here and there. We took out lunch at fast food shop then we walked to get to sit the cable car. Quite far distance to walk to the Cable Car (Genting Skyway Cable Car) the place but worth it seem the service is quite fast although we got to quece up such a long quece. 15 minutes journey of the cable car. Quite fast and smooth 'abit' while hanging above the ground of the jungles. Throughout the journey, we could see some scupltures of displays. Cold and refreshing air of the atmosphere. Nice view too, if you people not afraid of height. Hee  Later in the night, we had our dinner and then have a relaxing drinks at Starbucks near out hotel. After that, we went for a movie at the nearby Cineplex at First World Plaza. Nice place, not bad. We watched until 10.30pm, then we went back to hotel room. Me and my boy went out together to have some fun around at Game Arcade. We tried at Adult Bumper Car which was nearly past 11pm after I've been cheated some tokens at the Racing Car, Game Arcade. Unlucky night that I couldn't race along with my boy to show my skill of driving. Heeeheee  At the Adult Bumper Car, what I saw was a bunch of kids with reached the height of the rules set there. Kinda pathetic with these kids seem the sign board written "ADULT BUMPER CAR" still have some kids playing along. Well, never mind we both enjoying bumping on each other while with other kids too. :)  Then we went towards to Starbucks again at First World Plaza. Nice place with antique structure of the place in the middle of man-made small river. Everything seem cold, nice, perfectly night outing that ease your heart of enjoying the day. We headed back to hotel room and slept. The next morning we got up bout 7plus to check-out. Leave the hotel and the place in the early morning because to avoid the traffic-jam. While goin down the road we passed by a temple. There we prayed and then we left. Gosh, that was tired holidays although Genting is just 1 hour ride back to my house!    Nice perspective view of the front long reception in First World Hotel.    My baby-boy looking out while we were in the cable car! Scary ohhh~    Really can't see the mini sculptures below from the shot here but then I circle them out...supposingly is the sculptures of monkeys in the jungle while I was sitting in the cable car from the top view. Try yourself at Genting Skyway Cable Car. Fast and Longest in South East Asia. :)    Try out our free drinks at Starbucks. Cold and ease. Not bad at all. Full time favourite drink - Ice Blended Green Tea Frappucino. Yummies~ ;)    Face of the day! Heehee    Giant Buddha in the Temple after we left the Hotel.    Lastly, a flower for you people who blog in. I dunno what is the flower calls but nice blossom flower where I saw nearby the Temple.  Hopefully you people could really enjoying yourselves during the holidays!

      Phew~Yesterday I was surfing around my blogger site and I found that  urlLink Blogger  has come with a new look, a new interface, and tons of new features. So I took this opportunity to take a new look as well for mine web-blog.  It took me sometime which was almost a half of the day to complete this. Phew~ I need to overcome with my archives; previous posts and all the HTML programming...wow...I nearly tension while configured out the solution and the outcome.  At last, here is this. What do you think? I thought I wanna to have my own layout with my own trademark of design or logos. But I couldn't help myself with HTML things. I really need an expertise.

      Today is my boy's birthday. Although we don't really celebrate tonight as seem he's busy working night shift but then i had the chance to treat and gave him a present last weekends. I hope that he could enjoy the life to the fullest and my all the wishes come true. Stay healthy and happy always!    New Hairstyle~   Yesterday I tried to have a new hairstyle since past 4 years ago never really step into the saloon's doorstep. Until now, been surviving with that long layered hair. Heee Finally, yesterday I dare to have and beautify my hair. At last, my hair have a little colored (highligted) and trimmed abit shorter. I wanted to have fringe but then advised not to have seem I've been tying up my hair so long doesn't make the fringe standable(presentable). Cool~....at least light up my hair! :)

      It's been a week that I didn't blog in. Why? I also dunno why. Maybe because of laziness? Tired? No stories/journal/something to post? Or don't even bother to blog in.  Sometimes I think, I dunno what to say. Sometimes I think whatever I saying here can't even be bothered or annoyed or frustrated or dunno what am I saying.  Been away from blog almost a week, dunno what to tell/say. Something need to be keep ourselves, and not be told around here.

      What a tired weekends - specially on yesterday. I was damn tired although I just clean up my bookshelf of my 2nd's brother room & his family (was used to be my room - master bedroom). I got to packed 6 bag of large rubbish bags. All contain of my books, magazines, files, photo album, negatives (film), perfums, beauty accessories, nice paper bags/plastics, cigarette boxes, toys, nice shape of mineral bottles, portfolio etc. Phew~ and all the way I cleaned up the whole bookshelf. Thanks to my 2nd brother being helpful hand to carry the bookshelf to next door's house. All the 6 rubbish bags, I got to carry all by myself. Now, I felt tired on my leg and waist. Getting old...

      Me and my colleagues went to Chutney's, PJ Old Town to have a farewell dinner for one of my colleague, Chak. A very nice environmental kind of restaurant and classy Indian foods restaurant. Perfectly nice place for dinner especially for the foods but then kinda costly.&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink    Here I wish all the best to Chak!   Here is the attraction of the place. 3-D artistic painting on the wall. Nice! Presentable and grand! I love that wall. So much alive and lovely.&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink

      Today was hectic. Havoc. Anxious. Not free. :(  I was working and working trying to finish up the lay-out of 10 pages reviewed. Duhh...I was working until I couldn't remember the time for lunch but I could hear the bell tune of the sign on lunch-time. I work and work and work and work; finally finish the work.  Gosh! I was past 4pm. I don't really feel hungry but I need to eat. So I headed to a supermarket and bought the so called homemade dishes from Jusco. Kinda fast food to me. I bought milk and spaghetti. I ate them just in front of my PC at my workplace. Smell good with the sauces when heated up. I took my time to enjoy and eat.    urlLink    My lunch meal. Simple spaghetti with fresh low fat milk.&nbsp; urlLink

      This week is gonna be very busy cos of the workloads. End of the month, as usual habit for my publishing company to rush up the magazine before the dateline. Days by day, the sky was pretty calm and not hot in early morning. I like this kind of weather. Calm and windy. This morning I had a breakfast with my colleagues. I've been observed there was a one company; just outside their company has a little pond. Something in particular with 'feng-sui' but I like the lotus so much. Well-grown flowers with clear water. Nice!  During the tea-time, me and my close colleague cum ex-collegemate went out to Starbucks for a drink. I prefer my favourite drink which was Ice Blended GreenTea Frappuccino. Hmmmph~ Then I ordered a cheesecake. I guess it's a new item of desert was displayed. So I give a try to taste and eat it. Yummies~ My day was lucky to have such a very fresh cheesecake. I hope I will give another try for next time. :)    urlLink    The skies look-a-like gonna rain but greyish clear sky.&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    A little pond filled with timid lotus.

      Yesterday, we've been travelling for almost 4 hours which was a final destination to have a place to eat for our dinner. At first my Uncle wished to bring us to eat at Sekinchan, Selangor where he spotted previous days ago.  Unluckily, we reached there, all the restaurants were closed. Then my uncle decided to try further at somewhere at Sungai Besar, Selangor but all closed too.  Finally we made back to Kuala Selangor which is also famous for the seafoods.  Although the journey was long and unconditionally but we were happy and satisfied. We were gathered together along with my grandma. I think she is happy and fulled!  p/s: I didn't take my grandma's photo...forgotten~ :)  Here are the photos:  urlLink    Picture was captured from the top view of my nephew being cuddled by my mom during the journey to 'makan'.&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Well, here is me! Taken from the top, so that I won't look fat~&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Finally got through the place. We reached there about 7.30pm, the moment of the sunset. Not pretty clear but amazing scenery.&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    While sitting we orderded some dishes (foods) while enjoying the scenery and the seaside.&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Here is the restaurant we were eating. Restoran Kuala Selangor.&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    A dozen of people - we are!

Tranquil and calm.&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Finished. All the foods had finished. The dinner was so filling and delicious but not to our expectation, at least we were fulled!&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Finally, time for desert. But I got to accompany my nephew for his desert! :)&nbsp; urlLink

      Last week, I received an exclusive invitation from Jusco which exclusively for JCard Members' Day of Sale which is a day sale from 9.30am to 11.00pm on 25th June 2004.   urlLink    Jusco's 20th Anniversary has treated the members a great sale!&nbsp; urlLink     I didn't expected that today will be massive madness of people shopping in the store as well the madness of the traffic.  Therefore, the Boulevard Offices have received a notice from the Mid Valley Management about the traffic control and closure of certain entry of the carparks.  So, this morning I went to Jusco early in the morning to check out the prices on the thing that I wanted to buy. But once I got in, there were full of people something the situation like in the night market. Worst still that when packed with people the air-conditional was not cold enough and almost everyone was shopping with sweat.  Terrible. Crazy.  Some of the things they sold were cheap after the discount and some were not.  Anyway, MNG boutique also has a sale which captured alot of ladies lined up a long queue for the fitting room as well for the cashier payment. Too maniac.  But then, I managed to buy something from Jusco. I bought comforter + pillowcase + bedsheet (a set), a bolster and a protecter mattress which cost me RM130++. Phew~ That's was crazy to looking for the cheapest price and good quality.  Lastly, I have them now for my new room, part of the bed's need. Hee...  And here some the photos of the situation:   urlLink    The Midvalley Shopping Mall Carpark were fulled until the back of the Boulevard Offices the carpark spaces never miss to be fulled either.&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Traffic madness. Back of Boulevard Offices at Midvalley, the road was started jammed from morning until 9.30pm.&nbsp; urlLink

      Last Saturday was an amazing experience to have a movie screening under the starlights, but unfortunately not much of stars that day.  It was my 1st time seeing a movie without a proper seat, non air-conditional, proper surround sound systems and non fully dark condition.  At least, it was a good experience to watch at an outdoor cinema. Not only being bitten from dunno what kind of insects/mosquitos, therefore my boy complaining back pain and neck pain too. That time we were unprepared but planned to watch the movies at Bukit Kiara Equestrian and Country Resort. I managed to bring a mat which could enough fitted 2 buttock on the mat. I forgotten to bring foods and drink but luckily there is a food village to occupy our stomach.  I was astonished to see that some people brought a huge mat with mattress, pillows, convenience folded chair, candles, mosquitos repellant etc. Some people lying on the mattress watching the movies and some people sitting on the chair.  I've got an itchy rash all over hands and back of my neck. Thanks to the flying insects. We watched 2 movies at the same night which were Paycheck and Starsky & Hutch. The 1st movie (Paycheck) started at 8.00pm was stunning and full with action packed. It was interesting. The show ended at 10.00pm. We were given 20mins break before the next show. Long winding queue. A queue for a loo. There were 2 booth of public loo. After 20mins break, another movie (Starsky & Hutch) showed. This movie was hilarious but then kinda bored. I guess it bored because of tired sitting on the ground and not comfy or because of the movie not showing the excitement. Hmm...   Finally the show ended at midnight. We were tired. I was having rashes, and my boy having pain in his back and his neck. Throughout the whole both show, the weather was fine and humid. Kinda cooling later in the night.  Anyway, it was a lifetime experience. Next year, if is given another opportunity to watch an outdoor cinema again, I would love too. This time I will be prepared! :)   urlLink    A spot where I managed to have a good-sight seating on the ground.&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    That tenant in which is the projection of the film, in the middle of the field.&nbsp; urlLink

      Yesterday me and my ex-colleague went to watch a Malay horror movie, Pontianak Harum Sundal Malam at GSC Mid Valley right after work.  Firstly, she was late for the movie about 5 minutes cos she need to stuck in the traffic jam at Jalan Tun Razak from her workplace (my former workplace, Ampang Point). Then after we met up at the cinema, we got stuck again in the jam, which was the queue jam. So damn slow the worker to serve the customer inside the nearby cine-screen halls. That made us late for about 10 minutes. Once we got in the hall, I guess we missed 10 minutes introduction of the movie.  Everything was fine to see that movie but later on I found it bored.   This is what about the movie according to their  urlLink official website    The Past- 1947, Kampung Paku Laris  The primadonna Meriam, a gamelan dancer is well known in the town of Paku Laris. Meriam wins the hearts of many admirers and is revered for every performance in town as well as in the Palace. The "Bunga Sundal Malam" (Tuberose) is her trademark symbolizing her grace and mesmerizing beauty. The audiences also look forward to her famous dance where she is able to 'float' on the canang. Marsani and his close friend Danial are among the many admirers who compete to win Meriam's heart. However Meriam chooses Danial for a husband instead of the more powerful and handsome Marsani. With his ego bruised, Marsani burns with jealousy and continues to obsessively pursue Meriam.   Pregnant with her first child, Meriam is found laying in a pool of blood by Laila and Sitam, her loyal friends. Marsani is devastated by Meriam's tragic death. On top of that, Danial's life is also taken when his boat sinks at sea during a storm. Strange happenings begin to occur in the town of Paku Laris. Many families and friends connected to Marsani are killed. The villagers begin to accuse Meriam of having dabbled in black magic and has now returned as a 'Pontianak'.   The Present- 2003  Marsani continuously hide behind his guilt and holds a dark secret that torments him up to the present day. Marsani lives out his old age in constant fear awaiting Meriam's return. He is convinced that Meriam is out to destroy his entire family line. He stays young and fit through ozone treatments and plastic surgery in preparation of having to face Meriam. The deranged Asmadi is used to his uncle's paranoia and nightmares.   Norman, Marsani's grandson is marries to Ana who a new Cafe and employs Maria as one of her workers. In Marsani's eyes, Maria resembles Meriam and thus becomes his latest obsession. He is convinced that Meriam is back for revenge and Norman and Anna will be her next victims. Working as an engineer, Norman and his workers discover a burial site during an excavation. Soon after this, Norman falls ill and Marsani finds that his family is under threat again when continuous strange sightings are spotted around Paku Laris. Maria starts to experience a change overcoming her personality and feels she is no longer Maria. She becomes petrified when Marsani discovers a mark on the nape of her neck and accuses her of being a 'Pontianak'.   The constant scent of the 'Bunga Sundal Malam' (Tuberose) and the discovery of a chest of old artifacts belonging to Marsani lead to peculiar incidents at Anna's house, causing a strain on Norman and Anna's marriage. Marsani and Asmadi try to warn Norman and Anna that Maria is Meriam who has returned as a 'Pontianak' to avenge the family however Norman and Ana are not convinced.  Marsani in the end forces Maria into a final confrontation.   Who really is Maria?  One thing for sure that they left out is that Marsani was a married man in the past and has a son but during the rampage, his son was missing without trace.  But basically, I found this movie not interesting although the storyline is simple but they made it too complex.  Here is what the moviegoer writer said about the movie, which was almost what I have been thinking of:  As a whole, this film has more loopholes than the roads in KL. It's a simple story to follow; however the flow just wasn't there. You'd think that walking barefoot on a pavement of pebbles is a lot smoother than this. For instance, why must Marsani keep himself young, relying on this so-called ozone treatment, while he awaits the face off with Meriam's angry spirit? And while we're on this, since when did surgical technology produce such magnificent results, so much so that the "old" Marsani looks more like he just had a bad day, rather than having aged 60 years? In addition to that, how did he know that Meriam would be coming back for him at that particular period of time? Why would she want to wait six whole decades before she gets to rest in peace?  That brings us to the question of Maria. Is she really Meriam's daughter? Or is she just a descendant? Because she should be about the age of 50 in present day, if she was. And she sure as hell doesn't look a day older than 25. If she's not, what of Meriam's premature baby then? The film showed that the baby survived along with Laila, Meriam's confidant. But it didn't show where they went and what happened to them. There's also the possibility of Maria originating from Indonesia, but again, no distinct explanation on that.   urlLink    Malaysian Horror movie.&nbsp; urlLink

      Last Friday, me and my colleagues went to see the Motorshow at about after work. Supposingly got to pay RM25 per entry but there was a promotion which is RM20 each if buy double ticket at once. Which means we were 4 people = RM80! Discount RM5 each. That's cool!  There were 2 cars outside the entrance, which I don't really know what was the model of the cars. Heee ;)  Once we got in, I were non-stop taking photos of those cars displayed in the exhibition hall. I couldn't remember how many cars were there, but basically there were a lot of people visiting. Mainly the guys/men were there taking pictures too. I can see a lot of them taking pictures if the cars and chicks too. Some of them took their pictures with their own mobile phones and some with camera. Therefore, I saw some professional photographers were there.  At first, I was kinda disappointed cos there were not many of hot chicks standing side of the cars but later on, there were some but still not many.  Overall, I can't say much about the exhibition cos my main was to take pictures of the cars and chicks. I don't know much about a modification of a car but they were amazingly modified, effect and illustrated cars.  Here are my posted pictures:  urlLink    To preview more closer, please click on the picture or  urlLink  here.

      Yesterday, I went to watch King Arthur which was accidentally bought the tickets from my colleague as he bought the wrong movie tickets.  &nbsp;  I was expected to see this movie but only to see it later.  &nbsp;  Anyway, here is it. At first I thought this movie will give me an impression of boring manhood's battlefield story which is something similar with combat battlefields. I doesn't like to watch these kind of movie.  &nbsp;  But this story is different. King Arthur, a spectacular, epic tale of one man's destiny to become a king. Thrilling adventure, action and historical magnificently come together in this unique look at the origins of one of the greatest legends ever told. I like this story, the origin and simple perception to the audience which easy to understand and follow-up the storyline.  &nbsp;  I like the part in a battle scene of a frozen lake that rally benefits from a good theatre sound system, the knights and Guinevere face-off against their enemies using the crackling ice as their secret weapon to send many of the opposing army to their watery ice graves. But unfortunately, one of the knights (Dagonet) has died as he became the bravery/warrior to crack the ice with his mighty weapon.  &nbsp;  Therefore to Guinevere showed the spunk and physical strength while at the same time not distancing herself from her feminine side. She was marvellous with her beauty and tough role as one of the warrior.  &nbsp;  Well, it's recommended to see although the story was about how Arthur become the king.    urlLink     Legendary King Arthur and his Knights.  &nbsp; urlLink       urlLink     Handsome and charming Arthur (Clive Owen).&nbsp; urlLink       urlLink     King Arthur and his Knights, Gawain, Bors, Lancelot, Dagonet, Galahad and Tristan.&nbsp; urlLink       urlLink     Beautiful Guinevere.&nbsp; urlLink       urlLink     Fierce warrior.&nbsp; urlLink       urlLink     Distinctive body paint and tattoos of Guinevere with her battlefield costume.&nbsp; urlLink

      Yesterday was a great feeling when I tried my guts to call my best friend (CT) on her house phone number.   Waiting for the phone ringing, luckily got through. At first I thought she's the one who answered the phone but it was a man answered the phone. I didn't asked who was speaking but he asked me who am I. But later on, I found out from her, it was maybe her dad.   The conversations were like these:    Me: Harlo, boleh saya cakap dengan CT Asmah?  Her dad: CT? Ohh, dia kat Bangi! Ini siapa?  Me: Saya kawan lama dia. Boleh tanya ada tak telefon nombor kat Bangi?  Her dad: Telefon nombor? Ohh! Handphone nombor dia ya? Ada. Boleh tunggu sekejap?  Me: Boleh. (I was waiting about a minute passed while he was looking for her handphone number)  Her dad: Nombor dia ialah 012 xxxxxxx. Nie nama siapa?  Me: Nie Mei Leng. Kawan sekolah dia.  Her dad: Ohh, Mei Leng ya! Sekarang dia kerja kat Bangi.  Me: Kerja apa tuu?  Her dad: Kerja kat Jabatan.....(I was forgotten the name but it was a government sector company) :)  Me: Ohh, dah lama ke dia kerja kat Bangi?  Her dad: Dia ambil loan dari ....... (I can't remember in Malay but he was saying that she took the loan from the course/university and work for government company for about 1 year already)  Me: Ohh, ok. Takpa I call dia. Terima kasih ya pakcik.  Her dad: Ok. Sama-sama.  That's the end of the conversation.   After I got the number, I dialed my handphone. It ringed. There she was, answered the phone. I couldn't recognized her voice as been long time never call her. It was loud and I was smiled when heard her voice. I didn't tell her what's my name but keep talking and ask her how she was. Her voice was furious that she couldn't recognized my voice and I keep talking to her without telling her my name in earlier.   I told her my name and she was so surprised to hear my voice, it was me! From that on, we continued our conversation more than a half an hour. We chatted about her life/my life, married or not, work as what, got keep in touch with other members in the gang et cetera. We exchanged email address in the end.  It was good to hear from her. :)

      I browsed over my old abandoned diary. I read it. I remembered my Form 3 classmates. In my diary, I sticked those pictures of my close classmates who we used to hang out together along. My old diary was my autograph book before it's became a diary. I let my close friends to sign my autograph which I sticked their faces with different body picture which I cut out from magazines. It was funny to read their comments on the photos and their notes for me. It was fun during that years.   urlLink    This was what my autograph used to be.&nbsp; urlLink     I have their addresses and contacts but then it's been long time we didn't keep in touch. Last time I used to write letter to very close friend (her name is called CT) but during college time, we lost contact. I used to call her at Serendah but time flied and I was busy with my college years; assignments. I miss them a lot. Miss the memories together as a gang.  Today, I try to write letter to them, see whether got respond from them or not. Or maybe call them whether they are still living in the same house or shifted. Wonder...

      Last weekends, Saturday night; went to IKEA Damansara Store to buy some stuffs to occupy my small room. &nbsp; I had planned what to buy the stuffs&nbsp;since my boy has promised to go there on that night but I managed to shop only 1 hour before the shop close at 10.00pm.  &nbsp; I wanted to have my dinner at the cafeteria but they had closed by the time we were reaching there. :( &nbsp; Anyway, I was rushing to buy my stuffs and I had spent RM170. I had bought a rug, a rubish-bin, board (to pins notes/thingy) and glass-door wall cabinet. &nbsp; The glass-door wall cabinet cost me RM115 which was the most expensive stuff in the list but I love it so much. &nbsp; Yesterday night I managed to assemble the glass-door wall cabinet since I don't have TV to watch. It was easy to assemble as easy as ABC. But then I need someone to nail to wall to hang this cabinet.  &nbsp; At last, I could display my toys (Bearbricks/Qees/Kubricks) in the cabinet. Lovely!!! &nbsp; p/s: So, boy. When are you free to help me on this? Heee :) &nbsp; &nbsp;  urlLink    Glass-door wall cabinet - JÄRNA&nbsp; urlLink

      Yesterday was great day. My 2nd Aunt (my mum's side) came to my house in the morning to settle the stocks (bracelets) with my mum. I think she came about 11am which I was still lying on the bed. Then mum called me up to ask whether want to join lunch together on Vietnam foods. I quickly got up and meet my aunt.  Then another aunt came (my uncle's wife) to see the bracelets. They were talked and negociated almost more than 2 hours. After that we ahead to have our lunch. My 2nd Aunt called a set lunch for 4-5 paxs which have 6 different kinds of dishes with rice. Marvellous dishes and delicious!  p/s: I forgotten to take the foods' pictures cos I was so hungry and too excited to taste the foods! ;)  &nbsp;  urlLink    Lunch at Restaurant Vietnam Kitchen, Citrus Park, OUG.&nbsp; urlLink

      Last Friday, for no what-so-ever reason I got to treat Michael for a dinner. As he said seem I earned some money from the freelance works should gave him a treat as I was a richer than him. :)  So I let him to decide where to eat but he couln't think of anything, so I just suggested just eat at Dome. We headed to Bangsar Shopping Complex. I called Spicy Spaghetti&nbsp; and Lime drink where else Michael called Fish n Chip (as usual) with Ice Lemon Tea. We called an additional food which for as our starter, Mushroom soup seem Michael was darn hungry. The dinner was great and cost me RM60++.  After dinner, we went to Cold Storage Supermarket to buy my ladies' stuff. There I bumped some Qoo drinks which was I wanted them so much seem is hardly to get them in Malaysia. I bought 3 cans which cost me RM6++. My favourite Qoo! Ahhh....~   urlLink     Dinner at Dome Cafe Bangsar Shopping Complex with Michael.&nbsp; urlLink       urlLink     Qoo drinks.&nbsp; urlLink

      On last Thursday, me and Michael were having dinner with his friends (a couple and 1 guy who was reached almost we finished our dishes) at Esquire Kitchen. We called 5 different type of foods and it was really fulled uptight our stomach.&nbsp;We have a great talk; jokes around and talk about the couple's marriage which they have been planned almost a year ago.  Mostly the dinner was something like a mini reunion for Michael and his best friends as well a celebration of Michael's belated birthday.  &nbsp;  urlLink    Dinner at Esquire Kitchen, Mid Valley Megamall with Michael's friends.&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink      urlLink     It's been away from here quite a while. I was so damn busy working which I met with the deadline for the publishing.  Therefore, not much happening in my life. Life was so unpredictable when it's gonna to be happened in the next day. But my life was simply normal and not much interesting to nourish.  Life was simple with the normal routine like work...eat...sleep. To entertain or to give a leisure in our life, then only have little of activities going on.  But I do cherish my life as what I am. :)
