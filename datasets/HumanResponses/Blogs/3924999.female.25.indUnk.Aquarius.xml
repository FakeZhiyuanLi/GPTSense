      Sorry I've been a little slow creating a post this week.&nbsp; I'm sorry to anyone who comes out here to see my blog.&nbsp; It's been very busy this week!&nbsp; I got asked (for the 1st time) to help my company create a proposal for one of our clients and we've been working non-stop to get it out in only 2 weeks!!!&nbsp; It's probably not very exciting to the rest of you, but for me it's a big step up and will create some good visibility with my managers.  In the rest of the more fun world there is definitely more exciting news.&nbsp; My older brother Mike and his fam just moved into their new apartment in Ft. Worth.&nbsp; I can't wait to see it as well as see their bouncing baby boy whom I hear gets cuter and cuter with each passing day.  My little sister, Abbey, I am told, looks as if she is about to burst and we are anxiously awaiting the birth of her little girl which will be w/in the next month or so!&nbsp; She and her husband are working hard at getting their place ready to welcome the new addition to our family!  My little brother, Stephen, is kicking bootie and taking names at his summer job which finishes up in a few weeks...from what I'm told he will be supporting the rest of us over the next few years ;) J/K!!!&nbsp; Seriously though, he has been doing door-to-door sales and has been in the top of his sales group almost every week!&nbsp; We knew he had the gift of Blarney, but we didn't know he was that slick!&nbsp; GO STEPHEN!!!  Well, that's all from this side of my world let me know what's going on in yours!!!

      It is officially a Monday...and I'm tired, but who isn't tired on a Monday?&nbsp;  &nbsp; Crazy...weekends don't make sense. You get them so you can rest from the past week, but you spend all weekend trying to catch up on the things you didn't get done, and then you get no rest and still have to start the week again on Monday and you are really no better off than you were when you began. &nbsp; This weekend I went to Florida and I was hoping for some R&amp;R, but did it happen...no.&nbsp; I was up before the sun on Saturday morning hoping to do a little diving, but right as the boat was ready to head out the wind kicked up and made the waves too big so no diving!!!! So what did I do...I SLEPT!!! But then I got up and kicked Todd's (my bf) booty at Goofy Golf.&nbsp; Fun Fun...that's the miniature golf where everything moves and you have to get the ball in the windmill or shoot it into a snakes mouth.&nbsp; I should play against Phil Mickelson!&nbsp; I would rock! &nbsp; Saturday night I got to see the stars shine from the beach.&nbsp; It's the most amazing thing to see stars outside of the city...and for some reason more dreamy when you can hear the waves crashing. I think waves make everything more movie like...because whenever you look back and remember it always seems so romantic that you wonder if it was real.&nbsp; I am reminded of a mission trip I took when I was in highschool and our group went and watched the sunset on the beach and listened to the waves and laughed at the sea lions as they played in the surf.&nbsp; Now that I look back it doesn't seem quite real and I find myself questioning if&nbsp;a colorful memory&nbsp;that amazing was true, or if it was my imagination making up a romantic story that I would be able to tell years from now. &nbsp; Sunday, I regressed into my childhood and went&nbsp;to play at the local aquarium.&nbsp; I love watching the dolphins and sea lions do their tricks and balancing acts, but I also feel sad for them as so many of them are born in captivity and never get to play in the ocean (or Gulf) as God intended them to. It was enjoyable all the same...and I got to see the amazing way that pelicans stretch their necks...they almost turn their throats inside out!&nbsp; It was really weird and I wish I could of caught it on camera!! Oh well! &nbsp; But it's like John Mayer says 'Didn't have a camera by my side this time, hoping&nbsp;I would&nbsp;see the world with both my eyes'

      Hey all, &nbsp; I am so glad it's Friday!!!&nbsp; Just a few more hours of work and then I can head out and go to Florida for a little R&amp;R and some sunshine this weekend.&nbsp; No, I'm not going on vacation...I wish! It's just a weekend :( &nbsp; I'm so excited! My roomate and I FINALLY found a good Tex-Mex place to eat here! The best part is that it is just down the road from our apartment!!!!&nbsp; I had soft chicken tacos...and mmmmmmmmm....they were good!!!! &nbsp; So DC is probably the most political place you can be, and trust me the conversations that happen down here are interesting!&nbsp;&nbsp;And there are a lot of people who don't know who to vote for...or even if they are a democrat or republican or and independent.&nbsp; But I found a way to decide.&nbsp; Go to:  urlLink http://www.presidentmatch.com/CompareSelection.jsp2  &nbsp; It will tell you based on what you believe who you should vote for...you will be surprised at the answer!&nbsp; Have fun and have a great weekend!!!

      Hey Everyone!  I'm glad people are contributing to my blog!   So for those of you who don't know my baby sister is pregnant!! Abbey, you should send me another pic so I can post it!!  Her name will be Cadence, but I think my brother Michael and I have decided to call her 'little drum.' :)  It's been a long week. I've been unpacking  (for those that don't know I just moved to Virginia)  and realizing that I am a 'Pack Rat' and I never thought I was.  I think I have a bigger pile for Goodwill than the pile I plan on keeping!!  I mean really what am I going to do with a computer keyboard from 1998...would it even work?  These days, I am in the process of reading 'The Purpose Driven Life' and I've been reading about how to make God smile.  It think it's easier than I thought.  I don't know that I ever even thought he could or does smile! It's a pretty cool mental image though.   I was wondering...how do YOU make God smile???

      What do you think?  My dad is writing out Senators encouraging them to vote in favor of the federal marriage amendment.  What is it?   ---It defines marriage in the U.S. as between one man and one woman which would make gay marriage, polygamy, other group marriages, etc. illegal and protect our culture.

      Do you ever wonder what your life would be like and who you would be with if you had taken a different path in your life?  Like if I had gone to UT instead of Texas Tech...would I still have been in a sorority, would I still have lived in France for a year?  Would I be an obnoxious T-sipper like the rest of my friends?  Would I still be working for BearingPoint, or would I have found another job?  Would I of dated the same men?  Would my outlook on relationships and marriage be any different?  These are questions I'll never answer, but it's always interesting to ponder on them and to speculate what I might of turned out as.  It's amazing how what you choose shapes your life, your outlook and your thoughts.  I pray that I have made the correct decisions and that I am following the path that God has chosen for me.  At the same time, I am proud of my decisions, even some of the bad ones as they have made me who I am today.  I hope all of you are proud of yourselves as well.

      Hey Everyone!  Hope all is well in your world!  I apologize if any of you have emailed me or written comments here and I haven't responded...it's been hetic this past week.  My company is in the process of bidding on some new work and I'm helping to write the proposal!  Doesn't sound like a lot of fun, but it is a good learning experience for me and a chance to hob knob w/ my managers.  I have been working almost non-stop, but I'm hoping that will slow down either this week or next.   I was able to take a little time off this weekend to fly down to Louisville, Kentucky for a wedding. Don't worry ya'll it wasn't mine.  In fact I didn't even know the couple!  So why did I go?  I went so that I could spend some time w/ my long distant boyfriend, Todd.  And in spite of my plane arriving late on Friday, and my having a conference call most of Saturday morning we had a wonderful time!  The wedding was beautiful!  The bride's dress was ivory satin, with purple satin trim.  I was in total envy of her dress...it was to say the least FANTASTIC.  All of her colors were ivory and purple...my kind of girl!!  The reception was in a glassworks factory so there was plenty of beautiful glass and stained windows and many gorgeous vases as centerpieces.  Sunday, we gorged ourselves at the Birthplace of the Cheeseburger...mmmmm...and then proceeded (as if we hadn't had enough) go to the 'best' homeade icecream and pie shop where we drooled on the counters as we decided what to eat!  After that we HAD to go walk all those calories off, so we mosied on down to the Louisville Slugger museum and Aidan have I got some gifts for you!!!!  And, I don't know if all of you have seen the painted cows, or bears or horses that are making their way accross the US downtowns, but in Louisville they had the horses...so we had to go look at the different ones.  Here in D.C. they have the painted bears.  Last but not least, we went to the Science museum where we skipped around like little children and tried our hand at all the interactive science games.  As always, my weekend was too short and I had to come back here to my new home.  If you want to check out my pictures from either this weekend or in general you can go to  urlLink http://photos.yahoo.com/peverett831 .  If you guys haven't met my man yet, I'll be posting a picture right after I post this so be sure to check him out!  He's a handsome man with an amazing personality to match.  Hope everyone has a wonderful week!!
