      I hate change.  Most of it, anyway.  Guess it is hard to appreciate something that rips people away from you in such a harsh manner.  People change...all too often.  Or, people you once knew reveal something new about themselves.  Was that good or bad for us?  I hope it was good...there is more understanding if you know everything.  I hope he thinks he can trust me with himself though.  I am tired of people holding back.    She changed, too.  I don't know where she went, but she isn't the person that I knew 3 months ago....she isn't the person that became my best friend 5 years ago.  Tainted, shattered, broken....and I can't do anything to help it.  She won't even talk to me.  That is all I have to say about that.  It won't change.  Back to my Zerxis.     Change  : I had to leave him in December to come back to this hell hole that others call Alabama.   Bad.    Change  : We said....the thing...with "The Union Forever".   Good?   Took away some innocense that we had, though.  That has a lot of implications.   Change  : He helped me realize a lot about being myself, and that I could trust him, through countless hours of talking on the phone.   Very good.   Strange, how 2 people who met on December 28th could become so quickly determined to stay with each other, and understand very aspect of the personality of the other person.  Interesting.   Change:    He did the impossible and got me a plane ticket, so I went to see him on March 20th.   Extremely Good , I hope.      Change:    I had to leave....    Hell.   I guess something good comes out of everything though.  It is my turn to push him, even though he is a much harder person to learn about that I am.  He still has things to figure out, but I will open to him no matter what.  I wish he would do that same for me.  I keep saying, in my head, that if he loved me like he says he does, he could open up to me...trust me.  He says he does, but "thats just who he is."  It is hard for me to accept....and it will be even harder for me to learn the things that I need to know from such a horrid distance.  He learned a lot about me from this far, why can't I do the same?  I don't doubt, just wonder why he chose me...why he thinks that I am good enough, strong enough, to figure out the things that I need, want, to.  At least someone has faith in me.

      Error 404:  Unable to contact host  In the wonderful words of Marla, "Prepare to evacuate soul."  Don't forget what you left behind.  Never doubt those memories, because they are all you have left to hold on to.  When you hear more than you touch, memory is more important than breathing.  Yes darling, the sky is painted teal with all those wandering dreams.  Don't forget that you chose to leave.  Duty...obligation....those have no reason to overcome passion...love.  So why give in to a common stigma?  Why do "what is the right thing" for the sake of following your heart?  No one will ever know why you do these things, not even yourself.  It isn't because you had to, and it isn't because you wanted to.  So, what  is  it?!  Let that perplex your brain awhile, little one.  The petals slowly wilt from a drooping apple blossom.    But you'll never let it go...how could you?  It is more important than water, dripping in a vast desert where thirst overcomes your body.  Did you know that it is a proven fact that a persons hearing is reduced by 67% when naked?  It's true.  That is why we never heard the tainted words of the horrid crumbling world.  You held me, and we left this hell behind.  Slowly touching, lightly breathing, heartbeats entertwined.  Isn't that what it is all about?  Being close.  Being.....together.    But, there is still the other 33%.  There was still the pain that I was leaving.  Inevitable.  Although, I didn't want to believe it.  I could hear the cries of this nuclear waste calling to me from a distance...faintly, yet they were there.  And with their degrading hands, dragged me back into the pit of endless, lonely, solitude.  Sitting all alone in a pile of rotting dreams, in a dark corner....their hands never releasing...  No regrets?  I will love you no matter what...

      This would have been good.  Great.  About 4 months ago.  I guess it is somewhat girly to whine about this, but...I am still a girl, after all.  A teenage one at that.  So, here it is.  Let's complain about boys, shall we?  It caught me by surprise.  Cleaning out the coffee pot in Cisco, and Micheal is talking to me...like always.  Although, it has been kind of tense since Nicole started telling us how cute we would be together.  That is pretty annoying.  I don't need anyone else...I have Matt.  Maybe, before I met him it would have been different.  Micheal is just a few months too late.  Anyway, he is asked if I was dating anyone.  What am I supposed to say to that?!  I mean, no...not technically...you can't really call it that.  But, with someone?  I don't know!!  What does Matt call it?  He said once, "Why do I need a girlfriend when I have a wife?"  But, he broke up with me in January, if you can even call it that.  We'd only just decided a week before.  And I didn't know him for that long.  But now, it is more serious than that.  Lots more.  But what does he call it?  Am I free to still see other people?  I really don't think that I am, but...he can go out and so anything he wants.  In my head, anyway.  So, I said, "Well...not...well, kinda, but, not really."  That was a pretty beat-around-the-bush answer.  Because I don't want to hurt anyone.  This is just going to make it worse.  So, he asked me to go somewhere with him sometime.  Okay, no problem.  But, I want this to be innocent.  Just, learning out each other, right?  I don't think that he and I would get anywhere because we are so different.  Southern, homophobic, very goal oriented, involved in school activites, brilliant....nothing like me.  Yet, we get along as friends.  It really should stay like that.  So, do I tell Matt?  I could, but he would look down on me.  I just want him.  That is all I want...just Matt.  But, do you have any idea how hard this is?!  Long-distance....and after the shitty conversation we had last night, I wasn't in the best of moods today anyway.    I don't know.  This was a pretty shallow post...but, I needed a coherent rant for once.  I need someone to talk to...  I love you, Zerxis....no matter what happens down here, no one will ever be anything like what you have been to me.  I'll do it to make them happy...to try it out...maybe he'll realize how different we are, and drop it.  I hope.  I mean, he is 2 years older than me, about to go to college, and I still have a year left in high school.  Plus, I am not going to be stuck down here forever.  Forget that.  Play it by ear...

      Rage.  Pent up, utter, absolute rage.  This might seem like unfounded rage to some, but you know what?  I really don't care.  The words that he says DO NOT reflect the actions that he takes.  Once in a blue moon does he say something and act accordingly.  Like, buying the plane ticket for example.  That is a good one.  But...little things.  You can't just do big things in random bursts.  The things that you say need to show in the things that you do.  So, right...go ahead and tell me how badly you don't want me to go this weekend, and how much you want to talk to me before I leave.  THEN, call at ONE A.M. when I'm not home, and you know that I'm not going to be home because I told you when I was leaving, don't leave a message, and don't call back at any other time during the weekend.  Also, don't get online and check your e-mail, because you know that is the other way I would communicate with you if I'm not able to talk on the phone with you.  Oh, you can't?  Your internet isn't hooked up at the new house yet?  FIND A WAY!  If you GAVE A FUCK you would MAKE IT HAPPEN.  I do.  I called you while I was at my dad's...oh yea, but you weren't home.  I e-mailed you....TWO times.  Hell, even when I am out with friends, which is RARELY because you don't like it because night time is the only time we can talk on the phone, I call you, ON THEIR CELL PHONE, to tell you if I am going to be late or something.  I call you when I have friends over.  I do EVERYTHING in my power to let you know that I care.  Why does it always seem that I am the ONLY person to make any sort of attempt?  I mean seriously, if you are taking this the way that you say you are, then why doesn't it seem like you try at all?  Call me one hour later every day, talk to me for one hour less.  We've dwindled down to what...60 minutes now?  90 at most?  Does it affect you at all?  Do you care?  Do you even give a fuck what this is doing to me?  Everything, Matt.  Everything.  You do know that you are that to me, right?  Nothing less?  So WHY do I sit over here and sacrifice myself to someone who can't do the FUCKING SAME!  (Fuck...yea, good word...listening to Slipknot).    So yea, guess what?  You want me?  Come and get me.  I'm tired of making attempts.  I'm tired of throwing myself around, fitting myself to the things that YOU WANT, when you can't do the same.  I appreciate it.    ***  Do you notice a change too?  Ever since I came...do you see the difference?  After the initial effects of my leaving wore off of you, you threw it away.  Tell me how your day went, play by play.  Don't tell me when something is wrong...leave stuff out...hide things from me.  Opening up?  What is that?  It meant nothing to you, did it?  Do I mean that little to you?  If I cam going to sit over here and spill my heart out to you, you are going to have to make an attempt to do the same.  Yes, I am JUST LIKE YOU. I don't just trust people.  I don't just tell them my life, the reasons I am the way I am.  I don't let them know my motivations, my pains, my SELF.  But there is something different with you.  And you should feel the same.  If you say that I am soooo different from everyone else, why do you treat me just like you treat them?  No.  I'm not going to take that.  And no matter how much I love you, I'm not going to live with that.  You can't just expect me to accept the fact that you treat me like I'm not good enough, and move on with us.  You just CAN'T.    So why do you do it?  I just don't understand.  But maybe that is because I don't understand you, right?  Because you won't let me.  Because I am not good enough for you, that you will open up to me.  Tossed around.    Let me live in peace, will you?  I've changed so much so that I could actually open up to you, and yet, you torture with the fact that I can't find out things about you.  Give me little bursts of happiness?  It doesn't work that way.     Rage.  Change.  Deal with it.  "With your feet in the air and your head on the ground.  Try this trick and spin it.  Your head will collapse, but there's nothing in it and you'll ask yourself:  Where is my mind? Where is my mind?....Waaaay out, in the water, see it swimming.  I was swimming in the Caribbean, animals were hiding behind the rocks.  Exept the little fish.  When they told me east is west.  Try to talk to me to me....Where is my mind?  Where is my mind?..."  --The Pixies, Where is my Mind

      Sometimes, it is difficult to sleep.  Sometimes, it is impossible to open my eyes, because I know that no one will be there when I do.  More often than not, I doubt it.  Who knows why.  I feel like a convenience.  That might be part of the problem.  Do everything in my power to ensure that he is happy, but just....don't feel the attempt being made in return.  We lost a lot of innocence.  Do you regret it?  Do you wish we could go back to how it was when we first started this?  Didn't we say that we had "nothing to lose"?  What do you expect of me?  What do I need to do to keep you happy?  Is there any way that I *won't* doubt?  Is there any way that you won't?  When will I stop crying, and live again?  Why isn't this going like we planned?  Where did the bliss go?  Do you feel this too?  What can I do to get it back?  Shouldn't we be working together to fix it?  Isn't communication a 2-way street?  Do you trust me?  Am I *able* to trust you?  Do you give me any reason not to?  Why don't you open up to me?  Do I expect to much of you?  Am I just a conveniece to you?  Are you sure that you love me?  Are you sure that you can handle this forever?  Are you ready to back out yet?    Lose your mind. Fake this faith and cry alone.  Die inside; release the blood. Spill your dreams. Lose your mind. Never live to see your happiness. Boil. Inside you swells continue. Rise above the rim. Give up on your desires; seek revenge. Lose your mind. Forget redemption. No remorse. Slash your fantasies. Echo. Backwards wishes. Plead insanity. Wake up.   Give me one more chance....don't leave me just yet.

      I know I don't belong.  Because when I listen to them talk to each other, I know that they are the Three....and one more person isn't needed it.  It isn't the same without me, because it is better.  And no matter how much the Reunion seemed to matter at the time, they really don't need me there, because it isn't where I belong.  We all know that.  Maybe, maybe there aren't three.  Maybe there are just the two.  But sometimes, it is the two between different people.....and I am only the other half of Two with one person.  Because, what would be the second instance of my Two....we still have our problem.  No matter what was said, it still lingers there.  I'm still trying to decide if Nicole is worth writing about or not.  Someone needs to open that poor girls eyes.  39 days, 6 hours.  And slowly, day by passing day, he is revealing himself.  I just had to stop pushing.  Once I was able to open up the right way, he knew that he could put everything he has in me, because I won't judge him, and I won't give up on him.  If only he could see how much he is going to do with his life, if he would just let me help.  There is still a bit of doubt mixed in the middle, but that might not go away for  a while.  That is just the type of people that we are.  Yet, we fit together...and we'll be perfect for each other.  I don't have any reason to doubt  that .

      Ah, the stress.  Fills my soul like that automatic coffee maker in my kitchen.  Sad analogy, huh?  Well, it is true.  At certain times, it just turns on, and fills up the pot.  And sometimes, it gets really stupid and does it at random times.  Sometimes, depending on how much water, it fills up more than usual.  Hell....I know what I'm talking about...but there isn't much to say about it, because there isn't much that I can do.  A teacher told me that if I had more that "this much stress", he put his arms about a foot and a half apart, then it is my fault.  Well, technically, I did think that I could handle it.  I am a multitasker, afterall, and just trying to be accepted in a world where my kind is looked down upon.  I think I can handle it though.....if there is someone there for me to lean on right now....which I don't doubt.    Maybe it is all of the serious conversations we have had, the realization that something needs to happen, or his striving to make me happy even if he isn't.  Maybe it is just those first two, and I need to stop being a pessimist.  Slowly, I can trust it...and I can open the wa I want to.  It wasn't that long ago that I was so doubtful, so worried.  Sometimes that still surfaces, but things with me and him go so quickly....it is as if the things that have taken place have happened over the course of years as opposed to just a mere almost-4-months.  So, realization comes faster, as does doubt.  But I've been trying.  And getting better I may add.  As has he, to my knowledge.    See, everything right now.  He just comforts me so much.  He is there for me.....and....that is something that no one has really been able to do before.  Eventually, they tire of it, and tell me that I need to stop complaining.  But...he hasn't yet.  It is truely unwavering.  Stable....sometimes ;)  But, perfect all the same.  I have never thought differently about that.  He has always been my perfect little imp.  Ha.  Its just the things that he doubted, not his true self, that got to me sometimes.  But, we all have to things to grow on, right?    Hm, I was thinking about baby names for no reason again.  Morgaine, from The Mists of Avalon, the King Arthur story, Lady of the Lake.....her.  Lovely name.  Later known as Moragn Le Fey, or Morgan of the Faeries.  And since he and I are going to have perfect little faerie babies.... ;)  Ha.  Just, ponder the future with that outlook, and nothing seems so bad right now.  Nothing seems to matter, because we will do the things that we want to do, together.    All in hope...

      Am I total failure?  Must you laugh at my mishaps, as if they are nothing?  I guess so...and if that is how it has to be, then so be it...but I can't promise that I will be able to handle it.    Yes, you are....exultant in everything that you do.  Yes, you are a person of many talents, of many dreams, and you will have many wonderful things come to you.  I know this, because I have to listen to you say how good you are at this and that, and how you excelled at whatever in some point in your life.  And you really don't know how happy I am that you know that you DO have talent.  But...not everyone is as good as that.  Including me.  I don't excel in everything that I do.  In fact, I hardly do good at anything at all.  All the "talents" that I may have...those won't get me anywhere.  Besides, I'm not good at them anyway.      Just...don't treat me like an idiot.  When you laugh at me because I don't know something...all I can do is wonder if you will do that forever, or if at some point you will actually help me learn the things that I am curious about.  I don't know as much about life as I want....I don't know enough about people, about the way things work.  People think I am smart, but only because they don't have anyone to compare it to.  I know, see....I know that you are brilliant.  You far surpass me in many ways.  But...I can't rise up to your level.  I'm not artistic, I'm not good with words.  Academically, I could do much better.  You have all of these talents, but no inspiration to use them.  I have enough inspiration for the both of us, but no talent.  But, if all you can do is condemn me for the things I can't do, then we will never get anywhere.  I won't want to do anything, and I won't have the will to help you.  Do you see how that works?    Isn't there any way that you can accept my flaws with criticizing them?

      It has been a while, eh?  I guess anger seems to override everything else....makes me actually have a reason to write.  Why write about something good, when it will just be overcomed by something hideous anyway?    So, lets check this out.    Priority: 1)Precedence, especially established by order of importance or urgency. 2)Something afforded or deserving prior attention.  Promise: 1)A declaration assuring that one will or will not do something; a vow.   Okay, now that we have got that settled.  Am I a fucking priority?  No, not when it comes to...whatever the hell he was doing today.  Like I care, right?  About what he was doing, no, not particularly, because frankly even if I did, I still wouldn't erase this.  Yeah, a bit unreasonable huh?  Well, a promise is a promise.  Not like that means anything to anyone but me.  See, here is the thing.  I COULD have called later...if I knew that he wanted to go out and do something.  It doesn't bother me, honestly.  As long as I know.  Right?  Right.  So, when I call...oh....30 minutes late (OH NO!), and he isn't home, it is cool because he said he might be a bit late.  Okay.  So, again...mom answers the phone.  Oh, must have gone somewhere with Mike.  Cool...k.  An hour later...nope, still haven't seen him.  An hour later?  What?  No answer?  Oh, well...my level of importance shot down to like...                                                                         here.  If I'm lucky.    So.....here we go...one last call...hold on a sec...  HEY!  STILL NO FUCKING ANSWER!.....2 and a half fucking hours later.  Yes, wow.....second to what now?  His...car?  Or someone elses?  Or even another person, right?  Who cares.  Not like he does.  ***  But....here it goes.  With the worry.  I know I am, because...I don't trust the people that he hangs out with at all.  He could be anywhere right now, doing anything.  He could be laying in a ditch, a hospital bed.  In a million peices on the concrete.  Smashed against a pole somewhere.  Declared dead at the scene.  Anywhere, and I wouldn't know.  Anywhere....and all I can do is sit here...helpless...because I don't know what is going on, and I don't know where he went.  And no one is answering his phone.  And that worries me, because...where could they have gone?  Gotten a call from someone saying that he just got in a horrible accident?  I don't know....and there is nothing that I could do, even if I did.  Because I can't be there.  Because......I have to be here.  Away from the one person that I hold so close to me....  ***  Matt...I love you.  More and more every day.  With everything that you do, I know that you are the one person that I would be truely happy with, forever.  And for always, of course :)  If anything happened to you, I would be so lost....I would be so alone.  Losing the one person who has meant everything to me.  Who I can share everything with, without the fear of being judged.  When I can be me...the true and honest me.  And you can do the same.  Life...it just isn't the same without hearing your voice, touching your hand.  Looking into those eyes that just seem to dance.  And when you smile...there is nothing that I wouldn't give to see that forever.  I can't lose you, love.  I couldn't go on with my life if I knew that something has happened to you.  116 years.  Eternity.  Whichever is longer.  The trinity knot, to me, was the symblance of 2 bodies with one soul.  That is where the power of the three came in.  I know, it didn't make sense to anyone else because I never explained it...but that is what it was.  We are fused in such a way, that nothing could break that.  Not even death.  I would go through anything for you, because I know that in the end...it will just be us.  In the end, you are the only person who will have truely been there.  And that is just something that I could never let go of.  But please, Matt.  Please try to understand.  Try to understand that no matter how angry I seem, that is all fear of losing you.  I get mad when you aren't there because there are so many things that could happen, and I would never know.  No matter what it may seem like at the time, I can almost guaruntee that there is no way that you could mess this up.  If anything, you'll get mad at me for expressed my emotions like I do.  But until that day, if it ever comes, you are the only thing that matters to me.  The only person who I would swim through fire for, and that love will never die.  Right now, at this moment, I am in love with the most wonderful, understanding, caring, creative, sexy,.....perfect person.  Nothing can change that.  Now, I am going to watch Frasier....so maybe tonight you can call me or something.  Not like you are going to read this.  But...either way, I am sending out every thought to you...every ounce of energy, every bit of love...just in hopes that you are safe...

      And so before I go...  Another night.  Five days, and I am off.  To what adventures, what trials, what...ever...may befall in the next two months, I guess only time will tell.  So much has happened in the past...almost 5, it has been.  Amazing what two people can feel in such a short period of time, over such a distance.        Yet, we still have so much to work out.  Tonight, he went somewhere again, and, as usual, I had no idea until I called and his dad told me.  But I can't release my anger how I have been.  That gets old.  Just look at it from a different angle.  It was Movie Night for his English class, and maybe that is extra credit if you go.  And, he needs to get his grade up in that class, so...maybe it will help, right?  I am still mad, of course, because he didn't tell me.  And there is the thought that maybe it ISN'T extra credit, and he is going because he is a dillhole, but...why be angry when I can just call him in about an hour and clarify?  Right...I am going to try to stick to that one.  But, he also needs to start telling me these things.  It gets tiring after a while.    We both get pretty upset and insecure at times.  "You don't love me" and "I'm not important" and "Why would you want to be with me?" are common subjects of conversation.  Sometimes, it is hard for me to believe that someone so like myself could love...well...myself.  And sometimes, I can't believe that I actually DID find someone who is everything.  Who has just enough in common with me that we can do things together, and just enough different that he can expand my horizons.  We have insecurities, that we can work on together, and hopefully through time, we can fix them.  The things that we do, we do together, as a unit.  We are one a lot of the time, and that seems to get rid of a lot of the negative things that I feel.  We have a comfort beyond no other, even though we both get kinda of shy sometimes talking about things, or doing things.  He still gives me butterflies with the slightest things that he says.  Even when I picture...our feet touching that first night.  I still get fluttery.  And the nervousness....it just keeps me remembering the fact that this is still new, still exciting, and we are still learning about each other.  Five days, and something potentially life-changing is going to begin.  Two months with my other half.  I've forgotten what it is to be totally whole, to be fully complete.  The worry seems to melt away with all of the wonderful things that I think about us doing together.  I don't know what to do.  I am so afraid but at the same time, so ecstatic.  I know it sounds cliche, but it just seems as if we have known each other forever.  That everything we have done in our lives have lead us up to the point where are supposed to be together.  We were prepared, even though we weren't looking for each other.  Most of the time, I regret everything I felt towards Dan....all of the falseness that was behind the seemingly-perfect couple.  The love that I no longer felt, but the obligation that I thought I had to do things to keep him happy.  Everything that we said to each other that wasn't honest, and now I am saying things to Matt....wondering if he even believes me, because of my history.  I hope he does, because what I feel for him is such much more extreme that what I ever felt towards Dan.  With Dan, I felt totally obligation, pushed, to do certain things.  With Matt, it just...comes.  It is what it is, because we both want the same things.  We are comfortable, open, and most importantly, in a state of love that is so beyond comprehension that it is nearly unbelievable.  I would give anything so that he could be my first, but I know that it is impossible.  Yet, I learned from everything I did...and know now what the real reason for that is, and how to tell feelings of obligation and love apart.  And now that I know that, I can give myself to Matt wholly...and know that I won't regret it later.  It will be a feeling that he IS my first, because he is the first that I am completely in love with, not just obligated to.  And that is what is important.  So, here I am again.  It is still 5 days until I am leaving.  Going pretty slow.  If I had a clock, I am sure that I would be listening to it tick right about now.  So instead, I will just sit and listen to my thoughts, and in a few minutes, to my Matt hopefully.  And then, I will be listening to him as he stands in front of me...as he talks to me in the car while I try to sleep.  I'll be able to feel his hand on my hand, my face, my hair.  And for two months, the universe while halt while we are finally and blissfully side by side.  Plus, who knows what all can happen?  If we get so far just on 5 months months of phone calls, what will 2 months of real life bring?  I'm looking forward to every minute...

      It is all too amazing, isn't it?  And one would never have thought that just one summer, just 2 months, could bring so much bliss.   Too much has happened to list.  But I guess all that matters is that this was the most amazing experience that I have ever had.  Every moment together is bliss.  And sometimes, there are rocky points, but it is nothing that we can't get through.  We communicate on such an amazing level, that it is sometimes hard to believe that this is real.  But every time I look at my left hand...I realize, it HAS to be true.  Someone right next to me loves me just as much as I love him...and not too long from now, we will be able to spend every day together.  Less than a year :)  Okay well...that may be all for now.  There is so much to say, but no words to portray the thoughts that I need to get out.  Just, picture the largest meadow, the brightest rainbow, the most serene waters....that is where I am.
