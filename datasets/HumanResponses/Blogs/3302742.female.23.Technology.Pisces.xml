      (Where they create desolation, they call it peace)  The world is reeling on this axis of mayhem.   Like a broadway play continuously revived;  the curtain opens, the world is seated Neoteric players extract age old conclusions  ad finitum  and so. on and on;  cause and effect -  effect and cause until  each is indistinguishable  from the last  proverbial. stone for stone;  Eye for Eye -  For Us. Against Us. Collective memory just died.  Vietnam, Korea, Jerusalem, Belfast Falluja, Rafah, Abu Ghraib  rewind.  The past becomes the present The future mere doubt; With each perishing soul  iwantout.

      At the risk of generalising, I have a theory that the world can be split up into two different groups of people.  The police who investigate crime, and the district attorneys who... wait. no, no there I go mixing up real life with  urlLink 'law and order ' again.  As I was saying, two groups.  The first group start every school year/college semester/big meeting/blog  urlLink delire and excira   with the required new-book-smell empty copybooks/refil pad/notebook/first post space, thinking about new starts and how nice and clean and inviting the pages are.  Group 2 on the other hand see how much scribbling/writing/typing they have ahead of them to fill up said pages, and depending on their level of neurosis will feel anything from a general unease to a struck with fear throw-it-out-the-window panic.   Personally, I am as you may have guessed a member of the latter group. (I will leave my level of neurosis for your good selves to measure as you see fit). This is strange, as I'm normally of the  glass half full persuasion.  But I have come to the conclusion that the solitary reason why I'm not a celebrated author of very-intelligent-novels ala  urlLink Monica Ali  is because all the hundreds of blank pages would cause terrible nightmares therefore forcing me to spend all royalties on expensive therapy.  I wonder if there is a name for this phobia? Hmmm.  The fear of paper, ( urlLink Papyrophobia ), doesn't quite cover it.  Well anyway you'll be glad to know I'm working through it.  First by locking myself in the stationary cabinet with all the clean new paper.  This was a step too far, as pointed out to me by my friendly HR representative.  A blog may be more appropriate methinks.  And thus, we are here.

      So I've been thinking a lot about opposing forces and reactions lately.  Not in the literal real life sense, but more the  urlLink yin and yang  sort of idea.  I should point out that I'm not a spiritual person.  I'm not quite the atheist either but that's another story.  Indeed, that statement could actually act as an example of what I mean. See I think everyone contains the seeds of a multiple personality disorder.  Everything we say and do is the result of a battle between the opposite voices inside.  This isn't a new idea, but I really don't mean the opposing strains of 'good and evil'.  For me at least, both voices can be valid depending on the circumstance.  I use this theory to explain why, for instance, I can write something I believe to be genuine one week and see it as sentimental schmalz the next week.  It can also be used to explain my contradictory personality.  I live for lists and order and logic, but I'm also messy and scatterbrained most of the time.  It all depends on which 'voice' is prominent at any particular moment.  It's all about balance - yin and yang as I've said.  Opposite but in tandem.    Jesus.  This is complete armchair psychology.  Don't encourage me.
