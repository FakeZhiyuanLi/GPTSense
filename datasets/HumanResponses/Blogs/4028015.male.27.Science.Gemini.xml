      Well, I finally got to bed last night, but I don't know if I really and honestly slept all that well.&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean it felt like I was sleeping, but I'm not real sure if I really did fall completely asleep.&nbsp; Nevertheless, today is a new day and I'm ready to take it by the horns (so say).&nbsp;  I'm heading to church around 8:30 this morning, and then after that, I think I'll just drive up to Fort Collins and see if Brian and Stephanie are there, if they are, I'll take my money and go.&nbsp; If they aren't there, I'll walk around the mall for a while, and then go and see if they are there.&nbsp;  Should I stop at the Sam's Club there in Fort Collins right beside Brian, or should I go and drive back to Loveland and shop there?&nbsp; I really haven't decided what to do.&nbsp; I think what&nbsp;I will do is pay my membership fee there at Fort Collins, and then drive back to Loveland and shop there.&nbsp; I also have to get some gas, so I think I'll just get that in Loveland too, because if Brian takes his debit card and withdrawls money from Wells Fargos bank there, the banks aren't open at all since it is Sunday and all that mumbo jumbo, he will have to withdrawl it from the ATM and that will mean I will only get 140 instead of the whole 150$ mom and dad gave me.&nbsp; At least by the end of the day today, I will have money for gas, and groceries, that's all I needed, and then by the end of this week, I will definately have a job either at two or one place full time depending on how much money I get for working at these places, but you know me, I will keep you informed on what is going on no matter what. I know for a fact I have to be back tonight before 10p.m. though because Breanna and I have a date on the internet to get to know one another more.&nbsp; God I miss her. Anyway, I'd better go and eat before church, and then I'll be driving to Fort Collins after that, so I won't be seeing you for sometime after that.&nbsp; I would say in the afternoon maybe, but I'm not real sure. Talk to you when I get back.

      I don't know why, but I just can't sleep tonight, for some reason all that is running through my mind is Breanna, and what she is thinking of me and everything like that.&nbsp;  Granted, I turned off my computer, got under the covers, masturbated, (in thought of her) finished, laid on my side tried shutting my eyes, but couldn't sleep.&nbsp; That is when I realized that I'm thinking about Breanna and that's all that I could think of.&nbsp; I can't get her out of my mind.&nbsp; And I don't know why.&nbsp; Maybe because all I can think about is her and how hopefully things between her and I work out.&nbsp;  A little bit about Breanna.&nbsp; She lives in Iowa, she is 25, and she is a flight nurse at a hospital there in Grand Rapids Iowa.&nbsp; She told me tonight, that if there was a position open in Denver she would seriously relocate.&nbsp; She is ready to start a family and she is ready to settle down with the right guy, but she hasn't found that right guy yet, so she hasn't settled down.&nbsp; Breanna has been engaged before, but as far as I know, her fiance died in a car wreck, and (sad to say) that was the end of that.&nbsp; Looks like she moved on and has a good head on those shoulders of hers.&nbsp; She, unlike Tracy, I can seriously see taking home and showing her off to mom and dad.&nbsp; With Tracy, I couldn't.&nbsp; I don't know why, but I just couldn't.&nbsp; There was something there about her I couldn't see mom and dad liking her as much as I can see mom and dad liking Breanna.&nbsp;&nbsp; I just really hope things work out between Breanna and I and things aren't rushed, but it seems like Breanna knows what she wants and she is seriously going to get it sooner than later.&nbsp; So yeah who knows what's going to happen.&nbsp; I wish I did, but I don't so I can't tell you for sure.&nbsp; This is the time I wish I could see into the future and find out what is going to happen. But since I can't, I've got to go with the flow and take life one step at a time. thanks for listening, I hope I can talk to you whenever I want.
