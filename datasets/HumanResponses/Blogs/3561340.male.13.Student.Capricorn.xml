      Recently, I have begun to realize something. A lot of people dislike me, and I dislike even more. However, this really doesnt bother me. So many people in my grade suck. Its not even funny. There are probably less than 15 7th graders at Franklin that I have been friends with for at least 60 percent of the year. And of those people, Im probably only going to stay in touch with about 5 of them. I think I should be much more upset about changing schools then I am. In fact, Im happy about leaving. Mikes going to get recruited soon. Im definitly going to keep hanging out with Ben and Connor. And I dont know who else Im going to stay in touch with. Probably Kelsey. And probably a few people from in 8th and from Union. Lets hope I make some cool friends at Hun. Thats it. Peace

      Yea, that was one of the analogies on my test today. Natuarally, I left it blank, because I did not have any clue what "apostate" means. So, that should give you an idea of what the voacb/analogies section was like. I answered 45 of the 60 questions, but I think most of the ones answered were correct. I think math went really well and the reading part should have been okay. The writing section wasnt too bad, and I got a relatively easy topic: Discoveries are often made by not following directions. Well after the test which took about 3 1/2 hours I came home and got some food. Then onto the Mohawks Festival. It was awesome becuase they had gear for really cheap, but I didnt have any money to buy anything :-( I missed the first 3 games and everyone missed me. Soon, our game started. I hardly played because all the games wree on the same schedule, and there were 4 games going on at one time. I wish I got to play more becuase I was on a reallly good line. O well. Then riding and food and practiced a bit of lacrosse, and now I feel sick. Butt... I dont have to go to school on Monday! Yayyy. Im goin to work with my Daddy in order to make some $$ And I get some more time to work on my social studies essay, which, as of now, is only 2 1/2 pages and only describes up to the first battle. Anyways Hun should send my acceptance/denial letter in about two weeks so Ill let you all know when I get the news and then, presuming I get in, Ill do my end of the year memories/good-byes/criticizations. But, we will all have to wait to figure out where Im going next year. (Keep your fingers crossed that I get into Hun) Thats it. Peace

      Ok. Todays post is in response to the comment from yesterday. If you havent seen it already, it said:  first of all i think u should b mad at urself y did u throw the bagel and i think if u honestly did not push robbie y would heather lie about it?? that makes me question some ppls character and oh yea don't trust lesbians if in fact the group u give that title to is in fact of a homosexual nature other than that this is stupid and i'm the only one who reads it nice line witht he FUCK YOU as beautiful as alissa  Unfourtunatley, I dont kno who made that post, but it is complete bullshit. To answer the first part: By the time Ben, Connor, and I came over, about 12 people had been throwing stuff at Robbie. We joined in. So its not like I was doing anything that no one else was doing. And the reason Heather lied about it was becuase she had kicked Robbie in the area where most men have thier balls. She knew if she helped to cover Robbie that he, in return, would not tell on her. The second part is flat out retarded and everyone knows that I refer to all girls that piss me off as lesbians or dykes. However, Im not using the words in thier literal meaning, and you should be able to realize that by the way they are used in the context. Thats all for today.

      People that I like, such as Alissa, Ben, and Mike, dont pay any attention to the title. Today sucked for me. I didnt do anything. Everyone else got to go outside, but me and Ryan had to sit in Dr Yates's room where it was about 85 degrees and she actually made us sit up and face the front of the room. That was the worst detention I have ever had. An hour sitting up while all my friends are outside. But Mrs Riley said we could go get some of the food and that was pretty good. But it still sucked and it was all because I threw a fucking bagel! And Robbie the faggot didnt get in any trouble. He was the one who attacked me. Fuck this school. Fuck Stubey. Fuck Mrs ALlyn. Fuck Heather. Fuck those other people who said I hit Robbie. And most of all, Fuck Robbie. Fuck it, Im done

      Today is dedicated to Alissa in response to her request yesterday. Even if she didnt ask Id still probably write about her because I really like her. Hope it works out with her, even though shes moving. :-( Well at least I wont be too far away from her when Im at Hun. :-) I dont have enough time to go into detail about Alissa, because there is too many good things for me to say about her. Once again school was gay and absolutely nothing happened, except we have begun our SS essays on US-Mexican War. Then I had my lacrosse game. We won. Damn our team is really good. We were something like 11-3 on the season. I had an assist today. Go Me! I think thats my 3rd on the season. 1 goal and 3 assists so far. Saturday we have our Mohawks festival, which is a bunch of games all in one day. That will be cool. You should come check it out. It will be at Bundt pretty much all day. But.... before the games I get to take the SSAT's:-( thats gunna suck. O well, they shouldnt be too hard, even though Im taking the 8th grade test and have done barely any studying(all I did was 1 practice test and my scores as a 7th grader were better than my brothers as an 8th grader) Hopefully Im not goin to school tomorrow becuase I have no desire to sit in a room with Robbie and John for over an hour. By the way, that suspension was complete bullshit. I swear all I did was throw a bagel. But then a bunch of lesbians went and said that I was the one that pushed Robbie. To any of those lesbians that are reading this all I have to say to you are these two beautiful words(almost as beautiful as Alissa): FUCK YOU.... I could use a few more words but I dont want to offend any virgin eyes. Well thats enough for now. Peace

      Remember that song? Haha. Well in this case Mike is reffering to Michael Nieliwodski who told I had to dedicate todays update to him. Most of you that are reading this probably know Mike so I'm not going to bother telling you about him. All I have to say is that Mike is awesome. I think that really describes him. Hes getting recruited to Hun for basketball because he knows hell miss me too much and because North guys basketball sucks. Anyways today was pretty much exactly like yesterday so there is no need for me to tell you about it. So thats it. Peace

      Well, today was your average boring day at Franklin Township School. Amazingly, the teachers still make us work. Once again the computer lady demonstrated her incompetence in her field of "specialty" being computers and in result, we were forced to turn to Macbeth instead of watching another group's pathetic movie(ours was amazing). However, we did have a nice argument regarding heroes. From the way we argued, one might think that Ben and I actually gave a shit. The rest of the day was normal, meaning it sucked. Naturally there were some funny moments, like when Ben decided to yell, "mononucleosis," resulting in me spitting my drink all over his tray. Now I need your help on this next enigma. Who is more stupid? Connor? or Caitlyn? Our conslusion was that Connor is actually smarter, which is quite astonishing. What ever happened to Connor? He used to be a smart kid. Its amazing how much someone can change in a span of about 2 years. For those of you not from Franklin, who dont understand what makes it so terrible, heres an example. Alissa was sent home today becuase her "shirt was too short." WHAT THE FUCK?!?! So what, a little bit of her stomach might be showing. I dont think anyone is going to be harmed or offended by that in anyway. I didnt get to see her at all because she had to be sent home! :-( Mr. Stubey honestly must be gay. Why would a straight person develop a dress code like the one we currently have? One last thing before I stop. I hate riding. I never really liked it, but Ive been able to put up with it for the past 11 years. Now its gotten to the point i cant stand it. Thankfully my horse is being sold and the other one is getting bred. Finally. Thats it for today, Im out

      Welcome to my blog. I am unable to express such things as my hatred for Franklin Township in my regular info, and Xanga is gay, therefore I chose to make a blog. First off, I want to make it clear, Franklin Township School sucks. As of the day that I am posting this, there are only 11 1/2 days remaining, 1 social studies paper, 1 spanish quiz, 1, maybe 2, math tests, and probably 2 science quizes.  And then I will be done with this place! YAYYYYYY! However, I will miss a few students at Franklin. Not many, but a few. I dont think there is any need to indicate who these people are, because you know if Im gunna miss you on not. Now, to get off the topic of my current school, Ill tell you a little bit about Hun.  The Hun School of Princeton is a private school about 45 minutes away from my house. Assuming I am accepted, which I have every reason to be confident about, I will be a boarder there. However, because of those few people that I will miss, I will be coming home most weekends. On the weekends that I stay at school I will probably go into town and hopefully get to spend some time with Alissa, who is an awesome girl. In the fall I am forced to participate in a sport, and Ill probably just end up working out with the basketball or lacrosse team. My parents wont let me play football, which is really gay, and they are trying to make me do crew instead of lacrosse. THIS WILL NOT HAPPEN! Mark my words, I will be playing lacrosse next year, and not crew. As for the classes Im going to be taking, it will probably be something like this: honors algebra, geometry(yes, 2 math classes), honors English, world history, biology, latin 1, and I will be forced to take a health class. My parents want me to get involved in "The Quill," a student newspaper and since i plan on becoming a lawyer, I will probably join the debate club. In other words, Im going to be doing a shitload of work. Sounds like fun, doesnt it! Alright, thats all for now. Peace

      Well now that Im officially into Hun and what not, its time to share with you all my good byes, memories, and criticism. Here we go.  Ben, Mike, and Connor- You guys are the greatest. Theres no other way to put it. Although the school sucked and so much shit happened, you guys still made it one of the best. All the trouble we got into was definitely worth the punishments. A school without you guys is definitely going to take some time to get used to. Mike and Connor, you guys better win us a championship. Ben, keep the pimpin goin and try not to get expelled. I know thats going to be tough for you. All you naughty Mexicans better not stop talking to me. Enjoy another year at FRANKLIN. haha that sucks.  Kelsey, Jordan, and Lauren- You are probably the only 7th grade girls at Franklin that went through most of the year without hating me. Im sure Ive done or said some mean shit to you guys and I want to apologize for all of it. Stay in touch!   Cody- My role model. Enough said. haha  Shannon, Alissa, Callie, and Morgan- While you all may have hated each other at one point or another, Ive always loved all of you. Dont forget about me  Ali, Kerri, Chelsea, Lindz, Sarah, Jess, MK, and Callie- Wish I met you all earlier. You are all awesome. Stay in touch  Amanda, Kara, Becca- I realize Ive given u reasons to hate me. And although its a bit late, its better than never. I really am sorry.  All the teachers and administrators at Franklin Township School(with a few exceptions)- Some of you thought I was a screw up. All I have to say is that success will be the greatest revenge. So in about 15 years, this "screw up" will have a salary about 10 times what your making.   I cant name any names but there a bunch of you that I hope I never see again. Im not going to waste any more time talkin about you.  Everyone else- Chances are your cool but Im just too lazy to write anything. See you around  Thats it. Peace. Jonny

Anyways so far the summers been pretty good. Lacrosse camp went well, but it was better last year. Florida with Benjamin was awesome, as expected. Other than that my summer has been nice and relaxed. However, this will change when I start my tutoring sessions for algebra 1 and, as much as I hate the thought of it, Im going to need to start running. :-o Now I need sum advice from all of you. Should I give up lacrosse and do crew if... that is the only way my parents will let me play football? Very hard decision for me to try and make alone. Leave comments or just tell me what you think I should do. Peace. Jonny
