       So a couple of weeks ago my friend, P, and I got to go to the Clay Aiken concert. We were really excited. Here we are before the concert, feeling all giddy:          Then after the concert, or course, we went to wait by the buses. We not only caught a glimpse of him, but all of a sudden he was walking towards us on the right, like this:       Everyone was freaking out, and pushing and yelling.       Then he walked closer, and he was right in front of us. I touched his arm, and I remember feeling his arm hair (weird, huh?). P had a mini conversation with him. He said, "thank you" right to her. We were very excited, and this is the great picture I got:        Hey, we're all in there, in some way...

      I'm a dork.  It has been two years.  I can do math and read, exxtremely well.  I should sleep now, since I think I'm supposed to teach a piano lesson in the morning.  It is difficult to teach when you're half asleep.  It can also be quite difficult to pay attention to what little kids are saying when you're not focused, at all.

      It's almost been two years since I set up this blog.  BLOG!  I have written one entry.  Maybe I'll try to remember things I've signed up for...  My name is neonmojo.  Haha!!  I wonder where I came up with that.  I lived with my parents then.  Things are very different now.  Very.

      I, like all other people, often wonder how other people see me. Yesterday at work a lady was telling me about how my boss raved about me to her. How would he know how good of a singer/piano player I am? He's never heard me sing, and only saw me direct and accompany a choir at choir festival last year. I'm pretty sure he's going off the recommendations of a couple of my friends who love me, and therefore think I'm wonderful, apparently. Just for the record, singers hate it when people say, "sing something", and piano players hate it when people say, "play something, and singers/piano players hate it when people say, "sing and play something." All are something that are best in performance, or spontaneously. I'm very bad on demand, in most cases, anyway. Hmmm, that could be very bad.  I smell like mosquito spray, because there were mosquitoes eating me alive, so I sprayed some on. Good story, eh?  I wore my glasses most of today.

      New song obsession   Whisper, whisper, whisper, whisper. I hear the sound of the ticking of clocks, who remembers your face who remembers you when you are gone. I hear the sound of the ticking of clocks, come back and look for me, look for me when I am lost. And just a whisper, whisper, whisper, whisper.    Whisper, Coldplay, Rush of Blood to the Head      It's been in my head a couple of days.

       Tonight=hair dying fun  Before:    After:    The past few months I've been wanting to make my hair darker, since it's been growing out funny the past 2-3 years. Tonight was the night. It's not permanent, though. If I don't ilke it, it'll go back. But I think I like it. Maybe I'll go get it done professionally, eventually. I've always wanted to do that...
