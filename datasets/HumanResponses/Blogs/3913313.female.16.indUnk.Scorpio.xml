       Had the most awesomest night! It started out really sucky, but it got awesome.  HE CALLED ME TO ASK ME TO COME OVER! yes i know! crazy! that made me SO unbelievably happy! I had no clue hed call me and then it happened. I love it. I love him! lots!  I got to hang out with Jessika for a little bit tonight at the ballpark, it was pretty fun for what we had to work with. Got to see Annen for the first time in forever too! I love Annen, shes so awesome. She's one of the people I can have like a blast with and not even worry bout everything or everyone else.  I'm talking to Rachel on yahoo.. I miss her. I'm glad we can still talk and stuff but I hope we can hang out sometime soon. I don't like losing touch with my best friends ..  Welp, off to bed I go. Have to be at KFC in like less than 6 hours. Gnight!

       I'm really bored. I'm getting ready and I have no idea what for.  I guess I'm kinda hopin' that he decides to call or something to possibly see me?? That would make me happy...  I slept in until 3:30 today.  That would probably have to be my record for the summer. woohoo lol.  Enough of that now, it takes up way too much time. And I'm supposed to be at KFC at 8:00 in the morning for some meeting =( suck. Oh well.   I was hoping to hang out with Emily today but I haven't heard from her, so I'm guessing she is probably doing something else by now. If not, well.. I dunno then. I just want to go do something, damnit.

       People suck...  I guess people change. It sucks. I don't like it. But if this is how things are gonna be, I don't wanna even live near him. He sucks. Lets get shit started when there isn't anything to start. Make sense?  I think I am in the lead to be Emilys best friend. I put in my application earlier and things are looking good! haha  I miss Shane. I got to see him last night though, which totally made my freaking day. And he has started to call me which makes me more happy than you'll ever freaking know. Hes awesome. I like him a lot a lot. He makes me smile.. =) lots.  Its like 4:30. Geez, I haven't been up this late for awhile alone.
