       The title basically describes my day. It's been good, tennis was fun, I've played like once in the past month and that was 2 weeks ago and barely played at all this summer and I still hit the ball pretty well. I was moving a lot better than I have in the past, probably cuz of all the conditioning and activities I've been doing. Then I came home and ate some of our homemade pizza, and I must say it's wasn't to shabby, gets better everytime. Then I ate a tun of ice cream... it was so good (and it was fat free and no added sugar so i was aloud to eat as much as i did, atleast in my rules, lol)! Now me and my sis are watchin "Lord of the Rings : Return of the King" good movie but at home I don't have the patients to sit and watch the whole thing straight through, I always get on the computer or start walkin around.   I'm tryin to figure out how to put some of my favorite pictures on this site, I think I've got it but I'll get back to you when I know for sure. GOD BLESS

                                         Wisdom From PlaysWith Squirrels : "Lose one friend, lose all friends, lose yourself." - Boy Meets World         ... I didn't get any sleep last night, I don't know why, I think it might be cuz i drank so much tea that has caffine in it?? I went to bed at like 11pm but then woke up at 1am and couldn't go back to sleep till 5am and woke up at 9am. It's a weekend and I only got 6 hours of sleep... and not good sleep for that matter. Now I have to go play tennis in like 30 minutes and I'm really not up for it. Atleast I don't have vb today.   My sis is making pizza again, hopefully it turns out a little better then last time which might be a challenge since we don't have any sauce... GOD BLESS (you and our pizza)

        Tryouts have gone pretty well so far, besides last night cuz i wuz so tired i don't even know how i made it through. 2 hours in the morning and 2 hours in the evening is a lot of volleyball. Plus I had an optional skills practice I went to this morning for 2 hours. Yesterday morning was fun, when we went out to pepper and warm up the sprinklers went on while a couple of us were outside on the grass and we were running through them and stuff, i love water (speakin of which it's pouring right now) and then we had to go down to the other field to run sprints and when u win a sprint u get to sit down and i was one of the first people to win, i was so happy, but i don't like sitting in the middle of practice so i did lunges and stomach stuff instead. Last night at pracice i was so tired though, i played really bad and was pretty much dead on the court and when i got home i got some ice cream and layed on the couch and didn't move. The only really bad part is that my friend was basically told she didn't have a spot on the team :( which i was really disappointed about and so were a lot of people cuz she's been on our team for the whole year during club and we've spent a lot of time with her. But now I have a break until monday morning, yay. Time to watch some movies, and rest!   My mom just watched "The Butterfly Effect" which is a very good movie (i've seen it before) but depressing and not something i want to watch over again, but it's definetly the type of movie my mom likes. Now I think we're gonna watch "Starsky and Hutch"... last time i watched it and kept falling asleep and waking up cuz i was so tired and i didn't get to see much of it.   Anyways it's all rainy outside today so it's a good day to relax. Only 2 weeks till school starts :(   I'm gonna watch the movie and go online to do more research on my year in europe..lol! GOD BLESS

       So the first morning of tryouts is done, it wuzn't hard at all, our coach decided that we didn't need as much conditioning and he'd rather have us play, which I agree considering during season we don't do any running. So instead of conditioning for the full 2 hours we only conditioned for 30 minutes and the rest of the time we played. We still have varsity tryouts tonight for 2 hours, it should be fun, and then we do the same thing for the next week. On Tuesday we will know the teams, I think. Well that's the news on vball. I found someone who wants to take French 1/2 with me this year... we can be the 2 seniors in a class of entirely freshman, it'll be good. We just have to figure out how we can get into the same class, hopefully it works out. I'm watching BBC America right now, I just like to hear their accents, lol! There are some weird shows on it though. It kinda feels like school should start, I kinda want it to, but the thing is once it starts ur trapped for nine months, yikes... Well that's it for now. GOD BLESS

       OMGosh!!!!!! The "Summerland" season finale wuz so sad!!! When the kids all started crying about their parents... I just started balling! That would be so horrible to lose ur parents, and then see ur syblings in so much pain when ur feeling it too. Please say a prayer for anyone who is going through that painful situation and cherish your own family because they can be taken away so fast.    A  nyways, it was a really good way to end it, to escape all the petty drama and to go back to y the family is a family now. Just had to share that!   Time for bed... tryouts tomorrow mornin! GOD BLESS                    "In all your ways acknowledge him and he shall direct thy paths." - Proverbs 3:6

        I ate so much today. After I went to get my sports physical my dad took me and my sis out to this place called "Dixies" its like a mom and pop cookin place, it wuz so good. Me and my sis split a beef sandwhich (it was huge) and then we all had some cornbread. Then the guy that owns the place (who was really sweet and funny) gave us a taste of "the man" i had litteraly a dab, i mean i could harldly see it and my mouth was on fire! then when we came home i kept snackin, i ate so many pretzels and cereal and kept dippin into the frosting, I don't know what was wrong with me, it's not like i did anything to work up an appetite. Now I feel so gross, not to mention my stomach hurts... luckily I have tryouts tomorrow, that should work it off. I swear I gained like 5lbs!   Other than my eating problem, my day went pretty well... I went to get my physical, apparently I've shrunk and inch, lol I think they miss did my hight cuz last year I was 5'7 and this year I'm 5'6. We had to wait for a while in the waiting room but it wuzn't that bad.   I almost forgot, the season finale of "Summerland" is on tonight at 9, can't wait for that, should be a good one... it's almost time for all the other shows to start back up again, well it's a month away but I'm excited for that even though fall is pretty busy for me and I don't get to watch a lot of tv which is probably a good thing. Welp thats about it. Hope everyone is doin good! GOD BLESS

       So I am watchin Regis and Kelly with my mom right now. Me and my mom have spent a lot of time together the last couple days, it's cool especially since I haven't seen her all summer since she's been in Montana with her dad who died a couple weeks ago. Scott Bayo is on the show right now advertising his new movie "Baby Geniuses 2", I really want to see it, the first one was so funny. Speaking of movies I watched "The Count of Monte Cristo" last night, it was really good, I had never seen it but it's my best friend from Massachusettes's book. Afterwards I realized I hadn't left the house or done pretty much any excercise so I did jump rope for about 20 minutes, some pullups and then different stomach exercises for about 30 minutes. I felt a lot better afterwards! Tryouts start tomorrow...I have to go get my physical today, I hate waiting in the waiting room, it always takes 4ever! Did I mention this year my sister is trying out with me, gosh I've been with her all summer, sometimes she gets on my last nerve, I hope they seperate the freshman so I don't have to be around her every day since I've already been around her everyday all summer! Oh well, Life is good. GOD BLESS

        Well it's been a relaxing day. Watched some movies that were set in Europe, "Bourne Identity" very good, and "Under the Tuscan Sun" also a great movie and I had never seen it before. My mom, sis and I made a pizza... it wuz actually decent, we messed it up a little cuz we didn't let the dough rise with the yeast, we weren't patient enough. Now I'm watching "Me Myself and I" which is also a British movie, it's ok. I got some more pictures from France and Ireland to add to my screen saver thing. I told you I'm obsessed.. I get like that, which is definetly a good reason never to drink or do drugs, I have way to much of an addictive personality besides the fact that alcoholism runs in my family like crazy.   Only 1 more day till tryouts... goody goody. I'm kinda just ready for school to start, I had the couple weeks leading up to it, they r kinda weird cuz summer's not over yet but u feel like schools already starting. Speaking of school I'm thinking of going from my lazy schedule with 2 periods off to a full one. I'm taking all the easy classes so I wanted to try and pick up first year french to help me out when I go to Europe (hopefully!) next year and then also advanced photography because it's fun. It'll be tough to manage all that stuff during vball, but it'll keep me busy during the winter and it'll be things I'm interested in. Anyways, maybe I'll do it maybe not.   I should probably get out and get some exercise.. although once tryouts come I'll be gettin plenty of that and have been all summer for the most part. Maybe I go for a run or see if my dad wants to play tennis. GOD BLESS

        So I finally got around to making this scrapbook of when I was little. It looks pretty good so far, I'm excited, but it only has 4 pages so far... it might take a while. I'll probably work on it later tonight. Hopefully I'm gonna go play tennis today since I did nothing yesterday (not excercise anyways... very unlike myself). I found this really cool website though that you can basically take a tour of Europe on and I used a bunch of my favorite pictures to make a screen saver   urlLink  http://www.concierge.com/destination/europe         Anyways I'm still waiting for people to contact me about being an au pair next year... I check constantly even though it probably won't be for a while since it's a whole year a way an most people don't seem to be looking yet for that time period. I really hope it works out, I'm obsessed right now, but I usually get like that about stuff.    I'm gonna get going, I hope it's sunny and warm today so I can go to the lake and play some tennis outside, maybe beach vball too. GOD BLESS

        This summer has been awsome for the most part. I've been doin volleyball and conditioning when I am home which is hard work but fun, I love spending time with my team. I went to California for 2 weeks to spend time with my Poppa and Gomma and then saw my friends that I hadn't seen since freshman year. I also went to hawaii for 10 days with my sister (15), cuz (17), and grammy which wuz a blast and very relaxing. I've been home for about a week and it's been back to vball and tryouts start on Wednesday...can't wait till those r over, the mornings are all conditioning and the afternoons are fun cuz we actually get to play but it's a lot of pressure cuz ur bein judged the whole time. Once the season starts it's all good, lookin forward to my senior year. Speakin of senior year, I got my class schedule. I don't really like my off periods so I'm gonna try to change those and maybe if I can stop bein so lazy I'll pick up advanced photography since I really like it but it's a lot of work. I also wuz looking at more ways to volunteer even though it's hard to schedule that with tennis and volleyball always goin on. And I wuz thinkin of tryin to be a youth soccer ref to make a little money, i sounds like fun, and weekends are the perfect time since most of my sports stuff is on weekdays. Busy Busy Busy... Lets see wut happens w/ all that.   I am watchin "Hook" on ABC Family right now. Such a good show, Robin Williams is awesome. Plus I luv that part of it is set in England. I'm obsessed w/ everything to do w/ Europe right now. I just made my screen saver a bunch of pics of different places in Europe like England, Austria, Switzerland, Greece, Italy (my fav. Venice), Germany, Belgium, etc. I've never even been to Europe but my plan is to take a year off before college and Au Pair somewhere in Europe (wherever I can find a job) and then backpack for like a month afterwards and explore...then I will head to college and study either kinsiology, nutrition, history or international relations, but who really knows wut I'll want to study by then, I'm so wishy washy on everything right now. Anyways, I'm gonna get back to watching "Hook". GOD BLESS ~ash         "Delight in thyself and also in the Lord, and he shall give you the desires of thine heart." - Psalms 37:4
