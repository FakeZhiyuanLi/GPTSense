						   This happened to my friend Paul...  Guess what cats?  Something crazy to add to 'Paul just won't die' (knock on wood).  Some punk-ass crackhead or whatever tried to car jack me during the paper route early this morning around 420.  I had my foot on the brake and was checking the address of a cancelled paper i knew i had coming up in these apartments, and i had the dome light on so i didn't even see him coming or know he was there until the bastard had punched me in the face and was grabbing my steering wheel and was yelling at me to get out of the car.  It was crazy....it happened fast and in all honestly, i'm glad i'm passive-aggressive.  Cuz when that punk grabbed my steering wheel, i locked my hand on his, slammed on the gas, and dragged his ass into the middle of the next road before i let go, sending him rolling.  Then i just took off.  So yeah, i put in my leave to quit that job cuz they certainly don't pay me enough.  Moral of the story is, crackheads suck, be careful at night always and for the love of god, drag 'em, run over 'em and damn them.  But yeah, i'm straight except for a welt on my face and some bad mojo.  Y'all take care...jeez...did i just type 'y'all'??  The south's gettin' to me....

						   Noah- Here are a couple of links for you. I just thought this would be a kind of neat way for us all to keep in touch. It stays archived, so you can always go back and read what has happened. I have also met some really interesting people over it. Explore some- it's a lot more fun than dragging crackheads down the street with your car... P.S. If you want to invite anyone to be a member let me know and I will put them on the list.
