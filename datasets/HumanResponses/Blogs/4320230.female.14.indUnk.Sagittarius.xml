      she knows its  over  and according to her  memory  this is the  worst december  she's had to go through. she walks between the  palmtrees and powerlines  late that night  counting  the  stars  she passes. she hears a truck he sees her, and pulls over and sees if she wants a ride. she gets in trying to keep her  head up  but he knows   she's   been  crying  and he asked whats your  destination  the only word she could say was  " anywhere " he says fine then  back to california  it is, as the words reach her ears    the blade    falls from her fist"im not going back it doesnt matter  what you say  she reaches for the door but its too late he's got her by the arm and tells her she wont  sign off  this ride now as the  champgnae  is forced down, the darkness falls.....(the     blue italic    words make one title but the rest follows as normal)

      when life was  breaking benjamin  and he felt  so cold  after pushing everything  away  he tried to  believe  in his fathers words" sooner or later  we all want to  breakdown  and just  forget  about life and everything in  it ." as ben watched the  rain  he saw the  firefly  in the distance and started thinking  we are not alone  in this  simple  world with its complex  design . "someday i'll find that someone to  break my fall  and hold me close,someday i will find my somebody" he thought to himself as he strolled the street, destiny was calling and he knew he must  follow.

      she looked though the house in the open air, flicked on  the light and  there lay  the glass  next to the head of her lover. she knew now she had reached the  backend of forever  and this  blood red summer  was too much to handle, but then it happend she heard  the   evil   crowing  of  al the killer . she'd had enough this house was full of memories and the  three evils emobodied in love and shadow .  the cuts  marked deep  in  her skin made her think of  the march  when the house was full  of men , but it was just  a favor house  in the great  atlantic . this was  the ring in return  the moment she had waited for, this  faint of hearts  makes it hard for one  in  the job of  keeping  the  secrets of  this  silent earth , and she new this would be the last time she would morn. (please tell me ur gettin the pattern song titles in  green  and  purple  blah blah blah)

       Standing in the shower thinking   ted  realized he  just  had to  admitt it , and show his  true nature . he thinks to himself so this is the  price i pay  for being a  superhero . yes its true that everyone will  suffer some  and he cant be  everybody's friend , theres  nothing shocking  about that, no not at all. so he decides to go  up the beach  to the bar but this time he had met the  wrong girl . she controlls all the men wats  janes addiction  you ask? well no one knows for sure she mostly keeps to herself and says that  idiots rule  but to them  the riches  she has are enough  to match the sun .  jane says  just because your not  ocean size  doesnt mean u have to settle fot the  mountain song . for jane the  summer time rolls  at a  hypersonic  pace. she knows she dont have to look'em in the eyes and say  thank you boys , she  had a dad  once thats when she made up her mind that men are no better then  pigs in zen  just a bunch of  strays.   (song titles are writen in  green  and  purple  band name in  red )
