      After watching  Braveheart  again for the first time in a long time, I've come to enjoy the film less than I originally did. But, you gotta love that gore. So now, I bring you a list of the goriest movies ever made (not including horror films, because that's just not fair).    Kill Bill, Vol. 1  (2003) - The first half of&nbsp;Quentin Tarantino's&nbsp;story about a woman who avenges the death of her fiance and unborn child, going after the group of assassins responsible. Although I'd like to point out the famous massive sword fight between The Bride (Uma Thurman) and the Japanese gang the Crazy 88's, there's other noteable scenes. For instance, a hospital bit in which the Bride bits off a man's lip, then beats another to death with a door. Or an anime sequence colored mostly in red. Or seeing O-Ren&nbsp;(Lucy Liu) cut a man's head off for an insult, and seeing blood shoot out of his body for some ten seconds. Or seeing the Bride scalp O-Ren in battle. Or...ah, you get the point.   Casino  (1995) - Perhaps it doesn't go under the category "gorey," but this film is most definitely violent. In fact, it's probably the most violent gangster picture I've ever seen. Sonny getting shot at the turnpike, the end of  Scarface , and even Moe Green getting a bullet in the eye don't come close to the level of cringe that Martin Scorsese established when he put a man in a vice, hammered a cheating man's hands, and ordered Joe Pesci's character to be beated with a baseball bat, then buried alive.   Saving Private Ryan  (1998) - An infamously violent film, the World War II plot has eight G.I.s crossing occupied France after D-Day to save a newly brotherless soldier, as well as spawn an annoying new genre that just won't die. Audiences were shocked, of course, by the first twenty-some minutes, a recreation of the invasion of Omaha Beach. Sure, gory as Hell, but what got me was the battle for the fictional French village near the end of the film. Seeing a man looking for his arm and legs flying off, in my opinion, is chicken feed compared to seeing guys getting blown up, literally, by a cannon and their own sticky bombs. Not to mention the most excruciating stabbing scene in movie history. Spielberg's gone a long way since  E.T. .   Black Hawk Down  (2001) - Somewhat of a sequel to  Private Ryan  (director Ridley Scott actually admits to being influenced by it), the film is a recreation of the 1993 battle&nbsp;of Mogadishu, Somalia. Although the violence isn't in as much excess as the previous films on the list, when it happens, it happens hard. One scene has a soldier picking up another soldier's hand, and  sticking it in his pocket , as well as another soldier's finger getting *almost* blown off, leaving it to dangle around.   The Passion of the Christ  (2004) - Okay, this is an easy one, I'll admit. But come on, it was gory. Almost unbearably so. As Mike, the invisible contributor to this blog, says, "The violence in The Passion of the Christ may be accurate to what occured, but it is also sickening, sadistic, and overshadows any message the film tries to tell us. Instead of focusing on the life of Christ, we're dwelling on his violent death, which really doesn't move me. The violence completely disgusted me, and I got nothing out of the viewing but illness." Indeed, the day before Jesus' crucifixion were obviously violent. But damn, Mel...   The Silence of the Lambs  and  Hannibal  (1991/2001) - Wow, Ridley Scott manages to make two incredibly violent films in one year. I don't even really need to get into this one. If you can't figure out why two movies about a serial cannibal, much less one that eats living people's brains, didn't make the list, then I don't know you. (By the way, I do not consider the Hannibal Lecter films to be "horror," per se, hence their inclusion on the list)  And finally,  Braveheart  (1995) - The battle scenes, unlike those in  Private Ryan  or  Black Hawk , were more hand-to-hand...or sword-to-head. Different attacks by the Scottish and British alike include: beheadings, be...handings, arrows in the ass, a sword through the crotch, and men getting their heads hammered in. Yes, the Scots used hammers, apparently. That's not all, either. Slit throats, more head breaking (with a ball this time), and a torture scene (although it doesn't hold a candle to  Passion 's) as a climax.   Well, hopefully I made you want to run out and rent these movies. That's all for now.

      I had the absolute pleasure of viewing 1972's  Superfly  tonight, from a free screener my father gave me. Boy oh boy. This movie's funnier than  Tootsie . So, as I was watching, I decided to make a  Superfly  commentary for all you one readers out there.  The movie starts out the ghetto of New York City. Two evil, black druggies are lurking the streets, looking for more cocaine. Those bastards. Then, we see....a black man with a mullet and a goatee. He had this white bitch in bed with him, and looked like a black version of Kirk's arch-nemesis Khan. 'Ah,' I thought, 'this must be Superfly.' But what kind of a hero snorts coke from a cross? This shows a blatant disrespect the black community has for the Catholic Church. What fuckheads. But it's ok, this is Superfly. Anyway, he leaves his white bitch to go make a deal. To get to that deal, he gets in his pimpin' ride. I'm not a car person, but I don't think you need to be to admit, " Damn, nigga! " I'd also like to point out that every time he drives this car, we hear the same theme music (me spelling it out won't do it justice), and get random close-ups of the headlights. So anyway, Superfly, the pimp that he is, gets to this deal...only to be attacked by DRUGGIES! With bed-posts! Those crazy niggas tricked him!&nbsp;They get the best of him...briefly. Superfly quickly KICKS one in the side and chases after the other one through alleyways and other generic New York settings. This really got me going. I couldn't help but get up off of my couch and shout, "Get him, Superfly! Get him, drug dealer!" Finally, the druggie takes a long time to get up a fence, something Superfly uses his super fly powers to simply  jump  over. But the tables are turned when it comes to that dastardly ladder. But Superfly gets that nigga down, and his money back. Thank God.  From that point, Superfly is met by two guys in his house. He yells at the one that just so happens to be that one other black guy from  Blazing Saddles , named Fat Freddy. So, for some reason or another, Superfly goes to his friends, doing something or other with money and talking in a way so that I can't understand them. One of his friends asks him how he's doin, to which Fly says, "I'm cool." But his friend  knows better . In the mean time, some other dude makes a comment that Fly looks white - which he does - to which Superfly super-socks him! Take  that ,&nbsp;punk-ass nigga! Later on, Superfly tells his buddy that he wants out of the cocaine business. Is he  CRAZY?  He's got an 8-Track stereo, a color TV in every room! It's the American dream! But he's got a  plan . He's gonna do somethin' or other and get a lot of money. Bullshit, that crazy nigga! But  shit ! He's gonna kill someone if he don't get out!  At this point, I got bored and had a lunch meat intermission.  Then BAM, I come back, and some black dude's robbing some white dude. Hey! Is that Fat Freddy? I think it is... I almost couldn't tell under that pantyhose.&nbsp;During this robbery, that white dude gives him jive, and Freddy says, "I don't wanna rap!" I thought to myself, 'That's strange.'  Anyway, we got another close up of Superfly's pimpin' ride for some reason, then we see him at a club. He must have gone to the club in his pimpin' ride. Inside this dark, mysterious, and sinister club, there's a bunch of black people watching Curtis Mayfield performing "Pusherman." I think that song is just purely subliminal. Somehow Mayfield is trying to convince us that he's our mama, daddy,  and  the pusher in the alley. Hmm... He also goes on to sing about having the best bitches in bed and swimming by performing sexual intercourse. You learn something new everyday. Hey! Is that a white guy in the crowd???? Shit, this ruins the whole movie for me. Then...a bitch fight breaks out, and I'm back in. Those crazy bitch-niggas. Anyway, at this point, Superfly, his buddy, and some chef guy go into the kitchen in the back. Superfly asks the chef if he wants any blow. I covered my eyes for awhile. I didn't want to see that. When I eventually opened them up, I was greeted by more incoherant speaking, and the chef pointing a gun at Superfly's buddy! It dawned on me, that this is no ordinary chef...  Will Superfly save his friend from the killer, gun-toting chef? Will Fat Freddy realize that he truly does want to rap? Will any of these crazy niggas ever understand that drugs are bad? Tune in tomorrow for part two...

      I watched  Sunset Boulevard  last night as my further christening (next wave will be  Easy Rider  and  Streetcar Named Desire , if all things go as planned), and my reaction was the polar opposite of that which I had toward  Tootsie . In fact, on IMDb, I easily gave  Sunset  a 10 out of 10. It's one the best movies I have ever laid eyes on.  Another object of interest is my viewing of  Barton Fink , the climax in my crusade to see each and every one of the Coen brothers' films. So, as a result, here are my reviews for each one:  Blood Simple  (1984) - Definitely the most underplayed of all their work, and for obvious reasons: The film was made for a budget that wouldn't even buy my car. None the less, it's&nbsp;a great and chilling film that's fun for the whole family. Sort of.  Raising Arizona  (1987) - Okay, I'll give this much to you: It was original. A couple made up of an ex-con husband and a barren wife kidnapping one-fifth of local quintuplets is not something that's been done in Hollywood before, by any means. But the end doesn't jive with the rest of the film at all. On one hand, you have a very dark comedy involving prison escapees, baby-kidnapping, a&nbsp;Pollack joke-spewing redneck,&nbsp;and a motorcycle hitman that kills innocent bunnies, and one the other, a happy ending with values of family. God-damn.  Miller's Crossing  (1990) - My personal favorite of all the Coens' films. Maybe it's my tendency toward gangster pictures, but this was something different. As the trailer and the film's tagline both state, "No one is who they seem at Miller's Crossing." The same goes for the genre. The script, characters, acting, directing, everything works so well. Crap, this is the worst review ever.  Barton Fink  (1991) - Slow-moving and overly-cerebral at times,  Fink  falls under a similar category as  Sunset Boulevard  or  The Player , an expose on the ups and downs of creating for Hollywood. Being a writer myself, I can understand Fink's struggles in writing a bankable wrestling picture for a WWII-era Hollywood. However, I could never connect with his character. That's telling you something.  The Hudsucker Proxy  (1994) - Maybe I just like the Coens' "bad" movies. With the exception of  Miller's , my other favorites are  O Brother  (which received an F from Entertainment Weekly),  Ladykillers  (underrated by everyone), and this. You might also find it strange that I bitch about  Arizona 's feel-good ending, and yet I praise this film. In fact, this is  Arizona 's ending expanded into nearly two hours - a Frank Capra-esque movie about the corporate world. But I loved every minute of it, from Jennifer Jason Leigh's Lois Lane-like dialect to the dim-witted look Robbins gives throughout the whole running time. To all those who haven't, see this movie.  Fargo  (1996) - I love  Fargo . And everything good that can be said about it, all ready has been said. So I'll move on.  The Big Lebowski  (1998) - This is the most Coen brothers-y Coen brothers film there is. A stoner mistaken for a millionaire, a gun-toting Vietnam vet, a pedophile Hispanic, a psychotic art freak/sex maniac, Gen-X German gangsters with deadly ferrets, a missing porn star, a mysterious cowboy, and a bowling alley. Absolutely brilliant.  O Brother, Where Art Thou?  (2000) - Okay, in this day and age, if you haven't seen this film, you're a square. Just being honest. I know I'm beginning to sound like a broken record, but this movie is just incredible. Only the Coen brothers could turn Homer's epic poem  The Odyssey  into a Depression-based musical comedy with George Clooney.  The Man Who Wasn't There  (2001) - I saw this movie a long time ago, so don't trust my instincts to the bare bone (not that you would anyway). But I remember liking it. What especially stood out then was the stylistic, film noir direction, and the performances.  Intolerable Cruelty  (2003) - This was on the brothers' lowest-grossing movies, and for once I can understand. While the people I talk to seem to have loved it, I felt the opposite. For once, I was actually ashamed of them. Sure, they came up with an original plot, but (and this happens rarely) it actually  hurt  the movie. Everything's so packed up and snappy, and there really is no flow to the plot at all. Easily the worst of the Coens' films.  The Ladykillers  (2004) - Some people have instantly bashed this remake because of its overly-striking resemblance to the original, starring Sir Alec Guinness and Peter Sellers. But, I haven't seen that, so I guess I can't share that criticism. Instead, I enjoyed this film. In fact, I enjoyed it very much. It was on my Top Ten list last year. All the best Coen qualities stand out here: screenplay, stylish directing, acting. Or maybe I'm just a sucker for dark endings.  Anyway, that's my post for the day.

      Ok, the AFI lists just bug the hell out of me. I was looking over their "100 Years, 100 Stars" list while making the post below, and what do you know? I found another reason to vent.  First off, the list, although clearly stating "100 Stars," only has  fifty names  on it. Apparently they have just as hard a time of counting as they do determing the difference between a hero and a villain.  But here's what really got me. I'm sick... sick ...of not having any legendary actors in our generation. Now, I'm the first to admit the greatness of Bogart, Grant, Peck, Brando, Hepburn (either one!), but come  on!  Where's De Niro, Pacino, Newman, Redford, Hanks, Cruise, Hoffman...Roberts, Streep, Foster...where the hell are they? You've got Robert "Mr. Supporting Actor in Everything" Mitchum (great actor, none the less)&nbsp;at #23, but not a  single actor&nbsp;or actress &nbsp;who started working in, say, 1970 in there. I'll also be the first to admit that the good movie started to become extinct around 1985. But that doesn't mean there weren't great actors. Hell, that's not even the list. The list is  stars . As in, Tom Cruise, Tom Hanks, Julia Roberts, Mel Gibson - the most bankable actors in movie history, even if they lived in the 1940s. They're also some of the most well-known faces in the world, and will be for a very, very long time.  They didn't just make movies in&nbsp;the '30s through '60s, you know. Fucking AFI.&nbsp;Maybe I'm just fed up with this cheesy nostalgia crap.

      Earlier this week&nbsp;I lost my virginity in terms of viewing  On the Waterfront  and  Network . I guess I'm going back and watching classics that I've never seen before. Well, I saw another classic, even though it's more contemporary, that I've also never seen before: 1982's cross-dressing classic  Tootsie , starring Dustin Hoffman as Michael Dorsey/Dorothy Michaels. I guess I was expecting something that lives up to the Number Two slot on the AFI's 100 Years, 100 Laughs list. However, it instead reminded me why I have a tendency not to like the AFI lists.   But anyway, I had an idea. Instead of explaining where I got the idea, I'll just cut to the chase: Here are, according to Ian, the ten most overrated films ever made (in no particular order):    Shakespeare in Love  (1998) - You might just think I'm still bitter about this winning the Best Picture over  Saving Private Ryan , something I very well might be. But, in English class earlier this year, we watched this film as part of the Shakespeare lesson we were having, and I nearly cringed. Unlike the other films on this list, I simply don't like this film. But hey, whatever floats everyone else's boats. (Oscars: Best Picture, Actress, Supp. Actress, Original Screenplay, Art Direction, Costume Design, and Original Comedy Score; AFI's 100 Years, 100 Passions: #50)   Chariots of Fire  (1981) - Great theme song, but better than  Raiders '? Bullshit. But that's not why this movie's on the list. Like most the movies on this list, I actually liked  Chariots . However, and this is not usually a complaint of mine, I found it painfully boring and slow. By the time it was done, I had the feeling it was ultimately irrelevant.&nbsp;(Oscars: Best Picture, Original Screenplay, Costume Design, and Original Score)   The Silence of the Lambs  (1991) - A lot of people are going to see to it that I'm assassinated for this one, but I fail to see why it's such a cherished film. Yes, Anthony Hopkins gave a great performance. Yes, Jodie Foster's the perfect Clarice. Yes, it's got a great screenplay and is shiveringly frightening. But....BEST PICTURE? BEST PICTURE???  BEST PICTURE???  Okay, again, I might be bitter about it beating out  JFK  (one of my favorite films), but... BEST FUCKING PICTURE???  What the hell... (Oscars: Best Picture (!), Director, Actor, Actress, and Adapted Screenplay; AFI's 100 Years, 100 Movies: #65, 100 Thrills: #5, 100 Villains: #1)   Arthur  (1981) - Don't get me wrong. I'm a Dudley Moore fan.  10  is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. Too bad I can't give this a ten. Despite Moore's style of comedy, I found myself silent throughout this film. Hit that shit, Blake Edwards! (Oscars: Best Supp. Actor and Original Song; AFI's 100 Years, 100 Laughs: #53, 100 Songs: #79)   Gandhi  (1982) - Yes, my vendetta against Best Picture winners continues. I guess I watched this film expecting David Lean, or, well, a Best Picture winner. Alas, what I got was nothing but a uneven History Channel documentary with an overrated performance by Ben Kingsley (don't kill me, but all he did was dip himself in brown paint, look wide-eyed, and talk with an Indian accent). (Oscars: Best Picture, Director, Actor, Original Screenplay, Film Editing, Cinematography, Art Direction, and Costume Design; AFI's 100 Years, 100 Heroes: #21)   Titanic  (1997) - An easy target, I admit. But one has to admit that the only reasons this&nbsp;won Best Picture was because of its...titanic...ticket returns and lukewarm reviews. Think about it - it's one of the only Best Picture winners to not be nominated for any writing awards.&nbsp;(Oscars: Best Picture, Director, Film Editing, Cinematography, Art Direction, Costume Design, Sound, Sound Editing, Visual Effects, Original Score, Original Song; AFI's 100 Years, 100 Passions: #37, 100 Thrills: #25, 100 Songs: #15)   Spider-Man  and  Spider-Man  2 (2002-04) - Shit dialogue. Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit. What looks good in a comic book does not always sound good coming out of a real human's mouth. Now, you must understand that I'm a comic book aficionado (compared to most people). But I did not dislike this film because it wasn't loyal to those comics. In fact, it was very loyal. But if I want to see Spider-Man battling a green Power Ranger or a fat guy with mechanical arms, all of which talk just like a comic book, then I'll talk my little brother into playing with his Crayons.   The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King  (2003) - Okay, don't get me wrong. I like the Lord of the Rings films, I really do.  The Fellowship of the Ring  was one of the best adventure films I've ever seen. But  RotK  is not. Again, this is not a normal complaint of mine. But this movie dragged  ooooooon  and  oooooooon , as was, in my opinion, the worst of the trilogy by far. I don't give a shit if that's how the&nbsp;book was. I don't give a shit if they just gave it the Oscar because the other two lost. I did not enjoy this film, at least not enough to keep it off this list. (Oscars: Best Picture, Director, Adapted Screenplay, Film Editing, Art Direction, Costume Design, Makeup, Sound, Visual Effects, Original Score, and Original Song)  And, finally,  Tootsie  and  Mrs. Doubtfire  - I'm going to refrain from making any sexist remarks or complain about their relation to  Some Like it Hot . In fact, I'll admit,  Tootsie  was original and funny at times. Dustin Hoffman's performance was great to the point where I forgot it was him at times. But a performance never saved a film from being generic, predictable, and overly sappy. Again, I enjoyed this film, but the amount of accolades it received at the time is just ridiculous. Now, that's bad enough without a complete rip-off,  Mrs. Doubtfire , which enlarges those faults, getting just as much praise, as well as more money. BAH! BAH I SAY! ( Tootsie  Oscars: Best Supp. Actress; AFI's 100 Years, 100 Movies: #62, 100 Laughs: #2/ Doubtfire : AFI's 100 Years, 100 Laughs: #67)   Well, there ya go. Another giant post that I've slaved over for more than an hour that no one will read. Enjoy!

      This was surely a memorable week in movies for me. I might start off by stating that I saw both  On the Waterfront  and  Network  for the first time only last night (well, two nights ago, considering it's 3:10 in the morning as I write this). I could quickly understand why both were classics, but I couldn't understand why I had never seen them before. Some would consider this on par with losing virginity.  A next article of interest is George Lucas' announcing of the title for the third Star Wars episode. I'm sure you've heard. It's  Revenge of the Sith . That's right:  Star Wars, Episode III: Revenge of the Sith.  I agree with the majority of my fellow Star Wars nerds in thinking this is a great title. I was also one of the few who thought  Attack of the Clones  was a masterstroke of a title (couldn't say the same for the film itself, of course), as well as  The Phantom Menace  (ditto). These movies were meant to be science-fiction fantasies in the same ballpark as  Flash Gordon . They're not meant to be masterpieces, but escapist adventure films. Giving them cheesy, dynamic titles fits the purpose perfectly. Not to mention, the title goes with the trend made by the last two films:  A New Hope / The Phantom Menace  - Both of the "firsts" in the series are antonymical nouns following some kind of an adjective.  The Empire Strikes Back / Attack of the Clones  - Some kind of adverb describing an attack (including "attack" itself) along with&nbsp;a noun pertaining to a group of people.  Return of the Jedi / Revenge of the Sith  - Doesn't take a Jedi Knight to figure this one out. There's also a rumor going around that Lucas has hired some kind of dialogue director to supervise that respective aspect of the film. If this is true, not only is it the first good decision Lucas has made since 1980, but it's also a potential saving grace in instilling a final breath of fresh air for the franchise. But I do have one wish, that will most likely go unfulfilled (and I'm about to get geeky on y'all): That Lucas not show Anakin's transformation into Darth Vader. Now, think back to the first time you ever saw  The Empire Strikes Back , and the amount of shock that you felt upon hearing the words, " I am your father. " come from Vader's concealed little mouth. Now imagine showing these movies to your kid or kids, in numerical order so as not to confuse the living Hell out of them. That surprise is  gone . I mean, come on. You're putting a little  more  Hayden Christenson in the DVD release of  Jedi , why not trade it off with a little  less  Hayden in  Sith ? Eh, George? George?  And, for my last hurrah for the night (or morning, depending if you're anal about that sort of thing&nbsp;or not): Over the past week,  Waterfront  and  Network  were not the only classics I had the pleasure of viewing for the first time. For some reason or another, since the beginning of last year I've had a sudden and mysterious obssession with the films of Blake Edwards. The only ones I could get my hands on, via my father's VHS collection, were  10  and  A Shot in the Dark , which, of course, left me wanting more. That's when I discovered that my father had recently acquired the Pink Panther collection, released by MGM for the franchise's 40th anniversary, as well as (most likely) a precursor to Steve Martin's prequel (aptly titled  The Pink Panther , due out next year). The collection includes five out of the nine films (not including next year's prequel) -  The Pink Panther  (1963),  A Shot in the Dark  (1964),  The Pink Panther Strikes Again  (1976),  Revenge of the Pink Panther  (1978), and  Trail of the Pink Panther  (1982). Now, fans of the series may notice (and most likely all ready have), the absense of two in-between films:  Inspector Clouseau  (1968) and  Return of the Pink Panther  (1975) (the other missing installments are  Curse of the Pink Panther  and  Son of the Pink Panther , for obvious reasons). It's undestandable why  Clouseau  is left out. Because of debates between Edwards and Peter Sellers on the first two films (thank you, bonus DVD), it would be released almost unofficially with  Divorce, American Style 's Bud Yorkin directing and Alan Arkin as the famous detective (as of date, it has an average 4.8 grading on IMDb). However, it's a crime that  Return  was not included. Not only was it Edwards' and Sellers' return to the franchise, but it's also (from what I've heard) a very funny film, and essential to the series. The reason? Copyrights. Of course, copyrights. The same copyrights that kept MGM from aquiring both  Never Say Never Again  and 1967's  Casino Royale  from Warner Bros. and Columbia, respectively. The same copyrights that magically got them  The Terminator  from Artisan, previously Live Entertainment. Yes,  those  copyrights. Well, Jewel Entertainment, the same company that released  Revenge of , released  Return of  in 1975. It's also ironic that the company that currently holds the&nbsp;home video&nbsp;rights to the film just happens to be...Artisan Entertainment. Okay, enough ranting. I'm reviewing the films and then going to bed. Blow by blow:  The Pink Panther  - I was fortunate enough to have seen  Shot  before this. Whereas  Shot  is a genuine and unrelenting comedy,  Panther  only has certain funny moments. I hate to say it, but those funny moments are the ones with Sellers, who doesn't really come into the film as a main character until the second half. The first half is funny more in a "This is such an easy target for an  Austin Powers  film" kind of way than something you would laugh  with .&nbsp;Again, the saving grace here is Sellers. In fact, he's the only actor that doesn't have an annoying role in hindsight: David Niven, Capucine, and Robert Wagner are all stereotypes of the sixties class of snob. Overall, a mediocre film, despite the loyalty that's almost mandatory upon a viewing.  A Shot in the Dark -  Now the real fun begins. Whereas  Panther  was almost an overwhelming disappointment, its sequel is the complete opposite. It's ironic that it's one of the only films in the series to not carry the "Pink Panther" monicker, as it truly is the first installment of the series. Not to mention a great film. Everything seems to work: The acting (again, Sellers' especially), Edwards' directing which I've obssessed over all these months, the script (co-written by  Exorcist  author William Peter Blatty), and the comedy. Surely the best film of the series.  The Pink Panther Strikes Again -  Although I would like to have reviewed  Return of the Pink Panther  here, I'll definitely settle with this one. Whereas  A Shot in the Dark  is the best film of the Panther series,  Strikes Again  is by far the funniest. Coincidentally not having a thing to do with the Pink Panther diamond itself, the plot has former Chief Inspector Dreyfus escaping from a mental hospital to exact his revenge on Clouseau. Hilarity ensues so much that I literally could not let up my laughter. Noteable scenes have Clouseau unknowingly escaping the&nbsp;best assassins in the world as they kill each other and attempting to break into an old castle.&nbsp;It's a shame that it's followed by...  Revenge of the Pink Panther  - The opening has a group of Mafia big shots meeting in Paris, deciding to kill Clouseau to get respect from the Godfather. When watching, I thought the scene was made serious for a reason - Mafiosos deciding to kill a man is rarely humorous. Not the case. If Edwards and co. were attempting to make this scene funny, I would now understand, having seen the film. Maybe it was the high expectations after  Strikes Again , but I'm going to be frank: This film was not funny. At all. I laughed once or twice, and even then, it was a chuckle as opposed to the uproarious laughter from its predecessor. Another interesting note is the apparent failure of Pink Panther's disco era... And finally,  Trail of the Pink Panther  - This is an outrage. Plain and simple. For those of you unfamiliar, Sellers passed away from a heart attack in 1980. This film was released in 1982. You do the math. The pacing of the film is interesting to say the least. Clouseau actually disappears 40 minutes into the film, never to be seen again. Anyone who's ever seen a movie will surely ask, "What the fuck?" The film is the ultimate rip-off. Literally. It was compiled of stock footage and deleted scenes from prior Pink Panther movies. Not to mention there's a scene involving a blind and deaf old maid and a dog, a strange combination previously paired in  10 . But the main question is, why even bother making the film? Seriously! I can understand trying to honor Sellers' memory, but by  this?   Anyway, that was my week in movies. Hopefully for all you ADD-stricken people out there, this&nbsp;took longer to type than it does to read.&nbsp;Goodnight.

      Don't you feel special. I recently heard about this blog thing from a friend of mine. I thought to myself, "Hey, here's a way for&nbsp;me and any of my friends&nbsp;to post our totally irrelevant opinions concerning movies we've recently seen, movie news, scandalous Hollywood gossip, or just random thoughts." So sit back and enjoy, whoever you are,&nbsp;from now until the end of time, or just whenever I get too lazy to update this little blog of mine. It will most definitely be a hell of a time.

      I saw  The Village  the other night, along with   Jonathan Demme's remake of  The Manchurian Candidate  (Alex and I snuck into both films with two tickets to  The Bourne Supremacy , which I'd also like to see soon, despite a certain unnamed bitch's saying it was bad). Since I know that Mike is going to write a comparison piece on the original and remake of  Manchurian , I'll keep my critique short. Although it was a good stand-alone film, it was the original's snowcone without the flavor, so to speak. Whereas the original was a metaphor for Communist paranoia, this one...isn't. It's just a thriller about a Presidential election. Also, we don't have anything on par with the trippy, falling-through-the-cards hallucination sequences of the original. Or a karate fight.  As for  The Village , it was by far Shyamalan's worst film. Now, I'm not his hugest fan. I liked  Sixth Sense , loved  Unbreakable , and thought  Signs  was very mediocre. Overall, I think his writing and directing styles are kind of cliche and melodramatic. But  Village  takes the cake. The only thing I'll say, without even revealing anything, is that I actually leaned over to Alex and predicted the trademark surprise ending.....ten minutes into the film. I'll let you see it and judge for yourself.
