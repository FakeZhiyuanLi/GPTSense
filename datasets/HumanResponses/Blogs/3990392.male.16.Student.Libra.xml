      I think of awhile ago,we might have had it all.I was so stupid then,you needed time to grow.But now just as things change as well my feelings do.in time things rearrange,I am so sick of chasing you But what do I get 'cause I just seem to lose.you make me regret those times I spent with you and playing those games as I wait for your call and now I give up, so goodbye and so long.It's not a change of pace this time I'll get it right.it's not a change of taste I was the one there last night.You have your other friends,they were there when you cried.didn't mean to hurt you then best friends just won't leave your side.But what do I get 'cause I just seem to lose.you make me regret those times I spent with you and playing those games as I wait for your call and now I give up, so goodbye and so long.When I needed you most,when I needed a friend you let me down now like I let you down then.So sorry, it's over!!

      I took her out it was Friday night.I wore cologne to get the feeling right.we started making out and she took off my pantsbut then I turned on the TV.And that's about the time that she walked away from me.nobody likes you when you're 23 and are still more amused by TV shows.what the hell is a.d.d.?my friends say I should act my age,what's my age again?what's my age again?Then later on, on the drive home.I called her mom from a pay phone.I said I was the cops and your husband's in jail.this state looks down on sodomy.And that's about the time that bitch hung up on me.nobody likes you when you're 23 and are still more amused by prank phone calls.what the hell is caller ID?my friends say I should act my age,what's my age again?what's my age again?And that's about the time she walked away from me.nobody likes you when you're 23 and you still act like you're in Freshman year.what the hell is wrong with me?my friends say I should act my age,what's my age again?what's my age again?That's about the time she broke up with me.no one should take themselves so seriously.with many years ahead to fall in line,why would you wish that on me?I never want to act my age,what's my age again?what's my age again?What's my age again?
