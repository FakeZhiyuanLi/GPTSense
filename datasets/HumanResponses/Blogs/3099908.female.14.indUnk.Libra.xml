      Hey guys  Let me start out by saying WE WON OUR SOCCER GAME TODAY! yea! 3-0! haha Wow winning felt good. Real good. Like whoa. haha anyways I had an indoor game today too and we tied that, but we were tired so its cool. I'm so happy now.   One of my neighbors just called to say it's snowing outside (thank you captain obvious, hahaha)  THANK GOD cause i have so much homework that I put off all weekend...so im really hoping for a day off. But if we dont have school, we won't have school soccer tryouts, im guessing. Which sucks cause i just want to get that over with cause im really nervous.    Randomness: While I was driving to Fuquay and back there was a lot of stuff that just made me go whoa. First of all, the gas prices are really low over there. Just thought I'd let you guys know. Second there was this sign outside a church that said "God loves you so much he can't keep his eyes off of you." ...So don't worry guys he's got your back. lol. And third, there was a car in front of of us with a liscence plate that said "life's a bitch". Actually it said something more like "lyfsabch" but you get the idea. I was like what haters....

      SO this would be my first blog thingy...everyone else has one so I decided to make one too. Cause I'm just so cool. HAHA..anyways..  So today's Valentine's Day....I love this day, though it reminds all the people that are single that they are single.... which kinda sucks. lol and plus yesterday we got carnations in school, and it was great and all until someone gave someone else some flowers which made me mad...but we wont go there...  This weekend I've got a soccer tournament... we definetly didnt do so good. We lost both games today (one was at 8:30 and the other was at 2:30) and we lost 1-0 the first one and 6-2 (ouch) on the second. We were kind of sluggish (what an awesome word!) but it was aiight. The second team we played was one of the top 5 teams in the state, (classic, 1st division...real good) ...plus it was raining and so fuckin cold. So cold. I couldn't feel my hands. But its fun playing in the rain, most of the time, so its all kudos (also a coolio word). We've got another game tomorrow at 12:30 down (or up?) in FUQUAY-VARINA BABY!!!!   Song: One Call Away-Chingy Mood: kind of sad ab losing, but whatev    im out yo

      What is it with certain people not getting the message? How much clearer do I have to make it? Cause if someone didn't include me anything and didn't talk to me and told me that they didn't want to be my friend, then I'd leave them alone. I don't know how much clearer I can make it for them to understand without screaming "I HATE YOU" in their face. And it might just come to that. ugh...

      I have lots to rant about.  First of all, I can't believe soccer season's over. It went by so fast, I'm just like whoa. it was soo fun! So fun! Man. It's gonna be weird not staying after school anymore. And I have all this free time...geez. haha, not that I'm complaining of course....haha. Plus I still have my challenge team... Second of all, let me just say that I HATE PEOPLE WHO SUCK UP. UGH. ESPECIALLY TO SOCCER COACHES. Okay so here's how it goes. So after our last jv game yesterday, I was super tired. On top of that I hurt my knee and ankle and was completely out of breath. So I'm hobbling (i was seriously hobbling.Haha) to the disgusting bathroom to dress out, when Ellen (Thats just a code name by the way, I'm not gonna so mean as to put her real name on here.) comes up to me to ask if I'm going to our challenge practice. Cause she's on my challenge team too. And I'm not bragging or anything, but she doesn't play half as much as I do in JV games, and I usully play like the whole game. So she wouldn't be as tired as I was. Anyways, she comes RUNNING up to me, asking if I was going, and I said "God, I'm so tired, the last thing I want to think about is going to soccer practice." And then she says "Well I'm going, I promised coach...blah blah blah" cough SUCK UP cough. So I was just like whatever...And then I get an email from the coach saying how well pratice went that night, etc etc, and then he added this thing saying "Ellen toughed it out and came to practice after a JV game!!" HE SAID THAT. geez...I don't like how people say stuff and judge things when they don't even know the whole story.  Third, some people really need understand things before they get into them. I mean seriously...you have no idea what you're getting yourself into. Lastly, some of you guys need to see things that are obvious to everyone else...and that is all I'm going to say.  Okay, I'm done ranting for now...hey this is what this blog thingy's for, right?

What beasts. Haha. Anyways, I am kinda bummed out about India though. I mean its great and all cause my family is there and I like getting all those presents, but its so HOT! and the bugs! don't even get me started. Plus, all the cool kids I won't get to see like forever! It's like for a whole month...I best have access to a computer of some sort there or else I think I will cry. Okay, thats all for now....WHOA. Actually I just realized I probably won't write here again until JULYYYYY. HOOOOLLLYYYY MOSES. Man. ohh well...If I don't say bye to you before I leave then I'm sorry. STAY COOL YOU GUYS...haha.

        You're an Etch-a-Sketch!!  You're the creative, artsy type who doesn't need to actually utilize a single muscle group in order to have fun. Doesn't matter though, you're still cool.    urlLink   What childhood toy from the 80s are you?      brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla        You are WILD AND CRAZY KIDS.  You couldn't get through life without a little fun... or a neon colored t-shirt.  You are a team player and really into Omar Gooding.  GO YOU!    urlLink   Which old school Nickelodeon show are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla           Sneakers- funny, laid-back, and goofy, you love to make people laugh and have a good time.  You enjoy comfort and don't care to much about what people think of you.  You like to hang out with your buddies and just have a good time.      urlLink   What Kind of Shoe Are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla     HAHA the wild and crazy kids one makes me laugh...what would I do without a neon colored t-shirt?!  *edit: I had to take the pic of the wild and crazy kids thingy out cause it was screwing up the rest of the site. Sigh...I know you guys are all verrry upset. haha

Today in math my teacher (Mr. Weinstein for those of you who know him) tripped over this girl's backpack and tumbled onto the ground and like ran into my desk and fell on the floor. he was ok, but it was SO FUNNY. I mean just picture this...old guy who looks like he ate a tire cause hes so round...HAHA...and he's like balding, and just picture this guy tripping and rolling around on the ground. MAN IT WAS GREAT. hahaha and he was all red and said "Woo, that was embarrassing." It was probably the most activity he's done in years. I could not stop laughing...hahaha. Man, it completely made my day. And I'm still laughing.

      Today was an interesting day. Well it started out kinda bad cause in c&e I didn't have time to finish my test so I automatically got 10 points taken off :(....not cool. But then in ESPAÑOL we did this little raffle thing. AND I WON 4 TIMES!! I got like six bucks to mcdonalds and five to blockbuster, and a free chicken sandwich for chick-fil-a annnnd two lollipops. But I gave them away (the lolliopops I mean) cause I'm nice like that....plus I dont really like them...hahaha. SO that was super...ohhh yes. And then I didn't really do anything for the rest of the day until ORCHESTRA...gahhh I'm sooo nervous. I hope I didnt screw up my audition tooo badly...I dislike sightreading with a passion. ohh well...Then in gym my coach tried to con me into handing out straws for the people who had to run laps to makeup for running days they missed....man did I deny him...hahaha. Instead I hung out with my buddies Beaver and Haynes..haha. Oh, and the bus was fun, like always..Josh was acting a little special...and then the kid who hates me AKA HATER drew a unibrow on that girl in the yearbook who got her arm bitten off by a shark...crazy kid. And then the JV soccer party was so great. So much FUN! And helium is my new best friend. You know that thing where you suck the helium into your mouth from the balloon and then you talk all high-pitched? It's great. I can't believe I've never done that before. And if you haven't tried it...try it. Seriously. Well that is all for now.  HAPPY BIRTHDAY DIANNE!

          My Bloody Valentine- All The Time In The  World     Your theme song is mellow and spirited, perfect for  a long day of relaxing. You know how to slow  down and enjoy life for what it is, without  getting stuck on the past or worrying about the  future - good for you! Sometimes people may see  you as lazy, but they'll never get the same  pleasures out of life as you do.    urlLink  What's Your Theme Song?     Soo what have I been up to? well I'll tell you. yesterday was my dad's birthday so we went to olive Garden to eat. (I tell you that place never gets old.) And we went&nbsp;to this real late showing of Harry Potter on IMAX. Haha cool, I know. But it was okay, I thought. It was a real fun day.   Hm and then today me and my dad just drove around in the morning. And that was fun. We went to Eckerd's and Office Max and CVS. Bought myself a hole puncher. It's purple. Best color they had unfortuantely. There wasn't any blue or I'd have gotten that..the others were like peach and marigold and yeah I'm going to shut up about hole punch colors now. It works like a dream. And&nbsp;I spent the rest of the afternoon cleaning and rearranging stuff. And you know what? I had a lot of fun. Haha. I don't know.. I just like cleaning up and throwing away old junk and crap we have lying around. it's real satisfying. And it like gets your mind off what you were thinking/worrying about before. At least..it does to me.   Oh my god something really really awesome happened today. I GET TO STAY IN CHALLENGE! Holy shit I am so freaking happy. You have  NO  idea. Earlier this year, around uhh April, my dad had told me that this coming fall would have to be my last challenge season, on account of we had to save up for something which I don't really want to talk about right now..and challenge is expensive or something, mainly cause of out of town tourneys. All cause of we stay in real nice hotels. Oh well. Well anyways,&nbsp;I had this real long talk with my dad today, and it was just awesome. And we talked about soccer, and I told him I didn't want to quit, but would if I had to. And he told me that he'd been thinking and unless they kick me off the team or something (haha) I can stay. Woww..I haven't been this happy in a  long  time. Man. I'm gonna go eat ice cream or something just because I'm happy. And ice cream makes me happier.&nbsp;Love you alllll-&nbsp;Megha&nbsp;

      lalala..I went to lunch with my dad and his co-workers/ friends today. They're interesting people. For sure. They really were absolutely HILARIOUS. It was great. We went to this&nbsp;Ten Ten Chinese Buffet&nbsp;place. It was actually pretty good, and I'm not really a chinese food person. Oh, the desserts were&nbsp;just fantastic.&nbsp;And then after that, I got home and found&nbsp;that some of my sister's&nbsp;weird friends were coming over. And so I remembered the last time that happened. I think I will share what happened last time. Hokay. So I leave&nbsp;my room to get something from a different room when all these little girls start coming&nbsp;up the stairs staring at me. And I just kinda stand there&nbsp;thinking&nbsp;"Uh..what's going on?" Turns out they all wanted to see me, and so my sister was like, okay guys we'll go look at my sister for hours and hours and hours and hours because she is just the coolest person&nbsp;on the planet. Okay so maybe that's not how it all went down...but still I felt like I was in a zoo or something. They were just standing there.&nbsp;Staring at me.&nbsp;Anyways I just backed away and went back in my room. Yes,&nbsp;I handled that situation well. So I really didn't want to be there when they came today, so I just hoped that someone would call and ask if I wanted to do something. And Kendo, I love you for that. Haha. So I went&nbsp;to the movies&nbsp;with Kendo, her brother, her brothers friend,&nbsp;and another guy who I think was her&nbsp;brother's friend's brother...haha but I'm not sure. Saw Anchorman.&nbsp;SO FUNNY! Well I think I'm gonna end this entry with a picture from ExplodingDog.   &nbsp;  &nbsp;  urlLink    sometimes i like to eat soap for dinner

       uh.  Yesterday me and shake (Kendall) went to the Y cause that's where the cool kids hang. It was like a pool party thing that was aiight except we didnt swim. There was an ice cream truck&nbsp;that drove up while we were walkin around and it had the funniest music to it. We waved at the ice cream truck driver. She waved back. yeah we saw&nbsp;a hater&nbsp;there too, who wouldnt talk to us and made it pretty obvious that&nbsp;he was&nbsp;avoiding especially cause he looked straight at us and then looked away. hahaha loser.  I think next time i write here Im gonna put up pictures from india if i can figure out how.   &nbsp;

      It's been a week. I got back from the beach earlier today..I went with Kendall and her brother Kyle and her brother's friend Marc and Kendall's parents. Oh it was so much fun. Saw The Village and The Manchurian Candidate. Went putt putting. So fun. Oh and Val... I'm glad you called me while I was there on Saturday. It made me happy. Haha. So I think I'm gonna list some funny stuff from the trip..because I like it like that.  - How everyone calls me Pie now....winner buys Pie, PIE IS NOT FOR SALE! - 48 doughnuts walk into a bar...hahaha - The diagnosis stuff..like Diagnosis: Delicious! and..        Me: I can smell!    Marc: Diagnosis...INCREDIBLE!   - The Axe...oh the Axe. - Guys stealing our coffee and hiding it..        Kendo: Tell us where you hid it! Or give us a hint..    Kyle: I already told you...it won't be somewhere where you're looking.    Me: But we don't know where we're looking!    (and then everyone hits me)       Me: Okay, they have it in there..come on lets go get it back...we have to be VERY  STEALTHY         Kendo: Okay (and then immediately trips over laundry basket)   - Dancing in the car.. the pose and shake! haha - Listening to old school music...aka Backstreet Boys, NSync, old Britney Spears and old Christina Aguilera..and somehow remembering most of the words.. - taking FOREVER trying to figure out how to pay our own separate parts at the restaurant at lunch...when we could've split it at the register - ZEBRA CAKES! - calling people on their cells and NO ONE is home - the huge mess in our room - goodnight, bye. - Playing Taboo.. "No one ever told me I wasn't supposed to say the words on the card!" "Ok, what am I doing..'Monday:  partly sunny...Tuesday.." - At putt putt: Warp drive...hitting the ball RIGHT into the water...hitting the ball right into the woods...the annoying duck sound...the green dye in the water will turn you into the hulk...live shots... - "This isn't caffeine free..is it? Ok uhh...we would like to apologize for our behavior starting in 20 minutes. Ok so make that 2." - On the way home from putt putt: ABORT MISSION....the random story we made up about Stan and being a pole vaulter..."I thought you guys were talking on the phone." - Me and Kendo laughing so hard after just looking at each other..and making everyone else really confused. - Don't do it or all is lost. - Talking about all the crazy and weird people we know.. "The FBI Agent Who Would Not Hang Up The Phone" - Taking pictures of everything - The creaking couch - Reading Babysitter's Club books - Fun with hats..haha - Playing catch in the house with those paddle things...      Me: (after missing the ball) Where'd the ball go? (I spend about 5 minutes looking for it) Guys..i can't find the ball.   Kendo: It's definetly not attatched to my paddle which is hidden under this pillow.    - PAUSE! - Cha-ching! - Can we run home? - It was ORIGINALLY $10,000 but I got it for $1 at the dollar tree! - diamonds and property... - wearing sunglasses when its dark out - delectable desserts - I feel soo wishy-washy! Ohh the beach haze! hahaha - quoting Anchorman (funniest movie ever) like every two seconds..   "Faaantastic! Ookay!"   "It's made with bits of real panther."   "I enjoy a nice pair of slacks."   "I love lamp." ..and so much more..     Marc: Where's Kyle?   Kendo: I killed him..with a trident.    - "What would you get if you mixed Spiderman and Anchorman? SPANKERMAN!"  ...and I can't think of anymore. Pictures later.  So anyways, after I got home today, I found out that one of my dad's friends from Richmond is coming to our house for a week. Yes, he's staying with us for a week. And since my parents go to work and my sister goes to the Y every morning...it's just going to be me. The mornings are going to be SO awkward.. especially since I haven't seen him for like four years. And no, Kendo, I doubt he's cool...my dad's friends usually aren't. Now I can't paint my room before school starts. So it completely ruins my last week of summer. Agh. Oh but one good thing...soccer starts tomorrow...finally. It's been wayy too long. Alright. That's it then.
