       Current Music:  Vineyard - Surrender   I'm giving You my heart, all that is within   I lay it all down, for the sake of You my King   I'm giving You my dreams, I'm laying down my rights   I'm giving up my pride, for the promise of new life ...   And I surrender, all to You, all to You   And I surrender, all to You, all to You ...   I'm singing You this song, I'm waiting at the cross   And all the world holds dear, I count it all as loss   For the sake of knowing You, the glory of Your name   To know the lasting joy, even sharing in Your pain...     That's my prayer for this week, and the rest of my life. Like Liberty said today, those are some pretty bold statements...some I can't really sing honestly.

      Today I got an e-mail about August 29th worship service, and how we were having a sort of "farewell" ceremony for Curtis. Uncle Patrick was asking the worship team to play some songs that have "Curtis fingerprints" on them. And one of the songs was  Welcome To Our World  by Chris Rice. Curtis seemed to do that song every year for worship around Christmas time...and I heard it about 2 years ago. At first I was struck by how meaningful the simple lyrics were. And then it hit me: CURTIS IS LEAVING. This immense sadness struck me. As the youth director of our church for so long...and the only one I have ever known, Curtis has become almost family to, I'm sure, the entire SFCAC community. I can't believe he's leaving...and how much I'll miss him. He's made a huge impact on my life, in more ways than one. From Sunday School to BAAYF and then to LIFE 2004...he's been all over with us SFCAC youth. I'll miss him. I'm sure everyone else will. I'll miss his Sunday School teaching. I'll miss his stories he recycles for sermons. I'll miss the movies he works into them. I'll miss his jokes that seem to always fit in. I'll miss his advice. But most importantly I'll miss Curtis himself. Gosh I must sound idiotic to miss a guy this much...but if you know Curtis...you'll know what I mean.

      I've realized my life completely revolves around going out now. I've been out of my home for so long that I feel so lost and purposeless without going out. My heart jumps every time someone asks me to go somewhere (unless it's an idiot who I don't want to go somewhere with - you know who you are!). I need to borify my life again. Make it completely dull so that I think that the most dull things are really exciting.  I disgust myself.

      I regret to inform people that I have once again fallen into the crappy hole of online journals. HOWEVER...this one is different. This is one journal that will be about a story from my day and what I learned from it. If I have no interesting story...I guess I won't post. That frees my burden somewhat. Okay...I think I'm ready!
