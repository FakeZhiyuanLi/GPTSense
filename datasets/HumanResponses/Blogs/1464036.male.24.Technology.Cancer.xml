       Had to switch offices today due to the horrible wireless (802.11a) connection I was getting.  The new location is next door to the wireless router, therefore giving me the full 54Mb that I need.  It helps when you are uploading 9+ Mb files via ftp.  Fun Fun.  Still trying to get the product complete for the demonstration we have in two weeks.  I know I can make it now.  Christie and I are still debating on an apartment or a house.  I think this will be up in the air for a while.  ILY

       All I seem to be doing, at least able to do, lately is work.  24/7.  I finally got PEAR implemented on my work server and hope to finally reap it's benefits.   urlLink PEAR  is the "PHP Extension and Application Repository".  It's a structured library of open-sourced code for PHP users.  I hope to triple my productivity.

       I'm finishing up the website for work and hopefully the site for Art Grand,  urlLink Grand Creative , so that I can really focus on losing weight.  I weighed myself on the 24th, 457 lbs., and I weighed myself today, 450 lbs..  I lost 7 lbs. in one week, a lb a day.  I'm doing the  urlLink Body For Life  routine.  It is awesome.  Six meals a day, small of course, 6 workouts a week(upperbodyx2, lowerbodyx2, aerobicsx2).  I've kept up with it pretty good this week and I'm hoping, through the continual love of Christie and my folks, I'll be able to do it.  GOAL weigtht: 265 lbs.  ILY

       Christie and I have, hopefully, finally come to a decision about the wedding.  We're going to do the June 26, 2004 wedding afterall. Through all the Vegas and Brownsville talk, she realized that she really just wants the big wedding afterall.  I love her more than anyone else.  All I need for a good wedding is for her to be happy.  ILY.

       I finally got the photo gallery uploaded for Caden's site.  Caden is my close friend Alan's son.  He is going on a year old soon.  The site is  urlLink http://www.cadenganley.com .  I have the index page automatically redirecting to the gallery.  I had to get NetPBM and PHP to co-exist together, always fun.  I also had to turn the safe_mode attribute option in PHP off.  I think this is a lot easier for Jen, rather than email everyone the pics.  This way it's centralized.  I hope Jen and Alan like it.  ILY

       I'm working on getting everything I know ported over to Linux now.  I've been using nothing but RedHat 8.0 and I'm actually interested in taking a look at Suse 8.2 Professional.  CompUSA has a copy and I'm debating about getting it.  Christie and I have finalized everything on the wedding.  We are going to have the ceremony at our church,  urlLink Northwest Hill United Methodist Church , and the reception at the  urlLink Witte Museum  in their Prassel Hall.  Our caterers are  urlLink Absolutely Everything Catering  and they have been extremely nice about everything.  I think we're looking at a Pork carving station and Chicken Cordon Bleu as our primary meal choices and a good deal of other little stuff.  I like what I have seen so far and I'm just glad we're actually starting to put deposits down and getting everything finalized.  I hope that I can make this wedding that Christie wants.  I will be posting pics soon of Christie and of a few friends.  ILY

       Today is my two year anniversary with my fiance.  We've been engaged for six months now and going strong.  We had a bit of a tiff last night, but the usual, I was being a jerk and she didn't like it.  Who would.  I apologized and sometimes know that that is not enough.  I just hope that Christie knows just how much I love her and need her in my life.  I'm still having to realize that you only get one, maybe two chances if you are seriously lucky, at that TOTALLY AMAZING relationship.  I'm in mine.  I don't plan on going anywhere.  Here's to 2 years.  And to the future with my beautiful wife to be, Christina Armendariz.  ILY = I LOVE YOU (strictly for Christie)

       Christie and I have finalized the DJ choice.  We have chosen Alan Jaye of the Mobile DJ company out of Bay City, Texas.   He is extremely friendly and very professional.  His prices appealed to us and his mannerisms are great.  I'll post a phone number soon.  ILY

       Tonight Christie and I are taking our parents to Bambino Huey's on West Ave & Bitters.  It's THE best Italian restaurant I have ever been to.  Very good shrimp alfredo.  Last year Christie and I took our parents to Shogun, a Japanese restaurant where they cook the food in front of you with a mini show (very good), so we are going to make this kind of a tradition.  Thank the folks for all the support and just to say hi and make sure they are all communicating.  ILY.  --UPDATE-- Everything went great.  Food was excellent as usual and the service was great.  Parents got along, no casualties to report of, and everything went off without a hitch.

       Current wedding situation: 1. Wedding has been moved from Northwest Hill United Methodis Church (Our church) to Margarite B Chapel on the Trinity University campus.  This is where I graduated last December.  Very beautiful chapel.  We paid for it and it's set for 3pm on 6/26/2004.  2. The dress is paid for.  She chose it from David's Bridal and I still haven't seen it.  I know, I know, traditions.  3. Christie has been shopping around for a florist and has pretty much settled for Floral Elegance, a florist her sister Elaine suggested. Christie met with them and was impressed with their professionalism and their quality.  I asked her for a price and we're going to be paying them with my next paycheck.  4. The cake, decorations, and photographer are still up in the air.  We have ideas, and will be finalizing them as soon as possible.  Christie has accomplished what she wanted to start before school starts again this fall.  She is going back full time at Northwest Vista College, a local community college.  Still pursuing the Psychology degree.  We're doing good, had a few shaky days about a week ago, but God has a plan for us and we are positive it is for us to do it together.  I'll write again soon.

       NEW UPDATE: 1. Wedding is almost here.  2 months away. (6/26/2004)  We've had a rough engagement.  It hasn't necessarily been us, but the stress from our jobs and the wedding itself has added up.  I would be the first to say that I didn't think weddings were stressful.  I WAS WRONG.  It is hard for me, the most left-brained person, to adjust to paying a great deal for one day.  I've adjusting to the idea that it is only money, but the love that I have for Christie is forever.  2. Work has been pretty stressful.  I know that I won't be able to make as much money as I'm making anywhere else and will have a hard time finding a more loyal/generous employer.  I've been doing a lot of custom crystal reports, data conversions, scripting and phone support.  I had to go to Eagle Pass this past Monday and Tuesday and the client may not even pay the bill.  I'm tired of clients who think that they can be friendly while I'm doing the job and then turn on us as soon as the job is completed.  3. Life.  I've officially got venous stasis.  The blood is not flowing back up my legs like it is supposed to.  I've got swelling and blood clotting going on in my legs.  Not fun.  I'm trying to work out but it hurts to use my legs.  I'm seriously considering the gastric bypass surgery.  I'll be updating this again soon.  ILY

       Christie's Birthday: We celebrated Christie's 24th birthday on Sunday.  It went well.  We have a 21 seat, stadium seat movie theater at our apartment complex.  We rented it for the night and were able to watch "Seven Brides for Seven Brothers" (a great classic) and "The recruit" (guy flick/tech flick).  She got a good deal of presents and everyone had a good time.  ILY

       Finally moved my office around this morning;  Feels much more spacious.  Also got a chance to vaccum the whole room.    We're heading up to Spring Branch (~30 mi. N. of San Antonio) to visit with Christie's grandmother, grandfather and aunt.  Hope to get to spend some more time with Andy (high school friend and a groomsman in my wedding next month).  We got to talk for a while last night.  Thouroughly enjoyed it, got to catch up with him.  Hope all is well with everyone.  ILY

       45 days till the wedding.  We will have everything paid off before the wedding.  I'm actually really anxious about this now.  I was trying to not let it affect me, but it's hard not to let the day that you commit yourself to your soulmate affect you.    ILY

       40 days to go.  Heading to Houston this weekend to spend time with one of the groomsmen.  Get to see how much their (Alan and Jen) son has grown in the last couple months (Caden).  All is well so far.  Just plugging and chugging.  ILY

       How's it going everyone?  I'm feeling pretty good.  Got to spend time with the other Meridth men this morning and saw "The Day After Tomorrow".  Good movie.  Far-fetched, sci-fi you say?  Isn't that the reason for going to the movies?  To escape reality?  My former roommate and very good friend Theo Risinger was with us also.  He just finished getting his Masters in teaching from  urlLink Trinity University ;  the same school I got my bachelors in Computer Science at.  He has been one of the most trusting, non-judgmental and loyal friends I have in my life.  He had to be to live with me for two years (one year in the dorms and one in an apartment).  Theo then came over and finally saw my apartment.  Christie busted her butt today and cleaned the apartment.  There are so many times in this relationship with her that I ask myself, "Why do you deserve her?".  I got her a massage at Bali Spa yesterday.  60 mins for $60.  She's been there before and said that it was awesome.  I just know that with the wedding, the stress is adding up.  I know it has been for me.  Had a hacker get into a doc's computer this week.  They uploaded a good number of full blown pirated DVDs.  It took his D: drive from 55 free Gigabytes to 11 free Gigabytes.  Once I deleted them and reset the passwords, the loss of space stopped and the doc was able to resume work.  fun fun.  Hope all is well with you all.

       This weekend Christie and I went to Houston (really League City, south of Houston) to visit the Ganleys.  Alan is one of my groomsmen and Jennifer is one of CHristie's bridesmaids.  Their son Caden is about 18 months old and is in some of the pictures if you click the link below.  Most of the pics are from their BEAUTIFUL home.  They own my dream home.   urlLink Click here for my picture gallery.   Once in, click on Ganley's home to view their home.  Absolutely beautiful.  ILY.

       My dad sent me one of the funniest emails of all time.  The following was the email:  Subject: Upgrading To Wife 1.0  Upgrading To Wife 1.0  Be careful when trying to execute this update! It might backfire on you just like this guy. Dear Tech Support:  Last year I upgraded from Girlfriend 7.0 to Wife 1.0. I soon noticed that the new program began  unexpected child processing that took up a lot of space and valuable resources. In addition, Wife 1.0 installed itself into all other programs and now monitors all other system activity. Applications such as Poker Night 10.3, Football 5.0, Hunting and Fishing 7.5, and Racing 3.6 no longer run, crashing the system whenever selected. I can't seem to keep Wife 1.0 in the background while attempting to run my favorite applications. I'm thinking about going back to Girlfriend 7.0, but the uninstall doesn't work on Wife 1.0. Please help!  Thanks,  A Troubled User.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  REPLY:  Dear Troubled User:  This is a very common problem that men complain about. Many people upgrade from Girlfriend 7.0 to Wife 1.0, thinking that it is just a Utilities and Entertainment program. Wife 1.0 is an OPERATING SYSTEM and is designed by its Creator to run EVERYTHING!!! It is also impossible to delete Wife 1.0 and to return to Girlfriend 7.0. It is impossible to uninstall, or purge the program files from the system once installed. You cannot go back to Girlfriend 7.0 because Wife 1.0 is designed to not allow this. Look in your Wife 1.0 manual under Warnings-Alimony/Child Support." I recommend that you keep Wife1.0 and work on improving the situation. I suggest installing the background application "Yes Dear" to alleviate software augmentation. The best course of action is to enter the command C:\APOLOGIZE. Because ultimately you will have to give the APOLOGIZE command before the system will return to normal anyway. Wife 1.0 is a great program, but it tends to be very high maintenance!  Wife1.0 comes with several support programs, such as Clean and Sweep 3.0, Cook It 1.5 and Do Bills 4.2. However, be very careful how you use these programs. Improper use will cause the system to launch the program Nag Nag 9.5. Once this happens, the only way to improve the performance of Wife 1.0 is to purchase additional software. I recommend Flowers 2.1 and Diamonds 5.0 !  WARNING!!! DO NOT, under any circumstances, install Secretary With Short Skirt 3.3.  This application is not supported by Wife 1.0 and will cause irreversible damage to the operating system.   Best of luck,  Tech Support

       Today Mark, my co-worker and hardware expert, and I are getting to do a server reload (Fun, fun) in Houston, TX.    Last night was not any fun, had a serious fever.  Christie took care of me.  Only if I would marry her or something. j/k.  Mark and I are waiting for the scrubbing of the RAID 5 partition to finish so that I can watch him reload the operating system and then we can work on getting this doctor's clinic back up.    Today is also Christie's bridal shower at the apartment.  The main reason why I chose to go out of town and do a server reload.  To much estrogen for me.  Hope everyone is safe and will post again soon.  13 DAYS LEFT!!!  AGGHHH!!  ILY

       DO NOT MOVE TO VINEYARD SPRINGS APARTMENTS!!!   If you don't know, that is where Christie and I live.  We have had nothing but bad experiences here.  Her engagement ring was stolen and today we had flooding.  NOT FUN.    The current management has been a little decent, but the previous management (4+ months ago) was rude, selfish, and very inconsiderate.  Go check out  urlLink Apartment Ratings.com  and see that I'm not the only one that doesn't like our complex.  ILY

       Christie and I got the marriage license this morning.  It was nice to finally have things closing down to the wedding.  I am really looking forward to all of this.  The rehearsal and rehearsal dinner are this Friday.  I'm picking up my tuxedo on Thursday.  We finalized everything for the cruise last night.  I have only been sure about a few things in my life and marrying Christie is one of them.  She is my air.  ILY

        The past week has been very productive, at least in the area of me losing weight.&nbsp; I've lost six pounds in 1 week.&nbsp; That's pretty good from what I hear.&nbsp; I worked out everyday (Monday - Friday) and ate nothing but healthy stuff (i.e., steamed vegtables, grilled chicken breast, atkins shakes, etc.).  Today, however, I got extremely hungry.&nbsp; Christie and I drove through Long John Silvers.&nbsp; I dropped $20+ on an order and brought it home.&nbsp; Christie got her burger and I threw&nbsp;my food (the family order of&nbsp;fish and chicken)&nbsp;out.&nbsp; I got two pieces of shrimp and Christie stated, "You know if you eat all of this, the past week has been for nothing."&nbsp; I first got mad at her for making the statement because I was craving unhealthy food, but soon realized that she was right.&nbsp; Hence, the throwing away of the food.  Yes, yes, I know there are starving kids in Ethiopia.&nbsp; I pray for them as often as I can, but I won't even be able to do that if I die from a heart attack.&nbsp; Week 2 starts tomorrow.&nbsp; I'll keep you posted.  Thank you to everyone who is supporting me in this life change (losing weight and eating right).  ILY
