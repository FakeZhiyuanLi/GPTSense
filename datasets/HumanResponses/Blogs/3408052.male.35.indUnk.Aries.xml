      Well, here goes.  I want people to vote against Bush. Although I do not completely support Kerry, I think it is necessary to vote for Kerry. I've heard all the arguments for Nader and I totally understant. But unfortunately, in this case we must be pragmatic rather than idealistic. Though it is now entered into the official book of Tired Old Cliches, a vote for Nader is a vote for Bush.   I agree with a multi party system. I really do. Unfortunately, we are living in a dichotomy whereby a vote for Nader is a vote for the administration he is fighting against. It's strange but true. It's unfortunate.   Why we should vote for John Kerry:  1. The War- GW has absolutely no plan to get out of Iraq. We will continue to watch our young men and women die without any strategy for leaving the country that we "knew" had weapons of mass destruction. The country we "knew" was providing material support to terrorists. The country we "knew" was imminent in it's plan to attack the US, although we know for a fact that it is physically impossible for it to do so.  2. The economy- Never in the history of man has there been a civilization attempting to cut taxes while at war. The country is in a recession at best, a depression at worst. Though the numbers may tell us that the economy is rebounding, we must look at the actual numbers to understand which sectors are enjoying recovery. Are jobs for the average Americans coming back? No. Companies have learned that to survive in this economy, they must cut cut cut, or die. Because of this, companies are operating on shoestring budgets, outsourcing, and getting rid of jobs for efficiency. The simplest way to look at this is based on the fact that if a country produces jobs whereby the average citizen cannot buy the goods and services they produce, the supply/demand curve falls on its head.  Since GW has not produced a single net job since his, ahem, inaguration, we must look critically at the optimistic rhetoric fed to us daily in the newspapers.   3. Our rights- Our president tells us that we are in Iraq to give the average Iraqi the rights that we take for granted. However, at the same time, Michael Powell and his FCC are telling us what we can and cannot listen to. John Ashcroft covers up the breasts of statues. We are told we have the rights, but these rights are constantly in jeopardy because of a president who hears the word of "God" in the Oval Office.

      We are still actively seeking a title for our upcoming September show. The concept is based on government control.  We are currently led by a president who lost the popular vote and was handed the presidency by his brother. He has put us in a war we oppose for reasons his administration arrogantly lies about. At home, his administration is trying their hardest to remove all our freedoms while telling us we are fighting a war to give Iraqis the freedoms we hold dear.   Is this OUR government? Is this OUR country?

      I would really like a gmail account for this account. I doubt I'll get one, but it would be really great to have a shared gallery account.
