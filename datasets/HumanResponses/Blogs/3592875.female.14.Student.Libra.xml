      Where do I start?    last night was awful.  I always say something I regret.  I couldn't go to sleep.  I had so much on my mind.  I finally fell asleep around 4:30.  and woke up around 6:00.  one comment just ruined my whole night/day.  am I being to emotional?  should I not let boys get to me?  I think I should just forget them all together.  as friends.  as anything more.  girls to.  I haven't had much luck in the friend department this year.  well I guess I never have.  hmm.    All I want is someone real, someone to hold the candle with me, let the nightfires burn, its not what i choose, its what i feel, and if we don't see eye to eye you go your way I'll go mine and that's alright.   So raise the glass and look right past the time you've thrown away. The tragedies and enemies, the debts you'll never pay.Understand its in your hand to turn the other way, and make tomorrow the first day.   A persons love, a starry night, all wonderful but not as grand as the man who chooses life and we compete in word and deed, you'd think we learn by now, its not what people need but that's our style.  So raise the glass and look right past the time you've thrown away. The tragedies and enemies, the debts you'll never pay. Understand its in your hand to turn the other way, and make tomorrow the first day.   Birds take to the sky, we open our eyes, your saying hello, I'm waving goodbye...To the old days.

      hmm, today hasn't been bad at all but for some reason I just want to sit down and cry.  last night was awesome by the way :-D *big grin* Chris knows all about it, haha  I woke @ 6:30 and took the dog out and then I came back up stairs and slept till about 12:30...(I have never done that before) but I felt really good :) I talked to Chris today *smile* he's such a great friend. Then after talking to him I finally went downstairs at 2:00 to eat breakfast/lunch hehe  I chilled for awhile then went to the pool to swim laps (gotta get fit for allstars) but I ended up racing up and down the pool with Dillon and some of his friends, lol he's awesome but slow (I won everything btw :) and KATELYN I GOT TO SEE CLAY WITH NO SHIRT ON! haha we're so silly! I miss you girl. You need to come to the pool with me sometime soon!!!   after the pool me and serene got ready and went to the olive garden with daddy but it was so packed we went to ruby Tuesdays instead, the food was good but the waiter was terrible. But it was still fun, there were lots of hotties and we watched some of the Red Sox dodgers game at the bar *smile* then dad took us to Barnes and noble where I bought an awesome book about a catcher for the red sox who was a spy for the Germans durning world war II, it looks awesome and I cant wait to read it, I think I'll start tonight! Then we went to Harris Teeter (THE best store in the world) haha that same dude still looks at me like I'm a piece of meat but I'm sure I will live.   I'm talking to Salina now, I'm SO glad we got things worked out, I love her so much and I missed her dearly, we're  planning on doing lots of things this summer and working out together for softball, I can't WAIT till I see her again, I love so so SOO much more than she knows.   Don't dwell in the past, it will only bring you down. Look to the future and thank God everyday for what he has done and is going to do for you.     *yawn* I'm getting pretty tired and it's only 9:30! I think I'll go take a shower and get my church clothes together!  *the best inspiration is not to outdo others but to outdo ourselves* is   it   in you?    Have a blessed Sunday everyone!    starting tomorrow I'm going to be happy.                                           Keep looking my way                                        My head is held high                                      You wanna bring me down?                                        I dare you to try...

      I watched Edward Scissorhands today and I have to say it's one awesome movie, I love Johnny depp! He's great.   well late afternoon and this even was THE BEST!! I went to robbys to go swimming for a little while, it was so much fun, except he kept kissing me and hugging me and stuff...ohwell, I kicked Duncan in the head and he almost cried *whoops* but its all good cause he knows I love him. hehe. theeen daddy came and picked me up around 7:00 and we went to go pick up serene from camp, I got to see JUSTIN (my love) and CHASE (my drunk)and VICKI! Poor Justin got blown up and broke his leg so he's on crutches but he's doing okay, chase has matured a lot....Ok maybe not but he's still so awesome, I can't wait till I go up there the 18th of July, I get to spend 2 whole weeks with all of them! *biiiiig smile*  I miss you guys so much!  Friends are like television. Some are like PBS and always asking for money, others are like the news with sad tales to tell every day, some are like that one station with the foreign language, you don't understand a word of it but you watch and listen anyway; and then there are the ones like commercials: always changing, ever so annoying and only seem to be there when you're bored. But every once in a while you meet someone who's like a really good movie of the week or that on TV show you hardly ever get to see anymore because you're so busy. My point is: hold on to the friends that you care about and since we don't have a remote control to mute someone or just change the channel, pick your friends carefully.   :-D      ...I still want some comments from my other posts...I wonder if anyone even reads this stuff....

      We all want that special person we can talk to about anything or anyone, anytime, anywhere. I mean there's "best friends" and I have a couple of those...Well ok like one * urlLink madi blye * but I've always felt like I want that one special  guy friend  (no more than that) so I can ask him questions about what guys think and what would he do in a certain situation with a girl, ect. I can do that with my best girl friend but but not in the same way, if you know what I'm saying?   Is there even such a thing? Is it possible to have just a "best guy friend" I mean help me out here, do  you  have that special friend of the opposite sex?   I thought I use to have one, but then...I lost him to highschool...I lost him because of my own personal feelings, I blame myself though. I've been looking for a  replacement , someone like him. But I've found that threes no one that could be like him, that could  be . Okay now I'm making myself even more depressed. Lets move on to something more up lifting....   I love all my friends, I just wish they new how much I did. Here's some of my favorite friendship/love quotes that I wrote and didn't write ^_^   A friend is someone who understands your past, believes in your future, and accepts you today just the way you are.     A friend is a person with whom you dare to be yourself      You never lose by loving, you always lose by holding back.      If someone betrays you once, it is his fault; if he betrays you twice, it is your fault.     It's true that we don't know what we've got until we lose it, but it's also true that we don't know what we've been missing until it arrives

Chris was working tonight *smile* I'm glad I got to see someone I knew since I've been in the house all day cleaning :-D right now I'm going to go downstairs and watch "Matchstick Men" with dad, since we're the only ones home, moms gone out with a friend (hmp but she wont let me go anywhere) aaaaanyways, I'm trying to think of something inspirational to say but I can't think of anything...hmm maybe later tonight i'll post something constructive, hehe  talk to you kids later

      Well, nothing really exciting has happened today...im still waiting for comments on my other posts *_* ummhmm  I woke up at six this morning to take my dog out, i didn't go to bed till 4:30, I got absolutely no sleep last night. I think I think to much.  Trey IMed me at like 1:00 this morning, it was the most interesting conversation, well not that interesting, I just haven't talked to him since January? hmm..   People change, things happen,you make new friends and lose some old ones, life goes on.   ???am I right???  I hate thinking about the past, the present is rather boring and the future looks....Well it's a mystery now isn't it?  nothing more to say, just random thoughts are going through my mind I can't seem to put anything together right now.

      this is to all you pet lovers who have lost your dog, cat, ect.  I read a book called "greiving the death of a pet"(everyone who has lost a pet and are still greiving should read this) and i found a few things in there that i thought we're pretty helpful for me when i lost my best friend in the whole wide world (Tibby, my dog, my baby). so i put some different things together and came up with this...    I'm going to start off with one of the most important verses in the Bible, Eccles 3:18   There’s a right time for everything: A time to be born, a time to die; A time to plant; A time to harvest; A time to kill; A time to heal; A time to destroy; A time to rebuild; A time to cry; A time to laugh; A time to grieve; A time to dance; A time for scattering stones; A time for gathering stones; A time to hug; A time not to hug; A time to find; A time to lose; A time for keeping; A time for throwing away; A time to tear; A time to repair; A time to be quiet; A time to speak up; A time for loving; A time for hating; A time for WAR; A time for PEACE.                              …A Time to Love…                            (Eccles. 3:8)   Don’t tell me “she’s just a dog’, she was my best friend, my family, my baby. Don’t ask me “if I’ve gotten over it yet”; I’ll never get over it.  “Enough, please, I’m ready to go. You’ve done all you can possibly do, And it’s okay to let me go now. You’ve always had my well-being foremost in you mind, And I’ve known that. You’ve always tended to my safety, and I’ve known that. I thank you for all that you have done— You’ve sacrificed sleep and rest—for me. You’ve sacrificed your personal life—for me. You’ve sacrificed your financial comfort—for me. How could I ever doubt you love for me? I couldn’t, and I don’t. I never have before, and I don’t now. And, now, I thank you for what you are about to do. You are going to let me go lovingly and unselfishly— Neither of us is the same as we were  Before we adopted each other. We’ve become part of the tapestry of each other’s life. Now wrap me lovingly in your love and hold me gently. I will be part of your life’s tapestry forever.”  --------                         A Time too Grieve                  “a time to weep…and time to mourn”                          (Essles.3:4)   A fell apart. Even now I think about this, and I can’t believe I’m still alive. I can’t believe I didn’t die of a broken heart. I would not ever want to feel like this again.    ---------                           A Time to Let Go                         “A time to die”                         (Eccles. 3:2)  A knew life was changing and that things would never be the same.  I also knew in my heart it was exactly what I needed to do, the best thing for her.  It was really important to me that I could be there with her to say goodbye and be with her until the end.  To say, “See?” I kept my word. I promised you I would never leave you.”    ------------    ..And this part is the most important to me, it made me relize that everything will be ok in the end and she will always be with me                          A Time to Heal              “a time to heal…and time for peace”                       Eccles. 3:3, 8  Out of all this pain, I got more insight, and I became a stronger person. After Tibby died, when I realized what kind of experience I had, I felt more whole as a person.     “Why are you crying?”  “Well, because you’re gone.”  “I’m right here with you. I’m all around you. I’m with you always.              “I know, but you’re not physically here. I can’t see you. I can’t hold you.”  “Is that really it? You have Cooper. You do have a dog you can be with, that you can touch.”   “I can’t hold Cooper; He doesn’t like to be held, but I can physically  Contact with him.”  This conversation made me really think about what was really going on.  “Well you know? I said, “Your right, it isn’t really that.” Then I thought what is it really about? Why am I crying?  “It’s just that I never wanted to see you suffer and die the way you did.”  “I know my love, but it’s all over now.  I’m not suffering anymore.  Its not part of my reality existence anymore.  If you want to come cry on my shoulder for awhile, you can, but you don’t have to weep anymore.  Let all your summer things comfort you. I’m all around you, I’m out in all the summer things that you love so much.”

      everyone has one of these things so i thought i might as well get one too. i'm not trying to copy anyone ;) i'm going to find a creative way of using this instead of just telling everyone my problems...  random thoughts, verses, movie, book, my own quotes..ect. this ought to be interesting.     enjoy.
