        I'm listening to the new hanson album right now, so if anyone had a doubt to how much of a loser I could be, here's your proof, i actually bought it. But, I have to say- they're good!  So, this weekend has seemed so long. it's only 12:30 on sunday and I'm trying to keep my eyes open. guess it must be one of those three-day-weekend side effects. But I mean, thursday was awesome- baltimore is such a cool city, and thursday night was fun too. Then friday was awesome too- 13 going on 30 is a really good movie, i highly recomend it. Saturday was interesting... Alison and I got to hang out with a foreign exchange student from france,... it was... kinda awkward.   Today is our first sccr game of the season. C'mon intensity, i know we can win this one. and it's a home game, we got mclean to represent! haha, hell yes. I'm really looking forward to it- it feels like forever since I've had the opportunity to shove a girl and not get in trouble for it. I've missed the damn sport!

In case u didnt know, yesterday hillary threw my bag from the door of the gym down to the basement, i guess it's about 2 stories. anyways, my cell broke, and... her being the bad child, who is disrespectful and i cant stand, she got her bedroom door taken away. ask her about it- you'll get more swears in my direction then u thought possible. hahah, and she has to buy me a new phone... aiiiii. good times.  sooooo... s8 party 2morrow... gonna b fun. hahhaaha... i'm out  *~*Darcy*~*

      It seems like whenever the weather sucks I turn into a bitch. Yeah, but seriously... the I haven't seen the sun in two damn days and have been in a "Don't talk to me or I'll bitch at you" type mood since then.   Today... was long. I can't really say why... mostly because "z" kept talking about how she thinks "y" is totally checking her out. Guess what babe, I told him. He's not... So, Z, do me a favor and get over it because it's just annoying. Y isn't even that hot. I don't know, that's just my opinion. Personally, I think that "Q" is better. And, for all you who are wondering, that's not d.s.... this guy actually has a personality :)   Z was seriously annnnoyying me today! "Darcy's flirting"... "Oh Darcy, you're so funny ::insert fake laugh here:: Whoops, I didn't know you were talking to the boys"...  OKAY YOU KNOW WHAT- IF ITS SUCH A FUCKING BIG DEAL TO YOU THAT I TALK TO THE GUYS, FINE, YOU TALK TO THEM. I JUST TALK TO THEM SO I DONT HAVE TO DEAL WITH YOUR DRAMA SHIT! From now on I won't keep boys as friends, haha... yeah right. Z, get over yourself.   Aiii... I either need the summer, or a big party, ASAP. Haha, but you know what- Saturday I get one of those.   I think I gotta go chill. Haha, heyyyyyyy... whats-his-name just blocked me... guessss whatttt... i. am. over. you... have been for a while.... At least make it less obvious next time. Guess you were too busy masterbating to actually think about the least obvious way to do things... ahhahaha, noooooo offense.  I gotta go studyyyyy Ciao... XOxXOOO *~*Darcy*~*   SHAKE it UP

      Ehh... i'm in such a funk. i hate it. i'm so pissed @ myself bcuz of the damn lax game. we fucking lost by 3, I'm the goalie- so it was my fault. DAMNIT. Urrggg.... I'm such a screw up. You know what, i need to get this damn game down before I do something stupid because all I've been doing is frustrating myself.  In other news, the song 'memory' is addictive. Very. And I'm mad that I can't go see sugarcult and fallout boy on the 17 or whenever it is bcuz of the confirmation party. Whatevr, support your buddies. Yay.  The girls in our grade have also found a new heart-throb among the boys of langley. Wasn't suspecting that one. Especially not this one. I bet it's the hair. Let's hope it doesn't get cut.   Also, I just got news from Chandler that we're not going to the concert on friday night @ 9:30. Right, well- at least I hadn't bought my ticket yet.  I told paula i was in love with andrew hardenbergh today. She believed me. It was funny. The end of that story.   Walkie Talkie Man by Steriofuse is a great song. Listen to it.

      It's pretty interesting what some of these ppl put in their profiles... In fact, I think I may be able to predict the next big thing that's gonna happen. Paula knows what I'm talkin bout. (No, it's not one of our profiles thou, disregard the mr avirgan comment si vouz plais)  Haha, so, just out of curiosity how many ppl are getting annoyed with my little "issue" with... we'll call him "Romeo" just for the sake I was just reading that damn book. Anywys, I know ALison and Paula were gettin bored of it last night...  Haha, wht can i say? Romeo is damn fine for a red head. that's all.   Okay- so I officially have a thing for the Backstreet Boys again. Haha, and no, I'm not the only one... Alison, yes, ur with me on this one. Haha, us and paula r officially losers- backstreet boys concerts sure bring back the good 'ol days. Especially when ur watching the stupid dvd and r watching aj hav sex with the stage... Hahah!  BTW: I was wondering, would it really be a crime to kill a sibling? I think i've been provoked to the point where I just might do it... I mean, kill Hillary, or just go ahead and sacrifice ms weiss instead bcuz she's making me redo the damn drama paper. Here's a little message to you ms weiss: if it doesn't say the same thing as the other thing, it's not plagerism- learn to read bitch.   *~*Darcy*~*  I'm only 36 minutes away.

        Heyy... It's a friday night and I'm at home. Alone. Gee, my friends must loveeee me. Eh, whatever, if I was my friend i'd be sick of my corny jokes by now too. Ahhh... I'm in such a good mood! I'll just say it's because it's a friday, and I know I don't have to wake up until noon or later tomrrow.   Hmmm... So I just watched From Justin To Kelly, am I a certified dork yet? Haha, I luv that movie. Hillary's not home, so I don't have anyone to bitch and tell me I'm a whore, Courtney's gone- sleeping at some friends. Yes, I have the house to myself, and it feels pretty damn good.   God, I feel like putting on a pair of boots, running outside and jumping in all the puddles the last two days have left. You know, just letting out everything that's been bugging me lately. Urgggg.. I hate the rain!  Anywayz, this weekend I have to party- I mean, really. And you know what, if I don't, I know I definetly will the next one.... BeCauSE... ::drumroll:: My cousins are coming!! Maria! It's gonna be so fun... next friday night, me and the crew are gonna take her out for a night in mclean!  So, I guess I'm going puddle jumping with the dog... haha! *~*Darcy*~*

      Today kinda sucked. Science exam was too long, and it bored my brain out. Then we basically had break the whole day- which is cool... for the first 20 minutes. Let's face it, you run out of things to do after a while. Whatevr, the parts of school I was at today sucked. Enough said.  Then to add to be tired, cranky, and overall sick of school- I had to go to the damn math meet. The bus ride there was really annoying. Basically I got to sit there and listen to cj bitch about his spanish homework while daniel and james try to fuck katie fletcher. The meet itself wasn't bad- infact the people at my table were pretty cool. St. Albans guys... hahaha. You get it. Blah Blah Blah... then we had to get back on the bus.

       "Be my savior. And I'll be your downfall."  Friday was the spring dance. Wow- I really wasnt expecting for it to be as emotional as it was. I wasn't even expecting to have fun. Obviously I didnt get either of those right, as I had a lot of fun, and everyone was in tears. Oh, and an added bonus was how FREAKING HOTT THE DJ WAS. O.M.G.   You guys- I'm seriously scared about graduation. I cried during my last class, the slideshow is gonna kill me.   Yesterday we collected shoes. Great turn out actually- Im thinkin 1500 pairs or so. Go ALison! hahaha. And now my carriage house smells like old shoes since they're all up there.   Exams tomorrow... and the rest of the week. I'm so unmotivated to study for any of these test- with exception of maybe SS. OMG! I think LHS may reject me... aahhhhhhh, were will I go to school? jkjkjk  ASSATEAGUE IN A WEEK! Rock on. Hahah.  I'm out. GOtta get ready for soccer game in spotsylvania. We're gonna beat the spirit... I mean- even though we have 11 players (if we're lucky) and one of our goalies has internal bleeding in one ear and can't hear out of it for 2 and a half months... and chelsea is in a cast. Hmmmm- we'll see how this goes  "If I am another waste of everything you dreamed of, I will let you down" -NineDays

       There are some people who get to me sometimes- and then there are others who I literally would like to put a gun to their head. Today- well... simply put I'll say that a certain someone I know was annoying the living hell out of me! I won't say why, or what they did- it'll give it away. But damn, that girl was annnnoying.  I'm excited for Friday night. Last dance as a Langley girl! And today was our last block of FRENCH and MATH! So I'm in a really good mood. Also not to mention that I'm basically living outdoors now, preserving my sanity before the damn cicada's come out. I'm not a bug person- I'll say that now, and I have to admit I'm somewhat nervous about the giant bugs.  What's up with the guys and that stupid hit the penguin game? I just remembered that. I swear, everytime I walk into a computer room that's what they're doing. And it's not just one of their obsessions, it's like half the grade has gone hit-the-penguin crazy. Got enough blood? Actually- Got spare time? jkjk. Whatevr, you guys were even teaching the kid who visited to play!... talk about corruption. Aiiiiiii.  May 17- First day of exams May 18- FOB's New EP comes out. May 24- AssAteaGue! June 4- Graduation.  Time is gonna fly. I have a confession to make. 'I will remember you' came on the radio today. I started tearing. I'm gonna miss you guys.  Out for the night. -Darcy

      So- I thought I'd write something here since I found out today that people actually read this... HEY AMANDA! In other news, Spring Dance is Friday and from what I hear it's probably going to end up as girls night since apparently the guys in our grade think they're all too cool for us. Haha, jk- we still luv u guys, but if you're one of those guys who are thinkin about skipping- DONT. We'll have fun, I swear.  BAND PEOPLE ARE BACK! Yay! Haha- btw, alison and paula, you know that deep down you agree with what I said today during advisors about "S" .And Im sorry for giving out the info on our views about"M" And for peter and kyle- we were not talking about a chick. But I gotta say... he's hotttt... but then again- I think 75% of the guys on the planet are hott- needless to say that I'm not too picky.   So anyways- Vienna girls piss me off. Especially the damn steroid from soccer yesterday. Jesus christ child- ever heard of a thing called self-restraint?   I'm so excited for summer... 17 days left- no more logo rule... life is good. :)

          everyone is leaving for georgia tomorrow! Where will I be? Good question- in DC w. miss weiss. Fun! and what will i be doing? looking bored and watching kyle avoid tracy. actually if he tells her off it'd be a pretty great show. I have to skip friday...  and all you band ppl- just bring me back some coke ;-) Actually, it's probably a good thing that certain people are leaving for a few days- i'm not gonna say who.   i heard liz phair for the first time in a while. 'why cant i' is the best song ever. damnit.  hehe- BAND PEOPLE HAVE AN AWESOME TIME IN GEORGIA... WIN SOMETHING! AND I'LL SEE YOU ALL ON MONDAY!

        So, today I finally got a chance to look for a graduation dress! That is- after an estimated hour of listening to bull from my parents about how stores haven't even put out white dresses yet... They were wrong. hehe- i have one put on hold! Eeeii!! So excited, finally graduating! but it was prtty funni, while I was trying on one of the dresses some of the red shit in my hair came out on the dress... and the dress is white. But shsssssssss... hahah.   I'm really nervous about this whole ss thing on tuesday. Its saturday now, something is tellin me i should probly know more than just south america and parts of europe. oh well- tomorrow we'll find out how bad my procrastination REALLY is. Not to mention that we have a game tomorrow, and we HAVE to win. Honestly- we can't loose another game (even if this is only our 2nd of the season) I don't feel like running any more sprints.  But back to the ss- yeah, i need to focus and actually study... too bad i kinda spaced it out until now.   BTW! Everyone should donate their old shoes to Alison's foundation. That girl is soo cool! hehe- and the funny thing I'm saying this in all seriousness- i don't even owe her money!   Aiii... i'm tired, i need 2 shower and snl is on in 20.... so i guess i gg... haha.  NigHT!
