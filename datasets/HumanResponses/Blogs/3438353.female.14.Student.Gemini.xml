      Well, I have three toilets which I seriously think that they are horrifying. I shall start from ranking Number three...  Rank Three... Well, it is found in China and it managed to leave an imression in my mind after so many years so...I suppose it do deserve to be ranked no. three. Urm..the toilets doors are actually cloth and there isn't any proper toilet bowl. It was just a stream with lots of urine in it and it is gushing off with steam...so..do you guys think that it should be ranked number three?  Ranking Number Two... Here's a strict warning...especially for guys...please do not puke after reading this. The second ranker is found in my school, well, if you know which is my school, just continue reading. Seriously, this gave me a bad shock when I was opening the cubical door. Here it goes...I was going to change into my PE T-shirt and I went into the toilet. Then, when I went to open one of the cubicals, I saw a pool of...watery faeces on the ground. It was flooding out from the toilet bowl and onto the floor. Believe me..this is true, no fakes about it. The whole toilet stinks with the faeces' smell man. Then, the next day, this issue went up the announcement because the cleaner went to the office and complained, asking the school how to clean up the 'mess'. Nowadays, when I go into the toilet cubicals, I see posters saying,'Do it with leisure, sit.'  Ranking Number One!!!  You must be pondering what could be the worst os the worst!? Now, here it is...it was found in Malaysia. This toilet could be regarded as one that is not...this toilet, does not have a proper flushng system, a basin and it doesn't even have a TOILET BOWL!! The whole toilet practical contains nothing but a flat piece of land and a poor little tap. The whole toilet stinks like hell man, it is full of the stench of urine. At first I even thought that I went into the wrong toilet! I thought I went into some small, shaggy room which was not cleaned up for a hundred years.
