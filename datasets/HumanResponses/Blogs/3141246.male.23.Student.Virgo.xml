      I should be salvaging my degree.  Instead, I've created a Blog.  Ironically, I have nothing to say at this time!

      Well, ish!  Something about these Blogs makes me wonder if there won't be a new type of archaeology created to sift through the layers of rock and sediment that currently permeate the net in order to trace 'cultural change' via these things. Can you imagine that Blogs may form an information resource for future generations to judge this current one?  *shudders at the thought*  Anyway, I got hit last night with the full realisation that yes, I will indeed be leaving University come October, and yes, the real world will be hard. Funny how one grows used to this bubble that is so protective; a microcosm is what this campus is.  All in all, the transition should be fine; it's just the usual niggly worries. The money, the moving, the getting a job. All the stress involved with the uncertainty of it all that will, in time, be replaced by the monotony of it all, I suppose.  You know that  'I wonder what I'll be doing five years from now'  syndrome? Well, it's got me in its grip at the moment.

      Just a warning that this post will contain reference to roleplay and may therefore cause offense to anyone dumb enough not to realise:  1)	I know it’s a game and not real 2)	Roleplaying is approximately as pointless as any other hobby you’d care to mention 3)	Roleplay is not a substitute for life  Still here? Well, I warned you!  Anyway, I’ve been mastering a Godgame for a couple of weeks now (in a Godgame, the players play Gods (shock!) and have 1 ‘Act’ per day with which to create stuff, command created stuff, destroy stuff etc… basically, with which to be God-like!), having played in one before that, and an occurrence has made me think about something.  There is this herd animal called the Xerin that one of the players created. Here’s the excerpt from the Book of Days (the in-game ‘tome’ that records everything that’s been created so that my life is made easier!):   "Herd animals with six legs, four upon which they walk, and two to use for hunting. Their hide is made of light scales as dark as the night. They posess no eyes, and instead the use a type of echo location. The Xerin are numerous on Amora, where they enjoy bountiful fruit and berries."   So, they roam the planet Amora, free of predators and surrounded by tasty berries, looking at the world through echo location, which must be kind of groovy. Then, one of the other Gods caused this strange stuff called Ether to spill into the universe at large:   "A substance that induces mutations in matter in accordance with the thoughts that happen to be predominant in the area. Fills the plane of Etherium, and seeps into the Void through random tears."   As Ao, it is my job to adjudicate what happens when a Gods acts, so I thought it would be interesting to have a small lake of ether appear near the Xerin. They would start to drink it, and have these visions of everything occurring on Etherium:   "And there is one opening on Amora, on one of the few land masses that is actuallly connected to Garamor's severed toe. A lake of ether begins to form and has a curious effect on a nearby herd of Xerin, who start to drink it. They have strange visions that the poor animals don't understand, visions of the things that exist in Etherium."   Now, I gave thought as to the ramifications of this, and decided that the visions would be so powerful, so laden with the thoughts and desires of sentient beings, that these Xerin too would start to become sentient. So far, they are beginning to wake up:   "This insight into the thoughts of all the thinking things in the Void causes an awakening, and sentience begins to dawn on this herd. What this will bring has yet to be seen, though already a primitive ritual has sprung up, in which a chosen few of the Xerin herd bathe in the lake."   And that leaves me with curious thoughts. If you are a sentient being, just walking around, eating berries, wondering how you get here, and so on and so forth, what are you going to do when you realise that others who are identical to you aren’t actually sentient? At some point, a sentient Xerin will meet a normal, herd animal Xerin, try to communicate and discover it to be impossible. Further more, eventually the realisation will dawn that the other being is not sentient!  Obviously, that caused me to transcribe the example on to humans. What would you do if you stumbled across a group of humans who were just animals, not sentient at all. The idea struck me as quite a frightening one; as a philosophy masters student, I’m used to reading in various papers, the fleeting (seemingly uncontentious) notion that human beings are special because we are sentient. It’s a human race thing. What happens if it is then revealed that, da da da dummmm, it’s not a human race thing?  Well, it started to make me think about Homosapiens eliminating Neanderthals. My knowledge in this area is scant (so I intend to educate myself there!) but, as far as I am aware of being told, there was a brief overlap between Homosapiens and Neanderthal in which the Homosapiens drove the former to extinction. Mainly owing to Homosapiens being a lot more aggressive than our poor Neanderthal cousins (making the reference to overly aggressive and stupid men as being Neanderthals just a little unfair!)  So the whole Xerin episode made me wonder if it might not have been that Homosapiens was at an advancing state of sentience, and that, when faced with Neanderthals, a genetic cousin not all that dissimilar in appearance to Homosapiens, our forebears reacted in the way we still react today when presented with a horrifying image of ourselves that we dislike and don’t understand. They killed them.  If there are some evolutionary biologists out there who would like to advise me as to the glaring errors contained here, please post a comment!  It’s an interesting thought though.

      The thing is, Go is not merely a game. It's not something that can just be picked up and toyed with, and then put down again; it's one of those things that actually sends out these strange creepers into the soil of your mind. Those black and white stones, the strange formations they make that are so familiar once you've played for a while. One finds oneself constructing them when walking to and fro.  It is a game that I am constantly rediscovering and allowing to fall into disuse, but have picked up again, this time with the intention of making it a serious hobby. There are books that can be bought (and need to be!) to enable improvement.  Should anyone need me, I can be found in KGS under the name Harlequin:   urlLink Kiseido

      I need to break this terrible rut that I seem to have got stuck in. The more I focus on a problem, the bigger it seems to get, and, just recently, I have been reminded of what it feels like to reach saturation point. The truth is that the problem is only as real as I make it, so the trick is to cut the cord connecting ego to issue and just  let it go!   So, I thought I'd post this, as I normally make the decision that 'tomorrow, I will set things right' (ironically, this is what I decided yesterday, so make of that what you will!). This is a declaration of will!  I have one 5000 word paper and one 10 000 word paper left, and then that's my Masters complete. Come October, it's the end of the sabbatical, the end of the Masters, the end of this strange bubble.  Inevitably, the start of a new bubble.  But the groundwork for change must be laid down now.
