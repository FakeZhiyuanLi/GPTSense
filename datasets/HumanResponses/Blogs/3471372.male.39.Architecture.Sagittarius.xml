      With the field combined, and 4 or 5 Quad guys in attendance, we should have had a good chance for a win or at least a good placing . . . I was incognito, as I was wearing my old Team Laure long-sleeved skin suit, so no one really knew who I was, let alone any guys on the team who may have heard of the *other* Wa[y]de, but with about 6-8 to go, after watching and moving up and down throught the pack for 25 or so laps to see what my team-mates were up to, I chatted with one or two to let them know they had some strength in their numbers, and although one was pretty tired from his efforts from the previous day, they could win the field sprint (there was a 3-man break that went off early and got as much as 40 seconds at one point). Now the BRC guys who were at the race are the very same guys that we all see at the weekly TRAINING race, and they go to the Wednesday Smack-Down, but don't race much beyond that for whatever reason. As a team of racers, we have an advantage . . . the Quad team RACES together. With a little effort and pulling together and learning what to look for in a race, where to hide when the going gets tough, and what to do in the final 5 laps of a crit would be extremely helpful. The guys at the race today did a great job as individuals, but some good team prep would have gone a long way.   Right from the gun, a few guys went off and gained a gap - with one BRC guy helping drive the effort. I launched to bridge, taking a BRC guy with me for a lap, but he wouldn't work cause "he had a guy up the road" though didn't think that we also had a gap (maybe only 5 sec's), and when he recognized this, he agreed, but died soon there after in the wind up the small rise on the course, and I wasn't going anywhere by myself in those conditions in my first real effort of the year. I dropped back to the field and the BRC guys swarmed the front . . . wasn't this a training race - don't these guys want to get any better? I guess they race only one guy at a time . . . I wonder how they decide . . .? They had too many guys taking it easy at the front of a race with no prize money and they had to pay to enter just like everyone else - that's fine for a real race, but c'mon . . .    I hung out near the front moving with the field as it accordianed back and forth, and I closed down a small break with 6 to go and started telling Quad guys to move up toward the front - to position their strongest guy for the finish - at this point we were going to be sprinting for 4th, but what the hell . . . it is after-all a training race. Some of of the guys made it to the front and were unfortunately swarmed in the sprint with 1 to go - as often happens, but I managed to get 9th in the field sprint, moving up a few places as it happened . . . I don't know where the other lads were, but no doubt close behind - they all worked hard (maybe too hard), but we're a young team, and there is a lot of really good talent on the squad - I can't wait to ride with them some more - though I do need to get some new team clothes soon, so they'll know who I am too.  Cheers!

      So a good ride yesterday - did 50-60K and hammered the last part - thought it was only supposed to be a relatively easy day since I haven't been on the bike for a few days. I'd love to race this weekend, but we'll have to see how the weather is going to shape up. These guys have been crashing left and right and I don't need that at this point. There doesn't seem to any point to riding my bike unless I am going to race anyway . . . I have to say though, that no one could have followed my wheel yesterday the way I felt at the end of the day - except for maybe Ulrich, or that Armstrong guy . . . on a good day.  My left knee is still a bit sore, but after I start this new job and head into the doc's with my new insurance plan in hand I'll look into getting a pair of orthotics. That Bill Peterson guy is supposed to be pretty good - He does the US Postal team I think - or at least some of the guys on it . . .   I was up late hanging out on Beacon Hill last night and finally got in arond 11:45, but managed to not get up till 8:30, so no loss . . .   Weather today sucks dead cows . . . though when I ride in it I do, admittedly, feel extra euro and feel like I'm doing stuff tat no one else is doing, so maybe I'll go out later after I have gotten a few things done around here on a house I am working on - I am, afterall, an architect and have to pay the rent somehow . . . being a gigolo [sp?] to wealthy women with nothing to do but spend money on that sort of thing just isn't paying the way it used to.

      So I'm not sure what this is all supposed to become - I guess a place for me to pour out the stuff that floods my head (like anyone needs to hear/read that!!), but at any rate, it should be fun.   I'm starting a new job next week at  urlLink Gleysteen Design . I am hoping for a long-term venture with these folks - they seem nice enough, do good work, and seem to have a fair amount of work on the boards. Their work closely parallels my own, albeit smaller in scale. I think they liked my ability to actually draw and communicate graphically architecture and design . . .  besides, I am ready for a higher-profile position with a future. Keep an eye here for the latest on all of this stuff. In the mean time, take a look at a couple of the images I have done for the last couple of firms I have worked for.           Racing is another thing . . . I have been struggling with getting my wheels under me for a little while in any serious way. I started riding with  urlLink Quad Cycles , but I don't know who I will be working with for the remaining of the season - Here is an old photo of me on my old, but trusty Raleigh Team bike . . . looking, if I do say so myself, VERY Euro . . . you try getting your back that flat. I'll try to post some new pics as I get them.      My plan these days is to race the following - I'll post reports and images from these races as they become available.  June  5  Lake Auburn R.R. (Maine) 6  Great Falls Criterium (Maine) 20  Housatonic Hills R.R. (CT) 27  Veryfine G.P R.R. (MA) 29  Exeter Criterium (NH)     July  2  Fitchburg Longsjo Classic S.R.

      So the Fitchburg Stage race starts Friday with a 7 mile prologue time trial, Saturday if a circuit race around a 3.1 mile loop,, Sunday if a feirce road race around an 11 mile loop with something like 8 miles of climbing per lap, and Monday is the famous criterium (second oldest in the country). I've done this race before, and have done well enough at it, but I have to admit that this time around it is the only stage race I've entered with the idea that I'd not try for the win . . . this time I am just racing the thing. My time will come with the Green Mountain Stage Race over Labour Day weekend at the beginning of August.  I raced Wompatuck last night, and some guy was taking pictures - I'd love to find out who he was and where the pics were that he took. I'm convinced that he took a few good one's of me at the front and a few racing hard in the drops. Good thing I was wearing my Quad team Jersey - though was wearing my old Laure shorts . . . I felt OK - hurt at the beginning, but started to feel a little like my old self about 20 laps in . . . was able to hurt myself beyond the level I thought I was at - fitness-wise.  Well - am off to get the Spinergy wheels from my friend Amy for the time trial at Fitchburg and I'll probably use them in the Crit as well.  I'll post some pics when I get the chance, and if I find any of me to post.  Cheers!

      Ok - so I didn't race this weekend - instead I hung out with my terrific daughter and dealt with issues regarding my former wife (not to be confused with the person formerly named . . . whatever). At any rate - the whole child custody thing is a constant hassle - betwen former wives (only one, really), current girlfriends, me, my daughter and friends who both get it and others who don't, it has been a difficult weekend.  One thig for sure is that Hannah is one great kid - she's a kick-ass, smart, tall, good looking, great attitude, with-it, athletic, blond chick (what, you expected some story about my sex life and some blonde floozy?) who a father never was more proud of.   We were on the road for all of saturday, and to escape reality for an afternoon on Sunday, went for a bike ride . . . her on her custon 650c aluminum racing bike that I built for her for Christmas. That thing is sooooo sweeeet! She fits it like she's totally pro, and looks like a pro as well - man that kid has a future on a bike is she wants it - she did over 20K for the day easily - up and down the Arlington bike path, stopping at Paulo's house to say hello, and then to Lexington Center, and home again before trundling off into the car again for her trip home and meeting her mother on the road - that's the part I hate - the meeting on the road for the illicit transfer. I know there can't be a homey, sit down kind of thing when making the exchange, but I believe it is really abusive to drop her off and pick her up at road-side rest area, or parking lot.  At any rate, I am having fun today doing a few things for the China project at the office - it is a funny little thing - I'll post something more as I develop them a bit. I feel a bit like Raymond Lowey - stylizing objects rather than designing them as I might normally . . .  L8R

      Oi! After a ton of driving and a few bloody mary's and G&T's later, I'm finally sitting here at home type, type, typing away.   I got a very cool call from my friend Christian today - calling me from his cell phone from Paderbon, Germany today - Imagine, calling from a cell phone all the way from fucking Germany to chat with me!!! Well, he has some hot new chick, that I accused of actually having to drug daily to keep her around, but I love Chris - he's a good guy, who I met whilst in graduate school in Ottawa Ontario, at Carleton University. Chris is planning to come to N America in September for several weeks with his new chick . . .  Geeze, I miss canada - I definately should have gotten "Landed" status while I waws there - I could be laying back with a Guinness or some other dark beer made for thick-necked guys named "Gunta" after a night out to the Heart and Crown, or some little place down in the Gleeb. I miss my old friends from there - Tel, Mar, Dave, Hil', Coralie, Christian, Hassan (who has dissapeared from the god-damn planet), and the whole fucking group from Renfrew House - I have to say that was some of the very best times of my whole life - I  really miss you people.  I have Hannah this weekend - she's a trip. Man I love that girl. She just knows me better than any other person on the planet - we bounce jokes off of each other like crazy, and it's hard to get a cut in edgewise if you're an out-of-towner . . . you know who you are. She's probably the hippist, coolist, smartest, best looking 10 year old I have ever come across - yeah, she's my child, but hey, she is the BOMB!!!!!  Tomorrow I may limp along at the Well's Ave race - though I'd much rather do Housatonic Hills race - but admittedly do not have the fitness for that race. Fitchburg is in a few weeks, so I have to get ready for that thing. I may try to put together a pair of really slick wheels for the hilly races - I have almost all of the required parts - hubs, rims, etc., and try to bum the Spinergy's off of Amy for the TT race and crit - those wheels would be sure to bring me to the finish in fine style . . . besides, the good kharma that Amy has would certainly be with the wheels  to bring me luck. Now, if I could only get a little good kharma from her other friends . . .  To bed, to wake, to race . . .  L8R G8R

      Ok - after a 10 year hiatus from the place, I finally got back to Wompatuck last night for a little wheel-to-wheel action with the cycling thugs from around the Greater Boston area. I got to see a few other old guys (hey there Andre) and some new turks as well, thrashing about for the 32 miles. I love the race - really - I really love that race. The course is like a mile and a quarter around, or something like that, and you can pedal through the corners. Years ago, when it wasn't as damn hot as it was last evening (started at 94 degrees and finished at a oh-so-cool 87 degrees), we once averaged a tad over 33 miles per hour for the 32 mile race. Last night's effort was only averaging a tad over 27, with a top speed of 56 kph (37 mph, and there's no downhill!). As usual, there were the squirley guys and the rock steady hammer-heads - Mark McCormack (last year's US Pro Champ) was there, doing intervals - floating back to the back of the peleton, and surging forward to the front every few laps, exciting the masses every time in the process. For the amount of training I have under my belt, and the number of times I have raced this season, I feel pretty good about the whole effort. I was at or near the front all evening, rolled off the front a couple of times as well, and never got dropped - though there were a couple of times where I felt I had burned a match or two in the process of covering moves I thought might roll off the front. The heat was certainly a factor . . . I had (2) big bottles on the drive down, and a regular bottle for the race - I drained that during the evening, and could feel my legs cramping a bit when the pressure got a bit high, but managed to stave off any problems. Over the last 6 laps, I felt really good - leading me to believe I had some of that deep muscle ability still and could tap into it, but during the last lap sat up for the sprint a couple of hundred meters out because in part, my  plan for the evening was just to test my racing ability, and not anything else - I'm not quite in the mind-set for the finishing gallop to the line just yet - over the coming weeks, we'll see how ready I am - I love a good finish, but these things must be done in stages.  Off to work . . . to colour -   BTW - here is a pic of me in my kilt!! That's me on the left . . . in my family's tartan.

      With the heat yesterday, the stress of starting a new job, as well as a  few other things, I am feeling pretty ill. Was up virtually half of the  night getting sick . . . I'm hungry, tired and hot - it's going to be  95 today, so it'll be even worse.  The job is OK - my friend Alex asked me about the job - I told him it  was a job, just a job. I think it'll be a little while before I get  into it with any vigor - the first day I went with Marcus (the  Principal) to RI to see some work, meet some clients, and chat along  the road. It all seems pretty good - they do some moderately competent  work - they need to raise the level of work though.  I'm feeling pretty scrunchy at the moment, so am headed back to bed -  Before I go, though, here are a couple of images from my awful race in RI last weekend -I raced Rhode Island Sunday in the Cat 3 race . . . it was 51 degrees and raining the whole time - the race  was a 7 corner criterium - which I HATE, but we placed a guy in the break and he finished 2nd, I flatted and was out, but damn, I looked good doing it . . . the other team-mate in the race worked too hard and blew on the last lap. With the temp staying in the 50's and the rain coming harder and harder, I bailed out on doing the 35+ race and went home - met some friends to see an early show of the new Harry Potter movie (free!!!), and was in bed by 10:ish.        __ wayde tardif

      Ok, so I'm not heading to Maine this weekend to race after all. I'm  heading to the New England Crit Championships in Rhode Island. The  course is this 7 corner kilometer around, dead flat thing - I've never  raced there before, but it might just be a good thing. Tom Scotto  (team-mate) is doing the Masters race, and I'm doing both the 3 race  and the Masters race (they are pretty short races).  I did a couple of hours yesterday on the road with a guy from the team  - I left it in the small ring the whole time but was moving along  pretty well. I have some real strength, but the aerobic fitness is  lacking a bit. I have to say that at this point, I am riding/racing on  experience/knowledge and not that much fitness - I'll really have to  step it up quite a bit in order to get things going for Fitchburg. I  want to do reasonably well there. I can't decide yet wether or not I  should race Cat 3 or Masters.  So my phone is out of order again . . . I can't wait to start work  again and get things back in order - arghhhh!  Catherine's parents are coming this evening and are taking us to dinner  somewhere . . . and we will all watch the regatta at Lowell Saturday,  where Catherine will race her single for the very first time, as well  as an 8 and maybe a 4? I don't really know. She is desperate not to  flip her single her first time out, or to DFL [Dead F&%#$@ Last]. Her  friend flipped during her first race (at nationals), and she doesn't  want to follow that example. The below pics are from a regatta from a  couple of weeks ago. Hannah and I went and had fun - regattas are fun  to watch - screaming from the shore-line, chanting C-R-I, C-R-I, C-R-I  [that's the club name  urlLink Community Rowing ]  She's the one in the headband.      __ wayde tardif

      So my internet is back up . . .  still no idea why it was down these past few days. Worked today on the Newton House - still trying to figure out the damn stair - the whole thing is tight and there is barely any room to work - I think I have it figured out now.  Here are a couple of relatively recent pics of me

      It seems that the firm I am to start with  urlLink Gleysteen Design  has delayed my start, yet again - now they want me to start on Thursday, instead of Wednesday. I think I'll tell them that I'd rather start the following Monday at this point. Besides, I've never really got a good vibe from these guys from the start. They seem to do good work, but seem a bit un-trusting and shifty . . . not a way to start a long-term professional relationship. At any rate, during my 3 month "probationary" period, I will continue to look for work - as they said, they want to give the interactions between them a me a close-up look-see and determine if I can perform as my portfolio suggests!! That blows me away! They must have been burned by someone at some point . . . Geeze I hate that people who come before others screw things up for those who come along thereafter - it has happened professionally, and personally as well - isn't every relationship a case of that? So I'll continue to opursue the other firms who have been interested in me over this time I have had ( urlLink SBRA  and   urlLink  Ganteaume )  I have come down to the shop today  urlLink Quad Cycles   to use their internet connection - mine isn't working at home for some reason . . . I also have to tighten my bottom-bracket cartridge on my road bike, as it seems to be the only thing on my bike that I have yet to tighten, and the click, click, click, click upon every pedal stroke is driving me a bit crazy (especially since I don't know where the hell it is coming from) - it undermines your performance on the bike too - like something might break if you push too hard . . .  I'll probably ride 60-70K this afternoon, and take advantage of the fact that I have these days to ride whenever I want - that luxury is over next week. I might race Wompatuck this evening if the weather breaks. I haven't raced down there in ages . . . and maybe I'll look up Chris Hidell too while I'm down there.  Hope everyone is well -   Wayde
