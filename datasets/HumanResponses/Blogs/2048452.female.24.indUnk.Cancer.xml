      why do people need to blog? i came accross many thoughts on this - which list all the pros and cons of it... some say it helps you to be more expressive, while others just have it as a dear diary thingy that could be lenghty n apparently boring... shockingly, whoda told me that there was this one girl, who had a huge crush on this guy but dunno how to tell 'im, so she gave that bloke her blog add... sad? well, i'm not here to judge now... continue wt this blogging disease... joanna plak said that she doesn't understand why people read other ppl's blog? menyebok jek she said... it hit me a bit, cause that's what i do. but later, i realise that it's not worth taking offense of... there's truth in it, i also admitted it to jo - that i ni menyebok - in a laughable way that is, so that i dont create any tension in d air -which i dont intent to....but, lookin on the bright side --> i read other pip's blog to widen my horizon (cewah) of how life is out there... i'm here doing the stuff that i think is normal, but what if they aren't normal? even if it's sumthin' weird, there'll be this sense of relief once you know that somebody else is doing it! but, tak lah including those forbidden by god. Which, i did go thru st... but, like i say, it opens my eyes wider.... sumtimes i got shocked of the things i read... say if i hadn't read them, how on earth would I know about how KL life is? i really mean this! this whole while, i thought that evry kl-ians are just like me n my circles of friends... the ones going out to pubs are just chinese n other non muslims.. there are no drinkings among malays... and unmarried couples are not allowed to live together under the same roof cause eventually, they'll get caught.... BUT NOOOOOOO...... not until the moment i read these blogs that i realised the truth about it.. well, like i said, i'm not here to judge em....  soooo, salahkah saya membaca blog org lain?  hmm.... however, can't deny that it is procrastination and an excellent means of gossipping though... hahahah.... but life isn't just as spicy if i dont do those stuff u know.... plus, lets face it, without gossipping, u'll be the last to know about everything and that makes u feel being left behind... heheheh.... ok lah, in a nutshell, i don't think that blogging (either reading or writing) is wrong.... just when it takes too long of my time like right now it is! so, key off dulu ya! i need to study, exam 2 weeks lagi kekekekek.... bye!

      Sheffield is the equivalent Kelantan of England… the people aren’t that posh & as far as I’m concern, they’re all friendly and nice. A friend of mine came for a visit n instantly labelled the chicks here ‘kampung’, judging by the way they dressed… I was like,  HELLO! I know they weren’t Prada or Gucci,  but wats wrong wif Adidas and Gap, or even New Look??? It’s not kain batik ke apa…  but I just kept this to myself & smiled…   Sometimes, I call this place kampong myself…My idea of kampong is peace, non-hectic and humble… there’s nothing to be embarrassed of… I’m proud of my second kampong. I’m proud of Sheffield… some people say that Sheffield is too small and not so pretty… but hey, it’s just the ideal place for me… We do have Meadowhall, which btw, if I’m not mistaken, is the 3rd largest mall in the UK. Plus, if you wanna see the breath-taking scenery, I can take you there! Just make sure u stay here more than 3 days and don’t forget to rent a car cause u wont see ‘em around town. Oh lupelak, I’m proud to announce that we have Starbucks now!!! (Finally after 3 yrs waiting…)   As I was saying, Sheffield = Kelantan. It’s sooo hard to understand the local accent… all the pronunciation are ‘baku’, as in Melayu ‘baku’… they sound nothing like what we learnt in school…the may not even understand a single word we say… here are a few slangs that I’ve picked up…  Our lad – my husband / boyfren / partner Our lass – my wife / gf / partner Have u had your dinner? – Have u had lunch? She’s poorly – She’s sick Snap time – break time Fag break – smoking Chuck ‘em onk floor – throw ‘em away Baddings and Goodings – Ruined ones and Good ones Chinky place – Chinese restaurant U wanna cuppa? – U want some tea? Instead of love, they may call u ‘duck’ as well, but it still means ‘love’…  Heheheh…. Itu saja syllabus hari ini…. Babai…   These pics were taken back in 2001… ironically, I don’t have any current pose of Sheffield… damn, need to go to gym tomorrow!!!

       I remembered the 1st time I listened to one of Juri’s rock CDs  the Blink 182 live in concert… “My GOD” was the 1st thing I had in mind while tryin to shut my ears from the constant swearing in between the songs. All the F words, the F+M words, the B words (u got the idea rite…). That was 2001…  Now it’s 2004, our final year here & Juri really wanted to see Blink play…’Bila Lagi’, he said… thinkin’ about the extremely slim chance of Blink performing in Malaysia, I went along laaa… (plus, I’ll use this later when I wanna drag him to my Sugababes gig next month, heheh).  We bought seats tickets instead of standing, which was wise considering all the unlucky incidents we went thru before… Juri once lost his left Adidas Superstar in the crowd. I think it was the Hundred Reasons concert. Luckily, it was held @ the student union & walking home half bare-footed in the dark wasn’t so daunting. During my first rock concert  the Linkin Park, I got left behind while Juri went in the crowd & enjoy sakan… well, a little sad but, takpe laa… the concert was damn good pon (Puddle of Mudd did the opening) and Juri kept coming back & forth making sure that I was alright..  So, back to this Blink story… Heh! I was taken aback by the fact that I really enjoyed it, AND, I couldn’t recall any swearing… AT ALL… too good to be true? Yepp.. at least that’s wat I think. I must have been so used to this ‘swearing’ environment that I did not feel disturbed even a bit… the words have become ‘mellow’ to me now…  One of the bad environments I was referring to are my summer jobs Mat2 & Minah2 kilang here used the term ‘f***ing H***’ almost all the time (imagine us working for 8-12 hrs shift everyday, having to listen to them complaining). That was the muda-mudi, but I also worked with a bunch of makciks, cleaning the hall residence (the students’ hostels)… & I can say that there were not much difference there too, except for the additional aksi2 menarik while they were having fags (cigs)… but, despite all these, I really enjoyed working with them as they were all very nice n funny people.  Not to mention the scenes in SATC (which btw, I really love, who doesn’t kan..) and Graham Norton. They use all these obscene lines, but that’s just because it’s wats happenning in real life…so it became part of my life too… and all these ‘bad qualities’ that I’m not so proud of have become immune within my system…  See how easily these bad elements diffuse within us? But if they’re so bad, why do we enjoy them so much? Where do we draw the lines between wat is wrong n wat is wrong but acceptable (because we enjoy them..)? Is there ever such thing? Or is it just sumthin that I made up so as to make me feel better…? Hmmmmmmm…………… anyway, I dah merapu ke nih? I think so…. so, bye for now…  Ps: I remember back in high school where this ERT teacher kept bombarding us girls with all the possible ‘B’ words in the Malay dictionary… hehehe… and that was in sekolah agama!

      It’s true! Love actually is all around… Heh, Poyo pun, poyo laa! I need to start being grateful of my life… Even though a lot of shitty things seemed endless these days, I still have people who’d care for me… Thank you everyone, for all the well wishes and understanding. They mean the world to me and God only knows how much you’ve helped!  My project presentation last Friday was ok for the first half, but when it came to the QnA session, my second marker bombarded me with a hell load of questions that made me looked so stupid in front of everyone!! I felt that all my effort just went down the drain, and I’d be better off standing there and present nothing but a blank screen. That was how bad it went… Damn you professor!!!! You’ve spoilt my mood for London...  :(  We arrived at St Pancras station around 8-ish, and went straight to the B&B. Kak Yam booked the room for 2 nites, so nice of her. Later, I went out for dinner at Nahar with Whoda, who by the way was a bit hyper! Heheehhe, at least she took my mind off that useless presentation earlier. She was supposed to take me ‘pondan-watching’, as what she called it, but they weren’t there. Heh, maybe next time. Out of frustration, we later joined Juri and the gang at Nandos. KamaLyla was there, she had that ‘pregnancy glow’ in her face, ahhh, so sweet… Ana banana was also there with her brother Khalid. These two are the closest brother-and-sister that I’ve ever known throughout my life, again, sooo sweet…   The next day was Petronas’s briefing and interview, held at Marriott Hotel. Juri was nervous all the way, as his interview was right after that briefing. I wished I could have done something to make it better, but I was nervous myself. Luckily, the case studies that we blind-picked weren’t that bad, Juri got ‘asylum’ while my topic was ‘crime & morality’, at least we could ‘goreng’ stuff, as opposed to business related topics, rite? So, al-hamdulillah… until TS, our big boss came out and sort of questioned me and Juri about our marriage, and how he’s against that…. Well, that’s new! I’ve always thought that I’d have to face this some day, but not NOW… not after all this exhausting and emotional week! I don’t wanna write about stuff that I’ll regret later here… simply put, although I was unhappy about this, I do want to build and maintain a healthy relationship there…  I respect him for who he is, I just wish that he could put us out of his ‘blacklist’ and put me out of misery….  Back at Sheffield, I couldn’t get my head clear to prepare for the project report. It seems all hopeless after Friday… this week was suppose to be fun and relaxing!!! No more presentation and no more interviews! But I feel really down…. Am I that stupid? What was I doing all this while??? Is Electrical Engineering really the right choice for me? God, only 3 months to graduate and this comes to mind… I don’t know why I got so emotional and can cry so easily when I’m alone with Juri… he thought that it could be down to the hormone pills that I’ve been taking… well, maybe he’s right… but I need to do something to get me out of this horror, it’s not productive!!!  So I called my mama. I told her about all the shitty stuff that’s been happening, including PCOS… I never talked to her the way I did today… As I’ve been away from home most of the time since I was 13, I never shared anything so private and intimate before, you know, the stuff that you’d share with friends or husbands maybe, but not your parents… but today, it was different… she became my new best friend. She consoled me and gave me hope again. She made my day, and now, I’m off to write my report…. Thanks mama, you’re a living proof that LOVE ACTUALLY is the answer to my misery… I love you always and forever...

      A comment I got today...   To me, it's the health that matters. It doesn't matter with your size, as long as you're fit. That's my theory. But I have gained weight after gave birth. And really feel a bit saggy and not fit. I have tried very little though to reduce the weigth so that I can feel lighter and active again. I think what matters is your health. A friend of mine had just passed away due to a cancer, and I learned that, cancer can also be developed from the unactive cell... THough mati itu pasti, but we need to be healthy. Take care ok. Kat sini UK, is pretty condusive to have a good balance diet, it doesn't mean not eating, but it means it a balance diet... and being more active, like, naik tangga instead of lift, jln kaki, etc etc... I have yet to practise, but I have included 5 a day in my diet, that's 5 diff fruit or veg in my diet... it does help, which makes my tummy fuller, and hence, less carbo. Mind you, I'm still breastfeeding, so I do get hungry easily... Take a good care of your health  reader | 03.24.04 - 4:37 pm | #     Thank you reader for the advice, yup, I do agree that health comes on top of all. But I'd be lying to myself if I say that my weight doesn't worry me, both health and appearance wise. I'm not saying that I should be skinny, but I do think that I will feel better about myself if I lose a few pounds –  the right way!   I have lost weight quite dramatically a few years back. Yes, I felt so much better, how could I not? My athma attacks became less frequent, PLUS, I could fit into normal clothing! No more trips to the plus size department, or even worse, men's! But back then, I don't think the way I shed the pounds was entirely on the right track. I exercised, that was good, but I'd also skipped my meal, which was bad news...that was y I wasn't so proud n comfortable when people kept asking me tips on losing weight - the only drawback of me being slim though...  And so I thought... but I was wrong... only to realized that the damage has been done… today, I’ve been diagnosed with PCOS… short for Poly Cystic Ovary Syndrome,  I think … I’ve suspected this for quite a while now, well since reading a gossip magazine this one day… I read about Posh and Kym Marsh who both had this syndrome and described what the symptoms were, two of them being ‘missing or irregular period and weight gain’- the worrying duos that I’ve had since forever…  see, there is sum good in reading tabloids!   As most of the symptoms fit me well (not only period n weight), I began doing research on PCOS…I also bought Mrs Beckham’s autobiography for crying out loud! I have seen doctors in Malaysia about this period problem before, around 98/99 I think… but their reply was ‘ adik tak sexually active lagi, so, nothing to worry about! Biase je ni…’  Well, Posh has been diagnosed since she was 13 or 15 – sometime around that, and I doubt that she was sexually active then! So, I went to see my GP, who kindly sets me up with this Gynae, and the rest is history…   The thing about PCOS is, losing weight is SO SO HARD (as Huda has mentioned in one of her informative comments). Gaining weight on the other hand, will be like ‘almost always’, as what is happening to me right now… Skipping meals like what I did before even made it worse, as I need the right balance of food especially to treat PCOS. Carbs are bad for us, but at the same time are very important to balance the hormones that would help develop the menstrual cycle properly… these contrasting facts made it more difficult to tailor the rite diet for us…   But I’m on medication rite now, as prescribed by my Gynae… she said, if I lose weight, it would help a great deal… she asks me to exercise and eat rite…    So, to all my kind readers, my earlier entry was not meant to tell all the fat girls out there to go lose their weight just for the sake of appearances… appearance is just the bonus of it all, we’ll feel more confident then ever… but don’t ever risk our health for it! What we want is both to look good and HEALTHY!  Oh, by the way, having this PCOS also means that my chances of getting pregnant are rather slim… I told my gynae that I want to start trying after my studies and she’ll help with the right medication later… so, pray for me k?   I would also like to thank Juri for ‘temaning’ me to my ultrasound scan & appointment today… he missed a very important match today because of this, and I can see that he’s rather upset because the team mates kept asking him y he didn’t turn up… I went to the football pitch earlier and I can see how important he was among the footballers there… so honey, thank you sooo much for missing it for me! It really meant a great deal and I would never ever forget it for the rest of my life… thanx, and I love you!  If you have any comments regarding this, feel free to leave some… I’d be happy to receive any advice or answer any question about this… but I’m having my final year project presentation and Petronas Interview later this weekend, so I might be a bit late for responses… Bye for now!

        HAPPY BIRTHDAY AYAH! HAPPY MOTHER’S DAY MAMA and MA!    Well, actually, happy belated birthday to ayah… the day was last Friday, but I didn’t feel like writing, so I sent him a power point presentation instead… just felt being arty for a split second, got some ole pictures and edit sikit2, and wallaa, got my dad a few slides n my mum too… but, it wasn’t grand though… I planned to accompany the slides with some background music, kasik romantic sket, but didn’t work out.. plus, my sister said one of the slides went wrong…aiseh…. N’way, it’s the thoughts that count kan?  Oooppss, intermission sekejap, I need to check sumthin on ebay, I’m bidding on some stuff n they’re ending very soon….    Yeay, I won!  Sambung balik…. Well, what have I done this week? Hmm, study was boring and depressing, so, I’d skip that if you don’t mind…Aaaa, I watched ‘STARSKY AND HUTCH’ with Juri after a final group meeting with the supervisors…   Before I start rumbling, has SAH been screened in Malaysia? Well, UK’s always lagging behind Malaysia cause they had to wait for all the cast/behind the scene ppl to come and do their premier here… that’s one of the known reasons laa… Back to SAH, hehehehehehehheheheheheh DAMN FUNNY and GOOD! It’s been a while since Rock School that I had such an unstoppable laugh… I thought Along Came Polly and Uptown Girls would do it for me, but nnaahhhh… they weren’t my cup of laughing tea… maybe I had too high expectation on them, and too little on SAH cause I dun like Ben Stiler… so, for those who hasn’t seen SAH yet, get going already! I don’t wanna spoil the fun by attempting a review here… go and judge it yourself! DO IT! DO IT! Muahahahahahahahahhahahha    THE BLADES WEEKEND    Well, I really don’t wanna bore you by writing about my part time career… but I’m gonna! Cause this week, it took my whole weekend and I have nothing else to write about… Plus, I also wanna make my brother jealous cause he thinks that my job is so cool.. hehehehe…  I’m an event steward (or is it stewardess? Never mind laa, I only tell my bro that I jadi mak guard – tu pon dia kata cool) at Sheffield United FC, although they’re in division one, but, they’re among the top ones, so, not bad laa… not as sucks as Wednesday…heheheh… GO UNITED!   Not that I’m a United fan, but I’m a United Fans’ fan… they are soo cool.. every time there is a goal, they’d wait for the music and would jump like clowns, not gaya bebas, but there actually is a specific move, and everybody does the same thing… I dunno about other stewards, but I gotta take care of the Family Stand and most of them are cute kids wearing all black and red blades gear… sooo comel especially when lompat2, just imagine how cute when bapak2 n mak2 org pon looked kinda cute doing that dance… poor Juri, he missed the actions again yesterday cause he was in Warwick, busy with his own tournament… so, he didn’t work Saturday…   Noticed how I only describe the crowd? Not that I’m a dedicated steward, but I know so little about the football itself to have a say publicly… plus, I dunno any players pon… the cute short one has just been transferred last week (or was it last month?)… so that leaves the bald one and the keeper… others are just normal mat saleh to me… heheheh… but I’m not all football deaf… I know quite a lot about Man U and other premiership teams, not to mention other top European Clubs… these are all the influences of my footie mad hubby… without him, I only know Beckham…Regulation wise; let’s just say that I now have the courage to debate about off side, not bad huh?  Well, I worked Saturday, and today, I went for a stewarding course… It’s a qualification provided by Derby College and funded by SUFC… Free lunch, free training and I get paid for just turning up. So, no reason for me not to go (except for the fact that it started bloody early!)… besides, I already put this on my CV.. heheheh… kang kantoi plak during interview next week….the course ended after lunch, and there’ll be another day course, before an exam (ain’t that funny? Exam for stewarding…hmmm… I think that’s why they fiddle around with the words and call it ‘Crowd Safety’ exam afterwards… hehehehe)  Hmm, I think I’ll stop here for now….there’ll be another match Tuesday, but not sure if I can make it, cause this week, SARDINE PACK schedule… but, I need the bucks though, so probly gonna go anyway.. okeh, asta lavista, babeh!

      I do believe that my childhood played an enormous part in shaping my personality, apart from my adolescence world which was full of confusion. I was both a happy and unhappy child. But now, all I can think of are the unhappy memories…People may be asking of how unhappy a child like me can be? I am not adopted nor physically abused, my family seems to be reasonably fine and I was a brilliant kid back then. But hey, you have no idea…  Every now and then, people kept saying that being fat is not a big deal, as long as you’re happy, physical appearance won’t mean anything. I beg to differ. Basing on my experience, and by this, I mean my whole life, I am never happy when it comes to my appearance.   Each time I tried to be fine with it, thinking that people are civilised enough not to make fun of me nor would they discourage me from accepting my fat self – I was proved wrong, every single time.  How can I think that it’s fine when my own school teacher publicly asked me ‘eh, awak ni takde baju lain yg tak ketat ke?’ leaving me embarrassed but still smiling (I was trying my best to keep my cool n just be polite), that was darjah empat, when I had to wear my Cik Su’s blue kurung as I was appointed prefect and needed a new uniform there and then. When I was in standard 6, a friend of my mum’s asked me the exact same question in front of my normal slim friends and siblings. I sadly laughed along with them to cover the humiliation. Then, there was this two aunties gossiping about pairing anak die ni ngan anak die tu, & when it came to me being paired with her son, the response was ‘eh tak nak la, besar sgt’… not that I give a tiny rat ass about her son, but please, I was deeply hurt. Adults are just so MEAN.   I always tried to be normal, tried to have the sense of belonging, especially to my family, relatives and close friends. But it was too hard. When ever there was something new in fashion and every kid was wearing the same thing, I was being left out. When other kids were joyously climbing on ladders and walls, I couldn’t help but think of the humiliation I had to bear should the ladder broke… I was also mistaken as my dad’s sister since I looked too old for my age.   Okay, so I can go on forever with the weight issue. But my point here is, I don’t think that people are really sincere when they say that it’s OK being fat. I’m sorry if you really believe in it, but my childhood experiences proved quite the opposite.  So, every time you hear a friend trying hard to shed the pounds, don’t discourage them, even by saying nice things like IT’S OK, AS LONG AS UR HAPPY BLA BLA BLA… cause there is no such thing! Perhaps you can help by going to the gym together or swimming or not asking the person to dine out evry now n then. But just don’t discourage them. Please. If not bcoz you simply disagree with me, at least think about the health improvement they’ll benefit from it. Don’t be selfish! But be careful not to be too helpful too as we are such sensitive creatures. Just lend a hand when only needed, we might be offended otherwise…

           Fuhh…. It seems like forever since I’ve updated this blog. Sorry people! You must be bored by now… but that’s me… I’ve always been too excited when starting to do something, and then it suddenly dies away when something else comes along…’hangat2 tahi ayam’, bak kata org melayu.       Well, actually, lately, I’ve got this craze for photography… it’s not entirely new to me, but the adrenaline just kept pumping back this past few weeks… I used to indulge myself in this so called ‘arty’ stuff, but it came to a point where I realised that it got too expensive for me that I was soo nervous to shot at anything just in case I’d waste ‘em…eventually, I gave up…        But eversince I went thru this  urlLink girl’s photopages , which I got linked from Judd’s blog, I became soo inspired… she is soo talented yet very humble. She admits of not knowing about those photography jargons (such as shutter speed), but her works are just top notched. She knew how to optimise the functions of her camera, of which for some people (like me) are just something to feel cool about.  You know ,  more functions = cool stuff  !  That’s when I decided to turn back to my Nikon (yg dah terperap sekian lama) and try to make full use of it… it’s not the best in the market, but hey, it won’t stop me from taking some good pictures, right? Plus, it’s adequate enuff for a beginner like me.  Well, that justifies my blog’s black out period then… Oh, by the way, if you wanna see some of my experimental shots, click 'PiCS' on the sidebar... i've updated the photopage. Gotta warn you, they aren't that good, but i still learn sumthin, plus,  there's always room for improvement. So feel free to comment.

      What a weekend!!! You’d probably have guessed where I’ve been to rite? Well, if you haven’t been reading my chatter box, I went to Southampton (Soton) to visit Fitt with Huda and Lenot (don’t ask me her full name, very difficult to spell maa!). It was a Labu-ians get together thingy, and I was soo thrilled and excited beyond words! Haven’t done this in a so long long time…  I’ll try my best to put it into words though…       Sunday , 040404    Gathered at Waterloo- Huda already in London, Lenot came from Cardiff & me from Sheffield… Relieved all over as Huda managed to ‘seek’ for Lenot in the hassle of Paddington Station. Mana taknye, we couldn’t reach Lenot thru her Malaysian mobile line and yes Razief, u’r rite, we did, to some extent, depend on my blog for communication!    During the journey to Soton, as u can expect, a lot of flash back stories came out… to sape2 yg terbatuk2 tuh, ampun maaf dipinta.. I’m sure ur name came out during one of our endless conversations hahahahaha….  We were lucky the train terminated in Soton, if not, sure dah sampai kat Siam dah kitorang.. muehehehheh….  Once we reached Soton, Fitt n hubby (Dr Azhar) took us jalan2 in their new Vauxhall car… Lama giller tak jumpe Fitt, since 1st Year!!! She hasn’t changed a bit, except for the pregnancy bump laa… I mean, I expected her to be a little tembam ke, but noooo, she looks exactly the same! Comel sangat…. If you don’t believe me, go browse my fotopage later! And judging by her house, she’s still the same old Fitt inside too, all well organised and love cute girly decors!   Later that day, our other Soton-KMYS friends, Intan and Atol (also an old friend of Lenot’s, though not Laboos) came to join us. There were a lot of talks about babies and pregnancies… very informative from all my doctor friends (Lenot just got best UKM’s med student!! Tabik spring to Lenot evryone!). There were also reminiscing about the good old days, and the not soo good funny ones, like how ridiculous it was to be penalised for leaving your socks in dorms during school hours and to have to wear tudung evrytime we passed thru our dormitory doors, even to buang sampah kat depan bilik, where boyz would be absolutely out of sight, even from the slightest angles! Perhaps these extreme rules could be sort of justifications on why we behave certain ways these days…muhehehehehehe… alasan! Kehkehkeh….    Back to the current state…It was magical… It just seemed surreal… all this while, I only heard and read about my friends getting pregnant and having babies.. but this time, I actually saw her…. She could have given birth any time soon… 39 weeks already! She so so wanted it to be that day, come on la, 04/04/04 – what a cool birthday it would be! Atol, Lenot n Huda were pretty ermm, how do I put it, nervous ke? Mana la tau kan, kot kot they were the ones who had to deal with the delivery process! Muahahahaha….I can only provide towels and hot water! Hihiihhi…Intan on the other hand, mesti lari lintang pukang sebab panic…hehehehe, just kidding girl!  But, it wasn’t the day.. perhaps the baby was shy…. I hope it wasn’t because s/he was afraid of us, ye laaa…. Gelak tak habis2… it could have scared the baby back in! Maybe it’s true what Lenot said, the baby’s soo comfortable in mummy’s tummy and doesn’t wanna leave…  After dinner (We had the oh-so-famous Star Fried Chicken from Soton), we went back to London. A special thanks goes to Azhar, who kindly drove us here and there, and preparing lunch! Suami soleh ni… Thank you to Fitt, Atol and Intan too, for the lovely time we spent together! What a day! Don’t forget to sms us when the baby’s out ok?   We spent the nite at Huda’s and Lenot slept sooo late (3 am ka?) sebab layan FRIENDS… nite nite…. Nite Nite to my darling Hubby tooo… sian dia kena tinggal sekejap…. Tu la, sape suruh tak ikot!      Monday, 050404    Today, Huda pulak took us jalan2… it was a bit tiring after last nite, but, takpelaa… bukan selalu kan…? Spent some time at an art gallery, which ended up with us kutuk2 and gelak2kan all the ‘arts’ cause we couldn’t even try to appreciate them… so weird la arts people nih…  We had lunch at Mawar and met Whoda and Zeihan… Alamak, kantoi pulak tak cakap kat Whoda that I was around… hehehehe, tak nak menyusahkan sebenarnye… Zeihan looked so pretty by the way! Long time no see laaaa… since KMYS kot…   After our late lunch (around 5 ish) we head to Paddington to hantar Lenot… Sadis seh… After our peluk cium full of drama scene, Lenot showed her ticket to the pak guard, but she was not allowed to take that train because it was peak hour and her ticket was ‘supersaver’…. Heh, 40 quid for a supersaver, what would the full price be then? Cekik darah sungguh British Railway nih! So, it ended up with Lenot sending me off to Sheffield instead…. Although mine was a Supersaver as well, my offpeak train was earlier than hers…. So that was it, my most memorable jalan2 UK since Gna came… Thanks Huda n Lenot for making it possible! Love you girls!  Back in Sheffield, I was surprised to see my sweet Juri with a cup of coffee in his hands when I stepped out the train.. I thought he was waiting for me at home with some hot Nescafe that I ordered…hehehehe….I was going to take a taxi anyway, so, no worries… but he just missed me so much and went to kutip me there… hehehehehe, I’ve missed you too yang! Thank you!!!

      ................                  ..............   I miss home.... actually, I don't know what I'm missing.... pretty  inaccurate to say 'home', cause I haven't even been there... my family moved to Labuan like a year ago, so I didn't get a chance to be there... yet... and, it's already been like 3 yrs that we haven't gathered together...all the 7 of us... me, my 2 sisters n 2 brothers, n my parents... sedih gak.. guess everything comes with a price kan...  you get some u lose some... just hoping that things would turn out just fine in the future....   looking forward to a better life in Malaysia.... amin...

      It’s nearly over…. Only have to study for less than a month, several sittings for exams, and I’m done! YEAY!!!!   Final year project’s finally OVER FOR GOOD last Tuesday – can almost suffocate in the tension in this IT Lab that day – evryone’s queuing up for the printers! Seb baik la we bought that pretty decent printer last year, totally worth the money!  Didn’t sleep at all last nite, typical of us two – leaving everything to the last minute! Hehehe, can’t believe we manage to complete that math assignment early this morning! Nearly gave up and willing to let go that 15%  worth of mark...akhirnye,  dapat gak submit like 3 hrs b4 deadline! Al-hamdulillah…  Hmm, it’s been quiet for like more than a month in here… boringnye!  Oooo haaa, lupelak nak wish congrats to my friend  urlLink Faryna , who just had her gala wedding reception! Pictures (so far) can be viewed at  urlLink Faizal’s fotopage . You look gorgeous in that royal yellow Faryna! Hope to see more pictures coming in!   OK, I guess that’s all for now… I know exam’s near, but I kinda feel like having a movie marathon this weekend… got to make full use of that UGC card ‘aeh? Though got to pay extra for tram, but I think this subscription is cool… not only it makes you ‘have’ to go, but it’s cheaper too…… I mean, for us la, who watch like at least 4 movies per month! Bye!

      Firstly, apologies to all yg bersusah payah visit this site n takde pape perkembanagn!! Annoying, isn't it?? Sorry! Actually, i did write like 5 paragraphs after exam ari tuh, but evrything's gone... tatau laa sebab apa, maybe i accidently hit the wrong button kot... since then, here's what i've been up to:-  -   jadik minah kilang, working my ass off 12 hours shift mon-sat -   got exam results already, 2-1, ok la, not the BEST, but syukur al-hamdulillah, considering the exam was terrible, and frankly, we thought we'd settled for 2-2. -   my bro's coming next week from the states...dunno which one, wisconsin kot.. -   my parents, juri's ma, n my nenek are coming for our graduation later next month, YEAY!! -   joined weight watchers(shut up!) 4 weeks already, lost a stone already (woohoo!), hope it still works when i get back to mesia, n don't just die like my other diet trials.  -   neet to go see my gynae now... so, unless the kilang's shutting down, don't expect anything new for at least another 4 weeks yeah?!   Thanks for dropping by!!!!!!!!!!

      Hellllllllllllloooooooooooo!!  Hehehehe.... told you I wont be updating for some time! The death of my chatterbox says it all! Anyway, i'll put up a new one soon... whenever that is ! So, what on earth have i been up to huh?  Firstly, I went for a brief holiday down to Barcelona... the city of Colombus....... as usual, tak penah reti nak appreciate those historical sights........ so, we all pi ronggeng at the Universal Studios park, just outside the city... the only landmarks that we visited ( just for souvenir sake ) were the Colombus monument and this one church yg dah beratus tahun tak siap2, still under construction lagi (forgot the name of that churh already)... and of course, Hard Rock Cafe, mana lagi... ooo, one more big thing- the nou camp- the ground of fc barcelona, but you can get the details from juri's... plus, i also did some shopping at MNG cause I think the sales there were better than England's... grabbed me self a shocking red handbag and one green addict tee... murah je...hehehe... all in all, love the city so much cause the tube ade aircond and McD bukak till 3am ( you get a pair of slippers with every  Mcmeal too!)  Back to England, went to fetch our family at heathrow airport straight away.... tired but worth all the penat lelah..... really happy to see them.... stayed in london for a couple of nites before going back to sheffield for our graduation day... the graduation went great... what a cliche ! but seriously,  i always had the thoughts that graduations here wont be as grand as the ones held by malaysia's unis... apparently i was wrong, thank god! there were organ recitals (i know it's boring- but i kinda think that it's equivalent to our gamelan la kan...boley laa) and the deans and registrar wore pope-like robes, with some funny looking hats... it was like a fancy dress party held in some castle....... the lightings, the hall and the post-graduation live music just add up to make a perfect graduation...... it made me felt soo proud, kalah org dapat first class...hahahaha.... ohh, one more thing that i would like to boast here - my cerificate says 'Master of Engineering' - not the usual 'Bachelor' !!! seronotnye... jgn jeles! hehehe...  After graduation, it was time for our family to go back...... a little sad, but i'm gonna see them again soon anyway... they did some really serious shopping here that we had to add two extra boxes to ship....... before going back to sheffield, i queued up at Krispy Kreme in Harrods just to taste their infamous original glaze... its my brother's fault la nih... asek cite pasal donut krispy kreme kat US tu jekk... lembut la.... dunkin takleh lawan la... rase nak bukak branch kat kl laa... so, i pon terpengaruh.... and guess what... it's my turn to influence you all plak! mmg sedap sehingga menjilat jari (budak2 US, pls ignore me yg masih jakun dgn keenakan donut ini!!)... ok, if you happen to be in London, pls pls ooo pls singgah di harrods untuk mendapatkan donut KK yg masih panas... they give it free if you queue up... tak payah beli pon! but believe me, once you've tasted it, u'll be mad not to buy it! ok, enough promotion already!!!  ok laa... fahmi needs his laptop now... i think this will be my last entry from england... will be back in Malaysia in 2 weeks time....  one last thing- our good friends - kamalyla are having their first born soon!!!! congratulations and all the best for both of you... jgn lupe, kalo korang tanak, kasik kat aku!!!!! hahahahaha... ok peeps, pray for them both ok!! bye!
