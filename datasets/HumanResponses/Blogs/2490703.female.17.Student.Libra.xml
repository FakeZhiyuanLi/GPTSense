       Friday, December 12, 2003    Hey, I guess it really has been a long time since the last time we talked. I haven't really been up to much lately. I'm starting indoor track this January. It sounded fun and I knew it would be a really good way to keep me in shape. I've been really injured from cross country, so much so that it kept me from running most of the cross country season. I have physical therapy for 6 weeks. It's not so bad, it just hurts a little sometimes. But I guess it's helping me out in the long run.   Jason and I broke up in the beginning of November because things weren't working out for us. He blamed the whole break up on me. It was really hard on Mr at first and I started doing stupid things like cut myself. He hated me for like two weeks. He even wanted to go out with some new chick a week after we broke up. I seriously was so depressed that I massively cut myself. I just couldn't take it. We were such good friends and then we weren't. I think I would have been okay if there hadn't been some new girl. That was the part that slapped me in the face. I thought that maybe he never loved me and he only wanted to stuff from me. But then like 3 weeks after we broke up, he told me that he missed talking to me. Then like the week of Thanksgiving I went over to his house and he and I were talking. He asked me why I cut myself and started to make fun of me. Then out of no where he told me he loved me and by then I had a new guy...Just joking we started unofficially going out again. Then recently we made it official. I promised him that I wouldn't cut anymore, and I haven't since then. It's been two and a half weeks since the last time I cut myself. I'm pretty proud. Unfortunately, there is a Mr. X...Ross. He's a real cutie and he's in a band. So is Jason, but Ross' band is so much better! :) He's a sophomore, but the hottest one there is! No joke. I'll find a picture of him for you.  Other than that I really haven't been up to much. I really don't even go to church anymore. I just stay home and sleep. I really don't know what's come over me. I just don't want to go. I think it's because all of the people at church don't even know I;m still alive, nor do they honestly care if I come or not. I guess feeling like I'm not wanted has an effect on you. I think things have really changed about me. I'm a totally different person, and in more of a good way than bad. Minus the whole church aspect.  Anyway, I'll talk to you later. I love you like a sister...I'll see you next week, can you believe it. We'll have to get together and do something!                                              Peace and Love,                                                    Melissa

       I love the rain! I just hate when I'm out being a band fag and marching and it starts pooring! I was out marching, as we march into the cemetery, it starts pooring!. It would have been pretty awesome, but we had to sit out there for a really long time before we could get in someplace warm and dry. Luckily, that was the last parade that I will ever march in again. I don't mind band, I just wish I played something better...like percussion or guitar. The wierdest thing has been happening lately. Teffticles has been acting wierd around me. He broke up with Justine like a month ago and now he's totally different when he's around me. It's cool because we can actually talk to each other, but I think he's kind of using me. Whatever, I have another person to hang out with now. Anyway, I have to jet, the phone is for me. I'll talk to you later!   Peace and Love,  Melissa

       Sunday's...They are such boring days. I hate that it's raining...BLAH! But other than that I'm happy that I don't have to work and I can sit around and do nothing all day. I totally can't drive for a while. My dad is being gay again, God, I hate him so much. You'd think he'd realize that I don't like him, and the only reason I can't wait to leave is so I never have to talk to him again. I told my mom that I don't want him at graduation again today. She got all mad and gave me the "but he's your father Melissa...blah, blah." I honestly don't care. I hate him and I hope he disappears. It'll make my life 100% better. I'm sure if he actually disappeared I would feel bad, but for now...nope. It reminds me of when Amanda Pringle was telling me this one story about Ryan S. OMG. He was supposed to help his dad unload this four wheeler off a trailer and he was screaming at Ryan to get down stairs and help. The whole time Ryan is thinking, I hope he has a heart attack, I hope he has a heart attack. All the sudden his dad's like, "OWWW!!' Ryan's like, Woo Hoo he's having a heart attack! Then his dad's like "Oww, my leg." Ryan's like damnit. Hey, his dad sent him away and he didn't have to help. That cracks me up. I hope he has a heart attack definitely makes my day. Dag, that kid is so funny! Well, I'm out!   Peace and Love, Melissa

       This is Jenny's story. Read with caution...  Jenny walked into her house, went up to her room and turned on her computer.  She was home alone. It was 5:30 PM, Jenny had nothing planned until later that night so she signed onto AOL messenger with the screen name PrincessJ00 and checked to see if anyone was online. No one was online, so she put on an away message and went downstairs to grab something to eat.  She heated a slice of pizza from the night before and went back upstairs.  Someone IMed her.  Hmm, she thought. The person was LuvMe4Life58. She had no clue who that was, but she talked to them anyway.  LuvMe4Life58: hey  PrincessJ00: Um, hi? Who is this?  LuvMe4Life58: You don't know me, but I sure do know you.  PrincessJ00: What?  LuvMe4Life58: You're pretty. I like your blonde hair and your braces...Don't worry, I think they look good.  PrincessJ00: Wait a second, who the heck is this?  LuvMe4Life58: You don't NEED to know who I am. But....  PrincessJ00: (getting freaked out) But what? Huh? You don't scare me! You're just TRYING to but but its not working!  LuvMe4Life58: It's ok Jen...I won't tell CHRIS that you like him. I'm the only one that knows. I read it in your diary. Just tell me that you'll meet me and everything will be okay.  PrincessJ00: NO! Stop it please... I know this is you Karen! I hate you! Please stop it! (Getting nevus and freshet out, because she didn't tell anyone that she liked Chris)  LuvMe4Life58: This Anita Karen. But I know that Karen is your best friend. And you had a crush on Jeremy, too when you were in 5th grade. I read it in your diary. You hide it in your desk. Left hand drawer, the one at the top. I was  in your room today when you were at school. I left you a little surprise in your closet. Just take a little peek Hun. Don't be afraid, I promise you won't regret it.  PrincessJ00: I don't believe you. NO ONE knows where I hide my diary! STOP please!  LuvMe4Life58: JUST LOOK FOR GOD'S SAKE!  PrincessJ00: NO!  LuvMe4Life58: NOW OR ELSE I'LL GO IN THERE RIGHT NOW AND KILL YOU WHILE I'M AT IT!!!!!!!  PrincessJ00: OMG! Please stop!   LuvMe4Life58: No, I won't kill you. But I just wanted to let you know, if you don't look in your closet- your parents won't be coming home tonight!  PrincessJ00: FINE! If you want me to, just PLEASE don't hurt them PLEASE!  LuvMe4Life58: Thata girl. A little bit closer. I see you- you know that right? I'm outside your window and you look great in that white blouse.  PrincessJ00P: Stop! PLEASE! Who the heck are you?  LuvMe4Life58: LOOK in the closet right now!  PrincessJ00: I'm going, please, just leave me alone!  As she walked closer, her heart beat so hard she couldn't control it. She held onto the doorknob to the closet, twisted it, pushed it open and saw......  THE DEAD BODY OF CHRIS HANGING FROM THE CEILING OF HER CLOSET! Horrified, Jenny ran to the phone and tried to call the police. As she picked up the receiver, a hand grabbed her from behind and said, "you don't want to do that." The voice then turned Jenny around and she saw it was Michael, the quiet boy in her math class. I've been watching you Jenny, and I love you. Jenny struggled to get away but Michael held her tightly. He threw he down on the couch and tied her up with duct tape. "I said that I love you Jenny and I'll do anything to have you. Screaming, Jenny says, "NO, NEVER! LET ME GO, NO, STOP!" Michael knocks her out and says, "If I can't have you, no one can!"  When Jenny wakes up she feels really weird and she doesn't know what happened. She sits up and realized that she doesn't know where she is. She looks around for her clothes and finds nothing. Scared Jenny tries to move but he body is too weak to move. Jenny tries to call out, but nothing comes out. She blacks out again.   When Jenny awakes, she sees a man standing over her wearing all white. She tries to call to him but he puts a hand over her mouth and tells her to be quiet. The man picks Jenny up, wraps her in a sheet, and walks down a long hallway out to a dark car. Jenny was never seen again...  Be careful who you talk to...This could happen to you.  **Isn't this a creepy a story?***

       It pisses me off so bad when people bash Paris Hilton. If you looked like her, wouldn't you flaunt what you've got. HONESTLY! Oh and gay kid, I don't want to be Paris, I just hate my real name, it's so common and that's so not me. SO, I HOPE YOU DIE! I'm just joking, but back off Paris, she's beautiful.

       Today has been such a boring day. I haven't been up to much at all. I honestly slept all day. It was kind of nice. Last night I went to a "get together". A lot of people came and left. There was a party at Mark's house but people weren't allowed to drink. So people from the party I was at went to Mark's party and told them that there was a keg at our party. It was crazy. People were getting mad that there wasn't any beer. There was a lot of smoking going on. I didn't smoke anything because I was the designated driver. Besides, I really want to give that stuff up. I got home really late, like 2:30, and I got grounded. So I'm home today and my parents took my car keys for the weekend. It sucks so bad. I need to get out of this hell hole, my parents are driving me crazy. This is the last summer that I will have to deal with them, then I will be free! I honestly can't wait.   I leave for CMU the second week in August. My official orientation is on June 9th. It's so awesome, I can't wait! I'm actually kind of tired so I best be off. I hope you have a great weekend! I'll talk to you later! Love you lots!                     Peace and Love,                        Melissa

       Last Day of school! Woo Hoo! I'm really excited, it's been a long road that hasn't been a smooth ride. Looking back on the past 13 years of my life, I have changed so much. I'm not the sweet child that I once was. I'm going to miss the security that high school brings and all the friends that I'm never going to see again. It hurts so bad just to think about it like that. Oh, the horrible crushes that I've had on younger kids, ones that will never be made known. Regrets, If that's one of the only things that I ever got out of Mrs. Fraziers class, I have learned that living with regrets isn't any fun. Live life to the fullest and set forth goals that you want to achieve and achieve them. I wrote an essay on that today. I'm going to miss Mrs. Frazier's class, Honors English was hard, but the year FLEW by so quickly. It seems like it's going slow, but then you're done. It seems like yesterday I was a freshman looking forward to starting high school and making new friends. I'm sure College will be fun, but the reminiscing will never end. It seems like yesterday that you and I were close together and I also remember the day you left for Ohio. I cried so hard, I knew that I was going to miss you so much, and I still do. I about lost it when they played our class song over the PA and you walk out into the commons and there are a bunch of people crying...Guys and girls that you have known your whole life pretty much and they are gone. It's just incredible. I taped a little bit of the madness and the tears. The last day of high school is a crazy time because people tell others how they really feel. It's an emotional day. It's a day I will never forget. I counted down the hours, but when it was all over, I cried my eyes out. Cleaning out my locker I couldn't believe it, you know when you know things are going to change and you get that feeling of hurt like you don't want to let go, but when you do, you know it will be for the best. I felt that way today as I opened my locker for the last time. I can't wait for graduation.   The Missionaries came over today but my parents weren't home. I talked to them for a while and they were really fun. The new one that we have is really cute, I shouldn't say that, but he is. I'm such a dork. He told me he hoped to see me at church, Maybe they know something. Like I'm a bad kid now. I'm trying to be the "perfect" kid again, but it's really hard to give up those bad habits. I'm sure with a little bit of effort, I will.  OMG! Yesterday the scarcity thing happened. I was driving home and My tire exploded. The car tiped a little but I just thought it was flat so I coasted to the stop sign to see how bad the damage was. I got out and I was so scared. I don't have a cell phone right now, so I'm stranded in the middle of nowhere with no phone and no where to go. I prayed that someone would help me and a man stopped and asked if I needed a phone. I started crying. I called home and no one answered. So I called Amanda Pringle because she was like 5 minutes away. I was so scared I cried when I heard her voice. She drove me home and my mom and our neighbor came and fixed the tire. I was seriously so scared. Luckily all went well and I didn't die. But it was still scary. But I have to go, I have some work to do for the open house! I love you like a sister!                       Peace and Love,                          Melissa

       Bag-heads...OOGLY BOOGLY! AHAHAHAHAHAHA!  Hey Howe, I finally got your blog...took long enough. I can't believe that I only have 2 days of school left. Crappy thing happened though. We had this really funny senior prank that we were going to do, and someone told on us. I was so mad. We were going to get hundreds and thousands of bouncy balls and put them in a hallway and shut the doors so when people came out of class they would be like OOH, bouncy balls. But no, now the teachers are all "prepared" for it and if they catch people doing it, they can't walk at graduation. Isn't that SO gay? I was pretty angry. But I guess I'll have to do something else...I have like a day to think about it. I wonder if they have a senior prank.com...I should look. I'm sure there is, there is EVERYTHING on the internet. Hm....What else has been happening? Did I tell you about that kid that I see everywhere? He is so hot...AHHHH I want to know his name. I'll figure it out someday. OMG! I have the funniest thing to tell you. Yesterday Amanda Pringle and I were driving home from school and we were waving at random people. It was so funny. We'd make wierd faces as we were waving it was so much fun. While we're driving I'm like we should get bags and put them over our heads then go out with them on and wave at people. We then got the bright idea to cut out eye holes and draw on faces. So we make these bags...we called them bag heads. We go out in my truck, Amanda is the only one wearing a bag on her head, and start waving at random people. It was so funny. They would give her and I the wierdest looks. AHAHAH. So we decide to go to our friends houses and do crazy things in the bags then run away. So we go to Laura Gadzinski's house...she wasn't there, but her brother Steve was...it was so funny. He was like Melissa you are so wierd. After, Amanda had to babysit, but her car was broken, so we drove around until we had to pick up one of the kids and go back to the house to watch the kids. After we're all done we go to Kevin Melvin's house. I park the truck where he can't see it and start walking up his driveway with these bag-heads on. We get to his house and he didn't know who it was until her and I started laughing and chanting oogly boogly....oh man. It was so much fun. What would you do if 2 people walked up to your house with bags on their heads chanting wierd things like oogly boogly smoogle? Oh man...It hurts so much from laughing so hard. I honestly had so much fun being SO stupid! Well, I have to go 39 page review packet due Friday that I haven't started. I'll talk to you later!  Peace and Love,  Melissa

       Yeah, I'm having one of those days. It's not a really good day, but   it's not a really bad on either. I'm just sitting around filling out graduation stuff. It's crazy, 7 days left. WOO HOO! I'm going to Cedar Point tomorrow for Physics. I'm pretty excited. My group is just Amanda Allmendinger and I. We'll have fun seeing as how her and I both aren't roller coaster people. It should be great fun. Are you coming up for my open house? I'm not sure what day it is...My mother keeps changing it. It's like she can't make up her mind. Oh well, whatever day it is, you should come! You could possibly come to my graduation if you come up for the weekend. I graduate on June 6th. Just let me know hun! Um...Your thing didn't save. I don't know if you saved it. Nothing has really happened today. I went to school, cheated on my physics test, went through the rest of the day. After school I went to Physical therapy for the bum leg...now I'm home typing to you. How did you're thing go for the ticket? I hope well...Hopefully you still have a driver's license! I still haven't talked to my dad. I told him I didn't want him at graduation...like he actually cares. He's only going because my mom would be mad at him if he didn't. The way I see it, he didn't care for 13 years...why does he all the sudden care. Oh Wait...he doesn't. But yeah, I have to go finish my things. You'll be getting one in the mail soon! I love ya hun! Talk to you later!  Peace and Love,  Melissa

       Man, life sucks so bad sometimes. I wonder how I make it through the day sometimes. This morning was a total bummer. I woke up late and I was rushing around for school. I ran up to take a quick shower and I got into the bathroom when I realized I forgot a towel. I ran into the laundry room and I dad pushed my little brother into the bathroom. I was like what the heck?! He started yelling at me like everything was my fault. I was crying my eyes out. I told my mom later that I didn't want my dad at my graduation because he hasn't cared about me for the past 13 years, why does he all the sudden care? I don't want him to ruin one of the most important days of my life. I just don't want to go through the crap that I have been on graduation day. I now know why Travis hates dad so bad, he's such a jerk. I was looking back and my dad has never cared, or hardly cared. I remember when I told him I was excited to graduate and move on with my life and he kicked me into the refrigerator and Travis saved me from further beating. Or how he was always too busy to go to soccer games or track meets. He never came to any. How sad is that? I remember him telling me that no matter what I did, nothing I ever did would be good for him. It made me so sad. People seem to say that to me a lot in my life. It seems like no one really loves me, they just love to see me hurt a lot. It's such crap. I'm just glad that I have you for a friend to get me through the tough times. I don't know where I would be with out you. I spent the day up at MSU with Amanda and all of her friends there. I didn't really fit in because I'm such a minor, but it was better then the family ward and home. Isn't is sad to say that any place is better than home. I was always taught home should be a safe place...so much for that. I just hope things get better...Trials make you stronger, but I'm done with that! I need some smooth sailing...maybe a boyfriend that treats me well. Yeah right, funny joke. I hate being so NEGATIVE! I found this guy though who fits the profile... 1. He has VERY nice shag hair...SO HOT! 2. He plays guitar...or and he sings! 3. He is a skateboarder!  On top of all that, he is so nice and he is good looking which is a bonus. haha... I miss you so much. If you come up this summer we'll have to hang out and TP people. It'll be so much fun. Hate crimes rock my world. But I have to go hun. JASON is online acting like David again and I really can't deal with him again. I love you girl. Talk to you soon!  Peace and Love,   Melissa

         Wow, Things have massively changed since the last time I wrote in here. Jason and I broke up. He has been sich a dick to me ever since. He tells me he wants me to die and tells people lies about me...so that's pretty cool! But I'm tough and I make it through. Mr. X is still a hottie, too bad he's too young. Well, maybe he's not TOO young! hahaha...  I met someone new. He's a real sweetheart and I love to be with him. There is just one problem...he has a crazy girlfriend who has taken over his life and changed him completely. He's still sweet, but she's changed him, almost brainwashed him. I miss the old Zore! The bad thing is, so do all of his other friends. They want me to break them up so the old Zore will come back. I feel really bad because I don't want to lead him on and then break his heart. I know after he breaks up with her he'll never want to talk to me again because he'll realize that is is all my fault he broke up with her. It's such a soap opera. I tried to tell him what people were feeling, but I think I only made things worse. I feel so bad. Who does that...hurt someone they love? I wish I could go back in time and change the way things went.   I'm one of those people who try to please everyone. That's why I cut. If I couldn't fix everything I felt so bad, like it was my fault there were problems in the world. I hate being that way. If only I were a normal person, I would have less scars and more happy memories. I think the depressing me keeps all the boys from becoming more than just my friend. Or maybe it's Jason's fucking lies! I feel bad for him. He's new girlfriend is such a slut. She is really nice, but she likes her boys. I went to this concert and I guess they were making out...I wasn't there. As soon as he left, she was all over another guy. That is so sad. He's a jerk and stuff, but he really doesn't diserve that. Well, honestly he does. He needs to feel the hurt for once. How mean is that? I guess that shows how much he hurt me.   Other than the 2 major things going on in my life, I've been really happy. Only 9 days of school left! How crazy is that. I honestly can't wait. It seems so wierd. I'm going to graduate and never have to go back to the hell hole of High School. It seems like a dream. I'm sure I'll meet lost of cute guys up at CMU. I've decided a guy needs 3 things for me to like him...Shag hair, skateboards, plays guitar. AWESOME...I can't resist a shag! They should have a great personality and of course, they would NEVER lie to me!   I was talking to Teffticles, he's so much fun to hang around when it's just him and I. We talked about a lot of stuff. I feel like I can actually be myself around him and that's kind of nice. We were joking around about him being a doctor and me being an attorney then we'll get married and have 2 twin boys and live in a huge house and be rich. Everyone's dream...Wierdly enough...I could picture that happening. AHHHHH! But I best be off. I love you hun! talk to you later!  Peace and Love,  Melissa

       Another boring summer day. I like summer...When it's actually warm! I was supposed to go up to CMU today to get a job thing, but I changed my schedule around so I have 4 day weekends and classes 3 days a week. Yeah, mom. She helped me. All I have to worry about is if the transfer. I'm so excited for college now, other than the fact that I'm not going to see Ryan as much anymore. I'll see him when I go to MSU because it's closer to home. Sadly, I'm going to have to live at home for a little bit because housing around there is so expensive. It's kind of crappy. But, I'll be closer to most of my friends, They are all going to MSU or LCC so it'll be okay. I have so many jobs to apply for tomorrow. I found this one a coffee shop. It sounds like a really cute job. Then I have an interview at banana Republic tomorrow. And I have an Application for Kohl's. So I hope I can get a good job so I can actually have money to spend on things other than college. All I can say is welcome to being a poor college student. But yeah. I have to go. Talk to you soon!  Peace and Love, Melissa

       The Open House is finally over! I'm so happy, that means no more cleaning the house at 8 a.m. EVERY MORNING! It was a lot of fun, I wish you could have been there. I miss you so much. A lot has happened this week. I went Carp Shooting with Andy and Ryan. It was so much fun, no joke. What you do is go out onto the lake when it's dark and shoot at carp with a bow and arrow. OMG, it was so fun. I just held the light to spot the fish because I'm not strong enough to pull the bow back. Anyway, Ryan drove me home and I had been joking with him about not getting my goodnight kiss after Homecoming. So I got my good night kiss. Over the next few days we hung out and stuff and last Tuesday we started going out. He had to leave on vacation Thursday, and he's coming back tomorrow. But in the process of him leaving...Amanda had Bob from Wisconson come over. They were an item kind of. But Amanda likes some other guy and they broke the whole thing off. So I started hanging out with Amanda a lot more so Bob wouldn't have to be so alone, just because I'm a nice person. Anyway, we were tie-dying yesterday, because we're hippies, and we definately had a lot of fun. But I had to go seeing how it's Father's Day and I should spend some time with my dad. Bob calls me later but Kevin keeps calling for Amanda so he has to go. Well...Amanda calls me back and tells me she and Bob were talking and Bob has a little crush on me. It's so cute. Bob and I talked on the phone until 12:30 when he had to go to sleep because he has to get up at 7! But we're supposed to hang out today, which will be pretty cool. He's rad awesome at the guitar which is cool. I LOVE THE GUITAR! But I also love Ryan. I can't get him out of my mind. All this drama. Hahahaha. Well, I gotta jet. I have a shower to take and a room to clean!   Peace and Love, Melissa

       Hey! I finally got a job! WOO HOO! I work at a day care in Howell. All I do is clean. It's kind of nice. All I need now is a second job so I can actually spend of the money I'm earning something other then college. OMG! I didn't tell you, I got hypnotized at senior lock in. It was pretty funny. The guy had us put our hands together and did this thing and told us to try and get our hands apart. Yeah, mind wouldn't come apart. It was a good experience. He made us relax then he was like I'm going to tell you a joke and it's going to be the funniest joke you've ever heard. He said the first word of the joke and I started laughing SO freaking hard. Man...Then he would say think of something sad...Then he would say Indian and we would all crack up again. Hahahaha...I'll have to tell you more about it later because I have to go take a shower.   Peace and Love, Melissa

      It feels good to relax for once! I have a couple of open houses to hit today, so I really can't chat long. Former President Reagan died today...He was the president when I was born! Weird, he died the same way my grandma did. They both had alztimer's and they both contracted pnmonia. But yeah, I just got home from Eliene's open house. She's so pretty, I'm jealous. But I gotta run! I'll talk to you later!   Peace and Love, Melissa

       School is out! It wierd how people used to be "better" then you when we were all in school together, and now that we're out, we are all finally good enough to talk to eachother. It's so retarded. I was picking up Tyler from school today, and I saw some people that I know, but I'm not tight with. One of them came over and started talking to me. We talk because of band and we had 2 other classes together this year, but before this year I had never talked to him in my entire life. It's wierd how when things are starting to change, people come together. I always thought things like that were wierd. Like after 9-11 people started having American flags up and they supported the president and all this crap. Then the war starts and the people of America are like screw Bush blah. I just don't get it. People are just wierd. But anyway, I have to jet, I have adresses to type up and thank you letters to write. Hope to see you soon!   Peace and Love,  Melissa

       Yeah, I haven't been up to much today. I went shopping with my mom. I like to go with her, she buys me stuff. It's so awesome. I got some new shoes today. It was the last pair left on the shelf...Actually they were the display shoes. Anyway, I'm talking to this really cute guy online. He goes lives in East Lansing. He's so nice. I'll have to send a picture. Anyway, I have to jet, I have soccer stuff to take care of for Amanda. I will talk to you soon!  Peace and Love, Melissa

       Hey! Guess what? Dad let me drive his Jag today! I was super excited. I think it's because I was really sick last night. I was up late reading this book, it was really good and I didn't want to put it down. I was reading when I got this huge pain in my side and I couldn't breathe really well. It totally freaked me out, but I ignored it and kept reading. But it got worse so I went up to my parents room and I was freaked out. So I was all hyperventalating and they finally calmed me down and I fell asleep at about 2pm. My dad stayed up and made sure that I was okay for about an hour. I woke up at about 5pm and went back to my room. It was a very unpleasant night! But I made it through and I'm feeling much better now. I have so much to tell you and I think my mom said that you were coming up next weekend or something? I don't know. I was supposed to go get my nails done but I got grounded for not telling my parents where I was going. Well, I pretty much got grounded for yelling back at my mom, apparently it's "Disrespectful". But you know, she didn't ask where I was going so I didn't tell her. That's just how it works! It's called the don't ask, don't tell rule. But yeah, I move out in 26 days. I'm happy and nervous at the same time. GRRRRRR! You know what makes me mad. Okay, I get into huge trouble for not telling my parents where I was going right. Amanda steals my mom's credit cards and they take away her TV and VCR/DVD player...but no other punishment. Isn't that so gay? I was so pissed off. She does something horrible and nothing happens. It's not fair! Parents are so dumb sometimes. But I have to go. I think I'm going out into the sun for a while!  Peace and Love, Melissa

       I am really bored right now. My mom woke me up early today because supposedly my housing payment for CMU is due Sunday, but they hadn't sent us a bill yet. So we're looking all over for a bill they may have sent and online for a number to call or a place to pay. We finally found the number, and guess what...they changed the date of payment to August 16th and they didn't bother to tell anyone. So that was eventful. But other than that, I've just been working and packing my stuff up to go to college. I'm half excited and half not. I'm so excited because I'm getting all new stuff and I get to leave home and all the exciting stuff that happens to college. But I'm not going to get to see most of my friends...oh and Ryan, except for like once or twice a month. It's crappy, but I'm sure with all the fun of college, I'll be able to deal :) OMG! I had this dream that Laura and I were in a room with 2 girls...and they were LOVERS! Wouldn't that be horrible? I'm sure they'd be cool and all, but I'd be so paranoid all the time. Aha. Well, I gotta jet. I love you like a sister!          Peace and Love,      Melissa

       28 days until I start a new chapter of my life. Wow that sounds like a book! "28 days until the new you" hahaha So how have you been? I've been okay. The more I sit around and think about leaving, the sadder I actually get. I actually like working so I can keep my mind off things. It's so sad because Ryan is never home and when he is home, I'm at work. It's going to suck so bad when I go to college and he is still here. My mom said that I can come home once a month, but you and I both know my mom and if I called for her to come get me, she would drive all night to get to me. I love that about my mom. Ryan is big into hunting and stuff so during October-December pretty much I'm never going to see him. It sucks. I know people say change is good, but right now I'm pretty happy with my life. I'm not saying that I'm not going to like college. But I already made it a goal in my life that I'm going to get as close to a 4.0 that I can in college, no matter what it takes. I want a career. A weird thing happened. I went to this church thing with my mom and there were a lot of mothers that talked and one in particular caught my attention. She said that her whole life she wanted to be a teacher. When she got through a year of college she got this feeling that teaching wasn't something the Lord wanted her to do. So she prayed about it and she just knew that she was supposed to be an accountant. Something similar happened to me. I was registering for classes at CMU. I said that I had intended on majoring in law when this thought went through my mind that I shouldn't be an attorney. I didn't listen and I registered for some law classes. Last night I had this dream that I became a psychiatrist. Weird, I talked to Ryan about it, and because of the many problems that I have been through, I might actually be able to help someone because I probably experienced something similar in my lifetime. I don't know...what do you think? I honestly think it might be a good career that I could deal with. Anyway, I have to go. I love you Kira. I'll talk to you soon!          Peace and Love,    Melissa

       So, I've had an exciting week with Travis home. He met and approved of Ryan, and Ryan even survived with no serious injury. Actually no injury at all. But sadly they are leaving. I'm going to miss them. Janell is a person that I can talk to and trust with my secrets. It's going to be sad when she isn't around. Ryan isn't even home today...I'm so BORED! Oh, I skipped work today, so that was nice. Maybe I'll get fired! WOOT! Well, I'd rather quit. I start my other job tomorrow, 8-5 pretty much everyday. It's crap. But I have to jet, I'll talk to you later!  Peace and Love, Melissa

      It's been a while since I last wrote in here. I got a second job at Banana Republic. I haven't started working at that particular store because it isn't open yet, but I'm sure it'll be loads of fun! Travis, Janell, and Nathan are here from Wisconson. I've missed them so much. Nathan is getting so big. He'll be 1 in August. It's hard to believe a whole year has flown by. It doesn't seem right that I'm not going back to FHS...which in no way is a bad thing. College, here I come. Anyway, I hate the day care job and I wish it would just end. Hayley and I decided that we're going to Warped Tour 2004! YEAH! I'm super excited. Maybe Ryan will be able to come now that he knows the right date! That smart Andy, he told him that it was the 8th. That kid needs to lay off the pot. Anyway. I have to go, I have to go feed the baby! OMG! TORE IS HOME! I missed him. But yeah, I'm out.  Peace and Love, Melissa

       I'm so mad at Ryan. I'm crying because I'm so mad. I called him so I might actually be able to talk to him before I went to work. So he answers the phone and before he even says hello, I hear Andy Marr say "She's a bitch, tell her that's from Andy." then some girl laughed. I'm so upset. After he finally said hello, he was like can I call you back. I was like if you're lucky. I'm so mad! He told me we couldn't do anything today... Now I know it's so he can hang out with his other friends who are clearly more important than me. He's leaving me for the weekend then I'm LEAVING for college and I'm not going to be here to ignore! You know what's sad, Amanda said met a brother of a friend who is my age and I guess he's really cute. I just thought about calling the guy so I could piss Ryan off. AHHHHHH! I'm so mad, Kira I don't know what to do. I don't think I'm going to talk to him if he ever calls me back. I know that I'm not...I have to go so I can cry to myself in my room.  I love you like a sister.                                    Peace and Love,                                             Paris
