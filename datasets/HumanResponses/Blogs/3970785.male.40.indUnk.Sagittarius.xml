Van Gogh’s Moon  tonight the hemlocks form my room my night-light looks like Van Gogh’s moon everything will be changing soon  could go just about anyplace but south and I don’t own the keys to anyone’s house.  but my night-light is a Van Gogh moon yeah everything will be changing soon.  there’s a bottle of fire here by my side and I’m steady burning down the last of my pride  but I feel the glow of a Van Gogh moon and everything will be changing soon.  sleep will be coming to these mountains soon me and this here Van Gogh moon hoping everything will be changing soon.   © pettit

						   more brain fertilizer...(also possibly categorized as intellectual shit)...coming your way. the purpose of which is to stimulate your dying mind into activity...any activity. i want you to think, and think, and think...then act. go do something.   i want you to feel, be inspired, get pissed, try, look closer, touch, meet yourself, find your path. tell me what you think, tell me i'm an idiot, fight back, jump on board, speak up...post your comments and begin a dialog...a conversation.   paddle your raft. look for a moment through different glasses...from a different angle. the truth is not contingent upon the viewer's point of view. stand somewhere different and find out if things look differently...if a path appears. it is quite possible that you just might look at the rock you are under from a different angle and find that there is a beautiful gem on the other side. turn it over and see.   today's quote comes from me...made it up myself...for myself mostly...but i'll share, because i am hoping that for you one of these times a spark will catch.    "without action today    tomorrow is promised    to be as empty    as yesterday."         simple, i know. and i shouldn't have to explain it...but for the dense, it means...get off your ass. if you want something different...you have to do something different.

						   some women have it...fairy dust...a spirit full of concentrated sunshine...they rule any man they touch...and the men long to be touched by such a woman. i know one like that and one of these days i just might show her this poem.   She rounds the corner  ashine with gleam  leading the sun  by a string  and with a single smile  it seems  turns&nbsp;the autumn  back to spring.   &nbsp;© pettit

						   &nbsp;huh? repent? for what?&nbsp;what did I do wrong?  &nbsp;oh...i was born, i get it. i was born, therefore i am going to hell.  &nbsp;what a concept.&nbsp; I will spend&nbsp;my life making up for something&nbsp;i didn't even do.   &nbsp;ah...anyway, that's not my point. the point is... what is wrong with religion .  &nbsp;and... what is not .   &nbsp;there are principles and characteristics that apply to all religions. um... like the central purpose and reason for creating religion...to control people. religion was, is, and will always be some form of government. the purpose of which is to conform, regulate, dictate, control, oversee, organize, etc...etc...the people or members of that group.   &nbsp;nevermind your own personal and emotional ties to your personal beliefs or religion...oh, i know, you have found the only pure and holy religion ever created that does not seek to suck your wallet and conform your thinking...nevermind you...i'm must be talking about the guy next to you.   &nbsp;religion is an institution created by man for the purpose of uniting people under a common system of thought that will in turn make those people more likely to follow a particular leadership...as a result...religion has made really powerful governments, armies, and businessmen across the span of time and the globe. and if you don't think religion is a business...slap yourself.   &nbsp;also, because religion has to protect it's resources it naturally prohibits the acceptance of competing businesses...i mean religions. therefore...only your religion is the correct and true path to whatever that final goal is...heaven, enlightenment, whatever. now, if you accept my theory that all religion is man made...that we do not possess the capability to understand or describe the metaphysical...that all religion and ideas of deity are simply uneducated guesses...then, my friend, you have to accept that the meat of your religion is a crap shoot and if you strip away the power of possessing the only real truth, you have nothing left but a well organized club, organization, business, government, etc... are you with me now?   &nbsp;that is what is wrong with religion...it is a fraternity that uses the fear or hope of the unknown to control our actions, behavior, thoughts, morals, and our wallets. and...this a big one...it prevents it's members from seeking out wisdom and truth from alternate sources.   &nbsp;so, if all that stuff is wrong with religion, what could possibly be right about it?  &nbsp;hang with me.   &nbsp;i believe that part of being open minded, or sincerely seeking truth, is having the ability to pull out...glean...absorb... wisdom from any source while, at the same time, ignoring bullshit that comes from the same source. you filter your water don't you? cigarettes?   &nbsp;this planet has hosted a multitude of great minds that have produced untold amounts of truth and wisdom that can be applied to any life in any generation. seek out the good...the stuff you need...and can use...leave the rest for the buzzards.   &nbsp;that said...religion offers something that some people are missing. for those that reject organized religion, and, or a belief in a higher being, are left to find truth, meaning, peace, hope, etc... alone. they are basically left to themselves to create&nbsp;meaning out of the universe.   &nbsp;religion, while greatly flawed, in my opinion, can offer to the average joe, a pre-fabricated belief system, a set of morals, a sense of belonging, and purpose. basically, if you are a good follower, no matter what religion you are involved with, you are likely to be a "good person."  &nbsp;why? because that is part of the purpose of religion...good people are suppressed people, controllable people, and controllable people open their wallets when they are told to.   &nbsp;so i say...if you want to be a part of a religion...fuck yeah...go for it&nbsp;dude. so why would i say that?  &nbsp;think...think, with me. if it makes you a better person, more compassionate, more generous, a better parent, employee...and an&nbsp;all around better human, then of course you should do it. nevermind the fact that your leaders are making the shit up...nevermind that they want and need your money to build shit...nevermind that you are told what to think and believe. the point is...they have taught you to be a better human than you once were.   &nbsp;that is the point. improve yourself...the vehicle for improvement is basically irrelevant. if you outgrow them, fine, move on. if you know someone involved in religion, don't chastise them, don't waste time trying to help them see the fallacy of their belief system...praise them, encourage them. for, they are the same as you and i...we all are trying to figure out this mystery of life, and we all are trying to be something better, get to someplace better. do your thing quietly...be an atheist or anarchist or whatever label you like this year...all that bla bla bla is just talk...because remember, we all are just guessing.   &nbsp;don't make too big of a deal over your choice of guesses...cuz in the end you might be the one that is embarrassed.  &nbsp;now...go live in peace...be a better human, any way you can.

						   &nbsp;what is attitude?&nbsp; you know what it is...especially when you see a bad one... one that you'd love to adjust for someone.   &nbsp;we all think of attitude as a state of mind...either it is good or bad, right? well i think there is more to it than that. attitude is your pre-chosen outlook.  &nbsp;look at attitude in a slightly different way...the word attitude is also used to describe an aircraft's position during flight...but wait there is more...it describes the craft's position in relation to the horizon...the ground...the un-movable...uncontrollable...the absolute.  &nbsp;now apply that to your personal attitude...your mind set...attitude is your...and mine...since we all know that i really only preach to myself...  &nbsp;anyway...attitude is your mind set, your chosen outlook...in relation to...in response to...what?  &nbsp;the freaking immovable...uncontrollable...the absolute...the ground...the world...translate that into...all the possible situations you encounter daily...attitude is not so much your outlook on life.  &nbsp;it is your reaction...to life. to all that shit that flies up in your face every time you turn around.   &nbsp;so here is where this can help us...it is very difficult to tell yourself...or to manifest a global desire to be, for instance, "a happy person."&nbsp;we have to break it down to manageable pieces...which on a daily basis is....your attitude. get it?&nbsp;choosing to be a certain type of person is far too much to manage, but pre-selecting the "attitude" you will select in response to the uncontrollable events of your day is achievable...sounds good anyway.   &nbsp;so...choose your flight path in advance. for example, choose beforehand to respond...to react...in a positive way to negative energy in your path...choose to ignore conversations that tear others down...choose to do more than is asked of you...fill in the blank.   &nbsp;by looking at attitude as a pre-selected pattern of behavior in response to the uncontrollable events you encounter it is possible to maintain your altitude...your spirit. it does not matter how high the mountains are...how deep the shit is...you have already programmed yourself to fly above it.   &nbsp;so fly above it. choose your attitude. maintain your altitude.   &nbsp;

						   you should recognize this regular feature by now...and no, it really does not get posted every single day...but it is the part where i dig up some piece of wisdom, or truth, from some mind far superior to yours and mine...so take the freebie and make it work for you.   &nbsp; "art is simply a result of expression during right feeling. it's a result of a grip on the fundamentals of nature, the spirit of life, the constructive force, the secret of growth, a real understanding of the relative importance of things, order, balance. any material will do. after all, the object is not to make art, but to be in the wonderful state which makes art inevitable."    &nbsp;-robert henri  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1918  &nbsp;&nbsp;

						   &nbsp; &nbsp;mmmm...the failure, the depressing feeling of failure.  &nbsp;those 3 steps backwards days. &nbsp;when...you don't take the higher ground, don't anticipate, don't give, don't work your plan and move forward. those days...when you loose ground...have done nothing to better yourself, myself, and done nothing to help anyone else either. &nbsp;i hate those days...today.  &nbsp;i imagine that if i could just go back to sleep for another double handful of hours i perhaps could wake up refreshed and new...a whole new attitude... &nbsp;but no.  &nbsp;i am here. in this day. facing my failure...depression...all the things they say are terrible about me...have risen up and taken a life form.  the&nbsp;rest of the day will be spent&nbsp;fighting demons...if you have a god, put in a good word for me.

						   &nbsp;ok...quote of the month...or week...or the quote of your miserable life...   &nbsp;  "in short, i want to reach so far that people will say of my work: he feels deeply, he feels tenderly - notwithstanding my so-called roughness, perhaps even because of this.  &nbsp;it seems pretentious now to speak this way, but that is the reason why i want to push on with full strength.   &nbsp;what am i in the eyes of most people? - a nobody, or an eccentric and disagreeable man - somebody who has no position in society and never will have, in short the lowest of the low. very well then, even if that were true, then i should want to show by my work what there is in the heart of such an eccentric man, of such a nobody."   &nbsp;Vincent Van Gogh  &nbsp;second half of July 1882  &nbsp;letter to his brother Theo

						   i am great. no, really i am, i'm great.  &nbsp;by that i don't meant that i am greater... than you, for example.  &nbsp;nor am i the greatest. but i am great.  &nbsp;i have greatness in me. inside my soul or spirit lies the ingredients of greatness.  i believe that you also possess those ingredients in some degree. we all possess the potential to be great. but why do some achieve greatness while others do not?  &nbsp;the answers to that are surely too many to address here, however i will take a shot at one or two.  &nbsp;i imagine greatness to be a seed. a seed inside us all... a built in part of the human spirit. that seed, like all seeds, must meet favorable circumstances to germinate and it must also be cared for or fed the proper things to survive and fulfill its full potential. it's called husbandry.... to care for...to nurture.  &nbsp;my idea is that greatness must be watered, fed, pruned, nurtured, and even exercised or it will dry up and die.  &nbsp;so how do you feed your greatness? how do i exercise my inner greatness to make it stronger and perhaps someday show it&nbsp;through this fucked up exterior facade?  &nbsp;higher ground. by taking the higher ground.  taking the higher ground in every situation requires self awareness, listening, giving, yielding, thinking and action.&nbsp; higher ground is a reference to war strategy, in that the one that claims the higher ground first is likely to be the winner and the general that prepares in advance for battle may never need to battle, for he knows that he has already won. higher ground...and the peace that it brings is a security, a confidence, or an understanding that you cannot be attacked, and if you are attacked you cannot be defeated and if you are defeated you cannot be killed because you are... prepared.  &nbsp;you are prepared...that means you have done your homework...you have...ready for this?...  anticipated.  you have thought out all the options and you have chosen actions and positions that your opponent has not yet even realized exist.  &nbsp;now apply this to your every day life... convert the war scenario to everything you do and everyone you encounter... because you are thinking ahead, listening, and preparing... there is no person that can take you off your chosen track. the circumstances of the day, or the traffic on the interstate, or what every is for you a thorn...none of those things can put you off center, for you and i have anticipated their attack and have already minimized their efforts to harm. the arrows of their bows strike only dirt.  &nbsp;your path is of your choosing...and not a reaction to un-anticipated events.  &nbsp;the individual, any individual that first recognizes, in spite of emotion, self esteem, or current circumstances, that they indeed posses the seed of greatness...has in effect already achieved greatness. that is step one. and those that take step one...will not be able to step backwards.  &nbsp;water your seed.   &nbsp;remember this... giving what is expected of you is not giving...that is payment.  &nbsp;receiving what is expected from others is not receiving...that is payment.  &nbsp;take the higher ground and give...give the unexpected.  &nbsp;feed your seed of greatness.

						   so i took this trip to santa monica to hang with beast boy for a few days and take some pics for his musical endeavors and what not...i chilled around the joint, cruised up and down venice beach, sat with the homeless, bought shit from the street vendors, and generally kicked back enjoying a different lifestyle.  &nbsp;the night before i flew back home beast boy tells me that we&nbsp;were going over to a friend's house for a jam session...tells me to bring my camera shit and my new djembe drum...hell yeah, we gunna thrown down some vibe!  &nbsp;in the car&nbsp;he tells me that we are on the way&nbsp;to corey feldman's crib, evidently they had become friends while working together on an upcoming cartoon.  &nbsp;right on man...redneck georgia boys gets to hang out with some fame-ola... maybe i could steal some toilet paper a shoe or something i could hock on ebay.( c'mon, you know better than that...i'm not a thief)  &nbsp; we arrive, hang out for a while...watch beast boy's dog, timber, dive under water in the pool and make the&nbsp;typical famous people chit chat...the normal stuff. finally, we go upstairs and begin&nbsp; the jammin...well previously i had taken my camera gear upstairs, which was way too much...i looked like the one man paparazzi with two cameras, a light meter, a big honking flash gun, and my official khaki photo vest...geeze what a nerd. feeling like a total goober in the movie star's personal home i hid my shit behind a chair so it wouldn't be so obvious that i was only there to sneak provocative snapshots for the national enquirer.  &nbsp;so we jam...and jam...some dude on a bass is thumping out some cool lines while a genius is bending his guitar into balloon animals...a real pretty lookin guy with sunglasses is whacking on a drum set as beast boy sings and corey is trying to break his keyboard and sing like he was at a real concert...me, i was banging the shit out of that little goat skinned drum of mine. it was cool...real cool...especially since i don't have a damn bit of musical talent...i was a faking mutherfucker.  &nbsp;corey's home seemed to me like a regular normal suburban home, nothing really fancy...there were plenty of self indulging artifacts from movies, there were pictures on the walls of him on sets, there was a note written by michael jackson in 1998 on a dry erase board...something about an apology for how the way things turned out and an offer of better times for the future...anyway...i admit i was a little thrown off center by the whole thing. i'm not a star chaser but it was cool and i didn't want to be the dick from redneckville whipping out more camera gear than can be found at a victoria's secret fashion show. that is why when it was time to leave i gathered up my shit and headed straight for the door in hopes that corey would not see or remember it...or me.  &nbsp;in my haste...oh, in my haste...i left a flashgun behind. it wasn't a nuclear reactor but it is a few hundred bucks worth of plastic that i damn sure need. beast boy said he would snag it for me and ship it overnight....uh...this was about four weeks ago.  &nbsp;i suppose i can't blame anyone but myself. i hate the fact that i most likely will have to buy another flash...and i hate the fact that beast boy can't handle such a seemingly simple retrieval...but the bottom line is that i left the damn thing there.  &nbsp;i have sit, sat, sitted...usually intoxicated, and fantasized about all the ways i could commando my flash back...things like a prank call from someone important, like spongebob...or flying back to LA and breaking in to his house..only to be caught and jailed as a stalker... for christ's sakes guys...can't you just sent me my little 'ol flash back...a couple hundred bucks is alot to me...  &nbsp; at some point i may have to let this all go...accept the loss. then again maybe it is not such a loss after all.  &nbsp;perhaps by osmosis...or default...or one of those other words that sort of means...automatically...perhaps now i am sort of in a way kinda maybe famous? i mean, do you know anyone personally that has been to corey feldman's house for a jam session? know anyone that can sit around and say things like..."Ah man, remind me to call corey and get my damn shit back."  &nbsp;this could be my only brush with greatness...this may be my legacy...i may never accomplish anything more. so in some way i can just coast on in...i have reached a pinnacle. i can loosen the necktie of expectation, at last.  &nbsp;at the very least i have secured for myself a tale that is sure to be repeated every year at thanksgiving for the rest of my life...in increasing amounts of exaggeration, i'm sure.  &nbsp;I can almost hear them now...  &nbsp; "There goes the old drunk geezer again telling that lie about the time he was roommates with corey feldman."...

						   remember that movie?...damien the little satan bastard?  &nbsp;an omen is an event or phenomenon believed to be a sign or warning of some future occurence.  i bet there have been omens in your life...little things that give hints to your future...like the kid that chokes cats as a kid grows up to be a mass murderer...stuff like that..except not as extreem...lets hope.  &nbsp;as a child there was an event in my life that could be described as an omen...my mother would certainly say it was an omen or at least a devilish moment. that event was the evidence that I was forever going to meet rules and structure with disdane. if i had only realized this truth much earlier in life i may have avoided so much strife and unhapiness in my attempts to conform to the sterotypical suburbanite... see?...shoulda followed my compass.  &nbsp;i was in kindergarten...it was show-n-tell day. now show-n-tell day is about one of the most important days...its right up there with a field trip...its your time to stand up and get some damn recognition...to wow the crowd, knock em&nbsp;off their feet. geez did it ever suck when i had nothing super cool for show-n-tell.  &nbsp;well on this day...i was packin serious heat. serious fucking heat, my friend. earlier in the week i had found, well the cat found it, but i captured it. what? oh, a lizard.  &nbsp;not just a lizard but a big ass ugly lizard. this was the biggest lizard any kid had ever seen and most adults too...this thing looked like someone had chopped off the first eight or nine inches of a rattle snake. major cool shit, that lizard was. big, ugly...undoubtably deadly...a real man eater, had to be, just had to.  &nbsp;oh yeah...i couldn't wait for that damn show-n-tell day...ronnie pettit was gunna be the hero of the entire school...a regular celebrity, yes sir i was. i had that big 'ol lizzard stuffed into one of those clear plastic bug catcher things...you know, hourglass shaped with little plastic plants in it and a magnifying glass. oh, and the plastic bottom that does not stay attached, uh very securly.  &nbsp;&nbsp;i sat there all day with my big ass monster just waiting...and waiting...and waiting...geezuz!...is it time yet! finally, we had the show and tell...everyone was in awe. i might as well have been marlin perkins in the flesh...i was the beast master. (grunt, grunt, grunt)  once &nbsp;show-n-tell time&nbsp;was over i felt the backside of adrenaline...an almost depression...i rationalized that the euforia of that moment was not enough... i needed more. i wanted more adventure, excitement...or perhaps i just hated school already and wanted to raise some hell.  &nbsp;whatever the reason or motivation...i did it. i bent right over at my desk and i did it. i opened that container and i let that sucker go.  &nbsp;let him right go. damn sure did.  &nbsp;he looked like a&nbsp;hellbender clomping across the tile floor under the desks and around the feet of children. i was smiling ear to ear. couldn't help it.  &nbsp;the rest of the story is a little blurry and i don't remember who the first person was to see the man eating beast running across the floor, but i remember it was the teacher who screamed the loudest. and like any good lizard in the classroom story mass histeria broke out while i did my darndest to look as though i did not know what was happening. of course when pressed i denied any involvement in the liberation of the lizard.  &nbsp;somehow he made into the coat closet and before long the janitor was standing there with a pair of pliers looking for the thing. within a few minutes more adults gathered along with the principle and in a few more minutes all activities at the school ceased. they shut down the school to deal with the man eating lizard incident.  &nbsp;that poor janitor, an older black gentleman, was shaking in fear with those pliers in his hand...he went in to the dark closet, skuffled around, then exclaimed..."I got him!" cheers rang out as he held up the lizard by the tail with those pliers.  &nbsp;well everybody with any lizard catchin experience knows you don't pick a lizard up by the tail...and right on cue, the tail broke, the lizard fell, everyone screamed and off he went again across the floor. it scared the janitor so that he dropped the piers and we all watched in amazement as the lizard's tail lay in the floor wiggling back and forth all on its own.  &nbsp;imagine how proud i was to see all the events unfold like a scripted movie...genius, pure genius.  &nbsp;the lizard was finally caught and disposed of properly, the tail was at last gathered and thrown in the trash...and shortly thereafter my mother was promptly called and told to pick me up and take me home. i can 't remember if i actually got into trouble for that, i suppose my dad was in vietnam dodging bullets and the sort and my mom, well she has a soft spot for animals anyway.  &nbsp;i think that was the best day of school i ever had. if i was just a little more introspective i could have identified the omen. or if my mother was more perceptive she could have noticed and steered me in other directions in life.  &nbsp;alas, the sign was missed and as result i have struggled ever since. my advice to you is...go with your strong points.  &nbsp;what events in your past revealed your true nature? and why are you still ignoring it?

						   hey i know him...he's the guy that does the oxy-clean infomercials, right?  &nbsp;actually an oxymoron is...A rhetorical figure in which incongruous or contradictory terms are combined. (I looked it up)  &nbsp;so today after pumping some iron at the gym i rolled the f150 down to blimpie for some grub...i was thinking about "love" of all things...then it hit me...not love, but a realization...an oxymoron.  &nbsp;actually this may not fit the strict definition but you will understand, maybe. what type of love do we all need and want most? unconditional love. we want love that has no strings attached, pure unconditional complete love.....  &nbsp;well, jackwad,...love by definition is.....da dadada....UNCONDITIONAL!....  &nbsp;plain 'ol love...right off the shelf, in stock love contains everything you and i want and need...no special ordering neccessary...  &nbsp;bottom line...if it aint unconditional...it aint love.  &nbsp;now &nbsp;go home and talk that over with your significant other and come back tomorrow and let us know which one of you slept on the couch.

						   change change change... for the better. &nbsp;i know this guy... like a... no, better than a brother. we can call him Mr Wendel ...(I saw him eat off the food you waste.) {that was a reference to a song, for you un-cool folks} &nbsp;Mr Wendel...middle aged or damn near it... single... got his shit together. well at least he has the appearance of having his shit together...and compared to you and i, he does. he is one of those guys that has more character in his worst turd than all the rest of us muster up after a jerry lewis telethon. &nbsp;so, while the rest of us are consuming ourselves with stupid shit like dr. phil's latest fat woman story, Mr Wendel is giving to charity... quietly, discretely and regularly. yeah, big deal, i know... i hate the shriners too... or anyone that stands at intersections with a bucket and a sad face. &nbsp;Mr Wendel decided that he would no longer give money to things like churches and the regular assortment of bullshit... sorry mr. pope man, sir. he decided that he would give to a local, a national, and an international charity of his choosing. pretty cool i thought. i mean, compare that to what you and i are doing for anyone, or anything. &nbsp;his local charity is an organization that helps young kcnocked up chicks that are willing to give up their babies for adoption rather than abort them. he was adopted himself...so makes sense right? his national charity is some type of cancer research joint, cause his father has cancer and has lived 4 years past his&nbsp;expiration date&nbsp;with the help of experimenta drugs...again, make sense. his international charity is&nbsp;an obscure charity called "the smile train." the smile train trains doctors on the simple procedure of correcting cleft pallets in children. ok? i'm thinking yeah...big deal. &nbsp;see, the procedure only costs about 250 bucks or so to do...but few docs around the world learn or perform the task...yeah...ok. and corporate sponsors pay all the operating costs so that 100% of donations are able to go directly to the field. &nbsp;so, again...big deal, you give to a poor little fucked up children's charity... but then he told me why. he said...(paraphrased) "dude...the most basic thing you can give to someone is a smile, and these little kids can't even smile...these people give them their smile...without their smile, they are fucked." &nbsp;hhmmm.....shit. &nbsp;see i told you Mr Wendel had character. and you all thougth he was just the typical bad influence drinking buddy. ha ha ha ...you fools. &nbsp;wake up. what are you doing?...what am i doing for someone, anyone, or anything outside&nbsp;the little bubble of self indulgence. what a power it must be to give, to help freely without regard to return or recognition. &nbsp;get your ass out there and try it....i am.  &nbsp;here is a link if you wanna check em out for yourself...  urlLink http://www.smiletrain.org/   &nbsp;

						   &nbsp;i love it when a plan comes together... i mean i would love it... if any of my plans came together. truth is... they are, or i am, headed in the right direction. 3 years, thereabouts, since my divorce from "my baby's mamma" and i am just now... just now digging my fingernails into the lip of this black sucking hole of misery.  &nbsp;you just gotta make a damn plan... make a plan, any plan... make a goal. visualize. draw a map... step one, step two... &nbsp;the hard part is putting my pride into storage while i crawl slowly back towards the light... i can't actually see the light, but i can feel it... i know it is over that way somewhere. like following a compass and map... you gotta trust your compass. yeah...trust your compass, dummy. &nbsp;shit... yeah... &nbsp;trust your damn compass...if that doesn't bloody your nose i can't help you.  &nbsp;

						   just a quick note to let everyone know that i have finally figured it out. the mystery of god. no, really i have.  &nbsp;the wisdom of all the ages has fallen upon me and enlightened my mind....ok, the least you can do is follow along for a minute and consider this...  &nbsp;first of all you have to agree on a few basic principles...first, that the universe as we know it was put into motion by something or someone...the notion that we came out of a random accident is just plain stupid to me...look around...look at your body...the complexities and infinite workings of this world just could not be an accident. so, if you are with me on that, we are well on the way to higher understanding.  &nbsp;if this place was created or set in motion by some creator then i would submit that we do not possess the ability to understand, fathom, describe or relate to such a power. the creation of this world lies beyond us. it is a complete different language of which we know nothing and understand nothing. all we have, know, and understand is the trace evidence of this master piece of craftsmanship.  &nbsp;still with me?...  &nbsp;i'll get to the point...the sources of our creation is beyond the limits of our imagination...it occurs outside of our box...therefore there is no way for us to completely understand or describe or relate to that creator. yet since the begining of our time here we have sought to put theses things beyond our understanding into terms and languages that we can relate to...in short...we as man have guessed. we are guessing...if it is beyond our limits then all religion, all concepts of god, diety, creation, etc...are nothing more that the best guesses of man. our hopes. our desperate need to explain the unexplained. we have and continue to create our own tales to fit our culture and times. always have,&nbsp; always will.  &nbsp;so if the highest thinking of man is nothing more than a guess...then even my own ideas are as plausible, important and as valuable as the greatest of religions and philosophies of diety.  &nbsp;get it?  &nbsp;it is beyond our realm....we all are guessing...from the begining of time...just fucking guessing...and therefore...my damn guess is as good as anyone elses. yes...my own idea is as valid as the freaking pope's.  &nbsp;the power of that realization is not that i can start my own religion...but that i am free from the guilt of man's religion. he is only guessing at the right anwers...if i go to heaven...or hell....the forgiveness of sins...all just guesses.  &nbsp;i am free. i am free live without the guilt of measuring up to the standards of the religions of man that seek to conform the group into&nbsp;unthinkers. that is the basic dynamic of a group...to enlist the individuals to conform to the identiy of the group.  &nbsp;the more time you spend with the group, the more&nbsp;you think like the group and the more you think like the group...the less you think.  &nbsp;now, go children and be free.

						   yes I know that the diary of misdirection is a stupid name for a journal. what the fuh? I was under pressure and couldn't think of anything else...besides...have you not ever felt like your life has been mis-directed? thrown off track? lost?...  &nbsp;Liar.  &nbsp;I have to admit that I do. I don't profess to be a freaking genius...well actually I do profess to be a genius but that is purely dilusional and at least I can admit it.  &nbsp;back to the story...so, sometimes i do contemplate the possibilities of what my life may have been like if i had made different choices....like that first wife....or the second one.  &nbsp;ah, well...at least i can hold on to the hope that i am getting older and perhaps in turn wiser.  &nbsp;what&nbsp;a mind blower to realize that my life is at least half over...and what do i have to show for it? shit...nothing but shit...i have to get my ass busy. if i am going to take over the world...make a difference, say something important, change lifes...change my life...create a body of work to leave as evidence of my existence...shit...i need to get out of this gray ass cube and hit the pavement...  &nbsp;by the way...what are you doing today to get closer to your goals?...  &nbsp;you do have goals, don't you?

						   ever have those sentimental daydreams? Thoughts about some one from your long ago or someone that has effected your life in some way, good or bad?  &nbsp;I was on the shitter thinking about the stomach cramp I was working through and wondering if it was partly the result of my increase in drinking over the last two weeks.&nbsp; I decided it was most likely a combination of the drinking and the leftover fajitas, but anyway. I thought about my grandfather. Not the good one.  &nbsp;I thought about that mean son-of-a-bitch tommy wright. That's what my mother called him. she always said he was just a mean old drunk. I guess he was a mean drunk.&nbsp; And when he died they said that he had more malt liquour in his blood than he had blood in his blood. no one cried at his funeral either, in fact there was some dispute about putting him in the ground next to my beloved grandmother, mary ruth.  &nbsp;In spite of being a mean drunk, I wonder what the hell his story is, or was. Maybe he was mean for a reason? Maybe he was pissed off at the world, just about like I'm pissed off at the world.  &nbsp;I can almost see myself someday sitting in a rocker on an hot old porch down in nigger town dumping salt into my schiltz while fanning away the flies and yellow jackets. He did it. Did it for years. In fact that's all I remember him ever doing, that and yelling at people.  &nbsp;"Son-Runt" (That's what he called me) "Close that goddamn screen door boy, your a lettin all the flies in. "&nbsp;  &nbsp;No one knew just&nbsp;quite how to take his love, I don't think.  &nbsp;I was just sittin there on the shitter wondering if I got his mean genes. I reckoned that&nbsp;I might turn out to be a drunk, a pissed off drunk that hates the day and the night even more. I dunno...maybe so. But I also think that if I had been through World War II, or if I spent all my damn adult life in a cotton mill living in rented shacks I might be a little cock eyed too.  &nbsp;When the cotton mill in Canton shut down they had to move to Atlanta to work. They lived in one of those shacks where you pay by the week, they lived in the same one so long they could have bought fifty of those places. It was one of those kind of places that let light in &nbsp;through the spaces between the boards when the sun was low in the sky.&nbsp;I remember going with them sometimes to pay the rent at some mansion on West Paces Ferry and thinking that something just didn't seem right about the whole thing. They were wonderful people and how could any landlord be so mean as to make my grandparents live in a shack like that?  &nbsp;I suppose that's just a part of living in nigger town. Really there was not all that much different between those black kids and me. We all had the same dirt on our bare feet and we all collected the same empty coke bottles and bought lemons and packs of sugar from the produce man. I reckon we were all niggers.  &nbsp;And niggers we were. But if I can't&nbsp;dig me some lessons&nbsp;out of&nbsp;that mean drunk son-of-a-bitch there&nbsp;may not&nbsp;be any crying at my funeral either.  &nbsp;Here's to you tommy. What is it your trying to teach me? I'm listeing papa, I'm listening.

						   actually it is the song of last week...and since I have zero music ability execpt for the djembe drum that i beat the crap out of on a daily basis...you could call the following a poem if you can't imagine any cool music to play in your own background. trust me you don't want to hear me sing it. This is the result of last week's series of conversations with my girlfriend in which she so eloquently listed in various ways all the reasons she does not want me. My only real response were these words... &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;aint tryin to hurt nobody  im just trying to be somebody  tryin to be somebody  just about like me  &nbsp;  no i aint tryin to hurt nobody  just tryin to find somebody  yeah to love somebody  ah just about like me  &nbsp;  but i cant find nobody  just cant find somebody  yeah to love somebody  just about like me  &nbsp;  don't wanna talk to nobody  so&nbsp;tired of somebody  gettin tired of everybody  just about like me.  &nbsp;

						   The psuedonym (or how ever the hell you spell that fancy word) unjust writer is a play on my father...a reminder...a stone in the pocket if you will. " Unjust Rider Seven " was his call sign during one of his tours of the Vietnam war. I always wondered why called it a tour. &nbsp;We were working together to write a book about his experience there and the events that led up to the TET offensive in and around Siagon. I said we were working on the book together, that was until he found out through my mother that I was fucked in the head and was going to a shrink and taking meds for stupid shit like depression and anxiety and obsevive compulsive behaviors, but those are stories for later... &nbsp;At any rate we are not exactly best buddies at this point in time, and , well...I feel like I was there anyhow, so I took the name and twisted it to fit my needs. Is there such a thing as post traumaticstresssyndrombyproxy? Nevermind, I won't make excuses. I have made my own choices and tend diligently my garden of consequences.

						   the tentative lover... she pencils me in. sitting, standing, waiting again, i hear my name spoken less and less often. hoping for word and searching for a sign, a scrap, fragment, or trace, a secret message in her face.  the tentative lover... promises, almost, perhaps, probably to never leave and boasts about attention from men, she so deservedly receives. she hangs like a lantern from burning string, swinging in a late, late, summer breeze, waiting and waiting and waiting, to seize, the dry, dead, longing leaves.  the tentative lover... marks the men, noting the temporary tangibles hanging from them. she points to classy watches on wrists and suggests that i should be like this. I try to explain why my cup is cracked as she smiles, and sighs, then crosses her thighs, and halfheartedly presents how she likes it like that.  the tentative lover... in ecstasy exclaims how there is no greater, drenching dance, burning passion, pure romance. we lay lapping the waves of midnight sleep, her facing right and me to the left, floating the peace of afterglow rest. “have I, have I, passed the test?”….”wont know, wont know, till I’ve loved the rest.”  the tentative lover... a dangerous flower, the mesmerizing, pulling power. what began with a breath full of hair and the touch of her hand, now ends in dismantling of a perfectly good man. I’ll bolt me back together, elbow to hand, might have to learn a new way to stand, have to, have to, I will , I can.  ©pettit

						   sigh.  at work. not working...dreading going home.  depression sucks.  thinking about my options for the evening...  i could get drunk. i could go by my almost x-girlfriend's house to pick up more of my shit. i could get drunk. or, take some drugs...and get drunk. i could go to the bar...and get drunk. i could sit alone by the pool...and get drunk. i could sit in my apartment...and get drunk. i could get drunk...and beat on my african drum. i could take a walk...then get drunk. i could get drunk...then go grocery shopping. i could do a load of laundry...while drinking.  yeah...tuesday. tuesday is a real tricky day...can't wait till wednesday.

						   i would like to apologize in advance to any sensitive females...ah...hell, nevermind. screw you. you already knew i had the mentality of an 8th grader.  this post is for the guys...or perhaps for any of the girls that might want to talk nasty...nassstie...to their mens. it is simply not appropriate to use certain words or descriptions in certain conversations...for example, you would never tell a lady that you would like to shoot sperm all over her ass. no. that is just too crude and is likely to have negative overall response. therefore it is necessary to make such descriptions and acts of affection...less...uh, more...friendly, gentle, polished. you have to paint a better word picture...sell the sizzle.  a better way perhaps, would be to say something like..."mmm mm mm...oh baby...would i love to spread some of my  man-mustard  across those buns."....see what i mean?...totally smooth and sophisticated!  so, to help all you that find yourself in passionate conversation with a love interest you may want to pull from the following list of phrases and terms that can serve for alternate choices for...sperm.  mr wendell and i have spent many an hour working on this list for all of mankind and in my graciousness i now share with you a partial sampling. legally we own the copyright to these terms and if you ever find yourself using them for financial gain you will have to obtain written permission and pay royalties. if however, you need these terms in a moment of desperation in which it is absolutely imperative that you completely impress a lover...then by all means...fire away...and send us a thank you note.  the  term-o-sperm  list...or the  sperm thesaurus         ball butter  rod relish  man mustard  schlong salsa  johnson jam  goober goo  nut jelly  cock custard  baby batter  love juice  crack spackle  pearl gel  monster milk  sack soap  thigh icing  panty glue  salty sauce  pie filling  sex syrup  gash glaze   the list goes on...but this should be enough to pull from for your next romantic rendezvous. now, go forth and make a good impression!  next time we will explore " pick-up lines that slay da bitches "... or the " genitalia dictionaria "

						   living without television...is...is fun. not really. i mean it's not bad...but it's still not fun. all that time spent veggin' on the couch now has to be spent elsewhere...helps that i don't have a couch either...but i have a kick ass vintage vinyl chair purchased from the antique shop for 50 bucks.  i don't have a television...or a computer either(except at work)...so my dilemma is...do i buy a t.v. and sign up for the rip-off of the century...i mean cable? that's damn near 80 bucks a month if you want the beloved HBO.  or  should i buy a computer...and get the high speed internet? hhmmm decisions. i really cannot decide. i asked my boys...who visit every other weekend...one wants t.v. the other wants internet. i honestly don't give a shit for either one...but the reason i started all this is to mention how weird it is to be out of touch with reality...or the reality as portrayed on television...  see the only television i get to see is either at the gym or the bar...neither one has sound...so i have to watch which ever one has the closed captioning turned on...it's like watching foreign films, only worse.  so today i found out while at the gym that...the hurricane, what's his name?...missed somewhere and hit that other place and screwed up a bunch of shit. also, michael jackson makes a court appearance today and there are a bunch of people outside the joint wearing funny t-shirts...unless there were typos. then i saw, i mean, read...that the prez is changing the way we deploy troops...gunna takes some from there and put 'em over here and rearrange some shit to make it work better just in time for an invasion...or an election...not sure which.  so...thank god for closed captioning...or i would be really out of touch.  other things that happened this weekend while hanging out with my boys...Luke, 8 and Taylor, 13. all while bubblebabe spent the weekend in bars meeting new friends, "as usual" quote-unquote.    "hey dad, you could go over to that gym at your apartment and start working out and get into shape"..."uhm, son...i work out almost every day...i AM in shape...can't you fucking tell?" (o.k. i left out the " fucking  "part.)  "dad? dad? dad?...put the black lite in the bedroom...we need one in the bedroom"..."no son, this black lite is for the den...that's where the party is...i'll buy an extra one for the bedroom if we need it."  while grocery shopping guy style...with no actual food in the cart that requires cooking...as we turn the corner and head down the beer isle..."Now this is what it's all about, right dad?"..."yes, sir son...one of these day's you'll know what i mean...beer is good food."  "dad?...why are we buying fresh flowers?"..."because son...we are sensitive guys...and, well, we want to pretend there is a woman around somewhere."  As we go down the candle isle at walmart..."Dad's turning into a girl...dad's turnin' into a girrrl."..."shut up son...am not...we gotta do something to get the stink outta the apartment."  "dad...i'm back...went over to look at the cd's then i realized that this is walmart...they all suck."  "then i went to play the video game...but some little kid beat me to it."...uh, well son do you think the three of us could kick his butt?"  while playing pool at the local tavern..."luke, i think that little chick over there is checking you out dude."..."yeah, i know...she kept staring at me over at the video games."  also while at the tavern...luke pics up his shirt enough to show me...his little penis moving under his shorts..."look dad!...i'm making it move!"...."uh..what?...son?...what in the world are you doing?"..."dad, i'm making it jump."..."oh!...well then...right on son, right on...that's a great trick, i like to do it too, by all means carry on."

"is anyone goin'    to san antone   or phoenix arizona      anyplace is alright   as long as i   can forget   iv'e   ever known her."

						   i thought i would pass...he he heheh...i said pass.  i thought i would pass on some wise advice to those unfamiliar with southern customs. sometimes even us rednecks forget the rules and need a good remindin'.  you know those road side stands that sell fresh homegrown fruit and vegetables?...they sell honey and jams and usually some kind of cement yard decorations too?  well the authentic ones also sell boiled peanuts. and boiled peanuts is some kinda good, i don't care where you're from....hot...hot and salty...mushy and almost slimy...good.  a bag of boiled peanuts cost about 3 bucks...give or take. and you don't have to worry about how much a "bag" is...no one weighs 'em...and no one really knows how many is in there...and no one really worries about one stand having bigger bags than the next.  see, the universal unit of measure for boiled peanut stands is the "scoop"...the scoop. yeah, you get two...maybe a little more if you are a good lookin' woman wearing some short...i mean real short, cut-offs. but anyway, all the peanut boilers evidently buy supplies from the same catalog...they all use the same damn scoop...some might call it a ladle.  well, my point is...it doesn't matter where you buy your boiled peanuts. if you get them from an official road side stand, they will all have about the same amount per bag.  each bag of boiled peanuts contain damn close to 3 servings...maybe 4 if you have a skinny girl in the truck.  that's the part that you have to remember. each bag is meant for 3 or 4 people. that's why you always see a car load of people at the road side stands...that's why the guy selling the peanuts always looks at you sideways if you buy more than one bag...and you're not driving a church bus.  so for all you northern types and all you southerners that have been too long in the city...next time you are driving through the country and get a hankerin' for some boiled peanuts...remember they are meant to be shared...think of it as a bonding activity...kinda like drinking...no one likes to drink alone...and if you do, then something is wrong with you...same thing...don't you eat a bag of them peanuts all by your self.  that's my advice.  trust me.  i remembered all about it this weekend...and thought i should share it with you.  well, truth is...it was less like i remembered and more like i was reminded, but you understand.  things overheard around the campsite this weekend...   hey, you brought boiled peanuts!...two bags?  oh...my...your eating boiled peanuts AND drinking budwiser?  ummmm...ron? you gunna eat that whole bag?...all by your self?  was that a burp?  is someone cookin' a pot roast?  they need to empty the trash cans around here...there's some bad chicken in there.  what was THAT?  did you hear thunder?  OH...MY...GOD!!! what IS that...that, smell?  huh?...what?  i need me another bud...wise...er.  yeah...the skunks are pretty common around here.  what exactly IS a "pole-cat?"  please!...you're spoiling our dinner!  how are we all gunna sleep in this camper with you?  i'm just gunna go sit outside in the dark for a while...i don't feel so good.  it's after midnight...think you might need to take a walk to the bath house?  hmmm...which one of these stalls has the most toilet paper in them?  hey, ron? don't forget to take this other bag of peanuts home with you. uh, naw...you guys can have em...no really you take 'em. no...you. really. please. i mean it. you.

						   have i told you the story about dreamweaver?...no not the song...the guy?  i met this guy...his name is dreamweaver. when you are homeless and insane you get to make up your own name...cool eh?  i promise that there is a life lesson in this story...the problem is that it may take most of your life to figure it out and by that time it will most likely be too late to apply it to your own life...but in a nutshell i think it has something to do with looking beneath the surface...beyond the obvious...into the soul.  it was while on my trip to santa monica to visit beast boy. my first day. beast boy had to go to a casting call, or to do a voice over, or some other type of hollywood type stuff...the kind of stuff that pays the bills so he can spend more time surfing and eating tofu.  while he was running the roads i decided to step out of my box and go hit the beach...his apartment is right on the beach...oh yeah. being the photographic freak that i am i decided to take a couple of cameras down to the beach and take pics of whatever i found. and yes i looked like a total goof ass with 3 cameras and a khaki vest...but whatever...no one knew me...and this is cali baby...anything goes.  i walked down the beach...looking...looking...looking...uh...everyone looks just like everyone else.  boring.  i took a pic of a big fat dad putting lotion on his big fat son...and i do mean big...and i do mean fat. i'd hate to see the woman that birthed that dude...huge...but i'm sure they were nice people with great personalities...forgive me.  i made my way on down to the famous santa monica pier... i say famous, because i have at least heard of it before. hey...i'm a georgia boy.  there were people on bikes...and skates...and skateboards...jogging, walking...riding all sorts of wheeled contraptions rented from beach side stands. it was almost more than i could take in...like standing in a crowded mall. i decided find a spot to stand and just watch...i wanted to make myself invisible so i could people-watch and find some real freak to shoot...with my camera, that is. you know, i was just looking for that unusual street occurrence to capture on film.  so as i was standing there hiding beside a tree i saw this guy that was obviously homeless...he was stretched out on the grass in the sun...just kicked back with his shoes off and his hands behind his head. i watched him for a minute or two then decided that i was going to force myself to walk over and talk to him. so i did. i eased my way over in a round about way like i was just inconspicuously looking around for a place to lite... i said something like..."Hey there buddy, mind if i have a seat?" stupid i know...it was like asking a girl out on a date or something...it never sounds as good in reality as it does in your head.  he said..."yeah...man...help...your...self."  we exchanged a few greetings, and maybe i made a comment about the wonderful weather, then i stretched my hand out to introduce myself...  "My name is ronnie" "Hey, man...i'm dr%&*$# We*&amp;%errrrr" "danny weaver?" "no man....D R E A M...W E A V E R rrrrr." "Ahhhh" i said..."cool, dreamweaver" "right on man, cool name"  he sat up to sit indian style. his feet were almost black with dirt as were his hands...well, he was pretty damn dirty all over, for that matter. his hair was long and nasty, parted in the middle with a string tied around his head to keep his hair out of his eyes. he had various found objects tied around his neck, an empty sprite bottle, and some sort of sling pouch around his shoulder.  we sat there talking about places we had been before...i told him i had hiked most of the appalachian trail and he told me he had walked one path that goes from canada to mexico...I said, "the pacific coast, or crest, trail, or whatever it's called?"  "yeah, that one...i walked from one end of the country to the other, man...but that was a long time ago." I had my doubts about that but i nodded in confirmation and continued the conversation.  "Hey man...what is that thing in your pouch?" "Oh, my flute?" he replied, and pulled the white object from the homemade carrying pouch. it was a pvc pipe with holes drilled in it and wine cork shoved into one end.  "Cool man!" "You made your own flute?"  he said ... "of course i did" just like everyone could do the same. so i asked him how he learned to make a damn flute...i mean, shit...how does a freaking homeless dude know how to make a flute? he said i learned while living...."bla bla bla"... i don't remember the exact place he mentioned but it was some indian reservation i believe.  he held the plastic flute up and began to measure off its dimensions...  "see, the length of a proper "c" flute is the length from the elbow to the wrist bone. and the placement of the first hole is measured with your pinky finger from the bottom of the flute. the next 4 holes from there are placed at intervals equal to the second knuckle on your index finger. then you measure up 2 knuckles and offset by one finger's width for the last hole, which is the one you blow into. finally you find a good cork and shove into the top...now that's for a good "c" flute...it's different for each type, ya know."  Uh...trying to keep up...i said..."Well how to you drill the holes?" "with a pocket knife, of course." "oh, yeah...a pocket knife...right." i came back.  After the flute building lesson he offered to play for me and i welcomed the offer and requested amazing grace...with his prodding.  he rang it out...and sang between notes. he then played some old jackson brown tune and then stopped to talk with me some more. naturally i asked him where he was from...he just said that he was a hopi indian...without missing a beat i said..."cool, i'm cherokee." "right on man. wanna hear a hopi indian song?"  of course, i accepted and he began to play the flute again and sing with his eyes closed...  "the earth is my mother... my grandfather the sky... the rivers are my sisters i will drink from them and not be afraid..."  he put the flute down to continue singing and perform the appropriate hand motions and humming as i sat watching on this patch of grass just beside the busy concrete pedestrian freeway. if anyone even noticed or looked our way i cannot say, for i never took my eyes off of him. i was in that moment with dreamweaver, totally unconcerned with the self-conscious thoughts that typically demonize me.  after he finished his song i asked if he would mind if i made a portrait of him. in an automatic panhandler tone he replied with tilted head and smile..."can you spare some change?"  "of course i can brother"  then he asked me why i take pictures...i told him that i take pictures because it is in my soul...at that point he began to almost preach to me admonishments of doing what i love, following my heart, and the sort...finally i said...  "dreamweaver...the thing i love about taking pictures is that i am telling a story...i am telling your story...and i have only a fraction of a second to do it...what do you have to say? what does anyone have to say? in one fivehundreth of a second i can tell your story...that is what draws me to this."  he said..."yeah....cool man...right."  so i took a couple of shots of him sitting there on the grass...one with his legs crossed, one with his flute...one of him laying back with his arms behind his head...he was loving the moment and enjoyed posing for me. after i finished he said..."now let me take one of you."  "ok" i said, and handed him a camera... he said..."just don't sit there, here hold my flute." so i held his flute as he directed me to smile and throw up a peace sign...so i did and he held the camera at an angle like a new york city fashion photographer and snapped one off.  i began to gather my things up and handed him a five dollar bill and told him that lunch was on me...he thanked me with a "oh man...i didn't expect that much."  "don't worry about it dude, it was worth it." I shook his hand and thanked him again and said in closing...  "dreamweaver, it was a real blessing meeting you here today."  he came back..."Ah man, we are all blessings if we just let ourselves be."  "yeah i guess so, man, maybe i will come back and visit again." he said, "ah no man...i won't be here, i almost never come this far down...i'll be up the coast in my cave."  "then maybe someday i will come find your cave, have a good day brother."  and with that we both threw up a hand and i wondered off down the beach as he settled back into his grassy patch.

						   the other night i was sitting at my new favorite bar...(for those keeping score, it was the night i slept in the chair.)  the bartender was a young 20 something guy...slim, confident and really good at bartender tricks. this night he was all down in the dumps...his girl was trying to break up with him and i felt sorry for him and decided that i should stay longer and have...one or two or five more drinks...so as not to leave him all alone and stuff...  i figured that me being a man of the world and all...a regular expert in the ways of love and romance...they don't call me Renaldo Fantastico, for nuthin'  actually i call myself that sometimes when i am...drunk...or...yeah well mostly when i'm drunk. anyway... i thought i should stay, and maybe give the guy some advice. turns out, i had no good advice.  i just sat holding a beer thinking about the amazing way the heart can heal itself...and how it cannot.  so time and draft pass...  i ask the bartender...his name is chip...i ask chip what he did before he worked at this joint. chip replied..."United States Army." i was like...dude?...you just got out of the army? cool. good for you...yeah whatever...you probably got kicked out.  on his next pass i asked him what he did in the army...thinking he must have been some kind of grunt or desk jockey...or some kind of typical looser that had no other life options after high school.  so chip comes back and says..."Airborne...Airborne Ranger" wha!?..."Ranger?....you were a Ranger?" I continued..."Fuck man...my dad was a Ranger...82nd Airborne and the 101st...then with the 5th Ranger group in Viet Nam...and and...and... he was the C.O. at Camp Darby at Ft Benning...and my brother was born at Ft Bragg (While dad was somewhere killing communist)...and then he was Dr. of Tng. at Ft. Sherman in Panama where the Jungle Operations Training School is...and well you know the Mt. Ranger Camp up in Dahlonega, right?"  Chip looked at me and knew i was telling the truth...but i still didn't know if he was...because there is always some guy trying to pass himself off as a Ranger or navy seal...or some other kind of bad ass full of the mystery and intrigue that all the girls...and guys want.  I told him that i thought about doing my time in the army...but...but...well...i just said..."it was rough growing up with the major, man...it was rough growing up with the major." as he turned to walk down the bar he said..."I know man, my dad retired a colonel."  still not totally convinced i decided to ask him one more question...so i say... "So...what happened?...did you just do your time and end up with an honorable discharge or something.?"  see..i was thinking maybe he got tossed out for being a fuck-up or something...i don't know why i was so skeptical...i just was...maybe because the Airborne Rangers have been such a part of my life... i was going to make him prove it to me or i was going to catch him in a lie.  he said..."well...i don't have my dd-14's yet...but hopefully i will soon." and he showed me his 82nd Airborne tattoo. i didn't know what the hell that meant, but figured it was some type of official discharge papers...so i asked him if he was actually still active duty?  "Well sort of...i am on medical leave...i got hurt."  so i dig further...."Hurt?...what happened dude?"  "Grenade. ... see that dark spot on the side of my eyeball? ...broke my arm too."  I looked at the spot on his eye then down at a scar that ran the length of his forearm. so i dug deeper and asked him about the details...  Here is his story...as told by a half assed drunk nodody.  He said it was like the movie "Black Hawk Down"...except there was no air support. they got orders at base camp to go into Tikrit and round up some political targets...this was about five months ago... i was just drunk enough by this time that i had trouble saying "Tikrit"...but i knew that it was homeboy sadaam's home town and prime hunting ground for his crew. Chip said they were told it would be an 8 hour mission...they took no food, one canteen...very little ammo and squad of 8 Rangers.  they dropped in at night...with bad intel. they were given the wrong coordinates....the wrong building...the whole mission was fucked. there were no "political targets"...and the bad guys had been tipped off that they were there.  The Rangers were pinned there for 5 days. I was like.."Shit dude!...you guys didn't have food and water for 5 days, did you?"  he said..."Fuck that...we didn't have ammo for 5 days."  I had no reply other than a silent nod.  he told me that a young kid came walking towards the building..."I didn't have the heart to drop him...so I shot him in the knee." "then he just swung his arm with a big roundhouse motion and tossed a grenaded into the window of our building."  "Ting...ting, ting ting...as it bounced across the floor."  "Boom."  "Two of us dead and the rest of us wounded."  "I didn't get the worst of the blast...mostly the shrapnel that went through my face and into my eye."  "But when the cement roof caved in a large piece fell on my arm pinning me to the ground so I had to break my arm to get free."  He said that they knew a Marine unit was moving through area so they broke radio silence to contact them for a rescue...which brought bad guys out of the woodwork, so they had to get the hell out of that building quickly.  "As we ran out of the building, me carrying a dead buddy on one shoulder... i saw the kid that tossed in the grenade...i just raised my "sawed off" from the hip as i ran past him and blew his fucking head off." "Yeah man...i've been through too much shit this year...too much shit."  I said..."And no one even knows that shit happened, do they?"  "Nope, the public will never know about it...didn't happen as far as anyone out there knows."  I thanked him for offering his life for this fucked up country. then i scribbled my name, phone number, and address on a coaster and tossed it to him...  "Chip" i said... "Chip...anytime, anywhere...any reason...i got your back." If you need gum, run out of gas, have a flat...need a drinking buddy, a place to crash...wanna talk,bar fight, gun fight, anything...you call...from this day until your last day... i got your back."  His eyes watered up a little and gave a sincere thanks as he entered my number into his cell phone...then he asked...  "So why'd you do that man? ... cuz i'm a Ranger?"  "Yeah, partly 'cause your are a Ranger...and i know the cost you have paid...i know what it cost my dad...i know what it has cost me...yeah partly that and partly for serving this jacked up nation...and partly because i know you are a solid fucking human... you just call if you need to."  He slid me a free beer and shook my hand and went on serving other customers...i sat there alone thinking about him...and me...and my father...and the lives that war has defected...i started to tear up myself...and all he really wants at this moment is his girlfriend not to dump his ass.  never underestimate your bartender.  now, i told you that story to tell you another story...but i think i'll wait.

						   did you see pet cemetery...that steven king movie? i was awakened, well before proper awakening time, by a howl that must have been apart of that movie script. no lie.  it is embarrassing how long it took me to realize that it was no use trying to yell "dude! shut the fuck up!" to a deaf animal.  so...there i was, dressed and ready for work about an hour early...petting the cat.  here are some of the things that went through my head this morning...    hope the neighbors don't compain to the apartment management or i will have to pay that 300 dollar pet deposit...before i can take his ass back to mom.  it is raining like a muther...can't wait to get on the road with my worn out wipers and brakes.  how come my last apartment had the same extra-loud drip right outside my bedroom window when it rains?  since i'm early, should i stop for breakfast...or hit the vending machine at work as per usual...and save money?  shit. i left early enough to get behind the school bus that stops at every subdivision between here and tampa.  yippee! i still arrived 30 minutes early to work...that means i get to leave early this afternoon...right?  how did i just spend twice as much at the vending machine than i would have for a real sit-down breakfast?  how do they make this food last for two months?  don't look just eat.  do they spray paint it?  maybe the preservatives will help me live longer?  oh my god!...the first ingredient on this breakfast sandwich is..."whole boned hog"...gulp.  how come the very last ingredient is the scrambled egg?  i feel sick.  where are my pills?  how come i don't feel like i am starting my day correctly when i opt for a mt. dew...instead of coffee?   my head hurts...for the 4th day this week.  where are my pills?  i'm a guy...and i will not cry.

						   i'm still looking for the hidden cameras...they just gotta be filming this shit. they just gotta.  i'm just a regular...make that  irregular  guy...single...well, divorced...twice...with a couple of boys...that i see every other weekend. damn, i am screwed up. but i do have a girlfriend...that lives on the other side of the tracks...she is waiting for me to grow in to a... a... rolex or something nice and shiny like that.  so what in the world do i need with a damn cat? a damn deaf cat. yeah...i got one that can't hear. just my nature i guess. poor fucker has had it rough.  he was born on the steps of my mother's house along with a handful of other little wild kittens. everytime someone would come near the group would scatter into the shrubbery. except the white one...white kitty. after a while we realized that the poor little shit couldn't hear a damn thing...so that meant that sometimes you could slip up on him and get about half a stroke on him before he did a full on cartoon exit in mid-air.  most of his litter mates grew up and moved on. he however, pretty much stayed close...maybe because mom kept feeding him...mom, you're not 'sposed to feed the wild animals.  one day white kitty's handicap led to him getting run over by a car...mom found him and scooped him up and took him to the vet. about 900 bucks, a steel rod, some titanium screws later he suddenly became a house cat.  he's one hell of a handsome dude. solid white...soft and fluffy white with big 'ol green eyes. problem is that he is kinda rough on mom's little taco dog...one of those things that looks like a rat and about the size of one? white kitty means no harm, but mom is especially protective of her little "baby."  so...to make a long boring story shorter but still boring i took the damn cat...yesterday... fucker kept me up all night howling...but i feel for him so i'm patient. hopefully tonight he will be more adjusted and before long the two of us will become best buds.  the problem is his name. i mean, it doesn't really matter what you call a deaf cat, right? but still, i just can't dig on the name, "white kitty." c'mon ma' you're more creative than that...reminds me of the two dogs one of my many step grandmother's owned..."blackie" and "brownie"...guess what color those dogs were? yep.  so i need help naming this cat...i thought i could rotate names and call him something different each month? the first name that popped into my head was "blanco"...uh...for white? what? sounds too much like franco...and i don't like that name...skip it.  now i am leaning towards "banjo"...why? cuz... it reminds me of the movie "deliverance"...remember the fucked up inbred kid on the porch? heheheheh...sick i know...but that's what in-breeding will do to you...look at the british...and their teeth.  so if you have any suggestions for what to call a deaf white cat let me know...in the meantime i am trying to learn sign language.

						   i gotta bad case of luvin yous... 'member that song? who the hell was that?...foreigner?  anyway...  the doctor said i need to stop drinking...huh? damn sure did. said it makes the demon pills not work...  so what do i do?  yep. i drink. like a rock star.  and tomorrow i have to go see him and smile real pretty like the southern gentleman that i am...and lie...and tell him everything is just fine inside here. thanks doc, see ya in two months for my next ration of sanity.  do you ever wonder who reads your shit?...my poor mom...and, oh my god, my kids might find this place...it's bad enough that my girlfriend gets to see inside here...crap.  i need a new, secret, blog.  i need to stop drinking...but with this new apartment...complete with a sidewalk paved right up to the side door of a cool bar...with live music almost every night...?  ah, don't worry. i'm just getting adjusted to my new surroundings, before long i will have all my books unpacked (i'm reading "Lincoln on Leadership"...but i miss my Bulkowski books.) I'll finish building my darkroom where i can be a mad scientist for hours at a time...i can paint the furniture i made ...you know...all that productive kind of stuff that keeps normal people from getting butt ass drunk on a monday night and walking down the side of the road in the middle of the night to buy a bottle of water at the gas station...or falling in love with a beautiful planter box on the deck railing at the mexican restaurant...then taking it home. oops. (I'll take back over tonight.)  so what if i woke up in my chair at 5am with door standing wide open...so what.  i remembered to take my medicine.  my head hurts.

						   just to head off the inevitable comments about my incompetence with the english language....i will make the following blanket statement...and you can quote me...  "kiss my ass"  when i was a kid, my dad would beat on me with his flip-flop because i couldn't get the hang of math...he was a major in the army with a degree in physics and mathematics...sorry but it just didn't fucking compute...the numbers all ran together, looked the same, backwards...whatever. i think i just never bought into the whole math thing...i had so many questions that no one could answer...like who decided this shit? who determined all these arbitrary rules and designations?  i just couldn't get past the basics of mathematical formulas...i had no faith in it's absoluteness.  i had similar problems with grammar. maybe it was just a chip on my shoulder that caused me to resist authority and rules...maybe it was those flip-flop beatings or having to wash the family car all over again to get my three dollars when it didn't pass the white glove test from the major. who knows?...the bottom line is that i struggled with grammar in a terrible way in high school and college. i was the kid that made A's for content and F's for grammar. in college i would have several friends go over my papers before i could turn them in...but, i made it...i did what i had to do to pass all those classes. but it all left me with an inferiority complex regarding our language and for a long time i refused to write. even in speech i chose the simple and safe sentences for fear of screwing up.  then one day...one day something happened to me. something on the inside...i had so much shit inside of me that i just began writing. i wrote what was in my head without regard to rules and grammar or poetic forms...i just wrote to empty this reservoir of vomit. and it freed me.   i have no choice but to write and create...otherwise i will fill up and burst, leaving a heaving mess of entrails and plasma on the floor.  so, i ultimately decided that my need to empty my brain of accumulated thoughts and demons is far more important that following any set of rules and standards that have been designated for my language. therefore, i will continue. those that wish to make suggestions, i will take them gladly and will even welcome the lengthening of my knowledge. however keep in mind that i will retain my self given right to lay aside any and all rules at any time for the purpose of delivering the message of my tiny little voice.  "I" before "E"...except after "C" right?

						   sometimes even in my insignificance...i feel significant. then that other voice chimes in..."oh no you're not, ass hole. do you have that little friend also? maybe that is why i didn't post yesterday at all...i think i just felt like it really didn't matter...and in reality, it does not matter...I can hear bill murray now...it just doesn't matter...it just doesn't matter...(that was from the movie  meatballs , in case you didn't know.)  last night me and my slight little wine buzz were watching a show about reporters at war. which is probably the one thing i wish i could do or be...if i had my choice of life assignments i would have been a photographer on the beaches on Normandy during D-day...or i would have been a photographer in Saigon when all hell broke loose on the morning of the TET offensive...but that's just me...crazy, i know, the doctor already told me...well actually all the women in my life told me, the doctor just smiles and nods while he takes notes.  anyway...on this show i was watching...they were interviewing a woman reporter that was in Viet Nam in 1970-72...they asked her if she regrets going there...she replied..."yes, of course i do!" she went on do describe the wonderful life she thinks she might have now if she had never gone...then she said... "we have to get over the notion that our stories really make a difference. for all the words i've written, i have very little." then she took a long draw off her cigarette...  that remark hit me hard...we all want to believe that we make some difference even if it is in some small way...then to see this woman that was cast into the hell of war not knowing that the ultimate casualty would be herself.  makes me think... at what cost, victory. not the war of armies and nations...the war and risk of the soul to be someone or do something...significant.

						   a few words about hope...  falling slowly through the cold rain i land among the other brown leaves where i lay anonymous holding my damp embers of hope. in the gray light where the most ancient of lovers touch in the silence i push my breath across the embers believing that she is out there wandering among the trees looking for a brown leaf exactly like me.  ©pettit
