       GUESS WHAT? I am all done school shopping and with about 2 weeks left until school starts. Whooooo Hooooo..... I am so glad that I am done, the store are at that time where they are getting busy with other back to school shoppers.      So today I got Daunte his new shoes, he picked out a pair of Sketchers (my fav brand of shoes of course). I got the school supplies for Mikayla and Jordan and then I was done. I still want some new shoes but I just have not found a pair of shoes that I like yet. I own so many pairs of Sketchers its crazy.      OK well not much more to write, I will be back some more soon :)

       On Tuesday we went to Funtown/Splashtown. It was me, Kimo, Mikayla, Jordan, Daunte, Angela, Steve, Alex, and Dylan. We had a great time. Angela and Steve were great to let us borrow the money until Friday when Kimo got paid so we had cash to go with.    We left around 11ish and got down there around 12:30ish. Had lunch at Burger King (yuck) and then went to Funtown/Splashtown. It sucked cause Daunte missed 38 inchs but like a 1/2 inch so he couldn't go on any bigger rides like I knew he would want to but he did get it free so that was ok.    Frist we went over Splashtown, the waterpark and played on the pirate structure over there. It was fun, I loved going down the slides and all the kids really enjoyed it too. Mikayla and Jordan were able to go off on it by themselves and they did really good about checking in with us. We were there for about 1 hour 1/2 and then went over the Funtown. Daunte got upset when the other kids got to go on the rides but Kimo took him to get ice cream at one point when we were on rides. He did get to drive the antique cars, go on the choo choo train, go on the frog hopper (which he wouldn't get off ), go on the kiddies swings, merry-go-round, cars, plaes, boats, helicopters, canoes and I think thats all he went on. Mikayla and Jordan also got to go on all those and they also went on the scrambler, casino ride, thunder bolt, bigger swings, tea cups, log flume ride, and roller coaster. All and all they enjoyed it. Mikayla and I both one at the guess your speed pitch thing and Daunte got a care bear for his dad being a Titans fan :) We had some fried dough, cotton candy, popcorn and what not. Daunte jumped in a coin fountain to try and get more money and got soaked, made me upset, but I got over it, kids will be kids :/ Before we left Angela, Steve, Alex and I went on the Dragon Decent which is one of those "bring you up 20 stories and drop you" rides. I have never been on one before and I didnt care for the height part but I lived. I was at stopped telling Angela I was going to kill her lol. I hated the fact my ass came outta the seat, that was the first part. We fell so fast I couldn't even scream. Alex did great for being 7 and going on it. Well that was our day, no one got lost, it wasn't that busy and we had a great time.

       Ok so I have no clue what the title should mean but....oh well. So anything new going on, no of course not but I felt like writing something so here I type.      Lets see....Tomorrow Mikayla and I are going Horseback Riding with her Brownie Troop, well ours since I am the coleader.       Today I think I am going to go in and get Daunte his new shoes while Jordan is at T.A.L.K.      Yesterday I missed my Aspire appointment and was so scared I was going to get in trouble but nope, I sweet talked my self out of it. I can't believe that I forgot about it though but I go back in on the 31st at 2:30, 2 days before classes start since they have to meet with me before classes do start.      I think I need to get some new underware today too...so we will see if I get there.      Well be back in a few, I think I wanna write about Funtown on Tuesday. :)

       Ok so I have to write about Daunte and what he said today. It was so cute and neat that he knew it at 3.      Okay so he brought a soccer ball into Kimo and said "I'm gonna kick it to you".       So I asked him the follow:      What do you with a football and he said "pass it",   I asked him what you do with a baseball and he said "hit it with a bat" and I asked him what you did with a basketball and he said "shoot it".       It was so cute that he knew what you did with the balls and that they were all right. I think it was the cutest thing. We do have an all star here :)

       Hello, I know it has been a few days since I have wrote but everytime I come on here to something happens and I end up not staying on here long or something like that.      Well, lets see, last night we had another party. This one was not as entertaining as the one we had last weekend but it was still fun. I only had a few drinks and so did Kimo. Lester is the one who got hammered and he was feeling it this a.m. At about 1:00 I finally went into the pool (no I didn't get thrown in) and then Lester, Tay, Travis, Jessie, Angela and Steve all came in too and we didn't get out of there until anut 3:00. It was so damn cold when you got out but then the pool started to get cold too, but it was still fun. I didn't end up leaving until around 5:00 because I didn't feel right leaving Kimo's brother and cousion there but Travis was really into Jessie. So I donno what will go on with that but we will see.       Today has been mostly a relaxing, lazy kinda day. We are getting some rain, not much, from Hurricane Charley and it is kinda muggy out but no sun. No one is doing anything today anyways so it leaves me to sit here.       Kimo is working today so he can have Tuesday off so we can go to Funtown/Splashtown with the kids and Angela and Steve and her kids and maybe Travis and Jessie if they decide to come.        Kimo also has tomorrow off because Mikayla and Jordan both have a dentist appointment around 11ish in Bath so I donno what to do with Daunte. Jordan is pretty good on his own so maybe I can have him go in by himself and Kimo or I can go in with Mikayla and Daunte can wait in the car or the waiting room. We will see in the a.m. Charlene would always take him too if I needed her too.      Well I guess that I have wrote enough and I have a few more thing to write about so I will try and get back on later and update some more.

       Ugh after this long day of sitting around with nothing to do, I am getting bored and tired. I have done little things here and there, Sarah came over to visit, but gosh there is nothing to do. I was thinking about going for a walk but the road that I live on is so bad that I don't think I can take all 3 kids on it by myself.       So here I sit.....and sit.....and sit.....and sit.....and sit..... well I guess it is better than shiting lol.      The kids are sitting out in the pool outside and I am watching them while I type on here. They are having a fun time, I wish I could lol. I think I need to go do some more laundry, since I did my last one at like 2ish so it time for another.  Well someone is IMing me so I will be back later.

       Last night was a good night. My parents babysat so we didnt have to take the kids out and we went to our friends house and had a party. There were a few ups and downs, mainly because one person was there who we really did not want there and of course she wouldn't get the hit that she wasn't invited and should just go home and leave, of course all the guys did not want her to leave, then they wouldn't have anyone to drool over.      Anyways, we got there a little after 8 and Angela and Steve were just finishing up making dinner so they could eat. Since it was raining a lot that afternoon we thought we might have to have everyone inside but we wnded up being able to stay outside. First it was just Angela, Steve, Stacey, Lester, Travis, Jessie, Traci and I. Then Rodney, Phil and Rick showed up. And then a little later Angie, Rodney, and Todd showed up. So that was all who was there.      Kimo was drinking his beloved Long Island Iced Tea and I knew he had too much when he started to get emotional so I was able to get him to go inside and lay down and he ended up throwing up and passing out a little while after being inside. That was at about 12. So the night was still young.      I had about 5/6 drinks in all, almost topped off a bottle of the new Parrot Bay - Mango with pineapple juice but it was good. I was being good since I knew I was going to have to drive so it kind of sucked with that part, but hey, I was being responsible hehe.       Some of them went swimming in the pool. The water was so warm but I never did make it in there. I can't believe that Jessie went in but she did. She wanted me to go in but I never did make it in there :(. I would of if I had some towels cause once you got out it was freezing. I think it was Jessie, Kimo, Lester, Travis and Rodney who went willingly, Steve and Rick who fell in with clothes and all on. Poor guys, it was freezing out.      All and all I had a great night over there after we were able tog et Kimo a little settled since he was being kind of loud. He can bug me sometimes by the way he acts and talks so thats why.       When we were leaving Rodney said that he was going to come over in about an hour. I was like ok, and he ended up coming over. We got home a little after 3 and he was there a little after 4 I think. He ended up staying until 5:30. Mikayla woke up as he was leaving and I was like, you need to go back to bed, its still early out. We just stayed up talking, after he was done looking at all of the Playboys that we have since there were some he hadn't seen.       Well I think this is a good blog and I will write more later. I am gonna call and see if Angela and Steve are up yet since it is a little after 11 and OH YEAH no one won Powerball. Damn I wanna win it. That would be great.

       So here I am sitting at home on a wonderful Saturday afternoon and I feel like crap. I would love to be able to take the kids swimming but I just don't know how I would feel trying to chase them all around. I felt the same way yesterday when I was out and about shopping but it seems to come and go. I took some meds, have tried to lay down but just can't fall asleep. Mikayla is bugging me to go over to Alex's and go swimming agh! I just feel like crap right now.      Well I am in a chat room right now so I will be back in a few to write some more cause I wanna write about shopping and what not yesterday. I hope I am feeling better for tonight cause we are having a party!!!

      Wow, I donno what it is with these kids today but wow, they seem to be driving me insaine. I think it is because we didn't go any where tonight but still, damn! They are not listening to anything I say. I guess kids will be kids. Kimo is upstairs and he is watching wrestling so I get no help from him of course.  Well on a better note, tomorrow I am going shopping. We are going down to the Portland Mall. I have to get Jordan the Power Ranger Dino Thunder backpack and lunch box. That is one thing that he really wants for starting Kindergarden.  Well be back in a few, someones gotta use the phone.

       Hello again, back to post some more since I have gotten this figured out and what not. So today the weather has taken a turn and its in the 60's I believe with some wind, not hot at all. Amazing since it has been so hot and humid lately. Today I am suposed to clean up the kids rooms and then tomorrow I am going shopping to start school shopping for the kids and I.      School.....wow, yeah school. It starts in almost a month, September 1st for Mikayla and Jordan and the 7th for Daunte and I. Mikayla is entering the 2nd Grade and she is so excited about that. Jordan is starting Kindergarden and he is more than excited about that. Daunte will be starting his first year of preschool at Head Start, so no more Early Head Start for him. I am starting my last year in college to recieve my Medical Assisting degree. So no more messing around for me, I wanna get this done and over with.      Kimo has just been working and in about 2 weeks he will be going to the morning shift which is 5 to 1:30 instead of 11 to 7:30. Hes gonna like it better but will have to go to bed earlier and stay off of those damn video games he likes to play all hours of the night.      Well other than that not much is going on. We are suposed to decide on a day to go to Funtown/Splashtown soon which needs to be done before school starts so I might just have to take the kids down someday cause I really don't want these tickets to go to waste.      Well off to do some cleaning and see what else today has in store for the rest of the day.
