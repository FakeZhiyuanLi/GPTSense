       .Scene  So, I went school shopping :D Go me! School shopping always gets me really excited, and I know that from now until school starts I'll be trying on my new clothes. Ehh ;\ I'm metro ;/.

       .Scene  My phone conversation is going something like this: Me: I just fell off my chair into a shredder. Becca: Then wouldn't you be like-shredded? Me: Becca, do you know what a paper shredder is? Becca: Yeah, one of those things that shreds paper. Me: And, Becca, can I fit into a paper shredder? Becca: Well, you have to specify. Me: Oh, yes, let me just fall into the people-shredder placed conveniently next to my desk.  Becca, Becca, Becca. Anyways, life is still rocking. Mike got home today, and we played some more Megaman X. We ended up losing all of the passwords so we had to start over :(. Tis OK, we got back to the last level, but the problem is we're missing a Sub tank.  I finally caught the third episode of The Assistant in other news.  I'm continuing my flogging molly lyrics...   Flogging Molly -   Drunken Lullabies  Must it take a life for hatful eyes To glisten once again Five hundred years like Gelignite Have blown us all to hell What savior rests while on his cross we die Has the Shepard led his lambs astray to the bigot and the gun  Must it take a life for hateful eyes To glisten once again Cause we find ourselves in the same old mess Singin' drunken lullabies  I watch and stare as Rosin`s eyes Turn a darker shade of red And the bullet with this sniper lie In their bloody gutless cell Must we starve on crumbs from long ago Through these bars of men made steel Is it a great or little thing we fought Knelt the conscience blessed to kill  Must it take a life for hateful eyes To glisten once again Cause we find ourselves in the same old mess Singin' drunken lullabies  Ah, but maybe it`s the way you were taught Or maybe it`s the way we fought But a smile never grins without tears to begin For each kiss is a cry we all lost Though there is nothing left to gain But for the banshee that stole the grave Cause we find ourselves in the same old mess Singin' drunken lullabies  I sit in and dwell on faces past Like memories seem to fade No colour left but black and white And soon will all turn grey But may these shadows rise to walk again With lessons truly learnt When the blossom flowers in each our hearts Shall beat a new found flame  Must it take a life for hateful eyes To glisten once again Cause we find ourselves in the same old mess Singin' drunken lullabies

       .Scene  Today I'm going to something I'm going to regret: I'm going to post lyrics. Yes, I am doing what Bobby and Brittney do, but I'm a lot cooler so there. Bobby stole my ".Characters" thing anyway. So, that'll be coming up after.  Today was good. I can't remember ever having so many good days in a row. I dunno why though.  As of now, I'm talking to Damien. Damien pwnz me. Hells yeah.  Something new about Ydonia. The autopsy confirmed the report of a 'murder-suicide.' She shot her boyfriend, and then she shot herself. They say it might've been caused by financial problems, but I doubt it. My mom told me they found a suicide note, but they haven't released it to the public. It's eerie when something like this hits so close to home. You expect there to be a big headline that reads "LADY ONCE YOUR AUNT GOES CRAZY AND SHOOTS HER BOYFRIEND AND HERSELF" when it reads "Woman kills self an boyfriend." It's also strange to think her whole life was meant to end in a car in a Target parking lot.  Blah. Maybe one of these days I'll have something to talk about.   Flogging Molly - Devil's Dance Floor Lyrics   Her breath began to speak As she stood right in front of me The colour of her eyes Were the colour of insanity Crushed beneath her wave Like a ship, I could not reach her shore We're all just dancers on the Devil's Dance Floor Well swing a little more, little more o'er the merry-o Swing a little more, a little more next to me Swing a little more, little more o'er the merry-o Swing a little more, on the Devil's Dance Floor Pressed against her face I could feel her insecurity Her mother'd been a drunk And her father was obscurity But nothin' ever came From a life that was a simple one So pull yourself together girl And have a little fun Well she took me by the hand I could see she was a fiery one Her legs ran all the way Up to heaven and past Avalon Tell me somethin' girl, what it is you have in store She said come with me now On the Devil's Dance Floor Well swing a little more, little more o'er the merry-o Swing a little more, a little more next to me Swing a little more, little more o'er the merry-o Swing a little more, on the Devil's Dance Floor The apple now is sweet Oh much sweeter than it ought to be Another little bite I don't think there is much hope for me The sweat beneath her brow Travels all the way An' headin' south This bleedin' heart's cryin' Cause there's no way out Well swing a little more, little more o'er the merry-o Swing a little more, a little more next to me Swing a little more, little more o'er the merry-o Swing a little more, on the Devil's Dance Floor  I had a six paragraph analysis on this song done about an hour ago. It got deleted :(.  This verse always puts the picture of a big dance floor in front of me; it's crowded, and the main focus is on a guy. He stares across the dance floor into the eyes of some girl he doesn't know, and it's almost as though he sends a silent message to that he wants to dance. They dance, but she's still not interested in him, the line "Like a ship, I could not reach her shore" makes me think he wants more than just a dance. This verse starts the parallel between him and the girl and human desires. He wants more than he has, like any other human. From the first verse the "Devil's Dance Floor" is set up as a metaphor to life, but why are we all dancing on 'The Devil's Dance floor'?  On the Devil's Dance Floor He seems to be getting close to what he wants. The whole meaning of "The Devil's Dance Floor" changes though. The girl's past makes it seem like 'The Devil's Dance Floor' refers to the rules we've broken, and how we just have to keep dancing, or living our lives. This verse refers to the biblical story of Adam and Eve, and how Eve took the apple. She desired the apple, and bit it, just like how the guy really wanted the girl. The idea is that he gets the apple, but he's breaking rules. The verse concludes the lyric, and answers the question. Dancing on the devil's dance floor is a metaphor to life, and it basically means we're all living our lives and breaking rules, but we can't let that stop us from dancing. Wow, I put a lot of effort into that.

       .Scene      So, life is good. Life is life. Today was boring, but that's how I like to spend my summer days: just talking to friends and watching MTV. So, I was happy with a boring day.

       .Scene   My aunt and her boyfriend were shot and killed today. Ehh. You might wonder how come I'm shrugging this off, and why I'm about to talk about to cry about Florida again when two lives were lost today. First of all, I can only remember meeting the lady once. The memory is of me standing by her, and I'm eating fruity pebbles. The other reason is that she hated my mom, and wanted nothing to do with my family. The final reason? Her and my uncle got a divorce like six years ago. So, I mean, not that it's no big deal, but it didn't really hit me.   So, my mom found out about me using the computer all the time. I'm not suppossed to be on it unless she turns it on for me; I've been grounded from it since February. She said she's disappointed. Sorry ma :(, but I need to type my blog. How else would people keep up with this drama and excitement? *Writes down he has to make another 'blah my life sucks 'cause I'm not in Florida post'*   I wish I were with my friends in FL :(   Blah. Today I realized that I must be the second silliest person ever. I'm just so silly. Silly :D! I got mad at Bobby and Brittney, but I wasn't really that mad so I fake a big fight. At the end I went "I'm obnoxious" and laughed at them. Take that conformity.   So, here I am.  -Dan    .Music   Yellowcard - Only One  Sugarcult - Killing Me  Story of the year - Sidewalks   Sugarcult - Daddy's little defect &nbsp;  Did you find this one? If you did than I'll tell you two more things. I changed what it says when someone leaves a comment; find that on your own. Second of all, the red means that the post title came from a lyric in that song.

       .Scene   Well, it seems most of my friends don't understand the concept of updating. That's right people, update your goddamn blog. I know we all can't be as perfect and prompt as me, but we could all atleast try. Come on ;\.   Anyways, life is still good. I talked to Ms. Sipple today, which rocked! She's getting a dog, and I helped her with info on the breeds. I'm not sure if I really helped, but she told me I did. I guess I get a cookie for that.   Then, I also got to talk to Britt. Brittney's phone service was cancelled (Sad Face). She said that AT&T has been charging them outrageuous prices. Poor Britt; my prayers go out to her. How will she live?   Then, there's Bri, who is finally back online ;D! Go Bri.   I'm trying to figure out who she thought liked her.   I think there was someone else I was talking to, but ehh ;/. I'll update later.

       .Scene   I've changed my blog's title about seven times now. I guess I like it now. I guess.   'slash m other slash' refers to \m/&nbsp;(The rock on sign).   You know what I really need to do (Other than shower; I haven't done that today)? Summer reading. I promised myself I would start in August, and now I'm having that 'Maybe I shouldn't procrastinate' thought. Goddamn procrastination. I mean, I finished Tuesday with Morrie already; it took me two hours. The Odyssey is a little harder, but not much. The translation is very easy. The problem is that I have to do work with The Odyssey.   Random Fact: Only one person in 2 billion will live to 116 or older.   Then, there's the '.Scene' problem. I really liked setting my life up as a movie/play/show/porno, but I've been forgetting to do '.Scene.' Maybe I should stop. Naa, nevermind. I've actually decided to implement more headers when I get a chance.   There's nothing here!   six hours later...  Well, I'm back. The day ended how it started: boring. I miss my friends from school, and it doesn't help I haven't talked to Bri in about two weeks, and I haven't talked to Laura since school ended. :(. I did talk to the ever-amusing Kristin today though. Time to screw around a bit.  .Music   Sugarcult - Crying  Yellowcard - Way Away  Sugarcult - Memory (Acoustic)

       .Scene   So, yes, in conclusion, the warped tour r0x0rd my b0x0rs. I enjoyed it, and if you, yes you, the person reading this, has a chance to go then I expect you to go. Four. I've decided today that I&nbsp;dislike Jake. I really do. Do you not know who Jake is? Jake is Katie (R)'s little make-believe boyfriend. You know...   "Katie and me are going out"  "Jake and me are going out"   Blah. Get a life. Katie, come on, Jake is like, what, eight? Ok, maybe eight-and-a-half. You can do better than that. You can do better than someone who types stuff like:   -Quote:   Yesturday was my 13th birth day.YA! we went to c i,robot at 3:00 came back went swimming and played 1 of the best games in the world Halo for Xbox. I robot was a very cool/funny movie. Ecpesially the part when he was talkin to this guy and all of a sudden he went cough cough.....sry i am alergic to BullShit.Lol it cracked me up.I really liked it and i hope ever1 else did.I loved gettin all my gifts and the very funny i-o-u from katie.(lol).I had a godd b-day,and i hope every1 else had fun. well... ill try n update my posts after i get back from vacatinon. bye   -End Quote   Boo! Nobody likes j00r lack of grammar. Although now that I said that, I know 1800 people are going to find every grammar mistake I've ever made and prosecute me. Peoples are dumb. Especially someone who writes a comment telling me my blog is dumb, and then creates their own blog (Yes, I am talking about Jake. His blog is at j-loaf-blogspot.com). Thus, I dedicate today's title to Katie. Katie used to be very mature for her age. Now she hangs around with seventh graders (No offense to... you know what? Fuck it. Seventh graders are losers).&nbsp; I love you Katie :D!   It's a good thing she's my best friend or I'd never talk to her again. I don't know if that last sentence made sense, but I seriously don't care. Oh well. If you want to read Katie's blog or one of my other good friend's blogs, scroll down to the footer at the bottom. Neat, eh? I'm going to try to get all if my friends on blogspot to put something like that as their footer. We'll be like a webring without a name. We're just that cool.   That footer is the only exciting thing that I think happened today. I tried to hang a street sign with tape, but eh, didn't work. I should write that one down. I might update later. Night for now.    I bet you Jake is going to dedicate a whole post to like bashing me. He's going to be like 'oh em jee, he uses .scene wtf is that. I'm too kewl.     .Characters    Jake  - Katie's sorta boyfriend. He's a lot younger than her. I think he's kinda lame. I could just be jealous; who knows.   Katie &nbsp;- Jake's sorta girlfriend; one of my best friends in FL.

      (Updated 7/31) (Updated 7/26)  (Updated 7/25)   \m/. omg. I've been trying to think of words that describe The Warped Tour. It was so great. I saw all but one of the bands that I wanted to see, and I didn't mind. I crowdsurfed, moshed (unintentionally), and jumped around. It fucking owned me. I would go again in a flash.   (Songlist at bottom)    ..My W a r p e d  Day  We got to the warped tour at about 12:45. Because I had heard Story of the year while standing on line for Jason's ticket, I decided to search them out. Don't trust me for directions :(. It took me 20 minutes to walk what should've taken me five or ten. We caught their last two songs, and then we headed towards Rufio. After waiting half an hour for them, we found out they decided to switch times. We had no clue when they would be back, but it was ok. I only know like one of their songs.  Well, we had been there for about an hour and seen two halves of a concert.&nbsp;We decided&nbsp;on NFG&nbsp;and&nbsp;walked towards them.&nbsp;We got in the middle of the crowd, but we were&nbsp;way too cramped and Katie couldn't see :(. We left after their first song, but luckily, it was my favorite song by them. We decided we needed to get to the next band we wanted to see early. So, we headed towards Simple Plan. On the way I bought an Atticus shirt for $15 and a CD for $5. Eh, I never really liked Simple Plan, but I wanted to see someone up-close. I now have a new respect for them. They got out, and the crowd was really hyped up, and after getting over my shyness I went crowdsurfing :D! I asked some guy to throw me up, and he was nice enough to do it. Thanks guy :D! It feels as though you're flying. I ended up kicking a few people, but I guess it's all in the fun of crowdsurfing.  After SP Jason and Katie were hungry.&nbsp;I thought Coheed was on next, and I didn't mind missing them.&nbsp;We&nbsp;took about half an hour break in the hopes I would be back in time to catch Coheed's performance, but not really get too involved.&nbsp;We got some lunch (A slice of pizza and two waters for me for $12), and headed back towards Coheed. On our way to Coheed we were surprised to hear 'Blink' because Blink wasn't at the tour this year. Suddenly, I realized it wasn't Blink. It was Yellowcard. I pushed my way through the people towards the middle, and I crowdsurfed to the front. That was the defining moment: crowdsurfing during one of my favorite band's concerts. There was a massive mosh pit Katie and I got caught in, but it was so much fun.  After YC, I was afraid Sugarcult might be on next (Because they had changed the schedule for YC). We waited about half an hour, and found out Bad Religion was on. We listened to their first song, and walked around for awhile. I decorated my cellphone with Yellowcard stickers 'tackily.' I also grabbed a bunch of necklace thingys (Below).&nbsp; Katie bought a YC shirt for her sister, and Jason and me debated on what we wanted.  We got back to the Brian stage in time for Flogging Molly; one of my favorite bands. They created the most enjoyable show. From talking to their fans about their hair to the Irish-circle-jig everyone started. I didn't crowdsurf because everyone was going crazy. I knew three of their songs :D! The atmosphere was great. Everyone was jumping and clapping to the Irish jig.  After Flogging Molly Katie headed towards the Yellowcard booth to get her sister's shirt signed. She got the guitarist's signature. I wanted to get my cellphone signed, but I forgot :(.  While Katie and me were at the YC booth, Jason went to get something to eat. Katie and I watched NOFX for awhile, and then looked at all of the booths (There are so many; each band has their own booth) . I finally decided on&nbsp;a Warped tour shirt ($15). I wanted proof I went :D! Later, when we met back up with Jason, we got to see the end of Coheed. Kind of a disappointment, actually. Like, they sounded really good, but the atmosphere was boring. They kept expecting everybody to know the words at the most awkward times.  Because Sugarcult was playing on the same stage Coheed was playing on, we&nbsp;decided to get to the Sugarcult concert early. The Sugarcult was a great concert, but very painful. Everybody decided to crowdsurf at once. I had atleast 8 people land on my head. During their third song I had to leave; a crowdsurfer knocked my glasses off, and they were bent (They're ok now). Sugarcult was extremely good though. They really tie with Flogging Molly and Yellowcard. They surprised everyone when they started early, and played my favorite songs of theirs. We left at about 9:15.  The Warped Tour was so much more than that though. I didn't get to discuss the moshing, and exactly how I crowdsurfed. I didn't get to talk about the millions of booths, and that it was extremely well planned. Something was always going on. There were even four stages for garage/local bands. If you want to know more contact me.   As of now, I'm exhausted. The trip was the greatest trip I've had since I moved.

       .Scene  As of now, I'm talking to Kristin. The cool thing about Kristin, other than the fact she spells her name with two "I"'s is the fact that she always full of energy. Our current conversation is about chocolate whipped cream. We're amusing ourselves.  Life is good. That's all I can say. I don't know why. It might be because I finally beat the spider boss in Megaman X; I've been trying to beat him since i was 5. It might also be the fact The Warped Tour is tomorrow. Speaking of that, I should probably call Katie and Jason and tell them when we're leaving. People like to be told when we're going, right? Damn peoples.  I just called Bobby. He's tired. Poor guy; he has such a hard life. Today he just screwed around and saw Spiderman 2. "The best movie ever" in his words. Bobby gets obsessed with stuff randomly. I mean, sure it was a good movie, but not "The best movie ever."  I'm about to go downstairs and grab something to munch on. Maybe I'll finally get to my wedding crashing scene for Red Dress. I think I'm going to cut the mental institution theme.   -Dan

       .Scene  I wasn't really feeling better this morning. Still coughing, sore throat, and the works. I don't really mind it, but I don't want to be sick at The Warped Tour. I am so excited :D! 1day 15hrs 13mins 25secs till the concert.  Speaking of it, I finally got around to telling Katie that Ticketmaster upped the ticket prices 9 million dollars.   I'm not sure what else to say. My day went by pretty well. I went down to the pool, and played Megaman with Mike and Jason for an hour or so. Ehh, what else? Thunderstorm ripped through, and my mom found about about me disconnecting the mouse from her computer. Later I tried to get her to watch I love the 90s, but she didn't want to. Oh well they were talking about boners and Viagra for an hour anyway.  As of now I'm talking to Kristin :D! It's been awhile since we've had a good conversation.   mrunsensitive04: *BLOCK* Decembiebabie signed off at 7:43:12 PM.  Decembiebabie signed on at 7:43:22 PM.  mrunsensitive04: :-( Decembiebabie: that was sheer evil! mrunsensitive04: I can't go a whole 15 secs w/o talking to you Decembiebabie: yeah I know, for that split second I was, like, bored again mrunsensitive04: Tragedy. Decembiebabie: it was! I was about to turn green, tear my shirt off, and romp around my house breaking stuff b/c of that! mrunsensitive04: Oh :-( mrunsensitive04: You should get that checked Decembiebabie: yeah, maybe you're right... Decembiebabie: :-D  We're amusing ourselves. We're just that cool. Maybe I'll update with a little of Red Dress later.

       .Scene  That song used to be my summer anthem. Fuck MTV, that 'Will Smith - Summer' song, or whoever the fuck&nbsp;sung it;&nbsp;it doesn't come close to SR 71 - Right Now. Do I sound angry? I'm not though. Not even angsty. In fact, I had a pretty peaceful day. Not peaceful per se but calm.  Basically, I was sick. Stuffy nost, bad headache, discomfort, the works. I ended up talking to Bobby and Brittney for like 17 hours. Fun. :D.  I'm not sure what else to say. I'm thinking about writing another scene tonight so hopefully I'll get a little inspiration.  Out for now.  -Dan  Warped Tour Update: I bought tickets last night! 2days 15hrs 16mins 53secs till The Warped Tour.

I guess nothing can truly stay. *sigh*.  &nbsp;  On a lighter note, today went pretty well. I woke up and got on the computer :D! Except, the keyboard didn't work :(. It's a bitch to use on-screen keyboard. Usually I type&nbsp; around 75 WPM; not on the on-screen keyboard. Onscreen keyboard consists of a picture of a keyboard in which you click the keys. It's exhausting.&nbsp;After the strenuous activity of clicking keys, I headed to the pool with Mike. Very relaxing; I especially liked the part where I had six seven-year-olds swimming around me with goggles. We talked to the lifeguard (My neighbor) most of the time. Later Mike and I called Jason, and we played megaman for the rest of the day. We're just that cool.  &nbsp;   Warped Tour   Katie called me last night, and she told me she could go! :D!

       .Scene   You know what I'm sick of? This whole 'emo' fad. Wow, it's finally become an annoyance. I love my friends to death, but do we really need to label ourselves with titles like 'emo'? Emo for God's sake. It's the social group for people who need to be labeled. I guess people just need to feel part of a whole. Fuck them ;/.  &nbsp;  Back to life. Life is... Ok. I'm trying to recall what I've done since my last post, but I can't think of anything except Six Flags with Mike, which, speaking of it, was pretty kickass. Jason ended up winning, on his first try,&nbsp;on this game I had put well over $40 into. Ehh, good for Jason :D! I was happy for him. We went on a bunch of Rollercoasters before Jason's win, but after, with Jason's nine-foot stuffed lizard, it was difficult to walk through the park. We got a lot of attention though, but it was exhausting.  &nbsp;  I also got my schedule!  &nbsp;  I'm going to post it here so when people ask I can link to it.  &nbsp;   First Semester - "A" day    1A  Spanish II   2A  Driver's Ed   3A  Resource   4A  English II Literature Honors  &nbsp;   First Semester - "B" day    1B  Chemistry Honors   2B  Algebra II Honors   3B  World History Honors   4B  Speech  &nbsp;   Second&nbsp;Semester - "A" day    1A  Spanish II   2A  PE   3A  English II Writing Honors   4A &nbsp;Resource  &nbsp;&nbsp;   Second Semester - "B" day    1B  Chemistry Honors   2B  Algebra II Honors   3B  World History Honors   4B  Health Wellness  &nbsp;  So far I have one class with Kristin, and no classes with Jason.  &nbsp;  I went out and bought a nice calculator (Ti-84 II), and I've been downloading games for it a lot recently. I'll probably never play them in the actual class -_-. Today I hung out with Jason, and that was it.  &nbsp;  Speaking of The Warped tour(Yes, I know I didn't mention it), I think I can probably get a ride there, but I don't want to go alone. Argh. Nobody I know seems really interested in it. I think I'm going to go and then see if I can find anyone from school.  Whew. Caught up.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

       .Scene  Today's title really has nothing to do with anything I'm going to write about. I just felt like using a Green Day lyrics so today's title comes from 'Green day - Minority.'&nbsp;  I've decided to seek out a girlfriend. I have no idea how long it'll be until I find one, but I'm in the mood where I want to cuddle, and other stuff. *ahem*. I have this strange feeling I'm going to hook up with somebody at The Warped Tour which is in 1wk 18hrs 13mins 38secs (As of this post). Katie called and said she couldn't go to it this morning.  Sad :(.  Then I spoke to Raju who said he thinks he'll be able to coax his parents into taking us. Sounds good.  &nbsp;  Bobby called me today :). For the first time in awhile Bobby called me unexpectedly just to talk. Which was cool. It's weird, I talk to the kid every night from 8 - 12, but I really liked how he just called to talk in the middle of the day.  Happy :).  I think hat's the reason he called so unexpectedly, just to show me we're still friends. Fine with me.&nbsp;  I hid this one well :)! I dunno what to say though :(.  I was up until 1:30 this morning thinking about 'stuff.' What I'd wear to The Warped Tour, when would be the best time to see Bobby again, and etc. I've decided to wear a button down shirt with board shorts, and I'm going to buy some uber-hold red gel to make short, but pointy spikes. I've also decided I'm going totry to fly Bobby up when I have school so he can 'shadow' me&nbsp;(My school offers this thing where you can bring someone who doesn't go to the school to follow you around all day).  &nbsp;  My parents are out trading our Explorer. I think they're going to bring home and ugly Suzuki XL-7. :(. Ugly. Look it up online. What's strange is my family is&nbsp;made of three people and the XL-7 is like a van. Wtf? Crazy peoples. &nbsp; I actually had a lot to say for a day where I've felt under the weather all day.  &nbsp;

        .Scene    It's late, but I'm updating to update you on my life. The drama! I didn't feel great today, and since I'm going to Six Flags on Saturday I'm trying to rest so I'll feel better. The drama! The confusion! The changes :D! Blogspot updated it's controls&nbsp;today so I can use special effects in my blog. New header time! &nbsp;    &nbsp;     .Scene         NYC FLgsjdngdsfd    If you can read this you have way too much time on your hands.      &nbsp;      .Scene (End Intermission)       Maybe next I'll do something else original, like spell my screenname mRuNsEnSiTiVe04 instead of all lowercase letters.    Maybe I'll write like this so it's like in code. In fact, from now on I'm going to start hiding messages like this. So highlight sometimes, and you might find some surprises! &nbsp; Try highlighting that black space.  &nbsp;  Maybe I should talk about my day ;/. I mentioned the part about me being sick. I think Mike's mad at me because I told him I didn't feel well yesterday, and I don't think he believed me :(. I suck. Then, my parents wanted to go to this really expensive restaurant (They had a giftcard for it), but there was traffic so we went to Outback instead (Still expensive). We had some recovering alcoholic lady as our waitress.  Then I got home and called Bobby. Ehh, for the rest of the night I think I'm going to spite myself and not call Bobby back. Once again he acts as though I don't exist. We were on the phone, and Brittney wasn't answering. So he called her again. I hate how he acts like him talking to me is a gift to me. No problem. Then again. Then again. Like I wasn't there; like he had nobody to fucking talk to. Not his best friends =/. Whatever.  &nbsp;  Pissed off... again.  &nbsp;  .Credits  Mike - Good friend in Illinois. I'm going to six flags with Mike and Jason this Saturday.  Bobby&nbsp;- Best friend in the world; pissing me off lately.  Brittney&nbsp;- One of my best friends.   .Music&nbsp;&nbsp;  Blink-182 -&nbsp;Violence &nbsp;&nbsp;

       .Scene  I have a lot of stress on me for one reason. My class chocies for next year. I really screwed up, and it's driving me crazy. I'm kicking myself for choosing Health Wellness, a blow-off class, instead of another science. That choice is going to screw up the rest of my year. It's driving me crazy that instead of something that could help me I took a blowoff class. Omg. It's driving me crazy.  On a lighter note: I went down to the pool today.  Who knows what I'll do tomorrow.    .After the Credits  Watch 'The Assistant' on MTV. It rocks.

      (If you're lost check 'Untitled Post 1' and Untitled Post 2')  The following is only a 'first sketch' of the scene. It was 1 AM when I wrote it, and I'm not very happy with the final product.  ----- (Red Dress)  She stood there, looking over the pier. Her eyeliner was smudged with tears, and her foundation was bare where tears had rolled off her cheeks. She was in total fear. The fear in her face seemed to me generated by the man a few yards behind her. I presumed he was Dean. Although now that I think about it her face was unparalleled by Dean's face which was in both fear and confusion. I could only watch the heart-broken girl acting in nothing but senseless rage. "Valentina. Y-you cant swim." Dean finally let out. "Y-you'll s-sink." It seemed as though Dean was assuring himself of the situation instead of his ex-lover. His two sentences didn't change anyhting. She still stood there with a mild expression. Her brown eyes twinkled for a second, but she blinked, and she was once again indifferent to the situation. I remembered the scene that had happened only a few moments ago.  A blue Ford Tauros screeching to a halt in the grass. Valentina got out of the car in a black shirt that complimented her height, and ran onto the hot sand of the beach. She ran past Dean, and climbed to the top of the pier. Confused and startled Valentina had found him with another woman,  Dean tried to beat her to the pier. He had been a few yards behind her when she reached the edge. Fate, once again, let me watch someone dying ever so slowly. I blinked, and I continued watching the scene.  "I could never find anyone else. You kno-" Valentina was cut off.  Dean was running at full speed towards her. He grabbed the right side of her shirt and pulled. I wasn't standing close enough to hear the buttons snap, but the memory still sends shivers down my spine. Her shirt unbuttoned down the middle throwing Dean off balance, and one of his feet was off the pier, leaving him in an awkward position.  Valentina grabbed for Dean's hand, but was blinded by layers of eyeliner and mascara that tears, sweat, and humidity had removed. Her hand reached slightly to the left of where Dean's hand was in the split-second she had to save him. Dean plummetted to the bottom of the pier. Valentina's eyes shut, and she fell backwards onto rickety brown pier.

       .Scene   ..Filler  You see that lyric up there? It's nice, right? It took me half an hour to find. Oh well ;/. I like it because I think it's described the last three days or so. Just the same old thing. I woke up (*gasp*), and I ate, and I watched TV, and I rode down to Katie's, and I came home, and that was it. I did see a few good things today. I saw I love the nineties and The Assistant. I reccomend both. The Assistant was the best thing I've seen on MTV in awhile. And that was today. It's funny; I've just summed up about 14 hours of life in two-and-a-half paragraphs.

      This is the second addition of my published writer's journal. Here's the final scene from Red Dress (Remember I've only written like 3 out of order scenes out of like 200 ;/). Check 'Untitled Post 1' for some more about the story, and other scenes. ----- (Red Dress)  		I stopped for a second, and I couldn't help but look at it. Just five years ago someone had been part of the dress, and now it lay untouched haning on a wall in Goodwill. The red thing-that's all it was now, a thing-seemed so one-dimensional. A passerby would never guess the story of the relic, but I knew it. As much as I tried to forget it I couldn't, and I  sometimes wondered why I tried to shut it out. I had learned from it, some good some bad. 	The first time I saw it I thought it's owner was dead, and later I learned that it's owner would be better off dead. If she could have, would she have chosen that path again? I was thinking these thoughts and others when I saw the man. In one strong hand he carried a trashcan, and in the other he carried a broom. 	"She's strange, ain't she?" The man asked. "If you're interested I might be able to cut you a deal. I'm about to throw it out." I shook my head. I wasn't interested. 	He knocked the dress down with one swipe from the broom, and for a split second, before it fell into the garbage, I could have sworn I had seen a person in the dress not knowing whether to smile or frown.

       .Scene   .Intro  Everyday that passes here is another day away from Florida. So depressing. So -_-. It's so strange because I want to be home, but technically I already am. Life here is so... bland. It's probably the same in Florida, but hey it's Florida.  It wouldn't be so bad if I didn't feel so isolated. Even though I talk to Brittney, Bobby, Becca, and Erin every single day there's so much missing as well as other people missing. So today's blog is dedicated to one of the missing peoples. I feel like I should be seeing her on a milk carton.  ...  Katie Ross. I talked to her today! Katie (R) is one of my best friends, and at one time my closest friend. Since I've moved though we rarely talk.  Katie (R) is the girl next door.  I first me Katie (R) through Bobby, and up until I moved we spoke almost every day. We have a lot in common; from our taste to music to our opinions on people. Katie is just easy to talk to. So Katie and I were great friends. Not the same way Bobby and Katie are friends because they're sister and brother like (they're not siblings though). Katie's house is directly behind Bobby's. The families are great friends on account of Bobby has two little brothers and Katie has three sisters. Each child from each family has a counterpart in the other family. In fact, this year Andrew (12?) (chuckie9225.blogspot.com) had his birthday party at Katie's house (Him and Katie's sister Kimmy are the same age). Back to the relationship. Katie and my relationship was perfect. Then I moved, and it went downhill. I'm really sad about it.    .Conclusion  And that ^ is my Katlyn Ross/Daniel Abdalla biography.  In other news I just ate dinner.

       .Scene  Today's title comes from 'Rufio - White Lights.' Good song. For the past half hour I've been searching for a title.  So, what shall I talk about? I got an idea for a good scene today :). I've had a few in the last few days, but I like this one the best. I'm not exactly how the scene will play into the story, but I think it'll weave its way in well. Tongue twister back there. Anyways, hmm, now that I think about it, it's not exactly a scene. It's more of like a character. A girl who has tried her whole life to be beautiful with hundreds of diets, makeup, and so on. Her tragic flaw is that yearn to be beautiful.  Today: Jason came over for awhile. It was kinda boring because we didn't know what to do. We finally decided to go the pool. Ehh ;/, I haven't been to the pool in ages so I went. I need to make the swimteam next year. Later I mowed the grass, and after that I went driving which rocked. There was one part though where I stopped short trying not to hit a bird, and the two cars behind me stopped short. -_-  Tonight is also... THE RADIO! Woo! If you don't know about 'The Radio' listen in tonight at 10 CDT if you have highspeed with the following link: http://synaptic.creativeirc.net:8000/listen.pls. I hope Bobby, Brittney, Becca, and Erin will be on. Last night Becca and Brittney and Bobby and me were arguing and not speaking, but voila! Today we are.  Bobby's still acting strange though. He seems to have an attitude with everyone =\. Then there's Becca who called me while I was driving, and I told her I was busy.  So, I'll update you later.   .Characters   Jason  - Really good friend of mine in IL.  Bobby  - Best friend ever; like a brother to me. Lives in FL.

       .Scene  If you haven't noticed, my last three 'big' posts have all been song titles. Today's post title comes from 'Flogging Molly - To Youth (My Sweet Roisin Dubh). Good song. I think when I get a chance I'll buy the Flogging Molly CD.  Anyways, I bought the Warped Tour CD and saw Spiderman 2 today. My dad says he'll probably be able to drive Katie and me there so it'll be cool.  .Cliffhanger

       .Scene  99 red balloons go by. That song really got me thinking, but I'm not sure about what. Ehh, all I did my whole day was watch TV and play Megaman Battle Network 4. Kinda boring. Jason rang the doorbell, but I still don't feel well enough to do anything. As of now I'm trying not to listen to '99 Red Balloons' or 'Chicago is so two years ago' because I know I'm going to overplay it. I also kinda want to continue the Red Dress story or atleast write another scene, but I have no motivation. No scene is jumping out at me. :(. Then there's the Warped Tour. Bobby and co. (My best friends who live 1300 miles away) are planning on going. *tear* Maybe Katie or Sam'll go.

       .Scene  Today? Today. I'm not sure what I did. I got on the computer early this morning, and I haven't gotten off it since. I feel kinda sick. Not like  sick , but like I'm getting there. I read a few things about the upcoming Harry Potter ;/, and that's when my dad caught me on the computer. He didn't say anything, and told me I had to make my bed, and then I could get back on. So, whatever.  Bobby and Britt kinda pissed me off earlier because I always have to call them; they don't call me. Ehh ;/.

      -----Fireworks or weapons of mass destruction? (7/04)  .Scene  4th of July was putting a considerable amount of stress on me, but now that it's over I'm trying to figure out where the stress came from. Ehh ;/ I guess somethings are just like  that . In Florida our firework displays were breath-taking, but here because fireworks are illegal my parents decided not to buy any. Oh well. So, we were fireworkless. :(. In fact, up until that morning we were peopleless too. My cousin and her six-year-old showed up. I didn't spend too much time with them though.   .That night...  After my cousins left I found Jason and Mike over at Mike's. Mike's cousins were there too. A week earlier Mike and his dad drove into Indiana to buy fireworks (once again, they're illegal here). He had a great assortment of them. A few houses down from Mike also had fireworks, but they launched them in the street. Mike and his family launched theres in the backyard. Anyways, behind Mike is a woman who works for the community patrol. They don't like Mike's family. So we were there having a great time eating and setting fireworks off. Suddenly we saw a police car. Mike's parents told us all to get in the house. We followed orders. The problem was the people across the street didn't get the warning. They got a fine for $50. We waited about 10 minutes, and started again. Then it happened. For a split second a head appeared in the blinds of the community patrol woman's house. A phone was to her ear. A few minutes later, sure enough the police are back. They once again miss Mike's house. Now, the lady's head appeared a few more times in the blinds. The people who got the $50 fine were no over at Mike's backyard (Their families are friends). They were extremely drunk, and began yelling at the patrols house "Shut the fuck up." "We'll get you back." "Karma's a bitch." Stuff like that.  The police came back once more and told us just to put whatever we had left back in the garage they had gotten a complaint. Before we left Mike's dad told us that Jason, Mike, and me would clean up the fireworks in the morning.   .Characters   My cousin  - My mom's cousin Melissa. From my mom's dad's side of the family. came for fourth of July  Six-year-old  - Melissa's daughter Ariel.  Jason & Mike  - Friends from the neighborhood  Community Patrol Woman  - Works for Vangaurd, the community patrol nazis.   .Music  Cyndi Lauper - Time after time Ryan Cabrera - On the way down Yellowcard - Underdog Yellowcard - Starstruck UB40 - Red, Red, Wine  -----Karma is a bitch  .Scene   Today I got up, took a shower, and went to the mall. I kinda forgot about the whole 'help Mike clean fireworks thing.' Hmm... I don't wanna type my whole day out, but I went to the Fox Valley Mall, and I bought MMBN4. My gameboy didn't work for like an hour after I bought it, and I was really pissed. I had been looking forward to that game for a month. The strange thing is that after I called Mike to apologize it started working. Voila... Karma is a bitch.

       .Scene  Ehh. That's all I can say. Let me give a little background information about my situation.  I lived in Florida for thirteen years of my fifteen year life. Ever since I've moved here things have been up and down. My biggest complaint is the people. You can't trust anybody here. Everybody is planning to screw you.   Last night I got called from Mike Affarano. Mike's pretty cool. Anyways, he called me last night and told me he was at Mike Neubauer's. See above about trust. Mike Neubauer and I were never, I dunno, friendly. He seems to be pissed off at everybody because it's the cool thing to do. So, I figured Mike was on speaker. The conversation went something like this:  Mike (A): Hey, Neubauer wants to ask you something about Mandy. Me: Ehh, I dunno. Mike (N): Hey, dude. I don't even know you Me: I know you. You went out with Sara, right? Mike (N): Yeah. (pause) Wait. Are you tall with glasses? Me: Yeah. Mike (N): Oh yeah, you said "Hi" to Sara once in the lunchline. Did you flirt with her? Me: Oh yeah dude, that's it. I flirted with your girlfriend. Mike (N): No, did you? Me: No, dude. So, you like Mandy? Mike (N): I dunno. Me: Well, I can't really tell you anything if you don't tell me. Mike (N): Yeah, I do. Do you think she'd cheat on me? Me:  This is where I screwed up  I dunno. She's always around a lot of guys, and she's not the most trusting person. Mike (N): Yeah, well if she does something with another guy I'll fight him. I put the last guy I fought into the hospital. If you hear anything you'll tell me, right? Dan: I dunno. Mandy's a friend. I just can't go blabbing her information to everyone. Mike (N): Come on dude, I know Mike'll tell me. Dan: I can't promise. Mike (N): Ok, See ya dude. Mike (A): OK. You're off speaker. You were on speaker this whole time. Me: ok. Anyways, See ya dude. Mike (A): See ya. *click*  So, this morning I get a call from Mandy. She asks why I told MIke Neubauer she'd cheat on him. I said, that I said, she wasn't so trusting. She didn't seem too mad and said she had to go. This is when I got mad at Mike Affarano because if Neubauer really liked Mandy he wouldn't tell her he called me to find out about her. ^Agree with the last line? Comment about it.  I took a shower right after, and then called Mandy back and apologized. I said I was sorry for talking about her behind her back. She said it was fine and not to worry about it.  So today I call Jason and we decide to head over to Mike (A)'s house. On our way there we see Mandy, Mike, Mike, a 12-year-old girl, a like 10-year-old boy, and her two little sisters. We say say hi, and Jason and I watch for awhile. I didn't talk to Mike (A), and Mike (A) didn't talk to me.  So time passes, and Mike (N) tries to intimidate me with questions like "Have you ever got into a fight?" and "Why are you here?" I answered both calmly, and I acted like I didn't know what was happening. Just like he was trying to make small-talk.  Here comes the climax of the situation: the 12-year-old girl, who I think I caught her name is 'Bitch' decides to tell me to go home, and also decides she's going to throw blocks of ice at me. I don't know what to do. She's 12 and I'm 15. Finally I threw a piece back, but over her head as a warning. She doesn't stop. Then her brother tells me to go to. So, because Jason is still there, and nobody really cared about me being there except for the siblings and Neubauer, I said that I wouldn't leave until Mandy told me to leave.  All Mandy said was "Well, I want Jason to stay..." I said ok, and walked toawrds my house. Mike (A) followed me, and I told him that I'd like for all 7 of them over there to go fuck themselves excluding Jason.  So... I've been home since then.

       .Scene  Ehh. Dad's sick and I'm exhausted. I was up all night talking to Bobby, Becca (www.patty-cake.blogspot.com), and Erin (www.enchantingbelle.blogspot.com). Not that exciting of a day. I don't really feel like going out. Maybe I'll meet Mandy at the pool later.  If you know me you'd know I've been grounded from my computer for like six months. My mom passworded the thing, and now I can only get on when she's home (She uses the password). Last night when I got off I turned it on sleep mode so I could get on it today. I thought all was good, and I got on at about 10 this morning. Then at 12, for the first time ever my dad came home early for work (He hasn't missed a day of work in nine years). Luckily he's sleeping so I guess I'll be on until he wakes up and yells at me.   .Characters  (In order of appearance) Dad - Abe Abdalla - Manager dude at Frito-Lay. Sick Today. Bobby - Best friend. Like a brother to me. Becca - In my inner circle of friends. One of Bobby's best friends. Erin - See 'Becca' Mandy - Girl that lives two blocks from me. Known to 'get around' (Can't be proven).   .Music  (From earliest to current song playing) Blink-182 - Rollercoaster Frickin A - Trend

      .Intro I'm going to use the title Untitled Post (#) to signify whenever I'm posting parts of a story I'm writing. Chances are I'll post these stories as I'm writing them which means they'll be out of order (I write scenes I like down in a writer's journal; most of the time the scenes won't be in order. I just write whenever an idea for the story pops into my head).  ----- ( Working title - Red Dress )  .Prologue 	It was pitch black outside, but looking at my watch I could tell it was only 6:00 PM. School had ended only three hours ago; about the time the storm had began to pull in. It had come in quickly, and it darkened the sky to the point of night. Why was I out? I'm wasn't sure myself. I guess it was fate. If all things really do happen for a reason, then my story is a fine example. 	There I stood: on top of a milk carton and peering into the old, dilapidated house. It was hard to see inside the living quarters, but I stood there, hoping I would get a glance of the inside of the haunted crevice, and prove myself to everybody. 	Rain fell from the dark sky, but I had no luck. There was nothing in the window except for me. I saw only my reflection. I saw my dark brown hair that hung over my sea-green eyes. I couldn't have been any more than seven-years-old. I continued trying to see something in the dark abyss. I was so close that I could see my short breaths on the window.  	All I remember is the blinding white flash murdering the darkness. I remember the chunks of dirt that flew up from the ground and hit me in the eye, but what I remember most of all before I collapsed onto the muddy earth, was the old, still, pale woman lying in the inside of the house, in the middle of a blue and brown tile floor with a sea of red surrounding her.  .Unknown 	"I'm just not some kind of experiment!" She threw her aims up and down in a violent rage. A flowerpot flew through the dark house and smashed against a wall somewhere. It was too dark to see where the flowerpot pieces fell to. "This is my life! You just can't put me into an experiment, and expect me not to feel. TO FEEL!" Another item in her hand shot across the darkness. "I killed him. I had nothing left." Her voice was calm now. "Do you know what love is?" She had acknoleged my presence for the first time. 	"No, but I do know it exists."  	"How?" Her voice echoed through the house. She was once again in screaming. "All love is," she paused, "is a justification." She was quiet again Her eyes stopped sparkling. I thought the end had finally come. "Do you know what that means?" 	I tried to respond, but I had taken too long. She jumped from the chair and started again. 	"The word... it's just an excuse. Nobody feels it. Let me put it into a more simple terms. Have you ever read Romeo and Juliet?" She didn't stop for me to answer. "Tybalt's death was inevitable. He had to die. He had no justification to kill Mercutio. Romeo slaughtered him." 	"He was sen-" I was cut off again. 	"Exile. Exile isn't death. Why did he kill Tybalt? One might say because of his love for his friend. That's not the true reason. It's the same reason he tresspassed on the Capulet's blacony. BECAUSE HE COULD! HE HAD LOVE! That's all that mattered to him in his mind. People don't need anything to live with except feeling like they did the right thing. He only died because he thought Juliet died. His justification vanished." 	I stood there. I wodnered how someone could actually think this. I wondered if she knew about the her victim's descendents wanting to find an answer about their father's death.

      Hmm. I'm Dan :).  Lemme give a quick intro.  I'm 6'1", brown hair, brown eyes. Pretty slim. 15 years old. I think I'm attractive. My favorite things? Friends, Swimming, Computers. I'm not that big of a sports dude, but once in awhile I'll try to watch a game with others (I always get side-tracked). As of now, I live in Shorewood, IL, but I lived in Florida for like 13 years, and before that New York for two years.  I think I'm going to use this for publishing articles and stories I right, as well as, I guess a journal.

         I've decided today that God hates me. See that picture up there? It's nice, right? Not for me ;(. That picture makes me extremely sad that I'm not at the Ross' house. No, not just because of the shirtless dudes, but because I  should  be there (Well, I mean I am there, but... you know what I mean).  See the kid behind Andrew? Wait, who am I kidding? You don't know who Andrew is. Well, Andrew is the one that looks like a toothpick. The kid behind him should be me. My best friend is in that picture smiling, right next to my other best friend. Then there's Joe, who's like the coolest guy I never met, but I bet that if I did meet him, I'd think he was just as cool.  I always think of life as a book. I'm being serious for once. Everybody has conflicts just as big as mine, but not everybody can see them. Everybody strives to be something they can't, and that's the challenge of life. It's like, that's what keeps us going... this hope. This hope makes up who we are.  Right now, I wish I could be in Florida. Making-out with Brittney, talking about things that we both don't understand with Becca, Jumping in Katie's pool, talking deep with Bobby, and frolicking with Erin. It makes me so sad when I think of all that I left. I also get kinda angry at myself when I think of what I didn't realize I had. I never realized how good my friends were to me, and how much I really appreciated them. I never realized how much leaning on Bobby's shoulder helped, and how Katie just being there helped me go through life. I don't even know anymore; it's all slipping away, but I don't think that I was that great to my friends in Florida.  In the end though, I believe everything happens for a reason. Mr. Agnostic-no-religion-rebel Daniel believes that everything happens for a reason. I love everyone there: The Ross', The Seifters, Brittney, Becca, Erin, and Bobby. Oh my god. I'm so sad I can't be there.   Work without hope is like nectar in a sieve   I really have no idea how idea how that quote plays into what I'm saying, but bleh. Ok Mr. Silly Daniel, let's stop being serious. *Reads the above* Wow. It sounds like I'm writing a fucking suicide note.  Anyways, I told you I'd do two things on yesterday's list, and I did do two of them:  -Haircut - Ehh, he cut it too short. -Mike's block party - Very awkward. I was kinda stressed, and I didn't really party. I (me) was kinda boring to say the least. The party was cool though. We got to sing Karaoke which rocked!  So... about 34 pages about "The Odyssey" are written in a yellow journal in my room. 18 books down. Oh, BTW, I'm asking everyone who has ever read the Odyssey and reads my blog to leave me a few Homeric Similes and where they're found.  Thanks.  Fucking life. \m/  It's 2:55 AM and this cramp in my wrist puts me back to sleep. (Story of the year - In the Shadows [2:10]).

      I was stuck deciding on a line from this verse of 'Lost Prophets - Last Train Home':   But there's still tomorrow Forget the sorrow And I can be on the last train home Watch it pass the day As it fades away No more time to care No more time, today   So blah. I hope you like the title.   Anyway, I've decided I'm not going to stress myself over the '.scene' thing. If I forget it then bleh. Bleh Bleh Bleh.  Speaking of stress, I handwrote 23 pages of homework today. 23 pages of wide-ruled notebook paper in a spiral notebook. 10 books of the Odyssey are done, and I have another 14 to do. I've been working on a graphic for my Odyssey journal, but I can't find the pictures I need. So, if you by any chance own like a picture farm with a picture of: Side profile of Poseidon's face, Side profile of some wind god dude, Athena's face OR a girl who likes like Athena. I don't expect anyobody to find them, but hey, it can't hurt to try.  Tomorrow I have a million things lined up, and I have a feeling I'll do two of them. Here's my list: A) Get a haircut B) Go clothes shopping C) Go to Crossroads fair D) Go to Mike's block party  In addition to that I'm going to have to breathe, eat, and probably use the bathroom. So, I've come up with this schedule:  9:00 Wake up 9:30 Do stuff 8:00 PM: Finish doing stuff 8:30 PM: Eat, breathe, go to bathroom 11:00 PM: Sleep  This way I won't lose track of what I'm doing. It's a good thing I'm organized... and hot.   Stuff.

       50 posts today!  Today is my fiftieth post! 50 posts ago I gave an intro about myself, and started this wonderous thing called a blog. What a great decision that was. How else would you hear about THIS DRAMA! "omgomgomgomg will he ever get back to florida?", "did he just call that dude hot?", "omgomgomg what a hottie!", and "omgomgomg teenage angst." You've been with me in the good, the better, and the best. You were here when I published Red Dress, and you, yes you, read everyone one of my posts, found every secret message, and have tried to emulate my style. :( I can see it didn't work out. omg 50!  So, now that fifty posts have passed, what do I plan to do? Well, first of all I've decided to chop down many rainforests in an attempt to give Brazillian people homes. After that I think I'm going to start a campaign against women, and later I may begin my own country. Sounds cool, huh? Well, the only way to hear about me and my attempts to Nirvana is to read my blog, or call me, but nobody ever calls me. :(  This conversation has been dead on arrival! Fall out boy rocks :D.  Also, if you haven't seen my blog links yet, scroll down and pay attention to the right! Yeah, I made all of those :). I'm working on other people's for other blogs now. If you want to request one then e-mail me at 'notask8r@gmail.com.'  Today was cool because I'm so cool. I made everyone's blog links, which I'm proud of, and I tried to start "The Odyssey" again, but I got distracted. :(. I'm going to fail if I don't start it soon.  Hmm, what's going to happen in the future? A ticker(See top of this post) should be up tonight with breaking news, and other facelifts. Stay tuned!  You can thank your lucky stars... That everything I wish for will never come true!

      (Updated 8/12/04)  .Scene  'Story of the year - Anthem of our dying day' is one of the best songs ever written. I can't tell you why; I mean, I guess I could, but some parts are indescribable.   From up here the city lights  burn  Like a thousand miles of fire And I'm here to sing this anthem Of our dying day  Of our dying day Of our dying day Of our dying  For a second I wish the  tide  Would swallow every inch of this city As you gasp for air tonight   The way that provoke the sights of fire, and then the thought of water. I don't know if it was on purpose, but it's really good. I think there's actually a name for word placement like this: juxtaposition.   jux·ta·po·si·tion ( P )  Pronunciation Key  (jkst-p-zshn) n.  The act or an instance of juxtaposing or the state of being juxtaposed.   Who the fuck knows ;\.   Lately, I've been working on blog icons for my blog webring (Scroll down and pay attention to the right). I'll wait for ya.  Back yet? They're pretty aren't they? They're in no particular order other than the earliest made to the latest made. Most of them are made with the same filters and stuff; mostly fades.   Katie's  - Katie's link is made of five layers. A pastelish rainbow background takes over the whole first layer, while a huge faded muffin takes over the second layer. The third, fourth, and fifth layers come from an inside joke with Katie: the infamous talking muffin. Layer three is actually two muffins side by side. Layer three is a speech ballon, and layer five is the title of Katie's blog.   Mine  - I wasn't sure how to display someone being unsensitive, but I decided I would base it off an older avatar of mine. Bowser's face is distorted in the background by an ocean wave, and two goombas face forward. Originally the princess was in the middle to add to the whole unsensitive theme, but I took her out. I guess if you really want an explanation for that other than it didn't look good, you can use the irony of 'mrunsensitive' because I am very sensitive ;\.   Brittney's*  - Brittney's link is made of three layers. The first layer is actually her picture from her blog, but it's distorted: I wrapped the whole picture into a circle. When I first went looking for a background for her link I decided on red because of her hair ;\. Interesting. Hmm, the second layer is one of my favorite text affects, but Brittney's text ahs a wave to symbolize the beach and florida. The third layer is a phrase on her blog which I really like.    Bobby's*  - Bobby's link is the least artistic. It's very simple, but very nice looking. I like the ways the colors contrast on each other, and I also like the way that the colors are in fact cherry colors. Three cherries can be seen behind Bobby's name.   Becca's  - Becca's is very interesting because of the fact that there are so many things going on; the most apparent is her blog's title. This picture is made up of three layers and a background. One layer is pink cake, one layer is the flag of Great Britain, and the third is massive text (for her massive personality?). I wanted to add a lot more to Becca's because Becca has so much going on, but I thought that there were already too many things going on.   Erin's  - Erin's picture is one of the best I think. As nice as it looks, Erin's took the least time because the pictures I wanted were very easy to find. The background is a picture of the beast, he shows through Belle and also through the text. I thought it was a very interesting effect to have Belle overlapping the beast's face. What really pulls the picture together is the Walt Disney font though. Nice, eh? It uses the same text affect as Brittney. I'm going to be said when I have to delete it though. I'm going to have to if Erin continues not updating.   Kristin's  - Kristin's picture is very simple, but I like it like that. Her's took the most time because I kept trying to add more, and then taking other stuff off. I decided to make the background very light, to bring out the line "You bring out the bad in me." Not too clever, but eh =\. I really like Kristin's background. It's made up of pinks, blues, and greens, and I like the effect of the sad face in the middle of all of the colors. Yes, those are dance shoes on the bottom right. I figured her icon wouldn't be complete without something to do with dance.   Bri's  - Bri's icon is very interesting because I had nothing to work with. What the heck is 'boho'?. Anyways, I decided to use something I was thinking for Brittney: huge text. The nice thing was that Bri's title could be cut into 'wondergirl' and most people would think that was her title unless they really looked at it. It parallels Bri, she's a lot more than meets the eye. You really have to get to know her before you think you know her. Did that make sense? 'bohowondergirl' uses the same text affect that Brittney's and Erin's use, but there's more of that white border. In the background is a tree. Why a tree? Well, I looked up boho online and I saw something that said 'boho/earthy girls.' So maybe boho has to do with the earth. There's also a question mark faded into the middle of the icon.   I put a lot of thought into these. Ok, if you have a "*" by your name then it basically means that I may change your icon one of these days, if I get time. PLEASE TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK OF YOUR ICON!  I had other stuff to talk about, but I forg...  Oh yeah! Meh FL friends started school today! They were all looking forward to it, but they only had 'OK' days. Poor guys. I   Then there's "Red Crystal" another story I'm writing. I just realized both of my works have 'red' in their titles. Anyways, it's about this kingdom of humans who has been waring with a kingdom of sorcerers/esses for years, and the oldest son of the family begins to get nightmares and cast spells in his sleep. He searches out a crystal that if broken should stop his nightly occurences. He's afraid he won't be crowned king if someone finds out, and when he breaks it something happens that he never dreamed happens.  And finally, Megaman X7, which totally rocks was played by me today. Thanks Terrance!  Holy crap! A talking muffin!

       .Scene  I was trying to find a summer-e song, but I didn't. So there. Life is cool. I went to work with my mom again which was pretty kickass. I got to help her with some more filing and stuff so I think I earned my gold star.    I came home, got on the computer, got bitched at by Mike for something I didn't do, and that all led up to right now.  Florida school starts tomorrow!  Then there's Mandy. She came to my house last night and decided to bitch at me for something I didn't do. Bitch. Goddamn woman need to control themselves.  Hmm, the Spanish salesmen people Becca, Bobby, and me pranked keep calling my house.  Phew, that was a long entry.   The round has ended!

       .Scene  Well, it seems one of my friends is a liar. yes, that's right Bobby, you're a liar. Nobody likes you.    Well, i dont have ANYTHING left to talk about ... I think I want to have the halloween party this year... if my parents say blah... blah blah blah  What also pisses me off, other than the fact that he lied, is that he capitalized the word 'anything' like he was trying to make it strong. So he didn't had ANYTHING to talk about? BS, he had a Halloween party to talk about. Today's title comes from 'Blink182 - Rollercoaster' My favorite song :). So, I'm talking to Bri right now. Go me! It's weird because we never knew how much we had in common. We can relate to each other a lot which is always good. I hope we have a lot of classes together :. If she would drop that waste-of-a-class "women's history" we might. I could get through that class in half a quarter. just kidding Bri ;\.  Hmm, so far today, I did the first two journals for The Odyssey, and hmm, played RCT2. Check out meh park:   urlLink      urlLink      urlLink     The second one is a picture of club beach, and that's meh favorite mart of the park :). See the boardwalk?  Anyways, Bobby put me in the mood to throw a Halloween party. I'll look into it. In fact, if you live in IL, and you would come, leave a comment. I might be able to pull it off. Candy, music, pool, big screen TV w/ movies. Hey! The more I think about it the better it sounds.  Also on the horizon is the fall play, which I'm trying out for :D!  We tried so hard to say goodbye...

       .Scene  Blah. Today I have the Florida blues, and I think I can blame Bri for it ;/ (jk). I went to her play today, and it was OK. It was a real bummer I had to go alone, and that kinda upset me. The first act bored me to teears, but the second act was very good. I got really disappointed at the end though: I didn't really get to talk much to Bri, and I didn't get to say a word to Katie or Katey. :(. Then, as if that wasn't bad I couldn't go to the afterparty because it was too far :(. Well, maybe they'll have another one tomorrow after the 2:00 show. (If so, call me guys!)  Hmm... what else happened? Oh! I finally got RCT2 to work. I feel bad for not paying for it, but eh ;\, whatcha gonna do?  School is in about 10 days, and I haven't started the Odyssey homework :(.

        So, I changed my screenname today, and I have to say... it really rocks :D! Not only does it sound cool, but it has a secret message... much like the FedEx logo. So, without further ado... my new screenname is: heartsrocK3  Can you find the secret message? clever, eh? I thought so. What? You didn't find it? Look harder =\.  Actually, I didn't notice the cool secret message until Britt told me, but let's keep that on the dl.  I got to play meh favorite game today!  Today, Rick James died. I didn't know who Rick James was until about twenty minutes ago when I looked him up online. It seems he was a popular musician. RIP Rick James, and let's hope that "I'm Rick James, Bitch!" line goes with him. I almost used one of his lyrics for today's posts, and then I told myself not to waste my time :).  I was planning to go to Bri's show tonight, but I postponed it until tomorrow. My mom got an MRI done, and in the simplest words possible, a spinal disc is pushing against her nerve. The scientific name for it is 'A Bulging disc.'  Kristin left for Jupiter, Florida today :(. I haven't seen her all summer, but I'm just realizing it now :(. I miss you Kristin! I'm planning on taping the Michael Jackson movie for her, but if I forget I'm not going to worry because I'm betting she has three VCRs ready to tape every second of it.  Way away, away from here I'll be.  (This is the first post for the scavenger hunt, see if you can keep up.)  Yellowcard - Way Away  *continued* Check my next post for more info.  I think I'm breaking out I'm going to leave you now Theres nothing for me here, it's all the same And even though I know That everything might go Go downhill from here, I'm not afraid  Way away away from here I'll be Way away away so you can see How it feels to be alone and not believe (Feels to be alone and not believe) Feels to be alone and not believe anything  You can't stop me now You can't hold me down You can't keep me here, I'm on my way I've made it this far now And I'm not burning out No matter what you say, I'm not afraid  Way away away from here I'll be Way away away so you can see How it feels to be alone and not believe (Feels to be alone and not believe) Feels to be alone and not believe anything  Letting out the noise inside of me (Letting out the noise inside of me) Every window pane is shattering (Every window pane is shattering) Cutting off my words before I speak (Cutting off my words) This is how it feels to not believe  Letting out the noise inside of me (Letting out the noise inside of me) Every window pane is shattering (Every window pane is shattering) Cutting off my words before I speak (Cutting off my words) This is how it feels to not believe  Way away away from here I'll be Way away away so you can see How it feels to be alone and not believe (feels to be alone and not believe) Feels to be alone and not believe anything  Hmm. He doesn't believe. Literally the song is about rebellion. It seems to me as though the person has decided he's fed up with the rules. 'Way away, away from here I'll be' can go two ways; either he's secluding himself from the rest of the world, or he means it literally, and he's running away. I do agree the latter seems like the best explanation, but the third verse gives the picture that he's risen up and is voicing his opinion. The song gives the idea that he's screaming, but it could also mean he's using a great argument. He's letting out what's been bottled inside. The second through fourth lines tell us his attempts were futile; he failed. He no longer has a window into their head maybe? They finally cut him off, they don't believe.  What's the song trying to tell us? I think the main theme of this song is 'unfairness.' Sometimes you just can't get people to agree with you, and sometimes you can't change people, and even if this is true you need to voice your opinion because that's all anybody can do: voice their opinion.

       .Scene  So, I went back to meh mom's work today, and I realized something; people aren't half bad. Of course some people are dumb, the lady who stairs at everyone, but others are cool. So, my interest in people in general has been re-born.   As most of you can probably see, I updated Red Dress. I really need Bri to proofread it, but that can wait. The scene is suppossed to show the good in people; I'm not sure it does that great of a job. I wanted it to portray that Valentina is done with Dean, the man who got her sent to an asylum. The problem is that plot holes run rampant. Why would the narrator describe the wedding in such good tone if Dean had been cheating on Valentina? The problem with changing the tone to unhappiness is that it really wasn't Dean's faul that Valentina is a crazy woman. That scene will most definitely be revised before the final draft.

      It's back! This is my fifth scene if I'm not mistaken. The story is finally taking shape.  If you're lost, check my other 'Untitled Posts.'   (red dress)  -This scene is the final scene in which we see Valentina. It's Dean's wedding. Unknown to the narrator, and to Valentina for some time, Dean lived after his pier accident. Before this Valentina had planned to ruin the wedding, and now we see her plan unfold...  I sat on the brown pew wondering when the ceremony would start. The church looked happy, just as everyone in the place. The building was merry and true; it had been decorated in red and white with roses resting hap-hazardly at each table. White streamers hung from the windows. Everyone was prepared for a wonderful wedding. The doors at one end of the aisle swung open, and Dean walked down the aisle. For the first time I had ever seen, Dean's handsome face was totally emotionless. He smiled, but after a second or so his face was plain again. He wore this expression to the platform. A traditional bridal song began to sound from the organ, and the audience turned their heads toward the door. The doors remained closed; no bride appeared. The organ player looked puzzled; should he keep playing or should he stop? A few people in the audience gasped, and the others began to cry. The doors got thrown open after the long period of silence though, but something was wrong. A tall, brown-haired woman walked through the doorway. Tears streaming down her face left streaks in her corroded foundation, and her hair looked like it hadn't been brushed in months. Valentina took the the platform. The church was completely silent, and the audience was in total awe. Nobody did anything but watch the heartbroken woman climb to the altar. She walked over to the couple's table, and grabbed the single bottle of champagne. She removed the cap, and turned the bottle over, spilling it's contents all over the floor. A clear looking liquid spilled onto the carpet. Something was wrong though; the sweet smell of champagne didn't fill the air. The smell of almonds got caught in my nose. Arsenic. Valentina let go of the bottle, and it shattered. She straightened herself out, and walked down the isle peacefully.

       .Scene  The odyssey is over: I have finally gotten to the end of MegaMan X. Yes, it was beaten at approximately 4 PM today. We made it to the last Sigma stage, and HUZZAH! we beat the Sigma virus. Thank god. I've had that game since like 1995, and it's finally been beaten. Notice how I said  it's finally been beaten  instead of "I finally beat it." I didn't complete the game. Randy did :(. Go Randy!  Idaho has no meaning whatsoever... (continued)   Speaking of completing things, I completed the  Nectar in a Sieve  homework. Soon I'll have to start 'The Odyssey.' bleh. Sparknotes seems good about now. I might end up using them. I can't decide.  ...and was previously suggested as a name for several other states.  Something I've decided: I'm going to start some sort of daily thingy in my blog. Who knows what the hell it'll be. If I had ideas for  Red Dress  I'd post new scenes each day. I'm thinking of starting a photography type thing, and I'll post my pictures here.  Scroll down a bit and look to the right.  BTW, now that I think about it, I do have a scene for Red Dress. The conclusion of Valentina's story. A big wedding is going on, and she interrupts it with tears coming down her face. I'm not telling why yet ;/. If you are interested in  Red Dress , leave a comment or something.  One more thing to discuss. Mugglenet is having a Harry Potter contest. I think the artwork is really good so I'm hoping some of my readers will vote. I voted for number three. Link:  urlLink http://www.mugglenet.com/hbpcontest/   Life.  http://www.livejournal.com/users/bohowondergirl/ (Bri)   .Characters   We  - Jason, Mike, Randy, and me. Jason and Mike I've known since I moved here, and Randy is from the bus.   .Music  Sugarcult - I'm bouncing off the walls

       .Scene  Today was cool. I finished 15/20 quotes from  Nectar in a Sieve , and I also finished the character analysis page. I'm cool. Coolio.  So, Bri's decided to updated everyone on my love life. Yes, it's true. Go you, Bri!   In other news, I've been eating more healthy than ever! Go healthiness. I haven't eaten anything other than fruits, vegetables, white meat, whole wheat bread, and yogurt/cheese in like three months.   I'll resume life later.

       .Scene  Today I got to go to work with my madre (That's Spanish for all you French-takers). It was interesting, but the people in my mom's work seem anti-social. They're very awkward. I was walking down the hallway smiling at people, and nobody even looked at me. Later, I had nine files in my hand, and I walked down the hallway, and like seven people gave me "The look." The one where you're not sure what they mean, but it's not a compliment or anything nice. The strange thing is that after the first few times I visited, everyone talked about how nice looking I was, and how nice I was. Peoples are dumb ;\.  Yesterday I started  Nectar in a Sieve  which is actually an OK book. It's about this Indian (India) women and her hardships. It has a lot to do with sex though so that makes it kind of interesting. Not erotic, but it holds my interests in some scenes. As of now I'm on page 120, and I'd rate the book a 6/10. Where I am currently, it seems as though it's a bunch of situations put together. It's starting to all connect though.  I'm going to jump from Erotic Indians to clothes. I've decided to return a pair of pants I bought... I don't like them as much as I thought I did. The good thing is I have $150 in Pac Sun bucks, so I can buy some stuff.  Hmm, one last thing to talk about and that's meh haircut. I kept the top long; I'm hoping it'll be down to my eyebrows one of these days. I got my mom to cut the sides though. I like it, but she doesn't. Oh well.  (8:58pm)   Dude you have to hear what happened (8:58pm)   i missed once (8:58pm)   but i saw them (8:59pm)   all last night (8:59pm)   ;/ (8:59pm)   =/ (8:59pm)   Brittney and her friends snuck into this stadium (8:59pm)   and they were watching a baseball game (8:59pm)   and being all obnoxious; asking for autographs from the mascot and screaming (8:59pm)   you think you're attractive (8:59pm)   rofl (8:59pm)   so Bobby and me called the stadium (8:59pm)   and reported them to security (8:59pm)   and gave them descriptions (8:59pm)   -_- (8:59pm)   roffle. (8:59pm)   ROFL (8:59pm)   ROFL (8:59pm)   ROFL (8:59pm)   ROFL (8:59pm)   ROFL (8:59pm)   ahahahahaha (8:59pm)   ;/ (9:00pm)   I'm posting this convo on my blog so I don't have to re-type the story.  End.  I need to talk about my trip sometime.   I hid today's secret message well.   .Music   Billy Joel - Piano Man  Sugarcult - Memory (Acoustic) SR71 - Right Now New Found Glory - Failure's not flattering  (2 secret messages)
