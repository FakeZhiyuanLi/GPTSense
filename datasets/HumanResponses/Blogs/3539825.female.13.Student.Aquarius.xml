      Well i got back from the cruise today...and it was awesome!! ok, when we pulled up to the new orleans cruise terminal ( keep in mind that i was there with bobby and lauren) the ship was bigger than all the buildings! it was soo huge!  well anyway, that night when we sat down at dinner i thought "ok these people we're gonna sit with look ok, but i was sooo beyond wrong. ok she didnt really bother me but there was a 6 year old that enjoyed spelling small words to my mom. the parts that really bothered me were: the 3 year old that liked to put his hand down his moms shirt and then cry and be passed over the table, the REALLY FAT FREAKIN WIFE, and the geeky husband that looked like austin powers.   so we spent the next day wondering around the ship and had fun but didnt do anything special. that night was when the cruise got better. that was the night that the old table people got moved to another dining room (thank god!) and we actually sat with some more interesting people. theres mark, jessica, christy (spelled something lik that), pam, and paul. NO 3 OR 6 YEAR OLDS!!!   tuesday was another wondering around day.  wednesday we pulled into montego bay, jamaica. this is where it gets fun. we took lik a 30 min. ride to chukka blue and we waited around a lil bit. then we got onto the horse we were gonna ride. we rode for about 45 min. until we came to the beach and then we rode bareback into the ocean! it was really cool but then one of the horses shit in the water and my mom got all pissed. but I  had a good time.  thursday was grand caymen. we shopped around until about 10:30 and then we got on a bus to this resort thingy. then we boarded this boat and rode for haf an hour to stingray city. you might have already gessed-we swam with stingrays! some people are scared but stingrays are soo cool and so huge! so anyway that was fun and i think it was my favorite island.  and then came friday. that was cozumel, mexico. we didnt have much time to do anything else so we went straight to the meeting place.thats where they gave us tickets and lil bracelets for chankanaab national park. when we got there (it took about five min.) the tour guide showed us around the park and then took us onto the beach. here is where we got lockers cuz we cant take our stuff in the water to swim with......dolphins!! it was awesome! i mean i have done it before but it doesnt get old like other stuff.  so then it was that night that lauren showed how dull she is. mark, christy, and me were going to see meet the parents in the arcade and we invited lauren...because we had to. but of couse she didnt go because she just wasnt quite boring enough! ok so we had fun at the movie but mom and bobby were stuck with lauren.. and she was bored and didnt want to come to the movie cuz she said we didnt invite her (BS).  and so she was a little freak who should have bin shot! at least if i had to put up with her so much i would have wanted to.  so that was all the fun stuff we did really i mean, sunday night we all played ping pong (well i didnt do so well) but at least we tried to play ping pong and that was pretty much all the good times on the ship and thats as detailed as i get so if u didnt think i did a good job                   ::.BITE ME.::

      ok ive only got a few hours to wait until sunday. y is sunday so important, u ask? well, sunday morning we are leaving for New Orleans, LA to get on board the carnival conquest! we are going to Montego Bay, Jamaica and Cozumel, Mexico. im really not sure what the other place is though. (im pretty dumb) well anyway we would have just driven down there and let granny drive us back up here, but she just got some blood stream infection and so she cant drive us there. so of course the first thing my mom did was yell for her idiot boyfriend and his bozo daughter, lauren. im not really sure what makes bobby so creepy but he just has that way of really creeping you out and his daughter is just a little, or a lot, boring. so all im gonna say is thank you to the person who invented portable cd players, cuz im gonna need to plug my ears with something.

BluCrushed3: lol Previous message was not received by hello im mark2 because of error: User hello im mark2 is not available.  so I really like Mark and he is the only guy that is really safe in my opinion, but he needs to have someone to actually date. So whats a girl to do?

BluCrushed3: this is a very very long story... BluCrushed3: first we met another girl named julie in the hot tub on saturday and that day she introduced us to all of her girlfriends (i lost count how many people she came with) and we were all friends BluCrushed3: and then the next day they all walked up to the water and i noticed there were 2 more people...and they were guys BluCrushed3: the short one was lance and the taller one was garrett and i thought that garrett was cute but i just thought he was just another hottie...but it turned out he was alright BluCrushed3: later that day i found out that he liked me too and so i was like *ya ok i can fly with that* BluCrushed3: and later we were all in the HOT TUB!! BluCrushed3: heheO:-) MobSceneRedHead: hahaha MobSceneRedHead: Missa...... MobSceneRedHead: *Goes all motherly* Whst have I todl you abotu hottubs?! BluCrushed3: and he had his arm around 2 of the other girls (they were really just close friends) BluCrushed3: and then the other girls got up and went to the pool....and he was all  " but now im all alone" so.... BluCrushed3: i sat next to him and he was all " OK!" BluCrushed3: he said if no one else wants to sit over here then BOTH ARMS GO ON HER....i was like "shit i am soooo ooooooo glad my mom isnt here for this" MobSceneRedHead: So,he wrapped you up in his arms? BluCrushed3: heheO:-)    ya MobSceneRedHead: HAHA! BluCrushed3: later that night it happened again and then when we all went to the pool Alyssa was like "do u know what we were all laughing about?" and i said no and she told me that he was looking at my boobs.... BluCrushed3: and the next time we got in the hot tub.... BluCrushed3: he kissed me on the cheek...and i think his hand got a little farther south than it needed to be.... BluCrushed3: pretty far north too. MobSceneRedHead: wait MobSceneRedHead: Like he went north (boobs) and south (Hip)? BluCrushed3: and then sunday night we got all of their sns and we hugged said goodbye and im prolly never gonna see him again BluCrushed3: and ya MobSceneRedHead: ah MobSceneRedHead: Ohhohhh MobSceneRedHead: ohhh MobSceneRedHead: ohhh MobSceneRedHead: ohhh MobSceneRedHead: ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh BluCrushed3: the part that really makes me feel like a slut is that i dont even know his last name MobSceneRedHead: So?
