        Hey there I hope everybody is doing well.  A question that has been going through my mind is Why is is easier to obey God than to trust him? Well its easy....because when you obey you do what is expected but when you trust you have to wait, accept and act...even if you don't agree or want to. Sometimes this can be hard because we do not know how to trust God because we are so used to following direction. Also it is easy to obey God when it is to our own convenience (whether it be serving God or not) To trust we have to have faith in God and his control through the good and bad...yes even the bad....it has  a purpose.  What am I saying you might ask. Well as Christians we must have faith that God has control of everything and everyone constantly for his glory and the good of his people. "In him all things hold together." (Colossians 1:17). The bible says that he gives life to everything (Nehemiah 9:6).  God sustains us and cares for us undying.  It is also important to recognize that no one can act outside of God's sovereign will or against it. God's will is invisible and unconprensible.  "we know that God is sovereign, but we also know, that in His sovereignty, God has placed us in a world of sin and suffering from which we have no immunity," and again "God's love...for us, does not place us in a protected position." This is important to know because we must understand that there are going to be bad things we are going to go through but we can be comforted in knowing that God also knows our pains and sympathizes with us. If God exercises his sovereignty in regard to sparrows, most certainly He will exercise it in regard to his children. (Mat 10:29-31). To be anxious means that we are not trusting God. Instead of feeling that way we must run to our Lord as children and pray. Some Christians often are unwilling to accept the fact that God is working, because they don't understand how He is working, they have chosen to substitute the doctrine of Chance for the doctrine of divine providence. Furthemore we must establish our beliefs by the bible and be refreshed by the word not by our own experiences. Eventhough we do not understand God's ways He is sovereingly at work in all our circumstances. It is essential that we realize that eventhough we might get frustrated, be anxious, and suffer we have the calmness and confidence that our suffering is under the control of an all-powerful and all loving God, our suffering has meaning and purpose in God's eternal plan and he brings or allows to come into our lives only that which is for his glory and our good. ....TRUST...TRUST...TRUST....One of the things the Lord is asking us to do.

       Hello  sorry for taking a while but last time I tried posting something up it messed up and it didn't go through...u could only imagine how upset I felt. Anyway I guess it was not meant for me to post that message. I won't rewrite it because it was too long but the main point of the last message was describing where I come from, my relationship with God and what I am going through at the moment. The biggest thing that I am going through is being able to resist temptation and trusting God. The scripture that I have held close to my heart and has kept me going through tough times has been "Entrust your ways to the lord and he will act on your behalf"  This scripture has served me for encouragement and a form of direction because there has been times where I have been wanting to do things "my way" even if it is not the right thing to do. But lately I have been trying to sacrifice my self to God and submitting myself--which can get difficult because I get anxious easily when I do not know what to do or I have no answers. Either way God always seems to hold my hand and guide me I just have to learn how to be more humble and loving. Please pray for: One for my family so that they let God work in their lives and so that they can share with his love and grace, For my relationship with my boyfriend  let God provide us with love, patience, understanding and may he help us carry our relationship in a Godly way for his glory, and last for my sister in laws family may God provide them with the strength to get through these tuff times (their son was shot and killed a week ago) and also may God give me many opportunities to serve him and  glorify him. I pray for wisdom and more love. In his son's precious name~ AMEN  Well I hope you all are doing well. I appreciate your friendship and I thank God for being there for me. Blessings

        Hello Good morning to all of you. This weekend was very exciting for me because I had a lot of time to hear the Lord's word. Friday I met with one of my friend from school at Starbucks. Her name is Lissette and we were just talking about how our lives have been changed for the better because of Jesus in our life. It was a good time of fellowship she invited me to go with her to a conference the next day Saturday. I was a little anxious not knowing what to expect but I hoped to find the Lord and hear what he had to say to me and I decided to go. This conference that I went to was called the "she conference." What this conference is about is a series of conferences in which they take proverbs 31 which talks about the ideal wife and takes the principles from that verse and makes it applicable to use in the 21st century. The verse we went over was 15 it was about rising while it is still dawn and she prepares food for her servants. The gave us various examples of how to take that verse and apply it to our daily lives. The rising up while is still dim meant that we are the light  guiding us through Jesus Christ and we must spread it to those around us we must nourish those around us with the word of God. They also stressed how we should be driven by God and our only purpose in life is to serve, know him and glorify our savior and creator in all the days of our life. The Conference was great and the speaker was real and very motivating. Sunday I went to church and that was good too. My boyfriend and I also had some time together and we went over some friends house to have dinner that was a good time of fellowship. I thank God for this weekend and for his limitless blessings. Prayer request: Please pray for my relationship w/ the lord and with Sergio, I pray for God's hand of healing for Sergio's brother, for his ministry and I pray for both our families. Thank You Jesus I love you

      Hey to those who might read I just want to say hello and just give some praise to God.  God has been working through me immensively throughout this past year and I just wanted to say that I am SO GRATEFUL for it. I pray that God continue molding me in a way which will best serve him for his glory. I wanted to praise him for providing me with a substitute job position that I applied to. I am really excited because I will be finally working in a setting which I will enjoy. Not to say that I hate my job....But I am finally going to be in a classroom. Yey! HOoray! Thank YOu God. I know I am only going to be a substitute for the meantime but I hope that  through the short periods I will be spending with the students, I will be able to positively motivate and encorage the students to pursue a higher education and to value their education and to know that there are many posibilities by receiving an education. I also want to motivate them to be involved in service learning and to be active members in their neighborhoods and in their society.

      Hola chiquillos Well I am here at my boyfriends house washing my clothes (because the washer at my house broke down) eating some chicken soup and drinking freshly squeezed OJ yummy!!!  Anyway this weekend was good for me. I was anticipating this weekend ever since Monday because of the stress of school. Therefore the weekend started early on Thursday.  I went to a community dinner  that I got invited to (it was from Sergio's church) luckily my boyfriend got home early and he was able to go with me. I was having a good time but I was later sad and disappointed at some of the comments that were said to Sergio.  I did not want to feel any remorse towards certain people but it was almost inevitable. Mexicans I am still convinced are the most hospitable people. I did not only feel  bad but I guess I felt more disapointed because the person that said some rude comments about us showing up was a christian, and our Father teaches us to be hospitable and loving to one another. Well I guess I will leave it to God to place conviction in their hearts. The only thing I can do is pray for them. A side from that the night went well we went to go watch the Matrix Revolution. I thought it was the best one from all three.  I was impressed by all the graphics and detail that the producers/animators did in creating that movie. It was interesting and I was comfortable sitting by my man. The thing I love is being comfortable at the movies. I can't stand not being comfortable. I don't think Sergio likes it either because then I act like a worm and move around a lot. Friday we went to go watch Elf and that was hilarious. I didn't think it was going to be as funny as I thought. Some parts cracked me up. I think everyone should watch this movie. Watching this movie also reminded me of the best holiday that is comming up...Christmas...no and its not just for the food and presents but for celebrating Jesus' birth. That is the best gift God has ever given us.  Saturday was a joyous day for me as well because I was able to spend the entire day with my family. We celebrated my nieces and nephews birthday. Yes it was a true Mexican party. The main entree for the  night was Pozole and there was the traditional pinatas.  The night was fun but I missed Sergio's company that day. He was busy hosting a couple of work groups that came down to work at his church. Sunday was more of a productive day. Sergio picked me up early in the morning and we went to his house and did homework. Later on that day we went to the first meeting of our care group from church. It was the introduction meeting. The married couple Kim and Trey which has also being giving me and Serg counseling are the leaders and told us the purposes of their care group. I was concerned about this because I did not know what to expect but I was glad when they said that the purposes to care group were 1) relationships 2) Discipliship and 3) Accountability.  I pray that everything works out and that God uses this time to teach us and to speak to us in the different areas we need and for him to carry on with his will in our lives. (For everyone in the care group). Finally today is Monday....and I had to sub the same 7th grade class I subbed for on Friday. It was a better day but I still had to deal with some behavioral and attitude problems. Lukily I was able to manage them appropriately.  Well I have to go check on my clothes I just wanted to say hi and let you all know about my great weekend? I hope you guys had a great weekend. I pray that God continue abundantly blessing you in many ways. Please let me know email me or something....wlarios2@hotmail.com

       Hi (Rhema and Sergio my only two blog supporters)  Actually I am not sure who reads my blog but if you do thanks. At least I feel that I am not just writing for nothing. Writing is good because it gives you total freedom to express.  I want to start off by thanking the lord for all the blessings he pours onto me (even though I do not deserve any), I also want to thank those of you who have been praying for me and who have allowed me to share my friendship with.   These past couple of weeks have been very hectick. School has been very demanding stealing all of my time...personal...leisure...and sleep. Eventhough, I have thankfully had Sergio to help me cope with everything and for encouragement. I enjoy my classes and I have really learned a lot of practical things that will definite influence the way I teach and think about education. I am greatful because I have a big responsibility,  each  child that I will teach, and I have to be the best prepared teacher I can be. I just started substitute teaching and the experience has been great. I am prayingh that I get hired with a few other districts so that I can strictly go into substituting and possibly say good bye to my present job.  I have been struggling with relationships. I have two non-christian friends and it has been really hard to share life when they are living totally different lifestyles. Its hard because they are my best friends and I really enjoy their friendship. I just pray that God help me dealing with this situation and that he allow me the strenght to make the right decisions. I am also having some trouble with my boyfriend. I pray that God reveal what he has for both of us in a timely manner and that he gives us grace and wisdom to accept that decision. I also pray that I spend my time forming new tight relationships with the people at church and for me to stay humble.  This walk is a long one and maybe one that will never end but my heart is firm in following God and conforming my ways to his ways. Romans 12:1-2 has been in my mind for a while now and I just pray that I am able to be more wise and make the right sacrifices to be the righteous women God will want me to be. Blessings to all  Los Quiero  Adios Wendy

      Hello! Well its finally Friday!!! I am glad I have been extremely busy lately studying with my friend and co-worker Lissette for the CSET which is like HELL. (5 hour test on social studies, history, visual and performing arts, human development, Physical education, math, science, english, grammar-its a mixture of multiple choice and essay questions). We need to take the exam to be able to get our credential and start working. I am happy to say our studying has been going great and we are as I say killing...each section. I just pray that God give us patience and the knowledge to do well on test date (Jan 24).  I am also excited because I was able to see Sergio today. It was nice we went by the Rose Bowl in Pasadena and sat at a bench and looked at the sky and talked about what we have been reading in scripture and what we have been learning from God..through God. We had to come back because it got to cold.  I thank God because He has been blessing me in numerous ways. To mention one I have been blessed with a wonderful job. I just got another permanent assignment. I just pray everything works out.  Well just wanted to drop some lines got to go adios amigos y amigas.

      [ Wed Jan 07, 11:11:57 AM | Wendy Larios | edit ] Well for the hundred time....I was not able to the last blog...this really irritates me. I guess it was good afterall because it was a lot of venting. I guess I just needed to get it out and no one had to read it. But I don't know whenever this happens I always get discouraged to write.  Wow I haven't wrote in a long time...like since November of last year....ha ha...seems like a long time but it's only been two months. This last year has been amazing and I thank God for that. I have been very blessed and had many opportunities to learn. I pray that this year I can grow closer to God and that I can be used as a tool in whichever way for His glory. Although I still believe that there is nothing we can do that will get us to heaven the only way is through Jesus Christ...we just hope we can live in the light and that we become better servants.

      [ Sat Jan 03, 08:11:03 PM | Wendy Larios | edit ] Hey to whomever might read this... Just wanted to say hello. I am going to try to keep this thing more updated than what I have now that I have more time. The truth is that I don't get online that often and I usually like to take my time when I write a post on my blog.  Tonight I am not really up to much. Just been thinking a lot and how I have been living in the past few weeks. Man it is so hard to live alone. I mean to understand this let me explain. My family are not Christians and many of so what I called once "friends" aren't either. It is great to live a life for God but sometimes its hard to manage when I have no one that understand me. Sometimes I hate being home not because I dislike my family but because I feel lost, disappointed, confused and overall sad. I have been praying for my family but they just don't get it. I am not the Wendy I was before and never will. Sometimes I just feel like leaving here, going to a far away place and start all over. I can't do that but I feel helpless. The only thing that gives me will power in my walk is that I understand that God will never forsake me and that I can depend on him.  To start off I just want to thank the Lord for providing a blessed year, for providing and specially for giving me many opportunities to learn. Although many times I have failed I have recently been learning how to be more humble and self submissive. Keep me in prayer. I just pray that for the coming year I will continue in my spiritual growth and I pray for wisdom and God to put me to use in whichever way he can best use me, although I am convinced that I can not do anything to win my way to heaven I am thankful for the grace of God because through Jesus I can think of that path. ...Hoping to make it....Well today was a good day. I woke up and read about urban ministry and it was enlightening. I have been exposed to this through my boyfriend because that has been his calling. Learning to understand how God places us in a place where we can be the light for his glory I am trying....trying....And trying...To be more compassionate and understanding. I pray for more wisdom and strength in my struggles and weaknesses.  I watched a Christian movie today. It was pretty good the title was "Time Changer" for more movie listings check www.christianmovies.com. It was cool because my parents seen it with me. Not that they might of understood but I know that God transcends all languages and barriers. Let me get to the point I am in here writing on my blog because I got tired of watching all the sick television shows that are on. I know its simple to just sit there and watch them simply for "entertainment" but for some reason I felt wrong I was not entertained by all the junk expressed on TV, especially the Spanish networks. But there is nothing I can do.  I'm looking forward to tomorrow because of church and care group. Well I know this post has been sporadic but I can write forever keep me in prayer and let me know how God has been blessing you guys.  Bye Bye.

       Me singing???  Well I went to check out service the service at Florence Avenue Foursquare Church today. It was cool. The college group meets in the same room we meet for bible study. Vince was speaking about joy and peace. What was so interesting was that before Vince began to share they youth pastor gave an announcement. He told us today we are going to go early because we "as a group" are going to be the choir and sing for the whole congregation and bless them today. My eyes opened wide and I was like, "Are you serious?" As I thought in my head I was like this is so embarrassing. First, because I don't know how to sing and second, it's my first time here and I am going to be in front of everyone. I was ready to walk out the door. But suddenly everyone was just like its alright, and Vince was like remember we don't get our approval from no one else but God and we have nothing to worry about. Who cares if we are off beat or out of tune. We just have to praise God and delight him in that. So I just hung out with everyone as we walked to the choir room. We got ourselves in three lines and shortly after we walked in to the sanctuary. The place was so big and everyone was looking at us with smiles as they worshiped with us. I was able to block off my feelings and my embarrassment and just worshiped God. It felt good. We then finished and we went into the sanctuary. The message today was on forgiveness.  Eventhough the experience was nerve wrecking God gave me grace to be okay and I really feel God has been working in me to really trust him. He has literaly taking me out of every comfort zone I have created. First going into a new church. Second, meeting new people. And Finally, not being nervous to praise God in front of anyone. Wow! It's been a lot but I am greatful God is so loving and faithful.

        Hey friends!     Friday Night! I was debating whether not to go to the women's fellowship event. It is called face-to-face. It is just going to be women meeting to talk to the pastor's wife. It is tuff to decide whether to go or not because I was fearful to get out of my comfort zone. See I am shy and I didn't know if the girls I had met already were going to be there and since it was going to be at someone's house I was thinking, "what if I show up and nobody knows me, I am going to feel weird." Well in my mind I decided I won't go I figured I will just wait for Sunday and show up to the college event Fusion. I then finished cleaning my room and finished setting up my dvd and tv (yes finally I have a dvd player!) maybe an hour passed and I received a call. It was a private number on my cell. I was thinking who could it be I was not going to pick up the phone, but something told me just answer. Thank God because it was Danielle one of the girl's from the church asking me if I was going to show up to the event. I was talking to her about me feeling nervous and she was like just go it will be great and you will get to meet the girls and spend some time. I gave in and told her I would go.  Saturday!  In the morning I woke up and was getting ready to go to the breakfast.I was taking my time b/c still I was like, "I don't want to be early and not see anyone I know" Luckily as I was driving up to the house this car pulls up and some girl I had met was like I know where it is follow me. I was wheeeeesh! Yes! I don't have to walk in by myself. Well the time was great. I enjoyed their fellowship. I really look foward in getting to know these girls and spending time. I really don't have friends and I think this will be good especially now where things are so difficult for me. The pastor shared her testimony and offered us many words of encouragement. It was weird though because as she was talking. I got teary eyed. I really felt God talking to me about a specific thing. I tried to brush it off b/c at that time the pastor was talking about some stuff and I didn't want the girls to think I was weird b/c there was no reason for me to cry. But anyway, I held it in and I felt this peace in my heart. The feeling was unexplanable. It was great! To conclude the pastor asked us if we needed prayer. I got the guts to share a little bit what I was struggling with and they prayed for me.   As I was leaving  there was this girl Jovana who came up and was like hey it was nice meeting you. She was like I have been through what you are going through being hurt. We then talked and she offered encouragement and support. It was great to share. I had been holding in to so much lately I felt God was like this is a safe place to release, and I did. We talked for a while. I don't know why but I felt a certain closeness. I guess because while we were sharing we had so much in common. I was like man no one understands me but I felt she did at that specific time. To conclude she prayed for me. I was so thankful I went. I am continuing to pray about all of this and church. Please keep me in prayer. I know God works in tremendous ways.  I came home and I fed sailor moon. Later on my friend invited me to go watch the Laker game at this restaurant but I decided to go to  brother's house to watch the Laker Game and visit my nephews and nieces. It was so much fun. I really enjoy going over there and spending time with the kids.   I came home after the game  and when I came home I sat out in front of my house and played with sailor moon for a while. She was so excited to see me. She was liking me and jumping all over, she even scratched me she was so excited. Then I fed her gave her water and brought her inside for her to sleep.  Tomorrow  I am going to check out the service at this church and also going to Fusion at night. I hope it will be fun!!

      MAKING CONNECTIONS  Hey everyone! Today was a crazy day. I started with my new class. It is a 4/5 English immersion class. The day went well with the students. They already know me so they knew exactly what to expect. The testing process didn't even begin. That is good. But, as far as responsibilities their is a lot of work I have to do to finish off the year. I had been talking to various teachers and they were being considerate and offered me some encouragement. I didn't feel better until I met with the principal. Luckily, now I feel more confident in what I need to get done to meet some deadlines. Today was open house but I did not attend. I hope it went well. I instead went to bible study at 4 square church.  The Connections.... Today I was so happy because finally I got in contact with my dear friend from Washington Rhema. Man I really enjoy her friendship. She sent me some beautiful emails and we got a chance to share. We had both been busy and let some time pass by but we talked and we both agreed that we won't let that happen anymore. I really missed her a lot. Thanks Amiga. Dios Te Bendiga Y Guie tu camino siempre.  Well I got connected with a few people from the chuch. They are having a lot of fellowship events I might attend. Saturday they are having a women meeting at 10:30am Sunday they are having "Fusion"  college night at church 7pm Monday they are having Life Groups (prayer, accountability groups) 7pm.  I also was able to talk to the youth pastor. This church is cool they are a lot of nice people.  Scripture verse to think about: "Pray without ceasing. . ." (1 Thessalosians 5:17)

        THE WEEKEND     Friday:  I went to work in a fist grade classroom. It was a good day. Kids are so sweet at the end of the day some girl hands me a heart she had cut out out of her bookmark and says, "this is for you teacher you are nice" eventhough it was a small gesture it was very sweet and I felt appreciated.    Saturday:  I went to a baby shower 10am-12pm It was great time of women fellowship. I then went to my house because we were having a carne asada for my dad since his birthday was Sunday. I can't believe he is 60 years old. I pray that God continue blessing him and keeps him healthy and gives him many more years. Next, I went over to Sergio's house to go say bye to his sister. I had a lot of fun with her and it was really nice to get to know her and her son. I hope they enjoyed my company too.    Sunday:  Went to church and went with some friends to lunch. Later I went over to Celena's house as we waited for care group. Didn't want to drive home and be back in a couple of hours so I hung out there. I went to Target and guess what I got a price adjustment. I had bought a DVD player last Wednesday and when I went to Target Sunday it was 10 bucks less. That is cool.   I feel God has been doing amazing things these last couple days. I just want to continue drawing near to God and learning about his grace and love for us. Keep me in prayer. I am also praying for those of you I love.

      HI It's been awhile. Just been  taking a break  with work and enjoying my time with Sergio's sister and her son. It's been great. I am glad yesterday was my last day of this semester. I won't go back to school until August and I only have 7 more weeks and I will receive my credential. I am going to start my Masters program that Spring. God willing everything works out.  I am writing because  yesterday  as I was driving home, I drove by that church that I was going to check out. They were having a college youth bible study and worship night. I met some cool people and everyone was welcoming. This church is culturally diverse something different from the church I am currently attending. I am still praying about this and trying to figure out more about this church. Well see what God has at this church. I am planning to go again next Wednesday at 7:30pm.  Now  I am going to pick up Sergio's sister because she is comming over for dinner. I made some enchiladas, rice and beans and bought a cheesecake. I hope they enjoy the food. We are also going to go watch the movie Shrek 2. My friend told me that it is pretty good. God Bless all of you and once again thanks for your prayers.

       Good Morning!  Well I just got done reading my devotional for the day. It talked about the habit of keeping a clear conscience. "...strive to have a conscience without offense toward God and men" (Acts 24:16). It explained that when we have God's truth in our minds and relevant we will be able to make the right choices and hear God. I was thinking of times when I did things not knowing why but just felt moved by the Spirit to act a certain way. Everytime I chose to listen to the spirit blessings were being poured out. But, on the flip side there are those times that our flesh is stronger than brick and we fail to listen to God and sometimes choose not to. I am just grateful and amazed by God's undying Love for me and for his mercy and grace in my life.  Today  I am meeting with the pastor from church. I am going to start being counseled by some women from church. Pray that it goes well. I am nervous about the whole thing. Shannon some girl from church is going to be there.  This weekend  is going to be interesting for me. My brother asked me to help him babysit his triplets with him because his wife is leaving to Chicago for the weekend to attend her brother's wedding. I know the time is going to be blessed. I will be at my brother's house Friday and Saturday.  " I am a child of God "(Romans 8:16) Wow I can't even grasped that!

      Hola! Well I am finally home. It feels good. I had a long day today. I went to the middle school. It was pretty easy because I was covering different classrooms every 1/2 hour while the teacher got their evaluations from the principal. It was interesting because I have subbed in that school many times and I always get the bad behavior classrooms and I am always strict with them and having to deal with discipline, but today all the classes I went into were great. They were actually quiet.  It was pretty weird because students always think I am white. They try to be polite and ask me where does my name come from when I introduce myself as Ms. Larios, they know the name is in spanish but they don't ask me "are you Mexican?" but they always ask me where does your name come from. Then I always take the opportunity to share my culture and with pride I say it is Mexican my parents are Mexican. They always seem relaxed hearing my answer. I guess they don't hear Latinas being proud of their culture.  Man if I would write about the students and the observations I have I can go on for hours....but I am not.All I can say is that students are growing up too fast and are dealing with different things that I would've never imagined. I'll keep them in prayer. I was in different classrooms  Math, English and Social Studies it was weird because throughout the day I was answering random questions based on their assignments and when I would explain to them they would look at me like "I can't believe you know" They thought I was some kind of genious or something. I helped some students work on solving equations and I had to explain what a constonant blend was and other things. It was fun.  When I was done with that I was working with another substitute we were both counting and checking tests and also counting some bulletins. I got lucky I ended up leaving 20 minutes early from work. I went to school today. That was a drag...literally. A lot of people had such big attitudes. We were also filling out supervisor evaluations and some students presented. Guess what I didn't have to present...YES!! She ended up collecting our work because we ran out of time.Next Wednesday all we have is a presentation and an assignment to turn in and we are done for this semester. Guess what I have another test to take. After class I went to buy the study books. They ended up being $30 bucks. Not too bad. The test cost $134  It tests all aspects of reading and writing and also reading and respoding to case studies. I hope that I can pass this test. This is my last test. (Well for now....things always change in the EDUCATION world....thanks politicians------>scarcasm..)My friend Lissette and I are going to study tgether. I really have to prepare because if I do not pass that means I have to pay again and ...its not that cheap.  God willing everything will work out. We have 5 weeks to prepare. The test is June 19th.  Guess what happened today when we got to my friends house I was looking for my keys so that I can get in my car and go home...but I ended up leaving my keys in my car...That sucked. I had to wait for AAA to come and opened it. I guess I was in a hurry to get out of my car and I left my car keys inside because they were in the ignition.  I hope all are doing well. Thanks for all those beautiful emails you guys send to me. It is cool to know you guys are reading and responding to what I am writing. God Bless you All.

      I just got back home. Today was another good day. Remember I told you guys that I was going to teach middle school today. Well I guess they cancelled because all I did today was work in the office. I was counting all the testing materials they used. It was an interesting day because I was able to observe the counselor of the school. I was working in that office. It was interesting because in the future God willing after I teach for a lot of years I want to be a counselor at a school, so I was able to see how it goes. The office was busy there was a lot of students sick or in trouble. Also, there was a lot of parents taking out their children early. I remember my parents would never take me out of school. All my appointments were scheduled on the weekend or after school. Also when we were sick they would make us go to school. They would always tell us if you are really sick they will send you home. They always showed me the importance of school and and how to be responsible. Now I can be appreciative towards that. Back then I thought it wasn't fair. Working in the office also brought back memories when I used to work at the office at school. I prety much ran that place. I really enjoyed it and I learned a lot. Anyhow, I Thank God that I am teaching now because I love it and the experience has been great!! I also went to the dentist today!!! It went well. I was scared. I always get scared when they put shots in me---or when I have to go to the doctor b/c of serious circumstances. They ended up taking two fillings that I had and replaced them and they put a new filling in. I also got a deep cleaning. The doctor was gentle and he worked pretty fast. When we got out I went shopping with my mom. I felt really weird because since I was numb my cheeks and mouth felt like they were 3 times bigger.  Right now I am listening to the Fish. I enjoy listening to worship music. I really like the song Spoken For by Mercy Me. That band is pretty good. I like their lyrics. Tomorrow I am going back to the middle school. It will be a busy day again because teachers are getting evaluations and I will be covering their class while they meet with the principal. After I have to head over to my friend Lissette's house and then we have to go to school. We have a presentation tomorrow. Hopefully class will go by fast. After tomorrow's class I only have one more class. YEY!!! This semester flew by.

      Hello Everyone! To all the mamasitas Happy Mother's Day. Well today is Mother's day in Mexico. Today was another great day for me. My mom came home from school (English classes) and we decided to make a carne asada. It was a nice time. All my family was here my cousins from the back, my older bro Javi and his kids and also two of my friends came over. We ate carne asada, w/ rice and beans, guacamole, grilled chicken, tortillas, sandia, and also cheesecake and angel food cake with strawberries...yum..yum. We were also playing the UNO challenge game.  Tomorrow is going to be a busy day for me. (When isn't it??? lol) Tomorrow I am working at the middle school...Keep me in prayer. Middle school can be tuff sometimes. I also have a dentist appointment and at night I am meeting up with one of my friends. We are going out to dinner. Don't know yet but I hope it is a blessed time.

      Hey  Well I just got home. I spent the day with my mom and my family.We ended up going to Redondo Beach to a fish market. It was sooo Good. You buy your seafood and they cook it for you right there on the spot. Man I haven't had seafood in a while and I really like it. After we finished eating we walked around the dock and the pier. I had a good time. I didn't end up going to care group afterall. I wanted to spend the day with my mom because  I don't do it often. I thank God for a nice time. My mom really enjoyed it.

       Update:   I asked my mom if she wanted to go to that new church that I heard about, but it didn't work out because she had already made plans with my brother. He is going to take her out to brunch.Maybe some other time, or maybe it wasn't ment for me to visit that church. I didn't have a chance to go to church today because it got too late. I was waiting for my mom and I was talking to her. I gave her, her present. She liked it. I am glad because my mom is not affectionate or warming. She is loving and I am blessed by her.  Yesterday was girls night out!!!! Man this time was blessed. We had a great time. Time flew by. I couldn't believe I ended up leaving until 1:00 in the morning. We were giving eachother pedicures, manicures, massages and we were just talking and listening to some of my worship cds. I bought the new WOW 2004 its pretty good. We also had a chance to meet this girl Amanda one of Shanna's friends. She is not a believer but she had a great time and I hope she spends more time with us and draws near to the Lord. Keep her in your prayers. We were also playing the game TABOO we had such a good time. I really enjoyed myself.   Today I  don't have much to do. I will probably go to care group later on at night. Tomorrow I have a lot of errands to run though....This week is going to be busy for me.=)

      Well I am writing because I found out about some Christian church near by my house. It is a latino based church. I am thinking of checking it out tomorrow with my mom. They are having a mother's day service in spanish. I think it would be good for her if she is up to it because if I take her to my church it is all in English and she really doesn't understand. I am still praying about this though because I do not know much about this church. Keep this in mind. If it doesn't work out I will just go to my church as usual. I will let you know what happens......

       Well I'm back. Sorry I didn't finish writing it's because we went to go get some sodas with my cousins because her husband made a carne asada. He works at a meat market so he brought over some good meat and chorizo...yum I was craving tacos for a long time. I remember when we use to get together on Saturday mornings all my dad's family to make carnitas. It was usually to celebrate someones birthday or someone from Mexico coming over. I mostly enjoyed it because we were all spending time together. My dad works a lot so I treasure all those moments he's around.   Well to finish my story the reason why I had a good day at work was because I had an opportunity to teach the students that I will do my next long term for. This class is an English immersion class but there is 4 students that don't speak English. (so in a sense it is still a bilingual class b/c i will explain to them in spanish for them to understand). I really enjoyed this class because they are motivated to learn and they are more independent than the other class I taught. It was so cool because the students were writing in their journal and when they were done I asked three students randomly to read what they wrote and one girl wrote about me. She wrote, today Ms. Larios taught us she is nice I like her. That brought a smile to my face. I was like I have only been here for a while and she wrote about me! It impressed me. The day went well I had no behavior problems. yey Today is a busy day for me. I am going over to my bro's house because they are celebrating his wifes b-day, my other brothers triplets b-day and mother's day all in once. After I am meeting up with some girls from church because we are having a girls night. We are having a spa night. We are going to do our nails, talk and pray together. I am really looking foward to this. I'll let you know how it goes.

      Hey, I just got back from workWell today was my first day back to work since last Thursday when I was done teaching 3/4 bilingual class. I haven't been doing well so I wasn't up to going into the classroom. I wasn't ready for that. Today was a great day! I am so happy I went because the staff was very welcoming and warming. When I walked into the lounge in the morning to get keys and attendance there was all kinds of food. I was thinking in my mind "what is the occasion" and then I left I went to my room and looked over the lesson plans and then I went back to the lounge. When I walked back I needed to look for some girl to get some info regarding testing and then when I was looking for her the secretary was like go get some food you are like part of the staff, in that same moment the principal walked over and escorted me into the lounge and served me some mango juice and was so nice and friendly. Then I realized it was staff appreciation day and they were having a breakfast. I have really gotten to know the staff at that school and everyone was so helpful. It was a good day. It was good times. i have to go now ill finish my story later someone just came by and were going to the store. bye bye don't worry won't let you hanging ill get on here later bye '

       Its me!  I have been very blessed by a dear friend of mine that has been encouraging me a lot lately. Thank you Lord for bringing people so loving and kind. We read psalm 103 together about "The Love of God" It is a great psalm. We are both meditating on this psalm and keeping ourselves accountable to this. I am meditating on the first two verses: Prasie the Lord, my soul! All my being, praise his holy name! Praise the Lord, my sould and do not forget how kind he is" I hope you guys also get encouraged by these verses as I have. Well today I go to my book meeting. I really enjoy that time with the ladies. They share a lot of experience and wisdom and we have a chance to enjoy eachothers company.

       Hi Its been a long time since I have wrote on this thing. I don't know if anyone reads this but if you do email me so I know and I am held acountable for writing on here! wlariso2@hotmail.com. Well to catch you up I Thank God I (and my friend) passed the CSET exam. I still can't believe it. I thought I had failed that test. Anyway, I am glad that obstacle has been conquered. I have also applied for teaching positions. I am waiting for a response on that. Today I have an interview to work at a center. I think I will be a reading and writing instructor but the lady in charge asked if I can teach math too. Well it is kind of weird right now. I feel that this interview is going to be a two-way interview me interviewing her and her interviewing me because I still have to find a lot of details. I still feel that if this job works out it will be good because I will be able to reach a lot of students that need that one on one help. I enjoy teaching so much. I am glad and thankful that God has called me to do this.  Spiritually and emotionally I am struggling. Please keep me in prayer. I hope everything is well with all of you. All of you make my life more special I am blessed to have you in my life.  For encouragement this week:  "Living a life of faith means never knowing where you are being led. But it does mean loving and knowing the One who is leading. It is literally a life of faith, not of understanding and reason - a life of knowing Him who calls us to go."

       MONDAY  Today was a great day! I met up with my friend at the gym at 6am and worked out until 7am got ready and was at work by 8:15am. The day went well, although I was sore from yesterday's workout. I was upset though because during lunch break I went to get a refund for a parking permit I had purchased $44.00 because I didn't need it anymore since our bosses provided us with some. I went to go get a refund and the people were not being gracious they were trying to give me back $22.00 when the pass was never used. According to them it was policy that they don't give a full refund but I thought the way they handled the situation was very unjust. I ofcourse tried to manage the situation and my temper. To end it short I didn't get my refund and I ended up leaving before I said some mean things. I talked to my boss and she said she was going to try to figure things out. I pray this gets resolved. After work my friend and I headed over to the gym for aerobics class. Tuesday the class is a hip hop class. I thought it was going to be aerobics exercises to hip hop music but it was totally different. The instructor taught us a whole dance routine. It was pretty embarrasing but we learned and he was being really patient with us. Overall it was fun and we got a good workout. Tomorrow's class is Kung Fu and Thursdays is kickboxing well see how it goes.  As soon as we got out of the gym we headed home. I drove to my house to take a quick shower and pick up a dvd I borrowed from my friend to return and headed over to Pasadena to meet up with my prayer/book group. It ended up just being 3 of us Celena, Lisa and I. It was a blessed time. We chatted and prayed for one another. This time is awesome and I thank God for it. After the meeting I raced home to see my parents. They came back today like around 9pm. They were excited to see me and I was too. They gave me some gifts they brought back and talked a little about their trip. Thank YOU God for bringing them back safe and for providing them with the vacation.   Psalm 42:5 "Why am I so sad?            Why am I so troubled?             I will put my hope in God, and once again I will            praise him, my savior and my God"

       WEEKEND WRAP UP  To start off BROOMBALL was so much fun.  I have never experienced it but I am glad I went. The turnout was great there was about over 50 people there. We had a couple games against eachother and let me tell you it got pretty competitive. The teams were co-ed. After we had one game where it was boys against girls it was cool but us girls were outnumbered. There were much more boys than girls. We played well though and scored a couple of points. Later on we had dinner (pizza) and there was a championship game. David which was one of the guys playing ended up getting his eyelid slid open due to contact with the stick. We were all worried in the beginning but everyone was quick to respond and care for him. We ended the night with announcements of MVP and a prayer. I can't wait until the next game.   SUNDAY  I went to church as usual 10am. The message was great it was on commitment to church. The college pastor spoke about his plans in building leadership and ministry. It was great. After college meeting we went to main service(11am-1P) and the pastor talked about the different struggles we face and how to face them. Truthfully that is something I needed to hear because it is what I am currently facing with. Keep me in prayer. After service there was a leadership meeting(1p-2p)that I got invited to. The college pastor led the meeting and he was talking about what has been steering in his and his wife's heart and how they are working to promote and provide opportunities for people to grow as leaders and for those that are leaders to proceed into extending that leadership in ministry. I have truly been praying about this so it was awesome to be a part of the meeting. I am hopeful and joyful to see how God is going to use me but I also am learning that it is not a waiting game completely...When God puts something in ours hearts we have to act and be proactive and he will bless us and provide us with the grace necessary. Finally, I went home and took a nap because I was tired. Not over yet! Later on at 6pm I went to the vacation bible study closing ceremony. It was amazing to see how awesome the kids were worshiping and hearing their testimonies. I pray God continue blessing those kids that received christ and also that He may empower them to continue having the desire to seek after him and bless those around them. Finally some of the people in my life group went to another's life group's event (The Atwaters' house). They had ice cream sundaes for everyone. We just hung out in the back yard and talked it was great. I was so tired by now (10P) I ended up going home. It was  long day but it was a day full of blessings...Thank you father.  MONDAY  Well today was the first day of ART CAMP. I got assigned to lead the younger group (grades range from 1st to 4th grade). I have 27 students to lead. They were all self-motivated and anxious.  Here is a brief of how the day went. Our first class was Drama which is taught by some guy named Chad it was great because the kid's love him and he was able to get all the kids comfortable. Later on we had art class which is taught by Allison we listened to music and and drew our impression of it. That was a new experience for me. Then we had ceramics which is taught by Erin kids made different pinch pots. Some of them came out really nice. and in the end we had another art class which is taught by Krista they did water resistent/watercolor sea life drawings. I am excited to see how those are going to turn out.  The students leave art camp by 4p and then the staff had a meeting 4p-4:40p. My work day ended at 5:15p and my friend and I headed over to the school gym for our 5:30 aerobics class. We are going to be attending aerobics classes (they offer different ones each day) everyday for the entire 5 weeks. I am really looking foward to this. The workout was great. I am soo tired and sore. After Aerobics class I came home took a quick shower read a chapter for my life group book study and went to subway picked up dinner and headed over to my meeting. I am now here home taking a break. I have to pack for tomorrow and go to bed. I am really tired I am going to stop writing now. I just thank God for giving me such a productive day. Not one minute was wated and he blessed me in so many ways. I am so grateful. I will continue writing maybe tomorrow.

      "Girl's Night Update" Well last night I invited a couple girls to come hang out at my house. I really enjoyed the fellowship. It was a lot of fun. We ate a lot of junk food, pizza, and played games. We also had good conversations. I thank God for times like these because sometimes we get so caught up in our busy life that we don't make time to hang out.  Well tonight I am going to play broomball for the first time! Let's see if I will survive. hehehe =) The whole college group is suppose to show up at the hockey ring at 10p. I am anxious because I have never done this before. Everyone says its really fun.  For now I am heading out to my brother's house for the day.  Please keep my friend Karla in prayer yesterday she got laid off and she has a wedding comming up soon.

      Hey  I hope everyone is doing well. It seems like forever since I last wrote on my blog. Well this week has been a little hectick for me. I have been home alone for the whole week and at times it is hard. I've been praying a lot though. My parents went on vacation which is a  big blessing because my dad never takes time off from work. I hope God protects them and gives them time to rest.  Yesterday was a productive day. I went to help some friends move, then I went to visit my bro had dinner with them and drove to bible study. I was debating whether not to go I didn't get to my brother's house until like 4:30p and I would have had to leave by 7:00p to make it to bible study at 7:30 and I felt like it was too little of a time to spend with them and I didn't want to be rude. Anyhow I was there and we had dinner at 7p when my bro got home from work. I was like I can't leave now I haven't seen my bro and I didn't want to be rude and leave. So I stuck around. I was playing with the kids and helping them feed them. It was so cool to entertain them and see the joy in their eyes and see their smiles. Finally it was 8p and I was like I have to go home. I headed out at 8p and I was like it's too late to show up to bible study but I had an urge to go. (I think it was the devil keeping me from hearing God's word). I ended up showing up to bible study like at 8:30p. It was cool because they were talking about relationships. Later on everyone decided to go hang out at starbucks. I had so much fun. Although the coffee was not good ( I don't know why) fellowship was great.It was like a group of 20 that ended up going and we were just talking and laughing and sharing. I thank God for blessing me with this church and with these people.  I am really praying for direction from God regarding church and being commited. Thanks for all those of  you who have been praying and ecouraging me.

      I am just sitting here in my room taking a break from studying. I will be taking one of the last state assessments that I need to complete for my teaching credential. The test is on reading instruction. I have not had time to study so I am cramming. I started yesterday and today all day that is what I am going to do. It kind of sucks because instead of enjoying my day off I have to study. Anyway, tomorrow is the test. The test is 4 hours long. Keep me in prayer. I hope I can past it, because I don't want to pay another $134 to retake it.  Tomorrow I also have orientation for the art camp that I am going to work at. I am going to meet all the people that I will be working with for 5 weeks. I am really looking foward to working with the kids and learning new art projects, so that I can use them when I have my own classroom.  I am also thinking of my emotional side. I sometimes hate the fact that I am too sentimental.  A lot of the times I feel that I am too sentimental because I hold a lot of things inside me. I don't like to approach people with  my emotions because I don't want people to think I am taking things out of perspective or make them feel bad. I have to learn how to cope with my emotions better. Afterall everyone is human and not perfect.

       Work:  Well lately I have been extemely busy trying to finish off the school year. I am happy to say that today was my last day. Thank God. Actually, the day felt weird not having kids around. All teachers went to school today and cleaned out the classrooms and checked out with the principal. I learned a lot through my long term assignments and everyone at the school was really helpful and nice. I hope I can get hired soon! I won't be subbing until september when school is back in session, although I will be working at an art camp for 5 weeks in the summer. I am really looking foward to this! My friend told me that it is a lot of fun.  Prayer Request:  I pray that God give me strength to deal with my issues. Many of you already know what I am talking about. Thank you. I pray that God give me provision and wisdom to be able to discern and make better decisions. The waiting game is hard and I am trying to trust in God alone.   Books that I am reading:   The Bible            by  God Idols of the Heart  Learning to Long for God Alone  by Elyse Fitzpatrick How Can I change? Victory in the Struggle Against Sin  by C.J. Mahaney The Remarkable Women of the Bible and Their Message For Young Life Today by Elizabeth George  Scripture to meditate on:  According to Psalm 18:30, the Word of God is flawless . This means that whatever God says is perfect. No one will ever be able to refute His promises.   "True, the grass withers and the wildflowers fade, but our God's Word stands firm and forever ." (Isaiah 40:8/Message Bible) What God said when He created the heavens and the earth applied yesterday, pertains to today and will be relevant tomorrow.   If you hear God's Word and believe it, you are blessed because  it is at work inside of you!  Prayer: Lord Jesus, before I start this day, I put on Your Armor. As I buckled the belt of truth around my waist, I ask You to reveal Your truth throughout the day when the line of fact and fiction becomes blurred. As I put on the breastplate of righteousness, I ask that You guard my heart with the integrity that only comes from You. As I place my feet in the shoes of Your Good News, help me to walk in a peace that passes all understanding. And when the enemy tries to negotiate with me, help me to foil his wheeling and dealing by keeping the shield of faith firmly in place. Because I realize that one blow to my confidence can prove fatal, I accept the gift of Your salvation and put it on like a helmet. And finally, I pick up the sword of the Spirit. I ask that You bring Your Word to remembrance so that I can skillfully and accurately pierce holes in the enemy's intimidations. Amen!

      My Divided Heart:  Psalm 86:11-13 " Teach me your way, O Lord, and I will walk in your truth; give me an undivided heart, that I may fear your name." "I will praise you, O Lord my God with all my heart; I will glorify your name forever. For great is your love toward me; you have delivered me from the depths of the grave."  Psalm: 119:37-38 " Turn my eyes away from worthless things; preserve my life according to your word. Fulfill your promise to your servant, so that you jmay be feared."  It's amazing how God reveals our hearts but at the same time it is peaceful to know he is with us and will provide us with the grace. He is the heart knower and changer. Thanks for those of you who have been praying for me and for all the encouragement. Gio you have truly been a friend. Thanks your amiga.

        Finally Friday! I am so glad it is Friday.   This week was a bit stressful. 8 more days and school is out. I am excited. It is going to be weird though being out of the classroom in the summer. I will still work with kids though (which I love) at the art camp.  This weekend looks like it's going to be nice . I really feel like going to the beach. Hopefully I will make some time to do that.  Tomorrow  I am going to some women's conference in Carson. Its the series of conferences I have been attending for a while now. They have them every 3 months and each time it is a big blessing. I really enjoy them. There is good teaching, fellowship and worship.  On Sunday , the usual...church and care group.  I will keep you updated to let you know how the conference was and how the weekend ends up.

       Hola!  Well  today  was the start of a hectick week after the long weekend. This past weekend was great. I was able to spend a lot of time with people who love God and with my family. Also, I have been very fortunate because the class I am teaching is really good. It is good for me because I have more time to focus on all the stuff I have to do instead of disciplining all the time.  God  has really been working in my heart lately. I don't seek to understand but I pray for a heart of obedience and for me to be stronger in my faith. At home it has been tuff. My mom is babysitting 6 of my nieces and nephews and the house and the stress has been chaotic. I am trying to be patient and loving.   Today I started working out . I really have let that go for a while and I am determined to do it for myself and get back in shape. I have really been feeling down regarding this, but I also realize it is my fault. I hope everything goes well. Today I didn't find anyone to go with me to the park so I decided to work out at home. I have this 3mile video that is 47 minutes long. It was a great workout! I plan to continue with this and doing my step aerobics. I am still praying about joining a gym or finding someone to workout with. It's much more encouraging to have someone support you along the way.   I also had some time  to learn more about God (read the word) and pray. That is always a blessing.   I have a problem though . I am suppose to report tomorrow to jury duty but I can't I have work. I tried callling like an hour ago but it was closed. I was hoping they had an automated system but they don't. Since, I have already postponed it once I have to speak to an actual person during business hours. I pray everything goes well tomorrow when I call. Has anyone been in this situation? What is going to happen if I can't go?

        Today was an interesting day.    At art camp the kids had another wet n wild day. We got a whole bunch (the teacher's and assistants) water ballons and super soakers and we got all the kids wet. It was a lot of fun!! Tomorrow is the last day of art camp. I can't believe it! I was having so much fun! The students are great and the people working camp too.&nbsp; We have a lot of volunteers that come each day and help. The volunteers have to do 20 hours to get their course credit for one of their art classes. I am going to miss the kids and doing art. After work we have to tear down all the classes. We might go all out to have dinner afterwards because one of the girls works at this good bbq place but I am not sure I am going yet. It depends on my friend because she is driving. Now I have like a month before work and school starts! YIKES!!! I will be going to school 3 nights a week for seven weeks and I am done with my credential! Time has flown by. I have so much to do to get ready for my class but I am excited. I am just an overplanner sometimes.....    Decision....Crisis.....    Since I am finishing this fall I will start my Master's program in Spring. The dilemma is I don't know where I am going yet. I can continue and stay at CSUF or I am thinking of going to Whittier College or Biola University. Both of those schools are prestigous and are private universtities and are closer to home, but the problem is that they are&nbsp;more expensive. My heart is gearing towards Biola because it is a Christian University. I think it will be great to be all around fellowship while at school. It's hard&nbsp;meeting people at school that are so into the world and have not much in common with what I believe. So I think I will have a better experience at Biola. I have been praying about this. I am just waiting to see where God wants me to be.

         College Group...       Today the pastor continued speaking about relationships   . The talk was good, worship was good and the scriptures were great ones we can meditate on.  It was cool to see everyone, I had missed everyone from the weekend. Some berly found out about my accident and were asking how I was. Truthfully I am 100X better. I was like yup I know I've been out of the picture but I couldn't be out in the sun so that my wounds would heal...and Thank God they are and very fast...you can berly tell I was in a wreck. I was blessed to receive jon's call today. He just called because he had heard about my accident and wanted to know how I was doing and if there was any way they can help. I thought that was humbling of him because I know he is busy. I was able to talk to him at CG and thank God I was able to give him a good report about my recovery status.     I am so excited about the retreat.   &nbsp; The retreat is this Monday-Wednesday.We were figuring out the caravan situation and stuff. The girls are planning to meet up in the morning go to breakfast at Mimi's and drive out to Palm Springs!! We don't have to be there until 6p but we want to go and hang out. I was talking to vincent about the retreat...sorry we interrupted him several times...anyways he was saying that we have a session monday at 7p and one tues in the morning and we have from 11:30-8p off to do whatever we want !YEY! then we will have a night session on wednesday we have a session in the morning then we can come back at whatever time. Probably we will be back in LA before 6p because we are still having CG bible study that night.     Vincent was also talking to us about the college group and the growth of the church   . It was great to hear all the visions they have for the continued building of the church and the ministries. On Sunday they are having a meeting for those people that are more interested in being more committed to the church. I am looking foward to this meeting. I just have to figure out what I am going to do because I told my bro I was going to go help out Sunday. He is understanding I am sure he won't mind if I show up a little later.     As usual after CG we hang out.    We ended up going to starbucks because it is in a central area and there is a lot of fast food places around so people that are hungry eat and the others buy coffee and hang out. The patio area is big so we always just hang out outside. I didn't stay there that long but I had a lot of fun talking to Andy and tina marie and everyone there.     As I was driving home from CG I was listening to Salvador's CD it is good they have one of my favorite worship songs.    I remember singing this song since I was kid...seriously! The song is in spanish it is called "Un Dia&nbsp;a La Vez." I take this song to heart. I pray for this everyday. Lord please help me take it day by day for we are not certain of a tomorrow ~Amen.&nbsp; Especially after my accident God really spared me from death or serious injury and I am so greatful I was able to walk away with only scrapes and bruises. Praise God!! I am recoomitting my life to God each day and learning how to pour out my heart and soul to him completely.   I want to end this blog today by thanking a dear friend of mine     Lisa Gray  . Thank You for listening to me and sharing your wisdom . I am glad I called you before I made a huge  mistake. Thank you for loving me and for guiding me.

        THE UPDATE....(I feel like it's a novela-soap opera)     At Work   Well work today was good! Everyone gave me a warm welcoming with hugs and kind words. They were all worried and were happy to see me. The kids on the other hand were concerned when they seen my band aids on my face. (Actually it's not as bad as it was...Thank God but I am healing very well....I do not think I am going to have any scars---keep fingers crossed!!!). I decided not to tell them I was in a wreck just because I know the nature of kids. Kids need to relate to something for them to understand otherwise questions get soared..not that it is bad but I figured I would tell them that I got scraped on the ground because I fell down as I was rollerblading. That went well. Although they still asked they were able to be compasionate and understanding. They were all pretty happy to see me back=) This is the last week of camp!    At District    After work my friend and I drove down to district to sign our contracts. Everything went well. I thank God for the blessings!!! Can you believe that our medical, dental and vision plans are all FREE...yup I can't believe it. I thought it was great!!!!=) I am fortunate because they are many people that can't even get aid for things they need. When I get married (God willing) my family will be under my benefits for really cheap but for vision they all remain free. Although I have a stack of paperwork to fill out it feels good to have the contract finalized. We also had a chance to meet the superintendant. I am really looking foward to getting my class ready. I currently bought a whole bunch of books (kids, chapter books) for my classroom library. Since I am a new teacher I have to buy everything. I don't have much so I have to start from scratch. I am accepting any donations of books, magazines, comics....so If anyone knows of anything let me know.    At Bible Study   Well today my whole life group came to visit. It was really cool. We just sat and talked.&nbsp;The girls' brought me some cheesecake. We had warm coffee/chocolate, churros and cheesecake. The time was blessed. I really enjoyed their company. After we hung out for a while we went to my room and watched some tv.&nbsp;They also&nbsp;looked at my graduation pictures. &nbsp;   Retreat   Well summer college retreat is a week away!!! I can hardly wait!!! I hope I can fully recover so that I can join everyone in the pool and stuff. We are going to Palm Springs on Aug 2-4th. Supposibly it is a good time because everyone gets to know each other well and also because of what is taught in the retreat. I really hope everyone from my life group can go. Making time for God is always good amongst the crazyness of daily life!    Prayer requests   Patience...I need to continue refreshining my faith in God. I also pray that the whole car situation gets resolved. I also pray for my job at art camp, the kids and for my upcomming teaching job. I pray for those relationships that are being built and I pray that God keep me humble and loving towards the people he puts in my path. I pray for my family, friends and for little sam- specifically for healing.

        Mini Update!   So I got home and had dinner. I was really hungry and tired. I decided to go back to work because my healing has been going well and because I didn't want to be at home feeling sad and stressing over stuff. I also went to go sign my contract. I will tell you the details later. So I am eating dinner and watching family feud (which is a show I enjoy...and haven't seen for a looonnng time....) and then I look at the watch and I remember I have bible study with the girls today. I call my friend to have her pick me up because they live in south gate and they were like we were actually going to go visit you. I was like that's cool. So I rushed to go buy some churros and I am making some hot coffee and hot chocolate (the mex kind). I hope they enjoy it. I will try to write some more later.I have really felt loved lately. Thanks for all your prayers and for your encouragement. YOu are special to me and are in my prayers too.

Today    while I was at bible study I received a phone call from my boss. I guess it was meant for me to get the call because I always turn off my phone during bible study but this time eventhough I thought I did turn it off it was not turned off. I ran outside the room as I saw her name on my phone screen but by the time I got through all the people (I was packed today!) It was too late and I got a voice message. It was my future boss telling me that everything went well and that tomorrow I have to go to the district and sign my   CONTRACT!!    urlLink  I am so greatful for God's blessing. He truly is showing me how much he loves me, not only by this job but by what he has been revealing and speaking into my heart. God is the only one that will truly fulfill me. I have to rest in that!     I met with the intern coordinator at our school to figure out what the requirements are and what paper work needed to be filled out to get the intern credential. She was very helpful. She also told us that we will be getting a stippened (extra money for supplies and stuff) and we will get three subbing days free which they will pay for and we will be getting some new materials. That was exciting because it was unexpected and because being that I will be a new teacher I need all the help I can get financially because I have to buy a lot of things.      Tonight's college group was good  .  We talked about sex and how we should glorify God with our bodies. The pastor pointed out some great scriptures and consequences and gave practical ways to deal with this issue and society. Usually after college group we hang out. We got invited to go with Andy and Miguel to In N Out but I decided to skip it because I had to come home and get ready for tomorrow. I am suppose to meet my friend at the gym at 5:45am to take a bycling aerobics class. I missed being around the CG group because last week I missed everything since I was hanging out with my cousin and family.      This weekend is going to be fun!    On Friday a whole bunch of us are going to get together at PUSH (praying until something happens) night. Which is a time where people just come together and pray at 6:30pm from there we are heading out to the long beach center to watch  "Bourne Supremacy" at 10pm we decided to watch a late movie because many people work and we wanted as many people to go. Saturday we are having a college bonfire. I am excited because I love being at the beach and the one they had planned before got cancelled. On Sunday the whole church is having a beach party.      I'm just trying to take it day by day.    Each day I pray for God's grace, patience, and joy. Thanks to all those of you who have been encouraging me in different ways.     I   am trying to walk by faith not by sight   .   I am anxious to see God move and see how he will use the situations I am going through.     &nbsp;             urlLink

        Comfort comes with time...     Camp has been going great! We have a great set of kids. I am writing because their is a girl in my group&nbsp; named Lorretta she will be going to seventh grade next year. She is only here for a limited time. She is from Taiwan and speaks Chinese. It's been great because I have really been getting to know her and her culture more and more each day. In the beginning it was tuff because she was very shy and would not speak. I tried to make her feel comfortable and was patient with her. Since I knew she didn't understand a lot of English I didn't want her to feel neglected or uncomfortable so I would go around her table and explain the projects to her in a way that was not embarrasing for her or for others to notice. I used a lot of nonverbal cues and offered her support. During lunch time she would sit&nbsp; quietly alone and not talk to anyone. Now she hangs out with the other girls and joins them. Whenever I am working on a project or doing art she always comes around and observes me. I was really blessed today because during break time we talked the whole time....this is rare comming from her. We just shared about camp and about Taiwan and the differences/similarities. It was great to see the bond being built. I was humbled to know she trusted me and wanted to hang out.&nbsp; It's amazing how interested in our culture they are. Keep her in prayer that she may continue pursuing cultural awareness and that she will gain confidence for herself.       &nbsp;

        OOPS....    I forgot to mention in my last email that yesterday was a fun day at camp. Due to the heat we thought we would do something that was fun and that will keep the students cool. We organized a water ballon game during lunch time. The teachers's and assistants played with the students and others were going around squirting everyone with water guns. The day was really fun. Everyone got all wet and was fresh throughout the rest of the day.    Sunday   I will be going to the lake again with my family. This time we are going to a new lake up the 15 I don't know what it is called. I hope I don't get too sunburned! At night I am going to get together with a friend to make cookies. I am going to their house. We are making home made cookies not out of the store bought dough. I know we are going to have a lot of fun because my friend is really cool.

        HEY HEY READ ALL ABOUT IT!!!     &nbsp; Well I have great news I am officially a teacher now. Yesterday was my final interview with the district I had applied for. It is Los Nietos School District in Whittier, (only 15 minutes away from home...yey=) ). Later on that night the principal called and offered me the job. I will be teaching a fourth grade immersion class. Praise God for an answered prayer. Thanks for those of you that were praying for me specifically for this.    Prayer request:   Please pray for Sam which is the son of the directors of the Harambee in Pasadena. The doctors diagnosed him with cancer. I can limitly understand how it is because one of my aunts went through that.    Tomorrow   it is going to be chaotic here at my house. My aunt is baptizing my baby cousin and they are going to have a big party with tamborazo (mexican form of music). Luckily there is an event&nbsp; going on at church that I will be going to at night for a while. ( I am trying to avoid being here). The girls from the church are getting together with the pastor's wife and she will be speaking to us.&nbsp; Last event went really well and I am looking foward to it!! I pray everyone is doing well. I thank God for all those special people I am able to build a relationship with.

      Today was a great day! I went to Lake Perris with my family. The weather was good and we had a good time. There was a lot of car accidents on the way to the lake and comming home. I pray God blesses those people and provides comfort and healing. Now I am trying to stay focused in doing what I have to instead of focusing on my emotions. I have to finish my portfolio and finish preparing for tomorrow's interview. I am trying to focus on God's blessings instead of complaining about the things I don't like or agree with. Keep me in prayer--I have faith that God will answer all my and your prayers. Thanks!  Tomorrow after work I am going to work. The next session of art camp starts. Also one of my cousins from Texas is comming for the week so at night I have to head over to LAX.Well I have to get back to work now.

      Yesterday was the last day of the first session of art camp. The day went well and the students were anxious to show off their masterpieces and to act in their play. Chad did a great job with this play because the students really enjoyed it! I will miss the kids, but I am looking foward to the next group. The next session is three weeks long. On Monday I have my first interview for a teaching position. YEY!!!Thank You God!!! This whole weekend I am preparing for it. Keep me in prayer.  I really need God's strenght at the moment please keep me in your prayers.

        HAPPY 4TH OF JULY   Well yesterday my friends from church went to the Freedom Celebration Concert which was held at Cerritos College. The experience was great because I have never been to a Christian Concert before. It was cool because I went there expecting to have a lot of fun and hear the bands which were going to play and thats about it. Happily the night was very moving for me. Although the bands were great and we were having a good time It was awesome to see people by the hundreds receive Christ. I was able to witness God's power in a personal way. Tears rolled down my eyes as I observed the multitude of people walking towards the front to proclaim the prayer of salvation. After they prayed my friend and I prayed for those people. I was also impressed because the stadium filled up to its capacity and they even had to close the entrance. The night ended with an amazing firework show.

      Hi I am sitting at home. I am eating some breakfast. My brother made huevos con chorizo. It is weird because I am not a breakfast person but I like to eat huevos con chorizo. I was really tired this morning. I didn't get much sleep last night. My brother and his wife were arguing all night (with no exaggeration all night). My brother has been staying with us for the past week and its been really frustrating for me. I was being patient and didn't tell them anything last night. It is sad because on the weekends is the only time I have to get a good night's sleep and I was not able to. I have been really frustrated having my brother at the house because he is childish and he is very messy. He doesn't care. Yesterday I spent all morning washing and cleaning the house and I get home and the house is a mess. My room is a mess and it really bugged me because he is really disrespectful. I feel bad because then I tell him off because it gets me upset and I know I shouldn't be telling him off. In fact "I'm the Christian  here." Keep me in praer. My mom doesn't come home until Tuesday morning God willing.

        ECCLESIASTES   A TIME FOR EVERYTHING  3 (1-8)Everything that happens in this world  happens at the time God  chooses. He sets the time for birth and the time for death, the time for planting and the time for pulling up, the time for killing and the time for healing, the time for tearing down and the time for building. He sets the time for sorrow and the time for joy, the time for mourning and the time for dancing, the time for making love and the time for not making love, the time for kissing and the time for not kissing. He sets the time for finding and the time for losing,  the time for saving and the time for throwing away, the time for tearing and the time for mending, the time for silence and the time for talk. He sets the time for love and the time for hate,  the time for war and the time for peace. (11-15) He has set the right time for everything. He has given us a desire to know the future, but never gives us the satisfaction of fully understanding what he does.So I realized that all we can do is be happy and do the best we can while we are still alive. All of us shoudl eat and drink and enjoy what we have worked for. It is God's gift.  I know that everything God does will last forever. You can't add anything to it or take anything away from it. And one thing God does  is to make us stand in awe of him. Whatever happens or can happen has already happened before. God makes the same thing happen again and again.

      Hello Well today I had my kickboxing class. This class was intense but fun. When I was comming out of the locker room the trainer was joking by saying you look like you have been working out...because my friend and I were sweating. I really have been enjoying working out I have more energy and I am finally able to fit it into my schedule.  Camp is going good we are almost done with this first week. We have more one week to go and the next session starts. We will get a new set of kids. The next session is longer though, it is going to be 3 weeks. At our school today (CSUF) they had the KROQ WARP concert. They were a lot of people and they setted up a lot of booths.  My mom left today with my sister and the kids to El Paso to my cousins quincenera. I wanted to go see my family but it is too rushed so I decided not to go.  This saturday I am going with some friends to a concert. I can hardly wait!!

       Isaiah 53:4-6  But the fact is, it was our pains he carried-- our disfigurements, all the things wrong with us. We thought he brought it on himself, that God was punishing him for his own failures. But it was our sins that did that to him, that ripped and tore and crushed him--our sins! He took the punishment, and that made us whole. Through his bruises we get healed. We're all like sheep who've wandered off and gotten lost. We've all done our own thing, gone our own way. And GOD has piled all our sins, everything we've done wrong, on him. (message trans.)

         Fellowship Time      This week I have had a lot of time to spend with some amazing people!!!     Yesterday   as usual I meet up with Celena and Lisa which are in my book group. Each Tuesday it's a blessing to meet with these women and share and pray. Yesterday the place was packed. The owner/worker I don't know what he is, is really nice with us. He even lets us stay in there after they are closed.   Today   we had college bible study. The pastor spoke about decision making in our lives and different points in time where we are caught in crossroads. He encouraged us to walk by faith and trust God in our decision making. This bible study was good. I really enjoyed it because I am facing many decisions at this specific time. Keep me in prayer!! After bible study we hit the usual spot.....STARBUCKS I didn't get coffee tonight instead I went to IN-N-OUT and got some food and a milk shake it was sooo yummy!! A lot of us just sat around talked and joked around. It was fun because some people I had not seen in a while like the twins and Andy because they were being counselors at high school camp which was last week. Well it was like 10:30p and we all wanted to go catch a movie. We headed out to Norwalk AMC first but it was closed so we went to the Long Beach Center Edwards but to our misfortune it was also closed... So we came home. We decided next time we would go to the movies straight after bible study.    Earlier today   I spent the day with my friend and looked at curriculum and all the stuff we have to get ready before the school year begins. All I have to say is WOW I have so much work ahead of me. I pray that God guide me and provide me with patience and grace to tackle all that is ahead.     Upcoming Plans    We are thinking of going swing dancing...I am still thinking about  this. We are also getting together on Saturday and going to the movies.

         Quick Note:    Tonight we didn't have a usual life group meeting. Angela, Adela, Danielle, Tinamarie, Vince and I headed out to Calvary Chapel in Costa Mesa to their worship night. It was awesome! The place got packed. The worship and teaching was good. It was amazing to see some people receive christ. Keep them in prayer.The ride and fellowship was good too!!=) We were going to go watch the movie the notebook afterwards but Danielle got a call that one of her friends broke her collar bone so she went to go visit her. It was cool though because on the way back we were driving on the 605 N comming home and they started talking about the bingo club right off of south st. I shared that my dad works there and Vince was like so you know where San Pedro's Tacos is??? which is a taco restaurant across the street. And I was like YES! So we were driving and I was like you want to go??? And everyone was like YEAH!! so instead of going to the movies we had dinner there!! It was yummy and we were just chattting. I had a good time!!! Well I am tired I will hollar at ya'll later Good night  God Bless you all.

      These words I speak to you are not incidental additions to your life, homeowner improvements to your standard of living. They are foundational words, words to build a life on. If you work these words into you life, you are like a smart carpenter who built his house on solid rock. Rain poured down, the river flooded, a tornado hit--but nothing moved that house. It was fixed to the rock. But if you just use my words in Bible studies and don't work them into your life, you are like a stupid carpenter who built his house on the sandy beach. When a storm rolled in and the waves came up, it collapsed like a house of cards." ( Matthew 7:24-27 / Message Bible)  Jesus desires the same for us today. He wants our lives to be anchored in Him so that we can weather any storm.
