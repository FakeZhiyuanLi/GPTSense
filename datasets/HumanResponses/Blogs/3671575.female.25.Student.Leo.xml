      My thoughts as of late are selfishly consumed with turning twenty-five years old. I discuss this seldom, as most people feel I am being vain. When in fact my concern with the age, is not the age itself, yet what is represents to me. I remember, as do most, being an adolescent not being able to fathom ever turning twenty, let alone twenty-five. As I grew older, I knew this day would come, although I thought I would be more prepared. Perhaps as I have aged my ideal of myself has not. Could I still young at heart, even though some days I feel a million years old? I notice changes in myself as time passes, some physically but most mentally. I’ve taken some of my childhood qualities into adulthood, and some left behind. These become obvious to me when I am remembered for a quality that I no longer possess.  However, it is not this that worries me about turning twenty-five, rather I keep coming back to a conversation my father and I had one New Year’s Eve. I remember the look in his eyes, and the terror in my heart, for if what he was saying was true; in front of me lie a lifetime of confusion. He said that he felt every monumental age came with a life crisis of sorts. That perhaps he did not agree with only mid-life crisis, but that it happened about every 10 years or so. One reflects on their life and changes it appropriately and prepares for the upcoming years. Possibly even changing direction on a current path, or goal. Could this be possible? Am I destined to re-evaluate myself every 10 years or so? This thought making me reflect on my life choices. I chose to take longer with school, it took me awhile to choose a degree path, and even now I sometimes become hesitant. I think about my friends and their paths, some of them seem so mature compared to mine. They are embarking on marriage, parenting, or buying their first new house. Then I think about my mom when she was twenty-five, she was already a parent. A life I cannot imagine, not out of lack of respect, rather my own lack of responsibility. I admire those people, like my mom, who were basically grown-ups by my age. I’m barely getting close to adulthood, despite my age. Although some might call me lucky, sometimes I still feel stuck in between an age group. Not a kid, not quite an adult.  So, if this theory of my fathers is true, we’ve all felt this way. Although this doesn’t make me feel less alone, as it should, just makes me feel a bit sillier for making such a damn big deal out of it.

      Sometimes I wonder where the time has gone. I seem to get so caught up in all the things that are in my face, like work and school, that I sometimes forget some of the things that I am passionate about. Like politics. Most everyone has confronted me about how I feel about Kerry.  I have no solid answer. My only thought at this point is that when I voted for him when I lived in Boston, I felt good about him, but most importantly we CANNOT have Bush in office for yet another moment. Are these good enough reasons to vote for him? I’ve never been so unaware of a candidate, I’d normally have many reasons why to vote for someone, health care; taxes, social security; abortion, however, I’ve lost so much of my interest, and frankly, I am worried. I realize this election is probably more important than the last. Why am I so hesitant to get involved? Did the last election make me loss my faith in the system? Have I become numb to the political malfunction? Lies, low blows, cheating and stealing. What have our politicians come to?  I know this is not what this country was founded on. What happened to the honorable men? What happened to our pride in our country and our President? I am too young to remember when this country loved their President. Although I can see it in my parents eyes. They remember a time where they cried when their President was assassinated. They’d gather as a family and watch with pride and admiration as their President would address them. They weren’t ashamed to declare the President their President. They felt part of it all. Now, I sit here, unaware, partially because of my own fault, and partially because I am not made aware. My views potentially skewed by a slanderous media. My choices made by Supreme Court judges whom should be disbarred.  My vote unacknowledged. The peoples vote quieted by a man who was merely given the Office instead of earning it. I feel betrayed and sickened. Should this stop me from making an educated vote? NO! That would make me just as ignorant as these people hope we get. This betrayal should force us all to rise, rise up and conquer our foe. We must make sure that we do not allow Bush to win this battle (not that he did the first time anyways), we must fight, in all ways possible, we must make sure we win this time. We, the people…our voice needs desperately to be heard. Heard above the media clowns looking for their Pulitzer, above the scoundrels squashing our rights, above the man…we must win!!

      This is big…oh big news for me. I’ve finally let go of my Apple computer and succumbed to the world of Microsoft. Oh my…this is big. I figured that I’d have some time to do all the updates that my poor old Mac needed, and this morning as I was trying to load in the most current operating system, it just stopped working. Honestly I was just looking for an excuse to get a new computer, but I was hoping economically it would be feasible for me to purchase another Mac. Not the case. I am concerned at the prices of the Apples compared to the PCs. So, I did it, I bought a PC. OH MY! I am typing on it now. At least it is cute and kind of “Macish” so I don’t feel like I am cheating too badly. You know the reality of it all, is that it was just not practical. Like the Microsoft hating person I was, I had nothing Microsoft on my Mac at first, and then every time I would download something it would bog the poor little thing down. I’ve put my beloved Mac to rest this evening, and I am not an official PC user…OH MY!

      I am not sure what has possessed me to do something this silly. I would be fooling myself if I thought I had something profound to say...however, I will give it my best. As I always do. Struggling to find that piece of myself that can write with the fluidity of a good cosmopolitan sliding down your throat, especially after a day where your feet have long since declared mutiny.  Although I fear this is just my declaration to the people of the world, that I am a failure when it comes to punctuation. What can I say I am a fan of the fragment sentence, and am in desperate fear of the dreaded semi-colon.  Perhaps this my entirely selfish and lazy way of keeping my friends in touch with my thoughts and such, or just another way to make myself feel overly important. One might never know, either seems a bit pretentious.  On a rather real, and more boring note, I am out of school for the semester. It seems in between school full time and work full time, there is not a day where I don’t have some schedule to meet. I loathe my alarm clock, which now doesn’t have to go off everyday. My big decision now is what to do with all the courses which I have taken, like where to get my degree, and of course the dreaded moment of choice, what to major in. Of course, my primary interest Psychology and Nursing, however, I will have to make it specific and final. This has always been one of my biggest fears… In other news, my back injuries from a car accident I was in about a year ago have put me out of work for a bit. I started with epidural injections, then facet injections, and now on to a different therapy. I am confident, however, between my time off and the new treatment that I will be looking soon at some relief. I have learned a whole lot how much your body depends on your back being in good shape, and have had the bad experience in learning that chronic pain does not make for a good tempered Jen. In fact, I found myself more bitter and angry than I’d even been. My negativity was consuming. I found myself changing from the ideal of the person whom I’ve struggled to become. A gracious, kind-hearted, sometimes clumsy and over zealous at times, but nonetheless, good-natured. I am in search of the girl that I once knew I would become; I am search of her love and laughter. I will find her again…perhaps this my path.

      No matter how bitter I might be able to get about a past relationship, or one of my girlfriend’s boy troubles, somehow I still manage to be unrealistically optimistic. Perhaps I’m a romantic, or maybe I’m trying to protect my fragile heart. I want to believe that people have a foundation of good, but just make bad decisions sometimes. Is that being naïve? Is this why my expectations of men seem to be so out of reach? Does the “Prince Charming” actually exist? Can a man fall to his knees; profess undying love without losing his masculinity, without classifying him as weak or too emotional? I wonder if we’ve bred a group of emotionless men. Teaching them eagerly not to cry or express their feelings openly, for what? Perhaps, to make the perfect alpha-male? And, what’s that anyway? Why are we encouraging men to become more aloof and women to become more independent? Perhaps in the end everyone finds what they’ve been looking for; but what if the person they are looking for doesn’t think they are the “one”? Is this possible? Is there a flip side to the soul mate theory? Could I possibly be everything a particular man wants, but he isn’t quite what I am looking for? What a miserable thought. And all I can keep thinking about is that my confusion will only tangle a deeper web as I get older…

      When did so many people become rude and so self consumed?  I went to a concert put on by one of the local radio stations this weekend. It was a two day show; I only went for one day. We all know how these shows work, you get there early stake your claim for space, roam around, get some sun, and relax. However, since we were there so early, we set up right up front. I hadn’t anticipated how much of a disaster that would be. As the acts got bigger more and more people invaded our space. This is something that I expected, however I could have never anticipated how rude people were. They just pushed their way through, not ever looking back at whom they might have shoved behind them. In fact, there was a guy who set his blanket up next to ours, and by close to the end of the show, he was no where to be found and people had taken over his blanket. As if these people had no respect for someone else’s space. At one time I did see him, crowded by people, who were almost pushing him out of the way, how dare he be there on his own blanket? Moments like those make me scream inside in defense of other people. What does it take for people to feel empathy? What does it take for people to have some respect and consideration for other people? What has happened to people? When did we get so selfish?  Arghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!

      I went and saw Fahrenheit 9/11 the other day. The film was powerful and very well done! I would recommend it to anyone, in fact. I admire Michael Moore’s honestly and audacity. If this doesn’t open people’s eyes, I don’t know what will!

      I am infuriated at the blatant way singletons are made to feel alone and desperate by the ramblings of the media. An article on MSN gives a guide for any single woman who attends a wedding alone, as if we are too weak to do so without directions. As if we are too pathetic to attend a public event by ourselves. Perhaps we are stretching the softness of women a bit too far; we can actually do things by on our own. They offer advice on clothing and behavior; however, I am most disgusted by their “how to” section on answering that dreaded question that apparently makes us wither to the ground, alone and pathetic: ”Are you seeing anyone?” I am horrified that we need to make up excuses, is it embarrassing to be single? Is it a contagious disease that other people flee from? Should I hide in my room and take to my computer to read up on all the “how to’s”, so I can make sure I hook myself a real catch. Then I could be the envy of all the other wretched singletons out there, hiding in their closets with "how to" books. Then I won’t sink down into the morass of singleness. Then I’ll be complete and able to attend a wedding with my head held high, because I won’t be alone. As if being alone is something bad. What if I enjoy my own company? What if I am comfortable in my own skin? Does that just make me intimidating and too controlling? It seems to me we are damned if we do and damned if we don’t.  Perhaps the media could pull their heads out of their asses and find something important to actually report. Wouldn’t that be a treat?

      I’ve been thinking lately about soul mates. What are they and how do you know if yours is standing in front of you? And are there different levels of soul mates; those who are meant to be your friend and those who are meant to be something more? Because I feel a very strong and distinct connection between me and my close friends, but how can you distinguish whether that friend is meant to be something more in your life? I’d be foolish to deny a connection or “force”, but at what cost? Is it worth the pain of a failed friendship? Is it likely a person whom could be your soul mate could be the same person who can make you hurt so badly, and also make you laugh ‘til it hurts? I wonder if it is possible to even understand the depths of any of this, or whether I just need to trust my instincts! Webster’s says soul mate is “one of two persons compatible with each other in disposition, point of view, or sensitivity.” Is that all it takes??? Fuck, I thought it was so much deeper than that…I guess I should lighten up!

      I think this is just an expansion on my last post. I’m having a hard time believing whether people can change. Could that person who I knew in high school, the hateful jerk, can he change into a well rounded caring individual? In my own life I know that I’ve behaved in ways that I am not proud of, and I’ve seen myself change, but have I really? I’m still the same person; I still have the same blood running through my body, the same weaknesses, still prone to the same tendencies. Is changing something that is bigger than feeling sorry for an action and molding your behavior around that feeling? If I’d even been caught stealing, perhaps I wouldn’t do it again, but am I only changing because I got caught? I had a friend like this, who cried when she got caught, but was she crying only for herself or was she truly sorry for her actions? Can someone hit rock bottom, as my mom says, and finally realize that they have to change? How far down is the bottom and do you even have the resources to change when you get there? In particular, I’m scared for a person who I care very much about. I tried fixing him; however it only made me miserable with him. I’m hopeful he can change. I pray he changes, not for me, but so he can finally be happy without conjuring some silly moment from the past. I guess I am a hopeless optimistic, it’s finally hit me! When did I become this way? Last I remember I was a die hard pessimist, then all of a sudden, BAM! Obviously I’ve changed, so there MUST be hope for the rest of the world! :)
