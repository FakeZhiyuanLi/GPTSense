      **Please keep Norma Stegall's friend (that's as close to a name as I have) in your prayers. She has a type 4- out of 4- tumor in her brain, and has an estimated 6 months to live.   I have figured out that my life is pretty boring... Kali is gone to a week of Falls Creek, Ben and Tara are gone to Colorado doing Trek, Kenzie's grounded and about to go to Blue Haven, and I'm so frustrated at Randa it's hard to talk to her. She's going out w/ an almost 21-year-old guy who is in the military and is currently in California (actually, I'm glad he's in California, but that's not the point). Yeah, that's what I said, too. She just recently broke up w/ her 19-year-old boyfriend. Kali and I figure since her mom and dad got a divorce she's just looking for a combination of a boyfriend and dad figure... and we've told her this, but she doesn't seem to believe us.   Oh man, I miss camp. I miss all my friends- and family for that matter, and not having to really worry about things here. They always say don't go home sad, just think of it as a challenge- well, they were right. It's definitely a challenge! At least I can kinda keep in touch w/ all of my friends that were there.   Well, I better go since I don't have really anything interesting to say.

        Today I actually didn't do much... woke up at 9:30 (which is pretty good for me), ate lunch, took a nap- imagine that, and went up to the office to help mom. We came home about 4:30, and now here I am- trying to think of something to write. So I guess I'll leave you to this:  Switchfoot- Erosion  Rain is a bad reminder of everything I don't wanna know Rain is a backseat driver that takes me where I don't wanna go And it looks like the sky is caving in again I'm dry and cracked, the sky goes black And tut, tut, it looks like rain  Erosion Oh, Spirit fall like rain on my thirsty soul Erosion Oh, sweet erosion, break me and make me whole  The thirstiest grounds can't take the rain My undecided vices washing on down the drain And it looks like the sky is caving in again My heart is cracked, the sky goes black And tut, tut, it looks like rain  Oh, Erosion, would You wash away my sins Oh, Erosion, I need a second shot again Oh, Erosion, would You break my heart again Oh, Erosion, I am a broken hearted man.

       Since I was griped at for not updated my blog... I guess I better get on the stick.       School has started and, as always, I'm back to the way busy schedule. I'm in softball, Algebra is amazingly harder than I expected, and I seem to have no time to do much of anything. I haven't been feeling well lately, but what's new. The only real thing I have anything close to look forward to is the "Mercy Me" concert and game. I'll get to see my cousin Lindsey, and Ben and Tara, AND my favorite- skip the afternoon classes:). Too bad I don't get to miss 3rd hour, though. I'm the only freshman - well basically- at least the only girl, and the other people I NEVER talk to. Oh well, I'm getting used to it.      Lauren is still in Florida as of today, which is strange b/c she usually calls every two days to ask mom something.       Well, I've decided I think I'm going to grow my hair out. I liked it short but i'm tired of it and my ponytails are so annoying (i have to wear them for softball). I miss my long hair and you can do so much more w/ it. Now all I have to do is wait for it to grow out... that shouldn't take too long. WHATEVER!      Well, I'm going to take a shower before church, so I better get to going. I'll try and keep my stuff updated (**hint hint*** Andrew)    Later days!
