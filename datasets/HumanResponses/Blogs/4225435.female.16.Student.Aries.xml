       My first day of school was basically the same as every other day of school. Considering i'm a junior now, there was nothing really all that different about any of it except the different classes! This semester I have Geometry first block with Mrs. South, US & VA History second block with Mr. Giles, Spanish 2 third block with Mrs. Lowe, and then of course Adv. CIS fourth block with Mr. Kelley. I like all of my teachers and my classes! I think this semester is going to be a little harder then any I have had before though. But about the actual first day. . .I woke up around 6:15 when my friend Tiff called and I got in the shower and got ready and everything and Tiff came up and we left for school about 7:50 and got here about 7:55 since I don't live to far away! But we came in and went up to the 3rd floor to out lockers and put our things up and got the things we needed for first block! Then we headed up to Mrs. Thompson's room to get our yearbooks! After that, we came back down to the first floor and the bell ring and we went to homeroom. In homeroom we listened to Mr. Collins over the intercom and then Mr. Sumpter gave us forms to get filled out and went over our Red Books* After homeroom I went to Geometry and we got our books and went over a few things from the last part of Algebra! Then the bell rang again and I went to 2nd block but we had a Junior meeting so we went up to the Auditorium for about an hour and 15 minutes. In the meeting we went over everything like the dress code, parking, laws that can be broken at school, and many other things! Well after the meeting I went to 3rd block and we didn't do all that much in 3rd block except review some things from the end of Spanish 1 and we had a worksheet for homework. After 3rd block I went to lunch which I was very happy, that I have B lunch and I have it with all of my friends! But we talked and ate and hung out for our 30 minute lunch break and then we headed back up to 4th block. Which I was also excited about because I have this class with Brynn and Catherine! And I also like CIS pretty well, so I figured I would like this class too. But mainly all we did in here yesterday was go over everything that we would be doing for the semester and getting to know each other a little bit. But after school, I went back up to my locker where I met up with Tiff again, and then we met up with Brynn and Jessica, and we all went out and got in Brynn's lil bug and we were going to go to McDonald's to get something to eat before pratice but we didn't have time so we just went and got some gas because Brynn was almost out, but we had fun in the process of getting there! But today has mainly been about the same, except for the junior meeting, and all the classes we have done a little bit more stuff, but besides that it has all been very similar! But after school today, I plan on going home for a little bit and then coming back to watch our own Kelly Indians! The football team scrimages Richlands at home today at 5 so I plan on coming back and watching the game before I head off to work at 7! I close tonight so I won't get off work until about 1:30! But besides all that good stuff, it is great being a big *JUNIOR*, but then again it is so weird at the same time! It feels like just yesterday we were Freshmen and it was our first day being big high school students and now we only have this year left before we are seniors. But I am very excited about the rest of the year! We get out class rings on the 30th of August, and we have many exciting things happening for the rest of a hopefuly awesome junior year. But that was my first day of school.      .lakyn jade.
