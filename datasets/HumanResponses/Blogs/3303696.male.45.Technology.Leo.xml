      What in the world was God thinking when he created the 15 year old son?  Talk about Barney on steroids!  My son is growing faster than a weed, and is already taller than me, yet, school work and chores might as well be located on Mars.  Take last week, for example.  He and his friend decide to re-decorate his room, by placing post-it notes all over everything... The walls, furniture, light fixtures... everywhere.  That episode was followed up with a carving of the letter A on the back of his hand with his pocket knife.  Then, yesterday, I pick him up from school, where he tells me that he and his girlfriend have broken up.  Here's an exert...  "What happened?" "We broke up." "Why" "I don't know." "How did it happen?" "I don't want to talk about it."  End of conversation.  Then, 30 minutes after we get home, he's on the phone with her.  When he hangs up, he throws his arms up in frustration.  I ask who was that, and he replies, "Katie."   "Are you guys still broke up?" "No... she is so complicated!" "And you...?" "Black and White, Dad."  ????

      I have often pondered what my dad might tell me if he were able to come back for a short visit, say, lunch and a short walk through the neighborhood park.  That's assuming, of course, that he is aware of all that has past since he did way back in July, 1968.  I was just 9, going on 10 when he died.    Not many memories left, and those that are well, they aren't all that pleasant.  Dad's unpleasant influencial input, that was lost at his passing, is probably more of an issue concerning what I have gained rather than what was lost.  However, the whole "would he or wouldn't he" subject is all rather curious, based on the fact that any opinion generated about his fatherly support is more subjective than objective, since there is so little history to go on.  But still, I can't help wondering if he would be proud of his son today, maybe a bit supportive, possibly even somewhat excited that we finally had a chance to catch up.  He could offer his apologies for his failures and abuses, he could tell me that he loved me for the first time... we might even get a chance to toss a few baseball, you know, the Field of Dreams scenario.  I truly want to believe that version.  It's a happy ending kind of meeting, kinda adds reason and understanding to the whole missing relationship.  Fills in the gaps generated from the "God works in mysterious ways" dateline.  The Realist part of me tends to be quite a bit more pessimistic.  No gratitude, no apologies, no ball tossing... just more verbal abuse.  That would be a tough pill to swallow...  There's an old Mike saying... With life comes life's mistakes, with death comes understanding.  I think I will work on the first version... I have never been one who swallowed pills easily.

      More mysteries, more confusion... life goes on.  You wake up, go take a shower... blog, blog, blog... another day, another night.  Nothing ever seems to change.  It is getting so that I can't differentiate between the dream world and my so-called real world.    Is there anybody out there?  Does anybody care?  On a moonlit night do you offer your throat to the wolf with the red roses?  Dream on...
