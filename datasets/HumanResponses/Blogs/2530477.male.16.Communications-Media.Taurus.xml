      This is one of the most recent movies that I have seen. I saw it on Sunday with my sister and again on Tuesday night with all of my family. In my opinion this one is way better than the first one! The action scenes are way better. Tobey McGuire is now a much more experienced actor and knows what he is doing. I liked the plot as well, Doc Ock was played extremely well by Alfred Molina. The ending was not what I was expecting, but it does leave a lot of room for a Spiderman 3. Hopefully, that movie is not going to be too far from now. Two thumbs way up for this movie!      &nbsp;   A++

      I saw King Arthur a few nights ago on opening night at Cinemark at Legacy. A few months ago I saw the preview for it on  urlLink Apple Trailers , and I was expecting this movie to be like any other King Arthur movie. Well, a few nights before I saw the movie, on The History Channel they were showing some stuff about the movie, so I decided to watch some of it.   We show up to the theater around 7 pm for a 7:40 showing. I was expecting the theater to be packed by this point. Well, we went in and there was almost no one there. Even when the movie started there were still a bunch of seats empty. The movie itself was good. It related all the parts of the old story, but only a thousand years earlier during the time of the Roman occupation of England (ie. Hadrian's Wall). Action was good, as well as most everything else. The bad part is the ending was not quite what I was expecting. This is why I give it one 1 thumb up. Or as Ebert and Roeper call it a tie of a Hot and a Not.  &nbsp;   B+

       A few days ago I went and saw I, Robot with my dad and sister.  It was fairly good. The plot was good. I have not personally read the book that it is based on. So I'm not quite sure how closely based it is. Will Smith did a spectacular job. The robots seemed somewhat life like. I did like the car, and I wish my car could do all that. I probably would have spent my time better by seeing another movie, and just waiting to see this one at the dollar theatre. Therefore I give it a b-.   &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   B-

      Yesterday I went and saw the movie Troy with me dad at the dollar theatre. It was cheap so we were like why not. We arrived a minute or two after it had started, but it was ok because we got really good seats. The movie was good. It was definitely what I had expected. Some of the fight scenes seemed really fake, and not that good. The opening fight scene with Achilles was seemed so fake, and they tried to make it seem "Matrix" styled. I thought that Paris (played by Orlando Bloom) seemed more like Legolas. Basically I think that Orlando Bloom in every other role that he plays, he is going to be Legolas. Brad Pitt played Achilles great. Helen (played by Diane Kruger) was casted well and fit in with the part. The city of Troy was done beautifully, but (to me) it seemed a little more like the Lord of the Rings time period, and less of the Trojan War era.     B

      I actually saw this movie like the beginning of June, but I just kinda forgot about it. This movie was really good. If you like action/destruction movies like the movie Independence Day, then you'll love this movie. The different weather scenes were in my opinion really awesome, and couldn't have been much better. The acting was good. At the end of the movie you walk away with a feeling that you can/should do something. Then, you turn on your car and you're like, "oh yea, I'm just polluting the air with my car." All in all this movie was good!     A-
