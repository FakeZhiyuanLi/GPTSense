       I had a blast today, not much to say about the morning, but i got the 12 o'clock train to Chloe's house, We watched Van Wilder (It was alright), then we went to chloes room, i read OK magazine while chloe woke herself up, then we listened to musac ! .. We watched Everwood (Was coolness) while eating a nicely prepared cheese on toast by Roger (Chloe's dad), then we played with BUBBLES !!!!! .. thats right, BUBBLES !!!! .. then we watched Fight Club, i have seen it 3 times before, but this time it seemed different, i dunno why ! and Chloe bought me, Skittles to share, a bottle of Oasis, Milky Bar to share and some Poppets. Then we walked up to the train station and watched this big fire, was lovely ! .. and then the train came. I really enjoyed today, it was good fun !

       I woke up at 12:00 in a puddle of my own drule .. not very nice, I got a shower straight away and then came on the computer, had a post up on GW (of course).      I then found out that i didn't have practise today. by this time it was too late to alter or make plans with Chloe :( i was bummed out.      I then went to my room and played Eternal Darkness, with the sound on FULL BLAST !!! it's such a cool game ! Then i played some other games, came downstairs to find none other then flashy looking Jimbo Medd at the door, looking Fine in Brown. It was nice to see him as i aint seen him in a while, he couldn't stay long .. we was just popping over to pick up our Demo C.D to be posted to Mercury Records.      Then i had tea, BBQ ! (That caught on fire) .. I then ended my night comming on the computer while watching Big Brother (Stu And Michelle, Rumpy Pumpy) .. and staying on the Big Brother chat room trying to get Ahmed to answer my question .. WHICH HE DID !!! here is a pic link : http://www.whahay.net/pubaccess/AHMED.PNG      Can't wait to see chloe tommorow, feels like i havent in ages.

       Today was really fun,I spent the morning relaxing listening to a compilation C.D i made with bands like : Stories &amp; Comets, Motion City Soundtrack and Snow Patrol on it.      I didn't do much else in the morning apart from doing my regular post up on Gaming World, I got the 5:20pm train to Chloe's house .. we layed in bed listening to music, it was so much fun just watching her. Knowing that we are ok again, we had fun tickling each other under the covers. After that we watched School Of Rock, (I am Mr. Cool i swear) .. which was fun .. had a pasta bake (yum-yum). Then we went to Bells and got : Skittles, Hippos and a Milky Bar. was a fun day, i loved the moment we had in the bed :) .. i real heart warmer !
