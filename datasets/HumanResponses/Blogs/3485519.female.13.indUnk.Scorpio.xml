      My mom invades my privacy soo much!!!  I have a xanga that supposed to be mine and I'm betting that she reads that.  I can't believe her.  That xanga was like my diary.  My mother was reading my diary.

      Haven't blogged on this one in a while.  Well I went to Boston on vaction, it was muy divertido.  Got my report card.  I was proud of it, my mom wasn't.  Too bad for her.  If everything is over 95 for me it's great!  If everything isn't 100, it's bad for my mom.  O well.  97 math regents, 93 science regents, 98 spanish proficency.  Not too shabby!  Boston is soo pretty.  It's a city, but cleaner and less crowded than NY.  I love it there.  Maybe one day I'll live there.  Mostly I loved it cuz I like the Red Sox and I'm a Yankee Hater.  Anyway if you want to read more on Boston check out my xanga.  Here I'm talking bout that bitch Katie.  She made her own xanga.  How pitiful.  O well.  I tried to apologize to her I really did.  I was sincere and was nice about it, but she still resents me.  I thought I did the right thing, confronting her and telling her personally, but now she still doesn't treat me as she used to.  She never calls me, never asks me to go anyway, never wants anything to do with me even though I made it clear I still wanted to be her friend.  Now I have second thoughts on that, because apparently, she doesn't want to be my friend.  Well there's the rest of the summer and camp, let's see what happens.

      Yesterday was the last day of school!!!  Wooo-hooooo!!  We had somewhat of a party.  We just went crazy!  We were supposed to study, but instead we made the weirdest movie ever.  We don't believe in scripts so we improvised on everything and I mean everything.  I was filming so it was hard to figure out who to point the camera and stuff.  No matter!  It was the best experience ever.  Filming a movie about taking and blowing up Pluto.  Hehehe, Marla/Beatrice, paranoid activist, and oh too peppy Clover.  I finally had a chance to finish that book I've been reading, Eragon.  It was sooo good.  Now all I have to do is wait for the next book in the trilogy to come out, Elder.  So excited!  I loved this book and encourage other young readers to also take part in the Inhertitance experience.  Dragons, elves, dwarves, Urgals, Shades, Raz'oc, and the struggle to grow and live up to being a Rider.  They're making a movie of it too!  Hope the boy that plays Eragon is hot cuz I claim him first!

      Well I talked to her and it was more of me telling her what I didn't like what she was doing and she resolved to fixing those things, but I wouldn't be so sure.

      I cannot believe my mom.  First she forgot to pick me up yesterday.  So I had to call her a second time and she arrived 30 min after I called.  Today she forgot me yet again.  She came to pick up my brother but forgot that she also came to get me too.  Next, I had asked her a few days before if I could get my hair cut.  We figured Thursday at 6 would be good.  Well she forgot to schedule that for me too.  So now she decided that she's going to cut my hair.  That's going to be bad.  Then I found that she bought Steven a McDonald's Happy Meal today and she figured that I would want an apple pie like my older brother.  Who wants an apple pie in this weather?!  A warm apple pie?!  They only go to McDonalds so that Steven can get the toys.  Well I was the one to get the toys first, because I wanted one.  I went and bought it with my own money meanwhile Steven gets McDonalds everyday to get a happy meal.  I came home with the toy one day and Steven's like I want one so they go everyday now to get them for him.  It's so unfair.  After she picked me up, she's like "why aren't I taking anyone else home?"  Because my friends aren't in my spanish class.  "Well, your friends don't come over anymore."  "I haven't seen Katie in a while."  I haven't seen   Katie    in a while!!!  Argg!!!  Always Katie.  Always forgetting me.  Always giving my brother everything.  Always forgetting the little things I ask for.  Always telling everyone else "My daughter has problems."  "My daughter has friend problems."  "Tracie is the hardest to handle."  "Tracie doesn't get as good grades as Chris does."  "Chris is the smart one that has the highest grades in his class while Tracie is the atheletic one that isn't the best."  "Tracie needs to grow taller."  "Tracie speaks chinese worse than Steven."  "Tracie is spoiled because she has a tv, a laptop, and an airconditioner in her room."    I say that Tracie does not have problems, doesn't have friend problems, is no hard to handle if you get on my good side, has better grades than Chris does, smart in her class, and an okay athlete, speaks Chinese fairly well considering how many classes she's missed, and she is spoiled but not as much as Steven because he's getting a cell fone in 7th grade, and he wants a tv so he can play ps2 and its probably gonna be the one I have because Tracie should be a good big sister and give her tv to her brother because she already has a laptop!  Ahhhhhhhhhhh!

      I cannot believe it.  She's been reading my xanga for the past 5 months and has read every single entry I had that was about her when I was angry.  I can't believe she read all that and she didn't even bother to tell me.  I mean wouldn't you get offended and at least ask what the problem was?  I know it was mean to go saying all that stuff behind her back, but she really deserved it.  I mean I got soo annoyed and those entries were like my life and my savor, just to be angry.  I used them to blow off steam at her so I didn't offend her in person and now she's read all of them!  I said all these things about her and get me angry and the fact is that they really do.  I cannot control the way she acts and how I dislike it.  Just when I was starting to forgive her, I find out that she's been reading every mean thing I say about her and she did nothing to prevent it or ask about it.  I mean wouldn't a friend ask?  Well maybe I wasn't being that great a friend either, talking about her behind her back.  But she does piss me off.  I think I need to have a talk with her.

      Sometimes when I'm with my friends, I just feel left out.  I mean they sit there talking about something that I don't know about or they're doing something and forget about me and leave me.  At review today, Holly and Laura left together and didn't even notice I had gone.  They don't realize I'm there until I say something.  Maybe it was just today or maybe they do really hate me.  I know my friends and they can be backstabbing.  None of my friends trust me.  All because of some joke.  Me and Laura always joke about it, but sometimes Katie takes it too far.  She wouldn't trust me with a bag of candy.  She was supposed to hand them out, but she said she needed one more.  So I went to the bag to get her one more and she ripped the bag out of my hands cuz she thought I was stealing them.  And she's been by best friend forever.  I don't want to really admit this to her, but she is really starting to annoy me.  First with twirling, then acting superior to me, downing everything about me, telling my secrets, now she doesn't even trust me?  My friends are my friends, but sometimes I just feel apart from all of them.

      The matheletes raised money by holding a Problem-A-Thon.  My brother and I raised the most money so we got to go on the trip to the Ronald McDonald house.  Only problem was, we were the only 2 that went.  We went in Ms. Martin's car which I think is a little illegal violating teacher-student law thingys, but anyway, I had to sit in a car with Mr. Sime!! Ahhhhhh!!  The awkward silence, the pressure of making a fool of myself.  It was a horrible day.  The homework, the assessment, the car, the Ronald McDonald house, and the HUNGER.  I'm soo hungry, but there are probably people that don't get as much food as I do so I shouldn't complain.  But I want a happy meal soo bad...

      My lacrosse team is not the greatest, but we have some good players.  The only thing is, we'd be much better off without our coach.  She has done nothing but pointless things.  Our drills are pointless because the way she sets them up, they are not effective at all.  She made me demonstrate picking so that everyone would learn cept the drill she created was a horrible rendition of picking.  She disgusts me because she calls herself our coach when we know more about the game than she does.  That's not a good sign...
