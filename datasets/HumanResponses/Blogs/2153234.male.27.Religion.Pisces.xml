      &nbsp;As I write, our youth and campers are finishing up the last closing session for the week.&nbsp; It is always a mixed time for us and for them.&nbsp; As adults, we are ready to get home because we are a bit tired.&nbsp; Our youth are tired as well.&nbsp; BUT, It is always sad as we watch great things come to an end.&nbsp; Please pray for us as are ending our trip.&nbsp; It has been incredible.   We hope to get home early tomorrow evening.&nbsp; We are definitely excited that we get to tell you all that has happened.&nbsp; Please ask us about what God did in our lives.&nbsp; We had great expereinces snorkeling and shopping and airboat riding, but strengthing our love for God was the reason we have invested so much time and energy and money as individuals and as a church.&nbsp;   We are thankful for all OPEN HOUSE did for us and I look forward to our church partnering with them both&nbsp;sooner and later.&nbsp;   For those that left comments, thank you, they got to our youth.&nbsp; We did not get to post as much as I wanted to but hopefully this model will work well in the future.&nbsp;   I want to get to assembly now.&nbsp; Thank you for the priviledge of living out my call to ministry with you.&nbsp; Pray for our trip home and our last night in the hotel.   Grace and Peace  Chris Aho

      Since Chris has been unable to connect to the internet thus far, I am passing along a&nbsp;muddled update of their journey through Wednesday.&nbsp; He believes he will be able to get on-line tomorrow for more.&nbsp;  They had a great trip down Friday and Saturday, enjoying the Dixie Crossroads for seafood and the mall for leisure time.&nbsp; On Sunday they worshipped at the church Chris attended as an&nbsp;elementary student and even saw some of his old&nbsp;family friends.&nbsp; Later that day, they hit the beach for true Florida scenery.&nbsp; That evening they were introduced to their mission center and staffers, focused on their camp activities, and then rounded the evening out with some country Karaoke.&nbsp; Monday the camps went smoothly, and they were averaging the numbers of children they were expecting.&nbsp; Monday evening they took a boat ride in the Everglades and watched&nbsp;the alligators feed.&nbsp; Tuesday they again had a successful day with the children.&nbsp; Soon after their debriefing, they headed to Key Largo for a snorkeling trip over the coral reefs in the Keys.&nbsp; All had a great time, and they saw Florida's beauty.&nbsp; Chris said the weather has been good in that it's been mostly cloudy every day, so they will not be bringing home any "lobster" youth.&nbsp; Today their camps went well again.&nbsp; They took the afternoon off and have been swimming and relaxing at the pool and are headed to Bayside in downtown Miami in a few minutes for dinner.&nbsp;  Things are running smoothly,&nbsp;all have been safe, and they are ministering in the heart of Florida's hurting.&nbsp;  The adults and youth covet your prayers - prayers for their witness and compassion and love on the children of Homestead, FL;&nbsp; prayers for their safety; prayers for the adults' strength and patience and guidance; prayers for the youth to learn and make wise decisions and to be touched and changed and to open up to one another.&nbsp;  Tomorrow night they will be having a Youth Night with the mission center, and Friday they head home after their day ends at 3:00.&nbsp;  Please post them a message and Chris will try to retrieve those tomorrow and pass them along to the group.&nbsp;  Grace and Peace,  Natalie

        Today I am testing my ability to show pictures on the blog.  Right now I will only be able to use pics that are already on the web, but it makes for a pretty blog.   UPDATE  As many of you have already found out, due to some unforeseen circumstances at the grill, Peedie Edwards will not be attending the trip to Florida.  Traci Behrendt will be attending instead.  This is a great sacrifice for her, but it is a wonderful opportunity for us.  Traci has done lots of work already to make this trip happen and I (chrisaho) am really happy that she is going.   Please keep in mind and your prayers all of the people that Peedie works with at the grill.  It seems that there are some hard times with the men and women that serve us so well when we eat there.  We will all miss him, but there are many other trips to come in our future that he might join us on.

						   though i just posted, i have other things to say in a different area, so here they are:  sunday was time change sunday.  i know the spring change is aweful but the fall time change is awesome and totally worth it.   the day started at 7am (which felt like 8) with a shower: normal for a sunday. since i got up on time - actually early -  i was able to go to the cupboard for some cereal, a truly great invention.  i found  urlLink Lucky Charms ...certainly i was the lucky one. then, turned on the newly installed cable tv and realized the Yankees had lost the world series, which already made a great day better, thank you  urlLink espn .  Finally, as i left the house, i held in my hand two cups of freshly brewed  urlLink dunkin donuts coffee : there is none better.  therefore, my vote is for time change sunday.  for those in places where it does not happen, i am very sorry.  this one sunday just might be able to propel my through another year of early morning sunday wakeups in blissful anticipation of the next sunday before halloween.  certainlly april 4 looms on the horizon, but it is still over 5 months away.  long live time change sunday and great d.d. coffee.

						   tuesdays are long for me.   i get up around 615, come to school and workout (even though most cant tell).  then it is 4 hours of reading mixed in with unplanned naps that i dont usually know about until they are over.  then its class for 3 hours on contemporary literature and Christianity.  it is a great class but by 4pm, now, i am exhausted.  i still have a book to read for 7 tonight. i know people in the real world do more than this and would laugh of my 10 hours of reading/discussion/nap but hey, its mentally exhausting dude!!  anyway, the book for this week was great: the sparrow by Mary Doria Russell.  I recommend it even though it is a downer in the end.  we dont always need happy endings, that is where eschatology is helpful. peace chrisaho  _Vii

						   the other day i found out about this new jesus film that is coming out: the gospel of john.  i have two thoughts- 1. the poster for the film reads something like "the word made into a film" echoing "the word made flesh."    question:  shouldnt we revere "the word" - "logos" - made flesh, and the beginning of the gospel a little more than using it as a formula for a tagline for a movie?  2.  the endo of the radio trailer states: "rated pg-13: may not be suitable for children under 13."    questions:  is the gospel suitable for any and all ages to see and respond to? should we applaud filmmakers for making a movie that is about jesus that is real enough to not be rated G?  i hope to see it sometime and i guess would encourage you to as well..anything in creation that can better help us grasp the magnitude and woder of the gospel should encourage us in some way in our spiritual lives. tata for now aho  ps. reply page will be up soon with the help of ben dudley.  urlLink www.makebenfair.blogspot.com

						   hello everyone, yesterday, a friend of mine linked me to his blogspot.  now, here i am.  it seems like a good idea, you know, opening up my thoughts and putting them up for discussion and critique.  feel free to comment and critique, this is a communal thing i guess.  it is all still in the early stages, but hopefully you will enjoy "opening up my head and letting me out" (dmb).  peace chrisaho

						   well we made it here and are now hanging out with the whole family.  everyone is good.  our nephew, braden, is getting big and in a few, we will be too.  turkey is almost ready.   lots of football and lots of video games to come i am sure.  hope you all (or both of you) are having a great day. peace

						     just a quickie.  what do you want for christmas.  i know many of us are too old for some of that stuff, but it is still working for me thankfully.  i think i am gonna add a dell digital dj20 to my list.  let me hear from you.

						      thanks again to ben dudley for a great picture and he asks the correct question, where's the turkey.   actually i think w would be a great guy to hang out with and i would love to meet him someday, but his leadersihp is sometimes different.  at least he is a fun guy.  how all 3 of you who read this will have a great turkey day.  the aho family will rendesvoux in orlando at braden's house, just seconds past the gate to disney.  we dont go there when we are there, we just make fun of the tourists.  like we are not them.   the aho family will be pulling for the packers and the dolphins this weekend.  we are members of the anti-cowboy faction if it still exists and we are also all haters of the lions, though mooch is a northern michigan graduate.  we like him, hope he succeeds, but not the lions.  not sure how that all works out.  really i am tired of school right now too. i wrote a paper today and it stinks.  it is good ideas but doesnt flow well and just want it overwith.  i have one more to write, but am still more interested in reading right now.  this week it is a Quiet Revolution by John perkins, Freebird by Greg Garrett, and soon it will be Philosophical Fragments by Kierkegaard.   peace aho

						      i also thought i would update everyone on the weekend at the ahos.   we at at a cool mongloian buffet stirfry place on friday night with our downstairs neighbors.  they are cool, and good company.  it was the first time we all (all 4 of us, chris natalie john jenny) hung out together and it was good.  he is in a band, revelation darling, and they are playing some right now with maroon 5.  i hope for them that they make it.  jenny is a state student and vet tech.  both are good people and we look forward to hanging again with them.  saturday was the parade (see faikin for aiken).  then i watched some football: congrats to michigan, duke. dinner at california pizza kitchen and then the matrix revolutions.  dinner is always good there.   about the movie, i am not sure what to think.  i am not a big action guy, i like the storylines, intellectual stuff, more that the kungfu stuff. i am a dork.  therefore i was not as impressed with this one.  action was all guns.  storyline was fine but didnt go anywhere.  20 minutes of story, 2 hours of movie.  i also have decided that things are much cooler in the matrix.  cool clothes, cool moves, cool colors and much other stuff.  the spaceship thing is kinda wierd to me.    sunday, church all day, but it was a good day.  it is always good to eat with the youth as we had our annual lovefeast before thanksgiving.  i stole the name from many different people, but it is one of their favorite things to do.    no more thoughts for now.  florida bound on wednesday.  go duke basketball, hurricanes hockey, dolphins and packers on thursday. out

						     the last four years, i have been a regular attender of the Raleigh Christmas Parade.  this parade is definitely the grandaddy of all of the local parades, and a preview of what is to come at the local parades in places like knightdale, rolesville, zebulon, etc...  its not very exciting for me, but the kids we take enjoy it and it is one of the few times each year that i would ever eat krispy kreme and tacobell on the same day. im not sure if it is good or bad to eat these things together. you tell me.  but this year, our experience was quite different.  instead of the modest crowd of usual parade goers, we had a bunch of fake parade lovers due to the appearance of CLAY AIKEN.  he was the grand master or ringleader, or what ever you call a parade leader.  everyone came to watch this guy ride in a convertable down the street.  he didnt sing, shake his hips, or wear cool shoes.  he just sat and waved and the females loved it.    I say females becuase it is females, not just little girls.  i witnessed more than one 30something woman, pretneding to be 19, infatuated with clay.  they were all bummed that starbucks was not a vendor at the parade and they had to settle for bottled water and diet pepsi from the fat lusty hot dog vendor (who is not a regular attender either).   The litte girls loved it, so did the big little girls, and our kids paid no attention.  20 rows back, the girls resorted to handjive on the picnic blankets and the boys found some friends to play football with.  the adults satirically watched, talked about old times, thier parade days, and friends they knew at the parade and their children in the parade.  all in all, it was an enjoyable experience but what is the deal with clay?  Have you heard this guy's song?  i was on board as a supporter of the local guy when he was on that show last year.  and, i am impressed that though losing, he is now more popular that rueben, kelly, or justin.  but, really, does this guy have a stopwatch on his 15 minutes?  did someone accidentally push pause on the ticker?  I dont know.    But what troubles me more is the song: invisible.  have you heard it?  "if i was invisible i could just watch you in your room?..." i could have all my dreams...  "oh wait, i already am [invisible]. "  This is wierd, and the little girls love it, so do their moms, and so do the women.  the song is very close to peeping tomish, and something we should have listened to before we sold it to children.    well, thats that.  i am ok with clay, but the song is really troubling.  heres to clay: the next song, hopefully more wholesome, and his fifteen minutes lasting for a while.  he is a good guy i hear and local, which is good.   thats all for now. let me know what you think  peace  chris

						   the haricut went fine today.  topics of conversation were: european music awards, bad hair bands, why even watch awards shows, and again- purple kool-aide.  the dude is too into the crazy, burnt out, off the wall, religious groups.  he did talk about some buddhist monks too, but i dont really care too much about that stuff.  i know some of the stuff they do is great and very spiritual, but there are too many different underlying convictions.   i was also thinking about blogging and all that this entials.  really, right now, it is one sided conversation.  i tell you what is up with me.  that cool for you, but, it is not very community oriented.  so, i think it is imperative that we engage in conversation and  use the comments section.  i will try to reply back as is appropiate and you let me know when i am wrong.     finally, duke begins the college basketball season tomorrow with a game against detroit.  thankfully, football is over and hopefully we can beat carolina tomorrow.  i also am looking forward to seeing clay aiken at the raleigh christmas parade tomorrow.  he is the grand master or something.  i will be sure to take a picture for all of you who cant be there.  standing in for you  aho

						   so my friend and former roommate, ben dudley, helped me with my blog for a while last night and he did the wonderful thing of giving us a comments page.  thanks ben.    i gotta go get my hair cut in like 7 minutes, but it is always an interesting experinece.  the guy that cuts my hair is named shannon and he owns the salon: crazy combs.  it is one of the coolest places to get a cut and i definitely pay the extra cost partly to say i get my hair cut there.  i really dont think i have very good hair, and my future plan is to try to spend as little time as possible on it, yet still not just end up with a bushy ball on top.   previous conversations with shannon have included:  jim jones and purple kool-aide, james brother of jesus, various religious sects, him getting widows to give him their husbands cool vintage clothing, and old cars.  he has an old ford ranchero that he is painting john deere black.  he also has a tatoo with an elvis face combined with a sacred heart of jesus.  the dude is wakced out, but does a good job with the cut, and i pay more for the expereince, its worth it. peace

						   i have much to catch up on, but cant now becuase i have 6-8pages of writing due in 3 hours.  i will submit this though.  bizarro world continued last week.  in class on monday, no one had finished the reading for the day.  we talked about how kierkegaard would go about picking a wife...which is a lot in and of itself see works of love- great book.  since no one had read though, we could not converse properly on the assignment, therefore dr hall was frustrated, but again blamed herself for some reason.   so we got an email the next day saying: just read for next week, no papers due.  this was great news becuase not only had we not done as we should have, we got rewarded for it.   i also got an assignment back that said "great work: can i have a copy of this to keep?"  dude, that has NEVER happened before. i think i might frame it.    peace thanks for checking back and welcome to new people who are here.

						   every superhero, as he/she is coming of age, arrives at a point of decision.  though my status as a superhero is at least debateable, i must now use a blog for good.  tonight, our youth bible study time will be focused on resources for spiritual growth, online.  below i hope to provide a bunch of links that you could click on to try some of this stuff yourself.     urlLink jesuit prayer site    urlLink cbf sermons  online for download  urlLink upper room daily devo  is free, just signup  urlLink nc baptist youth page , use at your own discretion  urlLink holyspace.org  is really cool with images and thoughts  urlLink one small barking dog   urlLink ADVENT Devos  daily beginning nov 30  urlLink Lent devos  beginning in spring  urlLink Creighton  site with lots of good links  urlLink catholic church of stlouis   urlLink ignatious christian site   urlLink FCA site , click on lower right for daily e-devo  urlLink Passion  conferences, music, etc.  click on thirsty for online journey M urlLink y Utmost for His Highest online   urlLink Campus Journal online , click on "soul Journey" on main page.  good music here too.  urlLink Passport camp   urlLink Studentlife camp   Like anything, some of this you might like, others you wont.  i dont like all of it either.  the first link is my favorite and is present on alot of sites and shows up early in most searches.  use as you would like.   peace chris

						   it turns out that people complained about the $.25 refill idea.  therefore, the perk changed the price for coffee refills to $1. and the refills for soda are now free.  this all came about becuase of the comment box, so i am ready to start a grassroots effort to help make the larry's fair trade coffee, free for refills.  i will definitely tip better if i can spend the money on the barista and not the coffee. peace

						   hey, well its been a while, or at least it seems to me.  you are either in one of two postures: (1) you are on the edge of your seat eagerly anticipating the pithy wisdom this site provides, hoping blissfully that each time you click on the link in your favorites, it will reveal new insight into an otherwise problematic and frustrating world. or (2) you really don't like this, don't read it, but come here out of an invisible obligation you seem to have to me because you think there might be something here eventually, or you just are trying to remember where else you wanted to go and one more click just might jog you memory.  to both of you reading this thanks.  now, to bizarro land.   we often find ourselves in overwhelming and confusing situations where we ask ourselves: "did that just happen?"  I have two from the recent days that I would like to share.  1. Saturday, Natalie worked hard in the house cleaning places and things in the fridge and kitchen of our rent house that I: 1. didnt know existed, 2. don't want to know exist, 3. cant imagine that these places even get dirty.  but, nonetheless, now they are clean and she is in good conscience.   in the midst of cleaning she worked up and appetite for dinner, giving me the choices of: chilis, outback, the village draft house, and Chinese food.  I was really wanting some Chinese for tradition's sake. (more some other day).  Therefore: RED DRAGON IT IS!  we get: chicken fried rice, sesame chicken, and beef with broccoli.  nothing bizarre yet.  after dinner, I decide to eat the traditional fortune cookie.  my personal ritual is to eat the cookie completely and then read the fortune.  after the tasty cookie here is what I found:  "it is less important ti understand than to  enjoy."  You now thinking what is bizarre about that, chris could never type...but that's just it, it is not a mistake on my part.  I got a fortune with a typo.  how does that happen?  how can such a short pithy saying get messed up?  has this ever happened before to anyone else?  I know the grammar is often suspect in the fortunes, but  a typo, never expected that. That is bizarro land number one.   (by the way, we watched legally blonde II on Saturday night and it was funny, stupid but funny.  the dog thing and Dupont circle made me cry.)  2.  I registered for this workshop at school for seniors about placement in ministry after graduation.  I did it mostly because my professor likes for us to do stuff like this, and he looks out for us, so I did it.  I wasn't sure what I was getting into because there was joint program time with both Methodists and baptists.  Methodists had worship planning responsibilities. as I entered (20 minutes late, dunkin donuts coffee in hand though), sally bates was preaching and finishing a sermon which was, nice.  then this guy came up with a guitar to lead music, which is, nice.  he has, coat tie, and nice feel to him.  then there is a glitch in the matrix:  we start singing "come by here my lord, come by here."  which is  cum by ya .  cum by ya, who still sings that, and who ever sang that without a campfire?  I don't get it.  a million and 1 worship songs in the world and folks are gettin into cum by ya!?!?  anyway, I behaved and sang, and moved on, confessing my confusion to no one but you, my dear individual reader.   and, are there not theological problems with that song?  God is here, right? Immanent, all knowing, all present...why must we ask come by now?  is it for me or for God that I ask that?  I don't know.  anyway thanks for entering into my matrix.  I am sure it was as disappointing as reloaded, but at least not as long.   more to come. peace chris

						   you know, some people have links to current music they like, or places the like to go.  others have their current reading on their blog.  i will be one of those people since i read 2-3 books a week for school.  so i would like to make a few reccomendations:  barry harvey's  urlLink  another city   was a pretty good book about the church, and though i struggled through his old testament 8 years ago as a freshman at baylor, the book is good.   urlLink Clyde Edgerton's  Killer Diller   is also a great read, and pretty fun too.  it is a novel and edgerton is a sly critic and commentator of the church and christian culture. it is fun and refreshing and worth picking up as you are falling asleep.

						   hey all,  i found the problem with the link to make ben fair and fixed it.  go see and tell him if you like his beard.   ok, i tried and cant get it to work yet.  anyway, it you want to go there or to helios just like and erase the extra .com  working on it chris  update 3:32 pm eastern time i finally figured it out, you have to "republish" your blog each time you change it so that it accepts the changes.  so i did it and it works. peace,  chrisaho

						   i have a love-hate realtionship with coffee.  for example:  love it hot, hate it cold; love it with cream and sugar, hate it balck; love it from dunkin donuts, hate instant (i have never really had instant, but given that coffee doesn't take that long to make anyway, instant cant be good).  since i have a sort of symbiotic relationship with coffee 6 days a week, any changes in any of the routine have the potential for disaster.  we may be inthe cusp of one here. duke's dining services are pretty inconsistent at best. sometimes a cup is $1.10, other days, same cup: $1.39.  but last year i finally got it all figured out.  refills were free, so buy a cup and hang on to it all day and you can refill after class if you like.   a time or two i would buy coffee at one place and refill at another, but: same cup, same burnt coffee, and i never kept a cup more than a day.     but tuesday, things changed.    it all started last week.  the reading room cafe, 'the perk,'  had a handwritten sign, "$.25 for a refill."   now, i have had my share of refills, so i dont really mind a quarter. but on tuesday i bought my first coffee since the sign, which was gone.  knowing that a refill was a quarter, i bought a large instead of the medium i usually buy.  i figure, more coffee is better than less.  2 hours of reading and napping later, i went for my refill, quarter in hand.  i ask for a refill of the lighter brew and she, the barista, rings it up for something like $1.09 ( i cant remember the price becuase of the shock of it not being a quarter).   well, shocked, i pay my dollar and change and move on.  i still cant believe that refills have jumped to a dollar something.  if i am gonna pay a dollar a cup, that cool, but it better be good and i want a new cup too. really, how much does coffee cost anyway?  not much. even the really fancy starbucks stuff can make like 100 cups or more for $7.99.  at $.08 a cup plus the $.10 cup i fugure they are making $1 a cup.  thats cool, except its duke, they are already really rich.    well, i will stop rambling and ranting and will keep you all up to date on my next experience here on campus.   i am gonna get some today, but not sure about the refill.    and for the record, dunkin donuts coffee is still the best and  urlLink helio's  is the best place in town to drink coffee.  peace

						   So Natalie and I set off for the nation's capitol this weekend.  DC is always a great place to go and hang out. (Sure its no first Monday, but none the less, fun).  Just thought I would update the three of you in my little cyberworld with our highlights.   we arrived about 1130 on Friday night and hit monster traffic in the city.  It was fine and we survived and found the hotel which kindly sent us to the smallest room on the planet that is not on a boat. (I say this imagining that some cruise ships and battle ships probably have very small guest quarters).  We couldn't sleep because we were psyched up for the posh king sized bed that the picture promised.  My front desk call to Sofia ensured that we could be moved the next day,but until then, we were sleepless in DC.   Saturday, things turned quickly.  With a call to the desk at 10am, we were promptly moved to the new room, not the one in the picture, but nice.  Then we had a great lunch on dupont circle at shiftily. burrito- good, tacos- good.  Afternoon at the national art museum highlighted by some great modern art.  Unfortunately I cant remember or find the artist's name so I will update you later.  Next we attempted to do some shopping in Georgetown and urban outfitters, but it didn't happen.  Georgetown is really cool, but not a good place to drive.  It was mad, so we cut our losses, headed to cakelove and resigned to hit urban outfitters on Sunday.    urlLink Cakelove : is awesome.  Read about it.  It is this bakery in DC founded by this young lawyer that loved cooking.  It has style, character and great baked goods.  Though Georgetown was a bust.  It redeemed the afternoon.   Dinner was at the  urlLink Austin Grill , which a great texmex restaurant, among the best we have had this side of Texas.   Sunday began with a late start to  urlLink cedar ridge community church  and then the afternoon in Baltimore.  Baltimore is cool,  we look forward to going back.  Finally, we made it to urban outfitters, bought little and traffic was still a mess.  Sunday night we attended the Passion experience Tour at George Washington University.  We were fortunate to have gotten reserved front row seats and by 7:15, the David Crowder*Band was on stage.  They were amazing and it is always great to see friends again.  and holy cow, Dave is Famous!! There were like hundreds of people surrounding him for autographs and pictures, which makes me think: I don't have a picked with Dave and Toni, except from my wedding when Dave still had long hair.   all in all it was a great trip and we even decided to sleep a little late on Monday to avoid some traffic.  I would recommend all of the above things as well as trying to drive as little as possible next time you are in DC.  They say diplomats don't need to carry insurance when in DC.  That means beef up your uninsured motorist if you plan to drive.  Metro is great but I hear the cabs are expensive.    our next trip will include: Austin grill, St. Matthews Cathedral, Georgetown, and maybe the air and space museum. Plus, we still haven't seen the Jefferson memorial except from a distance.  I hear there is some good church state stuff in there.    well thanks for reading this far.  More to come later. peace chrisaho

						   I have found it is a bit difficult to find time to blog over the break.  It is not that I couldnt get away, but time with family is what it is, thus, I do not have much to blog about for now.  We have spent time with Natalie's family since Christmas and head to Keller tomorrow.  Christmas was great and christmas eve at zbc was good too.  I hope you all have had great times and I will definitely write again in a few days.    Sorry, nothing clever and witty to say, check someone else out for that this week. peace chris

						      I have been meaning to say:  I am really excited abou the new GTO.  I know that most of you who read this dont care much about cars, but this is going to be a great car.  It is definitely on my wish list.   I also know full well that is kinda looks like a Grand Am and other typical sport compacts, but this car will blow Paul Walker and his 2fast2furious kids out of the water.  Kudos to pontiac and the new GTO  Current listening: Coldplay at helios over the speakers, oops, just stopped, time for a change

						      Well, I am headed to my first Duke Basketball game of the year tonight.  We play Princeton and I will be among the Cameron Crazies.  I will not be blue, in a speedo, or streaking tonight, just cheering while our smart kids beat the really smart, unpaid atheltes from Princeton.  It is on ESPN2 at 730 eastern so you all should tune in.  There is an interesting story about the rivalry on the duke athletics page if you want to read.  I will be sure to let you know how it goes.  Go DUKE.

						      although I hate to have to do it, I congradulate the Eagles on the win last night.  Ben is a big Eagles fan and though I am a Dolphins Fan, I am glad he is happy.      It is unfortunate that we cannot win in December.  I am hoping that either the wheel of Karma will come back around some day.  The other possibility is that we have the curse fo the perfect season: we slod out to the devil to get 1972 and it will never happen again.  Oh well, at least we can enjoy every month of football except December and January.   Good Bye Coach Maurice    Hello Coach Laviolette     Our Carolina Hurricanes fired our coach yesterday.  Coach Maurice had been here for 9 years and was a great guy and class act.  Unfortuantely, he couldn't get the team to score goals.  Hopefully our new coach will spark something so we can get back to the playoffs and make another Stanley Cup run.  Go canes.

I dont get internet at home becuase I am poor and I go to Helios Coffee Company to use their free access.  The community and coffee are also good.  I also need to correct fo my liturgical friends: Last sunday was the candle of joy in worship, not hope.  I mis-wrote because we were off on the first sunday of advent, hope Sunday.

						   Well, I worked all morning on getting stuff ready at church for a Live Nativity Pageant that the youth do every couple of years.  Then I came to helios to do some research and got disappointed when I skimmed the blogs.  The guy whose blog is about gay stuff seems really angry.  Certainly i dont know his situation but he seems wrapped up in being a kappa sig and in making fun of people.  Then I went a little too far with the reference below, I apologize, I am sure it is accepted, and we dont want smut here, there is already too much of that on the net, thanks for keeping me straight.    edited by request...   And Finally, since I have just about grossed you out to the point of mush and upset stomach, I am having a great Advent and I am really excited about Christmas.  I really hope you are too.  The weather has been great here is Raleigh and I have had a good amount of stuff to do that has been both productive and interesting.  My prayers are with you all as we light the candle of hope tomorrow in worship.  Peace to you all, and heres to happy blogging.  ps if you want to see irate carl or whoever it is, click here. aho

						      I am playing with my blog again.  I changed the font and I like it.  I cant figure out a lot of it. It is as if I am speaking a different language with someone and can only recognize 2 words of each sentence.  I can spot colors, and fonts a little but it is all trial and error.   What prompted me to write is that Helios is playing Fiona Apple.  Does anyone know what happened to her.  This CD that is playing is great.  In know it was one of those that just dabbled on the fringe of pop music for a little while, like when pop likes to get artistic, but the CD is really good for me at least.  It is not just the few popular songs.  Oh well, gone like the rest of them.    Check out my  urlLink brothers blog , it just started, but when he gets his comments up, let him know what you think.  peace

						        one of my favorite lines from Tommy Boy is when Tommy is in his boat reminiscing about his dad who use to say...you know the rest.  it aint bad, but i dont see it fit to print.  Well, i have been playing with my blog, for about 40 minutes which is entirely too long for today so I am gonna "quit playing with my blog." Do you like the new colors?  let me know.  I will try to play again sometime.  I know that I may now have the ugliest blog ever, but at least it is not the standard peasoup green.  i hate peasoup, but the color is ok. chris

						        Its monday and I am back at Helios to do email, check on my silly fantasy hockey team, and blog for the two of you that read this.  (i always say two of you, there may be more, but i don't want to be pretentious).  We did lots of church stuff this weekend since we like church and I work at church.  The youth Christmas Party was Saturday night and it was enjoyable.  thirty-something youth and some adults.  We had it at a cabin (thank you Estes)  that could cook steak for 50 in 15 minutes, it was like texas.  The present exchange went well with BOjangles "boBucks" being the popular item.  The scandalous item was a red thong and the glow in the dark football and $5bill were also popular.      The  urlLink Grammy Award Nominations  came out this weekend too.  I spent a considerable amout of car time listening to my previously mentioned OutKast CD.  I think it is one of the most entertaining cds I have bought recently.  It makes me dance, think, sing, and smile.  I like it.  It even has some guitar effects that you might not think of on a hiphop album. Hurray for outkast and their 6 nominations.     That being said, I still love Dave Matthews, Dave Crowder and all of the other rock stuff that has helped me love music.  I am not a music snob, I dont really have time, though I might like to be.  Actually, my favorite song of the season is Robert Earl Keens Merry Christmas from the Family.  Enjoy it.       Finally, On Friday, I spend a bunch of time with Free Bird.  I really like this book and reccomend it.  I have 30 pages left, but it is definitely worth the read.  It is easy to read and interesting.  You can choose to put on your thinking cap or you can choose not to and still enjoy.  Go buy it, or check it out of your local library and support a Baylor Guy.  peace

						   I had a first today.  I went and met one of my teachers.    I have had  urlLink Dr. Amy Laura Hall  for three semesters and I thought I should go and talk with her.  Everyone always said you should go talk to your professors but I never did.  I never really had much to talk about I guess.  But today, I did it.  I feel good about it.  I am actually going to do an independent reading class with her next semester on Soren kierkegaard.  Others may join in too, but I feel like this is a step.  I actually talked to a teacher other than Buddy Gilchrest, Jeter Basden, or David Slover.  Rock on.

						   Below I make reference to a funeral I  went to yeaterday.  I actually went to a catholic funeral mass for a family member of a church member.  The mass was nice.  It was cool to be a part of a catholic service and not just write it off as wierd or ritual or old.  I really could appreciat the liturgy and reverence that was present.  It certainly was not as "personal" as a typical funeral service but we did talk about Jesus more than the deceased, which is always good.    I wish my best and prayers for the Moore family in the loss of their mother, grandmother, wife, etc...Katherine.    And, when you get a chance, stop by a catholic service for worship sometime, it will be worth your while to connect to the tradition of the church. peace chris  ps.  lots of blogs come in one day because i dont blog at home.  i have to save up thoughts and then write them all down at the same time.  happy reading.

						       Well, I have renewed my membership to the popculture club.  You may not have known that one existed but when you buy your first real rap cd, you find youself in this unspoken, underground club.   I have been intrigued by this new pop song by andre3000, hey ya!  It was fun, catchy, creative, and I really felt like i wanted to explore hiphop/rap as an art, not just the annoying, rebellious music that my basketball wannabe friends listen to.  So, I willingly took the plunge, I purchased  Speakerboxxx/The Love Below  on the way home from Florida.  We first listened to Andre 3000's  The Love Below  and were less than impressed.  It was pretty profane, suggestive, and though creative, left something to be desired.   Yesterday, on a ride to Fayetteville for a funeral, I listened to Big Boi's,  Speakerboxxx .  I liked it alot better on a first listen than we did the other album.  It is still pretty rough in places, but a more typical rap album.  I think I am going to like Outkast (fyi...two artists: Big Boi and Andre 3000 make up outkast, but have released solo albums together as outkast.  I have no idea if they are gonna preak up  or not.).  It is better than just brash, one hit "oneder" stuff of people like vanilla ice, snow, and sean paul who i cant stand.  I would suggest that if you buy it, you may want the edited version, you miss anything and you can play it with your parents in the car.   If anyone has other suggestions from this new music venture that I am undergoing, I would entertain suggestions.    I am not sure what will come of my pop culture club membership, but I am looking forward to the benefits. peace

						        Well, school is pretty much done.  I have 2, 4page essays to turn in by next week.  I am trying to read a little now, Free Bird is my first one.  It is by the guy who helped Chris Seay write his  urlLink matrix book .  He teaches at Baylor and I hear is a cool guy.  Three chapters in, it is good so far.  The main character is a musician, so any of you who like music might find a kinship with the character.  I think it was nominated for some big awards too.  That doesnt matter if the book is garbage, but maybe gives it some "shelf cred."   I am finding this week that reading doesnt come naturally to me.  I have to make time to do it, like making time to make the bed, put away my clothes, making time to walk the dog.   I may not be able to make time today to read much more though.  I gotta work at church today and then, tonight, the hurricanes play at 7 and the duke bluedevils play at 9.  they are playing Michigan state, who I cheer for except when they play Duke, on ESPN or espn2.  Check out the game, it will be worth your time, maybe?? peace

						   we'reback.  I hope everyone had a great time during the holiday.  We spent time with the family in Florida, which sounds kinda wierd to say.  Traffic was horrible and caused us to have to spend the night in South Carolina somewhere, (exit 33, not sure of the town.   Now it is the push to Christmas, the Advent season as Christians should call it.  Parties, shopping, final tests and papers, then the lull.  I hope we all can enjoy it since it comes but once a year.    in an effort to help you have a better Advent season, I want to encourage everyone to join Follow the Star.  It is an online advent devotional, and I hear its good.  Do it for Jesus if not for yourself.  Well, sorry I don't have anything witty or clever, maybe you could give me something.  Plus, get your list ready so we materialistic americans can share with each other what we want for Chritsmas.  peace

						     The weekend is coming!!!  Unfortunately I have recieved two pastoral messages.  I am looking forward to the "expereince" in a resume and ministerial sort of way, but both of them are difficult situations. 1.  I will be doing a funeral for a 4 year old on Sunday.  2. I will talk in the near future to a family about their young father's terminal cancer.  Kids are 5th grade and younger.  Anyway, sorry to bring gloom to the blog.     Happier Notes:  Duke beat Florida State last night to the chants of " up  two  touchdowns (clap   clap    clapclapclap) and " FOOT   BALL    SCHOOL --- FOOTBALLSCHOOL"     All of our clapping was in the shape of the gator clap as well.    Enjoy the SuperBowl.  I hope Carolina wins cause I live here and I love the Dolphins and hate the rest of the AFC East.    And Finally, 6 Days to Duke V Carolina 1.    Visit Tom's Blog and leave good feedback for him.  He is new to the community and is a good guy.  We shared a ghetto apartment our senior year at baylor with 4 other goof balls like ourselves.  Well tom is not really a goofball, but is great.

						   I am not really a homebody, but sometimes I dont have a choice.  The number of days that I have not gone somewhere in my car since we moved into our house in raleigh is like 2. One was yesterday and I dont know the other but I am sure there was one.     But Sunday at 10am it started to snow here in the south thanks to the clashing of a cold front from the north and some moisture from gulf.  It snowed on sunday and sleeted sunday night into monday.  Monday brought freezing rain and the first day in the house.  I escaped to helios only to find my computer crapping out.   Tuesday was the house all day.  It was nice but a little boring.  The day ended with a veiwing of  urlLink Keeping the Faith , a movie i recomend you see at least once, and then bed.  Today the roads have started to melt and we can get out of the house again.     The kids of the are have missed 3 days of school and Church has been cancelled for tonight.  I am spending lots of time on the net today catching up on some things I need to do and soon will be back to reading for classes which I missed this week.  The weather was fun, and since I have a Jeep I like to drive in it when I can.    Trouncing over snowbanks and sliding though the icy roads in 4wd makes the 359 days a year that it sucks to drive a jeep all worth it.   Hopefully more will come before the winter ends, but maybe on a wednesday and thursday this time so I wont miss school.  I actually like going and hate missing.  I have only about 12 weeks left of this stuff and want to get all I can out of it. peace

						     I have wanted to ask these questions for a while and I ask them sincerely.  I respect your opinions, at least those of you who acknowledge who you really are.  Why does everyone say that they are "over" Dave Matthews?         I know that he is still making music that sound like it did in 1995 but other bands like the dead never changed either.         There is continuity in the sound of any band that last for a long time.         What I really like about his music is the way that he deals with ideas of faith and life.  Much of his music deals with        issues of race wrongdoing, and our spiritual lives.  Don't drink the water reminds us of white conquest of indians and        african tribes.  Another song states "now you are nailing God to a tree and saying FORGIVE ME, FORGIVE ME!!" yeah       like only every day right?  Or what abour Grey Street, someone trapped without meaning and purpose.   I could go on but my mission here is not to convince you, but to pose the question, why are we over songs that ask these questions?  I guess I am drawn to the words as much if not more that to the "beat."  Why is it cooler to list music on your blog that is new, and forthcoming, and to list people that are not mainstream yet?        I don't really have time to search out new music, so I end up taking advice from others on who I should try. For example: I thought I was on the cutting edge of this outkast thing only to find out that real rap fans have been listening for 10 years.  Is there anything legitimate on top 40 radio anymore?   It seems like I am going to have to hate everything played on my local Clearchannel (the music devil) station if I want to pretent to be a music connisour.  I don't like britney, or seanpaul, or christina, or clay, or rueben, or (insert flavor of the week here) but are they bad music or are we just against they because we dont like machine that turned them out?  We don't like lots of stuff that comes out of nashville but we accept Dave Crowder and Shaun Groves..  Finally, I think i am done for now.  I have put myself in a meloncholy mood writing this but I just wonder why we can get critized for liking music that is just normal?   I like Dave Matthews and always will and I dont think anyone should have to apologize for their tastes in music.   A last note: this blog does not come as a respone to the comments on the blog below, thought it may seem that way.  I actually have a mental list of topics I want to blog about and this was on my mind during our recent snowstorm.  The comments just gave timelyness to the questions. grace and peace to you all.    ps.  if you are intersted in some thought provoking dm songs from this new album, check out save me and gravedigger, stay or leave is my personal favorite though.

						     Well it is Friday and I have quite a bit of stuff to do.  I have to work at church, meet with a task force leader and our ass. Pastor, David, if he goes to work today.  I have to plan a work day which is tomorrow. And then I have a bunch of hours of reading for class next Monday and Tuesday.  Therefore, I am at helio's drinking a smoothie and coffee and typing on a blog that no one reads, (don't be offended if you do read, it is just to underscore the procrastination that I am involved in at the moment).  Anyway, I need a "local celebrity" to speak at a Valentines Banquet at church on Feb. 15.  This is the kind of thing you should book months in advance which is why I am 4 weeks out trying to do it. If you have any ideas that are feasible, coach K and Dean Smith are probably not options, let me know in the comments section.  ENGLAND  Natalie and I have friends,  urlLink Greg and Molly Moore  who are serving in England as Methodist Ministers for a year.  Officially Greg is the minister and Molly works as some school that looks like Hogwarts (I am taking her word for it because I have never seen or spelled hogwarts before).  They have pictures of the great country and their travels on their  urlLink website, check it out.   DUKE  Finally, our beloved basketball team has been on a roll of late.  Shooting well and playing Good defense, I hope they can hold out until April.  It would be a great season to graduate after.

						    I got to spend last weekend snowboarding in the mountains of NC and I have to say that it was one of the best weekends of the winter for me.  I really love snowboarding.  (I am not really that good, but I can get down the mountain without impailing myself or others and I can get off the lift without creating a human speedbump for those in the chair behind me.) But what a rush: crusing down the mountian, (big hill here out east) cool wind on your face, great view ahead, blowing by the beginners on the intermediate slopes.  There are few things like it.  I know some people love the beach and get to go there for spring break, but if I had my choice, I would hit the mountains.  If you have not snowboarded before, you should try it, especially if you are under the age of 25.  I know it takes a day of sittin' on your rear to learn the sport, but 4 years later, the day on my rear has paid for itself over and over again.  This trip was some of the best money our youth ministry has spent this year.

						     I had the priviledge of attending last night's Duke basketball game at Cameron Indoor Stadium.  We played NC State, an in town rival, for the early lead in the ACC.  It was truly and amazing experience.  Being at a Duke home basketball game is one of the most unique and special sporting experiences that anyone can ever experinece.   The building is small, 10,000 people pile in, shoulder to shoulder, and it is two hours of cheering, screaming, joy, and pain.  I have been to the olympics (saw Michael Johnson set the World Record in the 200),  the Stanley Cup finals, and many other football and baksetball games, and this does not really compare.  Certainly seeing world records set and Gold medals won was an amazing expereince, but seeing Duke Beat carolina or trounce State like thy did last night is at least a tie for first in my book.   The dunk you are looking at happend right in front of me, I was third row behind the basket where Duke shot in the second half.  I had a great view and like ben's audio adrenaline concert, It is something i will never forget. Everytime I am at a game I feel blessed and wish that all of the people I know and love and even people I dont love could expereince it.  Thank you DUKE for great tickets, a great game, and some of the best sporting expereinces of my life.    Finally, if you have read this far, I thought I would let you in on a few of the cheers from last night.  You see, the cheering of the fans is amazing and really gets in the head of the other team.  Here is a sample of last night's cheers:  1. "If you can't Go to college, Go to state" (this is the staple Duke v State cheer) 2. section 1: "BIG"      Section 2: "HIGH"     section 3: "SCHOOL" all in unison quickly " BIG HIGH SCHOOL!" this cheer repeats over and over  3.  After Marchs Melvin fumbles the ball and turns it over: "YOU cant Dribble" clap clap clapclapclap 4. Various taunts of Julius Hodge, state's best player 5. "OUR HOUSE" 6. "We Want Wake, We Want Wake!" 7. and since no group of Cameron Crazies gets together without sending the Tarheels to "hell", the state cheer evolves into this: "If you cant go to college go to state,  if you cant go to state go to jail,  if you cant go to jail, go to hell,  go to hell carolina go to hell!!!"  Cameron Crazies, a wild and profane bunch of students.  Wish you were there.   urlLink pictures from last night

						     I couldn't Blog yesterday, but I wanted to congratulate the Baylor Women for winning a game over Texas.  I am looking forward to an NCAA tournament bid  and maybe I can support them if they get put in the region that plays here in Durham at Cameron Indoor Satdium. If you are in Waco, you should support our Baylor Womens basketball team.  I know many might be able to reflect upon all of the tedious things about womens basketball but...well, just go support them so that we can stay in the bigXII.

						     I updated the blog today with some different music I have been listening to and a few of the books I have to read this semester.   I have gotten into reading fiction lately and I really enjoyed Greg Garrett's Cycling.  It is not a difficult book to read, but is a fun and sad story about a guy in waco.  He is a little bit like the dude.  It is a good read with an interesting ending.  It probably won't change your world but might keep you from the "evil" tv for a while.    Finally.  I am taking a class on the history of missions from america with Grant Wacker.  For this class I will have to do a project/paper of about 15-20 pages.  The possibilities are endless so long as it pertians to missions.  My initial thought is looking at Hollywood's preception of missions through the matrix trilogy.  I would entertain your thought on the subject.  I know Chris Seay wrote on the matrix already, and many others have as well, but I am not sure if they have dealt with this angle at all.  If you know of someplace it has been dealt with, please tell me becuase I don't want to do something that has already been done. peace to you all

						      Today's title is not because I am sappy or emotional today, I just liked the title of yesterday's blog and thought I would continue.   I am realizing that sometimes, lots of the time I just want to be lazy, like  urlLink the dude .  I like the dude, but he doesnt really exist.  I like meaningful work, but sometimes I shy away from that which seems hard.  I like the little things in life, Dunkin Donuts coffee, the little time I have with my xBox, real conversations with people i hang out with at church and school, time with Natalie and my dog, and getting interesting things accomplished, BUT, sometimes it is little tasks that overwhelm me and I just keep putting them off.  For Example:  I am taking about 14 people skiing this weekend.  I have to call 3 of them about their personal dimensions for fitting for snowboards.  I cant seem to muster up the energy to spend 10 minutes on the phone with them.  I have not had time at the right time in the past few days but still, I cant do it.  And, as I sit here typing nonsense the guy next to me is intensely studying hebrew, the girl across from me is typing and reseatching and everyone else has a thick book and at least pretending to study.  Me, I got up at 9, showered, fed the dog and myself, got DD coffee, came  to the reading room and have been checking email, adjusting my fantasy hockey team and blogging now for about 35 minutes.  Sure all of this takes time, but I got a book to read.  SO, after I finish this blog, I will read  Kierkegaard as Religious thinker  until about 2pm.  THen i will hang with Patrick King and talk about it, then I will go to class with another guy with the last name of king, david king, and we will study about American Missions in history and specifically in China until i Go home to eat dinner and hang with my wife and dog.  I will not stay up late tonight if i can help it and will not fall asleep watching tv as is one of my bad habits.  OK, 2 more notes below and then i am off.     Kierkegaard   I have been studying some of this guy's works for about 6 months now and he really has some great things to say.  I have trouble internalizing it alot, but he always seems to stick stuff in his writing that pushes me into a little bit deeper thought.  I recently read this quote of his that I found in the book cited above: "The doctrine in the established Church and its organization are very good.  But the lives, our lives- believe me, they are mediocre."    He was speaking from a 19th century lutheran context in Denmark as a "good lutheran"  but it points me to wonder about the way we work our churches and possibly "customize" them for us and for our needs. When we make churches that meet our needs, are we making a church that is mediocre the match our lives?  We must never dumb it down to us, but must push our selves up, or better said, let God's grace pull us up into his church.      Basketball   We started Church league basketball in Zebulon last night.  the ZBC team has picked up quite a few free agents over the break.  We had a smaller team going that had won 4 championships in a row, but due to a fallout over some silly attitude problems, our "Phil Jackson" decided to retire.  We had 13 guys last night, resulting in not enough pt to go around.  I am going to have a good attitude about it all and hope that I can build some better friendships along the way.  I need to not be a baby.  Plus, i am dreadfully out of basketball shape.  The cardio is there but it seems as though each day I am less and less coordinated.  Sucks to get old.  anyway congrats to east wake highschooler Heath Brantley who came in for me around the 3 minute mark and had a great steal and bucket as they mounted a 6 point comback with less than 2 minutes to play.  If you have read this whole blog, you are awesome, thanks for putting up with me.  If you have skimmed to the end, well you have missed something I am sure.   ps.  the bball pic is not of our league, we jump waaaaaay higher than that.  today' dell dj sounds: before these crowded streets, dave matthews

						     Well, Today is my last "first day od school" for a while.  I may have others in my future, but it is my last first day of school at Duke University.  I have had 8 of these now and it is actually a bit sobering.  While I didnt realize it until now, I have been celebrating it well.  I woke up late this morning, got dinner in the croc pot, ate breakfast, listened to sports radio for 2 hours while doing this stuff and traveling to campus.  Then i exercized for a hour (another first day of something, more to come), and at cosmic cantina in front of the  urlLink chapel.   It has been peaceful and pretty enjoyable.   Today's soundtrack has been: outkast-speakerboxx, maroon 5-songs songs about jane, travis-12 memories, and the vanilla sky soundtrack.

						   I am not really sure if it matters to anyone but I believe I am back again.  I have actually been able to blog for a few days now but one day it was giving me error messages and the other I forgot.  Sometimes I feel like I have alot i could blog about while others I feel like I have nothing.  But here are a few notes I would like to pass along: I had my best grades ever last semester despite what UBC carl said about my music choices, I got the to see the hurricanes win 2-0 over the St. Louis Blues this week which was a great game, we were 15 rows from the glass and the tix were free too. Duke keeps on winning and the ACC season starts this week for them and  Over the holiday I involved myself in two tv marathons while at Natalie's parent's house:     The second TV marathon was on a monday and the family joined me in watching Nick and Jessica and NEWLEYWEDS.  This show was kinda funny, but really stupid.  It was definitely like a train wreck: you know you shouldnt but you cant help but watch.  The first marathon was American Chopper on the day after Christmas:   I actually really liked this show, more for the cool motorcycles than for the moronic, yet creative, son and the lazy bossy dad.  Clearly the younger brother, mikey (the guy with glasses and curly hair) is the coolest guy on the show.    I got too much tv watching in over the holidays so I recuperating at home now.  I am working on loading music into my computer and digital dj and am trying to find some time to play some SSX3 which my brother got me for Christmas.  Thanks Jeff.  That is all for now my friends.  peace aho

						   Being sick is a real drag.  I got a cold on tuesday and have not been the same since.  I can do things with intensity for about 20 mintues and then I have to just give up.  It is like my brains functionability is linked to the amount of stuff clogging my sinuses.  I dont understand this.  But I would like put three things forward:  1. DUKE BASKETBALL: Natalie got to see her first Duke basketball game in person last night.  We played Valpo and beat them pretty badly.  Though it was a blowout, it was pretty exciting and I was glad we got to go.  I would not have gone but it is probably the last game I will go to this year and possibly ever.  It was great to share that with her and to go out on a big win.    I started talking about them a few weeks ago and then we lost a few games.  Therefore, I will probably not blog again about them until after they finish the season.  So, note this: I am on DUKE'S side, (mens and women's too) and am pulling for championships of huge proportions.  That said, I will be away from the subject because it is close to the heart.   2. We are ankle deep in slush, snow, freezing rain, and sleet again today.  The school age kids have missed 5+ days of school and all of their makeup days are gone.  This is only of note because this is FREAKIN NORTH CAROLINA.  I know "north" is in the name, but it is a relative term.  Sure we are north of the equator, key west and the southern carolina, but the people of this state grow cotton, rice, soybeans and tobacco.  This is the heart of the south!!!  So, we got lots of winter weather this year and if the psychics from the farmers almanac is right, there is more to come in march.  I have not seen this much snow and mess outside of  urlLink upper Michigan  in my whole life.  3.  I love pizza.  Last night we got pizza from this place called Lilly's and it was good.  We also have this shop called  urlLink Capital Creations  which is really good too.  So, if you want to come visit, you can try the bar-b-q on your own, but you can trust me for some great pizza.    well i am off to eat some cold pizza and get hopped up on cold medicine- advil cold and sinus, here i come.

						      my computer is still stricken with a sort of alzheimers due to an internal batter dysfunction, but i have managed to take it on a field trip to the internet today.  Computers being down are a drag.   here is an update on me though: it has been a really busy last 7 days.  I have traveled to texas, myrtle beach, led a youth sunday, gone to class, read many articles on the matrix, gotten sick, stressed over the status of my Haiti mission trip and dealt with needing a new transmission in my Jeep.   My trip to Texas and the current retreat was Great.  I got to see old friends like Jamie (Dudley) Allen, Linda Dudley, and Jake Hall.  I also made new friends with lots of "young cbf ministers" and guys like David Burroughs of Passport.  In case you didnt know, George Mason is a pretty good preacher and Dallas is a nice city. My Mrytle Beach trip was to lead a Breakout session for a bunch of youth ministers at a CBFNC youth ministers retreat.  My pastor Jack Glasgow and I rocked the room as we set up a hegalian "thesis+antithesis= Synthesis" idea for healthy staff relationships.   I got a cold from being run down but 12 hours of sleep last night has helped. My Jeep decided it needed a new transmission on my way to our church 's mardisgras party on sunday night, that will cost about $1800.  Again reiterating that Jeeps are fun about 8 days a year: 5 in the summer when it is not 150 degrees or raining, and 3 in the winter when i can drive through the snow with the 4wd.  If you would like to contribute to a fund to help me pay for the transmission, you can send you checks and change to: Chris's Jeep repair c/o Chris Aho PO Box 94 Zebulon, NC 27597  I am also supposed to go on a medical mission trip to Haiti in March, but it will probably be cancelled due to the govt problems there right now.  I will not be near any of the violence if I do get to go, but getting out of Port-au-Prince will be a problem.   Finally, I have an outline for my Matrix and missions paper due on tuesday and have lots of work left to do, actually i need to get started.    Life is really busy, but I love it and hope you do too.  I miss writing on my blog and hopefully I will find a solution to the computer problem soon so I can get back to a normal life schedule. peace aho ps.  any typos i contribute to the fact that it is almost 2pm and the only thing i have in my stomach is coffee.  I got the shakes and need some food.   My politik: (see ben's blog)  I have not completely thought through my politik yet but here are a few preliminary thoughts: I think our nation should be in the business of helping others like Haiti instead of always levying embargos on trade that keep people down.  We could be likened to missionaries, but often we enforce before we listen.I think people should be less power hungry. (photo above is of refugees the us is turning away, even though their own national situation is terrible) I think Christians should be more excited about movies that display grace in practical ways and not just excited about the biblical films that studios peddle to them. I think people should think critically about the end times and not just read the gospel according to Jerry Jenkins and Tim Lahaye- read just a little about darbism and you realize some of the stretches he makes. I think we need to think about the church's worship everyday and be critical so that we can always point people towards God- we dont need to just inherit the models of the "cool" or "tradiditonal" churches. I think everyone should have the opportunity to study the christian faith seriously: i am grateful for the opportunity to study at duke and i think you might be cheating yourself if you choose to go to school in places like fortworth, new orleans and wakeforest, nc.  Set your intellectual standards high for christianity, it can take it. i think we need compassion, grace, love, listening, less talking, community... thats all for now. more later

						   I am growing to hate my computer.  Hate isnt really right, but thought I desparately wish I had it, I dont miss it.  Other than typing letter that I should and surfing the net, I get everything done without it.  But it cant seem to get fixed.  It seems it has a case of alzheimers.  When you turn it off and unplug it to take it with you (its a laptop), it completely forgets who it is and what it does.  Then, after you get it to the desktop, it still doesnt realize that it has programs, and drives and lots of other cool and interesting stuff that it would enjoy knowing it had.   This is also problematic for my fake ipod.  I cant adjust anything, and cant upload anything.  Sure i can delete my whole library, but with no computer, there is not way to upload cool new tunes for justin timberlake and jessica simpson.   So, Computers suck.  Even when they work they suck, but hey they do let me talk at you, does that suck? peace computerless

						   I hope you all enjoyed the Duke v UNC game last night, though it was tense, I certainly did.  Surely it will be an ESPN Instant Classic and I will be able to expereince Chris Duhon Ripping the hearts out of the 21000 in the deandome again.  If you did not see it, urlLink  click here  and you can check up on it.  If you want to see picutres,  urlLink click here .     The one wierd thing  is that we here in NC dont get to enjoy Dick Vitale in all of his DUKE lovingness and favoritism.  When we play on ESPN with him as the commentator it is an enjoyable experience as he extolls greatensses of DUKE that may not even exist.  Instead we get a local affiliate and a Jefferson Pilot Sports feed that preempts the regular evening programming on the CBS Station.  These ACC games are so important that people cant watch CSI and Survivor until the middle of the night.  It is like the anm/ut rivalry times 10, and in your face whether you like it or not.  I am thankful for it.  Finally,  One Tragic Thing.  I used to like carolina a little bit.  I always favored DUKE but was raised to respect Dean Smith and the way he ran a classy basketball program.  I still feel that way as far as respect, but I really dont like carolina any more.  It would be like being indifferent and then being taught to hate the aggies by your friends on 6th street, it really sinks in.  Therefore you can imagine my suprise when I hear the tune to "High above ole trinity's waters, up where things are right, hail to the our alma mater...hail ole Keller High" being played by the tarheel pep band.  Yes that is right, though Keller High School stole our Fight song from Baylor (good song, poor luck in some sports lately)  we stole our School song from that college in Chapel Hill.  I am very dissappointed in my forefathers from Keller and my only consolation comes from the fact that I was not born there, I moved there and had to go there becuase my parents said so. Mom, Dad, I love you but maybe you should have uncovered every stone before you chose good "Ole Keller High".  Hope you enjoyed this, I did.  peace for now  LETS GO DUKE

						   Last week I was having some issues with my computer, this has never happed before.  Error messages abounded, especially upon startup.  I knew this was not good, but as long as i could bypass them, I thought it would be alright. Then the day came, last wednesday, I could bypass them no longer.  My computer pulled me over and asked for a T O.  There fore I have been without for 10 days now and it has completely thrown my rhythm.  I dont get stuff done I normally do, and I cant blog.  I know few care about the last part, but I enjoy it nonetheless.  Therefore, I will submit the above blogs without the joy of pretty picutres  becuase the right click button does not work on the school computer that I am on, and we will all pray that I will not have to use the typewriter again to publish announcements becuase, though typewriters have a cool retro vibe to them, they are terribly impractical in 2004 and you can achieve the same thing with courier font.  Peace Computerless Chris

						   Well, I have been out of my blog community for a little while, due to a few factors.  Here are some reflections.  1.  My computer has been out for  2 months now.  It is a good thing I have had nothing due at school.  I am getting it fixed no and it has shown me that I may be in the wrong business.  FirstServ is the name of the place where IBM told me to take it.  It is cool since it is close to the house and they are generally friendly people.  I hand off my computer and 3 hours later I get a call.  Good news!  we have found the problem, it is a battery, the part costs $27.    This is great, but there is a catch.  For some reason, I will be paying $15 for shipping and $90 for labor which makes this $27 problem a $150 problem.  Luckily, it is not officially my computer so, the church will pay for it since it is officially theirs.  I am looking forward to using it with our new youth Jumbotron though. 12ft by 9ft screen and projector we just had installed.  It should be fun.  But while I am preparing bible studies for something like 4.25 an hour, the guy who used to ruin the curve in my high school comp sci class is rackin it up.  2.  I will intentionally blog more after the mens final four is over, I dont want to jinx my team by bragging or setting my expectations too low, but let me just say this about my team (that is the team i root for): i am cautiously optimistic.  But, I have a few other reflecetions about the tournament.  The cable company has been broadcasting all of the games in digital on their digital channels.  This has been great for avioding the commecials but the reception has been less than spectacular.  None the less, I have thoroughly enjoyed the time I have gotten to spend in front of Basketball in the past few weeks.   I would like to say that the officiating has been less than spectacular though.  My first example would be from the Dayton v. DePaul game.  I believe it was dayton that got robbed.  I also think Xavier got the short end of the stick last night tough I was pleased with the outcome of that game.  Which brings me to:  ROBBERY IN NORMAN Now, folks from Texas have even less reason to like Oklahoma, as it was the sight of the officials taking the game away from the fighting Lady Bears of Baylor.  I actually watched  a good portion of this game, ( i dont really like girls bball at all) and could not believe that we turned the ball over like that and that we got screwed like that.  It is unfortunate that the officials screwed up, had a chance to fix it, and screwed up again.    As a former basketball official, I often defend the officials, but, this month, I have no reason to defend.  Rather, I believe I should get back into that line of work becuase it seems that the payoffs are good.  peace  Oh wait, I would like to recognize, Tom for kicking our butts in the Tournament challenge on ESPN.com.  It aint over yet, but I am definitely out.  Way to go tom, check out his blog with the link to the right.

						       I have put together a "group" for those of you who would like to try to predict the ncaa tournament games next week.  It is on espn.com.  To join in,  urlLink click here , then create an account.  After you give them your info, find the place where it allows you to join a group.    My group is named: ahos blog group The password to join is: gobaylor  It is a private group which means you need the password to join it, but anyone is welcome.  It would be nice if you could identify yourself in some way in your username or something like that so that we can see how we compare to each other.    Thats all for now, happy picking and blogging  ps. you cannot pick games until sunday night and must do so before they start next thursday morning.

						      I still do not have a working computer so today I got a library card and have joined the internet surfers at  urlLink Wake County Public library .  I only have 8 minutes left on my session and so I gotta make this quick.  I spent the weekend with my 6th and 7th grade girls at the CBFNC spring youth retreat at Vineyard Camp in the mountains.  I actually rode a horse, which is why there is a picture of one above.  It was an interesting expereince, but what I cannot figure out is why it was the girls and not the boys who rode side saddle.  I am not sure that comments are necessary there.  I missed the carolina/ Duke game but  I am glad that we won and look forward to this friday and the ACC tournament.  I plan to watch as much ball as i have time for.  4 minutes left in my internet session.  natalie made a great statement the other day regarding carolina.  We had been to the duke game a few days before.  On a later night we came home and i turned on the tv. Carolina was playing  at home.  She say the light blue and said: "you know, after seeing the blue at duke, the baby blue on tv just looks wimpy."    atta girl!!!  Well, I will catch up on more bloggin soon, and will try to post tournament challenge info.  peace, 40 seconds to spare.

						      New opportunities is a great way to title a blog that comes on the heels of a "senior meeting."  The div school is preparing us for all of the events to come around graduation, (which is may 8-9 if any of you would like to join me/us).  While these meetings are at times dreadfully boring, they are necessary, so I go, sit, listen, and check my scepticism at the door.  All this graduation talk is fueling a case of senioritis that has come on recently as well.  I dont mind haveing work, I just dont want to do it.  A second new opportunity arises though.  Since I will not be in Haiti next week, I can participate in the annual ritual of FILLING OUT A BRACKET for the NCAA tourney.  So, next week I will post info and my bracket and I invite you to challenge me.  Let us get together a friendly group of bracket brains.  Stay tuned, I will do the initial work, you will just have to follow. peace

						       urlLink click to link to the story  Well, itis monday and I go to class on monday afternoons.  Today I found out the the mission trip I am supposed to take to Haiti has been cancelled.  We were to leave on Sunday but now will not.  It is ok I guess since I have lots of other stuff going on at work and school, but it is really sad that we cannot go.  Certainly now is not the best time to go there since their Govt is struggling so much and the US presence may not help.  The country's problems are so complex that it is difficult to know where to start with help.  I hope you all will add Haiti to the list of concerns that you have for people who need our help in our world and I hope that you will pray.   Pray for two things specifically; 1. that our goventment will be instruments of peace on behalf of concerned americans and christians, 2. that Christians and missionaries who minister in Haiti will be able to return to their posts soon so that they can continue to be the presence of Christ for those people. thanks back with more later in the week

						   I just want to get you ( both of you) up to date on some recent happenings in my life. I have finished the bulk of my work to complete the final semester in my Master of Divinity program at Duke Divinity.  It was terribly busy and stressful last week so I blogged to free my mind but had no real commitment to maintaining consistency with it.  The two papers i completed on friday were as titled: "A Missionary in  The Matrix " and "Hollywood's Haiti: A view of Haiti from the Big Screen."  I am pleased with them both, I accomplished what I wanted to with them.  the missionary paper is 15 pages about Morpheous and how he fits the historical stereotype of American Missionaries to foreign lands, as well as, how these expereinces of his are pretty typical. The Haiti is an exploration of major feature films that were set in or deal with Haiti.  It is interesting, but reflects the reality that I only had about 20 hours put into it. We left for our first and probably last staff retreat as a church staff on Friday afternoon and had a great time eventhough our leader and pastor Jack was not able to attend.  We missed him, but the kids had fun.  On to the food: I have been thinking about putting together a series of things as lists for the blogspot and the food one came first becuase it was easier.  The one I really want to do will come soon and will focus on the Christian retail industry.  For now, I will complete my listings of my favorite foods.      Bojangles is a regional chain of restaurants serving cajun/southern style fried chicken.  It is definitely a love/hate type of place.  For those of you who have never eaten at one, it is like popey's (spelling?) times 10. (sorry ben).  The chicken is good, but the chicken fillet biscuit combo is amazing.  It is a biscuit with a cajun seasoned chicken breast.  It comes with your choice of side, fries and coke if it is lunch time, potato cakes and coffee if it is breakfast.  It is the kind of meal that you can eat twice a day, and though it leads to a shortened lifespan, it is totally worth it.     I actually do eat healthy food though you cant really tell sometimes.  When it comes to salad, there is a tie for first between Olive Garden's salad and Outback's side salad with tangy Tomato dressing.  For flavor, I go with the outback and if you like red dressings, this is the one for you. But lately the takeout salads at outback have gotten a little skimpy so we are exploring the Olive Garden as well.  This is definitely an old standby and you cant go wring with dinner for two of salad and breadstick for less than $10 and usually you can get a free coke while you are waiting.    In my book, no better way to start the morning (if whoopie is not an option).  You cant go wrong.  I know that the Krispy Kreme argument enters the discussion at this point (sorry Tom), but for my money and pleasure, a boston kreme and toasted coconut with a large coffee with cream and sugar is just the best way to start the day.  My problems with krispy kreme are due only to the intense pleasure they bring.  I have had a hot KK donut and once you have that fresh one for free, the standard is too high.  you have one, then another, and then, against your better judgement, you want to have another.  I can get sick too quickly.  But is is so worth it sometimes.   BUT, for day to day pleasure, as far as donuts goes, DD coffee is the place.  (ps. i rarely get the donuts with the coffee, mostly just the coffee).   And, here is one last time for Dunkin Donuts.  If you have a choice, go to the older shop.  The stuff is just better and usually cheaper too.  I Have two different shops on my way and the old one is better and the coffee is 40 cents cheaper too.  Plus the lady behind the counter has a lot more character.  Thanks for reading. peace

						   To start, I have to say that the Damien Rice last night was at best strange for my taste.  Now I am by no means writing the guy off, and I am still intrigued, but it was different.  Please, take that with a grain of salt since I am the guy who: bought kanye west and the vines at the same time saw starflyer 59 multiple times in concert cant understand what is so great about matt redman listens to outkast often and enjoys it robbed the churches clothes closet so that I could have a jacket like andre 3000 still listens to Dave Matthews Recognized Oak Ridge Boys songs on the radio cant stand most 80's music, except def leppard, huey lewis, and the top gun soundtrack still has not seen the movie grease, or dirty dancing, or ghost likes lebowski and listens to lots of sports talk radio.   I know I am not the most well informed musically, but his performance was, none the less, strange. oh yeah, I am really interested in buying the N.E.R.D. cd as well as the neptunes compilation   On to my favorite foods:      After debating about putting a healthy food up for today, I decided on the Chick-fil-a chicken nuggets.  Personally, I could eat a 12 pack a day easily, and if I am feeling gluttonous, I value size the combo, or I add on the $1.45 cheesecake slice.  This makes for a great lunch while I sit and read the Chronicle, the Duke = to the Lariat, except better, or while I am cruising down the road.   I usually get it with a coke.  Finally, thanks for reading today, if you are still there.  If you are not there, this is not very saturates, but could be.  If you are, and are not commenting, that is ok too.  Just wanted to say hi! peace

						       On wednesday nights I usually unwind by watching some tv after I get home from a busy day at church.  Tonight is the same, but I am having to stay up late.  You see, it turns out this guy Damien Rice is on Letterman tonight and at the recomendation of many of the music snobs I know, I am going to stay up and listen ot this guy play.  If I had tivo I would definitely go to bed and see it in the morining but as I think about that I realize: I could afford tivo, i could have afforded to buy the damn cd months ago.  so i wait......  While I wait...   I have been working on a list of the top 10 stupidest things that are legitimately put out by Christian Bookstores.  The list I going well and will be released by me soon, right here, but in the mean time, with the song  "a few of my favorite things" in my head, I begin a list of my favorite foods.  I am starting really strong but I think there is room for improvement.   It all began with the struggle to get over my beloved Blue Bell after I moved to NC.  Soon after DMB released the flavor, ONE SWEET WHIRLED, and I tried Ben and Jerry's for the first time.  I have been hooked and fatter ever since.  Now I love some ice cream and could eat it twice a day.  Ben and Jerrys ice cream is so good that I actually plan my meals around how I can have a serving during the day.  The better thing about it is that this high quality ice cream moderates itself.  It is really hard to overeat because the richness of the product does not allow your body to take it in in excess amounts.  I know that as I continue in my running program that I am beginning, I will probably cut down on the pint a week that I enjoy.  But I might just run a little farther and enjoy that sweet just a bit longer.    Finally, from these silly guys who stand for something and make food with natural ingredients and integrity, comes free cone day.  So, for those of you with a shop near by, go get a scoop and rock the vote with Ben and Jerry.  Ice Cream rules.              go    eat    free    ice     cream    for   a   good     cause

						      In a matter of a week my computer life has taken a radical turn.  Last week at this time I had a computer on the desk but nothing I could do with it since it did not come with microsoft office, (by the way, about being in the wrong business, it turns out that software is where its at.  $379 for a computer, $399 for the Word and Excel to run on it.  I vote for Linux and freeware), and I was not hooked up to the internet.  Now, just 7 days later, my laptop is back and at least functional and I have a new computer with a roadrunner (cable courtesy of my neighbors modem downstairs) hookup.  It really is as fast as those commercials say.  I am looking forward to the day when I can download music in a flash in the comfort of my own home.  Well, I better go now since my wife wants me to get dinner.  I didnt have this problem at Helios.  More to come my friend..  Happy Easter, Christ is risen indeed!

						      Four years ago, Natalie and I moved to a small house in Durham, NC so that I could begin my education at the Divinity School at Duke University.  Now, one year after most of my firends graduated, it is my turn.  The ceremony is May 8 at 6:30pm in Duke Chapel.  I would love for any and everyone to come that would like.  The house is already full, but housing arrangements can be made with our assistance.   Also of note is May 9 at 4pm in the sanctuary of Zebulon Baptist Church.  It is at this time and in this place that I am going to be ordained as a minister.  This is nerveracking and exciting.  The idea of having a weekend that centers on my is somewhat troubling.  Though I will recieve most of the attention, I am not typically the kind of guy who does stuff to put myself in this type of position.  For example, when I score my first NFL touchdown, I will definitely celebrate, but I will probably not be toting a sharpie in my sock.       I can just see my self now, (switching gears slightly), Thinking, "man, that was a hellofa sermon, and look 15 people have now decided that they are going to give their life to Jesus, (or else they are joining because it is WAY TOO expensive to get married at this church if you are not a member).  I knew singing  I Surrender ALL  would work great, the perfect of hell fire and brimstone with a touch of softness in the song. " After 13 verses, 5 professions of faith, 6 re-dedications, and a few prayers for pets, I say to the congregation: "Well church, it has been quite a morning.  In honor of my great morning, glory to God, I have decided to autograph my bible and hand it to the chairman of the deacons.  What a great day, come back next week for more of the word of God, and stay tuned to the newsletter for updates on the current contract renegotiations."  Well, that will never happen.  Of if it does, move away from me and buy a lottery ticket, cause somethings about to get stuck.  Thanks for enduring my musings and join us on the weekend of May 8 if you can. peace and love  ps. i listed some new music that everyone will say stincks becuase I listen to it and I went to ubc a long time ago. enjoy

						      Yesterday, I spent the best $126 that has been spent in my life in the last few months.  Yes, that's right, I finally got my laptop back.  It turned out to be a bad internal battery and then the guy broke the little tray it sits in, causing it to take a few extra days, but, now its back and I am happy. Considering I have about 50 pages of writing to put out in the next three weeks, this is a good thing.  So, I am going to blog about a few other things, and then go to work.

						   well, in 363 days someone else besides connU will have a chance to win the national championship.  My bets are blindly on the Blue Devils of course.  But, with the passing of one season comes new chapters in my blogging.  So, today, I would like to offer you a funny song lyric that I have stuck in my head.  It is from Kanye West's  College Dropout  and the song is called Slow Jams with Jamie Foxx and someone else.  Here is how it Goes: "she's got a light skinned friend looks like Michael Jackson/  she's got a dark skinned friend looks like Michael Jackson."  There you go.  Hopefully more blogging to come since the shop finally called and my laptop is finally repaired.  Woo Hoo!!

						   Today is another one of those days where we Duke fans just hang our head in sorrow and awe after handing the National Championship Game to the ConnU Huskies.  It was a game riddled with inconsistent play, inconsistent officiating, and the need for Duke to rise up once in the last 4 minutes of the game in order to gain the right to meet Georgia Tech.  Our dreams of an all ACC title game are gone, the hope of a second national championship in 4 years is gone too.  Today all we are left with is hope for next year.  Basketball season is only 6 months away.  Go Tech.

						   Natalie and I are off to New England for about 10 days.  Stops include boston, Cape Cod, Portland, ME, various places in Conneticut and Rhode Island, and New York City- not in 'New England' but on the way.  Maybe I'll blog if I have free internet somewhere and I am bored.  If not, Happy summer to you all and i'll be back soon. peace

						     This is the world we now live in.  I remember in the summer of 97 when premium was $.79/gal.  Those were the days... I wish I had a solution.  I wish all the stuff we are doing in the middle east would help it, but as a cynical 27yrold, I am afraid it will not help.  I am all about free market, but I want lower gas costs.  I wish I could do something to lower my demand but I cannot right now.  Maybe in the weeks and years to come.    I did something today.  I made an investment in this guitar. It is a 91 Chet Atkins that I have bought myself for graduation.  I didnt consult many people like I should have and I probably should not have bought it, but the musicians that I really like have played these. Dave Matthews has played them, and though they were highly modified from their original form, they were cool when he played them.  Travis Tritt of course had played one. And Besides Chet Atkins himself, Dave Crowder played one for a while.  I really wanted a crowdster, but could not justify the $2300 my local shop wanted for one right now.  So, my chet atkins may be named "fakie" or "fake Crowdster" but it is a step in the right direction.  My hope is that someday I will be a guitar playing wizzard that will bring joy to myself and others through the beauty of God's creativity with music.  peace to you all.  Eat more chicken.

						   I am sorry to you, the few who parouse the blogspot, that I have not blogged lately.  I have lots to say, but then feel overwhelmed about it when I think about it.  So quickly, here are a few things. I have a title, Reverend, thanks to Zebulon Baptist on May 9. I have been eating left overs since our families left last week. I am gonna buy new golf clubs but I am not sure what to buy, suggestions taken: We are celebrating our anniversary with a trip to New England in 10 days, suggestions for places to see are being taken as well: Fenway Park, Red Sox and A's, May 25 already planned. I just got my tix for Robert Earl Keen and Dave Matthews Band, July 26 in Raleigh, Love it or Hate it.  I love it, cant wait. Gonna Go, Natalie wants me to plan our trip with her so she is blowing a hot hair dryer at me periodically to try to hurry me up. Love ya, mean it. the rev aho

						     One place that has made its way to the top of my list of places to eat is PF Changs.  This place is great.  If you have never been there, you should go.  If you do not like Chinese cuisine, this is definitely the type of place you can learn to eat it.   We usually start with the chicken lettuce wraps.  Then, for dinner, I like the mongolian beef and Natalie likes the sweet and sour chicken.  The honey chicken is also good to me as well.  Once, we went with about six people and all ordered different dishes.  Everything we tried was great.  I have family members that say the only difference in PF Changs and other chinese restrauants is the presentation and price, but I calmly disagree.  I think the food is better.   You actually trade quantity for quality at changs, but it is totally worth.  This is a great place to go if you want to try some good food.  Changing Opinions   Another thing that has been going on lately in my life is the shift in my radio dial towards 91.5, WUNC, our local NPR station.  Being here on the east coast has opened my up to some ideas and opinions that are a little further left than I had thought before and it is possible that my recent radio habits reflect that. I do not think I am really left at all, rather, I like to think of myslef as being in the middle of all that I have going on, but nonetheless, if this is a label, I will accept it. Now, on to NPR.  The thing I have really begun to like about the station is that I learn stuff everytime I listen.  The stories are fascinating and creative in a way no other news is not.  Lots of the attention on our station is focused on Iraq right now, and though I understand and am completely sympathetic to the people who are directed to be over there, I get tired of hearing about it.  But the non-Iraq stuff is really great.  Last week they ran a story on an old recording studio in norhtern Alabama that is home to a bunch of famous songs by blues and funk artists, as well as the Rolling Stones.  Many think of these songs as coming from more famous places but this little studio is were they came from.  Not to mention, Click and Clack, the car talk guys, and i like all of the other stuff.  So, next time you are surfing your presets and all of the sports stations are on commercials, and all of the pop stations are stuck on the latest newleywed song, just tap on over to NPR and give it a listen.  It's educational ear candy.

						   I would just like to note that for the record I have not succumbed to the trend of fasionably bogging weekly or monthly.  Rather, I have wanted to blog by had no time really.  But I am about to get some pictures today and I am gonna try to use them here, and I really want to change the look of things around here as well.   Ok, well, I think I am gonna go run now.  see ya

						    Summer is the lazy season for lots of stuff, and for me that means blogging.&nbsp; I have not blogged much, therefore you have not read much and no one has commented either.&nbsp; But, I would like to point you to a new little blog project I have going.&nbsp; At  urlLink www.zbcyouth.blogspot.com  I have begun a blog for our youth mission trip to florida this week.&nbsp; I encourage you to check it out, I think it looks nice in a blog template sort of way.&nbsp; It also underscores the need for me to either 1. re-do my blog so it looks better 2. write better stuff that is worth reading or 3. just quit now while it is still fun.&nbsp; I will probably procrastinate throughout the process but 1 or 2 is most likely.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  So, here are your instructions:&nbsp; Go to the new blog, leave a nice comment for one of my youth, and pray for us as we are in florida doing fun stuff but working our little (and big) tails off in the subtropical heat of south- south Florida.&nbsp;  &nbsp;

						    As everyone knows by now, the crisis of Coach K leaving has passed and we can now safely look forward to another great season of Duke Basketball.  This is not a predictino becuase it will probably be a rough year, but I do not want to be the one to underestimate the boys.  Just like Dickie V, they will be number one on my pre season rankings and you could give me a bracket now and I could find reason to have them win the championship game at the end of the NCAA tournament.  I just  urlLink  Lead With the Heart  , I can't treat this basketball any other way.  See ya

						     Though there has been plenty of things going on in my life lately, I have not been able to find the energy and ideas needed to write here.  That said, there may not be anyone reading this, but I write anyway.   Certainly, the latest news from Duke is nerve-racking.  There are few things that are truly sacred to Dukies: Duke Chapel, Cameron Indoor Stadium, and Coach K round out the short list. Just the thought of K roaming the sidelines of the Staples Center on a regular basis is downright repulsive.  It is even more depressing to think about the parties going on in Chapel Hill.  This is great news for them, and horrible news for us. Clearly this is a conspiracy on the part of Tarheel nation beyond the front of the Los Angles Lakers. You see, K getting hired by the Lakers does some great things for the Tarheels.  First, and most obviously, it gets the nemesis out of the way.  With no K, they don't have to worry about getting beat by the smart kids anymore.  Secondly, K is not only cast away from the ACC, he is cast away from the beautiful east coast, leaving Roy as the cool hip 50 something coach.  Third, and most importantly, the Dean's record for the most wins in college basketball history maintains in tact, preventing K from becoming, beyond argument, a better coach than Dean Smith (ps. I have the utmost respect for Dean, it is just his followers I am not too crazy about).   Therefore, I have come to believe that one of two things are going on.  The first, and most likely possibility is that the Tarheels, (Mitch Kupchak's alma mater), have made a deal with the devil, (not the blue "devil" that we claim as a mascot, I mean the accuser, the real one, with the spooky face from Mel Gibson's film), and they are selling their collective souls in order to get rid of K to have a better chance and winning an ACC title.  I am not sure what the second possibility is, but it could have something to do with JJ Reddick dodging the weed smoking thing a year ago.  Either way, I don't want to limit myself to one possibility. It is my sincere hope and prayer that Coach K does not leave Duke for the NBA.  I think he should do the gracious thing and help the un-employed.  You see, by saying no to the Lakers, he allows them to hire another coach who is not currently working like Rudy T.  Then, the un-employment rate goes down, the economy improves, Duke kids make more money in the long run, and everyone is happy except for the Tarheels, just the way we like it.   Do the right thing Coach, we want Johnny Dawkins, just not yet... Grace and Peace A praying Duke Grad  ps. one last thing.  If K does leave, Duke should be allowed to wear the Black uniforms all year, and they should be the only NCAA team allowed to wear black.   And, why can't the Lakers hire someone like Bob Huggins, he fits in much better.

						   it is a beautiful day here in Raleigh, NC and the fact that I am taking 5 minutes to write instead of enjoying the ride home strikes me as a bit obsurd, but here I am anyway.  I plan on enjoying the day in the Jeep, one of the dozen or so days the good Lord enitles us jeep owners to each year.  I also have been having lots of thoughts about writing now that I don't have to for a grade, yet each time I get to my blog interface, I just blank in favor of a quick laugh.  Sorry about that. I would like to point you to a new video game that I am playing.  Brother Jeff sent me a copy of NCAA 2005 from EA Sports, his employer.  While I am looking foward to Madden and a new Tiger Woods golf game even more, I do really like this football game.  If you are looking for a fun game this could be it.  It is at least worth a rental and trying your hand at building a dynasty out of one of your favorite schools like Duke, Baylor, North Texas, or Michigan Tech.  I am currently working on the first two but have dreams of a BCS championship to a small two directional school.  Peace...

						   Well, for me, the summer is coming to an end.  The youth are starting school on Tuesday (August 10) and that means I get to have a little bit of rest. In years past, this meant about a week becuase I was starting school at the end of the month, but as a recent graduate, the only thing I have to look forward to with the beginning of a new school year is the expiration of my health insurance and parking pass.  Now I really have to pay if I need to go to campus. The summer brought lots of travel and it was great.  I covered just about every mile of Interstate 95 from the driver's seat.  I didn't get north beyond Portland Maine, but I did get to Key Largo which is about 40 miles south of the end of 95.  This also means I have been to and through every state on the eastern seaboard with the small exception being Vermont.  I didn't get there but I am looking forward to the day I can go and visit Ben and Jerry's Ice Cream Place.  I also got to Birmingham, AL and Ridgecrest, NC.  The Fall holds possibilities for trips to South Carolina, Virginia, and Texas.  We shall soon see.  You hopefully have also noticed the change in scenery.  I am somewhat happy with the new template, but really just happy to be out of the old.  I hope to post more often and more substantially.  I wish happy reading and writing for you.  Grace and Peace
