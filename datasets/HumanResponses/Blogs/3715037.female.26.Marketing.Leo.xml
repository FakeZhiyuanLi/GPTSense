      This week's newsletter is going to be a little different. It's going to be all commentary. The reason why is there are a ton of things that I want to tell you about that will really help you with your businesses, your writing, and traffic generation.   First, I want to talk about Ecademy. It's a new networking site that I have signed up for. It is ranked around 1700 on Alexa, making it a very high traffic site.   Now, let me explain how this site can help you.   You can post articles and a web log here. You can meet other people in your industry and join clubs. Right now, I am learning how to give online presentations to improve my  business, teach classes, give online seminars, etc.   Networking is the best way I know to find people to b*uy your products and services. It's also an excellent way to make contacts for joint ventures. The most valuable part of the membership here is that you can get can learn from people who are in all areas of business and industry, and it's absolutely fr*ee.   Here is the url:  urlLink http://www.ecademy.com?xref=51754    This will put you into the same network that I am in so that you can ask me questions. Please note that there is also no charge for this one either. I am also involved in  various clubs there, so if you want a recomm*endation, let me know. You also have several trusted networks there where you can get a lot of information.   Regardless of what country you are in, I would recommend you take a look. This site is very global and has people from all the over the world in all kinds of different  industries.   This is the one site that I would definitely recommend that you join to help you build your business.   ***********************************************************    AFFILIATE PROGRAM PROMOTION  Now, if you are looking to promote several affliate programs all at one ti*me, the best  way to do this is to join Affiliate Options. This site of*fers 6 different programs that you can promote, and you can also add your o*wn. If you have an affiliate program, you can also add it to the directory. It's fr*ee to join, and a great way for you to make some extra money. The best thing is that every site is different because every affiliate's choice of programs is different.   You'll find it here:   urlLink http://www.affiliateoptions.com/index.cfm?u=13207   ***********************************************************    MY AFFILIATE PROGRAM   I just redid the affiliate program for all my sites and have consolidated them all under one program now. Now affiliates can sell everything I offer.   If you are looking for products to promote, I pay 50 percent commissions. I offer both Cl*ickBank and Pay Pal and pay twice a month.   You'll find more information here:   urlLink http://www.smallbusinesshowto.com/affiliate-program.html   ***********************************************************    RECOMMENDED   I talked to Allan Shepley at Total Resale Rights. I worked out a deal with him to get you all of the products you need for your business. There are literally hundreds of products available for you to sell, to use for your business, and to help you gain the knowledge you need for your business.   There are actually nine packages in the collection. You'll get ebooks on auctions, affiliate mark*eting, email mark*eting, mark*eting in general. Then you'll find every  kind of tool, script, and software to help you build web sites. You'll also find some of the best of submission software like Ezine Blaster and Pay Lock Pro. You'll find  just about any kind of tool you could possibly imagine in this package to help you build and market, and it's only $24.95.   You'll find it here:    urlLink http://www.totalresalerights.com/kmaorder.ht   I have also arranged for Killer Mark*eting Arsenal to become part of Diane Hughes's site Net Profit Secrets.   What does this mean for all of you? It means that now you can get 4 memberships for the price of one. You not only get membership in Net Profit Secrets, but you also have access to Info Product Lab, eBook Reseller Kit, and my site. That's 4 memberships for the price of one. Thousands of dollars in software, tools, and informmation plus you have access to some of the best marketig experts out there. You can't beat the prices. It's $14 per mo*nth.   You'll find it here:   urlLink http://www.netprofitsecrets.com/nps/jjarrett    ***********************************************************    RSS FEEDS  There's a new trend on the horizon that will not only help raise your search en*gine rankings, but it will also help you to make it more easy to distribute your newsletters, blogs and site content.   I'll be distributing the newsletters, as well as my blogs this way from now on. I have found an easy way for you to either read my newsletters and blogs online, or you can download the software to do it. Best of all, it's all f*ree.   You'll find information on what RSS feeds you need to load into your RSS reader here:   urlLink http://www.killermarketingarsenal.com/syndicate.html   You'll also find the fr*ee RSS reader I recommend, as well as a link to a list of fr*ee RSS readers you can download.   If you are interested in doing your o*wn blogs and syndicating, I recommend Blogger.com, http://www.blogger.com They offer an RSS feed, it's easy to set up, and you really don't have to know HTML. This is what I am using because I really don't want to have to deal with installing any more scripts on my site. They have some  pretty nice templates you can choose from, and Blogger is ranked in the Top 1000 sites online, giving you a lot of opp*ortunity to get a lot of exposure without having to spend any money.   Finally, here is another tool I recommend. This is a great way to get a lot of exposure for your newsletter if you use RSS.   Tool Button -   urlLink http://www.toolbutton.com/toolbutton/download.aspx -For all you bloggers out there that have an RSS feed, this is the site to be listed on. For those of you looking for great sites or blogs to read, this is the place to go. It's fr*ee!   Below are some emails I recently received, as well as some resources I have found that I think will help you.   ***********************************************************   RESOURCES  Webmaster-Affiliates.net  urlLink http://www.webmaster-affiliates.net  - Visit Webmaster-Affiliates.net to find the best affiliate programs and networks for your website. Featuring in-depth affiliate program reviews, articles, affiliate program discussion, a programs dictionary, and our unique set of webmaster tools.

The owner, Jude Wright, teaches affiliate mark*eting. He discusses what mark*eting methods work and which ones don't. Definitely worth a look.

Fr*ee Resale Rights Club -   urlLink http://www.freeresalerightsvault.com/in/jjarrett.html   - Offered by Mark Hendricks and Michael Nicholas, this is absolutely an unbelievable site. I can't believe that he's offering all of this stuff for fr*ee, but they are. You get over 40 products you can either resale or give away.   Banana Cash Book -   urlLink http://www.banana.ch/banana4/eng/bc4_download.shtml  - Nice fr*ee utility you can use to do single entry accounting and keep your business books.   ***********************************************************   Hi Jinger,   Jim Edwards here with a traffic update report!   I've just published a really cool and unique fr*ee report for  you :-)   As an ebook author, online business owner, and affiliate  marketer, this report will reveal a *proven* technique I  use to get thousands of people to my websites each month...  and I don't pay a cent in advertising costs!

Without Spending A Dime On Advertising"   http://www.turnwordsintotraffic.com/cgi-bin/a.cgi?jjarrett  -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-  ************************************************************ ARTICLES AND REVIEWS ************************************************************  Get your name and message in the media by George Torok  When the media talks about you - that builds credibility, image and respect. Whether you call this promotion, public relations or publicity, remember two important points; 1. It is free. Well nothing is free - you pay in time and effort. 2. We believe more what others say about you. This is doubly so when the media talks about you. Follow this five step proven process to get your name and message in the media.   1. Target the media where you want to be seen Of the three forms of traditional media print is the best. Clients might not have seen you on TV or heard you on radio. But when you are in print you can send them a photocopy.   Be seen in the publications read by your prospects and clients. Ask your clients what they read or check the magazines in their lobby. Appearing in the national dailies may feel glamourous but does that help your business.? All publicity helps but focus your time and effort on where you get the biggest impact. That could be a community paper, association newsletter or an industry trade magazine. For example if you sell to hair dressers you should appear in "Hair Today".   2. Build a Database Start recording contact information about editors and reporters for the publications in which you might appear. Watch for publications that might be able to use your expertise. Pick up a copy and read it. Search for articles on your industry or area of expertise. Take note of writers whose style you enjoy. If you like their style it is because you are like them or would like to be. There is a good chance that they will also like you, so start with them.   3. Make contact First contact; shall we dance? There is no right way but some work better than others. These worked best for me; call, introduce yourself and offer an article or interview, send a note of congratulations on an article they wrote or mail a post card from an exotic location, (sign your name clearly).   It may take a while to build rapport. The media are just like customers. They are skeptical. Be persistent and consistent to be remembered. Be patient and realize that free media exposure is a long term plan. I appeared on a TV station after two years of contact and follow-up. The director finally stated. "George, your timing is impeccable, we need someone like you." Now I ask you, "Why did it take two years for my timing to be impeccable?" If I had given up after 18 months I could have believed that it doesn't work. It does - you just never know how long it will take.   Treat the media like hot prospects. Once you've made first contact never let them forget about you. Be in contact every two to three months. Call them, send them an article you wrote, call them, send a post card, ask to meet for lunch or coffee, send a news release, call, send a note about one of their articles, â€¦..   The cycle is unending - until they or you go out of business. Don't waste time. Keep your calls brief and to the point. Sometimes call when they are not there just to leave a short message on their voice mail. They must remember you when they need you, (George your timing is impeccable). Use a computer database to help track your contacts and remind you when to make next contact.   4. You appear in print You desire most to have them quote you as the expert or talk about your growing business. But, first they must believe you are the expert. And once they call you the expert you can quote them as having called you the expert. It is a circular argument but it works because perception is reality.   Your second choice, write an article for publication. This must be informative and not advertising. Ask the publication for guidelines - word count and style. The simplest article to write is a tips list; the five myths of your business, the seven secrets of shopping for.., the 10 tips to getting value from yourâ€¦ Both editors and readers like tips lists.   The third way to get your name in the media is by writing a letter to the editor. Based on your expertise you agree with a previous article, disagree, or supplement.   Whenever you appear in print send photocopies to your clients, prospects and media contacts so they begin to see you as the expert. The more publicity you get the easier it is to get more. It's like money.   5. Follow-up After you appear in a publication send the editor or reporter a personal thank you note, then go back to step 1, do not pass go, do not collect $200. Start all over again - and laugh at those who exclaim, "You are so lucky".

Marketers join traffic exchanges with the idea of selling their products, and yet they hardly see any traffic to their sites. It can seem like such a waste of time. However, with a few tweaks, you can see more traffic to your sites.  Traffic exchanges, although free, can be a very effective means of promoting your site, especially considering that so many of them are ranked in the top 10,000 on Alexa. That means they are very high traffic sites. This can definitely work to your advantage.  Here are some things I recommend you do to make traffic exchanges work more effectively for you.  1. Make your offer different. Are you promoting the same thing everyone else is? I see the same thing over and over on the exchanges. Although this is a great way to spot the latest Internet sales trends, it isn't a great way to get traffic and sales.  It's ok to promote the same thing that everyone else is; however, I would suggest that you alter your offer a little slightly. Offer a little more than everyone else who is a part of the same opportunity you are in, which leads to my next tip.  2. Give away something free. This could be a free ebook, report, or newsletter. If you don't feel you can write a report or ebook, find a good quality ebook in your field and give it away.  You can find plenty of free ebooks and reports here:   http://www.ebookdirectory.com   http://www.ebookdirectory.comhttp://www.ebookpalace.com   http://www.jogena.com   3. Get contact information. Seldom do potential customers ever buy unless they are truly looking for what you are selling. Credibility is a big issue on the Internet. If you want to sell your products and services to these potential customers, you need to capture their contact information so that you can contact them again with your offer. Build a relationship and then make the sale.  To get contact information, try this:   Create a lead capture page with your offer on it. This should include your subscription box, the details of your offer, and if possible, an ebook or report graphic. You are more likely to get sign ups if you have a nice graphic image of what you are giving away on your page.  Write a compelling headline that will make your your potential customer want to read the rest of your page.  Spell out the benefits of your offer. Show how you are different and why your potential customer would want to accept the offer.  Then you should load this page into your startpage exchange. Make sure you don't have any popups as part of the page, or anything else that would distract from your offer.  4. Join a good exchange. There are tons of exchanges out there you can join. Some are better than others. Compare your exchanges to find the ones that work the best for you.  Here are several that I have found to be the most helpful:   http://www.traffichoopla.com   http://www.traffichoopla.comhttp://www.trafficswarm.com   http://www.milliondollartraffic.com   http://www.Dont-Touch-My-Ads.com   http://www.AdvertisingKnowHow.com   Traffic Hoopla and Traffic Swarm are actual startpages. Traffic Hoopla also offers its list of top safelists they have tested and found to be the most effective. In fact, all of the traffic exchange and safelist programs Traffic Hoopla uses have been tested and chosen to be the most effective.  Traffic Swarm is excellent if you want to rack up a lot of credits quickly, as well as get your offer seen. It also uses text ads, and you get a credit each time you open your browser. These credits will also add up quickly.  Million Dollar Traffic and Don't Touch My Ads are software applications. You download and set up the software, and at timed intervals, you get a pop up on your desktop. Very simple and easy to use, and neither application ties up your browser start page, so you can run them as well as the startpage exchanges.  Advertising Know How gives you some great choices. You can post articles, capture leads to build your list, or promote the traffic exchange. It's one of my favorite places to post articles because it's a very high traffic site.  5. Build your downline Once you start capturing leads, then it's time to start promoting your favorite traffic exchanges to your list. Rather than sending an email sales letter, I recommend that you send an endorsement/review.   An endorsement/review is basically telling your potential customer how the program helped you, some of the benefits of the program, and what you like about it. The most important thing you want to tell your potential customer is how the exchange will help him/her. Be clear and give as many details as possible. Be sincere. This is your first step in building a relationship with your potential customer.  Try these changes to your traffic exchanges and you'll see an improvement in your traffic and sales.  **************************************************************** Jinger Jarrett is a former military journalist and newspaper reporter.
