      Updated the  urlLink online store  with more products. Now featuring band geek buttons, bio god/goddess T-shirts, and one of those stupid dog shirts dog owners seem to love so much. I am fervently hoping someone takes an interest in at least something in that store, because now that I'm out of work I'll need the money. If all else fails I could always sell pencils in front of 7-Eleven...

      Because I have an awesome new store on CafePress, that's why! Come check out my  urlLink incredibly insulting T-shirt collection ! They're all the rage these days, and these are reasonably priced (unlike the ones in certain stores). Come on, buy my stuff and help get me through college! More junk to come!  Oh, and in case you were wondering, Nina Saxophina is a nickname of mine. So if you see it in the title of my store, don't leave thinking I gave you the wrong link.

      Hmmmm, can't sleep. Well, I probably could, but I don't particularly feel like it. I'll actually be able to sleep in for once tomorrow, though, so it's okay.  Not long after I made my first post, my mom and I had one of our long talks. We hadn't had one of those in years, and I think we both needed it. We discussed life, love, and all those other complicated but necessary things. I told her about all the problems I've been having with my friends, and my concerns for the future, and basically just got a lot of things off my chest. It helped a lot, though I'm eventually going to have to actually solve my problems. It's a difficult time for all of us, this.  I uploaded one of the few nice pictures of myself for my profile from my Angelfire page, but this stupid "Image Hosted by Angelfire" thing popped up instead. So that explains the sunflowers. But while I love sunflowers, I'm going to try to download that stupid Hello Bot or whatever the heck it is thing from the site, so I can actually put up a relevant profile pic. So like, yeah.  I was thinking about life and stuff earlier when it occurred to me that the whole definition of counter-culturalism has completely changed since it was first introduced. 30 years ago, the definition of a "rebel" in this country usually meant someone who lead a counter-cultural lifestyle, ditching the values of old and indulging in activities that were at the time frowned upon. Thus resulted a general acceptance of such things as premarital sex, smut in the media, promiscuity, disregard for authority, etc. Now, however, since these things are so widespread and generally accepted throughout our society, engaging in them has ceased to be counter-cultural. Now, if you want to be a rebel, you have to go against what popular culture tells you, and actually lead a moral lifestyle. Ah, and the wheel goes 'round and 'round.  I should never write this late (or early, whichever way you look at it). I tend to get overly philosophical.  Today's word is:  Thaumaturgy      thau·ma·tur·gy  n.   1. The working of miracles or magic feats.

             HOLY CRAP, BATMAN!!!   Wow, a brand-new blog all to myself. How many times does one get to start a new blog in their lifetime? About 5 or 6 if you're anything like me.  Hmm, a little about me. Not much to say, really. I live in Carson, California, I'm female, White, single, and turning 18 next Sunday ;) . I have brown hair and play the glockenspiel (which isn't as nerdy as the name sounds), and I love jazz music and old-school rock. Right now I'm eating a chicken and fettuccine alfredo TV dinner. That's about it, I think.  I should probably send out a big hearty THANK YOU to Dusty Scott, the criminally attractive and witty author of Pork Tornado and Salami Tsunami, for giving me this whole new blogging opportunity and for bringing me out of a massive pity-party. This is how it happened, Dusty: I was having an unbearably crappy day today. I had horrible nightmares last night, and actually woke up with a knot in my stomach this morning, which I thought was impossible. It was my last day of work today, and while I didn't like the job very much, the $10 an hour was great, so having to quit depressed me. I also found out that my "friends" went off to Magic Mountain without even saying anything to me. My mom has been going through some sort of emotional crisis lately, is depressed most of the time, and cries at the drop of a hat. She also doesn't get a paycheck in August (being a teacher and all), so money is very, very tight. All that, coupled with the fact that the kitchen faucet broke and I have to wash the dishes in the bathroom, amounted to making my day one massive suck.  Then I read your Atlanta Journal blog about the crazy things you do in the office, Dusty, and laughed 'till I cried. It was the first big laugh I'd had in almost a month. I went to post a comment thanking you, but found I had to sign up if I didn't want to post anonymously. This blog is a result of that. Thank you so much, Dusty. You're my hero. I'd send you cookies, but you'd probably prefer cash, and I don't love you *that* much. ;)  Moving on...    ATTENTION ALL NON-FILIPINO GIRLS WHO ARE ATTRACTED TO FILIPINO GUYS:    Go out and buy a Filipino Club T-Shirt. Right now.  Being out of other clean shirts this morning, I wore my high school Filipino club T-shirt to work and was too lazy to do laundry when I got home. (Mind you, I'm not Filipino. I was conned into joining the club by my friends [the club consisted of seven Mexicans, one Chinese girl, me, and three actual Filipinos] and ended up loving it.) Later, I went to Albertson's with my dad to get something for dinner, and while I was there THREE cute Filipino guys asked me about my shirt. They were all impressed that I know how to dance the Tinikling, and I had very nice conversations with each of them. Now, I'm not particularly attracted to Filipino dudes, but it got me thinking that that could be a great market to corner. A Filipino girl wearing a Filipino shirt is nothing out of the ordinary, but a White girl (or any other non-Filipino girl) wearing one attracts attention. 'Why is she wearing that?' people wonder. It's a great conversation starter, and could be used as an ice-breaker at parties. Not only could you get hit on, but people will think you're culturally-sensitive. I might just start making T-shirts.  I have more stupid stuff to talk about, but this post is too long as it is. I'll save some material for tomorrow. It would be funny if someone actually *read* one of my blogs for once.  Today's word is:  Dilettante   dil·et·tante  n. pl. dil·et·tantes, also dil·et·tan·ti  1. A dabbler in an art or a field of knowledge.  (see amateur)  2. A lover of the fine arts; a connoisseur.   adj.  1. Superficial; amateurish.
