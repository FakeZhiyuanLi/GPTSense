      It seems that these days more and more people who are in the minority are getting their way while those of us in the majority stand by, watch, and complain.&nbsp;   I am a conservative. I believe that most Americans are conservatives as well. Our founding fathers were conservatives. Most of us are not in favor of &nbsp;same sex marriage, abortion, legalization of marijuana,&nbsp;stem cell research, and countless other items on the liberal agenda.  The problem is that the squeaky wheels will get greased. Whoever makes the most noise will be pacified by those in Washington. What can we do about it?   I say we raise hell. Let the guys in Washington know where we stand. We need to hit the streets and quit worrying about being politically correct. We need to let all the people who hit the streets waving their rainbow banners and burning the American flag and bad mouthing America have a taste of what real Americans think of them. I'm tired of hearing these groups abuse America and all of its great institutions without anyone giving the opposite opinion.   If our country is to return to its greatness we need to put an end to these types of uprisings and let those leftist crawl back under their rocks and be ashamed of themselves again!!!!

      I hope that you find this to be a fun way to post ideas and speak your mind. I know that if anybody can make the most of this, you will. I hope to see you post things on this site often. Who knows maybe we can get some good responses and make a difference in our world. Good luck. I love you.

      This is the beginning of something that may get out of control. We'll see what comes of it. In the future I will be adding all kinds of ideas that I come up with from day to day.   I hope to have my wife and kids contribute as well.   I feel like this may be a launch pad for my creativity and wild ideas. It will be a place for me to voice my opinions for all or some or at least more to hear...or read actually.  Away we go.....

      I am so tired of being politically correct. Why can't I tell the black chick at Popeye's that I don't want to hear the best of BET while I'm eating my chicken and biscuit? Political correctness. Why can't I tell the guy at the next gas pump to turn down his 10,000,0000,000 watt stereo so i can ask my kid if he wants an orange drink or a sprite? Political correctness. Why can't I tell the guy behind the counter at the convenience store that I don't like the way he looks at me? Political correctness. You can't tell anyone that their kids are fucked up. You can't tell people who talk too loud in restaurants to hold it down. You can't tell co-workers to be cool with the images they use for wallpaper, and yes it is wallpaper not a fucking screen saver. You can't say shit to anyone anymore!  WHEN ARE THESE PEOPLE GOING TO BE CORRECT TOWARDS THE REST OF US.  The "politically correct" thing has just become an excuse for the assholes of the world to act however they want. They can do what ever they want and nobody will say anything to them because they are black, or hispanic, or oriental, or white, or fat, or gay, or middle eastern, or a woman, or a lesbian, or a Jew, or a kid. I am myself Hispanic and would prefer it if somebody let me know if I am making them feel uncomfortable for whatever reason.  At this rate I'm going to run for President of the United States of America. My running mate is going to be a black, Vietnamese, Jew, lesbian. The way I look at it we will win all the debates. Everyone will be so afraid of being called prejudice that we will be able to say what ever the hell we want!!
