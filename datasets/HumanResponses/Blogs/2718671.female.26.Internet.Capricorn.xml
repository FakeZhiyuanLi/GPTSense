      Well I just got home after a full day out in the city...    AND IT WAS GREAT!    The yoga class a T's gym as excellent, I liked the instructor and he definitely helped me in my form (I was as bad as I though, but I definitely lack upper body strength).   I am definitely going to continue with yoga. After the class, we went and got some Tasti DLite (New York, Seinfeld, or SITC!) fat free frozen yogurt.  It was a beauiful day and we decided to stay outside.  I haven't really gone ALL over the city...so T took me to SoHo, Chelsea, around Bleecker, and the Village.   My mom sent me some recipes and a large chart of common foods with their calorie, fat, and carb contents...very interesting...so on the way home, stopped by a veg stand and got some grapes, plums, and cilantro...I didn't know an apple had over 40 grams of total carbs...raisins have over 32 g.  That's crazy!  So I decided to get some better fruit choices. Well tomorrow is Father's Day...I'm about to soak some cod for dinner, do some yoga, and go to the gym for some strength training.. *~Besos*~

      I have read (and my friends and mom have told me) its good to keep a journal while on a diet/exercise program.   However, I am WAY too computer dependent for that.   So I decided to have this blog serve as my journal.  It may be more difficult for me to slack of if I'm publishing my progress all over the internet.  Plus I think I'm going to send my mom the link (all my family is back in New England), knowing her she'd get a kick out of it.  Besides, maybe I can help just one person like my friends and mom helped me....I also have a tendency to start things then stop..So maybe this blog will help me grow in a couple of different ways :)  It's now Friday, 6/18, I just came back form the gym.  I actually did 30 minutes of cardio (YES I'M SHOCKED) and got in a little work on my triceps and abs before the gym closed.  In addition, I walked to the gym and back.   THIS IS BIG FOR ME.   Normally I go to the gym str8 from work, so I only walk home.  But every extra step is helping me shed this damn weight.  Even though I'm doing all this (it snow been a little over a week), I kept thinking about my center.  I have not felt this good in years, but I kept feeling like something's missing.  I've also gone walking ( at a fast pace) in my neighborhood, walking to [places I used to drive to thinking they were father than they actually are.  My goal is to get to the gym Mon, Wed, Fri, and Sunday morning...and try to walk after dinner on Tues and Thursday.  After reading a lot of books and info, I'm not so picky about what days I go...as long as I get my ass there  (MESSAGE).   I remember a few weeks back I was in Borders (bookstore) near my job (right near WTC) and I saw a Yoga/Pilates book on the clearance table (shoot it was only $5.99) and I started to read it.  I talked to T and K about it, plus a few other folks, and yoga was starting to sound interesting.  So I came home form work one day and decided to search the great WWW ( I'm am such a Google-er ).  Once I came across Hatha yoga, the thought struck me like a thunderbolt.  I needed something for myself...Something to bring a little peace into my life...whether its work, home, or family, the past 4 years have been the most difficult of my life.  For the longest time I have felt everyone I know and love somehow drain the life out of me.  I was lethargic, cranky (OK OK, BITCHY), and just generally unhappy...But I blamed everyone and everything but me.  Plus I used to dance and I would LOVE to get my flexibility back.  Yoga seemed like a two-fold answer to my prayers.  Over the past week, I have bought cross training gloves, a yoga kit (Nike, I just love it) and a gym bag that's actually a yoga messenger bag with a mat holder.     AND IT GETS EVEN BETTER ...the yoga kit and bag were on  SALE!  .  I also went back to Borders and bought that book, and starting practicing basic asanas, along with some pilates streches, in the morning before I go to work.  I cannot begin to tell you not only how good I felt, but how alert, awake, and cheerful I was at 9 in the morning (anyone who knows me KNOWS this is nothing short of a miracle).    Tomorrow is Saturday, and I am going to a yoga class with T at her gym.  I figured why keep practicing at home if I'm not doing it correctly.  Then back to the gym Sunday morning (it SO nice and quiet there at that time) where I'm going to work on a little cardio, but mostly arms and abs.  I still haven't perfected a routine yet because it is so damn DIFFICULT to get a circuit training machine, much less as weight, at Bally's after work, but I'm trying to get one down by next week.  I'm also going to weight myself on Sunday, since I weighted myself there last week with T (I do not own a scale in my home). I'm also going to pick up a tape measure to tracking my progress.  And believe it or not, I actually registered for the  urlLink President's Challenge  and log my activity daily (steps, cardio, circuit, walking, yoga, etc. etc)  Ok well now that I have FINALLY caught up to date... I'm going to take a shower and get ready for the morning.  I cannot stress how HAPPY I am now compared to before.  It's now almost midnight and I'm up here playing music and dancing around....AND I JUST CAME BACK FROM THE GYM!!!!!....Believe me guys, thass a big deal.  I have to say the best thing about all of this....is the sense of calmness and fuffillment I now have.   I now have things to do and not staying home & stuff my face.  I'm starting to be active.....   It may not be much to some of you, but it sure as hell means a lot to me.     Until tomorrow.. PEACE!

      Ok so I went on Wednesday, June 9, I decided to go to McDonald's for lunch and get that Active Meal with the pedometer.  Might as well walk for exercise...and the booklet and website gave me so much info...I was stating to think.... For my 1st session...and Nathaniel KICKED my ass! I haven't been to a gym since 1993/1994...back in high school when I was playing basketball...and this guy had me doing all sorts of squats and lunges and even boxing...I made it through the hour, much to my surprise.  Since that time I've been going to the gym 3-4 times a week.  Before I left, I was doing upward pelvic thrust with a balance ball under my heels and Nathaniel said I'm not centered and should find my core.  That DEFINITELY made me think on a couple different levels.  ~~~~~~Some Background~~~~~~~~ I met my husband on AOL back in 1999. At that time, I weighted around 145 Lbs.  Once I moved to NY and we started living together, I started cooking A LOT of Spanish food (my hub is Dominican).  Pretty soon all that rice and beans went str8 to my ass.  I was wearing size 6...now I'm in 12/14. My parents are chronic dieters...so I have been in Weight Watchers, Jenny Craig, and The Diet Center...and this was during high school.  I grew up on margarine, miracle whip, and skim milk.  My mom just has a healthy lifestyle and loves working out.  Plus she has been sick on and off since I was in fourth grade with a rare type of immune disease, so she tends to keep healthy for the right reason...her health.  My father, however, is a different story.  He is the epitome of bad eating habits.  This man will go to BJ's (similar to Costco) and buy a box of 30-summin bags of microwave popcorn...and just keep eating... and eating..... and eating..... and eating.....POPCORN. My father is the type that tell my mother (who just turned 50 and looks MUCH better than me) how she's fat...Only he does it CONSTANTLY.  I finally admitted to my mom the other day my father's behavior is probably the reason I am so ANTI-DIET.  My mother, however, is mostly been concerned with my health (we got everything in my family, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, cancer, diabetes).  ~~~~~~~~~~Present~~~~~~~~~~ Instead of dieting, I decide to change the way I eat.  Instead of egg, cheese, and sausage on roll w/ mayo 4 breakfast (yall New Yorkers know what I mean), I bought Special K with strawberries, bring a bag of it to work some mornings and buy a little carton of fat free milk.  No carbs after 8 PM, just fruit and vegetables.  Believe me, this is a BIG change... On Sunday, June 13, I brought T and K (another co-worker of mine who is REALLY into working out and strength training) to the gym with me.  I figured since it was the PR parade and half the Bronx would be in the city, it would be a good time to my friends walk me through a routine I can do on my own.  My own plan is to get back to 140-145 Lbs., get my flat stomach back (I swear I had one most of my life, ask my mom!) and lost and tone my flabby arms (yes they are big).  Based on that, my girls and I decided I would focus on cardio for now with some work on my arms to tone as I lose. Unlike most people, I'm not trying to lose weight to fit into an outfit, or because I have a special event (yanno 3 people at Bally's asked-or should I say TOLD- me this was the reason I was at the gym.     No...that's not the reason.   In all honesty, seeing my body fat in numbers shocked the hell out of me.  I couldn't get my mother's voice out of my head, telling me I need to lost weight because she was concerned.  I was not happy with myself.  I WILL NOT even get into how many pairs of jeans my fat ass thighs and made rip!  My hub also gained a lot of weight...and we both became very unhappy...finally eveything clicked. I decided to start going to the gym to change myself...and it doesn't matter how long it takes.     This is where the blog comes in.....

      Ok...where do I begin. It all started in the beginning of June.  My girl/co-worker T suggested we got our body fat checked out for free.   Like I wanted to do that shyt  So I did it and to NO surprise...I had a lot of fat. So I decided to finally do something about it.  I'm a member at Bally's, been paying for that shyt since last August.  They finally opened the gym near my house, so I decided to go and make an appointment with the PT (I made them give me 3 when I joined)

      Today was a beautiful day! After not going to the gym yesterday  (damn rain!) , I woke up today and was at the gym by 9AM!  I did 45 minutes of cardio by accident (I swear my MP3 player is dying...to the point I have to use a rubber band around it, I guess it has a short :( Hubby bought it for me for Xmas 2001) so I had to keep fiddling around with it to get it work.  I already went over 21 minutes out of 30, So while I was fiddling..I pressed some button and cleared by workout.  So I decided to set it for another 20 and keep going..I still can't believe I did that! Since the gym was still kinda dead, I hit the circuit training machines...abs and arms...for about 30 summin minutes.  I ran into Nathaniel and scheduled by  urlLink body test  for Monday...By that time it was almost 11...so I left to go......  SEE PATTI LABELLE......FOR FREE!!!!  You gotta love NY and  urlLink Summerstage .  Gates opened at 1:30 and Patti was scheduled for free...so I walked home, stopped by the market cuz we were out of fruit, got home, took a shower, and went to T's house to pick her up. After waiting in a long line that moved kinda quick, we got inside and copped a spot with my Mexican blankets (my grandmother got the whole family hooked on them...I bought 3 in Cozumel just for my house alone!) Needless to say...Ms. LaBelle was FIERCE!!!  I can't believe that woman turned 60 5/24...she sung old and new stuff....including LADY MARMALADE, ON MY OWN, AND OVER THE RAINBOW.  No word of a lie, she made me want to find a Baptist church with a strong choir 4real  (Mom, if you're reading this, please dont' remind me next time I talk to you...it was JUST A THOUGHT! And please dont' mention it to Nana becuase I dont' wanna hear it for the next 10 years)... Just thinking about her energy and spirit gives me chills!...She's DEFINITELY A STRONG BLACK WOMAN...OK. So that's all for now...I'm skipping the gym tomorrow cuz I'm going Monday...so I'm going to just veg out at home with hubby.  It seems like I'm hardly here anymore (YES!!!!!)   AU REVIOR *wink*

      Well today is Wednesday and I'm beat.  Went to the gym early this morning, haven't done any yoga (2morrow, no doubt).  My arms have been sore since Monday night, doing cardio hurt like a SOB. I'm going to a yoga class on Sunday...they are having a free community class on Sunday, so I'm going to go check it out that way.  On Saturday, Patti LaBelle is havign a free concert @  urlLink the park .  Well, there's a suggested donation, but we all know what that means. So I'm off to watch a movie...spend some time with the man on the couch...  Todos tiempo....

      I woke up late, so I didn't get a chance to do any yoga :-( However during my PT session, I told Nathaniel I was working my arms and abs yesterday...... so what does he have me do?? ??? This guy put my ass in the boxing ring, throwing str8 punches and squating, like I'm Mike Tyson.  Then he has me boxing and kicking in the ring, then on the bag Oh, its not over. Next I was working on abs with a balance ball and dyna-bands (yes yall, I'm in pain over here)...But it  FEELS  good. On Wednesday I'm going to the gym @ 6 am for a body test.  They're going to rate my metabolism, eating habits, work out endurance...blah blah blah.  I'm going to check out  urlLink Laughing Lotus  tomorrow on lunch, I'm thinking about taking a beginner's class there on Wednesday, since I'm not going back to the gym after waking up for 5 (Really not a morning person).  Laughing Lotus as a pretty good offer...$20 for 1 week of unlimited classes.  I like the vibe I'm feeling thus far, so I'm definitely going there tomorrow. BTW, Bill Clinton is coming to Borders on Wednesday...lawd I love Bubba!  When I ran into him in Harlem, he was so friendly...and charismatic. WHEW! lawdamercy  Well I'm off to the shower...PS I won't drown!

      Well this morning I got up and finally began my 1st asana routine.  Today I started with Sun Salutation and breathing for about 45 minutes.  I have a daily exercise chart and decided to alternate routines and breathing, after some research last night...I didn't even realize we were performing Sun Sal. in yoga class until I found the routine online.   At the gym (I walk there both ways on the weekends as a warm up/pedometer) I warmed up with some cardio and worked on my arms and abs.  On most machines I started off with 10 Lbs., plus 5-10 lbs. resistance. and worked my way up from there.  I used at least 20-30 Lbs. on abs, I guess I still got muscle under that fat.  After 1 1/2 hours, I did some yoga streches and really felt the difference in my abs and arms.  I'm drinking over 5 24oz bottles of water a day now. So I spent some time with hubby's family and talked to all of mine today...It was a nice day.  I can back home early to cook some cod and some chicken on the Foreman grill...trying out a recipe for marinade my mom gave me....I already made a salad for lunch tomorrow and I'm going to add some chicken to it. I also got a baggie of baby carrots, a plum, and some triscuits (I mistakenly bought reg instead of reduced fat, so its only 6 triscuits for a serving).  I also grabbed another bottle of Wishbone Just 2 grams dressing (ranch for home, Italian for work)...I think I'm finally getting the hang of this. At the gym I  "believe"  the scale said I lost 2 pounds (T weighed me last time)  However I am losing inches in my calves, arms and stomach ( I NEED TO GET THAT TAPE MEASURE ASAP )... Well I'm gonna finish cooking and get ready for tomorrow...PT session @ 7pm.  I'm Rick James, bitch!

      So I have Friday off, so I decided to take another yoga class at  urlLink LLYC .  For some reason Patty wasn't there.... urlLink Tovah  was.  Now I saw her picture on the web scheduler and was a little hesitant to take one of her classes....BUT I WAS SO WRONG! Tovah's class was wonderful.  We spent more than 20 minutes chanting.....then more during asanas...she was very spiritual and knowledgeable...with a grace and an air about her..simply positive. However her class was very nice, and she really stressed everyone's own level...you could go slower/faster...child's pose...I really enjoyed it. So its off to bed and tomorrow...the movies..  "Welcome to Moviefone!"

      ok....the body test....needless to say, I FAILED! Nah, just kidding.but I did fail several categories *getting the paperwork*.  Ok, in my defense, Nathaniel did not warn me that I SHOULD NOT work on my arms or abs right before the test. Ok with that said.let me explain the test.   1) I had to put a handheld device that measures resting metabolic rate (RMR in my mouth for 10 minutes.  I had my nosed blocked and could only breathe through my mouth. 2) Nathaniel and some sort of box wiht measurements on it, and I had to keep my legs together and straight and strech forward. 2) As many sit ups as I could do in one minutes  (needless to say I didn't do that much, my abs were killing me from Saturday)  3) I had to step up and down on a Step bench with 4 pods for 3 minutes, after which he took my pulse, plus a few other activities liek jumping jacks and stuff 4) Weighed me 5) Measured my body fat 6) Asked my goal weight, birthday, etc.  Based on that, these were my results:  Body Type: Type II Resting Metabolic Rate (RMR): 1390 Weight: 184 Body Fat: 70 lbs Lean Mass: 114 lbs Current Body Fat: 38% Weight Goal: Lose Weight Goal Weight: 145 lbs Goal Date: 11/11/04 Body Composition: Poor Cardiovascular Endurance: Above Average Flexibility: Poor Muscular Endurance: Below Average My Overall Assessment: Below Average Daily Caloric Intake Goal: 1084 Calories from Carbs: 705 (65%) Calories from Fat: 163 (15%) Calories from Protein: 217 (20%) Included: 7 day meal plan and grocery list  Ok, thass everything.  Basically your RMR is the rate your metabolism works when the body's at rest.  According to Bally's website :RMR represents between 60-75% of total metabolism in a healthy individual".  My body fat has gone done 2% since T made me get it done 3 weeks ago.  My flexibility was messed up becuase of the workout on Saturday, which Nathaniel even told me  (I swear on my cat me did ).  He asked me how many pounds I wanted to lose a week between 1-3 and I said 2, just to take the middle ground.  Based on 2 lbs a week, plus followign the meal plan and being moderately active, it would take me until 11/11 to lost all the weight.  I have showed several friends the meal plan and they all think it is reidiculous.  All my protien is at dinner, which I basically don't eat anymore.  Based on my gym and yoga  (wait 4 it)  schedule, I usualy make lunch my biggest meal wiht protien and just snak on fruit, cheese,  and sometimes triscuits (roasted garlic, 7 crackers a serving, only when its not too late) at night...I usualy get home after 9 on most weeknights, so their meal plan just is gonna work 4 me.  But I do plan to take some of their meals and incorporate it into what I've been doing. So.......that was Monday  (why am I using the word SO "so" much 2nite?) . Anywho....I went to  urlLink Laughing Lotus  (hereafter known as LLYC) for my 1st basic yoga class....hour and 1/2 (long)...and I feel great!  With the long weekend and being off Friday, I decided to take advantage of their special...unlimited yoga for 1 week.20$...they charge $15 a class, so how could I pass that up.  Pattu was an awesome teachers...very calm and serene...she helped me with my postures and corrected me many, many times....hour standing and 1/2 sitting.........we also chanted and even went up the wall! (wow that was interesting to see, and Patty did it so effortlessly and pretty...she just placed one foot on the wall, then the other, and looked liek an upside down L, then she put one leg stright up in the air will the other was still attached to the wall....is was  amazing ).  I'm definetly going to take her class again.  Well that's it..hubyy's home and we're going to watch the rest of Eurotrip...yanno I haven't stayed awake past 12 during the week since I started working out....let's see if I make it through the rest of the movie?  Not to change the subject...but isn't Bush just a jackass?  Let freedom reign...what kind of shyt is that?  Ok that's it, I'm done.  "You're a lemur...you're a lemur"

      Well today is Thursday and I'm an auntie...again! So far this week I have gone to the gym twice and took another Yoga class at LLYC.    AND I LOST ANOTHER 2 LBS.  Now I know I shouldn't have weighed myself considering it hasn't even been a week yet, but something was telling me to do it.. YESSSSSS!  So that's it for now, about to hit the showers.....

      Well I had a pretty good weekend.  To make up for the gym, I woke up early Saturday and went.  I did 45 minutes of cardio and 45 to an hour of circuit training.  I also decided it was time to start incorporating some leg exercises, so I also did 85/100Lbs on the Hip abduction.  For those who don't know, hip abduction is that machine where your thighs are apart and you bring then together.  Needless to say, my thighs are STILL hurting today (Monday). unfortunetly, my monthly friend came (hereafter know as DA BYTCH) on Saturday, so my 4th was shot.  I didn't even go anywhere, just stayed in the house all damn day :-(  Although the market was closed and I work on Wall St....I still had to go to work today.  The building was closed, so we had no A/C. After about 3 hours with 3 different fans on me, the president of my company stopped by to bring me and T the keys to his office.  By this time it's 12:30-ish and he says "Go Home @ 4 or whatever"...so we left EARLY. I was in the Bronx by 4:30 and at Bally's by 4:48.  I decided to switch up my cardio (T says I shouldn't be so repetitive, plus work other parts of my body) so today I did 15 minutes on the treadmill and 30 min. on the elliptical.  On opposite days, I will do the stair master for 15 instead.  I started working on abs and got over 100 reps but I GOT BAD BAD BADDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD CRAMPS (ask my mommy, I do). Well tomorrow its off to my last class of "unlimited" yoga...  "Lawd let me just get through the week." -Me, every Monday

      So Friday I took the day off.  Felt kinda sluggish, so I decided to skip the gym.  On Saturday, I walked/jogged on my treadmill at home for an hour  (yes I have a treadmill at home, so you're probably saying "Why doesn't she USE it more?" Well right now I can't use during the week because we live right above a real bytch who complains if we walk or watch TV, nevermind using the treadmill...so I decide to at least use it once a weekend if I take a day off from the gym) . So today is Sunday and I just got back from the gym.  I used the elliptical stairclimber/cross training machine for half an hour and my ass hurts.  Then I did some circuit training on biceps/triceps and abs for about an hour and came home.  Now that the OTHER bytch is gone, I want to make up a little for last week.   HOWEVER I DO HAVE AN ANNOUNCEMENT!   For some reason I got on the scale again, figuring when I got on Thursday it wasn't a full week..... AND I LOST MORE WEIGHT!   The scale said around 180.5 Lbs...which means I lost another pound and a half since Thursday.  I notice my eating habits yesterday and I definitely eat less than 1100 calories a day on weekends.  Based on the Bally's gym test, I decide to continue eating that amount of calories on the weekends and work out longer to burn even more calories...plus my water weight is probably coming off..So it makes sense.  Well I'm off to shower and watch some movies with hubby..  ~Besos~

       Well today I got my ass up and went to the gym....did cardio for for a half and then worked on my triceps...I finally came up with a new plan I need to work out...I want 2 do biceps one day, legs the next, then biceps (gives them time to rest), then start over....and do abs at home with yoga..sounds like a nice routine.   So something possessed me to get on the scale.... AND I LOST 1 1/2 POUNDS SINCE MONDAY!!!!    I don't know how I did it, but I DID *smiling very smuggly right about now*    &nbsp;   I'm gone....

        OK OK OK....I KNOW I'VE BEEN A BAD GIRL *HANGING HEAD IN SHAME*     For the past two weeks...I have barely been to the gym or to yoga....however I have continued with my eating habits...and happy to announce I have lost   2 MORE POUNDS!      However I went back to the gym on Monday and will do yoga tomorrow morning.&nbsp;  Honestly since I haven't been to the gym (the bytch took all my staminia), I really didn't have much to write.&nbsp; I'm still using the pedometer everyday I go out and trying to be more social and see the city....but this damn rain is driving me nuts.&nbsp; Every other day, it's raining and runing some plans...I wish Bally's would rent lockers, becuase right now I only have 1 pair of sneakers to work out in and I hate walking home....from the gym....with soaking wet sneakers!&nbsp; Ugggghhhh I hate that!     So for now I'm going to try to go to the gym in the monrings as well as some afternoons (I notice there's alot of kids there, with vacation and the gym's child care center)...so I figured if I wake up, and it's raining, go to the gym and get it done early so I can come str8 home from work and relax.    Well that's all for now.....     &nbsp;   "Do it...Do it Do it!!!!"    - from Starsky & Hutch     &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;

       I just got in the house from yoga and it was WONDERFUL.      Instead of my regular basics class, I took sunset rooftop yoga with the own of LLYC down near the Village.  It was so peaceful and calming, watching the bright red sun set while doing asanas I haven't  even  attempted yet!  The pace was faster than I expected, but I just went at my own pace and took child's pose if needed.        Otherwise its the same ole same ole....I'll holla a little later, going to take a shower.      God Bless Dave Chapelle and his $50 Million Dollar Contract...He's rich bytch!!!
