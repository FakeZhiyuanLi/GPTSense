       I guess this is an  outrageous  way to keep a journal but doesn't hurt rite?...&nbsp; EVeryday I go to school and the same thing happens.&nbsp; The kids stay so HYPER n I end up wif a major head pain!&nbsp; Do I take multivitamin s pescribed by a CL colleague?&nbsp;     &nbsp;  However, apart from that,... I&nbsp; was telling a close fren in school that I really do regret being too hard on my kids.&nbsp; No homeworks,  OUT  they go.&nbsp; Refuse to answer my interrogation,  OUT  they go.&nbsp; Jumping up and down in my class,  OUT  they go.&nbsp; He he... we are getting sadistic aren't we?   I really gotta change cos this attitude of mine s really draining even me out.&nbsp; Lucky for me, my kids - 35 of em, are ever so outrageously cute! They keep me fit, fun and fab!    &nbsp;  I miss my fiance.&nbsp; I can't wait to meet him tomorrow.&nbsp; I hope he fetches me from school.&nbsp; Oh by the way, oral exams for P6 so... well... duty calls...    &nbsp;  Hi to all bloggers... stay fit and strong my frens... its FRIDAY!!

       Isn't it funny how some people behave?  THe argumentative fools, the stuck up weirdos and everything else in between?   Glad that my frens are not one of them.      For the past two days, I've been too tired.  Yesterday I tried to return home early, but remembered that I had to apply for a new ATM.  I'm glad I did.  THe new POSB atm was so FAB!!  Blue colour without wave patterns! Like credit card like tat!! ;]  Action mah!  Credit card is so not in my league so have to settle for a normal ATM card!  I learnt Table Tennis for the second time yesterday! Fun fun fun!  But whenever it was my turn, the ping pong ball will always go WILD! Mr Zirk had to play catch with the itsy bitsy teeny weeny ball!  Such fun!  Mr Zirk has been so supportive and loving eversince the demise of my beloved Anna Sui.  Well some things can't be helped.   "Take this as a learning experience." said Sue and Mr Zirk.  Tears won't reverse what had happened.  Such a pity.  Now, if only I can muster up the courage to tell my mum about this!  She will absolutely FLIP! ... :'[  Well... today is FRIDAY! Another weekend awaiting!  Tomorrow PSLE oral again... then kickboxing session with the pupil trainers!.... I hope they won't torture us for long.... I need to get out and get some FRESH air.... Will be watching Alien vs Predatore....  Well... alls well that ends well.... Such a hectic fun week! ... Stay fit and fun always!  Gosh I feel so tired like want to collapse today!!

       A painful lesson.... That's wat I learnt on the 16 August 2004. I've just lost my wallet in bus 189. I guess I was careless. I left the bus without tapping my EZ link card thinking tat it was in my bag. Bugger... The next second I knew... the wallet is gone. Me n my fren Sue tried to get up the bus to check, but the unfriendly bus driver claimed some weirdo picked it up n made away wif my beloved wallet!!! Arghhhhh!!!.... The trouble does not stop there.... my 70+ bucks were in there... along wif my jus-topped-up ez link, my ic.... me n fiance's photos..... lotsa other cards!!!..... I'm just so dead and gone.......      Luckily my sweet fiance and faithful fren Sue were around to pacify me s my tears broke like a river dam..... I just couldn't take tis.... I kept thinking wat I cud have done better to prevent this....... I've sworn to myself not to be the absent-minded fool I've became over these years.... It's just not worth it.... THe lesson is just to painful for me to bear.....      Consequences of my action,   * $100 replacement fee for making of lost ic   * new EZ link..... another $30 buckaroos!!   * cashcard - $10   * replacement of POSB ATM card - lost of precious marking and course time   * purchase of a new wallet - $100++ (tat was an Anna Sui latest range I lost, birthday gift from Mr    Zirk)   * our "tabung kita kita" - 70+ buckaroos!!   * a foreseen month of dwelling and sense of lost and guilt and anger!!         Those... ladies and gentlemen are wat I perceive and expect to go through within the immediate future..... Mr Zirk told me to take one thing at a time....To learn the lesson of being mindful of my belongings.... to not be in a rush or hurry and always check.....      BUT I'm always in a rush...always ON-THE-GO!!!!!      hOW?????

       Happy Birthday to my sweet fren Helena...  your frenship has endured time and really light my life.  Thus explains the present for you....       I'm really down.  I just came back from an awesome day out wif Mr Zirk but then things always have a way of taking a twisted turn.  I just can't help feeling out of control.  Am I really uncontrollable?  Why do I always have the knack of driving even the sanest person crazy?  Well... this is some mess that I mentioned I keep getting into.      Out of Control.  Out of Control.      Where should I go?   What should I do?   I don't know what you want from me!      I'm glad day one of PSLE oral is done.  Day two is next week, also Saturday.  I just couldn't stop myself from yawning and occasionally crossing my eyes.  Sigh... on Friday night, I had such a sleepless nite.  Keep waking up and refused to settle into my common deep beauty sleep.  Mr Zirk went to play bowling and I was all alone without anyone to calm me down on the phone.      I still remember the first time he accompanied me on the phone.  It was a rainy nite filled with thunderous thunder... *]   ... at about 3+ am in the early morning.  He called to ask how I was and if I was fine.  Falling in love was really bliss.     The big rock on the finger often also snaps me out of paranoia.  He loves me and can't help having mood swings.  I have mood swings too.      Dear diary, I sound pretty messed up don't I?... Observe the not-in-order story.... hehe....      Oh yup... after our movie "Secret Window" today, we went over to HMV.  There, I noticed this familiar guy staring and staring at my direction.  Oh yes, now I remember, he's Reza, a fren of an ex.  Well tats not important though, Mr Zirk was not really happy tat the guy was checking me out.  Why do all of the ex's fren haf to bump into me all over the place in Orchard??       The week has really been a tiring one.  Swimming on Thursday has left me breathless and superbly tired.  I suffered pectoral cramps.  And darn was it painful..  I had to literally pinch and massage the upper tummy!! Ouch!  My collig, Sue, urged and persisted for both of us to complete 12 laps.   Still a lot can be done for our abs though!! hehe... age is really catching up!!  Mr Zirk had upper thigh cramps lak!  S occer tournament.  Such is the lives of two aspiring athletes.... keke.... *winkz at Sue and Helena*.....  S they say, the man who removed a mountain does it by removing stones from it daily..... my quote of the year.... hehe... so till the next meeting.... I love Mr Zirk... I adore my friends and I cherish my family.  Stay fit and fun always........

       I've been to heaven n BACK...... WHAT haf I been up to the past 3 days???  SLEEP, SLEEP n LOTS of Beauty Sleep!!.... hehe...  Mr Zirk s, I tink, a bit pissed at the rate I'm going!!....       Saturday was a wonderful dae out to Bugis, 'Collateral' was such a bore even wif Tom Cruise in it.  DO NOT WATCH IT.  'Village' s scary but u'll curse the twisted ending... now 'Ella Enchanted' s a refreshing change.... I tink I'm just gonna stick to my happy movies for now!!  Dat reminds me, I crossed path wif a fellow chatter on e same day... n Mr Zirk said he just left his girl trailing behind just to catch up wif me.... hmm... Mr Zirk s so sensitive bout these things!... me n dat SOC guy just good fwens since 3 yrs back....  But everything ey ok.... wait till I upload the funny tings I made Mr zirk do.... like putting a long cup in his shirt pocket!....*am I cruel or wat!!*      Well... so many "sorries" to Sazymaera aka Helena for cancelling our dinner date... promise will make up to u next week k..... *u haf farewell dinner or sumthin tis friday rite?*        WHo's interested in Kickboxing? I'm willing to share some moves!.... yeah yeah.... so long s u entrust e future of your joints n limbs to me.... I do very e animated movements!... hehe....      On Sunday.... I hibernated.... so many many hours of sleep... woke up only at 2+ pm.... den a badminton session wif Mr Zirk for 2 hours.... my movements resemble a baby kitten who looks for the yarn of string n ends up tangled in the net...hehe.... Smashed n flicked till I lost my temper at my fiance who effortlessly ended all my feeds!!!! ARGHHHHHH....... *relax Nurul*.... well... e best man wins.... I tink I'm too competitive wen it comes to games.      On Monday.... I hibernated yet again... I wonder wat the rest of my frens did at home? Today we're supposed to jog... but being daft n sebarang person... I wore my cargo to meet Mr Zirk instead of my usual workout pants.... he banned me from running in those.  Wich in turn, made ME angry.  But alas, I saw his reasonings.... n we went home so I could change into my adidas.   I really HATE jogging! for many reasons such s feeling like air supply comes in short spurts.... like how my face turns crimson n overheated.... DEN comes staircase climbing sets! This time only 2 sets.  Cool coool!  Mr Zirk says I'm in better form.        Well those are my 3 days... full of activities... but when DO i get down (work tat is)... well tats left to be seen... maybe after tis I'm gonna get down to serious marking n planning.... I miss Mr Zirk... Wish him luck in his coming IPPTs.  I'll be training wif him though... S a fellow blogger did say in her blog, "firm up those thighs women!!"......Well well.... 0.5 kg of muscles per month is no mean feat!!      Have fun gals....like I say.... Stay fit n fun always!!!

For 2 and 1/2 weeks I've been tolerating my excruciating pain in my already hay-wired head!!  I'm just gonna wait for pay day before making my new prescriptions. I may look cool n bold... but now i'm real cold n a puddle of mush or mud for tat matter. Tis head pain really makes me drag drag drag!!  When I compare myself to a yr before, there are some improvements. Mood swings lesser. Body tighter. Skin tanner. But the head, head-acher!! *oh Nurul stop complaining bout your head. Lucky u still haf one!!*  Oh how lovely if I could just fast forward to Friday. 3 hours of school. Den smashing good-time lunch wif dearest Pauline n crazie colligs! At nite, proposed dinner wif Sazymaera aka Helena. Oh... y does she call herself that? ;]  Den a super long weekend till next Wednesday where I'll go out n enjoy, swim, play table tennis, jog, train.... sigh.. You mite be wondering wat kind of triathlete I am???? Well, I'm an aspiring one. My goal, simple. To be fit n active so that my body does not hamper my abilities to do anything.... including ber'ibadah'...  Well... gotta go... Napha Test duty starting soon... I'm taking the 1.6km run... Take care Diary... Can't wait for Mr Zirk to fetch me from school... by the wae, he's the fiance.... hehe...
