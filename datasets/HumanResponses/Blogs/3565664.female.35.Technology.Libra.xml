      My Retirement  So now these are my retirement years No easy chair for me So many places I want to go So many places to see. For oh so long I was your friend, a colleague and now a new wife But now I am at a new beginning Starting a brand new life. That pile of knitting that patiently waited For me to take some time I might get back to you in a day Or put you back in line. Those cookbooks that pile higher and higher I hear their pleading call Beckoning for me to come and see them Before I see next fall. The vacations I will sit and plan Exotic places afar Traveling by train or bus Or even  in my trusty car. The whole world waits for me to start To claim it as its own The excitement overwhelms me at times From me I am sure this is shown. I won’t forget the things I learned The people I have met Nor forget that first moment I will get my retirement check. No more alarms to waken me From my comfy rest I am retired now you see This new life is the best. Oh Retirement, sweet Retirement I sing with joy and praise The only damper to my joy I will miss my yearly raise!!!!!

      The Meadow  These meadows I walk so fine and green Give my soul peace My mind is at ease I hear the river calling Tears flowing with my past I listen to them calling I am Home at last For so long I listened to the melody The calling The whispers They always haunted me I ease into some comfort As I stroll this grassy plain I take my final place Knowing the peace will surround me Will ease my troubles and pain I listen to your sorrow The tears you shed for me The asking of why this all happened But maybe in time you will see No more suffering or torment controls me I feel free and alert I am let go of what haunts me Please let go of your hurt Don’t shed a tear Don’t cry over me Don’t feel like you failed I am at peace now you see My love for you did not go It will always be there In memories we had In the things that we shared I go away now To ease my tangled mind You will forever be My only one kind
