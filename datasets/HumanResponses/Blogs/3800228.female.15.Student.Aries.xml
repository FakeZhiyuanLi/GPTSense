      WOOHOO!!! I'm so happy right now! I just scored me, mo, ky and kelly ALL free acrylic nails for the ball! Wooooooohoooooo!! yeya .. thats like such a fucking score cause theyre usually $45 and upwards just  for an acrylic tip and polish =D haha I finished off my maths test today, well actually I didnt do it all... I copied Steven (my good bitching buddy) for the whole last page hehe.. but hey who cares! Not like i was considering a career in mathsey stuff anyway! YAY 1 day left of term!Hmm shit i have a rehersal tomorrow night from 5pm till 10pm... tahts one thing that sucks about drama, rehersals! But oh well, on saturday during the lunch break ima go and have a look round town at the jewelry... and well anything else that catches my eye! Hmm so whats my achievement of the day haha, I read Martin Luther King Jr's "I have a Dream" speech.. its actually bloody  good! .. I wonder who the AB's are playing this weekend.. well who cares =p cause we'll WIN anyway!! Oh my interview at moontide went well, turns out  a lady who works there is a dancer and she was really interested that  I was interested in dance. OtAy thats enough hehe (and yes, i'm officially addicted to this blog) Toodles XoXo

      Oh yes, thats right I now have my very own blog thang (woohoo).. i actually only did this so i could post commments.. but seeing as i usually have more to say than i have time to say (yes i know that doesnt make sense) i could grow very fond of this whole thang... hmm haha maths test today sucked in its own special way.. liek have you ever looked at a test and just thought its probably a good idea to not even bother opening the page?... urgh english speech tomorrow.. fuck i hope i dont electrocute ky  ky bear with that comb.. =S woohooo 2 days left of term *SCORE* and besides.. no point in working over the next couple of days.. man i so have to get my nails done for the ball.. hehe.. and get my jewelry (having big domestics bout whether i should wear diamantes or crystals.. maybe cyrstals.. but mlah) haha otay i think this about enough for now.. tewdewlew! xoxo

      Howdy!  Woah anyone remember Hanson? We all i can recall of them is 3 guys.. 1 of which i thought was a girl and another which could quite easily pass as a boy attempting to BE a girl... and the other was so unmemorable I dont really care what he looked like. But.. they have grown up now! With a new song called Penny and Me they have a totally different take on music... its no longer Mmmmmmmmmbobping its more of a "tap-your-foot-by-the-fire-and-play-the-ukelaylie" sound.. haha okay enough of the cathy tryin to have a rant like a journalist heres the deal! The one who looked like a boy.. is nw DAYUM fine.. i mean DAYUM... he looks so manly its scary i even thought he was a chick.. ever! and the one who was kind of girl now looks still kind of girly... really freakily defined cheekbones =S and their new song.. its pretty good *nodds* so yes i am proud to say im a bit of a Hanson fan as of this evening! Havent done all that much today.. woke up late.. bummed round on msn and showered! Yay! Sex and the City is on tonight! Berger meets the girls =) i can't wait! Thats enough for now i reckon!  Toodooloo, Aurevoir! xoxo

      Kia Ora! Bonjour! Ola! Hellew!  Just felt like doing that, YAY HOLIDAYS!!! woohoo! although it doesnt really feel like holidays just yet because I'm performing today/tonight and also cause i had a rehersal last night, Rehersal was pretty wicked (believe it or not!)I made friends with pretty much everyone there haha mind you thats not that hard considering we all have a basic interest of performing etc so like whenever you have an awkward silence you can talk about drama... and then eventually get on to the topic of lesbian  dancing/kissing scenes... Samboka (im not sure if i can spell that yet) and also many many MANY other very random topics that only whacked out performing people who have been stuck in a room with no air con-fucking-ditioning with other whacked out performing people for like 5 hours can talk about! Great! Hmm today im performing.. TWICE! haha i hope my voice doesn't pack out in the middle of a song! *Runs to my pantry to take ALL the cough lollies* Oh i have my period.. got it last night.. which i am surprisingly happy about.. cause this means it wont just randomly pop up on me on the night of  the ball.. which would really suck cock in a big way! Alright i better  get going.. shower.. get my ass in  to town... rehearse.. perform.. shop.. perform.. go home!! :D and hopefully talk to dave.. but meh :p he'll  most likely be out! Toodooloo! xoxo
