      Now my last post I showed all the cars I would never drive. This post, I will show you every car I want to drive. Every car I show here is in my opinion a very hot car. It came to me no surprise that all the cars here are European. About half are German models. These consist of Audis and BMWs that happen to be my favorite. I won't be rating any of these because in my point of view they’re all superior except for maybe a Saab 9-5 Wagon which is still pretty hot. However, let it be known I did not write these reviews. Am I biased when it comes to German cars? Yes, yes I am.  http://netscape.edmunds.com/reviews/list/top10/102044/article.html  Now these are just my opinions and as you know you’re entitled to your own. Kevin, can you disagree with me on any of these models? If so, send me a comment.

      Ok, I went to the mall and watched I, Robot. There are many bad science fiction movies and many good ones. This was a very good one. The movie had action, great special effects, humor, and many good characters. The robots in the movie follow these three laws:  1. A robot may not injure a human or allow a human to come to harm.   2. A robot must obey a human except when their orders conflict with the first law.   3. A robot must protect itself, except when it is in conflict with the first two laws.   So yeah, Detective Del Spooner (Will Smith), is the only one in the world who doesn’t trust the user-friendly, polite robots that make life easy for the citizens of Chicago in 2035.He's the only one who sees this and when the robots rebel he can confidently say ,"I told you so doesn't quite say it."

      Ok. It has come to my attention that car companies have been making some very ugly cars lately. I suspect its because some car companies are losing money so their saving money by making a really crappy car. I don't understand how any people could drive these cars. It is for these reasons I'm going to show you some of the ugliest cars I've seen on the road. I will also be rating these cars where 1 is the least ugly and 10 is the most ugly. You can then comment on whether you agree with me or not.  1. The Subaru Baja: http://www.car-data.com/photos.30/p.subaru.baja.30.1.jpg  Now, this is a dumb car. What is it? A pick-up truck? A sedan? Or a mix? No, it's just ugly. My rating: 6  2. The Pontiac Aztek: http://www.savvymotoring.com/cars/2002/020701_02_pontiac_aztek_00.jpg  Ok, What kind of a designer would make this? The back of the car looks like the back of a rhombus. It’s big and ugly and stupid. My rating: 9  3. The Honda Element: http://www.familycar.com/RoadTests/HondaElement/Images/RightRear.jpg  Now this car is just terrible. The coloring is bad, and the design is horrible. But hey, at least the stupid name fits the appearance of the car. What next, The Honda Isotope? My rating: 6  4. The Chevy Avalanche: http://www.autoinfo.gov.cn:1656/internet/html/qczh/image/Detroit/prduction%20debuts/01avalanche.jpg  Just like the Subaru Baja, only bigger.  My rating: 6  Ok, now this is just my opinion. You can agree or disagree. My next post, "The Cars I Do Want to Drive."

       Ok. This&nbsp;is my&nbsp;first week of summer school. I hate it because I have to get up early and go to learn. Don't get me wrong, learning is important, but when you have to be in&nbsp; a class for 5 hours with only a twenty minute break it gets to be annoying. However, I am meeting new people from different schools, so it isn't all so bad. Even worse though, I have to do a ton of homework when I get home and we have a test everyday because everyday is the equivalent to a week of school. So, yeah.&nbsp;Wherever you go, whatever you do, always remember, Peter speaks English.

      I'm going on a mission quest to the west. Why? To find myself. I am serious. If I'm good my father will let me drive home. Look for my coming in 15 days after the 11th day of August. I will return.

      Ok. Today I’m really tired because I went and did about six hours of community service hours. I got these hours by going down to a forest preserve. Here I helped repair a trail. At this forest preserve, I shoveled, I pushed wheelbarrows, and I laid out some mulch to make the trail appear nicer. It was truly beautiful. The forest was nice and cool and the sun shined through making it light up. Animals calling, I watched as the water from a sparkling stream ran down a steep hill. The moss was soft. The terrain was magnificent. Nature. Is there anything more stunning? Probably. But I wouldn’t know.

      Heather came yesterday and I was expecting her for a very long time. I was happy to see her because she owes me a very special reward. But, why does she owe me a reward? Well it all happened one hot summer day when the she came to visit me two summers ago. Kevin, Ross, Annelise, Heather, her brother, Andrew, and me went down to the rope swing. The rope swing is located in a dirty, polluted, contaminated creek and she just happened to drop her dad’s cell phone in the deep, cold, contaminated water. Who had to go and fish it out? Why Kevin, Ross, and I of course. Several times over and over again, we had to dive under that nasty water with closed eyes and try to find it with our hands. That was unpleasant. However, we were promised a reward. Blinded by our greed, we risked our lives without question. After about an hour or so, Kevin located it with his foot. At least he thought he did. Anyway I dived in and dug through the sand and came across something that felt like a phone. I was holding my breath. How much longer could I have held it? It could have been a rock. But it wasn’t. It was the cell phone, and I surfaced ready for a hero’s reward. Technically, I saved someone’s life because her dad would have killed her if Kevin hadn’t located it with his foot and I hadn’t gone under to fish it out. And to this day, one year later, no reward. And today I say to her auf Deutsch, Wo ist meine Belohnung? My picture on this blog shows the creek I was in. That however, isn’t the true color. The true color is an ugly greenish brown. She also owes Kevin a very special reward because he located it with his foot in the creek and he was able to make it turn back on again. I do not know what strength lies within my blood, but I do know this: Heather owes Kevin and I a reward, and we want it today.
