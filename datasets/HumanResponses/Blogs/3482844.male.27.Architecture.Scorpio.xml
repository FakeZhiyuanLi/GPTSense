      So everyone needs a home, and that is what this is.  As you may be aware Everett has been the home to just about everyone who will be reading this, and it is in this spirit that I've created this blog.  It's the new Online Everett St.  It will be set up where all of you can post whatever, whenever.   The good thing about it is that all of us can go here whenever we want and see what's going on in the worlds of our friends, etc.  Important announcements, upcoming shows, dates of when you will be in town, washer techniques, who cares.  Everything is fair game. The one thing to remember is, try to make it a little bit different than email.  Instead of person to person communication, use it as a place to write whatever.  So let me know if you are interested, and I will get everyone started.  As of now, no pictures can be posted, because you have to have a pc in order to do it.  But I will fix it where you peeps can put pictures if you want.  Eventually, if anyone wants to do this, I will host the site on  urlLink Movable Type  which is a lot better, but it will cost me a couple of dollars a month.  Lastly, I was thinking about only using initials, no names.  Whatcha think.  And I am learning how to put in script too, so I can hyperlink things.  Anyway, let me hear what you think.

      Alright, I am trying to figure out how to get everyone involved where they can post on the blog using their account without having to write on the comment line.  Then you can just log on and post on the site from your account.  That'll be better.

      Looks like the summer is going to be good in the movie department.  Two new movies,  urlLink Anchorman  starring Will Ferrell is going to be some seriously funny shit, and what could be the best movie of all the time,  urlLink dodgeball , with ben stiller and vince vaughn. You know what's going to happen, Vince is going to be throwing balls at some ungodly speed while chain smoking.  I'm laughing already.

          Because of one season, an Orange County supervisor has suggested that the county's John Wayne Airport be renamed "The O.C. Airport, John Wayne Field." (Yes, with a straight face.) from  urlLink E!online .  Good luck with that. Also more  urlLink here .

         According to the Baton Rouge Business Report today "Also locating in a Mall at Cortana outparcel are Guitar Center with its 10,300-square-foot store next to Shoe Carnival and Office Depot..."  Now people will have a good place to get their Cajun music instruments for a reasonable price and with a good selection.  I'm betting that we see a huge surge in the washboard and banjo industry when this place opens.  Invest now!

      So I'm watching MTV's pimp my ride last night, and Xzhibit has on another throwback football jersey.  However, this time it's a  urlLink Terry Bradshaw 1969 Louisiana Tech throwback jersey .  Suprising, huh?  That's not all.  I go to the pimp my ride website, and looking through the flipbook of past episodes I come across X sportin' a Louisiana Tech basketball jersey.  Sorry I can't link to it, but in the flipbook it is the episode with the Nissan Maxima station wagon.  Pic 155 in the episode flipbook. Pretty cool guys, pretty cool.

        I know this isn't exactly a car site, or really any kind of site for that matter, but Porsche is  urlLink building a new 911  to "replace" the older one.  It's called the 997 and Porsche says 80% of the car is new.  Hmmm...so basically this "brand new" car has two names and looks identical to the car Porsche has been making for years.  I guess JP will like it.  Come to think of it, it's a lot like JP's hair.  He calls his haircut a new "do" but I can't tell the difference in the new one and the same shit-kickin fro he's been sportin' since he was five.

      At 37, Todd Snider isn’t quite yet the “old timer” he professes to be in “Age Like Wine,” the opening track on his new album, East Nashville Skyline. Indeed, lines like “five and dimmer” suggest more of a portrait of his longtime friend and outspoken fan Billy Joe Shaver, who unlike Snider has been through five (at least) different record labels. Snider’s only on his third, and that’s counting the label that dropped him before he even finished a record. But everything else in the song rings true to Snider’s personal experience, capturing in just under two minutes the better part of half his life and his entire career. “I’ve met every fool that ever signed their name upon these walls in the backs of all these beer joints and concert halls,” he sings at one point, and there’s no reason to doubt him. Even before he became a touring troubadour, Snider was a wanderer, drifting all over the country first as a child and later as a young adult. Collecting and making up stories along the way and turning them into song just happened to be an industrious use of his rambling time and wit.   By fate and circumstance, the Portland, Ore., native just happened to be in Texas for a spell when he decided to pick up a guitar — inspired by a fellow wandering spirit originally from out-of-state by the name of Jerry Jeff Walker. But while Walker made Texas his home, Snider kept on moving, and it wasn’t until he got to Memphis and Atlanta that his career took off, beginning with his 1994 MCA debut Songs for the Daily Planet. Featuring the minor hit (a hidden track, no less) “Talkin’ Seattle Grunge Rock Blues,” as well as the loser’s anthem “Alright Guy” (since covered by Walker, Gary Allan and — almost! — Garth Brooks), that record still holds up today, dated pop culture references and all (anybody remember Madonna’s Sex book?) And though he admits in the new “Age Like Wine” that “My new stuff is nothing like my old stuff was / and neither one is much when compared to the show / which will not be as much as some other one you saw / so help me I know I know I know,” the fact is that the six albums Snider’s released since his debut, including 1998’s straight-up rock ’n’ roll record, Viva Satellite, and last year’s Near Truths and Hotel Rooms Live, have just found him getting better and better. Along the way, he’s picked up fans like Shaver, Walker, Jimmy Buffett and John Prine (whose label Oh Boy Records has released Snider’s last four records). He’s also, as any true Snider aficionado will tell you, one of the best live acts you’ll ever see; both Walker’s wife Susan and his son Django swear that Snider’s the most entertaining just-a-guy-with-a-guitar.

      Well, i am sick and tired of every democrat running to the gosh damn movie theater and pumping more money into michaels moore's pocket.  i won't see the movie. not because i am not curious...because i am. i am not going to be one of the suckers who gets pulled into giving away money because of the hype. screw michael moore and the radically liberal horse he rode in on.    after an interview comparing fox news, nbc, ect., this is what F9.11 is suppossed to expose:  So what does ``Fahrenheit 9/11'' give its audience that newscasts thus far don't?   For starters: the video footage of recuperating U.S. soldiers, Iraqi casualties, President Bush in that classroom paralyzed for seven minutes after learning of the terrorist attacks. This is video you have likely seen nowhere else, and you emerge from the theater wondering, ``Why the heck not?''  .....or in my opinion, "who the hell needs to see more?"  didn't we see everything we need to on 9.11?? if i see another plane hit a building i could lose my shit.  ``Fahrenheit 9/11,'' which won the top prize at the Cannes Film Festival in May, tackles grand themes with humor, fury and naked partisanship that insists upon a response from the viewer.  And it provides a bracing alternative to the claims for objectivity that reign at TV news outlets (including, naturally, the ``fair-and-balanced''-boasting Fox News Channel, whose lack of objectivity is probably its greatest asset). These Big Media news providers have served as Bush administration facilitators ever since his disputed election, declares Moore, a little guy whose message is unmistakably his own.   Moore has been in the public eye since his first theatrical film, ``Roger & Me,'' became an out-of-nowhere hit in 1989.   In the meantime, the companies that owned ABC, CBS and CNN have been swallowed up by even larger conglomerates. NBC News and its cable-news outlet MSNBC, launched in 1996, remain under the wing of mammoth General Electric, while Fox News Channel was created in 1996 by global media giant News Corp.   Unshaken by this media upheaval, Moore remains a known quantity, a media force who charts his own path. Maybe that's another reason so many people have left their easy chairs to go see his new film. And why even people who don't go can't leave it alone. i can't leave it alone because i am tired f hearing about it. it is a fucking movie. MM is not saving democracy. he is simply filling his greasy hands with cash due to bandwagon views about current hot topics.   hey- was i ranting??   hahah

      Ask any beauty pageant contestant what they most wish for and the answer will invariably be “Peace on earth” – with “Ending world hunger” in close second place. But how to achieve that lofty, earthly goal? A winning smile, a gestural wave and nice eveningwear can only do so much. Fear not, beauties of the world: David Krieger, founder of the Nuclear Age Peace Foundation, has developed a list with 100 ways to “Promote a more peaceful world”. And Joshua Chen of Chen Design Associates in San Francisco has given those one hundred ideas visual interpretations in the self-published book Peace: 100 Ideas.  The premise of the book is really simple, it’s Krieger’s one hundred ideas illustrated in a tight little package that manages to act as both a socially conscious venture (by giving 10% of the proceeds to wagingpeace.org’s mission for a more peaceful world) and as a very decent promotion piece for the studio – no matter how much they play down that aspect. Admittedly, while the book is solely designed by Chen and associates (both past and present) the book manages to avoid a self-congratulatory tone. Most of the time.  Peace: 100 Ideas is handsomely produced: perfect-bound inside a nice, thick, silky-smooth cover with beautifully reproduced images. And it’s kind to the environment too, with no new trees used to print it, which accounts for seventy-two trees saved. Inside, each idea for peace gets its own spread in the book and each is interpreted in its own unique way in varied styles from photography to illustration to computer-generated imagery to collages and, I’m guessing, a good fifty or sixty different typefaces. After all, there are one hundred ideas to depict. If you are familiar with CDA’s work you will certainly notice a lot of visual cues from their client-related work in this book and at times it seems like a quick browse through old files helped inform some of the ideas. Nonetheless, CDA is a talented group and many spreads are riveting and a joy to look at. Others are obvious and literal and others are simply not that interesting or well done. And none give emotional goose bumps.   The one hundred ideas themselves are not very revelatory or highly inspiring, they are as appropriate for promoting world peace as they are for keeping kids at summer camp from killing each other. However, they do act as a reminder that simply acting as a decent human being – which seems too much to ask for these days – is enough to promote peace. The pairing of ideas and visuals makes the proposition a whole more valuable and relevant to the public – the book is in the end a nice gesture and contribution during troubled times. Inspiring, motivating and comforting.   Unfortunately, unless people take it upon themselves to follow ten, five or even one of the hundred ideas, this book is as useful as Miss Nebraska’s espousal of peace on earth.  http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0974658200/speakup-20/002-6720724-7581616  Book Information Peace: 100 Ideas by Joshua C. Chen, David Krieger Hardcover: 224 pages Publisher: CDA Press (November 27, 2003) ISBN: 0974658200
