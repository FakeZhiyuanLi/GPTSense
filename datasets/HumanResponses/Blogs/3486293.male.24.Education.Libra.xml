       I work in the midst of relative wilderness of Kobe right now, and currently, am doing 'home visits' to some local elementary schools - thoroughly enjoyable. This is the walk (read: hike) to one of them. Houses dotted around lush wilderness with amply babbling brooks (american vocab) dashing and splashing downhill. The local area has also turned up vast quantities of bronze-age articles from many aeons ago...  urlLink      -Shot and Posted by Paul

       Its hot and humid, and school doors and windows are usually wiiiide-open, unless they're lucky enough to have air-conditioning (the only ones lucky enough to have this are schools next to railway lines, for obvious noise reasons). With such open access, we get a wide variety of kingdom animalia. Pigeons (rare), lizards, enormous bugs, a fair share of giant hornets, and 'things' like this be-yotch. I just slapped her across the chops with some heavy print so she's about to barf.  :)  urlLink      -Shot and Posted by Paul

       Also at the Suzurandi Bunkasai - Took a quick stab at some Shodo (calligraphy - "the way of writing"), and found that I wasn't so bad at it. Not terribly good, either. But I chose some kanji I knew and spelt out my name as best I could. Well chuffed!  urlLink      -Shot and Posted by Paul

       This weekends Suzurandai bunkasai - with Ethan James and Motoki. About the most impressive single piece of work I saw was "The Scream" rendered from thousands of folded cranes - the principle behind it not being too dissimilar to the girl who began to fold thousands of paper cranes during her terminal suffering from Cancer because of the A-bombs dropped on Japan. Perhaps just fluke, but a stark image indeed.  urlLink      -Shot and Posted by Paul

       (content which could possibly bore the average reader has been [re]moved)  I shall leave you with two quotes:  "At bottom, every man knows perfectly well that he is a unique being, only once on this earth; and by no extraordinary chance will such a marvelously picturesque piece of diversity in unity as he is, ever be put together a second time." -Friedrich Nietzsche, philosopher (1844-1900)   "Friend, don't be a perfectionist. Perfectionism is a curse and a strain. For you tremble lest you miss the bulls-eye. You are perfect if you let be. Friend don't be afraid of mistakes. Mistakes are not sins. Mistakes are ways of doing something different, perhaps creatively new. Friend don't be sorry for your mistakes. Be glad for them. You had the courage to give something of yourself. It takes years to be centered; it takes more years to understand and be NOW." Friedrich Salomon Perles (Fritz) - In and Out the Garbage Pail

        urlLink      Party - all questions I have had emailed to me regarding the party so far were all answered in the email I sent out last month... anyway, the phone has been rining and plenty of folk have been asking if they can bring along a few more people. The more the merrier! Less to go around??     urlLink HERE   are the   departing subway timetables   for those interested. I have also printed copies and put them up at my place.  Just got off the phone from Steven, and he informs me that DJ proceedings will be starting  later !  In case you didn't bother reading it (as expected), here it is again. Additionally, I would like to tell everyone I operate a no-smoking policy in my premises.  And all crash places are full, so if you fall unconscious, I will put you outside ;)  -------------------------------------------------  What: ---------- Party  Who: ---------- JETs, KATEs, friends of, my friends, invite as you please, but keep it reasonable (whatever that is)  When: ---------- B - SATURDAY 12TH of JUNE (next month, weekend after recontracting conference)  From around 5PM to around 11PM   See you then!   Where: ---------- Pablo's Apartment, 721 building. Amity Gakuennishimachi/Gakuentoshi Nishi-Ku   Featuring: ---------- -Easter Egg Hunt for those who missed Easter fun! -Twister! -Star Gazing! -Sh*t loads of free alcohol (1stC1stS) -Softdrinks also available for non-alkys and drivers -Drinking Games! -Party Games! -Prizes! -DJs! -Music! -Etc!  Preparations: ----------- Can everyone bring a carton of their favorite juice along to help out with the dilution of drink? Hauling the requisite amount up my stairs is a bit bothersome. This variation will allow everyone to make a large proliferation of cocktail types - hooray! Cocktail books? Bring them! Games? Bring them! Hot Ladies? Bring them! Forward this to anyone I may have missed.  Reminders: ---------- We dont tolerate: baiting, trolling, fighting, arguing with the host (I'm always right no matter what, if you disagree with anything I say, you are still wrong), and other things that with a bit of common sense are easy to avoid.  The blurb: ------------ Yo people, I know you're there, so answer this email.  I'm throwing a big punch party at my place now that winter is over - just for the hell of it. What I need to know is numbers and how many heads I'm buying alcohol for. Everyone is invited - JETs, KATEs, CIRs, Japanese friends, teachers etc - but its going to be a first come first serve agenda on the day of the party as you know how difficult it is to fit all of this years Kobe JETs into our pokey apartments. If you would like to attend, please reply to this email.   For those of you who attended Caras Christmas bash, you'll know the size of her apartment. My pad is roughly 2-3 times bigger, so there shouldn't be too much squeezing *ahem* - at least up to the first 50 people. Five flights of stairs will certainly sort the wheat from the chaffe.  The punch parties before now have basically consisted of an industrial sized container filled with a lethal mixture of alcoholic and non based drinks (this is Japan, itll probably be smaller). Combined with some fun drinking games (prior suggestions welcomed), dares, forfeits and us, this will make for interesting general carnage and debauchery. This will also be good fodder for the chroniclers of the 2003/04 Kobe JET video.  Caterers and/or food is welcome, if you really want to bring a bucket of KFC, so be it. Organising the drinking mission will be tough enough, so help here is appreciated.  Events such as these ideally go through the night, and when the smoke clears from the battle-field, anyone who brings necessary provisions is welcome to crash. *prior confirmation recommended  Japanese version follows (set browser encoding to UTF-8):  寒い冬も終わって暖かくなってきたことですし、時間や日付はまだ決めてませんが今月僕のうちで皆さんご存知のカクテルパーティーをします。特にこれといった理由があるわけではありませんが、楽しそうだし、何よりたくさんの人が来ると、暖房なしで僕の部屋が温まるでしょ？ ということで、事前に何人ぐらい来られるかを知りたいので、参加できるかどうかをこのメールに返信して 教えてください。  JET、KATE、CIR、日本人の友達、先生方、どなたでも歓迎です。でも、監獄みたいに狭い僕の部屋に全員入るのは厳しいでしょうから、どうしても先着順に中に入ってもらうことになると思います。カーラのクリスマスパーティーに参加した方は予測がつくと思いますが、僕の部屋は、だいたいあの２～３倍です。だから、少なくとも最初の５０人までは大丈夫でしょう。   これまでのカクテルパーティーでも、かなり大量の強いカクテルを用意していました。それに、罰ゲームや宴会向けゲーム（何かアイディアがあれば、言ってください）が加わると、本当に恐ろしいぐらい盛り上がること間違いなしだと思います。それに、今ぼくたちが 撮影している2003年度JETのビデオ作りにもいい機会になることでしょう。  食べ物を作ってきたり、持ってきてくれるのも大歓迎です。もしケンタッキーのボックスを持ってきたければ、それでもいいです。  これだけの規模の飲み会になると、「それぞれができることをする」という方式に頼らざるを得ません。すべての飲み物を用意するということはかなり厳しいので、カンパや手伝いは大歓迎です！  みなさん、よろしくお願いします。  こういうイベントはオールナイトが理想的ですから、協力してくださった皆さんでパーティーが終わった後にそのまま休みたい人がいれば、遠慮なく泊まっていってください。事前に言ってくれると嬉しいです。    urlLink      -Posted by Paul

       Yeh-heah, baby. This Saturday sees the arrival of wanton carnage and debauchery in the form of a party im throwing. With a good few months worth of planning and, dare I say, careful thought, it should be fun. Many things organised, and a few goodies in there too. Games with prizes *oooooh* and some DJs *aaaah* a live photo show *mmmmmmmmm* and VFX *waaaah-whoooh*. That said, it can all fall apart at the last minute, but theres always the crates of free alcohol to spice things up.      urlLink     I also hit a few curious variables - some people don't like parties, but I'll just put this down to the fact that they've always been disappointed before now. Liken the disappointment to women getting the kind of 'regular' sex from a your average joe man who busts his balls on a nine to five, comes home rather depleted but nonetheless happy to see his missus. They've just not had the right *party* yet. ;)  5 weeks until a home-visit, some exciting sounds in the DnG foundry, summer-time. Ho-hum, many things to look forward to anyway.

       To clear up any confusion on that last post: I had to crash in Kobe at Chito's place after I went to get my camera battery. Unfortunately, I missed my connecting train from Kobe by 2 minutes, because of A) knee injury B) being so ripped  ; )      Chito offered me floor-space to crash after getting pounded by the rain and posessing an empty wallet at midnight. Taxis set you back a fair whack of 6000 yen from Sano to Gak. Steeeep!  Anyway, being so happy to get my camera battery back, i took lots of pictures in the AM. So no, I didn't have lots of chicks staying over at my place. Booo.

        AKs boss frequently taunts her at 10PM saturday evening ('personal time') telling her to come in to work on Sunday morning (during 'personal time').  We have been reciprocating cultural expressions that address this situation - one in Japanese "shikataganai" meaning "it cant be helped", and my reciprocal *ahem* "fuck you". I have also suggested expressions such as "raise". With such hard work, don't you think its a good idea?      -Posted by Paul

       Russ, the original salty dawg is back in town from the deadly gangstadise (I just invented a word, claim!) LA. On our first night we successfully drank sh*tloads. Motoki got THRASHED. Ethan, on a rare occasion, got waay drunk. Russ loves to see Ethan get drunk and start a fight, thus why Ethan doesnt drink very often. still funny.     On our way back, we got a couple of free beers. All in all, an enjoyable and memorable occasion! ; )

       Steve, fellow room-mate from the conference, underscored the importance of the whole event by checking out a day early. Bless. Well, we did have a few wicked nights out on the town. I ended up staying out until about 4AM, caning some Drum & Bass at SoulBlood, and Steve caning beer at Sally's. The Hotel lobby was often frequented with conference paticipants in most inebriated states as late as 5AM. Points go to the participants who set sparklers off in their rooms and wondered why they couldn't wipe the 'stains' off the carpets in the morning. Still, I guess you'd have to be pretty leathered at breakfast time on checkout day. D'oh! Anyway, a most welcome 3 days off of work.
