      Linkin Park - Somewhere I Belong by Linkin Park   (When this began) I had nothing to say and I get lost in the nothingness inside of me, (I was confused) And I let it all out to find, That I'm not the only person with these things in mind,(Inside of me)But, all that they can see the words revealed,Is the only real thing that I got left to feel,(Nothing to do)Just stuck hollow and alone,And the fault is my own, And the fault is my own...  Chorus I want to heal, I want to feel, What I thought was never real,I want to let go of the pain I've felt so long, (Erase all the pain until it's gone) I want to heal, I want to feel, Like I'm close to something real, I want to find something I've wanted all along,Somewhere I Belong... And I've got nothing to say, I can't believe I didn't fall right down on my face, (I was confused) Look at everywhere only to find,That it's not the way I had imagined it all in my mind, (So what am I) What do I have but negativity,Because I can't justify the way everyone is looking at me,(Nothing to lose)Nothing to gain I'm hollow and alone,And the fault is my own, And the fault is my own... Chorus  I want to heal, I want to feel, What I thought was never real, I want to let go of the pain I've felt so long (Erase all the pain until it's gone) I want to heal, I want to feel, Like I'm close to something real, I want to find something I've wanted all along, Somewhere I Belong... I will never know myself until I do this on my own,And I will never feel anything else until my wounds are healed,I will never be anything until I break away from me,I will break away, I'll find myself today... Chorus (repeat until end)  I want to heal, I want to feel, What I thought was never real, I want to let go of the pain I've felt so long (Erase all the pain until it's gone) I want to heal, I want to feel, Like I'm close to something real, I want to find something I've wanted all along, Somewhere I Belong...
