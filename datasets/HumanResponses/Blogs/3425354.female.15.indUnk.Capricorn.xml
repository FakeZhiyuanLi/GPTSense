      i finally got to seeing the movie the day after tomorrow and i thought it was pretty good.  it did get way too much hype that it should've and the core had barely any publicity but was much better in plot and had just as awesome graphics.   yet that may also have been a factor why i thought it was so spectacular.  i didn't expect much.  gyllenhaal was very witty in this movie and i loved how much with such a disastrous (weather- wise) film, they managed to insert so much great dry humor into it.  all of it seemed to hard hit and real and in many ways, a little too possible to believe.  yet i guess with the fast pace of the storm and how rapidly it was moving, it all could've been a possibility and the ending wasn't as far fetched as it seemed.  and i guess the mini series of events that occurred between was very realistic and all could happen in a worse case scenario that either left me warm and heartfelt or paranoid at how i'd react in the situation because i could feel that it was real enough to be that affected and put how i would go through the motions and saw that they probably felt the same way too.  just not sure about the actions.  i don't think i'd ever have the talent to think that fast and be that panicked and selfish for my own needs to care and concern for someone else.  yet one thing i really appreciated about this movie was surprisingly not all the action and all the effects and the harsh realities of what we do every day can lead to an ice age and alter the whole future of life on earth, it was trust.  there were many instances in this movie in which i admired the mindsets and thinking of these people... and a lot had to do with trust and hope... two main aspects i deeply lack in.  i don't think i would ever trust an ambulance in that kind of weather or situation to show up to take a sickly child back home safely enough to wait at a hospital for days on end.  i really would've just gone with the rest of them, unfortunately.  and i'm not sure about the child.  yet i don't know... maybe at that time and moment i'll find that i won't have the heart to.  i don't think i'd trust my father that much and with panic be able to listen and hear the words coming  out of his mouth to listen to him and wait inside with six other hopeful independant others when the mass majority was persuaded and convinced that they can walk themselves down south.  i never knew destruction of ice cold air that could kill you in second.  i would never believe it.  i guess i'm one that just can't believe if i can't see it.  i don't think i'd trust him enough to safety and burn books and keep warm in a library surrounded by 10-20 ft deep snow and believe i was going to survive with nothing else but with the people around me and piles of clothes.  i would never care so much for someone at that time to risk my own life just to get penicillin for a sick person.  i don't think i could trust myself to believe that he would even come at all. i remember this one time we had the annual music in the air performance going on in our school and again i was in it and i loved how our school had this every year.  i guess it played a huge factor in allowing basically anyone involve in each class or as a school as a whole bond.  it made me feel important and special that i could participate in something like this.  like i was included and without me, my class performance wouldn't have been the same.  i hope others felt the same.  but anyway... after the whole mass of the productions were over and the orchestra had done their mini piece and the 'glee club' as we called it went and mr p's and weiners end finale was over we all had to do down to the lobby to wait for our parents to pick us all up, or meet them in the audience if they came.  so i was waiting in the lobby and didn't see my mom.  and for five whole minutes i just kept searching and it amazed me how slow the time was passing and how everyone was leaving and i still couldn't find her.  and maybe my paranoia was just to the fact i was used to my mom  always   being on time that when for once she was late i  couldn't bare. so left and walked over to stephen's house two blocks down thinking she parked over there or was at his house.  but instead his dad opened the door and was a little surprised too me and how afraid i looked so he gave me the phone and i called home.  my dad picked up and he was getting scared to the motive why i called when i asked him where mom was.  and i thin that was the first time he ever left the house leaving my brothers home alone that  late at night and drove to the ching's to pick me up, drive two blocks down only to find daisy,  my mom's friend on the steps of our school looking around for me and jumped up at her sight of me.  we all ran in to see my mom sitting at a payphone with the most worried look on her face and debbie and jenn ricardi's mom were on the steps just to say they couldn't find me.  i'm guessing they looked all over the school.  and i myself didn't know what to think.  i was just scared i was gonna get a beating or a good yelling that night.  and so we drove home in two different cars and everythign was silent.  when we got home i saw they had made tea for me, like they do every night i came back from music in the air.  and i drank in, brushed and went to bed.  or at least i tried to that night, but i couldn't.  just stared at the ceiling breathing in as mush or that cool brisk fresh air of the night listening to my mom cry and explain how distraught and worried she was of my safety, how i couldn't trust her enough to listen and stay in one spot to just wait to see if she'd come... and my dad saying nothing.  i felt pretty guilty that i didn't wait and that i made my mom cry,  but i guess at 8 years old it didn't go deeper than that.  and then the next day my mom's face was a bit pale and she didn't look so awake... even while she was brewing coffee.  the smell usually kicks, but i guess it didn't for her this time.  and then she calmly told me that next time she told me she was going to pick me up and drive me home and to wait somewhere, that she was going to be there.  she will always be there and if not she'll tell someone else to in some odd emergency and that they will repeat my name for me and say who they are and who sent them and that i would go with them and safely go home.  she would never walk out and never come without telling me.  she made that point pretty clear.  and i kind of learned from that mistake.  and whenever after that i used to feel panicked or worried that she didn't show after 5- 10 minutes, i start to feel guilty and annoyed at myself for it, and i blame the traffic, or my brother for causing some trouble again.  and now i know the treasure of feeling you're trusted.  and when i come to think... the last year has been so miserable for me because i couldn't be that person.  i couldn't trust my motives, i didn't know if the things i were doing were right or what i want and it ended up being nether.  i couldn't trust anyone else and thought  was higher than they're authority and didn't listen to them.  and they lost trust to the fact they didnt' even say anything anymore because they knew i wouldn't do it.  and i knew i wouldn't.  and i knew everything... i knew my motives and why i did them and i punished people because they deserved it and i questioned and scoffed at all their morals because i thought they were dumb, shallow and stupid.  i stopped giving anyone chances.  and after awhile it made me feel so angry at myself for doing this that i felt that everything was just useless and i couldn't turn anythign back around.  i couldn't deny people's morals when i couldn't even trust my own.   i convinced myself i wasn't all these 'bad' things when i wasn't and became so convinced that in the end i became every single thing i looked down on.  but who was i to judge good from bad when i can't tell the difference between that fine line that divides them.  whenever anyone said anything i was surprised by their reaction or i didn't thin kwas right, my immediate resopnse was anger and up until this year was when i actually began showing it.  and i regret that... i didn't think much into it like i used to and get over it and let it go but still remember it.  and if i did think far.. it was all going in the wrong direction.  i don't exaclty know how the subject shifted this way... but one thing i learned today is how golden trust is.  and how devestating the affects are when you lose it... for yourself as well as for others.  and how much hope can do for you.  i'm not sure i'll ever be able to gain it back... but then again there goes my lack in hope.  and well, if i never do, i just  hope  i can somehow get my brothers or someone else to see that before it's too late.  maybe i'll make that the first goal to hold for a long time.  one problem that everyone has is recurring mistakes... and it just takes simple ones like these to chane a life or two.  and something like that completes a life... at least it will mine.    i'm going to go paint now... for my brother.  i think he deserves it.  on  a positive end.  i can learn a thing or two from him.  happy brithday little bro.  even though it's in a week.  i need to get up and do something.  get rid of lazy ass syndrome.    have a happy memorial day

      one of the closest friends i've had in quite a while is being pulled out of school early tomorrow and then moving upstate.  i will no longer be able to see her... but i guess that's not a factor figuring we shared no classes this year but still talked...  i will really miss her... she is absolutely awesome.  there's probably a much better word, but my pathetic vocabulary will not allow me to think so.  we saw the ring together... freaked the both of us out.  tepel's class def would have been so bland without her.  i only got angry at her twice... whether i showed it or not... and that's quite rare... she's a borderliner to those of who i deeply admire.  she taught me quite a lot too... she taught me a form of admiration of people who's talents show... work hard, but may not exactly get out in the right light... i'm bad at explaining things too.  it's like those cheap pastel colored keychain plastic flashlights you could buy on any street in chinatown for a buck fifty... they're so dim and burn out before you know it.. but they still make light... and for the while they do... i guess that's all that counts. but  she  made that light seem like it lasted forever.  i guess she understood so many people so well even with the little she got from them because there was a little bit of her in everyone... and she saw that and related herself to you.  i guess you could say she was one of those nosy people who liked to poke into everyone's little conversations... but she had a trigger in the back of her head telling her when to stop.  it wasn't built in... but she just knew anyway.  yet... one thing i became so close to her was that period of time, and it's still ongoing, when everyone turned their backs on me... when i needed people to realize me in a lighter manner and help me the most... when i stopped crying, stopped caring and stop knowing what was right and stopped gaining vision of what i liked and wanted to do... she was right there felling the same.  she has had quite her share of that experience too.  and it makes me upset knowing that maybe i didn't pay as much attention as i should've... maybe i was that friend that turned her back when they needed it most.  i could've done so much more.  i always knew words were so much more powerful than actions.  or at least that was always true for me.  but when i lost the words... and my actions came ahold of me... i was lost... yet convinced i knew what to do.  i had seen it in a movie... give people what they deserved.  make what they did to you show and so they're punished and feel guilty for everything.  and when they didn't see it... i'd push it even more... failing to realize that i always was that victim just a year ago.  yet i saw it... i always did.  never showed it though... i wasn't good at it.  and i'm still not.  maybe these people were my victims and i pushed harder than i should've.  i should've stopped.  but i felt like what this person did to me didn't deserve to be let go of yet.  i disregarded those few simple points that maybe when they did that they weren't thinking about the consequences of the tone of their voice of the look on their face when they said it.  maybe they just accidently blurted it out and realized it and tried to hide it hoping i didn't hear.  and when they realized i did... just rambled on trying to find a valid excuse for the slip and failed... but why should i have been angry at their one imperfection at that moment when i have tons myself.  maybe because this person seemed so sweet and nice and everyone loved her that when she said something that hit that oh so sensitive topic for me and didn't seem to show any regret or presence of a mistake and just continued with stride finally passed the limit and pissed me off so much.  because what she did seemed to off balance everything else i saw as 'her' personality and that when she broke she specifically intended to hurt me for her own selfish needs and satisfaction and make it last to fuel her already bubblegum happiness for awhile while i sat in rage.. wanting revenge so badly that compared to the deep, internally hurting lamb with a bittersweet coating i was last year to the ravaging lion with an internal fire and with a nail filer in hand now... i believe that is some change.  but seriously... what typical girl like that would really take out that time and think to that point.  she probably had no intent like that.  or maybe she meant it... but didn't think to how far the spear would pierce.  she had no idea as to the reaction she was going to get and that was my problem.  because i failed to imply and figure that out earlier... like i used to. i guess not everyone around me thought as much into things and emotions and intents like i thought they did.  i used to thin kthat maybe everyone knnew what they wanted to do and how they wanted things to turn out... but it all always came out wrong.. or didn't come out at all.  because that's how i was.  i look at it know and think it was dumb and a waste of time but just because someone waved to me and i ignored it or i wanted to say hi so badly but the pressure made me insane that i just didn't do it... i would go home and cry thinking maybe that hi would've made their day... maybe they were waiting for it and were disappointed... maybe they too felt like with all they did for me they deserved one from me and then i just turned them down just like the rest of this damned population had done to them did.  i'd kick the bottom of my bed till the tips of my toes were bruised and my nails were bent because i said some stupid thing and they gave me a dirty look and i felt like the world ended.  first i'd be angry becaus i felt it was so rude for them to do that... and then i felt that they'd babble on to their friends to the dumb thing i said and i'd be shunned.  it never happened... i always became quiet again and went into a huge receptive mode thinking about how cynthia doesn't do that... she's smarter than that.  she's got more logic.  and that person doesn't know.. but i wanted to make them see... and never had the guts.  i was flipping through my yearbook last year and read all the things everyone wrote... the most common were 'stay sweet'  and 'you were such a good friend' and you were so nice' and i got a lot  of 'talk more's. and i got a lot of inside jokes in there.  i guess i underestimated how much people really remembered and thought about me.  one thing someone wrote that i don;t think i'll ever forget was the simple 'good things happen to good people.'  i kept that one close for quite awhile.  especially since it came from one of those people whom i deeply admired.  she helped me through so much and i felt became one of those people who i finally thought understood all my quiet actions that seemed to slip past everyone else's eyes.  i used to cry knowing that someone like her actually existed in this hellhole we all live in and made me hope that the world won't end with a bunch of ignorant and talking before thinking or never thinking fuckers.  she made me feel like i had a chance... and i started to feel that respect for everyone else even more than i did already.  and i really disappointed everyone this year.  i let down all my dreams.. all my motivations.  i dopped them all.  i have no more bittersweet coating.  just bitter and nasty.  i hate the word nice and i lost my sense of humor.  i stopped giving people chances.  stopped being quiet.  i stopped noticing and feelig the little things that people did or said.  i stopped being affected by the tiniest things people did.  stopped noticing the beauty that no one else could see with the naked eye.  typical people didn't exist.  everyone was special and everyone was admired.  i guess i really did like being lonely.  and even thogh i have more people to talk to now... i feel more alone.  maybe i grew... but i didn't know it was going to feel this way.  i was never innocent... but i miss being so sensitive.  i'm not deep anymore.. and when i am... it's all going in the wrong direction.  maybe people were in fact just as sensitive and deep as i am... but didn't have anyone else to recognize that but me.  and maybe to them.. that's what maybe made me special.  or my whole life has been a huge mistake.  but at least i felt something in the first 14 years of it.  this year has not been me at all.  and what to get out of that i don't know. and so i'll miss you laura.  i miss the person i was last year.  and i want to change.  not revert.  i just don't know how to do it.  i always think that i'm at the lowest level i could possibly get and i try to revert back and end up even lower.  and as i wrote in a private entry on xanga a while back... i convinced myself i wasn't when i wasn't and now i am.  and i know that makes sense and i'm sorry.i did things last year and even if it didn't feel right... at least i felt.  this year... nothing feels right.  and i'm angry forcing myself to be happy and content because that's who i used to be... but it's not the same anymore and i doubt it ever will be.  this change wwas way too powerful for me to handle what it came out to be.  and i still haven't be able to wave hi to that one certain person.  and i haven't cried out of actual frustration in ages.  i haven't had a good laugh in ages.  i haven't been a true friend in ages.  i haven't been true.  i haven't felt.  i haven't admired... although i thought i did.. but it was forced and nothing comes out of force.  i need willpower and hope.  i need to be sensitive and hurt easily again.  i need to be able not to fend for myself and not be so angry.. .a little, but not so much as now, again.  and then maybe... just maybe will i finally be able to see just exactly what i'm missing now.  maybe i'll see that person that slipped by everyon'es nose last year.  because whether or not she knew... she quietly did make a difference.  and threw it all away.  and now everyone's noticing.  including her.  and i want to take it all back.  but i can't.  and i'm desperate.  and nothing comes in any particular order.  and i do think i'm a failure in all sorts of ways.  i realized so much about myself last year that i felt lucky i had.  i didn't feel happy, just lucky.  and i cna't believe i've blamed two people for all of this.  it was my attitude all along.  and it had been so unreasonable and dumb.  and i hate who i'e become.  i admired who i fucking was last year.  why can't i go back?  why can't i be forgiven of this year of mistakes.  will next year be even worse.  i hope not. i don't want to have to feel like i have no other shoice.  i feel like i've hit rock bottom.. but i know others in a worse position and still moving on.  but how barely ?  i feel like i'm dead already.  i don't know what't the use. i need to straighten things out.  and there i'm going on again with force.. and i'm so desperate.  i've been on a mental breakdown for 8 months and as much as i was convinced i knew that already... i didn't.  helpo me.  fuck.  i guess i really won't be anyone's emotional therapist anymore.
