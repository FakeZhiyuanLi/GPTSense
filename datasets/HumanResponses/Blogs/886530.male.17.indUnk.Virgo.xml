      Omg.  At the Mandarin (I work there), I saw this one family composed of an Asian guy and a white girl. That say's it in itself, he's my fricken hero.  No doubt.  Fo sho.  He had the coolest kid's too.  Their daughter, had the CRAZIEIST HAIR ever, I can't stress this enough, it was so crazy.  Her hair was like reddish but like dirty blonde at the same time, that's fricken ridicoulous, she was like 3, and she had naturally occuring red/dirty blond hair, FROOKIN CRAZY!.  Yeah crazy, yeah, he's my hero.  CHOP DAT.  Then right after, I saw this other asian guy with this extremely hot white girl and I was like, damn.  Anyway these are my heroes. (for today, anyway)   Moral of this blog:  I like white girls.  On another note.        CHOP DAT LUKE.    and I'm not talking about that kid, you pervert.   Man, i'm such a horrible person.

      It's not so bad really, although 40% of my family's disposable income is no longer present.  It really isn't too bad, I'm taking care of a lot more things around the house now, and it isn't like they're horrible, but it does take away from my time.    On another note, I had my grad photos like yesterday.  It was pretty lame, because the woman there kept adjusting my face and touching me and telling me to tilt this way and that.  Really, who the hell wants to look beyond the camera? Like c'mon, do you really want photos of yourself NOT looking at the camera? That's retarded.  The only good thing I got out of the whole experience was several very funny stories.  It was pretty cool, I think Gord was the guy's name, let me elaborate:  Upon filling out the little form, there was a section where you could either check male or female, I made a small joke about by saying something like "Like that's going to be hard to tell." and then Gord started talking about his experience at a catholic school where he couldn't identify the sex of this particular large female.  He said something about her voice being really deep, how she could be mistaken for a varsity linebacker, it was pretty damn funny when he was explaining it.  My god, that was the best small talk conversation EVER.  I, again, have regain faith in the social construction of small talk, good things do come from it :)  Today, I went to the ROPSSA cross-country meet.  The day itself was gorgeous for being a race day, a nice temperate 10 degrees celcius, with a slight breeze and sun.  Man, that's perfect weather for running, keeps you cool and you don't feel down because of the sun.  I think 3-4 teams qualified for OFSSA, but i'm not really sure, because I left before the awards were handed so I could get to work on time.  The most heartbreaking moment was when the Senior girls, composed of Kate, Jenna, Leslie, Sabrina, Veronica and Crystal and a few more >,  Politics + sports = BAD  If you're going to have politics, be totalitarian, RUN RUN RUN, DON'T TALK, RUN!  har har.  Anyway, good day, some intersesting moments, some happy moments, and some disapointing moments, the Senior Girls did great, they tried their best, and that's all the could have asked for.  So they came up short, but that's in teh past, you can't change that, and if any of you read this, I really hope you guys don't dwell over it too long, It won't do you any good.  So enough with the advice, and back to me.  I placed 168/237, pretty good considering I suck and don't practice much.  I think I can do better in the future, and I plan on it too.

      I'm sad, I'm crying right now as I'm typing this.  My mom's on Paxil.  She suffered a anxiety attack a couple weeks ago at work, because of various pressures from her bosses.    She gets mistreated from her bosses alot, I heard alot of stories about it for the past years.  It's probably because she can't speak English very well and so she's treated like a mindless drone.  I fucken hate white people.  My dad plans to sell the Camry, anyone want a 2003 camry with about 1000k on it? Drop a line if you do.  Fuck, I hate my life.  Tommorrow, I'll be happy.  Maybe...  Sorry for being so sad, and emo but I've been holding it in for the past three weeks, trying to be happy for everyone else, doesn't seem to have the same kick that it once did. heh, crying does seem to help though.  Wish i had someone here right now to hold me.  Fuck i'm a women.  Irony at it's best.  Please if you read this and see me, for the love of god, don't bring it up.  I honestly don't want to cry in front of people.    Crying is so weak.    I'm sure all you people have gone through worst and haven't cried at all.  I'm such a women.  Someone kill me..  I didn't mean that.  Sigh...  Later Days.

      I have a long neck, not only that, it's disproportional to my body.  HOLY CRAP!  Yeah, I've noticed it recently, and I pointed it out today, and Atul agreed with me.  Yep, I'm a freak, that's right, a god damn, long-necked, orange-spotted giraffe.  At least, I'm moderately cool >.  In other news, today went by incredibly fast, and for the first time in a long time, I haven't fell asleep during something!  WOO!  So yeah, go me.  Also, this website will probably be changing quite readily soon, as I plan to add a different interface which includes flash.  :/   "FLASH?" you say  Yeah, Flash!  It's going to be just the header and side bar that will be flash and the rest will be normal, hopefully it'll load quickly on most computers.  That's just my plan though :p I'm still learning all this stuff via the internet and what not, hopefully it'll turn out well.    In other other news, I kinda stripped today in the middle of the halls afterschool infront of some random grade 10, 11ers.    "Why?" you may ask...  Well, it all started with Atul having this tendency of changing in the middle of the hallway, and I criticized him for doing so, and so, he said, something along the lines " You afraid to show what ya momma gave ya?" and then I proceeded to strip.  Yeah, I'm a guy to never back down from a challenge as long as it's not incredibly stupid or hurting someone. :)   In other other other news, I had a meatball sub today, oh man, it was damn good, SOOOOO DAMN GOOOD, I didn't want to express the goodness of it when I was eating it because I was with Hannah and Riyaad, both of them won't eat beef for their own reasons.  Hannah being a vegetarian and Riyaad not eating it because of his religion not because it's beef but it might contain some stuff that's not halal.  Anyway, I'm cool with everything, so it's all good.  But back to the sandwich, IT WAS GOOOD, DELICIOUS, JUICY, damn I wish I had another one right now.  On the down side, I had a massive cramp during cross-country practice, oh man, that was horrid, I guess i'm paying for my gluttonous sins.    Next thing to eat: some fried chicken, man could I go for some KFC right about now.

      Sometime ago, I don't know how long ago, I think it was like 2 years ago when I decided not to intentionally point out people's inadequacies in a hurtful manner, but after sitting here for hours doing homework and listening to music, teenage angst just builds up again.    Boy do I hate this feeling, damn angst, get off me!  As I was doing my Bio Homework, I also was surfing around to find links to put on my new blog,  I found Dipto's Lj and thought "that's a good one", and then I started viewing his 'Friends' section, lot's of asian girls just happened to be around, as well as IB people.  I then found Azim's Lj, Abigails, Rabiya's, and let's just say almost 20 million other people's from TFC.  When I assumed everyone had a Lj except me, I was just joking, but now, it's the  truth .  BLEH!  Okay, the best part was I stumbled onto Aaron C's journal.... hAHHAAH. what a joke.  Not only does his look horrendously horrid, but he's has the social skills of a tree stump.   Man, that felt good, this journal rox.    Let's quote him shall we?  Aaron says:    [ Women’s Vocabulary Translated ]   Yes = No   No = Yes   Maybe = No   I don’t know… = Thereare 3possibilities...read above   I’m sorry. = You’ll be sorry.   Am I fat? = Tell me I’m beautiful   We need to talk… = I need tocomplain…   I’ll be ready in a minute = Kick off your shoes and find a good game on TV.   I’ll meet you there in 15 minutes = I’ll meet you in an hour   We need…= I want   No, I’ll pay for myself = You’re the man, now pay up!   It’s your decision = The correct decision should be obviously now   Do what you want… = You’ll pay for this later.   Sure…go ahead = I don’t want you to   I’m not upset = Of course I’m upset, you moron!   You’re so manly = You need a shave and you sweat a lot            ARE YOU HATED?     YES!  HOW MUCH BRAIN POWER DO YOU NEED TO FIGURE THAT ONE OUT? GENIUS!?     urlLink Hah   I know that these things will come back and haunt me.  QV Lizzie from grade 9, i've heard some stories about something about some website.  If Aaron reads this and goes out to prove me wrong he will probably do something cool and then rub it in my face when he does it. Meh, whatever, I'm tired of being so nice, all the damn time sometimes.  I'm sure Riyaad feels the same way, he's sure yelling alot lately.  But he knows, it's not cool, so he doesn't go full out, but screw cool, SCREW IT TO HELL!

      After spending the last hour listening to Norah Jones on her Come Away With Me Album (kudos to Ruth) in conjunction with me staring blankly into space and reflecting, I've decided to set some goals for this year and cross off the ones I already did.   - Get a Job  - Get a girlfriend - Stop wasting time - Do run training - Break the 94% average - Get a scholarship, if not several

      I skipped school today-that's a first.  So I woke up, tired, eyes burning, cursing, and a little pissed off, because I woke up way too late.  After I calmed down, I realised I wasn't going to make it on time so I just stayed home.  Yeah, go me.  I'm behind in all my classes, at least I can spend these 8 hours doing something productive, instead of dozing in and out of the realm between sleep and consciousness.

      I've decided to jump onto the ever so loving blogging bandwagon.  You might be asking, why? WHY DANNY WHY?   If you want to answer, then you should keep reading.    Essentially, this will be my complaining space, I whine a lot, and I know it, I'm sure everyone around me knows it to.  I'm sure it's a bad thing, but whatever, I have to vent somehow, even if it's non-aggresive, high-pitched banter.  So yep, this is my blog, it's here to stay, will I guarentee that it will be constantly updated? HAH, I laugh.  Anyway yea, thanks for reading.

      What? Danny? Drinking? Yeah, my first, served, at a bar/restaurant.  Hah.  Illegal what.  So anyway, me and about 9 other of my co-workers, Peter, Vanessa, Elaine, Nancy, Patty&Paul and some other mentionables, decided to go to a bar/restaurant afterwork.  So I'm like, "Sure", this is a great time to get to know everyone else a little more, 'cause being a busboy, you don't talk much, 'cause you work alot.   So, me still without insurance, I had to bum a ride off Elaine, who drives an Accord Coupe, man, does it look nice.  It's A VERY NICE CAR, holy crap, it's nice, the dash and the entire thing, gorgeous.  But, it's no match to Peter's modded, Celica, even better, it's all custom modded, with H-D headlights, button engine starting, interior completely changed, hood thingy, mad spoilerage, body kit, skirt, everything.  Jesus, it's a beauty, and also Patty's TSX, man, good cars all around.  It's like a party, and it's just getting started!  BUt anyway, back to the restaurant...  We get to 'this' restuaurant, on Hurontario, I'll leave it unnamed, but I think just about everyone has been there.  We walk in, get seated, and start talking about people at work and etc... The waitress comes by, everyone orders various drinks, pineapple stuff, here, baileys w/ something there, and I'm like "Okay, recommend me something," I said to the waitress (since i don't drink, nor did I plan too, I didn't know of any drinks).  I thought she knew I was underaged, but I guess she didn't as she just said pick any of them, they're all good."  So I went to Vanessa, okay, "pick something for me, anything."  She said "Orange Creamsicle, virigin."  I'm like whatever, no alchohol is fine with me.  The waitress was like, (to me), "Creamsicle? okay."  and then I nodded...  When the drinks arrived, I got an ordinary creamsicle, which consists of like vodka, coconut, vanilla, orange and some other stuff.  It wasn't that bad.  I wasn't drunk either, but for my first drink, it was sure overrated.  I mean, c'mon I was expecting something either horrible tasting or fantaboulous and I was missing out on a whole other world.  It wasn't, it was a drink that went down easy, (vodka?!) i thought it would go down harsh, but it didn't, and it tasted pretty good.  We ordered about 80 wings between the 10 of us, and I downed like at least 20-30, everyone else had like 4.  It was sad.  Sad because no one else eats, WTH stop wasting food bitches!  Oh, and the ranch dressing that came with the vegetables, omg, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE.  HORRIBLE. WORST CRAP EVER.  And we had some left over wings as well.    I had a blast though, everyone is so much cooler away from work, they're more of themselves.  I mean, everyone is much nicer and much more interesting.  I mean, damn I need to go out more.  I need my car.  I need to be 19.  SHAZBOT!  All in all, it was cool, and if you still wondering where I went, Sara Pineau works there I believe.  Also, I'm really sorry I couldn't make it to Ruth's party.  Really.  I want to be there, but I need to work to pay off insurance and tuition for next year.  So i can't stop working.  Sorry :(    Unless we do more things post 11ish :)

      It's Halloween, it was just turned halloween about 7 minutes ago.  I've been sitting here infront my computer not wanting to go to sleep, but yet, I know I have to.  It's sad really, I'm trying to avoid sleep, just so I don't have to wake up tomorrow, but the longer I prolong this, the more I'll hate tomorrow.  Quite the dilema, with quite the easy solution.   You might be asking, "C'mon Danny, I'm not that bright, what's this great solution you have?"  I would say simply, "Sleep."  The answer to at least 98% of my problems.  Yet, I've been avoiding this act of refreshment and rest for the past 2 months.  How?  Well, I think I've been purposly leaving things to the last minute so I could sleep less, it's really crazy, I think subconsciously, I don't want to sleep, because tomorrow, well, tomorrow will just be another day, and tomorrow just doesn't feel as great as today.  It's really weird, maybe I'm not making any sense, but I'm just trying to say, "I think I don't want to sleep anymore."  But, I need to sleep, sleep is important, I've been sucking in everything because I don't do enough of sleeping, in fact, I think I sleep more in my naps and in class than my regular amounts of sleep.  It's 12:12am now, I'm wasting more time as I right this.  Heh, but forgive me, it's something compulsive about staying awake so late, it's a habit, my "clock" if you will.  I'm slowly becoming a vampire, a night person, a clubber (even though I don't club), one of those people y'know?  The kind of person who works/parties at night and sleeps during the day... Meh, I dunno, it feels strange, I don't think I really want to become a night person, but it's just happening.  Too quick.  I'm so not prepared.  Another thing, I don't remember my dreams anymore, this is where I get really dissapointed.  I think for the past 4 years, I've had maybe two or three memorable dreams.   Even at this moment I can't recall them.  It's quite sad, I need lucidity, I need freedom, reality is a box, and sleep is the grass outside that sandbox.  Where I can prance around and do whatever, where inside the box, it's building sandcastles day after day.  Quite boring.  Sleep is where it's at, but I avoid it.  Why?  I don't know.  I'm most vulnerable in my sleep.  Unable to sense, Unable to think, Unable to act.  You're helpless.  Maybe that's it, maybe i'm afraid to sleep.  I don't know, sleep is a rarity now.  I hope the 5.5 hours of sleep that I get today will be enough for tomorrow shannigans.  Always hoping, no acting.  I think I'll change that today.  Today is a day of revelation and change.  So, today, today is my last day as a non-sleeper.  My last day as a time-waster.  My last day as a slacker.  It's time to buckle down and start doing things.    I can't complain, I don't even deserve to.    Change is a very complicated thing, the mold that i've sat in the past couple months, maybe years, is quite comfortable, I don't want to leave it, because then I'll be treading unfamiliar territory.  This brings fear, uncertainty and probably a whole sloth full of other emotions that I can't think of right now.  These feelings are usually what stops you from change right at the go away, but then you sit, and you sit, and you sit.  You spend days, in the same shell, until your realise, you can do better.  You can be better.  You are better.  So you change.  Your friends look at you, they don't see change.  Your family looks at you, they don't see change.  Strangers look at you, they don't see change.  You look at yourself in the mirror, and you say "Wow, I've really changed." No one else will see it, no one else will appreciate it, but you will, I will.  And that's all the matters.    Self-revelation.  Thanks for reading.  One of my more thoughtout posts.

      Nothing really spectacular happened today, or really anything to complain about, so I'll just talk about TV.  There aren't that many great shows out there anymore, not like the good old days, of like, Sabrina the Teenage Witch, ABC's TGIF, Darkwing Duck, Gargoyales, the first season of Power Rangers and various other shows.  Those were the good days, the golden age of children-teenage television... maybe it's because I'm older now, that the current cartoons and teenage shows don't appeal to me.  Heck, or maybe because they all just suck.  But, in every cloud, there's a silver lining, so I'm compiling a list of shows that I watch, that I think are worth while watching... here they are:   Mondays:  -The O.C. (9pm, CTV) The O.C. is such a good show.  When I saw the first episode, I was like holy shit, this show owns.  Now, it's on my 'to watch' list, and I'm into the story line like no ones business.  It's really good, surpirisingly good! Seth owns, Ryan owns, Summer owns, Marissa owns, heck the whole fricken cast owns.  Maybe because it's easily to relate to all the characters >.   Tuesdays:  -24 (9pm, Fox) I started watching last season, it's pretty good, sometimes, I don't understand wth they are talking about, and just now, I'm confused... I think i missed the first episode which was at 8 maybe, so i'm really confused.  Meh, good show nonetheless, I'm so confused on why he's on crack now though, or whatever drug he almost took.   Wednesdays:  -Gilmore Girls (9pm, Global) I got hooked on this show when Ruth introduced it to me.  Man, such a good show, and I get ragged for watching this show a lot, but it's good.  It's some semblance of reality as everything there is just so random sometimes, sorta like real life.  It's a good show, if anything you should watch this one.   Thursdays:  -CSI (9pm, CBS) -Without a Trace (10pm, CBS)  A double header ladies and gents, two not really good shows, but they are entertaining enough for me, to keep me watching.  Both have little to no character development, but it's just fun to watch the intricate plots unfold in both shows and watch them solve it.  CSI is kinda going downhill now, I think it's their what? 4th season? They're trying to be too fancy now, and it's kinda ruining the pissazz(sp?) it once had.  Meh, it's still good... it's just a little airborne, it's still good.  I work on Friday and Saturdays, so I don't watch much tv then.   Sunday  -Alias (9pm, ABC) Same thing as CSI, not great, but entertaining.  Also, the Joe Schmoe show was really entertaining, there's only like 5 episodes but it's really interesting to watch because he doesn't know he's on a fake reality tv show.  It's really cool, go watch it ;)

      That's right Trevor, I've got your number buddy, and you're not getting away.... ever.  Your very act of imcompetence will be forever marked in my blog... MUHHAHAHAHAHA, FOREVER!  You're going onto my list.  That's right, THE LIST.  There's no escape, once you're on the list, you're on there for good.  FOR GOOD I SAY.  So, let me explain how Trevor van Ingin, the idiot that he is, did something completely stupid today.   Trevor van Ingin, is an ever so average looking guy with one exception, he's a dumbass.  Today, during lunch, I was minding my own business, having a conversation with Hannah and just about to eat my sandwich that was sitting on the table in it's container.  When all of a sudden, SHABAM! Here comes van Ingin, with no sense of balance or intelligence, plants his hand right onto my sandwich.  Now here I am, completely dazed and and confused on what exactly had happended, as he 'handed' my sandwich.  Clearly ladies and gentlemen, that that sandwich was no longer palletable or worth even eating, since we don't know what sort of business Trevor partakes in with his hands.  However, I was quite hungry so I ate the sandwich anyway just without the top slice of the bun.  I had to awkwardly fold my goddamn sandwich into some taco/pita like thing.  It was horribly made and even more horrible to eat.  That bastard ruined my sandwich.   What was really funny was when Andrew planted the tossed half of bun onto this guy's head.  I felt sorry for him, but he never apologized for planting his hand in my sandwich or anything, so he deserves it.  Stupid sandwich-ruiner.  I'll get you....I'll GET YOU! TREVOR VAN INGIN, YOU'RE MINE!  In other news, I need a costume.. any ideas? Submit ideas on the tag board over there ->  Yep, that's all I got today...  Later Days

      Wow, this game has a super good storyline, the game was way too short though, took me about 3 hours of straight gameplay to beat it.  Pretty easy by any standards.  Heh, Max Payne is such a badass :p  Mona Sax is such a hotty.  But yeah, the game owns, go play it, it's worth it just for the story.    That's all I really did today, play games, practice driving and did some homework, really uneventful, no interesting stories.  Oh wait. there is one.  I went to Shopper's World today to get some print cartridges, some bins, some clothes and a replacement toque.  As you can see, the picture in the below post has me wearing my favourite toque, it's all black with a simple Nike checkmark in the front.  It was the best toque ever, but then I lost it one day, and I was saddened :/  So, today, I went out in hopes of replacing my beloved toque.  Unfortunately, THERE WAS NO TOQUE IN SIGHT.  Those communists stopped producing my favourite toque and even worst the retarded salesperson made a sly remark at me.  What a jackass.  Because of that, I will never shop at Foot Locker again.  Ever.  YOU JUST LOST A VALUBLE CUSTOMER FAGMOTRONS.  So.. let me explain, why they lost such a valuble customer, such as myself.  I walked into the store, with an intent of browsing for my toque, but before I could even make it past the front shoe racks, some stupid lady in a referee getup asked how I was doing, whereupon I replied, with just fine and asked her how she was doing.  This was a horrible mistake as I let her ask me, "Do you need any help?" and me, not being able to lie, said "Yes, I'm looking for a black Nike toque"  She took me to her "toque" section, which was quite sad really, it had like two toques and like 50 million fagetly looking crossbreed toque caps.  You know what i'm talking about, those new hats that seem to be so hip, which are between a cap and a toque.  Yeah, those are gay up the wazoo, no one likes them, go back to Italia you genos.  Anyway, i explained how i loved my toque so much and that I lost it and am in the process of replacing it, when she replied "Good one there, buddy" in a condenscending matter.  Yep, I got quite mad and quickly left the store, in one of those, "I'm not coming back here ever" struts.    I owned foot locker good.  or it owned me...  MEH!  That's all I got, later.

      Today, the entire day, from 11am to now, was spent at work.  Yep, the whole day wasted at the corporate asian establishment aptly named the "Mandarin".  It's so damn communist, it's China.    So anyway, my apologies to Christie, for my misuse of your picture but, it was just too hard not to use.  Here you can use this one of me, and turn it into something funny or better yet, spread it around:     Okay, back to me working for the corporate "man".  So today, I went to work half-dead, and wasn't in the mood of smiling for customers, so I didn't.  I didn't smile at all, it was quite sad.  Oh on Friday, I saw Hannah's boyfriend there with his mom, it was weird, he wore pretty nice dress clothes with shoes to match, but he had various string braclets and accesories that ruined the whole shabang.  Oh well, it was nice seeing him, although I don't think he saw me.   Apparently, one of the hostesses, is like my cousin's cousin's father's friend.  Or something or other, 'cause since we're all asian, we have to be related :/.  But really, it was weird, I was like, woAh! Like 3rd degree of seperation, and what not, it was freaky.  Anyway, her name is Elizabeth, but she prefers Liz, and she was trying to hit on Peter (my co-worker), he's a busboy too, but he's the son of the president of Mandarin who's a millionaire.  Okay, let me start over, so it makes more sense.  James Chiu is the founder of Mandarin, and he's cash-money-money up the ying yang, and wants his son to learn how to earn money and whatnot.  So Peter, his son, is working for me.  It's funny, I train and boss around people who are way older than me and can clearly kick my ass, it's pretty cool :).  So yeah, this guy is like 5'11, pretty good looking, I'd assume and drives a modded Celica, did I mention he's 19?  So yeah, I could see why girls would fall head over heels for this man, he drives a damn nice looking car and his dad is a fricken millionaire.  So yeah, back to Liz, yep, she got all upset and what not when I told her that he has a girlfriend.  It was quite funny to watch her squirm in dissapointment.  I owned her good.  In fashion news, I think the new hip thing for females is those sweaters with excessive neckage.  You know what i'm talking about, those like cord like sweaters with all the crazy extra fabric around the neck area.  Yeah, it's the new thing.    So yep, working is such a waste of time, but I think I actually do need the money now for Uni, for sure.  Anyway, later days.

      Oh... my... god... best day ever! Next to the bestest day ever of course.  For those who don't know, I believe the bestest day ever was May 28th, 2003, or was it hte 27th? or the 29th? It's one of those days >,  So, anyway, today, OWNED.  LIke no one's business, like money in the bank.  Wao!   Okay, so, today, like every other day, started the same way, waking up... hahahaha. (I kill my self sometimes)  But really, today was like any ordinary day, the morning process of showering, not-shaving, eating, dressing, shoeing, and out-the-dooring.  I felt okay today, not as tired as usual and was pretty giddy about the events that were going to occur later in the day.  Class was like always, bio quiz, math mastery, chem lab, english poetry.  Same ol' same ol'.  However, after school, ah.. the real bliss.  The sweet sweet smell of having 200 horsepower between teh loins.  Ahh.. it's invigorating.  Okay, I'm exaggerating.  Really, first time that I've driven w/o my parents (besides the g2 test) and it fell pretty good.  Although I noticed that the brakes weren't behaving like they were suppose to... they sometimes locked up, or would seize early, my dad told me afterwards that it was because it was raining earlier and that there was water in the breaks/break pads or whatever.  Meh, learning things everyday!    So, I went to see the Matrix at 5, with my brother, Andrew F., and Greg T.  We were the first people in queue and at front of the line.  We got in first, and sat down in the perfect seats, right parallel with centre of the screen, but the image was slightly off 'cause the projector guy is an idiot.  But, once the movie got rolling, man, It WAS AWESOME. AWEFRIKENSOME.  I was so suspensful, it was was crazy, I literally thought I was right in there, fighting for mankind >,  Jesus, KFC, is so good.  MmmM Finger Lickin' good indeed.  It was good, really, we had a 10 piece meal between my brother and I and man, I had like 6 pieces of chicken.  I was good.  Oh my soo good.  *drool *drool It was GOOOD! I can't say it any other way, it's just damn good.  The crispyness, the carcegenic, mutagenic, DNA-altering, artery clogging, fat adding, goodness of this chicken is just too hard to resist.  Man, now that, that craving is over, I can finally get on with my life.  Finally.  Some Finality.  Man it coincides with the Matrix so well.  FINALITY! WoOoo.  Gilmour Girls, RWAR, omg, my study tree ;(, wish i had a study tree.  Oh rather, the ability to see women in green tops with no bras.  RWAR. :p  j/k okay, i'm not kidding.  Man, that would be such a cool ability :p  So, I'm going to close this off with something, TODAY WAS GREAT, RWAR! AHHHH! GOODAR! GOOARD SKFJSKLJF GOOD!   Later Days

      I honestly think I'm bipolar.  I'm happy for one moment and then quite sad and depressed the next, usually I rarely show that latter, but today, I think I was pissed off a lot and it showed.  Today was really uneventful, but I was pissed off at my stupidity in math, pissed off at my stupidity in chemistry, and pissed off of the stupidity of Ramy.  My god, stupid kid, stfu.   I always end up forgetting to do things that I really wanted to do, and afterwards, wallow in a sad state, it's quite retarded of me, maybe if I had more initiative.  I really wanted to comment on Ruth's necklace.. I think it was new, maybe it wasn't, heck, it looked good on her, I could have said that at least.  Now, it's passed, and I can't do anything about it, except say the same thing tomorrow.  Yeah, I'll do that.  Tomorrow.  In retrospect, it isn't as important as I usually make it.  I take almost every moment of my life seriously, as if it was my last.  I guess that's a bad way to live, but whatever, I think it makes sense, what if I get shot suddenly... Meh, whatever, too much thinking, not enough doing.  Maybe it's the weather, I tend to get more pissed off as the amount of sunlight decreases.  There's a name for it, I can't think of it right now, maybe I'll get to it at some other point.  Also, I'm really itching to fight someone.  Really.  A can of woopass to be unleashed.  I think it's bad, but I really really really want to break something over someone's head right now.    I'm not actually as crazy as this all might seem, I just get mad at a lot of stupid things.  It'll go away, like always.   Oh, and my wrist is like broken, it doesn't bend certain ways.  sigh...  Highschool really seems pointless to me now.  Last year, I always thought I was learning for a greater purpose, to get a little closer to The Truth, but in reality, I think learning all these things makes it just a little worse.  I haven't, in reality, learned anything, I've just memorized things, and forgotten them when they weren't needed anymore.  Meh, this is so melodramatic.  Tomorrow will be better.  Later Days.

      i had a long post.  it was good too, about yesterdya and a elaboration of friday, but it didn't post for some reason, and now i'm pissed off and not retyping it.  So, I'll sum it up:  Gays are taking over.   Look at all those gay tv shows, and a gay bishop.   Saw Erin C. and Alex D. V. at work  Liz, from work, is a stupid bitch, who doesn't understand that Peter, DOES NOT like her, and she should get a life.  She's so desperate it's sad, she keeps bothering me to get him to talk to her, and it's ridiculous, I"M NOT YOUR FREAKING MESSENGER.  Ruth, from work, from Applewood, was wearing a Cat Women Costume, and she was fucking hot.  God, HOT.  Dawn, who I just met, a friend of Vanessa, who came to the afterwork thing, is also hot.  Liz is stupid.  The post was huge, and it was alot of backdrop story telling and etc, maybe I'll retype it tomorrow, but not today, argh, stupid internet.

      Knitting is like all I do now.  :/  When I said it's addictive like crack, I wasn't joking.  But, today, I dropped like 5-6 stiches on the bus ride home when we hit a bump in the road.  I tried to fix it, but I had no idea how, so I'm just going to let it sit for a while and hope someone tomorrow can fix it.  I'm looking at you, Hannah ;)  I'm not doing as bad in Bio as I orignally thought, but it's not very good.  Ms. Kowalska complimented my knitting today, but with her, it's hard to tell if she's being sarcastic or being serious.  Like, it's impossible to tell if she's joking or not.  :p  Went out with Ruth tonight, and just for clarification, it was the white Ruth, not the ones from work.  I got her some bubble tea, and when I was waiting in line looking at the flavours, I got really confused what flavour I should get her.  I was really afraid that she didn't like certain fruits and what not, so I automatically took out all the foreign/asian flavours, just to be safe.  So that left me with like... honeydew, watermelon, strawberry, mango and some other ones.  I decided on mango for her, and taro for me.  Btw, taro and mango are my two favourite flavours for bubble tea.  So yeah, bubble tea!  On my way back from Missisauga, it was really really windy, and when I was passing the airport, the ground isn't blocked by buildings, so I got the full force of all the wind, which caused my car to drift to the left a lot.  It was weird, compensating for wind is really weird :/  As I headed for her house, I got lost, 'cause I'm pretty horrible with directions, I honestly have no idea where I'm going at all :p  But I still found my way and ended up being 10 minutes earlier.  Yeah, I got lost, and got there EARLY.  I'm rarely late,  if ever :p  So, I went to the door, greeting and such, gave her her bubble tea, got a picture taken.  Then we went to DQ for more sweetness, and ended up talking for some time.  Oh, and my Blizzard had something in it that wasn't suppose to be in it, which really through me off.  The person making it, had to spoon something out of the cup before handing it to me.  Which was just, I dunno, disconcerning.  But yeah, I had a good time, and caught up a bit with Ruth, so hooray!  And then on the way back, I got lost some more.  I honestly don't know any roads except major roads :p   Mad Hax:  A E D A D E A D B C A C

           That's what it's like right now.  My highest mark in my classes is a 90 in English.  That's sad.  Very Very Sad.  Man.  SAD.  It's bizzare.   I'm hoping to make up a lot of ground in the latter end of this year (now) and end up with a decent average hopefully...  Yay!  Today, was the same as always, kept dozing in and out of sleep in Math and English, but I got the jist of all the lessons.  I lost my IB math text book, I have no idea where it went, I sware I left it on the locker and now it's gone.  Meh.  Uhm, that's it really.  Oh and Pop Culture club was fun.  Luke wasn't having much fun, I could tell, but I really enjoyed talking about the Matrix for like an hour.  T'was really cool :)  Pop CULTURE!! wowooooo!  I'm eating some  urlLink Tostitos  right now with some salsa, not that bad considering it's mild.  Speaking of which, I was explaining to Hannah, that white people's hot/spicy, is a coloured man's extra extra mild.  It's the truth, none of these so called spices in western supermarkets even tingle my tastebuds.  It's crazy!  CARAZY!  Also, my knitting is coming along quite nicely, I think I should get the scarf done some time next week, maybe.  Yay!  My mom is back at work now, after a 4 week stint.  yay! I think she's off the drugs, so YAY! YAY!

      Again, today, I managed to stay awake for the whole day. Man, alertness is cool ;)  During first period not much happened except Ashley F. made some comment about me being funny or amusing, I couldn't really tell if it was genuine or a crack at me. It's hard you know... :p The funny part was when whenver she had a question I would quickly respond with a quick, high pitch answer and I'm sure that was annoying her... my bad :/ Just, the instructions were right there :p "# 2 ! ELECTROPHORESIS! WOOoOO!"   2nd period was some math problem on binomial theorem that we couldn't solve... yay! After that was the Rememberance Day ceremony. I said the first section and it all went pretty well except for Riaz's section. Oh my god, what a idiot, it's suppose to be a time of reflection and greif and this idiot reads Flanders Fields like it's some poem from 3rd grade. Yeah, let's BE HAPPY when we recite the poem and better yet, raise our voice at the end of sentences like we're in some sort of joy. What a joke. That kid is a fool.  Chem was horrid, Mercier said something about Hannah and I and I just neglected to listen like usual. heh. He said something about paying attention and teaching a lesson, but I think I retorted quietly with, "you teach? since when?". Chem's just a bitch.  The real kicker for today was that I learned how to knit. That's right Luke, I'm knitting, and as of this moment, my scarf is about 2-3 inches in. You better fear. For real. Hannah started it off for me, and taught me, the first couple rows were horrid as I missed stitches and things just turned out awry. But after a while I got the hang of it and it wasn't that bad. In fact, I began to like it. Seriously, knitting is like crack to me now, I can't stop. It's somewhat fun and calming at the same time. Weeee!     What else... hrmph.. English - boring. Uh, afterschool, Grade 8 Parent Night thingy. I used the remote starter to and fro, which was cool, as well as gave Riyaad a lift from the front of the school to the side of the school. Yay! I also talked to like 10 parents. 8 of them about knitting and 2 of them actually asked for real information. Like, IB stuff, I ended up telling them, it's the most insane program they could ever take, and unless they are prepared to make sacrafices in their social lives and extra cirriculars, they would never succeed in IB. I mostly sold IB as.. rather, didn't sale IB at all. I think I scared all of those parents away as well as their kids. They listend to me for a long time though, at least 15 minutes for both parents. I had long winded answers, elaborating on various points of views and etc. Maybe I did a good job... Maybe I didn't. But I did get a tour guide tag. Oh... some REALLY cute black kid was playing volleyball with us. He was PRETTY GOOD for a guy that was like 7 years old, he managed to hit the ball over every time and he made a HIT! A HIT, (with help from Chris G.) :/ Man, good night. Good Day.

        I've decided instead of using the blogger interface, that I'm going to just use Dreamweaver to type up my posts.     Why you may ask?    Because it's a hell of a lot easier. Easier in what way? Well, instead of searching for tags like I usually do, I can just click a few buttons here and there and everything is just nice and purty. That's right purty.    So let's stop talking about the website stuff, and move onto the nitty-gritty.    Today, was like every other day, oh wait, I actually stayed awake, yes,  fully conscious  for the entire day, that's right folks, ALL 5 PERIODS, I did not doze off once. That's a nice accomplishment. But, sadly, that non-dozing off streak ended at around 7 p.m. right after dinner, where I fell right into sleep. Couldn't do homework, 'cause I fell asleep, just fricking great. Luckily, my brother woke me up to watch the O.C. and boy, was that a good episode. It just gets better every episode! It's the best show ever.     Also, today, I bought the  urlLink Clarma  CD and it let's just say they are good. I like them. You should support them, they're music is pretty good, and they're pretty cool guys too. It's only 4 songs on the CD, but after talking to them for a while, I found out it costed them upwards of 2-3 grande to make the recording and the 1st and 2nd batch of CDs. That's pretty hardcore, and if anyone is hardcore, they deserve some credit. Buy their CD, support them ;)    Okay, another thing, I take challenges very seriously. Very Very Seriously. My current challenge is to learn how to knit. I'm going to own your ass Luke.    Uhm, whatelse, ah, Math Portfolio, looks much shorter than the last one, sigh, I hate these things though, so long, tedious and painfully boring. Bleh.    Riyaad got his G2. Way to pwnsors the roadsors Riyaad.    Dessert with Ruth on Thursday I hope. Can't let our friendship go to shit now. She did that eye blinding thing to me from behind today afterschool, I knew from that instant that it was Ruth, but to keep the whole thing going, I just got Ramy to give me clues :) That was fun... &quot;Whitest Girl You'll Ever Know&quot;... that was the last clue Ramy gave me... hah, man, that just made it EASY ;)     Uhm, I think that's everything for today. Maybe there's more, can't really remember...I keep forgetting to hand in my STAO form, I remembered, but couldn't find Ellis... sigh. I have to do some lame SAC afterschool thing tomorrow with parents or something... going to lame. We probably won't have a booth ready, because that's just the way it is... dun dun dun.. things will never change... oh. and Tupac, that guy is dead, and he has a new album and A MOVIE? That's ridiculous. Stop trying to reap money from his grave you stupid fagmos. Learn to let go. Uh... hmm.. oh Manh L. is cool. But then he went uncool. Very uncool. We stole the coach back from ACE and he was all up in it, and being retarded, because his logic was flawed in every way. The couch belongs to the SAC, and Ruth made a promise that she didn't want to earlier in the month. Along the lines of &quot;I'm never going to take the couch back from you guys&quot; What a fricken retard. Honestly, make promises that you actually want to keep. Duh. Arg

      I've added comments to the website.  Yay!  Now instead of using the dumbass tagboard, you can leave comments.    Uhm, whatelse, oh the archvies are still broken, I'm trying to fix it, but it's not working for some reason or another, but i'll get down to it eventually.  Also, Liz asked me why I hated her so much earlier, I don't really hate her, but rather, just dislike her.  I didn't have much to say after she apologized, I never do.  Meh, whatever.  Uhm.  What else... oh I found some code for the drop down menu, but it's rather complicated and I have no idea what I'm doing... it's going to be a while before I can implement it.  Also, I hate the current interface, it's so retarded, I'm going to make it centered and by browser percentage soon, cause I hate this shrinking business.  So if you're running on a resolution lower than 1024x7 whatever... YOU'RE SCREWED!  Leave a comment please, so I know it works ;)

      I wanted to go to START, but meh, work is more important to me at this point.  Work owns, seriously, it ownsors the bonesors.  On Friday, I drove Luke and Andrew thru the Wendy's drive thru and they ordered some stuff and it was pretty exciting, first time through a drive thru ;)  with me driving :).  When I dropped them off, and went to work, I had to parallel park, and being the second time I was alone and driving, I was scared shitless of parallel parking.  SO SCARED.  I was scared because if I get a ticket, get into an accident, or whatever, my insurance sky rockets by about 10 fold.  So, hence, SCARED. I didn't want to bump into any cars like Vanessa P.  (hahahahahah).  I had it all lined up and everything, but then I got really scared when I was reversing, because I didn't want to hit any cars, so I spent like 5 minutes moving, but in reality, not moving at all, because I was going back and forth, back and forth.  Meh, but one of the waiters, Nelson, so me in peril, and I asked if he could park my car for me, and he did.  Yep, I'm a panzy.  I did it perfectly in the G2 Test and in practice, but I can't do it in real life.  All theory and no practical use. that's me for ya.  The working part of Friday was good, it was light and easy, not too many people came for a Friday, and so I just was cruise control for the whole night.  On Saturday, my goodness, so many cool things happened.  Let's start off with this, since it's fresh off my mind:  I saw Phil R. at the Mandarin, he wasn't going to eat, he was waiting for one of the hostesses, and he had THIS REALLY REALLY SMOKING HOT BABE beside him.  Seriously, on the  Dan-O-Meter-of-Hotness , from 0-10, 10 being death by hotness, she was a 9.89.  My God.  So Hot.  So Hot.  She was white of course.  Hot.  OMG hot.  Like HOT.   Phil R., you're my hero .  CHOP DAT Phil, and if she's like your sister, co-worker, second cousin, or any cousin, or for some reason you can't change settings on your blender, HOOK ME UP.  PLEASE.  God, you're so cool.  Moreso than I.  Man, I should become a missionairy and be like Phil, 'cause clearly, Missionaries get all the babes.  For those who know me very very well, I don't sneeze through my nose like normal folk, I do like a cough-sneeze thing (thru the mouth, duh.)  And today, I SAW A PERSON DO THE SAME THING!  3 TIMES TOO! SO YOU KNOW IT WASN'T A FLUKE!  Yep, I'm not the only person who cough-sneezes!  She was hot too.  Man, I love the Mandarin, seriously, hot women all around.  Liz is no longer working at the Mandarin, she quit today.  *cheer* I gave her my MSN today too, she'll probably read this, and get very very upset and mad.  Oh well.   It's my blog, I don't lie.  RWAR!  Today, I owned all the dishwashers, all 4 of them in one fell swoop.  They were going really slow like always... and it really pisses me off, because the Managers get mad at us (busboys), because we don't replace the dishes fast enough outside, but we can't replace them because the washing people dont' wash them quick enough.    So, today, they were being REALLY slow, and K.C. (the boss/owner) asked me to help them.  I was placed in the sorting position...( there's ordering, (2) rinsers, and sorting).  So, for 2 hours, I was sorting like a man on a vengeance. I sorted faster than they could order/rinse, so there was no backup like usual.  On top of that, I was doing it without gloves, the plates were hot, but gloves slow you down, so I just did it with no gloves.  The first 10 minutes were painful, but after that, I wasn't feeling the burning/heat anymore.  Good ol callouses.  The best part was when K.C. said "Look at this kid, he's faster than of all you".  That made me felt good.  Damn Good.  I owned those bitches.  and when I was placed back into my normal duties, K.C. commented that I was "Very Professional and that I did a good job"  Owned.  EZ $$ IN THE BANK.  Seriously, I showed those bitches up and now they're performing better because of me.  Man, I own.  Also, my dad will be giving me the autostarter remote.  WOOT. I CAN START MY CAR WHEN I'm NOT IN IT! That's cool.  Idling causes pollution, but whatever, I like a warm car that works rather than a cold car that might break :p

       Here was my plan:   -Get into Engineering (Electrical, System Design, Mechanical) at Waterloo. -Do co-op for 4 non-consecutive semesters. -Hopefully gain enough skills/experience from those co-op opportunities to make a decent resume. -Get an entrance level positition at some robotics, vehicle, computer company, making 40-50 k a year.  That was my plan, it seemed like it would be the most probable route for me. Now, some guy, from  urlLink RCC College of Technology , told us (being my chem class) that my plan was shit, and that I was going to fail. Thanks buddy, you made my day great.  (Please note the sarcasm).  He made a pretty convincing presentation about how university students didn't get jobs and even if you think you're program is any 'more' specialized than any other, it isn't the case, because most university programs don't teach you practical skills.  So he got me thinking, and he told me I couldn't remember the website, but I did.  Guess who's wrong now?  I checked out the website, and checked out the University Articulation thing, where it's basically how a college student can enter into a 3rd/4th year Engineering program.  I looked at it, and then I looked at the universities that offered this.  Lakehead, Brock, Memorial.. just to name a few.  What a crock.  He made it sound like I could get a Engineering degree from like Waterloo or Toronto.  Bunch of crock indeed.    He was very very bitter during his presentation and he kept saying how people didn't have jobs and whatnot, and he had facts to prove it, maybe, I will be part of the statistic of graduates who don't find a job in their field, but I don't care.   I'll do what I want, and when I want.     Actual school, was uneventful... I'll give you a breakdown:   Biology:  Learnage.  IB Math:  Nothing.  I did like 2 questions in 75 minutes.  Chemistry:   RCC homotron who was very bitter.  Lunch:  People just kept disappearing, and I kept shuffling over.  English:   A surpisingly hard 1 and 1/2 page reading comprehension test.  After school:  Knitage and Alex Blackburnage.  He's so cool, he had this rad acrylic painting with him, looked pretty bad ass.  On another note, work was pretty boring, aside from the fact, that it went by really fast.  Which was great.  Also, Peter, is no longer a busboy, he's a bartender, lucky him.  I wish I was the son of the CEO/President/Owner/Creator of the Mandarin franchise.  Bleh, he has so much power :p  Oh, he had his Celica today, haha Luke.

       Who does that?  The lowest of the low.   Who fits this category?   My biology class.  I wouldn't say my whole biology class.  Just more or less Slavica.  Possibly even the people around her.  Well, let me explain.  As all the bio students are well aware, we had our Electrophoresis Lab due on Thursday, due to some circumstances and various other tests, and assignments in other classes, Slavica asked for an extension on Tuesday.  No big deal, one day extension, doesn't make a difference to me really.  So I let that go, pretty easily.  Now Thursday rolls around, and guess what? She askes for  another  extension.  Wait, did I say that correctly?  Because, I'm pretty damn sure, asking for extensions  twice  is pretty damn wrong.    Everyone knows Crawford is a push over, but come-on.  This is ridiculous.  Fucking ridiculous.  You asked for an extension and you got both, what the fuck more do you want?  My god, stop taking advantage of Crawford you fuckwads.  Now, I'm not saying I'm not grateful, for sure, I'm grateful for Slavica "persuasiveness" but, there's a line, and it's been crossed.  How many assignments has she postponed for us?  I dunno,  too fucking many .  I planned to have this night reserved for doing my Lab, but since it's due on Monday, I really don't feel like doing it anymore.    On top of that, what's happening is wrong, Crawford isn't helping us by postponing due dates, because next year, due dates will never be postponed, you either meet them or you don't.  All this is doing, is insinuating the notion that "begging for marks" works.  In most cases, it won't.  But for everytime it does, it's a bullet wound  to what academics is about and what fairness is about.  Right now, the other bio class, Ellis' class, is most likely working on their lab.  And here's me blogging about how I'm  not  writing it.  This is a joke.  Really, school is a joke.

      Today was an early release so the following good things happened: 1. no chemistry. 2. leave school at 11:30. 3. drove my car around with people inside.  So, I have a habit of not driving well when there's many people in the car, I dunno, I just feel like I don't have to care as much.  :p So, you should really think about which car you want to get in if there's ever going to be a carpool and I'm involved.  You see today, I think I did like 20 illegal things, and there were at least 5 incidents where I could have caused accidents.  1. With Andrew, Josh, Luke and Aaron in the car, I sped down Steeles and had to make a right turn into the plaza, but I was going kinda fast, so I had to jam the breaks to stop in time.  Man, it was sooooo KICKASS, I was like 1 foot away from hitting the car, you could hear the ABS breaks.  Man, it was cool.  Never doing that again though.  2. After leaving Wendy's I drove without looking at the road, I turned around and just looked at Josh for a while, while the car was still moving.  Everyone got scared.  haha :p  It wasn't like a quick glance either, I turned around for at least a full 5-6 seconds.  3. I went towards a bend in the road with no hands, and let the car drift into the oncoming traffic lane, at which point I pulled back really fast, givin the car a swift jolt to the left.  That also scared everyone.  4.  With them STILL in the car, on teh way to Luke's house, I purposely ran a Stop sign with a car coming the other way, and cut him off.  Har.  When we got to Luke's we played Jitz and it was pretty equally matched, between us.  Then we went into 1v1, and Aaron owned it as he became the Champion of the World, then the Champion of the Universe, but luckily, Josh defeated him in the battle for the alternate universe. Wooo Josh!  I then picked up Steve from the Mandarin and gave him a lift to his house, and tried to convice Christie to come.  I invited her on the behalf of Luke, but she didn't believe me :0, Meh, I tried.  Luke isn't up on the inter-slicing these days.  After that, I decided to drive like a normal person.  Nothing match happened after that.  Dropped off a doctor's note at the HRDC for my mom and did some knitting.  I'm really sick, like I know that I'm horrendously sick and look sick, BUT, I don't feel sick.  I just feel tired.  I don't feel like crap, at all, I feel like I'm on top of a lot of things and so I feel great.  But look like crap :/  Yeah I think I have that  urlLink new flu,  and so the flu shot did nothing :/  Argh.  Stupid cough.    Also, I'm really excited about  urlLink World of Warcraft .  Can't Wait. AH!!@!@!@!

      even I don't know...  I believe it's my unique (if you can call it that) personality.  I tend to just write about anything that seems somewhat interesting.  I know the last blog wasn't too interesting to anyone who isn't up and running with online gaming, but Online Gaming is probably one of my biggest hobbies and biggest curses.  I waste so much time playing video games, it's sad.     Why do I play games?   I haven't really though about it much, until recently, but I think it's the escape and the feeling of superiority.  I'm good at video games, really good at some.  Something that I excel at I guess with little or no effort.  It's the fantasy of it all, being something you're not and being good at it, it's really a rush, for me anyway.  I guess that's what separates me from a person that's not into video games, I absorb myself into the game, as if I was actually a part of it.  I dunno, that's all I got, I over-analyze a lot of things, this is probably one of them.  The other day, I think it was Sunday, I had my very first dream in like 3 years that I could remember.  I was on a boat, like a cruise boat, but it was jet black, maybe a freighter.  There were people everywhere, partying, having a good time, and we were about to dock at Turner Fenton.  (Don't ask, Turner happened to be at the end of the pier)  So, the boat was coming into the pier, and I was standing on the deck, looking at the school.  The boat was coming in way to fast to stop in time, and we (me and the hundreds of people on the boat) started to brace ourselves for the incoming crash.  The boat started rocking left and right, and the deck started to crumble onto the lower level and so in a act of self-preservation, I climbed onto the railing and jumped 2 or 3 feet up into the air to reach some guy wires.  I ended up grabbing onto the wire and hang on for dear life as the boat started to tilt foward.  The front of hull came crashing foward toward the school, and I started to go foward also.  I ended up falling infront of the crashing hull as it came down and crushed several hundred innocent bystanders.  I got up, dusted my self off, and ran into the school, screaming for help.  I ended up running past about 20 people running in the other direction, until I finally saw Ruth, Lisa, Erin and Leslie.  I screamed at them, asking for help, but they couldn't hear me or something, but Ruth was crying, Lisa and Erin were talking like nothing happened and Leslie just sat there.  Then it ended.  What does it all mean?  I dunno.  You tell me.  The video dance.  I never supported it, and never will, but will I be doing stuff for it? yes.  Will I still be selling tickets? yes.    I pwned my Bio test today, except for a few MC questions here and there and maybe 1 or 2 FiB or T/F.  I didn't fail the previously mentioned math test, in fact I got exactly 50% on it.  heh.  Brown kids in Chemistry are very very stupid.  Yeah, let's plagerize! WOOoo! What idiots.  English, I feel asleep in when I was given 30 mins to read a passage.  I ended up sleeping for about 15 mins, and read the thing in the last 15 mins.  Nothing much really.

      In the gaming world, over the past week, about a dozen or so people in the world became jedis.  After about 4 months of nonstop, 5 hour per day gaming, a few dozen people were luckily enough to become Jedis in  urlLink Star Wars Galaxies .  Consequently, the game itself (Sony) has put bounties on these persons, much like the storyline of Star Wars.  So, players (bounty hunters), qv Boba Fett, are now able to kill other players Jedi Initiates, for exhorbintant amounts of cash.     All I'm pointing out is, that people who've played basically nonstop for the past 4 months to get "Jedi" status are now being hunted.  Hah.  They're only allowed 3 deaths before their characters die permenantly.  So it's pretty harsh.  See in the above picture, a group of 14 people hunted a single Jedi.  Overkill? pretty much so, but it's Sony's way (Vader's) of keeping the Jedi population, which has uber powers, down. Ingenious? maybe.    Personally, gaming wise, I'm looking foward to  urlLink World of Warcraft .

      Normally, I wouldn't use the word 'nigger' but after what happened on Friday, I'm going to use it more often.  Let me elaborate before you judge me:  On Friday, afterschool, after I failed my math test, after I had an interesting conversation with David C and his "habits" (I'll let you extrapolate what that means), I was sitting in the SAC office.  Rather, lieing down.  I was talking to Riyaad, and he left to find Abdulla & Steve P. and soon after, Abdulla showed up, asking where Riyaad was.  Nonetheless, Riyaad had already started his run, and Abdulla ran by himself.  After that, I just sat in the SAC office for a while and moulded with Ruth S. and Danelle A.  After some time, two black kids just happened to walk in and sit down.  One of them, I already knew, he's the annoying, impolite, jackass one.  I'm sure we've all seen him before, he's the 5'1" short black kid, who's tiny and yet, has an ego the size of Russia.  Anyway, I really didn't mind their company at first, because they weren't doing much.  But after about 30 seconds, the annoying one, started commenting on the music that was being played inside the SAC.  I think at that time, it was Three Days Grace, or some other rock/punk band, and he started saying phrases like "Who listens to dis crap?", "Dis music so shitty", "I axed you a kestion, why you play dis music?"  Danelle and Ruth were sitting around, and I was mocking them aloud.  The guy had a really nerdy laugh, so I kept immitating it.  And when he said a joke, no one laughed, but I waited for the awkward silence, and threw in a fake laugh.  At first, he got angry since I was making fun of him, and then his insults escalated when he started talking about Abdulla, who happened to return.  He then told me to shut up, as I continued to mock him, he then followed with "Shut the F up" and mumbled fuck quietly soon after.  I pointed out he was afraid to curse, and then he cursed more loudly.  What a panzy.  He then grabbed our telephone and made some call, to his 'mom' he said.  He then told me to talk to his 'mom'.  I asked him what his last name was, and RUth told me what it was, but I can't remember it now, but for story sake, let's name him, Johnson.  I picked up the phone, said "Hello? Is this Ms. Johnson?" where the lady said "No, this is Mary Spencer (not the actual name, I forgot it already)" where I said "Oh, I'm terroribly sorry, the person who patched me through, must of made a mistake, sorry for wasting your time."  Of course the fuckwad didn't call his mom, I then insulted his ass for being so stupid and making crank calls is just retarded, and such and such, which in the end, got me no where.  At this point, Danelle left to tutor some kid, Ruth and I were both asking them politely to leave, as they were unwanted.  But it just got worse after that.  The nigger was pointing out how poorly dressed Abdulla was, (it isn't his fault, he was wearing his running clothes and such).  But he was saying shit about how his shoes were from Payless, when in reality they were from S'il Vous Plait or something, but he kept insulting Abdulla, his clothes, and then XC.  Which they had no clue what it was.  I got fucking pissed at this point, and I just told them " Why don't you just lift your black asses off those chairs, take them home, sit them down, turn on your TV, and watch your B-E-T. Because honestly, that's all you fucking kids do."  He replied with, "That's right! BLACK ENTERTAINMENT TELEVISION, WHAT!" and his pal agreed and nodded.  He then went on to insult Chinese people, with "Chinese peoples these days.." and I sware to god I heard him say "Chink".  I was about to get up and fucking impale him with my knitting needles.  When I heard the word "Chink"  I just looked at Ruth, and gave her the look of "if these fuckwads don't leave soon, I'm going to kill them"  Of course, Ruth, knew what was going through my mind, and so she acted, since she's black, she has immunity.  Bleh :p She started with something nice like, "please leave" and it ended with "It's you FUCKING NIGGERS THAT GIVE THE REST OF US BLACK PEOPLE A BAD RAP" "SO GET YOUR BLACK ASS ON OUT OF HERE" she then kept berating them which the annoying kid started to stutter and cower away.  Once he got outside the room, he tried to insult Ruth by commenting on his clothes, which at that point, I just started laughing at his sadness.  Then we shut the door in his face and locked it.  His friend was still there, but he was somewhat polite, and wasn't as rude and stupid.  He left as soon as his friend left, heh, I wonder why they're friends...  Anyway, the story probably doesn't actually portray how rude this nigger was, but it at least is an attempt.  Ruth can probably tell the story better... ask her in person.  Ruth S. btw. :p

      [rant]  One of the rules that I promised I would follow when I created my blog will be broken at this very moment.  I promised myself that I wouldn't say anything about my immediate friends, unless it was something funny, entertaining or a joke, generally not serious stuff about my friends.  And so, I guess that's out the window.  In reply to Sunny's Blog:  Because indirectly, his most recent blog attacks me, and so I must respond.  (I love that, sounds like we're at war)  I'm pretty guilty of a few things you said.  But I'd like to say the following:  I don't want to get laid from some random chick in the next few years.  I'm looking for a girlfriend because what, you want me looking for a boyfriend?  Right... Okay the response was a bit defensive, let's get a real response out of me. I have things that I don't even right in my blog, and I want to share them, but I rather share them with someone that I trust and care about and vice-versa.  I don't think I've ever had any conversation with anyone with the opposite sex that was remotely intelligent, emotional or caring except for that one time with Sandra.  This is what I want.  Not because of all of the other lame ass things from it.  That's why I want a girlfriend, getting laid is merely a secondary benefit.  You believe that a special someone will come along and ASK YOU OUT? please.  That's not going to happen.  Me (and my male counterparts) are looking for girlfriends because why? We need the company.   And did they just twiddle their thumbs and and let fate guide them?  No.  I believe Josh and JP have girlfriends on both of their own doings.  Not because it  just happened out of the blue .  Things don't just happen, you (me, I, my male counterparts) make them happen.  Did you just wakeup one day and was like, "Holy shit, I have a girlfriend now? and it's Andrea" ?  I don't check out girls.  But I can decide within about 30 seconds of talking of whether or not they interest me in anyway.  Whipped thing i totally agree with, but I'll keep doing it, not because of what you said, but because it gets a few laughs out of everyone, and that's all that really matters.   "Know the difference between being whipped, and caring about someone so much that you'd do anything for them, honestly"   They are one in the same.  The only reason you would do anything for anyone else, is because you care, otherwise what would be the point in doing it?  [/rant.]  In truth, I just wanted to defend myself, not attack Sunny.

      Friday:   STAO:    -  Early yet again, waited a while, knitting for a while, left first again.  My people are somewhat prompt at least.. yay!  -  Free stuff.  Glowing Pens and other pens by the dozen.  -  Some jobs were boring but other than that, pretty fun, we also had walkie talkies, that was cool.  -  Brett got ecto-donto-something surgery, and basically they stitched new teeth or something into Brett the day before.  So he couldn't eat food that was hard, cold, warm or had a pH.  Sucks for him.  He managed to tough it through, he's a trooper.  -   Jaclynn commented on how I should have been in Cabaret... woo 1337 compliment, and then I explained I don't do scripted-funny, I'm sorta spontaneous, punchline funny.  -  The best part of the day had to be when I was with Jaclynn L.  Oh my god.  So funny.  So hilarious, she's so god damn funny it's crazy.  We were sitting at the hospitality table, and out of sheer bordem, we started waving at random people.  Genius.  We got some weird looks, and we laughed at alot of people because of that, and then some people waved back, that made us laugh even harder.  But the best part was, when someone came up to us, asking us if  WE knew THEM .  SO FUNNNY, we laughed so hard for 15 seconds, the lady got really confused, we quickly apologized right after, and we told her the whole story of how we're incredibly bored, and that, we don't really know you(her) at all and that we were really sorry.  She was so nice too, we felt kinda bad, but it was so funny.  -  After that, Jaclynn and I started doing some more crazy things, like we made a sign that said "Ask Us A Question" and then another sign that said "Anything... really... ANYTHING!"  And some random teacher's came up and asked us a bunch of questions.  It was a lot of fun, some guy asked us like 15 or so joke questions/puns and we were kinda speechless.  And someone asked me what the meaning of life was to which I replied " What  isn't  the meaning of life?" and Jaclynn said "Happiness" which is also true :)  Yeah, she's a cool gal.  -  Yes, I said gal.  -  End of the day, I drove Luke and these two asian girls from Gr.10.  They were  soooooo  annoying.  They kept touching my headrest and punching my seat.  That's when I got really pissed.  So you know what I did?  I scared the living shit out of them.  Going at around 70, I swung the car left and right, left and right 2 or 3 times and that shut them up.  Kudos to insane driving skills.    Workage:    -  Same stuff.  Peter didn't show up for work, no one really cared, he can do anything and no one would stop him.  -  Ruth S. wasn't there, so I had 1 less person to talk to.  -  But the other Ruth was there, and we talked, so it wasn't bad.  -  Confirmation on a bunch of things, I'm going to be a Waiter starting Dec 20th.  Sweet. and also the Mandarin Christmas Party is on the 25th, and I can invite significant others.  So that's double sweet.  I asked about what did they meant by significant others and they replied with, for you: Your family and your girlfriend.  So... if anyone wants a free meal on Christmas (the 25th)... drop me a line.  (FEMALE PREFEREBLY)  okay I'm not  that  desperate.

      I'm going to Blog 3 times in a row, all in the same hour.  Each with different content on different subjects. So prepare.  On Thursday I was typing this very blog.  Then I went unconscious.  Okay.. I really  didn't  go unconscious, but I don't remember a single thing except that the last thing I did was typing in this blog, and then I woke up, and never posted/published.  WTF~!  Maybe I got drugged, or I took too much cough medicine... bleh.  Okay, Thursday was fun stuff, I woke up at 5 AM, got to school by 6:10, waited for 20 minutes (being early is pointless if everyone else will be late) and within those 20 minutes I added about 8 more rows to my scarf, and then people started showing up, luckily all my people showed up first, and so I left first.  Got to the International something hotel first, and then we did a lot of moving and lifting up stairs, and lots and lots of directing.  I love directing people, it's so fun.  We also got these kickass canary yellow T-shirts.  They even have the even more kickass STAO emblem.  Kickassciry at its fineness.  Okay, I'm exaggerating, nothing is  that  kickass.  But still, kickass it was.  In truth, I enjoyed a lot of the helping-random-people, that was a lot of fun.  We(being Hannah and I) met some really really cool teachers, and professionals, she luckily, got to meet the Global Weather Guy, and me... well nothing.  But together, we met some really cool teachers, and this One really really really cool teacher, who was named Naiomi (I can't spell), and imagine a cross between Ms. Kowalska and Mr. Ellis in female form.  Ms. Kowalska's down the earth and sarcasticness, combined with Ellis' niceness and coolness.  Not looks btw, by character.  I love making up words.  Anyway, yeah, all in all it was fun, free pizza, and helping people.  I really enjoy helping people.  That's why I like work so much.  Also, on the way back home, after I dropped everyone off, I almost hit a car...  I was waiting at the left turn signal at Bramalea and Steeles, and I was way back in the turn lane, so it took about 4 rotations before I could get to the front area, where I could actually turn, and by that time, I was bored as hell and zoned out, so I was like staring at the car infront of me.  Completely zoned out, I didn't notice that I let go of the break slightly, so I started creeping foward, incredibly slow, like so minute I couldn't even tell, about like 5 cm per second.  Because I was zoned out, I wasn't paying attention until I was like, uhmm... why is my car so close to that car's license plate... I thought I was like 2 fee... HOLY CRAP.... Jammed on breaks.  That was close. :p

      As I just woke up from my nap, missed, Gilmour Girls and the OC, bleh.. probably for the better and revisited the WoW website for the 20 bajillion-th time today, I started thinking.    It started with the award thing, and now it's progressed to something much more.  I started recalling the conversation that ensued in Pop Culture, on the habits of a certain individual in tests and the like.  To put it bluntly, this person cheats at every opportunity she has.  And honestly,  I feel cheated .  As a peer, as a student, it's grossly unfair to me and everyone around me who doesn't cheat.  Cheating is just the utter disregard for the sanctity and integrity that is the body of Academics.    In all my life, I don't think I've ever felt so strongly about something, maybe it's the fact that I just woke up and haven't gained all my senses yet, but this really bothers me.  It's something that can't be changed so easily as it's on the cheater that the responsibility falls upon.  But, it seems unfair to me, that she never suffers any consequence.  Never.  Well, it could be possible that the inevitability of failure will strike her hard in the future, or some could say her personal life is a sham, but to me, when I'm in a classroom behind a desk and in front of a teacher, the trust shouldn't be broken.  These on-going shannigans need to be rectified.    My past history with this individual is merely that of me helping her, and never recieving anything in return, and in the last several years, that relationship has been severed and broken.  But as I know look from the outside, individuals around her suffer the same fate that I did, they(I) are(was) being used.  She's a parasite.  A leech that sucks on the goodness of the host, until the host realises that such a thing is latched on, the continue abuse of friendship is for the lack of a better term "biomagnified" -  increasing greatly over time.   It's sad, it's wrong and  I'm  going to fix this.  In the past, apathy has plagued me, and probably many of my peers.  The utter lack of disinterest and sheer laziness, has probably prevented many things from occuring in my lifetime as well as others.  Cheating, however, is something different.   Why doesn't anyone do anything?   It's probably seen as something common and acceptable maybe even good.  As it makes me, feel good, it makes us feel good, that we, morally, are better than that.  Maybe I'm just pulling on strings that don't exist.  Who knows.  Maybe it's the secret covenant that every student abides by once they enter the school, "Don't rat on anyone, ever".  Maybe that's it.  Maybe it's the fear, that if you actually do this, you might ruin someone else's life. Maybe it's just indifference.  Maybe it's the feeling of futility, that even if you  do  do something, nothing ever will change.  I really don't know the answer to my question, but I do know, if I don't act, I'll feel like this forever.  I'm tired of being a victim, I'm tired of being a pedestrian, I'm tired of just watching.   Aren't you tired?   If the answer is  yes , do something then.  If it is  no , then you're just part of the problem, part of the flaw, part of the imperfection.  The system is in place to work, every now and then, it gets faults and cracks because individuals find that single flaw and bore into it with little remorse.  These cracks enlarge, but only to a certain point, as it can get no worse.  But, it does, you see, you're merely the ice the freezes and thaws, that expands these faults.   You  make it worse,  you  increase the gap and  you  inevitably are no better than the intial cause itself.  On Monday, I'm going to find Crawford, talk to him, and give him my two cents.   You don't have to listen to me, I'm not your mother, I'm not even a person of great intellect, I don't expect you or anyone to actually act.  I'm not here to convince you of anything, I'm here just to bring light to situation.  Make your own opinions, don't base everything on other's.  Please don't do anything you don't want to, as these are merely  my  feelings, and I'm just trying to convey them.    Thanks for reading.

      I found out today, that I am suppose to get a Physics Award.   Yes ME.  ME!!!!!!!!!   I clearly had the highest mark, and what happened?  Mercier.     You know, I hate him because he can not teach, nor can he remember names.  Now, it's 10 fold worse.  That jackass, can't even remember my name.  WHAT THE HELL IS THAT? He gave the award to Aaron T, 'cause he thought he was me, 'cause he's a fucking biggot.  He's #1 on my list now.  Van Ingin gets bumped to 3, while the fool who stole my lanyard is sitting at #2.  Argh, so mad.  Although this is all based on  unconfirmed  information, but still.  It's a pretty safe bet.  Speaking of other failures, the DVD player borked on us and hence we could not bathe in the glory of the Animatrix.  Too bad :(  But, we did get to hear about the above scandal and had really entertaining conversations.  Honestly, I think we're the coolest people in the world.  I went to Arby's for the first time today, Greg bought me a sandwhich and some curly fries, which I though was really generous of him.  He really didn't have to.  We talked about all our crazy driving experiences as we munched on beef and fries.  Mmmm curly fries.  They have really good curly fries, but the beef sandwhich could have used some mayo, or some sauce, any sauce would be nice, it was bland like plain rice.  Yesterday, my MSN  DELETED CONTACTS , for no reason.  Well, I was trying to reorganize them, and about 10 or 12 people got deleted.  So if you read my blog, msg me ASAP so I can add you back, just incase I deleted you.  I think I deleted you Greg :/  Oh, I missed OC, going to watch it tonight, sacrafice Gilmour Girls for OC.  My brother already ruined a part of it for me...     SPOILER ALERT          He said what's his face's father is gay.  Damn it.  Only 2 hours to go and he had to say something like that.  Bleh

      except:   MSN is teh borks.  Meaning Broken.   urlLink 24  is kick ass.   I saw Mike B. and Emma making out in the AV office.  Let's just say, I was quivering and in a state of panic.  I think I almost fainted too.  Quite the disturbing image... and think about it...  it's burned into MY head .  The reason I saw them was so I could get my SAC binder back which I left there prior day.  So, when I was walking towards the office I noticed the lights were on, so I peered through the window... and low and behold... *shiver*Good thing they didn't see me, because I ran away like a baby after seeing that. :p   US First, is honestly so rag-tag. I got to be the stand in Web Head. Yay! I don't think Swan or Kiki or whatever, gives two shits about it really, he showed up late, and he wasn't showing any interest about it either.  What a nubtar.    STAO errr STOA! Woooh 2 days of  NO school!    Hannah commented on the fact that I drive slow. pfft.  I was feeling like obeying the "law" today.  I dropped her off at her apartment, the security guard was a cool guy, he made a nice comment when he opened the little bar thingy.   Greg Wright.. or maybe Right... was a black kid that wanted a refund for a dance ticket, he waited for quite some time because we didn't have any change except 20's.  He was very patient.  I was quite impressed, that he could actually stand there and not make some remark like "Yo, why yous be keepin' me so long?".  I was even more impressed when I found out he was a friend of Junior Bailey.   Obsessed with  urlLink World of Warcraft

      Between Sunday and Today, I think i've gotten like 9 hours of sleep total.  I think 7 was between Sunday morning and my barber's appointment and 2 between this morning and showering.  I ended up procrastinating like no one's business, and I ended up having to do my electrophoresis lab and as well read 2 John Steinbeck books.  Argh, I spent around 8 hours doing the lab, between like 9ish to about 4AMish on Sunday.  That sucked.  I decided that I wouldn't read the two books and wing my ass off when my English conference was around.  Luckily my  karma points  came in handy.  I ended up doing a pretty good job on my lab, I'd think, I hope... and my English conference wentlike a breeze.  I made up everything, with speed-reading the first couple and last couple of chapters of each book.  I think Snowden really likes me, but thinks I don't apply myself to the fullest potential, which is pretty much the truth :p. WOooOO Go  Karma!   Unluckily, someone stole my lanyard.  That's right, my lanyard.  Oh My God.  What kind of poor ass mofo has to steep that low?  The jackass, whoever it may be, stole my lanyard from the Library computer rack thing.  Jesus, the fool took my lanyard along with my Jedi Master pass, and my bright blue LED.  Damn it, those were gifts from JP which I liked too.  Argh.  Whoever stole my LED is going to get a swift ass kicking by me if I see them have it.  Oh, I would ring his neck and give him the beating of his life.  I hope I see this kid tomorrow.  Then karma decided for my ID card to end up in Ruth S's hands and which I got my ID card back like 30 minutes later. so WOoo!  Then, after my SAC meeting and STOA meeting, I went to the AV office to play some games, we (Sunny, Riyaad and I) only played a short while 'cause Riyaad had to leave, and because of that, I left my SAC binder in the office.  By the time I realised this,  it was way too late.  Damn Karma. :p  I then went to go to the Doctor's at the Bramelea Medical Centre or whatever, and in the parking lot, I had to make a really sharp right turn, because some guy was backing up way too wide, and another guy was coming in the other direction, which would have boxed me in between the two cars.  So, I made the turn a  little  too sharp, and ended up getting the lower right fender thing, up on the curb.  Man, the sound of metal on concrete was not cool.  Not cool at all.    Afterwards, I went inside, and knit like maybe a dozen or two rows onto my scarf while in the waiting room.  Pretty kick ass, I was going faster and faster.  Wooo!  I talked to my doctor about being sick, and I think he just ignored me completely as he prescribed antibiotics...  which I DON'T NEED  and some next medicine,  WHICH I DON'T NEED EITHER , and when I asked him about my wrists, he said "You can move them in all sorts of direction right? Without Pain?"  Where I responded with "Yes" he said then, "Your wrists are fine"  Where I insisted that this constant cracking "Is not fine, and not normal"  But hten he kept saying that my wrists are fine, because I can move them and rotate freely.  What a dumbass.  I hate doctors, they don't know jack squat.  Then when I was waiting for my ever so useless prescription cough syrup and decongestive pills, a Russian.. maybe Polish, but I'd like to think the former, commented on my knitting. WOooh! Compliment! From a stranger!  Yeah also, when she talked to her mother (in Russian) she sounded very abrasive and mean, but when she was talking to me in English, oh my god, her voice was so soft and nice.  Crazy!  CARRAAAAAAAZY!

      Here's a quote from Adeel's blog:   What is it though? Anyone who ever says "I'm so depressed and I don't even know why" is obviously lying or doesn't think much. My reasons? Sheer boredom over the past couple of days, fatigue, boredom from not eating (believe me; two more), my religious and faith-based inadequacies, and, yes,  probably the lack of a girlfriend , although that is not to say that I need or want one per se, just that I feel the lack of that perfect person. I don't really think it compares to how we always made fun of Azim, mercifully   I bolded the important part for me.  I instantly remembered one thing last night.  Sandra told me I needed a girlfriend.  That I needed someone to occupy my time, because I think/analyze too much otherwise.  It's the truth.    And by frequenting Adeel's and Greg's and my blog, I've noticed that we're all the same really.  Could be good.. could be bad... who knows.

      I'll start off chronologically.  I would have posted earlier, but I got home at like 5 AM and just hit the sack pretty hard.  On Friday, I forgot to mention in the previous post, that I had to bark like a dog on all fours.  Yeah, at work, Ruth and Ruth.  hah.  Took my name tag and I was about to start work and I needed my name tag back.  Meh, we ended up wrestling for it and stuff, and ended up hurting Ruth (which one?! :p) and then I just felt really bad so I stopped with the agressiveness.  We ended up just standing at the lockers for a while, until we finally agreed that I could get it back if I barked like a dog on all fours in the cafeteria place.  Which I did.  Meh, I got my nametag back ;)  On Saturday, work was soooooooooooooooooooo slow.  Oh, i also upchucked in the back.  As I was tossing some garbage out, I was coughing prefusively and ended up with alot of flem caught in my throat.  I tried to collect some of it so I could spit it out, 'cause it was pissing me off.  So, I tried collecting it but there was so much I ended up gagging on it.  Yeah. GAGGING.  Luckily, my trusty gag reflex kicked in within half a second and I puked up alot of flem and some orange pulp.  Mmmmm.  Yeah, and right now, I have this crazy headache.  Going to see the doctor on Monday though.. so YAY!  Whatever, so on Sunday, at midnight of Sat or whatever, I was at Sandra's house after work.  Gabe, Jasmine, and a bunch of Sandra's friends were there and I really didn't get to meet anyone, 'cause they all left like 10 minutes after I arrived.  Eh, we ended up watching Finding Nemo, which I haven't seen btw, and I ate some really sweet Loblaw's cake.  MMmm Loblaw's.  After everyone left, it was just Jasmine and Sandra and me, and I was forced to listen to some J-Pop, K-pop, C-pop and other bleh music.  Although Sandra does really know how to play the piano, pure ownage.  Yeah, I think Jasmine left at like 1 AM and I just stuck around for a while, because driving there felt like I waste if I were to leave so soon.  Yeah, we ended up playing some Crazy Eight Countdown for a while to waste time and eat popcorn.  Then we got into a game about where the person who picks the highest card gets to ask the other person anything they want.  Kinda like truth or dare, but without the dare!  It started off bland and boring, the first 20 or so questions were like "What's your favourite colour?" or " If you were stuck on a deserted island what would you bring...etc etc".  Then near the end, it got really got good I'd think.  The questions didn't matter, because we just talked  a lot .  We talked about so many things, about ourselves, about each other, about friends, family, life, love, hate, trust.  It was good.  I wished I had more talks like that.  I think that's the first time I've ever sat down, let myself be open and just talked.  It felt great.  Surprisingly, we ended up talking for about 4 hours, as I left around 4:45 and got home around 5 AM.  Man, it was crazy the drive back.  The roads were completely empty, I was going down Dixie (a 70 zone) at around 110.  It was fucking great.  I loved it so much.  But my eyes were burning 'cause I was dead tired.  Oh man.  Such a good learning experience that night was.  I feel, I dunno.... so  relieved .    Then when I woke up, I went to my barber's and got a hair cut, and bought this 12 dollar bottle of gel that I probably wouldn't use.  It's grey (the bottle) and the type is called "Form Lotion", I can't remember the company, but it's my favourite gel so far.  It's a good gel. Argh, this headache is killing me.  Bleh.  Yeah.  That's all I got.  Laters.

      Still sick, and I hate it.  I can't hear properly out of left ear, my nose is runny and I have an itchy throat.  Bleh.  Today, turned out pretty good, I learned about the astrophysics of the univerise from Doc Z and he explained to us/me various things about the comic radiation constant and the expansion of the unvierse and some other stuff that I can't seem to remember right now.  The funny part of today, is how I ended up volunteering for wrestling when I didn't even sign up.  I came to school today, thinking it was going to be boring w/o certain people at lunch at stuff, but then I miraculously ended up volunteering anyway.  It's fate I tell ya.  Riyaad went skiing today, Mike Brolley conveniently decided not to attend school today, Phil Reimer is co-oping like usual so, there was no one here today to do AV.  *gasp*  So, Aaron C. and Jason needed someone to help setup the AV equipment so they ran around the school looking for Riyaad.  They ended up getting me to help, so as fate has it, ended up helping out with the AV.  After I set that thing up, Drivakos asked me to guard the doors.  I didn't really do too well of a job, but nonetheless I was asked to help out.  I stayed the whole day doing draw mastering, and ended up missing math, chemistry, and english.  Also got some free pizza, which was a score!  Then after 6 hours of watching tonnes of groping, I went to do some more volunteering by doing volleyball lines for junior girls.  Did that, watch them smoke the other team, and then I spent like maybe 1 hour playing 2 on 2 volleyball with Luke, Mr. Forest and Tony.  It was really really fun.  WooOOooo!  Then, went back to wrestling, did some more stuff, then went to Cabaret!  I came in late 'cause I had to move all the AV equipment from the gym back to the AV office and so I missed the first skit.  So, I had to watch the first section from the backstage, which wasn't that bad, it was surprisingly funny, although it wasn't as good as last year's or the year's before that one.  I couldn't go to one in grade 9 i think, my car battery broke that night so I couldn't get there.  Heh.  The second half was even better, goodar to the maxar.  Here's the even more exciting part, I got into my first spot check today!  Woah!  I was going down Steeles, and the police blocked off the road completely so you were forced to turn into the GO station, where there were about a dozen cops checking cars and asking if you drank.  I was a bit scared, being my first time, I didn't know what to do.  I pulled up to the last police officer, and he asked me "How are you doing?" where I said "fine." and then he proceeded to ask me "Did you have anything to drink?" then I said "No" and he handed me a coupon book, If you Drink Don't Drive.  Then I got lost in the GO station parking lot and almost missed the exit :p  Yeah, now i'm watching the VGA.  Looks pretty boring.  And them getting Jenna Jameson and the like = good marketing, but bad everything else. :p

      In a  urlLink concuring  fashion, I'll have to agree that  urlLink The O.C.  is the best show on this year.  It's even better than Gilmore Girls sadly.  Oh well, I will also be making references to this week's show (sorry Andrea).  Today, I woke up, and was like, holy shiat. It's snowing.  So, being somewhat more alert than usual, actually I retract that, I fell asleep in the shower like usual.  Oh, if you didn't know, I can sleep standing up, all I have to do is lean on something slightly.... heh it's pretty cool.  So back to the main topic, I got out of the shower a little earlier than usual, ate my antibiotics/cough medicine and ate breakfast like 10 mins earlier than my regular schedule.  Thus, I left for school in my car (my dad's really) at like 7:30.  Drove out my complex with no problems, and ended up driving up Clark and Rutherford for a good 30 mins.  I ended up at school in 30 mins, when on a good day, like the trip back home from school, 9 minutes.  Blergh.  If I had my damn clip-ons I probably would have enjoyed the ride a lot more.  Man, ice + white snow + sleet + sun = BLIND.  Jesus, I couldn't see more than 30 feet infront of me.  Good thing I was going slow.    School was uneventful, I ended up knitting in biology, Crawford didn't show up until there was about 10 minutes left of class, and we just took up some questions.  In IB math, Young taught us some stuff about combanotrics or something, aka permutations.  I didn't absorb it all because I haven't been doing my homework, oh well.  Chem was boring, watched a bunch of presentations for no reason.  Lunch was even more boring, I can't even remember what I was doing for lunch.  I think I was sitting near Jessica and.... that's all I remember.  Bleh, lunch was uneventful... I do remember laughing really hard and almost choking though.. can't remember why.. durgh -_-.  Oh... here's something quoted from the famous Luke "Yo, i can't chop dat, my rep will turn to crap."  It's probably not like that at all and sounds a lot funnier in it's original form, but that's the jist of it.  Luke's funny... in the 'good' way.  Then I feel asleep in English... we took some self test that identified the archetypal roles from Jungian psychology or something.  I ended up having the most points in "Warrior" followed closely by "Matyr" then even closer by "Wanderer"  the rest I scored lowed on.  It already told me things I knew about myself already.  I'm competetive - warrior, If you challenge me, I'll accept - warrior, I like doing things for other people in any way possible - martyr, I prefer to do certain things alone - wanderer.  Not that insightful, but still it was worth doing.  I also ended up fucking up my scarf sometime during the day, added 2 stiches by accident midway through, so to fix it I doubled up twice 3 rows down.  Argh, there's going to be a bulge there now.  man.. it was going so well too.  After school, damn this is the good part.  I went to curling, I ended up driving all the girls.  Haha... sweet...  4 girls + me .  So... when I was driving I forgot which lane on Steeles merges so I wanted to change lanes but it was too busy to get over, so I had to break hard, not hard enough to get ABS to kick in, but pretty hard to stop in time as the people infront of me were stopping to make a turn.  Bleh in the face.  I think I've scared everyone that has ever been in my car or done something really dangerous with them within the car, with the exception of Riyaad, Ruth and Hannah.  Heh..    Yeah, anyway... we go to curling, got changed, and we had like a pep/info talk and we hit the ice around 3:30-3:45 ish.  At first I was really scared of throwing the rocks, because I missed the first meeting and had no idea what the word "hack" meant in the context of curling.  But, I learned pretty quickly and after 3 or 4 bad form throws, I started getting the hang of it and I can now throw pretty damn good.  Curling is really really fun.  Man, I was having such a good time.  So great.  I just need to work on balance and timing, like what Barret says.  But wow, curling is much cooler than I expected, and I knew it was cool to begin with.    Games of skill, rather than strength and dexterity are much more fun, entertaining and cool.  It doesn't take much to push another 350 lb guy across a line when you're 350 lb yourself, but it's quite hard to just slide that 40 lb rock into the "house" (the rings).  Man, I love curling, something things y'know, just beckon you to come to them, and this is one of them.   It's a freaking calling.   Afterwards, went back to school and dropped of a girl, I forgot her name, but I remembered the other one, Erin... along with Danielle and Christie.  Eh, I'll get her name another time.  So.. when I got back, N64 on a projector screen ! WOOOO! WOOooOO! We played Goldeneye, and JP took that one as he got the hang of it pretty quickly, and then we ordered pizza from Pizza Pizza... mmm pepperoni and pineapple.  Mmmm.  Garlic Mayo Sauce.. mmm.. then Riyaad had to do some AV stuff, and we played Smash Bros which I think I won that one, and Saleem raped us, with Link.  I was quite rusty and Saleem beat us by a couple kills.  Darn him :p  Then after that.  Holiday - Politcally Correct - Winter Concert!  Woooo.  Some songs I recognized, one of them was from Waking Life, which I though was really cool and I did some video taping and adjusting sound levels and other miscellaneous AV jobs.  Pretty cool, some sections were funny, as the preambles from the teachers/skit folk were somewhat funny.  I liked it.  Show you're support by attending the Winter Holiday Assembly!  Wooo! It's just an hour of your time on the last day of school.  Support the Music People, they're all really cool, except Mike.  He made his solo look much more difficult than what it was with his constant back bending and head throwing.  Meh, whatever, that's his "groove" I guess.  So yeah, oh shit I can't forget this..  I FISHTAILED FOR THE FIRST TIME! EVER!   Oh my god.  Scarriest and  COOLEST  experience ever.  I was coming out of Greg's street and making a turn around this bend, at like 30 km/hr.  But omg, my car started to fishtail, and I was coming really close to hitting this car parked on the street.  My god, so KICKASS.  I pulled my wheel over to the right as my back tires were going that way, and then I went too far I guess so I had to pull back to the left, and then my tires finally got enough traction to hold me straight.  Man, that was SO COOoooOOOoL.  Never doing it again if I can prevent it though.  Almost hitting cars = bad.   That's all I got.  Celebrate Chrismukkah everyone! 7 Days of regular gift giving follwed by another day of Uber Gift Giving.  WoooOoo.  With the power of Jesus and Moses together, you're unstoppable.

      I dunno, as my parents age, they always say they forget things here and there, but to me, they'll never forget anything.  I don't think my parents have ever forgotten to pick me up, unlike some of my friends with stories of how their parents just left them stranded at school.  I don't think they ever forgot to do something that I asked to do for me.  In fact, I don't think they will ever forget anything that has a task attached to it.  But, they do tend to forget anything that comes out of mouth that is important to me.  Anything that is somewhat insightful and intelligent is always in one ear and out the other for my parents.  I can't really blame them, most of the time they don't grasp the concept that I'm trying to elaborate and they just smile and nod.  Oh well, no matter.  This leads me to my next point, I forgot to do a lot of things to do today:  - Didn't confront Crawford, my feelings cooled down over the weekend, but the fact that I didn't say anything still bothers me - Forgot to get my volunteer sheet completed - Forgot the other things that I forgot today.  Really, I forget too much, my brain is coming to its capacity limit and information just isn't diffusing into my brain like it use to.  Maybe because the information is a little harder than usual, but I really don't think that's the cause.  I think that my brain is fragmented.  All the information that has compiled over the past 17 years has been moved around and replaced with new information.  I don't think my space is being limited, rather the information isn't being accessed fast enough.  All the information is so spread out in my brain that I can no longer recall things at a whim like I once did.  It hurts... my brain hurts.. and my eyes burn.  I need to defragment, but I have no idea how to, or when it will happen.  I suppose several good nights of sleep would do it, but I don't think that's enough... I've become a zombie, a mere creature that is living off the bare essentials and nothing more, nothing less.  I'm just doing what I can to get buy, no better, no worse, and I don't think that's good enough.  So little time, so much to do.

      Bleh today was pure sucksors.  My mom woke me up like 2 hours too early because she didn't know how to open a door.  BLAH. The driver side door was sealed shut because the ice froze over the door and it wouldn't open for her, so she woke me up to tell her how to use the remote starter, so it could warm the car up and melt the ice... I said "Press the button".  She woke me up, just so I could tell her, press the button.  God.  GOD. ARGH.  What's worse is that she could have opened the passenger side door and got in that way.  Sigh... my mom so can't drive.  Then, I lost my clipons somewhere at work because I was late.  So I ran around changing my clothes and doing other pre-work stuff and lost them somewhere in the locker area.  That was a bummer.  Bleh.  Then, I lost hearing in my right ear after blowing my nose really hard.  That sucked.  After that, I had to deal with my really really stupid coworker.  Bleh.  Now I have to read 5th business, get my Lactase presentation in order, re read various chapters in bio, finish my scarf and catch up on like 3 months worth of IB math homework.  BLEH WHAT THE FRIKCKEN BISMARK.

      Y'know, at the Mandarin, there's this inter-franchise competition held every year where a group of judges just goes around all the Mandarins in Ontario (I think there's like 14) and they judge them on every aspect of the place. Food, service, cleanliness, how long it takes them to get seated, etc. etc.   Surprisingly we (Brampton) ranked 2nd among all of them overall.  In my division: Cleanliness, we scored top rank, so that means that the Brampton Mandarin is the cleanest Mandarin of them all... that's a little disconcerning :/  But at any rate, the good news is, is that I get a bonus!  Yeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaah!  Cash money!  So yeah, woo.    In news of fate, Liz has made a return, she was suppose to take the rest of the semester off, but I guess she changed her mind... and she happens to start on a Friday?  The same day that Peter works?  Coincidence? I think not.  Not only that, apparently every female that speaks to me in the Mandarin is my girlfriend.  Literally, I'm the the biggest mack in all of Mandarin :/  In reality, everyone is just making fun of me because I'm like the only single person there :(.  Bleh.  BLEH TO THEM!  Besides work, today sucked ass.  I went on today with only 3 hours of sleep, and the drive in the morning was horrible.  The wet sleet snow stuck onto my windshield as I was dropping my mom off to work, and the wipers weren't doing a really good job so I just let it be and drove with a translucent windshield.  My mom however, being somewhat concerned, and crazy at the same time, decides to press the wipers for me, even though it only makes it worse.  At one point, it got so bad, my windshield was fricken opaque.   OPAQUE.   I could only see brake lights.  I tore my mom's head off then.  I think I said something like "What the hell?! Don't touch the damn wipers, you're only making it worse!"  Yeah, the rest of the ride was uncomfortable as ever.  If you're ever in the car with me, don't touch anything, I'll probably get really really pissed.  But it was because I was really grumpy from the lack of sleep already, and I hate it when people mess around with the car while I'm driving.  Got to school, did a crappy parking job, tried to stay awake in Bio, while complaining of my sleepiness.  Feel asleep in Math, then tried to do math, then I threatened to kill Ada, Devon and Jason.  They were all being their usual annoying selves, well, actually, Jason wasn't annoying, but he was in the vicinity and he's black, soooo it just felt good including him.  Chem was great, Mercier wasn't there, and I just knit the whole time.  Between all of this non-doing of stuff, my patience was non-existant, and so I was yelling a lot, or talking really loudly, and threatening to kill a lot of people.  Man, it felt good.    "Shut the hell up Ada, I'm going to fucking kill you.  After that, I'm going to kill your mother.  Your father.  Your sister.  Then, I'll move onto your extended family, and I'll make sure I kill every last one of you."  She thought I was joking, which I partially was, but I really really wanted people to shut up.  You know how Ada is... and Devon.. Devon is just a pain 99.999999999999999999999, hell he's a pain  ALL THE TIME .  He breathes way too loudly, and since he sits behind me, it's honestly one of the most disturbing things you can ever hear.  On normal days, with sleep, I can ignore things like this, but on days where I feel like killing people, it just doesn't flow.  On top of that, he has this habit of tapping his feet or hands or some sort of appendage really loudly on some hard surface.  Oh, I just wanted to wrangle is neck.  At lunch I exploded and used a chain of "fucks" to describe Ada and Devon.  It felt good to explode.    In English, omg, worst presentation ever.  I winged the entire piece of shit, and even then, I have to say, that was the worst presentation that I've done in my whole life.  Albiet, it wasn't as bad as about all the other presentations.  I also finished my ball of yarn in English, I casted off wrong, and fucked up my last row permentantly, so I just cut it off, and took out a row and now I'm back to square one.  I was going to cast off after school, but lots of people were telling me how my scarf was too short, so now I have to go back to Michaels and buy myself some more yarn.  Bleh, just when I thought I was done.  Oh, on my way to work, I had my scarf over my shoulders with the needles like jabbed inside the scarf.  I walked toward my car with Black Ruth, started it, and then dumped a bunch of stuff in the trunk, got in and drove away.  As soon as I got to the Mandarin, I realised I was missing a knitting needle.  I was like "Oh my god, Where the fuck is the needle?"  where Black Ruth goes, "You probably left it in the SAC Office."  and I'm like "They're not even mine! They're Hannah's! She's going to beat me, rape me then kill me if I lose one." "Yeah, but they're in the SAC office, so it's okay." says Ruth.  Then I go "Fine."  I get changed and whatnot for work, where I'm already 20 minutes early, so I'm like, what if they  aren't  in the SAC office.  What if, I dropped them somewhere on the way towards my car, or worse yet, I dropped them in the school?.  I don't trust Black Ruth either, because her whole response was just to comfort me and get me to move on.  Clearly, she didn't even see them in the SAC office, and so, with that in mind, I ran to my car, jumped in, and drove back to the school quicktime.  I got to the parking lot, and to my surpise, the needle was right there, where I parked before.  Ruth was wrong.  Very Very wrong.  If I believed her, I would have lost Hannah's needle, and I would have been extremely upset and pissed off, and would have broke things.  Good thing I don't trust people, they're such liars.  Yeah, that's right, you're a liar.  On another note, the following people that I have to shop for and haven't even started:  Riyaad Hannah Aaron Andrea Sunny Luke Mom Dad Bro  Oh man I'm so fucked.

      Sleep is something that isn't experience by me anymore.  I've been taking 'naps' after dinner, and I usually don't wake up from them until around 11.  At that point, I really don't feel like doing anything, like at this moment, I should be working on my Fifth Business presentation.  But... I'm not.  Why?  I don't know.  It could be many things, but all I know for sure is that, I've lost all drive to accomplish things.  Over the past couple years, completing and doing assignments and the like don't seem to be as important that they use to be to me.  I remember prior to grade 10, I felt a need to do work.  Now, meh, it just feels like an endless grind.  I really wish school was over right now, it's loosing all of its frills.    Other than that, life has been pretty much the same old.  I went to curling today, I'm starting on the Mixed Team.  woooO!  There's only two teams, Men's and Mixed.  I think Alex P, Wade, Steve P andA Andrew C. are the starters for the Men's with 2 subs (Tai and someone else).  The mixed team is comprised of David (Erin/Aaron [I don't know how it's spelt :p] boyfriend) as skip, Erin/Aaron as second, me as third and the other girl as lead.  At least that's what I think our positions are :/  Yeah, pretty exciting, I like curling, but I can never put the right weight on it.  It's always too short or too strong.  Bleh :p  School-wise, eh, Bio is the same, been a little more alert than usual.  Math is great, I hate math a lot less now, but I've been falling asleep in math the past 2 days.  Chem is just the same, I just knit throughout the whole class, it's really just a waste of my time.  Today at lunch I went to Gabe's house.  He made some Kraft Dinner, and I had some of it.  I added ketchup to it, it tastes better with ketchup.  I sware... it does!  We basically just hung around his basement playing Tony Hawk Underground and Soul Calibur II.  I sat around in English knitting and listening to presentations, it was incredibly boring, like really, no one knows how to present at all.  Worst presentations ever.  I also wore my Trogdor shirt today, in homeage to the girl that wore her's yesterday.  It's pretty cool how now there are 2 people with  urlLink homestarrunner.com  goods.  It's too cool.  And apparently, Austin frequents the site also.  How  cool  is that?  Social life-wise:   SOCIAL LIFE? WHAT SOCIAL LIFE?   I'm so screwed for gifts too. Argh.  Oh, I'm considering of buying one of the following for myself on boxing day:    an 20 GB iPod - Approx Price - $579 + $50 for USB 2.0 cord  or a digital camera around $500.  or a ~$300 flip, colour cell phone.  Motorola or Samsung.  or a new video card: ATI 9800HT - $799 comes with a Half Life 2 voucher and a bunch of other goodies  or don't spend anything save up for university and possibly use the money saved to buy a new computer for my dorm. :/  argh, choices choice choices :p

      I had it all typed out, it decided not to post and lost it all, so here I go again:  The website doesn't work so well in other resolutions, and especially those lower than 1280x1024 (mine). :p The horizontal bar appears in the blog window if you're running on a smaller resolution.  Argh. But whatever, I'll see if I can get it fixed >,  Okay, onto the good stuff:  I did what I said I was going to  urlLink here.   After I walked out of that science room it felt great.  So good.  I can't possibly even explain how much relief and comfort came to me at that very moment.  It was like conquering the world, or when David killed Goliath or when the impossible was accomplished.  It was good.  Damn good.  You should have seen me.  It was beautiful, a moment of glory and triumph.  Finally, someone opposes that bitch.  And I'm glad it's me.  So, to get a taste of what happened here I am going to reaccount everything, everything that transpired and everything that was said.  And Slavica, if you're reading this.   Fuck You .  Yes.   Fuck. You .  You shouldn't even talk to me, and if you bring this up, I'm just going to tell you to shut the hell up.  You know you're wrong, there's NO way you can possibly justify yourself for your actions.  So please.  Don't even start.  I don't give a shit about your family, I don't give a shit about how your dad is a nazi, I will not empathize for an ignorant, slutty, stupid whore as yourself.  Of course if you don't read this, you'll probably never hear these very words.  So, onto the story:  I was sitting in English class, finishing up a row in my scarf while David C. was blowing my hair.  He's a weird fellow, but that's besides the point.  It was around 2:45 and I stacked up several chairs, picked up my bag and slung it around my shoulders.  The bell rung, and as I exited, I knew what I was going to do, and considered the possible ramifications and consequences.  One phrase came to mind at that point "Fuck consequence.  I rule the world."  Yeah, I coined it myself :)  So, on my way to the science office, I peered into several science rooms just to make sure he wasn't in one of them.  On my way, Gabe asked me where I was going and I said "I'm going to talk to Crawford." where he replied with "I hope you don't chicken out like before."  where I countered with "I won't."  After about the first two rooms, I ended up finding him in the room right beside the science office.  He had his latop open and was packing away some notes and papers.  I gave the doorknob a slight jiggle to see if it was locked, and proceeded to open the door as it wasn't locked.  Upon walking in, I gave the door a subtle yet quiet knock just to alert him of my presence where he then said "Hey."  I replied with "Hi, can I talk to you about something?" and he of course, said "Sure."  I stumbled with my words, I wasn't sure of how to start or even what to say.  This was something new for me, I never talked to a teacher really, outside of academics and small talk.  I don't think I've ever made a complaint before in my life.  I tried to ease it in with just talking about the class itself and how uncooperative it is and rowdy, but I just started sentences with "The class is like..." or "It's..." and just trailed off into murmuring.  There was about 30 seconds of me murmuring, fumbling with words and just basically not really saying anything meaningful.   The fact was, that I wasn't sure if I really wanted to be there, to be the one to ring the bell, to be the one who sets off the alarm.  It was something that could affect someone's life and I wasn't sure if I could really handle it.  But then I just said to myself "She's wrong.  I'm right." and gathered enough strength and confidence to say:  "Alright, this is what I want to say:  Certain people in the class are cheating.  They don't come to class on days that have tests and quizzes on them, they even sometimes don't show up on days that have assignments due.  They have the gull to walk into class, 20 minutes late, postpone tests and quizzes from this week to the next, then  NOT  show up and have some sort of  'excuse'.   It's ridiculous, it's insane, it's unfair to me, it's unfair to my peers, it's unfair to the people that show up to class day in and day out, and it's unfair to those in the other biology class.  It's simply a joke.  The system is being abused, and nothing is being done, it's ridiculous."  "I know what you mean, I've been suspecting as much from certain students, do you have any in mind?"  I stood there, pondering, considering the pros and cons of what I was about to say, it felt like ages, but in reality was probably around 2 or 3 seconds.  I then stated firmly, "Slavica."  "Yeah, I've been suspecting as much.  She doesn't come on test days and did you see today?"  "Yeah, she came up to you and.."  "She tried to snowjob the whole situation, she tried to blanket the fact that she didn't show up for the quiz and she was trying to weasle her way out of it."  "Yeah, it's a joke, she's a joke."  "In all of my twenty years of teaching, I've never encountered a student, such as her so agressive about it.  She has performed the best out of all the students that I've ever met have missed that many classes.  She's playing the  game  very well, and it's quite disturbing.  She comes in everytime with a note, and I would assume that her parents would be supporting her since this could be imperative in her getting into university.  Also, I see your point, as she's competing with you for top mark ----  Where I say to myself "hardly, that stupid bitch is going to crash and burn now."  --- well, there's very little that I can do these days.  In the past years, I would often just give students a zero that didn't show up for test days, or I would make an extra hard exam for students who frequently missed exams, or I would make the exam worth more and more for everyday you didn't come to class.  In the past, we, teachers, had a lot of power to control and stop this type of behaviour, but now and days, it's not like that.  Administration stopped us from handing out zeroes and forced us to be more lenient on everyone.  My hands are bounded now, and it's difficult for me do act."  "I see your point, it's really sad, I'm pretty sure, back in the day, around your time, this type of behaviour was unheard of.  Unacceptable.  Begging for marks, please, no one did these kinds of things, and now it's such a frequent occurance, it's so frustrating for me just to sit there and watch this to happen.  I've been sitting on this for about the last 5 or 6 years, watching people do this and cheat the system, this is the first time that something has happenned so often and so much that has finally pushed me to say something."  "Yeah, when I was in university, if you walked up to your professor and asked him for marks he would  laugh  at you.  He would teach around 600 students, and he would have no idea who you were and didn't care who you were either.  It was simply, you read your marks off a sheet, accepted it to be that, and there was nothing more and nothing less.  The only people you would even have contact with were the T.A.s and even then, you couldn't beg for marks."  "Yeah, it's really sad these days, some people are just so desperate."  "Well, I'm going to see what I can do about this, I've been talking to the department lately, and now that there have been complaints, it will be more important as this type of behaviour is unacceptable."  "Yeah thanks for listening, and I hope something gets done soon"  "No problem, thanks for sharing your feelings, and have a good night"  "You too."  I walk out of the room, almost knock over Sheeka on my way to the door as she was standing behind me.  I didn't know how long she had been there, nor do I know how much she heard, but it doesn't matter now.  I've finally did what I wanted, and I feel great.  There's way more information and talk and it was in the first draft, but since it's gone I don't really feel like retyping all of the extra stuff, but the conversation lasted for about 15-20 minutes, so you can guess how much of it I skipped over.  Also, what really got my attention was that Mr. Crawford smiled at me, and made a lot of facial expressions when I was talking to him, something I rarely see in him, in class.  Also, he actually looked at me when we were conversing.  Quite the moment.  Wish I had a hidden camera.  So yeah.  I did something and I feel great.

I really lack pictures of myself so I got nothing to put there ^_^.  But I do have lot's of pictures of Keira Knightley :).  So, here you go.  Please leave a comment, on things to change.  I also already know this website probably doesn't work well on anything under 1024 resolution, sorry :p  COMMENT PLAZ.  and i spelt requiem wrong.

      Bleh, I'm always complaining of the lack of sleep, although I never do anything about it... bleh.  I'm my own worst enemy.  It's like the 3rd last level of Mortal Kombat, where you fight your shadow self... I can picture it now, "GET OVER HERE", and in reality all these moves are futile until you get that dude into a nice air juggle.  woop woop kapop.  Finish Him! Mask Off. Flame on.  Mmmm. The other other white meat.  Anyway, I'm doing some bio assignment which I could have started earlier, which I didn't, bleh.  Shows me who's smart.  Not me!  During that I ate some asian pastry and drank some good ol' fashion orange juice.  It's even enriched with calcium.  CALCIUM! That's pretty damn cool.  Who needs milk with that poisonous lactose when you got vitamin c and calcium all in one nice orange flavoured drink.  Mmmm.  Yeah, at this moment, as I'm typing this out, I could be doing the 5 last questions on the bio assignment, but I chose not to, the curse of choice.  Okay, let's stop dwelling on the fact that I could be doing something more productive or getting sleep and get on to today's happenings.  Biology: Quiz - Did okay, I probably lost a few marks, I'm hoping I only lose half a mark, but I'm expecting like a loss of 2-3.  Between classes, I arbitrary started counting down from 5 to 0 and when I stopped making the buzzing sound, like 1/2 sec after, the bell rung.  It was crazy.  Luke won't admit the fact that I timed it perfectly, but I did, I have impecable timing, or just a lot of luck, or a lot of fluke.  IB Math: Test - I think I did fairly well, I didn't get a chance to finish the last question and I did one of the questions worth 2 marks wrong.  So I know that I got at least 7 marks out of 40 off.  Pretty shitty.  My nose was really runny at this point, and I had no tissues, pissed the living shit out of me.  Argh.  Chem: Watched like 6 videos, I just knit.  Had a lot of fun with Hannah, she said my pen was homosexual and I said she was a whore, it was quite hilarious.  This probably doesn't come off hilarious, but whatever, it's one of those "be there moments".  In fact, every Chem class is a "be there moment".  Be there if you want your eyes ripped from your skull, smashed into a blender and watch your own eyes get diced up into a nice fine cream.  How can you do that w/o eyes? Don't ask me.  Lunch: I sat with The Girls for the first time in a long time, all the other seats where too far and or where too far, and besides, it was a nice change of scenery (not that there is anything wrong with where I usually sit).  Talked to White Ruth, a bit with Erin and Lisa, made fun of Roanna, and this time I didn't speak and I insulted her 6 times over.  Meghan or however you spell it, came into the caf looking for a seat, and couldn't find one, and so, I offered her my seat, and got up to fetch myself another chair.  Unbeknownst to me, Manh L. was doing the same thing, but I beat him to the punch.  Hah.  Nubbed.  It was funny to me at least :p  Yeah, that was the highlight of my lunch, oh and I got to explain some computer stuff to White Ruth but I don't think any of it got absorbed, so I might as well just go over there and tinker with her machine.  I like playing around with computers, it's fun :)    Yeah, for some reason lunch was amusing and I think I'm really loud.  But I can't tell, because my ears are plugged from my cold/flu, and I can't judge my own projection.  Someone should tell me to shut up if I'm being too loud... I'm serious.    English: Funny thing.. I was suppose to do a presentation today, completely cancelled.  I think Ms. Snowden forgot she postponed it for today, and she ended up handing out a second presentation, where I picked the first number and got to choose first.  I ended up picking the same topic as the 1st presentation, so wooo.  No need to do work!  Pretty sweet.  Also, here's something that should be dooly noted:  I've picked 1st for every presentation order in English class, not in as went first, but I got to choose my position first.  My luck is really high this year.  Must be that crazy asian charm that I got going.  If only I was 21 and at a casino right now.. damn.  SAC Meeting: So pointless, all the issues don't regard me ever, why doesn't Amandeep get it through his head that his friend's shouldn't be in there?  Or anything of  your  friends either.  Yes I'm looking at you.  You know who you are.  Don't you think I don't know.  So yeah, SAC = bleh in the face.  After that I ended up knitting and playing guess the word before it appears on screen with Alex, Sunny and Adam, it was surpisingly entertaining for a fricken hang man game.  Went home, ate, took a nap, woke up, no OC, got mad, started doing bio, got side tracked like 50 times.  And here I am.  This blog is ending.  I think about here is good.  Wait... here is better.

      Woke up to a my phone ringing, yeah, I don't use an alarm clock, my parents just call me :).  So, I woke up and did my morning business, made myself some wonton noodle soup and and left for work all in 45 minutes.  I sped down Bramalea and Steels like usual, but this time I pushed to 110 on Steeles.  Still doesn't beat my pb (yay! running lingo!) of 140 on Dixie.  So, I got to work with about 3 minutes to spare, got changed with about 30 seconds to spare, and did the opening routine.  12 o'clock rolls around, and I'm like.  hrm. isn't there suppose to be two other people here to help me?  THen my manager, Nelson, tells me, Leo called in sick, and the other guy took the day off a couple days ago.  I'm like, 'You're kidding me, it's Saturday, you expect me to do this by myself?"  Nelson is like "Pretty much, yeah, here, Ling (assistant manager) will help you."  Where I go, "Ling? There aren't busgirls for a reason you know."  -Laughter-  Ling goes "I'll do the cutlery (easiest job with little effort) and you do everything else."  Then I sigh with, "Thanks."  Argh, worst 5 hours of my life.  5 HOURS of doing  TRIPLE  my normal workload.  IT was horrible.  Did I get compensated?  YES I DID.  Double my pay.  Yay!  It wasn't worth it though, those 5 hours were absolutely the most tiring and difficult hours that I've ever worked for in my life. Not including anything related to X-country of course.  The worst part of this is that I got a 30 min break for lunch before my next 6 hour shift started.  Yay for people not showing up to work!  Also, Santa showed up to the Mandarin, there was a party of like 150 people in one room, most of them kids with their parents.  Santa also had 2 really hot elves.  I like hot elves :).   But anyway, as I saw them and Santa, the first thing that came to my mind was :  "I wonder what these kids are dieing of."  When in fact, they weren't dieing from anytyhing, after about 5 minutes of scouting around I noticed none of them looked pale or had respirators, so I assumed it was some sort of coroporate party for the parent's' kids.  Yay!  Hot Elves!  In my second shift, Yellow Ruth was around, and I proceeded to start with the homewrecker jokes again.  She got extremely upset.  She hit me a couple times and threatened to pour various liquids on me.  I was like woah.  Hold it girl.  Then I started up again, but this time to everyone else, and we all laughed alot and she got even more upset.  When she was telling me to "stop it", I sware to god she was about to cry.  Stupid me, I just laughed and made fun of the fact that she was blushing, which she was.  I felt really bad afterwards when I was reflecting on my actions, and I concluded that I hurt her feelings big time.  Argh.  We had about 20 minutes of silent treatment between us, and then we did the bumping-into-each-other-by-accident routine and ended up talking again.  So I guess she got over it pretty quickly, but I still felt bad.  I planned to apologize after work because in the Mandarin, if you talk about anything seriously, it's a big deal.  Biggest gossip circle that I've ever been a part of.  It's crazy.  So yeah, I just carried on with my work and stuff, and Sam screwed up a bunch of stuff which I had to fix, fucking mongloid.  So afterwork, I hung around late, and talked to Ruth.  I was waiting for a good time to get the apology in, but she kept talking about Michelle Branch, who I like, and how she went to her concert and she showed me a bunch of pictures, and some of her art pictures.  I was like, why aren't you using an SLR? and she was like.. "What's an SLR?" and I'm like "OMG, you're in an Art School, and you don't know what an SLR is?".  Yeah and the the rest of the converstation carried over to other topics and stuff, we spent about 1 hr talking about a variety of things, and by the end of it I lost my opportunity to apolgize for being such an ass.  Bleh.  What the sux.  I wasted an entire hour to not do what I wanted to do in teh first place, man I suck.  Sped my ass home, and got home in about 8 minutes.  I should time myself, and see how fast I can get home :)

      What happened on Friday? NOTHING! Completely nothing.  Like bupkiss.  So, let me try to find something interesting.... hrmph.  Let's start chronologically, so I don't miss anything...  Drove to school, sped a lot, I drive the speed limit on Clark, but on Rutherford.. hahaa I go 80.  Bio Class, uhm... Slavica & Co. extended the quiz the day before and so we learned/reviewed.  Fucking bitch.  Also got to see a mark update, didn't go up or down, stuck at a crappy 86.  IB Math, work period, had intersting conversation with Pardeep I think.  Chem, I balanced some equation really quickly, I think that's the only thing in Chemistry that I've actually mastered, balancing equations.  I can do them really fast for some reason, meh.  Then Mercier proceeded to do a lab that produces Nitrogen Dioxide, which is deadly in high concentrations.  Yay! Death! Fucking nub.  I fell asleep through the lab and bits and parts of the aftermath, Hannah kept poking me to keep me conscious.  Good thing too, otherwise I would have missed puffs of orange smoke appearing from a green liquid.  Lunch, did mark update thingy, uhm, talked about some stuff, Chrismukkah, and how I'm Jesus and Andrea is Moses.  We need a name for our "Bible".  English, slept through about 40 minutes of it, woke up to listen to some talk about Fifth Business, I was suppose to do a presentation, but she extended it to Monday since no one came to class.  Yay Academics!  Afterschool, played N64 on a projector screen, I owned up Golden Eye, and then proceeded to help out with Cabaret and stuff.  Work, went by really fast, not much to say about it, except I hate Sam.  Worst co-worker ever.  I also ended up being a messenger between.... okay from now on in this blog, Ruth from Work, will be called "Yellow Ruth", Ruth as in president of sac will be called "Black Ruth" and Ruth Ruth, is "White Ruth".  Ahh the beauty of colour-coded-ness.  So anyway, as I was saying, I was the messenger between Yellow Ruth and Calvin.  They were passing on retarded messages via me, and I just passed them on.  I ended up making fun of Yellow Ruth because she kept flirting with Calvin and since Calvin was engaged, I called her a "home-wrecker".  Hahaha, that was good.  Go me.  That's it for Friday.

      Went to school today, had to do a holiday Christmas concert/talent/music thing, which basically consisted of various bands/groups singing/playing things.  Quite the thing.  Lot's of stuff happened today, and I'm incredibly tired and need to get to work tomorrow so I'm going to make this brief.  1 - got like 77% on my bio tes,t which is garbage imo, I know some people would love to get 77, but 77% IS FRICKEN GARBAGE to me.  Deal with it.  2 - I can't sing.  I'm pretty sure the whole SAC singing thing was horrible, but everyone seems to be telling me, it wasn't  'that'  bad.... yeah... right.... :rolleyes:  3 - They spelt secret a ry wrong on my T-shirt.  As they spelt it secretery.. argh.  When you print things on fabric,   SPELL IT RIGHT!   4 - Drove Luke around so he could shop for about 4-5ish hours so he could get everything (for like 10 people).  I was already done most of my shopping so I just walked around for nothing really.  Meh, I didn't mind that much.  5 - Aaron and Luke came over to my house and we ate Asian food.  It's the first time  ever  that I've had friends over and ate Asian food, with chopsticks and rice and etc and in bowls.  It felt very normal for some reason, very relaxed.  It just fit well.  Like a groove.  All the other times, I usually had like Pizza, pasta, take-out, nothing ever made by my mom.  6 - Went to Jenna's and to my surpise, Alyssa H. was there!  Yeah, pretty exciting.  Didn't catch up on anything, but it was just refreshing to see an old face.  We also got into a snowball fight and I got pretty much my ass reamed as Hannah, Alyssa, Veronica got me pretty good as it was 3v1 the whole time.  Way to help Luke.  7 - Riyaad apparently knicked my car while backing up.  Way to go, no-go!  We'll see the damage tomorrow morning as it's too dark to see any scratches or anything.  8 - Argh, it was fun, although hot, but really really really fun.  Leslie made a comment about me, and I was out of hearing distance, but I know she was making fun of me.  thanks.  Thanks a lot.  9 - Simon W. is funny.    10 - Riyaad cut me above my eye with a paper plate or something, as when I got home, I noticed the cut.  11 - I now am in possession of Pi and a lamp and a scarf.  WOoooOOot! Thanks guys!  12 - It's like the 12th day of Christmas and i'm going to bed as i'm too tired to even think or recall.  g'nite

      I must have bumped into like 8 people at the mall.  8! Fricken 8 people.  You know what time I got to the mall? around 8:30, you know what time it closes? 9! (it really closes at like 10) but still.  That's almost less than 2 hours to do like 5 people's worth of shopping.  It was possibly one of the gayest experiences ever.  I went to the mall alone, no thanks to Luke, and decided to just go to stores and buy things.  Yep, just recall from whatever memories that I had and buy whatever at the moment I thought that you or whoever would like.    Oh and by the way, I'd like to apologize by the crappiness of my gifts.  They are crappy, I'm very, very, very, very sorry.  I basically got Gift Receipts for just about everything that I could have, just in case my gifts turned out to be  really  crappy.  Some gifts were better than others (thought-wise and $$ wise), but I'm just a lazy, lazy ass.  I'd have to say that was/is the worst set of gifts that I have/will ever give out.  Enough with the crappy gifts though, the amazing thing was the amount of people that I see that I've met before at the mall, and that I really really don't have the time to talk to them.  I saw 2 of my co-workers from Mandarin at Old Navy, Alex and .... I forget her name... damnit, where's a nametag when you need it.  Anyway, Alex and "girl" where holding hands and whatnot, so that makes me certain that they are girlfriend-and-boyfriend now.  I assumed so for the past couple weeks or so, but they don't do anything during work, so I just the idea that they were just really good friends or something.  But now, I know  that's  not true!  I also saw Rachel's sister, at Old Navy, she workes there.  Had like a 5 minute small talk thing which was so painful as she was the one who pointed me out and stopped me... I just wanted to get the hell out and move onto the next person on the list.  Blergh!  I'm fine with small talk, in fact, I love small talk, but I can't deal with it when I'm in a hurry and have to be going places.  Damn Small Talk.  Then I saw David, (I think his name is David) in the mall, walking around, he was talking on his Cell, probably to Erin, or one of his friends, as he said "I just ran into one of my curling buddies."  Eh, we both nodded and said "hey" and moved on.  Now that's small talk baby.  @ T-shirt palace I saw one of the Batallion guys, no talking, since I didn't know him.  At one of the music stores, I forget which one, Sunrise.  Ah sunrise, the two cashiers were Asian, and they started to small talk me, up the ying yang, and I was like 'Smile-laugh-nod-walk-away' sort of thing, but they kept on going.  Argh, but at least they made of white people when they were doing it.    Them: "We're sisters" Me: "Uhm... are you sure?  You guys don't look like sisters." Them: "Yeah, according to the white people, you're our brother too." Me: "hahahahah..."    Then I saw Jacob who was working at compucentre.  We talked baout LOTR for a while then he had to help some customers.  Rawr what the bismark.  I tried to find Azim, he works at the UB at Bramalea?  I think?  Maybe I should ask him.. whatever... no luck there.  I couldn't even take a step into the place, it was filled with dirty brown genos and the horrendous techno music, not to mention the extremely bright white lights.  I tried to walk in, but I couldn't :/  Yeah, going to the mall = lame.

      I've always been an advocate against all of these "3-in-1" or more, computer gadgets and accessories.  Most of them, notably the  urlLink Nokia N-Gage , is a big sack of crap.  As well as the current camera-phone combos and pda-phone combos.  But after much scowering of the beloved internet.  I've found the  urlLink perfect gadget .  Power, beauty, ability all packaged in a nice sleek silver package.....  .... that is only offered in Japan. :( *tear  A 2.0 Megapixel Camera in a phone.  That's power I tell ya, POWER!  It looks so nice too.  Meh, damn us non-tech centered country.  Argh!  I can't wait till they import this baby over.  Can't wait!!!  No re-account of today folks, nothing much to talk about anyway... except...  I slept in my classes, bought LOTR: Return of the King tickets for tomorrow @ 4:30 @ The Grande, for those of you who are interested.  I parked today with my wheels fully turned, just to see if my car would not start.  Apparently, on Riyaad's SUV, it doesn't start if you shut the car off with the wheels fully turn, and Katherine seemed to support this crazy dealy.  I then went out and tried it for myself, and of course, my car worked.  Damn crackers :p  Yeah you too Riyaad.  Crackah Mc Crack.  Drove Ramy to the mall, sometimes I think he's a good guy, and then he goes and does stupid things.  Crazy kid.  I did some shopping, got Luke's present.  Ahahah it's funny.  Well Luke won't find it funny.  But I will ;)  Jokes!

      Or something like that.  Man, I have to say,  urlLink The O.C. . gets better and better and better, and even better after every single episode.  It's crazy... seriously... crazy.  Best show ever.  I mean c'mon, what's not to like about it?  If you haven't started watching it, you're really missing out, like a lot.  So yeah, besides  urlLink The O.C. , life has been not so bad lately.  Although, I haven't been sleeping much, I'm learning adequate amounts of information in classes and have quite the time at school.  It's nice to know, school isn't  that  horrid.  It's probably because I had a pretty good day today, nothing too strenuous happened today, and I just chilled.  I'll tell you about it:  Woke up today, did the same old as usual, but today I didn't add banana slices to my cheerioes so it was missing the extra fruit that I usually have.  Oh well, it's just as good plain.  I scrambled on the bus trying to rememebr as much as I could about biology, in addition to the studying I did the previous night.  Most of it escaped me, but I think faired decently on the quiz.  Again, people cheated, namely brown people, and Slavica came in 20 minutes late.  Meh, whatever, I hope the powers that be smite her.  Math was uneventful, I fell asleep during the read-thru of the lesson, and ended up catching the latter half of it.  Wasn't too bad.  I tend to sleep sitting up with my head slouched over, it's pretty weird, I think I'm the only who does this, as everyone else in the class and in general sleeps with their head on the desk.  I can sleep anywhere really, just have to find that nice groove.  I even once slept standing up against a wall in a hotel room with Andy, and some other folks.  I also doze off standing up in the shower for a good 15 minutes everyday.  It's pretty weird ;)  I like chem.  Mostly because Hannah is there.  If she wasn't, oh my god, I'd shoot myself.  She makes a lot of things so more enjoyable.  Yay!  She then gave me a tin box of baked goods and candy afterwards.  Pretty sweet.  I shared most of my stuff, and I think everyone enjoyed it as much as I did.  They were some really good cookies.  Lunch, has been the same like always.  There are a couple things I'd like to point out though.  The Girls don't sit with the rest of us, or you could word it so that, we don't sit with The Girls anymore.  But, it doesn't make a difference really, I think it's one of those non-admitted, non-said, mutual agreements by both parties.  Eh, it's not like I don't care, but we're all drifiting apart, or we're all becoming more specialized. Really depends how you're looking at the glass: half empty? or half full?  But with that said, we  are  drifting apart and there's no doubt about it.  I can only speak for myself, as I really don't look foward to such a thing.  I like everyone, some more so than others, but I like everyone.  Everyone brings something unique to the table and brings a whole completeness to the experience.  Now there are gaps, holes, things missing... maybe I'm the only one feeling this... correct me if I'm wrong.  Another thing happened at lunch today.  I believe JP claimed victory over one  urlLink Lucus Poor Sportmortacus .  Okay, I'm exaggerating, as JP beat Luke pretty fairly and then they had a rematched where Luke beat JP.  It was pretty fair I would think, but I wasn't  really  paying attention, so I'm not that great of a judge.  Anyway, I'm just going to say arm wrestling is pretty pointless.    "Rawr! I beat you game of strength." "Welcome to the 21st century bub."  And on the topic of Luke.  21 days from today, Luke has to make a fully functional website, with 200 hits on it, in 21 days.  That's my challenge to him.  Is he going to do it? .....*cough* .... *cough*  English was just sleep.  Not much to say, except Snowden trounced over Sandeep or whatever that stupid brown kid's name is.  He got zero for his presentation because he didn't show up and didn't produce a note.  He was trying to come up with some excuses but she essentially poked many-a-holes into his hot air balloon.  Afterschool, I sat around listening to Katie, Andrew F. and Mike B. jam.  They sounded pretty good, I really liked it, it made me wish I didn't stop playing the sax.  Too late now.  Oh well, I can always appreciate music by listening instead of playing ^_^.  Keep on trucking folks.

      Yeah, so, I woke up today around 3 PM.  Meh :/  I got on my computer, did some market research on a series of products, the iPod, various other mp3 players, pros cons, and the whole bit.  I usually do this for everything I buy, as it takes me forever to decide whether I want something or not.  I try to find a good deal :/  In my iPod research, I stumbled onto this  urlLink little gem .  Although it's quite entertaining, well put together, and informing, it's general message is false as of this date.  I believe around the time of the release of this home made video,  urlLink Apple  released a battery replacement program around $100 USD.  Pretty damn steep to replace a battery.  Meh, I really don't know if I should get an iPod anyway, it's 20GB of storage... do I really need 20 GB of storage?  do I? and for around $600 CDN? Is it really worth it ?  Then I went to Cameras, went through a whole lot of them, and came to the conclusion that I would rarely ever use it, or I would turn into one of those really annoying people taking pictures all the damn time and piss people off until they beat me with sticks.  Don't want that to happen -_-.  Cell phone.. hrmph.. the most useful of the many things that I would like.  My parents are always looking for me, and hence it would be easier for them to contact me when I'm not at home.  So I guess this would be the most practical of my wants.  Although, I really don't think shelling out $30 a month for 2 years with the $200 cost of the phone to be really worth it :/  The video card, isn't going to be useful to me until I get World of Warcraft, so I'm holding off on that baby.  All this research took me about 3 hours, until dinner, where I ultimately determined not to buy anything, holy damn, what a waste of time.  After dinner, I watched a special on TLC on Ancient Egyptians regarding two twin sisters Taos and Toaes or something, and the Apus God Bull.  Pretty interesting, held my attention for about an hour and that was also a waste of time.  After that I watched something on TVO.  I think it was called VOX Talk or something of that nature.  It had 6 panelists and the host, and today's subject was marketing/advertising and it's adverse effects.  The only reason I watched it was when I was channel surfing, I sware I saw Alex Della Via in the background.  After watching the whole thing, (30 mins worth), I concluded that it was Alex Della Via, as the person sitting beside her was from Brampton, so I would assume they were friends.  No one goes alone to TV things :p  The entire program was quite biased and one sided.  4 out of 6 of the panelists where emo, nature-loving, anti-sweat-shop, white kids (one black guy, white-washed to oblivion).  All of them had hair stereotypically of emo, except for the black kid, and they behaved liked emos.  "Oh my god, save the goddamn children." they would go on saying, and saying how companies are 'bad' and 'evil' for trying to market their products aggressively and directly.    I really felt sorry for the other 2 panelists, who where attractive white girls (that has nothing to do with it :/ I sware... it doesn't!), who where trying to defend the companies as their marketing schemes were quite affective and ingenius.  Companies that market, and do so successfully should be praised, instead of this dribble perpetuated by this liberal-waste-of-flesh-emos.  My god, what the fuck is wrong with you kids, the shirts that you wear, the shoes that you wear, the colourful clothing that you eccentric idiots wear is most likely produced in China or some other 3rd world country and you have the gull to say "We should stop these companies, because it's wrong."  Well, you are the ones that aren't boycotting them, you are the ones that are supporting these 'evil companies.  Hell, if you really wanted to be against these child slavery companies, just stop consuming products all together.  Live in your local forest, and grow your own damn food, and make your own damn clothes.  Fight the man.  You have the power.  Stupid emos.  They also said that advertising should be more tame, as it is too direct and morally wrong is countless ways.  Yeah so what? Sex does sell, so do endorsements and a whole sloth full of other not-so-moral things.  It sells doesn't it?  and Is it the companies fault if stupid consumers purchase their crap products because Beyonce Knowles dyes her hair with it?  Hell no.  It's your fault.  You're the one with the money, and you should do the research and put some thought in buying crap.  It isn't the companies fault.  AHHH I'm so tired of hearing the same retarded views, from the same group of retarded people, go back to your island and live off your pure organic plants.   Damn vegan-emos.  Yeah, I'm very judgemental. Sue me.

      As I mentioned before,  urlLink here ,  urlLink here  and  urlLink here ,  urlLink Liz  has returned.  She gave me cut eye constantly, and refused to speak to me.  In return, I refused to speak to her.  Eventually she stopped acknowledging my presence as she would turn away from as soon as I entered the corridor, room, whatever.  It was quite the snubbing.  Oh well, she's the most childest brat I've ever met anyway.  No loss there.  Maybe I'll try to start a conversation with her next week.  What really sucked about work, was the fact my manager, Nelson, said he wasn't going to promote be until I work full time, which isn't going to happen until summer, so no waiter-ness for me.  what the sux.  So jipped.  Also, there's a new bus boy, and he's pretty cool.  He speaks English better than all of the other ones, but his vocabulary is limited, but you can't knock on him for being born in China and lived there for 18 years and came over here and is able to articulate :/  Although, he predominately speaks Mandarin which isn't cool for me, but at least he understands Cantonese which is a plus.  He's cool too, he goes to Seneca College with Leo, another busboy and Paul, a buffet attendant.  They're all in the same computer science-esque program too, so they're all pretty good friends, and me, well I'm just on the outside like usual -_-.  Another thing happened to me today.   Deja Vu!   It was weird, I walked out of the kitchen doors, and  bam! , Deja-fricken-Vu!  It was quite the surreal experience.  I then instantly recalled dreaming of that very moment 2 or 3 years ago.  One of my very few dreams.  Makes me wonder if I can predict the future if I concentrate and harness my dreaming ability ^_^.  So yeah, the Liz-Danny conflict is up on the rise, I'm not getting promoted, there's a new guy, and I can predict the future somewhat, what else is next for Danny Dang?  Tune in next time, same bat-website, same bat-time, same bat-url!

      All I have to say is that, yesterday, aka Christmas, was the best Christmas I ever had, and also rivals to be the best day ever in my life.  Seriously,  best day ever.   Let me tell you why this is so true.  The entire day started off with me waking up and cleaning myself up, like shaving and stuff.. which I hardly do.  I then had to pick out what to wear to the Christmas party.  I picked out my black suit with a very stylish grey/black shirt to go along.  Top button undone and the collar kinda flared out to give it that badass look.  And I have to say, I looked pretty damn badass.  So I went to The Garden at like 2pm so I could help setup everything.  I got there first and the doors were locked so I just sat around in my car waiting for the dumbasses to arrive because the night before they were all like "Come at 2pm,  or else !"  Blah, what a bunch of nubs.  So anyway, they came at like 2:30 and we're all inside and moving tables around, making the seating plan, making sure everything was where it was suppose to be and that it was all going to run smoothly.  It was pretty hectic for the 2 hours we spent setting up as there were about 2 dozen of us running around cleaning, and getting things to look nice.  But in the end, it was really worth it.  I then just stood around for a while chatting with some people, namely Peter.  He was wearing this turtle neck shirt with khakis and dress shoes, and he kept telling me he felt under-dressed, because a couple of us were wearing suits and the like.  But I kept reassuring him he was fine and stuff, 'cause honest to God, what he was wearing probably costed him what my entire year's wardrobe would cost.  Anyway, yeah, we just hung around for a while because no one was sitting at our tables so we just chilled out at the reception desk and handed out bottles of Chardonnay and Merlot.  After 5 o'clock rolled around, everyone arrived except for one or two, so we just went inside, took our seats and just started the party.  We started with some speeches from various managers, owners (Peter's Dad), and other important people.  It was pretty boring, they had some in English, some in Cantonese, some in Mandarin, all of which were saying the same thing... so it was really a waste of time.  Then we ate, had a lot of sushi and food, and it was really good too.  After that, I just gambled with Peter, Mackenzie (Peter's cousin... who is also rich), and Paul.  We played Big 2 for like at least an hour or two, and I managed to win the most.  As after about 20 games or so, I was 47 cards down, while Paul was 52 cards down, Peter, 140, and Mackenzie, 170.  We didn't collect money, because no one really cared, but if we did, oh man, I would have made about at least 60-70 dollars right there as we were playing a quarter a card.  After that, there was dancing and the like, and me being, 'making a fool of myself is the least of my concerns' decided to dance.  There was a lot of techno and club music, and I had a really good time dancing with just about every girl 25 and under on the dance floor.  And I have to say, everyone my age was looking  DAMN  fine.  There was a couple of slow songs, and I asked Liz and Ruth to dance, but they kept going between each other with "No, he asked you first..." "No.. he asked  you  first"... that lasted for the entire slow song, and at the end they were both like "Look, the song is over now.. blah blah blah"  and I'm like in my head. "Screw this, if neither of you are going to dance with me, I'll just go find someone else."  To which, I did.  Besides that, Peter's face was turning blood red when he was drinking, much like myself, and after some googling, I found out it's because we both lack the aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 enzyme so we experience something called 'Alchohol Flush Reaction'.  Guess, we're meant to be designated drivers for the rest of our lives.  Oh well, I'm content with that, at least now, I have more reasons not to drink.  I really felt bad for my brother though, he didn't do any dancing or anything, and he stayed for at least a good 6 hours.. must have been bored out of his mind.  Blah... too young to drink (yeah I know I am too, but hush).  No one to dance with (no one his age anyway)  and yeah he was boooored.    The best part of the day was when I won 200 dollars cash, and a 150 dollar gift certificate to SEARS.  Pretty damn sweet.  Basically what happened was at the beginning of the day, everyone put in money to buy raffle tickets to win the money back.  Pretty ingenious.  At the end of the night, there was approximately 1700 dollars cash inside the pot.  They divided it up into a couple of prizes, to which I won 200$ cash. And my name was drawn for the gift certificate.  Pretty damn sweet.  Walk into a party for free, spend 10 dollars on raffle tickets, and walk out with $350.  Pretty damn good if I say so myself.  It doesn't end there though, near the end, Shenay dropped by, who's a hostess, who is the sister of that really hot girl that Phil R. knows... a couple of  urlLink posts back ...  Yeah, she's a really really cool person.  She knows how to dance, like she competes and stuff, so she's a really good dancer.  I felt kinda dumb just watching her, so one of my new goals is to learn how to dance.  Like traditional dancing... salsa..somba..ballroom.. everything.  New goal.  And I'm quite serious about it too, so if anyone wants to learn with me, you know where to reach me and we'll do it together.  Then after the party ended and everyone left, it was just Vanessa, Peter, Mackenzie (Peter's Cousin), Shenay and I that were left over.  We were still pretty awake and pretty sober, so we were all like, let's go do something, and Mackenzie (who is honestly a crazy party animal) was like "Let's go get CRUNKED DOWNTOWN!"  All of us.. who don't live in Toronto were like "Uhmm. No."  So we just went around Brampton looking for an open bar. *cough* let's not forget it's Christmas ladies and gentlemen.  The funny part about this was the fact Shennay had almost no gas in her car.  We spent a good 30 minutes looking for a open, working gas station.  We had to drive all the way down from Kennedy and Steeles to Kennedy and Williams before we even found a gas station that was open and working.  Hah, a good waste of 30 minutes, but it was fun driving around in a car possee.  4 cars taking up the road.  Wooo!  After we found some gas, we tried to find a open bar.  We ended up in some bar near Sandlewood and Kennedy.  I think it was called Pool something something or other.  Oh well, the important part is the fact they were checking for ID so Shennay and I couldn't get in.  Blergh.  So we all left and went to Country Style!  Open 24 hours a day, even on CHRISTMAS!  Yep. Country Style.  Apparently the only 2 bars open in Brampton was that one and something called Wild Moses or Wild Mollases or something.  Both of which were filled with white trash and retarded drunk people.  Yes i know when you have drunk people, expect retarded shit to happen... but do that have to be  that  stupid?  So in Country Style, we all ordered something stupid, and I offered to tip the guy working as he was like my age, and working on Christmas must suck.  But he was being all gentleman about it, saying "Nah, but thanks for offering" over and over again.  Whatever, but all of us just sat in the corner, and spent a good 2 hours talking about stuff.  Yes, just stuff.  These are the things that I really look foward to.  Endless, free-flowing, conversation with no pauses.  That's right folks, no awkward silences.  It was great.  Absolutely wonderful.  We talked about managers, people at work, getting drunk, clubs, snowboarding, girls, how certain people behave, and it was just great.  And Shenay was so cool too, she is clearly one of those, "One of the Guys" girls.  She's so cool. SOOOOOO COOOL.  Yeah, enough with that.  But yeah, I really like conversations like that.  I then left Country Style at like 3 AM, and ventured back home to get liquored up.  I had some alcohol left over, and so, I drunk some of that, and was typing this very post and I think my computer reset or something.  In any case, I'm awake now, and I have to say, looking back, Yesterday  WAS  the  Best Day Ever .  Had fun, got buzzed with my parents in the room, gambled, won a bunch of stuff, danced with a bunch of girls, had a very long and interesting conversations with some really cool people, got drunk, then went to bed.  Yeah, great. Fricken Great.

      I had a really really long post. about my Christmas party.  And now that I'm drunk and pissed off.  That's not going to happen anymore.  And also, my face turns red quick time when I drink, but I don't feel the affects of the drinking for quite some time.  Right now, my face is blood red, but nothing.  Nothing at all.  I just had at least 700 words worth of exciting story and crap, and my computer decided to reboot without even fricken warning me.  I just crashed and restarted on its own.  Way to go computer. FUX.  I'll post about it tomorrow after I recover from my first hang over and Boxing Day shopping.  Argh.  FUX I HAD A GOOD POST TOO.

      that...  Yes you nubtars, agreeance  is  a word, and yes, I know Fred Durst used it in one of his gay ass anti-war speeches, and yes, I know this word hasn't been used in like 200 years.  Hush.  Okay, I'm not going to post about Festivus until I get those god damn pictures from Josh, otherwise all of Festivus will be ruined.  Argh.  Damn south koreans, you can't trust them to do hard labour for nothing.  But the real part of this post is that I think some sort of treaty, pact, or something, should be created to stop all of this 'internet-bashing'.  For the love of God, we (as in most of us) [us, being "The Clique"] {The Clique, being the 4th lunch kids and some others} should  stop  all of this nonsense.  Sure, it's fun to say, "Go get run over by an ambulance."  But, it isn't as fun to say it if you had to say to someone's face.  And don't fucking lie to me either, you know you couldn't spit those words out of your mouth directly at someone.  And if you can, holy fuck, go see a therapist.    Just because you don't like someone, doesn't give you the right to go bashing them left and right, through gay ass anonymous posts on their Ljs.  Please...  sure, you don't like them, sure, they don't like you, sure, you think the way they live their lives is stupid and stupid.  But holy fuck, it's  THEIR  lives.  Stop trying to think that your way of life is any better than theirs, and yes I do realize this can be applied back to me as being hypocritical, but FUCK, that's not the point.  So let's just all drop all of this shit and get back to civilzation.  I know I sound like Riyaad with more swearing, but holy fuck, stop this bullshit.  It's driving me insane.  I know it's the last year, and you might as well throw some more punches before you never see these people again, but fuck man, this is getting out of hand and is turning into a retarded flame war.  And for those of us who aren't forum monkeys, flame wars are just retarded posts back and forth insulting each other for stupid things.  Grow up boys and girls, so you don't like someone, you don't have to tell the whole fucking world.  That's my 2 cents.  And yes, I swear a lot when I'm pissed.  Fuck.  To reiterate,  stop this fucking shit.

      You might be wandering what the title has to do with anything.  Hell, it makes no sense... reincarnation? I'm not even dead yet! (knock on wood.)  But, hear this, my brother is exactly like me, in almost everyway possible.    For the past 3 hours, I've been rearranging my music, trying to fix all of the ID3 tags or whatever on them, so that they would group nicely in my new system of organization on my computer.  Anyway, I have almost 2000 mp3s scattered in all sorts of different folders all over my hard drive, so it's quite hard.  I found some mp3s in some of 'My Documents' folders, and I just happened to stumble on some of my old chat logs... from last year.  For nostalgia or something, I decided to read a couple of them... here's some quotes:  .--------------------------------------------------------------------. | Session Start: 27 March 2003                                       | | Participants:                                                      | |    KraziAzian (kraziazian@hotmail.com)                             | |    ...te: 1200 completed: 972 (props to Adeel) (jp_d2@hotmail.com) | |    ...ssed, I'm inadequate!

Turns out, that those logs belonged to my brother, and a lot of his chats, are pretty much the same as mine, even his response are predictable, in the sense as that would probably be something that I would say.  Ahhhh! HE's LIKE ME! AHHHHH!  AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! It's scary.  Like very.

      What the bloody hell.  Macromedia Dreamweaver seems to be crashing every 2 seconds for me. Who knows why?! BLAH! It's ridiculous.  Now I have to rearrange things by hand, ARGH, what the fuck.  Yeah, that's screwed up the ying-yang.  Other than that, things are pretty candy sweet, Festivus just happened, and I'll make a real post about it when Josh sends me those incriminating pictures.    Although I happened to leave like 3 hours early as Greg had to leave to pack, I really didn't mind too much to leave, as I was falling asleep and tired of the examintation of blogs.  It happened to be on everyones' minds, except for those who were lost... like Jessica, Shan! (yeah, he came.  pretty damn cool.)  and a few others.  So I really needed to get away from it 'cause I wasn't really expecting Festivus to turn into a 2-hour-bashing-everyone-that's-not-us-event.  At any rate, I have like 50 lbs worth of weight crushing my brain right now, I dunno, it's not a headache, or a migrane, but it feels like my brain is about to explode.    My grandma is also staying with us right now for Christmas, so it's great to see her around.  She's like in her late 60's now or early 70's... I'm not quite sure,  I don't even know how old my parents are.  In any case, I think she looks great for being that old, she's pretty active as she walks around the house a lot.  But, I think she's honestly bored out of her mind, I see her sitting there reading a lot, or watching the news, or some program on TV that I doubt she understands at all.  Boredom is pretty crappy, and if I had to live a good 10 or 20 years like that, oh my god... I hope someone kills me.  On another note, working tomorrow, what the bumsex.   -EDIT- my website is the thing that's crashing Macromedia Dream Weaver.  This is clearly a sign.  I'm making a new vers. starting tommorrow night.  I'm thinking grey, black and white, and maybe a colour for accent.  I have this really cool idea, but I probably won't make it work.  Durh I am dumbs.

      I talked to some people, about certain things, regarding a certain event.  I'm sure most of the Danny-Land readers are quite aware of this, and if you aren't, you should pay a visit to my links.  I think it's going to boil down to this one moment, a moment of decision, of choice, of which side of the line you stand on.  It sounds simple... yet not.  That's all I have to say;  maybe I'm reading  too much  into this, maybe I'm reading  too little  into this.    But whatever the case, what's done is done, and the stones are set in motion.  I realise I'm being very vague, and that's the way I intend to keep it.  I hope everything ends up alright though.

      Just watched  urlLink Pi , my god, it's so good.  It's really really really good, better than  urlLink A Beautiful Mind .  However, before you go see Pi, I have to warn you, it's quite the cult film.  At least I would think so...  it's one of those low budget films that has a very tight script and pretty decent editing.  There aren't any special effects and it's all character development.  Another thing: it's black and white.  But nonetheless, it's a kickass movie.  It's about a mathematician who's on the brink of discovering the underlying order of the Stock Market, but at the same time, Wall Street and religious fanatics are after the "number" that resides in the main character's head.   It's really good, like really, don't take my word for it, see it.  I want to learn how to play Go now.  Man movies own sooo much.

      My secret santa was Ruth, t'was easy guess.  I think the day after the secret santa drawing, I narrowed it down to Ruth, Andrew, Greg and the Girls.  After sometime I nixed the Girls, and then Greg and then Andrew, so I knew it was Ruth for like the past week or two.  Meh, whatever :D.  Uhm yeah, after work I went to Leslie's and I ended getting there at like quarter after 11 and apparently they had "jelly shooters".  Whooopdi doooo!  Whatever, I don't really care :p  Soon as I got there, I think it was time to leave as after I opened my presents it quickly went into "get the hell out" mode.  Blergh.  So after some stalling and a bit, the Aaron, Luke, Steve and I went to East Side Mario's for some wings and drinks.  Yeah, it was only like 24 dollars between the four of us, pretty sweet.  Then we drove back to Leslie's and I got into my car with Luke and Aaron went into Steve's.    On the way out, I began to Hi-Beam, Steve and we basically started to race.  Steve however, decided to hog both lanes, so.. being crazy like I am, checked to make sure there was no oncoming traffic, and floored the mother fucker to about 100 on country court, in the oncoming traffic lane.  Wooo!  Yeah, passed Steve easily.  Then there was some more racing down Steeles and I stayed in front :D yay!  Then I went home.    End of story.  Also, I said something to Liz today, and she said something back, yay the joys of communication. :0

      Yeah, work sucked today.  I woke up like 5 after 10, and was like... "holy shit, batman.", because I usually need to leave like at 10:30ish in order to make it to work on time, so I was like crap, I have 25 minutes, and I'm dead tired... shower or eat?  I chose the former, as I usually do, and decided to cleanse myself in the daily ritual of showering.  So at around 10:30, I was out the door, hair wet, shirt unbuttoned, shoes untied, and jacket mangled.  It wasn't a pretty site I tell you that much.  When I got to work, someone graciously bought the whole place doughnuts, and I got a honey glaze one.  mMmmm Honey glaze.  The best couple of flavours would have to be: Chocolate, Double Chocolate, Triple Chocolate, Boston Cream, and Honey Glaze.  Yep, free doughnuts rock!  So yeah, I had a doughnut, and I did the basic opening jobs, not too much trouble and the like, although I felt like shit doing them.  When I'm tired, I really don't want to talk to people, so for about 3 or 4 hours, I was working with my head towards the ground in hopes no one would ask me anything.  Unfortunately, the customers that show up at the Mandarin seem to be unable to find the washroom, nor follow instructions on how to go to the washroom, and seem to assume the most retarded of things.  Take for example, yesterday, a party of 15-20 white people where on the way out, and we said "Happy New Years" to them and they replied with similar salutations and the like.  One of the white guys however, took it upon himself to correct his peers by saying "Gung Hay Fat Choy".  He then went on saying, I quoten "If you're going to say it right, say it in  Japanese. "  For those of you out of the loop, "Gung Hay Fat Choy" is the Happy New Years saying for Chinese New Year.  Please note how I said Chinese.  Now, I've seen ignant... sorry, excuse the ebonics... ignorant white folk before.  But come-the-fuck-on, if you can't remember what language you're speaking from, then don't say it at all! It's fucking ridiculous, I just felt like gutting that bastard right then and there and end his miserable existence that he called a life.  Man, stupid people make me sick, sick to the fucking bone, it's not even the kind of stupid where you can pity.  It's the stupidity that exudes from ignorant ass fucks who are too busy watching their MTV and glancing at their Reader's Digest to fucking open their eyes for once and experience something outside of their own culture.  Fuck.  I hate you crackers, for being so stupid.  Another thing that makes me sick is when people come up to me when I'm moving about 300 or so dishes in this cart thing, which just came out of the washer and are steaming hot, and ask "Are those clean?"  No, you fuckwad, their not clean.  They just are boiling hot, came out of the fucking kitchen, and the steam you see evapourating is not from the excessive amounts of heat that these plates have been through in order to kill bacteria, but in fact, this vapour you see floating around is poison.  Yes, you heard me,  mother fucking poison.  The kind of poison that sits in your brain and eats away at your meniges and thus giving you menigitis.  Man fuck, you stupid cuntwads.  Get a life.  OF COURSE THEY'RE FUCKING CLEAN.  WHY ELSE WOULD I BE PLACING THEM IN THE PLATE HOLDERS.  OMFG, YOU THINK I'M STUPID ENOUGH TO PLACE 'DIRTY' PLATES IN THE FUCKING HOLDERS? NO CUNTRAGS.    GET A HOLD OF YOURSELF WHITE MAN, NOT EVERY ASIAN PERSON IS OUT THERE TO POISON YOUR CRACKER ASS.  AND IF YOU END UP GETTING FOOD POISONING, IT'S NOT BECAUSE THE FOOD WASN'T CLEAN, IT WAS BECAUSE YOUR DUMBASS SELF COULDN'T WASH HIS HANDS AFTER USING THE LATRINE.  OH GOD, SOMEONE GET ME AWAY FROM THESE NIMRODS.  Another thing is, people don't seem to understand how to follow instructions, or rather, they can't seem to understand how to get the fuck out of my way.  So I'm moving various take-out orders, from the kitchen, to the front desk, about a 50 m walk, and for those of you that haven't been to the Mandarin lately, people like to crowd the front area.  So, the vary people that I'm trying to give this food to, won't move out the fucking way so I can deliver it to the appropriate location.  I mean holy fuck, you complain of the extra 5 minutes that your sorry ass has to wait, and you won't move out my my fucking way to speed things up.  Good for you mother fucker.  Oh and this one lady, was a fucking dolt.  She spends maybe an hour, maybe even more, waiting outside with her whipped-ass boyfriend just so they could get a table.  No big deal, there's about 30 couples doing the same thing.  So they get to their table, and then she's like "I can't sit in this chair." (It's a folding chair, we run out of regular chairs during peak times) and she's like "It's uncomfortable, I need another chair, this just won't do."    And I'm like, you idiot, THERE ARE 30 OTHER COUPLES OUTSIDE WAITING FOR YOUR SAME TABLE, MY GOD, JUST DEAL WITH IT YOU STUPID PANZY.  And of course, her spineless boyfriend nods in agreeance, and says "Yeah, these chairs aren't very comfortable."  So they get out the manager, spend a good 15-20 minutes debating over some chair, and as Mandarin likes to put it "The Customer is Always Right." So we got that mofo her chair and she wasted at least a good 30 minutes of her life because she couldn't handle a folding chair.  My god, people these days, such fucking pricks and bitches.  Sure, you deserve service, sure you deserve courtesy, but WHAT THE HELL IS THIS SHIT?  YOU'RE NOT THE MOTHER FUCKING QUEEN OF ENGLAND, GET A GRIP OF REALITY KTHX BYEE GG SON.  Oh God, enough of this shit happens everyday, but today, I was running on like 5 hours of sleep and boy oh boy, I was fuming.  FUMING.  So yeah, the fact that I was tired, combined with the incredibly stupid mentality of Mandarin customers, seems to fumigate this CAPS LOCK side of me.  Yeah, dumb people need to be put on islands. qv Chris Platney.  On the other side, I caught up with Peter and stuff, he got trashed when he went clubbing.  After 4 drinks, he was wasted out his mind and he fell asleep in his bathroom when he got home.  Ouch.  Sucks for him :p  So, I'd assume I can take probably about 3 drinks before I get totally wasted.  'Cause we both suffer from Alcohol Flush or whatever.  wooOo!  I'm going to be working more than ever in second semester, I'm probably going to take some weekday shifts as well.  Gots to get paids.  Here's the thing though:  I doubt I'm going to get enough scholarships/busaries to cover even more than 30% of my tuition/living costs.  So hence, I'm relying on my own chink ass to front the money.  The problem is, if I put more effort into work, I'll have less effort going into school and probably not so stellar grades.  So, should I work a hell of a lot, make 20K by the end of summer, or stick to my guns and get good grades and hope people accept me and reward me for being a student.  Hmmm.  Decisions, Decisions.  We'll see, I haven't even applied to Uni yet.  I don't even know what I want to do anymore, this fucking sucks.  No one ever dreams to be a Electro-Mechanical-Aeronautical-Technician/Engineer for MX Unlimited located in Belfast Ireland when they're 10 years old.  (I made that up)  But, in any case, when you're 10, you don't dream of this shit.  You dream of becoming a mother fucking astronaut so you can blow up some invading martians and prevent Independence Day.  What the mofo, life sucks ass.  Lots of cursing, I think my New Year's resolution is to curse less.  But as we've already established, Fuck is such a versatile word, that describes so much anger and violence that I don't think any other word in the English language can even come close to a similar or synonymous meaning.  I mean c'mon, there's nothing as harsh as fuck.  So, swearing helps express anger.  Yay anger!  Other than lot's of swearing by me, and stupid people, and catching up on stories, the day was a dud.  Not much stuff happened, except their was some money controversy between the other bus boys because their stupid as fuck and like to take money that isn't theirs.  So whatever, not my problem.  And I hope this will be a lesson for all of you.    And if you haven't caught on, if you're going to be a bitch or a prick at a restaurant leave a 20% tip or more. It'll all go away.

      The time is ^:  Yeah, that's when I got home.   I called Aaron, like right after 12, after the cheering, loud noise makers, glass tapping, congratulations, and all that good stuff.  It was the first New Years, where I did anything traditional.  I was with a bunch of my co-workers, we all had glasses of champagne and we all did the cheers thing and knocked it back.  It felt good.  It was funny though, I'm the only person in the restaurant that gets nagged for drinking, although there are at least 3-4 other people that are underage as well.  Blah, whatever, I had my drink, and that was good enough.  Right after that, I called Aaron's place, to see if everyone was still there, and his mom said "They all went out for fireworks" and I'm like, "Shit."  So, I decided not to drop by.  That's why, if you're wondering.  After that, I munched on some food, helped out with some cleaning, and then headed over to Patty's place which is like on the far west side of Brampton.  I think I was near Queen and Chingcousy Rd. when we arrived at her house.  I can't remember if it was Patty's or Paul's.  I think it might have been Paul's place in retrospect.... but in any case, Patty and Paul are engaged, so it doesn't really matter anyway.  They live in the basement, of their parent's house, which let me tell you, is a really nice basement.  Not even joking.  This basement is extra furbished, with kitchen, bedroom, bathroom, living room, 4-6 other rooms that I couldn't open doors into.... man it was a sweeeeeeet basement.  On top of that, they had almost, if not more than 200 DVDs in their collection.  When we got their it was Black Ruth, Yellow Ruth, Patty & Paul, and Calvin.  Mind you, it worked as Patty & Paul, Calvin & Yellow Ruth, and Black Ruth and I.  So that was how the pairing went.  We sat around for a while, watched Austin Powers 2, and just chilled and had a good time.  Here's a interesting part:  I had to drive Black Ruth back to her house, which is like on Ray Lawson, because she was allergic to Patty's cats.  No big deal, the really funny part was, I had so much trouble finding my way out Black Ruth's place.  Oh man, I ended up driving down, and into County Court by accident.  It was funny, I'm like : "Uhmmm Bloomingdale? WTF!? I'm near LESLIES!?"  and yeah, after that, I knew where I was going.  Good waste of 15 minutes. :)  Yeah, after dropping Ruth off because she was ill, I went back to Paul's/Patty's and watched the rest of the movie and chilled.    Here I am typing.  Oh, btw, I have in possession a cell phone now.  It's my dad's old phone.  Whatever though, at least I have a phone now.  WOooo!  Phoneage!  Yeah, if you see me, ask for my cell! :)  and we'll swap numbers! and the like!  There's more stuff, like work stories and funny things that happened, but i'm so god damn tired right now, I can't think of them all.  Keep in mind, I have to wake up tomorrow... i mean today, at 9:30... that's in 5 hours, to get to work for 11.  yay!  Pretty eventful for a supposed "non-eventful" day.  SAWWWEEEEEEEEEEEET!!!!!!!!!!

      at around 2 PM.  I think I went to bed last night around 3 AM-ish, but I'm not quite sure, because I remember lying in bed for quite some time.  I just laid there, thinking, pondering, more or less reflecting.  I think I was watching Much Music's something or other before I went to bed, and it was basically encapsulating the year's events, the triumphs of various artists, the  faux pas  of others and other highlights of the year.  It really wasn't too special, but it I forgot about all the stuff that happened earlier in the year.  I was like: "Wow! That happened this year? That seemed so long ago..."  Well, not much has happened in the past 3 days, sorry for the lack of bloggage, but there's really nothing to talk about.  If you really want to know what happened the past couple days here ya go:  Woke up @ around 2pm, brushed teeth, ate breakfast (Michaelena's or whatever), played video games, watched movies, ate dinner, played more video games, slept, Rinse and Repeat.  Yeah, that's about it, nothing too exciting or glamourous.  But I sorta like doing nothing, albeit as sad as it seems, it's nice.  It's refreshing from all of the chaotic doing, going out and having a good time sort of deal.  It's refreshing from the brain draining activities of school and it's just nice to not do anything productive or worthwhile for once.  Like at this moment, I'm sitting here typing about how there's nothing happening, but I'm enjoying it.  Here's a couple of things I've learned about myself just by thinking:  - I still don't know the meaning of life. - I enjoy indie/cult/low-budget films a lot better.  Most of the time, they're just better. - There's a bunch of things I want to learn to do: Skate, Ski/Snowboard, Swim, Kendo, Traditional Dancing, Flare Bartending - I'd probably starve to death, or be living off Kraft Dinner if I were in my own apartment. - I'm really really really lazy.  Like seriously, I'm so lazy.  There was more... I went through a really long list last night, I guess, it all slipped my mind.  Blah.  Yay, celebrating the New Year by working.  Just great... just great.

      Wow.  I was really impressed.  This movie was really good,  it was pure badass.  I still don't understand why they charged the miniguns though, I would figure they would try to flank them or something, but I guess not.  It's really a good movie.  It's up there in best movies.  Honour, Valour, Courage, Pride - The Beauty of Samurai.  I really want a fricken katana now... or a big ass bow.  That's all I got.

      Apparently, I'm a very lucky person. So lucky, in fact, one person believes that I can bring them some sort of fortune via the lottery.  So, I've been asked to pick a set of numbers for 6/49 and Super 7 for them.  Wow, that's pretty crazy if I say so myself.  But whatever.  In any case, I'll be picking some numbers in the next couple days, whatever I see, will go onto my card.  And maybe just maybe, it'll be some winning numbers.  Other than that, work was pretty much the same old same old, but I had only a single shift today.  Thus, the day was short for me, but not without its stories.  People kept saying I was lucky, and well, I guess I am, in a sense.  Also, I had a good time joking around with Yellow Ruth.  She didn't know what "friends with benefits" meant.  So I had a really fun time explaining it to her.  Here was how the conversation went:  Yellow Ruth:  "Now that you have all that money, we can be friends." Danny: "I already have alot of friends, what I  do  need however, is a  friend with benefits. " Yellow Ruth: "I don't know what that means. Do you mean a girlfriend?" Danny: "I'd like the have a girlfriend, but this is a different thing." Yellow Ruth: "Then what do you mean?" Danny  really loudly : "Two Friends.  Have Sex.  No Strings"   Everyone in the room laughs.  Thomas goes "YEAH BUDDY! That's what I'm TALKING ABOUT!"   Yellow Ruth quietly: "You mean fuck buddies? and Did you have to be so loud?" Danny: "Yes, Yes I did.  So you wanna fuck?"  okay, I didn't actually say "So you wanna fuck?" but, if I did, it would have made a better story :p  The rest of it is how it happened however.  She then commented on how I could be so perverted.  Blargh, Yellow Ruth can never tell when I'm joking, that's the one thing that pisses me off. It's a joke. Laugh jesus.  That's the highlight of my day, the fact she didn't know what friends with benefits meant.  Also, today, Calvin and I had a pretty cool conversation, turns out he's like an older version of me.  Parents born in Viet, Grandparents born in China, he's born here.  Hang out with white people as he was in school, and still does.  Has some asian friends.  His parents do factory work.  Man, it's like the fricken twilight zone.  The similarities between us was astounding.  It's like I found me in a older form.  Pretty weird.  He's a cool guy, and he's kinda like me too, very subtle and blunt.  Told me straight up that I should be macking on some girls or some shit, and have some fun and try to loose the geek look.  I didn't tell him, but I sorta like the geek look. :p  It's me. :)  Other than that though, the day was a dud.    Everyone that I hang out with, from work that is, went clubbing tonight.  I couldn't go because I'm not 19. Duh!  So yeah, I'm gonna hear some crazy stories when I get back to work.  Wish I was 19 now.  Blargh :p  And by clubbing, I mean downtown Toronto clubs.

      Survival.   I just watched the first half of  urlLink Battle Royale ... holy fuck, 21 kids dead in the first half.  I'm not even talking about nice clean ones either, I'm talking about, here's an axe, and I'm going-to-bludgeon-you-in-the-head-to-death sort of deaths.  So many outcomes already used.  So many deaths.    For those that I haven't informed already, Battle Royale is a movied based on the fact that in Japan, sometime in the near future, because of economical strife, many parents commit suicide, die, or whatever, and essentially leave a new generation of children.  These children, without parents, without homes, become rebellious and attack teachers and other adults.    In order to control these children, a class of students (40 or so) is randomly selected every year to participate in the Battle Royale.  Simple name.  Simple rules.  One Class.  One Island.  3 Days.  No Holds Bar.  Last one to survive, leaves.  The sad part is, this is exactly what would happen if such a thing were to occur.  For example, at one point a couple of these girls tried to organize some sort of peace deal, but then someone just brought out their mac-10 and wiped them all out.  Couples commited suicide in order to avoid killing.  Those who were weak and fat, died in the first 12 hours.  Those who possessed strong weapons such as a MP-5 Automatic submachinegun, died due to unneeded bravado and stupidity.  I can imagine all these things actually happening.  It also talks about past Battle Royales, as it's funny, how this couple survived until the end.  And btw, when 3 days passes, and there's more than 1 survivor, everyone dies.  So, as the 72 hour struck, their necklaces that cannot be removed started to tick, tick, tick. They both shot each other in order to survive.  Kinda sad really... lovers turning on each other.  But in the end, that's what we all boil down to, survival.  This movie is really good.  Really.  It's really really really good.  It's in Japanese, but still, it's honestly one of the most exciting, original, and stupendous movies I've ever seen.  Go see it!

      Curling today was pretty entertaining, in fact, it's been a while since I've felt this nervous about doing anything.  I use to feel nervous when writing tests and the like, but after a while, it just never was the same.  There was no fear, no apprehension.  Only calmness set in.  And today, it was different.    I drove Eleshia or however you spell it, down to the Chingcousy Curling Club and we were almost late, but fortunately, the place was unaware of 6 schools coming for games and didn't prepare enough sheets for all of us.  So... we were delayed by about 15 or so minutes, which gave us ample time to make it.  North Park won the toss, and they obviously took the hammer.  We chose red, (who wouldn't chose red honestly, red is lucky!), and in the first end we didn't fair so well.  The ice was fresh so everything crawed and barely passed the hog line.  It was kinda sad, I put too little weight on a guard, and too much weight on a take-out, and not enough curl so my two rocks were useless.  :/  By the First End, North Park was up 2.  The second end faired much better as we knew how the ice was and so, our rocks were nicely placed.  I gotta give a lot a credit to our skip though, David, 4 points for us in this one :) !  So, the score is 4-2, we're going into the 3rd end, and well, we had to get some subs in because a bunch of people had to leave for work and the like.  Eleshia, who hasn't curled since tryouts (1 time), was forced to play so, well, we were fucked as we had no guards after she threw.  :/   North Park had 2 sitting in the house and a guard out so we were clearly screwed.  I made two really sweet takes outs, as I smashed the two rocks in the house straight out.  It was good :) WOOoo!  They could have been better though >,  We're going into the fourth end, last end of the day, with them being up by 1, and me sitting and watching 'cause we have to sub people in and out to get some playtime for all, and I was like sheeeeeeeit!  To make a long story short, we wasted 4 rocks, and so did they because they had a gimp player as well.  They were sitting 1, and we had 1 out on the edge of the house and we had the hammer.  Let me tell you, David made a really nice shot, as he took out their 1 and thus giving us 2 points and the win.  THE WIN!  Yep, Mixed Team: 1-0 WOOooooooooOOOOOOOOOOOO!  That's curling for ya.  Uhm, other stuff...    Yesterday was same old same old, did some crazy stuff during lunch, almost killed myself.  I hopped over a lunch table to chase Hannah, but I almost slipped on my scarf, but I didn't and off I went!  Yeah, that's about it.  Oh, and I slept for like 5 hours between 6-11 as I was just going to "lie down" and bam, out for 5 hours and no one woke me up :/  Today, school, nothing much as I didn't do much in Bio, Math, Chem or Eng, so yea that's about it!  Only thing I got is :  HHHHHHHHHHHHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD!

      So yeah... another O.C. to cap off another interesting day.  Sometimes I wonder if people are video taping our lives and reporting back to The O.C. writers where upon they write a script that have our nuances and the like.  I know that's not possible, but what-the-hell.... the parallels are endless! ENDLESS I SAY!  Because seriously, I think everything that Seth does, we have each done at least a countless number of times.  Countless. It's ridiculous! This has been, I think, the first television character that I can relate to.  This is fantastic, fan-fricken-tastic.  So today was the first day back, not so bad, aside from the lack of sleep and snow, the day was pretty good in its own right.  First period was a dud, as Crawford didn't show up until about 9 o'clock, which gave Luke, Andrea and I plenty of time to catch up on stuff.  I think at one point I brought up  urlLink Jansport  backpacks and how they're so cool, and in particular  urlLink this one .  It has built in headphones!  It has to be also noted that Luke has failed his challenge and no longer reserves the right to challenge.   Hence he is now to be deemed a "panzy".  Second period was math, and I didn't do too bad on the Probability Test, faired pretty well, but nothing spectacular.  Mediocrity at its finest.  3rd was Chem without Mercier so it was fun.  The supply tried to pull some sort of nazi bullshit in order to keep us inline, and at my first opportunity I just mocked her.  She said "You shouldn't speak unless spoken to." at one point, and so when she called my name during attendance I replied with "Am I allowed to speak now?".  She smiled.  I like being a smart alec to teachers who think they can control me, in fact, I like to be a pain in the ass to anyone who thinks they have power over me.  After that, I handed Hannah her gift and she was delighted.  It's good to know she's happy, because between me and you, she seriously got 'streaked' by some sort of crazy hair dresser.  4th was Lunch and Lunch was the same as always.  Some arm wrestling here or there, some arguing about the arm wrestling.  Proceeded with arguements about the technicalities of arm-wrestling which of course preceeds the ever debated discussion of who's the best.  It was quite humourous in my opinion and then there were a lot of conversations going on.  Go conversations!  Fifth = dozing in and out.  Then I participated for a bit and then went back to "head on desk" and I got my last essay back.  Felt good about my mark.  So that ended the day nicely.  Too bad I have an exam tomorrow.  Blargh.  SAC:  Do I have even have to say anything?  I honestly think, some people, have no idea what plausible, possible, or affordable means.  Later days.  What a half-decent beginning to the 2004 school year.

      After reading Greg's post... I felt it was time for me to come clean and tell the world as well.  No, I'm not doing coke, or any sort of illicit drugs of the like.  Nor am I an alcoholic or anything remotely bad.  But, it does have similar problems much like Greg's.  Well, I'll start it off with this:  A couple of days ago, my father's and mother's company called for a meeting for all the staff.  This was never done in the 20-30 years that this company has been around.  Usually, messages are passed down from upstairs (the office) via memos to downstairs (the factory). They sat everyone down, gave them free NHD (the company's name) t-shirts, caps, and a booklet.  The booklet was entitled "Welcome to the 1st Annual Employee Budget Presentation".  The presentation began with frivilous information regarding the 2003 Monthly Percentage of Sales Plan Achieved, a few graphs describing it followed by other aspects of the companies revenues and profits.  In general, they had really good sales for a majority of the year, with a couple slumps in a few months, but not enough to counter the great sales.  The presentation proceeded with the mantra of NHD, one of those lame sayings like "Excellent Service + Great Workers = Quality Products" or some shit.  It had a neat circular diagram to go along with it to show the interconnectedness of each thing.   Bullshit.   After that, was an explanation of the need of the customers, regarding quality, quantity, creativity and a whole slosh full of business terms that my father or mother didn't understand.  I read the book over, and with my basic Economics language and business lingo, I read through the lines with no problem.  It then went on about competition, the business environment and the current situations that need to be addressed to continue the success.  This all in turn went into "How does this effect the company" sort of dealy, and a variety of changes, modifications and improvements that can be made to further profits and revenues.  Of course, this was only the first half of the presentation, as it then lead to, and I quote:    2004 Major Capital Expenditure Announcement    Marmon is Investing Heavily in NHD's future in 2004            -Two major capital expenditure announcments will be forthcoming          - One will be announced now and the other at the end of the presentations  The first major capital expenditure announcement relates to our purchase of a new facility    New facility! Wooo! More Jobs! More Revenue!.............................................  wrong.   And let me quote some more:   - 68 kMs from current NHD Plant [ 68 Kms directly on a map, but if you were to drive there, it would probably be around 80 ] -Almost directly off the 401 Hwy -High visibility area -Surrounded by Wal-Mart, Home Depot, Building Box & Canadian Tire   And even more:   Located at, 575 Conestoga Blvd.  Cambridge , Ontario -Approximately 100,00 sq. ft. -Site Allows for an 80,000 sq. ft. addition   Then it goes onto the "cool" things about this new place, as it has more electricity availablity, more storage space, more shipping/receiving doors and a whole bunch of other "cool" and "exciting" things.  Let me quote the important part:   All employees are encouraged to be a part of the Cambridge Plant.  -Timelines for relocation of our operations have already been established -NHD will  not  be renewing its lease at 70 Van Kirk Drive in Brampton -Operations in Brampton will be  discontinued  on July 31st, 2004   And then following that blow is various Canada Human Resources mumble jumble, about pay, vacation pay, incentives, etc etc.   You want to know how I found out about this?   Friday morning, I'm barely awake, my dad wakes me up and says "I have some bad news." Me, grumpily, replies with "What?" He goes "We might be moving to Cambridge." Me, some what unphased, probably due to the lack of awakeness, goes "When?" Dad goes: "In the summer" Me: "This summer?" Dad: "Yeah.... and by the way, your book[Quotations of Chairman Mao] arrived. Me: "Thanks..."  I then went out with my family later that day.  It didn't really sink in, and I don't think it has yet either.  What can I say?  I'm speechless.  Absolutely loss for words.  I felt angry for about 10 minutes on Friday, and then calmly switched into sadness as well, it's  Cambridge .  Soon to have an Asian population of 4 + the owners of their local chinese restaurant.  Jesus...  The worst part about this is my brother gets the short end of the stick.  All of his friends, all of them, ALL of them... reside in Brampton.  He's transitioning himself into High School next year and this... this happens.  It's going to be crap for him.  Honestly, I felt so bad for my brother, I felt so helpless as there was nothing I could do.  I couldn't comfort him much when he was tearing up, but I cheered him up as I diverted the topic and went into funny stories and the like.  It worked, but he must have beem dieing on the inside.  Everything he knows is here.  And now, most likely, we won't be here come next year.  I really don't want to leave either, my life is here, in Brampton, or moreso the GTA.  I'm really thinking of getting a place somewhere around here.  Especially if I get into UofT.  We'll see though.  If I get into UoW then I'm living in Cambridge... if I get into UofT well then... here I am to stay.  There's no way around this either, my dad said he would commute to and fro from work, and I'm like... that's almost a 1 hr drive to and back.  That's almost 2 hours of your life wasted everyday.  2 HOURS!  Can you really keep that up for the next 4 years?   I really couldn't let my dad/mom suffer anymore... they've already suffered enough for me, and I can't let them commute to and fro just because of me, or my brother.  I don't know though... I just don't know anymore.

      I have the next two weeks off thankfully, but in reality it isn't much of a blessing.  Work is fun most of the time, although there are some retarded times every now and then that just pushes my buttons which cause me to go beserk.  But other than that, I like work, and replacing work with studying is a bitch.  I read a book, did some studying and now back from watching a chinese movie entitled:  urlLink Truth or Dare: Sixth Floor Rear Flat .  Now, in most cases, long titles mean crappy movies, and in general that is true, however, this movie is good.  It's just about a bunch of twenty somethings getting a flat in Hong Kong and trying to achieve their dreams.  They play truth or dare continuously throughout the movie making sadistic jabs at one another while still maintaining a certain charm.  It's one of those coming of age movies really, but rather, coming to the fact that mediocrity isn't that bad, as many of these kids fail horrendously and yet some how make spectacular triumphs and victories.  I really enjoyed this movie, it was good, and I saw it on Omni-1.  Not bad. It's in Cantonese by the way ;).  But other than that, yesterday and today has been filled with reading and movie watching breaks in between.  Not much to say really, other then ahhh exams!  Oh and I've recieved emails from these schools:  McMaster Waterloo Queen's  Mailing packages from:  McMaster   ______   Apparently, Waterloo stuff is coming in the mail, and I don't know about Queen stuff, and I've heard nothing from Toronto.  Good Sign? Bad Sign?  Who knows?!

      I'd blog, but it takes about 30-45 minutes to put out a real blog entry and hence this will be a condense version because I need to study.  Today I slept alot in all my classes.  1) Bio class - Same old same old.  2)Math class - sleep  3)Chem Class - I did some questions.  4) Lunch, omg, I'm a gambling master, I pulled one out of the fire today.  I started in late, because they started in 3rd lunch, so everyone donated be 10 dollars so I had 30 "dollars" to start off with.  We were playing Texas or is it Texan, Hold 'em with poker chips.  So anyway, after about 10 games or so, I was around 50 dollars, not much really, because Steve had like 200 and Luke with 100, and Roanna was eliminated shortly afterward.  I really enjoy gambling, it's 75% luck, 25% skill, which is pretty sweet.  And between you and me, I'm a lucky son of a bitch.  So, after a more games, I was down to 18 dollars, which is pretty bad, but oh man, I pwned Luke hardcore for like 2 hands as I went  all-in  on two hands.  He had pretty good hands, but I beat him one time with a full-house and a flush the next.  It was hardcore.  HARDCORE!  Yeah, that put me to about 100.  Those were some sweet hands I must say, and when the bell rung, we played one last game, and let me tell you it was the funniest hand I've ever played.  Texas Hold 'Em, for those unaware, works like this:  1- Everyone is dealt two cards 2-Bet 3- Three cards are shown on the table , the "Flop", and by using the two cards you have you can make a hand with the cards shown the the table. 4-Bet 5- One more card is shown on the table,the "Turn", again same thing as step 3. 6- Bet 7- A final card is shown, I believe this card is known as the "River Card" 8- Bet 9- The "Showdown" where you show your cards.  Simple eh? It's really fun if you're playing with  actual  money... *cough *cough  Okay, back to the last hand, so now that you all know how to play kinda...  It went like this: (suits are unimportant)  I was dealt a 5 and 3, while Luke was delt a 9 and a Jack.  The Flop: a 6, a Jack, and a 10. The Turn: a 4 The River: a 2.  Now, we showed hand, and it was all-in for everyone so, this was going to be the last game, so there was really no betting what so ever.  However, when we showed hand, I was dissapointed, because I though I had lost, because I flipped my cards in that dissapointed way and Luke jumped out and said "I WIN!!!!!" and upon second glance, I was like... "No you don't, I do"     PWEND!   And with the river, Danny makes a straight, trumping over Luke's measly pair of jacks.  Victory was mine.  IT was sweet. WOOOOOOOOOOOO  After retirement, I'm going to become a professional gambler, much like  urlLink Danny Dang .  So yeah, I like gambling... :p  5) English - slept. 6) went home, and then wasted some time, ate, then fell asleep by accident, woke up at like 10, and just finished bio lesson 6.  Now, off to studying. later kids.

      I was once told that Wednesday was called "hump day", it was probably from some white girl long long ago that I didn't care much about, but fancied about anyway because she was white.  I think I asked her what she meant by "hump day" and she replied with some sort of authority by saying in an excitied gitty voice:   "It's the day in the middle of the week[Wednesday] and when you're there, that means you're over the hump and the week is almost over!"   I then remembered I mocked her or something after that... but in anycase, that phrase has been ingrained into my memory.  So yep, Wednesday, the day of Wed and Nes.  TV was dissapointing, Apprentice was old, Gilmore Girls was old.  And such I reverted to good ol'  urlLink Counterstrike .  But prior to that, the day was pretty good.  Bio, Math were pretty good, I managed to be somewhat alert in both of these classes.  Which allowed me to actually participate, think about it, PARTICIPATION! Crazy, it feels like grade 9 again, when I actually answered questions and wanted to.  Wow.  Today was a good day, math felt somewhat enlightening for once, rather than the same old drudgery of calculus and such.  Chem on the other hand wasn't as fun as usual, I think I ended up offending Hannah like 6 times today.  I think I made various meat remarks and various anti-gay remarks.  Do I regret saying those things? No. But I really don't like to offend people, because truth be told, I don't like to be offended either, so, Chem was just a lot of "You're stupid".  Whatever, I'm okay with people being gay, I'm okay with people doing gay things, I'm even okay with the legalization of various gay activities such as gay marriage.  But the one thing that I'm not okay with, is that being gay is "Okay".  Being gay, is  NOT  by any means, "okay".  Gay, Homosexuality, and all of it's constituents, is something that is completely immoral, wrong and should  not  be encouraged in future generations.  Don't get me wrong, you can perform as much sodomy as you want, but you cannot say being gay is normal.  It is not.    The main use for sex is reproduction, sure pleasure all nice and fun, but the real reason is for reproduction.  And if you're not here to reproduce, then you shouldn't be here at all.   To sum it all up, gay is not good, although I don't think gay people should be slaugtered, isolated or whatever, it just shouldn't be encouraged.  Get it? Got it? Good.  Another thing, people who don't eat meat for moral reasons should be eaten by a shark or a tiger, and then tell me that was immoral.   (I realize they would be dead and unable to communicate.)   Gah, BLAH, ARGH, DARGH!  At the end of the day, woo, Trivial Pursuit: Pop Culture Edition.  It was sweet, a marathon of games, it took us nearly 3 hours to complete the game, but it finished.  People being lazy, couldn't pick teams, so I just picked the teams as follows[excuse the spelling]:  "Mahotra + What's her face" "The boys: JP, Greg and myself." "The couple: Andrew and Adeel w/ Adam later on" "The other couple: Sunny and Andrea w/ Riyaad later on."  It was a pretty close game, near 5 o'clock we all had all the pieces, and we must have spent the next 45 minutes trying to fricken win the game.  It was ridiculous.  And for the love of god, I can't stand playing games with people who have to sit there and think it out for 20 minutes.  God, we need those sand timers from boggle or some shit, 'cause honestly, the game took forever, I mean,  forever , I swear to God, the second Ice Age passed while we were playing trivial pursuit.  But in any case, after like 30+ attempts from all the teams to win, Sunny + Andrea got a really easy winning question:  Q: "What BBC programme is the popular TLC Trading Spaces show based on?"  (or something like that) ANS:  Changing Rooms   Yeah, so they won, but it didn't really matter, we all wanted to leave, and you can't just leave a game without a winner... that would be.... insane.  And did you know the Dalai Lama wears a Rolex watch?  I betcha you didn't!  BECAUSE HE DOES!  After some googling, it was a gift from Franklin Rosevelt.  Back to the point, the game was several lifetimes, and I must have been reincarniated at least twice, as well as several Ice Ages must have passed through because when were were done, it must have been like 6 o'clock and there was a tonne of snow outside.  It took me like an hour to drop JP and Greg home, which normally takes about 20 minutes.  Driving   Okay, whatever, the moral of this blog is:  driving in freezing cold and snow = sux, trivial pursuit = long, gay = bad, meat = good, tv = boring, CS = ownsors, white girls = $$.  Peace out....  to the max!

      Just finished downloading and watching  urlLink Battle Royale II .  It's no  urlLink Battle Royale , but it still pretty good action-wise.  The original director, the one who directed the first one, died after a few months into the shooting of this film, so whatever, it doesn't have the same cohesion as the first one, no big deal, when people get blown up, it's damn cool. Another porblem is that there are a lot of familiar scenes from other action movies like Saving Private Ryan and The Rock.  But whatever, Battle Royale II is still a good movie nonetheless.  So, now, I've watched both movies, and I really really enjoyed them.  I think these two movies are my top 2 favourite movies so far. I haven't put much though into ranking movies I've seen, but these two are pretty high up on my list now.  It's really hard to compare movies, especially if they are of a different genre or context, for example, it's almost impossible to compare a cult film with a budget of 60,000 to that of a 100 million dollar blockbuster epic.  As both have their appeals and their fallacies.  But, I digress, most movies are pretty good, and these two are my two new favourites.  I know I must have said this for I don't know, maybe, 20 times a day, everday.  I just want school to  end .  I can't stand going to school anymore, I mean, the people are nice, the school is nice, I like the idea of learning, but I hate this stupid idea where I have to sit in class and osmos (the process of diffusion) information like I'm sort of sponge.  It's extremely retarded and  so  frustrating.  I felt so like shit today, as I bombed my Chem test, and then brooded over that one for a good hour or so.  I've come to the realisation, that school is possibly the most completely useless process ever.  Even jobs that use things that are taught in University Programmes, don't expect you to memorize them and apply them everday.  If you ever need to use that formula learned in 3rd year Uni, you open up your big ass reference binder, go to the index, and find that sucker.  It's not like everyday people ask you to derive and integrate hundreds of functions.  There's a reason why we invented computers, and that's to mother fucking compute.  Argh, school is useless, and that's the truth.  I got some package in the mail today from McMaster.  I wonder how much it costs for them to send these one page + booklet packages.  I mean c'mon, it's a waste of paper just to acknowledge the fact that they recieved my application.  It doesn't even mean you're in, in just mean they got your papers.  Man, what a waste.  24 is badass.  I forgot to mention earlier that the Mixed Curling team is 2-0.  Go us!  There's a whole shitload of stuff that happened in the past 5-6 days that I've neglected to blog about, merely because I've been too busy watching Battle Royale over and over again and the fact that I've gone from lazy, to shit lazy.  And today, for the first time since I don't know, forever, my computer crashed.  Some codecs weren't reading properly so my computer hung for some reason or another.  Blah.   Oh and, I really need to fix some things about this website, the links don't rollover which kinda annoys me.  I don't even know if it's a link or not half the time >,  Blah, anyway, later days.

      The time is 12:27, I'm suppose to be doing a myriad of bio assignments/work along with a mountain of Math and Chemistry homework.  I had about maybe 9 previous hours to do them, but I didn't do anything.  I just watched football, then a movie about football (Any Given Sunday) followed by some highlights of football.  Kinda sad eh?  Actually, I don't want any pity, becuase it's my fault for this, and tomorrow I'm going to be complaining that I'm so fucking tired and that I hate school, but in reality it's all my fault.  Like for the past 2 hours, I've been sitting at my desk, looking at my computer screen.  That's right, looking at my computer screen.  Fuck.  I hate this shit.  Anyway, yeah, I'm blogging just to avoid working and what the fuck was Brett Favre thinking?!  What a crazy cracker.  I know I know, fractured thumb and all, and various other people dying on him, but what-the-fuck.  He could have at least thrown it out of bounds or even yet, get saced.  BLAH.  Whatever.  Okay, I should be working and yet, I'm still typing about not working, wooo, someone needs to beat some sense into me.  AHhHhhHh.

      or lack there of.  Here's everything that I imagine my life to be:  1)Semester 2: Work Full Time & School Full Time - Make around 10-15k by the end of summer, which brings up my total cash that is owned personally by me, to around 20k.  2)Sept, 2004 - June, 2009: Get into some university, preferably Toronto and in a dorm, followed by Waterloo, and do Electrical Engineering possibly.  Meanwhile, on weekends work at the Mandarin making $20 an hour.  Do co-op during the breaks, and on weekends still work at the Mandarin.  Hopefully, by doing this, I'll be out of of university out of debt and with a nice buffer of cash.  Also, talk to Peter about getting an import car and get those really damn nice rims that keep spinning when you stop.  You know the ones that I'm talking about.  Hot Damn!  I figure if I'm going to blow money on anything, I better look good while doing it.  During this time,  take up flare bartending.  Oh yeah!  3)June, 2009 - *, *: Hopefully, by this time, I'll have a full-time job working for god knows what sort of IT company developing whatever needs be with a healthy salary.  I'm aiming at around 60k+ a year, maybe I'm aiming high, maybe I'm aiming low, but whatever, that seems to be decent in my opinion.  At the same time, still working at the Mandarin, because I need cash to fuel my constant car obsessivism.  Of course, around the age of 24-28, I'll hopefully find my wife, or at least someone to spend time with.  Wooo!  Sometime around here, get hired at a bar, stop working at the Mandarin and just do bartending and my fulltime job.  4) During my early 30s, if I'm married:  Slow down, stop working at a bar/restaurant, and just concentrate on my full-time job and my wife.  If I'm not married, well it's party 24/7 over in Danny Land.  5) That's all I got.   ____   Who knows maybe I might do none of these things and take another route.  Time will tell.

      I feel better today, at least good enough to stop brooding. RWAR!  Good news is that I've completed two exams now, one where I failed and I think I aced my English exam.  It was pretty easy, the English exam that is, it was only 30 multiple choice from a 5 page reading.  There were some tricky questions, but overall I think I got at least 28/30 on that baby.  So yeah that cheered me up.  After that exam, I left the parking lot and on my way out of the school parking lot, I noticed that my rear windshield was completely covered in snow, so I pulled over near the Doors by Kennedy and wiped them off.  On my way back into driving, I almost got hit by a car driving.  I wasn't too scared, he stopped and I kept going.  I figured if I were to get hit by a car, I wouldn't see it coming and I'd probably be completely oblivious to it.    Even better news is that I cleaned up all the damn clutter off my U-desk and stacked all my cds and stuff into a neat little pile.  Took me a while, and now my table is much neater, cleaner and now I actually have table space to write.  Woo!  Also, today I got my Toronto Mail Package, and yesterday I got my Queen's packaage, and that my folks, is all of them.  No need to worry about lost mail now, I can finally rest at ease for that.  Too bad I need teacher recommendations now... man fuck, now I wish I sucked up even more for the past 4 years.  You know what I'm talking about, the kids that suck up the most always get the better comments and responses.  Ah blood clot.  I realise I haven't been filling out scholarship forms and in fact I've actually only filled out 1 out of the 50-100 that the deadlines have already passed.  Kinda sad.  I'm not even trying to get free money, but in reality, do I even stand a chance?  All those white girls living in Timmins probably have their own "Save-The-World" organization with just a rehashed name *cough Student Without Borders *endcough.  So yeah, I've lost some hope in that aspect.  In other news, today I did some exploration of Brampton as I went on some roads that I don't ever take.  I went to buy some Roasted Pork at the place beside New Asia, the place were Aaron works, and it was pretty interesting.  Got the pork, and I realized that Queen Street was just gridlock so I went North hoping to find another road to turn on.  I ended up on Vodden, then Howden and then I think Williams Pkwy and then back onto Bramalea.  Driving without really knowing where you're going is exciting.  :o  So yea that's about it, not much to say, except WORLD OF WARCRAFT BETA SIGNUP IN THE NEXT WEEK! OMG GOSU!

      God, I hate myself.  I can't describe how crappy I feel right now.  Honest to God,   Worst. exam.  ever.    It's not even because I didn't know the shit, which I didn't, it was because I didn't study enough.  FUUUUUUUUCCCKKKKKKKK.  There's no one to blame but myself, but fuck.  FUC KFUC FUC KFUCK! ARGH.  Honest to god, I fucked that test up so bad.  Apparently it doesn't "count" but I know it does.  It so does.  Although it isn't like a major influence, it still has some influence, so fuck.  Man fuck. FUck FUck Fuck.  I hate myself.  Okay, enough of that shit.  Fuck.  God, fuck fuck fuck.  So here we go, I bombed that exam, the past couple days have been filled with studying on and off, and shit, I didn't do enough of it.  I explicitly remember how shitty I did - very.  Other than that, this week has been decent.  Blargh.  It's funny how I'm going to have a higher mark in English than Math.  The world is coming to an end.

      I splurged today.  Bought myself:  Lost Highyway Requiem for a Dream Reservoir Dogs and Donnie Darko  all for as little as $63 something something.  Not too shabby, and I also had an interesting conversation with the sales person at Sunrise Records.  He commented on the weirdness of my choices, and I replied with "I like weird."  And then he went on to listing several other titles that I've already downloaded and seen, and then he recommended some more which I hadn't seen.  It was pretty enlightening for that 5 minutes of conversation.  Too bad, right now I can't remember any of the titles that he mentioned as my memory is uber shotty right now and it's not letting anything in.  Oh well, it was a pretty sweet conversation nonetheless as I actually learned something... well I did and then forgot it >.  What I did gather from it is that I need to live in Toronto in order to rent movies that are ridiculously rare.  Apparently there are several stores downtown where I could rent movies that no one even has even heard of or have posession of that are really good and extremely "weird".  He named off a couple places and asked if I had membership to any of these places to which I had to regretably reply with "No."  He then went on to suggesting that I should visit such places, and now it's in my mind.  Don't you just love mental notes? :p  That's about it, back to studying I go.

      After I finished typing last night's entry, about 10 minutes later, my manager called and asked if I could work tomorrow morning.  I indifferently, said "sure."  It didn't really sink in until afterwards that I would have to wake up early, and miss a good 5-6 hours of studying.  Blah what a fuckass.  QV:   Donnie:  You are such a fuckass!   Elizabeth:  Did you just call me a fuckass?! You can go suck a fuck!   Donnie:  Oh, please, tell me Elizabeth, how exactly does one suck a fuck?!   and my most favourite quote of the movie was:   Gretchen:  Donnie Darko? What the hell kind of name is that? It's like some sort of superhero or something   Donnie:  What makes you think I'm not?   Yeah, I watched  urlLink this very movie  after I got that dreaded phone call.  It really cheered me up to watch something kickass and good.  This movie is now my favourite movie, and as you can see, I have a new favourite movie almost every 2 seconds.  But, I'm not kidding, this movie is really good, I'd rate it 4.9999 out of 5.  It's not quite a 5 because there could be a better movie out there somewhere.  But this movie, is damn good, it's really worth a watch.  Next on my to-watch/buy-list:  Memento Amelie Requiem for a Dream Mulholland Drive Lost Highway

      I'm not one to gloat (not since Grade 10 anyway, after my "reform") but I'm going to do so anyway.  My best friend, logic, (sorry Riyaad; you're a close second! :p) tends to always lead me in the right path.  Sometime ago, I thought taking academic English would be the most beneficial for me, marks wise.  I said to myself "I could put up with these retarded kids... I've been doing it for the past 10 years." har har.  So, indeed the results are in and yes I'm damn glad I took Academic English over Enhanced.  I love arguing with people, but that usually takes effort and trumping over Academics was easy as pie.  Hell, I slept through at least 2/3 of the class and still managed to get so god damn high, I can't even believe it myself.  It was a simple process, when ever I was conscious in class, I would shut everyone up by stating  the correct answer.  It was a simple routine, sleep for 40 minutes, wake up, answer 2 or 3 questions brilliantly and knit. Didn't take much effort on my part.  The best part is when I walked over Gurpatap (I hate him) and Minesh.  Anyway, the real point of this gloating is to point out how stupid everyone else is and how we should stop competing with each other, form the "Super Frie.... I mean.. Super Team" and start conquering the world.    Anyway, my plans are all awry now.  My chem mark is so horrid it's bringing down my average hardcore.  HARDCORE.  I'm so unbelievably fucked.   My working scheme has been fucked too, argh, I was so damn close too... I won't know the real result until tomorrow.  I just had to open my mouth.  If I left early like I attended too, I would have been promoted without worries.  Now, I don't know.  FUCK.  The plan btw, was for me to work full time as waiter.  Yes, I actually do need to work fulltime.  Now that I can't rely on my parents for any money.  What a let down.  Argh, so much things happening at once.... it's driving me insane.  I need a baseball bat and some melons..

      Today... today was great.  It was better than great.  No not great, stupendous.  No no... superfluous.  That's not even the right word.. it was  urlLink Fantastic .  There was a lot of other stuff today.  I like to say I can predict the future.  Only because of patterns and logic.  I think sometime yesterday I said, "I bet you 10 dollars Sunny, that the Blizzard servers are going to get swamped and crash."  Or something of that nature... and guess what?   The great magnificent website went from glory and greatness to this:    urlLink         Yeah, approximately 100,000 maybe visitors trying to receive data from a server may do that.... I can't even apply to Beta yet.  Blimey!  Reminds me of the time when I signed Slavica's yearbook and said something like this: (keep in mind, we were "friends" at the time)  "Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah, You are cool, blah blah blah, Blah, you know, in high school it's going to be different, we're going to meet a lot of new people and stuff.  I really hope you don't go off and hang out with the cool people and ditch me.  'Cause you're such a great person and blah blah blah".  Shallow People are so easily to read.  And that was like 5 years ago.  Is it just me or does Mario Kart Double Dash lack the need of the same amount of powersliding that Mario Kart 64 has?! I only played for like 20 minutes but still, I noticed that I didn't really need to powerslide that hard to make corners and stuff.  Weird.  Family Guy owns, I laughed so hard when I saw the picture where Peter is eating a hotdog in front of like a dozen Ethiopians.  Hahahhaha.  Oh man, I'm going to hell.  Here's possibly the craziest thing I've ever done next to shopping cart racing... I was on a skateboard with no trucks or wheels, holding onto Steve's van, while he went driving around in the snow upwards of 40km/h.  Fucking insane, it was the most exhilarating thing I've done in quite some time.  Fucking awesome.  And then, omg, Steve showed us how he can do a 180 turn with his handbreak, and god damn, he's so good at it.  You know those car chase scenes where the car goes into reverse, does a 180 and speeds off into the distance?!  Well... HE DID THAT!  Fucking insane.  This whole night has been insane. INSANE TO THE MEMBRANE.  Uhm whatelse... Oh, I learned how to do some snowboarding today.  In 2 hours I learned kinda how to carve heel side, and I'm working on my toe side.  I also tried to do a couple jumps too, because Aaron, Luke, Alex, Ryan and I went snowboarding at the Heart Lake Conservation Centre [cursid X-Country].  But yeah, it was hell-a fun, because I'm pretty sure we were tresspassing as we hopped over one of those outhouse-parking-stick things to get in and we used "The Bowl" to snowboard around.  It was so much fun, but I got hurt pretty bad trying to carve and trying to make jumps.  Because later in the night, around midnight, we built a ramp in the middle of the hill and we did some crazy stuff.  I didn't land anything, but man, did I have fun.  FUN FUN FUN!  Oh, in the park, you can see the stars so clearly, it was amazing.  We just lied there for a good 10 or so minutes just looking at the stars and talking about time travel.  Man, that was cool.  Yeah after that, we left around 1 AM, went to Shooters, played some jitz, and Ryan is so damn good at that game.  He honestly owned us single-handedly and then some.  And after that... around 2 AM .... we went to Timmies and got some drinks.  We met a friend of Ryan's named D.J.  That's a cool name "DJ".  He had this cap too, that said "AZN Albino"  (cause he was white).... funniest thing ever.   Yeah and now I'm here... shit am I exhausted.

      My life consists of the following:   1. Gaming    2. School     3. Work     4. Movies/TV     5. Memories    1.  Alot of Xbox and PS2 games give me motion sickness.  Ever since the release of Sega Saturn and whatever their inbox title was, I've experienced motion sickness in games that have horrid camera handling that are fast paced or deathmatch style.  The primary culprit of today is Halo.  Oh my god, my head hurt so much after playing Halo for like 2 hours   Here's the highlight of my day:  From  urlLink Blizzard :  --January 26, 2004-- World of Warcraft Beta Signups This Week! At 6:00 pm PST on Wednesday, January 28th, the signup period for the World of Warcraft Beta Test will officially begin. We will provide a link to the beta-test application right here in the news section at that time. Testers are not going to be chosen on a first-come, first-served basis, so you will be able to submit an application and receive equal consideration anytime during the signup period, which will end on Wednesday, February 4th at 6:00 pm PST. Please note that multiple submissions from the same household will result in complete disqualification.   For this initial phase of the World of Warcraft beta test, we will only be able to accept applications from Canada, Korea, and the US. The test for Europe and other countries around the world will happen later this year. Please do not contact us for further information regarding the beta test; we will be posting a FAQ in the days ahead.    I'm excited... so excited I'm excited.  Holy crapola am I excited.  You should be too! Oh man, OH MAN OH MAN OH MAN! Someone needs to save me.   2.  Can you believe it folks?  It's finally over.  Semester 1 is no more, it's a thing of the past, something only to be forgotten or reminisced about in the far future.  It's no longer reality, it's no longer the present, it's merely history now.  It's over.  Man... does it feels good.  I've given up on my Chem and Bio mark they're both completely useless to me now.  Except I need Chem for my programs, so I hope it doesn't mess everything up.   3.  Haven't gone to work in 2 weeks, starting up again soon, going to be interesting not going there for 2 weeks.  I bet a lot of stuff has happened and I'll be slow on the uptake and on the "in-loop"age.    4.  Watched  urlLink Underworld  today at Ryan's house.  Man he has such a cool house, although messy, he has alot of stuff.  He even has a Flat Screen TV in his room (not an LCD flat) which he got apparently for $100 at Best Buy on a clearance sell.  That's crazy, CRAZY.  Underworld was an okay action flick I would say.  I'm very into lore and fantasy, so if it has to do with vampire and werewolfs then I'm all in.  I was very into the plot and the action, and the acting wasn't horrible but it didn't have any flare.  I wasn't really impressed with it as much compared to Blade.  Because Blade had a lot of flare, while this had nothing, but nonetheless it was quite an entertaining watch.  It had its moments, it has plenty of plot holes and unrealistic sequences but still it was a good movie.  On top of that, it left a very open ended ending, so they could even make a sequel.  I hope they do, I want to see more Vampire vs Lychen action.     RAWR RAWR !  HISS HISS! RAWR! RAWR! !HISSS HISSS! [silver bullets flying] [Ultraviolet bullets wizz by]    5.  I had meatball sub today, reminded me of all the other times I had a sub (which were all meatball btw) and damn, are they ever good.  People don't eat meatball subs because it's "messy".  Well I don't know about you, but the superficial looks of something doesn't often determine how damn good it is.  Man are meatball subs good, all of you are really missing out.  Especially you vegetarians and people who don't eat meatball subs because they're "messy".  That's just dumb.  Talking to Ryan brought back a lot of memories of Chinese School, as we both attended a couple of years back.  Damn, we had a lot of fun those days.  I remember one time, there were about 100 of us running around collecting pine cones to throw at each other.  It was the greatest recess/breaktime ever.  Seriously, there were dozens upon dozens of kids carrying 5-10 pinecones, sprinting across fields chucking them at each other.  People even climbed up trees and handed out pinecones to people.  I also recall this one time when there was like a huge war between the oldest kids and the youngest kids.  It was sooo fun.  I remembered I sacked a couple of kids in between the eyes, and man was that gratifying.  I miss those days, so little worry.  I was told the OC was old this week, I missed it because I was studying.  EH?!

      I remember not so long ago, studying, remembering and all those things related to school use to be so easy.  I could retain information like  urlLink Ghost Writer .  To go off on a tangent, Ghost Writer was a damn good show, I never missed one, and for some reason or another it got cancelled soon after its first couple of seasons.  Stupid people... I even had one of those cool pens.  So back to the point, I could just sit in class, listen and  voila  instant retention.  Now, it seems so hard, seems so difficult just to grasp simple concepts and studying is becoming just that: hard.  I don't know what's wrong with me or what has changed.    I keep asking myself what it is, and I still don't know and it's just like a slow, pulsating nail that keeps drilling away at my brain, eating away at my intelligence.   urlLink Bad teachers ? Mercier is a horrid teacher and Crawford is impossible to pay attention for more than 10 minutes.  urlLink Lack of sleep ? I barely get more than 5 hours a day now.  urlLink Lack of drive ?  I really don't feel like going to school anymore, but the years past it's been like that.  But I dunno, I have been slacking a lot lately. Or am I just old?  Who knows, I don't know, the best I can do know is just read and hope everything stays in my head for the next couple of days.

      You might have noticed the lack of postage in the last couple of days.  Well,  I manage time poorly as well as have an overwhelming need to procrastinate, so I tend to let things sit on the backburner for a long time.  I haven't posted in the past couple days because of 1 - too much work, 2 - too much strees, 3 - my eyes burn, 4 - all of the above!.  But yeah, I'm starting to get use to it now so it's no big deal.  Let me start off with explaining what semester 2 is like for me:   6:00 AM ---  Wake up, shower, eat.  7:40 AM ---  Out the door  7:55 AM ---  Arrive at school   8:15 AM - 9:30 ---  Physics w/ Regular  My class is tiny, there are only 16 people, that's one person per science table.   SCIENCE TABLE  - those big ass mofo tables.     9:35 - 10:50 ---  IB Math, same as always.   11:00-12:10 ---  Computer Science - it's fun and it's not too hard so I like it a lot.  THe rest of my day is filled with homework-doing until 5 PM, where I then leave to go to work.  Occasionally, games are played, or movies are watched, or clubs/meetings are attended.  But other than that, nothing much happens to me except a lot of work.  So, hence my life is a complete bore now.  Today for example, I went through all my periods being me, and then I went to Gabe's at period 4 and we watched Old School.  It's a hilarious movie I have to say.  It was really short though, and a loose ending, but what do you expect from such a movie?  So yeah, good movie, I could have liked it better if it was longer and had a better ending, or they could have thrown in more Elisha Cuthbert.  In either case, I would have been thumbs up!!!! :)   In totally unrelated news, I have insider information:  To all ACE members and Sport Team members, the Mandarin will be raising their Atheletic Banquet Fee from $14/person to $25/person.  Mr. Drivakos will be finding this out tomorrow, maybe he'll be able to negotiate something out, but remember, you didn't hear this from me.  I had a lot more to say, but running on 5 hours of sleep for the last 4 days is totalling me. back to homework I go.  And I almost forgot, Mr. Mercier is going down! - More info later.

      Time is flying, I don't know what's happening.  I spent most of Superbowl Sunday driving around in my car.  When I woke up my dad and I took the car to Mr. Lube's or someshit and he had whole lot of shit done.  I didn't know why, all I knew was the car was eating more gas than usual and it was reving higher than normal, I suspected something to do with the lack of proper gas circulation as that would lead to the decreased efficiency.  But what the heck, I don't know anything about cars, so I'm not going to even start.   Sooo, we wasted a good hour getting our oil changed, a free paper, free coffee, free 21 point check, some free air in our tires, whoever, we did spend like 100 dollars all together with the oil change, new something filter, and an engine flush, whatever that is.  After that I sped along the 410 to get down to Heartland Town Centre.  I got lost a couple times so I had to circle back until I finally found Tucker's Marketplace to meet up with Yellow Ruth, Liz and Calvin.  It was Liz's birthday the prior day, so I felt it was appropriate to celebrate or something.  I had a good meal there, I was dared to eat a waffle-gravy-cranberry-ham-vanilla ice-cream sandwhich, to which I did.  It wasn't that bad, the sweetness of the ice cream cancelled out the gravy and ham so it wasn't bad at all.  Other than that it was a good 2 hours well spent and a nice use of 20 dollars.  After that, we went to Putting Edge and man do I suck at golf.  I made par on most of my holes with a few birdies here and there and my very first shot was an eagle (whole in one) but I had some really really really bad holes.  For like 3 holes I had double boggies and yea, it was bad.  But out of us four, I came second as Calvin beat me by like 8 strokes.  Pretty bad.  Oh well, it was fun and there was a lot of joking around and stuff.  I'm sure there's other stuff that I forgot, fuck it's almost 1 am and i'm tired as shit as I just came back from work.  FYI, Fourth Lunch Sucks.

      Yeah, I fucked up my promotion.  For those who don't know, I wanted to become a waiter.  Legally, to do so, you need to be 18.  That is what I am not, but I was slowing creeping up on a "loop hole".  You see, no one at work really knows that I'm underage, nor even care, so, I just only told a select few how old I was.  So the plan was to not tell anyone my age unless they asked.  It was working pretty well, until yesterday, when the kitchen manager asked me how old I was.  17 slipped out of my mouth and that fucked everything up as all the managers then began to discuss what the legal age is, to serve alcohol.  They didn't know it off the top of their heads, but I knew I fucked up my chances right then and there because they were bound to find out the legal serving age by the next morning.  And today, it has been confirmed that I fucked up.  Blah, what the fuck.  In the anger that I felt, I sped down various streets, made all of my turns too fast, and at one point hit a curb pretty hard.  I think I might of misaligned something or dented something. Oh well, fuck it to hell.  Whatever, I hate my birthday. So damn far away.  On the bright side, today the Mandarin was filled with an exorbitant amount of hot white girls, more so than usual.  That made my day at least bearable as I felt like killing something.  There were these two girls, wearing these black dresses, one laced with hot pink and another with normal pink...  Let's just say, I wasn't watching where I was going for a large period of time.  Oh, and Peter is such a mack.  He honestly is a women-magnet.  Girls just flock to him and leave phone numbers.  It's an amazing gift and he doesn't even try!  It's crazy.  So crazy, I wish some of that would rub off on me.   Here's one of the many things that happened today:  Peter says a joke. Hot Girls (please note the 's' as in more than 1) laugh. I walk by to drop off their (the girl's)  take-out meal or whatever, and so they have to leave. Hot girls : "Do we have to leave?" I look at Peter in disbelief. He just smiles.  ----  Here's a  urlLink reason  why I wouldn't go to an anime convention. [Be warned, you will be scarred for life]

      It's true.  We all struggle here and there, some more so than others, but each struggle in itself is worth fighting for.  It's the fight that matters, the end product doesn't mean much, but it's what you did on the battlefield that counts, whether you chose to be a hero, or be a zero, whether you stormed the front or camped like a panzy, whether or not you chose to do the right thing, or to do what everyone else is doing - this is what it's all about.  The important thing about living is fighting, living up to your own expectations and not anyone else's.  It's easy to rely on others, but it takes great fortitude to rely on oneself.  Andrea told me after that Reinvent Your Identity presentation that I was just like that guy, not the issues part, but rather, the whole self-motivating part, and looking at it from my comfortable computer chair, I think Andrea's a little right, if not fully.  I like to rile things up, rock the casba, loosen a few bolts and screws, shake what your mama gave ya, but besides the retarded idioms, I truely, love to motivate.  Maybe I'm having one of those moments, maybe I'm just a little too tired, but heck, everyone has to be something.  I don't know if this applies to you or not, but I get the feeling from a lot of people that once you're out of high school that it's going to be all different.  I honestly think it'll just be the  same  for many of us.  For those of you living at home, it's  really  going to be the same, and for those of us going away, it might be slightly different, but in the end, the same.  Whatever nuances you have, whatever habits you've developed now, will always stay with you, all these attitudes that you have now, will stay with you come next year.  Next year isn't a new beginning, it's rather, a new chapter in a life that already began.  There isn't a second prologue, there isn't a new beginning, and there sure as hell isn't a reset button.  If you really think that you can  really  be yourself at University, what the fuck is holding you back from being yourself now?  I know nothing is holding me back.  So what's chaining you to your mask?  But hey, I'm not saying all of you are putting up fronts and hiding behind things, I'm sure there's a lot of genuine people out there, but I'm not going to know that, and to be honest, I doesn't matter to me, who it does matter to, is  you .  You're the one that has to live the life, not me, not your friends, You.  So just let yourself go, and have a little fun, expose yourself, I promise you, it isnt that bad.  The "new" Danny is just slightly more more loud, more obnoxious, more funny, and from what I can see, most of you enjoy having me around. The "new" Danny has been around since like September by the way.  It's the non-gelled, up-in-your-face Danny (ok, not really in your face).  Although I can never be certain if you're just tolerating my "new" self but I feel really relaxed now, no more tension, no more trying to impress people I don't even know.   And I tend to base my life around a few things, as I don't have a book to base it around *cough Bible *cough Quran.  There are serveral core beliefs that I believe in and many of you already know them, some of you might not, so I'll enlighten you on the mantra of Danny.  1.  Whatever floats your boat  - do whatever you want, however you want, whenever you want, as long as you don't hurt anyone or yourself. 2.  Nothing is impossible   - Anyone, can do anything, all you have to do is try. 3.  Word is bond  - Your words must be followed through, you're accountable for what you say and if you promise something, it's forever.  Those are the main three, there's a few more here and there but I can't grasp them at this momemt because I'm so tired.  But yeah, I know I don't follow my own rules all the time, I'm sure I've probably broken one or two promises in the past year, but I attempt to live by all of these things, and that's good enough.  I dunno, maybe all of you have been truthful to yourself your entire lifetime, and if you are, kudos to you, but if you aren't, then maybe you should just sit down and reflect.  It always helps.  But yeah, enough of this talk, i'm just babbling on a lot and truth be told, whatever floats your boat man, I really could care less if you're a complete fraud as long as you know that you are.  Because, not knowing who you are is quite sad...

      Curling, 4-0, my last game was a joke.  We had played with 3 people, against a team of four, and Julie and Dave were both tired as hell as they played a game prior to this one.  (Brushing is quite tiring, especially if you put all your weight into it)  But yeah, the last game, oh.. my.. god.. something was definietly wrong with our sheet, as the rocks would appear to be light, and then it would pick up speed for some reason and be way too heavy.  It was fucking ridiculous, we played through 5 ends, and I wasted possibly 8-10 shots out of 15.  It was horrible, I had to lead, as there was only 3, and I couldn't put up guards at all, I would throw it too light or either too heavy.    It wasn't bad though because the other team just sucked.  We had two rocks sitting on the outside ring, and the other team had the hammer, and I was talking to Dave how we should put our last rock near the center because, if they draw in the house then they get a point.  And he's like "C'mon" and just laughed, where I realised how crappy they were and laughed also.  We just put up a guard, and their last shot was completely off.  Imagine, 5 ends like that, we didn't even have to try, and we managed to crush them 6-1.  Man, that was sad.  The last end, I burned 2 rocks, and Dave burned one, because we were so tired I wasn't really paying attention and I hit the rocks a bunch of times sweeping.  Even then, the end ended up having no one scoring.  Hilarious.  Sad.  Oh man did they suck.  ___________  My check owned.  Looks beautiful from 10 feet away, not so great any closer. :) ___________  Kristopher is a cool guy, I don't know why anyone would think otherwise.  Even if it is a scam, people out there still need organs regardless.  So sign your organ donor cards folks.  The only questionable thing, is I think the kid was drilled to memorizing that little speech of his, as it sounded, well, not from him, but when I was talking to him he seemed very genuine and a nice kid.  That's about it.  Sometimes I really want to punch some people, namely Riaz.  He just left right after, and we had to go searching for him, what a fucking retard.  Yes, that's right Riaz, you're a fuck-up.

      So I get home, and find a bag of these  urlLink Teddy Graham  - Honey - Cookies sitting on my desk.  I eat one, and reminisce the good old days of primary school and the lovely juice and animal cracker break times.  That's what these things taste like, animal crackers.  They're really good, and the bag is resealable which is also very cool.  And on top of that, they're made in little cute teddy bear form.    Yar! I gotta make this fake novelty check for Kristopher's Wish, and we only raised like 500 dollars.  What a joke, what's the use of 500 dollars?  we didn't even break a 1000, that's so sad...  anyway, got stuff to do, later days.

      Been watching tv lately?  I seem to be constantly bombarded of one of two things recently, black people and Janet Jackson.   You might be asking... Wait a second... isn't Janet Jackson black?   She belongs to the  urlLink Jacksons , so that's very questionable.  But other than that, have you seen the new Milk/Got Milk commercial, where it's essentially a music video with farmers and incredibly hot chicks pulled from some recent 50 Cent video?  It's funny in a sense, but I'm thinking whoever let it through is trying a little to hard to appeal to the mainstream.  Besides, coloured-folk, are like 5 times more lactose-intolerant than white-folk.  Meh, whatever, it's a funny commercial I'd think... a tractor with hydraulics! hah that's rich.  Other than that, I haven't seen been doing much, other than sleeping, working, eating and doing homework here and there.    omfg what the hell..  In King of the Hill, right at this moment, some new character used "That's what she said.."    WHAT THE BLODDY HELL?!  Yeah about the Mercier thing... Riyaad wrote a letter and he's in talks with Mr. Garton about getting various things reviewed, I'm not quite sure of the specifics of the whole thing, because Riyaad is the front man.  So, I guess it's best to ask him for details.  Another thing about the ACE thing, apparently Drivakos said "sure" and that the school will pay the extra $10 per person.  I was like.. huh?  I though the school was short of funds, that's why we have such a bloody crappy school and lack of leet stuff.  Oh well whatever, back to programming...  I'll IOException you! (sorry, Java Joke -_-)

      Forced rhyme!  The  urlLink fall of pirates ?  The above link is only active for only like 30 days I think, News Articles = teh sux.  But anyway, if you're too lazy to read, the CRIA (Canadian equivalent of RIAA[the evil buggers who sue children]) is pursing about 29 individuals who have been sharing excessive amounts of content over P2P networks.  They're motioning to get warrants and sopoenas and the like to retrieve various user information and such so they can sue them.  Now, I am that afraid? not really, I haven't downloaded that much stuff over the past few months, but if the court order(s) go through, what's to stop it from happening again by other companies?   In any case, just curb your downloading folks, you don't want to be sued now do you?  But if you do, you can be in a Pepsi Commercial proclaiming that you're a badass by disobeying the law!  Woo!  But anyway, good news is in Canada there isn't the Digital Millenium act or something... so we're in the clear unless some judges pass various rulings to release the information.  Whatever.. do your own research :p  I need to study >,

       This response was too long and I couldn't partition it so it would make sense in several comments. so here we go:    How can I honestly live with "whatever floats your boat"?  I assume that's what you meant, JP.  I've thought about this, I think it was sometime in Grade 11 and it was sunny outside, and I sat in front my bedroom window and watched kids jumping through sprinklers, riding bikes and playing street hockey or some other team sport.  I think I was listening to the Goo Goo Dolls at the time and I was completely zoned out but I was conscious enough to just absorb the surroundings around me.  I began to think, recall and relive experiences that I enjoyed and it was a good hour or two before I got up and did something productive.    What I thought about was what gives me the right to judge.  I am not God, I am not omniscient and hence I do not know much, if anything.  Although I might do well in school (I have a nack for remembering information) it doesn't mean I actually 'know' anything.  I don't know what circumstances people have been through, and I do not know what have caused them to be the way that they are.  Thus, I do not have the right to judge anyone in anyway.  Although I might do so in day to day life, those judgements are absolutely unwarranted and invalid.  They just occur because I need to place everyone in my mind according to a specific category so everything is just candy. However, the categorizations and opinions are just mere assumptions.  There could be an idiot walking in the halls beating up other kids, but that same idiot can be being beat at home or what-have-you.  I don't know what goes on behind any other person's head but my own.  I don't know their motivation and thus, I can not judge them.  We all have our reasons, and that is why we are all responsible for ourselves.  Another angle is this:  What separates you from that idiot in the halls?  Maybe several thousand genes at best.  Now, what is it about him that antagonizes you?  His lack of intelligence?  His lack of common sense?  It doesn't really matter, but you do find yourself thinking that he's just a complete waste of air.  But let's sit back for a second and do the proverbial "if you were in his shoes".  That would suck wouldn't it?  All I'm saying is that you, me and everyone else should be a little grateful on how the dice rolled for us.  Hell, we all rolled high, and there are probably billions of people out there that weren't as fortunate.  Sure you could argue that in reality that you AREN'T him and that doens't give him the right to be an idiot.  Well, what gives you the right to be a pompous jackass? (myself included)  I think it was Neon Genesis Evangelion where there was a scene saying something like this:   Shinji:       It is Kaoru-kun that must have survived.                 He was much better than I am.                 He should have survived.   Misato:     No.                 A surviver must have the will to survive.                 He wished to die.                 He abandoned the will to live, And depended on the false hope.                 You are not wrong.   Shinji:       You are cold, Misato-san.  We'll all amount to something, and if we don't there's always death.

      You know, I'm still the same arrogant ass I was in grade 5.  I think it all started when people made fun of me for wearing glasses, or being smart... primary school was so fun wasn't it?    You always recall the fun moments, but when you really look back at it, there were just as many bad moments as well.  Heh, fucking kids and their expensive trikes and their mother fucking gameboys.  I sware to God, I hated being the misfit-smart-asian-kid, I was cast out of games, and cast out of friends, fucking kids are so harsh.  I remember walking home one day, and seeing these 2 girls make fun of this other girl out of no reason.  The victimized girl was clearly upset and took a verbal beating of her life, and then they quickly walked together again.  Althought it might seem innocent, I'm sure that girl is hurt quite a bit, as this accumulates for the next 5-6 years.  I dunno.. kids... they're cruel.  I think I've humbled myself quite a bit in the past couple years, trying to tear down this thick defensive shield a put up since I was like 8 after being called "four-eyed" or "brainer".  I've also been more quick-witted than my former self, quick with the come-backs and quick with the insults just so that everyone knows that I'll pwn their ass if they get too close to me.  It's all defensive really, it's just that, I don't like it when people make fun of me...  Yeah so when you see me make a come-back or whatever, it's merely just pent up hatred for all those kids who've made fun of me in the past... but in reality it's just habit now, I can't avoid it..  I know it's pretty hypocritical, but whatever, I hate it when I get insulted, because it usually from some unwarranted thing or whatever... but in any case, back to what's happening in my life...  I worked today, and lately, there has been a lot of things going on my mind.  I like to keep my personal life, personal, so hence, it'll be vague from this point out. I have a couple problems (i'm not dieing or anything) and well I needed some advice...  I can't ask my mom because she'd just lecture me on the evils of so and so, and my dad, well, he doesn't solve anything.  My brother, isn't wise enough, my friends would make fun of me and hence I turned to a co-worker.  And I picked someone I really thought was really smart and new a lot about life and its surpises.  I asked Vanessa for some help and some advice, and she gave me some really good advice.  I spent the next 10 minutes just absorbing what she had to say, as it all made a lot of sense, I wanted clarity in my problem and it was pretty much fixed at that point.  I like it when people can tell me things that are useful,  I like learning from people.  Not the school kind of learning where it's just information-remembering-regugitating.  But, developing as a person and just improving upon yourself.  And if Vanessa, ever reads this, (which will be never), I'd like to give her another round of thanks.  Because really, I was extremely confused and distraught about something, and she basically showed me the light.  After that, I went to Pizza Hut, picked up Luke, called up Aaron and was like, yo, what we doing to get to Ryan's B-Day party?  And when all was said and done, we concluded that Aaron was/still is chopping Michelle like no one's business.  Heh..  Ryan's party was fun, I suggested to gamble because, well you know.. i'm a gamblaholic. and yea I won 5 bucks -_-. I had 2 shots and some smirnoff ice, and Luke had like 4-5 shots and half a bottle of smirnoff and he was quite tipsy walking towards my car.  I should have rejected those 2 shots, but peer pressure owned my ass, and that wasn't too smart as my head kinda hurts right now.. I can't really handle alchohol, it's in the genes..  I felt really bad though because when Luke and I got there, Josh's sister was so mother fucking hammered, it was like she was going to pass out.  I felt really really really bad afterwards for not saying anything, but I hope she's alright now.  Oh man, some people were so wasted I was kinda scared, like Minh's brother, wasn't looking to hot and yea...  a lot of asians, I think I must have been introduced to like a dozen or so people and I don't remember anyone's name except for Sebastian who is also a 1337 gambler.  We split the pot after a while because we got bored playing against each other... so yeah..  Anyway, nothing knew, and if you dont' feel like reading, the jist of it is:  The past made me what I am today, I'm trying to fix myself, I got some good advice from a co-worker, I went to Ryan's party, took 2 shots, and Luke got kinda tipsy for taking 4-5.  All in All, a good night.  Aaron didn't drink btw, good for him I say, good for him.

       It was too long to fit and I hate parsing things, so here:   Here's what's wrong with you:  - You're arrogant. - You can't agree with anyone. - You seem to think the world is against you. (Which it isn't by the way) - You keep pining away at the fact that no one likes you, but in fact there ARE some people.  Me? Andrew? Adeel? Azim? Greg? Jessica? I just rarely see you these days, we should go do something.  All the Greenbriar kids are misfits, there's a reason for that, but I haven't found it yet. - You give up easily, ie NOW. - Although you're pleasant most of the time, we all know what goes on behind the facade.  It's in your tone of voice. Like honestly, we all know you hate certain people, if you actually do hate them, don't try to make friends with them, it's just patronizing and retarded.  There's many more, like you're judgemental, inconsiderate to some select people, and just a plain ass to others.  You feel like it's your duty to be this undefeatable body of knowledge.  Let me tell you something my mother tells me time and time again.  "There are millions of people smarter than you, you just haven't met them yet."  And tell you what, she's probably right.  So stop being an ass and let go of your pride.  We all have our flaws though, so please don't take this list too seriously.  We all want to be something, we try, we fail and we try again, there's no reason to give up, only reason to get up.  It's the search that's worthwhile, not when you're in it, because when you are in it, you want to move on to something else, and that's the truth.  _______________  I still don't know why we're all misfits though, there has to be a reason.  Not just because we're from Greenbriar either... there has TO BE! A pattern in all things...  ______  Did you know that UCC (Upper Canada College, which is actually a private high school) costs 35k a year to enroll? That's fucking more than University. I had a long chat with the owner of the Mandarin today, it was exciting because he makes half a million dollars a year.  Oh man, people with money are crazy.  Private schools are teh expensive.  Yeah that's all I got -_-

      Last night, 2 AM, Tired = bad time to post.  Anyway, yeah, I was extremely tired, and my brain wasn't really functioning correctly, and right now it isn't either, but here's the dealy-o.  It is formal related. and I am going.  It seemed like a big deal in my mind last night, but right now it really isn't, but here we go:  I'm going to the afterparty where all the IB kids are going... in Collingwood or whatever, yeah, sorry for the let down if any of you expected me to go somewhere else.  Now, before you get all crazy with me and ask what teh fuck is your motavation for doing so?    The answer is: Hannah.  You can read into it as much as you want, but there isn't really anything there.  Anyway, I'm not doing homework tonight in order to catch up on sleep.  Later days!

      That Ryan, always causing a ruckus.  And holy shit, I miss one episode and their's almost statutory rape.   That's ridiculous, every scene with those two together makes me shiver and cringe.  So DIRTY!  Anyway, yeah I didn't work today.  I forgot my uniform at home so I didn't work.    It's kinda fun though, because lemme tell you this:  Around 4:00 after the SAC meeting, Black Ruth, was like "Danny, you should just call in sick.  You work way too much."  and I'm like "I never call in sick, I'm just not that kind of guy.  It's karma you know, if you call in sick, you're gonna die of cancer, and probably the worst kind too, brain cancer, or even worst, testicular cancer."  and she's like "Yeah, but you work so much, you're gonna burn out."  and I go "You can't mess with karma man, you just can't!"  So went I got to work, I explained how I forgot my stuff, and he's like "Just take the day off"  and I'm like "sweeet! karma rocks!"  Booya to KARMA!

       ...what about me...   Friday to say the least, was quite the day.  I'll just go over the important parts, as everything else is not really important.  I'm becoming a very crazy lunch time gambler lately, as I've been gambling everyday for the past week at lunch.  Ever since Tai has busted out those chips and cards, oh man, I've been hooked like crazy.  Although we only play for 5$ to buy in, which isn't very much, it's still fun to risk it.  The more important part being that I've been winning :)  So on Friday, oh man, it was hilarious, I lost $5 in the first 10 minutes, because we were continuing the game from the previous day, and I was already down $4 so I just put the rest of the cash into one game which I lost.  No big deal, really, so in the second game, it was between Tai, Jason, Manh, Wade and I.  The game started off pretty steadily and Manh and Wade bowed out really early in one hand where they both risked way too high for what they had.  They both had 2 pairs, and the table clearly allowed for a straight which Tai had, and I still don't know why they  both  went all in that game.  They we're in an "alliance" so, that just baffles me.   Basically, within 10 minutes Manh and Wade were eliminated and Tai and Jason both were up quite a bit.  In two games, after, the game totally switched as I beat Tai in two "All-In" Occasions.  Putting me up to $20.25 at the end of the period.  It was fucking great.   The first game, I had a 2-D and a 4-H, and I was Big, so I was forced to play the hand anyway.  The flop came up as something like "5-H, 3-S, K-C" , i was like hot fucking damn, I almost have a straight, and Tai was holding a king, while Jason folded early.  The turn came up as an Ace, and i was like fuck ya, and I went all in.  Tai called me thinking I was bluffing and  bam!,  I took his money like no one's business.  The consequent game was even better.  I had a 9, 10 in my hand and the flop came up as "K, J, 10", the Turn - "9" and the River was some other important card, but anyway, I went all in, and Tai called me again, and again,  BAM! , I took his money.  Man, it was great.  Okay, enough with that, afterschool I chose to drive Greg home, I dunno why, I just felt compelled to do so.  So I did :/  You might be saying, well, he lives like really close to you, so what's the problem?  The problem was that I had to drive back to school to pick up Hannah to go out for dinner with Jenna and Josh.  LOL !  Oh yeah, that was a real waste of gas...  The four of us went to Bamboo Garden, and we ordered a variety of things, it was funny because everything that Hannah wanted to eat had meat in it, hah :p   I don't think there are Asian Vegetarians, it just doesn't make sense, not eating meat? who does that? :p.  So, I got the Thai Peanut Chicken, and I forgot to order how spicey I wanted it and so I got the really really really really really weak sauce.  I was like "Shit, how am I suppose to train for the Death Value Buffalo Wings?!"  We had a pretty good meal but I had to eat a portion of Hannah's and Josh a potion of Jenna's, and surpisingly Veronica almost finished her food.  I was quite surprised... like very... she nearly ate the whole damn thing.  So during that, everyone else was planning to go to Crystal's church for this Youth Event/Free the Natives thing and I opted to joined them instead of heading over to Leslie's early.  I don't know what's worse, people telling you that you're the next generation of leaders, over and over again, or watching Double Dragon (the movie).    Eh, the first 30 minutes of the Youth Event honestly felt like a mother fucking AA meeting.  We sat in this circle, doing this lame ass go-around-talk-about-yourself-and-your-interest bit.  I so felt like bursting out "Hi, my name is Danny, and I'm a gamblaholic."  Jesus Christ, was that painful.  It was so bad because me and Hannah just kept looking at each other with the " WHAT THE FUCK" look.  Imagine that for 2 and a bit hours, throw in some comments by prepubescent girls who's codename, yes she said "codename" as "Barbie".  SHE CALLED HERSELF BARBIE!  and some African minister who was well, I don't know... wasn't very motivating, but did get across his message.  Don't get me wrong, some points of the whole thing were interesting, but a majority, oh my lord, someone gouge my eyes out please!  It was a a decent thing, something I never done before, and looking back at it, it wasn't  that  bad.  I mean, sure they were preaching God, and resting everything on God, and that Christians were like the only 'good' people left on Earth, but if you replace those words with humanity and people, then it makes much more sense to people like me.  So yeah, not too shabby, and Josh can play the piano really well too, and afterwords we played some obviously prevalent Church version of Hide 'n go Seek, called Sardines or something.  It was fun, and I like bumped into a few pews and what not, heh, walking around in the dark = dangerous.  Afterwords, I drove Josh and Jenna to Josh's house, so you know... they can do the freaky freaky... lol j/k... But yeah, after that, I went to Leslie's and everybody was already like half asleep, it was honestly like a quarter to 10, and they were all alseep.  RIDICULOUS! I had some pizza and truffles and watched Double Dragon.  Boy did that movie suck.  Other than that, that was the end of my night as I returned home to the comfort of my bed.  That's it for Friday, sorry I haven't been posting much.. too much work... so gaysors.

      Brandy is horrible.  We lost semi-finals for curling, we were up 5-4 going into the last end, but the other team had the hammer, so we got fucked.  It was really close, man, what the shit.  That's all I got, too tired to think.

      You know, all my life I've been striving to  not  be my dad and when I ever stop and think, it always ends up that me and my Dad are almost the same person.  I know my dad has a really soft side, although he never shows it, I know it's there, it's apparent whenever I fuck up hard, or my brother does something extremely stupid.  Me, it's about the same thing, I'm a real softie when it comes to things, but I rarely show it (at least I don't think I don't.. correct me if I'm wrong).  My dad is a stubborn fool, as am I, he gambles like crazy, as do I, and you know what, he has a bottle of brandy sitting in the kitchen and I think he got it sometime during Christmas and now it's nearly empty.  Although I haven't drunk any of it, I've though about it though.  I just stare at it, and wonder, hmm "I wonder what it tastes like."  I dunno, I'm turning out to be the person I never wanted to be.    I use to look at my dad as a failure, because he's a labourer, a proletariat if you will, and I didn't want to be that, and all this time, I've been lieing to myself, all this time I've been trying to live a life that I don't belong to.  All this time, I've been trying to get away from myself.  I admit, I enjoy simple things, maybe it's the fact I've lost all interest in studies lately, but generally, I don't think I would be that happy being a white-collar worker.  I dunno, maybe I'm just crazy, but I have serious doubts these days, I have serious doubts about university, and I have serious doubts about what I want to do with my life.  Everyone says they want to be something, but what if I just want to be?    I've been looking at my marks lately, and have been crunching the numbers like there's no tomorrow, and I have serious doubts of getting into Waterloo or Toronto, and in reality I don't really want to go to Queen's or McMaster, I just applied there for who knows why (probably to save myself face, if I fuck up hard.)   I dunno, things are different now, maybe I might become a teacher if nothing works out, or maybe I'll take a year off and go to RCC and take that route if nothing works out.  I'm just not sure anymore, I mean, what is there to be sure of these days?  I remember when I was in like Grade 9, school was life and that was all there was to it, and I grew up kinda quickly I guess, I sat around doing school work and I guess I enjoyed it, and these days, there's none of that, no enjoyment at all.  It's merely tedious drivel trying to move onto the next step, which consists of another 4 years of the same thing.  Man, I dunno, fuck I wish I ray of clarity would just shine down on me right now so I know what to do with my life.  As crazy as it sounds, I'm quite content with earning enough money to do whatever, not too much of course, just enough to survive and have a few luxuries.  And by luxuries I'm just talking about shelter, car, food, and high-speed internet access :)  So yeah, I dunno, I'm confused, I'm tired, I'm just not sure of anything anymore.  There's no certainty in my life anymore, and that scares me, I'm scared of the fact that maybe tomorrow, I won't be me anymore, or that I won't be something that I wanted to be.  I just want some clarity, that's all.

      BEST LINE EVER.  In fact, I have to say it's possibly the best scene ever, hilarious, from character's you'd never expect it from, and who would have thought computer lingo could be used as sexual innuendo?  HILARIOUS  Oh man, this episode it's up there, really, it is.  UP UP UP!  I'm talking about the OC of course :p

      To be truthfully honest, I really didn't expect everything to happen the way it happened.  Did I fuck up?  Yeah, pretty much, I said some stuff I shouldn't have said, and it ended up getting passed around like a prison whore during shower time.  The sad part is that most people, only have a part of the story and hence don't know what the heck really went on, and that in itself is pissing the living shit out of me.  Not only that, but, before today, I wasn't quite sure what the fuck could have transpired to make everything happen the way it did, and for that, I don't know what the heck is going on.  I've spent the last 6 hours at work, working and thinking about this, and this is all I can think of, and this is all that I know:   What Happened:   Some time ago, maybe 3-4 weeks ago, maybe even more, Gabe asked Jen Lee to go to formal via MSN.  I believe the conversation was like:  Jen: So are you going to formal with anyone? Gabe: No, you? Jen: No.  Both: hmmmm  But that's just what I've been hearing, I'm sure there's many versions out there, and I'm sure one person seemed more desperate than the other in them, but for the sake of just re-telling the story, this is how I saw it/heard it.  [Broken Telephone #1]   Now some point later, let's say 2 weeks ago, Gabe told his parents how he was going to formal with Jen Lee as friends, and his parents (from what I hear) said he can't go with someone if they're just friends.  So, hence, Gabe could no longer go to formal.  Some point later, via MSN,  Gabe tells Jen he can't go.  Obviously, at this point, both parties are quite upset.  Quickly there after, Maria decides to un-invite Gabe from the Collingwood After Party as he no longer has any link to the party.   I'm sure there were rumours or whatever passed back and forth and a great deal of animosity.  Some time last week, I think it was either Wednesday or Tuesday, heck it was during fourth lunch and here I was sitting with I believe Roanna, Steve, Steve Postma, and Gabe.  (that's what I think anyway)  He goes on about a 20 minute tirade about how stupid the IB kids and how he greatly dislikes them.  Gabe says a whole bunch of stuff, and the main things that stuck in my mind were:   1) I didn't want to go with Jen anyway... 2) I think I should just lace the place with like drugs and alcohol and call the cops - Oh wait, that would take too much effort and money, forget that. 3) I think I should just go to formal with someone else to spite them  Now, although I doubt these are the exact words that Gabe said himself, these are extremely close to what he said.  Now, the question is, was he joking around or was he being serious?  I for one thought he was being serious, I don't think #2 was serious, but 1 and 3 were definitely on my mind.  And besides, why would anyone say such things anyway?  Well, I was sitting there, and althought I wouldn't consider myself as an IB kid, I was going to that party and I do associate myself with several of them so I guess I was quite taken by his hate.  So Friday rolled around, I was invited to go to Williams Coffee Pub or whatever, and people started talking and the conversation moved onto formal sometime in the night.  Jen was of course livid about what happened before, and asked me of my opinion.  Stupidly, I said something like "Gabe's parents won't let him go, but he wouldn't have  really  wanted to go with you anyway".  And then I explained the conversation with Gabe the days prior or whatever, and I think I said something like "He just wanted to go to the afterparty, that's all".  Now, why would I say these things?  I already assumed Gabe and Jen were already on non-speaking terms, and I already assumed that they weren't going to make-up any time soon.  So, I figured why not just let the cat-out-of-the-bag so that everyone could breathe a little easier.  Stupid me.  [Broken Telephone #2]    So the night continued and we moved onto other things.  The weekend happened, and I think I guess whatever I said got passed around to all of Jen's close friends.  [Broken Telephone #3]     I guess Monday happened, and then Writer's Craft happened, and then Jen Moore publically called Gabe a liar infront of the whole class (from what I hear, again).  At this point, Gabe calls me a liar (from what I hear), and subsequently everyone thinks I'm a liar.  Although no one has come up to me and called me a liar yet, I don't know what's fictional and truth.  So, I won't go to far into this part of the story.  So over the past while, Gabe and I have been arguing about cars and then I just asked Gabe what the fuck is going on, and he then said something about how I'm talking behind his back.  Now, this is like 5 days after the fact, and I'm completely oblivious to what happened between that Friday and Tuesday.  So, I'm lost and he goes to explain what happened.  So in the heat of the confusion, we argue some more for about an hour or so, and I don't think much was resolved at all.  I do know is that I indeed talked behind his back if I'm being accused as such and so I guess I made the mistake.    Now, today, everything seems to be coming to a breaking point as no one seems to have the story straight, and everyone's just mad at everyone else.  So, I was pretty mother fucking pissed off today and still fuming as of this moment.  I'm confused and dazed, and I have never lied or fabricated anything in regards to Gabe.  I've only just been telling people what I've been told and hence continuing the chain of Broken Telephone.    I know I fucked up, and I admit it, I know I said stuff which I should have let Gabe say himself, but it didn't happen that way, Gabe told me stuff, and I just retold it to others, whether it was all sarcastic remarks are not, he still said them, and I fowarded them.  I'm not saying I'm excusable for what I did, all I'm saying is, I just passed on a message that wasn't meant to be passed.  Anyway, that's the story from what I see, I'm sure everyone else has a different story and has things to add/change/whatever.  I'm really tired of this shit, as it's really frivilous and is making everyone ancy and pissed off, so this is it, this is all I know and nothing more.  All I want is to everything to be candy again.  (Like that's going to happen.)   _____   That Bertuzzi hit was crazy, my guess he will be suspended for only the rest of the season + playoffs.  He should get more, but I really doubt that's going to happen.  Heatley killed someone and he got fined :p.

      [Mood] - Fluoride Fresh [Music] - Sloan : The Other Man  Made a couple of changes, added a few more blogs, removed some as well.  They are sorted in an order, it's the order I read the blogs, I use my site to navigate thru other blogs rather than favouriting them.  Another thing is, I do have a counter, but for some reason it won't show up properly. It's near the bottom, it's like a hidden link, which I think is pretty cool in its on right.    Uhm yeah, I dunno I added Roanna's and Chrisia's Ljs, because I've been reading them lately while Riyaad's is dead for some reason and Sunny's is never updated, so I axed those. A little voyeurism never hurt anyone.  Hrmph that's all I got I think, and oh, I forgot about to tell you guys the cool things I bought lately.  I bought a pair of boxer shorts, and they have playing cards on them, they're pretty ownage.  I also got 6 packs of playing cards today (they were on sale) and poker chips so I'll have my own if Tai never shows up or anything.  They're plastic chips tho... I plan to get clay chips whenever I get my ass to Square One, as I'm sure Dufferin Games has them.  Yeah I realise, I really really need mother fucking conversation.  I'm so bored during lunches, and the fact that I work everyday is turning my brain to mush.  I'm craving social activities or at least talking to mother fucking people.  Because honestly, I can't take my lunch anymore, gambling is fun and all, but shit, I'm bored as fuck as there's no one to talk to, nothing interesting anyway.  I can only feign so much interest into baseball and other crappy ass sports not to mention talking about cars and who's going with who to formal.  Man, like honestly, I don't really care if you have issues with asking out so and so, because nigger please, just do it and stop complaining.  BLAH, I sware to God I'm going to shoot myself before the end of the year, because honestly, I'm getting dumber and dumber as I hang out with these nimrods.  No offense to these folks, they're good people, but I've never been punched and noogied in my whole life as a way of bonding prior to sitting with these guys.  Oh and the mother fucking megaphone, like fuck, if that thing goes off in my ear again, I'm going to take a chair, and beat the shit out of the person who incessantly presses that mother fucking siren button.  And shit, playing video games is fun during my spare, but it's just boring too now, I think I'm just going to do work from here on out, because I'm really tired of playing video games.  (Never thought I would say that..)  As you can see, I seem to swearing quite a bit, I'm just too lazy to put adjectives infront of words these days, so fuck seems quite apt in all cases.  Other than that, today has been a good today, aside from being mother fucking boring.  But, in all clouds there is a sliver lining, take for example, math class, it was actually fun for once.  I had mother fucking fun learning the Extended Euclidean Theorem,  You know why?  I don't know, there was a lot of joking around during the lesson and Mr. Young was part of it, it was really entertaining and I actually understood the whole thing thoroughly.  Oh and I visited the Dentist today which was fun.  I enjoy going to the dentist unlike the millions and millions of children out there, I have fun there.  I walk in, say hi, and have like a 15 minute conversation with the dentist lady and other people.  It's just fun.  Talking to anyone is fun, as long as they're able to respond.  Blah, fuck, I need a life.  Man, I really need to talk, sad part is, if I had someone here to talk to right now, I'd probably have nothing to say, like seriously, I really need to hang out, I haven't done that in like a year... wait I did that on the weekend.. ah blah, I lie... But yeah, looking foward to the next one of those.

      I can't believe I said that today, "What the bone-snap!?" I exclaimed in math class... It's like back in Grade 4 when I invented a whole shit load of sayings, such as: "You stooge!", "You dicksmack!" or the famous Rob-JP "Scunt!"  Heh, making up words is cool.  Oh and for jeebus sake, why did my Dad get me a humongloid backpack?  I mean c'mon, I asked my Dad to replace my old backpack with one of similar size, and he goes out and buys me a mother fucking hiking bag that's like bigger than me.  Holy shazbot, it's like I'm wearing a mobile locker on me.  It's ridiculous.  Whatever, I refused to return it as it would be too much hassle, so I guess I have to live with it for the next couple of months.  I should have just went out and got a Jansport bag by myself.  Cursid parents. :/  What else... hmm, not much that I can think of, only that the Sr. Girls V-Ball team were at the Mandarin and I was working.  Nothing too exciting happened, I was hoping for some food poisoning or something, but zilch.  What a bore.  Anyway, gotta get back to studying, later days.

      Watched another foreign film, what the fuck is me and foreign films?  *shurg  Anyway,  urlLink City Of God  is in Portuguese and it's basically a story about two boys, one grows up to be a hoodlum gangster and another a photographer.  Sounds retarded right?  But in fact, I was even surpirsed at how good the movie was.  It told stories of individuals and linked them all back together, somewhat like  urlLink Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels  and had a feel of  urlLink Fight Club .  It also had a pretty snazzy latino soundtrack which fitted the movie really well.  I dunno, it's a good movie, a bunch of stories, plenty of violence and it's based on a true story.  How the City of God (the slums of Rio De Janeiro) ended up being divided into a large gang war between 2 gangs.  Crazy and exciting, I'd recommend to anyone.  Of course, those of you who hate subtitles can eat a sock.

      On Friday I went to William's Coffee Pub with some IB kids, was entertaining, lots of interesting conversations and I got a slice of Brown Cow cake and a glass of milk.  Today, I went to work, and then to Ruth's where upon I said hi to people and wished Leslie a happy birthday.  After that I had a long conversation with Ruth and Andrew, and after that a long conversation with Ruth.  It's all about the conversations.  Oh, and I hate my house.

      Well, March Break is a good time to defrag, because honestly, my life has been pasted together with popsicle sticks and white  urlLink Elmer's Glue .  To put it more bluntly, I just reorganized my computer and my desk.  I haven't even started doing any of my homework yet, but I don't really care, as I haven't done any real work since.. I dunno, a while back...  And in agreeance with  urlLink Andrea , the March Break has been quite short and it does feels like I haven't done anything productive (which I haven't :p)     On the bright side though, my desk is extremely clean now, the 50 or so unlabeled CDs scattered all around my U-shaped desk has been thoroughly checked, labeled and placed in some sort of organized scheme.  I also washed out all the coke and food stains off my keyboard and mouse, although my mouse seems to have an imprint of my hand on the side. (Show's you how much time I've spent at my desk)   Other than that, my break has been a total waste, I worked for a good 4/7ths of it and the days I didn't work I was recovering from some sort of ridiculous activity I was doing the night before.  Like this entire week I think I went to bed past 4 AM three or four times.  Right now, I'm eating the best seedless grapes ever.  They're each like 3/4th an inch. They're huge! and on top of that they're green!  Best damn grapes ever.  Tomorrow I'll do a synopsis of everything I did during March Break, so I can say "refer to my blog" when on Monday you all ask me how my break went.  :p

      You heard me right folks, a bloody lan party at good ol' Riyaad's!  Although there were only 4 computers (mine, JP's laptop, and 2 of of Riyaad's) we still had a blast.  Initially there were 5 of us, Azim, JP, Riyaad, Josh and I and we basically just played a couple of rounds of Counter-Strike for the first bit.  Not to be boastful, but I just owned that, with Riyaad pwning me a couple times.  Other than that we tried to play other games like GTA (it doens't run well in XP btw... so that failed miserably) and on top of that we had a bunch of network issues for the first hour.  JP solved a majority of them, and after that we were good to go for the rest of the night.  We played some Civilization III, but after about an hour and a half, we got bored and just scrapped the game.  Then we moved onto Risk: The game of Global Domination (the board game).  Azim bought it today during the whole thing as I went to pick up Luke from his house and back, so then we had 5 people once again (Josh left early).  We played Risk, and after about two hours, I managed to conquer the world by finally crushing Azim's armies.  It was a good game, although Luke got eliminated really early which was sucks for him >,  Uh, what else, we tried to play some ridiculous game of "balancing on an obscenely large ball".  Riyaad had this weight training/pilates ball or whatever and we just tried to balance on it.  I sucked hard at it, and it was honestly the most dangerous thing ever, as if you weren't sitting on it correctly, you would fall backwards and smack your head onto the floor.  It was fun though :p  Yeah that was about it, so yeah LANage ensued, RISK ensued, Ball-balancing ensued as well as some pizza eating and copious amounts of soft drink consumption and let's not forget JP's and Riyaad's sister's brownies.  MmmM chocolate.  So yeah, a good day I'd say.   _____    wooo !        Spliced to fit better :/

      I went to work today, (today being Monday) and well, a lot of weird stuff happened.  The day started nonchalantly as it appeared to be just like any other day at work.  I got up, read some emails, checked my blog and was on my way.  I got to work a tad late, but it doesn't matter, because no one really cares as everyone is busy doing their own thing.  I ended up getting to clean the cannery upstairs, which is the easiest job in the world as all you do is spray some bleach on the floor and spray the place silly with hot water.  I spent a good 3 hours doing that, it was fun too, who doesn't like using a hose and soap?  So yeah, that was kinda odd, as I haven't done that since summer of last year... and then later on, I found a "Roll up the Rim To Win" piece lieing on the floor.  No one was around so I picked it up and it read something like "Win! /un caffe/coffee".  I was surpised at the fact that someone could drop free coffee but whatever, I stashed it away in my pocket and went about my business like nothing happened.  It was incredibly busy for a Monday, and I ended up seeing David Yi, and Vishal whateverhislastnameis... on top of that I saw some the worst parenting in my life in that 3 hour span of lunch.  As it being March Break, we were flooded with families and their kids... most of whom where all whiney son's of bitches who would pout, scream and cry when they didn't get what they wanted.  Of course, the crappy parents caved in every single time.  Man, geez, way to spoil your kids?  Of course, that isn't the film noire part.. but this is:  So, with my free coffee I drove my sorry little ass to the Timmies like 300m away from the Mandarin. (shoot me) As I was going to park, some wanker started backing out infront of me so that forced me to park in the other direction as I wanted to do it in a fluid motion... so that meant I parked facing away from Timmies.  I galloped my way into the place and was happy to give the clerk my free coffee stub and got myself a nice double double.  I walked back to my car and sat down and sipped at the steaming cup of caffeine.  I was listening to my my Sloan/Weezer mix and of course singing along quite loudly until I noticed that about 200 metres away from me there was a car parked in the middle of the parking lot.   Not weird right... I guess not... UNTIL!   Until, I noticed that there was someone in the car (a silver Echo)... *gasp*.  It was weird, I was wondering, why the hell would a car be parked as far away from Tim Horton's as possible, facing  AWAY  from it.  So, that wasn't too bothersome, I guessed the person inside is just some person spending their break snoozing outside in their car or talking on their cell phone or doing whatever.  Of course that all changed when a Yellow Protege S type pulled up right beside the car.  Suddenly, the person in the Echo, a fairly attractive women (from what I could see, I was really far away, so I really can't be sure), gets out of her car and gets into the Protege. Before she gets in, she makes a quick 360 to make sure no one is looking (she obviously didn't see me) and proceeds inside the car.  The car is idling by the way, and about 30 minutes pass (I'm still drinking my coffee, it's hot :p)  and I notice that they are kissing and possibly even more stuff.  I really couldn't see much, but I concluded that that skank is having an affair with the guy in the Protege over her wimp ass husband.  I left about after 40 minutes from when she first got in, as I had to return back to work.  Voyeurism at it's finest.  I really should have had some binoculars or a camera.  Blackmail fo' sho'  Side note:  The license plate of the Echo was "X Diva X" - Yeah, show's what kind of skank she is.  A skanky one!  Or she has tricks in the afternoon - WHO DOES THAT?  Other than that, the day was pretty plain but Shenay at work is really cool, honestly, she's one of the most interesting people I've met to date.  HILARIOUS!  That's all I got.  Later Days

      Let's see how much sleep I got this week:   Sunday:  Went to bed at 2 AM.  Monday:  Woke up at 6 AM, went to bed at 2AM.  Tuesday:  Woke up at 7 AM, went to bed at 3AM.  Wednesday:  Woke up at 7 AM, went to bed at Midnight.  Thursday:  Woke up at 7AM, went to bed at 3 AM.  Friday:  Woke up at 7AM, went to bed at 5 AM.   Saturday:  Woke up at 1 PM,  the time is now 2:56 AM as i'm typing this so... that's err.. I dunno  So during that week of school, I had a total of 24 hours of sleep, not to mention I spent my Friday night playing cards and jitz at Shooters. That's like 4.8 hours/day average. How am I still alive?  Uh what else is new?  I might be doing a different job at the Mandarin in the coming weeks, I might get moved to the grill, which would be a welcomed change, not to mention the nice raise in tip-sharing.  So let's keep our fingers crossed for Danny this time around, and hope nothing messes this up.  The really weird part is that right after I was told I couldn't be a waiter, I thought in my head that I could become a grill attendent and thereby bypass the legal drink serving age law, and still yet make more money than as I would as a bus boy.  Although the thought was in my mind for about 2 months, I never brought it up or talked about it with anyone.  However, today, my manager asked me if I wanted to do it, so it's kinda weird.  It's like after a while, he finally caught onto my thoughts or something.  I dunno, kinda reminds me of that scene from Waking Life, where the guy says something like   "Once it's thought of, it's like, the idea is out there, and anyone can just grab it."  That's probably not the actual line, but it's something like that.  It's the scene with that semi-famous actor, with some girl in the bedroom.  I can't remember the actor's name, but he's pretty famous compared to all the others.  Oh I remember now.. it's Ethan Hawke I think.  So yeah, anyway, weirdness.  Cool things on the internet:  Study on the  urlLink Six Degrees of Seperation :   "We report on a global social-search experiment in which more than 60,000 e-mail users attempted to reach one of 18 target persons in 13 countries by forwarding messages to acquaintances. We find that successful social search is conducted primarily through intermediate to weak strength ties, does not require highly connected "hubs" to succeed, and, in contrast to unsuccessful social search, disproportionately relies on professional relationships. By accounting for the attrition of message chains, we estimate that social searches can reach their targets in a median of  five to seven steps , depending on the separation of source and target, although small variations in chain lengths and participation rates generate large differences in target reachability. We conclude that although global social networks are, in principle, searchable, actual success depends sensitively on individual incentives."    urlLink Top Ten Words:  " 1. Embedded   News correspondents embedded in military units suggested to many that news correspondents were in bed with the military  "   urlLink The origin of the mullet ?  This is hilarious, watch the whole thing.  It is.  I screamed "You got served" after like every scene :)

       1st off:  I forgot to mention in the OC. Keria Knightley is mentioned.  I was like... "that list sounds really really familiar....oh.. it's mine. !!!!"   2ndly:  Oi vhey, I blew 20 dollars today, which isn't much of a loss, but I was soo close.  Yeah, can't learn if you don't play, it was honestly, the most exciting poker I've ever played.   3rdly:  As most of you know, I hype up a lot of things, and make everything sound really exciting.  Well today, was pretty exciting for me, at least, in the morning it was anyway.  Like always, I procrastinated for a while, and didn't really have a gift idea for Hannah, so I was really screwed coming into this week (Monday).  Especially, once I found out how damn cool Andrea's present was, I just had to think of something outlandish. I then got some help from Jenna (thank the lord), and a plan was set in motion from that day on.  It started off, with Jenna telling me that Hannah would like some fresh flowers, and I'm like.. that's not too difficult, yet, not really cool enough.  So, I brood this plan where I'd surpise her in the morning, flowers and gifts in-hand.  There were a whole bunch of issues to be taken care of, like:  1 - How would I get her to stay at her house, and not leave early for school? 2 - How would I get into the apartment in the first place? (the doors are locked) 3 - and there were probably some other issues, but not that it's over, I can't think of them :p  so yeah.. there were some problems prior hand.  So, Jenna and I devised an ingenious plan.  In hindsight, this plan really really pwned.  What happend was, we arranged it so that "Jenna" would come early on Wednesday to pick up Hannah at her house and give her a surpise.  This solved  problem 1  as this ensured that Hannah would be at her house in the morning.  Then, I had this crazy gift idea, to give it a little more suspense, that I'd leave a note at her door, saying something like "There's a surpise in the lobby waiting for you!", which was attached to a single daisy (she likes daisies from what Jenna told me).  At the same time, I'd be waiting in the lobby with a bouquet of flowers.  Great plan right? Not be conceded... but it was a kickass plan, one that will be remembered for many a days to come.  So that was the plan.  What happened in reality was:  When I bought the flowers, the person there was really nice, and I had no clue what I was doing, so she helped out a lot, and that was pretty cool.  I also got her the Finding Nemo DVD (which btw, I haven't seen the movie).  So that was just Tuesday [again, I procrasitnate, sue me :p].  I had to then reaffirm that everything was still in plan with Jenna, so she could tell Hannah not to come to school with her dad. I then made the card, cut a flower off, and made it all nice looking, I did however encounter some problems with tape, but whatever, I had to replace some tape as it tore off the bouquet, but no bid deal.  In the morning, I woke up excruitiatingly early, and my head was really hurting, as I'm still sick.  But no matter, I got all preped up and I decided to actually look somewhat presentable today as I gelled my hair and picked out some nice clothes (imagine that, nice clothes?!).  I left earlier then planned, because, Queen Street has construction and it's rush hour, so to be safe, I left like 15 minutes a head of schedule (7:10).   I got to her apartment, after missing the turn intially, and had to talk to the security guard.  I managed to coax her into letting me inside the compound, and to open the front doors of the apartment (took me like 10 minutes of being nice).   So, I was inside the place, still a head of time, and decided that I would drop off the flower at her door.  When I got back down to the lobby, it was like 7:25 or something and I called Jenna up to ask her to play her part.  The problem that we expected was that: Would she notice a flower on the floor as she walked out?   So, to solve it, we planned that I would call Jenna up, and that Jenna would call Hannah up, and tell her to checkout her doorstep.  So that happened, and I was sitll waiting in the lobby.  At this point, I'm nervous like hell (why? I don't even know), and there's 3 elevators, and I'm reading that floor dial like there's no tomorrow.  Hannah lives on the 10th floor, and so everytime one of those things read 10, my heart would jump a beat, and then relax once it was going in the wrong direction or didn't stop on the 10th floor.  After about 5 minutes of waiting, one of the elevators finally stopped on the 10th floor, and now, I was really really nervous.  The doors opened, and everything was good from that point on.  That's the plan folks, I gave her the gifts/flowers and drove her to school.    Mad props to Jenna for the helpage.  Tomorrow: back to tired and grumpy Danny.  I was only nice and cleaned-up for a day.  *laugh* !

      I had period 1 and 2 cancelled today.  That leaves ONLY period 3.  hmm.  go to school...?  Nah...  sad part is, I'm going to be leaving to get to school in about 20 or so minutes so I can hand some stuff in and do some Pacific Rim stuff.  Hilarious.    Oh, and I watched Kill Bill vol 1. just now.  I really liked it, although I've heard not so good reviews from other people.  Who doesn't like groteseque violence... but on a side note the whole movie felt like an anime.  Maybe that was what Tarrintino was going for?  I dunno.  It's a unique piece of film... now off to school and Lost In Translation tonight... gotta love bandwith.

      If I'd have to classify myself has anything, I'd think I'm 40% geek, 30% emo and 30% insane, but that's just me. (I've taken a liking to emo/punk/new-age music recently for some reason or another... I sometimes wonder how white I can possibly get...)  My current favourite song is: Dashboard Confessional - Saints and Sailors (it seems somewhat beffiting of me, the lyrics that is)    This is where I say I've had enough And no one should ever feel the way that I feel now. A walking open wound,  a trophy display of bruises And I don't believe that I'm getting any better. Any better. Waiting here with hopes the phone will ring And I'm thinking awful things I'm pretty sure that few would notice. And this apartment  is starving for an argument. Anything at all to break the silence. Wandering this house  like I've never wanted out And this is about as social as I get now. And I'm throwing away the letters that I am writing you Cause they would never do,  I would never do. Never Waiting here with hopes the phone will ring And I'm thinking awful things I'm pretty sure that few would notice. And this apartment is starving for an argument. Anything at all to break the silence. So don't be a liar Don't say that everything's working  when everything's broken. And you smile like a saint  but you curse like a sailor And your eyes say the jokes on me. But, I'm not laughing You're not leaving Who do I think I am kidding? When I'm the only one locked in this hell Waiting here with hopes the phone will ring And I'm thinking awful things I'm pretty sure that few would notice. And this apartment is starving for an argument. Anything at all to break the silence. So don't be a liar Don't say that everything's working  when everything's broken. And you smile like a saint but you curse like a sailor And your eyes say the jokes on me    I ended work today at like 11:45 PM.  My god, latest mother fucking weekday worknight ever.  Working on the grill is nice, I like the change, but I don't like the late nights.  Man fux -_-.  Not to mention I've been breathing in "Spic - Span: Heavy Duty Degreaser", I hope they don't destroy my lungs.  Other than that, everything is candy.  I don't think I noted last time that I was indeed "promoted".  Although I do work as a busboy like 1 time a week now, while I transition into a grill attendent.  Grilling salmon is fun :)  My brother taped the OC for me thankfully.  And the OC has the longest commercials ever.. I just noticed this because I fast fowarded through the longest pieces of crap ever.  This episode wasn't that good, too much drama, not enough humour.  I mean drama is only good when you have decent actors, and holy shit the girl who plays Marissa, sucks ass.  The post-show preview was crazy though :  marriage - accident - even death!  CURAZY!  Uhm yeah, it's late, I smell like grilled food products and roast beef.  Gonna shower and sleep.  Later Days.

      I've been living on a dream for a while now, and still am...  Will everything occur the way I dream of it? Probably not, I'm most likely going to fail miserably in whatever I do, but that doesn't keep me down.  I still have hope, but I'm just so uncertain of everything.  But aside, from the thing bothering the living fuck out of me...  Today, I worked on the grill at the Mandarin, the grill, my god, it's the hottest mother fucking place in the world.  I mean I've stood infront of barbeques before and cooked patties and the like, but holy shit this is the most ridiculous shit ever.  Other than that, the job is SOooo OOOo OOooOOo damn easy.  I mean, all I do is cook shit and carve prime rib.  There's a difference between prime rib and roast beef apparently (who would have thought?!), apparently, prime rib is better, up one grade over roast beef.  Who knew?!  But in anycase, I'm a crappy carver.  So if you come to the Mandarin in the next two weeks, don't.  I can't carve meat for shit, I need to work on it hardcore.    But today, this one kid, who must have been like 8 years old, was hiliarous.  He kept coming back for more prime rib, or maybe just to talk to me or something, because he came back 6 times, and everytime he wanted a big ass slab of prime rib, and I was like sure, and I was complimenting him and stuff.  Because seriously, I don't think  I  can even eat as much meat as that little mofo got.  But he was cool, and we had pretty good small talk.  Kids are so much cooler than adults, seriously, the adults are some demanding jackasses.  "That's a little too rare..." My god, it's just a little pink!  It's not going to kill you.  Anyway, moving on up, and my mind is extremely distracted with shit.  So if I blow up in your face, sorry.  Just distracted, and can't concentrate on anything but 3 things.  "What are they?" you might wondering... sorry it's time to play detective again..

      I refuse to "X it up" as they say.  Someone sent me a message with:   Yesterday morning 9 year old Cecilia Jhong's[sic] body was found in Missasauga[sic] ravine.  Please put a capital X at the beginning of your name to show your respect >> pass this on to everyone online.   You want to know what I feel?   I don't care.   As Andrew put it: A thousand X's for starving African children.  I'm calling all you X'ers, a bunch of followers who like to show they care, when they don't.  If you really do care so much, donate everything you own to the Salvation Army or some other charitable organization and become a missionary.  The current people on my list that are liars (in no particular order):  Azim, Luke, Brett, Adeel, Rabiya, Ryan, Christie, Steve, Riaz.  I really don't care.  I really could care less.  A 9 Year old girl died, get over yourself.  People die everyday, someone probably died in the past second somewhere in the world.  And guess what? No one but their immediate family/friends gives a shit.  I'm pretty sure there was a subway bombing a week or two ago, and guess what?  I didn't see any X's being passed around then either.  All I'm saying is, cut the bullshit and move on.  No one talked about it when she went missing, so when she's dead, it matters?  Right, so when she was alive no one cared, but when she's dead she's a little more important?  Right...    So to simply put it, you're all doing this to make it seem like you care, and I'm calling your bluffs.  And for some reason, I'm wrong, and you  actually  do care, prove it to me, get off your ass and go do something.  Show me I'm wrong.  Sending a little message around MSN and marking it with an X doesn't count as mourning, or any sort of respect.  Write a letter to the family, go see them, I don't know, give them a donation, anything.  If not, you're just another lemming.  If you think I'm a bastard, then go ahead, you know I'm right.

      I forgot to blog that on Thursday and Friday, amazing things happened.  I for the the first time in a lifetime, and then again the next day, poured a  1:1 ratio  of milk to cereal.  The first time, was like: "Oh my god.. I finally did it.. 10 years of cereal-eating for this.. this very moment!"  And the second time was like: " I own."  If you don't know what the hell I'm talking about then let me explain:  You know (for those who eat cereal), when you finish up your cereal, there's that left over milk?  You know what I'm talking about right?  So anyway, there are two options, drink it or pour it out, and for me, I pour it out, because I'm not really a fan of cereal-flavoured milk and those little bits floating here and there- it makes me wanna gag.  So, a 1:1 propotion of milk to cereal would mean, when you spoon that last mouthful, there is no milk left!  Genius I say.  G - E - N - I- U - S!  The weird part is that a couple weeks before, Hannah was bragging how she could do it, and now I can too! Craziness!

      Aye, lot's of working on my part, and I'm working again tomorrow.  Man this long weekend is blowing chunks so far.  But whatever, this week I was up in gambling and that's pretty good.  I think I'm only down like $40-60 over the past two months, which isn't too bad, considering.  I'm getting pretty comfortable playing against Steve Parm, Naveer, Tai and Patrick.  At first I was scared of them, and after playing a week or so against them, I'm starting to feel out how they play and there's nothing to be afraid of.  I've beat them all at least once so far, and although they're all a little more loose than I am, I don't think they're that much better than me, aside from the fact they're all more experienced, as they play WAY more than me.  In other news, I went to  Turtle Jacks after work today, and they seem to keep serving me every time.  Heh, this time we got a pitcher of beer and I knocked back a few.  I think 3 glasses in total, and having alcohol flush isn't too fun.  It's not really a big deal, as I'm not even remotely drunk, but my face turns red which causes people to worry... but whatever, just building up that alcohol tolerance.  In any case, the weird story of the day was that Vanessa who's like 28, met up with someone working at Turtle Jacks, apparently they both graduated in the same year from Notre Dame (in Brampton).  That's really weird, 10 or so years later, you end up bumping into someone... and actually able to recognize them.  I also learned that with about 1000 dollars, I could spend a good two weeks in Mexico at a 5 star hotel, all expenses payed.. and that, I should get my Smart Serve certificate and then a bartending certificate when I turn 19 and I think Calgary won vs Canucks, but I'm not quite sure as I wasn't really payting attention that much.  I like the Flames way more than the Canucks.  I guess people don't change much over time.  Especially in their later years.  Another thing, I recovered from my thumb and index finger numbness like a couple days ago, and today, I was carving again, and guess what?!  It's back.  I can't feel my thumb nor index finger, and it's a bitch to type.  Feels so damn weird.    Crud, I smell like meat.. gotta shower.. gotta sleep.. wake up to another day of meat grillin' and meat carvin'.    Later days.

      I can sense another revelation or change in Danny-Land (the self-proclaimed, self-conscious self) as many things haven't been going my way lately, and I don't like that one bit.  Although I've been enjoying freedom and the like, the lack of care on my part towards a lot of things has made me question myself in the past few months.  I mean, shit, I've been gambling non-stop for about 5 weeks now, and recently, I haven't been fairing too well.  If I were to give a rough estimate of how much money I lost it would be like $50-60.  Surprising?  No not really, I play when I'm tired, I play when I'm not feeling well, I even play when I don't feel like playing... what reason really? Just to pass the time, it's the only thing exciting left in my day, and to me, at this moment, that's kinda sick.  I mean, the only thing I look foward to during the day is to gamble, and that in itself is demented.  Maybe I need a little help, maybe I need a kick in the right direction, but I really doubt that, I just need a little time I think.  A little time to reorganize my life into what it should be, rather than what it is right now.  Ruth said today that the boys are going through a phase... and I thought about it.. and I disagreed,  a majority of us are mature individuals,but a lot of us are just deviating from what we once were as those shells no longer fit us well, I think we've all just grown up.  I know I have and it's pretty safe to say everyone has as well.  Don't get me wrong though, I've always loved gambling, it's something that's pure, and that's why I love it, it's pure competition without any advantages to any given player, other than experience, and that in my opinion is raw competition, and I thrive on it.  But, the past couple weeks haven't really been my weeks, not sleeping, not eating properly, I've turned into something I never wanted to become.  It's tiring and it's stressful, and it only mounts onto all the other things that are bothering me right now.  Sometimes I feel like exploding, and I think a lot of my anger is beginning to slip out every now and then, I may burst into shouting or just shrug people off like they next existed.  Truth be told, I'm not really like that, but there's just too many things for me to handle right now, and I don't think I can deal with it all.  But whatever, I'll manage, I always have, and I probably always will, but it would be nice to share that with someone, or at least I dunno..... there are a lot of things that I wish for.  Like yesterday, my Dad asked me to pray as it was some sort of Buddhist/Chinese something day, and the first thing I said was "God, if you exist, tell me, why...why now? of all times?"  and then I continued onto the usual wishing for good fortune and other crap that my parents have engrained into me since I was like two.  (Funny how I turn to God when nothing works out right..?)  I dunno... whatever.  Things happen for a reason and I'm just going with the flow.  Maybe it'll all work out and everything will be candy, maybe not... who knows, only time will tell.  The story of my life: I dunno.

      An hour dissapeared today, although in reality, time never actually dissapeares, it merely occurs.  Well, time is just a concept really, it doesn't actually have any existence at all.  But whatever.. enough trying to be smart, I'll leave JP and Josh to do that.  I just watched  urlLink Lost in Translation , and I really liked it.  I mean when someone says fifty million words, and the translator just responds with "Look at camera", that's rich.  I dunno, the movie is very melancholy though, there isn't really a climax, an ending, nor a beginning.  Well, there is literally.. but.. yea.. you know what I mean..  It's a really good movie, although, you really need to pay attention as the quirkiness and the jokes are very subtle and if you aren't on the ball you'll miss out on a lot.  I have to say, the movie gets mucho points for it's uniqueness and it's ability to capture "real-life"-like moments, awkward pauses et al.  It's really good, I sware, but if you're looking for action... go watching something else :p  Anyway, good movie, to cap off a good night.  Hannah's party roxored, Asian theme - lol... funny shizzle and like 50 million different fruit smoothies... and what has got to be the most drawn out movie ever (a brown movie)... oh man it was like 3 hours of crazy falling in love business and people dying of heart disease and other crazy gay jokes.  Hiliarous, but shit, this isn't Le Mans, people.    Yeah, I didn't know White Rose was going out of business until today when I got a house-warming plant/flower/thing.  In any case, tonight has been good, as well as the previous night, with the Ruth's LaserQuesting and Steve getting his ass soaked.  Man, I really could use that hour though...

       urlLink The Poker Dictionary  defines a rush as:  several winning hands in a short period of time.   And baby, I've been winning everything left to right, and I'm in a  GOOD  mood.  So good, I'm ecstatic and going nuts!  Not only am I winning, I got my McMaster acceptance today, so that's massive scorage on my part.  Not only that, apparently I get choice of program come selection time at Mac, so that's good news for me.  Although Mac is my last choice, it's still good to know that they accepted me, at least now I know for sure that I'm going somewhere, which relieves so much pressure like you wouldn't believe it.  I feel like completely new, a hell of a lot happier and just a couple of hours ago I was dancing around in my house.  Everything is just dandy right now and I'm lovin' it. (qv McDs.)  Oi vhey GoooOOooD Day!  What else... here's some much anticipated things coming:  April 16th - Kill Bill Vol. 2 - I gotta see it.  I gotta get in.  Blah I'll guarentee anyone that I'll get carded.  May 15th - Troy - I love medieval epic war films.  May 7th - SHAOLIN SOCCER (FINALLY?!?!) I've seen it like 3 times already, but I want to see how they dubbed it.  How crappy that is.  May 28th -  urlLink Andrea 's Birthday! & Formal!! & The After Party!!! and let's not forget (The Day After Tomorrow) Edit: and it's Steve's Birthday too. Hurah!  June 4th -  Potter.

      So today, holy shit, has been the wierdest day of my life.  I mean, in a good sense.  I actually was severely late for something for once... I  COMPLETELY  missed an extremely important announcement.  I thought the Euclid test began at Period 2, 'cause Eleesa told me that the day before, but I don't hold her up for that, 'cause I missed the morning announcment completely, so it was my fault.  But holy crap, I came into the Euclid test like 1 hour and half into it, and I was like.. holy fuck... I'm so stupid.  Anyway, I was also suppose to meet Mr.Garton and some other person about IPRC regading my brother.  But I left early so that I could get to the Euclid test "on time" - laugh.  Oh hilarious.    Mr. Young kindly gave me some extra time, and I did like 7/10 questions, which isn't bad, but isn't good.  I mean question 9 and question 10 were like WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS?!  I just got confused and left it.    Aye, aftewards though, I gambled, and this week and last week I've been on a serious rush... won $25 today, and up a lot during the lunch game.  Hilarious.. I called Steve and Naveer's straight draws, with my full houses.  Pure jokes.  Against steve, he has a straight on the turn, and I hit a full house on the river.  Against Naveer, he raises all in on a straight draw on the flop, and I call him with trips.  Both of them got pwned, and Tai went down after a few rounds.  Aye, good day... good day.  I feel more relaxed now... aye !  Uhm, what else, P-Rim is alright, not everything is organized but I found some clothes for Jenn and Aaron..   Uh... Oh and today I got some paska at Hannah's... some good time spent there, it was a beautfiul day too, blowin' bubbles and what not.  And that wasn't a typo, I meant to type paska.  It's some sort of bread like thing that has an icing spread, it's surpisingly good, it's actually damn good.  Anyway, I'm off, oh and my Mom doens't work anymore.. apparently the company is paying for her for the rest of her term, before the place moves (June 14th) or something... heh.. it's weird having my mom around the house when I wake up..

      Love Actually is the funniest movie EVER.  Aside the fact that Keira Knightley is in it... it's really really funny.  I think it's because I really dig British accents.... or maybe it's that kind of British humour that's so hiliarous.  Or maybe it's just Keira Knightley.  Aye, good movie...  I also watched 8 Mile... kinda short... not so stellar ending.. but it was good nonetheless... I could have used more asskicking or battling... and Kim Bassinger is such a whore... lol  :p

      Lack of bloggage on my part... there's many reasons for that...  Not much has happened, and the things that have happened, there isn't much to talk about.  This week was just chock-full of CultureFest galore.  In fact, I think this entire week has been a complete waste for me (school-wise)  I don't think I attended a single class that was worth going to this entire week.  I've learned absolutely nothing, and today, I just said "Fuck it" and stayed home.  There's no reason to go school anymore, there's no reason to sit their and mindnumbingly try to pay attention.  'Cause there's nothing to learn.  The next two months is just going to be us ploughing away trying to squeeze ourselves out of school.  And when we're out, we'll all be a little happier.  Heh, funny thing is, since Wednesday, I've been totally lost.  I no longer have anything to do after-school (since Pac Rim finished, and I'm greatful of that... all that unneeded stress was well....just unneeded.) But, it's like there's a big void in my day now, I have nothing to do for about 4 hours of my day.   Some people are like : Why don't you just go home?  Most people's home are comfortating, my home isn't like that, it's desolate, it's filled with anxiety and the unknown.  I walk into my house, and of course everything seems absolutely normal, and I'm not saying that it isn't... because it is.  It's just that, there's sorta....  a feeling floating around my house right now.  A feeling of "What are we going to do?".  It's not like there isn't any love in my house, because there is, and it's not like my parents are crazy, because they aren't, it's just that... all my life my parents have never talked to me, they've never been there for me, and now that's all they want to do, and I'm just not use to it, and I'll probably be never use to it.  I don't appreciate being smothered and having to answer thousands of questions everytime I walk through my front door.  I just want to be left alone.  I hate going home, and I hate having to sit in a house with that.  I try to stay away as much as possible and preoccupy myself with as much as I can.  The more I don't have to think about it, the better, and happier I'll be.  But today, that didn't happen, I elected to stay home and my house is slowing chipping away at the wall I built around myself.  Eventually, I'll have to face reality, but I was hoping that I could move away in a good 3-4 months and never have to see them again.  Again, I want to make it clear, that there's nothing wrong emotionally with my house, it's just that, I'm taxing on my parents, and they're taxing on me, emotionally and financially.  I just can't deal with the stress of having to be there FOR my parents, it should be the other way around, they should be there for me.  And they try, and miserably fail, and that's why I want to go, I want to fly away and just put some distance.  I need some air to breathe.  I need to get out.  Maybe I shouldn't be telling everyone this, maybe it's a big mistake, maybe, hell, I'm making it a bigger deal than it actually is.  But if anything, all I want is just not to be here.  __________________  Another exciting thing happend on Wednesday.  I went out with Hannah, and I was nervous and excited and I was scared for a good while.  But in the end, I had a good time and it was a night well spent.  I tend to get really nervous whenever I'm around Hannah, and it's the one thing that's pissing the living day lights out of me.  Especially in group situations, I feel completely vulnerable and unable to be myself.  I just can't.  It's like I've already set myself up to sound and act like an idiot.  It's weird.  But 1 on 1, it's a lot easier to be myself, and it's a lot easier to carry on a conversation and have a good time.  It's strange and I don't have a reason for it and that's all I've really found, and that's all the insight I can give.  __________________  Thursday was just a complete waste, I mean, shit, I went to school, to study for 50 minutes, went to CultureFest, and spent 2 hours writing an incredibly difficult Engineering Contest.  Fuck me.  Then I spent the rest of the day wasting hours.  Life feel's like such a waste.  __________________  And that brings us up to date, in the Life of Danny.  If only I got my UofT and Loo letters would I really be happy and have no worries.  Not much to say.  Not much to do.  The only thing left is just to say 'woo-hoo'.    I think UofT is #1 now.  Maybe Waterloo.  If I get letters to both, it's going to be a tough choice.  If I get neither, I'll be going to Mac.  Queen's require me to send it back May 15th, and I'm like... you're such bastards.  So, I'm most likely going to HAVE to wait 'till after May 15th to hear from the other's.   So that removes Queen's automatically, such bastards.  Such mother fucking bastards.  I like Queen's too, they even gave me a scholarship.  Oh and I got invited to meet the Dean and associate Dean and etc at Mac.  Too bad Mac is my last choice... sigh..

      We'll see what this week brings... a lot of stuff happening, pac-rim mostly and some studying for math.  Oi.  Not much to say, except this week may bring many surprises for myself, or a lot of dissapointments, we'll see how'll it be.  I missed the OC again.  Man... my brother is so unreliable sometimes.

      I never knew 3rd lunch was so unfriendly.  Although, I have never skipped 3rd period, I probably never will, Ms. Gorski is too cool of a teacher and she's never away, and on top of that, I actually enjoy the class, which makes it impossible for me to even conceive of skipping it, but nonetheless, from what I've been hearing, 3rd lunch seems to be much different than I anticipated.   Keep in mind I'm commentating merely on what I've been hearing, I haven't even seen any of this :p   I dunno, I won't say much, because I don't have first hand information, but "the rift" isn't too happy.  I'm sure it's not a big deal, but I'm sure there's some animosity between each side.  Which is okay... but it's been like 6 months... maybe the gap is too far to fix now but people should try.  This won't mean much, but if I were there, I would at least try.  I was talking to Manh today, and as many of you know, he's quite the intelligent guy.  You might not like him because he's always just too  "just"  but I like that.  He's got edge.  And I can relate to a lot of things he talks about, in fact, I can relate to almost everything he talks about (except baseball... :D) but in anycase, we had a conversation about maintaining ties/bonds with others, especially after high school.  It's unfortunate that I do not have the same lunch as others, which puts me at a bad position to spend time with my friends, let alone I work 4-5 days out of a 7 day week.  So, that gives me a couple of days of free time to spend with others.  Don't get me wrong, I like everyone (you might be laughing now) but I do.  Some people I rather spend less time with, but I find everyone enjoyable to be around to extents and these extents are quite flexible ;).  I have my priorities as do others, and some people rank several fold over others, and that's just the way it is.  So with whatever little time I get, I try to spend it with people I care about, not to say I don't care about everyone else, it's just that I can only be spread so thin.  Another thing is...  It's weird now, everyone is in their own little groups and can't get a long with each other.  Maybe it's not so obvious, but everyone is drifting back to their same-race friends.  Not that that's bad.  But just look at it.  Grade 9 - Super Friends - Super Group (Everyone, like 30 of us).  Now we're all splintering off and everyone's hating everyone else.  Hate's too strong of a word.  More or less dislike. Yes, Dislike is the word I'm looking for.  But yeah, just look at it.  -I hang out with Luke, Aaron and Steve prodiminately. (Asian, yes Steve is Asian :p) -Riyaad, Azim and Adeel do a lot of things together. (Brown, like Brownies.. mmm) -The Girls (minus Roanna) do a lot of things together. ( sorry Row. It's just fact. >_ ) -Ruth has been doing a lot of things with Alex and Co. (all of whom are white) -Andrew, Greg, JP. -Andrew hangs out with those Grade 11s (all of whom are white) -Greg hangs out with Jess, Steph, Riss, etc.. (see the pattern?) -Gabe with his countless Asian buddies.  Is it inevitable?  Are we bound by race to end up associating with those of your own race?  I like to think not.  But observation tell me otherwise.  Of course there are examples that prove what I just said wrong.  But those examples aren't quite the same.  Andrea and Sunny are a package, obviously race bares no meaning, but we're talking about friendships, not love.  Also, I'm not saying we don't associate with one another because of race, but the bonds are note  as close  as those of the same race.  Maybe I'm just reading too much again.  I dunno, I think about stuff like this though, and I like to point it out.  'Cause is it merely coincidence that things are like the way they are or is it just fact?  I remember in primary school, everybody was friends with everyone else, the older we got, the pickier we got and the more selective.  Maybe that's good, maybe it's not.  We're all people, we all deserve a chance.  Heck maybe this has nothing to with race whatsoever.  Which is good.  'Cause I thought we were all better than that.  Maybe we're just all too cliquey and can't hang out with whoever.  I remember talking to Ruth one day, and she said I replaced her along with her friends.  In essence, I did.  I'm not going to lie... circumstance changed things and am I going to say for the better.. well, yes and no.  I found more people I care about, and I still care about everyone else.  It's just I can't be everywhere at once.  Maybe that's it.  We're all doing so many things now, we just don't have time for each other.  We're all so concentrated in our own lives, too concentrated in getting into University, too concentrated of making salary, too concentrated on satisfying friends, too concentrated at pleasing everyone that we're forgetting the people that put us where we are in the first place.  Heck, maybe I'm just all wrong.  But someone say something, 'cause If I'm alone (which I already am, cursid 4th lunch), and everything is actually just fine and is not what it seems like.  Tell me.  I don't like being out of the loop.    If anything, be surpised, people will always surpise you.  The goodness of of people that is.  You might not see it now, you might not see it tomorrow.  But when you least expect it, it'll be there.    Just a thought.  (A Sunny day and a lawn chair does that)  I sound like a preacher.  Go me.

      Actually, I just love The Texas Hold'em Poker.  I can't believe they actually played poker, of all gambling games, POKER!  Coincidence? I think not.  Before I start going on a spat on how The OC is so mimicing our lives... I'm just going to say this.  I'm crazy.  Delusional and insane.  The Prince & Me is also a fairly decent movie.  Actually, it was highly predictable and had the most retarded plot twists ever and it was just dribble.  But when you're in an completely empty theatre with someone else, who is to care?  What else... AHHHHHHHH MATH EXAM!  And Physics Test and Computer Science Test... AHHhhhhh.... man I so don't care about school anymore.  I need to win $5000 dollars in one night.  Hot damn, I could buy a car with that.  Let alone several prostitutes.  Look.  There's periods.  In places.  Where. There. Shouldn't. Be.  Anyway, I'm tired, and I have to study, the lack of coherence is from the lack of sleep.  Work is tiring.

      Math exam, easy, until last question.  Until I finished and realised my calculator was set to Degrees instead of radians, that must of cost me at least 10 marks right there, plus the 6 marks for the last question.  Fuck me.  Uh, my tux:  -Mandarin Collar -Black Silver - Button Covers/Cuflings -Black Matrix Vest -One Button Notch Lapel Jacket -Black Shoes  I think that was it.  It was like $100, and I liked the look of it.  I was going to go for a blue vest, but then I called up Hannah, and she reminded me of the slight bit of pink on her dress.  Aye, can't have all sorts of colours now!  Eh..  It's important to note I won't be wearing a tie, nor an ascot, or any other neck accessory, I hate ties.  Still need to get a corsage... aye.  My guess is, it's going to pink, to match her dress.   For Roanna:

      I have to say, although overly dramatic, the final episode of the OC was a good one.  The usual overkill in drama, was counterbalanced by Seth's innane banter, which is always good, ah the joys of tapioca pudding.  Poooooding!  It was a good episode, a fitting end to a season, somewhat cyclical, (they went to the same places as in the first episode, and Ryan wears the same thing he came there with).  It's like they've turned full circle!  Now where's that DVD Box set.  The other day, I think it was 2 days ago, I was in the AV office, and a music video came on on MuchMusic.  Saleem walked in and Riyaad and I are watching this video, as it's pretty fucked up but the music was pretty good so we were waiting for the little title/artist/rating thing to show up to figure out who it was and I believe it was "Take Me Out" - Franz Ferdinand.  Me and Saleem are like, hey don't I know that name from somewhere?  And it took me 2 fucking days to finally remember from grade 8 history.  Archduke Franz Ferdinand, the man who started World War 1.  Well he didn't start it, he died, and that caused it.  It was the other guy, from the Black Hand or some shizzle assassin group or some shizzle.  I dunno.  Took me two DAYS.  My god, my memory blows.  Well, back to math and the wonderful world of statistics.  Oh and I need to rent a tux, man fuck, I hate leaving things to the last moment, but that's when I do my best work.

      I still don't understand why a broken record would constantly replay the same part over again, wouldn't a broken record player do that rather than a broken record?   I should be doing something productive right now, like lets see... studying... or coding some pointless program for comp sci, or reading physics chapters or just even learning anything.  Instead, I'm moping around the house, well rather, I'm sitting down, moped-out, browsing through complete stranger's blogs.  I mean, I find some of these people really really interesting like this one guy who's the  urlLink manager of a strip club , he sure has some hilarious stories and other people and there  urlLink opinions on movies  and films.  There's even a blog where a person almost cut off her thumb 'cause  urlLink she's a complete klutz .  Not only that, I'm so sick right now from those 9 pancakes I ate, it's not even funny.  Honestly, I have this huge queasy, uneasy feeling in my stomach right now it's terrible.  9 pancakes aren't much, but the fact that all I can taste is batter right now is a little concerning.  Sitting here sucks, being in front of my computer sucks, maybe it's the pancakes talking, but I think I'm really getting tired of my computer.  It's just an huge void that's sucking my soul right into those little silicon bits so they can be parsed into 1s and 0s.    There's a lot of things I could be doing, there's a lot of things I should be doing, but all I'm doing here is sitting here, typing, as if this will help me at some later point.  Which hopefully it does.  Because, honestly, this blows goats.  What's this? Everything.  Everything I've ever done up to this point, because truth be told, I haven't done anything! I haven't done anything worthwhile, and anything worth talking about.  Yep, lack of self-esteem again Danny? oh yeah, talking to yourself again Danny? most definitely, slightly insane Danny? I have to concur on that last statement.  Heh.  I don't know what it is, but stress is getting to me, stress of everything, stress of living with my god forsaken family and the stress with dealing with everyone one else. I usually keep everything to myself, but I'm cracking, and I'm just saying fuck it once and for all.  I have problems, so does everyone else, you don't need to know what they are, but I'm going to tell everyone about them, because I hope to God that makes me feel just a little better.  Here's the order of what's bothering me:     Edit: I wrote like 2 pages of stuff down, read it over, found it a little too personal, and decided not to post it.  I'm sure it would have been a really interesting read, but I'm just not capable of sharing that much of myself, and in particular my problems to everyone.  It's not to fair to you guys and I'm sure it's not fair to the people that I refer to.  But don't worry, I can honestly say, I'm not harbouring negative feelings towards anyone, it's just that my problems are mine, and shouldn't be on the shoulders of others.  And yes, I do feel better now.

      I had a amazing breakfast today.  I went with Riyaad to Golden Griddle which was recommened by Paul (Henman?... whatever is last name is..)  and boy oh boy.  Was he right.  Best damn breakfast place ever.  For 7.49 I got some sort of crazy Homestyle Breakfast shizzle with eggs, toast, bacon, sausage, hashbrowns, pancakes.... I tell ya, it was the best damn meal I've had in ages.    Tomorrow, it's all you can eat pancakes for $2.99! 2-FRICKEN-99! TWO-NINETY-NINE!  That's ludicrous.  Insane even. Omg. I like it.  I think I just might wake up just to get all you can eat pancakes tomorrow (I'm not going to school tomorrow).  After that, my will crumbled as I gorged into my delicious pancakes and sunny-side-up eggs.  Mmmmm.    I gambled TWICE! Oi.  MMmmm. Pancakes.

      ala Turtle Jacks.  This time, the same waitress, decided to ask me "Are you sure you're old enough to drink?" Where I then replied with utmost certainty, "Why, Yes, Yes I am."  Ordered a Heinekken (sp?), Amaretto Sour, and had half of a Corona.  I'd have to say Heinekken is overrated, and Corona is a little light, I like Molson Canadian for some reason.  I dunno, Corona would be a good afternoon drink or like a relaxing drink, but Molson is better with food I think.. but that's just me.  Amaretto Sour is a pretty good cocktail, it's my favourite so far, but I've only had like two, so it doesn't really count.... laugh!  That's it, really... oh and cheese sticks, zucchinni sticks and this cheese/shimp/crab dip is hella good, and wings too.  If you haven't got it now, my intials stand for Drink and Drive as well.  I'm not boasting, or proud of it, and I know it's stupid, so stop telling me, but I'm in control of my life, and if I wish to die, so be it.

      It always seems like I get the short end of the stick, I mean, I do things for other people, and usually at some sort detriment to myself, and these are deemed 'favours'.  Now, I don't know if it's just me or not, but don't these 'favours' count for something?  Don't I get some sort consideration in return? I'm probably being petty again...   _____   To not lie, I'd have to say Trojan Fest wasn't very good.  In fact, I didn't enjoy a large majority of it, I don't know, maybe I'm just not a fan of music being played overly loud and overly rocking.  I was trying to get into it, and my attention span couldn't really handle the 5 minute solos and the ever so dark "Demonic Wrath".  But hey, that's just me.  Don't hate me, I know most of them were somewhat talented, and Michael was hot, but shit, it just was not my thing.  I've always though I was lyric-centered, and today kinda sealed that deal, w/o lyrics I can't really get into the music.  Meh, I guess I'm just weird. I left early though, after Warbrydes, the other bands might have been better though(I doubt it :/).   _____   I don't communicate very well, especially when I run low on sleep.  Speech becomes slurred, impossible to understand and generally doesn't make much sense.  I think this week my total sleep will total to about 20 hours.  4 hours per day, for 5 days.  Life's grande like that.

      I went to both of my classes today, and even then, I didn't even stay for either of them. I left computer science early so I could attend this Police Appreciation event, where the school was giving a painting to the Superintendent of 22nd Division, I believe his name was Sargeant Folley.  Anyway, Sunny and I got free food which was awesome, as there was salmon which was pretty damn good.  Best lunch I've had in ages.  They even had a fruit platter, and did I ever ravage that. I showed up in physics only to leave 10 minutes later as I had to go home to drive my mom to work.  I made some cupcakes today, I really didn't know what I was doing, but I learned that icing isn't that hard to make at all, all you need is icing sugar, butter, some vanilla extract, some milk/cream and blend away.  They tasted pretty good for my crappy cooking ability.  Nigertis owned my ass today, as soon as I got home, I ate, and then I went upstairs and had my phone with the full intent to call Hannah.  At some point, I closed my eyes just to rest them (I'm lying on my bed) and low and behold I fall asleep.  Greg called me at some point, he wanted to go out, and I said something a long the lines of : "I'm tired." and after that, I fell asleep again.  I woke up at like 10:15, and here I am.  Slightly upset that I fell asleep and couldn't do what I wanted, but overly refreshed.  Kudos to Greg though for this:  urlLink BLT   Another day not so well spent, I hope tomorrow is more fufilling.

      I have a test tomorrow, but for some reason I'm not the least bit afraid, or scared.  I haven't even begun to read the chapter and it's some what concerning, I know for a fact, that tomorrow is going to be one of the worst days of school, as I have done nothing for my two classes, and I will be dead tired, but strangely, I feel completly unafflicted.  I ate a whole mound of chocolate earlier, that's probably why I'm still up, I don't feel tired at all, but I don't feel like studying or doing something productive.  Apparently, it's very tricky to rock around, to rock around on time.  I spent most of my day, asleep, woke up, showed some love to my Mother, gave Riyaad my S-Video to Composite convertor, and spent the rest of my day with Hannah.  I should have thrown in studying in there somewhere, but eh.  I still can't realise why I'm not afraid, I should be, I should be scared of failing or at least doing poorly, I think logic is blocked for some reason, I spent like the last 3 hours, playing around with the blogger options and looking to be inspired to create a new layout.  Kinda sad, I really should be learning how magnets work and their properties.  I don't know squat.  I think I'll open that textbook now.  I think I just might not sleep today just to see how I'll be tomorrow, I have to work tomorrow too, and drive my mother to work (she found a job, yay) during lunch, go to work, and then pick her up late at night.  My schedule is really messed up now, and the fact I'm not sleeping today, could mean my entire week's sleeping habits will be messed up totally.  Oh well.  On another note, holy fuck does Booster Juice have large smoothies.  They're like just under a litre in size.

      Yesterday, I worked what could have possibly been the worst day of work since the summer I started working at the Mandarin.  In the 12 months I've worked there, I have never been so tired and pissed off in a single day just from work.  I worked a full day, meaning opening to close, which is 11.5 hours at the Mandarin, but I only get paid for 11 as I do get a break somewhere in there.  But anyway, it was one day prior to Mother's Day, and for those of you who don't know, Mother's Day, or any  special  day is just  chaos  at the Mandarin.  We usually get fully booked by reservations a week in advance of the special date.  With that said, on Saturday, we got flooded with unexpected amounts of customers to celebrate a day in advance.  So, we had to switch from regular service (any one can come in and get seated) to reservation-only.  The problem was, that we already had about 100 people standing/sitting/leaning/lounging in the foyer or whatever(there's a fancier name for it, I can't remember it right now) and more people were still coming in.  People with reservations still had to wait, as people with reservations prior to their reservations had priority so essentially everyone had to wait a good 1-2 hours before getting seated.  With that said, insane, mother-fucking, impatient asswipes decide to "seat themselves".  Right.  We catch people like this, because at the Mandarin, the system is all paper and pen because the hostesses write the bill and pass it the waiters who then fill out orders/drinks/etc... it's an old-fashion system but it works extremely well.  But in anycase, because people who "seat themselves" have no bill, we got them within 5-10 minutes, and then we had to kick them out.  Now, most people, I'm assuming, would leave as what they did was  wrong .  No, not at all, they would try to argue how that "they've been going to the Mandarin for 35 years" [the Mandarin has only existed for 25, buddy] or how they've been "waiting for a whole hour". [Other people have been waiting for two, stfu and wait].  We basically banned like a dozen people from the Mandarin, we didn't take pictures or anything, but it was funny as they were kicked out and it was just one of those things you can only laugh at.  Another thing is, tipping is not a must, but let's factor in the following things:  - Waiters/Waitresses get paid less than minimum wage.  - You tip for service. - Tips are usually split among other servers and busboys (yay me!) - You tip low (less than 15%) when the service sucks - You tip more when you like the service - Tipping nothing, means the service sucks completely, and that you'd never want to come here ever again.  One family, decided not to tip, which I wouldn't blame them if they felt dissatisfied with the service, but then had to gull to write on the bill:   "Sorry, we had to wait 2 1/2 hours for seats."  Well to Mr. and Mrs. TooFuckingImpatient,   The fact you have to apologize means the service was good, or at least, decent.  With that said, if you had to go out of your way to apolgize also means you felt somewhat guilty for not tipping.  Not only that, you felt so bad, you were compelled to give a reason.  But, you didn't want to tell the waiter, so you left a message on the bill and left.  Cowards.  Let me tell you what, the service was better than you expected, and we're sorry you had to wait 2 and half fucking hours, but don't blame the wait staff for working for an overly-popular and overly-successful restaurant.  The mere fact that you had to wait, shows the popularity of the restaurant and guess what, you can't blame the workers for the sheer gluttony of family and friends.  You're just looking for an excuse  not  to tip, a bunch of cheap-mother-fucking-cowards.  On another note, I exploded on a waitress as she left a bag of towels on my cart when I was trying to move a 60 lb bucket of dishes onto the cart (the bag was in the way).  I screamed " WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS?! "  After everyone turned around, I calmly said "Don't fucking put bags on my cart."  Shocked, she said "Where do I put it then?" where I replied "Just leave it on the floor, I'll fucking pick it up after."  That felt really good.  I also exploded on a new busboy for people ass slow, the conversation went like this:  Danny (calmly) : Move faster. Basu: I'm moving as fast as I can. Danny (calmly) : I'm sure you can mover faster than that, especially if you don't want to get fired. Basu (angrily) : How can I move any faster than this? [he's walking] Danny (screaming):  FUCKING RUN.   I work with incompetence, no one can speak English which is so aggrivating it's not even funny.

      I decided not to go to school again, it wasn't really much of decision, but at like 7:00, I was awoken, and then said, "let me sleep", and my dad actually let me sleep.  What a great guy.  The IB kids are done officially, but as the last month creeps on, I've been increasingly loosing interest in everything about school.  It's all fun and games most of the time, but I really don't enjoy being there.  It's not fun, entertaining or anything, I'm not even learning anymore, I'm completely super-saturated with everything that is Turner, and for that, I'll never return... until Tuesday of course =D.    With my new scanner/printer thing, I've really been playing around with it lately, scanning everything that's on my desk just for the hell of it.  So, I'm going to share a rare picture of myself looking as goofy as ever(not like the other 6 million aren't):       Me being absolutely bored, I went and looked back and some of my old yearbooks and stuff and just wondered what all the people I've met are doing these days, because, in about one or two months time, I'll be doing the same thing with the people I met at Turner.    So...  Top Row (starting from the left):  Geoff Smith - He was the heartthrob of Greenbriar, the uber-badass that everyone wanted to be, the guy who didn't know much, but was an advid drinker, smoker, toker, and all the rest.  He was pretty cool, I started to get to know him late in Gr.8 and he wasn't as bad as all the hype lead me to believe, I mean I casted him off as a complete drunkard and loser way prior, and when I started talking to him and playing basketball with him, he wasn't that bad after all, he was just living in the moments.  I think he was the first person to ever offer me a drink/smoke/toke, and I declined all three.  I don't know what would have become of me if I did...  Catherine Chinna - Slavica's good friend, I really doubt they're friends anymore, but I could be wrong... All I remember of her is the fact we called her a Chia Pet and that she broke an entire shelf worth of beakers.  Doug Robinson - The uber-uber-badass, this man failed a grade and still came out on top, we elected him valedictorian(sp?).  He was honestly the most down to earth guy I've ever met.  Funny too.  Middle Row:  Mme. Allibon - She was the attractive teacher, and everyone knew that, she was cool though, and just a fun person to be around.  Anthony (something) - Good guy, super athelete, he was a leader and a great guy.  Blaire (something) - He was an uber-geek, more so than I, but a different kind of geek, like, pop-culture geek sorta thing, I dunno, he was funny, and he had his moments.  Mrs. Robson? - Our guidance counsellor, she had a lot of aspirations and a lot of dreams, and she rested a lot of them on Slavica and us, I think we did a good job for what we did, but sometimes I just wonder if we ever made a difference.  Bottom Row:  The first guy (don't remember his name) - he was a loser.  I can't recall any good qualitiies... all I remember from him is that he showed up at Graduation wearing a t-shirt, shorts and running shoes.  Not even a collared shirt... jesus.  Slavica Stojimirovic - I liked her back then, did stuff, had goals, whatever... I can recall her sucking up a lot though... and she does that today... funny how some people don't change at all.  Danny Dang - Grade 8 was my breakout year, my personality, my self-image everything that I was completely changed.  I was more or less, one of those die-hard, do homework every night super keener kids in Grade 6.  And in Grade 7, I started to like white girls (oddly) and I started to become a little funnier, although still timid and shy in all social situations.  Grade 8... was a defining year, I was still shy and timid, don't get me wrong, but gained a lot of self-confidence and charisma that year... oh grade 8, how I miss you.  I actually cried the last day of school.  I remember it quite well too...  Last day of school had a dance, and as a part of Media Works(tm), Riyaad, Chris Platny, and I were basically "DJ's" as we ran the AV stuff.  It was fun, it was good, and I had a blast.  I remember cleaning up and packing up all the cables and what not, and school was over like 45 minutes prior but there were still a hell of a lot of kids still around the school...  I was sitting in the office for some reason with Riyaad, and I think Melissa and Alissa walked in, with tears in the their eyes, and I just couldn't help it, but tear up too.  We then proceeded with the hugging, and kissing, and the "I'm going to miss you... I'll see sometime in the summer.." kinda deal, although we were all really good friends (they called me their sister [another story for another time]), we knew, or at least, I knew, I was never going to seem them again.  We hung out in different social circles, and I really doubted I'd ever seem them ever again.  They really impacted my life, that year anyway, and if I ever knew I was going to die, and needed to write a speech, they'd be included along with the hundreds of other people.  It's my goal to do that... my will will have a letters addressed to everyone who I thought impacted my life in some way, with the simple words "Thank you."  Kinda sappy? Most definitely, but I'm sappy guy.  Justine Wilmont - She was honestly, the most out-going, crazy girl I've ever met in my whole life.  Secretly, I had a crush on her for a while, but eh, whatever.  I think I've only liked white girls since that time, I don't ever recall ever actually liking an asian girl ever.  I mean there's hot asian chicks, but seriously, it's not quite the same... Anyway, Justine was funny, and she could carry a conversation until the next day and then some, she has done so many things and will be doing so many things with her life, I was completely astounded.  Shocked even.  She was a cool girl, really cool.  Although, she had some of the worst spelling I've ever seen (*cough her 1 page yearbook entry as reference *cough).  Fun, attractive, outgoing, smart, can't write, what's not to love about her?  ________________  If you're wonder why we're dressed up like retards, it's because we were the inaugural Leadership team for all of Peel I believe.  Our school (to my knowledge at least), was the first school to form a student ran leadership group to address student issues, like bullying, etc, etc... we were called the "Bee Postive Team" get it? Be? Bee? hahahah!  My brother (who goes to Earnscliffe) is on their version of it, the L-crew, the L stands for Leadership.  I don't know if we made a difference, but all I know is that we tried and that's good enough.  _________  Memory lane, it's great to look back, but one should never live in the past.

      I kinda learned to salsa today, not really though, I just kinda learned the basic, I wish I had nigs' mad sense of rhythm and Hannah tends to end up leading somehow ( insert blush smiley here ).  But it's all good.  I also met uh Robyn today, she seems like a nice girl, I kinda regret not really talking to her, but I didn't want to intrude in the Hannah-Robyn-Jenna bonding time.  Uh I got a new printer/fax machine/scanner.  I know all-in-one's aren't that great, but honestly, for the last hour, I've been confuddling with this wonderous machine that I doubt I'll ever get bored of it.  I've even scanned a new picture of myself, so I don't have to use the same one over and over again... FRICKEN GENIUS.  This is my favourite picture of myself:     Oh and if you want to see the machine,  urlLink here  it is...  Jesus, I have school tomorrow, and I don't give a shit, I think I've lost everything that has been taught to me in the past 10 years.  Good thing I never had a work ethic to begin with.. woo!  Later days folks, and 1..2..3....5..6..7..   (I can't dance btw. :/)

      Skipped school.    Awoken by phone call.  Did nothing.  Ate breakfast.  Wasted afternoon.  Tai called me, asking me to come play poker, how the fuck did he get my phone number?  Watched Oprah's Million Dollar Wedding Giveaway or something. I could have sworn the cute little white couple should have won, but of course, in Oprah fasion, the black people won.  Watched this Spelling Bee documentary or something, was mildly entertaining.  Hurt my knee walking up the stairs, as I slipped.  Walked it off, my dad laughed at the fact that I didn't make a sound.  Usually I curse or something, but today it didn't happen.  Ate dinner.  Got another package from UofT, this time saying we'll tell you in late May (isn't it already late May?)  Experienced Deja Vu at exactly 7:45.

      I've been bombarded by people who need help with their SAC speeches lately, and although I'm extremely flatttered, last year's speech was inspired by Andrew Piron and Ruth McArthur.  I'm sure they deserve just as much credit as I did.  Also, apparently, a lot of my brother's friend's older siblings who go to Turner, know of me, which is kind of scary, as I don't know any of them, and I've been added to like 10-15 people's MSN recently, which is also quite scary.  I don't know anybody, yet people know of me.  Oi VHEY!  In other news, plently of hostility is felt upon me by some people, ironic how I said I could make it better, but really, I've made it worst.  Uh other than that, there's not much to say, except I bought chocolate almonds today, I love chocolate almonds, I wonder why no one sells them for like a dollar at a grocery store or something, instead I have to spend a toonie and buy it for a good cause (from Luke's brother this time).  Eh, I guess I'll never know...

      If you were asked if you could only live once, what would you?  The most likely responses are:     fall in love   succeed   become powerful   become rich   becoem famous     I'm sure there's more, I'm sure there's more petty things everyone wants, but I'm just trying to be general here...   As of this moment, I'm doing all those things, I'm doing everything I've ever wanted, and then some, I'm letting go of my past, and moving on.  I secretely dispise my family, it's like as if they're the biggest weight I have to carry, and yet I love them at the same time.  I'm not perfect, I'll make millions of mistakes from now and until I die, I'm just letting go, letting go of every inhibition, of everything that could prevent from just about anything.  Because honestly, I feel like I can just about do anything and that's how I want to live.    To Leslie and everyone else:  Sure, I've been taught many things, and I think it's about damn time I stopped listening to other people.  Peer Pressure has been my friend, my enemy, and most importantly my tool to convince other people into doing whatever.  It's overwhelming how powerful a few nods or a few shakes of a friends' head can be.  I really just don't give a damn about much anymore.  I'll probably tell you off, if you said something I didn't like.  Am I being more reckless? sure.  Am I hurting anyone? No, not really.  But everyone seems to think that I will, that I will kill myself, or worst yet, kill someone else.  I can do that everyday, I drive that 2 tonne box of metal down the 410 everyday, I can become distracted for a single instant and slide far left into the median and probably take out a few cars on my way.  I might miss some kid running behind a parked truck and nail him.  Is it going to happen? Who knows.  I'll let God decide, since that's what popular opinion tells me.  Am I bragging? No, not really, I'm sure I said something how I'm not boasting somewhere in there, but to reaffirm, this is a journal, and this is for my use.  3 or 4 years from now, I want to be able to look back at this and read what I did, the misadventures I stepped into, and the things I've learned from.  I try to keep this thing as truthful as possible, but in some cases, some topics are just a little too personal.  Maybe you've grown to know me a little better through reading my blog, but it will never make up for Danny in person.  The blog is just a portion of my personality, a portion of my thoughts and it isn't the whole package, you might be reading something shocking, something funny, and something sad, but in the end, you're only getting a part of a picture.  Think of it as fullscreen compared to widescreen.  I think it's great how I can somewhat communicate with friends via this blog, but I really do miss talking, I really do miss speaking, I really do miss listening, I'd really appreciate if you came up to me in the halls and called me a fucking idiot.  I really would. (no sarcasm here.)  Yeah we probably argued over the internet more so than we've talked in person.  But circumstance has prevented us from ever talking, I really can't blame anyone for this, so I'll just let it be.  Growing up has nothing to do with getting better, getting wiser, we all make the same mistakes over and over again, hence why history doesn't even know how the Greek empire fell, but in any case, it doesn't have to be like this.  You don't have to hate everyone, you don't have to "escape".  I'm sure I'd love to just get away from here, but at the same time, there's a lot of good things going on too, and that's what keeping me going, the good things, there's no point of focusing on the negative, it never brought me any good.  For the past 17 years, I've been an introvert, a person who never shares, a person who never tells, a person who kept their mouth shut.  Why? Conditioning.   I've never been allowed to argue with my parents and never allowed to talk back, and until recently I actually believed and followed them.  Now, it's a lot different, I'll explode on anyone, anywhere if you push the right buttons.  I started letting go of the old, and only now am I the person that I really want to be.  I realise that now, and it's good.  I guess there's just a lot of pent up anger.  And if you want a closer, even though I've said it a thousand times:  I realise it's wrong.

      There's this machine at the Grande, where you have to stop the light on the red to win a prize, in this case, really old CDs.  I just tried to win for the novelty of it, and would be a nice way to cap off a wonderful movie.  And in agreeance with JP, I'd also think the movie should be renamed to Achilles, man fuck, he has that cool ass jump spear move, which is uber badass, although in real life it wouldn't be too hard to accomplish, but holy crap with slow motion and panning cameras, it looks like the shizzle.  Anyway, the machine wouldn't let me win, as I was off one light 4 times.  I think the speed changes when it gets near the red lights so it makes it even more difficult, next time, I'm going to press it 2 lights in advance.  So anyway, I forgot to mention my water heater broke two days ago.  So I've been taken showers like in "old vietnam" as my parents describe it.  Boiling water, and taking showers with a bucket is so not Vietnam, I'm going to say it's more like Mexico.    Anyway, gtg, gotta take a shower, before that boiled water cools down.

      Taken form  urlLink MADD :  A 137-pound woman would reach .08 BAC after about three drinks in an hour on an empty stomach (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration) - a level that exceeds what is commonly accepted as social drinking.  I had a two and a half drinks I weight like 135.  I also had a shitload of wings, cheese sticks, nachos and other non-healthy assorted foods.  So, I guess I was under the BAC limit.  If you think I was drunk, or impaired in anyway, you're an idiot.  But, on principal, yes it was stupid. I can honestly say, I was not drunk, nor was I impaired, nor even buzzed.  I might of been slightly more socialable, but not drunk.  I've done many stupid things.. hrm 3 times I've drank and drove, each time I was under 3 drinks, I really doubt I was uncapable of handling my car.  But, hey, I was drunk right? I couldn't possibly been able to handle my car right?  I think I'm more dangerous when I speed 160 down the 410 and 403 or when I'm racing Riyaad or Steve down Steeles then when I'm driving home   To Leslie: let it go.  If you don't, I'll just bring it up every time I see you.  I'll rub it in, if I have to, just so you can shut up.  Honestly, you think an illiterate oaf of a person like me is undeserving of that 97, then heck, say it, if you think you deserve such a mark, say it.  I mean, everytime I'm talking to you, Erin and Lisa, this happens to come up, if you're all so desperate to prove your self worth through a measly English course, than by all means, slander away, because I don't keep alcohol hidden in  my  closet.  I'll even give one of you the English award (if I get it) if it will let you sleep at night.  I'm a social drinker, if I had to classify myself as anything, I don't binge drink, I don't drink every weekend, I don't knock back a few when I'm depressed nor do I have any alcohol in my possession, I just drink when the occassion calls for such, and even then, I don't drink exorbitant amounts.  If I'm wrong, so are the millions of people who go to a restaurant order 2 beers for lunch/dinner, and drive home.  Honestly, get in perspective, I bet your fathers drink more than I do at a restaurant, and you're in the car with them.  And finally, no I don't have a death wish, nor do I have suicidal tendecies.

      Ugh.  What a pain, my nose feels like it got hit by a two tonne truck filled with fragrances from who knows where.  I honestly most of tested like 30 colognes today, and my nose is completely fucked.  I did however, settle on Hugo Boss Classic, but up until the wire, it was a strong battle between Calvin Klein Eternity, and this Hugo Boss orange one.  But Classic came out on top.  I got my Tux too, which took quite some time to get everything checked out, and that was a pain.  Although I really really like my shoes, they're so damn shiny :D.  Uh, yea, that's all I really got, tomorrow is going to be hectic, I'm going to have to call like everyone to get everything sorted, because I don't know what the hell is going on.  ... sigh.... UGH!  Not to mention I won't have sleep, fuck.

      Apparently, I'm Engineering Science material.  Wow.  I can't believe it.  That's ridiculous.  I didn't get any scholarships though, but that's okay... Wow.  I'm still creaming my pants.  WOW WOW.  I drove Greg home today, and he had this huge package in his mailbox, and he was all happy because it was his Deftones stuff, and I was kinda sad, 'cause I didn't get anything in the mail, but when I got home, A FUCKEN HUGE thing sticking out of mail box, I was so fucking ecstatic it wasn't even funny.  I took it out of the box, looked at the corner, it read: "University of Toronto" and then checked that it was addressed to me, and tore the sucker while my car was still running. (I pulled up, saw it, and basically jumped out of my car).  I opened it, and holy fuck, ENGINEERING SCIENCE.  I made the cut-off, that's ridiculous.  RE-FUCKING-DICULOUS.  I hope my Waterloo stuff comes soon, so I can compare and debate... oh someone help me if it does come, because I don't know what to do otheriwse!  Got an e-mail:   Dear Danny:  Congratulations! I am pleased to inform you that you have been admitted to Electrical Engineering at the University of Waterloo.  The official Offer of Admission will be mailed to you on June 3rd. Your package will include details about the offer, instructions for confirming your offer, and information about residence.

      Hands down, this has been the most fun, influential, crazy, insane, meaningful weekend ever.  Honestly, the last 72 hours have been mother fucking insane, and this very post will encapsulate all of it.  And as such, this post will probably be the longest in  urlLink dannydang.tk  history.   _____________    Day 1 (Friday):   I skipped school, as two posts below say, and then Aaron, Azim and Luke came over during the afternoon sometime, which is pretty damn good, we gambled for a bit, chilled for sometime and then we headed back to school.  At which point I had to go chauffer my mom around, which wasn't that bad but I didn't get to see much of anyone after that.  I headed to work like extremely early 'cause no one was at school around 3-ish ('cause of the long weekend) so I just hung out at work for a while before starting my shift.  Work was fun, we had like 50 Oshawa employees (A new Mandarin is opening is Oshawa, and since Brampton is the Mandarin HQ, we train all new employees here.)  So, I was just making fun of waiters fucking up and it was just a ball watching them mess up and not knowing prices for drinks among a whole shitload of things they didn't know.  "Uh, does anyone know how much a Strawberry Daiquiri costs?" - Waiter "Uh... uh... I think it's $6.40..." - other Waiter "No, you idiots, it's $5.90." - Danny "Are you sure?" - Waiter "I've worked here for a year now, do you think I'm sure?" - Danny "Point taken." - Waiter  After have a good laugh at the new employees, I got off work pretty early, met this guy name Juluis and Vivian(I think) they both went to Turner, a year ahead of me, and they're going to Waterloo(Urban Planning) and Queens (didn't ask), respectively.  I had some pretty good conversations with them, and after that, I was off work... called up my homeboys (Aaron, Luke and Steve) and headed over to Ruth's house.  When I got there, they were watching the utterly most ridiculous movie ever, it was like the women  urlLink from Murder She Wrote , staring in some Disney movie, where she's a wizard, and she uses magic and a magic bed, and everyone's British, but they call soccer, soccer, instead of football, which made no sense, and when she used her magic, it was like a mother fucking acid trip to the n'th degree.   urlLink It was honestly one big insane mother fucking huge ass acid trip mixed in with some LSD and a variety of other drugs.    We watched a bit of it, but got tired of it quickly and for some reason, all the white people, aside from Leslie, knew all the songs in it, and sang along, which was quite odd, like what the fuck, this ain't  urlLink My Fair Lady .  So anyway, after we got tired of that, we moved onto the famous McArthur trampoline, and chatted for a good hour or two, went back inside, because all the whities were freezing (ironic isn't it?), and then continued some chatting around her house, and then we all eventually left, as time passed really quickly, but before then, we were told there might be a party tomorrow.  Which there was. :)   _____________    Day 2 (Saturday):   I woke up really late, because my manager graciously let me off work this entire week, and I was essentially dancing around when he told me that, 'cause I was crazy ass excited.  On top of that, my manager told me there's apparently a $20 deal at Body Works for all Mandarin employees, but when I called them up it was $29.99 a month, but after some research, that's still a mother fucking insane deal, but I just want some clarfication so I'll wait until Tuesday to get all of that cleared up.   So, after I woke up around 1 PM -ish, I ate, called Body Works, took a nap, awoken by a phone call by Ruth, and she told me there was a party at her place and be there around 8ish.  So, it's like 5ish when she called, so I ate dinner, I think I might have done something before leaving, but all I remember from that afternoon was that on the way there, the radio said there was apparently torrential rains and a tornado warning, and before I got to Ruth's house, it was actually raining like it was torrential.  CURAZY!  But, when I got there, the rain let up, and I headed on in, where Neil (Ruths' brother) and his friends were already drinking and eating and etc... which was quite quaint at the time, and then I chilled with Ruth, Leslie and Lisa for a while.  They were already on their first drinks when I got there, and I really wanted to drink, but I was driving so I put that in the back of mind for a while.  More people came over eventually, as in Neil's friends, but of the important people, Gabe, Megan, and Azim arrived after I did.  Everyone hit up some drinks besides Azim and I as we both were driving, and we played Fictahs(sp?) for a while, but the alcohol started kicking in for Gabe and Ruth, so card games sorta died.  We just ended up playing Ultimatum ( I'm still sober at this point ) I had trouble choosing between Crystal and Veronica ( don't tell them this, but they're so damn similar! ).  Other people had easier picks:  ( Bold , means the winner) Azim -  Steph  vs Marissa.  Leslie - Sherman vs  Kalpesh  (Jokes!) Megan -  Wojtek Wolski  vs other hot Batallion Ruth -  Thai  vs Andrew   So, I think after this game, I was like fuck it, I'm drinking, 'cause Gabe was hammered at around this point, Ruth was a bit tipsy, Megan was feeling it, Lisa was gettin' there, Leslie was on her 2nd, and I was like blah, I need some god damn alcohol.  So, I got two beers, got those babies down in like 15 minutes, and was pretty much red-faced from there on out. It's like 10 o'clock now, and I think I just realised at this point, that I was suppose to drive Luke over here, and that just went out the window, and I felt bad, but then, I was like, there's no way I can hold out another 3 hours without alcohol, especially if it's so damn abundant.  ( Sorry Luke! )  Oh, before I drank, I called home, talked to my dad, and the conversation was like this:  "I'm going to sleep over, is that alright?" - Danny "Uh, yeah that's fine, what time you coming home tomorrow?" - Dad "Noonish." - Danny "Alright, have fun." - Dad  Coolest mother fucking dad ever.  So anyway, as I got drunk, we tried to play some card game called Apples to Apples, and that ended quickly, no one had the capacity to stay attentitive enough to play, so that died out, and then the party got more people.  At this point, Gabe needed to get home, but he was clearly uncapable of making it safely back to his house, especially on rollerblades!  So, we got him a ride home, and that was good, because if he went home on his rollerblades, he might have ended up in a ditch :p  At some point, Sarah's (Ruth's sister's) friends came over, uh the mentionables would be Andrew Piron (serrriiiooouusss!) and Nav.  Now, Andrew Piron, is one crazy mofo, he went flying down the stairs on like 5 separate occasions.  The first time, scared the living shit out of all of us, 'cause we're all down stairs chatting around and out of no where, this huge guy comes flying down the stairs head first, and we're all like "OH MY GOD HE'S GOING TO HIT THE CABINET!" but that didn't happen and the 2nd time, was with Gabe on his back, ahahah pure jokes, and the 3rd time, was with Gabe AND Nav on his back, and the time after was with me on his back, and that was pure jokes.  The last time was caught on video:   urlLink Take a look   Make sure you select the Media Player type and not the low one, otherwise, poor quality.   I'm on top of him and he goes down the stairs... CRAZY! As you might be able to tell from that short video, Ruth was out of her mind, and there's honestly, some of the funniest footage of her on her camera, go ask her about it sometime, I'm sure you'll have a very, very, good laugh.  'Cause I did, the morning after :p   At some point during the night, before 12 I think, I threw a pillow at Nav for saying something and it got deflected and it broke one of the family portrait's glass.  I was like Ohhh shieeet! But it wasn't that big of a deal, just need to replace a small piece of glass.  Now, later on in the night (12ish), we got slightly sobered up, and after about an hour or two of mingling with Sarah's and Neil's friends we went back to our own group and had some really really, deep conversations. I mean, fuck, it was honestly, the most open, most fucking, greatest thing ever, and not to go into too much detail, it was just one of the most quality times well spent and I think some of the deepest things were said at that point.  I mean, the alcohol probably influenced a lot of it, but shit, it was some crazy shit and I wouldn't trade that 2-3 hours of bonding for anything.  I learned a lot in that short time, and also shared a lot too, it was something of grand proportions.  I can't stress how important those couple of hours were, honestly, those hours go in as one of the most important moments in my life.  It was that crazy.  After that, everyone was getting tired, 'cause it's like 4 AM and we're all heading towards beds and what not, so that was the end of the night, I ended up sleeping in Ruth's lacrosse shorts, cause I wasn't planning to crash at her house, so I didn't bring anything to sleep in.  They fit perfectly well, and they were uber comfortable.   _____________    Day 3(Sunday):   Alright, I wake up at Ruth's at like 11:45, I stumble into Sarah's room, where all her friends are situated and Ruth too, as they all just woke up, and then Neil comes in the camera, we're all like hung over, I'm wearing women shorts, and it was just a lot of laughs had by all.  In all seriousness, there wasn't a single moment at Ruth's where I wasn't enjoying myself and having a blast, it was honestly the best night I've spent with any of my friends, not to say there weren't good nights(like this night following this, but there were just so many things, and everything happened together, and yeah, lot's of good stuff).  So, Neil cooked everyone breakfast, which was amazing, as I had a nice toasty bagel and some scrambled eggs (again thanks to Neil) and yeah, everyone ate breakfast, had a blast and we watched the footage that was recorded the entire night.  We came to the conclusion that:  1. Ruth was plastered out of her mind, and that she becomes very black when that happens. 2. Gabe was also hammered, and it was a good that Amanda drove him home. 3. Andrew Piron is a funny rapper. 4. Stair Surfing/Bobsleding/whatever/ is fucking hilarious 5. The morning after, is funny, oh Niel.  So, after we cleaned everything up, all the girls left, and then I proceeded to mess around with the video tape, upload some stuff, and then left.  As soon as I left, I got called by Luke, and I was like, I'm right by your house, so I'm coming over.  I got to Luke's house, picked him up, called up Aaron, headed over to his place, picked him up and came back to my house.  During that time, I needed to shower and brush my teeth, and the boys just chilled in my house.  After I got back down, we finished a couple of poker games, and then we watched this really sad music video, 'cause by chance, it got brought up, because we heard this remix of it, and yeah Aaron never saw it before, but every (fobby) asian knows about  urlLink this video .  As soon as Aaron was like oh my god, that's sad! Fucking two gunshots ring off in my backyard. I was holy fuck, and then in a split second, I was like, alright where the fuck is Riyaad and Azim.  I open the back door, no one's there, aside the impact mark on my window, and I go to the front door to find those wankers laughing their ass off.  I admit, it was funny, but holy shizzle, don't fire that shit  AT  my house.  Anyway, that led to Riyaad, Azim and Adeel over, where we ordered pizza and watched  urlLink Battle Royale .  After that, we were just mingling around, deciding what to do, we had fireworks, but needed a kickass plan.  At some point, Hannah called me, and I then left the room for like 30 minutes, which was a bad idea as the fuckers here, decided to make the "Confessions" post.  Gah, what bastards.  Anyway, I came back after a long chat, and then we called up Gabe and he was to come over.  And luckily he had a camera, and then we were all fucking set.  At first, we were kinda scared of what to do, but then it ended quickly as we did some crazy shit with Roman Candles.  First, we strapped Riyaad with a Roman Candle, and those got fired at everyone, yes we fucking fired them at each other.  Then I got strapped with one, and launched them, and narrowly hitting Azim twice, and Luke twice, and almost hit 3 people with one shot.  Uh Adeel was next, but he had poor aim, so there was nothing to talk about there.  The last one was with me, shooting Riyaad execution style.  Riyaad got pinned to a wall, I held the Roman Candle and just shot Riyaad in the back like 6 times, and then gave it to Gabe who shot him 3 or 4 times.  We even burned a couple of holes into his jacket.  Take a look:     So yeah, that was fucking crazy.  We headed back to my house, we calmed down a bit, ate some chips, uploaded the videos to my computer watched them, ate some food, and then pooled money again to get some more fireworks.  By this time, Greg calls us, and we're like "Come on over!" so now with all of us here, and freshly reloaded with more Roman Candles, we went nuts.  We all packed into Greg's car, and drove back to Fallingdale where we did, 3 man execution on Riyaad and I, then 2 man execution on Adeel. It was fucking insane, the videos of us are fucking hilarious, too bad I don't have the space nor the bandwith to post them quite yet, but we are working on it.  Here's us in the Jeep:    Us again. SeriOOOus. Snoop Dogg what.    Honestly, words cannot describe the amount of fireworks and fun we had, and soon as those videos hit the web, it will be crazy.  After doing that, we all came back to my house frantically, as we were scared that the police were coming as we heard sirens and Adeel was screaming like a girl the whole time, so that didn't help.  At that point people started heading home, we went to Timmies to close the night off and that's the end of my Greatest Weekend Ever.  Seriously, best weekend ever, I mean seriously, and thanks for reading this, this is like 6 pages in word btw.  I think it's near 2700 words.  Shit, again, thanks to everyone, and shit, best May 24. EVER. and it's not even Monday yet! well it is.. but it isn't!

       over the years i've come to realize that my perceptions have always been slightly tainted. I've always looked at people like Marq Aikman as weird and creepy as it may seem. I thought this feeling would dissapear, but instead of dissapearing it's flipped around.  I had four pages typed up, but it's too personal for here. You can read between the lines.    Next time I let the boys over at my house, I'm locking my computer up, because they tend to turn a little gay on me.  When I mean a little I mean too fucking much.

      I got Digital Cable today for some reason or another, apparently it's free, and since my house already subscribes to Cable internet, and has 2 cells phones on Roger's AT&T, I think my dad just might keep it after the first free 3 months, as long as it isn't too expensive.  We don't get MeTV for some reason, but we get like 300 other channels, which is kinda retarded.  My favourite channel so far would have to be IFC.  Independent Film Channel.  I just watched a part of Pulp Fiction, and the commercials advertise for movies that will be played later on in the week, and I just can't wait.  Also, I have a PVR (Personal Video Recorder) but I'm just going to call it my TiVo box from now on.  So I can say "Yo, I got that 24 episode on my TiVo." Anyway, yeah, I'm being uber boring again, just not in that much of a mood to make my life exciting again, life's dull... for me anyway.

      I stayed home today, and programmed a majority of the day, making this dumbass program called the  urlLink Game of Life .  Seriously, life's uber boring, and I'm slowly starting sink into a funk.  School's ending, people are going away, and it's of course, that time of the month again.  But in all honesty, I dunno, I'm really tired of doing a lot of things these days.  School sucks, people suck, and life's one big extravagant bore.  Video games have lost it's pinash (I can't believe I'm saying that) and there's absolutely nothing for me to do.  I tried to apply for OSAP today, but lacked a shitload of documentaiton, so I guess I'll do it another day. In the meantime, I've been trying to narrow universities down, but it's really too hard, each place has it's perks and I don't really want to let them go.  But whatever, I'm sure some divine insight will come to me in the next few days.  Oh, my brother came home from Montreal today, the only thing he bought on the trip was a lighter with two marajuana leafs on it, and when you open the lighter, the leaf lights up.  Pretty nifty.  He also supposedly was going to buy me a pair of pistol lighters, but was afraid of being caught and having it seized. Oh well, contraband is always good.     He told some crazy stories of how a bowling alley allowed more than 3 letters in the name.  What craziness I exclaimed, and then he remained adamant about such a crazy suggestion, and I continue to look at him funny.  He also got a little dark, which is weird, but whatever, a tan suits him nicely.  He told more whimsical tales of his misadventures later on, I think he said something about visiting McDonalds 10 times in 4 days, which by my account, quite the accomplishment.  And I think he later mentioned how he didn't sleep much....  Whatever.. :p  I finally watched an episode of Joan of Arc or whatever, and I liked it.  It reminds me of Gilmore Girls (minus the humour) mashed in with Touched by an Angel.  Oh, how life is so boring these days.

      Sometimes you just know in your gut, there's something there, and you no for sure, it is there.  But for some reason you chose to deny it's existence, you chose to not accept it, you chose to close your eyes when you see it, plug your ears when you hear it and refrain from breathing when you smell it.  That's what I've been doing.   Living a lie .  I hope tomorrow, I'll be okay.

      Counting like 1400 votes is honestly the most tedious and arduous process ever.  That's what I spent my entire day doing, that.  That one little thing.  Just in case anyone skipped 5th or something... the results are:  President - Hamreen Singh Vice - Rachel Karmally Tres - Mona Vaid Secret - Navdeep Sandhu Comm - Ranjeev Activities - Jaclynn LaFaso Jr. Rep - Rajat Sabrahawl or whatever.. (Atul's Brother)  Oh, and CRAZINESS TODAY.  At Bramalea City Centre, me and Black Ruth were witnesses to a car accident!  Some crazy white lady pulled out of the parking lot and smacked some old lady's truck.  She basically knocked her side door into the car and jammed it shut.  It was ridiculous, HOW CAN YOU NOT SEE THE TRUCK?!  Anyway, we gave our names and phone numbers, and what not, and mall security was called in, and honestly, it was extremely exciting.  Luckily, no one was hurt, and the dumb white lady offered to pay for all the damages and yeah, I don't think we're really needed to be witnesses, but whatever, I wanna TESTIFY.  I can just imagine it now: ...Do you swear to say the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?...  Anyway, yeah, today, CRAZY. Tomorrow, CRAZY.  CURAZY UP THE YING YANG!

       J-Kwon - Tipsy   Teen drinking is very bad.  Yo I got a fake id though.  Yeeah, yeeah, yeeah, yo, two step with me, two step with me.   1, here comes the 2 to the 3 to the 4,  Everybody drunk out on the dance floor...   Now everybody in da club gettin  tipsy ..  everybody in da club gettin  tipsy ...   _________   I swear I must have sang "Now everybody in da club  tipsy " about 94 times the entire weekend... but let's scroll back to get a nice chronological account of events.  I woke up at 7:30 AM, Friday morning, with only about 5 hours of sleep as I went to bed the previous night around 2-ish.  I then proceeded to school without breakfast as I was running late, as I was suppose to be at school early for the SAC election speeches.  I showed up late, and really didn't care, as I was half-dead and falling asleep by just standing.  The speeches ran their course, and most of them weren't too exciting, as everyone's speeches had some good jokes here and there, but didn't present it to that of "Danny Dang calibre" or "Uday calibre".  I mean, some of the speeches were good, but the candidates didn't present them with the charisma or confidence that would make the speeches much more effective.    Moral #1:  It's all about how you present things, not the content.   __   Okay, so later in the day I went out to Giggling Tomatoes for lunch with everyone, and the funny part was how Luke couldn't finish his food, as he got really sick, from who knows what (it was certainly not the food, as I ate it).  Uh, after that, I was in a state of panic, as I realised that I didn't have directions to Veronica/Crystal's house. (I actually realised it the previous night, but it was far too late to call anyone.)  I called a shat load of people, where none of them knew what's what and then picked up some liquor and headed off home.  Then had like a 1 hour conversation with Hannah, got my parents pissed off for some reason, and then changed and got myself to look mad pimping.  Moral #2:  Don't let good food go to waste.   __   Went to the Daniels' house, met the Daniels and made small talk.  Boy was that whole thing really forced... I mean, they made a lot of assumptions, most of them were wrong, but I just nodded and kept smiling.  Sometimes I question whether or not people look at me differently when they find out I'm going out with Hannah...maybe I'm just delusional.    I met Crystal and Veronica's boyfriend's though, Chris and Lee respectively.  More on Lee later, but Chris is a fairly nice guy, from what I could see, and the same could be said about Lee.  The funny part was when Lee's car broke down at the convienent store just around the corner from the Daniels' house and he had to walk over with tux and toothpaste in hand.  Eventually, everyone arrived and we took a huge amount of pictures and then we finally were able to mosy over to La Perla in our classy limo, courtesy of the Daniels' mom's boss.  Moral #3:  When you don't know what's going on, just smile and nod.    __   Everyone at prom was looking extremely hot and there were a lot of people I didn't know, but I have to say everyone was looking very snazzy and eloquent.  Mingling and seeing everyone in their suits, tuxes, and dresses was pretty interesting, and people's hair was curazy.  Even at La Perla, there was even more picture taking and holy crap, where there a lot of people.  There were h'ourderves (deep fried zucchini, brocolli, and chicken) and these non-alcohol cocktails that tasted like snow cones.  It was very well... formal. :D  As the night continued food was served, even more picture taking occured, I'm sure I'll be able to show some of them as soon as I get those babies developed but until then, I'm sure some pictures are already circulating around.  A thing about the food though... the chicken was honest to god, so not chicken.  The vegertarian entree was way better than that chicken.  Seriously, it was bland, and it tasted like it was freshly defrosted and some cream was smeared on top for flavouring.  Anyway, everything else was cool though, aside from the formal gift, which was a gold wire frame picture frame.  I'm sure it looked a lot better in those magazines then in reality, so I can't really complain about that.  Then there was the dancing, grinding, surpisingly very little bangrha, and a good time had by all.  And in all dances, the ever so popular YMCA song to cap off the night.  I have to say that was a very fun night.  Around midnight, the Collingwood people left to get there at some reasonable hour.  Moral #4:  You can dance if you want to, you can leave you friends behind.  And if your friends can't dance, then they're no friends of mine.   __   We (Hannah, Jenna, Josh, Saleem and I) got to Collingwood around 3 AM in the morning, and I'm really glad Mr. Fransen drove us up, 'cause we got lost in the dark along the way and on top of that we were all tired like no one's business.  When we got there, people were unpacking, claiming rooms and what not and we got unpacked, and people slowly crept into drinking.  Everyone was dead tired, aside from a few who were drinking a lot, and that kept everyone else up. We must have played euchre like 3 or 4 times, and then started getting the drink on.  It was very mellow the first night, well, actually it wasn't, but there was no dancing the first night, but people were just being ass loud and drunk.  Around like 5 AM, a bunch of us tried to sleep, but that didn't really happen, just ended up being up all night, and spent some good hours in bed ( *cough *cough, nothing, really. )    When we got out of bed, we had breakfast, feeling like ass, and basically watched drunk people do stupid stuff for the next couple of hours.  I'll leave the stories to be told through mouth, as although they were funny as hell, they really aren't meant to be posted on this. So yeah, the Saturday was filled with crazy shit, as half of us, went onto the beach and went into the frigid Georgian Bay.  Oh god, I have to say, my boys were really feeling it after that, or rather,  WEREN'T .  It was fun though... the things you do for fun..  After the beach, we went back to the cabin, got liquored up again, and starting making dinner.  After dinner I passed out on the couch (I think it was sleep, but I really don't see how I could have slept through loud, blaring music, and people dancing), so I missed out on 3 hours of partying had by all.  A couple of other people passed out also, and yeah. Like Lee for example, he almost went through a two-four in one day.  He had 7 beers left in his case, so we think he had 17 drinks, because he brought his own cooler and sealed that baby up. Oh before I passed out, we saw these crazy ass white kids pull out of their cabin in this Civic, piss drunk and it was swirving up the road.  Crazy white people!  Uh, when I woke up, oh man, funny stuff.  People got even more drunk, some dancing occured, and the white people from other cabins started firing fireworks at our cabin.  Naturally, we called the cops, but they were already on their way, and they didn't do much aside from breaking up the crowd, as there was over 50 kids standing outside doing crazy shit.  Uh, yeah we tried to crash afterwards, but like the night before we just ended up talking and cuddling for hell of a long time.    Moral #5:  Don't drink and drive.   __   Sunday was nonchalant, lots of cleaning and packing, so not much to talk about.  There are way more stories, that I've left out, just 'cause.  But, really, it was honestly the craziest weekend ever, next to the crazy-ass May 24 weekend.  Man, weekends are just CRAZY!  But here's the best joke of the entire weekend:  White Guy on Balcony: (some insult about Richard's parents) Richard: My parents are dead. White Guy: Your parents are black? Richard: No, my parents are dead. White Guy: Better dead than black.

      Time's passing pretty quickly, like today, woke up, went to physics, ate breakfast, went home, ended up falling asleep and being unproductive, woke up, drove my mom to work and here I am.  Someone messaged me with "come to teh athletic banquet!" and as such, I'm going to.  It's nice to know someone wants me somewhere.  Oh today, I smacked my car onto a metal fence, not too much damage, just a light scratch to the front fender, I thought I had at least another 3 inches of room, but I guess I misjudged that when my car suddenly jolted.  Meh, whatever, here's the accumulated damage to my car done by me over the past 6 months:  - Scratch on the front fender - Many stratches on the right underside of the car - Scrapped the underside of the car under the hood  And here's the damage that happened for unknown reasons:  - denting of the doors (I'm guessing people slammed their car doors into my car)[The school parking lot is gay like that] - scratching of my doors (same reason)

      Well, it kinda feels like a new chapter in the life of Danny is beginning, and I'm kinda glad, and a little sad.  I'm slowly drifting away from school... (literally...) and trying to come to grips with the fact that I won't be seeing the lot of you come 3 months from now, and for some of you, in about 3 weeks.  Sad part is, although you'll never hear me say it, I'll probably miss a lot of you more than you think I would.  But in any case, it's time for a new template... I think I'm just going to steal one I really like and re-vamp it a little.  I'm thinking a little more colour than before... when I did this one, I was feeling pretty dark and mysterious, but now I feel more free and colourful.    Other things I've been meaning to do:  Buy an mp3 player. Get a new wardrobe. (My clothes are so faded. I've worn the same pants for 4 years :D)  I can't believe school is over in in 8 days. (for me anyway). Oh my.  It's coming to a end! Oi Oi OI!  You know what I could really use, is a huge ass game of truth or dare.  I haven't played that game since like grade 8, but shit, I remember learning so many things about other people that I wouldn't have known otherwise.  It was always fun for me, because I really had nothing to hide, and probably never will.  Could use a good dose of truth right about now.  Well, I watched Frailty today and an Evening with Kevin Smith.  Let's just start off with Frailty:  It was a sub-par movie, the plot twist near the end didn't really add to the movie that much, I mean, the movie was alright, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't very good either, I was sure Matthew McConahey(sp?) could have been much cooler if he wanted to.  Meh, sub-par movie for a sub-par day... it would have been cooler if the victims morphed into demons and then those guys grew angel wings and started whooping each other's asses.  Wish I could see people's sins, would be cool if I could just smote people left and right.    "The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he, who in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know my name is the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon thee. "   And then I'd smote the mother fucker. (Gotta love quoting movies, who quote from the bible)  An Evening with Kevin Smith, however, is the funniest shit I've seen in a while, it was ass long though, the thing must have been 3 hours long, but holy crap, I couldn't stop listening to the funny mother fucker that he is and all the jokes he made, not to mention his hilarious stories.  Man, I love my TiVo!  I'm also programming this game for Comp Sci, it's coming along, but will I be done for Wednesday? (laugh!) Maybe, if I skip the next two days, I  might  finish it...  I think this will be the first time that I'll ever hand in something incomplete, and for the first time ever, I'm actually not panicking or getting anxious, which is nice.  Really nice.   I also filled out a lot of my forms, just need a $500 cheque from my dad and some stamps (I'll probably end up express posting it to be sure), and I'm off, probably send it off on Wednesday or something... aye.. yay to Waterloo & Laurier!

      Orignally I thought the line was: Come back baby.  But apparently it's not.  Whatever, a good song nonetheless.  I still have to download the rest of hte album, but for the first 5 songs, it's pretty good so far.  I've watched like 4 movies this weekend, my god, just now I just watched Finder's Fee, instead of working on my physics lab, physics questions or doing my computer science project.  Kinda sad.  Oh well...

      Well, I've decided that I'm going to do the Math and Business program at Waterloo and Laurier.  It's funny, well not really funny, more or less amusing, that I thought I was going to be an engineer over the past year, but over this weekend I finally realized that it wasn't for me.  There's a whole lot of reasons, but first off, I'd like to point out, in the past year of high school, I've never opened my textbook unless I had something due or something to study for.  The lack of work ethic and study habits on my part will probably continue with me for the rest of my life, so really, I can't see my self possibly changing drastically enough to prepare for Engineering first year.  There's also other reasons, like free money, it's co-op too, plus 2 degrees, which is also cool, the light work-load ya dee yadee...  but in any case, I've finally decided, and it's a relief.  My TiVo is really cool, I recorded  urlLink Frailty  today, I hope to watch it maybe tomorrow or something, when I have the time.  Woo Digital Cable! and there's also a Mega Man cartoon series which is also very cool.  _____   I spent all of today at a sort of family re-union thing at Bluffers Park.  I drove on the 401 for the first time, and my dad explained to me how the Expressway and Collector works, which makes a whole lot of sense, and for driving down to Scarborough, I sure did it hella fast, 'cause I got to the Lake in like 30 minutes (gotta love speeding!).  So anyway, my cousins/uncle/aunt came over from France like a week ago and are staying with family for the next 2 weeks so it was one of those meet and greet things, where I re-met family that I've seen or spoken to a couple years ago and haven't seen since.  They all noticed how much I've grown and then proceeded to talk about my scholastic career as if I wasn't there.  I really hate praise, I hate being told that I did a good job by people who have no idea of what I'm doing.  I mean, I'd appreciate it if I was working with someone and they gave me a handshake or something, but I really don't like it, when people say you're doing good, when they have absolutely no clue of what you've done.  It's so empty, it lacks substance.  Another thing, my family is also filled with a bunch of weirdos and quacks, not one of them are socially apt in any way.  My dad tends to take over conversations within an instant and it's the saddest sight that I could see.  To stereotype, my dad is like one of those macho-bravado kind of guys who brags about this and that, and stretches the truth so far from reality that by the time you hear the story, it won't be like anything that actually happened.  You know the type, the type of person who re-tells a somewhat amusing story and makes it some sort of epic short-story that will have you at the edge of your seat and kinda wondering if it actually did happen like that.  But for those who don't know the truth, they usually accept it as he tells the stories so damn well.  There's one or two normal families, but the rest are just a bunch of losers (Engineers, Programmers), who stand there and afraid of just general conversation, I mean holy crap, it's the most fucked up shit I've ever seen my whole life, and I will never want to be like that.  Some sort of timid fuck who can't even stand up for himself among relatives, like shit, my dad somehow turned around the fact he'll be jobless and ended up making fun of other people, how fucked up is that?    I met some cool kid though, he's probably like a second cousin twice removed, but his name is Kyle and we played soccer, cards and skipped some rocks.  I ended up buying him some ice-cream, and I hope he had a fun time.  Well, that's my day, woke up, drove to Bluffers Park, watched the saddest group of individuals come together (with the exception of a few) and basically wasted 6 hours with them.  That's not to say, I didn't learn anything.. because I did, I learned that some other cousin of mine had like facial reconstructive surgery out of the blue, and she's no longer recognizable (from what she looked like before).  Out of the fucking blue!

      Sorry, I couldn't come to Wonderland with you.  Worked today and yesterday, made money.  That's about it.

      Today has been eh.  Not much to talk about, like usual, I mean, what is there to talk about?  It's not like I go on adventures every day, and do something entertaining or amazing.  It just feels like another day has past, and not even in a bad way.  I spent today mostly in front of a TV or in front of playing cards.  It's not even something that I would be upset about, I watched some new show, called Tru Calling, with the girl that use to play "Faith" from Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and the show is pretty alright.  It's like a mix of Crossing Jordan/Touch by an Angel/and that show where that angel guy takes people into the future/past.  Basically, the show is about, "Faith", whos name is Tru in the show, I think, and she has this uncanny ability to re-live days until she sets the future straight.  I.E. save people.  So whatever.  Also, today, I found a  loop-hole  in the Wendy's ordering scheme. Okay, the Double Patty Burger is 5.99, and the Classic Single is 3.99.  You can add a patty onto your classic single for 1.10.  Thus saving yourself 90 cents.  Fucking ridiculous!  I was like, oh my god, I found a fucking loophole!  Genius!  Yeah, so if you ever order the double whatever it's called, don't, just get a single and add a patty!  GENIUS!  Another thing, this is a complete secret...  On Canada Day, at the Mandarin... the meal is  absolutely free .  I'm not kidding you.  The meal will be free, at all Mandarin locations.  Is this a joke? No it isn't.  Unfortunately, you can't book reservations for that day, so whatever.  An extra tid-bit, is that non-alcholic drinks are also included.  That means, absolutely free.  (Except for tax, maybe..)  But in anycase, the meal will be free, and this is a one day offer only.  So you'll probably will have to wait in line, for a long, long time, unless you get their at like 9 in the morning and camp out for two hours, or even more, depending on how many people show up.  The reason why our management is so crazy?  Well, it's Mandarin's 25th Anniversary, and they did this once before too, I think 6 years ago, and it went over fairly well.  So whatever.  Come if you want to be fed for free.  But keep it a secret :)

      I can't believe it.  I can't understand it... I'm finished.. holy crappers.  I'm so bored now and I'm also so sleepy.  Oi vhey.  I wrote my CS exam in a freezing cold room, with Ms. Ferris as our supervisor.  The best part is that she would say "blah blah minutes left" in like a cliched, thundering voice which made it funny.  Other than that, I faired pretty well on the exam, and afterwards just hung around for a while.  A little poker teaching here, a little crazy 8 countdown there, and then some Timmies/Wendies afterwards.  At some point later, I drove to Heartland Town Center to check out prices for MP3 players, and i'm debating whether or not I should get a harddrive MP3 player, or a flash player.  Meh, whatever, so many options, makes a pain to chose.  I then wandered around the store for a while and bought another headset and Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels.  Lock Stock was on sale, I think it was 15 dollars, and the headset, I needed for my other computer.  Since last year, between my brother and me, we've went through 3 sets of headsets already.  I mostly blame my brother, when I wake up and sit down, I find my headset no longer working, for whatever the reason.  Meh.  Sooo Sleepy....

      Not much to say today, woke up late in the afternoon, played some poker, drove around, ate dinner fell asleep, and here I am.  I have my computer science exam tomorrow, and low and behold, I haven't studied a single bit.  Not only can I fail and still attain the credit, I don't even need it!  I have an extra credit with computer science so meh.  Probably going to do some light studying later on and see how far that gets me.  I'm planning on buying  urlLink this  in the next couple of days:     It looks nice, it's expandable, it's a flash player, and for $250, it's a pretty sweet deal.    Uh, I updated the links again, rearranged them, in the order I read blogs.  Mainly because of updates, if you update, I read it more.  Also added some new blogs, the one's below the line are people I don't know, but they make interesting posts so it's interesting to read them :D  What else, oh, Vince, has a  urlLink website , he asked me to get people to join his forums, so here's my attempt:  Join Vince's Forums, they're pretty cool, a lot of SQL, PHP, PHBB shizzle going on, and it's running off his home computer, so whatever.  Take a look around.  He said that it would be a good way for people in Turner to keep in touch with one another... meh

      Anna in Kung Fu Land   - Asian movies, especially, anything that has to do with comedy/romance/fighting, always always always suck.  I mean, HK comedy/romance films are really funny, but when you try to stick in a third genre, it's like putting banana's in a pecan pie.  It just doesn't flow.  So anyway, a bad movie, bad acting, but for some reason it was funny.    Empire Records  -Pretty good movie, although I missed the beginning, when I saw Liv Tyler, or whatever, all I could see her doing was talking Elvish and smoting some evil goblins or something.  Meh :/  The Pianist  -Felt sorry for that German Captain/Sergeant guy at the end.  I don't know what I'm suppose to say, it was a good movie, excellent acting, and I want to learn how to play the piano now.  That's like 6 hours of time I spent not studying... aye -_-

      I was ass tired when I woke up, just like any other day, mosey-ed my way to school and waltzed into class a tad late, but whatever...  Mrs. Regular got us cookies I think and everyone seemed to be having a jolly time with their miscellaneous conversations and such.  I think Tudor and I talked about Kill Bill cause I had the DVD in my hand, so we were talking about the similarities between Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill and Resevoir Dogs.  Keep in mind, I own Resvoir Dogs, but I haven't watched it yet(laziness).  So anyway, I bullshitted to keep the conversation going and Tudor thinking he was a genuius, led the conversation and it occurred to me at that moment that I won't be having bullshit conversations with a majority of you ever again.  Made me kinda glum for the rest of the day, but I ended up enjoying it as if it were any other day.  Mrs. Regular asked me at some point if I was absent for the past 3 days because of stress, and I answered "partly." Because, in honest truth, I haven't been sleeping well for the past 2 weeks, but it's a combination of a lot of things, and to just call it "stress" is a little unfair.  But whatever, I kinda answered in the voice that meant "yes, it's stress, but I'm not going to say it is, because that's stupid."  So I hope she got the answer that she was looking for.  I then went to the arcade after that, played some DDR, Time Crisis, and Daytona or Nascar or something, I made a good running on the last 2 laps, nearly capturing first, but I didn't drift properly in the last turn and that cost me the game.  But whatever, the important thing was, I spent some times with friends that I haven't been spending time with lately, which was good.  Fun and Fun.  Afterwards, I went to Comp Sci.  Gorski taught some stuff, I learned, and that was good.  She also advised that I should take CS 134 and save 500 dollars. Which I thought was nice, and so I listened and signed up for CS 134 at Loo.  I dunno, later on in the day, not much other stuff happened, I drove Greg home and then we talked about how the last day of school seemed so nonchalant.  It wasn't even special, I felt sad at times, but I didn't tear up like I think I would, I didn't splurt out something random or anything.  Truth be told, I guess I drifted away from a lot of people or them away from me, because I dunno.. that's it, it just felt like I wasn't losing much.  I felt, kinda glad, kinda relieved, and kinda sad, but in all, I think I'm going to see some of you again, so at least there's some hope in that... maybe...  I dunno, me rambling again....probably because it hasn't kicked in yet.  I'm getting a few jabs in, but definitely no kicks.  So anyway, I watched Adaptaion, good movie.

      I guess today finally encapsulated the end.  The end of highschool.  Massive yearbook signage ensued.  I'm disappointed that I didn't get Gorski and Regular to sign my yearbook, I've honestly got to know these two teachers over the past months, and they're really really cool.  Not just cool, but they're extremely good teachers.  They have personality (*cough Crawford), and are just really good people.  I'm glad I had them.  I'm also kinda sad that I slacked off a lot in the end, particularly in Computer Science, but Gorski kinda understood that I didn't really need the mark anymore, and she kinda laughed it off.  Heh.  I should have stayed around a bit longer, and got some more people to sign my yearbook.  I didn't get any of the Grade 11s I know to sign my yearbook, and I'm missing a lot of people.  But no matter, they weren't too close of friends anyway.  Only,  RIYAAD  hasn't signed my book yet out of close friends.  And Aaron too and Greg... there's a whole bunch of people that still haven't signed mine yet.. ARGH! YEE MATEY!  Riyaad, You fucking bastard guy.  I fucking told you to sign it, and it just happened to pass by.  If you read what I wrote in yours, before signing mine, I'll kill you.  I'll kill you with a knife.  Oh and I haven't signed some peoples. I.E. Roanna's and whoever elses that didn't get passed to me in that ridiculous 4 hour hallway session of pen scribbling.  Meh, it's been good.  I'll desperately try to stay in touch.   ___    25. Pumpkin   A dark satire.  Pretty good, I liked it, the plot is unconventional, and the story is a little drawn out and reaching, but it's good nonetheless.  The only problem I had was that sometimes I couldn't tell when they were being serious or were joking.   26. How to Deal   If Mandy Moore wasn't so hot, I really wouldn't watch this.  I really liked her messy hair in the beginning of the movie for some reason.  Other than that, oh did the movie ever suck.   27. Freaky Friday  I really though this would suck.  But the acting was actually good enough to make it work.  The plot was pretty good.  And doesn't that woman look like Aaron's mom?  Seriously... doesn't it?  Oh and making fun of asians is always funny to me.   28. Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story  Fucking hilarious.  Honestly best fucking comedy ever.  Okay not ever.  But this was WAY funny.  Comparable to Old School.  Maybe even funnier.  Honestly.  Thank You Chuck Norris.

      Everyday I wake up.  Everyday I brush my teeth.  Somedays I eat breakfast.   For instance, today, I ate some asian thing called "..." I don't know the name anymore, it's like some sticky rice wrapped in some green asian leaf.  It has a little bit of meat inside and it's steamed.  I really don't care anymore.  My mom made it, and it tasted good.  Other days, I don't eat, and starve a little.  Most days I sit around my house playing Counter-Strike or Warcraft 3.  Usually on the Gameline.ca servers.  Somedays I go out, and eat lunch with friends.  Like today I went to Sonny's.  Or play poker with friends.  For the past 3 weeks, a lot of poker has occured.  Almost everyday.  After that, I drive my mom to work exactly at 3.  Soon after, I go back to either poker or video games.  Sometimes I go to Body Works.  After that I go to Aaron's most of the time, and do something, in most cases, it involves poker.  If I'm not at home around 6, my dad will surely call me on my cell phone.  I short conversation will occur, usually with me telling him that I'll be home later.  He'll say "okay." or mumble something in agreeance and hang up.  Then I would continue with whatever.  With that, I usually don't come home until much later, as I either go out to eat, or play some card game/gamble/video game/or some other activity.  At 11:45, I usually leave whatever I'm doing, and go pick up my mom from work.  Then head home. On the drive home, I usually get some lecture from my mom about whatever... and usually this ends up with me arguing with her.  For instance, yesterday, she basically said I don't know what I'm getting into by going to Woodbine, I promptly said "Shut the fuck up.  You don't know shit."  She then shut up, and we argued some more afterwards.  Today we argued about how I'm so forgetful, and that it's entirely my fault for not being organized enough to quickly find things when in need of them.  This somehow started, from when I asked her "Do you know where that green hub is?" She then got into a lecture, we then argued, and then I told her to fuck off at some point.  I think on Tuesday we argued about my driving skills.  I really don't like backseat driving.  She constantly tells me I'm driving too fast.  After the 2nd warning of me telling her to stop talking about my driving.  I told her, to shut the fuck up, or get out of the car.    As you can see, me and my mom have a working relationship.  She lectures, I tell her to fuck off and we rinse and repeat every single day.  You might think, I use lighter words, or maybe talk to my mom in a more proper tone.  I don't, not recently anyway, not for the past 6 months.  She told me today that I was stressed, that I curse way more than I use to, and that it's unhealthy.  I wonder why mom.  I wonder fucking why.  I could tell her.  I could tell her what's bothering me.  It would probably crush her heart and smash it much like a broken mirror.  I really can't live in this house much longer.  I'm glad I'm getting away.  I'm glad.

      Yesterday I went to my brother's graduation at Mayfield (he goes to Earnscliffe), and there were way too many people there for that tiny auditorium.  Seriously, 317 graduates, plus 2 parents per graduate plus the two dozen teachers, oh man, ridiculous.  But anycase, it was one of those boring moments in life, where you try to be reflective and what not, but yet, it really doesn't happen.  The speakers sucked, aside from one, the current principal, who made a fairly good speech.  But the other 3 or so people, my god, their speeches sucked.  The co-valedictorian speech was boring and uninspired, yes, I said co-valedictorian, two people got it, and the speech was in English and French for some odd reason.  Meh.  Also saw the Ma, he's moving to some other school next year... meh  What else, uh, my brother won the Math Award (*cough) and black people are very very very rowdy.  I always thought it was TV or drugs or something, but no, it's their parents.  These people's parents are also very obnoxious and stupid.  The MC clearly stated, to clap and cheer after all the names were called up, but these idiots don't listen.  Rules don't apply to them. Blah!  After that, went to Woodbine... omg.. I was honestly >   Then, to TJ's for wings.  gotta love those wings!  Then watched:   23. Drumline  I actually liked this movie, I dunno, it was very unique.   24. T3: The Rise of the Machines  I knew the acting was horrible in the 2nd one, and boy did this one suck too.  The action scenes weren't even that great, and T-X was no T-1000 who was much cooler.

      Oi, another 13 hours shift.  Jesus, my eyes are so burning right now, and all I have to show for it is coloured paper.  Blah.  :p  The downside to all this, is that my calves are killing me, I have a blister on my right index finger from burning myself on the grill and my right index finger is also swollen for carving Prime Rib for fucking 13 hours straight.  My manager was even crazy enough to tell me I only had a 15 minute break throughout the entire 13 hours. (yeah, suck my cock bitch.)  Father's Day, is one busy day at the Mandarin, like seriously, some people just don't know when to stop eating.  The only thing that makes my day go by faster at the Mandarin is the scadly dressed girls that come by... oh scadly dressed girls, how I love thee summer.  On a side note, watched  22. Battle of Shaker Heights ... for the Project Greenlight film, it was pretty good considering the script was from a complete amateur.  But the whole movie lacked emotion, I mean it was hard to connect with any of the characters and on top of that, it was hard to understand the motives of any person.  Seriously, everyone just forgave everyone else in the end.  Or not (*cough) and I dunno, the story was good, there were some good lines here and there, but there was no pinash.  Oh I want some pinash right about now.

       29. Owning Mahowny  Crazy gambling movie.  Based on a true story, racks up a $10 million dollar debt.  Insane!   30. Shallow Hal  Meh, I liked how Gwyneth Paltrow learned to waddle like a fat lady.   31. Ringu  Omg, fucking scary.   32. The Ring  Total rip off of The Ringu.  The credits that give credit to the book and the original movie is like 2 minutes later.  Fucking the scenes were stolen shot for shot and the whole horse thing, and change of story, complete gayness, the original movie was better, and scarier.   33. Spiderman-2  Oh the elevator scene. :D   34. The Last Casino  I love this movie, I love it. It's Canadian too.  Oh my, it's up there on my list now.   35. Bollywood/Hollywood  Meh, interesting movie, although it seemed kinda short :p   I've been sick this entire week, trying to do stuff, feeling woozy and like death most of the time.  I dunno, and today, I though it would be best if I just laid on my couch for a long time.  Oh sweet sweet couch.

      I've said "For Reals" like every other phrase for the past 3 days, and it's starting loose it's cachet.  Man, I wish I could stop.  For reals.  Anyway, Yesterday (Being Saturday) was honestly the worst day ever.  I woke up with a splitting headache, and I had to work that day, so you know, I kinda attemped to eat some food in the morning (I felt like throwing up the whole time) but I ate some bland chinese thing (Congee), and tried to muscle my way to work.  I got there with no problems, moseyed my way in and tried to work.  I felt dizzy the entire time, trying to look happy and talk to customers, my god, that was so difficult, after about 3 hours, I was like, fuck, I need aspirin, and one of the waiters, Vanessa, hooked me up with two pills.  I swallowed those babies down and I really didn't fell anything for a while, in fact, I felt worse.    So luckily, my gracious manager, Nelson, let me off ridiculously early, at like 1:30 (my shift regulary ends at like 3) and I just kinda passed out in my car.  Let me tell you, I was wearing a fucking hoodie, and it was sunny on saturday.  I fell alseep for a good hour and a half, when I woke up, I was soaking in my own fucking sweat.  It was horrible.  Like, I swear to god, it felt like I was in a sauna or some shit.  I was dripping all over my car, there was sweat everywhere.  I did feel better afterwards though, probably because I self-induced a fever by doing that, and/or the aspirin kicked in.  So I go back to work, eat some other bland chinese food, just to avoid throwing up, and start doing my job.  It's going pretty well, but I'm sweating like crazy, moreso than usual, probably because I had a semi-fever going and I was working in a really really hot place (the grill) and shit, I was honestly going to die and gag. I get through most of the shift, until I have to clean the vents using this extra super duper strength degreaser right.  I sprayed some of it, I think I must have inhaled some of it, because, I was careless and retarded, during my semi-dead phase, so as soon as I did that, my nose started bleeding profusively.  People, with normal nose bleeds right, they drip or dabble or whatever right... but me, it was fucking gushing out kind of shit, it was flowing blood.  I was holy fuck, so I basically huddle over a sink for about 20 minutes, with a tissues, and still to no avail.  Then a mother fucking parent jamboree arrives.  You see, when you work in a restaurant, and you work with people that are all parents, they tend to "care" for you, and "know what's best for you" and so I got about 20 mother fucking different opinions on how I could stop the bleeding.  Some people were telling me to tilt my head back, put pressure on my arteries, ice it, rinse it with cold water, but I knew how to do it.  That is, Lean foward, and squeeze your nose.  That's the only way to do it.  If you put your head back, you'll be choking on your own blood and that's not a good thing.  So I'm fuckign pissed off, bleeding out, and my co-workers have to work without me, which pisses me off, 'cause I'm letting them down.  Being the youngest worker there, there's a lot of pressure on me, I have to work twice as hard, twice as fast, and much better than everyone else, just because I'm younger.  So anyway, I'm fucking bleeding like a school girl on her first period, and it doesn't stop for a good 45 minutes to an hour.  For god sakes, I had blood all over me, it was on my uniform, my arms, my hands, my face, everywhere.  Re-fucking-diculous.  My mananger lets me off early, because I couldn't finish the shift, with a bloody nose and shit.  So I head over to Ruth's looking like a mess (no one saw me though, except Roanna and Andrew).  I cleaned myself up before heading into the main room, but before that, I honestly looked like I just got out of a bar fight or something.  Jesus.  So, partied down, drunkiness is always good, I really like to drink, I wish I could have that night, but nah.  Poor Leslie.  That's all I got.  And praise the lord that I'm not working on Canada's Day.  WOhooo!  Edit:  HOLY FUCK.  THe whole time when I was bleeding, I was I hoping aspirin isn't a blood thinner. I hope to god. I hope to god. I hope to god.  I just fucking googled it. IT IS. IT'S A MOTHER FUCING ANTICOUGALANT.  I COULD HAVE FUCKING DIED FROM A NOSE BLEED.

      I saw Alyssa today.  She had the coolest hair ever.  Like dreads, but not really, I think she called them shreds, but I'm hard of hearing most of the time.  Meh.  She said something about twisting and tweezing or something.  I dunno, it's the fucking coolest hair I've ever seen in a while.  Fucking TOO COOL.  Oh and she was wearing a a tank top that said "Tree Hugger", I thought it was funny, and suited her well.  Meh, I dunno more on this later.  There you go Adeel.    I have to work tomorrow.  I probably won't update for a while.  There's more, but I need to sleep right now, or I'll die tomorrow.  Oh I dominated the world again, and co-dominated it with Alex and Aaron.  Fun times.  Fun times indeed.  I think I have a winning record of like 4-1.  The game of global domination!

      So today, a pretty good day, in fact, a pretty fun day.  I visited John Rhodes, ate 6 dollar pizza, conquered the world, watch King Arthur and his knights, drool over Keira Knightley and had a meatball sandwich.  If that's not a good fucking day, I don't know what is.  The downside of this day, was JP didn't pass his test unfortunately, meh, we'll go again next week or something, and steve scared the living shit out of me because I left my $250 mp3 player in his mail box today, because he had to return it, 'cause I couldn't get the drivers to install, I tried to, XP wouldn't recognize it, then I tried to manually install it, and it kept giving me this bull shit that the driver didn't fit the device and wouldn't let me install it.  Fucking thing.  Anyway, I left it in the mail box, and we had a convo earlier and it went like this:    Danny: Did you get the mp3 player in the mail? Steve: No, when did you leave it? Danny: At like 4PM, no one was home. Steve: Yeah, no one was home. Danny: I tried knocking, so then I put it in the mail like you said. Steve: Sorry guy, I don't have it. Danny: Are you sure? A big yellow Best Buy Bag? Steve: Nah, not here. Steve: relax, j/k. Danny: Hold on a sec, I gotta change my pants. Steve: hahahahaha.   Fucking Bastard Guy.   I'm testing out the block quote function.. just wanting to see what it does. So yeah, funny shit that Steve.  I got owned there.  Kudos to him.   41. King Arthur   Uh, what else, oh, Keira Knightley plays Guinevere in King Arthur... best quote...   Lancelot: There sure are a lot of lonely men out there. Guinevere: Don't worry, I won't let them rape you.   Pwned! (I actually meant to type owned... a real typo)  Man. Good day.  Any day chocked full of KK makes me good.

      Okay the past couple of days, have been kinda boring, same ol' same ol' sort of deals.  Whatever.  Only notable parts are these:  On Sunday(I think), we ended up at Aaron's house and played poker, the pot was huge for this game, I think the pot was like $55 dollars or something and for us that's huge.  Anyway, I ended up taking the cash home, but I think we finished at like 4 AM and sometime before that, we were all like..."fuck, we have to work tomorrow".  The funny part is when Aaron goes... "Shit.. I have to wake up at 7AM for work."  meh.. you had to be there.  I know.. shitty story :p  Okay, here I try again.  Yesterday, the boys played Risk instead of poker.  And let me tell you... Azim doesn't know this, but he is honestly a crappy Risk player.  Okay, he's not crappy persay, but he just talks too much.  At like the 3rd hour of the game, he suggested something to Aaron which was completely stupid, becuase it would lead to his own demise (and mine too) so I chopped him in the chest and started hitting him.  He screamed "that hurt".  I gave him that "are you stupid." look.  Seriously people, if you're gonna play Risk, fricken play to win.  At any rate, I made a mistake by not trying to win the game in one turn, and that cost me the game.  It ended up between me and Aaron and he slaughtered me as he held way too many cards and had the numbers against me.  Aaron had more men all game, and Alex, JP, Azim and Luke just let him build his little stronghold in Europe all game.  I was stuck in South America, unable to counter the red empire amounting over in Eastern Europe, instead I had to just decimate the Americas.  Meh, whatever, well played by all... except Luke. :p (First to go)  Today. I watched a bunch of movies.  Lemme recap from the past week.   36. Love That Boy  Some shitty Canadian movie, it was quirky, and that was the only reason I watched it.   37. Eurotrip  High amounts of T&A, a lot of A that I didn't want to see, and it was pretty damn funny.  Scotty doesn't know.. Scotty gots to go... oh that song is so catchy.  It was no Dodgeball though, and I think this is on par with Old School.  This one guy though, honestly, acted like David Spade, he stole his whole spiel et al! What a total rip off.   38. Men With Brooms  A really good movie.  I know a little bit about curling and I really enjoyed this movie.  Really good.   39. A Problem with Fear  Another shitty, quirky Canadian film.  Seriously, you wonder why the Canadian Film industry sucks, they put out shitty films.  I mean, the plot was pretty good, the idea was pretty good, but fuck, it just came out completely shitty.  Oh this ending really really really sucked too.   40. Species  A hot, half-naked babe, killing things.  What's not to love?  Oh, I'm fucking watching King Arthur tomorrow. I'll even go alone if no one wants to come.  Alright... the sleuth part.  Well... This Sasha girl seems to be commenting on my blog a lot lately.  So, afraid of having some sort of crazy stalker or something, although, I am kinda flattered, but anyway, I decided to sleuth around.  I found her blog, I found her website, I found out who she was, I even found out what she looks like, even though all of her pics are down.  Good Ol' Yearbook where would I be without you.  Meh, read her blog, and learned a few things about her.  Now I'm kinda satisfied.  But for that 30 minutes I was researching, I was being a bit obsessive about it.  I thought she was white at first thought too, turns out she's not.  Oh assumptions can never get you anywhere.  It's weird, reading her blog had me totally convinced she was some whitey.  Maybe the picture was wrong, maybe I should stop assuming things.  I'll just wait until Sasha comments.  Heh.  Now I'm obsessive.

      Working is extremly boring, and only certain things makes time go by.  And there are: 1. Hot girls. 2. Interesting conversations with customers. 3. Interesting conversations with employees. 4. Someone dropping something. 5. Hot girls.  Like seriously, last week, my god, this fucking drop dead gorgeous girl is in the Mandarin.  Like seriously, I'd give her a 9 out of 10, and I rarely even get pasts 7s.  my god, hot.  Even ask Luke.  Hot.  So she's wearing this like white frilled dress (my favourite kind, frilled that is) you know... the multi layered frilling do-whickies.. anyway... she's wearing this dress, it's extremely low cut, as in the she's showing a lot.  So whatever, right, hot girl, whatever, I just do my job and enjoy the view.  Then she comes over, and fucking bends over to get food.  Like seriously, the view was absolutely ridiculous.  There she is, standing right infront of me, leaned foward, trying to get god knows what, and me standing there, just enjoying myself.  I remember Joey (the guy working beside me saying "So, what are you looking at"  and I go "Oh nothing, just enjoying the view."  good fucking times.  I don't know why it makes time go by faster, it's not like I'm getting any. Meh.  I don't know why, she probably knows she's damn hot and does everything to flaunt it.  The walk, the swagger, the hair and all.  Honestly, God puts hot women on Earth to taunt to rest of us normal folk.  Damn you.  DAMN YOU!   Oh, I got this frosh team letter thingy from my team.  check it out, it's like written by a 6 year old:       Sad, that I have to be lead by some guy who can't even write neatly... he even had to correct himself at some point on the sheet.... jesus.  Oh I'm going to love University.  There's evne a Toga party on the Saturday from 9pm to 1 AM during Frosh Week.  yay.

      Okay.&nbsp; I have a question for anyone who is willing to answer it.&nbsp; But first, I must explain what popped this conundrum in my head.&nbsp; So, today at work, I'm working like usual, and dying a slow painful death, of utter torture and agony.&nbsp; Of course, the occasional hot girl comes by, does her little thing, and for some reason I feel better.&nbsp; Okay, the question isn't about why I feel better.&nbsp; But this one girl, who has a really nice ass (sorry for demeaning women for their physical appearance, but fuck you guys for wearing what you wear.)&nbsp;&nbsp; So, she's wearing these absolutley tight kapris, and their white, like white white. So white, it's fucking  see through .&nbsp; I came to the conclusion that she wasn't wearing a thong, nor underwear after about 6 seconds of gocking. Then Mark, the guy I'm working with, is like: "She's not wearing any underwear!".&nbsp; Seriously, girls, just any one in general, do you not realise this?&nbsp; Are you purposely doing this?&nbsp; Isn't it demeaning in some way?&nbsp; Is this the kind of attention you want? Why would you not wear fucking underwear, doesn't it get ass uncomfortable? Like shit, that jean/khaki&nbsp;material isn't the most&nbsp;delicate cloth around.&nbsp; Fuck, I'm not complaining, but Lord almighty, tempt ye not.&nbsp;  ____________

      I've been watching an exhorbitant amount of television lately, mostly movies and TLC.  Man TLC rocks, and not to mention movies.  So without further adieu the movies I watched:   45. Absolon  A B movie.  Just B plastered all over it.   46. Rodger Dodger  T'was good.   47. Rudy  I've seen this movie like 67 times and everytime I'm like WOOOO RUDY! RUDAY! RUUUDEEEEEI!  Oh god, someone help me, I'm so bored. So bored. I remembered during school when I was like "Oh my god, I can't wait until summer.  Can't wait." Now, it's like, fuck I need something to do.  Oh and, yesterday, I fell off my bed.  Now, you might think I fell like onto my front and braced myself with my knees or hands or even maybe my face, but no, I didn't fall like that.  I fell off my two foot bed and smacked my back directly onto the floor.  I swear to God that there was more bed to be rolled on, and I just rolled right fucking off the bed, landed square on my back onto the hardwood floors, bounced, then hit them again.  Everyone in my house was like "Did you just fall of your bed?" and you could tell by their faces that they were trying not to laugh.  My god, how the fuck did I lose my sense of bed.  I've never fallen off my bed unintentionally before, fuck, I must have been ass tired or something.  My back kinda hurts now.. man that was a hard fall.

      Guess who I saw at the Mandarin today....  GUESS               You're not guessing...          Come on you cheater.         I'm looking at you.  Yes you Azim.            Okay, I know you're cheating too Leslie.           Fine, whatever.       I saw the McClures!  Andrew and Michael!  And they were both wearing grey!  Crazy! Small-talked ensued, and I just couldn't help but smile the whole time.  They are some cool dudes.  I found out that they are bothing going to Laurier, one of them doing Business, and the other doing Computer Science and Business.  CRAZY! THE McClures!

      Fucking Blogger and having downtime, just when I was in a good train of thought.  Now it's 4 AM and I forgotten what I wanted to write, cursid Google!  I even knew about the downtime, I read it earlier, sometime this afternoon just before I went to work... meh, I should have been more prepared.  Okay so let's roll back a few days:   Last Thursday:  Simon's shindig was very informal as I was invited through Andrea.  Which I thought kind of weird because Andrea didn't come.  Then I started to wonder if she got invited, and then I'm like she must have, Simon isn't a jackass.  Meh, weird though.  Then I came to the conclusion that Simon had no way of reaching me other than through Andrea, but I'm sure he could have contacted Josh... meh, whatever.  Anyway, I felt totally out of place there, no offense to those guys, the only people I  really  talked to the whole night was Josh, Jaclynn, Lauren and Simon.  Everyone else was just either too involved in their own little circle, or just their personalities just clashed with mine.  You know the kind of people, where when you even try to start small talk and it just happens to die for some unexplicit reason.  Yeah that house was filled with about like 6 of those people to me.  Whatever, I guess this is what happens in all parties, everyone gets into their niches and that's what happens.  At some point IB marks came up and the conversation must have went on for about an hour, as I was completely lost as for one, not in IB (not really anyway), and two, I don't even have my pin and ID to get my single mark.  (No matter though, I found out through OUAC I got a 5 [I was predicted a 6])  Anyway, at that point in the night I just gave up, realised I didn't belong and just decided to just ride the rest of the night out.  I felt kinda sorry for Alyssa, she was either completely bored, detatched and/or couldn't get anything going with any of us.  Meh, whatever, her hair was cool :D.  I wrote a shitty yearbook message in Lauren's yearbook, I realised I really can't write a good message ever.  I write either things that are too long and trite, or too short and full of crap.  I suck at goodbyes.  Basically, the entire night, people just hung out and talked, and the greatest part of the night, is that I found out a get $75 from Maria, which was like winning the god damn lottery.  Seventy-Fucking-Five dollars!  That's insane!  Oh, one conversation came up where, what I would do if I had only 1 month to live.  I think somewhere I said I'd rape someone.  It came out kinda cold, but really thinking about it, I really doubt I could be actually capable of such a thing.  It seems to be the most obvious answer, but I am quite certain I couldn't actually do it.  I guess when and if the time comes, I'll know the answer.  I left when the queue was given (the parents in the next room, when the whole time they weren't anywhere near us).  That's when you know when you gotta leave... heh.  Then I played some poker after that.  What a night.  Good to see some faces I haven't seen in a while.   Friday:  I went to a 24 Hour Pho place on Dundas and Hurontario.  It's honestly like 15 minutes away, it's kinda just off the Square One exit and like 6 streets south.  Anyway, the food was good, although portions small, the drinks sucked, don't get drinks there like those milkshakes (blah!) and they didn't even have durian at the time I went.  I like durian, sue me.  So, we (being Peter, Paul, Kai and myself) are just chilling there talking about people at work, and of course the most craziest of all of us, Peter, goes on about how he's just macking this complete stranger.  I mean in all honesty, you only think you hear/see that kind of shit on TV, but Peter just goes on about how it's like the first date, and he's already all over her.  What the fuck.  Meh, it was entertaining to listen to him.    Oh before that, how I almost died... I use a 8-inch knife to cut food.  It's about 3 inches in width and it weights like 3 lbs.  And, on top of that, it's sharpened everyday so that it cuts meet like paper.  I honestly can cut meet with this beautiful knife thinner than paper.  It's a sweet ass knife.  So yeah, how I almost died... I left the knife on the cutting board at where I usually stand.  I walked over to talk to Kai and the knife was hanging off the ledge of the board (handle facing out).  So when I'm done chatting, I turn around and stroll back to where I normally stand, unknowingly, I knock the knife off the table, and it falls.    The knife falls, straight-down, point-down, hits the ground, not even an inch away from my foot.  I hear the loud bang, look down, and see the fucking knife almost hit my foot.  I was like... "I'm one lucky ass bastard."  #2 death incident, okay, at night, especially when I'm alone, I'm an excessive speeder, I do the pass-weave-pass business.  I don't know why, it's somewhat dangerous, but I just like getting home fast.  So I'm on the 403, going back to the 410, and I'm cruising at a nice 140 km/h.  Then there's this construction zone right before the 403 merges with the 410, so from like three lanes it becomes two.  Whatever, I'm in a lane that's not closed off so I'm okay, so I go faster to pass some cars, now I'm going at like 160 km/h.  The car ahead of me, also speeding like crazy, changes lanes and I'm like 5 car lengths behind him, but at 160 km/h that might be like 2-3 seconds of time.    I really can't recall how much time I had, but the car infront of me just dodges a huge pylon sitting in the middle my lane.  I'm like "fuck... i'm so fucked."  I check my blind-spot, it's clear (but there is a car in the lane, maybe 1-2 car lengths behind my blind spot) and there's a huge black SUV in the lane I need to change to that's just half a car length in front of me so I break and swrive.  My car, looses grip for about maybe a quarter of a second, causing the car to fishtail a little, by a little, I mean a lot, but not like I was facing the wrong direction, but rather, my car swung a bit.  I can't really be sure what happened, it all happened kinda fast.  Meh, whatever.  Then I went on the 410, and got up to 170-175 ish.  Which is the fastest I've ever went in my Malibu.  Looking back at it, I didn't need to swirve, I probably could have changed lanes, if I just broke a little harder.   Saturday:  Luke at some point during the week, probably Friday, was like to me:   Luke: It's finally hit me that, I won't see you guys in two months. Danny: Way to join the club.  You're just a tad late.    Then I went on to thinking about somethings when I was working.  When I work, my mind isn't concentrating on work, it's thinking of things, and I just work by reflex.  It's kinda cool.  Now I'm going to try to describe a moment of thought I had that day.  At some point, the movie I, Robot popped in my head, probably because I mentioned I wanted to see it to the boys earlier in the week.  Then I remembered that it was based on a book.  Then I remembered JP saying something how the book is just a bunch of short stories.  I was like woah, I wonder how that would work out.  Then suddenly I was like, there's a lot of movies based on books.  And then bam, I was like whatever happened to the Ender's Game movie.  I wonder who would star as Ender.  Even better, when the fuck is it coming out I wondered.  (At this time, I'm stocking meat) Then I'm like Ender's Game was a really good book.  Man shit, good times in English.  Then I was like, Oh shit remember  urlLink this . And I was like hot damn!  That was a great thing.  I stole Riyaad's book, so he couldn't finish it, in order for Andrea to buy Riyaad the next book so he wouldn't start reading it before he got it.  It was funny.  Ass funny.  I'm going to miss those times.  Then immediately after that,  I'm so blogging this .  Then right after that, I wondered if Danny's Dangles still exists, and if when if ever, I'll go up to wherever Ruth's camp is and have those death value wings.  Yes Luke, you're so going down.   Sunday:  Died at work.  Got home, showered, adjusted my fly on the fly, thereby let the door hit me on the way out. Then cruised with JP and Jason.  We hit up Gage Park, watched some skaters break into the the snack bar or whatever, watched JP climb up a tree that was planted the same month and year I was born.  Found some tacks and vandalised a couple of benches with those.  Flipped a bench, found a fountain foaming.  As you realise, my sentences are getting more broken and broken.  The first 3 days were easy to remember but right now it's almost 5 AM and my memory is lacking.  Anyway, we went to 7-11 to get some slushies, the machines were TEH BROKEN! So we went to the Dixie and Williams one where we bumped into one of JP's co-workers and his g/f.  At first glance, we thought his g/f was Hannah, but then I'm like, for one she doesn't own a dress like that, and two she's at camp, and three it's way past her bed time.  Laugh.  Anyway, we got some slushies, I like the Banana. it's fucking good.  We ended up parking in the Bramalea parking lot and just chilled for a while, the slushies make good explosions when thrown high.  Yeah, that was that night.  Oh.  I almost forgot, I stood outside Jason's moonroof while singing some song.  I think it was either The Killers or maybe Jet or was it Frandz Ferdinand.  Meh.   Monday:  Work. Poker.  Was asked to work on Tuesday and Thursday.  (If I were too accept both, that would mean I would work 6 out of the 7 days of this week.)  I just said "I can only work Tuesday." and left it at that.     Tuesday:  Me sitting here twiddling my thumbs.  Well actually I watched  43.Grind   when I woke up.  I watched it with my brother, and we both enjoyed it quite thoroughly.  It was an okay movie.  Then I went to work.  Jesus. BORING. OH wait, I discovered a new religion.  I think it's called Bahai or something, and it's pretty fucking cool.  It's like everything I've been thinking of the past couple of years.  Meh, need to read more to know what it's really about.  Came home, no one was doing anything, so here I am being more bored.  Watched  44. All the Real Girls  and this movie was good.  It captured real life and real love, but fuck did some of the scenes seem so out of place I couldn't explain it.  I was watching it, and then it cuts (it does a sudden to black and switch scene thing) which kinda fucks up the logic.  Some scenes are beautiful and some scenes seemed so forced.  But at any rate, I was surpised at the ending. Which got my confused until I watched the last bit like 3 times over.  Good movie!  Now that brings me to here and now.  And after reading over some comments:  Greg - Sasha is now a Gr.10 student at Turner Fenton.  She discovered my blog through bloggers interests/place of residence/etc etc. Kinda like Live Journal's thing.  Anyway, she started reading, got hooked apparently, and now is reader.  She has her own blog, but it's supposedly secret, so I'll won't link you unless she does it first.  Uh, what else, she's brown (at least I think she is), she's a Liberal, but one might not think that from her opinions.  She's completely white washed.  At least I think so.  Uh, I dunno.  Someone throw a party! I'm so BOOOOOOOOORED.

      I'm chewing on this skittle gum shit.  Apparently it's off market.  My cousin's mom or something works for the parent company of skittles, whatever it is. Mr. Christie or Nestle or whatever.  I really odn't know.  You know what I mean though.  I dunno, I wonder why this stuff will never be sold, it's like those gum ball things.  Meh.  I really wish I was 19 right now.  I'm missing out on clubs.  Lot's and lots of clubbing.  Sigh...  And you say, get a fake ID? you know clubs swipe your card to see if it's real now.  Fake that!  Meh, whatever, it's worth the wait.  I'll explain the events of the prior days, tomorrow.  (Man am I lazy, that and I have to work, typing out long stories takes forever.)  On a side note,  42. Chicago.  Yes, and I actually liked it.  I was kinda confused for a while though, I was wondering why they were breaking into song and what not... but it made sense after like 2 or 3 times.

       48. I, Robot    &nbsp; The only reason I watched it was becuase I was dying to know how the robots looped around the 3 rules.&nbsp; If you watch enough movie trailers, you get to know the whole plot but you usually don't get the ending... which in this case I desperately wanted to know.&nbsp; How they did loop around I thought was pretty clever, and it was a satisfying ending.&nbsp; Pretty damn good if I say so myself.&nbsp; But through the entire movie, I just couldn't help but think: "product placement, anyone?"  Today was pretty uneventful, I got filled with my daily 6-8 hours of Counter-Strike and then finally went out to Dairy Queen where I got a sundae.&nbsp; The person asked me what kind of sundae, and I didn't know that there were different kinds, so I got confused, while at the same time I was talking to Azim on the phone.&nbsp; It must have seemed really rude of me to do it, I mean I was talking to the cashier and to Azim almost simultaneously, wow, I'm a complete ass.&nbsp; Anyway, I just said something along the lines of "vanilla and hot fudge" as I had no clue what she was talking about when she asked me what kind.&nbsp; There's different kinds of sundaes?!?  Oh when I went to pay, I found a toonie on the floor, so the sundae was virtually free, and I knew I couldn't have dropped it as I don't carry around loose change, 'cause I have a change purse.&nbsp; werd.&nbsp;   Afterwards, we went to play pool at Boston Pizza, and Greg is pretty good at pool while JP and I were alright.&nbsp; It was fun, and a good waste of like 2 hours.&nbsp; I like how I have to burn my free time now, and while I was in school I just couldn't wait for summer, oh the mother fucking irony.   __________

      In the past 3 years, I've recieved many prank calls, usually at least once per month.&nbsp; It's not that big of a deal, but I have to admit it does get annoying after sometime.&nbsp; I guess some old friends of mine or my brothers don't like us very much or Dang just happens to be one of the first things teenage kids go to look for in the phone book.&nbsp; At any rate, I've come up with quite a good system to combat prank calls. &nbsp; There's two types:    The auto-dialer machine one, which I recently discovered  A person   I usually say, Hello twice, and on a good day I might even say it a thrice time to ensure that no one important is on the other side.&nbsp; If I don't get a response, I usually break into song.&nbsp; My favourite song to hum is usually Smoke on the Water, and at the end of the riff, 85% of the time the other person hangs up.&nbsp; As they get annoyed by my horrible rendition or the realise that at this point I'm toying with them.&nbsp; The other 15% usually get a pop song that's stuck in my head, and that's when it gets really interesting, I think this month has been Hillary Duff month and hence I've been singing Come Clean on and off.&nbsp; It's funny because they always hang up after the first line.&nbsp;  The other one, the dreaded auto-dialer with the brown person on the other side, is pretty easy to combat.&nbsp; Pick up, say hello, realise it's auto dialer, set your phone down for 10 minutes.&nbsp; They hang up, always.&nbsp; By stalling for 10 minutes, other people won't have to suffer the wrath of the auto-dialer.&nbsp; This method also works for real people too.&nbsp; It's great when they try to pull the silent treatment on you and they just hear nothing.&nbsp; Sometimes, I don't even say hello, I just wait until the other side does. :D

      I am, really, I just want to see what my hair looks like when it's abnormally long.&nbsp; Right now, my hair does weird stuff already and it's not even that long.&nbsp; I wonder how weird it will get later.&nbsp; It's getting pretty shaggy in the back though, I might think of trimming the back or something, but we'll see.&nbsp; Maybe I'll grow an afro like my dad circa the 70s.&nbsp; Oh man, that would be funny.&nbsp; Apparently my hair was doing something funny today, but I don't walk around with a mirror so nuts to that.&nbsp; Boy am I tired.&nbsp; Dur -_-

      On Thursday, I forgot to mention, I dodged some kids skateboard that I was going to run over.&nbsp; But it was kinda sweet, it was like a panther-like reflex, with precision and skill.&nbsp; The shit that you see professionals do, or super heroes.&nbsp; Anyway, what happened was this kid was grinding/olleying/kickfliping (there goes my knowledge of skateboard tricks),&nbsp; right in front of the Brunswick Bowling Lanes, and I think he must of fell off or failed some trick and his board bolted right infront of my car, I was less than a car length away from the board, and I just swirved out of reflex.&nbsp; It was pretty sweet.&nbsp; I wanted to talk to the kid, but he ran before I got to park.&nbsp; I wasn't going to yell at him, just sorta scare him :D &nbsp; I missed seeing Ruth again.&nbsp; Oh craziness. &nbsp; I'm tired.&nbsp; Working blows. aye...

      So, disappointed and defeated was my general mood for the beginning of the day.  Sad that I couldn't get a little 'krunked up' at Ada's shindig, I headed off to work in a pretty nonchalant fashion.  My mom drove me to work, I just stuck my head out the window the whole time feeling the nice breeze (my mom drives horrendously slow, she drives the speed limit for Christ's sake!).  Work had it's usual stuff, some pretty boring customers, however, there was this like 3 year old who kept coming back and smiling and waving at me, which was soooooooo cute.  But I digress, my masculinity is at stake here... I waved back btw, and made some funny faces, he giggled and laughed.  Man little kids are cool....so anyway, the day ended off with a rush because everyone wanted to go to the "party" afterwards.   I didn't even know there was a party today, I was completely suprised when I found out that everyone was going to the Onion and Something Restaurant in Markham (it's across from Pacific Mall, on a side note, I went to that restaurant like 50 times in my life).  I was like wow, there's a party today? hot damn, I'm so in.  I went around and finally got a ride for there and back as I knew damn well I'm gonna get mother fucking liquered up, especially when it's free.  Free.  Man that's such a good word.  Free.  So yeah, we finish up work like double-quick-time, way faster than usual, and we all head down to the restaurant.  Now, this restaurant closes at like 11.  We had the place shutdown, and reserved for us until like 3 AM.  That's hardcore. Hard-mother-fricken-core.  Turn's out, it was my general manager, Sunny's birthday.  So in celebration, we had a little secret present for him.  It was a pretty damn good secret too.    We got him a stripper.     It's funny because, I was there first off, I was the youngest person there, probably broke a few laws, drinking first off, and then a stripper second off, but meh, it was fun.   Man, I think I'll remember this day for a long while, probably becuase of the stripper.... maybe because of the drinking but I really think it was just the good time I had there.  To tell the truth, the stripper was anticlimatic, I already knew there was a stripper coming since the beginning of this week, but I wasn't quite sure what and when, and for those of you who don't know... there's quite a vass amount of porn on the internet already, so really, a stripper didn't do much for me.    And she was asian too, "not my thang", sorta speak.  But some of these guys were going wild, and you should have seen Sunny's face turn bright ass red... good times.  So all in all, I lost out on some today, but I guess karma is pretty good when it counts.  Kudos to your Karma.  Kudos to you.

      Well, today, or rather, yesterday was a special day.&nbsp; Yesterday, July 29th,&nbsp;was my brother's 14th birhday.&nbsp; He had a bunch of his friends over, some sort of party ensued and I added a little older brother spice to the mix as I often like to do.&nbsp; It's an older sibling habit of mine, I tend to crash anything that my brother has, well&nbsp;it isn't really  crashing  persay,&nbsp;more like adding fuel to the fire.&nbsp;&nbsp;His friends, I dunno it's just a mangle set of individuals from all sorts of crazy backgrounds who all have clashing personalities, although they don't know it yet.&nbsp; It'll get more apparent during highschool as everyone gets more selective in their friends, but as of now, they're bonds through immaturity and tomfoolery is quite tight and comical.&nbsp; Seriously, everyone makes fun of everyone else, in one of those hahaha ways, but once you look&nbsp;back some of those comments are pretty harsh.&nbsp; Meh, not my problem.  But really, I love my brother quite a bit, although I'm certain I'd never admit to anyone in person, nor him, ever, but that's just how we work.&nbsp; I had fun sorta hanging out with his friends, and I sorta feel like more of a 'cool' parent more than anything, I understand more of my brother's friends, problems and etc than my parents do which is kinda sad at times, but I guess that's what's expected of an older brother.&nbsp; But, I kinda feel like I'm taking on more than I should, but whatever, I kinda have fun doing it, and I like to think I'm pretty good at it.&nbsp; With that said, the day consisted of my bro and his friends watching Old School and some Insane Clown Posse Movie, my brother and his friends seem to have some sort of weird obsession with this crackass band as their music sucks and their jokes sucks and their movie was terrible.&nbsp; It was so shitty, and I predicted the ending midway through the movie, and the boys were like "How did you know?!", in&nbsp;some sort of surpised fashion like I was psychic, I kinda brushed it off with a joke of some sort, proclaiming&nbsp;I was a god or something... I can't remember now, it was funny then though :p.... if you're wondering,&nbsp;the ending was some cop was the Mr. Sweet (the evil mob ganster guy)&nbsp;or whatever the retard's name is.  After that, man, pizza galore, I don't think I've ever made this apparent but I really really like that Pizza Pizza garlic-whatever-sauce.&nbsp; It's really good, most people just dip their crust into it, and although as disgusting as this sounds, I dip&nbsp;just about my whole pizza into the stuff, it's good,  really it is .&nbsp; I had one of those cups of it to myself and I think 7 other people split the remaining two, I ended up cleaning up&nbsp;my cup completely and everyone was like "What the fuck?! How did you manage that?" It's good!&nbsp; It is!  Things&nbsp;cooled down afterwards, we had some cake and people slowly left,&nbsp;I wasn't really attached to the party&nbsp;so I really didn't have any feelings during&nbsp;or afterwards, but I always usually get mellow and kinda sad when parties end, it's like&nbsp;"Oh man,&nbsp;how am I going to have fun now?" Am I only person that gets into these kinda fits?&nbsp;   Oh I'm kinda disappointed I won't be attending little Ada's gypsy congregation tomorrow (or today depending on how you look at it) but I man's gotta do what a man's gotta do.&nbsp; That is, work till you bleed, and mind you, I've bled many times at work already...  What else, yeah I'm kinda worried, I should get started on my University prep shopping... it's almost time! AHhhhh.&nbsp; 5 weeks and some odd days.. double AHhhh! AHHHHHHHHHH!

      You might be thinking, what the hell does RTR stand for.&nbsp; And that will be a secret... muahahhahahahahaha....&nbsp;until someone breaks the acronym, or Azim tells everyone.&nbsp;&nbsp; Either case, this will confuse and bewilder the lot of you for the next day... maybe even two.   psst... I'm working&nbsp; this Wednesday. (I never work Wednesdays too, I think there's Greater Powers that are working against me.)    &nbsp; Okay, so I haven't really been blogging much, but that's to be expected, I mean, I work 3 days in a row, and each day consists of a 13 hour shift, I mean, if that doesn't tucker you out, then you should a marathon or even two at that.&nbsp; But! This weekend, this wasn't the case, because on Saturday, there was a Student Life 101 Session @ Waterloo, it was more or less like a pre-emptive orientation day.&nbsp; I picked up my Watcard and I think it has $1200 dollars on it... or soon to have anyway, it has a pretty goofy looking picture of myself, because my hair is longer than usual and it was messed up that day as well.&nbsp; I don't take care of my hair much anymore, looks kinda cool that way I think.&nbsp;   My dad asked me the other day, "Are you going to cut your hair?"&nbsp; and I snapped back with a quick "no."&nbsp; He then gave me this stare as if I was a freak or something and then muttered something along the lines of &nbsp;"Are you growing your hair like  urlLink The Beatles ?" at which point I was a little confused, and then I futally tried to look at my hair and replied with "No, I don't think so... but does it like like it?" and then my dad was like "Sorta..."&nbsp; There you have it, my hair kinda looks like that.&nbsp; But there's two phases of my hair, when I wear a hat, or get out of bed it has an extremely messed up look which is really cool, but when's it's freshly washed it kinda looks like a Noel Gallagher hair-do.&nbsp; But I digress, this post wasn't suppose to be about my hair.  Okay, on Saturday, I wore my Pom Pom shirt on purpose, just cause, I'm going to Waterloo, I figured it would be an easy way to break that awkwardness when talking to people you don't know. And it's Waterloo of course, who doesn't love&nbsp; urlLink homestarrunner ?!&nbsp; And to my surpise, I think like&nbsp;4 people commented on my shirt and it  was  a pretty good ice-breaker. &nbsp; Note to self: Wear it again during Frosh Week.&nbsp;  Besides that, there were surpisingly a large number of attractive females at Waterloo, even I was surpised.&nbsp; I like being surpised.&nbsp; I think I'm going to enjoy 6 weeks from now... a lot.&nbsp; And my dorm is really nice too, fairly spacious, with a kitchen, a washroom for just 3 of us, pretty sweet, only downer is I'm living in a double room, but whatever, it's cheaper, and&nbsp;a new friend is always good. So much stuff to buy... crap... I need to make a list... sigh..  Uh whatelse... oh&nbsp;bumped into Veronica, Gabe, some&nbsp;graduates from Turner who I don't know, and&nbsp;yea... that's it for Loo.&nbsp; I think I'm going to like it next year, the&nbsp;Davis building is so cool.  Then Azim and I went onto some random splurging at the Bay,&nbsp;at Erin Mills no less.&nbsp;I bought some boxers and he some swimming trunks, we got some McFlurries afterwards and just tried to see if anyone was up to anything, being back in the neighbourhood and all.&nbsp; No luck with a bunch of people but Ruth was in town! woo.&nbsp; Finally, I got to see her since like... forever!&nbsp; We hung out at her house for a while, drove JP to a party, went back to visit Ruth's old house, which was occupied by to two rich gay guys.&nbsp; They had 4 cars between the two of them! They were gay-a-fying the house as Ruth took a little tour and picked up her mail and of course white-people drama ensued.  Apparently, the Clarks, the McArthur's backyard neighbours&nbsp;cut the vines along the fence between the two properties.&nbsp; The Clarks claimed that they had a "deal" with the McArthurs that they could "trim" the vines if they grew on their side of the fence.&nbsp; The Clarks not only trimmed the vines, they hacked away at the roots! Killing the once beautiful greenary that was there.&nbsp; Of course, the Gays, didn't know that, and the Clarks told the Gays that there was such a deal, but in reality THERE ISN'T! It's all lies... ALL OF IT.&nbsp; Those crazy Clarks, seriously, voyeurism is so taboo.&nbsp; Especially if it's on gays.&nbsp; Keep that privacy fence up please.  Uh what else... oh yeah&nbsp;  49. Bourne Supremecy.  It pretty much owned.&nbsp; Oh that Jason Bourne, what will he do next?  Fun Day. Fun Night.&nbsp; Good times.

      Damn.  All I have to say is damn.  Damn damn damn damn damn!  I love coming of age, feel-good movies, I just do, I can't help myself but fall into the same trap every single time.  Not to mention Elisha Cuthbert.  Hot damn.  That's all i have to say, and that's all I got today (look that rhymed!)  I've also been watching this anime called Naruto, it's pretty good.  Other than that not much has happened today, 'cause I woke up at like 4:30, and ate breakfast (which was dinner for everyone else) and that's about it.  Woo, messed up sleep schedule rocks!

      I finally got around to watching  51. Better Luck Tomorrow  I also watched  52. Speed  am currently downloading like 5 movies. I guess it's my new obsession, my new hobby sort of speak, it almost rivals the amount of laziness that I have in me. There's two parts in this post, currently I'm listening to Cake and trying to think of a way to blend these two ideas coherently in some sort of entertaining matter. I think I just stole that line from  urlLink Clublife ... oh well.  Better Luck Tomorrow, what can I say, it was I don't know how to say... empowering? Well not in the sense that I felt like going outside and start a few riots and write to my mayor or something, but it was just good to know that somewhere out there that there is movie out there that caters to my slice of the demographic pie, no matter how small that slice is. I read somewhere from Justin Lin (the director of BLT) and I paraphrase:     In a film marketing class I attended way back in Cal, the teacher brought out one of those pie charts showing different races. The pie was predominately white, with of course other minorities such as blacks and hispanics taking up the rest. At this point I questioned where Asians fit into the pie, and he replied with "Well Asian Americans have similar spending habits as those of white americans so they're included in that sense, we consider them white Americans."   Sometimes I just wonder... but in my new sense of empowerment, but yet lack of identity, I started surfing the net, and going back to my old bookmarks. I have about 20 websites from various asian communities that I joined a couple of years back, and just started reading a variety of articles from them again. I have this sort of teetering sense of self, I really don't know where I fit in, I don't really know who I am, and I go through little cycles were periodically I go asian-gung-ho and periods where I just feel like any thoroughbred Canadian. And this is one of those times where I'm gung-ho-asian. That's why there's a ricebowljournals link over on the right now. I hope they approve me. The last time I was there (when I first started my journal) they weren't excepting new applications then. So let's knock on some wood.  I guess self and identity are one of those things that I'll have a hard time solving, sometimes I'm so sure of what I am and where I belong but then things change and the once impervious wall of certainty crumbles. It's all great and dandy, but being born a 1st generation Asian-Canadian is a little tricky. I remember having this discussion with Ms. Kowalska, I think she's also a 1st generation Polish-Canadian, and we discussed the difficulties of choosing the path you wish to follow. Because to simply put it there are two choices, you can be Asian-Canadian or Asian. I think I argued that it was possible to be just Canadian, but superficial stereotypes just don't allow people to see that. But then thequestion of Canadian identity arised and if there really is one, it's so multicutural from east to west, no one knows that the beaver stands for. Hell, I don't even know half of the Canadian prime ministers or even what they did. Ms. Kowalska didn't have an answer at the time, she described the same predicament that I'm currently in, and maybe some of you guys are too, but she just basically sat on the fence and still is. It was a little disheartning to hear that, if she couldn't make a choice, how would I? She has like 10 years experience of life over me, and she still doesn't know... man that really blows I thought at the time. Then I went into a period of just being who I am, opened up a little more and just let loose in a way, although I'm still really reserved in many other ways. Now I'm hear, and this sort of identity crisis situation sorta arised again, and I've been thinking for like the past 8 hours, and really have come up with nothing. I guess that's how I'm going to be for a while, just wandernig around looking for answers.  I think the dilemna arised when my parents just decided to stop parenting me. I lacked parental support in every which way since I was about 7, when my reading ability was better than theirs. Sad but true. I guess my parents stop participating in education and my life, once it became to difficult for them, they just didn't have the answers for me, and I guess they couldn't bare that or maybe they just didn't have the time. I remember when I was learning English when I was about 5, I sat in my room everyday and read two books. One about coconuts going bang bang boom, and one about the Bernstein Bears or something, I had the audio tapes for them, and that's how I learned how to read. Of course the hours spent in my ESL sessions helped too, but I basically learned English on my own with headphones on. Maybe that explains why to this date, my grammar is horrible and I make the most simplist mistakes in speech.  But I digress, I'm making a super duper long post about my growing up later... right now I'm just confused about who I am or rather, not who I am, but what do I belong to. What box do I check off on those census sheets? Most of time just for simplicity sake, I say I'm Chinese. But in fact, I'm part Vietnamese too, but everyone gets a little confused, and I really don't like explaining it, although pretty simple. Grandparents - Chinese, immigrated to Vietnam during WWII, had kids (my parents), so they're Vietnamese(sort of speak), and then they immigrated to Canada and then me. So really.. I'm like Chinese-Vietnamese-Canadian. But heck, I don't really do anything Chinese nor Vietnamese. So Canadian should suffice. But does it? That's the only question I really need to answer. People at work occasionally call me a "Joak Sing Jai" which primatively translates to White Boy. It's true though, I'm pretty white-washed. I dunno, this post is going no where, and it's getting pretty long. I'll stop now.  Oh yeah, Speed sucks.   I saw this in a movie about a bus that had to speed around a city, keeping its speed over 50, and if its speed changed, it would explode! I think it was called, The Bus That Couldn't Slow Down. - Homer

      I really really want to talk to someone about the movie, but meh, no one is really a movie talking type of person, damn I need a girlfriend.  It's so neatly put together and such a good film.   Like for instance... hah no I won't ruin it, if you plan to see it.... bastards!  But, let's just say, it all makes a hell of a lot of sense once you think about it.   And the plot twist, the major one that is, was completely unexpected.  Completely.  1984 what.  Maybe that was too much of a clue, meh.  Basically it's just refreshing to watch a film with an actual plot, with actual themes, rather than just a rock-em-sockem action flic or a stoner film.   But let's talk about why stupid people should be executed on the spot.  For example, today, in the theatres, I mean the Village is like a suspense/thriller, with a multitude of parts where you should be silent to absorb the setting/mood etc... whatever, but what do we have?  A mother fucking babbling 6-month old in the corner of the theatre.  Fucking nigger.  I saw the kid when I was walking up to my seats, who the fuck brings their 6-month old to a movie, THEY CAN'T EVEN COMPREHEND THE IMAGES THEY SEE.  If anything, it's more disturbing for the child to have sudden changes in images and sudden booms of sound. To The Village no less. Man, what a fucking lousy parent.  I just wanted to stand up, and scream, "What the fuck, get your fucking stupid ass kid out of here, can't you see we're TRYING TO WATCH A MOVIE?!".  Of course, I figured, I'd be chastised for yelling at some kid, indirectly, so I kept it to myself.  Fucking eh.

      Okay, 3 days, 13 hours a day... how can it get possibly worst I wonder... well shit let's just add another day...  I'm working tomorrow, man fuck me.  But I made good money this weekend, and will probably be tomorrow, I'm almost have enough to buy a brand spanking new computer, which is something I've been really looking foward to.  I nice small form factor PC with a LCD... oh baby...  Okay, yesterday, everyone was fucking ass tired, hung over out of their minds, and some ass-wipe mangemant guy called Bob Villa (go figure), he's white, fucking cracker, decides to have a mock evaluation on everyone.  I mean, could you pick a worse day?  So this guy, stands right behind me, like some sort of homosexual pedophile, breathing down my neck while checking away things on his clipboard.  The worst part is, when I wasn't doing something properly or was mis-handling a customer (which I did tonnes of, because I was half-awake, and my vision was so impaired... the whole day, I was like in a slow-motion movie, or a very very laggy CS match.  Damn those low frame rates!) okay so anyway when I was screwing up, the guy would make his big checkmarks audible, like he would make a big gigantic mark on his sheet just so I would hear, or he would snicker.  That mother fucker.  I swear to god I would have fucking turned around and stabbed his white ass with my butcher's knife if I was a little more hung over and little more insane.  I was told later by some other manger's that I scored pretty badly, I told him he could just suck my mother fucking cock and he just laughed.    Meh need to sleep... I got a new pillow, comforter and bed sheets... that's one thing off my list now... woo... time to order my Jansport bag..

      I realised this past weekend that I'm a total freak when it comes to watching/reading just about any form of entertainment, as long as it has a plot.  You know when people say:  "Man, I just found this book and I can't stop reading it"  They're lying to your face, they're talking in present tense so that means they haven't finishe the book yet.  But in my case, I don't ever say that, because if I ever do find books like that, I actually read the whole damn thing in one sitting.  Ender's Game took me roughly 4 hours I think, I read it all in the first day I got it.  Man that book owned.  So this weekend, sometime during Friday, my brother had some episodes of this new anime called Naruto.  To sum up the plot, it's basically about these kids who live in this village and train to be ninjas.  But that's summing it up in one sentence.  In one word, it's "abso-fucking-tastic".  I worked Saturday, Sunday, Monday.  I spent those 3 days, downloading and watching 94 Naruto episodes. That's roughly 31 hours of anime, over 3 days.  Unhealthy? probably, what's even more unhealthy is on the Saturday, I watched about 40 episodes, from when I got home from work (1AM), until 6AM, and then I woke up and went to work at 10 AM.  I did the same thing the next day.  Unhealthy? Most definitely.  But I guess I'm one of those people who gets totally absorbed into the story, if it's a good plot and I can connect with one or more of the characters then I just sink my teeth in and never let go.  It's a good anime, and I've finally caught up to real time Naruto, it's still an ongoing TV series over in Japan, episode 95, should be translated and up on the glorious internet tomorrow.  I'm just dancing around in anticipation.  Can't wait!   54. My Sassy Girl  Really good.  Really really good.  Reminds me of a lot of stuff, but it's good nonetheless.  Oh, I have my mp3 working, so everything is coming together ... I just saw this ridiculous JC Penny commercial trying to be hip, like "I'm feeling it..."  aye, what is the world coming to.
