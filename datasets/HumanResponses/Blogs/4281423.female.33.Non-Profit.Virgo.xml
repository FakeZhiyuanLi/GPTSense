       Boy what a day! To take a day off to relax with 5 kids, what a not so smart idea. What was I thinking!! Not to mention playing mom taxi for everyone. The things we do for our kids. But they always seem to think that it is not quite enough. Oh well life goes on right. Today I got even older. And to relax on your own day. Ha Ha maybe when I am 50 and then I will probably have grandkids. Wait then I can get even. Spoil the heck out of them and teach them nice new tricks and send them home. Ok so I have something to look forward too. Well Im going to try to get some zzzz's before I have to head into the war zone I like to call work in the a.m. Good night to all.

       EWWW it is the end of the weekend....oh wait I get one more day. Yippie!!!!  After this weekend I will need and extra day. oh wait again... I have all 5 kids this week (my 3 and my bf 2) I am thinking that I may want to go to work instead of taking a extra day off. School is getting closer and which makes me feel a little bit closer to heaven. Some extra quiet time so I can do some of my own homework that I have had to put off for over a month now. Not that I am excieted to do homework. But sitting here realizing that my baby is soon to start her first day of High School kind of scares me. Since I know it is going to fly by and she will soon be gone. Although I am very proud of her. Last spring she tried out for the High School cheer squad and made varsity. But she stressed herself out and dropped herself down to JV. A little bummed, but I had to support her.But now I think she is regreting her decission. She does not trust her squad much, and you have got to admit that varsity does get more attention, and that really seems to bother her. And she is trying to tell me that she wants to drop out due to it. But the cost of it will not allow her to. My gosh it is expensive for you're kid to participate in cheerleading. Well enough blabbin for now, Im off for now.  Chow

       As   Usual it is friday and the time is passing ever so slowly. Sure I might have a project that I could do but I just can not get motivated. All I want to do is go home, and do not get me wrong I love my kids to death, and even my son, but I am way ready for them to go to they're dads house for the weekend. Although my boyfriends kids will be here but I don't have quite as much responsibility with them as my own. Even though I feel anything I do or anything I might fix them to eat just is never good enough. But I guess my kids get even for that for they do not seem to understand that because my bf lives in the house that they have to listen to him. Gee go figure!!! Having to listen to an adult. What a bad idea.(Im sure that's what they think) No matter how one talks one blue in the face. Isn't it grand when you're kids start turning into teenagers or think that they are 18, and they are not even 14 yet. Hmmmmm go figure. Well I am going to see how long I can take to get all of my stuff ready to go home and hope that by the time I'm done it will be time.
