      I need to remember.  Feeling my strength being sabotaged with doubt, I get really fed up with disgust and go outside and pedal on my bike until my muscles burn and my breaths are deep, drying my throat.    Drops of sweet drip from my body like tears  as I cry with my whole being  crying as I worship this creation  feeling the pace and control take over me  leaving me a passenger on the vessel.   I'm seeing nothing  but noticing everything in detail  taking note of the balance and necessary breath  and I grip with ease  comfortable to be riding a machine  that carries me to another world with each passing mailbox.   Flicking gears  stressing my anterior then my posterior  long methodic strokes  feeling the size of my legs  the shape of each quad flex and then release  -pushing, pulling mile after mile  holding speed  approaching you, passing you.   My body isn't solid  but a porous entity that is atoms filled with space  air passing through it  and so I'm connected and surrounded  one with existence  giving and taking from the air and earth.   I'm touching the unseen  I'm reaching out catching more  sweating and hungering for more.    The pleasure of the attachment  and yet separated  as my spirit soars far above you  it reaches the clouds   And the clouds rain down  dropping big tear drops  splashing the road  caught in my tires  spraying the back and my front  -rain soaking my clothes  trailing down my shaved legs  beading on my arms  collecting in my shoes  and now my tears of sweat  drip with the rain from God  and we cry together  we weep for closeness and eternity.    Together we will mix like water  and run a long river down a pass  cutting the rocks of tribulation and hatred  swelling the pond of love and forgiveness   The animals will drink us  and be renewed for the long frolic to being  -to existing as one.

      I'll spray out words like paint onto the wall.  I'll fill up the space with thoughts, words lots of words flowing to the floor making meaning out of the nothingness that I feel when I live on the floor waking from a deep dream where god is my counselor, my psychologist telling me my problem is not my family.  He wants to be seen as unobstrusive and just a friend ('I'm a whittler') like he has just formed me into a tiki statue from wood that illuminates the truth that resides in my heart.  If I could just grasp the infinite inside me the long lived and long loving core of who I am.  It is reaching out with hands -touching my core wanting to come out and be itself the true creation walking on concrete dodging bullets and seeing the clouds.  The sky rolling over head and the earth spinning around exposing all things to the star and the stars far away, like god feels at times.  His light shed on me from millions of years ago and the luster has faded into a dim memory of his face in a dream that tumbled around like myself in search of a lover and a beloved my true heart loving only one cherishing God's wisdom and fumbling disorderly chaos.  That two people should meet and become one, but for me it is more amazing that I have a purpose, something to be in this dreary mess of a world with air unbreathable, water undrinkable, food inedible -thoughts unthinkable.  Where do I belong?  In the grave right before I die I'll focus on the beat of my heart, slowing down and the rhythm and force will move my soul to focus on this emptiness that lives, my soul harnesses the faith of eternal life I'll know the heart will stop but the existence of my mind will not stop and I'll feel all new things and the flesh will not hassle me as I move on to the unthinkable and unknowable life after the encasing of the soul is removed what sights will be seen will it be on earth is space a new place?  No eye has seen or ear has heard of the world made to honor the soul. But life is not a pure thing or an absolute -there are variances to good and bad and the senses are weak it can't see.  So I 'see' differently I would know more clearly. My cries of the soul that can't be distracted by the flashing brilliance of the world the beauty only skin deep will not faze me anymore I will be picky for the real beauty that is in a person in touch with their soul and consciousness grappling to stay here and wanting to move on full of health and life and understanding of the imprints of the thoughts and the inconsistency of man and his acts when justice is not served the ability to be totally unamazed that black is judged as white and one is locked away unfairly.  So when it happens to me I won't be ashamed for myself I'll be ashamed for those who act on external knowing and cares -not connected to their soul- their god -haphazardly moving from one sale to the other not thinking about why they have to drive cars and sit in traffic working in order to drive to work unsatisfied with the purpose of making widgets -collecting information, harboring information, organizing information, injecting information into their veins getting totally high off of the rush of words and meshing the names into a force that blasts apart all inner voices and guidance for we fear the long silence and the missed opportunity to buy cheap while caring not at all that we crack the whips at the backs of people with out any connection to us for could we look them in the eye at all and say thank you for green cashmere sweaters or tight ass blue jeans that make me look so hot that girls will want to make out with me because I only fear not getting laid and when I'm old Viagra will ensure my virility but lower my love of a person for whom I have sex with.  But that little kid with broken hands and no free Lasik surgery for the myopia eyes originating from the American diet for which we pass around the world like the plate of cheese at our socials that take up the space in our empty lives of mass consumption and broken hearts do not mend over warm cups of coffee they only mend when they say I'm sorry for leaving my petroleum in the yard, the chemicals in the air, for your body and my painted food, and to prove my contrition I'll dismantle the car and find another way to get around and I'll grow my own food and while I'm at it I'll find purpose and have useful energy and make funny friends and I'll be a real person loving the hand that feeds me and giving more than money to the people that need help.  Racing to the top will be seen as running away from the earth and the love it gives to each and every soul unconditionally.  Love from the earth is unconditional not choosing to love just the beautiful, not having pity on the weak, just the same giving wisdom to people who hid the legacy from one another and place the love that isn't in a book on a tree averting our attention to the sin and rope of the unloved and corrupt and you realize that the dominos fell a long time ago and when it is on a roll you will fall too but the fall is more than just your purpose and the inner life will cry out and drive you mad and in death there will be silence for the dark souls and they will come back and the selfless and you too goody-two-shoe once wronged a man and broke a child and so you are back to do good.  We have all killed ourselves and so we honor those lives we meet by giving our own deep heart and not being closed minded and wretched.

      Hey Megan  When it rains here people are frustrated and relieved.  The area hasn't been getting enough rain so everything, mostly the lakes, are drying up.  There are water restrictions allowing people to only water their lawns on Wednesday and Saturday.  So of course everyone is praying for more rain, but what a bitch that it rains on Wednesday or Saturday because that was the day that  I  was supposed to water  my  yard.  And there's the rub Megan, for people who are in such a routine, or the routine is their meaning in life, that even when something good happens, something painfully necessary, they don't want it if its not at the right time.  My life has been improving.  I've been working on rising out of my funk, my work is constantly running into roadblocks.  My summer consisted of school (anatomy/physiology) and two jobs, Personal Training and Pet Sitting.  My roommate Gene owns a business in Pet Sitting, www.vippetsitting.com, that I started working for in July for extra cash.  Its ok, really, I like seeing pets throughout the day.  I guess its good animal energy in my life.  About this same time, Gene's girlfriend moved in, which basically means one thing, they will get married.  Shawn, is 35 and Gene is 34, so its that age for people to get hitched.  Surprisingly, they wanted me to stick around and make me part of the house.  Gene truly appreciates me and I care much about him.  There is this ridiculous humor about him that cracks me up and gives me the giggles.  I think he likes having someone around to joke with.  Shawn is starting to like me, perhaps because of my sensitive side.  I tell her how I like what she has done with the house (very "girlish" but this place is shaping into a home).  I have met both sets of parents and I think they approve of me too, which is surprising because I feel I have some shy tendencies that could be affront to someone else.  I honestly stay very busy and your letter made me think about how I don't like that .  For example -what am I reading and thinking about?  I read science stuff (school related) and nutrition.  I think about what it will take in order for  me to pay my bills and keep me from stressing about being poor.  Your letter inspired me to exam my life a little.  So for kicks I picked up a book that wasn't so grounded in the here and now, in the present senses of sight, but more emotional in text, like Of Human Bondage, by W. Somerset Maugham.  It is very good.  I like these books, but the simple pleasures are easily forgotten when life is turning at a mile a minute.  Just so you know, there are times when you won't read, or write, or ponder or grow in your scholastic way, and its ok.   When you feel too smart for your own good, remember that there are people who run labs and heal people.  But you megan can do whatever you set your mind to, of course if the path is blocked, that will be a tad difficult to travel.   Anyway, some thoughts of mine from your letter.  I have never tried to make a point or conclude that I became a Christian because of you.  I have thought, though, I stopped being a Christian for a girl, but that isn't a real answer and unfair to say all that I believed and cherished -everything I did so fervently- could be toppled by one girl.  When the truth is that many factors played on that change in me.  Your brother Jason fascinates me.  Even more, the two of you talking fascinates me.  I wonder what you ask him and what you say when his reply is so different (or the same) to what you live around.  You seem frustrated, is this the case?  Let me tell you that a boy can get terribly wounded.  My insecurity has been growing lately.  I realize that I am struggling only when that girl Kim calls.  Nothing going on, but when I was such a good friend to her and now it is gone, I realize an empty spot.  Why is it so hard to strike up a friendship with a girl?  It is the only way something powerful, meaningful will ever develop.  My grandma says I'm just insecure, unconfident and that I'm letting some family thing get to me.  But I meet girls or attract girls easily.  However, I feel they just want me for my looks or body or whatever.  I don't know of a decent 'girl' that wants to get to know me that I also think I can trust.  So your question about the 'Christian girl', I haven't seen her much, but its not worth the effort when I know how I can and want to be.  I'm still growing up and figuring things out, but as one friend told me, guys don't realize that the girl gets a piece of you too.  So I can flirt and be very confident about me, but at the end of the day I go home and plan the next day and do the things to get me out of this position I'm in, so when I'm 26, 27 I won't feel behind the 8-ball and can take care of a woman that I can be friends with and grow with.  --What a feel good thought all that is, but what is my reality, megan?  Reality is that I have 20, 30, 40, 50 year old women that would love to take a bite out of me, but for better judgment they don't.  It's fun to flirt, but you know what, I wish they would.  That is a pathetic but true feeling I have.  However short term, I wish these ladies I know and talk to would make a move, but they won't because I won't also egg that crap on.  I wish my world was filled with just friends, but sex is hanging over me and I miss it.    Maybe you know what sex is like, maybe not.  I don't assume anymore because I have seen married women come on to me, Christian girls -whatever- nothing is as it seems.  Generalizations are not good ways to think.  There are no blanket statements.  You can't be solved by me just because of your family, school, friends, age, sex, religion - you may not be able to solve yourself.  You wake up and think about doing something that yesterday you swore you wouldn't think of again.  But life will rain on you when its 'time' to water your yard and you will have to do something else when it rains on your parade, or else I'll come by your home, see the sprinkler system on and take you as a joke.

      DAD  I don’t need you  To help me feel alive The man inside comes out By his own rite You don’t see how The love is gone You don’t pretend To want to know  I cry over you  Or at least I did You never gave yourself  A chance to feel me When did you reach out to me?   Why would have I seen It? How could I tell?  What makes the heart break  makes the pain sting, inside And pushes the tears out  But I put myself  In a vulnerable place At the disposal of Your deserted emotions I would find you –come to you Hoping you would look for me And I was satisfied by Finding you; seeing you But I don’t know why  It never seemed important Enough to you Because now it doesn’t seem Important enough to me I won’t be strung along Or hurt by my own expectations  of what you should be.  Do what you need to do. I’ll accept that little you have  and give in like manner  no longer hurting myself wishing you would give more.

      In the beginning of the trip, as the sun began to appear over the pines and maple trees, Fletcher’s emotions were about as mixed up as his favorite pancake matter, complete with extra wheat germ.  He had just said goodbye to his old client JB and for the first time during the days preceding his move he had cried.  Jonathan was with his partner, M, and there excitement and love was just too much to look at and not realize what was happening; he was leaving.  Jonathan made him some eggs and toast with a tall class of juice and Fletcher found himself saying out loud, “Is this happening?”  The experience was a dream.  Here he was having breakfast made by J, like many times before, but this event would not be happening again anytime soon.  Within a day Fletcher would be about 800 miles and 7 states away.  But that was the point of leaving; He would be away from  there .  So what was there that scared the hell out of Fletcher?  Well, hell, in the theoretical sense was not a problem for him anymore.  He had given up that scare tactic and idea years ago.  No, what was happening in Durham was a mixture of an embrace from a straight jacket and the tiling before the planting of a seed.  Or perhaps it was best thought of as the parable from jesus and the seed that fell on rocky soil.  Fletcher was ready to grow, but if he was unleashed here, he would sprout with no root system and squelch in the sun.    Less than a year before, the idea occurred to Fletcher to go somewhere else.  Around September, when money became about as hard to find as a Nun in full garb in downtown Carrboro (except perhaps on Halloween) Fletcher had feelings things for him, a life for him was not to be found in NC.  So he thought a lot about going home, home to Indiana.  He even visited in late September, mostly for the chance to see his good friend ZW and some other friends at BS’s wedding to BB.  But when he was there he thought about moving back.  He asked questions about the job market and even pinned down a promise with Bob that he would have a job if he moved back.  The town seemed to have relaxed like a pillow to cushion the fall that Fletcher knew was about to occur back in NC.  His landlord Gene was going to have to give him sometime to pay rent so he could find another job.  The strain in the house only grew with the extension of grace from Gene on rent.  Not from Gene, Fletcher never really felt it from him as a source, but from Shaun.  This mid-30s couple was just hell-bent on getting married and Fletcher knew that his welcome was wearing out.   The talks of moving out, the day to move out, was pushed further and further away from the present moment of absolute emptiness in Fletcher’s life.  He was trying to find solace in a new acquired friend, Dave.  He was also from Chapel Hill, graduated from the school and so Fletcher had an immediate buddy.  In a sad way, Fletcher didn’t know much of anything about Chapel Hill and the bars on Franklin Street.  He had barely even been on the street to do any drinking back during his recently passed college years.  Well, he had gone and seen a movie at the Varsity once.  So David was a way for Fletcher to learn Franklin Street.  Perhaps there was something he was missing there, and once he found it, all the confusion of the Dark Times, the poor times, the eating eggs as the only source of protein times, would somehow just change, like the wind blowing over a leaf reveling the concealed shiny side.  The nights became really long during those times with David.  He would return home just dizzy drunk, or just crash out on David’s couch.  What was happening?  Just drinking and looking for women.  Neither one had any luck, at least in Chapel Hill.  So when David couldn’t deliver or be a conspirator to Fletcher picking up a girl, Fletcher called his brothers and went to Raleigh.   And once he got there, He would take some shots of Tequila in his car and then go meet his brothers at the bar, usually Bogart’s.  Being in Raleigh was like walking up to the plate and the ball from the pitcher is moving slower and looks bigger and on every swing the ball hits the sweet spot.  Fletcher was in the zone.  Every time he went out, he would find some girl to kiss or get a number.  He would go out by himself and pick someone up without even doing anything but standing around watching Sportscenter.  The seduction of women and the allure he had on them was becoming a real powerful realization in his personality.  At times he was seeking something innocent, a girl to fall in love with perhaps.  But if the girl he meet lived in Raleigh then there was not hope for something to materialize.  The one girl that could have been a potential candidate couldn’t ever return a call on time making Fletcher assume the worst.  Without fail for about 2 months she would call on the last possible day before Fletcher dumped her to the recesses or waste heap of girls that I once met in Raleigh.  On a last ditch effort, Fletcher accepted her call on New Year’s eve.  He was still sad, just moping around about a recent girl that broke his little bit of fragile hope in an innocent girl and love.  They went out, drank, kissed, got naked and then Fletcher pulled away. She was not happy but Fletcher was beginning to sense something:  he didn’t want a commitment.   In October Fletcher found a third job, and the pet sitting job really picked up around the winter holidays, so much so that Fletcher paid Gene off of all bills and moved into his own apartment a week before Christmas.  He began to settle into the idea that he would be here for a while.  The realization came to him that he really loved nutrition and that he could get his RD status from Central, the historically black college, within 2 ½ years.  With the idea of being grounded in Durham for that much longer, the entertained thoughts of love should have arisen, but they didn’t.  With three jobs taking up 12-12 ½ hours of his day, there was no time to give to anyone, but himself.   The need for a girl grew and manifested itself with a perspective of him as a toy for them.  That pull he had began to be used for that need, which was a need for touch, or affection.  However he went through dry times, dark times of just working his ass off and hating his life.  An accident occurred and he felt that push from the semi pushing his car and crunching him into the median.  Sitting in the car waiting for the police sentence, cold, wet and broken, his spirit began to feel the push in a different way.  He was not crushed, or dented, but he yielded to the push and the force was strong enough to push him away from there.  It was no accident that the next day he had found Bastyr and Seattle.  With a new place live, the vigor returned.  He visited the school and town within the month and within a day of being there, he knew the decision was made.  It didn’t hurt that he also got laid while he was there, which broke a 6 month streak.  He didn’t expect to even talk to that girl again, and that was after the first night they met.  But he called her the next day.  They hung out, shopped a little, had dinner and returned to his hotel room.  In the background was Moon Struck; in the bed was a slow test of who wanted to do what?  Would it mean anything?  Who had done this before?  The questions were answered quickly and once the voice lingered off into the background, the bodies of passion finished the questions and pushed it further toward a completion.    Why is it that people think they don’t act like animals?  The moment a decision to leave Durham was made, girls were not hard to find.  Perhaps there was this pheromone released that other girls could pickup on every time he went out.  The first weekend back, Fletcher is out with his brothers, Jon and Bryan.  There are some other girls out, but one in particular was just gorgeous to Fletcher.  This was Jon’s dance partner from last year (and they are professional dancers) but she was warming up to him.  Of course he could turn her as the night wore on. The bros each had someone to talk to, as naturally as the couple’s paired off, they would end up together…and so they did in her car.  Perhaps there were really only three significant things about this girl to remember.  One she was 38, and as such the oldest person Fletcher had kissed sexually.  Two, she played J. Lo music and that just seemed like a wonderful touch to Fletcher.  Three, she had fake breasts (no way a 38 year old had breasts that firm).  What was wrong about this girl was the refusal on her part to let him crash on the floor, at least.  So driving home at 3:00 am the inevitable happened, Fletcher was falling asleep at the wheel.  But, his cell phone rang.  He answered it but it was broken up and cut short.  A couple of minutes later it rang again and this time it was her, the girl from Seattle, Kelly.  And she does what was already agreed upon not to do, ask details.  So like the tired semi-drunk guy he was, Fletcher said he kissed on some girl and her response was “Oh, that’s just great for you!”    She was there, he was still here.   The feeling would surface later during their phone conversations about her significance.  Was she special?  Was it just a moment?  At work when his coworkers would pick on him and the eventual marriage to the girl he became really confused and then scared.  Scared of being tied down and repressed in a new big city, a city with a lot more girls than Durham, Raleigh, and Chapel Hill put together.  But if she was, wouldn’t that be nice?  Well, no it wasn’t worth chancing.  Fletcher made it clear that any future happenings between them, physical or practical (or aren’t they the same?) would be as friends and nothing more.  No thoughts of possibilities, just the moment.     The “moment” was that elusive energy that arose from the connection of two people and their desire for it.  It would lift you up and hold you like water does the buoy.  And Fletcher had a way of creating the dark matter, or dark energy that would intoxicate a proper recipient.  His appeal was more apparent when in one night he kissed 2 women (one married) and got 3 numbers.  One of the girls came from Penn and lived in Greensboro.  She was very pretty, but lived to far away.  And besides, she was still looking for something innocent; Fletcher had moved on to a new realm.  He had become sure of himself and all his glory.  What was needed was a moment and by definition that meant there had to be someone else, and that they wanted it too.  When you look at a happy couple of 30-40 years and condense the love of that you get the moment.  He couldn’t handle the idea of a stretched out love over years because there are no promises that after 25 years she won’t leave you with nothing but half the shit.  It became easier to just take the ‘pill’ form of a long content life.  And the dose came in unsatisfactory flavors.  The girls that appeared after that night of charm were ill fitting stand-ins for what Fletcher really wanted.  He knew the facts of the situation and the girls did too:  He wasn’t going to be around much longer.  So there was no other thing to do but enjoy the present.  There was no moment with those girls.  He was with them for that time, and that was all.  Fletcher was turning a corner soon but it seemed that he had already been around this block because he ran into an opportunity, an old opportunity.  When the details became clearer about departure from Durham and need of arrival in Seattle, Fletcher realized he had sometime.  So he figured he would quit his jobs early, take a little bit of time getting across the country and hang out with Kelly, since there were lines drawn (though he was unsure if they would be crossed).   The time getting across the country would be taken up by his family in Indiana that was until he turned the corner.  Her name was Megan.  Years ago the name conveyed a girl he loved that he couldn’t have.  A Holy Grail.  Now she was mature, a free thinker and needing some comfort.  Fletcher was a comfort for her, and to his half-surprise, she was a comfort to him.  Well, she asked him to visit her but he declined, said there wasn’t enough time and it was out of the way.  They talked about it more and she wrote him an email that changed his plans.  Without any love in his life, no home, or job, and a desire to see the little girl that caused so much grief and curiosity in his life, Fletcher decided to visit Megan.  He was honest to her “I want to kiss you”, but he was nervous about what he would find out by being near her again.  There were questions about faith she was dealing with; ones that he dealt with that froze him because he didn’t want to say anything that might ruin the time with her.  All he wanted was to enjoy the time with her.  There was never a time before like the time that Boston afforded.  She lived on her own and was enjoying her own friends and ideas.  They would get to drink together, cuss together, smoke together and these were certainties.  But Fletcher wondered about more, like sexually things.  He imagined her having an orgasm as he went down on her.  Would she touch him?  The daydreams seemed silly after awhile and it became more realistic to wonder if it would even feel right to see her again.  And if they kissed would it be a “kissing my sister” emotionless thing.  The possibility of nothing happening was a huge fear.  He would rather wonder the rest of his life that there was something magical between them than find out that there was more solidness in the clouds that portrayed dreams.    The timing was off.  On the day of his arrival to Boston, Fletcher was 15 minutes early and had to call Megan home.  In the little spot of Beverly, she was only a few blocks away and called him to meet her at the library.  With the directions to memory he walked that way and then had a call, from her.  “Hey, are you wearing a black shirt?”  “Yes…where are y….”   She was just ahead on the sidewalk.  Her hair was the first thing he noticed.  It was limp and straight on the sides of her face.  Her figure and gait was as he remembered, so he was not taken aback by any weight gain.  No matter what, it fit her, and on the hug, no doubt it was Megan.  An afternoon ensued of driving around Boston, getting lunch and just checking out sites.  It was a different time and place, but familiar feelings.  Fletcher, who had come there rather reserved and patient felt something for Megan.  In the evening, as her house was filling up with people, Fletcher made a break through that he could hang out with her Christian friends because they could laugh about the same stuff. Megan and Fletcher went to get a movie and toilet paper.  In the grocery store Fletcher walked slower, behind Megan.  She wanted him to walk by her side, but he just dragged along as a feeling was building up in him.  He clutched her tightly after picking up the Charmin and said “oh Nothing” to her inquiry of “What?”   In that second, it was clear that Fletcher wanted this time with Megan to be a moment and he assumed, before they made it to the car, that she did too.  So before he went stark raving mad, and they made it back to the house, he desperately said “Will you just kiss me, I can’t stand it anymore.”  In the parking lot of some school with other people mulling about, they kissed.  The first time since 1997 and unlike that last kiss, this kiss was stirring.  The stage was set for an extended moment between two friends.    The next day a group of Megan’s friends left, three girls that had been sleeping in her room. Fletcher slept on the couch next to a couch that had a guy snoring so loud he couldn’t sleep.  Once the girls left though, Megan’s room was empty.  Without communicating, Fletcher went into her room, sat on the bed, looked at the books on her shelf and waited for her to return.  She entered the room and after rummaging around crawled under the covers and closed her eyes.  There was a big lack of sleep the night before, but Fletcher understood as clearly as she did that this was what both wanted to experience on this visit.  How would he feel in my arms?  Would she be comfortable with me, would she embrace me?  Reasonable enough questions for both of these kids to ask about an old boy/girlfriend.  However, it was the answers that threw things for a loop.  The plan for that Sunday was to see Harvard and Boston.  They were not in any hurry.  Being in bed with Megan was like nothing he had experienced.  It had little to do with the physical as it did with the emotional.  Fletcher felt more passion from Megan than anyone he had been with before.  There was no guilt.  Neither one had to look over their shoulders.  Perhaps he was fooled, but he sensed something deep from her rising up and clutching him to her body.  He even considered it being spiritual.  Their kissing was riveting and they would linger to each other’s mouths wanting to touch and taste more of each other, drawing in long breaths, drinking it in.  They were present in the moment and then went to Harvard.  With the apparent first hurdle cleared, Fletcher thought that the trip could be no better.  He felt the love, knew that she was good and the next morning he would leave and live his life without a change.  But in the Boston public, something happened.  They always got along well.  She would make gestures or hand him things and without thinking he would take them.  They cooperated well.  But there is nothing like the presence of a stranger to validate the obvious that neither wants to realize.  So they get on the subway on their way to Harvard and both notice a guy eyeballing them both with a look of surprise: he was mesmerized.  On the way up the stairs out of the tunnel the comment was hinted at, but Megan knew that Fletcher thought they looked great together, and that strange dude made it clear they did too.  They walked around Harvard talked about Megan’s future and possibility of attending school there and went downtown.  Downtown was packed with people.  It was a beautiful day and people were everywhere.  They bought coffee and shared some thoughts and met up with Megan’s roommate from Gordon, Karen.  The introduction was priceless.   “Fletcher, Karen, Karen, Fletcher.”  To Karen “That pretty much says it all” or was it “Speaks for itself” Either way Fletcher blushed but appreciated the vocal complement.   They walked and talked for the next 2, 3, 4 hours.  Took some memorable pictures and shared a bottle of wine at dinner in the Northend.  Karen left, after Fletcher shared some feelings about Megan in a very candid conversation.  He thought he showed too many of his cards.  Over a couple of draft beers, Fletcher began to tell a story about his transition from faith in Jesus Christ to his present condition of being ‘spiritual’.  Megan smoked a cigarette, Fletcher took a couple of puffs and the story was short, but it contained a huge revelation, something Fletcher himself didn’t realize until then.  Megan was asking questions of faith and morals; not too different from what Fletcher did two years ago.  With his perceptive eye the idea came to that perhaps she would fall like he did, and if so he wanted to catch her, be there for her.  And he said to her that he wanted her to fall, because he wanted her.  He wanted her like him because he couldn’t be with someone so closed minded as the typical Christian was.  She showed promise though and he wanted to believe that perhaps they could be together, even if they really couldn’t.  Fletcher drove home.  It was cute to him seeing Megan a little drunk.  He wanted to kiss her mouth and taste the smoke on her breath.  He wanted to touch her, but she retracted.  He didn’t push it and felt fine just feeling her pull his head to her so she could kiss him.  Fletcher massaged her hands and shoulders.  He relaxed her and he was calm feeling the warmth of her body.  That night they slept together for the first time.  The bed was just a twin and way too small, but sleep wasn’t all that important.  Fletcher decided to just hangout the next day as Megan went to work.  He chatted with her roommates and friends that passed through her home like a bank with a revolving door.  And like a bank all came to deposit something or withdraw something.  Sometimes it was emotional and sometimes it was for food.  They even had a landlord that took a weed eater to the yard, since a lawnmower wasn’t necessary for an 8 x 8 yard with missed placed weeds as ‘grasses.  Karen came over later that afternoon to take Fletcher to the mall, get some food and ask him questions about why he was there.  Did he come just to kiss Megan?  What would be the point of that?  He could kiss any girl, but it was Megan after all, and to him that was special.  But he came to see Boston, to talk to Megan face to face, show that he cared and if it could be possible, enjoy the moment.  Karen and Fletcher met up with Megan and a guy working with Megan name Jon.  Jon was funny.  There was just no way that this guy could be serious and usually he wasn’t.  He was an actor and a play writer.  The ideas he had challenged the norm in the Christian world, and he liked being the antagonist.  He showed Fletcher a lot of promise and he told him so.  Megan dropped the guy off, picked up a housemate and they went home.  There was only one night left and what were they going to do?  They went to an ABC store to buy liquor, a bottle of wine for David the housemate and a pint of Amoretto for herself, “its candy alcohol.”  Fletcher was mesmerized by the new traits and actions that Megan had.  They talked over pizza at dinner and when she rose to get a cup to drink the Amoretto with before they went home, Fletcher caught a glance of sexiness.  She pivoted on her right foot and when her butt turned, Fletcher knew then he wanted to take her home.  It was getting dark and they drove to a park and, well, parked.  They drank Amoretto and kissed while listening to music.  She was good, thinking, lowering her driver’s seat all the way down making it easier for him to float above her, kissing her yummy lips and he found his hand going down, under her pants but she stopped him.  “You love me for it” and In a way he did like it that she stopped him, but he wanted her.  Her smell and the way she communicated her wants, even if they where to stop him just excited him.  He hated guessing what a girl wanted from him or for herself, but Megan knew what she wanted.    She was beginning to sense the moment more and more as they settled in her bed.  She read a story that was good, but being talked to sleep was one of Fletcher’s ultimate weaknesses and so he fell asleep.  Coming to after the story Fletcher knew he had let her down but she enjoyed herself by acting annoyed so he would cling and touch her skin, pressing through to her muscles and moving her to a place that she hadn’t felt for years.  They fought the sleep, again and again returning to each other’s lips, intoxicating each other until sleep came late in the night.  In the morning, before the alarm clock went off they laid by each other, Fletcher’s head around her shoulder, perfect place to whisper drops of affection.  “I have a song in my head.”   “Back to you, it always comes around, Back to you.  There is something about you, it’s just the way you move, the way you move me.”  But rather than being silent, like he had crossed a line with his sentimental voice, she came back with, “You are fun to touch” and it was true.  Her touch was passing energy through him like a massage.  And he began to melt and wish he didn’t have to leave, though the need to go was so important to him and his future.  Karen had made a comment to that, “you never know stranger things have happened.”  What would they do?  How crazy to wonder about it; them being together?  In less than a week they would be 3000 miles apart, what the hell was the point of getting all emotional?  But there they were looking into each other’s eyes before they said goodbye, seeing oceans.

      Over Xmas I became extremely fixated on F.K. (again, this fixation has happened before).  I woke up in the night from a dream about possibly being able to reach out to her and bring her back into my life.  Like we had something great back in the dorm Ehringhaus -so my memory had me enthralled into believing and remembering. But I was enraptured into planning on how I would try and get in touch with her once I got back home.  Inevitably I did call.  The first call was something of a hope that the weight of the world would be removed from my shoulders.  Knowing that school wasn't in session I dialed her number and just like I thought I got the answering machine, but my reason for calling was not left on the answering machine.  I never leave messages on answering machines anyway, except when I do my job at the gym.  So after that first call I thought this pursuit for a long lost time and event- not necessarily the girl Far--- as much as for the chance to rectify my standing that had probably long crumbled, would vapor away, but it remained strong like a vice and I had to call her repeatedly.  I thought that she or H------ would freak out once they saw their caller id, with about five calls from a "gene c------  489-****", but on a Friday, midmorning, roads too bad to drive on from snowfall, I got in touch with Far--- for the 1st time since August.  All the imagined conversations I had already had with her couldn't match the one I did have with her.  Once I identified myself, I was hit with a "What's new?"  Weakly I said "I stopped going to church" and I only say it was weakly because I think I could have, no, I wanted to just tell her that what I used believe hand changed.  God, if I could just erase the terrible memory of pounding my fanatic faith at her and effectively punching myself in the stomach and her away.  I used to be so sick over that girl, I mean sick.  I would listen for her steps on the dorm balcony and know when they where hers.  I would study on the floor she worked on in the library so I could run into her.  Every girl I saw with a pony tail and brown hair reminded me of her.  I was sick and crazy for her.  Perhaps in a round about way I lost my faith because of her.  That's quite a responsibility to throw on somebody, but her skepticism about religion, Christianity, began to erode away at my own beliefs about the world and my faith in Jesus.  Yet, once it was over, that is, once she said, "We are going in two different directions," I think it was then that I wanted to go in the same direction as her.  She was a strong, poking, intelligent person and I couldn't imagine meeting someone else like her.  Such good times we had, me the pursuer and her the flee-er.  But I won, at sometime in our hide-and-seek, out of all the girls I could have, I choose her and she accepted, much to my surprise and joy.  But I was torn, bitterly and wrenchedly between my "friend" matt b., who exhorted the Christian "don't be unequally yoked" and I believed him and the Bible.    Back then, this is what I told her and showed, I was never as open and honest about my faith than with her in all my life.  I showed her verse and chapter on my yellow Goodwill purchased couch.  And I was happy she didn't turn then, but later she did and I hurt bad with regret because I really drove her away.  During this conversation I explained my change of heart in Christianity without the deep specifics and she seemed very interested, in a "good for you" sort of way.  But after some jolly laughs and pestering comments, it was time to say goodbye.  She said 'call me' again and I jumped to asking her out for lunch or a drink.    I was so happy -I made a connection with Far---, my long lost soul mate (which essentially I'm thinking this).  Two days later I think I blow it, yet it was as inevitable as the Great Gatsby, which I was reading during these days.  The story The Great Gatsby mirrored my own life.  Gatsby pursued an old, short lived bright flame that snuffed out once the wick that it lived on was spent.  And his pursuant destroyed him.  He did nothing that didn't lead him to that all too glorious dream of being with Daisy again.  Well, Far--- began to turn into a Daisy for me and in my excitement of being so near to her, I called two days later and lost my cool.  "Not much has changed in two days" she said.  I stumbled for words, something to say.  "Well, I was thinking about you and didn't think you had anyone to talk to, unless you know your neighbors that live around you."  -This was more of a confession than an actual thought. I was the lonely one and by the end of the conversation she had flexed her individual might at my attempt to reconnect with something disassembled and I think I communicated to her that I could be whipped.    She toyed with me and didn't have the energy to mess with me anymore (like I know her state of patience to be last year) so she broke it away in a fast good-bye, click and no mention for me to call her back.    Then there was just the hum of a computer and a long Sunday night ahead for me to grow more and more enraged with myself for actually thinking I could make a leap back in time.  The reality of the situation was painfully obvious to me during the moments following the talk.  So I left the house and did the one thing that I am realizing gives me pure joy and surreal experiences for my isolated existence and mind -working-out.  I go and do my workout with anger and fear, fear that someone would see my wounds, busted open again.  To deter looks and hind I wore a hat tight and low around my face and I went to WG where I would not be a FW employee but another person working-out.  I was satisfied, tired and went home, only that I was nice to Kelly, or at least made a gesture of cordiality (I gave up a good treadmill so Kelly could run on it)  "your welcome" I said and moved on.  That Sunday Night I finished the Great Gatsby and saw what a fanatic life would do. It was awful that Jay didn't know anyone, didn't see the need to know anyone.  He wanted to realize his dream in a vacuum, in a far off place where no one could reach him.  He had the parts pieced together but one, he didn't have Daisy and the years had removed him from her and nothing, not even the glamour he adored, could make a last midget in Daisy's commitment to Tom.  This taught me something.  I learned that if I let my fantasies get the best of me then I too would be gone in the deep end.  With new found resolve to venture and learn in this world, other than what can be done in a relationship, I go through my workday looking forward to that time that I could workout.  And then it came and went.  By the time I was gone from the gym I was more puffed up than a farm roaster in front of the hen house and I felt great.  I floated through the gym, in front of members whose glances and flashing eyes said more than words could communicate, unless it was a girl saying "Man Fletch, you're Jacked!"  I'm lingering around and as I spied on a girl that is the most amazing young girl I have seen in the club I realized something; I was untouchable.  This presence and the self awareness of it (most certainly) hadn't been there before, but as I saw this girl, who avoided eye contact and conversation with pretty much anybody (though she could attract anyone) I felt something transverse the space between us and I become untouchable.  No man could threaten me and no girl could whip me.  I was my own man free from earth's laws, suspended before air and I wanted to stay that way (though all things do fall).  Something told me that I could have control and the right girl would come to me and then I would pursue.  Live the life of now, not the life of the past.  It's not easy to be in the present.  Far---- and I will probably never see each other again, but I don't think I would mind if we did.

      You Knocked my plant over You blew my house down You threw rain in my face You blew snow down my shirt You messed up my hair You turned the page of my book before I finished the page -again. You did nothing and I was hot as hell.  Then you were just right.  You pollunated the plants You hummed by the house You made the chime make beatiful unscripted music You made the snow form chilly stealthish banks You made the hot day cooler You made all things stronger.

      from the Denver Post Kobe Bryant Gives the Facial and Wins the Case by Bob Sporty  In the trial that has become the watershed for all further cases involving superstars and lying beat-up women, Kobe Bryant was found innocent of all charges of sexual abuse by his accusing hussy, Kimberly Girth.  This verdict however did not surprise anyone in the court, since three weeks ago Kobe Bryant lead the Lakers to their fourth NBA title in five years, many have been outspoken that someone that glides through the air and makes key 3-point buckets could never beat up some two-beat tramp because they don't need to fight and plead for sex.  Kobe's attorney, speaking on behalf of his client said, "Today, Kobe Bryant has proved to everyone that having rough sex is not a federal crime."  Evidence in the case turned on text messages that once believed to be erased where uncovered by AT&T techies.  These text messages, sent after the incident, protrayed a bitch that just got big nasty from a black dude.  Later testimony, from a jealous boyfriend didn't fair well for Mrs. Girth's case.  Though medical records showed that perhaps she was beaten up by both Kobe and her ex-boyfriend, the winnings that everyone recieved from gambling on the Lakers seemed to out weigh justice being served.  Mrs. Girth's attorney planed an appeal.  "We are deeply troubled today, and so should our country, because sport stars are given preferential treatment they don't deserve."     Outside the scene was a carnival scene, with women's right activist and Kobe Bryant supports jostling over the verdict.  Susan Meanie, from the National Organization for Women (NOW), came from Boston, MA to protest.  "We are deeply troubled that a guy who plays sports really well can become bigger than the justice system."   Many women, though, expressed different opinions in the crowds.   Alexia Ray, self-proclaimed NBA groupie said, "That girl should be greatful.  Her problem was that she just wasn't good in bed.  I don't blame Kobe for anything."   In what was the most surprising follow-up to the verdict, Kobe Bryant's wife was seen wearing a spaghetti-strap shirt imprinted with a glass of orange juice that read, "Thanks to OJ, I'm able to walk free."

      I read an article in the wall street journal today and it persuaded me to start doing a blog.  Usually I have lots on my mind so this should be fun to have as an outlet.  Look forward to lots of postings, most from a journal that is from the last couple of years.  later.

      Have you ever sat in an empty field?  It feels like being in the middle of an ocean -looking around and seeing nothing different as far as the eye can see.  Walking through a cornfield makes me feel the same way -lost.    So I wonder to the middle of a field and image I'm hovering over the ocean to face my situation.  Trying not to be scared, trying to focus on floating.  I'm sensing confusion forming, losing, lost in my thoughts.  I act brave -I move courageously but I have fear -its painted on my skin and wrapped around my tepee.  It stares at me everytime I try to go inside my tepee, inside my heart.  There is warmth inside the tepee, there is faith in my heart.  I try not to be scared of faith -I'm looking into the cosmos and seeing the life for me, not happening with me.    And I'm absent -where is me?  Who is me?  She makes me feel different -you make me feel different -Who makes me feel like me?  (the answer is up to me)  In the field, there is space, but its not empty.  The essence of the space is god and the energy contracts around me and my space.  The energy from me expands to fill out the space, and then I retract to feel the space.  I'm lost in the space.  I can only be found in the space.

      I have this warm feeling and I can't sleep The darkness lets my mind see you you are fearless and bright The light warms me and I can't sleep  When can you be near me Our auras mixing together colors blending in swirls blown by the Wind pushing you near me giving me this warm feeling and I can't sleep

      I chased a girl down and up the stairs.  I felt silly for I would catch the lovely flower only to let her go and go she did.  But I haven't forgotten her and much I still wonder about; about her and missing myself in love and in pursuit of her.  I wonder about love with someone and I think there is a woman somewhere tonight that I will someday meet and be enraptured with.  She may be thinking about me and doing the samething I'm doing; writing about a future love.  But I can feel her love in my heart.  She's not beyond me.  She's similar in passion and beauty.  A raven haired, perhaps out casting shadows with her being.  Flowing from my dreams I'll find her in a marketplace finding the fruit of the Garden together and the knowledge shall be made for our liberation from Eden into the banishment that will be us together for God will watch over us granting favor in the toil of existence, with health and wonder in the life that reigns around us - relationship to all things by the creation.  Filling each other up from the taking of food, imparting it to us for the melding of our bodies into one.  Returning to the earth we'll depart from the body and play in the space that is in all things, where God resides, playing forever
