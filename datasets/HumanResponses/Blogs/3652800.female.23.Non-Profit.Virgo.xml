      Did I say that I'm a homemaker earlier? Well, not really though.. I washed clothes only twice a week. Rarely cooks (although I like cooking so much!!Trust me!), I have only a room to clean up too, and I'm expecting a baby in NOvember.. which means... I'm not taking care of any baby right now. So why did I call myself a homemaker? what else should I call myself then? Maybe it's because due to the fact that I'm living with my mother-in-law right now. It will be a whole different story if we live on our own. Lemme tell you, how many of you has a mak mertua who's really sporting, never nag nor fussy, wash your clothes, cook for you and can talk everything (I mean EVERYTHING!)with you? Don't envy me cause I'm having the best 'mak mertua' in the world! That's why I have nothing to do at home. I really love her as much as I love my own mother. I think she's gonna be my role model when I have my own baby soon. Dear, I never talk about this with you, right? I'm so blessed to have your mom as my m-i-l. She's sooo cool! Hmmmm.. dear will be back late again.. yesterday he came home at 10pm. Today, 9 something I guess. Since working at XM, his workload and working hours are massive!! I'm not complaining but sometimes I pity him.. Dear looks so tired everytime he gets home. I wish I could help.. but how? Tomorrow I'm goin' to my mom's at USJ.. She's lonely.. and I am lonely too..Thinking about what she's gonna cook for me.. Yum!

      Heyaa.. This is my first time blogging.. cause I have nothing else to do currently. I'm officially a homemaker now. Quit working my ass off for this lousy company for almost 4 months. Today is just another day.. Woke up when the alarm goes off. Actually the alarm clock was set by dearie.. He's the one going to work and I'm always the one waking up due to the horrible noise. Ha! We had our daily nasi lemak as usual.. Dear hugs and kisses me before he left.. which he never failed to do since we got married. Time for me to continue my 'beauty' sleep... My tummy is getting bigger.. Mama said the baby's gonna be big if I sleep too much during the day. Is that true?

      Just came back at 12.30pm last night from the ride to JB and Singapore. It was my first long ride since I got pregnant.It was as smooth as usual. Nothing's changed except for the fact that I can only wear ONE jeans..undone the first button or else I have nothing else comfy to wear. All of my HD tees looks so tight like "sarung nangka" but heck I'm not gonna buy new clothes that I'll be wearing for just few months!Oh yeah, we arrived at BBU around 1pm for Mui and Ain's wedding. Met Apek, ET, the new baby  at his mummy's place. We all had prepared empty stomach to enjoy the food at the wedding. And I must say the food was great! How many times have you been served Singapore's sup gear box in a wedding? Although it's not my favorite but watching dear and Apek indulge the red gravy along with the gear box thingy makes me really hungry. I had the usual nasi minyak along with the rojak... lai chee kang, kueh-mueh until I couldn't get up for the second helping. My tummy felt like a balloon, ha! The couple arrived around 3pm and Mui looks so different than usual! Everybody said that Ain looked like Bienda, the singer. They were clad in suit and gown this time.   Then we rode down to S'pore. Abg Apai and Kak Rozy had been waiting for us. At the S'pore's custom checkpoint, we were told to go into the office. Is it us or the bike? The Indian officer kept on saying " Aku tak tau, masuk dalam office, cerita" when dear asked him what went wrong. We were really shocked. Inside, we figured that there were only Malaysians. The officer just went through our passports, stamped it and hand it over to us. Hey!!! Why didn't they tell us that their computer screwed up?! Damn! After that incident, I don't think we're gonna use the Woodlands checkpoint anymore. We never had any problems using the Second Link. According to Abg Apai, it's easy to get to HOugang Ave 6. Dear did miss some turning but we manage to get there safely. It's good to see them again. Felt almost at home.

       I learned some life lessons today. Been talking to 2 German guys over the subject of kids and Malaysian driving ethics. These 2 guys mind you, are all enough to be my father and they were very wise and opiniated. Both divorced and have only one daughter from their marriage. Klause and TJ actually came to me and Kak Nori and all of sudden chatting from one topic to another after Kak Nori told them that I'm gonna have a baby. They said having a baby is a beautiful thing and the experience is something that you couldn't trade with anything else in this world.&nbsp; Suddenly I felt so touched by their words and a rush of joy came into my head. Wow! I can't wait to have this baby!!Malaysian men rarely talks obout the joy of having a baby, so deep with emotion and love that I almost cried. Klause talked with his eyes shined so bright and smile from ear to ear.Today I felt like everybody really cared about me. everyone I met at HD (these are leather clad bikers, mind you. Who would've thougt that they could be so sensitive) either adviced me or dear not to take me on hte Springer anymore. At least, be careful, extra careful. Yeah, you got that right, I'm still riding on the back of dear's Harley in my 6 months pregnancy. Call me crazy but we really know what we were doing. So, don't come to us, especially my dear Reza and say'Gila kau, bahaya bawak Zach naik moto mcm ni' He'd get so pissed off. Don't tell me I didn't warn you!  &nbsp;

       I'm having a hard time to sleep last night. There's some unusual pain in my tummy that makes me feel restless. Every position seems not right, I end up sleeping only after dusk.&nbsp; The consequence,&nbsp; both of us overslept. i woke up to find out that it's already 9am! Dear is obviously late!! He quickly search for his mobile and start sms'ing Shuvit.. The reason as usual, taking me up for a monthly check up. Haha! The check up is only due this Saturday. 'Aku jugak jadi alasan' and we laughed so hard thinking that who would've argue with that? The funny thing is that, despite the fact that he's already late, he still continue to sleep for another half an hour and I end up sleeping while sitting cause I'm worried that dear's gonna be really late. It's a cold morning, and sleeping seems perfect. Finally I&nbsp;can&nbsp; close my eyes and the pain slowly drifted in my sleep, but not for long as I begin to feel really hungry... Nasi lemak for breakfast and dear left me around 11. He'll probably will come home at 8pm tonight. What should I do now? Continue my sleep as I felt a bit dizzy from the lack of sleep, obviously.    I didn't realize that when I woke up it's already 5 pm!!! Wow! Macam vampire pulak. Blame it on the weather cause the sun didn't &nbsp;come &nbsp;out today, all&nbsp;I could feel is cold breeze and rain did poured heavily some time around 2. Ha!Excuses!Excuses!    Dear told me about this AVENT brand for baby's bottles, sterilizer and breast pump. How come he knows it better than me? Dear was talking about it with his colleague, and these products could prevent&nbsp;the baby from wind(masuk angin) and the best part.... the&nbsp;teats&nbsp;&nbsp;are made to look and feel like a real nipple!  We're gonna buy it from Ebay, better bargain.&nbsp;Nowadays you can get everything ( I really mean EVERYTHING, from Ebay.Who would've thought of that?)    I have this jitters on breastfeeding. I heard the first time could be really painful. Any tips from mothers out there? We're gonna enrol for ante-natal classes to prepare for the labour. Heard that it's gonna cost RM250 per 4sessions. Pricey eh?

       Yesterday I received a letter from Kementerian Pendidikan, which says that I'm accepted to sit for the MTeST exam on the 14th.  Hmmm..  ingatkan dah kena  blacklist. I didn't go for the last year's interview. This year is tougher and mama told me that 40,000 applied for the January 2005 intake. Last year, I didn't go because they won't allow you to get married when you enrol in the college. So, this time..  kena bawak perut pulak  for the test.  It will be in 9 days time and I couldn't find anything on the net to prepare for it.  Belasah je?  It's a good back up plan,  manalah tau  I won't be getting any decent job after  delivering my baby.   But, to be bound with 7 years contract of teaching is kinda too long! Is it worth it? 7 years is such a long time! Maybe I'm destined to be a teacher. All this while when people ask me why I didn't become a teacher, my answer would be , not interested. It's time to change my mind since I'll  be having a baby soon. Teaching means more time and  education privilege for my baby. I'm always scared of students who would think that I'm too small to be a teacher. Anyway, let's just keep our finger crossed. Hope that the 2 and a half hour test will run smooothly and I'll be called for the interview. Hopefully, the interview won't be scheduled on November.  Cikgu Zach?  Yeah, right!

       I hope I'm not living in a fairytale. ' though sometimes I feel like a loser not having a career like everybody else but I'm blessed with love all around me. I know what I might wrote next may make you all want to puke, but I don't care. Since I got married, life turns out to be such a bliss. I'm lucky to have a very loving hubby, who loves me unconditionally. This morning as dear's on his usual 'finding the right tee-shirt' (he's a designer, who had never wear office attire in his life!) routine, he asked me to find one for him. I laughed 'cause I know my choice would never suit his taste. So, he bumped into his favorite tee and asked me whether he looks fat on it? Oh, dear, don't be so obsessed with your weight, you look fine to me. I'll let you know when you become'  gemuk ', hehe. It's the same tee he wear every week!      " Hmm..baju tu pulak jadi favorite "   "The only favorite thing in my life that will never change is  you,"    Wow! Who would've thought he'd come out with such lovely words this early in the morning?    It's really sweet.   I'vel never ask for so much things in life except for a cuddle every night, our great pillow talk and his undying love for me. Yeah, yeah... we've only been married for 7 months now but we've known each other for 6 years and it still feels the same if not more than ever.

      Had so much fun with dearie. Started the day early, breakfast with mama and papa at their favorite mamak called Sri Melur in USJ 17. Topic of the day, AF lah apa lagi! Actually we planned to have breakfast at McD. I'm really craving for it since like, months!But papa kinda insist us to have breakfast with them. Takpelaa.. tak sampai hati pulak. Erie has already gone to work. Instead of Sausage McMuffin, we had tosai, roti canai and roti boom along with teh tarik. At least we made mama and papa happy. After that, we headed to Bangsar's HD. We were thinking of booking some stuffs that will be on sale but the stupid boutique manager aka Milah, didn't even prepare a thing! The staffs were complaining and our plan were shattered by this so called manager stupidity. Lapar balik, baby Zaheen ni mmg kuat makan laa..Excuses, excuses.. Ordered the Big Breakfast. The tables were decorated with IKEA's colourful stripes placemat and a vase of plastic rose. Tak pernah pulak pegi McD yg go all the way with their table decorations. I was the one eating most of the muffin/burger. Dear is really on diet. So proud of him. Lotsa parents bringing their children for breakfast. One day, we'll bring our baby here. Really can't wait to have this baby delivered. It's kinda fun waking up early in  the morning, instead of wasting our day by sleeping all day during the weekends. Should've done this a long time ago. Morning breeze is sooo heavenly. It's really nice of dear to spend time with me, when his friends asked him to join them for a ride to Kuantan(using the new highway, heard that it'll only take 1 1/2 hour).  I don't mind if he wanted to go, as riding is his life, his passion but he chose to be with me.  Lepak in front of the boutique. Met a new friend, fellow biker and enthusiast, just like my dear Reza. I can see from dear's eyes that he finally met someone that could share his passion. And this Kuryakin guy (just like the air cleaner, ha!) build his own bike frame! WOw! If his attempt succeed, dear's definitely gonna ask him to made a rigid frame, the one he's been dreaming off. Nak pakai Sucker Puch Sally's..gonna take like 2-3 years. Jesse James' WCC lagi laa berjanggut. Price range between 5k to 20k! Ready je la for some real pain in the ass, haha! While listening to them, I remember that I have a friend working at San Francisco Coffee If I'm lucky, I'm gonna get a free Chocolate Ice Blended.  And yes!She's there! Tak sia-sia jalan kaki sorang2.  Around 1pm we finally make a move to BSC. Dear shopping Levi's lagi. He's like a real walking model of Levi's nowadays. Oh yeah, before that we went to Motherclub (betul ke ni?) to survey the price for our baby essential needs. Clothing prices were outrageous here, so we went straight to AVENT products, baby carrier, bath basin etc. But, the clothes especially for baby girls are sooo cute, the little cardigans (which is definitely not applicable for Malaysian weather, unless if you're bringing your child to TGV or Genting,hehe) We've promised each other not to spoil our little baby with expensive clothes. However we've already eyeing ourselves on tiny Adidas and Cortez. Secretly, I wanted to buy pretty clothes for baby Zaheen when I have my own paycheck soon! I saw a cute little baby girl, just learning to walk on her feet and his father watching her admiringly or maybe proudly. Is Zaheen gonna look like that? Eee bila baby mummy nak keluar ni?
