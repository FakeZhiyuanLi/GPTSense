      So yesterday, I get onto my TFC clan's server, and we're kind of playing, but eventually, with three people having HLSS and a great load of techno music, we just kind of start converting random songs and playing them over voice chat, which we modified so that voice chat sounds more realistic. And I found a website for the bananaphone thing ( urlLink http://www.badgerphone.co.uk ). Anyways, tomorrow, we go to the lake until Wednesday. Later!

      Well my birthday yesterday entailed me waking up at 10AM and playing on the computer until 6PM, when we went out and ate. Then I went back on the computer&nbsp;until 11PM, when the computer crashed and I said, "Screw this, I'm going to bed." Only, because my Grandma was staying over, so I got to sleep in the basement on the couch. So I stayed up until 3AM, because TNT was showing 3 of my favorite X-Files episodes. Anyways, I've so far recieved $75 for my birthday, plus $40 for what I earned at the garage sale. Also, I've found some fun mods: Galactic Conquest for Battlefield 1942, and Renegade Alert for C&C: Renegade. Galactic Conquest is Star Wars, and Renegade Alert is the C&amp;C:Red Alert universe. Later!

      Song: Experimental Film, They Might Be Giants ( urlLink http://www.homestarrunner.com/expfilm.html )  Game: Command and Conquer: Tiberian Sun, Firestorm Expansion.   So, yesterday, my mom, my grandma, and I went to the Half-Price Bookstore, where I went and blew&nbsp;the money I made in the garage sale (according to my mom, I still say I've got $20 or so left). I got the first four Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy books, which are excellent, an older copy of Arthur C. Clarke's  Earthlight , which is an awesome book,  The Jesus Incident  in paperback and  The Lazarus Effect  in hardcover by Frank Herbert and Bill Ransom, and a copy of C&amp;C: Tiberian Sun w/ the Firestorm expansion pack and the  MASSIVE  Prima guide, and a copy of Battlecruiser: Millenium, which looked cool. And I found a cool video on  urlLink www.homestarrunner.com  for They Might Be Giants, and I keep listening to that. Later!

      Well, the MASSIVE LOAD OF BS, ahem, garage sale, is almost over. And now it's time for me to tell of a funny thing that happened last night. So me and a couple of friends decided to go see I, Robot. We get there, and one of us hears a&nbsp;hissing noise. Turns out one of tires is flat. So we go in, because we're gonna miss the movie. We come out and realize that we must exchange the tire on the car for the pure rubber "donut" tire&nbsp;in the trunk. Well, we get four of the bolts off, but the last one just WILL NOT MOVE. So we waited, called parents, waited some more, and finally, after four hours, we&nbsp;(three of us and our dads) just decided to leave it there and tow it in the morning.

      Song: Hard to Explain, The Strokes Game: TFC My dad thought we had too much stuff, so he decided we're having a garage sale. Yup,&nbsp; that means I'll be reading  The Lazarus Effect  (sequel to &nbsp;  The Jesus Incident ) while I watch people give me money for pieces of my childhood. In other news, two cool things about Half-Life mods:  Science and Industry  version 1.0 finally came out, if you have Steam you can DL it at  urlLink http://www.planethalflife.com/si . Just choose the full install from free.fr and you'll be fine. And I discovered the mod Monkey-Strike. You have to read about&nbsp;it ( urlLink http://monkeystrike.com ). Later!

      Song: Happier, Guster  Game: None  I've returned from a trip to the lake. It didn't go all that bad. In other news, I (once again) have a reason to watch the Sci-Fi channel, as their new series  Stargate: Atlantis  interests me. Oh, and I guess  Farscape  is coming back, so all is good. Later!   Postscript: I finished two interesting Sci-Fi novels, The Jesus Incident by Frank Herbert, and The Fountains of Paradise by Sir Arthur C. Clarke, both very fine works of literature. And we dropped my sister off at horse camp, so I've the house w/o her until Sunday. \/\/00+!

      Song: American Music, the Violent Femmes  Game: SimCity 2000  Well, I've finally decided to publish my thoughts, so as to vent my frustration. I returned two days ago from an amazing trip to North Carolina and D.C., and I'm kinda exhausted. Other than that, my parents have been pretty nice, but they want me to clean out my room for a garage sale. Later!

      Well, I got a job at the Haagen-Dazs in the mall, I start Monday. In other news, a "professional" lacrosse team will be coming to Minnesota, and fans are voting on the best name: the Thrill, the Rush, the Swarm, or the Bullheads. Why bullheads? No one likes them. If they wanted a Minnesota fish, they should have chosen Walleyes or Pike. Also, Sen. John Edwards, the VP candidate, is coming near, and I plan on going to the rally there. And I spent 6 hours yesterday and beat all but the last level of Unreal Tournament on my Dreamcast. As well, I ordered a copy of Beyond Good and Evil for PC and a memory card for the Dreamcast. And I bought The Postal Service's CD,  Give Up , which is quite good. Later!

      Ok, another explanation: Last Friday, when we went to the Mall, I stopped in at Sam Goody to look for a few CD's, and I found The Strokes' latest,  Room on Fire . While I like The Strokes, I would never pay more than $17 for ANY CD, unless it had decent extras. And it wasn't even like it was that new, the CD has been out for at least 10 months. I didn't understand why anyone would pay $22 for a 10-month-old CD, no matter how good the band. Then I heard an advertisement for the American Idol cell phone, and I resolved never to shop there again. Yesterday we went to CD Warehouse, a used CD store by me, and I bought Pete Yorn's  Day I Forgot , a pretty-good CD. Oh, and 2 of my Dreamcast games were too scratched to play, so I have to go back to EB tomorrow. Later!

       So anyways, we went to the Mall, and they still didn't have any applications, so I had to wait. Then I went to EB and got a Dreamcast free w/ some games and a coupon I got in GMR. I've finally beaten my mom on the issue of consoles, now I have to see if she'll let me get UT2K4. I got the original for Dreamcast, so maybe. Also, the paperback version of  Dune: The Machine Crusade , which is cool. Later!

      Song: The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonite, REM Game: Galactic Conquest, BF1942 mod  Ok, the title story first:  I   HATE   Bill O'Reilly. He's a prejudiced, pig-headed loser who should die. He's the most arrongant, self-righteous prick ever to be forced into my eyes and ears. It all started when (this was in '01 or '02) I heard that he wanted a college to be boycotted because their recommended reading list included a condensed version of the  Koran . So anyways, I was bored, and I happened to see that the  O'Reilly Factor  was just finishint up on Fox News. So I watched Mr. Self-Righteous Whore respond to e-mail. One he got was something to the effect of, "I'm a 21 year-old liberal who enjoys  the Factor ." His only response was, "good for you, but you're a bit young to be locking yourself into one ideology." I just wanted to throw the nearest solid object through the TV. Anyways, onto other things:  I had fun at my godfather's and my grandma's. I bought a copy of a new book by Arthur C. Clarke and Stephen Baxter called  Time's Eye . It cost me $26.99 plus tax, but it has a CD with a lot on it, so I don't feel  too  bad about spending that much. Also, I bought a copy of Grisham's  The Pelican Brief , because I've seen the movie and liked it. And I bought a 2005 desk calendar with a bunch of stupid quotes. For example:  Secret Service Agent: Mr. President, you're urinating on me. President Lyndon B. Johnson: I know I am. It's my perogative. (After Johnson stopped to relieve himself by a tree on his Texas ranch)  And I joined a multi-mod clan that spun off out of my TFC guild. So, from now on, I'm refering to my guild as Organized Chaos, and my clan as Dei Mortium. I've put new links up to both of them. Anyways, enough for now. Later!
