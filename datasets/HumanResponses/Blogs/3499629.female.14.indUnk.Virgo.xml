NOTE TO Y'ALL WHO WANNA IMPRESS ME ON THE FIRST DATE:  I LOVE,ADORE AND ALMOST COMPLETELY VENERATE PINK LILIES AND TULIPS!THEY'RE THE BEST! BUT IF YOU WANNA GO THE CLICHE-ISH ROMANTIC WAY,(EVEN THOUGH LILIES AND TULIPS WOULD SAY MUCH MORE THAN THAT) THEN GET ME SOME PINK ROSES, otay???  see,i'm not such a high-maint. gal,now,am i???hahahaha.  anyways,we came home tired and watched TFC... acshalli,ive been watching that shit all weekend.  asteeq nga eh, kasi atleast updated me sa mga happenings sa pinas,ryt?  lam nio ba na si ganito ganyan ganyan ganito?!?!?magchismis ba daw???  ang haba na nito ahhh...are y'all's eyes white yet???hope so,este,sorry, didn't know my material was so interesting(CONCIETED GURL ALERT)  BYE NA.  lotzaluvinfrommetoyou.peaceout.postcommentsifyallwant.ayt?teartheplaceup.ella.

      yep.changes. so much has changed these passed few days.so much.  yesterday,i got a letter from one of my friends, revealing how 'he' really felt about me.hhhaayyy! whattodo?dunno.dont wanna worry about it yet...  IM TOO YOUNG FOR ALL THIS SHITTY ASS DRAMA!!!  yesterday,i met this chick and had a real serious conversation about her about how she likes mah other friend, and i gez she hates me now because she thinks that i put her down and made her lose her confidence to ask him out. hey...honestly,i didnt mean to do it. i just told her to take shit easy,and she lost her confidence na? mah gosh.  it hurts me how my friend always sacrifices and tries to hide his feelings,and then,just blows up 'all of a sudden'  also how even though he sacrificed the most,he also got hurt the most.  it hurts me how the most undeserving people in this world get all the blessings, and yet they still dont realize na it's ALL there!  it sucks how they dont realize that they don't really have to look anywhere else, because it's right freakin there!  it makes me so upset that i feel what i feel, but im too stinkin scared to admit that im feeling it.  it gets me pissed when i realize that when people gimme the same exact peice of advice i gave em when they were in the situation, i realize that now that im in it, its not so easy.  NO MATTER HOW OFTEN I TELL MYSELF TO DO THE RIGHT THINGS, I END UP DOING WHAT I DIDNT WANT MYSELF TO DO IN THE FIRST PLACE.  it sucks how i learn so much from my exes, but how i doubt if they even learned anything from me.  it sucks how i try to give a peice of me out everytime, and how people act like its 'nothing'  BUT WHAT SUCKS THE MOST IS HOW I ALWAYS TRY TO ANALYZE LIFE, ONE DAY AT A TIME,ONLY TO FIND MYSELF SAYING,LIVE LIFE, HAKUNA MATATA.  GOSH,I GOTTA END THIS SHIT NA BAGO PA AKO MAGING TOO DEEP THAT EVEN I WOULDNT UNDERSTAND KUNG ANU NA SINASABI KO.      pRaYfOrMwAh.PaRaNgAwAnIonAnAmAn0.ella.
