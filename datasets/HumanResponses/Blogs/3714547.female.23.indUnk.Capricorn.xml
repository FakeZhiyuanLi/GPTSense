      Two things. The mouse is still in my room. It just made some scratching sounds. If i only knew where the damn thing is. I don't want it to be here. I'm still feeling down, pretty sad acompanied by an occasional headache. I hate days like these.

      Had another down day with some great thoughts. Actually only a down afternoon and evening probably. Have been working all day long on a translation and watching TV at the same time. I just can't work when it's quiet.  Well, thought was - "If I could just end it all." Not in a way to do anything to myself. Rather only to... I don't know change my style of living, my living situation, my no-boyfriend situation. I just feel so horribly lonely sometimes, including today. As talking is none of my favourite hobbies I prefer to keep everything to myself. Not god, I know. But that's how I am.   I just wish someone would find me...

      So far I didn't have any problems with the my domain. That's pretty strange. All the stuff I've wanted is already online. Now I have to move the sites I want there to the new place. Will take quite some time. I'm afraid there's a mouse in my room. I've heard strange sounds before but not as loud as today. I can't say mice scare, they don't know. But I don't like unwanted visitors... in the middle of the night most of all.

      I own a domain now. Wow. Still can't quite believe I did it. i just hope now I'll get everything working but as I know me there are a lot of problems in front of me. So I'm looking forward to get the stuff done but on the other hand I don't at all. Oh, I'm so excited. :D

      Hm... now I forgot what I wanted to write. I should do something to have a better memory. Anyway, I finally have something to finish my "Praktikum", meaning a translation from German to English. Once this is done I can soon start with my diploma, which means that the end of my studies is coming closer. And I'm gladabout this fact. However, I have no idea what will happen after this. I would love to travel for a while but then again I don't want to. It's just not really cool when you're alone abroad. I have been in the garden this morning to save the strawberries from those stupid birds and discovered that even the weeds have lice on them. That's so... I hate that. I couldn't enjoy the sun properly due to the heavy and rather cold wind. Not nice. But in two weeks I'll have way more sun and heat.

      I'm finally over that a couple of months long writer's block. I so loved writing fanfics and then I just couldn't anymore; I have no idea when.  Then some days ago I had an idea for a story for the fan fiction section on my Jenny site. It's still not much but I'm writing again and that's the most important thing. I also have another about someone famous. :D It's a pretty weird thing but I don't care. What will happen with all the old stories? I don't know yet. Hopefully I'll be able to continue them... one day.

      I've wanted a blog for quite a while now but never thought I would get one. Now I have. We'll see how it works.

      I want to go back! Very different from what I first thought but my holidays were way more than fatastic. *sigh* It was really hot - always around 40Â°C but that was okay. Food was perfect, people were nice. Oh my. Besides there was Ramazan...

      Well, I'm packing my stuff. I'm off to turkey tomorrow with my parents. Actually I've been thinking a lot about this and kind of decided that this would be the last trip with my parents. I mean I'm 23, time to "grow up". And if I would be alone i could do whatever I want. I guess that's one of the biggest problems. I like o go bed very late or rather early ;) and my parents... well not. I also have my moods, hard to cope with them sometimes. And sometimes I'm just annoyed of everything. So travelling alone would be an advantage momentarily, in this boyfriend-less time. *sigh* Anyway I have no choice than to go so I should make the best of it. However, I don't think this will be as easy as it sounds.

      Well, I seem to be able to open a zoo if it goes on like this. The mouse is still there and I just dicovered a big and too small wasps' nests in the garage of my car. This is not funny anymore. I like animals but not those and not in these places. Apart from that we have tons of lice on the plants in the garden. This is all so... not nice.

      Oh dear what a day. First I had to get up early. Then there's a dead marten near our driveway - looking very tasty. Then I srove to the post office and nearly killed a cat that wanted to cross the street. And then all of a suden around noon it started to thunder and rain very heavy, not olny buckets but bathtubes full of water. Well, I'm going to watch TV soon. The Tour the France is starting and I'm watching this every year. The only problem is that I don't know if i can watch it all the time as I won't be at home for two weeks from the week after the coming on. We'll see. Anyway, my mood is much better now. But there's still room for improvement...

      Got the shock of my life yesterday night. It was half past twelve and went to the bathroom. In front of the door was something dark. And while I was wondering what it could be the thing moved and went into the bathroom as the door was slightly open. Then I recognized it as a mouse - and it wasn't a small one. Unfortunately we didn't catch it.

      I feel I have kind of neglected this... although there are some news. I had this website abut books and stuff but it just wasn't what I wanted. So I deleted it and decided to create a German site about Jerry O'Connell. Just love the guy, he's so funny. What I didn't expect is that it's sooooooooooo much work. But I swear I'll get it done. My thoughts still revolve around Ramazan. I just can't get the guy out of my head. And if I talk about this it just gets worse. *sigh* I wish thigs would be different. Meaning that I fall in love and be happy and not sad as always.
