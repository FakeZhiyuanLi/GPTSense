      I've been lurking around various bloggin boards, snooping vicariously into other people lives throughteh wonderful medium that is the blog aka PUBLIC DIARY! Woo Hoo! I never thought I was a nosey person, ear wigging into other people stories (enjoying the mis fortunate ones) until I found these blogging sites...   As a kid I kept my diary locked with a tiny padlock that came complete with a tiny key and hit it under my bed between the matress and the springs, retrieving it with cut scraped hands and arms as previously mentions springs protected my secrets! I could always tell who had been near it by the thin scraping on their arms and war would follow! And now look at us...posting our tales our worries out woe and our happiness!   Okay okay I've only started but as a long time reader first time poster I can only say I'm delighted to be joining a community of fellow parkers!   I work pretty much 6 days a week, 10 am - 6 pm (later on thursdays and fridays) so  should have all manners of things to be posting, I'm a Jonah with many misfortunes and personal injuries that always seem to stem from an ill concieved adventure. (Note to self think before I leap!) What can I say except...let the good times rool but bad times do make for better reading! :)

      My nephew was turning 5 at the weekend, the party was going on all day but I had to work all day sat 10 - 6. But they promised to save me some festivities! Didnt give a shit about the festivities I just wanted some cake! But then someone nicked my phone! Nokia 6310i ( so I later found out !) Robbery happened at around 3.30 and I noticed it at 4 ish. Called vodafone and put a block on the sim card and the handset and they said I'll get a new phone within 2 working days ( becasue of my insurance !) But I have to pay €40 to get it sent over from galway! After paying insurance everymonth for the past 2 years they have the cheek to ask me to pay for delivery!  This didnt put me in&nbsp; good mood to be surrounded by screaming children...but such is life. The cake was double chocolate fudge cake. :)  &nbsp; &nbsp;

      So my brother decided it was time he lost weight. And he didnt want to do it alone. So we went on the Zero Carbs diet, supposed to last 2 weeks then low cards controlled diet for a while and badda bing badda boom we'd be beautiful people... So on the first day we struggle through a crappy breakfast and an even worse lunch. He went home from work with a killer migrane and I left with just a headache that quickly blew into a migrane by dinner time! Quarter pounder later (complete with carbo full bun) I was feeling much better so screw that zero carbs diet! I've been a sufferer of migranes for about 8 years now and they can range from the dull thump that wont quit to the black out pain where you wake up miles from where you should be...so why induce this sort of discomfort on myself for the sake of a few lbs!  Yeah it didnt last long! Shit I should have known I couldnt live without bread and pasta! But I couldnt be told!  Then yesterday I lost my wallet...well truth be known I lost it on monday and only realised I lost it on Wednsday. 2 credit cards and 2 ATM cards complete with about €75 cash missing and I didnt even realise. (note to self : switch on brain) So I contacted the cinema I was at on monday to see if anyone had handed it in, all the while knowing my business cards were in it and if anyone legit had found it they would have rang me but instead I persisted in my battle witht eh automated answering maching dictating to me what buttons on my touch tone I should be pressing and when!  Then my sister informs me she found it in the hallway outside my flat on tuesday morning and she forgot to tell me...as much as I wanted to throttle her I was delighted to see my precious back in safe hands (of course after I counted the cash! lol!)
