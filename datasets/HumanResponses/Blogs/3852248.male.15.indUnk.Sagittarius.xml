      One day when I was a unbeliever, I committed many different kinds of sins. Any kind that you can even think of. We are all like that. I went to church because my father forced me to by using is health.  After attending many services in that charismatic church, my soul profiteth nothing. Then my father brought me to another church. It is a reform church. There is discipline in the church during worship services.  Then my soul slowly began to profit. During that time, I was still like the worldly people, like everybody else. After attending many services, I began to change my everything such as personality, behaviour, attitute, etc. During the changing process. I am partly of my old self. Although i struggled through many kinds of temptation, most of the time i still ended up committing those sins.  After sometime, there was a division in the church, due to the perfect bible stand. The people, who believes that the bible is perfect and has no mistake, were seperated from those who did not. I missed those fellowship with like-minded brethren, hoping to have fellowship with them in future again. Those people taught and helped me in times of difficulties. But still I follow those believe in the perfect bible. The world may think that this is meaningless, but we ought to follow the instruction of the bible.  Currently, I am worshipping in RELC. Many months has past, but still i miss them. Not long ago, the church organised a church camp in Malaysia. I joined to learn more spiritual things.   During the camp, I found that those sins which i committed in the past, shall not let me enter into heaven. And what must we do to obtain salvation. There was a great revival in me. I felt remorse, guilt, ashamed of all my sins. I prayed the sinners' prayer, confessing all my sins, and also prayed for repentances and hoping to be a better christian. After learning many things, I officially announced that I am borned again.(spiritual being)  After sometime my fruits which I bear will becoming more and more evil. Until I committed a sin which shall not let me enter to heaven. I am not difference from the world. Currently, I am hoping for more self-discipline, better behaviour whether be it in school or at home or anywhere, humility, change of my attitute and thinking towards God, my Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.  Love, samuelX

      From the day that he was born he committed sins. what are those sins? well they are many kinds of sins and some of them are the seven deadly sins. what are they?  They are:  7 Deadly Sins (I)  Text: Proverbs 6:16-19  -envy-pride-lust-gluttony-slothfulness-wrath-covetousness-  *	proud look: pride *	lying tongue: lies *	hands that shed innocent blood: *	heart that devises wicked things: scheming *	feet swift in running to mischief: causing trouble *	false witness:  *	soweth discord among brethren: gossip  God hates these characteristics. They are an abomination unto Him.  *	There is no sin that is less deadly or more deadly *	These 7 sins are the cause of many other sins. [root sins] *	If a person has all these things, it may destroy him. *	We are to walk circumspectly. [Ephesians 5:15-16] *	Theologians talked about it…complied it, popularising it. *	Closely related to the Roman Catholics. Venial Sins = not so bad. Cardinal Sins = cannot be forgiven. *	They believe that some sins are worse than other sins. *	Popularised by literature and Church Fathers. The Bible also mentions these sins. *	In Christian Theology, not really true.  Gluttony Text:  *	Deuteronomy 21:20 *	Proverbs 23:21  Note: *	The word appears only twice in the Bible. *	He doesn’t care; he wants to live it up. However, it doesn’t only refer to eating, as long as it can ensnare us, it’s bad.  Deuteronomy 21:20 *	Harsh punishments. [disobedience] *	Stubborn rebellion associated with glutton. *	Something that controls our life, addiction. e.g. computers, food, talking on the phone, ect…  An example of a Glutton *	Luke 15:11-32 [the parable of the lost son] *prodigal = glutton *	(vs.13) “wasted his substance with riotous living” = excessive *	Result: (vs.14) He will eventually become poor and lack all that he needs. *	It is deadly towards others and towards us. e.g. live, eat, breathe, drink the obsession. *	Long term effect: sapping our energy. *	Glutton is also Lazy.  Laziness  Sloth *	It is an animal that is extremely slow and lazy.  *	The record speed is ½ km in one day.  *	Is able to spend an entire life-time in a tree. *	The sloth is so idle that green algae grows on fur, as it is too lazy to wash itself. *	Primary occupation: eating *	Eating: so slothful that sometimes when looking for food, it’ll die of starvation. *	It dies hanging on trees, skeletons.    Proverbs 6:6 “Go to the ant thou sluggard; consider her ways and be wise.”  Slothful: no motivation and energy to do anything else.  Proverbs 26:15-16 “The slothful hideth his hand in his bosom; it giveth him to bring it again to his mouth. The sluggard is wiser in his own conceit than seven men that can render a reason.”  Ecclesiastes 10:18 Proverbs 18:9  How do we apply it to ourselves? *	It is vain to wake up early and sleep too late. [Proverbs 24:23-24] *	Sleeping too much is also bad. [Proverbs 6:9-11] *	They are deadly sins because we see the consequences.  Psalms 127:2 “It is vain for you to rise up early, to sit up late, to eat the bread of sorrows, for so he giveth his beloved sleep.” =)   7 Deadly Sins (II)  Covetousness  Covet // Greed: excessive desire to acquire. Inordinate desire for things belonging to another. e.g. I Samuel 2:29: Eli’s sons were greedy [disqualified from priesthood]  Other Text: *	Luke 12:15 *	Exodus 20:17  Parable of the Fool Luke 12:13-21 *	Several pronouns “I. me and myself” *	Self-centeredness *	Fool = those who treasure earthly wealth. *	e.g. mirror to see ourself *	Reflect and search our own hearts Luke 12:21 *	Rich towards God *	Search for avenues to serve God. [e.g. bs, planning, playing the guitar] *	Serve with a pure conscience *	Luke 4:5-8 *	Good example to resist covetousness *	God 1st *	Nothing wrong with being rich, but it is what we do with the money that matters. *	e.g. church in America. Embezzlement. *	Comes about indulging in expensive lifestyle *	Lust of worldly things.  Greed // Covetousness *	If we don’t check this, we will fall into compromise. *	e.g. 2 Samuel 11:2-3 [David committed adultery] *	Walk onto the roof, saw, liked, continue to look [allow self to be tempted] *	Sent and enquired after the woman [feeding o his covetousness] *	Prevent one from being tempted. [e.g. Joseph resisted Potiphar’s wife] *	Material and Fleshy lusts.  Envy “painful and self-fish desire of someone else’s advantage and wanted it without paying the price for it. e.g. jealously  Genesis 26:14 *	Cars, houses, jewellery, shoes, racquets *	We must search our hearts to see if we are envious  1.	Material Goods  2.	Social Status *	Genesis 30:1 *	James 2:1-5 [status discrimination]  3.	Rebellion *	Characteristic of Man *	Romans 1:29 [envy – quality of a reprobate (undiscerning) mind] *	“shall not inherit the kingdom of God.” *	Each of us given our own “blueprint” by God *	When we step out, and think that other are better, we are envying. *	e.g. comparing of girlfriends. [envious spirit] *	Not content.  4.	Unregenerate Life e.g. life without God  *	Titus 3:13 Will always cause one to hate another cause of inability to fulfil one’s desire.  envy -> hate  *	Begins from setting our affections on things on earth. *	“don’t look across our neighbour’s house but to heaven.”  5.	Trait of False Teachers *	1 Timothy 6:4 *	Galations 5:26 In debates, in spirit of envy, one party may resort to undesirable tactics to promote own view. *	In every discussion, never be envious.  6.	Envying of Violent and Wicked *	Psalms 73:3 *	Proverbs 3:21 *	Psalms 37:1 *	“workers of iniquity” = lawlessness *	whatever sin they need to manifest to gain success, will do that. *	Wicked will be judged in God’s time *	“it’s not fair” [Psalms 37:1-9] *	Psalm 37:5  -gossip-sarcasm-spite- e.g. mass-emailing of view  Thanks to Daniel Wong for this

      Still acting cool today only just that i talk alittle more when ppl talks serious and meaningful things to me. and only to some people. I learned dy/dx and also d2y/dx2 during the free period where by no lesson specifically starts. then a relive teacher came and do her stuff then she talk to me first she ask me how tall i am i said 191cm then she ask me to walk to the door and stand and go back then she said the door is about 2m long then i started to ask her about whether she teaches A maths or not then she said yes then i ask her about the dy/dx stuff. she taught me. her teachings were very simple and easy to understand. its easier than what my 2nd bro taught me. then i understand it liao then i ask her to give me some practices on the dy/dx stuff then i did the first and the 2nd sums and the 2nd one is a cube or something like that whereby after you dy/dx an equation you still have left with xSQUARE+x+4 or something like that. then after that i did the d2y/dx2 on that same question after dy/dx hoping to get a simplified version. Gan eng seng school EXPRESS CLASS very fun.... its a more enjoyable thing for teachers to teach in express than the problematic TECHNICALS which i am in. After recess i sit alone and pray and eat. then one of my friend from other class join me becuz he always sits there. today hoping to be alone. and trying to control my emotions and personalities(the things which i will do @ a certain circumstance). of course when some ppl talks to you just reply or else you would be stumbling others about ur religion. the lessons after recess during the lab i laugh and laugh (i cant control my emotions) its hard for me to pretend that no one is around and pretend that i didnt hear anything. then i tell a friend named bryan khoo fan yao. i told him that i am laughing at his chinese nick name. then he said what is his chinese nick name. it is khoo yao fan (means that Mr Khoo wants rice or Khoo begs for rice) then some of the classmates around that area begin to laugh......  THE END hoping not to be so socialise and trying to control my emothions.  STAY COOL :)  love samuelX

I was like ACTING SUPER COOL and i pretended that some of my friends does not exist and when they speak i pretend not hearing them. *ways of a loner  then after school before the Basketball match begin My class vs COMBINE sec3 One sec 1 girl was CRYING ...... i think her heart was broken by her bf or something else.  anyway the match preparation i did warm ups alone. then after the match even tho we lost some of my other class mates wanted a fight with the sec3 due to THEIR XIAO ZHANG.  imediately after the match i quickly left. i wanted to stay cool and be a discipline and mature guy. then i saw that girl she was still sad, she was crying while her bf ask her questions.....  what worldly relationships are..... all the sad things happens  where as i wanna be a loner to stay cool and dun wanna mix with some ppl in the world due to the fact that when i mix with them, we all behave like the world like small little kids making a fool of ourselves and always getting into trouble. :)  love samuelX

AFTER EATING, i went to the library and was alone once again checking some chinese words in the Chinese Dictionary with english translation. AFTER SCHOOL YEA!!!!!!! most ppl go to lan shop after school (i wanted to play bball today) but i go home straight i wanna discipline myself and when i got home i MUHQ most of the time and searching for anime wallpapers LOOKING FOR CUTE AND COOL ANIME CHARACTERS like Rockman EXE's Master without headband and the white hair guy. and of course looking for FF8 graphics too..

      This morning, woke up late even tho i set ALARM CLOCK at 5++ am hoping to WAKE UP and to keep my appointment with the MOST HIGH LORD. but then the alarm clock didnt alarm ..... the clock seems not to be working haiZz sad sad..... so i do my morning basic routine liao then i take cab go parklane and eat my breakfast. i was eating at a slow rate but then time consumption so i stuff the last meat into my mouth and went for tuition. Even tho i meet with some of my tuition friends (classmates) i was COOL haha STAY COOL yea. But then sometimes staying cool as in like when ppl talk to you and you dun reply, it may be quite stumbling lah. as christians we should be friendly to evangelise lest we should be stumbling. haiZz May the Lord forgive me of my sins. But sometimes i find that Acting cool might be a very good thing especially in class. Most of my classmates are ... i can say bad companies lah becuz last time i used to mix with them. then i always getting into trouble. ended up sinning against GOD *a very sad thing right?* mixing with the wrong group of friends will lead you to sin like for example. when ur friends provoke you, there is a high tendency for you to be angry and might want to fight, scold bad words, and stuff. The Christian race is tough lah. just need to continue to persever on with the Faith for FAITH is Forsaking All I Take Him. Yes Forsaking all, our sinful nature, the old man and all our pride and lust, our greed (coveteous), our envy. We have to Deny ourselves before the ALMIGHTY GOD and be humble before him and confess our sins which we committed daily. even our secret sins which we didnt relise. As Christians we should not to conform to this world but to be Transformed by the Renewing of our Mind. To be Christ TRUE disciple you need to Forsake all that we have, LOVE GOD MOST and hate others even ur own life. Now here the word hate is just simply love lesser than ur love for Christ.  The Christian Dating thingy haiZZ ........... I like the Christian Dating notes which my bro gave me. EVEN tho i dun have any RELATIONSHIP with anyone, i wanna learn for enrichment. After reading the whole thing, i find that its not just about the Christian liberties of dating but it tells you about where we stand before GOD. and does God care? yes he does. and we should abide in his statutes. By abiding in Christ, He will guide us slowly, we should also have our human responsiblity also in every action which we should do.  Ending with one of my FAVE VERSE  But they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk and not faint.  Isaiah 40:31 KJV  my samuelEXE ending words *Thank God for inspiration to type such long blog*

      I am guilty of sleeping during sermon today.  In the morning my nose starts to leak.  Today the Speaker was T.Tow he talks about No fellowship with unfruitful works of darkness but reprove them.  well i wasnt really paying attention tho. may the lord forgive me of my sin.  i think that its more of a sharing then of preaching. he shared about the perfect bible stuff. and i thinks that he didnt tell us how to reprove them.  but then after lunch i went home. and heard some speech by clement. then i relised the importants of today's message.  anyway i didnt noe what is really going on during church service. i should have go and help in the kids movement with my cousin(candice) and weitse to keep me awake lolz.  Thank God for today as he SAVED MY LIFE. i NEARLY FELL FROM THE BUS in the STAIRS.  Thank God

      During the YPF, the speaker is my *friend Dr. Jeffrey. I find that whatsoever Message from any speaker would be the same even some may say good or bad. but for me i think that its enrichment programme and to learn things so when in due time, others would ask you about it then you can ans them back.  ok todays msg in YPF is about FAITH i should say  The teaching of Christ here the subject is the Centurion (means a Captian with 100 soldiers) and the object is Faith Here is what we read, i couldnt find the actual text which we read but i have something common:  Now when he had ended all his sayings in the audience of the people, he entered into Capernaum.  And a certain centurion's servant, who was dear unto him, was sick, and ready to die.  And when he heard of Jesus,  he  sent unto him the elders of the Jews, beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant. *  And when  they  came to Jesus, they besought him instantly, saying, That he was worthy for whom he should do this: **  For  he  loveth our nation, and he hath built us a synagogue. ***  Then Jesus went with them, And when he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying unto him, Lord, trouble not thyself: for I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof: ****  Wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come unto thee: but say in a word, and my servant shall be healed. *****  For I also am a man set under authority, having under me soldiers, and I say unto one, Go, and /he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it.  When Jesus heard these things, he marvelled at him, and turned him about, and said unto the people that followed him, I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no ,not in Israel.  And they that were sent, returning to the house, found the servant whole that had been sick.  Luke 7:1-10  In my Opinion,  * the word in italic here, the "he" is refering to the Centurion ** the word "they" here is refering to the elders of the Jews *** the word "he" here is refering to the centurion **** I think that the "I" is the Centurion. here is one of the most important point. it is that we should confess that we are unworthy of the lord (humility) " the faith of the centurion which we should have is humility. being humbled before the Lord. As you can see that the Centurion being so Great a person who is high in rank humble himself before the Lord. what more we?  ***** And again the Centurion humbled himself, he told Jesus to just say a word that his servant should be healed, this is a faith of believing (not seeing is believing) (not easy to believe faith) i think that this faith is genuine faith, a faith that is knowing that the LORD is able to do all things. (in my opinion, if God is able to do all things why cant he be able to preserve the perfect bible?) The faith is this centurion is Complete and total trust and surrendering to the Lord Jesus Christ.  In conclusion TRUE FAITH is:  Firstly, from the preached word of God, not by signs and wonders or miricles but by hearing and hearing by the word of God. 2ndly, we have to humble ourselves before the Most High God, and having a Completed and total trust in Him. Surrendering everything to the Lord Jesus Christ.

So Today. was just being normal naturally cool quiet. didnt realise that jason lim told me that i was actually having a game with him. but i did not lolZz. i was not imposting him either.

      After a sleeping late at night, the next morning i did my basic routine and took my medicine. This morning i went to school with my vitamin C and another kind of tablet for you to suck. During some of the lessons i was feeling weak. Then i asked the teacher for permission to take my vitamin C in class. My request was accepted. When i ate, everybody was looking at me. I did not have any feeling like embarrassment. I was naturally cool. During recess i was at an open table eating alone. Then some of my classmates join me. I was quietly eating (maybe pretending that they do not exist) After having my meals, I went to the library and read an A-maths book. The first 3 quarters in school i was cool and behaving well. At the 4 quarter, I was actually not doing class work and was distracted by some of my classmates as they came over to the nearby seat of mine and discuss about other stuff.  After school, I played basketball with them and my team won 3 games. It was drizziling and i caught in a slight drizzling. I gave J O E a lift home. When i reach home, I took off my wet shirt and lied on my bed. As I lied, I was thinking of somethings. Then I fell asleep.  ***************************************************************************************************** Today During lesson time, some of my class mates were so Childish that they played with water and splashed it onto somebody's table. And when that somebody came back, she kicked up a big fuss. She overturned the table and scold vulgarities. (Acts of an ah lian) and it created a loud noise. HaiZz Technical class ah. cant find peace one ......  even Sec FOURs behaving as small little kids. fighting, talking craps, playing at the wrong time. I was like that before but after i tried and became cool. I actually stopped these things.  IMO staying cool is a way of being matured. Time to be serious, Time to play, Time to have fun. There is a time for everything. So dun be agitated by such things during work, lesson time, serious time. Well i thanked God for helping me to behave well in class and give me strength not to faint as i was weak. Today during school i did socialise by a little bit more than usual.  I think thats all for today.            S T I L L  W O R K I N G  O N  T H E  V E R S E S  A N D  G I V I N G  O P I N I O N S.  bye and thanks for reading  samuelEXE,  a sinner saved by grace

      why did i choose this title because in terms of spiritual relationship with God, i kind of put God not first in my life. becuz i didnt do my quiet time immediately when i am free. so sad man....   anyway today Thursday in school......   This morning i walked into the class i laughed at them as i was laughing all the way from level 3 to my classroom. (haiZz cant control my laughter somehow) The best way to learn well in class is to be COOL. why did i say be cool? bcuz being cool by ignoring irrelevant talks during curriculum time will help you to study, behave, more concentration on the teacher instead of ya classmates. Well sometimes when I am too friendly i might end up sinning becuz of pride. haiZz sad case...  During the first half i was alright. Thank God that he has helped me through my maths test. (by giving me concentration to deal with some of the trick questions) anyway.........   The best way= be cool, stay cool. DONT MAKE YOUR CONVERSATION INTERESTING during curriculum time because some of the troublesome classmates will post to you irrelevant topics (discussion or debate) (which will sometimes lead you to pride). (JUST pretend that they dun EXIST and pretend not to hear anything just keep looking at the teacher) well even though it may be stumbling but its hard. at the end of the day tell them that i wanna concentrate on lessons than chatting with them becuz the learning chance of some topics may not come easily.   If you make ur conversation interesting, your troublesome classmates will post you topics. and you reply them and they will continue talking with you until you are unable to channel your concentration to the lesson instead of your classmates. And the conversation will last for quite some time until when the bell rings. You might not be able to complete ur assignments (exercise, work) SO TO ALL MY CLASSMATES PLEASE DUN TALK TO ME DURING LESSON TIME. THANKS   during chinese lesson haiZz sad man i had pride in a debate with LIT TIEN SOON.... i find that he is a bard(provoker) its really hard to be humble to him as he keeps on HAO LIAN and other stuff   HaiZz today during EC period.... did my stuff only trying to update my blog but cookies denied so cannot log in.... during the normal class lessons, Bryan, Cynthia, Katherine haiZz playing water in class using water and splash each other like small kids...... liming, justina, andy keep shouting at each other disturbing one another ended up scolding vulgarities in a joking manner... HaiZz   as christians i would say not to follow them Please pray for more TEMPERANCE (one of the fruit of the spirit) as well as LOVE ONE ANOTHER as Christ has love you...... WELL i may seems to be contradicting myself but well thats part of life haiZz hard to be a SAINT a HOLY ONE... Pray for peace too....   WAH this is my first time writing so much but i will still be continuing as i have lotsa more events coming up.   After school i went to Tiong Bahru Plaza by Car, with my Father, Herbert. i ATE some SOYA STUFF from Mr. BEAN.... Herbert was always at gift shop and flower shop... He is buying present or flowers for his *FrIeNd ..... anyway when i get back to the car, i told my father to drive me to school as i gotta work to do and i dun wanna sleep at home.... when i reach school, i went to the staff room and look for my Chinese teacher from china... While waiting for her i did some of my MAths.... (just recalled that before maths lesson, i kinda did the surface area of the cone wrongly thinking that its a cylinder instead becuz my Tuition teacher always takes the a4 size paper and fold it into a cylinder so i thought that cone was cylinder and i kinda like blame my tuition teacher for it but it was falsed... i am the person who was wrong so i blamed myself instead then i check my notes for formulae and find out the correct one then i take a moment to memorise it and ready for TEST) I find that my Chinese teacher from China is a very patient person as she would willingly teach me even when she is (In my opinion kinda busy)......... after doing all the CHINESE homework and my late assignments, i went to the basketball court. had some games with my classmates and friends. but i didnt really perform well as i was playing a fool (thats wrong as Christian we should do our best for God) .... anyway after the game. my classmates, friends and I went out of school with untucked shirt. We were scolded by Mr Derick Tan (a person who walks like gangster and talks like one, trying to create trouble for students.) but then we keep quiet lah becuz his teacher bigger than us.... so show some respect lah... but then we were very bad we went out of school go to the nearby shop and get a drink and at the same time gossip about Derick Tan saying that he WALKS like Gangsters and he may be a Gangster (thats bad man, As Christians, we should obey the school rules, and also Show love for one another, and if we love one another we shouldnt be gossiping about him).... When we separated and went home. Bryan came my house... we played games and online chatting in my house. (haiZz have time to play games and chat no time to DO QT with GOD LAH... sad man) then we went for dinner and i send him home....

      There are 2 types of determination.  &nbsp;  One is a positive type, another is the negative type.  &nbsp;  Positive type is&nbsp;being determined to seek God, obeying God, to change, to read his word, to be faithful.  &nbsp;  Negative type is being determined to sin against God.  &nbsp;  HaiZz many ppl like me have determine to sin against God.&nbsp;Maybe because that I am drunkard in the sense of not being sober.  &nbsp;  May the Lord help me not to sin against thee, help me to change, and to read thy word. Help me to seek thy first the kingdom of God continuously. &nbsp; Today i feel like writing the happenings in school today.... every day is sad case....

Why? becuz what have i learn from todays QT...  the bible says....  &nbsp;     And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.        Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong         2 Corinthians 12:9,10           &nbsp;

Today finally i realised that the exams are very near so i gotta study HARD this time.      MY GOALS AT HOME:         Seek God First        Study hard at home        Being a Balanced person        Be Disciplined        More self-control        Completed my TIME TABLE and follow it         Thats all for today i think.....        anyway....        verse still searching sorry ah....

             Please Highlight the following text below to see clearly :D     Talking about humility humility towards God. we must humble ourselves before God to seek for His forgiveness. No matter how Great the sins are, whether committed murder or whatever bad sins which u think, just be humble before God, that He may forgive us of our sins. Confess your sins and ask God to help you to repent of all your sins and committed them no more. Me say what i dun do... hypocrite right? Me also now in the bondage of sin. Have not go back to God yet. My spiritual life not fully recovered yet.....      some of the verses of what i say brb me go get bible        Let us therefore come boldy unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.     Herbrews 4:16

      Today was my last national day celebration in Gan Eng Seng School. It was a happy yet disappointed moment for the two hours today in school. Some of my classmates, they jeering at the performance of other classes. To be known as "Friends" must set good example. Maybe they are not my real friends. I think the secondary five students influence them to join in the jeering session.  After school, Tien Soon was pestering me. After having a very short conversation with him, I did not talk to him anymore. I think he is a nuisance, pest, and some one who likes boasting about himself and discrimating others which is also known as looking down at others.  Anyway I went for lunch with my father, at the coffeeshop near Tiong Bahru Plaza. I thought I will be eating "136 chicken rice" but then they are not ready yet. So I ended up eating Chicken Noodles. The chicken which the vendor beside the "136 chicken rice" vendor, served me chicken with bones.  I had a terrible experience with chicken with bones because I am not trained for chicken meat with bones yet.  anyway GTG going to queensway meeting KLM will be back editing later cya

      Hi every body i am Sam the LOSER. Firstly i would like to say that.......... EVEN left 10 days to PRELIMS, i still playing MUONLINE, does the game really overwhelms me? i think it is. oh dear the Game has be come my "GOD"... haiZz may the ONE AND ONLY TRUE AND LIVING GOD FORGIVE ME. then i started doing the MATHS AND SCIENCE REVISION...... I WAS OWNED BY THE FIRST FEW QUESTIONS.... HAIZZ i let PRIDE become my MOTIVATION (fighting spirit) MAY THE LORD FORGIVE ME ALSO. then there is one question about RATIO... I gotta reach the STATE of primary school standard just to solve that QUESTION... me being a BLOODY TRYING TO WIN THOSE EXPRESS CLASSES IN MATHS AND SCIENCE.... haiZz anyway pandemona says that WINning EXPRESS CLASSES useless one wanna win WIN THE EXPRESS CLASSES' TEACHERS lolZz thats really a good one anyway... there is a time i wanted to CHALLENGE my MATHS TEACHER MR LOW.... ABOUT HIS DEFINATION OF what is a PRIME NUMBER... HE SAYS the defination of a prime number is that IT CAN BE ONLY BE DIVIDED BY 1 and ITSELF... THEN I ASK is 1 a PRIME NUMBER? he said no... But 1 can be divided by 1 and itself what.. Whereas my TUITION TEACHER TAUGHT ME THE BEST DEFINATION OF A PRIME NUMBER IS THAT IT MUST ONLY HAVE 2 POSITIVE INTEGER and DIFFERENT FACTORS.  OK CUT THE CRAP. now RELATIONSHIP one of my FAVE TOPIC... although i dun really care about relationship.... i will use SCIENTIFIC TERMS to describe a relationship. lets start with the AND GATE the AND GATE needs 2 high inputs to make the output high EXAMPLE ( need 2 keys to open 1 door) the AND GATE is more of a teacher and student relationship. if the teacher is willing to teach and the student has LOUSY ATTITUDE and dun wanna learn NO BODY CAN HIM THAT STUDENT... i try to use the AND GATE FOR MARRIAGE RELATIONSHIP IN ORDER TO GET MARRIED, Both partys must be WILLING.  NEXT is a personal letter to cloud Dear Cloud, I am writing this to tell you that I am sorry for being a sulphur dioxide (SO2) to make your rain acidic. I am being used by vehicals to make them move for people to transport from one to another place. I am also an Oxide of Nitrogen (NO2), also made your rain acidic and cause smog to destroy your image. I am the both of them, making your rain acidic to harm lives. I am not like the Sun who can beautify of your image by combining with your rain to create a beautiful rainbow. A rainbow can make people happy, It also can make people think positively. I hope that I not be used by people, as technology improves, vehicals can run with either battery, hydrogen (H2) and maybe water (H2O) when time passes.   Yours sincerely    H2SO4 Science Department  LOLzZz i just wrote a SO CALLED my own version of a "SCIENTIFIC LETTER OF APOLOGY". Well hope you guys will interpret it correctly. Even though i am the writer of this letter, i do noe the meaning lolZ, if you guys wanna find out the meaning of this letter. please tell me in the tag-board and SPECIAL REQUEST FOR ENGLISH STUDENTS out there. please GIVE ME A GRADING of this LETTER. Thank you

Dear BEBE captain of T-Net,  MaY i kNOW WHEN team training will be resume?

GUYS CAN ANYONE MOTIVATE ME TO PUT IN MORE EFFECT IN STUDYING??? me study like just a short revision niaZz... Got CONDUCIVE ENVIRONMENT but no heart to STUDY...  GESS bball training will be running, sprinting, layups and shooting (shooting = TRAINING OF UR STROKE, the way u release the ball from ur palms)  Like Tu Yuan says, A player wins the GAME, a TEAM wins the CHAMPIONSHIP Although our team dun have SUPERSTAR like RUI TECK but our team should have the NEVER SAY DIE ATTITUDE. So if any of you wants to solo out there, u only win A game, but if you guys play team game, WE WIN THE CHAMPIONSHIP. But that doesnt mean cannot solo. But try to solo only when got opportunity and DUN SOLO TOO OFTEN.  Sorry if i have been soloing VERY OFTEN lolZz...
