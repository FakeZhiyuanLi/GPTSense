      today my mom hit me. i was driving home from my 50 zillionth blood test this summer, and there was a stoplight ahead. apparently i wasnt stopping fast enough, so my mother figured that slapping my arm would solve the problem. thank you mom. then i went to senor frogs and ate more eggs... blekh. who goes to senor frogs and eats eggs? apparently i do because of my lack of protein. oh well i took a 3 hr nap and now im trying to decide wut i wana do tonight. i think i have a thing wit tall guys lol. even if theyre not that hott (ok they hafta b at least a lil hott)if i see a guy thats like 6'3-6'4 ill b like ........hi :-D maybe cuz they make me feel short lol. now im watching wanna come in. i dont see how some of these 'studs' get girls but okay. im gonna go stuff everything in my closet so it looks like i cleaned my room for my cousin. byebye

      today was another reallllly boring day.... i woke up at 11ish ate lunch and went back to sleep until four. i kept reading that spanish book even tho i have no idea whats going on. for all i know the main character could have thrown himself off a cliff and i didnt notice because i dont know the words for throw himself off a cliff. arrojarse sumthing. im pissed because my mom promised she would take me to deerfield for this surfing clinic on saturday, but nooooo my cousins coming so i cant. i hate that. i didnt invite them so why do my plans have 2 change? omg.... its been a whole week since i saw them tear tear. my cousins probably reading this right now and thinking wut a bitch i am. oh well. i really wanted to go. i wore my brady bunch t-shirt around the house all day and no one noticed how cool and highlighted it was. well toby noticed, i think. he kept sniffing it. dogs tend to do that tho. maybe the highlighter smelled wierd. it definitely doesnt taste good... now im sitting here listening to my refrigerator make wierd noises because it was like the first refrigerator ever invented and i got it at a garage sale for 10 bucks. why did i want one so bad? the only thing thats in it is a couple jelly beans and 50 zillion bottles of water. haha my brother just gave me 11 cents and told me to buy myself something nice. he kills me. yeah i read catcher in the rye. really good book. ashton reads it when he wants to be in an artsy mood :-* i think im gonna go watch i love the 70s now even tho i missed the first half of the decade. ciao.

      ok ive started writing this fucking blog three fucking times but these fucking pop ups keep coming up and then they bring fucking friends and more and more of them fucking come and i start yelling at my fucking computer and then my brother comes in and tells me to stop fucking saying fuck. fucking fuckers. the popups not my brother. thats gonna be the first word i teach my kid. "ok now repeat after me.... fuuuuuck.... very good!" anyway... yeah today i woke up at like 1, made myself toast and eggs. i think eggs are nasty but i need them for protein so i eat them anyway. then i watched the last half of mission to mars with my brother. worse movie ever. "look a giant face is making noise! lets turn the noise into pictures so that we can solve the puzzle and go inside the giant face! yay!" then i started reading my spanish summer reading. el burlador de sevilla. apparently its about this guy who goes around tricking girls into fucking him and then he leaves. sounds fun. i probably would be done by now seeing as its only like 50 pgs if i didnt have to stop every 2 seconds and look every word up. im gonna fail spanish. y am i in 4h?? i dono but im gonna fail. oh well its still summer :-D im thinking about going to the beach tomorrow, but its been raining soo much lately. ian and aless and rojo came over yesterday. it was cool to see ppl. we went to see the village, yea bad movie. shamalan, im disapointed in u. then we walked back 2 my house in the rain. somehow we ended up throwing jenga pieces everywhere and my dads pissed at me cuz my dog ate one. hell shit it out in a few days anyway... so thats been my last couple of days..... interesting huh? call me so i can get off my ass and actually do something for a change. much love.
