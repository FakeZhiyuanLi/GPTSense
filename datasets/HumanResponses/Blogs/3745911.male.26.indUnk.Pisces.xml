        Hi everybody these are some keys to really come up in life. Positive thinking consider this as a art and try to follow it everyday in life and every activity in a day. We must learn to think whatever happens in life is for good. We will be a better person tomorrow.     Everything happens with a cause. The cause might be what we did earlier or what might happen tomorrow. This is truth in life guys please understand so that you will reach the heights in life.     The major advantage what we would have when we understand this in our mind is we will stop pointing down mistakes on others, You will start realizing the truth, nothing happens because of any one persons activity on you. Your way of approach will improve in all the activities you do. Difference will be noted by the people around you.    So Guys please practice this and really you will find the difference.  Ofcourse this is for me too……………………

        This is Saravanan Purushothaman like to be called as Sarav. I was born on 17th March 1978 in Chingleput in Tamil Nadu. I was brought up in Chennai. I did my schooling from Alpha Matricatulation Higher Secondary School Chennai. I like to be the topper in class but never i have been. I lost my father in the 1984 and it was my mother who did everything for me and ofcourse for our family. She is not only a good HomeMaker she is a god given gift for me and my sister.    I completed my Schooling in the year in 1995. Joined Meenakshi Amman Engineering college and completed my professional course degree in the 1999. Now playing with the Binary codes of 0 and 1.

          Hi Guys not imaginary it is real truth what i experienced today in my life. I started at around 8.40 AM from my home I have to travel from Velachery to Greams Road in Thousand light it is totally 11 KM. It was very cloudy when i started and we had a very cool air blowing in the city which we never experience in chennai often.      I started the bike and i moved slowly i was murmering the song "Vellai pura onru which i was hearing from SCV when i left my home". I normally travel around 40 Km/hr speed. The drizzling started slowly and drops started falling in my blue shirt. But it was so pleasant that it never made me to think to stop my vechile. I was atleast wearing the helmet but the people who were travelling with me were just travelling even without helmets. " Even they enjoyed the weather i beleive". It was the same till i reached the signal in Mount Road in Guindy.    The drizzling was still and the cool breeze blowing and the drizzling never made us feel we were wet. Ofcourse we were not wet. In the signal i just stopped in the white line and noticed that police Guy in the signal was standing without even wearing is Cap inspite of the drizzling. The drizzling was so quite that no body realy felt it is drizzling we should cover ourselves or atleast our heads. There were many bikes standing adjacent to me and also one girl with a green scooty and a red churidhar. Which was not much noticable at that time.    We were all watching only on the time reader which was getting reduced second by second waiting for the green signal to come. Once we saw the green signal then almost all the bikes flew in Mount road like start of the 'Bike Race' when the road was free almost in 60 to 70 Km/hr , but i was just enjoying the drive at my normal speed. The drizzling was still going by this time i reached Saidapet. I stopped in Saidapet signal this time i was able to see only the girl with red churidhar and green Scooty was standing just next to me. I was able to see her fully this time she was not wearing a helmet. Looked like a girl from Middle class family not much Make up.     Then it was a snaky drive moving inbetween the Autorickshaw,Car and Buses to reach the place near T.Nagar turning. Almost all of us were travelling adjacent to each other ( i mean the people with bikes). Enjoying the drizzling and the cool breeze flowing across us. I could see some ladies holding the dhupata's tightly because of the breeze. Ofcourse the men at the back had nothing to hold at that time. I was almost again in the same speed murmuring the song repeatedly. I found the girl travelling almost parallely with me on my right side .Hopefully i think she was enjoying the drive. The travel continued till Greams Road and then i took a left and stoppped my Vechile. I just came back of the Vechile stand from my office and had a look at the road i travelled and Sky on top took a long breath and entered the lift.     I don't know whether i have put my words correctly. I enjoyed my drive today. The residence in chennai who are at present in other places a simple statement to you all. " You have missed chennai today'.    Oh God i have prayed for my health and family wealth to you all these days. Today i would like to pray and ask you one more thing will i get many more days like today.

      Something to think about at least now, my dear friends! What is the most powerful weapon or which country is the most dangerous country? Might be whatever comes in your mind I don’t want to make wild guesses because I am not so good in GK, but guys here goes the deal go through the lines below and decide yourself whether you are right or wrong and do let me know whether I am right or wrong.         According to me it is not country which is having some nuclear bombs or it is not the country, which is having some biochemical weapons. Which should be considered as dangerous. They are all harmful only if we invoke them. There is something more than that which the world should fear about nowadays it is nothing but 0 and 1. The whole world runs in these two binary digits. Oh! My dear friends just close our eyes 2 mins and just think what could happen if the 0’s and 1’s are not functioning all the computers are not able to read the binary codes Thing what is going to happen my dear colleagues. This would not kill a certain area this would not kill a certain country this would not kill a certain group of people but it has the power to kill the world. So the real weapons are 0’s and 1’s.       The person who uses it in the right manner is called the programmer and the person who takes the other path is called the hacker. And almost according to my knowledge I think we the Indians are dominating the software field now. So friends think upon who is the real power. If all the Indian citizens realize it then No more any Indian party can say India is shining or India is developing country. They would learn to say, “We make others shine”.
