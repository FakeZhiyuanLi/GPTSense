      I am so fucking wasted today.  It's pain pills my doc gave me for h/a's after the concussion I got last month.  I'd rather be fucked-up and spaced-out than fucked-up and in pain, though neither is particularly conducive to productivity.

      The  urlLink Cowboy Junkies  is the most talented, most undiscovered, most un-quantifiable, un-labelable music group now playing.  They have done multiple albums, all good, and are now on tour.  I hope when they come to Oregon they play their new cover of Springsteen's "Thunder Road."  Good choice of a Springsteen song to do.  You can hide 'neath the covers And study your pain Make crosses of your lovers Throw roses in the rain  About the only other one I'd suggest would be "Blinded by the Light."

      The ability of the masses to have opinions without having facts remains disturbing.  Case in point:  Millions of people talking about the Massachusetts Supreme Court's legalizing of gay marriage, when they have not read the Court's opinion in the case.  It is a surprisingly well-written opinion.  Very moving.  Not as succinct as the Gettysburg Address, but within the context of appellate opinion writing, quite well done.   urlLink Here it is.

      One must always ask oneself, what's the point of posting if one has nothing to say?  But, then, why must one ask oneself such a thing?  After all, no matter how entertaining, educational, or enlightening a blog is, one will never be paid for it.  Truthfully, though, one can get attention if one writes a good blog, perhaps even get comments.  Little chance of success here.  Movie review:  Van Helsing is worth the price of admission (one of only 3.81% of movies that are).  What the Bleep Do We Know was definitely worth the price of admission.  It features talking heads who are, at least some of them, even more arrogant than me.  Speaking of which, there is a Bush campaign ad that shows Kerry with his arm around Ted Kennedy, and calls Kerry "another rich liberal elitist from Massachusetts."  I'm used to Republicans using the word "liberal" as if it were an insult--though any true Jesusian should be proud to be called liberal.  This got me thinking about the word "elitist," though.  Am I an elitist?  Obviously.  Is John Kerry?  Probably.  He apparently thinks he can run the country better than most folks, in that he is willing to try.  But is it wrong to be an elitist?  The other day, as I was sipping sangiovese and putting a sub-titled foreign art film into my DVD player, in turning on the TV I happened to catch a few minutes of Jerry Springer, before recoiling in horror and quickly pushing the play button.  This show indicates to me upon just what level of intellect and morality the commoners of this country operate.  Truly, I cannot be faulted for wanting to distance myself from them.  I am an elitist, and proud to be so.  We who are superior should stop apologizing, acknowledge it, and subjugate those lesser beings who recognize that submission to us is in their best interest, and exterminate those who are too brutish to recognize that fact.  We remain at the "minuet" stage of this blog.  I haven't really started to cut loose yet, of course.  This is all just preliminary falderal.  Stay tuned, gentle reader.  It gets better.

      The Archbishop of Portland has written a very thoughtful letter on the issue of whether politicians and others who publically take positions at odds with Catholic teaching should receive Holy Communion, and whether priests should refuse to give them Communion if they go up to receive it during Mass.   urlLink Here  is his letter.  I agree with Archbishop Vlazny that it should fall to the person to make the decision, and not the priest.  It is inappropriate for a priest to refuse Communion to anyone who requests it.  The clergy do not own this sacrament, they are merely its custodians.  They must leave it to God to judge.  Moreover, I was proud of Archbishop Vlazny for saying that a good Catholic can, in good conscience, vote for a pro-choice political candidate because the so-called "pro-life" candidate has "fail[ed] significantly in some matters of great importance, for example, war and peace, human rights and economic justice."  This is an obvious reference to Bush, and if anything Vlazny could have gone even further in expressing the duty of a person of faith to politically oppose the evil and violence which Bush has visited upon our country.  It seems I have squeaked by, once again, in remaining Catholic by the skin of my teeth.  While I wrote to Oregon's senators and Congresswoman Hooley, and engaged in other public political activity on the issue of same sex marriage, the thrust of my argument was less advocacy for same sex marriage per se, and more a defense of American traditions and doctrines of liberty and equality against an ill-conceived Constitutional amendment.  By Vlazny's analysis, I need not refrain from receiving Communion.  I do continue to pray that the Holy Spirit will guide the Church to a more enlightened view of homosexuality.  Perhaps She will do this through the work of dissenters like me, who remain, however tenuously, in the fold.

      No one should ever read any book of scripture until they have read what God has written in their heart.  Look into your heart and read what is written there.  It goes something like this:  This day I have brought you forth. I love you, and you are mine. All life is one in me. Live in my love, have love for all beings, and I will be with you to the end of time.  Anyone who tries to read something in a book about God, without reading what is in their own heart, will misunderstand what they read in a book.

      Margo's voice remains as passionate, sultry, powerful, versatile, hypnotic as ever.  The group's music remains densely interwoven, complex, languid yet driving.  Not pop music.  This is not your teenager's music group.  This is cool, intense, mature music, with mature lyrical themes.  All around a first rate album, as is the 5 song  'Neath Your Covers, Part 1  that you can get with it.  Go to the  urlLink Junkies website  and get it in Canadian dollars.  I only have one negative comment:  OSN doesn't quite match the multi-dimensional transcendence and power of the last CJ's production,  Open .  The music isn't quite as "thick."  It's not hard to figure out wherein lies the difference:  On  Open  Margo had a backup singer.  As amazing as her voice is, she just can't achieve the mind-blowing energy of, say, "I'm So Open" without a harmonizing voice that she can bounce off of and dance around and launch from.

      D.H. Lawrence said, "The cross goes deeper than we know."  And he would know, the oversexed genius that he was.  Seriously, though,  urlLink here  is a very interesting article by a feminist who is astonished to discover that there really is a yin-feminine / yang-masculine divide in the way the world works.  And she learns it by getting her yang on.  Literally.

      Every day I find someone who is on an amazing journey of self-discovery.  The nice part is, many of them are willing to make an open record of their journeys for the world.   urlLink Here's a good one.   It reminds me that I have been neglecting my own blog, either not publishing or publishing drivel, when I could be writing deep, spiritual, meaningful posts.  Well, I ask the reader to bear with me.  I had thought about having a theme for this blog, such as my shamanic work or my philosophy.  But then it would only be a log of part of my journey, not the entire journey.  So, take it as it comes, stream of consciousness.  WYSIWYG, gentle reader.  You get the deep thoughts, the silly humor, perhaps the occasional raunchy sex fantasy.  And the gaps when my regular life is moving too fast to keep a log.  It's all me.  I used to be a writer.  I did not become a writer because I love writing.  I learned at an early age I love to explore.  I love learning, and enjoyed college and law school immensely.  But more than mere learning, I love discovery, finding something that no one has ever known before, or that was once known but long lost.  At first I thought I should become a scientist.  In high school I realized that discoveries in nature were fascinating, but human nature was even more mysterious than the heart of darkest Africa, the deep ocean trenches, or even outer space.  Of course, that's the irony of Gene Roddenberry's vision,  Star Trek :  The "final frontier" is not space, but the human soul.  And, of course, that was the main theme of the series.  The  Enterprise  even looks like a stick figure, like something painted on the wall of a cave, if you look at the outline from above/below.  So I thought that being a writer or poet would be a good way to explore the human soul (priest, psychologist, lawyer--those are good, too).  But becoming a lawyer, becoming a writer, was for me becoming what Julia Cameron in  The Artist's Way  called a "shadow artist."  A shadow artist is one who does not pursue his art, but compensates by picking something in the general ballpark.  I was handed that book by a good friend when I expressed to her that I was dissatisfied with being a writer.  One of the challenges I faced in deciding to just be an explorer, to do nothing more, and nothing less, than exploring the human heart, without trying to put an established label on it, was the fear, What if I succeed in discovering great things about the soul, but no one ever knows?  What's the point?  What difference does it make?  Why make the effort?  And it is effort.  Faulkner called it "the agony and sweat of the human spirit."  I ultimately left that in God's hands (or that's how my mother would put it).  Or rather, I just made the assumption, as an initial premise, that somehow it would serve a purpose.  I did not need to keep a record, and I did not need to accomplish something, put it to use.  I am purely a theoretician.  It is for others to find whether what I discover can be made useful.  For me, the discovery alone is enough.  Nor is this blog a complete record.  For one thing, quite some time passed between the decision to explore and my starting this blog, and quite a lot of travelling occurred in the meantime, that you, reader, have not yet heard about (shamanism, bone marrow disease, etc).  Nor, despite what I wrote above, is this blog a complete account of my journey, a complete picture of me.  Rather it is a random snapshot of a vignette, a small slice, of me, taken now and again.  But in allowing the randomicity, in avoiding any self-selection, any filtering, I hope to give you a representative sample.

      I recommend these talented  urlLink folks  who teach various kinds of spiritual intimacy for lovers (or very, very close friends).  They conduct workshops at  urlLink Breitenbush  and  urlLink Harbin  hot springs retreat centers.  Both very good places to recharge one's spiritual batteries.

      I heard on the  urlLink news  today that Joan Collins is participating in a right wing group in the UK to have the UK pull out of the EU.  They seem to think that the trend of internationalization involved in participation in the EU is bad for British national identity.  I so long for the good old days.  There is nothing like being mowed down by machine guns at the Battle of the Somme, or being firebombed by the Luftwaffe, to really make you feel British!  Could anyone truly wish for a Europe like that of the 20th Century--two world wars, one iron curtain?  From the Atlantic to the steppes of Asia, from the Artic to the Mediterranean, all of Europe is at peace.  No European country is at war with another European country.  Was there ever a century before the 21st when that was true?  There was a Hundred Years War.  Is it just possible that there will be a hundred years of peace, that the entire 21st Century will pass without a war in Europe?  In the long run, internationalization is good for everyone.

      War Returns with a Vengeance as Allies Fail the Afghan People   George Bush and Tony Blair made grand promises when they took on the Taliban. They sound hollow now. What does it all mean for Iraq?   The Independent/UK, May 25, 2004 by Kim Sengupta   The road from the village of Ozbin Khol is safe no longer. The eight aid workers packed into a Toyota LandCruiser were keen to get to their destination, Sarobi, before nightfall. But a punctured tire stopped them. Two young men, carrying Kalashnikovs, their faces covered by keffayahs, came out of the darkness, lined up the passengers and opened fire, killing five.   The killings, in Paktika province, south-east of Kabul, were at the end of February. The next month, gunmen burst into a guesthouse near the southern city of Kandahar, killing three more aid workers. Two weeks ago, two Europeans, one with a Swiss passport, were stoned and stabbed to death at Bagh Chilsthan, just 15 minutes' drive from the center of Kabul.   Reports of the murders appeared in the international media, briefly, because the victims were either from the West, or had links with international relief agencies. There have been other deaths - 15 children killed by United States warplanes in raids while attempting to eliminate a warlord in December. Another dozen Afghans were killed in the next few weeks, either enemy combatants, said the Americans, or the result of collateral damage among civilians.   In Herat, internecine fighting between forces of the warlord, Ismail Khan, and the governor sent by Hamid Karzai's government in Kabul led to the deaths of 100 people, including Mr Khan's son.   These are snapshots of a continuing conflict in Afghanistan, a war of attrition taking place largely in the shadows with the focus of the world's media firmly fixed on Iraq.   The Afghan war was, of course, the first chapter of the War on Terror launched after 11 September. After a relatively quick and casualty-free campaign - for the American military, if not Afghan civilians - George Bush declared victory. Tony Blair pledged: "This time we will not walk away", as had happened following the war the mujahedin fought against the Russians with Western money and arms.   But that, say many Afghans, is exactly what the United States and Britain have done. And just as the official end to hostilities in Iraq has been followed by unremitting violence, so the war has returned with a vengeance in Afghanistan. With international interest concentrating on Iraq, aid money has dried up for the Afghans. The military bill for the Pentagon, so far, is $50bn (£27bn). The money for humanitarian work, on the other hand, has been $4.5bn. Out of that, much of the $2.2bn earmarked for this year has been diverted to military projects and emergency relief from long-term development.   Even where aid money is available, the security situation is preventing distribution. The five men killed in Paktika worked for the National Solidarity Program (SDF), which is now pulling out of 72 areas in the country.   Ihsanullah Dileri, the organization's head of co-ordination said in his Kabul office: "This is a very bad, very desperate situation. We had $60,000 to spend on each of those 72 areas, now this cannot be done.   "All these areas are badly deprived, with poor people lacking basic facilities. But I am afraid the security simply is not there for us to continue with our work. It is too dangerous."   Barbara Stapleton, of the Agency Coordinating Body for Afghan Relief (ACBAR) an umbrella body representing 90 national and international aid agencies, added: "We are very concerned about security and the deterioration of the situation. Impunity rules in the country. It's not just the NGO [non-governmental organizations] community, but the Afghan people at large who are exposed to these levels of insecurity."   There is also evidence that the American military is using aid as a means of acquiring intelligence. Delivering blankets and food to refugees at Dwamanda in the south, Lieutenant Reid Finn had no hesitation in telling journalists: "It's simple. The more they help us find the bad guys, the more good stuff they get." Teena Roberts, the head of Christian Aid's mission in the country, said: "The result of this is aid workers have become targets. I have not come across the use of aid in this way before."   After the fall of the Taliban, the streets of Kabul used to be busy until the 10pm curfew. Now they are deserted by eight in the evening, with the headlights of a few solitary cars hurtling through the darkness. Foreigners travel in convoys, with armed guards. Amanullah Haidar runs a stall 100 yards from the Mustafa Hotel in the city center, one of the few places deemed to be safe for the expatriate community to meet in the evening, where the two brothers who run it carry pistols in shoulder holsters, and guards with semi-automatic rifles man the main door.   "We are disappointed by lack of progress, lack of money, lack of jobs," said Mr Haidar, a Tajik former Northern Alliance soldier. "I remember all these people who came here from Europe and America and told us how they are going to help us. But where are the factories and the offices we thought we would get? What about the elections we were promised?"   President Hamid Karzai was forced to put back to the autumn elections because of the instability. Only 1.6 million out of 10.5 million eligible to vote have registered. In the Pashtun belt, where Taliban influence is still strong, the number of women registered is below 20 per cent.   The emancipation of women, subjugated by the fundamentalist Taliban, was one of the stated objectives of the West. Even before the war ended America's First Lady, Laura Bush, declared: "Because of our recent military gains in much of Afghanistan, women are no longer imprisoned in their homes. The fight against terrorism is also a fight for the rights and dignity of women."   According to an Amnesty International report, however: "Two years after the ending of the Taliban regime, the international community and the Afghan transitional administration, led by President Karzai, have proved unable to protect women. The risk of rape and sexual violence by members of armed factions and former combatants is still high. Forced marriages, particularly of girl children, and violence against women in the family are widespread in many areas."   After the war, dozens of girls' schools reopened throughout the country. But an Islamist resurgence has seen many of them closed down through intimidation. Families who still dare to send their female children for education can pay a terrible price. Earlier this month, three young girls, aged eight to 10, were poisoned in eastern Afghanistan, apparently as punishment for attending lessons.   The government points out, however, that four million pupils are enrolled in schools this year - including one third of the country's female children.   Twenty-five years of war have destroyed what there was of Afghan infrastructure. In a number of regions, such as the Shomali Plain, the Taliban and their Pakistani allies destroyed centuries-old irrigation systems in a scorched-earth policy against the Northern Alliance.   Following the last war, attempts were made to restore water and power. But systematic strikes by the Taliban on power lines and irrigation projects, and murders of foreign engineers, has ground much of it to a halt. At present, just 9 per cent of the population have access to electricity. Safe drinking water is estimated to be restricted to 6 per cent. The World Bank has authorized a $40m loan for water projects, but while work can begin with the funds in the north and west, it is deemed to be too dangerous in the Pashtun belt of the south and east.   The UN has stressed irrigation is essential for agriculture in a country where the overwhelming majority of the population live in rural areas. However there is no shortage of one particular crop - opium. Poppy cultivation reached a new high last year. According to the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, the area of cultivation has grown from 1,685 hectares in 2001 to 61,000 hectares in 2003. The country has the dubious distinction of accounting for 75 per cent of the world's output.

      What a remarkable series of emotions flow through my consciousness, upon learning that what I write in this blog is actually read by others, people I have never met.  On the one hand, I feel self-conscious, the way a person feels when acting silly in his backyard, perhaps a fit of unrestrained air guitar when a favored anthem of one's youth comes on the radio, only to look up and see the heads of the neighbors looking over the fence.  Foolish, of course, to suggest that I expected privacy in a web blog.  It was not privacy, nor even anonymity, that I expected.  Inconsequentiality perhaps.  I imagined I was lost in the crowd, that nothing I said or did would make any difference or be noticed.  Which, in its own way, gave me freedom, the illusion of privacy.  I could write whatever I wished.  I learned several years ago the joy of having an intimate pen pal, a confidante with whom I can share everything (now I have several such persons).  It is like an interactive diary, in a way.  Often I write something to a friend, expressing my innermost thoughts and feelings, thoughts and feelings from so deep within myself that I am not aware of them, do not understand them, until I see them written in a letter to a friend.  A blog is both like and unlike that.  One writes, behind an anonymous  nom de plume , not knowing the identities of the few or many readers whom one contacts.  But now, I cannot deny that the readers exist.  I have been told, in no uncertain terms, "You are not alone."  But how am I to feel about that?  I am surprised by my sense of duty, of obligation.  The show must go on!  Ahh, my public, my loyal readership.  I feel bound to produce, and it better be good!  I must entertain, educate, edify.  I feel all the anxieties of any human in public--what have I done?  Is it good enough?  Must I do more?  So, thank you, Olive!  If you are ever in Portland, there is a little tea shop in the Belmont neighborhood called the Tao of Tea.  Great little place, very intimate, warm atmosphere.  Excellent variety of tea and Indian quisine, good prices.  Whatever you get, order a side dish of calamatas--they are exquisite.

      I am back.  I could use the fact that my computer has been in the shop as an excuse for recent silence, but really it's just focus on other things.  Jesus said to Thomas, "Blessed are those who have not seen, yet believe."  I would say that goes for people like  urlLink Wendy  who are able to believe in something divine even though they don't have a pre-packaged, ready-made, air-tight theology to explain it.  Those who insist on such fundamental air-tightness are, in my mind, doubters.  It's the agnostics who are the real faithful.  They show the real trust, that God will give them whatever info and guidance they need to live rightly, but no more.
