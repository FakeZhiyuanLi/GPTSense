      Him: if you don’t mind can I say something?  Me: yea go ahead.  Him: (Looking at my french beard) if you dont want to keep a beard at least don’t make fun of it.  Me: That’s between me and My Allah and I walked out.  After Maghrib prayers, mosque next to office building.

      So far so Good, was able to avoid sleep, thanks to another marathon meeting. Good thing is we have been able to come with the design of the initial requirements and now comes the approval and after that implementation.&nbsp; Since three days I am listening to EP - Rahguzar and its on constant repeat, at times I get bored of it and close down my winamp but after a while play it again. I think it is the combination of music, vocals and lyrics.  There are threats of terrorist attacks on Mosques and Imam Barghas&nbsp;during jumma time, May Allah keep us all safe and protect us from such acts Ameen.  Adios

      Ok I wasn’t like that, I never used to scold people on their acts (read annoying acts). Never ever used to get frustrated or agitated with extra work load or pressure inserted in order to get the work done. Tense yea but no signs of displeasure. I would never allow people remarks/comments regarding me get on top of my head and blow me. This isn’t Saad I knew, this isn’t me. Recently I have noticed a change in me, I would easily get annoyed if loaded with extra work and having people constantly inquiring about the status. I would pass angry glance at drivers(specially bikers) &nbsp;making stupid moves on road (I still believe their licenses should be snapped and they should be whipped for their acts). I would make sure to have a talk with the person who either steps on me in bus or blocks my way or just bumps me without caution.&nbsp; And yea I would even yell at myself like I feel right now coz&nbsp;its 2:45 AM and i shud be in bed not here posting argghh. Couple of days back I asked a colleague to ---k off just because twice he called me “badey mian” (I still feel he was rude) but that doesn’t give me right to show him my middle finger. And yea I would show it to any driver who would honk his horn for no reason. Two months back I had again lost my cool, when a colleague was constantly asking me when I will be done with my work and that too 15 minutes after assigning it and we both knew it wont take less than 2-3 hours. This is not me. My GIKI friends would agree ( I hope they do :))   When I came back to Karachi, I used to find it quite silly when people show ed&nbsp; their anger at each other. Then I had this fear that one day I might be one of them and now when I look at myself, I feel my fear is turning into a reality. I am becoming one of them, frustrated of this world, wanting to get things done their own way, having thin temper control line. But I don’t want to be them, I want to be once again ultra cool and be a person who would shrug off any remark, any annoying act with a smile. I want to be Saad again.

      So they butchered them, Its on the news right now that the both Pakistanis who were&nbsp; kidnapped in Iraq have been killed ruthlessly. This wasn’t supposed to happen, the script wasn’t written for such darkness. Whatever and wherever went wrong might have dire consequences. My heart doesn’t agree to the fact that sons of same ummah (if there is any) are responsible for this crime. It hasn’t sunk in properly yet. But this is what reality is, it might just stop our government from sending troops to Iraq. The sacrifice might save many more innocent lives.  But what about those families? Someone’s beloved husband, someone’s dear father, someone’s brother and someone’s guardian. Will someone replace those shoulders? Will someone be there to heal their pain.  May Allah give them place in Jannah and provide patience and means of living for the suffered families.

      Ok if u guys want to take the experience of limopani one step further, try the following recipe. For those who have no idea what limopani is, let me give an intro. Its basically a sachet of lemon juice and it tastes simply great, very much like fresh lime water. So here you go get ready for the ride of making a great limopani slush.  Note: This will make 2 to 3 glasses.   5 cups ice cube , crush it so that you save the blades of the mixture and yourself from wraith of your mom.  1.5 cup water.   3 sachet of limopani .  6 tea spoons sugar  or as you desire.  Place everything in the blender/mixture. Blend until smooth. Pour into glasses and have time of your life ;).  Have fun and do try Adios  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      And Yessssssss we have done it, finally have&nbsp;beaten India comprehensively, although we could not get a bonus point and the Indian commentators made sure that they ruin our party by mentioning it again and again and again. We might not reach the finals, but this win was very important. Defeat today and we might have seen the end of Pakistani cricket. But no we are back, although its way too early to say that things might change but at least we have got ourselves a breather. Lets hope this victory brings some consistency and professionalism in our cricket and might transfer some in our daily lives. I have a strong belief ,you all can disagree, Sports especially cricket can play a big role in&nbsp;reviving&nbsp;our Nation. Majority have lost faith in it but it can all come back with few good years and one World cup will add a cherry on top of the cream. Lets hope and pray for this Nation  Adios

      So far it looks all good 223/3 in 39 overs, quite a good going for Team in Green(that is the official name or will be). Shoaib Malik coming up with a century while batting at number 3 and I am still not convinced that he should bat at this number, he is too vulnerable against swing and seam. Either Inzi or God knows who should bat at this spot. Anyhow still I feel no score is enough against this Indian batting line up, lets just hope that it continues the way its going right now. Till then  Adios

      Something is not right and I am feeling it quite intensely right now. I want to scream out loud, but I can’t. I don’t want to do any work, but I am working. There is a shit load of work to be done btw(assigned by two different team leaders one after the another). I don’t want to talk to anyone, but I am. I don’t want to listen to any music, but I am and definitely I don’t want to joke around, but guess what I am!!!!&nbsp;

      Sami D(Durrani) aka White Jazz&nbsp;will fly from Karachi tommorow, he will be leaving for Multan and then on 6th of August for his PHD (don’t get wrong guys , he is just 25)studies to Florida. Our friendship started on GIKI chat server. White_jazz(Sami), Acrobat(me) and nightshade(Mansoor, my batchmate) three of us used to keep those channels alive around 2-3 am. From there our friendship got kick started, it was most unusual of combination. I guess many people had difficulty digesting it :). He was known to be from the burger generation of GIKI and you all know me :) (I know what are you saying Awais). But I guess it wasn’t the reason of our friendship :). It was built on pure trust and care. But yea we do have common interest in books and music (and yea his awesome cycle too ;) ) which helped. We both helped each other during tough times in my last year at GIKI.  Sami fell in love with the very lovely Annie and mashAllah say both are engaged now and inshAllah will be getting married pretty soon. And I know what difficulties they both had but still got through.  Last year He got job with Unilever which brought him here to the city of lights. Although rare but whenever we had a get together it was amazing, but as it always happen in metropolitan city thanks to long distances and hectic job we could not meet on regular basis and this is the one regret I will ever have in life.  All the best for the future Sami and May Allah help you. You were an amazing friend in GIKI and after it and I hope it remains all the time. I Thank you.  &nbsp;  Adios

      Opportunities, At times in life we wait for the opportunities of our own preferred choices. We would wait for them for a long time. During the whole waiting process, quite a few opportunities of lesser or no preference pass by and we let them pass. We do not even give a second thought of riding on those opportunities. And so it happens most of the time when our preferred opportunity doesn’t arrive, we are forced to take the non preferred one. But the difference is we end up losing considerable amount of time. The time in which we could have achieved a lot and won a lot. We could have been lot ahead of&nbsp; what we ever imagined to be. So my advice to you is, don’t always end up waiting for chances of your own liking, if u ever get a secondary or tertiary choice always give second thought to it. Check all the parameters and if its worth it go for it, you never know where you end up.  &nbsp;  Adios  &nbsp;PS: I could have written it quite well, just am in ------g mood right now so this is all I could do. But I believe you guys are intelligent enough to interpret it on your own.

      Barely 20, his seat was hanging from the roof top 5 floors above the ground. Two rubber wires and 2 ropes were holding his chair. Ropes condition indicated that they have undergone maintenance work with couple of knots on each rope. He himself is wearing a safety belt, no helmet and no jacket to minimize any damage. Legs between a sealed rod and chair he rests his feet on the window’s edge. His face showed an image of a scared man, he wasn’t purely confident of his safety. But perhaps getting the job done as quickly as he could was his utmost priority. With shaking hands he was holding roller in his one hand and trying to balance his seat with another. Whenever he gave an extra push to roll his roller on to the glass his seat would take a big swing and he would struggle to balance it. Started from 8th floor he had come down to fourth his mission was half done. How many times he must have done that before? Risked his life for what we call “earning”, atleast he is far better than the one who beg for living, far better than those who live on “under table resources” and far better than those who feed on the Meager ones.  But is he responsible for his own safety?  What if, with some bad stroke of luck he has an accident? Who will compensate his family? Who will feed his dependants? This is what I call Life. This is what is I call Pakistan, where price of life is maybe of few “Paisas” or even lesser. I must say he is Brave Man. He is a Window Cleaner…  PS: Check out this new link on my side bar it goes  urlLink "Elena's Motorcyle Ride through Chernobyl" . Its about a journey through the horrors of Chernobyl. Very intresting Read.

      Sunday started around 16:30 PM. After having breakfast + lunch, tuned star sports to watch Silver stoon F1 Grand prix. My mom is a big fan of Schumi(Michael Schumacher) and shes usually the one who reminds me of the race. She will follow it from start till end,  will discuss taking over maneuvers and keeps me updated if I slip around. She specially enjoys the podium ceremony. I guess I have inherited my sports genes from her. One thing I must say about Schumacher, no matter if it was his 80th win he celebrated it as if it was his first. Its just got to show how much he loves to win and still has hunger to win. And There has never been any doubt about his mental strength, a topic I want to write about.  In evening watched Black Fish perform. They were truly awesome, quite creative with loads of fun. Went with Hammad(my younger bro). Crowd was too western for my liking but I was concentrating solely on the show. At the end, the whole trip costed me quite a few bucks which has thrown my budget out of proportions. But that’s the story most of the time, last fifteen days are always spent in tight zituation(read situation). Which means I wont be attending next three shows of Black Fish (sniff sniff). One thing for sure Umar was the best of them all and it will require some special stuff to reproduce similar kind of show in his absence. Good luck to them.  Transport was a major issue today YET again and bharams of cab drivers really piss me off now. Yea I will keep whining about it so get used to it. Apart from work working on 2 hobby projects, one I am developing “game of pong” in Visual C++. The game is quite simple but since am doing VC after some time that too GDI so there is a lot to learn. Still haven’t decided on AI(Artificial Intelligence) of the game but will think about it too. My Computer science buddies are welcome to make suggestions. Second is in C#(read C sharp) which involves converting few csv files into a format more suitable for another program, so that my friend can go away with the manual work of cleaning off those files. But its getting kinda irritating now. Lets hope by Tomorrow I make some progress in it. That’s about it.  Adios  PS: Right now I am missing  urlLink GIKI  days and life there. Even though Its been 4 years but still cant get out of it. Maybe havent been able to adjust socially after it. No there is more to it , what I really miss is not being around my friends, My hostel room,Ather's room,Khokha chai/beef fry/haleem and parathas, water figths,Activities we used to do,late night chappas of assignments,jamming sessions,#roundadbout,#lunacy and loads more. This will take quite a many posts so I will end it here.

      Saturday ends and Sunday begins, though its 5 AM and I should have been sleeping by now but I don’t feel like. Slept from 6 till 10  reason, was feeling bit feverish, still do. So  urlLink Silent spring  departs. We twice had phone conversations today. He wasn’t happy how the things went about with his mom today., I just hope before leaving it was all patched up. He did sound as if he doesn’t want to come back, but I know he will. His family means a lot to him. I have suggested him to go for MS. He should do MS in film making etc etc. He is hell of a talented bloke.   Awais my  urlLink GIKI  buddy called from Paris today, he is there for a course and damn he is having fun in roller coasters and joy rides of Disney ;). He is a shy guy so there is no possibility of beach ventures * grin*. I wish him all the best for the course I know inshAllah he will do great. Tomorrow I will be attending play by Black Fish, you can read all about them in their community on  urlLink orkut . I am hoping for a good time. Till then  Adios  PS: whats wrong with my sidebar(its more of a footer now) I think its either the post size or number of posts, any idea anyone?

      Had flu all day long with terrible sneezing. Initially I thought it is one of those sinus allergy stunts which happen regularly to me but now I fear its turning into a regular flu/cold scenario errrr and I don’t want that. Lets pray for the best.   Met  urlLink silent springs  today(after 3-4 months) at pizza hut mid night deal, infact just came back an hour ago. He is off to his trip to Iran, so we decided to meet up. I just hope it proves to be a positive milestone in his life. I am sure he will be posting stuff from there hopefully with pics from his newly bought digi cam. He is a troubled soul and I just wish that when he comes back things take a U turn, inshAllah.   Bus traveling in Karachi is no more less than a severe mental and physical torture. You are pushed , squashed and suffocated to extreme. Not to mention the manner in which these buses are driven which clearly shows worth of your life is not even in pennies. Still I don’t get why we board loaded buses, maybe we know all the buses will be same no matter how long we wait for or I think usually we are quite late with our schedule so we board whatever bus we get. Although new transport schemes have been launched but firstly they have limited routes secondly they have fallen into similar category of “thoosoo jitna thoos sako”. So as long as some dramatic steps are taken we will end up being treated as Animals and Animals we are.  Adious

      Call you up in the middle of the night Like a firefly without a light You were there like a blowtorch burning I was a key that could use a little turning  So tired that I couldn’t even sleep So many secrets I couldn’t keep I promised myself I wouldn’t weep One more promise I couldn’t keep  It seems no one can help me now, I’m in too deep; there’s no way out This time I have really led myself astray  Runaway train, never going back Wrong way on a one-way track Seems like I should be getting somewhere Somehow I’m neither here nor there  Can you help me remember how to smile?  Make it somehow all seem worthwhile How on earth did I get so jaded?  Life’s mystery seems so faded  I can go where no one else can go I know what no one else knows Here I am just a-drownin’ in the rain With a ticket for a runaway train  And everything seems cut and dried, Day and night, earth and sky, Somehow I just don’t believe it  Runaway train, never going back Wrong way on a one-way track Seems like I should be getting somewhere Somehow I’m neither here nor there  Bought a ticket for a runaway train Like a madman laughing at the rain A little out of touch, a little insane It’s just easier than dealing with the pain  Runaway train, never going back Wrong way on a one-way track Seems like I should be getting somewhere Somehow I’m neither here nor there  Runaway train, never coming back Runaway train, tearing up the track Runaway train, burning in my veins I run away but it always seems the same

      Monday ended quite well unexpectedly, I was able to advance to next level in swimming which I was struggling to do so. I know one nothing although I learn sports well(many will disagree with well) I am a slow starter usually take time to get in terms with the standards but once the I get in flow its always fun. Lets hope this experience is a similar one too.  Tuesday started quite bad, missed my colleague who was supposed to pick for office. That was big misunderstanding which resulted in me arriving office late by 20 minutes. I have noticed one thing if this event had occurred 2-3 years ago I would have taken it quite calmly but today I didn’t. I was pissed and it took till lunch hour to get me back to normal. :). Nakhray hogayein hain meray this is bad. I need to be same old Saad again. Maybe these are the effects of living in Karachi, I love this city but sometimes I feel it does take its toll on you. Especially bus traveling Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa. It’s a perfect way to mentally torture you, unless you become  Numb to it which unfortunately I haven’t :(.  Anyways got back home wasn’t feeling well so didn’t go to pool and I know I have missed an important session I wasn’t supposed to take break. Khair kul daikhtay hain kiya hota hai. At home I called couple of friends whom I wasn’t in touch for couple of months. I am on a “reestablish-old-connections” mission. It was good to have a chat with them. But its really tough to stay in touch with every one. There are so many old friends I am not in touch with, really miss those days. Likewise there are people who don’t bother to stay in touch. I mean I know if I don’t stay in touch with them nothing will remain,  should I let go?? Oh well its 3:00 AM will talk on this topic some other day. I just wish I had more time 24 hours don’t seem to be enough anymore.  Adious

      It seems to me Monday blues has hit me hard. The moment I sat on my PC chair I am feeling low on energy both physically and mentally. Maybe something has got to do with the dinner I had last night at my cousin’s reception hmmmmm sounds fishy.  I had to push myself hard to work, hardly listened to any music, cracked around any jokes. Just lazed around and now I feel like screaming AAAAAAAAAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa. Nope didn’t help much. Even had caffeine but no effect at all, maybe I will rush home early today and have some rest. It just might only be a bad tummy. Sunday as usual was best in boredom that’s why I sleep on Sundays as much as I can. This Sunday wasn’t different. Woke up at 4 pm (that was 12 hours sleep), worked for 2 hours, and went to Saloon to get my French beard done. Though I slept out the whole time I was there, yes I have this thing of dozing off at odd places. I bet I can even sleep in rickshaw :D. Back home again slept for 40 minutes, got ready for the reception and then it is all the same. But the worst was kept for the last; yes Greece beats Portugal the host nation to win Euro 2004. That was just unbelievable as if Kenya wining the cricket world cup(with full apologies to Kenyan cricket fans). Although Greece played very well but they never deserved to win, their style of football is the most boring anyone could ever imagine. Their strategy was simply too negative “score one goal and then defend with 11 players”. You guys can disagree with me, but I don’t care. I love attacking football and will keep on supporting it. And for me the best team of the tournament was Czechoslovakia. They should have won this one, sigh. Its 4:45, 45 more minutes then am off.  Adious

      Its 4:35 Am and am just done with the new comments box. Also was able to edit its color scheme not sure if this one is any better(comments please)And also I think I need to reduce the font size of my posts what you guys say? Ok so day ended up with one good news  urlLink Maria Sharapova  won :D (also I got my salary, its party time ;)), Although I couldn’t watch the match. I was in office waiting for my friend to get done with his work  so I could get ride for home, finally did at 8:30. But I managed to check live score on Wimbledon’s official site. It was a goooood match shouldn’t have missed but am used to miss good things in life. Anyhow time to sleep now, I am sure I will be having a nasty headache in morning God help me!!!!  Damn KESC voltage is fluctuating and my PC’s UPS isn’t working either.  PS: Because of the new comments box your old comments are missing I will try to put those in new system, till then have fun with this one. Its 5:00 AM now

      Looks like its gonna be another boring day, there is nothing planned for the evening yet and doesn’t seem like.Wasnt much work in office today either and thats a big big big surprise. I am still searching for a 3rd party comments box, found couple of vendors but the templates they got simply suck or maybe I am not searching hard enough. Good news I just heard a sec back, funds have transferred yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay. That might just trigger a dinner or something. Btw today its Wimbledon Female’s Singles final but I think I will miss fair part of it. And I am supporting  urlLink Maria Sharapova  “Go Maria Go”. Though it would be sad she will not have her fan cheering her :(.   Now few words in tribute of  urlLink Marlon Brando .  He was a legend and a complete actor. He thrilled millions around the globe with his acting. There can be as good movies as God Father but there wont be any Marlon Brando.  Adious

      So it all begins, after resisting for so long finally decided to write my own blog. I have had enough of reading your blogs, I tell the world.  Although I must say it will not be as intellectual as silent spring’s or as funny as of Virtuous vibes or Zenia’s or as captivating as that of Crazed Insomniac or Atrophying Senses’s, but am sure it will be mixture of all, I am good in copy paste you know ;).  Friday has always been a dull and least productive day as far as work is concerned and if you had an hearty lunch and got over stuffed then it gets really hard to go through the rest of the hours. Today isnt any different, nine of us(newly employed, although I am here from 6 months now) had to treat 14 other members of our department. So KFC was decided as a venue. and all went well. The only issue left is, it was my CC which was charged aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa and I hate recovering money (do I sound like shylock here???) Since coming back to office I am yawning and having ocassional 5 minutes naps :) and writing this.  By the way My name is Saad and I work as a Software Engineer. Work as usual has its ups and downs and to look forward for the day I started a sporting activity but for some odd reason struggling with that which is making me more and more frustrated as days are passing by and now I don’t have anything to look forward for the whole day, yikes. Gtg now  Adious

      Another burst up at work, not did I shout at anyone I just quietly asked him to go away. My inability to tolerate criticism specially negative remarks and sudden burst of rage might land me in difficult situations. Most of the times I find myself innocent and blamed wrongly for mistakes or lack of quality work and when it gets extended to a certain period I just refuse to cooperate, I am not sure I might be wrong in thinking myself innocent and they might be right or maybe I am right. I am scared that this unprofessional attitude might become permanent part of me and I might develop this as a habit, this can be fatal. I should keep my cool and deal with them some other way some other time, showing anger will not stop them nor will satisfy my soul.  One thing I believe that it’s a gradual process, starts off with a feeling of lack of achievements taking along numerous regrets mixed with anger of making stupid decisions and all it needs a remark or two from people I dislike most and rest is history. So either I need to sort it out myself or may take some anger management therapy, situation isn’t out of hands right now but I want to get rid of now and forever.

Sha la la la...sha la la la Sha la la la...sha la la Sha la la la...sha la la la Sha la la... I said love, love rescue me   I said love Climb up the mountains, said love I said love, oh my love On the hill of the son I'm on the eve of a storm And my word you must believe in Oh, I said love, rescue me Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah...   Yeah I'm here without a name In the palace of my shame I said love rescue me   I've conquered my past The future is here at last I stand at the entrance To a new world I can see The ruins to the right of me Will soon have lost sight of me Love rescue me

      Sunday was fun, went out of town with relatives. And guess where we went, to the land of VL yes you have guessed it right Balochistan. My uncle is posted at Soumyani( read Soum Yani) beach, and a visit was long due so last Sunday was chosen for it( although I wasn’t happy about it, I get only one day for a looonnnggg sleep and it was ruined). After two hours of bus ride which I believe is the most fun part of any outing, we got to his place. It wasn’t the kind of surrounding I was expecting it to be or the image that was drawn in my mind by different people was slightly more breathtaking. Nevertheless still the scene was a great sight. His house is located on top of the cliff and from the tip one can see sea waves crashing against the shore. And I have heard at night it becomes quite a scene. Anyhow after lunch had little bit of soccer before we all got exhausted, it was good to see I still got my touch ;). Went to beach afterwards and you all know what happens next. But the best part was, there was no one on the shore except us and the poor crabs yessssss we had crabbing. I think we caught about 20 of them.   So on Monday we decided to have the crab party, I asked for a recipe from my office cook who happens to be ex-gymkhana cook and he suggested to me quite a mouth watering one. I won’t go into the details of how we managed to get eatable stuff out of  the crabs (it was quite a eeewwwww for many). Anyways in the end the fried crabs came out pretty well and tasty ;). One thing which made me feel bad is the way you kill a crab, the only way to do is to boil them dead and that is a very very painful and slow death. May Allah forgive us.

      Ah weekend(don’t we love it) is here, although its been a painfully slow day(maybe because I am waiting so eagerly for clock to turn pass 6 PM). Major activities of the day consisted of handling adhoc tasks, avoiding sleep ;), reading articles (I will post an interesting link at the end of this post), and did I mention lunch at subway.  Resuming after 40 minutes…  Ok its 6 pm now yaaaaaaaaay time to rush home, though it doesn’t feel good when u want to run away from office and head home. It gives an impression that something is wrong, u aren’t interested in work anymore or not comfortable with environment. May be it's because of a strong inner feeling that I am not doing what I always wanted to do. Anyways time to go now.  Cheers  PS: check out this link  urlLink http://www.popsci.com/popsci/computers/article/0,12543,592948-1,00.html . Its about a simulation game which predicts states of different countries in future.

      Parents are the most precious blessings of Allah, there is simply no replacement of them. Two weeks back a colleague of mine lost her mother because of illness, today she lost her father(nobody exactly know the real reason). This is one of the tragic events one could hear about and to go through it, must be a real pain. Not yet recovered from one loss and another inflicted upon them. May Allah bless her parents and place them in Jannah. Provide all of her family sabar Ameen. Incidents like these refresh our minds about us being mortals and the importance of parents in our lives. So respect your parents no matter how much you disapprove of their decisions/actions. Never ever lose your cool on them(That’s for you Saad). If any one of you don’t have one or both of them please pray for their Maghfirat that’s the best gift you can offer them.
