        Idealism is what precedes experience; cynicism is what follows.     -David T. Wolf (1943 - )    In talking with a peer at work today that I greatly admire, I asked his opinion on one of the politically charged matters that is plaguing my workplace of late.&nbsp; My quandry is that the mandate from my boss conflicts directly with some of the workplace values I am supposed to exemplify.&nbsp; True that they are some of the lesser values: he's not asking me to do anything illegal or blatantly immoral, and most people deem his practices to be savvy business ones.&nbsp;   But the position it puts me in is as follows: whenever I talk to one of my coworkers, I will take the information they volunteer and use it against them to promote my boss' political agenda.&nbsp; He encourages this.&nbsp; He expects this.&nbsp; I strain against this because it just doesn't seem right to me, but this guy plays hardball.&nbsp; Ultimately, it will be his way or the highway.  In talking to my coworker, an IT veteran of 25 some-odd years, he shook his head and smiled and said "M, I forget how young and idealistic you are.&nbsp; Those of us who have worked for some time know that this is just the way things are, and if it isn't one thing, it's another.&nbsp; You just put your head down, and muddle through the ambiguity as best you can, and do the job you are paid to do."  I have trouble with this but my coworker assures me that everybody knows the rules of this game in a corporate environment and that I will learn them the hard way as well.&nbsp; Is he right?&nbsp; Do I yield to my bubbling cynicism so soon?&nbsp;

      Given that I'm supposed to be working towards a guruship in social computing, I figured it was high time I got a blog, even if no one on the internet ever reads it.    I guess I don't really understand what all the fuss is about.  I mean, how do you know when to blog something?  Only when you have something really interesting to say?  Blog a little everday, just to autowitter gibberish, and some gold will emerge?  Who is really going to care anyway?  Who wants to go around reading random people's thoughts?  No offense to those of you who may be out there, but why are you really here?  Does this give you some insight into the human psyche you didn't have before?    Maybe the majority of succesful blogs rally the audience around a certain community proposition, or common interest.  But most of what I've seen thus far seems like diary entries that are deprived of all of the interesting private tidbits you'd ordinarily see in a diary for fear that somebody the author knows might be reading it.    Well...I guess we'll find out.
