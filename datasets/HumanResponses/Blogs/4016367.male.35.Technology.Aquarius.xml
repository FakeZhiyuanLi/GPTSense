      So, not much during the week. Trying hard not to put work stuff up here because nobody is interested, not even me ;) Had Katester pop in for a flying visit and chitchat. Not sure why she keeps coming over, she's so annoying ;) Of course that's not true but since she'll read this at least once I thought I'd better put something in :) Otherwise not much going on at the moment, running through the work/sleep/work cycle as per usual. This weekend is looking busy, working all day then going to He Jam's birthday celebrations. I think i'm also supposed to pop around to Kim's to see off Shaz and Mikey on their tour de aus. Also the current plan is to pop down to the parental home to do some IT support and drop off some cash. But that all depends on how much I work and drink on Saturday :)

      Another Lazy sunday on the couch. :) Watched The Bill from the night before, did some junk food shopping, bought some DVDs, watched some DVDs, etc. If you're looking for the collection it's  urlLink here . Found a copy of the BT performance at Two Tribes this year. Daimo will like it I'm sure, as we were there and he's always asking if I've got any new mixes from this year. Anyway, not much else on. Not even sure why I'm posting, but you get that on the big jobs. :) Last night was a good night, just down at PAs with Joe and Danny, while&nbsp;Cathy, Steph and 'Tine&nbsp;were off handbag shopping. Then they joined us later and we all had Parma's* and Pots and a Perve (* Joe having the Vegetarian Foccacia since he's a stinking vego)  So we all got pretty pissed and took a taxi home, just another good night out talking crap and laughing ourselves silly. :)

      So last night was a good Friday. Left Capers at about 6 and headed up to a new bar that Joe was interested in checking out, Loop on Meyers place. Not too shabby, some nice visuals, fairly dark but not so dark as to be impossible, not too crowded. So Joe, Daimo and I were there for about 1.5 hours and then Kate and Simon showed, followed not long after by Steph and 'Tine.   Pretty good, stayed there for a few rounds, then Joe and 'Tine went home and the rest of us headed off to St Jerome, which is one of Daimo's hangouts that I'd been keen to check out. Pretty cool, weird in that it's kind of leftover space, part inside, part outside under a tarp, part back laneway, part next building over. Not many bars have rain falling into part of them :).   Had some good Kate conversation, which was an essential part of the evening. The walk over consisting of a discussion about Melbourne and our bars that are up laneways. I think I'm not alone in thinking that a bar really needs to be in an obscure location to be cool ;) I mean if you can't find it then what makes you think you belong there! Just joking of course. I mean there's an element of tuth to it, in that a bar that's too popular can get too crowded or too hard to get into, so what's the point. Whereas the little out of the way places can usually manage to stay un-busy for a while.  So the night was a good one, some good conversation, and two cool bars added to the list. Kate's keen to go to Croft's, so we might have to go back there. I'm keen to see what the middle level looks like, as I haven't been there since they opened it up. Hopefully Boze is still on the door so we won't have any hassles.  Anyway, that's it for today. S

      Yeah, so everyone has a blog now, and I'm sure about 85% of them start with 'everyone has a blog now' - so here's mine.

      Up bright and early, as we’re all keen and the kids need to be mobilized to get them all to ski school by 9:45am. I ski alone for a large part of the morning, heading over to Ruined Castle and doing about 6 runs before I have to queue for the chairlift. Spend a lot of time on Father Foster’s listening to Prodigy and Red Hot Chilli Peppers and bouncing down the hill working on my short turn technique. A fabulous morning over at the castle, where I was later joined by Adrian and Rodney. We skied all over the castle and then zapped over to the Summit where my knees started to cramp really badly, so I went back to the lodge for lunch :) After lunch was back at the castle for a few more runs and then stopped early due to the return of the bad knees :) Monday night also saw a moto cross trick jump exhibition, the first time on snow in the southern hemisphere, situated right outside the lodge, so all we had to do was walk out on to the heater alcony and get a great view of the 4 riders doing flying supermen, kickers, and even a backflip. One of the guys tried his first backflip in the snow and didn’t quite make it, so he left the bike while it was still upside down and slammed it down into the big snow ramp, scary for him, ut highly entertaining for us :)

      7am in Rowville. Not a pleasant concept at all, awake at 5am after a good solid 3 hours sleep, and cruising out to the Hillier’s place where we were all meeting up. A large mountain of food and stuff, spread across three cars, one of them a crew-cab triton ute, so it had the lion’s share :) On the trip are: Sharon and Adrian Hillier, with kids Zack, Cassie and Jade. Rodney and Jim brother and friend of Adrian’s, Chris and Danielle Cawood and daughter Tamara (pronounced ta-MAR-a). Chris and Tamara (pronounced TAM-ra) Stilwell and their children Caylie and Colin. Pretty good drive, stopped at McDonalds Glenrowan for fuel and breakfast and then stopped at Mt Beauty for chains. Beautiful view of the mountains on the drive up the Alpine Highway, beautiful clear skies made it possible to see the entire mountain range covered in snow, the best I’ve ever seen, absolutely stunning. Also, a real bonus, we didn’t miss the turn off to Mt Beauty this time :) Arrived on the Mountain about 1pm, just in time to meet Chris and Danielle, who came up via bus as they now live in Perth and had flown in to Albury and gotten a lift to Mt Beauty with Chris’ parents. The Oversnow transport at Falls Creek is really cool, big tracked vans, like those use in the Arctic and Antarctica. So we load up all the stuff and grind up the mountain to the lodge. Every year we stay in the same lodge, Cummings no 7, which is located at the top of the village bowl, just near the Eagle chair to the main areas and also just near the Summit chair to the advanced area around summit and international. Right in the centre of everything, easily able to ski in and out. :) I resume my role as king of the kids, performing both as court jester, punching bag, adventure playground and chief source of shoulder rides :) I think they sense that I never really grew up ;)

      Today was all about preparing for the ski trip tomorrow. In theory. In actuality it involved sitting around watching movies and surfing the net and only doing preparation for the ski trip at the last possible moment, finishing at 2am instead of the preferred 9pm :)

      Well, what else does a Friday bring but drinking :)  Started with two work groups getting together at Feddish bar, coincidentally ending up right next to each other, stealing some space that had been booked to another group from our work (but not our area) but we didn't feel too guilty, they had space for about 30 people and only 5 showed up :) It was pretty good, hanging out with Clare, Peta,Nicki, Bec, Raylene, Sharon D, Joe, Damien, Mick, Steph, Lee, Matt, Kylie, Jamie, Amber, Belinda, Lochie, Amelia. Turned into an amusing night watching Joe try to survive being in a group of some many women that he had snogged (or more) and still trying to make his move on another :)  So much fun was had by all on the banks of the Yarra, consuming alcohol with great abandon until happy hour ran out, and then still drinking fairly quickly :)  Then it was off to The Lambs Go Barr in Fitzroy with Mick and Steph to meet up with Kate and her crew. That was pretty nice, had a few more drinks and had some nice long conversation with the Katemeister, even managed to meet her friend Kerry from Canberra that she has been hanging out with a bit.I must say that I very much enjoy Kate's company. I don't think I've ever been bored in her presence and could converse with her for hours. Her friend Kerry is very cool too, she has that Canberra intellectual thing going, so she's very articulate and seems able to converse seriously on silly topics without batting an eye :)

      Ok, so now we're washing the cushions off the couch, which we don't own but it belongs to my flatmate's sister :) the covers say Professional Wash Only, but we figure we'll give it a go in the washing machine and see what happens. I mean they're cream coloured covers, getting yellower every month, so something needs to be done :)  so, they're in the wash, and it will either work or not, time will tell.

      :) Well, what fun is a weekend update on the weekend? Friday: work end of project dinner, pretty good, sat at the boring end for a bit and then it ended up being the good end when more exciting people showed up. Including a couple of work people that I don't normally speak to that much, so it was good to finally have a social conversation :) Then out to Camberwell to see He Jam, Rose, Trudes, Erin, Damien and Joe. The Palace, normally a shit bar, held true, but at least it was fun lauching at the cheesy dancers, especially when Erin got up and danced in a cheesy way too :) Saturday: Nothing, bought Cool Hand Luke, Butterfly Effect and Proof, and no man can eat 50 eggs, let me tell you that! Sunday: nothing, work, boring :)  That's it!

      While I was changing the tire I noticed a legacy from the day trip Georgie and I took to the snow the other weekend. And since it was such a re-letter day, I figured I'd post the whole skitrip story here :)  So, Winter is upon us and Georgie and I figured we should get in some time up at the snow, so the scene is set, the plans made. We decide to take my car, as George needs new rear tires, and his car is a big V8 statesman, so any loss of traction on the rear would be disastrous, as the car is heavy end powerful and would slip out of control very easily. Also, every time we've gone to the snow in recorded history, we've taken his car, so it was my turn. My car is overdue for a service, but not really hurting from it, it's in need of a new battery, but an overnight charge every 12 months covers it nicely, I also need new tires, as there's some uneven wear on the front due to a need for a wheel alignment, but there's still enough tread, and it's a small 4 cylinder front-wheel-drive, so even if it loses traction a little, it's easier to get it back under control.  The day starts as usual, very early :) The drive up is uneventful, the usual stop at Mansfield for chain hire and something to eat. Then the fun begins. Usually most of the places in Mansfield have ladder chains for hire, except a RUD shop, which had diamond chains for a good price. Now there's no RUD shop, and the main shop only had ladders. No biggie, you rarely have to fit chains at Buller on a Saturday.  As we enter the mountain we are informed that we'll need to fit chains.  This is always a bummer, especially when you discover that one of the chains is too large and doesn't fit right. But being a ladder chain, it fits ok. Except I forget about the trick to take up the slack at the end of the chain, and now I have scratches around the front quarter panel ;)  We get on the mountain, have a few runs around Horse Hill and then start to head over the other side. We ski down the the bottom of Grimmus, only to discover it's closed, due to high wind. Now our only solution is the very crowded T-Bar. As you may already know, Georgie and I are big guys, and two big guys going up a steep hill on a T-Bar are apt to joke about it breaking. This is all pretty funny, up until the point where it actually breaks. That's when it became insanely funny. We're lying in the snow either side of the T-Bar track pissing ourselves with laughter, Georgie with a T-Bar in his hand. Everyone coming up the T behind us started laughing as soon as they saw us. It was a lot of fun :) Then some ski patrollers coming up the T offered to take the broken T up for us, and we realized afterwards we'd made a mistake. From then on all the people coming up the T weren't laughing with us, they were laughing at us, assuming we'd fell off the T, rather than the T falling off on us :) The day was a serious blizzard, visibility   We stop for lunch and have some very bad food, my phone decides to reset itself, clearing all the data, leaving nothng in the memory, no phone numbers, no calendar, no extra game software. Not a big problem as I had it synched with my work machine, but It was very annoying at the time.  As we're taking the trail back to the sheltered side I have to spend 5 minutes staning in the blizzard in the middle of the trail, with nobody else in sight, that he is on the wrong trail to the village, but that he should follow it anyway, instead of heading out across the top of the hill. The trail markers are bright orand and about 10 meters apart, so you can only see the next one after you pass one, not before, and this bozo wants to strike out across country, looking for a trail he won't recognize, on a mountain he doesn't know, marked by poles he may not see, alone. I try to make it clear that he will probably die, that I wouldn't risk it myself, as I'd probably get lost and I knew what direction it was and had used the trail many times. So I think I convinced him, but got to the point where I didn't care. If you tell someone they will probably die if they do something dificult and be in no danger if they take the easy way, and they decide not to take your advice, it's not my problem anymore :)  The rest of the afternoon we spent in the sheltered side of the hill, skiing until I couldn't ski anymore due to lack of fitness :)  So we get the chair about 3:30pm and get to the ski-hire place in time to hear they just closed the mountain due to blizzard :) good timing on our part.  We go back to the car and I fix the chains a bit and we drive back down. Partway down we notice nobody else has their chains on anymore, so we stop and take them off. Not such a good idea as it turns out, and a few corners later I turn the wheel and the car doesn't turn :) we're only doing about 20 and there's a large bank of snow on the side, so it's not like we're going off the cliff, but we're still sliding into a large area of slush and snow about 20cm deep. Luckily we were going slow enough that I had enough time to get past the moment of panic and think about it. I stop trying to slow down, because if I stop in the sludge we will be bogged until someone can come and help us out, so turn the wheel hard to the side and as we enter the sludge I feed in a bit more accellerator and the car keeps it's momentum and we make the turn in the sludge ok and get back on the road. :) Georgie and I laugh a bit and we keep on going. :) What could go wrong? :)  That's about it, we return the chains, get home earlier than we thought and all is well, but bad chains, closed lifts, broken T's, blizzards, snowmaking, morons, exhaustion, and running off the road, certainly add up to a very funny day out :)

      Well, so much for plan A. The Spare doesn't have a mag wheel. I thought it did, but since I didn't check it in the five years since I bought the car, my memory had faded. No mag wheel means the great rotation plan won't work until I get the flat fixed. So now I am driving around with three mags and a spare. :)  But that's ok, I can then get the tire fixed and do the rotation as I replace it. Then I don't have to worry about having uneven tires on the front wheels, as I'll move the current rear tires to the front, maintaining rotation direction, as is recommended for radials. As if I know :) Still, it's good to know I can still change a spare in pretty short time.

      Yet another weekend winds its way along, whisking away in an alcoholic blur :)  Friday saw the weekend open with some freebie drinks at our favored bar Yak. Had a few choice beverages, drinking with the crew from work. Mainly IT but also some ex facilities (Chia and Kylie). Discussions were afoot of the Ball and how to organize the tables etc. Then I moved on from there out to Berley's house for a sendoff for Shaz and Mikey who are heading off for two months on a trip around Australia ( urlLink http://home.connexus.net.au/~drift/ ). It was a good night, caught up with Berley, Shazzy, Gerty, Troy, Mikey and Ricky. All the usual good fun, laughs a plenty. Some of the dancing was a bit of a concern, I'm not sure Troy and Shaz should ever be allowed near swing music again :)  Saturday was involved in working for a big part of the day. It was originally looking like all day, but we did some scripting and managed to get it down to finish at about 1:30, which made us all very happy indeed.  Then I did some Shopping at JB, which is my arch nemesis, and met up with Clare for a few drinks and a bite to eat. We went to transport and sat outside on the river side. They do a decent beer and very nice chips, so we just sat there overlooking the river and chatted about various things that people chat about :) It was good (as always) to catch up and it was a very pleasant way to spend a few hours, especially when I expected to be in at work :)  That night we went to Helen's birthday celebrations. It was at Tolarno's in St Kilda, on Fitzroy st, which is the pub owned by Ian Hewitson. It's a pretty good pub, and as can be expected, the food was fantastic. We were in a semi-private salon, just us and one other group, but because of our size we were still on two tables. So I sat on the table with Prue, Aaron, Kaysie, Rex, Terri, Helen and Joe. But that was really only for the meal, otherwise we mixed it up a bit. On the other table was Rosie, Damien (Kennealy), Morton, Erin, Jessie, their brother whose name I can't remember and Jess' boyfriend who I haven't met. A good time was had by all and I downed a few beers to add to the afternoon's lot. :)  Then Joe and I headed off to Twister to meet up with Clare Peta and Nikki. However, despite the fact that the girls are regulars and were recognized as such, we didn't get in. Joe and I suspect that one of the security guys (142) doesn't like us and has decided to stuff us around. Since he's the one that knocked us back twice before, for no particular reason. Anyway, so we trooped up to the Espy and had a few beers to drown our sorrows. Then Joe and I headed off home, telling the girls to give it another shot at Twister, since we figured they would have a better chance getting in without us. It's no biggie for us since we don't actually like the place and only go there to hang out with the girls. Whereas they love the place and have lots of friends there :)  So that was it so far. Now I have procrastinated enough and need to go and change a tire on my car. It got a slow leak ages ago but now it's at the point where it's super flat and won't hold up for anything more than a day. In theory I should put the spare and the good back tire on the front and put the two worn front ones on the rear, since it's a front wheel drive car. But we all know that's not going to happen, too much like hard work :)
