      OK...I've been watching the Olympics every night for about a year (or so it seems), and I'm bored already.  Went bowling tonight (Friday night is boys's night out), and didn't even miss the hype.  By the way, I averaged about 170 tonight.  Pretty damned impressive, even if I say so myself.  I kicked my buddy's ass.  He didn't win one game.  Fortunately, he's a pretty cool guy, so he still likes hanging out with me regardless.  If the situation was reversed, I can't say that I would be in an exceptional mood tonight.  Kudos to the Brick.  So, anyways, back to the Olympics.  Is it just me, or was the gymnastics competition all about who sucked the least?  It seems that with every Olympics, the quality diminishes and the lesser of the losers wins.   Maybe I was spoiled with Mary Lou Retton and that Romanian chick from ages ago.  I'd like to see a deserved 10.0 every now and then.  What does it say if these are the best competitors in the world and they screw their routines up?  For God sakes man, you've got 5 different events to practice for.  You practice every god-damned day for 4 friggin' years.  You'd think that you had it down pat by now.  That's not to say that I don't respect them for what they do, as I couldn't do a proper sit-up if my life depended on it.  But then again, that's not my career.  Big kudos to Carly Patterson and that twin guy, whatever his name is.  Performing under that kind of pressure must suck big time.  But then again, they both screwed up that horse thing...which should have never ever happened.  Which brings me to a small point.  What's with the make-up on all the US female gymnasts?  These girls are all of 16-18 years old and they've got enough make-up on to gag the 40-year old sales girl at the Clinique counter.  The make-up is bad enough, but then they put on about 10 pounds of sparkle, and add to that the blue eye shadow, and they look like every 60 year-old you see walking down the street with a shopping cart.  Blue eye shadow went out in 1982.  Get with the 21st century, girls.  If you look at the Chinese, Romanian and Russian girls (with the exception of that ugly big bird girl on the Russian team that took Silver in the individuals - I won't even try to spell her name), they had very little make-up on.  This is my point - If I am competing on an event where I want the judges to pay attention to what I'm doing, the last thing I want to do is put a ton of make-up on to draw their attention away from my routine.  With my luck, in the middle of my flying double somersault with cheese, the judge just happened to be blinded by the glare from my face glitter and I would get an 8.5 instead of an 8.6.  If you are 16, there is no shame in looking 16.  Don't try to look like a 40 year old who needs make-up.  You are going to spend the rest of your life trying to regain that youthful glow you have now.  Enjoy it while you can, and don't cover it up with base and blue eye shadow.  It's really not attractive.  Swimming seems to be going pretty well for us, and Michael Phelps is kicking some major ass in the pool.  That's always fun to watch an event and being pretty sure that your country will win.  It must suck big-time to be living in Indochina and watching your swimmers coming in 8th place every damned event.  Imagine the excitement that one time when they come in 7th place - "Woo Hoo!  We didn't come in last place!".  It's times like these that make me happy to be in the U.S.  Of course, during the Winter Olympics it's probably much better to be a Canadian.  Though that weird Canadian accent would drive me nuts after a while.  Speaking of which, the word is "Sorry", not "Sore-ey".  I'm not really looking forward to the track and field stuff, as I figure most of the winners will be hopped up on steroids and have their medals revoked anyways.  Besides, we know that all the long-distance races will be won by the Kenyans anyways.  What's with those guys?  I guess having lions and tigers chasing your asses day-in and day-out tend to make you learn to run fast.  Here in the US, it's all about trying to get to the McDonald's counter before that mother with her 10 children...and even that's only a run of about 3 feet.  I used to run track in high school.  I was really good at the long-distance races.  Only problem was that the coach decided that he didn't have enough 100-meter hurdlers.  So he switched me to that.  Of course I sucked.  But that didn't matter to him, because he was just trying to get a complete line-up for each event.  That's the kind of philosophy that fucks with our competitive effort.  Who knows?  Maybe I could have given those Kenyan dudes some competition.  Guess we'll never find out now.   I quit the team after about 3 weeks.  Then I discovered the joy of cigarettes and booze, and there was no turning back.  So, anyways, I think I'm about done with this Olympics.  I'd watch the basketball, but it comes on about 5am PST here, and try as I might, I can't do that.  I'd Tivo it, but you never would know what you are taping.  With my luck, I'd end up with 3 hours of a soccer match between Afghanistan and Belize.  Besides, the US basketball team sucks.  Individually, each player rules in the NBA.  But, put them all together, and none of them knows how to play as a team.  It's the same problem that the Lakers had last season.  A bunch of selfish superstars who couldn't play well together.  Detroit on the other hand, with the exception of Rasheed, had a team of nobodies who individually couldn't measure up to the best of the NBA, but together made an unstoppable team.  Bastards.  Oh well.  I'm done for tonight.  I'm going to hit the sack and dream about what I will write about tomorrow.  For anyone brave or bored enough to read this entire diatribe - I thank you.  For the ones who quit half-way through - I understand your pain.  Your not-so-beloved leader,  Buster

      Hi All:  This is my first attempt at "blogging". I got an email a couple weeks back from a reader that wanted to know my opinion on this service, and I thought that I would give it a shot. I'm certainly not at a lack for opinions, and I will (time permitting) try to give you a daily recap of what I'm thinking about.  I am an advice columnist. You can find my site at  urlLink www.dearbuster.com  where you can write me letters, read the letters I've responded to, and read about my general opinions on just about every topic under the sun. The site is updated every Monday with new letters, and there is a "fun stuff" section with some entertaining mpegs, jpgs, and other things of the sort.  I've been told that I'm a Dear Abby on steroids. I started doing this job when I found out that there was really no decent advice representative of the male persuasion, let alone one belonging to this generation. I'm really enjoying it, and I love telling people what I think of their problems. Unfortunately, my honesty sometimes hurts, and I don't get much "repeat" business from people who write me. I guess that they can't "handle the truth". Either way, it's entertaining - at least to me. Hopefully some of you will find it entertaining as well.  I'll post my first "blog column" tomorrow. The topic will be the Olympics. I have a lot of opinions on what's going on in Greece, and once I put them into a cohesive rant, I'll share it with you all.  In the meantime, stop reading Ann Landers, and Dear Abby, and Miss Mannners. Old dead chicks don't give out very good advice - and neither do their ultra-PC humorless daughters.  Your humble servant,  Buster Van Buren  urlLink buster@dearbuster.com   urlLink www.dearbuster.com
