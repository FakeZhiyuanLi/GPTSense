      Hey all! I am feeling refreshed today! I went to  urlLink church  today and I feel like a ton of wieght has just FALLEN off of me. It was time to shake them demons off . . . it was time to reflect on my life, the purpose of my life and I needed to search and find out what god has created me for!  Yes I said it . .  and I believe it wholeheartedly . . . we are all created for God's pleasure and when we praise and worship him from the belly of your soul, God is pleased! We were all  meant to do GOD's work and manifest our  time ,  talents  and our  treasury   . . .   The question is  . . . Do you know what God has created you for? Have you taken the time to manifest the talents that God has given you?

      I am having one of THOSE days . . . you know one of those   MAN   bashing days! ( LADIES  you know what I am talking about!)  I am a beautiful, strong and intelligent woman . . .  You would think that I would have plenty of GOOD MEN falling at my feet to try to get ot know me . . . NOT ! It is the opposite, all I tend to attract are heartless bastards that try to get me to have SEX with them! They dont wanna get to know me, they dont wanna have a RELATIONSHIP, ahem or try to COMMIT!   Is it just me or is it that all the good men are NON EXISTANT?!?!?

      Hey World! It's nice to finally have my own piece of cyberspace! (I know that sounds soo CORNY!)  Well, for those who don't know me, I am the  infamous  Butterfly NOIR  . . . the  DIVA  who tells it like it is and doesn't apologize for it. I plan to use this space to express my opinions (I will say it again,   MY OPINION  !) about some of the things that are going on in our world today.   First and foremost, I would like to give my thanks to my LORD and SAVIOR Jesus Christ. For he has lifted me up from when I was down, carried me when I couldn't stand anymore and his forgiveness allows me to take it one day at a time . . . .  Check out my friend  urlLink Renee's Website !  She is a TALENTED photographer . . .
