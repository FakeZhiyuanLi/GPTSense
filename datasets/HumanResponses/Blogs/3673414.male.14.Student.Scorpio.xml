      Just thinking about my homework remaining, and i was bloody scared. so much homework left and my RE draft due on tuesday. haven't even finished the experiments yet. shyt.  i must try and finish as much as possible of my hw today. hopefully kuang is not reading this. she says that we have not much homework even though she has given us piles. two essays, one project and one debate. wtf. this is bad.  i also have to do chem creative assignment. anywae, no lamenting now. let's talk about my overseas exchange trip to perth.   me and a guy called yue hao went to perth for the first two weeks of the june holidays. it was damn fun there. i wuld love to be in their school. it is way more slack and fun. our school's size is mincemeat compared to it. wth. ggs is a pro school, man. the guys i stayed with had a farm bigger than s'pore. wth. it was extremely fun there.  anywae, bye for now guys, thanks for reading and putting up with my self-pity.

      hello everyone,  today was a damn funny day. in the morning, i went to nus to do my science mentorship programme. got there at 8.20. had agreed to meet kin kit at 8.30. then kin kit turns up at 9.20 and i couldm't contact him cause his phone was off. Anywae, still finished the experiments early. They are turning out wonderfully well.  anywae, when i was coming back, i saw this stray cat (actually i saw this yesterday, but...) and it was given food by this stranger. it turned round and shat on the food. That was damn funny. i laughed all the way home. lolz.  Then, come home, homework time. philo essay. wth, i only get half an hour of recreation daily. Lolz, this sux. anywae, started my blog. no time to change anything so used a stupid format. anywae, hope can blog often.   Anywae, overall, i think today was a very fun day. tomoro must go to nus again, so shall end now. thx for reading. ttbb.  Supersonic
