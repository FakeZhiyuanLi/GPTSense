      why is it people think dat am bad? My mom usually called me "black sheep".. she alweiz scolded me, taught me values and reminisced those mistakes i've done in my past life. For Devil's sake! past is past! do she think am still young not knowing my mistakes? dammit! other peeps speak harsh words infront of mah face! to hell with damn! they don't know who really I am.. who is Ella? though i acted this way.. as if no one owns me.. paksheyt! tao rin po ako! got feelings and know how to be hurt.. deep in mah skin were nerves... and blood rushing like adrenaline... and when i hurt..suffer from tormented pain..crystal drops fall from my weak eyes.. got it?!!! stupid is me but who d hell i care? mock me till u die but one thing i can assure u... walay mu-attend sa imong lubong!
