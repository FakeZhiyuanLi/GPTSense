      sometimes.. life's a bitch.    it's long time since i ever saw that template i've used b4. but.. that phrase still is printed in my mind. forever it will be there. it is so true. sometimes.. life is full of wonderful things. yet at the same time.. things are not going your way. it seems like everything is against you.. opposing your will. the only way to get out of it is to ignore everything. sux... that sucks. trying to pretend you don't feel anything towards something that bothers you very much. how difficult can it be? very difficult. how very? very very...   i want to spend the rest of my life in peace. who doesn't.. you might ask. but who did have the chance to spend their lives peacefully? think about it.. using 2 hands seems too much to count. try walking down the road.. and all eyes on you. not admiring.. but with an "irritated" look. are u happy? walking down the street.. every1 is taking occassional peeks at u.. do u feel good? oftenly.. i say i got used to it le. however.. do i? in fact.. can i ever get use to it? i duno. it seems lame to some of you. but.. try it yourself. u wun like it. i can assure.    life's a bitch. definitely. a gigantic one in fact. but i will try all means to live it well.. live it to it's fullest. live happy. live wonderfully. things are not the same as b4 le. things change. not more to say about humans.    i once had a friend.. she was a very hardworking and obedient girl. she was one of the top student during my primary sch years. i have not seen her for about 3 years. (time flies arh?) now.. i got to know from another buddy.. that she quit school and her current job is full-time ah lian in jP (jurong point). my jaws dropped. dumbfounded. the once hardworking and obedient girl.. changed.. disastrously to someone whom i might not be familiar with now. or perhaps.. when she sees me.. the last thing she might want to do to me is to smile and say "Hi.".. people do changed. do i? do u? of coz. just hope it is a change for the better. =)   i am now listening to yuerong's diary's midi. that's a nice song.. ting's midi is also nice. all midi's seems nice.. haha.. long time since i heard a midi.. (does handphone ringtones considered one?) left with ss homework. hai. sBq. i suck at ss..   long entry arh. it was a long time since i typed such a long entry.. expressing thoughts that were not suppose to be in a day's diary. haha. anyway. hope u understand and enjoy wat was written.   teachers' day coming. sucks..   -E.x.t.r.3.m.E
