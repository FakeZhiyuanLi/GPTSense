       Ok, it's Monday. Knowing that we go to Mexico this week makes it very hard to come to work for these few days. I've got stuff to do like washing clothes and packing. My mind is not on proposals. This had better be a good trip, cause getting here has been a royal pain. From Hugo's problem with his work schedule to how much it's all going to cost and then finally having to rent a family van. It's very stressful and the beach had better be theraputic. I am a bit worried about family tiffs between the group with Hugo's aunt/uncle and our group. Hugo's aunt/uncle have been just uncoorperative lately and criticizing. I really need to enjoy myself, actually Hugo, Brandon and I really need to enjoy ourselves as a family. I want Brandon to have a good experience and not witness any family turmoil. Wish I had a digital camera to post "baby on the beach" pics. Maybe next time (who knows when that will be).       I did enjoy the Olympic weekend. We hung around the house over the weekend watching the Olympics. I got some house cleaning done - so we won't leave a pit behind to return to. I was hoping the carpet cleaning guys would call so they could clean the carpets while we are in Mexico. Oh, back to the Olympics. I watched a little diving, swimming, gymnastics, and boxing.       Oh, I almost got in trouble with the hubby because of a VCR fiasco. We are huge Nip/Tuck fans. It's on FX everyweek. I taped it last week and when we went to watch it, it cut out after like 10 min. I think Mr. Brandon was poking buttons when it was recording and hit eject that night while I was putting the towels away. Luckily, the show repeated last night and I was able to record it - no problems. So we didn't miss a thing, whew! I just need to make sure the VCR is set to record Nip/Tuck and Summerland next week while we are gone.     Ok, I think I'm done rambling on wasting precious proposal writing time. Just can't get myself to do it. Think I'll surf a little web next, check out those Olympic scores.

       I am very sleepy, could hardly stay awake while driving to work.  I think auto pilot was on because I don't remember the ride.  Sweet Brandon has a very bad habit going, waking in the middle of the night screaming until you go get him.  Problem...I took Nyquil last night and so I'm very out of it (couldn't believe Brandon was even able to wake me from my comatose).  I really do wish to be in bed right now.  Let's hope my face doesn't hit the keyboard today.      So last night the family made a Target run, we stocked up on our necessities and non-necessities for next weeks trip to Mexico.  Boy are we going to be broke.  Hugo went a little over board stocking up on clearance summer clothes, oh well he needs the clothes.  I got nothing. :(  Just doesn't seem fair.  The countdown is on.........6 days till we are in Mexico, hay caramba!      The olympics start tonight, I am looking forward to watching the opening ceremonies and keeping up with the US and Mexican teams.  I love watching the games, especially diving and gymnastics.  I'm sure we'll be watching boxing too.      Hope I get some good sleep tonight, I really need it!  Have a great weekend.

       Where oh where has summer gone, oh where oh where has it gone?   For it being the hottest month of Minneosta, we are falling really short.    Only in the 50's today, I can't wait to be in Mexico next week.      As I sit here at work, I'm pretty much sleeping. I must be careful not to let my face hit the keyboard as my head bobs from dozing. Brandon was not a happy sleeper last night. Up at 1am, 4am and 5:30am - screaming until I come for him. I think there is too much napping going on during the day - that will have to stop!      Let's hope for a better night tonight and a warmer day tomorrow.
