      He approached the beach and gave his legs a break from peddling, allowing a moment to enjoy the cool and gentle breeze which flowed through his sun drenched hair.  The smell of saltwater was in the air as the worn tires of his old bike rolled over the cracked concrete, producing a slightly noticeable whir.  Occasionally he glanced up at the swaying palm trees that stretched towards the sky, which still didn't seem real.  The streets were familiar, and the scene no different, but the experience was always new.  With a grand imagination it could easily be anyone's first time.    Later as he sat in the sand time stood still, and with the backdrop of ever present waves, memories were made.  The far away clouds hung over the mysterious blue water, grey and dreary, but the sun still shone overhead.  When he was there, it was all just a moment.  But time has no bounds, and everything etched itself into the past.  Though tomorrow was an eternity away, eventually things started to move, and with the right memories it is all recalled as he rides down a familiar street and glances up at the swaying palm trees stretching towards the sky, which still at times don't seem real.

      There are some people that just seem  too  happy.  They appear to be perpetually optimistic, and I usually see them strolling around wearing big goofy smiles, always seeming to be have some degree of concern and interest in how I'm doing.  I give them a smile and say "hello", which somehow becomes an invitation for them to engage me in a brief dialog.  They ask how things are going, and I, in as nice a way as possible, complete the exchange.  I smile, walk away, and wonder.  And so the day goes in a series of these seemingly meaningless yet somehow necessary sets of interactions.  Some people are genuinely happy, truly concerned, and to all ends just  good  people.  They find good in most everything.  But can a person really be happy all the time?  Perhaps everyone should be ruffled by something from time to time.  At least it forces some degree of consideration.  It might even  urlLink be beneficial for everyone in the long run .

      The idea of  urlLink simple living  has always been appealing to me.  Something about living a pure and simple life just seems so unburdened.  I bet that most of the time that people spend cleaning and organizing their homes could better be described as finding places to put useless crap.  I've experienced it in the past.  Organizing stuff that I can't remember the last time I used and putting it somewhere to ensure that I won't have to go through the same thing again.  Usually it is a perfectly good waste of space and time; time that could more enjoyably be spent doing anything, perhaps even nothing.  I'm not talking about the never bathing and walking around barefoot kind of simple, but just living within my means and not accumulating unnecessary and useless stuff.  Even in my own moderately frugal way of life, from time to time I decide that there's something I must have, and eventually I justify it and end up buying it.  And usually it just ends of being something I really could have done without.  Here in Southern California, many people have a hobby that they like to call shopping.  Those who approach life in this fashion (pun intended) usually are in no ways happier, are broke all the time, and for that still really don't have anything that cool.  So what does it accomplish?  Beats me.  Apparently it fulfills their immediate need for gratification which usually doesn't produce any sort of benefit in either the short or long term.  The other day I started reading a book about voluntary simplicity, and the most important thing I've learned so far about simple living in modern Western society is to not deny yourself a material existence, but instead to remove needless distractions, excess clutter, and complication.  Doing so allows a greater degree of focus on other important things, in turn leading to a more conscious and deliberate lifestyle.  As people yearn for more in the way of material goods, financial prosperity, and success, as they chase their version of the "American Dream", they find that it is unattainable, and they lose sight of what is important, becoming psychologically and spiritually hollow.  Their success ultimately becomes their demise.  I found a quote from Gandhi which says, "As long as you derive inner help and comfort from anything, you should keep it.  If you were to give it up in a mood of self sacrifice or out of a stern sense of duty, you would continue to want it back, and the unsatisfied want would make trouble for you.  Only give up a thing when you want some other condition so much that the thing no longer has any attraction for you."  Sounds like good words to live by.  On another note, today I drove by a parking lot with two telephone booths in it.  Both were in use and someone was actually waiting for one.  I didn't think anyone used phone booths anymore.

      I was thinking today about what the appeal of a blog is.  I've always toyed with the idea of starting one in the past, but it seemed like it would just be a lot of extra work.  So far though, I've already been more successful with this than any previous journal attempt.    I think that writing allows me to harness my thoughts, and gives a certain focus to them that otherwise likely wouldn't be there.  Most of the time, I typically keep my thoughts closely guarded, and I think part of the allure is that in writing they can be let out.  Some of them at least.  It is a place to give my thoughts an anonymous voice, and where no judgement can be passed, or at least none that will affect me.  The thought of someone somewhere reading what I write and relating to it is satifying.  Of course I'm only surmising all this based on my own feelings.  I'm sure everyone has different reasons.

      A good friend of mine has told me we're not put in the world to suffer.  I believe that.  This friend of mine certainly practices what he preaches.  He hasn't "worked" in over a year.  But he lives a normal life, nothing extravagant, but no denial of anything either.  He worked hard through college, did a bit of traveling, and spent the few years after college working his butt off.  And now he just doesn't work.  He must do something for money, I just haven't fully figured it out yet.  Life isn't bad.  But people in our American society seem to make it that way.  For how much things have advanced, both in comparison to our society 50 or 100 years ago, and to other societies, things don't seem to be getting better.  People are still getting sick and dying, people live lives of depression and uselessness.  And most of us have the nerve to look at other countries and say how those people live such sad lives.  They would be considered financially poor, but they are happy.  Doesn't really make sense does it?  I watch those  urlLink National Geographic  shows featuring different tribes, and those people are happy as can be.  Their lives have meaning.  The thing that eludes me is how to live a life of complete and total happiness.  Even though they say money doesn't buy happiness, to an extent it does.  You couldn't live in our America without any money.  I guess you could, but then you are denying yourself of some of the few and basic human needs.  I don't think being homeless is a viable option.  So the fact remains, you need at least some sort of minimal income to sustain any level of happiness.  And I don't see our society regressing back to farmers and traders who have no concern for monetary gain, and only make consumable goods and trade for what they need.  I've said before, I'm  urlLink not against working .  Working is good for the soul.  But for it to be good for the soul, you must enjoy what it is that you do.  I've also said that I like what I do, which really means that I like using utilizing my talents.  It makes me feel good, and it's satisfying to be productive.  But sitting in a cubicle having superiors checking the clock to make sure I'm putting in my time makes all those good feelings go away.  I need to find a new job where I feel like I'm doing something, and when there's a day where I just want to relax, they will let me, knowing that I'll make up for it later.  That's what it should be about.  People need to feel fulfilled, not used.

      I feel good when I'm doing things.  When I'm bored at work, it makes the day drag.  I like projects, and I like when I'm challenged and can sit and plug away, only to look at the clock and realize my day is already half over.  Summer is the slow time at my company.  Of course there's always "busy work," but without direction and without deadlines it allows me to slack to my heart's content, since nothing is really expected to immediately get done.  Most people complain about work, and I'm guilty too.  But I don't complain about working, I just complain about the work environment and attitude in general.  I've always said, I'm not against working, I just wish I had more flexibility.  People at work always complain about getting work assigned to them, sometimes I do too, but only for fun.  Really I would like to just tell them to shut up and do it.  Sometimes I'm tempted to ask for their assignments.    People are always drowning in work.  I don't get it.  Even during the busiest time of the year at work which I've always heard horror stories about, I never with a few exceptions felt overloaded.  I always get things done in a timely fashion.  I don't understand either when people talk about "job security."  I've talked about that in the past, how people get so used to their jobs that they fear losing them.  You've always heard of people who throw trash on the ground and say, "Oh it's job security for the city workers."  I was talking to someone at work telling them how I thought it would suck to be one of the people whose jobs it is to maintain old computer code in an obsolete computer language.  Not analysis in preparation for an upgrade, just fixing bugs and making sure things continue working.  He said it's good job security.  That's what I'm talking about.  Settling to do crappy brainless work.  I think if someone is that afraid of the prospect of moving forward because of the thought of working themselves out of their job, it's kind of sad.  I'm not trying to be judgemental, since I know some people are forced into jobs they dislike due to circumstances out of their control.  These aren't the people I'm talking about.  I know others suffer through jobs because they know ultimately it's in their best interest.  At least these people know there are other things to come.  Compromising is ok if you know what you're compromising and why you're doing it.  Sometimes I wish I would get laid off or fired because it would force me to move on.  Everyone is guilty of that sort of thing.  Needing to move on but putting it off because things are comfortable.  I don't really want to get fired, but having an excuse to do something new is good.  Being forced to do so makes you work things out.  And they usually always end up just fine.

      I'm not much of a writer.  It seems like everyone has one of these blogs though, and I enjoy reading them, and doing so usually inspires me.  So maybe I should give it a shot.  Maybe it will change something inside of me.  Recently I found a site called  urlLink www.chasingeden.com .  I don't know the guy who writes it, but his name is Elliott and he writes about a lot of different stuff, and it all interests me.  He started it as a travel journal I believe, some time during his traveling around 5 continents.  The point is that what he writes is very powerful if you are the right audience, which I guess I am, since it inspired me to  urlLink write this letter , and also to rejuvenate myself with this blog.  One of his major goals is "promoting self-development, the value of good people, and work as a statement of purpose."  All things which make perfect sense to me.  I believe that I am a person who needs this type of inspiration.  More on that later.  He also wants to "create alternatives for the tens of millions of underemployed, disaffected, and chronically frustrated who will not make an effort in life because they do not believe it is worth it."  Again, something that could help me, not that I am any of those things, but nonetheless.  Since this is my first post, a bit of background.  I am 25, live in San Diego with my girlfriend who is also my best friend and who I want to spend my life with, and I have a decent job.  Sounds good, huh?  Well it is.  I have gotten to do enough traveling and seen enough things (not much traveling and not many things, but more than most people I think) to realize that there is more than most people think there is in life.  This is the reason that I live 3000 miles away from where I grew up.  I saw an alternative.  And now I'm here, and 3 1/2 years later, I see more.  After graduating from college with a degree in Computer Science, I was in a good position to more forward, which I did.  At the same time, I started to lose some of the drive to experience new things.  I got comfortable with my life as it was, thinking I was just growing up.  And I was, and still am.  But now my girlfriend and I both see more.  We have decided that in time we will leave San Diego and move abroad.  Probably to Italy.  Time will tell.  About 6 months ago, I read something which made some of the drive I just mentioned start to resurface.  I became interested in travel again.  I started wanting more.  So I created a website called  urlLink Worlds Revealed .  It was an outlet for me to satisfy some of my desire to travel, which I think is more of a desire to learn about new people and new cultures.  We'll see how that works out.  So back to Elliott and Chasing Eden.  Reading this resurfaced this inspiration again.  I believe I am someone who could use a work alternative.  I "work" 40 hours a week, and although definately not overworked, I could use some more time, not to be lazy, but to be me.  I keep myself busy just fine.  The problem is that what I am good at in some ways does match who I am.  I am a software engineer, and although I actually  do  really enjoy computers and software and such, my current job really isn't fulfilling, and I could probably get the work I do over the course of the week done in half the time in exchange for time off.  I also think most people could.  But I like the security.  If I could do what I do, but in a situation where I was fulfilling my own need to be productive, it would be ideal.  I'm not against work, in fact I would probably be bored without it.  I just wish it were more on my own terms.  But I understand most companies have their own agendas and needs, and changing their role would compromise their own success. I think this is what Elliott means.  One of the problems I have is that I like my solitude and I like my security.  I like my alone time.  I am also a quiet person, and by nature not a risk taker.  So all the things I would love to do, like join a volunteer group or meet other people like me or find a better job, I don't do.  Not because I am lazy, but because I do things like what I'm doing right now.  I undertake new projects (like this blog or my website), I read, I learn.  And I also don't want to fall behind.  I've worked hard to get where I am, so a new job would not only have to offer more mentally, but be a better overall opportunity.  I'm very happy now, and although I could use more in the way of work, I don't want less.  Well I've written quite a bit, so I'll stop.  We'll see if these feelings continue.  I hope I don't let the inspiration leave me, which is why I'm starting this blog.  When I write things it kind of sets them in my head more than if they are just left as thoughts.

      Once again my job is annoying the hell out of me.  It's really a tough situation because, as  urlLink I've said before , I don't hate the work I do or the people I work with, I hate the bureaucratic crap that comes along with it.  Like a stupid ass VP of Technology who sneaks around looking over people's shoulders making sure they're not surfing the web and making sure they're in the office at the appropriate times.  You don't ever see him actually  doing  it, but then about once a month, word comes down that he's observed people not adhering to the rules.  What a bunch of crap.  My superior (otherwise known as my boss, but I hate when people call their superior/supervisor "boss", it makes them sounds like they're under their control) breaks the news and even agrees that it's stupid, and as he puts it we're all professionals and he judges us by our productivity and output, not by what he catches us with on our screen, which is the way it should be.  And this stupid ass VP, he won't even tell the offenders directly.  He sends word out through the grapevine, which really only makes people think he's more of an ass.  All it really does is make me more careful.  I still do whatever the hell I want to.  To be honest, whenever I'm goofing off, I really do feel guilty, because I  am  a professional with a good work ethic.  But when this once a month comes around, I always make sure to be a little less productive, just to spite the bureaucracy.  I could either spend 15 minutes online doing who knows what, then getting down to business.  Or I could be pissed off and sneak around a few times a day, then zone out and daydream, then think about the stupid senior staff who seem to forget about what it was like to be regular once they achieve their lofty positions.  So really all the big brother stuff is quite effective, as you can probably tell.  Especially since I'm writing this at 11:00 am on a Friday.  You do the math.  Another way I justify my goofing of is that I'm not a smoker who spends 15 every two hours outside.  I'm not a social butterfly who flutters around the office talking to people all day.  I don't yap on the phone all day long.  And also,  urlLink I don't get as much time off as I should , and at that I don't ever use up all my sick days.  So I figure I'm entitled to some brainless web surfing time.  Anyone know of a company that's hiring?  That is, a company that values their people and productivity over their appearances?

      In a way, I'm not surprised that we're in this situation that we're in over in the Middle East.  We come from a country of arrogance, where enough is not enough, and where the vast majority of people grow up taking things for granted and lacking the understanding that not all of the world works the same way we do.  Not that there aren't these problems in any other society, but we are a supposedly advanced and progressive society and should be held above the rest of the world's standards.  It's kind of like being a supporter of human rights and then abusing prisoners in federal custody.  Yea.  I believe it's a combination of politics, religion, greed, and just plain ignorance.  People who are overly political or overly religious are so caught up in their beliefs that they fail to grasp the concept that not everyone believes in their God or their Ideals.  As for greed and ignorance, I'm not sure whether it's already present and predisposes people to adopt their beliefs, or if their beliefs lead to greed and ignorance.  Hmm...  Sadly enough, I think the leader of our country is perhaps guilty of all.  In fact I recall reading something about how God helped him in his decision to invade Iraq.  How a conservative Christian can use this as justification for invading an area of the World well known to be majority Muslim, I'm not sure.  I understand the concept of liberation, and that the freedom of oppressed people falls on the shoulders of the strong, but it needs to be considered that some people don't want to be "liberated", at least not on our terms.  Here in America we supposedly have the freedom to worship whatever God we want, and we accept democracy because we've been born into it.  Because this is standard here, it doesn't mean that it's our duty to enforce this elsewhere, although history might tell another story.  I can see why people hate America.  We have a tendency to be contradictory, disrepspectful, and ignorant.  Don't get me wrong, I do not dislike America.  Every day that goes by, and the more I learn and try to understand the way the World works, the more I am grateful that I was born an American.  I agree with what We stand for, but I don't agree with many of the current goings on.  I won't go into more specific details, but there are plenty.    I recently overheard someone who is a former US Marine make reference to "towelies" and "red dots".  In the past I've heard the same person talk about "ni@@ers".  And I know this is the attitude of a least some military people.  Is this who we want representing America in a foreign land?  I've heard people who say we should just go over to Iraq and bomb them.  What?!?  It just boggles my mind that people are this stupid, and that's why it doesn't shock me that we're in the current situation, and why people across the world hate us.  If I was in their shoes, I probably would too.

      Some people are really talented, and it never ceases to amaze me.  Even though I still think a good majority of the people in the world are idiots, every now and then I meet or learn of people who are quite intelligent and have a lot to offer.  I'm not saying anything about my own intelligence, but I like to think that it at least means something that I take the time to think about things, have independent thoughts, and have at least some degree of concern about the world that surrounds me.  Most of the time, no matter what I'm doing, whether it be driving, working, or people watching, it never ceases to amaze me how so many idiots make it as far as they do.  I see some pretty stupid stuff (like most of what's on network television.)   The other day I borrowed the relatively new  urlLink Bad Religion  CD from a co-worker.  He made mention that it contains a rather large amount of anti-Bush lyrics.  In the past I've noticed that their lyrics are pretty intelligent, so I figured I'd delve a bit into the history of the band.  I've never been a huge Bad Religion fan, and although I like their music, I admittedly don't know much about the band members or their history.   I did a  urlLink google search  about their singer, Greg Graffin, and it turns out that he's quite an interesting guy.  He has a Masters Degree is Paleoanthropology (or something), a PhD in Evolutionary Biology, and has taught classes at Cornell.  His PhD project about Evolution and Religion can be found  urlLink here .   I was amazed to learn of this.  I know that musicians (real musicians) and lyricists (not those who write "Oops, I did it again"), are usually pretty intelligent.  But this amazed me.  To start a band at age 15 " urlLink in response to the mediocrity and brainlessness of late-Cold War suburbia " and then go on to a 20+ year career in the industry, along with obtaining multiple advanced degrees, is quite astounding.  It certainly changes my opinion of what I had thought was just a group of guys enjoying a long career in the world of punk music.

      Lately I've been on a quest for something, although I can't really put my finger on what.&nbsp; Every once in a while something happens, I see something or hear about something, and I get a feeling, though it's a bit strange.&nbsp; I think I'm seeking more fulfillment in my life, not in an unhappy with my life sort of way, but on a more personal level.&nbsp; I get these feelings that say I should be doing something different with my time, something that would bring me greater satisfaction.  I do a lot of reading, spend a lot of time outside, stuff like that, and that all makes me feel good.&nbsp; Escaping into a good book or learning about something new is a nice release, as is getting out of the hustle and bustle and finding myself alone on a trail in the mountains.&nbsp; I've even been searching for a different job, but the problem is that I want to keep doing what I'm doing (software), but maybe work with a non-profit or a company that has a  purpose .&nbsp; My problem is that I'm caught a bit in the middle; my training is in high tech and computers, which really isn't a "make a difference in the world" sort of field.&nbsp; But I've worked hard and I'm afraid to give up the progress that I've made, to take a lesser paying and lesser demanding job in return for greater personal fulfillment.   I don't dislike my job, I just feel like most people that work in environments like this become deadened in a way.&nbsp; Things become so routine that any creative forces in their lives slowly fade away.&nbsp; The little things that bring people pleasure, real and meaningful pleasure, disappear.&nbsp; It happens to everybody.   These feelings that I'm talking about are feelings that I get when I hear about genuine good in the world, or about people who genuinely need to be helped or who make a difference.&nbsp; I want to know that I've helped someone who truly  appreciates  it, something that I can't say I've really done before.   There is this guy, I'm assuming he's homeless, and I pass him on the way to work every morning.&nbsp; There are plenty of homeless people here, and I've never felt bad for any of them until this one guy.&nbsp; In general, I don't like the way that a lot transients beg and expect to be helped, and then seem irritated when you ignore them.&nbsp; But this guy, who I've seen in the same place every morning for at least a year, has an entirely different demeaner.&nbsp; He stands holding a sign, but his body language says that he doesn't expect anything.&nbsp; He has this neutral stare, he doesn't make eye contact, but he doesn't look away.&nbsp; He's older, and his hair is long enough to be in a ponytail under the hat he wears, and he's kind of a beard goatee.&nbsp; But the thing that caught my attention about him is that he is always standing.&nbsp; I've never seen him sit.&nbsp; And over time I've noticed his hair seem to get a bit more grey, and now he uses a cane for support, and he's more hunched over than he used to be.&nbsp; Every few weeks or so his clothes change.&nbsp; But other than that, he's always there, and always the same.&nbsp; I don't know what this means, but I've actually thought about asking him if he needs anything, old clothes, or food or something.&nbsp; I truly wonder what has brought him the this point.   When I see someone like him, that's when I feel like what I do isn't important enough.&nbsp; And that's why I'm searching, hoping I can find something that will bring me more fulfillment.

      When I moved to San Diego in 2001, I remember being shocked at how expensive it was to own a home in the area.  The average single family home was selling for somewhere in the range of $270,000 and about 25% of people could actually afford to buy one.  Since then I have been hearing new figures as they come out, and I was flabbergasted when the cost reached over $300,000.  At this level, owning a home here was definately out of my reach.    Last month I heard the latest figures.  The average cost for a  single family home  in San Diego county is now $560,000.  And 11% of people can afford this.  This percentage was a 4% drop since the previous month.  So what is going on in San Diego?  Is it possible that 89% of people are renting or living well beyond their means?  With an average price this outrageous, I wouldn't even be able to afford a house in a low income area.  And I really don't think it's possible that 9 out of 10 people live in apartments and condos.  But I suppose these figures only support all the new studies about rising debt levels, and people thinking they're getting bigger and better homes while the interest rates are low, not realizing that when rates go up years down the road they suddenly won't be able to afford their payments anymore.  But either way, these figures are absurd.  Last I knew, people who owned homes worth half a million dollars weren't average.  And the crazy thing is that homes are being bought within  days  of going on the market, for more than they are listed at, all because the demand is so high.  I just don't get it.  I suppose the only reason it can happen is because of supply and demand, so obviously the demand is greater than the supply.  I understand that people want to live in San Diego - it has great weather - but seriously, for half a million dollars?  And to still be average at that?  Pretty soon the disparity here between rich and poor, or in this case, rich and normal, is going to be absurd.  With all the talk of the economy and job shortages, how are people pushing the real estate market of Southern California to these levels?  I've spoken with people at work who are near retirement age, and they could either stay in San Diego and work until 65, retire, and still have their house payments.  Or they could retire today, several years early, sell their home, move to a more affordable place out of Southern California and buy a house outright.  I must be missing something.

      I've met people who assume that because I tend to be a quiet person that I am either disinterested or unfriendly, or both.  I suppose that in certain cases, either can be true, but usually they are not.  As for being disinterested, it's quite the contrary.  I'm usually very interested, but I sometimes tend to observe a situation rather than interact in it.  Doing so allows me to "get a feeling for people."  Yes, preconceived notions can be wrong and inappropriate, but honestly, in my experience these notions are usually not far off the mark.  And as for being unfriendly, isn't just possible to having nothing to say?  People have a problem with nothing.  Nothing to say, nothing to do.  It's like everyone has a case of  urlLink ADD .  Personally, I could sit and not say a word for days.  I like to watch people, I like to observe situations.  Years ago I was preparing for a cross country trip, and several people commented that I would be bored to death going alone.  Five entire days lacking direct human contact, other than hotel desk clerks.  Well, I had one of the greatest times of my life.  Stayed at hotels alone, ate breakfast lunch and dinner alone, explored new cities alone.  Sometimes nothing is ok.  Nothing to do relieves stress, unless of course there are important things to be done, in which case you should just do them. Having nothing to say simply makes you an observer, an act that more people should learn.  I have always had strong feelings about this.  I believe that people who talk for the sake of talking are self centered and in some way, consciously or not, seeking approval, and are even quite possibly insecure.  The people in my life whose company I've come to enjoy most are those I can spend time with without feeling as though I need to talk.  It is true also that with silence comes a level of comfort and understanding, a realization that things can be enjoyed as they are.  It should be noted that there is of course a difference between engaging in a meaningful conversation and talking for the sole purpose of talking.    Being quiet is an underrated quality.  In a group setting, it's usually obvious who enjoys taking things in and observing the situation, and who needs to just talk, regardless of whether or not it's meaningless blather streaming out their mouth.  It often seems that the people who have the most interesting things to talk about or the most intelligent things to say are the ones that you can never get to share them.  In this regard it's as the ancient Lao Tse supposedly said, "Those who know, do not speak.  Those who speak, do not know."  After all this, I have to admit that I am often guilty of these things myself.  There are times when I find myself rambling about something with no particular direction, and there are times when I tend to spew facts I've just learned, usually to someone who could care less about them.  In these situations I have to remind myself to stop.  In fact, it seems like I'm beginning to ramble with no particular direction right now...

      San Diego is an interesting place.  At my apartment which is near the beach, the temperature will rarely ever drop below 40 degrees, and rarely rises above 80.  For the most part it is sunny every day, and it rains maybe 10 times a year, probably less.  There are palm trees lining the streets, and yards with green grass aplenty.  In the winter, I could easily get in my car and leave the comfortable 70 degrees and perfect coastal surf conditions, and within an hour be in a foot of snow in the mountains; from where I could then leave and within another hour be sitting poolside in the middle of the desert enjoying a hot 90 degree day.  For these reasons and more, San Diego is known as "America's Finest City."  The striking thing about it is that aside from the weather, most everything that people have come to associate with San Diego is artificial.  The water that comes out of my tap is imported from the north.  The grass that grows in people's yards is only there because it has been planted and is watered regularly; without this watering it would resemble the natural Southern California landscape, brown and dry.  The palm trees that line the streets are not native.  I think that the flowers which are perpetually blooming are just as confused as the New Englander in me; they don't know what season it is.  San Diego is naturally a desert.  The only place where you will see San Diego in its original state is at the waters edge (even this is probably stretching it, as the ocean is probably too polluted to be considered natural, and coastal development has probably altered the state of the naturally occurring beaches) and in the canyons, where cactus and other aptly suited vegetation cling to life, and the steep canyon walls make it impossible for any sort of sprawling development.  It also seems as though all the people around here good looking, which in most places is obviously not the norm.  Along with this, it's a rare occurrence that you meet someone that was actually born and raised here.  With the fair exception of the indigenous people of the Southern California region, people have moved in from elsewhere over the last hundred years or so.  The weather may be great for those seeking year round outdoor activity, but really it is a harsh climate, where humans would have a difficult time surviving if it weren't for the modern innovations which allow cities as we know them thrive.  I realize that most cities worldwide are in some way or another in the same situation, but something just seems strange when a place in which it is normal to go 6 months without a drop of rain can really sustain the millions of people which it does.  And the amazing thing is that this city is still growing rapidly, and urban sprawl is becoming a major issue.  In all aspects, it really is an artificial paradise here, for now.  This afternoon I was out hiking, and from 1500 feet up I was able to look down upon the city, and there across the expansive view was a distinct thin grey line of smog stretching across the horizon.  Four years or so I remember seeing that in Los Angeles, and I remember being somewhat disturbed by how the smog could hang there like that on an otherwise picture perfect blue sky day.  And now each time I observe that here, it makes me wonder if the artificial paradise that has been created here is slowly deteriorating.

      The universe is thought to be made up of billions of galaxies.  We speculate that a single one of those galaxies contains billions of stars.  In just one of those galaxies there is known to be a solar system, which itself is made up of planets and stars.  One of these planets, as we know, is called Earth.  This is hard to comprehend, and the concept of time is incomprehensible on this scale.  Just measuring distance between points requires an understanding of millions of light years.  So it is all just there, a great energy in space.  Somehow within all of this, our Earth maintains a balance of life.  This in itself is quite difficult to grasp, knowing that it is all just spinning in a massive and empty space.  When you consider these statements, life itself seems quite miraculous.  Then entire human existance is really not even a speck in the total of the universe.  And a single lifetime is insignificant compared to that speck.  But to people, time is relative.  We've been put here and given something that most creatures don't have; the ability to understand, speculate, contemplate, and have conscious thought.  It's all quite hard to fathom.  It seems that for the most part, the majority of society doesn't take advantage of this.  Lives are judged by unnatural standards; financial success, consumption, and material possessions.  We push the limits of the natural world, and in the process it seems as though we are destined to destroy it.  We are the only species that seems motivated by these desires.  Other species simply exist, as they are innately programmed to do.  They have a naturalness to their lives, and their existance is exactly that.  As humans, we have some extraordinary abilities, but it sometimes seems that they will drive us to a breaking point.  Of course, there have been many discoveries, achievements, and successes in the history of mankind, and as part of our existence, curiousity of the new and unknown seems natural.  But at the core of life, we are really just another species on this planet, and we should try to accept this.  It's good to step back every now and then.  To ponder the universe is exciting, as there is plenty to be amazed about.  It gives a feeling of connectedness to our surroundings and the world we live in.  Success is often judged by how much, how big, how far things have come or gone.  It seems that we should learn to enjoy this life we have rather than invent ways to destroy it.

      As he sat in the white patio chair, he looked towards the ground and noticed a trail of ants which seemed to be busy and moving quickly, but never really getting far.  A half full beer bottle was on the table in front of him, the condensation was already dripping slowly down the sides, and the label was beginning to peel.  Above the building directly across the street, he could see the last bit of sun slowly disappearing for the night.  The few wispy clouds in the sky glowed pink and red, and he thought about going inside as the evening coolness began to set in.  He lifted the moist bottle to his lips, taking notice of the water ring it left on the table.  The beer was starting to warm, but it was still good enough to be refreshing.  Setting the bottle back down, he glanced at the trail of ants again, still seemingly busy and still not getting far.  Several of them were carrying little bits of dirt, heading somewhere with a look of senseless urgency.  They seemed to be determined, climbing over the little rocks and each other, going where ever it was that they needed to go.  He stood up and carefully stepped back, making sure not to step on them.  Thirsty for another drink, he walked towards the door, and after stepping inside, he closed the door behind him, leaving the ants to their work.

      I have a little bit of a problem with the obesity epidemic in the US.  I don't mean to be mean or cold hearted or insensitive to those with weight problems, but I strongly believe that those who are overweight (and  want  to lose weight) simply aren't trying hard enough (or maybe just do not know alternatives).  Not that I don't understand the fact that there are reasons behind their weight issues.  I understand that people look to food for comfort, that they eat when stressed out, or that maybe they were just never taught anything about healthy eating habits.   I also find it hard to believe the people who try to stress the fact that being overweight is ok, that you just have to love yourself and your body.  Being overweight is simply  unnatural  and  unhealthy .  Look at other counties, or even the animal world.  You never see grossly overweight Iraqis, Indians, or animals.  I feel strongly that American diets are to blame for a large percentage of modern health problems, obesity included.  In fact my problem is more with accepted American eating habits rather than obese people.  Diabetes, cancer, and heart disease have all become much more prominent over the past fifty or one hundred years.  With it being easier to get fast food and a 60 ounce soda, what do we expect?  And now other country's health issues are changing with the introduction of Western diets.  Also increasing are their obesity levels.   There's nothing wrong with not being a perfect physical specimen, but for me it just comes as a matter of pride.  I feel better about myself when I am active and in shape.  And look at the overweight people who are sick with themselves for looking like they do.  I don't think it's just about society's expected image.  It may be a factor, but deep down inside I think every person cares at least a little bit about how they look, not to fit a societal standard, but to please themselves.   When I'm at the gym and I see someone who is overweight exercising, it makes me feel good.  I'm happy when people care about themselves.  And I really bet that it is making them feel a hell of a lot better too.  But the thing that really gets me is when I see a very heavy person who waits 2 minutes for an elevator to go to the second floor when they could have walked in 30 seconds.  I rarely take elevators when there are stairs available.  And if anyone deserves that elevator, it's me.  And what about people who've gotten so heavy that they are considered handicapped?  They get that handicapped permit and get to park right next to where they need to be.  Maybe they should get a restricted permit so they have to park farthest away.  They could probably really use the exercise.   Just because we have a higher standard of living and more money than most countries, why should we be getting less healthy?

      Today I have some potentially good news.  I might have an interview for a new job next week.  A recruiter called me, and although he couldn't give me the name of the company, I was able to get enough information from him to figure out who it is.  And I went online and read up on the company, and it seems at least as good or better as the situation I'm currently in.  I'll see how that goes.  Last night I was reading the  urlLink Work To Live  site, and I followed the link to the  urlLink Meetup.com  site.  I ended up signing up on meetup.com, and it turns out there are only 4 others signed up in San Diego.  I've never used the site, but the premise sounds cool.  Essentially you meet groups of people who have the same interests as you at coffee shops or other places like that.  Who knows if I'll actually do it though.  I'm new to the Work To Live thing, but the concept sounds about right.  It's all about pushing for a balance between work and life, which is grossly out of whack for most Americans.  I've always been aware of the fact that the US is one of the most production obsessed countries, but until I read the site I had never known about that fact that  urlLink the United States is about the worst when it comes to vacation and work laws .  (In comparison to most of Europe, Australia, and even China and Japan).  Although more vacation really sounds nice, the thing that I'm for is more enjoyable work environments.  I don't think the fact that people have to work is what ruins them - in fact  urlLink the  right  kind of work makes people feel good  - but moreso the fact that they work in little tiny cubicles, stressed out, bosses breathing down their necks, and always seem to have more work than they can handle.  I'm wondering if it's worth my time to pursue.  Maybe if I get a fun new job I won't care so much about the balance crap, because maybe I'll enjoy work.

      I wonder what it is that makes people so different when it comes to settling for things in life.  Most of the people I work with seem to have just settled for what they've got.  When it comes to changing something, they simply say, "I can't."  But with me, every day that goes by I feel like there's got to be more out there.  Something.   But sometimes I wonder, am I so different?  I work at the same place they do.  I do the same complaining they do.  I do the same wishing for more free time.  All the people at work seem to cling to their jobs as if the world would end without them.  They take heaps of shit from their superiors, and are put into situations that would make me get up and walk away.  I'm lucky that my duties pretty much just call for me to sit and work at the computer, because if I had to deal with account managers, customers, or anyone else on any sort of regular basis, I wouldn't have lasted as long as I have.  And these people complain  all  the time, and I say to them flat out either "Why don't you get another job then?" or "I couldn't put up with what you put up with.  You pretty much get screwed."  I don't hide my feelings.  I'm just lucky I've never been put in a situation like that where I would be forced to make  the  decision.   But I suppose the same questions could be put on me.  Does the fact that I am looking for a new job make it better?  Does the fact that I'm learning Italian so I can move to Italy in two years mean anything?  Does it count that I am working towards my goals and want to  live  and wring more from my life make it ok now?  I like to believe that it does.
