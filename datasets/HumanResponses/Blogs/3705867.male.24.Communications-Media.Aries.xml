      I never liked soccer and now during the European Championships I'm also avoiding these matches as much as possible (including the one with the national team). I think this  urlLink video  describes pretty well how I feel about our national sport.  I really do hate this so-called nationalism that shows its ugly head with these kind of sports events.

       It's now quite commonly known that the Driv3r game isn't up to expectations. With me being a bit spoiled lately, the well done graphics just don't make up for the uninspired and trial-and-error gameplay. But fortunately none of this is true for the great soundtrack! So perhaps it's time developer Reflections gave up making games and start releasing album compilations. :P  It's got a lot of these never-heard-before-of artists (like Phantom Planet, Okuniev and Narco), but lots of them are great. A lot of spicy numbers with fresh beats and mellow sounds. So if you get a chance (and I guess that chance is not THAT big with this not being a major album), pick this up at your local music store.  1. Mellowdrone "C'mon and Try"   urlLink 2. Phantom Planet "Big Brat"  3. Iggy And The Stooges "Gimme Danger"  4. The Raveonettes "Bowels Of The Beast"  5. SLO-MO "Boy from the City"  6. Syntax "Destiny"  7.  urlLink Okuniev "Ripe For The Devil"  8. Teddybears STHLM "Move Over"  9. Narco "The 2nd Evolution/Stand Off"  10. Narco "Evil Brother"  11. Los Halos "Black Thread"  12. Stateless "Exit"  13. The BellRays "Zero PM"  14. Hope Of The States "Static In The Cities"

      With no real plans for a holiday this summer, I've been looking to go to Disneyland Europe for a couple of days with friends. I've been there once before and liked it quite a lot... Pirates of the Caribean is my definite favorite, although the animatronics are so incredible crappy. Oh..it's at least better then the movie :P *argh Matey! Shiver me timbers!*  btw. It seems like there is still hope for beer drinkers all around the world, as proven in this  urlLink commercial .

      Although the summer's supposed to have started today, I've been having a hard day keeping my eyes open today because of bad and rainy weather. Perhaps going to bed last Saturday around 4.30 am had also a bit to do with it. Also played the new Driver 3 game all the way through in 5(!) hours. That's about 10 euro's per hour of 'fun'. :P  Anyway...just cleaned up my laptop (a Powerbook 12") and learned that OSX is still a delight to manage in contradiction to Windows XP. No problems with defragmented harddisks or programs that seem impossible to delete. I'm not saying that Steve Jobs has released a crash-less OS upon this world...but it's giving me less fustration each day :P  Enough nerdish chatter...
