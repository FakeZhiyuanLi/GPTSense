         (cross-posted to  urlLink MaleSurvivor.org )     I had lunch with my cousin today (a Children's Services worker) and told her that I knew there was a reason for us to be getting together this week (it's been over a year since I saw her). As a kid I would spend part of the summers with her family at their cottage.   I told her about the therapy I've been getting lately for accident-related PTSD and that it had brought up a lot of other stuff.  She intuitively asked some very pertinent questions.  She asked, "So are we talking about physical or sexual or psycholgical abuse?"  I think I surprised her when I answered, "All of the above" and I was able to tell her, in a general way, about my childhood - which, besides the on-going sexual abuse by a stranger, included physical & psychologicial abuse by a teacher ("bullying" wasn't just from kids!) who also was a close family friend.   It was so liberating!  When I came home I sent her a short thank you email and this is part of what she said in response, which brought me to tears:  "Dearest K., you are still the sweet boy who quietly sat outside my bedroom door for hours (probably) waiting for my folks and I to waken up.  You have once again made me feel very special, this time by saying I was a good person to talk to."

         I have a 'love-hate' relationship with that old hymn  Amazing Grace .  It seemed like it was the music, by default, at so many funerals I attended at the peak of the AIDS deaths here.  Yet, several years later, it was played on the bag-pipes at my dear old grandmother's burial and it seemed just right.  The Glengarry Scottish Presbyterian had been born in 1904 - the year of the first Model 'T' Ford - and had lived to see the year 2000.  Standing at her grave-site, in the shadow of a school-house where she had taught decades earlier, the piper's drone seemed completely appropriate.  But what is 'grace' if not a spiritualised version of 'luck', albeit God-given?  And how does either word apply to me?  Recently, as I watched the celebrations of the sixtieth anniversary of D-Day, I heard an old veteran talking to a reporter about the friends who were buried there in Normandy.  "He was a bright boy", the man said of one, "a little quiet, but articulate", describing the ship-mate who had not survived the invasion.  "One minute we were together, clamouring on to the beach, and the next he was gone.  How I survived I'll never know.  It was just a matter of luck."  "Well at least he didn't call it 'grace'", I thought, as I reflected on the many friends I have lost to AIDS-related illness - several of whom were infected  after  me.  I have never quite embraced the war analogy to describe HIV, although many who 'fought' still died.  I was in active combat, seriously ill even, yet I survived.  It's in the similarities of our surviving where I most closely identify with war veterans.  I think I know a little bit about 'shell shock' or, at least, its modern-day name 'post-traumatic stress'.  How else could those days of mourning, grieving, helping, mourning, grieving, helping have been managed?  And, years ago, suppressing the sexual abuse?  Actually, more to the point, denying it was abuse and going back for more - again and again.    There have been times when I have felt quite insane and acted my way through it and others when I acted insane but felt fine.  I remember that 'out of body' phase', too, when I was so ill with AIDS-defining  cryptosporidiosis .  The doctor charted (I know because I looked) 'dissociation' and 'aseptic meningitis?' when I described how - through an unforgettable migraine -  I was "watching myself from somewhere in the corner of the room like Mary Poppins' Uncle Albert".  A lumbar puncture was inconclusive.  Owen was there.  He's dead now.  We were visiting Jim in the hospital.  He's dead now, too.  Joe as well.  And Michael.  And others.  I was treated with kit gloves in my condition.    Yet here I am.  Grace?  No.  Luck?  That seems to be a stretch but if the word works for that D-Day survivor I guess it can work for me.

         I was lying naked on a large rock, one of hundreds which lined both shores.  I loved the sense of adventure in daring to be outside with no clothes on.  I was out of sight of the gravel road which made its way along the shoreline to where the canal seamlessly became the lake.  I could always cover up when a ship happened along.  I stood up to re-align myself towards the changing afternoon sun.  As I did so I noticed him, also standing up, also completely naked, on a ridge that overlooked the rocky fields, the roadway, the water and me.  He cupped his hand over his sun-glasses to see me better.  His slicked back, black hair glistened.  Then he touched himself.  My heart raced with feelings that were at once strange and yet oddly familiar.  (I had already discovered I liked boys, and had played around with my best friend but, like me, he was just another pubescent boy.)  I sat back down on my boulder, out of the man’s sight again, and pulled on my shorts and running shoes.  Then I lifted my bike out of the bushes and began making my way along the bumpy road towards him, my legs still stretching to reach the pedals of this new, adult-sized ‘ten-speed’ I had paid for with earnings from my newspaper route.  I noticed that the man had driven his car – a big, brown, fairly new Pontiac Parisienne, probably a '71 or '72 model – off the main road and parked it on a path which snaked its way up the small ridge to where he still stood, still touching himself.  My heart seemingly in my throat, which was parched from the afternoon’s sun-bathing, I walked up the man’s path, noticing a Crucifix – perhaps a Rosary, too – dangling from the car’s rear-view mirror.  “Salut”, he said softly, smiling as he rubbed his hand over a large belly and again touched himself.  I could smell the strong scent of tanning oil.  “Salut”, I replied, hoping that my limited French would help me talk to him.  “Veux-tu…?” he asked, without saying any more, pointing to a large blanket he had stretched over the grass behind his car.  I hesitated, almost panicked really.  He looked as old as my Dad, even older, and he was quite fat.  He sat down on the blanket and again spoke softly.  “Viens ‘ci”, he said, patting a spot beside him on the blanket.  He pushed aside a brown bottle labelled “Hawaiian Tropic Suntan Oil”.  I set my bike on its side in the mixture of wild wheat, thistles and tall grass.  I awkwardly pulled my shorts down and over my shoes, then peeled my shirt over my head.  I stood silently, looking around to see how hidden we were.  From this vantage point I could not see the road, and yet I could see the water.  He had a good hiding place.  The man didn’t say much but he hummed in an “Ooh=la-la” fashion.  My heart was thumping as my instincts raced between boyish curiosity and terror.  Again he touched himself and then took my hand and placed it on his privates.  Mine was as like his at this point and he gripped it with a firmness that felt good.  He pulled us together and I felt his oily skin on my chest, arms and legs.  Before long I felt a very strange twitch.  I turned away from his touch, thinking I suddenly needed to pee, but it wasn't piss that came out.  This surprise weakened my legs momentarily.  As I recovered my breath the man began talking quickly, almost shouting really, and I didn’t understand what he was saying.  His anger, though, was unmistakable.  As I quickly pulled my shorts back on he seemed to be asking why I had turned away from him.  Obviously he had wanted to see what I had been doing.  I didn’t know how to react to his anger.  I was disappointed, though, and filled with a sense of shame.  Then he said something to the effect of not telling anyone that we had met here.  The way I felt at that point there was no reason, in my mind, for him to be concerned.  I scraped my shin on a pedal of my bike, hopping on as fast as I could.  Tears welled up as I bumped along the road, wishing that I didn’t have a half hour ride across town, along some busy streets, and home.  As frightened as I was, though, it seemed like I had better just come up with a fictitious cycling route to describe to Mom and Dad.  Somehow I would have to account for my afternoon – and a long, sweaty ride home would certainly call for an immediate shower.     We don't have to survive this hell by ourselves.

          I am eliminating the subject's surname, calling him only "Mr. G". I don't know why, really. He's dead now; maybe I have some compassion for his family who, surely, saw his ugly side once in awhile. KC   Mr. G. was a lot of things - my most memorable math teacher, principal of my elementary school, father of a friend my own age, member of my church, friend of my parents. He was also my first abuser - verbally, psychologically and physically. What follows is just one example.  One day in math class, grade four I believe, Mr. G. discovered - in his own unique way - that I was near-sighted. He had written a number of math "problems" on the chalkboard and was now striding up and down the rows of small desks, as was his custom, while we worked.  Walking towards me Mr. G. noticed that I was squinting to see the chalkboard.  "K.", he said, in his loud, baritone voice, "can you not see the blackboard?"  "Most of it", I think I replied, hoping to diffuse the panic that had set in to my stomach.  Mr. G. lunged at my desk and, as he often did, grabbed me by a bone in my shoulder and pulled me to my feet.  "Read it!" he shouted, nodding towards the front.  I squinted, which only hastened the arrival of tears to my eyes that his taunts invariably brought out of me.  "I can't," I said softly, still thinking it was only worse because of the salty fog I was now trying to see through.  His hand digging into the crook of my shoulder, Mr. G. moved me up the aisle.  "Read it now!" he yelled, as my classmates began to laugh.  "I can't", I sobbed, having lost all control of the tears.  The room erupted in laughter.  Mr. G., now playing to his audience as much as anything else, lifted me up by my shirt collar and carried me to the front of the class.  "Read it now!" he bellowed, evoking another chorus of laughter from my peers.   By this time I was wiping my eyes and nose on my shirt sleeves and was so shaken that I couldn't have concentrated on the chalkboard, even if I had been able to see it. The clearer my lack of vision became the angrier Mr. G. seemed to get. If not anger, it was certainly adrenalin.  He pulled me right up to the board now, this time jerking me forward by the arm.  "Can you read any of it now?" he yelled sarcastically, tapping my forehead repeatedly against the board. Of course now I was too close to read anything other than what was directly in front of me. My only response was to continue crying as the class snickered and laughed.  "I think you need glasses", Mr. G. said, a little quieter now as he quickly wrote a note.  "Take this home with you" he said, pushing the slip of paper into my hand.  Not surprisingly, Mr. G. was to be among the first people who would soon call me "Four Eyes".

       1)Physical and emotional abuse by an elementary school teacher 2)Repeated childhood sexual abuse by a stranger 3)Alcohol and other drug abuse  4)HIV diagnosis in 1989; full AIDS shortly thereafter 5)Being struck by a car, breaking my hip and wrist, in 2003   The sum of all this, so far, is post-traumatic stress/depression but - always, if not immediately - a determination to survive.  This is the first post of what I will try to maintain as an anonymous journal.  A few people will add 1 through 5 and figure out who I am.  That's fine.  If you have journeyed with me through any parts of this the unknown portions will probably not surprise you all that much.  I just need a safe place to journal and rant and, perhaps, exchange supportive words with others.  Peace,  K.C.

        (cross-posted to  urlLink MaleSurvivor.org )    Here in Canada, where the marriage debate continues even though the courts have yet to turn back gains made, I find I am more interested in gay marriage at a rate directly proportional to others' opposition to it. In other words, the more the 'phobes spout off the more I believe in marriage (not that I ever did not but it has been a moot point given that I've never been in a long-term relationship).  As for why I have not been available, open to, or lucky enough for a relationship, I think it all goes back to the abuse. Even if the abuser was not gay, and I don't know that for sure, he was definitely a conformer - not wanting to be caught dead where we were.  I, on the other hand, was exploring my awakening sexuality and was vulnerable to his illegal, immoral and repulsive advances.  From that experience sex became nothing but a dirty, obsessive drive that had to be satisfied. Relationships? Those, it seemed to me, were too much work when a variety of sexual experience was so freely available. "Free"? Not really. In many ways I sold out my integrity time and again, getting HIV in the process.  And so much of my life can be traced back to that fucking abuser. I'm angry and, yes, have always been struggling with my own internalized homophobia. But anger can turn into self-pity on a dime and I don't want that.
