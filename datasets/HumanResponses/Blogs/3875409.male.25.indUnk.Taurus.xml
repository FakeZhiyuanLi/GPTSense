      i bought this damn gameboy advance sp, because i really wanted it to play the classic nintentdo games that i already have for the nintendo that's hooked up to my media center... and the chick who sold it to me (who also need me to do her...) forced me into buying the legend of zelda: a link to the past. more like a link to the crack, damn i should leave a mushroom print on her because i can't put this damn thing down. i've known drug addicts that were less dependent. but now i've come to a problem. i can't fucking beat this one damn level. well, not level, but task, whatever. i need to find out where the really big key is so i can get that item for the elderly man in the village.... WTF... i don't even think that's descriptive enough. anybody out there know what i'm talking about??? i like this game but if i keep dying trying to find this damn key, i'm going to burn the cartridge in a cartridge burning ceremony.  last night we went to see Anchorman... hot DAMN that's a good movie. i mean, the creative genius. how can they come up with this stuff???? "i love scotch, scotchy scotch scotch, scotch go into my belly..." watch out for the  old school  reunion somewhere past the middle of the movie.....

      Well, the MINI went in for it's second oil change after 30,000 miles... ha, and you thought your car was cool. mine gets free oil changes and it only needs to be changed every 15,000 miles. it totally rules. plus the 35+ mpg aaaand the 14.8second quarter mile.... not fast, but truly respectable out of a 4 cylinder. and bmw polishes the hell out of it before you get it back. the downside is that it's pouring out. but damn the rims are cleaner than they've ever been.  you know, we all have bosses. no matter who you are, you have a boss. You're an employee, you have a supervisor. supervisor, you have a manager. manager you have a vice president. vice president, you have a ceo. ceo, you have a client. client, you have your own boss at your own place of business. it's the gigantic american boss cycle. checks and balances to the point where no one's truly the leader. even the president has to listen to the public, or he (hopefully) gets voted out in november.  now, we all catch these bosses in the act, and don't say anything about it. you see them picking their nose, and eating their boogers. you see them with the toilet paper trailing on their shoes, and you let it slip by you because you don't want to say anything and feel like an ass. well, for a long time, i've been catching my boss in the act. he dances. he dances in the bathroom. everytime i go in there, there he is, singing, dancing, playing waste-paper basketball. living it up in the can while i'm in the cubicle dying of starvation and being treated like an indentured servant. well, this has to stop. SO, in retaliation, i set up a surveillance camera in the can. what i found is so graphic that i can't even post it to this website, i have to set it up as a link. that way young eyes won't be exposed to this without forewarning. so, without further interpretation, here is my boss, jeff gawronski:    urlLink dancing naked in the bathroom

      ol' roy's at it again... so my cell phone number was with t-mobile for about a year and just recently (like six months ago) i switched to at&t for better coverage, and just last month (actually, may) i finally cancelled my t-mobile account. well, i guess i got a call from t-mobile today that said that if i don't pay my bill they're going to shut off my service... i wasn't home, i didn't get the call. actually they left it on the answering machine. but that's not my point. my dad decided that he listened to it, so he can delete it off the machine, and that he'd just relay it to me. yeah. that works. there was a phone number i was supposed to call to get that all cleared up. he didn't remember that part.... so anyrate. they threatened to turn my phone off, to which i say "ha, it's already been off for a month....!!!" but they can't hear me say that because dad didn't write down the number i was supposed to call. so his message to me is that they called and if i don't pay the bill their going to turn the phone off. his addition to the message was "how dare them think they can turn my phone off, it's not your phone, and the account is through ameritech".... so after explaining 1.) they weren't threatening to turn his phone off, they're threatening to turn my phone off, and 2.) ameritech is now SBC, he still thinks that if i don't shell out the money, then they're going to turn his phone off..... well, that's senility....

      looks like summer finally hit here milwaukee. the back and forth between spring and winter that we've been experiencing since april has really been doing a number on my head, i hope it stays warm like this long enough for the snot to clear out of my head...  i'm starting to believe that this misery that i call existence is going to be it for the of my life. work. home. work. home. boring girlfriend, boring work, suburban life, and they say it's all downhill from here... i'm starting realize why some people end up killing themselves, not because there's truly a problem, but just because they can't deal with the monotony of real life. if it wasn't for once a week when i get to see different people on sundays, i'd probably be dead. there's no excitement in my life. i don't go home to anything worth while other than my dog. my girlfriend isn't worth leaving the office for, i'll tell you that much.  so i have a puppy and a few friends (that aren't my miserable girlfriend) that chose to hang out with me once in a while... great, this is my life. can't wait to see how miserable i am at 40 married to  fat rhonda , selling waterbeds in some fictitious suburb of madison...  seriously, all i need is a wiff of some really attractive woman's perfume and a night out doing something worthwhile just to remind me that i'm not dead. perfume like the stuff christina used to wear... mmm... she was an annoying bitch, but she wore a nice fragrance...  i don't know if i'm someone who wants to fall asleep but just can't or if i'm someone who likes to be awake but feels tired all the time...

      Big Blue (the crane) was brought into milwaukee to assist in lifting the roof sections to the top of miller park, the newly constructed ball park built to replace the aging milwaukee county stadium. the job was to build the roof sections for the reductive roof on the ground, and then have Big Blue lift them into place. since the ball park stood at 295 feet tall when fully assembled, they were going to need a crane almost twice that height in order to lift the 400+ ton slices of roof. Big Blue's mast was 557 feet long and stood at 450 feet tall, and was well capable of lifting the comparably light 400 tons. at the time, this was the tallest, strongest crane ever produced. up until this point, every lift went off without a problem. on July 14th, the had decided that it was too windy (30+mph gusts) and that it was unsafe to do the pick that day. but then mitsubishi, the creator the roof, decided that it was more important to complete the stadium than it was to worry about the safety of their works. sure enough, the crane stood to full mast, moved about 30 feet, and toppled over onto the nearly complete building, setting construction back two years, and taking the lives of the three men who sat in a cherry picker attached to the crane that were spotting the lift.

      Once again, i'm sick of sitting out here in the suburbs all day. i had the opportunity to go down to the third ward before work this morning. man, there was a cafe, store front, and parking spot on every corner, woman in a short skirt walking down every block, and nothing to be sad about. i come out here, and i have to deal with the rural hicks and other ass-clowns that don't realize that their kids are at home smoking pot right now.  "oh we moved out to the suburbs so they'd be raised in safer environments..."  are you talking about the same kids that i see wasted every friday night, raising hell and spray painting the hell out of your neighborhood... i'd hate to tell these backwoods hicks, but their kids are the ones ruining the safer environment that they tried to raise them in. my only problem with where i work is that it's so far away from anything. i can look out my window and see farm fields. i have to get in my car and drive 10 minutes at minimum to go anywhere for lunch. that's what blows dick about this place. i should have asked the company i was delivering my drawings to if they were hiring...  if i had my way, we'd do away with the suburbs and force everyone to live downtown, or within a three mile radius...

      manoman... mid summer fever... i'm not talking the flu, and i'm not talking the syphilis... no, i'm talking the brewers. remember back in the day? the posters and advertisements??? "Milwaukee Brewers, catch the fever - they're turning up the HEAT..." yeah, you remember those... they had the song too... "brewers, brewers, they're turning up the heat, milwaukee brewers, brewers, they're turning up the heat..." yeah, well if that's the fever, than this is a cold i've never been able to shake....  and why do i bring this up, you ask... oh because the brewers are playing like it's 1980 something all over again. out of nowhere, they're keeping a solid record, contending in their  division, and furthermore, sending multiple players to the allstar game.... WHAT? what do you mean they're sending pitchers to the all star game!?!? if you're not in the loop, i break it down like this.... the brewers haven't had a solid pitch since ROLLIE FUCKING FINGERS... AND HE WAS A CLOSER!!!! we haven't had a hall-of-fame quality player since robin yount or paul molitor. but look at them now... ben fricken sheets man. where'd this boy come from??? he's just rocking the mound. if the team can get some runs to support him, the man will never lose. 22 1/2 innings right now since the last time someone scored on him. yeah, that's a 2.26 ERA.... oh that's leading the majors... flash in the pan? this is his third straight year of rocking it on the mound. kinda makes me wonder where he'll be next year OH WAIT, i forgot, he requested a contract extension to guarantee that he'll be back in milwaukee next year. damn, that's funny, he actually wants to play here... guess it's better to be something big nowhere than nothing great somewhere. seriously, a guy of his talent could start on the yankees, but no one would notice him in new york.... he'd be just another all star on that team. sitting on the brewers on the other hand, he's the man who has everyone's attention... it's good to be the king.  anywho. sorry about all that, i get fired up when sheets pitches 8 solid scoreless innings and than danny kolb comes out and protects sheet's work. right now, they're the masters, and that's all that matters... and who the hell is the lyle overbay guy??? hope that 1st base guy whose name eludes me right now is having fun riding the dl bench down in arizona to end his career... what was his name again... god i think it started with an s... or a r... or something... eh who cares... we got 5 rock solid players for a guy who's never going to play again... remember folks, if someone from a wisconsin sports team is sniffing around your training camp, turn around and don't talk to them. ask atlanta what we did to the falcons in the quaterback position, and ask arizona what we did to them in at 1st base... OH YEAH, i think his name was mitchie phefton... or something like that... or was it itchie sprinton... i don't remember... damn, i know he played for the indians before milwaukee...

      that blue eyed little portugese songstress is going to be the fucking death of me, i swear to god. she's the kind of unobtainable hot that makes people like me hate thier position in life. it's really unfair to us ugly guys, but you know girls like that love the attention anyways. i think i'm moving to portugal or spain where girls like that are a dime a dozen. but then again, attitude is everything, and she has this insane knowledge of music and whatnot that makes her 20 fucking times hotter.... god dammit... as the great Tricky once said, "she makes me wanna die...."  oh shit, i forgot about that song, i wonder if they have it on rhapsody...   urlLink

       god dammit god dammit god dammit i hate being poor. like, i'm not  poooor , i four unscheduled meals everyday and always have an open Dr. Pepper near by.  i have an $80 banzai tree sitting on my desk and a $30,000 car parked in the drive way.  I'm really NOT poor.  I just don't have any money. which sucks. I owe money on two computers, my car, college, and a few credit cards.  if it weren't for those bills, i'd have so much money. at least $2000 exta a month. that $2000 is half of the price of a G5 mac. and dear god that's what i need. i'd really like to have a G5 and no one understands why. the software i use to make music was designed primarly to be used on a mac, but was ported over to the pc so it could sell a few copies. well, the pc version is very chopy and is rough around the edges. which is funny, because it's probably the best music production software out there. ah such is life. i don't want to end up paying $80 a month for the next 4 years because i won't even have the computer by then.... one of these days, i'm going to be rich....   urlLink

      So here i am, blowing a morning away when i should be at church. listening to Soul Coughing when i think to myself, "what ever happened to that M Doughty?" so, i look him up on the wonderful world wide web like any good fan would do, and i get to his home page... and click the link to go to his picture.... and i see his pictures.... and i come down to one conclusion...    David Gray:      M Doughty:      YES, it is my belief that M Doughty and David Gray are the same person. much like the Superman/Clark Kent fiasco, mr. doughty wanted to make soft styled music to entertain college coeds who like to fuck and upperclass yuppies who like to make coitus. and in order to do that, he had to create the man that is David Gray. have you ever seen them in the same place at the same time??? DIDN'T THINK SO. and i can guarantee that he never thought in his entire life that someone would like both soul coughing and david gray, keeping his identity safe. oh but it's over now.    if you are david gray or m doughty, please email me at  urlLink brodymann37@hotmail.com  and we will talk about what it will take to keep me quiet ($$$).

      god damn if i have to wipe my asses for the rest of my life, i'm going to hang myself at 30, or die of an embolism by 32.... i swear, between the one guy who feels NOTHING in life is correct, no matter how perfect things are, he'll find away for me to have to fix it, to the other guy that likes to lead me into mistakes so that way he can yell at me and make me fix them.... i'm just taking a nice soft cloth to their asses. that's all my job is. just pamper them and make them feel better because their lives are meaningless. seriously, the one guy in the office here, he gives me drawings on monday, i finish them right away, and hand them back. tuesday afternoon he looks at them, and tells me the symbols (for the lighting fixturers) i used are wrong.... he doesn't show me the right ones, but says i used the 8' fixtures when i should have used the 4'..... so i change them to match what we used for 4' fixtures on all of our other jobs, never once did he tell me that the fixtures we were using were 4' fixtures anyways....  so i change them first thing wednesday morning, just for him to come over today and tell me i'm using the wrong symbols still... i just go "what are these fixtures supposed to look like?" he draws the symbol out..... and lo and behold... it's the same damn fixture i was using the first time. i pull out the drawings that he started out with and ask him "you mean like this?" he goes "yes, but only like that...." with NO difference between the two... oh dear god i can't wait until my heart explodes at age 55 while sitting on the couch drinking a beer.... this life truly sucks with no hope for redemption... check please.

GOOD FUCKING CHRIST he's living the life i want to live. so you're telling me, all i have to do in order to garden and write music for the rest of my life is have the u.s. help me take over a third world nation and demoralize it from the inside out while killing 55% of all the people who live there, and in the end surrender myself over to the very country that put me in power???? GOD DAMN sign my ass up for that program. i mean, fuck this living a stable normal life, it's getting me no where. where do i sign up to be a crazy dictator so i can read and write all day while tending to my fucking bonsai....

He's like, the dream-pop master. the guy can write musical progressions that make you feel like you're as high as a kite... anywho, if you have the means to look up his music (napster, kazaa, rhapsody), his current work is with a band called  urlLink Violet Indiana  and he did a lot of work with a group called   urlLink the Cocteau Twins . seriously, if you have the means, check them out.  and violet indiana did just release a new album called  Russian Doll , and it's freaking spectacular....  and the lead singer is hoooot....

      i've found one more reason to hate the suburban sprawl craptank: the drive out here. the drive out here makes me hate the suburbs even more. i know i don't live in the most urban area myself, but this is even worse and i love to complain about it.... i swear to god it takes me forever to drive out here in the monring. i start between 7:30 and 7:45.  in reality, it's a 15 minute drive to my office. now, on any given day, there's about 200,000 cars sitting on a small 5 mile stretch of Interstate 894 going from the Hale Interchange to the Zoo Interchange, which is the majority of my commute. and that is what sucks about my commute. i get on the freeway. and i stop. and then i have to deal with the fucking idiots that are surrounding me. it'd work better if i had a fire arm, but because of my criminal record, i'm not allowed to own fire arms ("but my wife does").... anywho... i'll stop bitching about this....  funny, i just heard bruce springsteen say that music artists are the only people that will be able to get the youth to vote... because us youth love to do what music artists say... i'm gonna go download mp3's... fuck the stars...  oh dear god, some guy in the office just asked me how to do something, and i told him word for word, then he tells me it doesn't work, and i decided to troubleshoot with him only to find out that he didn't follow ANY of my instructions... so it's obviously my fault that it doesn't work... i am so sick of this crap tank... if there were an actual job market in pittsburgh, i'd so move there... the only problem is, there is NO job market in pittsburgh.... found that out the hard way...

      this is how boring my life is. i've been so busy at work that it's all i do lately. i've even been taking work home with me. money's nice. that's all i have to say. and the more work i take home, the more money that's in my pocket. that G5 will be mine in no time.  anybody out there use rhapsody? that program is so fucking nice. i've got a killer playlist going too, if anyone wants it, pop me an email...  anywhosit, i'm getting used to being in bay view now. talk about a great neighborhood. i thought the east side was nice, around the downer woods and murry hill, downer avenue and all that area, all the way down to north avenue and brady street... anywhichway, i thought that place was nice, but damn i was wrong. bay view doesn't really look like much, it looks like any old city really, but talk about the people. man, i never realized how stuck up and snobby the people on the east side really are until i met some people in bay view to compare. so far, in the two weeks time we've been there, i haven't passed a single person on the street that hasn't said hello to me, or greeted me, or asked me if i was new in the area. every last one of them. walking down kinnickinnic avenue, there's hordes and hordes of people in the evening and they all say hi... what the fuck's up with that... at first i was afraid of the kindness of the neighborhood. i mean, i've never seen so many people be friendly to complete strangers... and then when you duck into one of the pubs, if people there don't know you, they buy you drinks... FUCK, what the hell, at first i thought everyone in the neighborhood was out to get something from me, but then i realized that this is actually how human beings are supposed to treat each other. now i find myself buying complete strangers beer and waiting to see who's going to get the next round... what i'm really trying to say, is that the east side - that's shit. if i wanted to be around fake lousy people, i'd go to l.a. Bay View - that's where it's at. great people, cheap beer, GREAT atmosphere, and it's not polluted by over population. love for human life actually bleeds from the streets of bay view. if anyone on the east side is sick of paying too much for rent a month to live in a shitty place, move to bay view where you can pay less for the same shitty apartment.
