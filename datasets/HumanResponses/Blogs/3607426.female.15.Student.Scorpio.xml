      It's been five to six days that camp's over... Somehow I missed camp though I thought that it wasn't gone be exciting... I remember last year getting all excited about it and kept on telling my parents how much I wanted to go for the camp...But this year was jus not the same... I knew something was wrong but I jus didn't know how to express it..I've not told anyone about it but i jus know that something's not right...it's all about the feelings i guess...sometimes i really wonder to myself whether i'm doing the right thing? well... let's not talk about it.. camp... well... somehow i enjoyed it... didn't expect my group members to be who they were... but i guess it's all about bonding that i grew closer to my church youths...this year's youth camp really bonded many youths...it really touched my heart to see the youths get together as one...it's all about the spiritual bonding...i guess it's through camps that brings us together... and through the washing of each other feets.. thanks Rei..(you'll what i mean)... this year's camp was somehow different...very different...everything was jus changing...maybe because my parents were now attending the same church and i knew that my parents were there to give their blessings which was different this time round...i guess things were changing..really wanna thank God for that...is the change gonna be good or bad? well...guess i'm jus gonna leave it...games and talent night were jus so great...everything seemed going on fine...haha... samuel(indian sam)"heaven is in my heart"... i really liked that scene...! it was great... Dolly...you did a great job too...as a first timer in camp you did great...Ray.. first timer too but a very good actor..you acted well for mr bean.. Weida..that guy has full of WK dollars... haha... every auction he'll go for it...rich guy...Bastien...finally got into the youth... hehe...good actor too.. go bas!...there's so many things i wanna say...but somehow the feelings not right... what should i say or how should i put it... well... God touched my heart this time round and i really cried my heart out...there were so many changes...but is the change gonna be good or bad? sometimes i really wonder...well...time and time again i feel that some things gotta be changed... once again like i said it's the feelings.. anyway ... i guess i've written quite alot...very tired...have to sleep...rest is something i need now...i'll write another one tmr... yupx.. nitex and God bless!
