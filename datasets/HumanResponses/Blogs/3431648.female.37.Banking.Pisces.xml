						   Crystal rain falls slowly, leaking out of my eyes. Looking in my broken mirror (seven bad years, don'tcha know?), I see the reflection so clearly. The image of my heart, bleeding slowly, tear and shatter. a shattered image of what could have been. A lost love, passing time doesn't heal me any quicker. The tears (crystal rain, so lovely but it hurts so much) can't stop. The agony will never end. We came from different worlds, different times, and can never meet again. One brief moment was all we had. One fleeting memory of the love we shared. As time goes by, will you think of me? For I will always remember you. I will always love you as time goes by.   My God, was I depressed or what? I vaguely remember where I got the crystal rain from, it was the name of a band someone I knew was in. I think. Well, it was over 15 years ago. My romantic life was, well, fairly pathetic (hmm, nothing seems to have changed in 15 years) and this was written about Steve, who I was completely obsessed with. I remember writing this in the bathroom of a bar, staring at myself in the mirror and writing this will tears were streaming down my face as I sobbed over the injustice that he just didn't want me. Now, of course, I realize that I'm actually quite lucky that none of my relationships ever worked out. But still, he was hot, drove a Mustang and was in a band...and had total 80's rock star hair, long and black. God, I'm old. I had a crush on a guy with a mullet.  You know what's worse about that, actually? The fact that he read this and actually gave me advice on it, even knowing full well it was about him. Bastard.

						   Dance for you must, Always one step away from destruction, Never look back And see what could have been. Maybe your past was bad And your future looks dim but Realize what you have to give Instead of thinking of what was taken away. Enter a love affair with yourself.   Pretty easy technique.  Wrote this in high school when our Speech Teacher decided it would be a good idea.  Each sentence starts with the first letter of a letter in your name.  For security, I left off my last name.  Sorry.  Try not to be too devastated.

						   What is the Meaning of Life? Is it to be held in the palm of God Almighty? Or is it just another Monty Python film?     I took an Advanced Poetry class at Lakewood Community College (no longer around, it's now Century College) in 1986.  Our assignment was to write poems using different styles we had learned and turn them in for our final grade.  This was the poem on the title page.

						   Why not?  I may have 3 or 4 by the time I finish.  Maybe I'll collect them?  No, this is my attempt to be organized.  I have one blog for fun and goofy things that happen/have happened to me  urlLink (green duckies and other tales of Dana) , this one for poetry and maybe I'll start working on my novel(s) again.  I haven't written anything seriously in many years and I'm hoping that typing some of my earlier poetry will help kickstart my muse.  Let me know what you think.  One warning, I was seriously depressed in high school so some of this may be a little dark.  Things are much better now...in fact, since I wrote my best poetry when I was depressed, this might be why I haven't written any poetry for awhile...

						   When I was a child, you carried me in your arms and told the world I was yours forever. When I grew older, you sat me down and tried to explain life to me, but left the sex talk to Mom. When I met my first man at the tender age of fifteen, I couldn't tell you because I couldn't face your disappointment. When the drugs and the alcohol and the cigarettes invaded my life, threatening to take me away, you told me to use you as an example. To see what they could do to a person. When I finally beat my addiction to everything but the cigarettes, you were so proud of me. You read my stories and my poems, came to see me act in plays and told members of the audience, "See her? That's my little girl!" You told me I could do anything that I ever set my mind to. You taught me to hate injustice and prejudice and to love peace and others. When I made the mistake of loving the wrong people and gave too much of myself away, you tried to understand and told me that you'd always love me, no matter what my faults were. I may not see you every week like I see Mom but you are only a phone call away. And, like you, I may not approve of everything you do, but I will always love you and I'm trying to learn to love myself. If I do succeed, I know who to thank. So I will raise a Mountain Dew to you and give this toast. "Here's to a father that loves me without any doubt. here's to the one man I know will always care about me. here's to a father from a daughter who will turn to members of the audience in her life and say, 'See him? That's my Dad! Ain't he quite a guy?' Here's to you, Dad, my best man.   Well, quite frankly, it's an awful, awful poem. But it's all true. He wasn't the best Dad in the world. But he was mine and he helped mold me into the person I am today. I don't remember when I wrote this, probably in my 20's. I still regret that I let one drunken incident keep me from talking to him for the last 3 years of his life. Happy Father's Day, Dad. I love you.

						   Girl: Angel of Death, please come and take me, for my love no longer loves me and I wish I could die. Angel of Death, please weild your sword. Remove my pain, remove my sorrow. Angel of Death,  please come and take me away. Carry me in your cold embrace and let me die. For the nights, they are so cold since he left my side. For the days hold no pleasure anymore. Angel of Death, please come and take me, for my love no longer loves me and I wish I could die.  Angel: My child, as your life blood ebbs from your wrists, as your breathing becomes shallow, you call my name. My child, do not beg for me to take you, for life is too short to just throw away. My child, please, while there is still time, reconsider this foolish thought that a false love is worth dying for. For the nights may be cold since he left you but nights with me are colder still. for the days may hold no pleasure now but as time goes by they someday will. My child, as your life blood ebbs from your wrists, as you heart beat slows, you call my name. Repent, while there is still time.  Girl: Angel of Death, please ignore my call. do not come and take me. I am much too young to die.  Chorus of the Undead: So are we all, those of us that thought a false love was a true love. So were we all.   Okay, high school again.  If there was a guy in particular, I don't remember who he was.  I do remember riding the bus home from school and scribbling this in a notebook.  Obviously, I was extremely suicidal in high school.  Lots of mood swings.  Now I still battle depression but it's usually only around my birthday and I can usually snap myself out of it.  I have great friends who keep me smiling as well.  Plus, hey, I'd rather laugh than cry.

						   Is life so cruel that such a small but beautiful bird should die, noticed only by one person? A bird should not die such an undignified death, spiraling into a bucket of water after crashing into a window. Birds should be as graceful in death as they are in life. A beautiful bird should not have died in the palm of a lonely girl's hand. Expecially after she thought she had rescued him from a watery grave.   High School again.  Pretty self-explanatory.  I was depressed as hell and then this damn bird flies straight into our living room window.  I think I cried for about an hour, despairing over the fact that this poor bird had died in my hands and oh, woe is me, I am so miserable and alone...you know, the crap you despair about as a teenager.  Boy, I don't miss the constant mood swings.

						   Oh, instrument of my approaching doom, how you do shine at me. Are you trying to lure me into a fishnet of folly, as you did to father and brother before me? Please go away, for tonight I am trying to be strong and resist the temptation of your siren call. I have listened to your love song before, believed you when you showed me the mock-pleasure of your depths, but, oh, how I regretted following you in the morning. Please go away (or at least be quiet), I beg for if I let you deceive me again, I will wake to find that a fisherman's nag of a wife has used my brain as a battlefield. She adores throwing her best crockery at her hen-pecked husband and running after him, swinging a sledgehammer, leaving my brain a shattered mess she sweeps up and under a blanket of confusion. Oh, instrument of my approaching doom, how you do shine at me. I'm coming in. I think the water will be fine. At least until the morning.   This was one of the Meaning Of Life poems.  Two things about this poem - One, alcoholism is hereditary.  Two, I'm a Pisces (fisherman's wife, siren call, are you noticing the symbolism?) and a book I once read on astrology stated that Pisces have a tendency to gravitate towards alcoholism, drug abuse and have difficulty finding long term relationships.  A former friend's comment when reading that passage was "Huh.  Looks like you're going to be a drunk slut."  Nice, right?  This is why she's a former friend.  So, since alcoholism runs in my family and I can get depressed all on my own, I avoid alcohol.  It took me a long time to realize I can have fun without involving liquor.

						   There's a place in my heart I reserve for you. No one can touch it for it is frozen tight. No one can thaw it, try as they might. Not even you, though you haven't even tried, can make that spot sing. In that section love has died, the love I had for you. Oh, I'll never forget you, though I know I've tried. There is just something about you that makes me relive that night in the dark, where you fumbled and I thought "Is this what love is all about?" And that night the spot began to freeze. Then later, when I found you had lied, ice water flowed in my veins. so that is why, in that spot, no man can touch my heart and experience the love I could have given someone. Thanks to you.   Advice to young girls - when you are 15 and you meet a 17 year old who pays you a lot of attention and tells you that he loves you, run, run away.  Your parents are right, he is only after one thing.  And when you, starved for affection, give him that one thing, well, all I can say is find a good therapist because you're going to waste your life feeling guilty.  Don't have sex until you're ready to deal with it, okay?

						   You're saying that you love me and I know you don't mean it but I want you to mean it, I want you to care. Tom complains about picking up garbage, and I say all I've done my life is pick up garbage, but I don't mean paper cups, food, I mean all of you. Each one of you invades my mind, my one night stands, my big mistakes. I thought I had hidden you away. But he saunters through my mind once again, bringing back a parade of memories. I remember Dean, the first, saying he loved me, shattering my heart when he never called. Doug and Darrel, two for the price of one, one saying "I love you," the other another liar. Then he came along, got me at the right moment. didn't lie, just made me cry, got me involved, hoped for a new love. Why'd he do it? So I say never get involved with a pick-up. But shouldn't I say no more pick-ups? Why can't I stop looking for love in a stranger's eyes and learn to look for it in my own?   Right after high school.  I'm not sure who the "he" in this is - I do know that when I was younger, I was extremely insecure and would form instant bonds with any man that would pay attention to me (I think you can figure out what I mean by instant bonds).  I've learned a lot and have realized I don't need a man in my life to be happy.  But God, I miss kissing.

						   Sands and sunshine were promised in the green of your eyes. Crying was not shown, the crying I was soon to know. Oceans have been traveled by many, who, searching truth,  are trapped in lies. I, too, sailed to find truth, only to find myself lost. Sands and sunshine were promised but they were not to be found. Reality is often painful and cannot be avoided, unless one is to live in a world of dreams. Maybe that's what your eyes truly promised.   Yeah, you know what I was saying about crushes?  Here's another one.  I worshiped this guy named Scott.  Now, of course, I can barely remember what he looked like.  This one was from 1984.

						   Tender lips I wish were mine to touch, they speak. "Life is but a pantomime." What do you mean? I long to question but dare not ask. All my love is carried in one small flask. One rough push and it will break, all my love to spill out for all to take. Hurt me as much as you will but I ask you please, love me still. Break my heart but still care for me. and if you must go, please promise me that you will return. Tender lips I wish were mine to kiss, they speak. "Goodbye" you say and leave my sight. Please, I beg of you, come back soon.   High school.  Written about this guy in the Drama Club with me - all we ever did was argue.  Nothing ever happened between us, I just had a crush on him.  This one has actually been published (okay in a  urlLink Poetry.com  anthology but still).

						   A splash. Sinking slowly, hair streaming. Down. Lying on the bottom. Feeling rough coral reef. Smelling seaweed rot. Dying. A vision of my old life passes before my now dead eyes, I am rising. Gravity holds her force over me one last time. A splash. Breaking the surface. Spectators scream in horror. Man swims out, tries to save me. Fails. Tears on my face are not my tears but yours and the Sea's. tears on your face because you did me wrong. didn't care enough to love me. Only to use me. Fall on my face, taste of salt. Now that I am gone, the cycle will continue. Your turn is next. The Sea will claim a new victim. A splash. Sinking slowly, hair streaming. Down.   Okay, I wrote this in 1985.  A group of us at my high school were picked to attend this workshop.  I was in the poetry workshop and the leader decided to have us all write a poem based on one element, we had to include a coral reef.  It took me maybe 15 minutes to write?  The leader asked for volunteers to read their poems and after listening to this guy read this rambling about someone named Bill (there is a Roseanne episode where Darlene is going to read her poem and the guy that goes before her rambles about a bird.  It was very similar to the Bill poem), I decided to read mine.  I finish.  There is complete silence.  One person whispers "Wow."  That was it.  It's actually one of my favorites.  Well, I told you I was depressed in high school.

						   I am wondering why, after a month or two of a good friendship, one romantic interlude could change it all. Because, even though the innuendo was always there, we never came out and actually said what we really wanted. Then suddenly, I found myself on a "date" with you, holding your hand in a darkened theater, watching the suspense build up on the screen and feeling the sexual tension getting ready to explode. Until finally it did, in your bedroom. I guess it was kind of embarrassing for us to lose control like that. And, even though you said, we'd still be friends, I can't help wondering, if this will mean the end.    After what happened with the guy in   urlLink  See What You've Done   , I had not been attracted to men with red hair for years.  SJ changed that.  We worked together in a department store and used to spend more time talking to each other on the phone then actually working.  One night, we decided to go and see "The Hunt For Red October."  He was reading the book, I love Sean Connery and Alec Baldwin.  This was the night referenced in this poem.      I was right.  We didn't remain friends.  There wasn't a big blow out or anything but it was weird watching him date other women after we had been together twice.  And then I moved to Madison so we lost contact.  I haven't thought of him in years.  He was a nice guy, he made me laugh and he was really good in bed so hopefully, he's making some lucky woman very happy.

						   Becky is playing me songs that she says are me and you. And it's so true. How strange it is that songwriters who have never met us can know everything that went wrong, everything that went right, and everything in between. How do they know? Did you sell our story? I will wait for you, living all the dreams over again, trying to get over the pain, trying to live again. Looking for someone who is just like you but who doesn't feel the need to inflict pain. Looking for someone who is just like you who can make me laugh, who can love me for me, who doesn't want me to cry all the time. I'm looking for a facsimile, because the real thing isn't there. Never was. never will be. I want the dream you, not the real you. but I'll never forget you, who you were  and how you made me grow up, even when I didn't want to. Mark, thank you for being you. &nbsp;  Yes, Mark, thank you for being a complete and total jerk who damaged my self-confidence&nbsp;so that every man I met after you was able to walk all over me even more than I let you.&nbsp; Thank you for cheating on me with 3 other women, all at the same time (had the nerve to laugh about the day where he had sex with every single one of us, one right after another).&nbsp;     &nbsp;  First boyfriend, high school/1st year of college.&nbsp; Don't miss him at all.

      Here is a  urlLink link  that you might enjoy, well, if you're my Mom or anyone like my Mom, probably not.  The owner of the webpage is named Mil Millington and he is a genius.  I have read both of his books and am eagerly waiting for the 3rd.   I'm trying to get him a following here in America because, as he puts it, his American publisher is probably not going to bring him here.  Once the public starts clamoring for him, I'll deal with other problems, like the fact that he doesn't fly.    If you like the website, you will love his books.  The man is hilarious.  They are called Things My Girlfriend and I Have Fought About and A Certain Chemistry.  A Certain Chemistry is out in paperback here in the US but, I, dedicated fan that I am, convinced my roommate to buy it for my birthday from  urlLink Amazon.co.uk .  Fortunately, at that time, he didn't know the shocking difference between the US dollar and the British Pound.    Mil isn't for everyone but there are three of us in Minnesota who think he's brilliant.

      Found an interesting website today.  Apparently I am worth exactly: $1,354,040.00.   (DM, added on 5/28 - okay, so this is probably wrong.  Although I like to think I am fairly intelligent, apparently the 240 I entered for my IQ is only, oh, 100 points too much.  Oops.  I'll have to retake it.)    urlLink Check it out.   They ask you some questions about how old you are, how much education, etc.  I thought it was fun.  Going to Fridleykins (Perkins) with Beth, Keem and Matt tonight.  That's always fun.  We like to listen to people sitting at other booths - you would be amazed at some of the crazy stuff people say, especially if they've been drinking.  Oh, well, got to run.  Maybe I will have a "Weird things people say" post tomorrow.  Ciao!  Update - there weren't a lot of people at Fridleykins last night.  We had a great time playing Sheepshead.    Weird things people say -   DM (having strange fascination with patting Matt's shaved head) "I like your scalp.  May I draw on it?"  Matt "No!  That's the only part of my body I don't let my kids draw on."    And before you freak out, there are other parts the kids aren't allowed to draw on.  It was just the first thing he said.  We were very amused.

      Okay, so my memory isn't that great.  I have a tendency to forget what things are called.  Early Alzheimer's perhaps?  Not sure.  My friends, who are anywhere from 5 to 13 years younger than me, enjoy this trait because it is apparently amusing to watch me come up with names.  Here are some examples:  "The guy who looks like Ray Romano but isn't Ray Romano" - The first time I used this, Beth looked at me and said "So, in other words, this is any guy in the world?"  His name is, dang it, I forgot it again.  He's been on Seinfeld and Everyone Loves Raymond.  He talks slowly.  Yeah, I'll be editing, apparently.  Okay, checked with Beth, his name is Fred Stoller.  Here is his  urlLink Imdb  site.  "The funny guy, you know, the one who isn't Nathan Lane" - This is Larry Miller.  I finally do remember his name but before I would have to list the movies he's been in (Pretty Woman, Undercover Blues, 10 Things I Hate About You).  And yes, I do realize he and Nathan Lane look nothing alike.  Here's Larry's  urlLink Imdb  site.  "Not A Simeks" - This came about when I was trying to give Beth directions one day and was telling her she would recognize Minnehaha because there was a pizza place on the left and another building on the right.  Exact quote "It's a Simeks, no, wait, it's a...it's a Not A Simeks."  Beth "So it's anything (you will notice that Beth is quite sarcastic.  All my friends are.  It's quite horrid)?"  Anyway, a Not A Simeks is a butcher shop.  In this case, it was a Von Hanson's.    "Vant" - To vent and rant.  About something completely nonsensical.    There are more.  I just can't think of them right now.  How sad is that?

      Glad you asked.  It's a funny story, actually, and will give you an idea of what I'm like.  So my friend Beth and I are at the mall, at Mervyn's, Christmas shopping (or maybe it was near Saint Patrick's day.  I'll ask Beth and update).  We're walking through the accessory section and I see a table with a box full of rubber ducks.  Now I love rubber ducks and yes, simply because I love to sing the rubber ducky song from Sesame Street.  ("Rubber Ducky, you're the one.  You make bath time so much fun!"  (Side note:  Ernie is not my favorite muppet (although I am fond of him).  Cookie Monster is.  I love his philosophy "See cookie.  Eat cookie." And his theme song.  "C is for cookie, that's good enough for me."))  So I am looking at the rubber ducks, singing the song in my head, while Beth waits patiently for me.    Then I turn my head.  I see another table with another box, filled with creatures with big duckie eyes, except that they are green!  I am completely thrilled beyond measure and loudly say "Green Duckies!"    So then Beth, in the tone I imagine she will use on her future children, says slowly "No, Dana, those are frogs."  And then we had to leave Mervyn's because she was laughing too hard to continue shopping.  In my defense, I am claiming I thought they were decorated for Christmas (Or Saint Patrick's Day.  Whatever).    Frogs are now called green duckies.  Well, in my world at least.

      I've decided what America really needs is another award show for movies, except it won't be based on the Academy's categories - such as Best Actor or Actress, etc.  No, this would be based on what I thought.  My boss can't understand why, whenever I see a movie, I will refer to it as "The Best Movie of All Time."  He says I say that every time I see a movie and this, yes, is probably true.  However, the reason I say that is because I really get caught up in movies.  If I have no desire to see a movie but need to know what happens, I will make people tell me.  If I am watching a movie that a friend has recommended, I will ask them what is going to happen.  Seven is a good example.  A friend of mine wanted me to watch it and about halfway through I turn to her and we have this conversation:  DM "I need to know if anything happens to Gwynneth Paltrow's character." Friend "Why?" DM  "Because I'm not going to watch anymore, that's why!"  So do you know what she did?  She lied to me and told me Gwynneth would be fine.  Well, if you've seen Seven, you can understand why I was upset.  Here are some of my favorites:  Favorite Love Story -  urlLink Torch Song Trilogy .  It's the story of a drag queen (Harvey Fierstein, love him) and his loves (mother, son and yes, lovers Ed and Alan).  It was funny and tragic and beautiful all at once.  Matthew Broderick has never looked hotter in any other movie.  I don't care if you're gay, bi, straight, whatever, you should watch this movie.  Unless you're a complete homophobe and then you wouldn't appreciate it.  Favorite War Movie - I have two.   urlLink Operation Petticoat  which is a hilarious movie starring Cary Grant and Tony Curtis.  It takes place on a submarine and they end up rescuing a bunch of nurses.  Craziness ensues.  The second one is  urlLink The Dirty Dozen  which is the exact opposite of OP.  Well, there is craziness but it's not a sub accidentally painted pink, it's Telly Savalas as a psycho who hates women.  I love them both.  Favorite Suspense Movie -  urlLink The Spiral Staircase .  It was filmed in black and white and is very creepy.  There's no blood, no gore, just sheer terror as a madman is targeting women with "afflictions" and is after Helen, a woman who is mute because of a traumatic experience.  Really well done.  Okay, well, that's it for now.  Keem is sick and I must make sure she is not dead.  I am such a good roommate.  I also think Jeff, our other roommate, might want to use the computer for awhile.

      Why do I love these things so much?  Oh, well, just for fun.  1. Your name spelled backwards - Anad Eiram  2. Where were your parents born - You know, this is sad.  I have no clue.  My mother was born in Minnesota, I know that much.  3. What is the last thing you downloaded onto your computer - A web page counter.  I love blogspot, I am learning to do new and exciting computer things.  4. What's your favorite restaurant - Don Pablo's (Mexican), Timberlodge (mmm, steak), Fuddruckers (hamburgers)  5. Last time you swam in a pool - Probably a year ago  6. Have you ever been in a school play - Yes, many.  Also a lot of church plays.  7. How many kids do you want - I will, possibly, adopt someday.  Maybe.  A girl between the ages of 9-16.  Maybe.    8. Type of music you dislike most - Really, really loud Acid Rock  9. Are you registered to vote - Yes.  Mainly because I really want to do jury duty and that's one of the ways to get called.  That and I figure I can't complain about my government unless I vote.    10. Do you have a car - The question should be, do you have a driver's license and the answer would be no.    11. Have you ever ridden on a moped - Yes, actually.  And then I dumped it in the middle of the street.  12. Ever prank call anybody - Yes.  I was young and foolish and at a overnight church retreat.  Good Christian teenagers can rebel too!  13. Ever get a parking ticket - No.  If I ever get a license, I'll probably get a few.  I don't understand parallel parking.  14. Would you go bungee jumping or sky diving - No.  I refused to go to my sister's wedding when she was thinking of getting married at the Stratosphere in Vegas.  Not big on heights.  15. Furthest place you ever traveled - Mexico.  On the vacation from Hell.  16. Do you have a garden - No.  I have a black thumb.   17. What's the size of your bed - Queen.  However, I seem to think I'm on a twin and sleep at the very edge.  Well, at least I'm living on some sort of edge.  18. Do you really know all the words to your national anthem - Just the first verse.  I can sing it a cappella, though.  Not very well but still...  19. Bath or Shower, morning or night - Showers.    20. Best movie you've seen in the past 4 months - Ella Enchanted.  Troy (I sobbed horribly.  Didn't know it was a tear jerker, did you?).  Shrek 2.  Actually any movie I see is the best movie I've seen - until the next one.  21. What's the next movie you want to see - Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Raising Helen, Spiderman 2, Catwoman...I love movies.    22. Chips or popcorn - Depends.  Is there dip?  Are there jalapenos (for nachos)?  Is it Pop Secret Homestyle popcorn?  23. Have you ever broken any hearts - Why, yes, my beauty is such that I break hearts just by smiling.  Please.  Of course I haven't.  24. Premarital sex - Once upon a time, long, long ago, there was sex and it was good.  But then it was followed by waiting by the telephone and being dumped and the decision that men are evil.  And that was not good.  I don't miss it that much.  I miss kissing, though.  25. Are you a good cook - Yes.  However, since I am lazy and rarely cook, I have no way of proving it.  26. Orange or Apple juice - Apple Juice  27. Who was the last person you went out to dinner with and where did you go - Keem, Don Pablo's, Wednesday  28. Favorite type of drink - Mountain Dew, Orange Spiced Tea with milk and Sweet and Low  29. Best thing in the world - Going to the movies with Beth and Keem  30. Have you ever broken a bone - No.    31. Have you ever won a trophy - Yes, for typing, back in 10th or 11th grade.  32. What is your favorite board game - Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Scrabble, Scattegories  33. What is your dream car - El Caminos.  They are perfect.  They are little car trucks and I love them.  34. Ever order an article from an infomercial - I am weak.  I can't watch them because I will buy anything.  I joined Greenpeace because of an infomercial.  35. Coke or Pepsi - Diet Coke if served with a lime/lemon wedge.    36. Have you ever had to wear a uniform to work - I once had a fascinating career in fast food.  Polyester is not flattering.  37. Last thing you bought at a pharmacy - Generic Tylenol PM  38. Who are you going to marry - Well, Rowan Atkinson is married so I've decided to stay single out of protest.  39. Who would you like to meet - Rowan Atkinson (duh), Mil Millington, William Shakespeare, Elvis   40. Do you believe in love at first sight - I cried at Troy.  Of course I believe in love at first sight.  41. What features do you find most attractive in the opposite sex - I like noses.  I had a crush on Judd Hirsch for years.  Accents are huge as well.    42. Where would you go for a romantic evening - Well, I would have to say that the most romantic date I ever went on was in the park.  We spent hours just talking and feeding ducks.  The next most romantic one (same guy) was when we went to the zoo and he bought me a wax elephant.  It's not about the money spent or the place you are, people.  It's about the guy.  43. How many pairs of shoes do you own - Who cares?  You can only wear one pair at a time.  44. Last song stuck in your head - This happens to me all the time.  The worst time was when it was "Mairzy Doats."  All that I could think of was "Mares eat oats and Does eat oats and little lambs eat ivy."  Over and over again.  Until I ended up slapping my forehead and yelling "Get out of my head."  Here's a thought, don't do this in public.  People will think you're insane.  45. Any pets - Edmund Fitzgerald Orange.  Named after one of my favorite songs "The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald" and my favorite soap character "Edmund Grey" from All My Children.  He's an orange cat, that's why his last name isn't Grey.  46. What's your all time favorite Saturday Night Live Character - Anything Gilda Radner did was gold.  The Land Shark.  47. What is one thing you would like to learn to do - I would like to get the discipline to finish my novel(s).  48. What do you do when you are bored - One can never be bored as long as one has books.  However, since Nora Roberts and Mil Millington do not write fast enough to suit me, I also watch a lot of TV and play on the computer.  49. What is one thing you would want someone to appreciate about you - Excuse me?  Everyone appreciates me.  I am glorious.  Okay, obviously I want people to appreciate my sense of humor and realize that yes, I am kidding.  50. What is one thing you are grateful for today - Free internet at work without a dial-up connection - no interruptions!  The cast of CSI:  Joss Whedon.  Adam West.  My friends.  My family.  My life.

      What a great weekend!  I work Sunday through Thursday so I had Friday and Saturday off already, managed to get Sunday off and we were closed Monday.  A four day weekend!  Wow!  This hasn't happened in awhile.    Thursday was off to Fridleykins with Keem, Beth and Matt for some Sheepshead.  Friday I stayed in and played on the computer all night, that's always fun!    It was on Saturday when I started to get wild (okay, keep in mind that I'm 37 and don't drink or do drugs.  Bingo is wild for me.  Okay.  It's sad, I know it but dang it, I'm old).  Hung out with my sister, Kari and Keem on Saturday.  We went to Arden Hill's Pot O' Gold and played Bingo.  That was great, I won $166 on the coverall!  It's gone now, of course, because Keem and I have a bingo rule, if either of us win, we split it.  Kari decided this rule applied to her as well.  Hmm, I wonder if she'll remember this if she ever wins the Powerball.  We played one session and then were off to Fuddruckers for the best hamburgers in Minnesota (the best hamburgers in the States are at the Burger Bar in Las Vegas).  We then returned for the 7:15 session and that's when I won.  Didn't win the 2nd session that night but it was still fun.  We then went back to Fridleykins with Beth and Tommy (a guy from work) joined us.  We initiated Tommy into the world of Sheepshead.  It was a lot of fun and hopefully he'll join us again some night.  Sunday we went to karaoke at The Chalet in Roseville.  The host is named Bryan McDonald and he is great.  He's very funny and wow, can he ever sing.  Keem had never gone to karaoke before so it was great having her there.  Beth and I are karaoke junkies and we joke that Bryan is our drug of choice.  We will applaud anyone who has the guts to come on stage and sing.  So, if you happen to be fond of karaoke, live in Minnesota and have a Sunday night free, come check it out.  Unless, of course, you are an axe murderer.  That would be bad.  And The Chalet has moved to Australia.

      I am re-reading Nora Roberts Key Trilogy right now, I'm just starting the 3rd book.  She does not have a new book coming out until August but, thank God, it's a JD Robb one.  Then it looks like I have to wait for October for anything else.  Write faster, Nora Roberts, you are my favorite author and I can't handle waiting this long between books.  I have just re-read Mil Millington's A Certain Chemistry.  I love his sense of humor and bizarre turn of phrase.  I know he's working on a 3rd book but is it here now?  No, it is not.  Jennifer Crusie released an extremely funny book this year called Bet Me.  I loved it but it was over too fast.  Probably time to read it again.  I am reading The Da Vinci Code at Beth's recommendation but it slow going.  It is my purse book (meaning that I carry it in my purse and read it whenever I am waiting for something or on lunch when at work) and I am only on the 2nd chapter.  It hasn't hooked me quite yet but it's getting there.  I'm more of a romantic comedy kind of girl and it is hard for me to get involved in a thriller...but I did like Angels and Demons.  I was reading The Face by Dean Koontz but it creeped me out and I had to stop.  I have a difficult time with both him and Stephen King.  It took me a year to read The Shining.  Not because I read slow but because I couldn't take it and would stop for several months.    Yes, just found out Sidney Sheldon has another book coming out...but not until September, dang it!    Any suggestions, my fellow bloggers?  What are you reading?  Who are you hoping will finish a book already?  Let me know...I have to convince Keem to go to the library, I can't afford to keep buying new books.

      Keem is asleep, Jeff is cleaning his car, Kari is at least online so I have someone to talk to...I know I shouldn't rely on other people to amuse me but it's so darn fun.  Oh, I found someone that did transcripts of Joan of Arcadia.  I got halfway through the pilot episode and then my brain exploded because this person doesn't understand basic punctuation.  The Joans and Wills and Kevins were bad enough but then when you're dealing with Ive and youre and youll...I couldn't take it anymore.  Plus, if you haven't seen the earlier episodes, like I haven't, it would really help to know what manifestation of God Joan is talking to at the time.  Oh well, I suppose I'll wait for the DVD's.  Then I'll make my own dang transcripts!  Well, I think I'll amuse myself by taking internet tests...maybe I'm secretly a genius.   Update - My IQ is apparently 127 points and I am an Insightful Linguist, similar to Charles Dickens.  Wow.  This might be because I was able to ace all of the word questions but had the worst time following the logic ones.  If you're interested in taking the test yourself, it's on  urlLink Tickle.   It was fun.  Although now my brain hurts from trying to think logically.

      Here's my latest  urlLink obsession .  I love CSI:  Crime Scene Investigation but didn't start watching it until this year.  So, trying to figure out what is going on between the incredibly hot Grissom and Sara, I started surfing the web for transcripts.  I found this site and have been reading one to two transcripts a day.  I don't know what I'm going to do when I finish.  I'm almost done with Season 3.    Soon, soon, I will be able to purchase the DVD sets and see my beloved Grissom and Warrick in action.  Another good site is  urlLink Buffyworld.com  because you can find the transcripts from both Buffy and Angel.  I love Joss Whedon and can't wait to see what he comes up with next.    After CSI:, I suppose I'll start looking for Joan of Arcadia transcripts.  I caught it in reruns the last two weeks and am now hooked.  Anyone know where there might be a site for transcripts?  I'd love to know.

      Yay!  I am so excited.  I will have to link to it as well!  This is so exciting.  I am a little worried about what she's going to say about me but I suppose since I have been so incredibly persuasive, I should just deal with it, right?  And by persuasive, I mean this:  DM:  Keem, you will find that many intelligent people blog.  I find that I truly enjoy reading other people's blogs.  It is a lot of fun and I like seeing recommendations for other websites.  I have found a lot of exciting stuff through the Blog World.  Keem:  Dana, if you ask me one more time, I'll never do it. DM:  Keem, I think you are very creative and should blog.  It will be fun. Keem:  Maybe.  Ahh, proof of my mystical powers.  And she claims I'm not the Queen of the Universe.

      So I have this viewpoint that I don't use a cell phone enough to justify actually having a cell phone.  The cheapest plan I've been able to find was one for $20 and you got 200 minutes.  Well, if you're me and don't drive and are usually with one of the people you want to talk to, what's the point in that?  I tried a prepaid phone and was getting ripped off.  You buy the card for $25 and you get so many minutes for the month.  If you don't use all of the minutes at the end of the month, you lose them.  Or you can buy a card for $50 and don't have to worry about your minutes expiring for two months...but, if you're me, you're never going to use all the time up and really, you're just paying a company to talk to people maybe 10 or 15 minutes a month.  It's completely a waste of money.  I had seen commercials for Virgin Mobile and decided to check out their  urlLink website  and they are surprisingly great!  As long as you spend $20 every 3 months, your minutes remain open.  You can download ringtones and celebrity voicemails...yes, the real reason I bought this phone is because if you call me and I don't answer, Adam West answers my phone (Have I mentioned that I love  urlLink Adam West ?  That he's the only Batman as far as I'm concerned?  That I shiver whenever I hear his voice...you probably didn't want to know that.  Note to my friends, photo 14 or 30 would be the perfect gift for my birthday...yes, I know it's not until March.)  The website will outline all of the rules and there's no hidden cost, everything is outlined completely.  It is great for people who don't talk a lot and really only want a phone so they don't have to search for a payphone all the time.

      I am sad.  Only got to see Beth for maybe a total of 2 hours this week.  And we're not going to Fridleykins because Keem and I, being insane, volunteered to work tomorrow.  But, there is the excitement of overtime!  Yay!  Money.    So hopefully we'll get to spend some quality Beth time this weekend.  And I am really disappointed that I won't get to see Matt tonight.  Mainly because I want to smack him across the head for making fun of Five for Fighting.  Damn him.  And I liked Grease 2 and Dude, Where's My Car.  Okay, yes, I know, not the best movies ever but still...  You should check out his blog, there's only one post so far but I'm looking forward to see what he comes up with next.  The link is to the right.

       urlLink This is hilarious!   I clicked 3 times and she married the Milwaukee Brewers, Urkel and Jerry Springer in the space of a minute.  With Britney and her quickie divorce and J Lo and her 3rd marriage, kind of makes you wonder why Bush isn't pushing an amendment to ban celebrity marriages, doesn't it?  Oh, but wait, at least J Lo and Britney aren't gay.  They're setting such a good example for our youth, huh?  Yes, people, that is sarcasm.    I have friends who are gay.  I want them to have as much of a chance of getting married as I do.  I want people to be able to accept other people for who they are, not who we want them to be.  I was brought up to believe that everyone was created equally and had the same rights as everyone else.  I read an editor to the letter lately that pretty much sums it all up.  Make it actually be "Until Death Do Us Part."  Let everyone have the opportunity to marry whomever they want but they can't rush into anything.  If you want to defend marriage, make divorce illegal.    Okay, Keem is done cooking.  Climbing off soapbox.  Convincing Keem to wash soapbox.  Putting soapbox away.  Going to eat.

      This was written one Saturday night at work.  Beth, Keem and I were all bored.  I was so bored I wrote a poem about Pizza.  Pizza is good. Domino's is in my neighborhood. I gave the pizza to Keem. Her face, it lit up like a beam. We say thank you to Brooksba. She is our friend - and that is no ha!  Okay, obviously you can see why I should be a writer with a multi-million dollar contract, right?  So I asked what I should write about next and Beth suggested I write about Keem.  This is what I came up with.  Keem is my friend. She has red hair. Why? When I am sad, she makes me smile. When I am happy, she laughs. When I am riding in her car, she scares me with the road rage and the shaking of the fist and the cursing at other cars. Keem is my friend. Her name is Keem because it is fun. But even though Keem spelled backwards is meek, don't cut her off on the freeway!  Someday I will share with you the Saga of Road Rage Keem (sounds like a new doll, doesn't it?)  Must go back to work, more customers are waiting to scream me.  Yay!  Fridleykins tonight!

      Craziness ensued today, my manager was out of the office.  This usually means that my day will be crap.  Today was no difference.  4 hours on the phone with customers and bankers, 1/2 hour meeting with only 15 minutes to prepare, hour meeting in which I went insane and started asking for more work.  "Ooh, let me do the newsletter, please, please?  I want to coordinate it.  Please!"  I was able to spend, oh, maybe all of an hour with my bankers.  I feel that I was really able to touch their lives with those nanoseconds I was there for them.    Then I come home and start watching Reagan's funeral and start crying.  And on Scrubs, Brendan Fraser was on and he died (okay, his character) and I cried.  I have been known to cry at cat food commercials so this isn't really a surprise.  Although the day did end positively.  We watched Last Comic Standing tonight - some very funny people.  I was excited that some of my favorites are going to Vegas.  Dan Ahdoot, Jessica Kirshon, Monty Hoffman, Dan Naturman, Jay London, Gary Guhlman, Chris Voth.  I was hoping that Paul Varghese and Juston McKinney would have made it as well but I guess I can't have everything, right?  Here's a tip.  If you need to go to the bathroom, don't watch stand up.  It's not good.

      Okay, I promised to explain what I meant when I referred to myself as DM, Queen of the Universe.  Once upon a time, I worked for another bank in the Payments Department.  There were a lot of women there and, as women tend to do, we enjoyed getting together and having a good time and, on occasion, we would work as well.  We had great relationships and would joke around with each other.  One of the women, Mermaid, would refer to me as a dork.  We were going to the coffee shop one day and I, being somewhat dramatic, made an announcement that would change my life forever.  I obviously wasn't feeling I was getting enough attention because all eyes were focused on whomever was pregnant that week.  DM (with sweeping hand gestures to draw attention back to her):  Hello?  Hello?  Pay attention to meeeeeeeeee.  (She is ignored and gives a big sigh)  You are all a bunch of dorks.  I am surrounded by dorks.  I am the Queen of Dorks and you are all my entourage.  Mermaid:  DM, if you really want to be the Queen of the Dorks, I won't argue with you.  So, for a while, I was satisfied with the adulation of dorks everywhere, but eventually began to feel that this wasn't enough.  I then conquered the world in a seamless coup (you didn't even notice, right?) but have decided that World Domination was just not enough for me.  I declared myself as the Queen of the Universe approximately four years ago and have been very happy with my rule.    Oh, and to prove I'm not just another insane person with delusions of grandeur, I have proof that I'm the Queen of the Universe.  Yes, I hold in my hands (okay, in with all the Christmas stuff) a Christmas ornament my sister bought for me that says "Queen of the Universe."  See?  Isn't it all clear?   The problem with this, of course, is that I do have to put up with the occasional subject that doesn't recognize my authority...this would pretty much be everybody.  It is very sad.  But I still carry on.

      I know you all read the post on  urlLink June 5th  and were horrified at the thought that Keem might be dead.  You will be happy to know that she was alive.  However, she was not properly grateful that I had suspended all of my personal enjoyment to make sure she was alive.  I know, dear reader, I was shocked as well.  Here is our conversation.  Keem is in the living room, sitting on the couch, watching TV.  DM (kind, caring tone):  Keem, are you dead? Keem (not so kind tone):  Yes.  I don't remember what I said next but I'm sure I expressed deep sorrow that she was dead.  I certainly did not ask her what she was making for supper.  I would obviously prepare the food for my roommate if she was ill.  And if she says otherwise, she is a liar!  But you knew that, right?  Because she told me she was dead and she wasn't.  Of course, since she doesn't have a blog, you would have no idea what her opinion is, right?  And no, Keem, this does not come under the category of nagging you to get a blog.  This is just a simple comment to  my loyal subjects, I mean readers.  I think I might have been a cat in a past life.  Okay, I leave you with these thoughts, a glimpse into the random madness that is I, DM, Queen of the Universe.    Yes, I'll explain that later.  Got to go back to work and get yelled at by more customers.

      I saw the movie last night with Keem, Adam and his boyfriend, Rich.  Adam, Keem and I have a tradition, we have seen all 3 HP movies at the same theater, Mueller Theaters in White Bear Township (Nice theater, they have the best buttered popcorn I have tasted, and the seats are comfortable but they lose out because you can not raise the armrests.  Keem and I prefer the Carmike Cinemas because you can raise the armrests and, while their buttered popcorn isn't as good as Mueller Theaters, they have Apple Cinnamon Flavoring (Yummy!)).    The movie was good but, as I told my boss this morning, it is not the best movie I've ever seen.  Spoiler Alert - if you haven't seen the movie, don't read the following!  ************************************************************************************ 1.	I'm not sure I like the new director, I felt that the movie moved too fast and while I know a lot of detail has to be left out, I thought too much was sacrificed. 2.	I was very disappointed that the Quidditch game was so short and that the incredibly hot Oliver Wood (so aptly played in the first 2 movies by Sean Biggerstaff (no, I am not making up that name)) was not in the movie.  And, for those who would condemn me for referring to Wood as hot, well, his portrayer is 21.  What I did like about the movie: 1.	A lot of attention was paid to Ron and Hermione’s burgeoning romance.   2.	The glorious Alan Rickman was back as Professor Snape (Sigh).   3.	Buckbeak was almost exactly like I imagined him. 4.	The new Dumbledore portrayed the character well and it was hard for me to see the difference.    If you’re wondering how I can only have two things in my disappointment features, well, you don’t know me that well yet.  I love movies and can lose myself in them completely.  A lot of times people will ask me if we're sure we saw the same movie because I thought it was great and they thought it was horrid.  Van Helsing is a good example.  I thought it was wonderful, one of my bankers thought it was awful.  Why the difference in opinion?  I can suspend reality and just enjoy a movie.  Most other people will watch a movie and analyze everything.  Stop doing that, people!  Just enjoy the movie!  It'll be more fun!

      -----Original Message----- From: Keem Sent: Sunday, May 09, 2004 12:12 PM To: DM Subject: Bad DM, Bad DM, what cha' gonna do when they come for you (no need to explain the song, I suppose)?  I can see it all now…7:02 pm, 494 and 24th avenue.  A routine traffic stop, or so it seemed…DM was pulled over for a broken tail-light while driving her classy, shiny, black El Camino (her friends are still in shock that she’s actually got her license and driving on the road).  When the officer approached her window, they saw bags and bags of impractical items from her recent shopping trip at the Mall of America and Wal-Mart in Bloomington, MN.  The officer, a rookie on his first ever traffic violation, jumped the gun (no pun intended) by drawing his gun, and ordered her out of the car-truck.  After a thorough search, he read her his rights and proceeded to bring her down to the station for interrogation.   “Ms. DM,” he asked, “would you care to explain how practical these items are, as you are in violation of Statute 1.07 of the practical penal code?”  “Why officer,” she replied, “one can never have too many sheep.  You never know when you’ll need one.  Then there are the DVDs.  They were on sale for $5.88 at Wal-Mart!  You have to take advantage of the sale.  My shoes, I know they are hot pink, but they are so cute.  I just had to have them…and the paper…you can never have too much scrapbook paper…”  “Ms. DM,” he said, “I fail to see the practical side to these purchases.  I’m afraid I’m going to have to confiscate them for evidence.  Furthermore, I’d like to see your checkbook register…”  And so begins the sad, sad tale of DM…there is rumor that she has escaped and has been seen in shopping malls across the United States…tune in to America’s Most Wanted for more of her story and a way that you can help her be brought to justice. -----Original Message----- From: DM  Sent: Sunday, May 09, 2004 1:02 PM To:  Keem Subject: In my defense  It was a dark and stormy night.  Thunder crashed and lightening streaked across the sky…  Oh, wait, that’s not the right genre, huh?  Let’s try again.  All eyes were on the judge as he perused the court list.  “Wait, let me get this straight.  We actually have a person who is being prosecuted over a violation of Statute 1.07 of the practical penal code?  Wow.  I didn’t think I’d ever get one of these cases.”   The bailiff leaned forward.  “It’s even worse than we thought, your Honor.  The Defendant is completely devoid of practicality.  She bought a…” the bailiff shuddered in horror.  “An El Camino.”  “No!  An El Camino?  That’s madness.  Madness, I tell you!”  The judge exclaimed.  “Get prepared to throw the book at her.”   DM’s lawyer was worried.  He had come up against ‘Hanging Harry’ Walters before and knew that the Judge was extremely prejudiced against people like his client.  He glanced over and saw the prosecuting lawyer smirk, excited about the prospect of sending another one of his clients to the ‘Spend-Free Row.’  “DM, I don’t think you understand the importance of what is about to happen here.  They’re prepared to sentence you to five years of living on a strict budget.  There won’t be any more DVD’s, DM.”     DM’s eyes filled with tears.  “No DVD’s?  I’ll never be able to live in a world like that.  They might as well lock me away forever.  Next you’ll tell me they’ll keep me from buying Nora Roberts’ books.”   Her lawyer sighed.  “I’m sorry but this Judge only reads Non-Fiction.  He would never condone a budget that makes allowances for novels, let alone romance novels.”  He took his glasses off; his piercing blue eyes met hers in a look that was frank but also touching.  His hidden desire for her was threatening to come to the surface.  He wanted her but, because she was his client, he couldn’t act on his love.  He had to save her, not only from the judge and jury, but from herself as well.  “I think you’ll have to plea-bargain,” he said softly.  “It’s the only way.”  His eyes darkened with pain.  “Damn it, woman, why did you have to buy the El Camino?  Why?”  “Malcolm, haven’t you ever had a dream?”  DM asked.  “Hasn’t there been anything that just screamed out ‘Yes!’ so loudly that you just had to have it?  This is something I’ve wanted since I was a teenager.  Is it really all that wrong?  You ask me why but the real question here is why not?”  “That’s it!”  Malcolm realized.  “It’s the perfect defense.  It’s the only way!  You’re brilliant!”  DM blushed.  “Thank you, Malcolm.  I knew you would see the light.”  Malcolm smiled at her.  “Actually, with this defense, there’s no reason we couldn’t be together.  Unless, of course, you wouldn’t be interested in an attorney with a heart as big as his vocabulary…”  He waited anxiously for her answer.  DM’s reply was simple.  “If I can’t live in a world without romance novels, I certainly wouldn’t be able to live without you.”  (No, Mom, there's not really a Malcolm.  I just like the name.) -----Original Message----- From: Keem Sent: Sunday, May 09, 2004 1:36 PM To: DM Subject: Ms. Prosecutor, begin your opening statement...   “An El Camino…while it was big in its day, it really isn’t practical now.  While it does have truck like qualities and would be practical for moving…but really, how often does one move?  And the gas it eats.  Not very practical when you drive 30 miles a day to work and back.  Ms. DM is not a victim here.  Impracticality seems to be her life.  Books.  Tons and tons of books that are carelessly strewn about her room and apartment.  Books are meant to be treated with kindness and respect.  Dare I mention the…(slight pause) BROKEN SPINES (the jury gasps in shock)?!  Broken Spines, a huge sign of carelessness.  Now, I could understand if they were books for research or even non-fiction, but Romance Novels and Science Fiction!  What has this world come to?  And the DVD’s!  A one-woman whirlwind tearing through the $5.88 bin at Wal-Mart.  Buying them just because they are on sale.  Needless to say, that there are many that have not been discovered yet as there is a team of investigators trying to sort through all of the evidence.  Well, we’ve got trouble my friends.  Right here in this very courtroom.  The idle checkbook is the devil’s playground for impracticality.  Have you seen anyone with such a huge assortment of scrapbook supplies.  Who needs that much paper and embellishments?  The prosecution is going to prove that Ms. DM is not a victim, but an impractaholic.  We are going to back this up with hard, cold evidence.”  -----Original Message----- From: DM Sent: Sunday, May 09, 2004 1:56 PM To: Keem Subject: I call my first witness (dun dun duh)...Beth.  Your Honor, may I have permission to treat Ms. Beth as a hostile witness?  Beth approached the witness stand cautiously.  She couldn’t lie in a court of law, not even to save a friend.  What was she going to do?  She had been horrified when she had received the subpoena to testify against DM.  She reached the chair and sat down.  The bailiff came at her with a bible.  “Do you swear to tell the truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God?”  “Yes, yes, I do.”  The smarmy Prosecution lawyer approached Beth.  “Ms. Beth, you are here under duress, is that correct?”  “Yes,” Beth responded.  “DM is being persecuted.  This country was built on the ideals that all people should be treated equally and yet, just because someone is a tiny bit impractical, you take them to court?  What is this?  Our founding fathers would be stunned!”  The courtroom was filled with the buzzing of people who have finally heard the truth but don’t know what to do with it.  The Judge slammed his gavel down.  “Order, order in the court!  Ms. Beth, we don’t need any of your stinking rhetoric.  That’s what’s wrong with our great country, the bleeding heart liberals with their ‘I’m not Impractical but I know someone who is’ ideology.”   The Prosecutor smiled coldly.  “Actually, your Honor, Ms. Beth is certainly entitled to her say in court.  I’d like to continue in this vein, if I could.”   The Judge frowned.  “I’ll allow it but no more about the founding fathers!  Haven’t the founding fathers suffered enough?”   “Ms. Beth,” The Prosecutor said.  “What is your relationship with Ms. DM?”   “Why, we’re friends,” Beth said, puzzled that the question was so easy.   “Oh, are you?”  The Prosecutor chuckled to herself.  “I find that to be odd.  Certainly you, of all people, must see the oddness of this pairing.”  “What do you mean?”  Beth asked.  The Judge slammed his gavel again.   “Young lady, answer the question!”   Malcolm sprung to his feet.  “I object!  Your Honor, my esteemed colleague never asked a question!  Ms. Beth can’t answer that!”   The Prosecutor was shaken by Malcolm’s cleverness (or perhaps it was his extremely brilliant smile or faint English accent).  “Your Honor, I’ll rephrase.”  She turned back to Beth.  “Ms. Beth, don’t you feel there is something odd about claiming to be friends with Ms. DM?”  “No.”  The Judge exploded angrily!  “I’ll not have this type of goings on in my courtroom!  What kind of answer is that?”  He glared at Beth.  “Well, answer me!”  “Well, I apologize, Your Honor, I can see why you would be frustrated but I would like to point out that the Prosecutor did ask a closed-ended question.  By phrasing the question in this manner, she made it possible for me to answer either yes or no.”  Beth exchanged a brief smile with DM.  “Perhaps, if the Prosecutor would have read her disclosures…I mean law texts…she would have asked me an open-ended question, one that would force me to answer in a much more expansive manner.”

      Beth has left a comment for me and she poses a good point.  Her comment to  urlLink Not A Simeks  is about the fact that I called her sarcastic.  She questions my calling her sarcastic when I joke about the fact that she is physically incapable of being sarcastic.  Do you know what the problem is with having friends who never forget anything you say?  Well, actually, the problem is that they never forget anything I say.    The reason I say that Beth is incapable of being sarcastic is because at the bank we work at, let's just call it The Bank of DM, we are trained on how to talk to customers.  So, when you call us, instead of us saying something like "Account number" when we answer the phone, we will actually greet you with a pleasant voice and say our names and ask how we can help you.  We learn how to be polite and courteous instead of rude and irritating.  This is ingrained into our systems.  We will start answering our home phones with "Thank you for calling DM, this is DM, how may I help you?"  We will ask our friends if they would be willing to pass the penny (I'll explain later) or if they are upset about something, we will say something like this "I understand why this would be upsetting to you and would be happy to assist you with this situation."  I have done this to a cat - "I understand why you enjoy sitting in my chair, however, I have had a hard day at work and would like to sit down.  Would you be willing to move for me?  Thank you.  I appreciate your cooperation."    So here is an example of Beth talking to someone who is annoying her and she wants them to shut up.  Person  "My back hurts.  I slept on it wrong and it really is upsetting me and everything in this world is all your fault and my parents didn't love me enough as a child and I am a victim and all eyes should be focused on me because I am so wonderful and do you mind if I ignore you to concentrate on all my other friends?" (Okay, this is just an exaggeration, this is not a real person so if you think it's you, you're wrong.  Of course, if you think it's you, maybe you should try to stop being so annoying and actually spend some time with your friends, you jerk.)  Beth  "Ohhhh, I am soooo sooorry that your back hurts.  That must be very painful.  Is there anything I can do for you?"  DM to herself  "Hmm, this person annoys me.  Why is Beth talking to them in this sweet voice?  Why doesn't she punch them like I would?"  So one day I ask her about this, why does she respond like this when I know she's really upset that these people treat her this way?  Do you know what she tells me?  She says she's being sarcastic.  I have to tell her honestly that this is no form of sarcasm that I've ever heard before.  Then it hits me.  What she's doing is mocking these people and pretending that she cares about their massive amount of complaining.  Unfortunately, what would sound as phony sweetness with everyone else just sounds like she cares.    I would like to point out to Beth that to me, someone who is completely illogical, when she uses logic with me, I take it as sarcasm.  Which means that everything she says to me sounds sarcastic.    Beth's blog is  urlLink here .  It should be interesting to see her side of things.

      Went to see  urlLink this  today with Keem and Katie (work friend who left the phone bank and now works in another area of the Bank of DM.  Dang her).    We went to went to  urlLink Damon's  for lunch before meeting Katie.  We decided to do the 2 for $25 deal and I got the Apple-Bourbon chicken.  Not bad but I wish I would have gone for the ribs like Keem did.  We had fun playing trivia on the NTN games.    When we were walking into the theater, Keem asked if I had remembered to turn off my phone.  I said no.  My reasoning was "What if Katie calls us to tell us that she is dead and can't make it?"  But Katie arrived safe and sound!  Yay!  The movie was good, it moved fairly fast and kept my attention.  I know that some people are going to tell you that it sucked and some people are going to say it is great.  I will tell you that I liked it, not enough to go back to see it again in the theater but I will probably buy it on DVD.  I can watch movies so much better when they are on DVD, not because I prefer a small screen but because the DVD usually has subtitles.    For some reason, subtitles help me hear better.  Usually when I watch a movie without subtitles, I miss things, like names or sometimes whole bits of dialougue.  And Heaven help us if the person has an accent.  Since the 3 main characters of Around the World are English, French and Chinese, I was lost in a few places.  I didn't feel like I was missing anything, though, because there was a lot of action to keep me satisfied.  Okay, must go to bed.  I work at 5:30 AM.  Yuck.

      When I was in high school, I had 3 favorite cars.  I was someday going to be rich and own the following cars:  An  urlLink Orange Corvette  with green interior.  I planned on calling it the Pumkinmobile.  Yes, yes, I know.  I wonder about myself sometimes too...  A blue  urlLink Chevy convertible .  I didn't care about what year it was, I just wanted chrome.  Then I wanted a black van with a rainbow painted on the side.    This was pretty ambitious for someone who has never held a driver's license.  Someday, someday I will have one and then, in celebration of the miracle, all my friends and family will purchase me my very own El Camino!  Yes, that's right.  I said El Camino.  I love them.  I can't remember where I saw my first one but I have thought they are adorable for the longest time.  For fun, I like to go to Google images and type in El Camino and then just drool.  This  urlLink one  is my favorite out of my last search.  What is my fascination with the color orange?  And sometimes, I do a search on eBay Motors for that perfect car.  Of course, I can only afford about 300 bucks so it's going to be difficult to find one that runs.  But I can dream, right?

      I love my mother.  I really do.  She raised Kari and I on her own since I was 13 with very little financial support from my father.  She's a wonderful woman who is loves God, her children, her grandson and her dogs.  I adore her.  Really.  I just feel that she doesn't understand me.  Or I don't understand her.  One of the two.  Maybe both.  Her reaction to my tattoos and piercings - "Some day you're going to be old, sitting in the doctor's office and really embarrassed about your tattoos!"  What I hate about this is that she was right, my doctor thought I had pneumonia and asked another doctor to come in and listen to me breathe.  There I sat, flimsy paper robe wide-open, chest bared to the world, tattoos and nipple rings exposed.  I never had a problem with my doctor; I had a rapport with her.  I didn’t know this guy from Adam.    We don't like the same music.  When she was visiting when Josh was born, she wanted me to go see  urlLink Good Boy  with her.  I wasn't interested.  Of course, now I'm feeling guilty because I dragged her to see the 1st  urlLink Austin Powers  movie and she hated it.  Okay, Mom, when you're here again, you get to pick the movie.    We certainly don't like the same music.  Back in the 80's, when the 3 of us were getting ready for work/school and fighting over who got to use the one extremely small bathroom next, my mother would listen to religious music while she got ready.  Now, I liked the hymns and I adore gospel but this isn't all she would play.  One morning it was this annoying woman singing about the  urlLink 10 Commandments .  I'm serious.  It was horrible.  And then she would leave for work and my sister would take over with The Suicidal Tendencies "I saw your mommy and your mommy was dead."  (And people wonder why I'm so warped).    This is a woman who told me that the music I listened to was terrible, grabbed the radio and changed to the non-religious station she preferred (W-Lite for those Minnesotans reading this.  I was listening to KS-95) and then, when the exact same song was playing, said, "That's better."  Now granted, I was a teenager and there is a law that says mothers and teenage daughters must fight about everything but  it was the same song!    This is a woman who told me a former friend needed to go to therapy.  When I replied, "Mom, you say that about all of my friends."  Her answer?  "Well, she just needs it more than everyone else."  Granted, she was right and I'm no longer friends with this person but needless to say, she didn't approve of most of my friends growing up (of course, some of these friends got me involved in drugs and alcohol so maybe she had a point).    So, because of this, I've decided to divide my links up into two categories.  Links that my mother is allowed to click on and links that she is not allowed to click on.  Beth saw that and is wondering if she is too goody-goody and this is my response to her.  Please.  You've heard the stories about my mother.  Remember the three-page email about how I should go to church.  Do you really want to imagine my Mom's reaction if she clicks on Matt's blog?  I can...it goes like this.  Dana's Mom:  "Oh, what's this link here?  Let me click it.  AAAAARRRRRGGGGHHHHH!"  Thump.  Then there would be the phone call to Kari where I have to explain why I killed our mother.  I don't want to deal with that.  Plus, I'm planning on adding a few other blogs and sites that I love but I don't think Mom would either a) like, b) understand or c) keep me in the will.  So, Mom, for your own protection and to keep Kari from coming after me with the chainsaw, please stay away from the non-Mother approved links!  If you go there, I cannot be held responsible.  Pretty much that goes for everyone, actually, if you click a link and don't like it, well, that's too bad.  I have an odd sense of humor and an extremely eclectic love of the written word.  And I, like the Bank of DM, pride myself on my diversity.

      There's another ad from the marketing geniuses at Rainbow Foods that disturbs me even more than the loaves of bread one.  This was a full page, color ad in the Saint Paul newspaper.    Now we've established that RF thinks that vegetables and fruits are people, right (why is it that every time I say that, I think of  urlLink Soylent Green , "It's people!")?  Now imagine if you will, my horror upon gazing at this carrot that has eyes and is smiling at another odd fruit/vegetable creature.  Is it the fact that she has eyes that bothers me so?  No.  What really gets to me is that...  She is wearing a pea necklace.  Yes, they have taken a pod of peas, broken them open and made a necklace out of them.  So what RF is now saying is that these fruit/vegetable characters are now alive, they are also cannibalizing each other to make necklaces and earrings (fashioned out of onions).  This goes beyond wearing fur, people.  When you start wearing your neighbor as a fashion accessory, then there's a problem.

      I was trying to find a website for Rainbow Foods because really, the only way anyone is going to appreciate this is if I could provide you with a picture.  Unfortunately, I can't find one.  If anyone does come up with a link, please let me know.  Okay, so, I live in Minnesota and there is a grocery store here called Rainbow Foods.  Well, lately, I have decided that the powers that be at RF are all on crack.  Why, you ask?  Their new radio ads are, I swear, 3 minutes long.  They are trying to do some sort of beatnik poem, the soft jazzy music is playing in the background.  Now, poetry is very important to me.  It helped me keep my sanity for many years.  I do not want to hear poetry about someone going shopping.  This is not fun.  I'm going to see if I can write down part of the ad the next time I hear it.  If I haven't thrown my radio out the window first.  The radio ads are annoying but they do not set me off like the billboards.  Picture this, if you will, you are driving (riding) down the highway.  Your eyes are drawn to the billboard because it is brightly colored and shiny.  You stare at it in terror.  Oh, my God, it's a giant tomato (I hate tomatoes.  They are evil and too red and smushy.  And, Mom, I don't care that I ate them up until I was 5.  5 years liking tomatoes, 32 years hating them.  I win)!  So the powers that be at RF have decided "Hey, wouldn't it be fun to give fruits and vegetables faces and then pose them?"  No, no, it wouldn't be fun.  It is sick and wrong.  Don't play with your food.    Beth and I are driving down the highway from somewhere, possibly Big 10, she is talking on the phone and then I see it.  3 loaves of bread...with faces...with the stupid quote "We're so fresh the other guys are toast."  Now the thing that gets to me the most (and I'm sure this is much more rational then when I went on this 10 minute vant to Beth.  Poor Beth.  I think she wanted to have me committed) is that one of these loaves is a loaf of French bread.  French bread is fairly recognizable, right?  Well, obviously the advertising geniuses don't think so because they have taken another piece of bread, a darker brown, and fashioned it into the shape of a beret.  So apparently, dear readers, RF execs think we are stupid.   Here's the one thing I don't think they had in mind.  As we are riding by and these loaves of bread are leering down at us, it hits me what the beret-wearing loaf of French Bread looks like.    Yes.  It looks like a penis.  I've heard the company might be in trouble.  Maybe RF figures subliminal messages are best to encourage us to shop.  "Come to Rainbow, buy some phallic shaped bread.  Your life will be great from now on!"  It would be so much better if you could see these ads.  You'd understand then.  There's one of this potato with these huge teeth.  It gives me nightmares.

      I enjoyed this email, even though I seem to get it sent once a year.  Here are my favorite 10 quotes.  The hardest years in life are those between ten and seventy. - Helen Hayes (at 73)  I refuse to think of them as chin hairs.  I think of them as stray eyebrows. - Janette Barber  My second favorite household chore is ironing. My first being, hitting my head on the top bunk bed until I faint. - Erma Bombeck  The phrase “working mother” is redundant. - Jane Sellman   If you can’t be a good example, then you’ll just have to be a horrible warning. - Catherine  When I was young, I was put in a school for retarded kids for two years before they realized I actually had a hearing loss. And they called ME slow! - Kathy Buckley   If high heels were so wonderful, men would still be wearing them. - Sue Grafton  I am a marvelous housekeeper.  Every time I leave a man I keep his house. - Zsa Zsa Gabor   Nobody can make you feel inferior without your permission. - Eleanor Roosevelt  Every time I close the door on reality it comes in through the windows. - Jennifer Unlimited  Bonus quote:   I try to take one day at a time, but sometimes several days attack me at once. - Jennifer Unlimited

      Last night I was reading a blog by  urlLink lbg  and came across something I found very disturbing.  Someone leaves a comment that reads "Your blog sucks!"  What the hell is that?  How is that mature?    I said in an earlier  urlLink post  that I'm a fairly mellow person and I was raised to follow the Golden Rule - "Do Unto Others As You Would Have Done Unto You (or whatever version you've might have heard)."  So when I am reading a blog that I don't agree with, do I leave a nasty comment about how wrong the person is?  No, I don't.  I just go onto the next one.  I really enjoy the fact that people all over this world are different.  I can accept diversity.  I also enjoy thought-provoking debates in which people can present their opinion to their opponent and ask that it be considered.  Here's the thing, people.  Everything I put on this site is my opinion.  Opinion, from  urlLink dictionary.com  (oh, I love that site) reads as follows:  o·pin·ion    noun  1.  A belief or conclusion held with confidence but not substantiated by positive knowledge or proof: “The world is not run by thought, nor by imagination, but by opinion” (Elizabeth Drew).  2.  A judgment based on special knowledge and given by an expert: a medical opinion.  3.  A judgment or estimation of the merit of a person or thing: has a low opinion of braggarts.  4.  The prevailing view: public opinion.  5.  Law. A formal statement by a court or other adjudicative body of the legal reasons and principles for the conclusions of the court.   So, if you don't like my opinions, I'm sorry, but I'm not going to change to suit you.  The same goes if I'm on someone's site and I don't like something they said.  Maybe if people show some respect for one another, we wouldn't have all of these damn hate crimes.    That said, have a nice day.

      Well, I can honestly say I have my mother to thank for the choosing of CarpeDM.  Other than the fact that she named my Dana Marie, right?  For some reason, she would complain bitterly about my other email/screen names.    The first one was troubledvixen - okay, a bit odd, maybe, but this one came about at a job I had at a department store.  One of my co-workers and I had anonymously posted a letter of complaint in the break room about our evil supervisor neglecting her job for months and suddenly coming to us in a meeting and saying "Oh, by the way, even though there hasn't been any disciplinary action taken in the last 3 months, well, we're still watching your cash drawer shortages and hey, you could lose your job tomorrow if you make one more mistake."  He was pulled into the office by the aforementioned evil supervisor and her boss and the ES told him "I know it was you.  You and that troubled vixen you hang out with."  Mom didn't like it.  She was embarrassed to include me in her group emails.    Okay, Mom, I'll change it.  The next one was badbadkittygirl.  This was the result of my friend Annie yelling at her cat, Nala.  "Nala, you are a bad girl.  You are a bad, bad kitty girl."  I thought it was hilarious and decided to try it as an email/screen name.  Mom didn't like it because she could never type it in correctly.  And, I was also running into problems because any time I went into a chat room, I would be attacked by extremely horny men who would try to get me to hook up with them.  I am not a feline dominatrix!    So then, I went with fruitfly.  Fairly easy, simple, right?  This was a nickname one of my friends gave me in email.   Friend - "You're a fruit fly." DM - "What the heck is a fruit fly?"  Friend - "You buzz around gay boys."  (Granted, this was back when I'd hit the gay bars with him.  I'm too old to club now, especially since I quit drinking) Okay, I accept the title, I hate the term faghag.  Another friend told me I was a flame dame but I think that title belongs to Beth, she's a lot classier than I am.  Mom, who is relatively open minded, thought that people on her mailing list were more conservative than her and might not like it.  My response, why do I care?  And how do they know what it means?  Maybe I just like apples, did you ever think of that?  To appease the Royal Momness, I decided to go with carpeDM.  She was okay with that.  But she doesn't know that secretly I am thinking "Don't seize the day, seize the Dana Marie!"  Mwahahahaha!   Update - I get an email from Mom at work.  "Have you changed your email address?  I can't get anything through to you."  I'll have to connect with her to find out what's going on...I certainly don't want to change the email address again!  Although, I wonder what I could come up with this time.

      So, those of you who read my post on June 9th, might remember how excited I was to watch LCS this week, right?  I was looking forward to seeing how my favorites did.  Yeah, well, I'm ticked off now.  Tuesday night, I am settled onto the couch, having been smart enough to go to the bathroom before the show started, I am avidly waiting for laughter and joy to invade my living room.  And it did.    Here were the people I liked (if I could find a home page for them, I linked it): Jessica Kirshon, who is insane but very funny.    urlLink Gary Gulman  - Tall, dark, handsome and hilarious.  Mmm, Dana like.  urlLink Kathleen Madigan  - Love her.  Her gymnastic jokes were great. Monty Hoffman - Very dry sense of humor.  Which I love.  urlLink Dan Ahdoot  - The whole comedy calendar?  I wanted more.   Unfortunately, only Kathleen and Gary made it to the house.  The plus side, Ant made it, Keem likes him.  And he is very funny, I just like Dan Ahdoot and Monty more.  I am not happy about:   Corey Holcomb or Bonnie McFarlane - I don't think they are that funny.  Wednesday night is what made me mad.  Here are the people I was rooting for:  urlLink John Heffron  - I have no words, only laughter.  urlLink Dan Naturman  - Looks like I'm not the only one who likes him, he did get a standing ovation from the audience and the celebrity judges. Jay London - The one liner king.  Just helpless laughter.  urlLink Tammy Pescatelli  - I think she's funny and I feel bad about her Dad being sick.  She wasn't her best on Wednesday.  urlLink Alonzo Bodden  - Like Gary, Alonzo is tall, dark, handsome and hilarious.  Mmm, Dana like him as well!  Okay, I got 4 out of 6 of the comics I wanted into the house but I am so pissed about Dan Naturman.  He was great.  I know the only reason Todd Glass "won" is because the producers are trying to come up with drama for the house.  Todd Glass is extremely annoying and I'm waiting for someone to punch him.  And as much as I like Tammy, Jim Wiggins deserved to go onto the house (Keem and I were sad when he didn't make it last week so we were excited to see him be called in last minute).  I am still looking forward to next week, just because I hope Bonnie McFarlane and Todd Glass get kicked out quickly.

      Do you know what I've had for the last two days for lunch?  I'll tell you.  Cold Tater Tot Hotdish (Yes, I am Midwestern.  And it's pop, not soda).  Do you know why it's cold?  Because if I walk to break room and heat up my lunch, that is at least 10 minutes that I could be blogging or reading other blogs.  I only get a 1/2 hour for lunch, why would I waste my time on a microwave?  Tomorrow, Keem and I are going to the Bank of DM for overtime.  Keem works a full day.  I will work 4 hours.  Why not work the full day?  Because I can spend the time I'm not on the phone on the computer in our resource room.  At home, I am at the mercy of the dial-up service.  At work, it's DSL, baby.  Yes, everyone I work with thinks I'm insane.    But you know, I just don't care.  I have had a lot of fun, not only writing my adventures but also reading some very interesting blogs as well.  It's a beautiful and diverse world we live in and there are a lot of great characters in it as well.

      That's a good question and I'd be happy to help you with that.    Yes.  I admit it.  I am a 37 year old woman who sleeps with a stuffed animal.  Go ahead.  Mock me.  I also have Chips Ahoy sheets (I can't use them because they turn my skin blue but they're really cool).  The stuffed animal du jour is named "Hippo" and he (all my stuffed animals are males) is a hippo made out of this really soft terry cloth and is very comfortable.  He isn't your usual gray hippo, he is more brown.  And he has a very pretty giraffe patterned ribbon tied around his neck.    Hippo received his name because once upon a time, there was a glorious Greek God of a man named Michael.  Michael's last name was quite long and a disturbed individual I tolerated only because she was dating a friend of mine thought it was Hippotomous.  So, while I was hiding my deep and abiding lust for Michael from him (yeah, like he didn't know.  Every time he walked by I would sigh deeply), my friends and I would refer to him as Hippo.  So, even after Michael left the Bank of DM and moved on to better things, I still adored him and needed something to remind me of him.  On a Sheepsheadian trip to Duluth, I found Hippo and liberated him from a  urlLink Kaybee Toys store .  Hippo recently went to Las Vegas with Beth and I.  We had a great time there and there's an excellent picture of Hippo playing cards with Beth's stuffed monkey, Elwood.  If I ever learn how to download pictures, I will post the picture.  The oldest stuffed animal I own is named Panda (okay, most of my animals have really creative names...I just don't remember them).  He was a gift from my grandmother for Christmas when I was seven and I still have him, I just can't sleep with him anymore because he has been through a lot and is in pretty rough shape.

      I like to think that I am a rational person.  I try very hard not to lose my temper, I remain calm during stress (mainly because I'm probably reading and don't want to be bothered), I don't shout at random drivers and shake my fist impotently at them (no, I leave that for Keem), all in all, I think you will find that yes, DM is very rational and mature.    However, like most saints, there are a few things that can set me off on vehement vanting (a cross between vent and rant) and, proving once again that I only think of my adoring public, I have decided to share vant number 1.  The one thing that makes me want to scream at the top of my lungs and stab people with forks (Please notice I said want to stab people with forks.  I have not yet done so.  (That's because Beth keeps taking them away.))  So I take an escalted call today from one of the Bank of DM bankers.  The banker tried to get some information from the customer (TC) but TC refused to tell them anything about why he was calling or what his name was (When the banker asked him his name, TC replied "It's unimportant."  So the banker told him "Mr. Unimportant, I'll transfer you to a supervisor now (Classic!  So wrong from a quality and customer service level but yet, makes me feel good).  One moment please.")   DM - "Thank you for holding, sir, my name is Dana.  How may I help you?"  Customer - "I was driving through a city and I saw a Gay Pride event.  ( DM cringes, she knows what is coming next and, because she does really like her job, she cannot tell the customer what she is really thinking )  Your bank had a delegation there.  Why do you feel you need to be involved with that rubbish?"  DM - "Well, sir, The Bank of DM prides ( yes, I said "prides" deliberately.  I  am evil, I know it ) itself on its diversity..."  Customer (cutting her off) - "I just want you to know I will be closing my accounts because of your diversity."  DM - "You're certainly within your rights..."  Customer (cutting her off  again ) - "Yes, I am.  I am within my rights to be a completely narrow-minded boob who thinks that anyone who is not like me is obviously either Satan or a Communist.  Long live White Power."  Then he hung up.  Okay, obviously he didn't say the last part.  But that's it, folks, that's what drives me insane.  I am so sick and tired of prejudice, loyal readers.  See, my parents, as odd as they both are/were, raised me to believe that everyone should be treated equally, that you shouldn't judge people based on skin color or relgious beliefs or sexual preference.  You should just accept people for who they are.  My Dad went as far as to tell me, when I was researching my nationality for a class project, that I was part Polish, part Black and part jackass (the jackass was from my mother's side.  Dad was weird, okay?)  It wasn't until after he died that I found out he had told my half-brothers and sisters that they were part Italian (the reason they liked spaghetti so much) and American Indian).  The whole point to this is he didn't want me to be a bigot.  And you know what?  It worked.  I love everybody, until you (and that's you as a person, not as a gender or race or a minority group) piss me off.       Those of you who want to quote the bible at me, for your information, I am a born again Christian.  And my answer to you will be, Jesus died on the cross for my sins and yours.  He didn't look down from that cross and say "Okay, today I am only forgiving the sins of all of the white, upper class, heterosexual Americans.  But you minority groups had better watch out."    Now, I love my country and I am glad I was born in America where I and everyone has the right of free speech and so I can accept that everyone has the right to their own opinion.  But you know what, that right doesn't mean you get to try and force your opinion down my throat, okay?  I personally don't feel that either the Boy Scouts or The Salvation Army should have the right to discriminate against homosexuals but I don't call them up and tell them what they can and can't do.  I just don't support them.  And I don't vote for Republicans.  As I said in a previous post, I have 5 male friends.  They are all gay.  I have 3 female friends.  We are all straight.  And you know what, we all love each and are good to each other and have a great time when we are together.  And we're always looking out for new friends.  So maybe someday we'll meet.    But I'm going to tell you, you make one comment about my friends and I'm bringing out the tazer.  Unless Beth has hidden it.

      We watched "Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil" last night.  I'm thinking I may have to read the book.  Oh, Peter Facinelli is in the Scorpion King (which is also really good and no, it's not just because of The Rock...)  Connect the tracks of Dana's mind...  1.      We watched "Midnight" while scrapbooking. 2.      I first watched "Midnight" scrapbooking with you one night. 3.      Kevin Spacey is in "Midnight." 4.      Kevin Spacey is one of your favorite actors (Okay, if Kevin Spacey is one of your favorite actors and Rowan Atkinson is one of mine, how is it possible that we're friends?  That's so bizarre). 5.      Another Kevin Spacey movie I watched was "The Big Kahuna".  This movie has Peter Facinelli in it. 6.      Peter Facinelli looks somewhat like Tom Cruise.  This irritates me because I don't like Tom Cruise and haven't ever since Goose died in "Top Gun".  Although I stopped disliking him as much when I saw "Jerry Maquire" and "Minority Report". 7.      Another movie Peter Facinelli was in was "Can't Hardly Wait" and "Riding in Cars with Boys".  I have seen both of these movies.   8.      We watched "The Scorpion King" while scrapbooking.  Mmm, The Rock. 9.      Peter Facinelli is in "The Scorpion King".  Are you scared?  Because I am.  Even scarier?  That ran through my brain in about ten seconds...imagine what I could do if I used my powers for good instead of trivial.  Okay, time to work.  Ciao.

      I like music.  I especially enjoy listening to the radio when I'm grooving on the internet, mainly because it annoys me to have to change CD's.  And yes, I do have a 3 CD player, I just don't how to set it up.    I like most styles of music so it is very difficult for me to pick a favorite song.  I think most people are the same way.  It's really easy to say what your favorite book is or movie right off the top of your head but when you are talking about music, you usually start thinking "What style?"  I think right now, I would have to say that the song that comes to mind the most would be Change The World by Eric Clapton.  It is the first song I sing at karaoke, it has the genius that is Clapton on guitar (You should see me when I listen to his version of Danny Boy.  Yes, I cry), the unrequited love that states "If you would just notice me, what a great love we would have..." Without going into stalker territory.  If you haven't heard the song, it is in the movie  urlLink Phenomenon  (excellent movie), and I fell in love with it then.  It's been the top of the favorite list since 1996.  The lyrics here are not the way the song was written, it's the way I sing it.   Change The World  If I could reach the stars, I'd pull one down for you. Shine it on my heart so you could see the truth: That this love I have inside, is everything it seems. But for now I find, it's only in my dreams.  That I can change the world,  I will be the sunlight in your universe.  You would think my love was really something good,  Baby if I could change the world.   And if I could be queen, even for a day,  I'd take you as my king - I'd have it no other way.  And our love would rule in this kingdom we have made.  'Til then I'll be a fool, wishing for the day...   That I can change the world,  I would be the sunlight in your universe.  You would think my love was really something good,  Baby if I could change the world (twice).   If I could change the world,  I would be the sunlight in your universe.  You would think my love was really something good,  Baby if I could change the world (three times).

      Went to Karaoke on Sunday night with Beth.  The Chalet was pretty quiet which we love because that means we get to sing a lot!  We had a great time and got to listen to some excellent singers, including an 11 year old girl who sings better than me.  Which is sad but hey, at least I can admit it, right?  Well, faithful readers, the miracle has happened.  DM has actually had a romantic experience.  It was very moving.  Here's what happened.  We are at The Chalet.  After the incredibly talented 11 year old made Beth and I cry by singing Traveling Soldier by the Dixie Chicks, Big Wayne (the tallest man in the world (according to Bryan).  Big Wayne's height appears to change each week.  On Sunday he was 14 feet, well, again, according to Bryan.  It's amazing.  When we first started going to The Chalet he was only 7 feet tall) came up to sing one of my favorite songs, Unchained Melody.   This made me cry, yet again.  So I told him that if I ever get married (hahahaha), I would like him to sing this song at my wedding.  He agreed.  Later, when he came up to sing another song, Can't Help Falling In Love With You, which is another one of my favorite songs, I called out "What, are you trying to kill me? (meaning that I would probably cry.   Again.   You're shocked by this, aren't you?)"  So Big Wayne came down to our table, sat down and started singing to me.  When he got to the part of "Take my hand, take my whole life too," he reached out for me and there it was, folks, the most exciting encounter I have had in well, forever.  I actually held a heterosexual male's hand (5 male friends.  All gay.  Love them but hey, they're not helping my love life any).  I almost swooned.  It was quite touching (pun intended).      Then Monday, Beth called and asked if I would go shopping with her.  I agreed because I am, as we all know, the absolute best friend in the entire world.  We went to Roseville.  It was interesting.  Beth and I have completely different tastes in clothing but I did like everything she bought.  I have decided I have to lose weight just because there is such a difference in clothes styles between Petites and Plus Sizes.  For some reason, most designer's feel that I either want to dress like a slut or a grandmother.  There's no happy medium.  I personally feel that I really don't want to bare my midriff to the world, thank you very much.  Beth was able to find some really fun, funky clothes that didn't shout "Hey, I'm a hooker in my spare time."  Or, even worse, "I am a grandmother!"  Other than the woman at Victoria's Secret who, in essence, called me tacky, we had a great time (more detail is on Beth's blog, link is to the right).    "Well you know that it's going to be alright I think it's gonna be alright Everything will always be alright When we go shopping"  BareNaked Ladies - Shopping

      I was kind of thinking I would like to do something fun.  Like a question of the day.  Because, let's face it, I am hooked on blogging.  How come no one ever told me how fun this is?  I love blogger!  I feel, I can't even believe I am using this term, techno-savvy.  Okay, I added a guest book because I know there are people visiting who aren't blogger members and I'd like them to have the opportunity to comment.  Feel free to sign, I would love it.  I live for feedback.   "High maintenance?" she said, with a frown.  "No.  Just needy."   I also love checking out other sites so please, leave me your url and I'll be happy to visit.  One of the best features of blogger is being able to see the recently updated blogs.  I am thinking about adding a guest map, which, yes, I know is silly because I don't think I'll have that many visitors but I just want to try all of this new stuff!    So the question of the day is What is your favorite web site (besides your own)?  The one that you go to check out weekly, hoping something new has been added.  Mine is  urlLink Despair.com .  You know those posters businesses will put up to motivate their workers?  Well, this is the sarcastic version.  My favorites are  urlLink Motivation  and  urlLink Apathy .  My boss has threatened to fire me if I ever bring one to work.  I can kind of understand his point when you think about the fact that I work in a phone center.    Beth, you may or may not like the  urlLink limitations  one.  I'm pretty sure I've told you about it but hey, it could be a great birthday present for you, right?  I am going to die.

      Just because I'm Queen of the Universe doesn't mean I don't do dumb things.  I know, it is hard to believe that I could ever make a mistake but, yes, occasionally I do.  Here is a classic Tale of Dana.  I'm pretty sure I was either 9 or 11 so please, when you laugh, and you will, do not fall out of your chair.  It wasn't that funny and I was young.  To get an idea of how young I was, I had just lost a tooth that weekend because I ate a marathon bar (I miss those so much and, apparently, I'm not the only one.  Here's a  urlLink link  for a substitute).  So, my sister (Kari) and I are on a camping trip with the parents and friends of the parents.  We have gone for a walk through the park and are on our way back to the campsite when Dana sees something on the ground.  What could it be?  It is a fish hook which is attached to some fishing line.  How interesting (okay, not really but my Mom wouldn't let me bring any books along and I was bored.  I was supposed to embrace Nature that weekend)!  I immediately picked the fish hook up.  Now, there are two elements that lead up to what happened.    1)  I was bored 2) I am a Pisces 3) I have an overactive imagination (you would never guess, right?).  I decided it would be a scientific experiment to find out what it feels like to be a fish (this is where the Pisces part comes in).  So I took the fish hook and put it into my mouth.  Yes, I know.  I can sense my mother cringing as she thinks about all the germs that were on that hook  (And before anyone makes a comment about how is this scientific, I have mentioned repeatedly that I am not a logical person.  I lack common sense.  I make up for this lack by being ever so charming and imaginative).  The hook fit perfectly on the inside of my mouth.  I could feel the barbed end up against my lip.  There wasn't any pain and I could have easily taken the hook out of my mouth.  Operative words in that sentence were "I could have."  As I mentioned, the fish hook was attached to fishing line.  As I stood there, in the middle of the road with a fish hook in my mouth, I noticed that the end of the line had been made into a loop.  I remember that it was fastened with tiny orange beads.    "Hmm," I thought to myself.  "I wonder what would happen if I put my big toe inside of that loop."  I slid my toe inside the loop and stood there a moment, my foot angled ever so slightly.  "Hmm.  I wonder what would happen if I put my foot down."  Well, I'll tell you what happened.  Absolute pain!  The hook sliced through the fleshy part of my inner lip (I can't remember if it went all the way through, I'll have to ask Mom) and horrific pain radiated through my mouth.  I needed to find my Mom immediately and get her to fix this!  There was one little problem though, the fishing line loop was still attached to my big toe.  Kari tried to remove it but was unable to because every movement of the fishing line resulted in more pain.  What to do, what to do?    I have to wonder how my mother ever kept her sanity with me as a daughter.  How odd would it be to be sitting with all of your friends and seeing both of your daughters approach the campsite with tears running down their faces.  Your youngest daughter is in the lead and your oldest daughter (the one who should know better) seems to be hobbling, almost as if there was an invisible string pulling her right foot into the air.  And why is there blood coming from her mouth?  Needless to say, this day has gone down in ignominy for me.  Not only did my parents get to see just how daft I truly was, so did all of their friends.  Fortunately, one of my Dad's friends was a veterinarian and he was able to remove the hook from my mouth.  And, as if that was not embarrassing enough, I had to go to the doctor to get a tetanus shot.  I can still remember my Mom saying "Tell her, Dana" to the Nurse when she was asked why I needed the tetanus shot.  I can still remember the look of disbelief on the Nurse's face and then the laughter...Oh the echoing laughter.  It still haunts me to this day.  Okay, obviously not or else I wouldn't publish this.  This is all Keem's fault.  She reminded me of it today.   Update - dang that Brooksba (Beth to the uninitiated), she has left a post that reminds me, once again, that I should always edit before I post...apparently I have neglected to realize that there are 3 elements to what caused me to mar myself for life (yes, I still have the scar).  Of course, she would notice this because this is a woman who admits that she does algebra for fun.   For fun!   Does anyone else see how incredibly wrong that is?

      Last night I was going to go over and help Beth with packing, in preparation of the big move on Sunday.  I don't know what happened, if it was the fact that I didn't get a lot of sleep or if it was something I ate, but I ended up not going because I got sick.  Long story short, while I am still feeling nauseous, I'm not throwing up anymore and now I feel like crap for a completely other reason.    Beth has always been there for me.   Always.   Even if she is sick, even if it means driving from Fridley to Saint Paul to pick me up, even if it means borrowing me money because I screwed up my checkbook once again.  She has never been too busy for me or blown me off because she found cooler friends to hang out with or told people horrible lies because it's fun to make Dana cry.    I'm sorry, Beth.  I should have been there last night.  I will be there tonight.  It will not kill me to sleep on the floor, that's what ibuprofen is for.  And it's not like you didn't help me pack and move an entire apartment in 12 hours, in July, without air conditioning.    I don't think friends get much better than you and Keem.  I love you both.  Now maybe I can just prove it for once without being so concerned about myself.

       2:05 P M and the descent into insanity is continuing.  I have (thank you to One Good Thing) discovered a new site.  It is called  urlLink Candyboots.com  and it is home to the Weight Watcher cards circa 1974.  Not only do you have the frightening images that the cooking gurus at Weight Watchers came up with to showcase their food, you also have the charming prose of Wendy to describe what you're looking at.    I am snorting with laughter.  Eddy has opened one eye and closed it, letting me know that I am insane.  But you look at  urlLink this  and tell me you don't get it, that it doesn't make you almost spit your Diet Coke with Lime out all over the monitor.  Go on, I dare you.     3:39 PM.   I am bored.  Bored, bored, bored.  Yet still amused by everything I am reading.  I want to call Keem and tell her to lavish attention on me but she has gone to LaCrosse for the weekend.  And I do not have her cell phone number.    I am the worst friend in the world.  I bet Beth has Keem's cell phone number.  I am now reading 2 sites at the same time.  When One Good Thing has a link I will click it and then, while waiting for the computer to load, I will go to another site she has linked and read that one.  And if that person recommends a site, I will go to that one.  And so on and so on.  I think I am lost in the internet.  It's kind of fun.  I am now going to communicate with Keem telephatically.  Here goes.  Keem!  KEEEEEEEEEEM!  The kitties miss you!  They are crying for you pathetically!  Yes.  I fed them.  Yes.  I cleaned Bob's litter box.    I really need to get some sleep.   3:54 PM  - Remember to ask Beth about the roaches episode on X-Files.  She is my X-Files guru.    4:14 PM  - Oh, dear God in Heaven.   urlLink This  is so very wrong.  Wrong.  I am a Christian and this offends me in so many ways.  Let's preach some hatred and intolerance to children.  But Lambuel dress-up is kind of fun.

      I have now reached that state where, even though I am tired, I know I will not sleep.  I will drift aimlessly through the rest of the day, listening to Bob whine because A) I am not Keem and B) he wants to frolic in the hallway and I won't let him.    Eddy is lying on Keem's bed.  Each day, before we leave for work, Keem makes her bed (I don't understand this concept but hey, whatever floats your boat, right?) and every night, when we get back home, there are random amounts of cat toys on the bed.  Sometimes they are in a row.  There isn't any rhyme or reason to the cat toys, other than his favorite one seems to be the long white ferrety looking thing and the pink mouse with the exceptionally long tail.  Sometimes, while we are watching TV, you will hear him calling to her from the bedroom.  This pathetic yowling that somehow is supposed to encourage her to drop everything and rush to his side and attend to his urgent petting needs.  He's watching me now, as I type this.  He has that inscrutable cat look on his face, that look that says "I may look like I'm falling asleep but I know you are talking about me and how dare you sit at that computer because you are not Keem and I love Keem and I tolerate you even though I am supposed to technically be your cat and you can't do anything as well as Keem does."  Do you know why he loves her more than me?  Because she gives him wet cat food.  Yep.  That's it.  Wet cat food is how you win my cat's heart.  Now, of course, when he throws it up, you would think that she would be the one that cleans it up, right?  And I respond with NO!  Well, actually she does more often than I but that's not the point.     The point is that the cats like Keem better than me and that is not fair.

      Yes.  I am still awake.  I will be taking a break from my exciting day of surfing the internet and go and find something to eat.    Meanwhile, I just thought I would let you all know that my cat is insane.  I am reading more entertaining stories from One Good Thing and I hear this strange scratching noise.  Hmm, what is that?  Here, Eddy has, deliberately, jumped from the back of the chair into the laundry basket (it's one of those deep baskets on wheels that can also be used as a grocery cart).  Now, this is normal cat behavior, right?  I'm sure he and Bob (Keem's cat) have discussions on the cool places to hide in the apartment daily.    No, what is odd here is that he makes these skritching noises, I glance over at the cart and then he slowly rises up in the cart to look at me and then, slowly lowers himself back down.  My cat is playing peekaboo.  Okay, maybe that's not so odd but I am functioning on approximately 4 hours of sleep.  I am easily amused.

      If you are are a member of my family and witnessed the infamous day now entitled  urlLink The Fish Hook Saga  or a friend of mine who has given into my entreaties to "Please, please, please read my blog!," you are aware of the fact that, occasionally, my brain completely ceases all function and my body carries on and does whatever the heck it wants.  This is not something that started recently.  It cannot be termed a senior moment (because, damn it, I'm only 37.  I am not that old).  This is something that has been happening since I was five.  Yes.  Five (5).    So Mom has brought me to the Babysitter.  The Babysitter (I wish I remembered her name.  I loved her.  I hated her annoying son, though) is watching me alternately entertain myself by reading (as much as I'd love to say it was Shakespeare, I didn't actually pick him until I was 12) and watching televison.  Probably Electric Company.  Does anyone remember Electric Company?  It was so cool.  Okay, back on tangent.  The Babysitter glances at me, I am engrossed in whatever I am doing and she says "Dana, I am going to go to the bathroom.  Please stay where you are."  I look at her blankly, the look that I normally get when interrupted from reading and agree.  Babysitter leaves the room.  I hear the bathroom door shut.  Suddenly, I am  urlLink galvanized  into action and decide to wander around the room.  I vaguely remember looking at the bookshelf and staring at it in fascination.  Then I found myself standing in front of Mr. Babysitter's desk.  On his desk is a large stapler.  Hmm.  This stapler has a gap between stapler part A and stapler part B (no I don't know their names but please, who hasn't seen a stapler) that is the perfect size for me to put my five-year-old (right) thumb.  I do so.  Then, obviously possessed by demons, I reach out with my left hand and hit stapler part A.  Which results in a sharp two-pronged pointy thing becoming imbedded in my thumb.    I don't remember screaming.  I just remember Babysitter coming back into the room and asking me what I was doing.  I turned to her, tears rolling down my face, and held my thumb out to her.  "Oh My God!"  She screams.  "What were you thinking?"  "What were you thinking?"  This question has followed me throughout my life.  And the answer is, of course, "Well, duh.  I wasn't."  I don't know what made me think of this.  Oh, thumb emerged unscathed.  In case you were wondering.

      It is 10:25 AM.  I am still awake (obviously).  But that's okay.  I am reading  urlLink One Good Thing  archives and truly enjoying myself.  I've made it through August, 2003 and it is so much fun to read her adventures in parenting and her business.    I have mentioned that I love the blogger.com world before.  I have "met" so many interesting people through this experience and only wish I would have discovered it before.  It's a great way for my friends to share our experiences and, in Matt's case, extreme insanity with each other but also a lot of fun for me to find new things.  And then babble about it to my friends at 2 in the morning.  Anyway, that's it.  I'm sure I'll be back later, maybe after I find some more cool links to play with.  Ciao.

      It is 9 AM on Friday.  I don't work on Fridays.  I don't have overtime today.  I should be curled up in bed with Hippo and Eddy (cat.  My cat.  Who thinks he belongs to Keem).  Especially since I didn't get home until 4 AM.  And I've been up for an hour.    An up note.  All this glorious awakeness (yes, I am being sarcastic) has allowed me to finish The DaVinci Code.  Which is the reason I am awake right now.  Because I was having a stupid dream in which I was being chased by nameless monks who wanted me to either forge a painting for them or smuggle the painting.  I'm not sure.  And Michael Flately was there and we kept being discovered because he couldn't stop doing the stupid River Dance.  Yes.  I am serious.  Trying to sneak through Customs and he decides to perform for the masses.  Is it any wonder that I grabbed the security guard's gun and shot him?  While speaking perfect French?   Update, Matt called and I remembered what the subtitles said when I shot Flately "Michael.  You bastard.  You must die."  Of course, when I'm telling Matt, I do this weird cross between Ahnold and Abba.  "Mykile.  You bahstad.  You must dah."   I am blaming Beth and Matt for this dream.  Beth because she let me read The DaVinci Code and Matt for his last post.  Although Beth, being logical, will tell me that I can't blame her for my dream, it is obviously the result of an overactive imagination.  And to that I reply, "Fine.  Then it's Dan Brown's fault."  Please, God, just hit me over the head with something heavy.  Then, maybe, I'll sleep.

      So Kari tells me last night that she was talking to her doctor about the precious screaming child that is my nephew and she expressed concern about eyesight.  While Kari does need glasses or contacts, her vision is not that bad.  Eric's eyesight is perfect.  But Kari is concerned that Josh may inherit my bad eyesight (without glasses, I can't read anything further away than six inches.  And it's really, really blurry).  The doctor told her it wasn't just about heredity, environment is a factor as well.  Here it turns out that the fact that I am an avid reader has contributed to my poor eyesight.  Does that just suck or what?  I guess it does make sense, even when Mom wouldn't let me bring a book to the table, I would start reading the cereal box out of desperation.  May I say how much I love being an adult?  That's just sad.  I'm excited about being able to read wherever I want.  Speaking of words - here's a cool website.   urlLink www.etymologic.com  - Ever thought you knew a lot about where word meanings come from?  I did.  And I have been proven terribly, terribly wrong.

      Babies.  They are small and fragile and make a lot of noise.    Josh doesn't know me very well because I don't drive and so, I don't get to see him very often.  Today is Kari's birthday (Happy b-day, little sister!) and the husband and her decided to leave their only child in my hands while they went out to eat.    It was horrible.  He started crying five minutes after they walked out the door...no, strike that.  He started screaming.  Loud "You are torturing me and I will be in therapy for life" screams.  I finally get him to calm down, well, actually Keem did.  And she did so much.  She walked into the room, he looked at her and must have thought "Oh, look, there's a complete stranger.  I love her so much more than my aunt," and calmed down.  Then, when she left to do laundry, he started screaming again.  The kid is seriously giving me a complex.  But, hey, reconfirming my belief that I am just not mother material.  I can't wait until he's six.  I look forward to having long discussions about the merits of Shakespeare.

      Quick update because God knows, I need to go to bed.    Corey Holcomb completely ticked me off tonight.  When they are discussing the roommate situation, he talks about how he is rooming with Ant, who happens to be gay.  So Corey mentions how he doesn't like the fact that Ant is looking at him.  And he says he'll be sleeping with a golf club.  Now, maybe he was trying to be funny but Ant said it himself, Corey is a homophobe.  Well, Mr. Holcomb, I have to tell you that you probably don't have anything to worry about.  I really can't see Ant trying to make his way into your bed.  You're not good looking, you're not that funny and, you know what, just because a man is gay, doesn't mean he automatically wants to sleep with you.  Okay, okay, calming down.    Todd Glass really annoys me.  I hope he goes soon but Tammy Pescatelli has a great point - he is too strong.  Then she went on this whole Sicillian thing about you winnow out the people around him...a little scary but probably very true.  Bonnie is gone.  She decided to challenge John Heffron.  This was a huge mistake because he is absolutely hilarious and her best joke is about anorexia...which, hey, really isn't that funny.  The final vote was either 94% - 6% or 95% - 5%, Keem and I couldn't agree.  Anyway, that's all for tonight.  I am still fuming that Dan Naturman didn't make it to the house because the man is brilliant and so outclasses Todd Glass and Corey Holcomb.  I will probably get over it eventually.    Good night, all.

      Beth and I had a discussion the other day about art.  We were reminiscing about our visit to Las Vegas and viewing the Monet exhibit.  It was the first time I got what "Impressionist" meant.  If you've never seen an impressionist painting up close, you won't truly understand it either.  When you stand two inches away from the canvas and actually see the intricate brush strokes and realize that you're not actually looking a painting of a  urlLink tree  or a  urlLink woman  or a  urlLink cathedral , you are looking at a bunch of random paint splotches that convey the feeling.  Then you'll get it.  Well, anyway, Beth mentioned that Matt's favorite artist was Salvador Dali.  The only response I had to that was "Well, yeah, that makes sense.  He writes like Dali  urlLink paints ."   At the time, I told Beth I didn't have a favorite artist, I just like different styles of art, but I prefer abstract (I'm not really surprised by that).  I have realized, though, that I do have a favorite artist.  I think it takes a lot of talent to bring across your meaning with only a few lines.  I am fascinated by the work of Ty Wilson.  Kari had this  urlLink poster  and I badgered her for years before I was able to convince her to let me have it.  I believe I will have to buy  urlLink this  for myself when I get my next bonus check.  I would love one of the serigraphs but, yeah, not going to happen at $350.  Oh, well.  Keem wouldn't tell me who her favorite artist is.  She is mean.

      I believe I've mentioned before that Beth and I are karaoke junkies.  Now, usually, when karaoke is mentioned, most people groan and say that they would have to be drunk to get up onstage and sing.  This is not the case for Beth and myself.  In fact, Beth mentioned last night that any student of Human Nature should walk into a bar on any night, sit back with a refreshing non-alcoholic beverage and observe.  We subscribe to the belief that you don't need to be drunk to have a good time.  With that said, let's talk about our rules for karaoke.  They aren't difficult, in fact, I think you'll find them to be quite simple.  Rule #1 - It takes a lot of guts to get up and sing.  If someone is pouring out their soul onstage, please have the common courtesy to make sure they can be heard.  While it may be great fun for you and your buddies to discuss past football games or have an argument with your girlfriend at the top of your lungs, not everyone cares, okay?  If we didn't like karaoke, if we didn't want to witness it being performed, we wouldn't go to a karaoke bar.  Okay?  I certainly don't come here for the Diet Coke.  Rule #2 - No matter how bad the person singing is, they deserve applause.  You don't have to give them a standing ovation, you don't have to hoop and holler, just clap, okay?    Rule #3 - This is actually more of a suggestion.  If you know you suck, are really drunk or have never sang in public before and want to try singing, you may want to pick a song that everyone knows and loves.  Some suggestions are any of the Dixie Chicks more bouncy songs, "Cecelia," "Build Me Up, Buttercup" and anything by Neil Diamond.  Neil Diamond rocks.    See?  Simple, straight to the point and makes it fun for everyone.

      I know that Rule #3 says, "pick a song that everyone knows."  But if you'll remember, it says "knows  AND  loves."  If you were to ask me what the absolute worst possible song anyone could ever sing at karaoke, I would be able to answer you honestly that it is "Picture" by Sheryl Crow and Kid Rock.  This song makes me cringe even more than such classics as "Achy Breaky Heart," "Summer Nights (From Grease, great song if you can sing but if you can't, oh, God, please stop torturing me!)" and "Tequila (there are two times you say the word tequila.  If you are so drunk you can't do that right, you shouldn't be on stage!)"   Now, I will be the first to admit that Kid Rock and Sheryl Crow do a good job of singing this song, there's a nice harmony between them.  Beth sang it one night with another karaoke buff, Michael (no, not Hippo Michael) and they did a great job.  But if you can't sing, as the drunk girls proved last night, don't even try it.  This song violates Karaoke Rule #3.  If you can't sing, pick a song everyone likes so they can sing along with it.   I hate this song.  It astounds me that people actually think this is a romantic song about star-crossed lovers.  It's not.  It's a song about drunken, drug abusing, tramps that can't stand to be alone for 3 minutes, let alone 3 days!  Let's take a look at the song closer, shall we?  My  opinion  is in italics.  Kid Rock: Livin my life in a slow hell, different girl every night at the hotel.   I ain't seen the sunshine in three damn days          Been fuelin' up on cocaine and whiskey, wish I had a good girl to miss me     Lord I wonder if I'll ever change my ways   I put your picture away, sat down and cried today I can't look at you while I'm lying next to her I put your picture away, sat down and cried today I can't look at you while I'm lying next to her   Okay, so let's dissect what the male has to say here  (This is my version and should not be confused for the actual viewpoint of Kid Rock and Sheryl Crow)   .  "Baby, I know I left you 3 days ago but hey, I couldn't handle it so I went out and found 3 different girls, one for each night, and did a lot of drugs and got drunk.  I miss you so bad.  I hope you're missing me, 'cause I'm such a catch.  Oh, and I don't want to think about you while I'm boffing some bimbo so I put your picture away.  That's romantic, right?"   Sheryl Crow: I called you last night in the hotel, everyone knows but they won't tell But their half-hearted smiles tell me somethin' just ain't right. I've been waitin' on you for a long time, fuelin' up on heartaches and cheap wine I ain't heard from you in three damn nights. I put your picture away, I wonder where you been I can't look at you while I'm lyin' next to him I put your picture away, I wonder where you been I can't look at you while I'm lyin' next to him   And here we have the plaintive melody of the female part  (again, see disclaimer above) .  "Baby, I know something's going on.  I know you're a no good, dirty, rotten cheater and a drug addict and an alcoholic but gosh darnit, I love you so.  I'm going to sit around and get drunk off of some cheap wine.  Oh, it's been so tough these last 3 nights.  I had to go and find your best friend, Billy, and he's been keeping me company but I feel real darn guilty about it."   Together: I saw you yesterday with an old friend (Sheryl Crow) It was the same old same how've you been? (Kid Rock) Since you've been gone, my world's been dark and grey (Together) You reminded me of brighter days (Kid Rock) I hoped you were comin' home to stay (Sheryl Crow) I was headed to church (Sheryl Crow) I was off to drink you away (Kid Rock)   And look, our couple has been reunited!  How wonderful!  But wait, they don't seem to be declaring their eternal love for one another.  The woman has decided to go to church, perhaps to pray for forgiveness for being an idiot.  The male has decided to go and get drunk and if the days were so much brighter, why'd you break up in the first place?     Together: I thought about you for a long time, can't seem to get you off my mind I can't understand why we're living life this way. I found your picture today, I swear I'll change my ways I just called to say I want you to come back home I found your picture today, I swear I'll change my ways I just called to say I want you to come back home I just called to say I love you, come back home   Is there any wonder why I hate this song?  Honestly.  I thought about you for a long time?  You've been gone for 3 days and you've both used this time so well - in drunken orgies!  This is not a couple that is going to make it.     So, in essence, if you come to The Chalet on a Sunday night and you sing this song, I may have to shoot you.  I probably won't because Beth says she'll miss me if I go to prison but still, it's not like I haven't given you fair warning.

      Beth is performing a beautiful rendition of "Son of a Preacher Man."  Are all eyes upon her?  No.  Instead the focus is on the table closest to the stage.    Is it a gentleman and his lady love who are exchanging vows of eternal bliss this starry evening?  No, it is not.  Apparently, the war raging that we are all forced to witness, is between a drunken man and his girlfriend's friend.  Something to do with how he doesn't appreciate her sitting behind him when he is driving and making fun of him when he is pulled over by a cop.  It was hard to make a lot of sense out of what he was saying.  And I didn't care.  The point is, dammit, Beth and I are here at The Chalet to sing and listen and have a good time.  It is difficult to do that when you are forced to listen to other patrons drunken conversations.   Beth is trying a new song tonight, "The Thunder Rolls."  It's interesting hearing it sung by a woman - she puts a more plaintive twist to the words and the melody.  Almost as if she is who the song is about.   Okay, dammit.  I just told the drunk girls the amendment to the Rules of Karaoke.  I just said "If you sing the song Picture, I will be forced to shoot you."  I have given them fair warning.  Beth will not let me shoot them because she didn't hear me say it.  That and I don't actually have a gun.  This is probably a good thing.  I am going to the bathroom, I can't sit through this.  Beth let me know what I missed by going to the bathroom to save myself from Death Row, the interpretive dance to "Picture."  Beth said it was a cross between New Kids on the Block meets Roger Rabbit.  Beth has demonstrated it.  I am very frightened.     I am walking up to sing "Change the World" and one of the drunk girls (the one with the boyfriend) asks "Can you sing a song about a broken heart?"  I respond with "How about one about unrequieted love?"  I didn't hear what she said after that, Beth did.  Apparently she cocked her head to one side, eyes completely vacant and said "I don't know what that is?"   Dean's here!  Way cool.  Dean is awesome.  His water is in a Leinenkugel's Honey Weiss Bier glass.  It has a picture of a walleye on the back and says "This member of the perch family loves the cold, deep waters of large lakes and rivers."  What the hell is this?     There is this guy who comes to karaoke named "Jumpin' John" - he has been on the news because he walks everywhere (? yeah, I know.  I don't get it either).  Anyway, whenever he sings, he really gets into acting everything out.  Sometimes it's fun, sometimes it's scary...mainly it's fun.  Anyway, tonight, he is performing "Pinball Wizard" which he really gets into...sings with his eyes shut, does the hand movements like he's playing pinball, even will hip check the non-existent machine.  You have to be there.  It's amazing.  He shut up the drunk table.  He is the Karaoke King.  The man is a god.   "Ice cubes down the back.  What a lovely way of sayin' how much you love me."  The new version of "Havin' My Baby"  Drunk table.  Drunk girlfriend drops ice cubes down drunk boyfriend's shirt.  He is not pleased.   After I sing "Tainted Love," drunk girl (I have no idea which one anymore, they're both blonde, thin and annoying) comments "I like you.  Can you sing all night?"  Which sounds like a compliment but with the amount of beer she's been drinking could be influencing her a little.  Instead of beer goggles, she's wearing her beer headphones.  Although I am glorious in many ways, that's not my best song.  It's still fun to sing.   Heard from loud table in the back (not drunk table but getting close) - "That's exactly why they won't let me be Queen!"  No clue.   Beth - "I think you should sing Ooh Poo Pah Doo (Yes.  This is an actual song.)"  Dana - "I think you should stop smoking crack."   Dana (after asking Beth to repeat herself twice) - "I hear your lips moving but I can't see what you're saying."      And you wonder why I don't drink.

      If you had to pick the person you've known or met who, with charisma alone, could have seduced you, who would it be?    I have loved Greek men from the time I was 13 and discovered Greek mythology.  When other girls were discovering boys, I was using my Barbie and Ken dolls to act out scenes from Homer's Illiad and The Odyessy.  I wanted to change my name from Dana to Danae (Perseus's mother) but Mom said no.    So when I met aforementioned Michael at the Bank of DM, I fell under his spell immediately.  He was short, hairy and Greek with an amazing personality.  And he was extremely distracting.  I was talking to Adam one day and stopped in mid-sentence, staring off over Adam's shoulder.  He turned around and there was Michael, changing the bottle in the water cooler.  Needless to say, all my conversational skills were gone for the day.    He moved on to another job years ago and, while I'm no longer as obsessed with him as I once was, I'm glad I met him.  He was a great guy and I wish him the best of luck in everything he does.

      I keep waking up at night, anywhere between 3:30-4:30.  While it is lovely to wake up in the middle of the night and realize that you can go back to bed for several hours before you have to get up for work, it is far lovelier to wake up in the middle of the night and realize that you can sleep in because it’s your day off.  What sucks is waking up in the middle of the night, realizing that it’s 4:30 and your alarm is going off for a reason.  Whose bright idea was it for me to start working at 5:30 on Sunday morning?  Oh, that’s right, it was mine.    I like the  urlLink Tazo  tea bottles.  They amuse me.  The tea’s pretty good as well.  My favorite of the bottled teas is Brambleberry (Marion blackberry and apple juice with tea).  Of course, I’ve only had two kinds so I’m not an expert.  I am a horrid, horrid friend.  I was going to call Beth back last night after my cell phone cut out in the parking ramp - once I got into the apartment.  I forgot.  “Beth, are you there?  No, you’re not.  I think I have lost you.  Yes, you are gone.”  I am sorry, Beth.  Please forgive me.    Is it wrong that I am checking out young boys on a Sunday?  I’m going to be struck dead, aren’t I?  Well, he was at least 16 because he was working at the local gas station and drove a decent Mustang.  Maybe he was closer to 18.  Who can tell?  I think you have to be 18 to work the overnight shift in Minnesota.  Anyway, he was cute.  Keem paid more attention to his bad parking job than his glorious brown eyes.  I feel sorry for her sometimes.  Karaoke tonight with Beth.  I am looking forward to it.  Keem, Beth and I are going to go see  urlLink Dodgeball  tomorrow night (Mmm, Vince Vaugh, Ben Stiller, hot black guy in spandexy outfit).  There are many summer movies I want to see.    urlLink Spiderman 2  (Mmm, Tobey Macquire (He's cute in a nerdy way), Alfred Molina, hot guy who plays Peter Parker's friend, Ted Raimi (he played Joxer on Xena.  I adored him.  Stupid Gabrielle)!    urlLink Catwoman  (Mmm, Benjamin Bratt, Halle Berry.  Halle Berry in leather.  Hey, I always said she's the one woman who could turn me)!  Okay, I'm going to stop now.  Sorry, I meandered.  Of course, these are random thoughts so meandering is allowed!      I like the new Counting Crows song but I wish it would get out of my head.  “Love, love, love, accidentally in love, love, love.”  Over and over and over again.  Well, at least we know it’s catchy.  My desk is a mess.  Today I will get organized!  Another song stuck in my head now.  “I don’t want to work.  I want to bang on my drum all day.”  I don’t have a drum.  I need to get a drum.  Keem says I can’t get one.  She is mean.  My desk is still a mess.  I did not get organized.  I'm not surprised.

      Today is Father’s Day.  Happy Father’s Day to all of you fathers out there.  Today I will share some good memories of my Dad.    He made me laugh by being the “Tickle Monster,” who sounded like a cross between “Cookie Monster” and “Fat Albert.”  Dad also introduced me to Bill Cosby through vinyl.  The Black Snake skit still puts me in stitches.  He let Kari and I go to “Animal House” when “The Muppet Movie” was sold out so this is probably why I love movies like “Porky’s” and “Saving Silverman.”  You know the type, not necessarily academy material.  He exposed me to Johnny Cash and Merle Haggard at an early age.  One of our poodles was named Susie Boy after Johnny Cash’s hit “A Boy Named Sue.”  Dad also used to sing, “I’m An Okie from Muskogee” to me.  When I saw Merle Haggard in concert, I was thinking of my Dad when Merle sang the song.  One of his favorite stories was of when I was first learning how to read (thank you, Mom) at the age of 3 or 4.  Apparently, we were driving and I pointed out a truck to him and said, “Look, Dad.  F-O-R-D.  That spells truck.”    He enjoyed reading.  He understood my fascination with Shakespeare but also appreciated that I liked modern authors as well.  When he died, I found a John Grisham novel in his apartment that was read half-way, “The Pelican Brief.”  Even in death, he was encouraging me to try new authors.  If he hadn’t, I may never have discovered John Grisham and my two favorite books by him – “A Time to Kill” and “The Rainmaker.”    He enjoyed watching me act.  When I was 16 and in my church’s production of “Jesus Christ Superstar,” the tech crew had come up with a way to emphasize the scene where Pontius Pilate has Jesus Christ’s blood on his hands.  The gentleman playing Pontius Pilate was supposed to reach into a clear glass bowl of water, squeeze a package of fake blood and the water was supposed to turn blood red.  During one performance, this didn’t work.  Our Pilate squeezed and squeezed, veins popping out on his forehead, and suddenly, the package of blood exploded.  Droplets of fake blood splashed everywhere, including on my arm.  I held my arm extended in front of me and was staring at it in horror.  Part of me was thinking that this was literally Christ’s blood, spilled for me and apparently, the audience member sitting next to my Dad recognized this.  She turned to her companion and whispered, pointing at me, “Look at that girl.  She is such a good actress.”  My Dad leaned over and whispered proudly, “That’s my daughter.”    Dad died on April 10, 1994.  Exactly one month shy of his 70th birthday.  He was cremated and my brothers, sisters, and I visited the park where his parents were married to release his ashes.  As we said our goodbyes to him, we each took a handful of ashes and tossed him into the wind.  Suddenly, this wind changed direction and Dad’s ashes came flying back into our faces!  For a brief few moments, all you heard was the “ptoo-ptoo” sound as we tried to get the taste of our father out of our mouths.  Then one of us (not sure who) said, “Dad always had a good sense of humor.”  Another one said “Yes and he’s kind of salty.”  Well, what are you going to do but laugh?    Thanks for the memories, Dad!

      For some reason, my friends choose to refer to this as the "whiny" song (there have been other words but this is a G-rated post).  I happen to really like it.  That might be because I appreciate that Superman had a tough job fighting criminals day and night and he couldn't be with Lois Lane.  He wasn't my favorite superhero by any means.  When I was 5, I had a tremendous crush on Aquaman.  When I grew up, I really had it bad for Batman (but only played by Adam West).  So this song makes Superman seem a little less perfect to me.  Is that so bad?  Superman (It ain't easy) - Five for Fighting  I can’t stand to fly  I’m not that naive I’m just out to find The better part of me  I’m more than a bird...I’m more than a plane More than some pretty face beside a train It’s not easy to be me   I Wish that I could cry Fall upon my knees Find a way to lie About a home I’ll never see   It may sound absurd...but don’t be naive Even Heroes have the right to bleed I may be disturbed...but won’t you concede Even Heroes have the right to dream It’s not easy to be me   Up, up and away...away from me It’s all right...You can all sleep sound tonight I’m not crazy...or anything…   I can’t stand to fly I’m not that naive Men weren’t meant to ride With clouds between their knees   I’m only a man in a silly red sheet Digging for kryptonite on this one way street Only a man in a funny red sheet Looking for special things inside of me   It’s not easy to be me.

      So Keem has abandoned me again to go home to La Crosse.  Her family is having a reunion.  Fortunately though, I have Beth to do fun stuff with.  She is still in the process of moving, just the unpacking part where you try to figure out where everything is going to go that is kind of fun.  Last night we went to  urlLink Joe DiMaggio's  in Fridley.  I'd never been there before and I was pleased.  We definitely ordered way too much food or the portions there are just much larger than what I'm used to getting.  The soup, 7 bean and ham, was excellent.  I liked the cheesy garlic breadsticks.  I don't know how my turkey club was because by the time that got to the table, I was full.  Maybe it'll be a nice snack later on today.  Then we decided to go and see a movie.   urlLink The Terminal  was playing at Wynnsong.  If you haven't seen it yet, I recommend it highly.  Tom Hanks was wonderful, I have never seen Catherine Zeta-Jones look so vulnerable and real and then, there was my beloved Stanley Tucci (yes, I have many beloveds.  No, I am not fickle.  I love them equally and I'm sure they understand I can't just be held to one favorite actor).  What can you say about Stanley Tucci?  The man is a genius at the comic meltdown, where his character just explodes with insanity.  See The  urlLink Imposters  and  urlLink Big Trouble  for some classic moments of Tucci hilarity.    After that, it was off to Cub to go grocery shopping.  Beth doesn't go grocery shopping that often, apparently.  After being there with her, I now know what Keem goes through when we go to the grocery store (Although I think Beth is a lot more bouncy than I am).    When we got back to Beth's, we watched The Royal Tannenbaums.  Now, I did fall asleep a couple of times throughout the movie (this is not an indication that the movie's bad or anything.  I had been up since 6:30 AM and was trying to function on Bethtime), and I'm hoping that's why I'm horribly, horribly confused by this movie.  It was very strange.

       urlLink     What Finding Nemo Character are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    Thanks again to frog.  Keem and I saw this movie four or five times in the theater.  The interaction between Marlin and Dory was pretty much what Keem and I go through on a daily basis.  Poor Keem.  She puts up with a lot from me.  You know the scene where they're coming into Australia and there's all the fish and then you see the whale?  I wave at the whale.  Every single time I see the movie.  Just a casual "hello" that I'm not even aware that I'm doing.  Yes.  I am a dork.

           You're  Ulysses !  by James Joyce    Most people are convinced that you don't make any sense, but compared to what else you could say, what you're saying now makes tons of sense. What people do understand about you is your vulgarity, which has convinced people that you are at once brilliant and repugnant. Meanwhile you are content to wander around aimlessly, taking in the sights and sounds of the city. What you see is vast, almost limitless, and brings you additional fame. When no one is looking, you dream of being a Greek folk hero.      Take the  urlLink Book Quiz  at the  urlLink Blue Pyramid .     found on  urlLink Frog's blog  - I'm reading through the archives.

      Not even the fact that I am miserable with a horridly horrid disease (okay, I have a cold.  I tend to whine a lot when I'm sick.  I am not actually diseased.  But it sounds better than germed) can keep me away from Spiderman.      Saw it last night with Beth, Keem and AdamandRich.  Now, one thing you should know about me is that recently I was asked if I've ever seen a movie I didn't like and I couldn't answer the question.  Thanks to Beth, however, I was able to remember that I absolutely hated Romper Stomper (stupid neo-nazis in London).  So my point is that if you're looking for a critic's view of Spiderman, you're not going to get it from me.  I loved it.  Bruce Campbell was superb as the snooty usher, my beloved Ted Raimi (Joxer on Xena, Warrior Princess) had some very funny lines and it was an amazing movie.  Here's the only spoiler you're going to get...Remember the joy Tobey MacQuire showed when he first discovered his powers?  The joyswing through the city, jumping from building to building.  Well, while the movie starts out very dark and depressing, he does recapture that joy again.  That's it.  Go see it.  I think it's better than the first one.  But, hey, I've only seen one movie that I hated so what do I know?

      Todd Glass is gone!  Todd Glass is gone!  I am happy!  Lalalalalala!  Sorry.  I was having a moment.  Have the people on LCS forgotten that this is a game?  C'mon.  There's nothing personal about this.  During the photo booth section of the program, you keep getting the reaction shots of people whenever someone said that they were funnier than them.  The look of betrayal, the "How could they say that?" sentiment running across the faces was priceless.  And John Heffron's teary speech when he came back to the house?  As much as I love him, I did have to roll my eyes over that.  Ant was superb last night and so deserved immunity.  I know he was lying through his teeth but still, it was great to watch everyone get shot down by him.  They left a little too much out of the scene between Ant and Corey Holcomb but I can almost guarantee I know what happened.  Todd Glass, being an annoying "I'm always in your face" prick, probably made a comment about the fact that Ant is gay and used a not so nice word.  So Ant probably commented back about how that's not an appropriate word, it would be like using the "N" word.  I don't know that for sure, of course, because they didn't show that.  I'm sure that's what happened though.  Corey so took it too far but I think Ant should have apologized for offending him immediately and then explained why he said it.  But that's me.  What really ticked me off was Todd running off the mouth about how Ant shouldn't have said anything.  I was screaming at the television set "Well, you started it.  Jerk!"  Yes, my roommates think I'm insane.  What ticks me off is last week, it was okay for Corey to make comments about how he just knows Ant wants to sleep with him.  And this week, he gets to throw a hissy fit.  Did you see Ant stomping around last week like a baby?  No, you did not.  Okay, so here's the proof that I am the Queen of the Universe.  Last week, I wanted Bonnie gone.  She is gone.  This week, I wanted Todd gone and, even though I grudgingly admit he was very funny last night, Tammy Pescatelli nudged him out by 5%.  I was so scared she was going to lose.  I'm hoping Corey's next and then my world is complete.  I still haven't decided who I want to win.  I'm torn between Ant, Kathleen Madigan, John Heffron and Alonzo Bodden.    Does anyone else hate how long Jay Mohr will pause before he tells us who won?  That just annoys me.

      This topic comes up every once in awhile.  If I mention that I have to find a ride to work because Keem isn't working that day, people want to know why.  If you (me, 37, reasonably intelligent adult) tell them that you don't have a driver's license, you get a lot of strange looks.  I know what's going through their heads (must be because of a DWI) but that's not it.  I've never had my license.  I've had my permit twice but there is just something that keeps me from taking that big step.  And that would be because I'm scared.  Okay?  I've said it.  Whew.  That felt pretty good.  Here are the two main reasons why: Mom and I are going to Yellowstone on one of the vacations from Hell.  I have just received my shiny new permit at the age of 18!  Mom decides to let me drive.  Okay, now no one told me that you couldn't drive out of state on a permit so already breaking the law (and yes, I know that it's on the back of the permit.  Now).  I'm driving down the highway, towing a  urlLink camper , and all of a sudden the camper flies open and one of the mattresses goes whooshing out and hits the highway.  Mom screams "Stop the car," I do.  She hops out and goes running down the side of the highway to get the mattress.  When she is less than a yard away, here comes this car.  These two people jump out of the car, grab the mattress and drive off as my mother is screaming at them and shaking her fist (because, yeah, that's scary).  She fumes back to the car, fastens the camper back together and proceeds to yell at me, even though she is the one who packed the camper and didn't latch it properly.  It is my fault.  Why?  Because I'm the one that's driving.  Yeah.  It still doesn't make sense 19 years later.  Same trip.   Mom is terrified of driving through the mountains.  So she elects that I, with my shiny new permit, will drive.  I am doing fine until we hit the 19 miles of road construction.  Picture it.  The divided two lane highway is no more.  The left side of the highway is closed and all that is keeping me from oncoming traffic is those little thin orange poles (because those will be so helpful in stopping a car accident).  On my right, I am overlooking a mountain.  Sheer drop down.  In front of me is 19 miles of cars going the speed limit so I, as well as everyone behind me, should be content with going the speed limit, right?  Ha.  No, Mr. Semi Truck Driver behind me is not pleased with the fact that I am only able to go as fast as everyone in front of me.  He is looming over the tiny car (and camper) and my mother freaks.  This is actual dialouge (Please, I couldn't make this stuff up.  Who would believe me?):  Mom (hysterical, convinced she is going to die) - "Pull over!  Pull over!"  DM (very calmly) - "Mom.  If I pull over to the left, I'll drive into oncoming traffic and we will die.  If I pull over to the right, we will drive off the cliff and we will die.  If I stop right here, that semi will crawl up our ass and we will die.  Now.  What would you suggest I do?"  Mom (after brief moment) - "You know, sarcasm is not very becoming."  She's never understood me.

      Okay.  I need help.  I need something new to read.  Any suggestions, blogging world?  Recently read: The DaVinci Code:  Well-researched, interesting, yes.  Irritating, aggravating, yes.  It is a page-turner, I will give you that.  This would be because the chapters are only one to two pages long and each single one ends on a cliff hanger.    The Devil Wears Prada - I liked this about as much as I liked The Nanny Diaries.  Yes, it was interesting, yes, it was funny.  But why do I want to read about smart, orientated young women who completely lose themselves working for a complete jackass?  I've had that job.  What I'm relying on now to keep me from being deprived of the written word.  Many, many random blogs.  Nora Roberts:  Yes, she is a romance author.  Yes, my life is devoid of romance.  She happens to be the best one I've found who doesn't make it all about sex and she makes me laugh and cry.  So there.  JK Rowling:  The Harry Potter books for the 3rd time.  I'm midway book 3.    Any suggestions?

      Or Why I want to go to Chicago and kick some ass.  Read  urlLink this  if you want to know what I'm vanting about today.  Or, just hold on for the ride.  So I mentioned I've been reading One Good Thing, right?  Really getting into the stories Flea tells about her family and her job and having a great time?  Well, her last post (June 26th) really ticked me off.  Oh, I'm not upset with her, I am upset with the stupid woman who lives in her neighborhood that dared to make these horrid accusations without any basis in fact.    Here's the thing, people.  I don't have kids, so maybe I can't understand everything about child raising but I do know this.  You can not witness one event and decide, right then and there, that you know what this person's parenting skills are like and that they are a "bad parent."  I'm sorry.  It doesn't work that way.   This happened to a former friend of mine once.  He was at Target, filling a prescription for his son who had an extremely bad ear infection when his son said he didn't feel good.  Brought him to the bathroom and whoosh, kid is sick all over the place.  Turns out that the shot of antibiotics the doctor gave him caused an allergic reaction.  So, seeing his girlfriend was waiting to check out, he decided to take said kid out to the car and wait with him until she finished.  On the way to the car, some complete stranger starts in on him about what a horrible father he is and that he had better not punish his boy for throwing up.  How dare he take the kid shopping when he was sick?  How dare he make the child sit in the car by himself?  And on and on.  Knowing nothing of the situation, the guy decides to take it upon himself to brand my friend as a bad parent.  Working for a department store, I witnessed a father try to keep his son from smacking his baby sister in the head with a toy.  The kid was not responding well to his father and kept on hitting her, even after the toy was taken away.  Dad finally said "If you hit your sister one more time, I will spank you."  Kid does it again.  Dad takes kid out of the cart, taps him once or twice on the butt and puts him back in the cart.  Didn't hurt him, just made him think about what he was doing.  Some old woman comes running up, screaming about how she's calling the cops on him for child abuse.  Why?  He didn't use a belt, he didn't whale on the kid with a baseball bat, but, because he disciplined his child, he was a bad parent.  Kids are tricky.  I know this because I used to be a kid, I used to babysit and I now have a nephew.  They think nothing of trying to get away from Mom for a few minutes to explore.  I used to drive my Mom crazy anytime we went to Target because I'd always disappear on her.  Until she figured out that I headed straight for the book section and started checking there first before panicking.    So, to Flea, all I have to say is I am sorry that this stupid woman thought she knew everything about you and your family, I am glad that your neighbors stuck up for you and I am thrilled that Alex and Christopher are okay.    And to this woman in Chicago, you are just lucky that I a) don't know who you are, b) don't drive and c) am surrounded by sane people who prevent me from taking road trips o'revenge.  And who the hell cares if her kids wear shoes?  Hello?  It's summer?  I'd be barefoot all the time if I could get away with it.  You want to go yell at my Mom for awhile?  I dare you.  She'd kick your ass.  Okay.  The birds have shut up finally.  I'm going to try and sleep again.

      I like birds.  I always have.  While I'm not a bird watcher, per se, I do like to watch birds.  By that, of course, I mean I don't need to know the Latin names of different birds, I don't need binoculars, I am not obsessed with sighting a certain bird before I die.  No, I just like to look at them outside, hopping around on their little bird legs, making the occasional chirping sound, and doing whatever it is that birds do each day.  Now, it is 5:30 on Sunday morning.  I am at Beth's, trying to sleep in her office chair, the balcony door is open because, as an overweight person, I can't sleep if I'm too hot, and, for the last hour, I have been listening to a damned bird symphony.    I did fall asleep for about 20 minutes and just woke up, scared to death because I heard this horrid racket.  I almost fell out of the chair trying to figure out what the noise was.  And then I realized I couldn't blame the birds this time.  No, the godawful noise was me.  Snoring.  I have a feeling this is going to be a very long day.

      Tonight I am looking over the city, listening to the radio, and feeling, I don't know, lonely, I guess is the right word.  I'm not sure why.  I have great friends and tomorrow I'm going to karaoke with Beth, that is always fun.  Monday we're going to go to a movie, not sure what yet.  A Dodgeball/Spiderman 2 double feature would be fun.  Every once in awhile, I feel like there's something missing in my life.  What could it be?  I'm reasonably happy.  I love my friends, my cat (even though he likes Keem better than me), my family, the adorable nephew who terrifies me...things are good, right?  Keem and I watched Working Girl and Galaxy Quest tonight.  Maybe that's it.  Both of them have that big romantic moment where the hero grabs the heroine and they have the big kiss and you know that everything's going to be okay.    Maybe I'm wondering where my hero is, where is my big kiss?  Maybe tomorrow I should watch something non-romantic and I will settle back into my celibate forever life and not worry about the occasional twinge.  Maybe I should go back to the doctor and get my prescription for effexor refilled so I get back on an even keel again.  That's probably better, huh?  Anyway, soon I will go off to bed, hug Hippo to my clogged up chest and dream of Prince Charming...who will probably turn into Randall Flagg because I'm thinking of reading The Stand again.

      I have a bit of an overactive imagination.  I know, those of you who know me are me are nodding your heads furiously because you have all been recipients of what my mind can come up with.    Anyway, I live on the 26th floor of an apartment building in downtown Saint Paul.  This morning, when I woke up at 3:30 for the second day in a row, I was a little puzzled as to why Saint Paul had dissappeared.  Then I realized that the reason why I couldn't see any other buildings was because of the very thick fog that had rolled off the river.  The only thing I could see was tiny little pinpricks of light about a block or two away (street lights).  It's a weird feeling looking over the city at 3:30 in the morning on a normal day, there aren't many cars on the street and you feel like you're one of the few people in the world.  But when the fog is out, well, then I start remembering "The Mist" by Stephen King.  It is extremely distracting to play Alchemy when you keep expecting mutant bird creatures to splat against the window.  Last weekend, as I was moaning about being sick still, Beth made the comment "Well, it's a good thing you're not reading 'The Stand.'"  This is because every single time I read "The Stand," I get sick.  You know, it's only a matter of time before some idiot spills one of the jars of chemical warfare.  This book could happen.  At least that's what I keep saying to myself when I'm comparing my symptoms to everyone in the book.  Then there was the time I was working at a gas station and the pump bell started ringing.  When that happened, you were supposed to look outside, write down the license plate number if you could see it and give the general idea that you were paying attention.  This was supposed to keep people from driving off without paying for their gas.  Of course, they didn't tell us how we were supposed to do this and wait on a line of people at the same time.  Anyway, I glance over, figuring I may not be able to write the plate number down but at least I'll give the potential thief the impression that I'm paying attention to them.  And what should be standing outside, pumping gas, causing me to gasp outloud?  It was a clown.  Okay, so you're thinking not such a big deal, right?  It was to me.  My voice tremoring, I turn to the long line of people waiting for me to ring their purchases up.  "Does anyone else see a clown out there?"  Yes, you can imagine the glances I got.  Most of my regulars were wondering if my mind had slipped yet another notch down the crazy stick.  They all chorused "Yes."  "Oh, thank God," I said.  "I just finished reading Stephen King's 'It.' and I was a little worried."  I am not kidding.  Every single one of them turned, looked outside again and then all said "Ohhhh."  They understood.  Stephen King is dangerous to those us with the overactive imagination.  There's a reason why I don't watch Stephen King movies.  If I'm reading the book, I can formulate my own picture of the monster and it's usually fairly benign.  If you watch the movie, though, you have to see the face that Hollywood has placed on the monster and that's the image that gets stuck in my head.   Case in point, saw "Pet Sematary."  You know the scene where the wife is confronted with the vision of her sister, the one who died of spinal menangitis, coming after her.  I swear to you that shortly after I saw this movie, my mom sent me into the basement to get the laundry and I heard someone call my name.  I turned and there was this crinkly, scary woman from the movie standing there.  I ran screaming upstairs and told Mom I would never go into the basement again.  I kept that promise for a good five years too.  Yes, I know there wasn't really anyone there.  It doesn't matter.  Stephen King freaks me out.  Hmm, maybe it's time to read "The Stand" again.

      Okay, after publishing my most recent post, I have thought about what I said and must clarify.  Mainly because I'm worried some of the people I work with will come after me with tar and feathers.  I don't want to have children.  However, this does not mean I don't believe you (whoever you might be) should not have children.  I know lots of parents who are quite good at being a parents.  I'm just not a parent type person myself.  My friend Matt has children and I adore them, from a safe distance.  My sister has a small child and I think he is simply wonderful, if only he would stop screaming every time I come near him.  Eric, the brother-in-law, says that babies can sense your fear.  I'm beginning to think that might be true.  So, parents of the world, I respect you and think you're great, I just don't want to join your ranks.  Meanwhile, I will continue to read blogs about the trials and tribulations (and yes, the joys and jubilations) about raising small children.  I will laugh and cry and marvel at the physical and emotional strength these people have.  And I won't judge you for wanting to have kids.  Just like I would hope you would not judge me for not wanting to have them myself.

      You may hear people refer to themselves as not a cat person or not a dog person.  I'm not a child person.  I don't like small children.  They're messy, throw up, have disgusting diapers and you have to constantly follow them around to make sure they keep out of trouble.  Give me a cat any day, a lot less maintenance.  Don't get me wrong; kids are okay, as long as they keep their distance.  I adore my nephew (the most adorable child in the universe (and no, I am not biased)) and love spending time with him.  I just don't want a child of my own.  My biological clock is not ticking and is probably broken.  I'm not financially (or emotionally) secure enough to bring a child into this world and I think there are enough children that don't have homes that if I ever found myself wanting a child, I could adopt.    Now, you would think, wouldn't you, that with the population exploding the way it is, I would be admired for saying this, right?  Well, you'd be wrong.  For some reason, whenever the topic of children has come when I am surrounded by a group of women, the fact that I don't want to physically bear children seems to be akin with admitting that in my spare time I like to bludgeon small furry animals to death.    Take the following conversation:  Group of women, all of whom have or are planning on having children, and myself are talking at work, in between calls at the Bank of DM.  The topic of babies comes up.  There is much oohing and ahhing about how wonderful children are and how everyone should have a small child.  DM (naively stating, hoping this time her opinion will be valued):  "I don't want to have children."  Future Mother:  "You don't?  How can you not want to have children?  Everyone should have children."  DM:  "I don't like babies (see above reason why)."  Gasps of horror abound.  "What?  I don't."  Mother of 3:  "Oh, DM, it's different when you have your own.  I used to feel the same way and then I popped out 3 annoying little rugrats and my whole brain exploded (okay, she probably didn't say that but hey, it's my blog)."  Future Mother:  "Every woman should have a child.  You're just not ready.  Someday you'll realize you want to have babies."  DM (ticked off, especially when she considers how many children are abused by their parents daily):  "I don't agree with you.  I don't think I will ever be ready to have a baby.  I've already decided that if I ever get financially secure enough, I will adopt an older child, one who may not have a chance to get adopted otherwise."  Future Mother:  "Well, you can still have a baby."  DM:  "But I don't want a baby.  I would think that the fact that I realize I don't have the temperament to properly care for a baby would be a good thing.  Why take the chance that I might be one of those women that can't handle it and then abandons her baby?"  Future Mother:  "That's horrid.  You wouldn't do that."  DM:  "I don't know that.  No one knows that.  No one wakes up and says 'Hmm, when I have a baby, I'll abandon them.'  I'm just saying I don't think I could handle a baby on a full time basis."  Wise Grandmother:  "DM, if you don't feel you could handle a baby, don't have one."  DM:  "Thank you."  Yes!  Finally someone understands!  The following day, I walk into work, I address the same group of and tell them the following story:  DM:  "Last night I went home.  One of my cats ran out into the hallway like he always does.  Since I was in a hurry to answer the phone, I figured he would be okay in the hallway for a few minutes."  The women look at me strangely, trying to figure out why I am telling them this.  I continue. "This morning, when I was getting ready, I hear this loud meowing coming from the hallway.  I realize that I never let Eddy back into the apartment last night.  I left my cat outside all night.  And you think I should have a child?"  Wise Grandmother:  "Don't have children, DM."  Future Mother:  "Well, that's just a cat.  You wouldn't do that with a baby."  This conversation took place 3 years ago.  Eddy is fine and well, still trying to run into the hallway (and yes, I have forgotten him again, fortunately the neighbor knocked on the door (but it was only 2 times in six years)).  I still do not want babies of my own but I adore my nephew.  I still think I may adopt someday but if I did, I would definitely want an older child, maybe 15 or 16.    So do you think it's wrong that I don't want my own child?

      Okay,  urlLink Frog  and  urlLink Flea  found it first but still...I'm pretty excited.  The only problem is, with the bronchitis, that I read, I laugh hysterically, I cough up a lung, I catch my breath and start the whole cycle over again.    Maybe I should wait to read  urlLink Finslippy  until I can breathe without making the lovely wheezing sound?  Until my ribs don't ache from the coughing?  Until I can stop whining to Keem about how I'm dying?  No, why deprive myself of this much fun.  I've got four days off to recuperate.  Go check her out.  She's hilarious.  Read Frog and Flea's blogs as well.  I have spoken.

      Another driving story from my past.  Every now and then, Eric (the brother-in-law) will allow me to drive, ignoring the fact that I am without permit or license.  He is a brave, brave man and very patient.  I am quite fond of him.  Here is a transcript of our most recent journey together (about two years ago).  Eric:  I am going to the store.  Do you want to come with?  DM:  Sure.  Can I drive?  Eric (looking around to make sure Kari can't hear):  Sure.  DM manages to back out of the driveway without crushing trees or car.  Starts up the hill and sees, oh the horror, a car approaching on the other side of the road.  She, to put it mildly, freaks out.  DM:  Oh my God!  What do I do?  Eric (calmly):  Stay on your side.  DM (after car passes):  Okay.  I can do this.  (Looks at speedometer)  Too fast!  Too fast!  Eric (laughing):  Dana, you're going five miles an hour.  You can speed up a little.  I did eventually learn to press the gas pedal a little more and actually got up to 15 miles an hour on that trip.  It was cut short after we reached the store and Eric realized I am terrified of parking (any kind, not just parallel) and he had to park for me.  I am a coward when it comes to driving.  However, I do like to ride fast.

      Okay, so I might be dying of the plague but I'm not going to miss LCS for anything.  Here's what happened.  Ant, being altruistic (snort of laughter), presented Jay London with the photoshoot Ant had won the previous week.  Jay accepted gracefully and then Ant reveals his plan was to get Jay to vote the same way that his alliance.  Duh.  Like we couldn't figure that out.  The LCS household had to give a roast, the roastee chosen was Jay London.  I don't like roasts, I find that they're an excuse to be really mean about someone and use humor as an excuse.  I found that Alonzo Bodden was the most eloquent and nicest of the roasters and was glad that he won.  John Heffron was probably the next best.  However, there was a catch.  Since Jay London was the one they chose to roast, he won immunity.  Alonzo wasn't pleased by this and I can't say I blame him but hey, it's a game, right?  You know they're going to throw things in to be tricky.  Anyway, long story short (too late), Gary Gulman and Ant went head to head.  Both were very funny but Gary won by 70(?)%.  I was sorry to see Ant go, I am fond of him.  He did make a comment about everyone seeing him as the head of the alliance but he was just a puppet and someone else was pulling his strings.  Hmm, I wonder who the puppet master could be?  Looking forward to next week.

      I have been struck with the plague.    Well, okay, it's just bronchitis but still...I hate this.  I am not good with illness.  I am convinced that I am dying but Keem says no.  She seems to be getting a little cranky as well, apparently I've said this a lot in the last few days.  I am back to work today after two days at home sick.  I want to crawl under my desk and sleep.  But fortunately, I just have to get through today and I have four days off in which I will sleep (hopefully).    Anyway, I'm back, sort of.  I missed you all.

      Hmm.  So, apparently Tammy Pescatelli (Last Comic Standing) has a lot of fans.  Apparently, these fans want to see her barefoot or naked or, the oddest one, playing football.    I know.  I'm confused as well.    I have also been found by someone wanting to know about Tobey Macquire and someone looking for a big hippo from Kaybee Toys.  Pretty much Tammy's winning the hit list...And, just in case she doesn't win LCS, hey, she could always get a job playing football.

      Tonight I agreed to babysit the nephew.&nbsp; This is an activity met with great trepidation because babies and I, we don't mix well.&nbsp; Josh is adorable and everything but I don't get to see him that often and, at 9 1/2 months, he doesn't have a clue who I am.&nbsp; So I was scared.  &nbsp;  Kari was supposed to pick me up from work at 6:30 and she is usually quite punctual so at 6:33, I was rushing outside to wait for her.&nbsp; Walked outside with Beth&nbsp;and then she ran off to pick up her lunch.&nbsp; And I waited, paging through a Scrapbook Etc. magazine.&nbsp; And then Beth was back and there was no Kari at 7:15.&nbsp; So I went back inside to find 3 messages waiting for me from Eric and Kari.&nbsp; Apparently Kari was lost.&nbsp; So I sat by my phone and waited some more.  &nbsp;  At about 8:00, there's another phone call.&nbsp; This one is from Kari and she's downstairs at the guard's desk.&nbsp; The reservation is for 8:30.&nbsp; So we get in the car and Josh starts crying.&nbsp; Little tears at first, just observations that he is bored because he's been in the car forever.&nbsp; Kari orders me to sing.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  You would think that with all the times I spend at karaoke, I would remember all the words to Change The World, right?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Not a clue.&nbsp; And this kid, he knows when you start making stuff up.&nbsp; He appreciated Nobody&nbsp;but then started in with the criticism when I hit the chorus the 2nd time.&nbsp; Kari and I did the medley of Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star/The Alphabet Song/I'm A Little Teapot.&nbsp; I tried Pink Houses, If You Could Read My Mind, This Diamond Ring, Mocking Bird.&nbsp; Nothing worked.&nbsp; At this point, he was sobbing pretty hard and Kari was frantically looking for a grocery store.  &nbsp;  We found a Cub and Kari ran in, leaving me with the child.&nbsp; And the child screamed.&nbsp; And the child made a big noise.&nbsp; And I sang desperately, running through song after song.&nbsp; There was Jesus Loves Me and This Little Light Of Mine and Amazing Grace.&nbsp; There was The Star Spangled Banner.&nbsp; There was the weeping and gnashing of teeth (he has four now) when Kari ran out because she had left her wallet in the car.  &nbsp;  But then the Mom returned and the nephew was pleased.&nbsp; And the child partook of an Arrowroot cookie.&nbsp; And the child had formula.&nbsp; And the child used the sippy cup the Mom bought in an act of desperation.&nbsp; And I got to sit in the back seat and make sure that the nephew did not choke on the cookies.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  And then, something happened.&nbsp; The child smiled at me.&nbsp; And I was filled with love and adoration.&nbsp;&nbsp;The child babbled and said "Da da da" and "Lamoosneusza" which obviously is a sign that he is a genius.&nbsp; And I was filled with longing for a small child of my own.&nbsp;&nbsp;The nephew patted me on the arm and laughed at me.&nbsp; And I was moved by the welling of maternal instinct.&nbsp; And I was terrified.&nbsp; But fortunately, the child then started shaking the sippy cup all over and formula struck me in the face and I came to my senses.&nbsp; And I saw the lovely mixture of cookie and baby drool all over my arm.  &nbsp;  Kari never made it to dinner.&nbsp; I fed the child a disgusting thing called Vegetable Beef baby food that was orange and frightening.&nbsp; And there was the wrestling for the bowl because Josh wanted to play with it more than he wanted to eat.&nbsp; And, I am ashamed to admit, he won the wrestling match briefly.&nbsp; And then I was smeared with orange goop.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  We ordered pizza and I was left alone with the child for approximately 20 minutes while Kari picked it up.&nbsp; And the child did not explode, set himself on fire or cry excessively for the Mom.&nbsp; I feel quite pleased with myself.&nbsp; I'm still waiting for him to be six and reading Shakespeare but there are moments when I look at him and I think I understand why people become parents voluntarily.&nbsp; These small things, they're really kind of cute.

      I have a confession to make.&nbsp; I am&nbsp;fashion challenged.&nbsp; I don't get Prada.&nbsp; I don't have a clue to what the difference is between Vogue or Cosmo.&nbsp; I think that models really need to just eat something.&nbsp; I love my job and the fact that I can easily come to work every day wearing jeans and a t-shirt.&nbsp; I am wearing, right now, brown sandals, a red t-shirt and blue leggings.&nbsp; I know, deep inside somewhere, that this is terribly wrong but I just don't care.&nbsp; I wear these shoes with everything.&nbsp; They are perfect.&nbsp; Do you know how hard it is to find a pair of flat, closed toe sandals?&nbsp; Do you?&nbsp; I refuse to bare my toes.&nbsp; They are ugly and deformed and topped with toenails from hell.&nbsp;  &nbsp; The most money I have ever paid for a pair of shoes was $40.&nbsp; This is an obscene amount of money to pay for shoes.&nbsp; Do you know how many books I could get for that money?&nbsp; But I was desperate.&nbsp; The pair of cheap cotton sandals lost a vital part of their sole at work one day and were causing me horrendous pain with every step I took.&nbsp; I ended up making an emergency trip through the skyway to Daytons&nbsp;to check out their shoe department.&nbsp; Imagine my horror when I discovered that every single pair of sandals they had were open toe.&nbsp; And these were the&nbsp;only attractive&nbsp;pair I found.&nbsp;  urlLink Steve Madden , on sale for $40.&nbsp;  On sale .&nbsp; Meaning that people actually sometimes paid more than $40.&nbsp; I still can't comprehend this.&nbsp; I still have them somewhere, two years later,&nbsp;and they still are in good condition.&nbsp; I could easily wear them tomorrow.&nbsp; I just won't. &nbsp; Reasons why I will not wear my perfectly good pair of Steve Madden shoes:   I would need to paint my toenails.&nbsp; I am nail polish challenged as well.  I have extremely ugly toenails that polish cannot cover completely.  The shoes make this highly annoying slapping sound whenever I walk.&nbsp;   Because there is not a strap to keep the shoes on, I have a tendency to walk out of them.&nbsp; And then I fall down.&nbsp;    I will admit to paying $30 apiece for two pairs of Converse High Tops.&nbsp; But they were cute (and cover my toenails) and doesn't everyone need a pair of hot pink high top shoes?&nbsp;   Oh, I have a brown purse and a black coat.&nbsp; Don't you just want to send the fashion police after me?

        urlLink Dooce .&nbsp; No clue how to pronounce it but my God, this woman is hilarious.&nbsp; I have not the slightest clue where I found her, either from One Good Thing or Frog's Blog but I am ever so glad that I have.&nbsp; If you have a completely irreverant sense of humor, you will enjoy this.  In other news, Beth and I have decided to start a joint blog about some of the customers we come across as we pursue our careers in the banking field.&nbsp; It's called  urlLink Out of the Mouths of Morons  and will include conversations that we've been a part of, been told or overheard.&nbsp; Not all of the stories will be banking related, we'll use this as a place to put some of the stuff we hear when we are out and about.&nbsp; Hope you enjoy it.

      After singing "I Don't Know Why" (Norah Jones) at karaoke, I said to Beth and Matt "I don't think that was completly sucky.  Not that I would know because you guys would applaud if I stood up there naked and set myself on fire."  Beth responded with "We would not!  We would run up there and throw water on you."  She paused and then laughed.  "Then we would applaud."

      To summarize our story so far, gentle reader, Beth and Dana are at karaoke.  To sing and revel in all things karaoke by drinking refreshing beverages of pop.  Beth is wearing a low-cut red t-shirt which apparently is like waving the proverbial red flag to a bull...in other words, the drunks are swarming.  LR stands for Liverpool Rummy.  GR stands for Gin Rummy.  To continue where I left off, we have continued our card game when a stocky and obviously drunk man throws himself onto the chair that Beth has placed her purse on.  Fortunately, she manages to rescue it before he crushes it.  "What are we playing?" he asks.  "LR," Beth sighs.  "GR?" Drunk Boy asks.  "No, LR."  "Deal me in," Drunk Boy demands.  Beth and I exchange a glance.  You know the glance, you've probably used it yourself before.  It's the one that says "Oh, dear God, where are these people coming from?  Why are they bothering us?  Why don't I have a gun?"  Drunk Boy emphatically slams his beer glass on the table.  "Deal me in.  We're playing here."  Beth very politely tries to reason with Drunk Boy.  She explains that we're in the middle of a game but he will hear none of that.  Finally Beth and I exchange another glance, the "let's humor him and maybe he will go away."    Beth deals the cards and tells us we'll go for 2 sets of 3, rightly assuming that Drunk Boy doesn't have a clue how to play LR and thinks we are actually playing GR, even though we have explained that we're playing LR.  But we're women and what do we know, right?  He's a manly man and he's there to prove that he knows ever so much more than us (yes, I'm being sarcastic.  What gave it away?).  I'm not going to go into detail about how to  urlLink play LR .  The simplest explanation is that it's very similar to Phase 10.  And no one knows how to play it, let alone has ever heard of it.  Drunk Boy introduces himself as Jordan.  Beth and I introduce ourselves.  And now, it's time for the question.  That ever important question.  Jordan asks Beth if she is single.  However, she hears him say "Are you singing?"  She replies with "Yes."  He then asks me if I am single.  Oddly enough, I actually hear him correctly (oddly because I rarely ever hear anything correctly) and say "No."  This is when Beth realizes she has made a vital mistake.  "Oh, I'm sorry.  I thought you asked if I was singing.  Did you ask if I was single?"  Jordan replies in the affirmative.  "I'm sorry.  No, I'm not single."  "That's too bad," Jordan says. "I wanted to fix one of you up with my friend, Chris."  He then gets up and leaves for a minute.    Beth turns to me and says quickly "If anyone asks, Matt is my boyfriend."  I nod.  I understand.  Jordan soon returns and the hilarity continues...hilarious if you enjoy trying to explain the rules to LR to a drunk man and then watching him completely screw up the game, while he subtly flirts with you.  Here's an example.  After Jordan tells us that he's gone out (because, remember, he's a manly man and knows that we're actually playing GR, even though we think we're playing LR), Beth explains to him that he's wrong.  He has several jokers and deuces in his hand and she explains that those are wild cards.  A few minutes later, Jordan says to Beth (and I quote because let's face it, I couldn't make this stuff up) "Jokers and deuces are wild, like you, right?"  Beth laughs in his face subtly.  He doesn't realize it.  In order to reinforce the fiction that Beth and I are not sex-crazed single nymphs, I start a conversation with Beth about whether or not Matt will be joining us for karaoke and how Beth and Matt have been together for 3 years.  Beth tells me he is going to try to make it.  I then mention how much I miss my boyfriend and try to think desperately of a name.  I know!  Randall after Stephen King's Randall Flagg because hey, if you're going to invent a boyfriend, why not a powerful one like the devil?  Gosh, Randall and I have been together for six months.    Beth runs outside to make a quick phone call to Matt.  Apparently her conversation went something like this.  Scott, Matt's boyfriend, answers the phone.  Beth says to him "Please, for the love of God, please will one of you come up here and be my boyfriend?  I wore the wrong shirt and all the drunks are hitting on me."  Scott says "I don't know if I can pull that off.  Matt!  You're going to karaoke."  So at least Beth's fake boyfriend will be played by a bald Italian stud...I'm still stuck with the devil and he doesn't seem to be manifesting.  Story of my life.  Bryan has shown up and has been informed about Beth and my new romantic status.  He is agreeable to the deception.  This is yet another thing that is great about Bryan...he's very laid back.  Since karaoke is starting, we put the cards away.  Jordan wants to know why.  Beth explains that we're here for karaoke.  There aren't a lot of people here tonight so fortunately, Beth and I will be singing a lot...less time to spend with Jordan.    Shortly after, the friend, Chris, who Beth and I have now lost out on the joy of being set up with, shows up at our table.  Oh, joy.  Jordan keeps leaving to flirt with three women in the back and Chris makes conversation with Beth and I, even though we are pretty obviously watching the other people singing.  He informs us that Jordan and he know all about us now.  They talked to the pull tab lady who explained we come here for karaoke and all we do is sing and drink our pop.  You would think they would get the hint, right?  No.  Because, as the following conversations will show you, Jordan and Chris are not brain surgeons.  In fact, I'm not sure they have brains.   Conversations with Chris:  Chris (To Beth):  How old are you?   Beth:  I'm 25. Chris:  You are?  (Beth thinks "What?  25's not that old.")  Chris (To Beth, 2nd time):  How old are you? Beth:  I'm 25. Chris:  Only?  (Beth now thinks "Now I don't look 25?"  Chris (To Beth, 3rd time):  How old are you? Beth:  I'm 25. Chris:  Oh, yeah.  I'm 27.  (A minute passes.)  Guess how old I am. Beth:  27. Chris:  Oh.  You're drinking pop so you can remember.  (Grabs onto beer glass and starts sloshing it around.  Beer starts splashing onto the table.)  I'm not drunk or anything.  I'm not spilling my beer.  Chris (to me):  How old are you? Me:  I'm 37. Chris:  No, you're not.   Me:  Yes, I am. Chris:  No.  You can't be. Me:  Well, I am. Chris:  You don't look 37. Me:  Thank you. Chris:  Are you sure? Me:  Yes. Chris:  You can't be. Me:   I am.     Chris (to Beth):  Do you have kids? Beth:  No. Chris (to me):  Do you have kids? Me:  No, thankfully. Chris:  Why not?  You need to have a kid. Me (Rises up from the table and bludgeons him to death.  Okay, no I didn't.  I managed to restrain myself but read  urlLink this  if you want to know why this drives me crazy when random strangers tell me I should have a kid):  I don't want one. Chris:  Oh, it's different when you have your own.  I have a kid.  Me:  That's nice. Chris:  You should have a kid. Me:  No.  (Why is it you can never think of the perfect response until the next day.  I came up with "Why?  Are you offering to impregnate me?"  Beth thought I could say "Hey, Beth, can I have the keys to your car?  Chris is going to knock me up.")   Conversation with Jordan and Chris while Beth was singing:  Jordan:  We're sitting at the table with the hot chicks (Okay, if you look at my profile picture, you can imagine that I'm rarely called a hot chick.  I recognize this as a ploy.  I'm not stupid.  Calling me a hot chick does not make me want to sleep with you.  Or encourage Beth to sleep with you.  Jackass).  She (to Chris, indicating me) likes me better than you.  She said you were ugly. Me:  Uh, no, I didn't. Chris (to Jordan):  She did?  (to me)  You think I'm ugly? Jordan (to Chris):  Yeah, she thinks you're mother-f*ckin' ugly.  She told me. Me:  Well, apparently drinking has made you psychic as well.    Conversation with Jordan and Chris while someone else was singing:  Jordan (coming back to the table):  I hate fat chicks (I just look at him.  What am I going to say?  I hate drunks?  Why stoop to his level)!  Will you go show them (the three women in the back) what a real hot chick looks like?  Go flaunt your stuff? Me:  No (because hello, I outweigh each one of these women). Chris:  I can show them what some real boobs look like (He proceeds to smash every ounce of fat and muscle on his chest together to form fake boobs.  This is  so  attractive.  Beth and I are consumed with lust).  Sadly, Jordan was soon kicked out of the bar for annoying the three women in the back.  Beth and I were distraught.  Chris did apologize to me for Jordan but, as I told him, I don't judge people by their friends.  He seemed like a nice enough guy, just drunk and traveling with his very own jackass.  That's pretty much it.  Beth has decided that she's going to burn the red shirt...or at least, never wear it to a bar again.  Matt did make it, about five minutes after Jordan and Chris left.  We did have a good time, got to sing a lot and, most importantly, I got good blogging material.  And hey, I found out that, apparently, I'm a hot chick.  I'm so thrilled.

      On Sunday, Beth and I made our pilgrimage to the House of Bryan (The Chalet in Roseville).  Here is our tale of karaoke, cards and random (fictional) boyfriends.  Beth and I arrived at karaoke early tonight.  To pass the time until karaoke started (our only reason for stepping foot into a bar), we started playing cards.  A fairly attractive gentleman (okay, I could only see him from behind so I have no real clue how he looked.  Apparently, he did have a bit of a gap between his front teeth.  All I saw was tall, dark hair, fairly nice rear) approaches Beth.  "Hi," he addresses her breasts. "What are you playing?"  Now, granted, Beth is very pretty, is wearing a low cut red t-shirt and does (I am speaking only as a straight woman (who sags)) have a nice rack.  But still, this is no reason to stare at her chest for the duration of the conversation.  "Liverpool Rummy (LR for the remainder of this post)," Beth says politely, trying to meet his eyes (which is difficult, since they have popped out of his sockets and are now buried in her cleavage).  "Gin Rummy (GR for the remainder, yeah, you understand)?" Cleavage Boy says.  "No, LR." This confuses him.  He decides to change the subject.  "My name is Joe."  "I'm Beth."  He shakes her hand.  Now, there is a rule in bar (and attempted bar) pickups.  If you are trying to establish yourself as a kind, sensitive man worthy of a one-night stand, you should acknowledge the dumpy friend of the hot redhead you're hoping to screw.  He partially turns to me and I introduce myself, knowing full well he will forget my name in two seconds.  "That's my friend, Doris." He points to a blonde waiting by the bar, establishing that he can't be all that bad because he has a female friend.  He then turns to Beth again. "Will you sing a song with me later?"  "Maybe," Beth tells him. "What song?"  "Summer Nights or Picture?" Beth laughs and looks at me because she knows how I feel about Picture (and you can too if you click on this  urlLink link ).  "Sure," she says. "I'll think about it."  "Well, you don't have to be scared."  Beth is puzzled by this remarks and repeats that she'll think about it again.  Joe agrees to come over later, once karaoke has started.    A few minutes later, Doris comes over and pulls up a chair.  "Hi.  What are you playing?"  "LR," Beth replies.  "Oh."  Doris has no clue what this is but she quickly moves to her objective. "My buddy really likes you," she says to Beth. "Would you go out with him?"  I have to hand it to Beth.  Instead of laughing hysterically at the thought of dating someone who obviously will never acknowledge her as anything but a nice set of jugs, she instead politely says "Well, I don't know him."  Doris laughs giddily. "This is just like high school, isn't it?  I told him it was just like high school."  Then she moves in for the kill, that all important question.  "Are you seeing anyone?"  "Yes," Beth lies.  "Oh.  Okay."  Doris retreats to her friend to break the news to him.  He is obviously dejected because they leave shortly.    Beth and I return to our card game.  But the power of Beth's breasts is strong and so another male breaks from the pack of drunken wildebeests populating the bar.  To be continued, I have to go back to work.

      Yes, yes, I know I'm behind.&nbsp; It's all TV Guide's fault.&nbsp;   I should probably explain that, huh?&nbsp; So TV Guide is mailed to you about a week in advance.&nbsp; So I got the issue, started reading it (not noticing that I was on the wrong week) and noticed that there was a Last Comic Standing article.&nbsp; You can imagine the excitement at the table when I mentioned this to Keem, especially since it was Tuesday night and LCS would appear on our TV.&nbsp;   DM:&nbsp; Ooh, Keem, look...Last Comic Standing article!   Keem:&nbsp; Oh, cool.&nbsp; I want to read it after you.   DM:&nbsp; Ooh, look.&nbsp; John Heffron.&nbsp; He pretty.   Keem:&nbsp; I like Gary Gulman, he's very cute.   DM:&nbsp; Ooh, shiny picture of Alonzo Bodden.&nbsp; I like.&nbsp; He pretty as well.&nbsp; I lick picture now.&nbsp;(Okay, no, I did not lick the article...but Alonzo Bodden is hot.&nbsp; Freakin' Hot!)&nbsp; Ick.&nbsp; Corey Holcomb.&nbsp; He annoy me.&nbsp; Take article away.&nbsp; Bad article.   Keem:&nbsp; Wait, why are there only six of them?&nbsp; Tammy and Kathleen are here but who's missing?&nbsp;   This is when we discovered that we were on the wrong week and that our beloved Jay London&nbsp;would obviously be leaving the house.&nbsp; We were sad.&nbsp; There were tears involved.&nbsp; I was almost too depressed to watch LCS.&nbsp; I still did, of course, because, hello, Alonzo Bodden and John Heffron?&nbsp; Not going to miss them.   Jay went up against Gary and they were both hilarious...it's just that Jay's sense of humor is witty and bright and (why do I want to break out into song (I feel pretty, oh, so pretty, I feel pretty and witty and bright))&nbsp;not everyone gets it.&nbsp; Not all people are fans of one-liners.&nbsp; While Gary tells humorous stories and more people got it, I guess.&nbsp; Sigh.   And last week, well, my dream came true.&nbsp; Corey Holcomb is gone.&nbsp; Hahahahahaha!&nbsp; Now, that's funny!&nbsp;   There was the reality show twist of bringing back all of the comics that had been voted off back.&nbsp; These comics wouldn't perform, had no chance of winning but they did get to vote to see who would go into the head to head that night.&nbsp; Bonnie McFarlane made some comment about how hard this was for her because she hated everyone.&nbsp; Please.&nbsp; Let's hold a grudge because it's just a game!&nbsp;   So the decision was made, John Heffron against Corey Holcomb.&nbsp; And then Jay Mohr comes out with another twist (stupid reality shows with all of their twists) and it's a three headed head to head.&nbsp; Alonzo Bodden is up on the chopping block as well.&nbsp; I am now seriously annoyed because if one of my boys loses, I will be very, very upset.&nbsp;   Jeff wandered into the living room to watch with us&nbsp;earlier.&nbsp; He's not so much of a stand up comic fan but it was on and he wanted to spend some quality time with us as well.&nbsp; So he was there when I made the following comment (please do not read this, Mom.&nbsp; You don't want to know this) "I think Gary and John and Alonzo should all win.&nbsp; And then they should pour oil on each other."&nbsp;   Keem replied with "Dana!&nbsp; Please, keep your fantasies to yourself."&nbsp; But she was eyeing up Gary and thinking about the butter in the kitchen.&nbsp; I know her.&nbsp; And yay!&nbsp; Alonzo and John trounced Corey's ass because he proved what I knew all along...he's only got two funny jokes and he didn't bother to tell either.&nbsp;   I look forward to Tuesday.   Oh, Jay Mohr was doing his usual stand up moment before the comics came out at the head to head.&nbsp; He was talking about how it's almost impossible to hit a bird and then, one day, he's driving down the road with a buddy and they're having a theological debate and Jay says something to the effect of "Well, I'm not really sure that there is a God."&nbsp; And suddenly, he hits a bird.&nbsp; He and his buddy are freaked out.&nbsp; And he leaves it at that.&nbsp;   Keem laughs and says "Jay, God flipped you the bird.&nbsp; Pay attention."&nbsp; Do you see how funny she is?&nbsp; Do you see why I want her to blog?&nbsp; Would other people start asking her to blog because she's threatening me with a blog-harrassment suit?

       Disclaimer:&nbsp; If you haven't read   urlLink  Part One    or   urlLink  Part Two    yet, you may want to&nbsp;do that first.&nbsp;&nbsp;Otherwise, you are not going to get the&nbsp;whole effect of how it's really hard to&nbsp;write without pronouns... &nbsp;   A year had gone by.&nbsp; Jack and Jon were graduating and were nervous about the fact that both sets of parents were going to visit at the same time for the first time.&nbsp; Jack and Jon had spent a lot of time discussing this moment and had decided that this was the perfect moment to inform their parents of the truth - Jack and Jon weren't just roommates, they were lovers.&nbsp;   Jon was extremely&nbsp;nervous.&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack relaxed on the couch, watching as Jon&nbsp;paced back and forth in the apartment, adjusting a lampshade,&nbsp;dusting the coffee table for the&nbsp;12th time, fluffing their cat's fur... "Jon, settle down.&nbsp; It's going to be okay."   "You don't know that.&nbsp; You don't know how my parents are going to react to the news...your parents hate me."   "No, they don't.&nbsp; Dad told me how much he likes you.&nbsp; Relax.&nbsp; Come on, sit down.&nbsp; What's the worst that could happen?"   "Well, they could storm out of here and never speak to us again..."   "And if that happens, we'll deal with it.&nbsp; I really don't think that either of our parents are going to disown us.&nbsp; They might be upset but they love us.&nbsp; I'm sure that they'll be accepting."   "You're right.&nbsp; It'll be fine," Jon said, finally taking Jack's hand and sitting on the couch.&nbsp; Then, the doorbell rang.&nbsp; "Oh, my God, they're here!"&nbsp; Jon ran to the door and pulled it open.   "There's my baby!"&nbsp; Jon's mother, Dorothy,&nbsp;cried, rushing in the door to embrace her child.&nbsp; "I've missed you so much!"&nbsp; She turned to Jack.&nbsp; "Hello, Jack, how are you doing?"   "I'm good, ma'am.&nbsp; It's a pleasure to see you again."&nbsp; Jack rose&nbsp;from the couch to&nbsp;shake Dorothy's hand.&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did you need me to see to your luggage?"&nbsp;   "Oh, no.&nbsp; Andy's just parking the car and will bring it up.&nbsp; Will&nbsp;we finally be meeting your parents today, Jack?"   "Yes, they should be here momentarily."&nbsp; There was a knock on the door and Jon answered, ushering in&nbsp;another woman&nbsp;and two men.&nbsp; "Let's do the introductions.&nbsp; Andy and Dorothy, these are my parents.&nbsp; Larry and Jamie."&nbsp; The two sets of parents exchanged&nbsp;greetings, glad to finally meet.&nbsp; "Jon, is dinner ready?"   "Yes, Jack.&nbsp; Let's go into the dining room and eat.&nbsp;&nbsp;And then Jack and I have something we want to&nbsp;tell you."   After dinner, Jon stood up and turned to Andy and Dorothy.&nbsp; "There is something I have been hiding from you and I've decided that it's not fair to you to continue lying.&nbsp; I hope that you can forgive me for not including you in what has been a major decision in my life."   "What is it, baby?" Dorothy asked,&nbsp;clutching Andy's hand.&nbsp; "Are you&nbsp;okay?&nbsp; Is there something wrong?"   "Yes, Jon, you know you can tell us anything,"&nbsp;Andy said.&nbsp; "We love you and will stand by you, no matter what."&nbsp; Jon smiled at them and turned to Jack.   "I also have to confess something," Jack said.&nbsp;"I've also been living a lie and feel that it's time to come forward and hope that you'll be accepting."   Larry leaned forward.&nbsp;"You're my kid, Jack.&nbsp; I love you and I'm always going to be there for you.&nbsp; Nothing you could tell me would make me stop loving you."&nbsp; Jamie echoed Larry's sentiment.   Jack and Jon stood in the middle of the room.&nbsp; Jack&nbsp;took Jon's hand.&nbsp; "Okay, here goes.&nbsp; Pop, Dad, I'm in love with Jon."   Jon smiled at Jack. "Mom, Mumsy, I'm in love with Jack."&nbsp; Dorothy burst into tears and Andy leaned over to console her.&nbsp; "Oh, Mumsy, it's okay.&nbsp; Please don't cry."   Andy looked up.&nbsp; "Jonna, I don't know what to say.&nbsp; I never expected this from you.&nbsp; What happened to Sandy?&nbsp; I thought you were still together."   "I know you did, Mom," Jon said.&nbsp; "But Sandy and I weren't right for each other.&nbsp; I realized that when I met Jack.&nbsp; Will you accept our relationship?"&nbsp;   Meanwhile, Larry and Jamie were talking to Jack.&nbsp;"I don't understand, Jack.&nbsp; What about Alex?&nbsp; I thought you were serious about each other?"&nbsp;Larry asked.   "I'm sorry, Dad.&nbsp; Alex and I broke up over a year ago.&nbsp; I was just afraid to tell you.&nbsp; I didn't think you'd understand," Jack replied.   "Well, all I care about is your happiness, son," Jamie said, taking Jack's hand.&nbsp;"I just hope you realize how tough this decision is going to be for you."   Larry was still shook by his son's decision.&nbsp;"Jack, are you sure about this?&nbsp; I know that people experiment when they're in college.&nbsp; Hell, I&nbsp;even fooled around a few times."&nbsp; He caught the look that his husband gave him.&nbsp; "Jamie, I told you about that.&nbsp; I was drunk.&nbsp; It didn't mean anything.&nbsp; Jack, really, have you thought this through?"   "I'm sorry, Dad.&nbsp; I'm sure.&nbsp; I love Jonna and I want to spend the rest of my life with her.&nbsp; I just hope you can accept the fact that&nbsp;we're straight.&nbsp; We know that it's going to be difficult and that a lot of people won't understand.&nbsp; We know that we may never be able to legally get married or that our children won't be considered both of our children by the government.&nbsp; But this is who we are.&nbsp; And we're not going to change that just because society just doesn't understand that not everyone in this world is gay.&nbsp; There are straight people in this world and eventually the government is going to have to start giving us equal rights."   "You're right, son.&nbsp; I guess I just never thought about the laws before.&nbsp; It never affected me before,"&nbsp;Jamie said, pulling his son into a tight embrace.&nbsp;"Welcome to the family, Jonna."   &nbsp;  Author's Note - About 12 years ago, I lived in Madison, Wisconsin, on the politically correct side of town (predominately gay) and saw a bumper sticker that read "When did you first learn you were straight?"&nbsp; It always sat in the back of my head.&nbsp; Lately, with the fight for gay rights, it's been on my mind a lot.&nbsp;   The other thing that made me come up with this story is a conversation Beth and I had the other day when we discussed how our parents brought us up...you can see Beth's thoughts on the subject on her blog (conveniently linked to the right) and I will post how my Dad creatively elected to make sure that I never grew up to be a bigot soon.  Anyway, I hope you enjoyed reading this...even though it&nbsp;is so far from being the best thing I have ever written.&nbsp; Did&nbsp;I mention how hard it is to write without pronouns?&nbsp; And if you think my story is far-fetched, well, obviously you've never watched the Twilight Zone, Mork and Mindy and Finnegan's Rainbow.&nbsp;

      Jon finally decided that the worst thing that could possibly happen is that Jack would reject Jon's advances.&nbsp; A phone call was made to Jack, asking to meet that evening at the library.&nbsp; Jack agreed, later telling Alex about a fictional test would be taking place the next day.   Jack approached the table where Jon was waiting.&nbsp; Both Jack and Jon noticed silently the preparation that each other had taken for this meeting.&nbsp; Both had rejected their usual uniform of jeans and t-shirts normally worn for an all-night study session and instead, were&nbsp;dressed up.&nbsp; Jack pulled out a chair and sat down.   "You wanted to talk?" Jack asked quietly.   "Yes.&nbsp; I have something I need to ask you...but maybe we should go somewhere else?" Jon whispered.   "Okay.&nbsp; I brought my car tonight," Jack replied.&nbsp; "I thought maybe we could grab something to eat later, off campus.&nbsp; Where should we go?"   Jon stood up.&nbsp; "I know a spot where we can talk without being interrupted.&nbsp; I'll give you directions."   An hour later, Jack pulled the car off to the side of the lake.&nbsp; "This is really out of the way.&nbsp; How did you find this place?"   "Sandy used to bring me out here.&nbsp; No one else comes out here, I guess.&nbsp; Maybe this is a bad idea, we can go somewhere else if you..."&nbsp; Jon stopped talking when Jack slowly reached out and picked up Jon's hand.   "I don't want to go anywhere else.&nbsp; This is fine," Jack said.&nbsp; "You said we needed to &nbsp;talk."   "I think you're right."&nbsp; Jon swiveled in the seat to face Jack.&nbsp; "I don't know how to say this.&nbsp; I'm really worried about how you're going to react to this and I'm afraid it's going to ruin our friendship but...I...well, I have feelings for you that go beyond friendship.&nbsp; I'm, well, I'm really attracted to you."&nbsp; Jon said the last two sentences in a rush, worried about Jack's reaction.   Jack smiled in relief.&nbsp; "Oh, God, I thought for sure you were going to tell me you didn't want to see me anymore.&nbsp; I'm crazy about you, Jon.&nbsp; I think of you all the time.&nbsp; I broke up with Alex last night because I just couldn't fake my interest anymore."   Jon felt tears of joy well up.&nbsp; "I have wanted to do this for awhile, I just hid my feelings from myself and from you."&nbsp; Jon reached out and touched Jack's face softly.&nbsp; They leaned in to each other and kissed for the first time.&nbsp; It was the most magical experience either of them had ever had, different from what they were both used to with their former lovers.&nbsp; The kiss became more passionate and then Jack pulled away and began to rain kisses all over Jon's face.   "I love you, Jack," Jon said softly.&nbsp; "I think I have from when we first met."   Jack pulled back.&nbsp; "I love you too, Jon.&nbsp; What are we going to do?"&nbsp;   Jon knew that Jack wasn't talking about how they would consumate their love for each other.&nbsp; Both Jon and Jack knew how society reacted to what was considered taboo relationships.&nbsp; The name calling, the hate letters...the news would report stories of violence&nbsp;in some cases in which a couple had been discovered.&nbsp; By declaring their love for each other, they were taking a serious risk.&nbsp; "Maybe we can keep it quiet?&nbsp; I don't know what else to do...No one should have any problem with us being seen as friends.&nbsp; We just have to be careful."   "Maybe we could get an apartment together off campus next semester and say we're roommates?"&nbsp; Jack asked.&nbsp; "That is, if you would want to..."   "Live with you?&nbsp; Be with you all the time?&nbsp; I would love that.&nbsp; We better get a two bedroom, though.&nbsp; I don't think my family would be ready for this yet."&nbsp; Jon snuggled up to Jack, pulling Jack in for another kiss.&nbsp; "I am.&nbsp; I am very ready for what the future brings."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      Jack and Jon met when they were in college.&nbsp; One night at the library,&nbsp;Jack was working on a report for Abnormal Psych and Jon was studying for a test in Advanced Chem.&nbsp; Jack asked to borrow a pencil from Jon.&nbsp; A simple start to what ended up being a three hour conversation on everything and anything and coffee at the local diner.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no thought of romance in the beginning.&nbsp; Jack was dating a very nice nurse, Alex,&nbsp;and Jon was seeing a cheerleader named Sandy.&nbsp; They became friends&nbsp;and liked to get together to talk and just hang out.  &nbsp;  Then&nbsp;Sandy wanted a commitment and started screaming when Jon admitted that their future together was&nbsp;not the most important thing on Jon's mind.&nbsp; Jon realized that continuing to see&nbsp;Sandy&nbsp;was not going to work out, there was too much drama and not enough intelligence to keep Jon's interest.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Jack and Jon made plans to meet the next night but Jack never showed up.&nbsp; When Jon ran into Jack at the library a few days later, Jack pretended that nothing was wrong and tried to brush Jon off.&nbsp; Jon pressed for more information and Jack&nbsp;muttered something about the nurse, Alex,&nbsp;was jealous of the amount of time Jack and Jon spent together.&nbsp;&nbsp;Alex was threatening to&nbsp;to start rumors about Jack and Jon's involvement.&nbsp; Jon laughed it off and made a comment about "What is Alex so worried about?&nbsp; We're just friends."   Jack muttered "I know.&nbsp; That's what I said."&nbsp; But something about Jack's tone and the faint blush made Jon realize that, just maybe, Jack&nbsp;didn't think of Jon as just a friend.&nbsp; Jack quickly changed the subject and left soon after.   That night, Jon lay in bed and thought about what had happened.&nbsp; What had gone wrong with Sandy, honestly?&nbsp; Was it the fact that Sandy was too dramatic and annoying or was it really the fact that Jon wasn't attracted to Sandy?&nbsp; The more Jon thought about it, the more the realization came.&nbsp; Jon had started dating Sandy out of convenience and had never been fully into the relationship.&nbsp; When Jack had come along, it was so much easier for Jon to blow off Sandy to spend time with Jack.&nbsp; Jon drifted off to sleep and had the strangest dream.   In the dream, Jon was lying in bed with Jack.&nbsp; Even though Jon had always just thought of Jack as a friend, in the dream, they were kissing one another.&nbsp; And it felt right, it felt wonderful.&nbsp; Jon woke up realizing that Jack wasn't just a friend, Jack was the love of Jon's life.&nbsp; But what to do?&nbsp; Society had just not come around to the idea of accepting this kind of relationship.&nbsp; And, honestly, how did Jack feel?&nbsp; A faint blush wasn't really a declaration of love.&nbsp; What was Jon going to do?&nbsp; If Jack didn't feel the same way, Jon was going to be very embarrassed...or possibly beaten to a bloody pulp if Jack reacted in an unfavorable manner.

       urlLink Alas, a blog  has a very good point today about what would make it fair if the government continues to oppose gay marriage.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I realized the other day, while reading  urlLink frog's blog , that I don't speak about this often enough.&nbsp; As a heterosexual, I have a responsibility to my gay brethren and sistren (I don't think&nbsp;that's actually a word but I like it) to shout from the rooftops my support for their struggle.&nbsp;    I wish that everyone who has ever been discriminated against would join in the fight.&nbsp; And, honestly, if you really think about it, haven't we all been discriminated against?&nbsp; Let's look at the highlights here, people:   I'm a woman.&nbsp; I have been discriminated against by people who do not feel that I can do the same job as a man for the same pay.&nbsp; Fortunately, I no longer work for this person but there are a lot of women who still deal with this crap everyday.  I'm overweight.&nbsp; Yes, this is my problem to deal with but I&nbsp;had an employer who told me I was lucky that he hired me because who else would want to hire a fat chick?&nbsp; I have gone on job interviews only to be told I didn't fit in with the rest of the office (all model thin and perfect looking).   If you have ever been discriminated against, please look into your heart and ask yourself "How did it feel when I was rejected based on my gender or the color of my skin or what I look like?"&nbsp; If you're anything like me, it hurt.  What it comes down to, people, is that this is about basic human rights.&nbsp; Everyone should be treated equally.&nbsp; We all know that there are jackasses all over this country who still feel that women should be barefoot and pregnant in the kitchen or that blacks should still not be able to vote or that all Hispanics are lazy.&nbsp; Stereotypes hurt and are wrong and prejudice should not be a part of our constitution.&nbsp;   What it comes down to, people, is that this whole thing is based on what the definition of marriage is...  My Mom told me that marriage was what happened when two people who loved each other decided that they wanted to spend the rest of their lives together.   Two people.&nbsp; Not a man and a woman.&nbsp; Just two people in love that want to be together.&nbsp; That's all we're talking about.&nbsp; Open up your hearts.&nbsp;

         Cuddlers of America, Unite!    &nbsp;  Yesterday I woke up at 5:30 in the morning because of a loud cry from the nephew’s bedroom.&nbsp; Josh was awake…and not happy about it.&nbsp; Can’t say I particularly blamed him, I don’t like being awake as well.&nbsp; Kari came out to the living room, where I was sleeping on the couch, and sent me off to her and Eric’s bed to sleep.&nbsp; About 15 minutes later, Kari crawled into bed with me.&nbsp; This simple act brought back memories of lying in bed with Mom and Kari and cuddling.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  One of the nice things about living with Jeff and Keem is that in two years, we’ve gone from being roommates to extended family.&nbsp; When Jeff is on the computer in Keem’s room, we all seem to gravitate there.&nbsp; He will surf the net and Keem and I will lie on the bed.&nbsp; I have decided that Keem’s back makes a good pillow.&nbsp; There’s nothing sexual about this, I think of Keem as another sister.&nbsp; The three of us will chat about our days and it’s a great way to catch up on what is new.&nbsp; Sometimes Eddy and Bob (the cats) will join us.  &nbsp;  I think more people should cuddle.&nbsp; I think our world would be a better place if we would just take the few minutes to climb onto a soft surface, put our arms around each other and just listen to one another’s heartbeat.&nbsp; Maybe we would realize that our enemies are people just like us…  &nbsp;  Just imagine what could happen if there wasn’t any more hate in this world.&nbsp; I think John Lennon said it best in Imagine.  &nbsp;  You may say I'm a dreamer,  But I'm not the only one,  I hope some day you will join us,  And the world will be as one.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;    Why I tried to smother my sister    &nbsp;  Kari chose to use perfectly good cuddling time to inform (lecture) me of some things she had noticed.&nbsp; Apparently, I snore.&nbsp; Kari and Mom are convinced that I have sleep apnea and Kari and I covered the following topics:      I snore like my father did (very loud).&nbsp;

      My father was an odd, odd man. He had an extremely strange sense of humor and I like to think that I inherited it. Sarcasm mixed with slapstick, tempered by a very dark appreciation for the absurd. Here are some examples of how he molded my tender mind and helped me evolve into the person I am today.   Example Number One:  It's a Saturday afternoon during the late 1970's. Dad has visitation and has picked up Kari and I. He is planning on taking us to a movie, The Muppet Movie. We get to the theater and The Muppet Movie has sold out. What does Dad do? Take us out to eat and bring us to a later showing of The Muppet Movie? No. He buys us tickets to Animal House. I am 12, Kari is 10. This is probably not the best choice for us, right? Well, I can't speak for my sister but I loved Animal House and thought it was hilarious (this probably explains a lot about why I am seriously considering going to see "Harold and Kumar go to White Castle").   Example Number Two:  Staying overnight at Dad's (I'm about 13-14?). I forgot to bring a book. Those of you who have read  urlLink The Fish Hook Saga  are painfully aware of what can happen if I don't have reading material. I come across a book that strikes me as being somewhat interesting. It is called The Happy Hooker. Hmm, perhaps it's about fishing. It is not about fishing, not by a long shot (for those not familiar with the Happy Hooker, her name is Xaveria Hollander and she wrote several books about her life as a prostitute. There's even a movie (which I did see but not because of my father)). It is extremely interesting until my little brat sister narcs on me to Dad. He later tells me he would have let me finish the book but he was afraid Kari would tell Mom.  There are many other things that Dad did which would strike many people as odd parenting choices but I don't have time to list all of them. One of the things you should know about my Dad is that he was extremely brilliant but also, throughout the majority of my childhood, a raving lunatic drunken lush who I observed choking my mother on at least one occasion and, apparently for fun, would throw beer bottles at her. I've blocked out most of my childhood and didn't remember the thing about the beer bottles until Mom was having the dining room remodeled and I was helping her take pictures down. There were all these holes behind the pictures.  "What are these holes from, Mom?" I asked. She looked at me blankly. "You honestly don't remember?" "Uh, no, I wouldn't have asked if I remembered," I said. "Well, that's from when your father would use me as target practice," she said nonchalantly. I have to give my Mom a lot of credit. My Dad was not a good man when he was drinking. She stood by him when he went through treatment several different times, tried to support him and her two children and finally divorced him when I was 13. And even after the divorce, after all the things he had put her through, she rarely ever had a bad word to say about him.  So how did this make me a better person? Good question. One day, during the late 70's, I came home from school with an assignment for one of my classes. I needed to know what nationalities I was descended from. I asked my Dad for help even though I could tell he'd been drinking. I remember watching him weave back and forth in the breezeway, clutching his beer bottle, scribbling down information on the sheet of blank paper. I read what he had written. "German, French, Dutch, Norwegian, Scot-Irish." This was written in normal handwriting. On another line, his handwriting became more bold, slashing against the whiteness of the paper. "Polish. Black. Jackass, on your mother's side."  I knew the Jackass part was a joke but was puzzled about why he had written that I was part Black. He then proceeded to tell me how my great-great-great-great ("I don't know how many greats. It was a long time ago") grandfather had been a slave owner, raped a slave girl and, when she had a son that passed as white, forced his wife to raise the child as her own. He told me about Rosa Parks and gave me his copy of "Black Like Me" by John Howard Griffin. I was probably about 13 or 14 and learning about Civil Rights at the right knee of a man who wouldn't remember our conversation, or, even my name, two hours later.  Because of this new knowledge, I began to hate ethnic jokes. Why did the joke have to be about an American, a Polish person and a French person? Why couldn't it be about three different people, one of which just happened to be dumb? I would listen to the person tell the joke and then, very politely, smile and say "You know, I am part Polish." Inheriting my father's warped sense of humor, I enjoyed watching the person stumble all over themselves apologizing. The same thing worked whenever someone would make remarks about Blacks around me. I would listen to them, smile and say "You know, I am part Black." Shut them up every time.  Because of my Dad, I grew up to believe that you should follow the Golden Rule (do unto others as you would have others do unto you) and stand up for what you believe in. Even when, years later, I found out that he made the whole thing up. I'm not part Polish, I'm not part Black, it was all a ploy to make sure I grew up to treat everyone the same.  After his funeral, my sister, 3 half-sisters and some of my 4 half-brothers got together and were reminiscing about Dad. I brought up the previous story. I remember my half-sister, Suz, laughing as she related the story about how Dad told her and several of our brothers that the reason they loved spaghetti so much was because they were part Italian. Another sister mentioned being told she was part Native American and that was why she liked camping.  I really believe that you treat people the way you learn to treat them. Environment is a big part of learning and your kids watch what you do to find out how they should react. If you're teaching hatred, don't be surprised when your kids start teaching it themselves. My parents set good examples for Kari and I and we will set good examples for Josh and any other child that follows into the family. But I'm glad he made up this elaborate story to bring this situation home just a little bit more. He made me start thinking and researching and wondering about other cultures, other lives. He made me who I am today. I really believe that if he was still alive today, he would be telling Josh about his great-great-great-great grandfather who was gay and that's why Josh is such a snazzy dresser (okay, Josh is 10 months old. He doesn't have any particular tastes yet, I'm just using a very broad example. Kari dresses Josh, that's why he's snazzy. Unless the Vikings are playing, then Eric is in control of the wardrobe).

      Tammy Pescatelli, I'm sorry to be the one to inform you of this but apparently, I am not the only one in the world who wishes to see John, Alonzo and Gary pour oil on each other.  The majority of the searches leading to my blog this week have been looking for pictures of them naked, gay or both and only 1 search request for you.  I'm sorry.  I know how devastating this must be for you.   Last Tuesday wasn't all that exciting for me.  It's the Wild Card episode and so the people who were voted out get a chance to come back and compete again.  I really enjoyed Jay London and Ant's performances but never liked the others that were voted out so I was happy to see Jay London is coming back.  I would have been just as happy if Ant would have been voted back in.   Looking forward to this Tuesday.

       Thanks to Beth for inspiring this post. Be sure to read her post about her blind date. Very funny stuff.   I am a fickle, fickle girl. I always have been...back in high school (many many moons ago), I once had a crush on seven (7) guys during the same week. I had a list. Number 7 was "Boy who held the water fountain for me." I don't think I ever saw him again or knew what his name was.  Anyway, I've always been a bit of a flirt and, sometimes, this can get me into trouble. Or even worse, into a blind date. Something very important to know about me...I have never been in love. I have been in like, in lust and insane but I've never been in love. I don't know if it's a committment problem or what the deal is but while I like men and think they are wonderful (Even though they don't recognize me for the love goddess that I am and worship at my feet, offering to feed me small bites of cheese and brussel sprouts (I don't like grapes)), I never seem to be able to get past that first bit of infatuation and build the lasting relationship.  So my blind date story goes as follows:  I am working at the job from hell. I am the Office Manager or Receptionist (depends on who you talked to) for a small wire distribution in Minnesota. Part of my job is to take orders for wire from other companies. One of these companies has hired a new employee named Malcolm (I have no clue what his name really was, I just love the name Malcolm). Malcolm and I have a great time talking to each other every time he calls.  A few weeks go by and the conversations have progressed from "Hi, Dana, we'd like to order five boxes of wire today" to "What's your favorite color? Are you involved with anyone? And, oh, yeah, I guess we did need some wire, I should probably order that." I was no better, with my questions of "What type of movies do you like? Are you involved with anyone?" instead of "That will come to $75 with shipping and handling."  My co-boss (there were two of them, Satan and his wife (names changed to protect the jackasses. You'll get to read more about them in a later post. They were   great   (yes, that's a sarcastic great))), Marcy was listening to our calls and laughing, encouraging me. Whenever Satan wasn't around, she and I were great friends. This was one of the times that he wasn't there, thank God, he was out in the warehouse screaming at truck drivers for driving too close to his building. She made some comment about him and I replied, "Marcy, if he's half as good looking as he sounds on the phone, he'll be drop dead gorgeous."  The phone rings. I answer it in my chirpy voice "Small Wire Distribution company in Minnesota, this is Dana, how may I help you?"  "Dana, this is Malcolm."  "Oh, hi, Malcolm. Did you need more wire?"  "No, I was wondering if you wanted to get together and do something."  I stare at the phone in shock. I'm being asked out? This never happens (Okay, so this should be my first clue, right? The reason I am never asked out is because the normal, average male is extremely shallow and focuses on appearance. Malcolm has never seen me. He has no clue what I look like and is asking out Fantasy Dana from the sound of my voice.  Of course, I've never seen him either...) . I turn to Marcy and mouth "He just asked me out!" She mouths back "Go for it!" (Well, honestly, it could have easily been "Get back to work!" I'm not known for my accurate lip reading)  "Um, sure," I stammer. (Yeah, way to keep that witty dialouge going there, Dana!) We agree to talk about the details later and I provide him with my home phone number. Later that night, he calls, we talk, I tell him I don't drive, he wonders why, I tell him why (and you can read the posts if you want to know why, they are  urlLink here  and  urlLink here  (although the 2nd post didn't happen until last year)), he laughs and we agree to get together that weekend to play mini golf. Which, laugh all you want, is actually not a bad idea. It gives you a chance to talk and get to know each other and there's no pressure, you can have a good time and play a game and have fun. I am looking forward to my date with Malcolm. I spend the rest of the week obsessing over what I am going to wear and drag my friends out shopping.  Saturday night appears. I am ready with my new black blazer (very slimming, because, while I haven't reached the full round voluptous stature of the love goddess I am today, I was working on it.), gold (sparkly!) top and black pants. My hair is styled, I am wearing make-up. I look good. Well, good for me. And, yes, I realize I'm being hard on myself but when you're the type of girl who is referred to as "having a great personality," it's hard not to be.  There is a knock on the door. I pull the door open. And then, here is where the title comes in. I can tell by looking at Malcolm that he's not overly thrilled comparing the real me to the fantasy me.  I am not thrilled by the real Malcolm compared to the fantasy Malcolm (Although, in my defense, I have always been attracted to men that other women don't find attractive.  I'll post on that in a day or two).  Call me crazy, but I have a hard time getting turned on by men who are 3 to 5 inches shorter than me, especially since I'm 5'4".  Of course, it's obvious Malcolm was probably not expecting me to be as zaftig as I was.  I will give him, actually both of us, credit.  Instead of saying "No way in hell," we made the most of the date.  We went to play mini golf, it was fun, we enjoyed talking to each other.  There was absolutely no chemistry.  He drove me home and here is where I lost all respect for him.  We are sitting in the car, talking and I, being polite, invite him upstairs for a drink.  He makes this big show of looking at his watch and saying "Oh, is that the time?  I promised a friend I'd meet them in Minneapolis at midnight."  May I just say "Riiiiiighhhht" to that?  It was 11:50.  I didn't call him on it, though, I had been hoping he'd say no anyway.  We said good night, he left, I went upstairs.   On Monday, Marcy wanted to know all of the details.  As I was filling her in, the phone rings.  It's someone from the company Malcolm works at, Julie.  While I'm taking the order, she casually asks me a question.  "So, how did your date go with Malcolm, Dana?"  "You knew about that?" I ask.  "Yeah, he was telling everyone about it, earlier this week."  "Why didn't you ask him?"  "Oh, I suppose he wouldn't tell you.  We fired him on Friday.  He was stealing from us," Julie says.  My mouth drops open.  I finish taking the order and hang up.  So, here's what an overactive imagination got me:  a short, lying, unemployed criminal.  There are some benefits to being overweight - repelling losers and always being a little warm in winter are the only two I've found so far but hey, I'm sure there are others.

       urlLink Frog  talked about this website, titled  urlLink Someone You Know Is Gay .&nbsp; This is a wonderful idea.&nbsp; It is, simply put, a way to remind Americans that we each probably know someone who is gay.&nbsp; If we&nbsp;admit that we know someone is gay, then maybe it's not so hard to take the next step, to realize that all people should be treated equally and that gays have just as much right to be married.&nbsp; I have signed the pledge.  Maybe you should sign as well.&nbsp; Let's think about it...someone you know is gay.&nbsp; It may be your neighbor, your co-worker, your kid, your parent, your cousin, your friend.

      So Friday I'm on a bus headed out to the Saint Croix river.&nbsp; The Bank of DM (or NABABANA, whichever you prefer) has put together a boat ride for the high performers of last quarter and Beth invited me as her guest.   We're on&nbsp;our way, headed towards Stillwater when I look outside and see this gigantic red truck (ooh, shiny)&nbsp;but it's got&nbsp;an accessory I would never consider&nbsp;putting on my truck (or El Camino, because, hey, if you're going to dream, dream big).   Now,&nbsp;I was raised to treat everyone the same, to not make generalizations, to not prejudge people.&nbsp; And yet, I saw this truck&nbsp;with it's giant American flag with eagle screen printed in the back window (similar to  urlLink this ) and I, I (oh, this pains me to admit it)&nbsp;turned to Beth and made a horrid, horrid remark.   "Why is it that whenever I see something like this, I immediately think F*ckin' Republican?"&nbsp;   I know.&nbsp;&nbsp;I know this is wrong.&nbsp; This person could just be really proud to be an American.&nbsp; They could be an Independant or even a Democrat.&nbsp; And I know that not all Republicans are bad...Some of my friends are Republicans.&nbsp; They're not close friends, well, actually they're more like&nbsp;work friends but still, they're not bad people.&nbsp; Even when they tell me I'm a member of the Loony Left (Why, yes, Donovan, I am talking about you).   I know that not every Republican is a narrow-minded bigot who enjoys a snack of Freedom Fries with a dash of salt and good old  urlLink American ketchup  while trying to take away human rights.&nbsp; Thanks to Alas, a blog for pointing me to this absurdity.&nbsp; I'm just curious.&nbsp; I'm not really a ketchup fan.&nbsp; Does anyone know of a good patriotic mustard I should be using?&nbsp; I'm a  urlLink Plochman's  girl but, oh, wait, their founder emigrated from Germany...I could use  urlLink French's &nbsp;mustard (I have a backup book and yes, I have a backup mustard) but I'd have to start calling it Freedom's mustard.&nbsp;   And&nbsp;I apologize if this offends anyone but I'm sorry,&nbsp;as much as I love America, the whole "Hey, let's plaster the American flag on everything" is getting old.&nbsp; I'm tired of Freedom Fries.&nbsp; I certainly will never be using Wketchup.&nbsp; Don't these people realize how silly they are?&nbsp; I love how one of their comments to someone (on the left) went like this "In addition, we are highly patriotic and wanted a ketchup that all  American's  could agree on. "&nbsp; Aargh!&nbsp; Well, this American hopes you learn when to apostrophe and when not to apostrophe.&nbsp; Dang it!&nbsp; Oh, well, one of the things I believe, as an American, is that everyone has the right to make a fool out of themselves.&nbsp;   Now myself, I'm thinking I'm going to start manufacturing Rainbow Mustard, a portion of the profits will go to the fight for gays and lesbians to be able to legally marry and adopt.&nbsp; Anyone want to help me with the start-up costs?&nbsp; And I probably could use a recipe for mustard while we're at it.

      Those who have been following the trials and tribulations of the plucky comedians will understand how traumatic of a week this has been for me.  This was the first night where America gets to pick which three comics will go on to the next week.   Here you are telling me that I have to pick a favorite out of Alonzo Bodden, Gary Gulman, John Heffron, Jay London, Katleen Madigan and Tammy Pescatelli.  These are the six comics I have been following since they got into the house, these are the people I have been rooting for every week.  And I have to choose a favorite?  It can't be done.   Gary Gulman's routine hit close to home on Tuesday.  He started talking about alarm clocks and the snooze alarm and how he used to live with someone who would keep hitting the snooze alarm each morning multiple times.  Jeff started laughing because Keem is one of those people and his bedroom is next to hers (well, so is mine but I have the master bedroom and I also sleep like the dead).  Then Gary went on to cookies and about how he hates the sugar cookie.  It is a little embarrasing to be yelling at the TV "Yes!  Exactly!" when Gary says "A cookie without sugar is a cracker."  I'm sorry but I have very strong feelings against sugar cookies.   I caught the last few minutes of the show on Thursday.  Apparently my psychic powers are working overtime again.  Gary, John and Alonzo are moving on to next week.  And how do I choose between those three?  It can't be done.  I couldn't decide between six.  Can't they be the Last Three Comics Standing?  Stupid NBC.  First you take Dan Naturman away from me and now you're making me crazy over this.

      Years ago (if you wonder why my posts usually start out with a vague impression of when something occurred, that's because my memory, she ain't what she used to be. And before you suggest I start taking gingko, let me just state that I bought a bottle of 60 pills. After a year (365 days), I opened the bottle and started counting the remaining pills. There were 50. I forgot to take something that would help my memory. I am obviously cursed), I needed to get out of a bad living situation. Long story short, I moved in with a work friend from NABABNA's arch rival, The Dark Side Bank, because she was having financial difficulty and I, Queen of the Balanced Checkbook (those who know me know this is so not true, those that don't know me, trust me, I couldn't balance a checkbook if you held a gun to my head. I know. I work in banking. It is very sad), decided I was going to help her out.  Well, it didn't work. Why not? Because she was a controlling bitch who had to have everything her own way, moved her boyfriend into the apartment so I could listen to them either fight or have sex (all the  frickin'  time!) and it was awful. I think the last straw was when I was checking our joint account (what the hell was I thinking?) and realized there were some ATM withdrawals I didn't recognize. I call the bank and ask the representative when and where these ATM withdrawals took place. She tells me they were made the previous day, during a time where it was impossible for either I or Shawna to make the withdrawal and conveniently located a block away from where the boyfriend works (I haven't come up with a good fake name for him yet). Obviously he has stolen money from us. I call Shawna, explain what happened and she tells me she will call him and deal with the situation.  An hour later, Shawna calls me back. The story I get is that Moron Boy (still looking for a good name) was found by someone from his past. Someone he owned money to for drugs. And said someone told Moron Boy that if he didn't pay him back, this person would have him arrested and the police would give him Shawna's car to pay him back. So Moron Boy, obviously, didn't want to have Shawna's car taken by the police and went to withdraw money from the ATM.  Are you with me here? Do you see the holes in this story?   Moron Boy owed this random person money for drugs.   The police would probably laugh themselves silly if the random person went to them and said "Arrest Moron Boy. He owes me money for drugs."  The car was in Shawna's name. The police are not going to take Shawna's car and give it to the random person.  Why didn't he call us and let us know that he was in trouble because hey, maybe we could have done something? Instead, he doesn't say a word and takes the money.   And yet, when I try to bring these holes to Shawna's attention, all I get is the cold silence. Then she says "Well, it's just impossible for me to deal with the fact that I have two roommates that are manic-depressive. I'm going to have the secret code changed on the cards." Excuse me? Listen, bitch, I may be manic-depressive (or the trendy new name bi-polar) but I have not stolen from you, technically he is not our roommate because he's "just staying with us for a little while until he gets his own place" and is not paying any rent, and, the biggest of all - my money is in that damn account. You change the secret code, I have no access to my money. He didn't just steal from you, he stole from me as well.  Anyway, being a wimp, I said nothing. Things got progressively worse. I developed a nasty illness called Irritable Bowel Syndrome (affectionately referred to as "gut rot") and missed a week of work. My mother, my beautiful, wonderful mother, comes to pick me up to take me to the doctor and asks me "What will it take to get you out of this place? I will do it." Bless her.  I ended up paying Shawna for two months of rent but moved out in a week. My Mom paid for me to move into my own apartment, took me to two estate sales and took me to Mattress Giant (does anyone think the woman in these adds is getting a little too excited about her new mattress?) to buy a new bed because I left my twin with Shawna and Moron Boy so Moron Boy's son would have someplace to sleep (Yes. She moved the son in. She thought it would help center Moron Boy and make him stop disappearing with her car and money. Hey, I got an idea. Kick his ass out and call the cops when he takes your car).  While we are wandering around looking at different mattresses and trying them out, we come across the ultimate mattress. Climb up onto the ultimate mattress, which is piled high with foam and more foam until there's not a pressure point to be found. It is on top of the box spring which could be used as a mattress itself, it is so fluffy. Mom and I lie on this bed. Every pain, every worry I have had in the past three months of living with Shawna floated away. There was no tension, no twinges, no hurt...just fluffy, fluffy mattress shaped Heaven. I turn to my Mom.   DM: Mom, please buy me this bed. I need it.  Mom: Dana, I am not buying you a $2,000 dollar bed.  DM: You've never loved me.  Yes, it was a joke. She knew it was a joke. She is the best, my Mother, and I want to thank her again for getting me out of hell. Although, if she would have bought me the bed I really wanted, I'm sure I wouldn't be having the shoulder pain I am now (and yes, Kari, I know it's probably from sleep apnea and not the mattress)...Dang her.

      Oh,  urlLink Frog , thank you for a good laugh.  You must take this  urlLink quiz , if only just to laugh at the questions.  And then go see Dodgeball and watch a real pirate in action...oh, that Steve ( urlLink Alan Tudyk ).  Your pirate name is:  Dread Pirate Kidd  Like the famous Dread Pirate Roberts, you have a keen head for how to make a profit. Even though you're not always the traditional swaggering gallant, your steadiness and planning make you a fine, reliable pirate. Arr!

      An old friend of mine (known over 20 years, since high school) who we will call Anya once was convinced to go on a blind date. This was in the mid-80's and I believe this was either right before she met her future husband or after she had met him but they were "taking a break" at the time.  Being a painfully shy person, Anya asked if I would go on the date with her. I agreed. The gentleman (and I use this term so very loosely) was to pick us up at our apartment and we would then proceed on the date. I don't remember what his name is but let's go with Jarvis, shall we? (Side note, does anyone know a good baby name dictionary online? I could start carrying my Best Baby Name Book in the World book around with me again but that just brings up so many questions. No, I am not pregnant!)  I'm usually a pretty good judge of character (well, at least when I'm not the person involved in the date. If I was going out with him, I'd probably think he was wonderful) and I hated Jarvis. The very minute I saw him. I believe in both love and hate at first sight. He just irritated me for no apparent reason. Here's a brief description (please keep in mind that this will not be favorable because I hated him): tall, heavyset, blond, florid...think John Goodman but not as good looking or cuddly. He is wearing dirty jeans and a flannel shirt and looks like he wandered onto a farm, took a bath in a mud puddle and combed his hair with a rake. He has put absolutely no effort into this date and I resent this for Anya's sake.  Introductions are made, Jarvis is informed that I will be coming along on the date. This appears to be all right with him. Then he makes fatal flaw #1. I am leaning over the counter in the kitchen while he and Anya are talking. He gets up, walks past me and slaps me on the rear and makes some comment about my big ass (And my response is to then haul off and stab him multiple times with the fork I keep just for this occasion). Well, no, actually I just told him to never touch me again and he really shouldn't be talking. Both Anya and I are "big girls" but he's definitely a "big boy" in not the favorable concept this would imply.  Somehow the date still proceeds. Jarvis escorts Anya to his car, I sit in the back seat while she is in the passenger seat. We are going to go to his house. Why? No clue. On our way there, we drive through Minneapolis. It is rush hour traffic, it is hot, sticky and the air conditioning does not work in Jarvis' junky, seen better days car. So the windows are down all the way.  The light turns red. Jarvis stops at the crosswalk. A very distinguished, handsome black man in a suit...picture Will Smith in 20 years in a pinstriped gray suit, carrying a briefcase (Yeah, that handsome)...starts to walk across the crosswalk. Because, y'know, that's what the crosswalk is for, right? Jarvis, at the top of his lungs, with the windows down all the way, says "I guess I got to stop for the 'derogatory word that starts with an N'." Fatal flaw #2.  I lean forward and smack him across the back of the head as hard as I can. I am furious. I hit him so hard my hand is shaking (or maybe that's from keeping myself from strangling him) from the pain. "Ow!" he cries! "What was that for?"  With all of the disgust I feel for him running rampart across my face, I say calmly "I am part black and I didn't appreciate your comment." (this was before I found out my Dad made the whole thing up, see the post just before this) Now, you would think he would apologize, right? Not just to me but to the extremely handsome black man, right? Yeah, keep dreaming.  "You don't look black. How was I supposed to know?" This is his response. This is his idea of an excuse for being a worthless human being. I don't look black. So it's okay that he made this remark because the guy crossing the street was black? No, I don't think so. For the rest of the trip to Jarvis' house, I subject him to the lecture of how this world would be a better place if we would stop judging by color and accept people for who they are (and in my mind I continued with  who the hell did you think you are, you are white trash scum who can't even put on a pair of clean jeans for a date!)  Anya just sat there. Didn't say a word. Jarvis would look at her, try to excuse himself with some lame reason ("He was crossing the street in front of me." "The light was red, you moron!"), and would set me off again. Finally, Anya turned to him and said "You might want to shut up and let her calm down."  We get to his house. He shares said house with his father and his sister. He mentioned something about his Mom leaving a few months ago. I bite my tongue to keep making any remarks I may regret later. He opens the door and we enter...  Hell. Jarvis takes us through the kitchen. "This," he says proudly. "Is our kitchen." Imagine, if you will, a sink piled high with dishes. And the counter has dishes on it. And the smell, oh God, the smell, of rotting food. And huge, black flies are buzzing around, having a little fly orgy on top of the rotting food, landing everywhere. There was not one inch of clean counter space, clean table space, clean floor space. The floor had paper strewn from one corner to the next. The table had the remains of breakfast, possibly from 1976 from the looks of the mold cultures growing in the milk. I am allergic to mold. If I touch it, I break out into hives. If I breathe it in, I have problems breathing. If I ingest it, I will be come ill (and yet, I still love bleu cheese dressing. I'm such a rebel. An occasionally ill rebel)  The tour continued. We walk, holding our breath, out of the kitchen and into a hallway. Jarvis is taking us to his bedroom (ooh, baby, I can hardly wait, let me rip off all of my clothes and do you on your kitchen table! Smear some mold on me, you sexy thing!) so we walk across the hall and up the stairs. Now, even though we didn't spend much time in the hallway, I notice several litter boxes, full to the brim. If you have ever experienced the joy of a full litter box, with the acrid amonia smell of cat piss, multiply it by three. Yes. It was that bad.  Both Anya and I are cat lovers. She asks "Oh, you have cats?"  Jarvis replies "Cats? No, we only have one. A kitten." Anya and I exchange a look of horror. One kitten. Three litter boxes. Three full litter boxes. What is going on here? What does this family do? Just put out a new litter box everytime the old one gets dirty? If you have ever owned cats, you will know that cats don't like dirty litter boxes. Eventually they start kicking it out of the box. And then it ends up on the floor. And then you bring guests over and it seriously creeps them out. And then they start itching their skin rapidly because they can just feel all of the germs and microbes climbing all over them. Oh, my God! What am I doing here! Get me out! Get me out! It is amazing what one can convey in a look of horror.  Jarvis leads up the stairs and there, on the landing, are some oddly shaped stryofoam thingies (thingies, the technical term for anything) lying about haphazardly, surrounded by another two full litter boxes. Jarvis looks at them, mutters "Damn cat" and picks them up and puts them on the window sill in the landing. He then turns to Anya and I and so very sincerely says the following: "I apologize for this mess (indicating the fallen stryofoam thingies). The cat must have knocked them down. I'm so sorry you had to see this."  Yes. He apologized for some pieces of styrofoam that were askew. Both Anya and I exchanged another look. I, using my eyes, conveyed to her "Styrofoam? He apologizes for styrofoam? How about the fact that I'm going to throw up any second from the disgusting disaster that is his house? How about the fact that this place reeks of mold and cat piss and God knows what else and Oh my God, what is that moving over there in the corner? Is that a mouse? Aaaaaieeeeeeee!" Anya uses her eyes to convey "Can I help it that my insane friend Smirna thought it would be a good idea to fix me up with a guy who she only knows because she's been talking to his friend through a chat line? Can I? Calm down. You will not throw up, you are overreacting.  It's not that bad.  Okay, yes, yes, it is but he drove and we have no way to get back home so we'll put up with for a few more minutes before we run screaming away. No, that's not a mouse.  It is a kitten."  This kitten was quite cute, it was all we could do to steal it and take it to a house where it would be adored and would have a clean litter box.   I don't remember much else about the experience, only that Jarvis completely annoyed me and I informed Anya that under any circumstances was she to ever date him.  But this was a conclusion she had drawn on her own, thank God.  I do remember taking an hour long shower after getting home.  Yuck.

      It was an interesting weekend. Normally I have Fridays and Saturdays off but I agreed to work on Saturday for a co-worker. He works the same schedule as Beth so I talked Keem into bringing me to work on Friday and then spent the weekend over at Beth's so she could drive me to work on Saturday.  Friday night: We were trying to decide what movie to watch. Beth wanted me to watch something I had never seen before. I said "You know, I've only seen one Lethal Weapon movie, #3."  So I watched Lethal Weapon #2 & #4. I am surprised that I've never seen them, I am a big fan of the buddy cop genre (okay, yes, I admit it, I am a big fan of any genre, except for the needlessly weepy or anything that movie critics reccommend (Example: The Hours. I don't like reading Virginia Woolf. Why would I want to watch a movie about her?)).  There is the one scene in LW2 where Hans walks into the room and the old guy, Arjen Rudd, says, gesturing to a plastic tarp laid out in the middle of the room "Oh, look out, we're painting." Now, I actually have not seen this done before in a movie, so apparently I could actually work for murdering drug runners because I yell at the TV. "You idiot, he's going to shoot you." I mean, c'mon, there is plastic on the floor. What do you expect? Moron.  Then there is the beautiful blonde girl who Riggs gets involved with. I turn to Beth. "She's going to die," I tell her. Are my psychic powers working overtime? No, I saw Lethal Weapon #3 and she's not in it. Plus, her boss is evil and wants her. She's just had the best sex of her life after avoiding certain death in a trailer via machine guns. You know she's going to die.  Lethal Weapon #4 was interesting. Jet Li was amazing. Beth told me she had heard they actually had to slow the movie down in some spots because you couldn't see him move, he's that fast. Apparently LW4 is a tear-jerker as well...I started crying in a few spots. But I did not cry through the entire movie, like Beth said I did. Maybe half of it.  Saturday night: Work. Work is boring. Although I did get an escalated call for 48 minutes which will be ending up on  urlLink Moron Mouth . And there was the interesting email conversation Beth and I had, involving cookies, Godzilla and my nephew, Josh. But I think that's a post all of it's own.  Because we had watched LW4 the night before, we decided to watch The One, with Jet Li. This is a really great movie, Sci Fi (Alternate Dimensions in this case), Cops, Martial Arts. What more do you need in a movie? I mean, honestly, this is the ultimate chick flick as far as I'm concerned. You get the really hot villain (Jet Li) and the really hot hero (Jet Li) who gets help from really hot Multiverse Agents (Delroy Lindo and Jason Statham). There's ass-kicking and true love everywhere you turn.  Then we watched Evita. I'm amazed I've never seen this, considering how much I love Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Weber's work. There were a few times when I was reminded of Jesus Christ Superstar by some of the instrumental movements. Very good movie. I finally got why people like Antonio Banderas so much. My God, the man can sing.  Sunday: We were going to go to the zoo. But we watched Evita until 6:30 in the morning and ended up sleeping until 2 (me) and 3:30 (Beth). I've noticed that the older I get, the less I can sleep in late. It is very unfair.  The zoo closed at 6:00.  No zoo for us today.  In Minnesota there are two "the zoo" zoos.  There is the  urlLink Como (Park) Zoo  and there is the  urlLink Minnesota Zoo  (why the Minnesota Zoo thought it was so cool and got to be called the Minnesota Zoo is beyond me).  Beth and I were going to go to the Como Zoo because it is closer to us, has a very cool Conservatory with many pretty flowers (ooh, pictures.  Pictures lead to scrapbooking) and, and this is very important, they have penguins.   Beth loves penguins.  I'm good as long as there are Lions and Tigers and Bears (preferably Pandas) but I'm also fond of Hippos as well.  So we're going to go to the zoo with Penguins.  No zoo.  So we watch Stephen King's The Stand.  I mentioned in an earlier post that I had made up an imaginary boyfriend and called him Randall, after Randall Flagg.  Beth and I had a great time making fun of Molly Ringwald as Frannie and talking about what a great casting job was done for the majority of the male characters.  The only male character we didn't think was particularly convincing was Stephen King playing a random townsperson.  When he meets up with Stu in the end and says "What happened to your leg, Stu?" Beth and I started laughing about how he was the one that broke the leg in the first place, he should know.  Then we went to karaoke.  This is why we watched The Stand in the first place, we needed to kill time until karaoke started.  We were a little late but it was worth it, had a great time.  An update from  urlLink Beer Goggles , the first guy that hit on Beth (Joe?) was there and found someone to go home with him.  He and his new lady love sang Picture together.  Oh, they were awful.  The highlight of the evening was this guy named Justin (?) and a friend of his (Jason?) who sang Baby Got Back.  Justin was breakdancing and then broke into the Carlton dance we all know and love from The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.  It was great.   So, I had a good weekend, I watched some good movies and I went to karaoke.  It doesn't get much better than this.

      One of the things I love about working for NABABNA is that NABABNA embraces diversity.&nbsp; It is wonderful to work for a company that:   gleefully offers health insurance to domestic partners, completely not caring if your domestic partner is of the same sex or the opposite sex of you (which, if you listen to the stupid, stupid man who is running our country, is completely wrong and we're probably all going to hell)  promotes on the basis of who the best person for the job is and pays everyone in the position the same wage, not promoting or paying based on race, gender or sexual preference  is heavily involved in community programs that benefit  all people  and will not contribute to community programs that exclude based on race, gender or sexual preference   As you can imagine, this sometimes draws fire from the, oh, how do I say this tactfully?&nbsp; The absolute morons who think that they are better than everyone else and how dare we support anything that they personally feel is wrong?&nbsp; Now, people, I don't have a problem with you believing what you want.&nbsp;&nbsp;That's your right as an American.&nbsp; However, that does not give you the order&nbsp;me to change my&nbsp;beliefs,&nbsp;it does not give you the right to suppress others because they are of a different race, gender or sexual preference than and it certainly does not give you the right to perform hate crimes against said others as well.  So, anyway,&nbsp;NABABNA has been involved in sponsoring Pride Festivals.&nbsp; And there are people who don't like this.&nbsp;&nbsp;Which is fine, I accept that&nbsp;they have a right to their opinion.&nbsp; Just like I have the right to think that they are silly, narrow-minded people.&nbsp; And if they don't want to bank at NABABNA because they don't like the fact that we support Pride, that's also fine.&nbsp; Go ahead and leave.&nbsp; Maybe you can find the local branch of&nbsp;the We Hate Everyone Who Isn't Us bank.  What I do have a problem with is when these people think that it would be a great idea to call and feed me their propaganda.&nbsp; Here is a conversation that I had last month with a customer.&nbsp; Or, I should say, soon to be ex-customer.&nbsp; In order for you to get the true effect of the call, imagine that the words in italic parentheses are what he is actually saying.&nbsp; So if he said "You people" his tone would indicate that he was placing us on the same level with  (leperous dregs of society).   A banker calls up and tells me that he has a customer who wants to speak to a supervisor but won't say why.&nbsp; This happens occasionally and so I ask the banker to transfer the customer.  DM:&nbsp; Thank you for holding, sir.&nbsp; My name is Dana and I'm a supervisor at NABABNA.&nbsp; How may I help you?  Self-righteous idiot who is going to annoy me very much (SRI for short):&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; I was driving through Name of City yesterday and I saw that they were having a Pride Festival  (Ritual Slaying of Small Children) .&nbsp; And then I saw&nbsp;representatives from NABABNA  (representatives of SATAN)  had a booth there.&nbsp; This is disgusting.  DM:&nbsp; Well, sir, NABABNA prides itself on it's diversity (yes, I said pride.&nbsp; Yes, I did it on purpose to indicate that I thought he was a narrow-minded bigot and I now hated him with a fiery passion) and...  SRI (cuts me off):&nbsp; Well, your diversity  (diseased-ridden values)  is why you will be losing me  (akin to royalty)  as your customer.  DM:&nbsp; I'm sorry to hear that, sir  (I am rejoicing and singing praises to God) .  Here's what this guy doesn't know.&nbsp; I have five male friends.&nbsp; I love them all very, very much and they are all gay.&nbsp; And when you start knocking gays and saying that they shouldn't have the right to marry or adopt or breathe, you're talking about my extended family.&nbsp; And you're ticking me off.&nbsp; So I love the fact that NABABNA is out there supporting Pride.&nbsp; And if you don't like it, well,&nbsp;I'm&nbsp;sorry to see you leave but I hope that someday you will see the light and realize that you're not any better than anyone else.

       Since customers are such an amusing source of humor, I've kept a small list over the years of random things I've heard.&nbsp; This is in no way a complete list.&nbsp; I could never have a complete list.&nbsp; I'd like to discuss a few of these now.     &nbsp;   WRONG ANSWER!    NABABNA used to take calls for other banks when they were closed to help with certain lost/stolen procedures.&nbsp; Basically, we closed cash cards over the weekend because the other banks couldn't afford to keep their locations open to close 1 card every 5 weeks.&nbsp; (This is effective in cost management to outsource this function.)&nbsp; The thing about this line that customers would dial was that people called it when they wanted to talk to their bank, not just to close their cards.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   The only, ONLY function we had was the ability to close the cards.    We couldn't activate the cards.    We couldn't tell you your balance.    We couldn't find branches in your area.    We had no clue what you spent last week.     &nbsp;   There was a man.&nbsp; He was an angry man.&nbsp; I'm not going so far to say psychotic, but he could have found benefits in speaking frankly with a therapist.&nbsp; This is my impression.&nbsp;    He didn't lose his card.&nbsp; He still had it.&nbsp; He wanted to know his balance.&nbsp; Here is our conversation (I am B, he is I, it stands for IDIOT!)    B:&nbsp; Thank you for calling the 'card closing line'.&nbsp; Is your card lost or stolen?    I:&nbsp; I want my balance.    B:&nbsp; I'm sorry sir.&nbsp; We are an after hours closing service your bank hired to help in situations of lost or stolen cards.    I:&nbsp; I don't believe this.&nbsp; You have my balance and you won't give it to me.    B:&nbsp; I'm sorry again sir.&nbsp; I do not work for your bank and I have no access to your accounts other than to close a cash card.    I:&nbsp; WRONG ANSWER!    B:&nbsp; But I don't work for your bank.&nbsp;    I:&nbsp; WRONG ANSWER!    B:&nbsp;  I sit in stunned silence.     I:&nbsp; I want to talk to the president of the bank, right now!    B:&nbsp; Sir, your bank is closed.&nbsp; I don't have the president's phone number.    I:&nbsp; WRONG ANSWER!    B:&nbsp;  At this point, I want to say, I'd love to get rid of you, you are dumb.&nbsp; Do you think I want you yelling at me because you're stupid?&nbsp; I don't enjoy you yelling at me.&nbsp;      I sit in silence.     I:&nbsp; Answer me!    B:&nbsp; I am unable to give you a different answer.&nbsp; I don't work for your bank.&nbsp; You can call them when they are open.    I:&nbsp; I want you to give me my balance.    B:&nbsp; The only thing I could do is close your card.&nbsp;    The customer hangs up.&nbsp; I think it's because I didn't give him his balance, but I'd like to think it was because he was afraid that giving me his information would make his card stop working.&nbsp; Not that I'd do that, mainly because I've dealt with customers who had this happen.&nbsp; I love it when customers get upset because they have the wrong number.&nbsp; Here are another couple of examples where the customer should not have called us:     &nbsp;   I2 - guess what this stands for!     &nbsp;   Banker calls me.&nbsp; "I have a customer who is upset that I can't find her account.&nbsp; She wants to talk to a supervisor."    B:&nbsp; Okay, I'll be happy to help.&nbsp; Send her through.    Transfer takes place.    B:&nbsp; Thank you for holding ma'am.&nbsp; I'm a supervisor here at NABABNA.&nbsp; Tony ( the banker ) said that you wanted to talk to a supervisor because he couldn't find your account?    I2:&nbsp; That's correct.&nbsp; I don't understand what a problem you are having.&nbsp; I never have this problem when I call NABABNA.&nbsp; It's only when I call Bank of Bank.&nbsp;    B:&nbsp; Um, you did call NABABNA.&nbsp;    I2:&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp; That's probably why you couldn't find my Bank of Bank account.&nbsp; [long pause]&nbsp; Would you please apologize to that banker?&nbsp; I was not pleasant to him.    B:&nbsp; Sure, I can do that.&nbsp; Why don't you put all of your accounts with us and then you only need one phone number?    I2:&nbsp; I think I'll do that!&nbsp; Thank you.     &nbsp;   She was nice enough, once she understood she dialed the wrong number.&nbsp; It was very funny.     &nbsp;   We actually get a lot of wrong numbers.&nbsp; This surprises me.&nbsp; Our phone lines answer as an automated service and it starts the message as, "Thank you for calling NABABNA."&nbsp; And then these people go through the prompts, get to a banker, listen to the banker say, "NABABNA, My name is...", ask their question, and then FINALLY realize they've called the wrong bank.&nbsp; I was amazed when the call escalated.&nbsp; That woman heard the name of the company 3 times and she still never caught it.     &nbsp;   One of the bankers on our team got this call last night (I'll call the banker Q):    Q:&nbsp; Thank you for calling NABABNA.&nbsp; This is Q.&nbsp; How can I help you?    I3 (guess why he's called that!):&nbsp; Do you have the phone number for bank locations.    Q:&nbsp; I can look up one of our branches for you.&nbsp; What state is it in?    I3:&nbsp; Illinois.    Q:&nbsp; What branch did you want?    I3:&nbsp; Well, it's for Bank of Bank.&nbsp;    Q:&nbsp; Um, unfortunately we only have the addresses and phone numbers for banks that are part of our company.    I3:&nbsp; Oh.&nbsp;    [Long pause.]    I3:&nbsp; How do you think I could get the number for that bank?    Q:&nbsp; Have you tried Directory Assistance?    I3:&nbsp; I'll try that.&nbsp; Thanks!    Q:&nbsp; Thank you for calling.&nbsp; I'm glad I could...help.     &nbsp;   Now I must ask.&nbsp; This customer knew that he wasn't calling the bank he wanted.&nbsp; Why would he think we had the phone number for a different bank?&nbsp; Do you call Wal-Mart to find out where a Target is located?&nbsp; Have you ever walked up to a Burger King asking where McDonald's was?&nbsp; Would this even cross your mind as an option???&nbsp; I don't get it.&nbsp; People are crazy.&nbsp; And dumb. &nbsp;

       DM has mentioned that we take escalated calls at a large banking call center.&nbsp; Customers are more amusing than any stand-up comic.&nbsp; In fact, I encourage customer service representatives to go into stand-up comedy for the amusement of the world.&nbsp; People must know these crazy things.     &nbsp;   People in general are stupid.&nbsp; I'm not saying every person is stupid, just in general, people are stupid.&nbsp; There are ways to hide the moronic things we do, but unfortunately, some people don't have this built into their genetic make-up.&nbsp; This is good, because it makes for a fun story.     &nbsp;   Not too long ago, a customer said to me, and I quote, "I didn't fall off the apple tree yesterday.&nbsp; I'm hip."&nbsp; Now, this doesn't make sense to me.&nbsp; Besides the fact that people don't usually fall off of apple trees, I'm pretty sure there is no hip hop songs with the lyrics, "I was climbing on the apple tree, I didn't fall off you see."&nbsp; I wanted to explain that if she is using the phrase, "I didn't fall off the apple tree yesterday," this automatically disqualifies her from being hip.     &nbsp;   One of the best examples of a moronic moment I've come across is from about two and a half years ago.&nbsp; I will remember this woman for the rest of my life.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   Side note: Oh my God, there's a grown man dressed up as Peter Pan on T.V. because he dresses like this everyday of his life.&nbsp; I'm so unbelievably scared.&nbsp; Conan O'Brien finds the strangest guests.&nbsp; This guy brought pictures of himself in many different fairy outfits.&nbsp; He just said he's single and straight and loves the ladies.&nbsp; He called his outfit the glitter star fairy.&nbsp; Conan just asked him what he wears for Halloween.&nbsp; He has problems for Halloween.&nbsp; He's 50 years old.&nbsp; But he said he's 5.&nbsp; He's been dressing like this for over 20 years.&nbsp; And now he's making Conan wear his hat.&nbsp; He has a website.&nbsp;   urlLink  www.pixyland.org   &nbsp; This is what they said on Conan and I searched.&nbsp; The site won't load right now but I'm pretty sure of the address.&nbsp; I'm scared.     &nbsp;   This is about how the call at NABABNA went:     &nbsp;   B (Me): Thank you for holding.&nbsp; My name is Beth and I'm a supervisor.&nbsp; How can I help you?    C (Customer): I want you to tell me right now who's been calling me and make them stop.    B:&nbsp; I'd be happy to help you as much as I can, you said someone has been calling you?&nbsp; Are they from NABABNA?    C: Well, yes.&nbsp; (She scoffs at me.)    B:&nbsp; Did they leave a message?    C:&nbsp; I want them to stop calling me.    B:&nbsp; Okay, have you talked to them?    C:&nbsp; No.    B:&nbsp; Do you have the name or department of who's calling you?    C: No.&nbsp; Make them stop.&nbsp; Figure out who they are right now!    B:&nbsp; I'm trying to help you.&nbsp; I don't have any comments or notations of anyone calling you.&nbsp; I'll need some help from you.    C:&nbsp; I&nbsp;mean it.&nbsp; They need to stop.&nbsp;    B:&nbsp; I understand that.&nbsp; Have they left messages?&nbsp; (I try asking again.)    C:&nbsp; No.&nbsp;    B:&nbsp; So you haven't talked to anyone and they're not leaving messages.&nbsp; Are you finding our number on your Caller ID?    C:&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Make them stop.    B:&nbsp; You've said that.&nbsp; I want to help you.     &nbsp;   Okay, so after 28 minutes of going back and forth of who is calling you, how do you know they are calling you, and her yelling (getting more and more frustrated and louder), she finally says:    C:&nbsp; Stop calling me.&nbsp; Every time I push redial, it calls you people!    I hit the mute button so fast and bust out laughing.&nbsp; I composed myself quickly and stated to the customer:    B:&nbsp; Um, ma'am, redial calls the person you called last, not who called you.    There is a pause.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   It's a long pause.     &nbsp;   C:&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp; I just don't get this whole technology thing!&nbsp; I'm just a blonde.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   Here's the thing.&nbsp; Redial is not technology.&nbsp; It hasn't been for what, 20 years?&nbsp;     &nbsp;   Again, I say, people are stupid.

      Yeah, funny, huh?&nbsp; Working in the banking industry, I have come to believe that people should take a class before they are allowed to open up a checking account.&nbsp; I believe this because I wish I would have taken one before I opened up my checking account at the tender age of 18 (19 years ago, sigh) and I actually thought this to be true.&nbsp; I also work on the help desk at a major bank and will routinely get calls from customers who are extremely angry with "You People."&nbsp; Here's a tip, people of the internet, when you have overdrawn your account at any bank, it doesn't matter where you bank, perhaps screaming at the person trying to help you might not be the best way to handle it.&nbsp; I know, it's shocking for me to even say this, but calling me a f*cking c*nt does not make me want to help you. &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Here is probably the most amusing ATM story I have heard.&nbsp; Customer calls in.&nbsp; "I went to the ATM to make a deposit.&nbsp; My card wasn't working."&nbsp; Banker thinks the customer is calling in to get a replacement card.&nbsp; Logical, right?&nbsp; Customer continues "I turned to the guy behind me and asked if I could use his card to make my deposit and he said yes.&nbsp; He entered in his secret code and everything.&nbsp; Where's my money?"&nbsp; Here's the thing, people.&nbsp; She was serious.&nbsp; She honestly thought that using the ATM card of some random stranger would make her deposit go into her account. &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Things you should know about ATM machines:  &nbsp;    If the machine doesn't have your bank's name on the top and you are charged a fee for using it, that's not our fault.&nbsp; Banks are required to disclose all fees to their customers.&nbsp; Read your disclosures.&nbsp; Once you sign that account application, you are agreeing to the disclosures and future changes to the disclosures.&nbsp; If you're not comfortable with that, don't sign the application!  Do not make a deposit at a machine that is not owned by your bank.&nbsp; There is no guarantee that you will ever receive the deposit into your account.&nbsp; You would be truly amazed at the number of people who want to do this.  Do not give your PIN # (secret code) to anyone.&nbsp; I don't care if it's your husband, wife, parent, child, best friend or whatever.&nbsp;&nbsp; If your card is used without your permission and it turns out to be because you gave someone your PIN #, well, you can pretty much kiss that money goodbye.&nbsp; Don't write your PIN # on your card either.  If you have the opportunity to print a statement from the ATM, don't do it.&nbsp; Most banks charge for that.&nbsp; Most banks also provide free online banking.&nbsp; Why pay for something you can get for free?   Okay, I'm going to get off my soapbox.&nbsp;&nbsp;But please, listen to my advice.&nbsp; Only you can prevent overdraft fees.&nbsp; Keep a register.&nbsp; Don't spend money you don't have.&nbsp; Oh and with today's technology, yes, it is possible to write a check to someone and have it go through your account on the same day. &nbsp;Don't try to beat the bank, people, it doesn't work.

      Working in the banking industry, I have realized many things, including the fact that certain people should not be allowed to having checking accounts.&nbsp; Here at&nbsp;NABABNA, I routinely deal with calls from people who have used the following excuses for being overdrawn (Because I want to keep my job, I don't say what I want to them. I wait until I get the chance to blog. What I want to say is in italics):  &nbsp;  "I'm too busy to keep a register. I work for a living."  "Oh, and I don't?&nbsp; Well, I hope you earn a lot of money at your job.&nbsp; Because I'm not reversing your fees.&nbsp; Moron."   &nbsp;  "It's not my fault that I'm overdrawn.&nbsp; I checked the automated system and it told me that my balance was $53.05.&nbsp; So I went shopping.&nbsp; The automated system was wrong!&nbsp; You people lie!"  "Okay, repeat after me.&nbsp; The automated system can only tell you what has posted or is pending to your account.&nbsp; Since the automated system is not psychic, it does not know that you wrote out a $43 check out two days ago."   &nbsp;  "Well, the ATM machine gave me the money.&nbsp; If I was overdrawn, I shouldn't have been able to withdraw any money."&nbsp;  "First of all, you withdrew the money from a non-NABABNA&nbsp;ATM.&nbsp; Because it isn't in the&nbsp;NABABNA network, it has no idea how much money you have.&nbsp; Second of all, do you really want us following you around and saying 'Oh, no, don't make that withdrawal.&nbsp; You don't have the money for it.'&nbsp; No, I didn't think so."   &nbsp;  With that all said, there's a reason why I am sometimes lenient and will reverse a fee for those customers that will admit that they made a mistake and don't call in every time they get a fee.&nbsp;&nbsp; And that reason is that I, myself, am an idiot.&nbsp; The following numbers are the result of my attempt to keep a ledger.&nbsp; Be afraid.&nbsp; Be very afraid.&nbsp;  &nbsp;    Starting balance.......$80.00  Minus SA...................$11.34  Subtotal.....................$68.36  Minus Carmike........$11.00 (pop and popcorn for Dodgeball for 2)  Subtotal....................$77.36  Minus Chalet...........$10.00 ($4 for pop. $6 tip.)  Subtotal...................$67.36  Minus Carmike.......$7.50 (matinee tickets for Dodgeball for 2)  Subtotal...................$59.86  Perkins.....................$18.00  Total.........................$41.86   I handed my register to Keem and asked her to check my figures. Then I watched her and Beth disolve into helpless laughter. What is wrong (other than the fact that I spent more money on concessions than the actual movie) is, I am sure, painfully obvious to all people who are not me, my actual total should have been $22.16.&nbsp; I, apparently, need someone to follow me around. Of course, the difference between myself and the&nbsp;NABABNA customers is that when I get an overdraft fee, I don't whine about it.

       Hi.&nbsp; My name is DM (short for Dana Marie).&nbsp; My friend Beth and I work for a major bank in America.&nbsp;&nbsp;We work in the customer service phone bank and take what's known as escalated calls.&nbsp; What does this mean?&nbsp; Mainly that&nbsp;we take calls from the customers who are upset with the bank.&nbsp; Now, yes, everyone makes mistakes and&nbsp;we do receive the occasional call from customers who have legitimate concerns with bank errors but the majority of the calls&nbsp;we receive are from people who have made mistakes on their own accounts.&nbsp;   Some of these people are wonderful to deal with because they are asking us to help them and are polite, calm individuals.&nbsp; And some of these people, the people that&nbsp;Beth and I are going to blog about, are morons.&nbsp;   Because&nbsp;we really love&nbsp;our jobs, there is no way we're going to tell you who we really work for.&nbsp; From now on, our company will be referred to as NABABNA, short for National American Bank of America, Baby, National Association.&nbsp; Yes, it's a weird name.&nbsp; But NABABNA is fun to say and so not close to&nbsp;the real name of our bank.  We will also be, for your reading pleasure, provide you with conversations that we have overheard or, sometimes, been forced to be involved in.&nbsp;   Just for the record, names have been changed to protect the innocent and not so innocent, if the customer we're talking about sounds like you, it's really not (but if you think it is, then you should probably really consider your banking habits), and yes, sometimes I will exaggerate for humor's sake.&nbsp;&nbsp; Usually I don't have to exaggerate, though, and will normally indicate when I've done so.&nbsp;   Hope you enjoy!&nbsp; Ciao.&nbsp; DM&nbsp;&nbsp;

      Recently, I took an escalated call.&nbsp; Now, this, in itself, is not that amusing.&nbsp; Having someone scream at you is not fun, especially if you're trying to calm the person down so you can help them.&nbsp; I have had to, on one occasion, actually interrupt a customer (huge no-no in the customer service field but what are you gonna do?) and say "I am trying to help you.&nbsp; Please be quiet and listen to me.&nbsp; I do not want you to close your account.&nbsp; You are the victim of fraud and I want to help you get your money back.&nbsp; Do you understand what I am trying to say?"&nbsp; The customer stopped screaming and said (and I quote) "Oh.&nbsp; I guess it's really not NABABNA's fault that I'm being ripped off, huh?"&nbsp;   So, anyway, the call I'm referring to was from a customer who was upset that his account was closed and he was referred to a collection agency.&nbsp; He seemed to believe this was NABABNA's error.&nbsp; Here is our conversation.&nbsp; Remember, when I use italics, this is what I am thinking, not saying to the customer...well, unless I've got the mute button on.  DM (that's me!):&nbsp; Thank you for holding, sir.&nbsp; My name is DM and I am a supervisor.&nbsp; The banker told me that you wanted to speak to me about the fact that your account was closed?  Raving Idiot (RI for short):&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; I haven't used my account since February and apparently, you were allowing Large Insurance Company (LIC) to debit money from my account.&nbsp; This caused me to become overdrawn and then you reported me to a collection agency.&nbsp; This is wrong, wrong, wrong and you are all evil pigs who must die.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   DM:&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Let me make sure I understand this, sir.&nbsp; LIC was withdrawing money from your account fraudulently?  RI:&nbsp; No, no!&nbsp; Where did you get that from?&nbsp; I had set up payments with them and forgot to cancel the payment when I moved.&nbsp; God, you're stupid.  DM:&nbsp;  I'm stupid?&nbsp; I'm stupid?&nbsp; Listen, you jackass... &nbsp; I'm sorry you feel that I am stupid, sir.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am just trying to understand&nbsp;the situation.&nbsp; Did you contact us when you received your statement to let us know that this had happened?  RI:&nbsp; No.&nbsp; I never got a statement.&nbsp; You people didn't send me one.  DM:&nbsp;  I am&nbsp;only one person, sir.&nbsp; I am not plural. &nbsp; Oh, that's unfortunate.&nbsp; I'm not showing that we've received statements back from the Post Office.&nbsp; Let's&nbsp;verify your address to make sure we're sending the statements to the right address.&nbsp; Would you please give me your address?  RI:&nbsp; I don't know what you have.&nbsp; I've moved six times since February.  DM:&nbsp;  Well, you're obviously a stable and trustworthy person.&nbsp; Hey, I think I've dated you. &nbsp; Ah.&nbsp; Did you update your address with us, sir?  RI:&nbsp; No!&nbsp; Why would I do that?&nbsp; I wasn't using the account!&nbsp; And quit changing the subject!&nbsp; Why did you let LIC take money out of my account?  DM:&nbsp; Well, sir, you set up automatic payments with them.&nbsp; In order to stop the payments from coming out of the account, we would ask you to contact LIC.  RI:&nbsp; Stop blaming LIC!&nbsp; I've already talked to them!&nbsp; I want you to open this account back up so they can give me the money back.&nbsp; God, why don't you listen?  DM:&nbsp;  Oh, I don't know.&nbsp; Maybe because you're a babbling idiot?&nbsp;  Please forgive me, sir, I'm just trying to find out what you want by asking questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;I should have realized you wanted to open the account.&nbsp;  By using my psychic powers .&nbsp;&nbsp; I apologize but unfortunately, I would be unable to assist you&nbsp;with your request.&nbsp; If you would be willing to visit a branch, they would be able to determine if they will be able to reopen the account.  RI:&nbsp; I'm not going to the branch.&nbsp; I've already wasted all&nbsp;the time I'm going to spend with you people.&nbsp; I can't open up a new account with Bank of Bank because of you people screwing up my account.&nbsp; Get my name removed from that collection agency so I can open up a new account.  DM:&nbsp; I do apologize, sir, but I am unable to do what you request.&nbsp; If you would visit a branch...  RI:&nbsp; I'm not talking to you anymore.&nbsp; You're never going to get your money back because you won't do this.&nbsp; You're a stupid (word that rhymes with witch but yet, oddly, starts with a B)!&nbsp;   Customer disconnects.&nbsp; I spend a few minutes laughing at him because well, he's an idiot.&nbsp; He's already been reported to the collection agency and, by law, he will not be able to open up a new account at any bank until after&nbsp;his name from&nbsp;said collection agency for at least a year...unless, of course, he goes to a credit union&nbsp;and they don't check the list.  Let's review, shall we?&nbsp; What did the customer do wrong?&nbsp;    He did not change his address with his bank.  He did not cancel his payments with LIC.  He did not think "Hey, maybe I should close this account if I'm not going to be using it anymore instead of&nbsp;blithely frolicking through life without a care or single responsible thought in my brain and just assuming that everything will be okay."   The very same day, I receive a call from a banker who asks me to look at an account with him.&nbsp; The banker, let's call him Kyle, says to me that he is speaking to a customer who thought he closed his account in February.&nbsp; I say "Is his name Raving Idiot, by any chance?"  Kyle:&nbsp; No, it's Idiot Beyond-Reason.&nbsp; Why?  DM:&nbsp; Um, no reason.&nbsp; Do you have his account number?  Kyle:&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Here it is.&nbsp; (I pull up the account.)&nbsp; As you can see, there is quite a lot of activity on this account, for something that he apparently hasn't been using.&nbsp; I asked him about the purchases and ATM withdrawals and he says that he cut up his card in February.&nbsp; So he wants to dispute all of the activity on this account since February.  DM:&nbsp; But, but there are payroll deposits into this account.&nbsp; Doesn't he know that he's not getting his money?  Kyle:&nbsp; Well, that's the thing.&nbsp; If you look at these deposits, you'll see that these deposits are not in Mr. Beyond-Reason's name.&nbsp; They are actually in the name of&nbsp;Ima Random-Woman.  DM:&nbsp; Okay, I'm completely confused.&nbsp; Who is that?  Kyle:&nbsp; I asked him that and he first told me he didn't know.&nbsp;   DM:&nbsp; This account has been receiving these deposits since last October.&nbsp;   Kyle:&nbsp; I know.&nbsp; I asked him about that.&nbsp; He then said that this might be the name of his ex-girlfriend but he doesn't really remember what her name is.  DM:&nbsp; Wait.&nbsp; He&nbsp;doesn't remember the name of his girlfriend from what?&nbsp; Six months ago?&nbsp; (Kyle and I pause in reflection...okay, you caught me.&nbsp; We paused to laugh hysterically.)  Kyle:&nbsp; Yeah, that's what he said.&nbsp; He then admitted he doesn't really know if he cut up the card or not.  DM:&nbsp; Since this is a sole owner account, did it ever occur to him to call us and oh, I don't know, close his account?  Kyle:&nbsp; Apparently not.  DM:&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Here's what you do.&nbsp; Explain to him that to dispute all of the purchases and ATM withdrawals, you also need to dispute all of the deposits as well.&nbsp; Get a phone number for him and then ask your manager if you can file this claim off of the phone.&nbsp; This one's going to take awhile.  Kyle:&nbsp; That's what I figured.&nbsp; Thanks, DM.  DM:&nbsp; Have fun.&nbsp;   I later ran into Kyle and he told me that the customer continued to insist that he was not the one using this account and everything should be disputed.&nbsp; Kyle filed all of the claims and then tried to call the customer back to give him the reference numbers.&nbsp; The phone number, mysteriously, did not work.&nbsp; So, probably what happened?&nbsp; Mr. Idiot Beyond-Reason probably just broke up with Ms. Random-Woman and is ticked off at her.&nbsp; So he's going to pay her back by getting all of her deposits returned.&nbsp; Not thinking about the fact that, hey, the account is in his name and he's responsible for it!&nbsp;   Moral of my story:&nbsp; Please, please, please...if you move, change&nbsp;your address with your bank.&nbsp; Don't just assume everything's going to be okay.&nbsp; Do you want to go through life knowing that I'm secretly laughing at you?

       No, this is not work related.  However, it is a very important that the Morons of America wake up and realize that this behavior needs to stop.  It needs to stop now.  What am I talking about, you ask?  Well, dear reader, please continue reading and all will be revealed.  Those of you that know me personally (or have read  urlLink Green Duckies )  know that I'm a bit of a movie buff.  I love movies.  I would spend all day watching movies if I could.  I would love to write reviews but since I would prefer to watch the Porky's Trilogy over The Hours, I'm not sure I would be taken seriously.  When I pay $7.50 for a movie, I want to experience every last minute of the movie going experience, which includes the previews and the Fandango commercial.  Don't mess around during the Fandango commercial, people!  It makes me seriously cranky.  I even enjoy the Movies - They're Worth It campaign that was going on.  Movie Piracy is bad.  Don't steal.   But I digress (yes, I know you're all really surprised by this).  The point is, that when I go to the movies, I want to watch the movies.   So let's just cover some Dana Movie Don'ts, shall we?    If I wanted to deal with children, I'd ask my sister if I could baby-sit Josh.  Do not bring small children to a movie unless it is a movie deliberately marketed for said small children.  In other words, your four year old son is not going to want to sit through I, Robot and is going to continue talking no matter how many times you shush him.  He is seriously bored.  And I, I am seriously pissed.  Movie theaters are not babysitters.  You may think your teen or "tween" is old enough to go to the movies by themselves but they really aren't.  Do you know what they're going to do while you're gone?  They are going to run up and down the stairs, throw candy at one another, have a conversation about what boy they really like and, well, really irritate me to the point that I'm ready to wait for you in the parking lot and make you give me my $7.50 back because you just don't have any sense of responsibility.  To the women who thought it was a great idea to sit next to me during Love Actually, let me just cover a few things.  Yes, that's Rowan Atkinson who yes, did play Mr. Bean at one time in his career (but, since he is a comic genius, he has played other points and I love him and he is on screen and shut up already!).  Yes, Hugh Grant is really hot.  No, I don't care about what you had for lunch, what you think is going to happen next or about Billy Bob Thornton and Angelina Jolie's marriage.  I am here to watch a movie.  If I wanted your opinion on everything, I would ask you out to dinner.  To the little punk who shushed me during Anchorman, I am older than you, I outweigh you and I probably outmean you as well.  You and your little brat friends deserved to be told to sit down and you know it.  Don't shush me and try to play all innocent with your "We're trying to watch a movie" comment because I laughed.  Anchorman, moron in training, is a comedy.  People will laugh during it.  And consider it this way, I only told you five to sit down and keep quiet.  Someone not as tolerant as me might, oh, I don't know, beat the crap out of you?  I have witnesses to your behavior throughout the entire movie.  You're really lucky I didn't have you thrown out.  Next time, I will.   Okay, so, if you, by any chance, recognize yourself from this post, please take the time to consider how your actions affect others.  I am a very easy going person and if you're pissing me off, I'm thinking the multitude of people in the theater are not going to bat an eye when I drag you out of the theater by your hair.  I'm thinking I might even get a medal.

       Tonight at work, I may have dealt with one of the most unique questions I've found in 7 years at NABABNA.&nbsp; It's not really the request that inspired me to blog, but the fact that the woman I was talking to was the perfect example of insanity.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   This woman was upset that the advertisements the bank sends out were only arriving in one of her account statements.&nbsp; That's right.&nbsp; She was furious that the bank wasn't advertising to her the same offers MORE THAN ONCE.&nbsp; She wants us to send her multiple pieces of shiny paper that can just clutter up her home.&nbsp; This is weird in the first place.     &nbsp;   I'll admit.&nbsp; This woman got wrong information from many sources at NABABNA.&nbsp; Here's the highlights of the call:     &nbsp;   Banker, I'll call him Frank or F calls me (B).&nbsp; The woman will be Loudmouth.&nbsp; Okay, Frank calls:     &nbsp;   B:&nbsp; Thanks for calling.&nbsp; How can I help you?    F:&nbsp; I was talking to another supervisor and I got disconnected  because they didn't want to deal with this crazy situation and they were trying to find a way out. &nbsp; (Okay, the italics are what I'm sure the guy was thinking.)    B:&nbsp; I'm sorry about that.&nbsp; What's the problem?    F:&nbsp; This woman wants us to send her lots of paper and she's pissed off because we don't kill multiple trees so she can read the same thing over and over.    B:&nbsp; I'd be happy to help you.    F:&nbsp; I told her that it has to do with her privacy preferences.    B:&nbsp; That doesn't sound right.&nbsp; I don't know the exact answer, but that shouldn't have anything to do with it.    F:&nbsp; Well, that's what the other supervisor told me and they were checking on it when I got disconnected.    B:&nbsp; That's fine.&nbsp; Since we're supposed to take over this type of call, I'll ask for you to put the customer through now.    F:&nbsp; Okay [pause], Ms. Loudmouth...    Loudmouth: You're wrong!&nbsp; Privacy preference laws only talk about sharing my information with outside companies.&nbsp; You can advertise to me all those programs and services your company offers!&nbsp; I don't think this is right.&nbsp; This call has lasted too long.&nbsp; I don't like this.&nbsp; You don't know what you're doing.&nbsp;    B:&nbsp; [I interrupt now - yes, I interrupted.&nbsp; I know it's wrong, but I've been monitored already.]&nbsp; Frank, I can take care of this now.&nbsp; Ms. Loudmouth, my name is Beth and I'm a supervisor here.&nbsp; I'd like to help...    L:&nbsp; He doesn't know what he's talking about.&nbsp; I don't want to explain this again.    B:&nbsp; I already know what is going on and I'd like to place you on hold while I see if this can be corrected.&nbsp; Can you hold?    L:&nbsp; I told him everything!&nbsp; I talked to the President of the branch here years ago and he said it had to do with a conversion and my Social Security number.&nbsp; I don't think this is right.&nbsp; I want insurance.&nbsp; I should get my free $1,000.    [By the way, I have no clue how a bank would give away a free $1,000.&nbsp; This seems, in a word, odd.]&nbsp; He's not there anymore.&nbsp; He was too good.&nbsp; He got promoted and I don't want to deal with this.&nbsp; I've been on the phone for almost an hour.&nbsp; It has nothing to do with privacy preferences.&nbsp; You can advertise to me.&nbsp; I just don't think I care anymore.&nbsp; That banker doesn't know what he's doing.&nbsp; I already know the answer.&nbsp; The President of the bank told me it years ago.&nbsp; [Yes, she basically looped back and forth.&nbsp; There was never a breath.&nbsp; Never!]&nbsp; I hate you people...    B:&nbsp; Ms. Loudmouth, I would like to help you.&nbsp; Can I place you on hold?&nbsp; [Yes, I interrupted again.]    L:&nbsp; I already know the answer.&nbsp; I want my advertising.&nbsp; I deserve my free $1,000.&nbsp; What if I died and the man that I don't want to marry but helps me raise my children had no money.&nbsp; He deserves $1,000.&nbsp; I said I'd never say wedding vows.&nbsp; It has nothing to do with my privacy preference.&nbsp;    B:&nbsp; I know that.&nbsp; I'd like to help you.&nbsp; Can you hold?    L:&nbsp; The President of the bank, he's good and he's not there anymore, I read the paper you know.&nbsp; I always know what's going on.&nbsp; He told me it was a conversion thing and my Social Security number....    B:&nbsp; Can you hold?    L:&nbsp; The President told me this.&nbsp; I want my money.&nbsp; My man deserves $1,000.&nbsp; He got the advertising.&nbsp; I want it too.&nbsp; I know the answer.&nbsp; It's nothing to do with privacy preferences....    B:&nbsp; Yes, you've told me this MULTIPLE times now.&nbsp; I get it.&nbsp; Can you hold while I try to fix it?    L:&nbsp; The President...    B:&nbsp; Ms. Loudmouth, I can't do anything until you hold.    L:&nbsp; I've been on this call for a long time now  because I just like to hear my own voice.     B:&nbsp; Well, I can make it shorter if you can hold.&nbsp; Can you hold?    L:&nbsp; I've been on this call for almost an hour and I've been dealing with this for 10 years.    B:&nbsp; Can you hold?    L:&nbsp; The President of the bank...    B:&nbsp; Ms. Loudmouth, can you hold?    L:&nbsp; Can you call me back?    B:&nbsp; No.    L:&nbsp; I can hold.     &nbsp;   So at this point (which, by the way, I shortened for the blog.&nbsp; Believe, I shortened it GREATLY.&nbsp; One of the bankers on my team actually took 5 calls in the time it took for me to put this woman on hold.)&nbsp; I called over to a processing area and stumped a whole bunch of people.&nbsp; The first guy just transferred me to someone else.&nbsp; I think he went to ask for help and they just asked to take over the call.&nbsp; This second woman came on and tried to brush me off by giving me a phone number for our privacy preference line.&nbsp; Here's my conversation with her (her name will be Sue.)    S:&nbsp; Here's the phone number for our privacy line.    B:&nbsp; It has nothing to do with her privacy preference.    S:&nbsp; It's probably some conversion thing.    B:&nbsp; That makes no sense.&nbsp;    S:&nbsp; Well, if she opts out, she won't get any paper anymore.    B:&nbsp; But she WANTS the paper.&nbsp; I told you that already.    S:&nbsp; She wants the advertising?&nbsp; That's crazy.    B:&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; And she's losing it because we're not flooding her home in dead trees.&nbsp; Is there some type of statement handling code on this account?    S:&nbsp; No.    B:&nbsp; Then why wouldn't she get this in her statements?    S:&nbsp; Well, it's a privacy preference thing.    B:&nbsp; No, it's not.&nbsp; She's getting the stuff in her other statement.&nbsp; If it was a privacy thing, she wouldn't get ANY advertising.&nbsp; And it's not just the advertising.&nbsp; It's the disclosures too.&nbsp;    S:&nbsp; I'll check with a specialist.&nbsp; Can you hold?    B:&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   Time goes by.&nbsp; Loudmouth actually disconnected so I never got the satisfaction of telling her the CORRECT answer.&nbsp; I don't really care though.&nbsp; She chose to hang up.     &nbsp;   Sue returns.    S:&nbsp; Thanks for holding.&nbsp; I'm still checking on this.&nbsp; The specialist is asking the other specialists for help.&nbsp; Can you continue to hold?    B:&nbsp; Yes.     &nbsp;   Another delay.&nbsp; I'm laughing now because I've stumped the entire department.&nbsp; This is exciting!     &nbsp;   S:&nbsp; Thanks for holding.&nbsp; The reason this woman isn't getting extra advertising is because we only send one per customer and it is generated by whatever account is the first on the customer's profile.    B:&nbsp; So, because her joint account is a lower number than the sole account, the joint account is the one with the advertising?  S:&nbsp; Yes.    B:&nbsp; So, it has nothing to do with her privacy preference and nothing to do with conversions.&nbsp;    S:&nbsp; That's correct.    B:&nbsp; That's good to know.&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp;    S:&nbsp; Have a good night.     &nbsp;   By the way, if you're not familiar with jargon, joint account means there is more than one signer with transaction authority on the account.&nbsp; Sole account means only one person owns the account.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   The morale of the story:&nbsp; SHUT UP and you'll get the right answer, a lot sooner.&nbsp; Talking or yelling in the ear of a representative does nothing but waste your time and theirs.&nbsp;

      Once upon a time I took a call from a very nice gentleman who had a very traumatic experience and needed to file a claim regarding fraudulent activity on his account.&nbsp; This customer had visited an ATM and was kidnapped at gun point.&nbsp; He was forced to withdraw money from the ATM and then held captive at his home for several days.&nbsp; While I was filing the report, I had to ask him questions for a form I was required to fill out.  &nbsp;  The customer answered my questions and then started providing information I didn't need for the form and didn't really want to know.&nbsp; The italics are when I have&nbsp;quickly pressed the mute button. &nbsp;  I had just asked the customer (C) for a description of the assailant.&nbsp; Here is his response:  &nbsp;  C:&nbsp; There was two of them.&nbsp; They were huge.&nbsp;&nbsp;Like football players.&nbsp; I'm just a little guy.&nbsp; They were really big.&nbsp; They were black.&nbsp; Not that there's anything wrong with that, I'm not predjudiced, but these guys were black.&nbsp; They raped me, you know.  DM:&nbsp; Uh, no, I didn't know that.&nbsp; I'm very sorry to hear that, sir.&nbsp; That's horrible.  C:&nbsp; You&nbsp;heard&nbsp;about black men, right?&nbsp;&nbsp;About their really big&nbsp;areas, if you know what I mean.&nbsp; Well, the stories are all true.&nbsp; These guys were huge. DM (rocking back and forth in horror):&nbsp;  Why, why is he telling me this? &nbsp; Oh, sir, I'm so sorry this happened to you.  C:&nbsp; It wouldn't have been so bad if they would have used lubricant.&nbsp; But they didn't.&nbsp; So I didn't like it at all.&nbsp; I wouldn't have minded so much if they would have used some lotion.&nbsp; I might have liked it then.&nbsp; They were really big.&nbsp; I guess you would say they were good looking.&nbsp; DM:&nbsp;  Oh, my God!&nbsp; This is too much information! &nbsp;&nbsp;Have you called the police, sir?  C:&nbsp; I suppose I should do that.&nbsp;  DM:&nbsp; That would be a good idea, sir. &nbsp; Another&nbsp;fraud call came from an older gentleman. &nbsp; DM:&nbsp; Well, I'd be happy&nbsp;to place&nbsp;a freeze on your checking account, sir.&nbsp; We want to make sure that no one can use your account fraudulently. C2:&nbsp; That's good.&nbsp; I appreciate that. DM:&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me explain what is going to happen to your account...(customer begins talking) C2:&nbsp; See, I'm...well, I was lonely.&nbsp; And I had her over to my apartment.&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you&nbsp;know&nbsp;what a one night stand is? DM:&nbsp; Um, yes, sir, I do. C2:&nbsp; I guess I shouldn't have believed that&nbsp;someone that young was interested in me.&nbsp; I'm&nbsp;73.&nbsp; How old are you? DM:&nbsp; Okay, sir, I'm going to place a freeze on your account and... C2:&nbsp; I met her at the bar.&nbsp; Did I mention I was lonely?&nbsp; &nbsp;  DM:&nbsp; Okay, well, about this freeze... C2:&nbsp; She was young.&nbsp; She was probably 25 and had a nice, well, chest area. DM:&nbsp;  Oh, dear God in Heaven, where do you people come from?&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I need to place this freeze now.&nbsp; You may want to call the police when we're done. C2:&nbsp; Okay.  &nbsp; The mute button is a wonderful, wonderful invention.

       This story was told to me by a great friend of mine.&nbsp; She is one of the characters and I'm changing the names to protect the guilty.&nbsp; There are three main characters to the story.&nbsp; We have:    Michelle (my friend)    Jim (her ex-boyfriend)    Bart (his best friend)     &nbsp;   Michelle and Jim shared an apartment.&nbsp; Life was happy, nothing too terrible going on, but as life goes, drama must occur.&nbsp; Michelle worked hard at her job, pulling double shifts often to pull in the money and Jim had his steady job.&nbsp; Michelle came home from work one night, not quite ready to hit the sack where Jim was sleeping peacefully.&nbsp; What to do?&nbsp; She decided it was time to write in her journal so she quietly went into their room and pulled her journal and a pen from her dresser drawer.     &nbsp;   "What's that?"&nbsp; Jim sleepily asks.     &nbsp;   "It's my journal.&nbsp; I'm going to the living room.&nbsp; Go back to sleep."&nbsp;     &nbsp;   She goes to the living room and sits watching music videos and writing about her day, venting about customers and the jerk who cut her off, you know, meaningless stuff.&nbsp; Her writing is personal to her though, and anyone reading her journal would be invading her privacy.&nbsp; As she is done, she thinks, "He's going to read my journal.&nbsp; I know it."&nbsp; She pulls a hair from her head, lays it across the page and tests her trick.&nbsp; The hair won't fall out unless the journal is opened.&nbsp; Now she'll know.     &nbsp;   The next day is rather uneventful.&nbsp; Jim has the day off and Michelle leaves for work.&nbsp; She works a double shift again and comes home to see Jim sitting in the living room, flipping through the channels.&nbsp; She goes to their room quickly and checks the journal.&nbsp; Sure enough, the hair is missing.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   Michelle walks back into the living room to face Jim.&nbsp; "So what did you do today?"&nbsp; She asks nicely.     &nbsp;   "Not much.&nbsp; Just sat around watching TV."&nbsp; Jim replies.     &nbsp;   "What time did you read my journal?"&nbsp; She is still giving him a chance to answer honestly.     &nbsp;   "I didn't read your journal."     &nbsp;   "I didn't ask if you read my journal, I asked what TIME did you read my journal."     &nbsp;   "I didn't read your journal."&nbsp; He lies again.     &nbsp;   "Well, I worked a long day, and you're lying to me, I'm going to bed."     &nbsp;   Michelle is not someone you want mad at you.&nbsp; I learned everything I know about arguing from her.&nbsp; I've seen her boyfriends cringe in the corner of a room, scared of the logic and vicious rhetoric she uses.&nbsp; And the daggers from her eyes!&nbsp; Wow.&nbsp; I'm in awe every time I see her in full action.&nbsp; Jim got lucky that night.     &nbsp;   The next night Michelle goes to work again and goes out afterwards, 'forgetting' to turn off her cell phone.&nbsp; She's avoiding Jim for the time being to avoid saying something she doesn't want to.&nbsp; This goes on for a couple of days.     &nbsp;   On Friday, Jim calls her at work.&nbsp; During her shift.&nbsp; Here's the conversation:     &nbsp;   M:&nbsp; Hello.     &nbsp;   J:&nbsp; Hi.&nbsp; I need you to turn on your phone tonight.     &nbsp;   M:&nbsp; Tell me why.     &nbsp;   J:&nbsp; I just need you to turn on your phone.     &nbsp;   M:&nbsp; Tell me why.     &nbsp;   J:&nbsp; Just do it.     &nbsp;   M:&nbsp; Tell me why!     &nbsp;   J:&nbsp; I might need a little help.     &nbsp;   M:&nbsp; What?     &nbsp;   J:&nbsp; I might need to call you.     &nbsp;   M:&nbsp; Why?     &nbsp;   J:&nbsp; Bart asked me to take his truck.     &nbsp;   M:&nbsp; So?     &nbsp;   J:&nbsp; He wants me to TAKE his truck.     &nbsp;   M:&nbsp; Don't do it.     &nbsp;   J:&nbsp; Just turn on your phone.     &nbsp;   M:&nbsp; I can't believe you're planning on insurance fraud.     &nbsp;   J:&nbsp; Just turn on your phone.     &nbsp;   She hangs up on him.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   Michelle continues her shift at work and now we start to see what Jim is up to.     &nbsp;   The idiot decided to take Bart's truck.&nbsp; He did it.&nbsp; The plan is for Jim to take the truck, Bart to come pick up Jim in his girlfriend's car, and then call in a stolen vehicle report.&nbsp; I guess Bart couldn't pay NABABNA anymore for the truck and wanted out of the deal.&nbsp; Jim held up to his end of the bargain.&nbsp; He took the truck up to an abandoned field and torched the vehicle.&nbsp; I mean torched it.&nbsp; He actually did a good job of arson.&nbsp; There is no way this vehicle can be repaired.&nbsp; As he's leaving the scene, he lost his cell phone.&nbsp; That's right.&nbsp; He lost his cell phone.&nbsp; Now he can't call Bart to get him.&nbsp; Bart knows where he is, this isn't a big deal.&nbsp; Meanwhile, Bart's girlfriend gets pissed off at him and takes off in her car.&nbsp; Bart cannot go get Jim.&nbsp; He has already called in the stolen vehicle report and is now frantically trying to find another buddy to give him a ride to go get Jim without giving up the story.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   After about 10 calls, he finds a ride and gets Jim.&nbsp; The plan works.&nbsp; Amazingly enough, up to this point, the plan is working.&nbsp; The boys get back to the house and the police call.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   Police:&nbsp; We found your truck.&nbsp; We have some bad news.&nbsp; It's been torched.     &nbsp;   Bart:&nbsp; Oh man.     &nbsp;   Police:&nbsp; Did you lose your cell phone?     &nbsp;   Bart:&nbsp; No.&nbsp; I have my phone.     &nbsp;   Police:&nbsp; We found a phone near the truck.     &nbsp;   Bart:&nbsp; You know, my buddy was riding with me earlier today.&nbsp; Maybe he left it in the truck.     &nbsp;   Police:&nbsp; That makes sense.&nbsp; We filled out the report and you can contact your insurance company.     &nbsp;   Bart:&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   They hang up.&nbsp; Again, the plan is working.&nbsp; The police actually bought the story about the cell phone and Bart is clear.&nbsp; They should have left it here.&nbsp; But what happens?&nbsp; Bart and Jim get paranoid.&nbsp; Bart starts freaking out and Jim does nothing to stop this.&nbsp; Bart decides to call the police back.     &nbsp;   Bart:&nbsp; I want to cancel my stolen vehicle report.     &nbsp;   Police:&nbsp; Why?     &nbsp;   Bart:&nbsp; I asked my friend to take my truck.     &nbsp;   Police:&nbsp; Okay.     &nbsp;   Bart:&nbsp; Can he have his cell phone back?     &nbsp;   Police:&nbsp; Sure, why don't you boys come on down to the station and we'll give it back.     &nbsp;   Bart:&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Thanks!     &nbsp;   Here's the idiot part.&nbsp; Bartles and James go to the police station.&nbsp; That's right.&nbsp; The drive to the station to pick up the phone.&nbsp; When they walk in, they confess to everything and Jim uses his one call to call Michelle.     &nbsp;   J:&nbsp; I'm in jail.     &nbsp;   M:&nbsp; Good.     &nbsp;   J:&nbsp; Can you call my mom and arrange bail?     &nbsp;   M:&nbsp; Yes.     &nbsp;   J:&nbsp; It's Friday night.&nbsp; I can't get out until Monday morning.     &nbsp;   M:&nbsp; Good.     &nbsp;   J:&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Bye.     &nbsp;   M:&nbsp; Bye.     &nbsp;   Monday morning arrives and Michelle arrives at the police station with Jim's mom to get him out of jail.&nbsp; His mother gives him the classic lecture and then leaves.&nbsp; Michelle is left standing with Jim, fuming at the idiot for screwing up his life and hers.&nbsp; Her response to him was:     &nbsp;   "So, when did you read my journal?"     &nbsp;   Jim lowers his head, knowing he is defeated.&nbsp; There is no out anymore.&nbsp; "Okay, I read your journal.&nbsp; I'm sorry."     &nbsp;   M:&nbsp; Alright, now we can deal with everything else.&nbsp; Why, WHY would you do this to me?     &nbsp;   J:&nbsp; I didn't do this to you.     &nbsp;   M:&nbsp; Oh, oh yes you did.&nbsp; I'm counting on you to pay half the rent and I'm planning on spending my life with you, why, why would you do this to me?     &nbsp;   J:&nbsp; Whatever.     &nbsp;   Needless to say, Michelle and Jim broke up.&nbsp; He did try three weeks later to mend things by saying, "You should be over this by now."&nbsp; Not a good thing to say to Michelle.&nbsp; Especially after he threatened to kill her cat.&nbsp; He turned a little bit psycho.&nbsp; Jim and Bart both went in front of a judge and got their punishment.&nbsp; Jim moved out and Michelle's life is back to normal.&nbsp; Or as close as it can get.&nbsp;

      In honor of Fraud Prevention Week (well, in belated honor of Fraud Prevention Week), I thought posts on the different types of fraud might be a good idea.  And, in order to amuse, examples of the types of fraud will be offset with the morons who knew they were the victims of fraud and yet, didn't want to do anything about it.  Why?  Well, I thought I covered that when I said they were morons but okay, because they were stupid?  Today's post is about Check Fraud - Most people aren't aware that there is actually a black market for checking account numbers.  I know this because a) I watch 20/20 on occasion and b) I work in a bank.  It would stand to reason that I know what I'm talking about, right?   So, when your bank representative tells you that, since your checking account information is stolen, it would be a good idea to close your account, please listen.  I have spent many hours trying to convince customers of this.   Conversation with elderly woman.  DM:  Thank you for holding, ma'am.  My name is Dana and I'm a supervisor with NABABNA.  I understand your check book is missing but you don't want to close your account. Elderly Woman (EW):  That's right. DM:  Might I ask why? EW:  Because I got new checks.  Talk to my daughter.  (She hands the phone to her daughter) DM:  Hi.  I'm Dana.  Your mother wanted me to talk to you but unfortunately, I can't speak to you about her account.  I can, however, answer general questions. Overbearing Daughter (OD):  I think it's just ridiculous that NABABNA is forcing my mother to close my account.  She just bought $100 worth of new checks and now, you're forcing her to close this account and lose that $100. DM:  Okay.  I can understand how that... OD:  You're just doing this to make money.  I know how NABABNA works.  You're money hungry.  You figure that you'll make the customer have to order checks all over again and get another $100. DM:  I'm sorry you feel that way.  I wouldn't like you to feel that we are money hungry, we are simply trying to protect your mother's account from fraud.  OD:  Oh, please.  What could possibly happen if someone found her checkbook?  DM:  I'm glad you asked.  Here are some things that can happen.     I quickly give the customer and her daughter an example of all the things that can happen when your checkbook is stolen, such as the previously mentioned black market.  How just placing a stop payment on lost or stolen checks is not always enough because there are software programs that can be used to print checks at home.  How automatic payments can be set up using the stolen number.  How a stop payment only lasts for six months and sometimes the thiefs will wait until the six months is up and then start running the checks through.   OD:  You're just trying to scare us. DM:  Ma'am, could I please speak to your mother? EW:  Yes? DM:  Ms. Elderly Woman, your daughter thinks I am just trying to scare you.  However, what I'm trying to is protect your account.  You have $25,000 in this checking account.  If someone was to use your account in a fraudulent matter and you refuse to place the freeze on your account, you could be held responsible for the fraud.  I certainly think that the thought of losing $25,000 is much more serious than the fact that you just ordered checks for $100.  EW:  But they're really pretty checks.  They have kittens on them. DM:  (On mute, making the universally recognized weighing balance gesture with my hands)   Kitten checks...$25,000.  Kitten checks...$25,000.  Yeah, lady, you're right.  Save the kitten checks, that's so much more practical.   I understand that, ma'am.  I really think that $25,000 is a little more important. EW:  You're right.  Let's do this.  I go through the entire freeze process with the customer.  Between her and her daughter, there are a myriad of questions about every single aspect of the freeze.  This procedure normally takes 15 minutes, at the most.  Keep in mind I'd already spent a good 15 minutes convincing Ms. Elderly Woman that this was a good idea.  With all of the questions they were asking, another 45 minutes have passed.  I have spent an hour helping save all of this woman's money and I feel good about it.  I've done a good deed.  I am Super Banker.  Until I hear this...  EW:  Uh-oh. DM:  Excuse me? EW:  (Giggles)  I hope you won't be too mad at me. DM:  I'm sorry, I don't know what you mean. EW:  Oh, my daughter just found my checkbook.  It was in my other purse.  Sorry. DM:  (Through my clenched teeth)  Oh, that's wonderful.  Let me delete this freeze for you.  I'm glad you found your checkbook. EW:  Thank you.  Have a nice day.   And she is gone, off to spend her $25,000 with her brand new kitten checks.  Stupid woman.  What is our moral today?  If you're going to call the bank to report your checkbook stolen, make sure it's actually stolen.   If you have two purses, check them both!   Some of the places where customers have found their checkbook after placing a freeze:   Behind the toilet (why, I always balance my checkbook in the bathroom).  Underneath the bed (the cover is leather and the guy's cat had stolen the checkbook to play with it).  In their locked drawer at work (because, hey, why would I bother to look there when it's the place I always put my checkbook).   I know there are more but I can't think of them right now.  Beth and Keem will remind me of anything I've missed.

       Paperwork can sometimes be an inspiration. I was cleaning up my desk at work and came across a file of situations that were too unique to put aside forever. Sometimes they were customers I spent a long time talking to, sometimes the files in here are for customers with massive amounts of fraud or extremely complex situations, and then, sometimes the customers just say things that are, in a word, INSANE. There are quite a few different situations listed here and they are all a little bit different. Enjoy!      The first file I ran across tonight was for a woman I spoke to over 3 1/2 years ago. I will always remember her. Especially since she didn't actually bank with NABABNA, but thought she did. She never opened an account, never made deposits, never had any type of card for her non-existent accounts, but she BELIEVED that she might bank with us. I tried desperately to help her. The best part of the conversation is as follows:    Disenchanted Woman (DW): I need proof of my deposits into your bank.   B (me!): I am more than happy to help you if in fact you did actually bank with us. I'm trying to find any information about you in our systems. What is your Social Security number?   DW: 123-45-6789  (it was different than this, but I can't release information like that).    B: I tried that number and nothing pulls up.   DW: Well, that's my fake Social Security number. Of course you won't find anything.   B: Then why did you provide that number to me?   DW: In case you had it.   B: What is your real Social Security number?   DW: I'm not giving that out. I hate 60 Minutes. You know, the TV show. I hate it. And that dog for the RCA commercials.    B: Why won't you give our your Social Security number so I can see if you actually banked with us? I'm sorry that you don't like the dog on RCA commercials and that you don't like 60 Minutes.   DW: I was beat up by the Secret Service at LAX. They were looking for a white collar case. They strip-searched me. Then the police in Texas beat me up at the bank. The campus police beat me up and there's a statute of limitation.   B: I'm sorry to hear that.  Police don't just beat people up. I know this is hard to believe, but they don't just walk around and start hitting people. What did you do?     DW: Those people at the bank were mean to me and made the police beat me up.   B: My experience is that the branch will call the police if there is a problem, but they don't ask the police to beat people up. What happened?   DW: I'm not talking about that. Do you have my information? B: No, I would like to look with your  real  Social Security number.   DW: I'm not giving you that. How come you can't find my information? B: As of this time, you've provided me with your first name and a  fake  Social Security number. You said you might have banked with us sometime over 5 years ago, but you're not sure. Do you have any information I can look you up by? DW: I spoke to Jackie 3 years ago. She works for another company.   B: What?   DW: I called you because I want to talk to your head office.    B: But the head office is no where near here.   DW: Well, then I can talk to you.   B: Okay, about what exactly?   DW: About Wal-Mart of course.   B: Did Wal-Mart do something to your account?   DW: No.   B: Then there's no reason to talk to the bank about Wal-Mart.      Well, needless to say, this woman went on for over 2 hours about random things. She's been beaten up by many different law enforcement officers apparently and she never did actually bank with us. I'm still trying to figure out why a person would have a fake Social Security number. And why they would give it out when they haven't used it before.    When there is a problem (real or perceived), it is always more efficient to be helpful and polite to the representative helping you. Being difficult when a representative says they will help you only wastes your time.     One night I spoke with a gentleman who was not happy with the price of checks. Here's the deal, we don't really come up with the prices. An outside vendor prints our checks and for the quality of the checks, the price is worth it.     The guy had been a great customer so I told him I would reverse the fee for the checks as an exception. That's right, I told him he didn't have to pay. I gave him his request. Was he happy?    It would not be a good story if he was. I asked the gentleman for his phone number to complete the request. He spent 40, that's right folks, 40 minutes telling me that he would not give me his phone number. He said I already had it and that he didn't need to give it out. Unfortunately, if there is a problem and I need to call him back, I need him to actually tell me the number. I explained, politely, that I would be unable to reverse the fee without the phone number. He still wouldn't verify the number.     What does he start on now? He starts complaining about inflation and that the bank should give him an interest-free loan because the United States of America has inflation. Okay, let's break this down. Inflation is a fact of life. Alan Greenspan works very hard with interest rates trying to keep our economy alive and trying to keep inflation from rising. Money does lose value. This is a fact of life. All people have to deal with inflation. This is not his own personal problem.     Here's the other thing, loans are not interest free. The cost of using someone else's money is expensive and that is where interest comes in. Since you are borrowing the money from someone, they are unable to use it. That means the bank (or individual) cannot spend those funds on products/services, or invest the funds somewhere else. Interest-free loans do not happen.     So, the guy finally gives me his phone number. And then he asks for compensation for the last forty minutes of his time. At this point, I explained that I asked him forty minutes ago for his phone number and it was his choice to make the phone call last as long as it did. Sad to say, the customer was not pleased with the fact I wouldn't give him free money. I gave him free checks and I still don't understand his problem.    Automated Teller Machines    In this day and age, technology is jumping forward in leaps and bounds. You can use a card to access your account pretty much any time of day. Unfortunately, some people don't understand how to use an ATM. Here are some brief calls we've received at NABABNA about the ATM transactions:    Really, really drunk man (RRDM): Your machine wouldn't give me money! I gotta pay my tab.    Me: I'm happy to help. Let's troubleshoot the problem. Where in the transaction did the machine deny the transaction?    RRDM: It didn't work and didn't give me money.    Me: Did you get a message before or after you put in your personal identification number?    RRDM: Before.    Me: Okay, so you put your card in the machine and it denied the transaction right then?    RRDM: You have to put your card in the machine?     No, the machine is psychic. You can just walk up and it starts spitting money at you. What? Please, please tell me you have a designated driver.     Mr. Fix-It (FI): I have a problem.    Me: I'd like to help you out. What happened?    FI: Well, I went to the ATM to make a deposit and I put the envelope with my check in the card slot.     Me:  How did you make it fit?  And it's stuck now?    FI: Yes. I need my deposit.    Me: I can file a claim and call our support area to report the broken machine.    FI: Well, I went home and got the pliers, but I still can't get the envelope back out.    Me: Um, let me file the claim and in the future, please don't try to open an ATM without being a bank employee.    Whinny Woman (WW): My deposit is missing.    Me: How did you make the deposit?    WW: Well, I didn't really make it.    Me: How is it missing then?    WW: On the way to the ATM, I dropped my check in the crack.    Me: In the sidewalk?    Turns out, the woman didn't drop the check. She forced it into the slot between the machine and the wall because she somehow thought that's where it went. Then she realized that there's a spot for deposits and it's actually on the machine.    And technology has gone too far. There are now machines that have options for visually impaired individuals, which is a great thing. These customers have headphones and can listen to the machine if they have troubles seeing the screen. Here's the guy who picked this option and should not have:    Mr. I-Can't-Handle-My-Money (ICHMM): I used one of those speaking machines and it embarrassed me!    Me: I'm sorry about that sir. Did you use the headphones?    ICHMM: No. I'm not blind.     Me: Okay. Why did you select the talking option?    ICHMM: I wanted to see what happened.    Me: The machine talked to you then?    ICHMM: Yes, it took my card and this computer voice loudly stated, "Your card has been detained!" I'm so embarrassed. I want my card back.    Me: Unfortunately, your account was not handled properly and the card is ultimately the property of the bank. I am unable to get you a new card.     ICHMM: Your card has been detained! Your card has been detained! ( Yes, he kept imitating the computer voice)  I hate you people! Your card has been detained! Dial tone.....    Back to silly calls that don't involve ATMs:    This call was from a man (Would Benefit from Anger Management (WBFAM)) whose account was closed due to threats at the bank.     Me: Thank you for holding Mr. WBFAM. My name is Beth. How can I help you?    WBFAM: That's a weird name for a girl. Your name is really strange.    Long pause. This is me sitting is stunned silence. Maybe I'm biased, but Beth is not an unusual name. It's not as common as Jennifer or Kim, but it's not unusual. Whatever.    Me: How can I help you?    WBFAM: The people at your bank followed all the regulations passed by Congress and I'm pissed off.    Me: I want to understand. You are upset that the bank employees followed the law?    WBFAM: Yes. I wanted to do a whole bunch of investment fraud and they wouldn't let me.    Me: The bank wouldn't let you commit fraud and this upsets you?    WBFAM: I'm going to give your company $100,000 in bad publicity because you followed the law! These are bogus laws!     Me: Sir, if you do not agree with the laws passed by the Federal government, I suggest speaking with your Congressman or an attorney.     WBFAM: The line in the bank was too long. There were 100 people in line and only two people working. There were two people on break. I was in line for an hour and fifteen minutes!    This is where he hung up. Here's the question I have. How is it bad publicity to have a customer go to the press stating the bank did not break the law? Also, how would he know if two people were on break if they weren't in the bank? I've worked in branches before. I've never seen 100 people in line. I don't think I've ever seen a line that lasted more than 10 minutes.     Here's another long line story (that I will honestly say I don't believe):    Insane Woman (IW): I went to the bank. I was in line for over an hour. The line was so long, I had to take a taxi to get through it.  (What? How do you take a taxi inside a bank?)  While I was getting into the taxi, someone ran over my suitcase! Can you believe that? Someone ran over my suitcase!  (Why, why, why did you bring a suitcase to the bank? What is the purpose of that? It's not like you can camp there. No one goes, hey, I'm on vacation, I think I'll check out a room at the bank and sightsee. What was this woman on?)     And finally, one of the scariest calls I've ever received. I didn't actually get to talk during this call, the gentleman just started on a rant and then hung up. This call did involve contacting security and the shut down of this person's account. Believe me, threatening the lives of bank employees, other customers, or yourself is not something that is taken lightly by the bank. Here's the call:    Upset man: I'm bi-polar and my medication makes me tired. I fell asleep on the bus and someone stole my ATM card. I want to get the money from my account but I don't have a card and the nearest bank is over 3 hours away. I want to have my money now and you need to give it to me. I'm going to write to Reader's Digest and expose NABABNA for following the rules. I lived in DC with this guy before who took advantage of me because of my mental illness. I left there and moved in with this woman in [deleted state] who I thought I loved but she also took advantage of me and laughed at me. She stole my money and she had another guy move in and he wears my clothes. I spent last night at a homeless shelter and I haven't had an address for three months now but your employees should track me down and give me my statements. I am going to kill someone at your bank if you don't get me my money right now.     And that's when he hung up. All of this was over $12. That's right. Twelve dollars. He was serious that the bank should be able to make twelve dollars appear in his hands immediately. Luckily, the man was three hours away from the nearest branch but we still took all precautions. People like this scare me. Threatening others is not something that is beneficial or allowed. My advice to him (and many others that we've dealt with at work) is to think before you speak.

       On occasion, I have answered the phone to have a slightly hysterical banker on the line. The banker is hysterical because their customer has turned a simple transaction, such as getting a balance, into dialogue for a pornographic movie.  Now, the sad thing about this is that, dude, we're your bank. We have your account information, we have your name and we know where you live. Why, why would you call us when there are so many other places you could call anonymously? Hey, I've got an idea. Next time, skip the bank. Call the police and start harassing them. Avoid the middle man. Because, you moron, do you really think we're going to just sit there and say "Oh, yes, sir, it's so sexy when you say those words to me. What a turn on!" If you do, you are dumber than we already think.  Here are just some examples of things people will say (my remarks are in italics, as usual):     "Can you go through my account? I want to know all of the checks that have cleared my account in the last 90 days." Banker begins reading information off to customer. "Oh, yeah. Would you read that slower? Ooh." Banker hears noises that you don't normally hear during a phone call. Sounds involving lotion and friction. Then there's a low moan. "Okay, thanks. You can stop now. You've been very helpful."  Can I just say "Eew?"       "You have an accent. What nationality are you?" Banker informs the customer that she is Chinese. "Ooh, are you a hot Chinese chick? You suckee long time?"  Oh, yes, let's meet now! I'm so turned on by your stereotypical remark that I can't wait to meet you!       Sometimes the customer gets really intelligent and starts mentioning random words such as "P*ssy" or "C*ck."  Oh, mister, I love animals as well. Let's have some barnyard fun. I'll call you Jackass.       "What is your name? How do you spell that? Is that S as in Sex?"  Yes, sir, that's exactly what my mother had in mind when she named me.        "You are really nice. May I have your phone number so I can have my son call you? He needs to date a nice girl. If he did, maybe he'd get a job and move out of the house.  You know, I was just telling my friends the other day that what I was really looking for was an unemployed guy who lives with his parents. That's my Prince Charming!       When the banker ignores the customer's inappropriate remarks and tries to keep the call on a professional level, the customer says "Oh, I'm sorry. Don't be mad at me. I'm being a dick. I'm a big dick."  Sounds like someone thinks a bit highly about themselves...if you were such a big dick, maybe you could find an actual date?       The customer has called in and filed five separate research tickets. On the same item. In one hour. Turned out that he was calling in for other reasons which were revealed when he started moaning when a banker started reading off a reference number. It turned out that this customer called in 30 times a day.  Yes, sir, reference numbers make me hot as well. Let's read it together...12345678. Oh, baby, oh baby, oh. You stud.       About 15 years ago, I used to work for this submarine shop. Now, this, perverts of America, is the type of place you want to call. You can just dial a random number and harass away (please, please don't take me seriously. Calls can be traced, it is illegal to make obscene and harassing phone calls, just go and buy yourself some porn, okay?). We used to get calls every night, on the hour. I will never forget my first night.    The phone rings. I answer the phone.    DM: Thank you for calling The Sub Shop. This is Dana, may I take your order? Ham Sandwich Guy (Ham): Yes, I would like to visit your fine establishment and partake of a submarine sandwich. DM: Wonderful, sir. We'd be happy to have you visit us tonight. Ham: But wait, before I can come down there, I must ask you a question. DM: Okay. Ham: What type of ham sandwiches do you have? DM: Why we have a ham and cheese submarine sandwich, a Hot Ham and Cheese sandwich and also a ham salad sandwich. Ham: My, those sound yummy (swear to God, this is how this guy talked). DM: Yes, they are very good. May I start an order for you? Ham: Oh, well, before I can visit you, I must ask you. Do you have any girls working there tonight with long hair? DM: Um, actually, we all have long hair, sir. But we do wear hair nets (and really exciting brown derby hats as well). Ham: Oh, no. I'm afraid of women with long hair. DM: What? Ham: Oh, but, I might be able to get over my fear. Are any of you wearing sweaters? DM: It's January. In Minnesota (and our owner is too cheap to get the heating fixed). Yes, we are wearing sweaters. Ham: Oh, that's too bad. I'm afraid of women with long hair but I'm terrified of women with long hair in sweaters. I won't be able to come in tonight. Goodbye.  I just stand there, staring blankly at the phone. The assistant manager walks by. "What's wrong?" she asks. I start my sentence with "I just got the weirdest call about ham sandwiches" and she starts laughing. And then tells me he's relatively harmless. It's the other ones I have to watch out for.  And she's right. While working there, I was flashed, propositioned, threatened, learned how to ask someone to go to bed with me in French and had a fairly interesting time. The obscene phone calls came nightly. You learned how to deal with them and just went on with your life. Because the owner was too cheap to put a trace on the phone as well.  Here's another fairly memorable example:  DM: Thank you for calling The Sub Shop. This is Dana, may I take your order? Random Pervert (RP): What type of hot sandwiches do you have? DM: I'd be happy to help you with that, sir. We offer a Hot Ham and Cheese, a Meatball Sub, a really weird sandwich with black and green olives (don't remember the name of the sub).   RP: Oh, well, I have a really hot and juicy Italian sausage I'd like to sell you. Are you interested in hot and juicy Italian sausages? DM (tired and cranky and I have 8 real customers in the store): I'm sorry, sir. But all orders must be placed through the office. Here is their number. Maybe they will be interested in your hot and juicy Italian sausage.  I hang up the phone. I walk back up front to wait on my actual customers. And every single one of them is looking at me dumbfounded. We all have a good laugh at the random pervert's expense. And this really nice guy answered the phone for the next 15 minutes because random pervert was ticked off and kept calling back. Finally, the really nice guy introduced himself to random pervert. "Yes, sir, this is Officer Mike Johnson from the Saint Paul Police Department. Please stop calling or I will have this call traced."  So when you call me and ask me to read your bank information to you slowly, all I have to say is "Honey, I've dealt with better and more creative perverts than you. Get a life. And look into getting a new account, because yours is going to be closed."

      Look, if you're going to buy a house, there's going to be some things you need to know. I don't know much about the whole mortgage thing but, working for NABABNA, there has been some things that I have discovered. And I will give you this list now, because I am a nice person and quite frankly, I am getting sick and tired of people calling me the day before their closing and asking for statements for the last year.  When you approach the mortgage people, ask them exactly what you will need for your closing or any other random things they might want. They will lie. They probably don't mean to lie but they will. They will ask you for some things and tell you that's all they need and, at the very last minute, they will say "Oh, by the way, we need photocopies of a check you wrote 3 years ago. Just for fun, let's say it has to start with the number 5 and be written to a cable company. Because we're just evil bastards." Okay, they probably don't say they are evil bastards.   But they are.  Trust me on this.  I've never bought a house but, from working in the Call Center for NABABNA, I have come across some odd requests. Here are some things you may want to have on hand before you even go to apply for the mortgage, let alone have a closing date.  Oh, and for the record, it goes without saying that you will need your last 12 statements. And the last 12 rent checks you wrote out. Be smart, ask for photocopies early. Do not be one of these people (This is an example of one of probably 30 calls I have received over this):  DM: I'm sorry, sir, I understand that you are closing today. However, while I would be happy to order your photocopies, I cannot guarantee that you will receive them in one hour. Time Challenged Moron (TC): But you're my baaaaaannnk (Yes, he actually wailed. I thought I was talking to a 12 year old for a moment)! You have to get me this! DM: I'm sorry, sir. It is impossible for me to get these photocopies in one hour. TC: Well, you better! I'm going to lose my house and it will be all your fault! DM: May I ask, sir, when did you know you would need these photocopies? TC: Three months ago. Why? DM: I see. And it didn't occur to you to contact us earlier? TC: Well, I'm busy! I am a powerful person!  I am Zeus, the All-Powerful  (okay, remember, italics for the customer are what I think he wants to say, not what he actually did)! Get me my copies! I want you to go to the warehouse and get them! DM: Sir. It is not possible for me to go to a warehouse and get these copies for you. They are on microfiche and will be retrieved by our Photo Unit. I have placed the order. The request will be completed tomorrow and please allow 3-5 days for delivery. TC: Do you know who I am? I am going to call So-and-So (names someone I have never heard of but, when I later look up in the employee database, discover he is talking about the District Manager for 3 branches halfway across the country. Ooh. Scary) and have you fired (He hangs up). DM: Thank you for calling NABABNA, sir. I am sorry I was unable to assist you further.  Here are some of the things your mortgage company might also ask you for, waiting until the last minute:    Copies of checks you wrote to them for earnest money   Copies of checks you wrote to someone to repair the home you are moving out of to prove that you actually did do the repairs   Copies of statements that have your name on it (if you are on a joint account and have known for 2 years that your name is not showing up on the statement but your wife's is, do not call us the day before your closing and ask us to fix it. We can't)   It's not that we don't want to help you. It's just that my magic wand broke and I can't will these things into existence. And it doesn't help when the mortgage company rep gets on the line and starts screaming "Well, you're a bank! You should be able to get this stuff for the customer! They're going to lose the home!" I always want to scream back "Well, you're a mortgage company! You should have told the customer they needed this stuff two months ago! And you don't care if they lose the home, you care that you're going to lose your comission!"

       Did you know that....      Writing a check to yourself from your overdrawn account and then depositing that check into the same account at an atm that that is considered kiting from your own account and your account will be closed?  (customer response: Oh, I guess I shouldn't have done that...  ya think? )      Statements are sent out by the bank to help you balance your account? (yes, there are people in the world that truly don't know what a statement is)      Just because there is a commercial on TV telling you that if you travel and only bring your check card with you that that doesn't mean the bank can help you if your card is lost or possibly closed without your knowledge?  (Unfortunately, your card can be closed at any time and it is only one way to access your account.  It is not the bank's fault if you only bring your check card with you as your only means of payment)      That the bank is not 411?  (we do not have the number to another bank of your choosing, your local police department, etc.)      If you don't balance your statements for years and there is an unauthorized charge, the bank cannot dispute anything older than 6 months?  Here's my conversation with Mr. X:      Mr. X:  I just balanced my account statements for the last 9 years.  I have unauthorized debits from Company A.     K:  Well, Mr. X, I would be happy to file a claim for you.  Unfortunately, I would only be able to go back 6 months.   Mr. X:  You don't understand!  I didn't authorize this charge!  I cancelled my subscription 9 years ago.  They have no right to take out this money.  They have been charging me $50.00 a month for the last 9 years.  You are my bank!  You have to fix this and get my money back.   K:  I would love to help you get all of your money back Mr. X, however, I am unable to dispute anything over 6 months.  Why haven't you been balancing your account on a monthly basis?   Mr. X:  I don't worry about my account as I have plenty of money.  I don't have to balance my account every month.  You need to fix this.  I want my money back.   K:  Well Mr. X, I can file a claim on the last 6 months of transactions that are unauthorized.  For anything older than that, please contact Company A.     (at this point the conversation is stuck in a loop)      Moral of this story:  Always balance your account and check your statements or you could be out $5,400.00 too.        **all information above based loosely on actual conversation with the customer.      Now to continue on with more fun while working at the convenience store....      I eventually got tired of managing a convenience store and started managing a Tobacco Outlet.  That was interesting as I am not even a smoker.  Funny thing is that I actually created training material on Cigars to be used in our stores for co-workers to assist customers.  Occasionally, I would have a break in in the middle of the night.  This isn't specifically what people said, but more what they did.      #1.  At one point, the power had gone out in my store, actually the entire neighborhood was without power due to severe weather.  I came into work the next day and called the home office about the power outage.  They were asking for it by telling me to put a sign on the door saying "Closed due to Power Outage."  Keep in mind that there was a security system in the store.  It has battery back-up, but it only lasted for 24 hours.  Can you imagine what happened?  The jerks took a metal cutter and cut around the dead-bolt in the door.  Pulled the door free and took merchandise and cigs.  Hmmm...think that one might have been a little inviting?  I should have put up a sign that says "Battery back-up only lasts 24 hours..come back at midnight if you want to steal anything..you'll be in the clear."      #2.  If you are trying to shoplift, don't stand in the middle of the store in plain view and put a carton of cigs in the sleeve of your coat and then deny it when I have it on tape.      #3.  If you are going to be intelligent enough to attempt to shoplift, don't make it obvious by walking directly into the shelf to grab some Swisher Sweets and tell me that you have to go outside and talk to your girlfriend.  Didn't work did it?      I have to say that it was definitely fun to work there.  I'll have to blog the shoplifting and break ins on my other blog.  I'm just not doing that fast to irritate Dana.  :)  Hee hee.

       The following story is based on actual events. I wouldn't say that it would necessarily warrant calling the people involved morons, however, the customers in the store could very possibly qualify for the title. Prior to working at NABABNA, I worked for a convenience store. The great thing is that I can say anything I want to about it. Trust me, I have tons of material that would fit. I just have to have the time to actually write it. I hope you enjoy the first installment.      Imagine being the manager of this store. It is in a very, very unsafe neighborhood (had I realized it at the time, I probably wouldn't have chosen that particular store). The store had video cameras, however, you weren't able to see the entire store on any given camera. Knowing this, it will explain how this actually happened. If you are going into the back room of the store and find someone (who doesn't actually work there, by the way) in the back room, wouldn't you think it was odd if it happened more than one day in a row? Here's the conversation I had with the manager:      Scott: Keem, you aren't going to believe what happened at my store!   Keem: Well, Scott, considering where the store is located, I'm sure this is going to be good. What happened?   Scott: Okay, so I walked into the back room on Monday and found a customer wandering around back there. I asked him what he was doing and he told me he was looking for the restroom. I didn't really think much of it at the time, but I told him it was on the other side of the store.   Keem: Interesting. Kinda makes it easy for someone to go into the back room when the door doesn't actually lock (but then it's hard when it's a revolving door, I guess ).    Scott: On Tuesday I found the same guy in the back room again. I did think it was strange this time. He didn't have a good excuse this time.    Keem: (at this point I'm just trying to figure out what this is leading up to ...)    Scott: So imagine my surprise when I came to work yesterday and was shocked to find that the TV was missing from the back room.   Keem: OMG Scott! How could that happen? It's not like we do TV repair or anything. Didn't anyone say anything? Did you see anything on the store video?   Scott: You have to see the video. When you are done at your store, come on by and watch this.   Keem: Okay Scott. I'll be there in a little bit.      At this point, I arrive at the store and am kind of curious how someone could get a TV out of the back room of the store and walk it right out the front door without anyone seeing or saying anything.       Before explaining the video, I'll explain how the store looks. The store is set up so that it's pretty much a rectangle. If facing the back of the store from the front, customers enter on your right. There are three rows of shelves split so that there are actually six sections. There are windows on the right side after the doors and the bathrooms are in the back on the right wall. On the left are the cooler/freezer doors and the back room door after the freezer. This is the basic set up of the store. You'd think that it would be easy to see everything from the register. However, the person at the register has to see past the rather large computer monitor that is the display for the register..I'm not talking small either. I would say that they are about 17" monitors. If you can see past the monitor, there are 2 banana trees beyond that (a banana tree is a display that has bananas stacked on the top, bread below that, bins for specials below the bread and then pop or other items stacked under that).       Now we settle in our chairs to watch the video unfold. There are 4 cameras in the store that show the view of the registers up front, the coffee bar, the front doors and down the first aisle by the cooler/freezer doors. We see 5 men (so as not to stereotype, I'll withhold and further details) standing by the freezer. Then there were 4. It was hard to see where the 5th man went as they were rather obviously standing around the back room door. Hmmmm...I wonder what he could possibly be doing. So the next thing you know, there he is holding this rather large, black, box-like object. This store is extremely busy at this point...can't anyone see what is going on? The 4 men proceed to block the 5th man with the TV. At this point they move to their left (my right) and they go off camera. I, at this point, am imagining the Flinstone tippy-toe effect. I can see them going from the end of one aisle to the next hiding behind the end caps. After about 5 minutes we see them march right up the aisle by the windows and right out the doors. Not a single person stopped them. Not one!       I almost fall out of my chair after seeing this.       Keem: Scott! How could Heather and Don not see this at all?!?   Scott: I have no idea! I would have seen this.    Keem: Why didn't customers see it? It's not like we do TV repair. Wouldn't you think it was odd to see 5 men carrying a TV and trying to be inconspicuous about it?    Scott: I can't figure it out. Let's re-enact it to see what they would have seen.   Keem: Okay Scott.       At this point, we realized that it was because of the monitors and the banana trees blocking the view. My only question is this: If you were a customer and saw this, wouldn't you mention it to someone?       There is a first time for everything. I would say that I've seen everything now, but sadly, I haven't. Here are a few quick ones about situations that happened while working for the same company.      This is an actual event in my home town. Sadly, my roommate from hell (I would think that everyone has had one of these at one point and time) knew the guy and was best friends with his wife. I had the opportunity to meet him once. Let's just say that he was a few cards short of a full deck. They say that robberies are often spur-of-the-moment rather than planned out. So a guy comes into the store with a shotgun and has the cashiers clean out the registers. He leaves the store and flees the scene of the crime. Imagine the clerk calling 911 and telling them that they were robbed. When asked about the robber, they told them that he took off on a bicycle and has the money and a shot gun. Hmmmm...do you think he got very far? Imagine my surprise the next morning when it was in the paper and my roommate and I realized that it happened to be her best friend's husband. Could it possibly be because he was going crazy working as a caretaker in the local cemetery? Yeah, I'd go crazy too if I could only talk to dead people at work. HA! I'm surprised that this didn't end up on Stupidest Criminals.      One guy that worked for the company had been held up and thought that he could prevent the thief from being successful because he was going to school to be a cop. He told the thief that he had to get something to scan from the shelf in order to open the cash register. Any guess on what happened? Yeah, don't piss off a person that is holding you at gun point or you just might get pistol-whipped. He was lucky he didn't get shot. I'm sorry folks, but if I am being held at gunpoint I'm going to cooperate. My life just isn't worth losing for my minimum wage job (okay, it wasn't exactly minimum wage, but it still isn't worth my pitiful salary).       My favorite part about working for the company as a manager was the interview process. You wouldn't believe the people. We were required to conduct security interviews for the second round interviews with a drug test to follow if they were someone you determined that was worth hiring. Here are some of the questions we were required to ask:      Have you ever done drugs?   Specifically Pot or Cocaine.   Have you ever stolen anything? Even as a small child? If you did, why did you steal? Will you ever steal again? What did you learn from stealing?   Have you ever bought stolen merchandise? Why or why not?   How did you know it was stolen?      Of course you tell the applicant at the beginning of the interview that everyone has done something at some point and time in their life. I am looking for honesty. If you aren't honest with me now, it will be harder to trust you in the future. Yeah. Honesty. If you tell me you did drugs, better luck next time.       Here are some of my favorites:      Keem: Well Jason, I would like to hire you. I have an appointment set up for you at the clinic for a drug test. You have to take it now. Once I get the results, as long as you pass, you will be hired.    Jason: I have to be honest with you. I tried Pot for the first time last night. Is that okay?      Keem: Mark, have you ever bought stolen merchandise?   Mark: Yeah, I buy it all the time.   Keem: Really, why?   Mark: You know, I know it's stolen, but the police never really do anything. I just report it and they give me this report number. They tell you that they will contact you if it comes up in an insurance report or whatever.   Keem: Wow. I'm surprised that they just give you a report number. I wonder why they don't do more than that. What types of stolen merchandise/property do you buy?   Mark: Stereos, speakers, radios, that kind of thing. Sometimes some clothes or whatever.   Keem: Well, Mark, it was great to talk to you. I should have my decision in a day or so.      Keem: (to the manager who did the initial interview) Shireen, I wouldn't hire him.   Shireen: But I really like him. He'd be great for the store.   Keem: I know, but he buys stolen merchandise. I don't think he'll work out. It's great that he was honest and all, but I don't trust him.    Shireen: Are you sure?    Keem: Yes, I know you liked him and this is the first person you've hired and all, but he won't work out.   Shireen: Okay. I understand.

       Let's face it. People need to talk. I understand that people like to hear words come out of their mouths, but try to understand and find the correct forum for this type of blabber. In working at the NABABNA call center for over 4 years, I've come across some extremely strange situations. I'm not trying to make fun of these people, but there are some calls that may have been crank calls, perverts, and psych ward patients.       One of the favorite calls I ever took for strangeness (and I think this was a crank, I really do) is as follows:   B: Thanks for calling NABABNA. This is Beth. How can I help you?   Mr. I-Need-a-Friend (INAF): I was shopping today and I saw a million dollar bill on sale for $1.99.   B: You saw a novelty item at the drug store?   INAF: What would happen if I bought it and spent it?   B: The Secret Service or the Federal Bureau of Investigation would arrest you for trying to pass counterfeit money.   INAF: Oh. Do you think my family would like one of these for Christmas?   B: I'm sorry Mr. INAF, but unfortunately I am unable to speak about the tastes of your family members. I'm not related to you or know your family.   INAF: Oh. I saw an ad on TV for presidential coins. When will they come out with the George W. Bush coin?   B: Unfortunately, I don't know. You might want to contact the Office of the Treasury.    INAF: You don't make the money?   B: No. The government handles the printing and minting of US Currency. We are a public bank. We could not make the physical money, that would be counterfeiting.    INAF: Would you like it if someone in your family gave you a million dollar bill?   B: Personally? No.   INAF: What's the largest bill in circulation?   B: In circulation? The largest bill that is commonly used is the $100 bill. The $1,000 bill hasn't been printed since the 1960s and when they come into circulation, they are pulled and given back to the Federal Reserve.    INAF: I think my family would like the million dollar bill for Christmas.   B: Then it's your choice to buy it for them.   INAF: I can't spend it?   B: No.   INAF: What if someone accepted it? B: Then they'd get into a lot of trouble.   INAF: I don't want to get anyone in trouble.   B: Then I'd suggest not trying to pass it as a legitimate form of currency.   INAF: Okay. So, who do you like for presidential candidates?   B: Sir, I work for the bank. I can discuss banking related topics with you.   INAF: Oh. Can we talk about the million dollar bill some more?   B: Sir, that has nothing to do with NABABNA. Did you have any NABABNA related questions or concerns about your account?   INAF: No.   B: Thanks for calling. Have a good night.   INAF: Bye!      Another call received at our call center. This one was not a prank. This was a legitimate person who needed help. This one actually made me a little sad and I understand why we have hospitals and people who devote their lives to this type of work. I admire the people who can handle this on a regular basis. The thing is, we are not trained for this at the bank. We are trained to help with accounts. That's what we do. Here's the call that was taken by a co-worker. I'll call her Sugar. That's how she sounded on the call. Sweet, caring, and helpful. I'll call the customer Personalities? Multiple. Syndrome. Otherwise known as PMS.      Sugar: Thanks for holding. My name is Sugar. How can I help you?   PMS: You're letting people steal money from my account!   Sugar: I'm sure I can help you. Are you stating there is fraud on your account?   PMS: Yes! Stop letting them take my money!   Sugar: Do you know who is taking your money?   PMS: Of course I do. It's my twin sister who no one else can see.   Sugar: Uh...   PMS: Make her stop.   Sugar: Let's start with the fraud claim. Which transactions are fraudulent?   PMS: I don't know.   Sugar: Which ones don't match your checkbook register?   PMS: They all match.   Sugar: So, all the transactions that cleared are ones you know about and you wrote in your register?   PMS: I didn't know about all of them. My sister writes them down in the register and then balances my checkbook for me.   Sugar: So you don't know if any of the transactions are fraudulent?   PMS: Well, some of them are. I have more money.   Sugar: Is there anyone who can help you go through your register to see which transactions are yours?   PMS: No. My sister is married to the Arch-Angel Michael and he works here at the hospital. They're all on her side.   Sugar: But no one can see her?   PMS: Well, Michael can.   Sugar: And he works at the hospital? PMS: Yes.   Sugar: And that's where you are?   PMS: Yes.   Sugar: Is there anyone there I can talk to?   PMS: Here's my caregiver.   Caregiver: Hello?   Sugar: Hi, my name's Sugar and I work for the bank. I want to help this person, do you know if this is a legitimate call?   Caregiver: She needs more medication. I was just coming in to give her the next dose. I'll handle it from here.   Sugar: Thanks for calling...      We get a lot of calls that don't need to come to the bank. People share information with us that they really shouldn't. Some of my favorites:      "I just brushed my teeth with Pesident. My breath is fresh. What type of toothpaste do you use?"   "Thank you for telling me when that purchase to the discount store was. Now I know the last time I menstruated and I can't be pregnant."   "My sister had a problem with ovarian cancer. Make sure you get tested. I worry for all women."   "I just had a hysterectomy. They took out all of my insides!"   "But I need more money. How am I going to pay for this prostitute?" "Do you smoke crack? I do. Crack, crack, crack, crack, crack!"   "Herpes are forever." "Public drinking fountains spread disease."   "I got beat up by the cops are LAX."   "Oh look! A car upside down on the side of the road."   "We're just happy little chipmunks."   "I'm naked. How old are you?"   "I need a girlfriend. Can you help with this?" (To which I replied, "Unfortunately, NABABNA does not offer a dating service." That's right. I did actually say this.)   "My neighbor's house is blue."   "But I need that money. I want to date my cousin and I need to go online and pay for the service to find her. She has beautiful eyes."      I did not make up any of these. I have a list that I keep. To get on the list, you need to be odd.

      I've received many an escalated call regarding joint accounts, enough to make me decide that if I ever finally find the guy just warped enough to marry me, there's no way his name is going on my account. I have enough problems trying to remember what I'm spending my money on, let alone worry about anyone else. Here are some examples of some of the calls I've received over the years.   Thou Shalt Not Commit Adultery  Look, whatever you do is between you and God, okay? If you want to flout your disregard of one of the 10 Commandments in His face, well, better you than me, is all I can say. But, c'mon, if you're going to cheat, be smart about it. Your spouse is going to figure it out eventually, especially if you use your check card to buy your new sweetie a special gift.  I received a phone call from a banker who was having some problems with a non-customer. She was demanding to speak to a supervisor.  DM: Thank you for holding. I understand you wished to speak to a supervisor. Clueless Woman (CW): What are these overdraft fees for? I don't bank with NABABNA. DM: I'm sorry, I'm not sure of what the situation is, the banker said you couldn't be identified. CW: This is just stupid. This is a mistake and I'm going to prove it and then you're going to be sorry! Here is the account number...(she rattles the number off to me) DM: Okay, I have pulled up that account. May I have your name, please? CW: Clueless Woman. DM: I'm sorry, Ms. Woman, I'm not showing your name on this account. CW (Deep sigh tinged with sarcasm): That's what I'm trying to tell you. I don't bank at NABABNA. Why am I getting overdraft fees? DM: Unfortunately, I can't discuss this account with you since it's not in your name. CW: No, it's in my husband's name, Cheating Jerk. But we bank with Bank of Bank so he shouldn't be getting these overdraft fees. DM: Have you checked with him to see if he opened an account with us? CW: Well, why would he do that? That's just stupid. This is all your fault. You people screwed up and put his name on the account and mailed the statements to our house and started charging overdraft fees and he doesn't even have an account with you! DM: I see. I'd suggest that you speak to him about this, ma'am. Unless you're a signer, I can't release any information to you. CW: And look at this! Look at this statement! It's got a deposit from Large Corporation, where he works, in his name and with his Social Security Number. How did you get his SS#? DM: I'm sorry, I can't discuss this account with you (On mute:  He's hiding money from you! ). CW: And look at these purchases! Why would he possibly have any reason to make these purchases? Why would he go to Sleazy Bar or visit Sex Shoppe or Lingerie Store? He would have no reason to go there! DM: Ma'am, I'm sorry, again, I can't discuss this with you ( Oh, you poor deluded woman ). CW: Stop saying that! You keep saying the same thing over and over again! Quit it! I know this is a mistake! There's no reason for my husband to go to the By The Hour Motel! Tell me what's going on! Continued screaming! You people! I'll sue! Arrrrrrrrrrrgggggghhhhh! DM: Ma'am. Please calm down. This is not helping the situation. I would suggest that you speak to your husband about this. Unfortunately, I cannot answer any of your questions. CW (Deep frustrated sigh): He's cheating on me, isn't he? DM: I really, really wish I could answer that question for you, ma'am. Unfortunately, I can't discuss this with you. I would suggest speaking to your husband ( or your lawyer  (telepathically transmitted through the phone)). CW: Screw him. I'm getting a lawyer. Thank you.  She disconnected. I look at the phone. "Are you aware it's illegal to open mail addressed to someone else?" I ask her. There is no answer, of course, because she's hung up. I sometimes wonder what happened to her.   I'm Going To Tell My Mommy On You!  Why would you open up a checking account with your teenager? Well, if you were to do a survey about this, you would find that the majority of customers say it's because it's a great way to teach your child responsibility and how to balance a checkbook. And it is true, this is the best way to reach those goals. However, I have run into just a few situations where these good intentions are thrown out the window.  The following call is an amalgamation, if you will, of several calls I have received. In each of these calls, the teenager was the one using the account, the parent was only on the account to make transfers easier. So, since the teenager's the one using the account and they're being so responsible now, you would think they would be the one who would call about overdraft fees, right? Right? Wrong. Welcome to my world. Remember, italics are what I'm thinking. I would never ever talk this way to a customer. Really. Now, where the customer's concerned, the italics is what I imagine they are saying.  Banker: Dana (sadly, no one calls me DM in real life), I have an irate customer who is upset that there are overdraft fees on her joint account with her daughter (oddly enough, the majority of these calls are from the mother. An occasional Dad will call but not that often. And, yes, sometimes it's the son who screws up as well). She wants to speak to a supervisor and wouldn't let me identify her. DM (sighs inaudibly):  Joy.  I'd be happy to help her. Put her through (Banker introduces customer to me). Thank you for holding. My name is Dana. I understand you're calling about overdraft fees? Rabid Parent (RP): How dare you charge me overdraft fees! I have a great account and I refuse to pay overdraft fees! I've been banking with NABABNA for 15 years and I bring in a lot of money and I hold my mortgage with you and I'm not going to pay these fees! DM: Ma'am, I'd be happy to help you but first I need to ask you some questions. RP: Ask your questions! Go ahead, ask them! I dare you! DM:  Freak.  May I have the account number in question? RP: I don't know what it is, it's not my account! DM: I'm sorry, I wouldn't be able to speak to you unless you're a signer on the account. RP: Well, I am a signer but it's not my account! It's my daughter's. God, you're so stupid. DM:  Um, the minute you signed that account application, it became your account. Who's stupid now?  Okay, do you have any other accounts with NABABNA? RP: Well, yes. I told you I did! DM: Could I have an account number, please? RP: I just told you I didn't have...oh, any account number? (Rattles off account number) DM: Thank you. (I follow the procedures to identify the customer) Okay, Ms. Parent, I'd be happy to assist you. What concerns you about this account? RP: I'm being charged overdraft fees! DM: Yes, I do show that this account first became overdrawn two weeks ago and now has a balance of  -$163.52 . There were two items that overdrew the account and there were two fees assessed at $50 each (Note: This isn't how much our overdraft fees are. They are expensive, just not that expensive). RP: Well, I'm not paying them. This account can just stay negative for all I care. You bloodsuckers! DM: Ms. Parent, I apologize for your frustration but the account became overdrawn because of purchases that were made. We disclose all applicable fees to our customers at the time they open the account. I'd be happy to go through the account with you and determine if there was a bank error... RP: How would I know? This isn't my account! You stupid c-word! DM:  Don't call me names.  Ms. Parent, I'm trying to assist you. Please refrain from such language. I would suggest asking your daughter to review the account history and contact us if there is an error. RP: I want these fees reversed! DM: Unfortunately, Ms. Parent, I would be unable to reverse these fees unless I was able to verify that there's a bank error. RP: Reverse them!  Arrrggh!   I am screaming just for the heck of it!  Reverse them! DM: Ms. Parent, unless there is a bank error on this account, I am unable to reverse any fees. RP: Why not? DM: If there is a bank error, I would be happy to reverse the fees. At this time, I do not have any indication there is an error on our part. Please speak to your daughter and call us back or ask her to call us. RP: Hold on a second (Slams phone down). Ungrateful! Ungrateful, you get down here right now! Here, talk to this stupid bitch from the bank. DM:  Yes, calling me a stupid bitch just makes me want to help you even more.  Ungrateful Child (UC): Hello? DM: Hi, my name is Dana and I am a supervisor at NABABNA. I would like to go through your account to see if there is an error. UC: Yeah, you better. I know I didn't make a mistake. DM:  Yeah, right . Certainly, let me identify you (I identify UC). Now, Ms. Child, I see there was a purchase here to Trendy Clothes Shop for $75 and another purchase at College Hangout. Did you make these purchases? UC: Yeah. So? DM: Were you aware that your account had a balance of $5.00 at that time? UC: Yeah. So? DM: Well, when your account doesn't have the funds to support a purchase you made, this causes your account to become overdrawn. When this happens, two things can happen. Either the item is paid and you are assessed an overdraft fee or the item is returned, resulting in an Insufficient Funds Charge or IFC. Now this particular purchase was paid and an overdraft fee was assessed. UC: Well, reverse it. DM: I'm sorry but I'm unable to do that. This was not the result of bank error. UC: Fine, bitch. Talk to my Mom. RP: I told you to reverse those fees. DM (by now I have lost my patience. I have been called the c-word, I have been called a bitch, I have had this little punk sneer at me, I have had this woman scream at me. I have had it. It's time to get rough...or at least, as rough as I can get at work): Ms. Parent, I am going to speak frankly. I have explained that I can only reverse the fee if it is a bank error. Your daughter has just informed me that she was aware she only had $5 in her account when she made this $75 purchase. The overdraft fees were charged correctly. Courtesy reversals have been made on this account before and, in one situation, a remark was left stating that the customer was aware of the fact that no more fees would be reversed unless they are caused by bank error. There is nothing in our conversation that indicates to me that this will not happen again. RP: I think you're being rude. You can't lecture me! You can't tell my daughter how to spend her money! DM: Actually, at this point, she was not spending her money. She was spending NABABNA's money. And since we allowed her to make this purchase, we charged her an overdraft fee. There is not a bank error. RP: I want to talk to your supervisor! DM: Certainly. I'd be happy to transfer you to his voicemail, if you would be willing to hold. However, I must caution you that he will review your account the same way I have. Will you hold please?   Okay, so what did Ungrateful Child learn from this experience? If you said "How not to take responsibility" you would be exactly right. If you said "How to be a complete pain in the ass that will never amount to anything and be a blight on our society and will probably get busted for drug use and then her mom will be wondering what she did wrong and oh, my God, could I tell her!" you would not only be exactly right but learning to think like me...and that's just scary.  If you want to teach your kid to manage money responsibly, let them pay their overdraft fees. They'll figure it out.

      There's something about a full moon. All of the crazies come out and the calls at work get weirder and weirder. I just need to discuss a couple that I received today.  The first woman I spoke to had to be taught Banking 101. She just didn't get it. Surprisingly enough, her account wasn't in that bad of shape, but her comments were, let's just say, moronic. She was upset that she didn't get charged extra fees because the product she has for overdraft protection actually worked. Here's our conversation:  B: Thank you for holding Ms. Worry-wort (WW). My name is Beth and I'm a supervisor here at NABABNA. I understand you wanted to talk to a supervisor about your overdraft protection.  WW: This is all your fault! I shouldn't be overdrawn. What did that banker mean this isn't a bank error?!!!  B: I'm sorry Ms. Worry-wort. I would be happy to go through the situation with you and see what happened. I see the account went negative, what happened that made the account overdrawn?  WW: I wrote that check and it wasn't supposed to clear yet.  B: Okay. If you didn't want it to clear, why did you write it?  WW: I didn't think it would clear yet. That merchant shouldn't have cleared it yet.  B: Did you have an agreement with the merchant to hold your check?  WW: No.  B: Then the merchant had a right to collect.  WW: This isn't my fault. I wrote that it shouldn't clear until next week.  B: Okay, we're talking about post-dating checks then.  WW: Yes.  B: Unfortunately, post-dating checks is not something that will stop a check from clearing. Some states even have laws against post-dating checks. Once a check is written and given to the payee, the payee can clear the check. If you don't want the promise to pay to clear your account, you have two options. Don't write the check yet or place a stop payment on the item.  WW: But the teller wouldn't let me cash an item from three years ago.  B: So now we're talking about stale-dated checks?  WW: There's a difference?  B: Yes. One has a future date on it, one has a past date on it.  WW: What is a check?  B: Um, you've written checks before.  WW: But what is a check?  B: A check is a legal promise to pay someone. You have authorized the payee to have the funds written on the item.  WW: Oh. Why would I write a check?  B: To pay someone.  I really wanted to say, "They're pretty. It's just fun to decorate. Wasting paper is great!" This woman seriously has ten checks clear a day. You think she'd understand the whole concept of owing money somewhere and that this little piece of paper is how they are receiving the money.    WW: Okay. But this isn't my fault.  B: Did you give the person this money?  WW: Yes.  B: Then they could take it.  WW: Oh. Thanks!  B: Thanks for calling.  I sat stunned for a moment, trying to understand this woman's concerns. I still don't get her.  Here's the other weird call I got tonight:  B: Thank you for holding Mr. Freaking-Out-in-Public. My name is Beth and I'm a supervisor here at NABABNA. I understand you're having problems with your debit card.  FOP: I am out to dinner with my family and I need to pay for my $80 meal and my card doesn't work.  B: I'd be happy to look into the situation with you Mr. FOP. I am showing that your card was closed as stolen over two weeks ago.  FOP: That's right. I had my wallet stolen and I got the new card, but I threw it away since my wallet was returned.  B: Okay. But we closed this card two weeks ago.  FOP: But I have it back!  B: Um, once a card is closed, it remains closed. This is for security reasons.  FOP: Make it work! I can't pay for dinner. What am I supposed to do?  B: Have you considered writing a check?  FOP: I don't like checks. I didn't bring my check book.  B: Let me see if I understand this. You brought your family out for dinner with the only form of payment being a card that you reported stolen to the bank and you knew that it had been reported stolen?  FOP: Yes.  B: Unfortunately, I can't make that card work again. It's closed. I can reissue another card since it seems you threw out the new one we sent you. Unless you have a different form of payment, you might want to talk to the restaurant personnel about how to pay.  FOP:  Okay.  Thanks!  B:  Thanks for calling.  Why do people not think?  That's the problem with this world.  People don't realize that there is a little bit of planning and thought that goes into a day/week/year to make sure that it goes smoothly.  I just don't get people sometimes.
