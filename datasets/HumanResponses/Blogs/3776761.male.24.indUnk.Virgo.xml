      About all I can say is that things are going in the right direction.  I still hope for a few days events to unfold, or not.  It can get rough for me again.  Never the less I'd take it in stride.  I'm starting to feel more normal for the most part.  I'm taking to the gym to get rid of some of this anger and its working.  I'd like to just take some time and get out of here.  That will come in enough time.  I'm starting to worry about money.  It's getting rough but then again that's life.  Maybe if things keep looking good it won't be a problem at all.  Only time will tell.

      So the thoughts haven't stopped.  I don't think I honestly thought they would so fast.  It will take TIME.  Time heals all wounds.  The more I talk to her the more I see that it really wasn't her that did these things.  I wish I could understand.  S is back to normal, she needed her family.  All we can do is move forward and both give 110%.  That's all I can ask for.  I still see her changing and turning back into the W I knew.  So odd.  She made me breakfast this morning.  It's the little things that will ease the pain.  Though it's day 3 it's as if there was just a gap in time that I can't understand.  A gap that was not us.  I will never be able to make sense of it so I really need to try to stop.  No matter it will haunt me forever.  Like a movie that will play over and over in my head.

      No matter what I can't stop thinking about what's happened.  The worry won't leave my head.  I'm way too on edge.  I've even a little scared to go home.  Trying to fill the nights is not easy since there's only so much we can do.  I need something to hold on to.

      Today I start to detail my ‘new life’.  W is here and I can feel, both good and bad.  Though the pain is bad I can see past it to a better day.  I have a lot of changes that I want to make in my life for the better of all 3 of us.  I know I can do it because I want to.  Today we saw ‘Notebook’.  That was the saddest movie that I have ever seen.  I would read to W everyday just to get those few seconds of time with her and it would be worth it.  I told her so.  I know she knows I mean it but does not want to hear it.  My heart goes out to her the more and more I see her suffer.  I’m glad its starting to clam itself down.  She seems to feel more without her medication.  I don’t think I want her to take it anymore but we will see since she does suffer from not having it in her system.  I enjoyed the beach today.  I just love to see S play.  Her mind so hard at work so hard thinking and looking and enjoying.  It’s such a joy.  Hearing her sing is the best.  One this is for sure.  I love my family.  I know we will be successful if we try.  It just going to be a journey to get there.  I am willing to take that journey, no matter how long it might be.  I still can't get some of the things out of my head.  It's just too hard.  Maybe in time.

      Each day that passes it gets a bit easier.  I want it to be over and I want to move in.  I miss being with someone.  That part is hard.  What can I do right now?  Nothing I guess.  Just wait and see.  It'll pass in time I hope.  Right now I just look around and wonder.  Life moves on.  That I can not stop.

      And then in the evening light when the bars of freedom fall I watch the two of you in the shadows on the wall And when the darkness steals some of the choices from my hand Then will I begin to understand...

      I do miss her but that in time will pass.  There's too much that can go wrong to just keep going.  I have to do for me and my baby.  If she wants to be a part of it then it might work....

      Yesterday she left again.  This time I think it's for good.  Not much can happen in two weeks.  She's done too much damage to even want to repair what has gone on.  I really have to make myself busy and no think about it too much.  I must not call her.  Easier aid then done.

      Even though things seem ok I think something is up.&nbsp; Nothing adds up.&nbsp; She's in too good of a mood.&nbsp; Too hard to let this one go.&nbsp; Only time will tell.&nbsp; I'll see how she reacts tonight.&nbsp; Just a gut feeling.

      It's still so sad that she's not happy to see me when she gets home.  She started work today and seems to enjoy it.  Maybe this will assist in balancing her out.  Who knows?

      It's very strange seeing her around for more then a few hours.  I'm still trying to get used to it and not be on edge.  I was waiting for something to snap today.  The day is not yet over.

      Still going through boxes from the May move.  I see a life in the boxes of a family much more simple.  Where are those people?  Looking through the pictures was the hardest thing to do.  It's like looking at a totally different W.  Where did she go?  I took 2 pictures and I'll keep those with me.  Reminders of a simple life.

      I do feel for her. She is so confused and alone.  Only she can help her.

      Still here in a land unknown.  I'm still not sure where any of these roads lead.  I can just stand and watch as things move all around me.  It's a total roll reversal, I should be the one out there.  Maybe I care too much......

      what your soul sings  don't be afraid open your mouth and say say what your soul sings to u your mind can never change unless you ask it to lovingly re-arrange the thoughts that make u blue the things that bring u down can only do harm to u so make your choice joy the joy belongs to u and when u do you'll find the one u love is u you'll find u love u  don't be ashamed to open your heart and pray say what your soul sings to u so no longer pretend that you can't feel it near that tickle in your head that tingle in your ear oh ask it anything because it loves u dear it's your most precious king if only u can hear and when u do you'll find the one u need is u you'll find u love u

      Almost a week but she's gone again.  Almost 5 hours.  I sit here again waiting.  I try to hope for the best but these bad toughts keep coming in my head.  I want this feeling to go away.  She can do it. Just make it go away.
