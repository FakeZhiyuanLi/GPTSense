      OMG...sonny still hasn't come home yet. i mean, he got stranded in leyte coz of the typhoon. i felt so bad about it but the weather was just really bad so i just understood. told him i'd wait till he gets home. i just miss him so much. me say a lil pray'r for him. i can't sleep well.. i'd toss and turn in my bed... i even started to count sheep. it would've been fine if i could call him but voice prompt on his cellphone just keeps saying,   the number you dialled maybe unattended or out of the coverage area, Please try again later.   If she was a real person, i'd scream at her. *sigh* i just can't help but get worried,you know. all different kinds of thoughts would form in my mind..even negative ones.. if i don't get to hear from him. i even prayed and prayed till i fell asleep for 3 hours then i'm up again, waking up to the same nightmare i'm having now. i'm just so scared of what could have happen to him..why i can't reach him.. i'll just wait till tomorrow and see if he's really coming back. i just hope he's okay. i even texted his bestfriend, who's also stranded in leyte but about an hour away from sonny. i told him how worried and how close to freaking out i was. after that i broke down and cried coz i just miss him. so emotional tonight. i'm sorry. i shouldn't let this situation get the better of me. but oh i just wish he's home already..   twas a stressful day today at work. had 2 patients but each took such a long time to get over and done with. it was so busy. but i was glad i was preoccupied by the busy-ness so i didn't have to think about sonny. anyways, enough about my worries, i know what to do next. i'd probably sleep after posting this. i don't know. i might.

      i'm actually beginning to love Sugarfree. u know.. that band.. Mariposa. i'd probably name my first daughter after that song. nyahah .no way. too.. promdi. hehe   as i was rummaging through some old notes in one of the forgotten folders i used way back college, i found this piece of essay, i guess written by some person named anonymous. (pun intended) anyway, i'd just like to share this one.  it's entitled HAPPINESS.   "We convince ourselves that life will be better after we get married, have a baby, then another,. then we are frustrated that the kids aren't old enough and we'll be more content when they are.  After that, we're frustrated that we have teenagers to deal with. We will certainly be happy when they are out of that stage. We tell ourselves that our life will be complete when our spouse gets his or her act together, when we get a nicer car, are able to go on a nice vacation, when we retire.  In truth there is no better time to be happy than now. If not now, when?  Your life will always be filled with challenges. It is best to admit this to yourself, and decide to be happy anyway.  One of my favorite quotes come from Alfred Souza. He said,'for a long time, it had seemed to me that life was about to begin...However, there was always something to be gotten through first, some unfinished business, or time still to be served, or a debt still to be paid. Then life would begin. Then, it dawned on me that these obstacles were my life.'  This perspective has helped me to see that there is no one way to happiness. Happiness is the way. so treasure every moment that you have and treasure it more because you shared it with someone special. Remember that time waits for no one.  so stop waiting until you finish school, until you lose ten pounds, until you gain ten pounds, until you have kids, until your kids leave the house, until you start work, until you retire, until you get married until you get divorced, until Friday night, until sunday morning, until you get a new car or home, until your new car or home is paid for,until spring, until summer, until fall, until winter, until the first or fifteenth, until your song comes on, until you have a drink, until you've sobered up, until you die, until you are born again.. to decide that there is no better time than right now to be happy...  Life is a journey...not a destination." -anonymous.   and right now, "rainbow" by southborder softly plays...

      hhmm. it's 2 am already and i still don't know what time i'll hit the sack. just took the toefl exam last friday. i really don't know if i should be nervous or what but i think i came unprepared. my friends just took the exam so lightly but as I was walking out the exam room, i took a glimpse at the next person'sessay and i suddenly panicked! his essay was so long... OMG. mine was short, concise.. straight to the point. but people were telling me to make my essay long enough to bore the official TWE readers so they'd give me a grade of 6. HELL! QUIVER! hehehe just as long i was able to express whatever i can say about the topic, the length of my essay was enough. it doesn't really matter.  anyway, my mom's constantly pressuring me to fix my papers and all that but i still really don't want to. because of the boy. i know we have the same course, same goals but not the same time frame. i really want to make a career move as soon as now, but whenever i'd look over my plans, there's always that voice inside that says, "what about sonny?" *sigh* i asked him many times about his plans. my mom even asked him! he just shrugs his shoulder, and says, "yeah, i have plans. but not now." hello??! honey... we're not getting any younger!! he's the type who needs somebody to forcibly make him go and do something worthwhile with his life. i mean, he's hardworking, very patient, a good person but! he's just so... dependent on me i guess. well not totally. i mean, sometimes he just frustrates me you know. i know he still wants to enjoy his single life.. sometimes even i'd think we're not going to last forever. we're not going to get married and have babies and just live peacefully for ever and ever amen. *sigh* now that's being so unrealistic of me.   so what im going to do next is to do something about my life. as much as i want him to work on his life too but i can't do that. it's his life. not mine to run.   anyhues... he's coming home already and i can't wait to see him. i still do love him so much. even how directionless his life is right now. i'm going to stay. not letting go. he txtd me yesterday.. told me, palapit na birthday nya.. that he's getting old na. hhmm.. do i sense an awakening there??? hehehe i just love him. that's all that matters.

      i just hate him.. how much i hate him. who?? that fcking brother of mine.. i just hate him so much. i could write a million reasons why. when i came out of my room, i told him that i wanted him to pray for me so that I can get through my financial problem. He just attacked, nagged and blamed me why on earth I didn't finish my contract at this previous company that I used to work for. because i wasn't able to finish the 6 months probationary period, due to health reasons, i resigned from work and the company asked me to pay the twenty thousand bond. i knew that the moment i decided to resign. i'm not stupid! the heck! the job's too stressful. that's why i wanted to quit. anyway, back to that leche brother of mine, everytime he would nag and nag me about what i do with my life, i'd just lash out at him. and then he'd tell me that i didn't have any respect for him! the hell he would talk about RESPECT! he's the one who doesn't know how to respect! asshole! idiot! he's got this bloated head and an ego the size of jupiter!   he's the 2nd of child of the family. the "special" child. he was only able to speak when he was four, he joined me in nursery when he was 6, he flunked first grade. he had a tutor all his life. he's what they call academically slow... while i was reaping off awards here and there in grade school, he had a bloody red report card. so i was the family favorite back then. but when we were older the tables have turned. now i was the black sheep of the family because of him. every mistake and every sin that i've done, he would suck up to my parents. that just pisses me off you know. every act that i made, he's so vigilant in looking for a single mistake that i do so u can tell on me to my parents. and my god, he's already 25! that's not the way to act brother. such an immature person. i don't know just how to describe his underdeveloped personality. and i just hate it too whenever my parents would always take his side! i don't know how long this hatred would last. and to think for the rest of his life, he'll be dependent on me! oh that's ok, the time will come when he would be crawling on his belly asking for forgiveness! bwahahaha.. if only he wasn't my brother, i'd abandon him for good.   cge lang... makabaws ra nya ko bah.. imo pa run francis.. imo pa run...   i'll just bide my time... i'll have my revenge soon.  i'll never forget this day. i never will. i will only forgive him on my death bed. i know my parents are not going to be here forever. the it's only going to be my eldest brother and me that he's going to turn to. if ever i don't get married, i will save up, buy my own house, i will slap my money on his face because that is the only thing that matters to him. he doesn't respect me because i don't have any money. so that's the way it's going to be. padaghanay lang diay'g kwarta? hala cge.. i'll prove it to you gyud ba..

      *sigh... it's been 6 months and counting... i have been very happy with sonny... i can't ask for anything more from him... sometimes though, i get irritated by the way he acts but that's part of him... and i love that part even if it annoys me sometimes... he can be funny. sometimes even his corniest joke seems hilarious to me. hehehe oh man..even if i already know what i would do if we would break up but one thing i wouldn't know is how i would react to the loss... it's unimaginable... i really really can't think whether the loss of this relationship would be a disaster or beneficial to me. i can't really say for now... and i really do not want to know. i just shove the thought away for sure.   we have our little quarrels here and there.. but the good thing is that we immediately patch things up.. we forgive and forgive. we understand because we both want to be understood... we practice patience and loving.. even if we're both imperfect people, but we both try to work things out. now i know what i'm so afraid of. i'm afraid of losing the fire. that all we both are working so hard for would end up as nothing in the end because we wouldn't end up together.. but what i always tell him.. vice versa.. definitely we would think of what would happen in the future.. we anticipate things to come.. but it's the NOW that we should face.. it's the present that we should live.. we should live for today not for tomorrow nor yesterday.. that's why we both are thankful that we have each other because we'd never know when we would lose each other.. when we'd be separated.. it's frustrating to think of those things as of now.. just like that song,  u got to live every moment, as though it was your last, before the tehif of always, steals tomorrow from your grasp.. before the chance to know His love.. would somehow pass u by.. let your heart reach out.. right here right now.. for the Lord to touch your life...  it's one of my favorite songs and it always makes me look back at my life and reflect on the things that i should be grateful for.. it's a waste of time when we worry, when we're anxious, when we're afraid of what lies ahead... so why waste precious time on energy-draining thoughts when we can dwell on the brighter, lighter and more positive ones? we got to live every moment.. never waste time.. love as much as you can..
