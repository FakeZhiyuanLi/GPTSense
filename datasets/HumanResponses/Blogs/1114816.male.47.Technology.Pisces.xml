      Having spent most of the past 2 months at work dealing with some managers who valued gamesmanship over working as a team I am happy to report a meeting with the grand sultans resulted in the correct decisions being made. It was odd. In the weeks leading up to this meeting certain of the managers repeatedly asserted strong positions. Yet once we got into the meeting the did a 180 degree turn and abandoned their previous (irresponsible yet non-negotiable) opinions. As a manager I've never really grasped why so many other managers would rather indulge in gamesmanship than simply doing their job.     The good news is that's over. Plus I've taken names and plan to put some whoop ass on some of these folks if they are so unwise as to pursue stupid agendas again. Their failure, also oddly, will enable me to work with some of the other good managers to push through changes and will likely result in us doing much better in the future. Hmm. Maybe having a few pointy haired bosses around is a good thing! (ha!!!)

      Well, today's my first Father's day. I'm feeling a little emotional about it which surprised me. Bringing a child into this world is quite a responsibility especially with all the fears and challenges we face. Having the responsibility to raise a child who can navigate her way through the moral choices in order to find happiness seems like more load than anyone can confidently bear. I sometimes feel even a few simple choices as a father could cause major problems in my child's life.    I also feel the burden of needing to prepare materially for my daughter's future. Everything from having the money to enable her to go to college, should that make sense 18 years from now, to the relatively short term need to select a school path for her. Our elementary school is not rated very well and I keep wondering whether or not to consider starting my daughter in private school. I think the early years of schooling are the most critical. The local middle and high schools are rated very well but I fear she might fall behind and learn poor social skills long before she reaches middle school. I also wonder whether it is really feasible to leave the private school system once we start her down that path (if we decide to). Good private schools are quite expensive when you consider they require 12 years (or more counting pre-school).

      We have a 2 month old daughter at home. For the past 4 nights she has slept through the night without waking us up - 8 hours plus! If you have never had kids this won't mean a whole lot to you but take my word for it that this is unusual in a child so young. Several of my friends and co-workers have babies slightly older than mine and none of theirs have accomplished this feat. We are lucky indeed!

      In a couple of weeks my in-laws (mother-in-law and wife's stepfather) will come for a visit. They aren't really coming to visit our new daughter but are instead mostly coming as a way to try to save up some money by not having to pay rent. They're nomads partly by nature and partly because they tend to do some not very bright things and find the need to "move on" to a new locale regularly. I guess that makes them sound criminal but that's not what I really mean to say. Mostly they tend to do stupid, very short sighted, things and end up broke all the time.    I have no idea what to expect. First because I've never had anyone stay with me for an extended period of time. They purchased a one way ticket and are expected to stay with us several months. Secondly I know they tend to end up in disagreements when they stay with other relatives. I fear all kinds of minor disagreements about who pays for what. We're trying to save money (new baby and a new house) and don't need a lot of extra expenses.    I don't much care what the outcome of the relationship with the in-laws is. I only met them once and then for just a few hours. But I've seen this sort of thing damage relationships between a husband and wife and that would well and truly piss me off. Let me know if anyone has sage advice on how to deal with this...

      I'm a huge fan of TiVo. I use mine with a standard cable feed. Virtually all TV watching I do is from TiVo recordings. I rarely watch "live" TV. TiVo established itself as the early DVR leader and in terms of function and usability has been the clear leader. But now there are many competitors. Strangely these tend to advertise themselves as "TiVo-like". Yet they fail to deliver on most TiVO features and are simply recorders. Much more like digital VCRs than TiVo which has the ability to apply intelligence in selecting and tracking shows of interest.   These new competitors are starting to seriously hurt TiVo's future. DirecTV, the largest pool of TiVo users, has started to sever the relationship. First their TiVo board member resigned and now they've  urlLink sold their stake in TiVo.  TiVo is not going to disappear tomorrow but is definitely sliding downward without any obvious path to succcess.    This is another good example of why distribution often trumps product features and quality. Cable companies, satellite companies and others can deliver "TiVo" like functionality without paying significant fees to TiVo. The actual functionality is greatly reduced but most customers will chose the easy (comes with your cable/satellite service) alternative even if they derive less use and enjoyment.

      I work on security oriented products and keep an eye on some of the new vulnerabilities and how the main companies deal with them. Apple recently implemented something logical:  urlLink a dialog  that warns users the first time a "new" application is opened indirectly (i.e. by opening a document that cause the application to open).   At face value this seems like a good move for users sophisticated enough to interpret the result. But with only slight reflection I have to wonder about a number of potential flaws. For example suppose the trojan horse app has the same name as a legitimate application. In Apple's example the app is named Exploit which is an easy red flag. But what if it was named "Mail" (the name of Apple's email client), "Word", "iTunes" or some other well known app. Users might assume the warning was either a glitch or caused by an update to the application. I also have to wonder how hard/easy it would be to fool this check. No technical information is provided on how this check is implemented.

      Apple just did it again with their  urlLink Airport Express  announcement. This product has two cool features. First it is a tiny 802.11g base providing wireless networking anywhere you go. Second it works with iTunes (Mac and PC) to stream your audio collection over a wireless connection. The Airport Express has audio out connections so you can plug the tiny adapter into an AC outlet, run an audio cable to your stereo, and you're set to go. It's ground breaking in terms of form and function and at $129  very  reasonably priced.

      This  urlLink new product  from OQO looks nearly perfect for mobile users who need full Windows functionality in a small form factor device. From their web site:   The OQO Model 01 ultra personal computer (uPC) is a fully-functional Windows XP computer. The OQO has a 1GHz processor, a 20GB hard drive, 256MB of RAM, a color transflective display, and integrated wireless, as well as Fire Wire and USB ports. It is powerful enough to run your most complex applications.   The only thing I see missing is a PCMCIA slot...   Now for the rest of the story...it won't be available for 6 months or more. Talk about market overhang.

      The in-laws still haven't decided when they will leave. I couldn't sleep most of last night from being upset about their disrespect and selfishness. I guess some guys would go off at their in-laws but I don't intend to ever do that. To me it is really low to treat elders like that even when they are definitely asking for a tongue lashing. But keeping it bottled up is very unhealthy for me. Today is my Mom's birthday. The best present I could have given her was a date by which the in-laws would be gone so she could come see her first granddaughter. I hate the in-laws for denying my mother that present.   We usually do something with the in-laws on the weekends. Go shopping, bowling, play cards/dominoes. I've decided in protest until their departure I will opt out of any activity involving them. It certainly seems childish but at the same time seems like the most mild reaction I can imagine.

      I wonder how many parents abandon their kids by leaving them with a spouse who has major issues? I think my wife's mom and step-dad are peas in a pod in this regard as they both left their spouses and left their children with a spouse with serious problems. I think doing something like that is the most selfish act I can think of.

      To follow up last night's NEWSFLASH. It was really rather pathetic watching step-dad say goodbye to his daughter and never-before-met son. He was all sobby. But I couldn't feel any sympathy for a man who willing chose to never see, and more importantly never support, his own children. It's true their mother had issues but that's no reason to abandon your kids.    The part that was particularly pathetic is that he - a man with something like 8 kids -  had no idea how to treat them or interact with them. I'm old enough to be their father and even though I just now had my first child I had more of a clue then he. A man with 8 kids. At one point he came up behind his daughter, who was watching TV in the den with my wife and I, and wrapped her in a hug while she sat in the chair. He was smiling big and obviously expected some great emotional response from her. She didn't even really react which I  think shocked him. What did he expect? Of all his kids she is the only one that stays in contact with him. No wonder. It must be really sad to have a father who isn't there for you when you need him but who wants to still get a loving-child reaction when it suits him. I wouldn't have the patience for it and would tell him to go to ... if it were me.

      The kiddies arrived and I am pleased to say they are, to all outward appearances, quite normal and polite. The young son cleans up after himself wherever he goes without being asked and the young daughter is quite polite. She only made it through her first year of college but it shows in her conversation and general demeanor. They will stay until early Friday morning last I heard. I don't expect that to cause any trouble.   NEWSFLASH: the daughter just walked in and said they're leaving. Turns out her husband got all jealous or something and so she has to leave. She said he had some issues but she guessed that was just part of being married. I think that's always a bad sign for the future of a marriage. She told him she was with family but since he has surely never met any of us (and if she talked about her step dad much that probably didn't impress her husband) that may not have reassured him much.   I feel sorry for her but there's nothing I can do. At least her little brother (he's a teenager) can ride along. It is truly a dark and stormy night and I can't think much of soldier boy for making her drive through the night. I imagine it is a 8 hour drive or more.

      The kiddies are now supposed to arrive this afternoon. Who knows what thrills await when I get home... Actually, they might even be normal so I can't rule out a reasonable evening as a possibility.   But it's a relatively slow day at work - several meetings were canceled which means I actually have some free time to think of work and other things. At the moment I've been daydreaming of places I've been and love to visit again. Scotland for example. Or nearer to home (a little) Vancouver. I like to travel and having a young baby puts a crimp in that for awhile. For probably only the second time in my adult life I will have gone more than 1 year without what I consider a "real vacation". To be a real vacation it has to involve travel and staying at a hotel. Trips to see relatives,  though nice, aren't real vacations. It will probably be at least one year from now before we can swing a real vacation. Don't cry for me Argentina!

      Well, the step-dad's kiddies didn't arrive yesterday. When I got home they were expected to arrive around midnight and preparations were made. But by 10pm no one had heard from them and I was told this meant they wouldn't arrive until today. Typical of this crew... I have no idea if they will actually arrive today and if so what time. How long they will actually stay. And so on. I was also told yesterday the in-laws will sleep on the floor in the nursery and the kiddies (they're actually adults) will sleep in the bed in the extra bedroom. This isn't a situation I like but it is the least of evils. What I don't like is two smokers sleeping in the same room as my baby (though they don't smoke in the house). What would be worse is two people of unknown character sleeping in the nursery and trying to quiet our baby if she wakes them up.    One thing that is clear is the need to continue to express my displeasure over the present situation. I have the definite impression the more unhappy I appear to be the more seriously they think of leaving.

      Rumor has it the in-laws may leave soon. It's pretty obvious to the step-mom their presence is causing a lot of difficulties plus I have continued to make it known they should make way for my mother and sister to visit since my sister has to either come soon or not come at all. I call this a rumor because they twice asked me to find the best deal on a flight for them and once I did they decided not to book the reservation and wait. Step-dad's son-he-never-met and daughter (I mistakenly thought it was son-he-never-met and his wife) will arrive today, supposedly. One rumor is they may hitch a ride with them to wherever they plan to go next. I don't care which they do as long as they decide soon enough that my sister can make a reservation and come visit. Since they've put me in whine mode I also will add I hope his kids are quiet and tired when they get here. Our baby was up almost all night and I know I'm going to be very tired when bed time rolls around.

      Got more good (i.e. bad) in-law news yesterday when I got home from the office. My wife's stepdad invited a son (whom he has  never  even met and his wife to come visit). He essentially invited them to stay at our house without asking about it. Note that we don't have an extra bed to accomodate the additional visitors. Supposedly it is only for a couple of days so I agreed.    The stepdad is a horrible example of a man short of being criminally evil or insane. He has had many children by a number of women and essentially abandonded all of them. Given this it is hard to feel like a visit from a child he's never met is anything to be excited or happy about. It certainly isn't borne out of a change in his personality or behavior. He remains irresponsible. Probably the only good thing to happen recently was he took a temporary job. This allowed the IRS to find him and take virtually all of his paychecks and he got hit for non-payment of child support. Nice guy, huh? He is very close to the old ghetto joke about a man with two children born on exactly the same day, month and year. But they're not twins. But this guy didn't grow up ghetto and has no one to blame but his own sorry character.

      I've long been a big fan of "dance" music (in this case meaning techno, electronica, etc.). Now that I'm a parent I'm an even bigger fan. Why, you might ask? Because the lyrics are invariably safe for youngsters and the themes are not too raunchy. Plus I just love a good beat and a sweet voice :-)   Fortunately there's a great radio station locally with few commercials. Plays everything from some classic dance mixes to dance re-mixes of the latest hits. Station  urlLink Party 93.1  and they post their song list online.

      The government's  urlLink  9/11 report  is now officially out. I am pleased it has taken a fairly non-politized approach to it's job. It would have been easy to blame everything on a single president or set of administrative heads. This would clearly have been unfair. Our (America's) lack of preparedness was fairly deeply rooted and historical in nature. It's frankly difficult for anyone to imagine the cruelty and barbarism such acts entail. It's true our intelligence agencies failed to anticipate and grasp the risk and they should have done better. But it is also true it is impossible to anticipate the course of future events and even such great tragedies often  turn on a small event.   It is also absolutely true that even if rapid changes are made we, and all free people, remain vulnerable to terrorism. Global society's greatest challenge is to establish a broader approach to establishing human life as valuable across all cultures and religions.

      We took our daughter to the doctor for her 4 month checkup yesterday. She is in the 80th percentile for length and 90th for weight. Since she was a small baby (6#) that's a remarkable achievement. In fact she's a bit of an over achiever. So the doctor prescribed exercise (swimming and a walker) and forbade naps after 4:30pm. We're also to start feeding her solids (she had been on formula for the past month). Our daughter has definitely become more alert and begun to more seriously interact with people and objects. Watching a child grow is a truly awesome experience.   Of course the above scenario is played out for very new parent. But that doesn't mean we're any less excited and happy. Now if the in-laws would just go away!

      Last season I really enjoyed this reality series but this year's version is leaving me pretty lukewarm. I think it is due to two choices made by the producers. First they included some already professional and fairly well known comics in the competition (and in the final group). Second, and this is partly related, they have manipulated the results several times to "make the show more interesting."   I know other reality shows have manipulated things to add more drama but fudging the voting seems a bit extreme. If you watch and recall when Drew Carey and the other celebrity judges voted on who should live in the castle the judges became furious because the "winners" for the most part were not the people they voted for. It turns out the producers used a clause to enable their votes to overrule the judges "in the interest of good TV." Drew etc. were livid.    On the last show the producers decided to bring back the comics who were voted off (probably because most of the outrageous characters were voted off first) and are even going to let them vote on who goes next. Originally the show seemed to present comics going head-to-head in a fairly good competition to see who was funniest. This season the show is playing out like total fiction. Maybe the producers are doing this because the winner last season (Dat Phan) turned out not to be so funny after all (though I do think he performed best in last year's compeitions).

      I think I had a wonderful father. I love him of course and one of my largest life regrets is he died when I was young - right at the cusp of adulthood. He did his best by me but never got to live long enough to see any of the results (my college graduation, success at work, general life happiness and stability, etc.). Just writing this short comment on it brings tears to my eyes. Part of my early education on "life isn't fair."       But that's a subject for another day. One of the many things my father did was teach me how to do everything. Not that he literally taught me to do everything but he instilled in me the firm belief that I could do anything. It would only take a little time to learn to do something new the first time. It's amazing how understanding this makes a difference in someone's life. I have always worked with well educated and very bright people who generally share this same understanding. But in other aspects of life I encounter people who clearly missed this message and I feel sorry for them. And it seems extremely difficult for an adult to learn to be truly aggressive in how they think about what they can or can't do.      It some times gives me a bad attitude though. Maybe this is "sexist" but to me a man is supposed to "know how to do things." I'm shocked and think bad thoughts when I meet a man who cannot live up to this. I don't like doing business with such men, I don't trust them and I don't want to be friends with them. And on the filp side I am always impressed when I meet a woman who understood this early enough in her life to break out of the mold of "things women know how to do." I've recently had to tackle various "things men do" tasks such as repairing toliets, working on the kitchen plumbing, fixing an automatic garage door, and fixing a light fixture. I've encountered some men, like my father-in-law in fact, who can't do these things. Actually it's worse than that - he would try to tackle this type of job and totally screw things up. Much better to know your own limitations. My father-in-law tried to take the old light bulb out of the porch light and the glass bulb separated from the base. Not unusual really. But to him it was a major event and one that required pliers and considerable time to repair. He probably would have electrocuted himself. Fortunately it was the weekend and I was at home to intervene. When I looked I realized nothing at all was needed. The large internal glass finger was intact and I could easily unscrew the base by twisting that.      I guess I'll never qualify as a "pretty boy"! Although I met some women in my dating years that liked to go out with pretty boys very few wanted to stay with such a man and the couple of marriages I know about failed. Again call me sexist if this is but most women I know just can't muster much respect for a man who "doesn't know how to do things."

      The lit fuse went off though not until Sunday. As expected when I got home Friday I was treated like a king so I had to just let the fuse burn. But when Sunday rolled around things had gotten back to normal and I got furious (over something admittedly small). I kept my argument salient and managed to avoid just going off in general. I also was careful to avoid saying anything to her parents at all (I always try to be respectful of elders). Of course part of my wife's response was the standard line - it hurts that you don't like my mother/family. I pointed out I didn't dislike them it was the situation that was driving me crazy. But in the heat of arguments people tend not to listen to the real issue and instead lactch on to a thought that makes them feel better.       Sunday also brought another good reminder of why I'm not happy with the situation. My wife accused me again of not liking or wanting to help her family. But her family is hurting mine and not respecting them. August is the only time my sister can possible come visit us. She has been dying to see her first niece but tragedy after disaster combined with having to work 7 days/week has meant she couldn't consider coming sooner. She's also got big money problems because her husband, though employed and working long hours, hasn't been paid in months. But since my wife's parents still haven't even given us a date when they plan to leave my sister can't plan her visit. I told my sister to come anyway and we'd find them a hotel or something. But she's too polite (possibly quite literally) and refuses to come if it means my in-laws would have to find another place to stay. We just don't have enough beds/rooms for everyone especially since the in-laws are smokers.

      The situation with the in-laws in-my-house is getting worse. It's really taking a toll on my marriage relationship and general happiness. The MIL keeps saying unhelpful things (never when I'm around of course) and generally disrupting life. Mainly having them here seems to effect my wife's attitude and happiness (not for the better). It seems odd to me because she seems to want them here but to be unhappy with life in general now that they are here. Probably because her mother is always pushing her to do things my wife knows will cause problems in our relationship. They never smoke inside the house but tend to run back in right after smoking which stinks up the joint. I always made it clear I did not want my child around cigarette smoke. Both my parents smoked when I was a child and it took a toll on me (I had bad asthma and allergies as a child).  To me it is irresponsible parenting to allow a child to be around cigarette smoke on a daily basis.     It's gotten very serious and although I'm more the type to keep my mouth shut than cause a confrontation I can't stay silent any longer. Life's too short to be miserable plus I have a young daughter's future to consider. They always sense when they've pushed the issues too far and act sweet for a day or two so I imagine tonight they will act all happy. But I'm not going to let the situation slide.  Marriage is tough and raising a child adds to the difficulty. But the challenge has to be faced.

      In a typical foobar the guys I was supposed to have diner with on Monday got lost for 2 hours before finally calling and asking for directions. You'd think three very brainy guys would learn how to read a map or at least know when to ask for help. But nooo. It is frustrating because not only did it leave a number of us hanging around the office late for no reason but also the trip is essentially a straight line. I have yet to understand how they got so lost.    Needless to say the end result is we had to go out to dinner last night. By this time word had gotten out that there was a free meal to be had at a nice ocean-front restaurant and various groupies began to join up. I tend to want to call them losers because in my mind if going out to dinner and talking about work all night is the best activity you can find you're a loser. It's not like any of these guys are in line to make president of the company or have any career reason to attend dinners like this. Guess I'm whining...

      I'm sitting in my office waiting for some colleagues who just flew into the US for meetings to give me a call. They wanted to have dinner with me and some of my guys tonight. Problem is they flew into an airport that is at least an hour away. They called 2 hours ago to say they were on their way to the hotel and we still haven't heard from them. And we don't have a mobile number to call them on. Stuck waiting at work is not very enjoyable especially since working extra hours has been a routine thing of late.   I have to admit I've never been a big fan of having dinner with co-workers. I work so I can take care of myself and my family - not as a way to make friends. But some guys seems to really get off on business dinners. Maybe it makes them feel like big shots? Or maybe they have no friends and no life? Not sure. One thing I do know. If I dine at a favorite restaurant for a business dinner I don't enjoy my meal nearly as much as I do if I'm there with friends or family.

      There is a small private lake across the street from our house. The president of the HoA assured us no fishing license is needed since it's private and invited our visitors to fish. My wife's stepdad tried to dig up some worms in the backyard but couldn't find any that weren't tiny so he made a trip to Wal-mart for some nightcrawlers. I stayed home to watch the baby (she had just awoken and needed feeding) while my wife went with her folks to do some fishing. They returned about 1 hour later with 13 fish (mostly perch). None were very large but we managed to make a meal out of them. My mother-in-law was as happy as a little kid about catching fish. Apparently nearly every time they baited a hook a fish would take the bait and the cycle would start again. It's nice the lake is well stocked. In a few years it will be a big thrill to take my daughter for her first fishing expedition knowing she's almost certainly catch some fish (without having to pay to fish at a "fishing pond"). Seeing how happy the adults were at catching fish was a good reminder what a thrill it is for most kids.

      The visit by my wife's mother and stepdad could be going worse but it does have most of the ingredients people find annoying in their in-laws. Explaining the headline - we knew they were going to stay a couple of months, supposedly to help with the baby, and my wife assured me they would take care of their own expenses. But the reality has been we've been footing the bill for everything. So far the only things they've paid for is their cigarettes and they bought us a couple of Taco Bell tacos one Sunday after we took them bowling. And these folks have definitely been wearing the feedbag. The step dad gained 5 pounds in less than 2 weeks and my mother-in-law gained 4 pounds in the same time period. We've been in a major money saving mode for a year so having the extra expense of feeding them is definitely annoying. I can't help but add up the cost and think of better things to do with the money.     My mother-in-law tends to make a number of harmful comments as well. She has given my wife many reasons why we shouldn't try to have any more children. I personally think her reason for saying so is purely selfish - to ensure we don't have the distraction and expense of more than one child. She also doesn't agree with some key aspects of how we are nurturing our baby. For those that don't know, babies are very sensitive to routines and can quickly pick up bad habits. So even small disruptions can have long lasting effects. Eventually we will probably have a big fight because once our daughter gets older I won't want her spending so much time around my wife's parents. Don't think I'm particularly mean. My wife agrees with my concerns and objections. But like me she tends to go along with what her family says and does rather than starting a big argument.   Earlier this year the in-laws stayed at my sister-in-law's house. Same deal. And it ended in a big fight and them leaving suddenly due to all the stress and arguments that eventually bubbled to the surface.   I've never been one to say much to relatives or argue with them about anything. I tend to keep things bottled up inside. This helps maintain the peace on the homefront but really adds to my stress level. In other words it is not very healthy.

      Within days of the in-laws leaving my sister will arrive. This will be her first visit to our home and, much more importantly, her first time to see our daughter. Our daughter is her first niece that's a blood relation and she is very excited. It would have been nice to have a weekend between visitors to do a thorough cleaning and run errands. But my sister's job situation is such that she either comes right away or she won't be able to visit at all this year. So we don't mind. I just hope she's prepared to love a 14 pound crying and pooping machine :-) Actually, I know she is. She's thrilled!

      Sick of my in-laws and sick of writing about them... Time to talk about my Digital Life. First up is my Canon G2 digital still camera. This is a 4MP camera that has many different modes and offers the photographer a lot of creative control. In my young and single days photography was a major hobby of mine. I took photos on a semi-professional basis and had darkroom equipment for color and black-and-white photography. I naturally did realism but also experimented with photos and printing as an art form. Probably this is the area of my life I have shown the most creativity and looking back at some of my earliest work I am still fairly impressed :-). A number of my prints are at least the equal of ones sold in good photo galleries.    One of the results of this is I was never happy with the prints I got back from photo processors. I even tried higher end local and mail order processors yet still find the results only mediocre. Color was almost never reproduced properly and small blemishes were surprisingly common. And of course there is no real creative contorl over how the photo is actually printed in a traditional photo shop.   Eventually I got a decent computer printer that could handle photos and I had a high end scanner (for business purposes) I used to scan in some prints for adjustment. The results, though sometimes better than a photo shop, were still disappointing. It is very hard to scan in a mediocre print and turn it into something wonderful. Not impossible but very time consuming. It took me a long time to try a digital camera. Partly because I had heard very mixed opinions of them and also because I knew if I bought one I would print enlargements (i.e. 8x10 and larger). To print a high quality enlargement you need more pixels which means more money. For my money 4MP was the minimum and for a long time the prices were so high. Except for a few models that had crappy quality (do your research carefully if you care about photo quality - all digital cameras are not created equal). The G2 was well rated, a handy size, and had great features. Including a "raw" mode which allowed you to transfer the raw image data from the camera to the computer for manipulation. N.B. In case you don't know JPEG is a very poor quality compression if you plan to manipulate a photo and enlarge it (TIFF is better if you have to use compression).   Although I bought a 4MP because I intened to print enlargements I didn't actually have high expectations. I was prepared to be disappointed (because in spite of a lot of people praising scanning as being of good quality I saw none that actually were except those done on professional drum scanners). But from the very first photo I had to say WOW! Color reproduction is very, very good. Focus and detail outstanding. Features easy to use. Creative control better than a 35mm. And, the biggest surprise to me, digital photos are much easier to adjust and manipulate in Photoshop than scannned photos. I have no idea why this is so but it is true to a very large degree. It could take me up to an hour of experimenting to get a scanned photo to show the right colors, clean up the focus, touch up blemishes, etc. With a digital photo it takes only a minute or two to adjust color, brightness & contrast, focus, and etc. In fact in most cases adjustments aren't even needed. Man was I thrilled. It was oen of the best purchases I ever made (and at the time I didn't know a baby was in my future - an event which causes an exponential increase in photos taken.   This is getting long and it's not clear if anyone ever reads these :-) so I'll wrap up with my steps in printing a photo. I always use Raw mode on the Canon. It takes up more room (but I use 128MB cards so I don't care) but produces far superior results. First I import the photo(s) to a import folder on my laptop and then fire up Photoshop and use it's Browser to see all the newly imported photos. I open one up, do a save as into the destination folder using the Photoshop format, do a page setup to prepare it for the photo paper, try the Auto Color feature to see if that looks better (if not I undo), then do a Unsharpen to improve the apparent focus. Then I'm done and I queue up the photo for printing.    Probably everyone but a luddite or newbie has already made the conversion to digital. But in case you haven't I completely recommend it. Before I didn't taken that many photos because the commercial photo prints were usually so disappointing I felt it was a waste of time. But in the years I've had my digital camera the thrill of photography has returned.

      My wife mentioned in passing (her way of communicating news she knows I won't like) her parents actually consider themselves to be leaving for just a short while so my relatives can visit and plan to return right after that to find an apartment here. I let a few minutes pass before opining I thought this would be a very bad idea. First, they have no car and so living down here would mean my wife would have to be a constant taxi driver. Second, they tend to squander their income (neither works) and always ask for favors at the end of the month. Such as buying cigarattes for them and them not paying for them. But all of these pale in comparison to the bad influence they represent for my daughter and even my wife. This is a very difficult situation to discuss of course. All the above added together means a lot of likely damage to our marriage relationship should they move down here. This is something I don't think my wife comprehends but will require discussion. I'll be made out to be cold hearted and hear "why don't you like my parents" but it is a discussion that must take place. I made a commitment when we decided to have children and I won't tolerate a costly and negative influence hurting her future if it can be avoided.
