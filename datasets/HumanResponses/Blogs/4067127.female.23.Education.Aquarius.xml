      Well today was just another day. I went to work again, after hitting the snooze. Then deciding that hitting snooze took too much time shut the alarm off and thought fuch it I am not going today..  But 815 a good 15 minutes late I walk in. Once again half the peops aren't even at work and not a person cares that I was late. Really what is the point in going to work if your never missed?  I don't know but I didn't accomplish a whole lot today. I still have to pack for the "business" trip that I am going on to Connecticut. Isn't that spelled funny? Connect-icut? Crazy?  Well I am just procrastinating. I haven't even eaten dinner because I just don't care today. I think that I am distrubed. I just feel depressed or off whack or something today.  Yesterday I twisted my ankel it hurt for a second. But I had to laugh at myself and I bet if anyone was looking they would have too. I was getting outta the truck and bamm, there I go on my ass. I don't know if my mind was drifting or what but the shit sure hurts now..  I keep hearing put some ice on it.. Yah right like I have time for that. I spent like 3 hours up at work with my husband. I feel bad leaving all the time. It sure is getting to suck. I mean every trip it gets harder to leave. I just want to stay here and sleep with my Boo.  I really do have to pack so let me go and get the damn suitcase out and get it done...  Have a better day than me... "...untune the string, And, hark, what discord follows!" W.

      Well today I found out about this website. My husband posts on it and I was&nbsp;a bit curious. Then I saw some things that he wrote and was a little upset. But oh well.  I had a bad day. I didn't do well on a placement test that I took.. Sucx but what can a girl do? Work is fine just another day. I am going out of town for a little while, I leave on Saturday. No biggie though! Same ol' Same ol' I guess..   Nothing else really to say because I hate this keyboard and have to move to my own computer if I want to continue typing. I have to eat something. I am a wee bit hungary.   Smile and Remember Make LOVE not WAR..

      Well like the title.. I think that today might be possibly the worst day of my life.. Ok so not really. I have a thing for mildly over exaggerating.. And I can't spell half the time too..  I went to work. No big deal I think that I work with half "special" people.. Actually I know "special" people that are smarter more than half the time.. So I don't know what these are maybe a breed of a human and a donkey.. Yah a jackass.. Anyhow. I went to work and things were fine except this "diet" I am on is driving me nuts. All I want is carbs and I am saposto try and cut them out of my diet.. I wanted a donut so bad.. They were calling me... Come here, they said.. So finally I gave in for lunch and ate a donut.. My one splurge.. Although I did splurge and have a hamburger for dinner and I am regretting it now.. I really don't feel so swell. I feel a bit rough.. Like I can loose it if I lay down. Thus I am writing this..  I am all screwed up on time too.. Going from Central to East Coast to Central to it is never ending.. I just think that life is too difficult some times.  I was thinking about my father today. I am always doing the leg work.. I always call, email, call, email, call, call, go visit, send letters & pictures, email, and call some more... But you know that I sent pictures and got a phone call back because he couldn't figure out how to open them on the CD I sent.. I am in the technology age.. Digital is the only way to go anymore..  Anyhow we talked all was good. I was starting to feel like a real adult that can have a serious conversation with her father.. I mean it has taken a lot out of me to always put forth the effort and get nothing in return the majority of the time. I mean my brother gave me away at my wedding and I guess my father had a right to be upset but what about me who was always treated like poop and never talked to and called every bad name in the book.. Yes my father and his wife (not my biological mother).  So I had called the man 4 times in a month and sent a long ass email.. Two weeks, three weeks no call.. Then finally the "other one" (stepma) emails me back.. How she has been busy watching her kids children, or her grandchildren.. I don't get it. I have been trying so hard to give it another chance, this relationship that I am destined to have with my father.. Or lack of relationship would be more like it.. He can't call me back after 4 phone calls.. I know that no one is that damn busy. I bet the President can return his daughter's call. And I know my father is not more busy than the President! My point being I want to just cut the line of communication. I am sick of this. If he can spend all the time in the world with her children who I must say are not doing so well in life.. (both unmarried one with two children by two fathers, and the other with one child) One is living with them..  Yah.. AND I am the BABY of the family! I have been married 10 months to a man that I have been with for 4 years, we have a house, two "kids" (cats), good jobs and two "new"(03/04) cars. Now how on earth can I feel sorry for myself.. I am blessed.. Or just a hard worker.. I will go with the later.  I love my husband, house, cars, cats and sorta like the job for now. But I have a mother who calls frequently and drives me nuts, a father that would rather eat shit than talk to me for some god-awful reason, In-laws that are perfect, a niece/nephew, two more "nieces" and another "nephew" ( I say that because they are my best friends children so I think of them as such but they aren't really related to me by blood. ) I have worked my butt off to get where I am. I haven't been unemployed since I was 14 (ok maybe like a week after getting outta the MC but I had another job just hadn't started yet). I was an honor grad, I played volleyball, ran track and crosscountry, Was President and VP of Honor Society in HS (11& 12), I was the 1st Sgt of my Young Marines Unit, I was VP of SADD (11), Dare Role model (12),I did quiz bowl(12), band (9,10), science olympiad(9,10, 11) I donated more hours than I can count on my hands and toes to better my community (not because of court order either), and I worked full time as a manager at McD's. That was all in 4 years of HS. So I didn't sleep much but I still managed to have a social life and numerous not so great boyfriends.  Plus I faithfully served my country in the "BEST" service, the United States Marine Corps. Got out and got a job making more than a lot of my family members ever have all at the age of 23. So give me some damn credit please.  Ok enough of that rampage. I will not feel sorry for my self or try and build my self up. I have done what I wanted all my life. Now all I want is to win the lottery so I can pay off the house and cars. I want to join the peace corps. I need some good in my life again.  I mean truely good and that is only accomplished by helping other people. I know that my job helps but I want something else. I hate the lying, gossip, butt kissing, and anything else that you or anyone ethical would think to be UNethical Business Practices. Because that is what I see everyday and it is making me a miserable person and it is making me ugly inside because it is dragging me down to that level. I need some sort of leap of faith or something.  I can't sleep tonight because I know that I have nasty thoughts in my head and I hate it. I like to think of myself as a good, hard working person. I don't want to be the person I see myself changing into.  Help me..  Today was my husbands birthday and I think that I am having a midlife crisis only it is too early for that.. I am not old enough to feel so damn old. I want to be free. I want to believe like other people do that there is still some good in these people. I don't want to dance with the devil. I want to wake up in the morning and be happy because I have another day to live. I am not doing what I want right now.. And I know that if I die tomorrow I will regret it. I keep saying in a year.. Etc.. I don't want to wait that long I want to change now.. I want to be a better person I just am not sure how to start.  So I am going to try and sleep and dream of better things. Hopefully I will wake up with a solution..  C
