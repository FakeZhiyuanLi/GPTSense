      I've had a terrific day. It's been wonderfully productive. The football team was checked in with little incident, I cleaned my apartment, read, wrote, watched the Olympics, and now I just finished watching  The Hours .  Gymnasts are amazing!! I have a new found respect for male gymnists. All that they can do and all the strength it takes and all the flexibility it requires...well, it's just incredible to watch. I can't believe that they can twist and twirl like that on the pummel horse and hold themselves perfectly still on the uneven bars. It's amazing to watch!   The Hours ...what a movie!! This is about the third time I've seen it all the way through. I just love it. If you haven't seen it, rent it :) Even the third time the movie still touches me in a way that is unspeakable.  I'm listening to The Flaming Lips...

      Saturday morning. Man, am I glad to see the weekend. I've got a semi-busy day ahead of me. The football team arrives today so I'll be busy with that all afternoon, and after that I hope to clean my apartment from bedroom to living room, bathroom to kitchen. I plan on just hanging around the evening tonight, going with the flow and saving energy so tomorrow I can rip through some much needed office work.  I started to write a short story last night! Boy, do I love to write. I've never been all that good with writing fiction (I'm more of a non-fiction writer), but I've had this idea for a while now and I want to try it out. I really want to pour my heart into this and see how good or how bad the story will turn out. The plot and main ideas  still need a lot of fleshing out, but I'm off to a great start. If only I could living on the coast of Maine writing...ah... :) how nice would that be!!  I'm listening to Coldplay...  Quote of the day..."All words are pegs to hang ideas on."

      There's nothing quite like a late night run to Lance's. We went with the intention of getting ice cream, but we lingered about the store taking our time and picked up items at our leisure. Everything from the 5for$5 display to half-cakes for half-birthdays, to humus and enough butter on the shelves to grease the streets of North Manchester caught our eye. Then there was the bizzaro guy with the goofy, nearly psychotic grin on his face who rubbed his stomach a couple of times as he looked at cheese. He wandered throughout the store, no cart, no basket, no food in his arms, walking about in the most awkward and weird way. But this is Lance's and it was 11 pm.  In the end, our need for ice cream was met. Lori, Amanda, and I made off with fudge cicles in addition to other random items.

      What a week!! I've been working my ass off. I'm supposed to clean my apartment now, but I have zero motivation to do that. I just want one day where I can just think about stuff other than work, but a day like that is far beneath the horizon.  Though it's been a tough week, it's been a lot of fun. A remark Lori made about a bruise on my inner thigh has not only inspired a remixed version of Kelis' "Milkshake" entitled "Pork Chop," but also a little dance choregraphed by Buckmeister J. My Russian accent has also seen improvement. I managed to read an entire story in my best Russian accent. I salute not just Mother Russia, but also Oleg, who I must admit is the source of the accent. I think Boris, my identical Russian vodka importing cousin, would be proud.  Shazam, I'm tired. I can write no more. What will I do with the rest of my evening? Oh, there is so much to do, but I have so little energy or drive at this very moment to do. Wilco is playing in the background...I am happy.  Quote of the evening: "Take off your band-aid, coz I don't believe in touchdowns." Wilco

      I found myself on the couch this morning around 5 a.m. Still drunk from drinking my weight in Killian's, I stumbled my way into the kitchen, downed a huge glass of water and went back to bed...in my actual bed. The odd thing is that I remember climbing into my bed when I got back from the bar. So I must have had slept walked my way to the couch. How strange.  Yes, I had too much to drink last night. I had a fantastic time, but I didn't need those last two beers. What the hell was I thinking??!! It was nice, though, to have that kind of a release. Though I'm groggy now, I don't feel too hung over, but me thinks my hang over is lurking inside of me waiting to emerge later this afternoon. I used to never be hung over, and then I started to get hang overs, and now my hang overs sleep in and kick in much later the day after.  Last night kicked some ass. The Time Out is a quality establishment. The Usual Suspects provided the soundtrack for the evening playing everything from Alice Cooper to Collective Soul. I danced. Yes, I did dance. Not very well, but oh, well. I knew the evening was buzzing when the band kicked out "I Saw Her Standing There" (one of my favorite early Beatle tunes) and I danced like drunken fool. Everyone had a great time...afterall, alcohol is a great bonding tool. ;)  I still have no insight right now, but that's because I'm recovering from last night.  Quote of the day: "Ah, beer.

      I had a very nice shopping experience in Ft. Wayne today. Lori and I went to Sofa Mart, out to lunch at Sonic, then we ventured to Wal-Mart to take advantage of their everyday low prices. Now I'm back in my apt listening to Wilco. Without question, Wilco is one of my favorite bands. I've listened to  Yankee Hotel Foxtrot  about a dozen times in the past five or six days and the album just keeps getting better to my ears.  What does the rest of the evening hold for me? More than likely a visit to Adam's and then hopefully off to the Time Out for some drinks and the sounds of the cover band The Usual Suspects.  I'm not sure what to make of this blog. I figured I would have something of worth to write, but nothing comes to mind right now. Is this how my blog will turn out? Nothing more than a drab narrative of my day-to-day happenings. I hope not. I hope I can squeeze some wisdom out of my head and into this blog soon enough. I hope I can write something interesting and witty...which brings me to the quote of the evening...  "Marge, I think I hate Ted Koppel! Oh, wait, what am I saying? I find him informative and witty. Night." Homer Simpson  PS...I owe my inspiration for this blog writing to my new friend, Mandi! (I saw a link from her AIM to blogger.com) If you're reading this, thanks!! :)

      What will the day hold for me? Hopefully someting fun and exciting! :) I'm about to embark on a shopping trip in Ft. Wayne. I'll have more insights thoughts when I'm in a more insightful mood.  Quote of the day: "Just checking to see what condition my condition was in."
