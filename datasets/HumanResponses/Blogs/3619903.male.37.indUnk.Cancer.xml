      Damn good line from Bladerunner. And if anyone of you who has seen it and loved the movie, knows what I mean. But enough of movie speak...  Welcome to the woods! Don't worry, nothing here bites. Well, except for me. I can get rather brash and directly to the point, which can bite for some. But that is who I am. Shall we get started?  Okay... Your probably wondering (then again maybe your not), "who are you?" Easy enough... On the surface that is. I am 36, and a father of 5 year old twins (boy and girl), with one child on the way this August, they say... My wife will say otherwise. She wants it out ASAP. Poor girl. If this child is anything like me when I was born, she is in for an agonizing hell. I was a healthy 10 pound 9 oz baby (and two weeks late). The ultrasound tech says its a boy, but gyno thinks differently *shrug*. So here we stand in a conundrum. My wife so wants it to be a girl and agrees with the gyno. Myself? No preference. At this point we already have one of each, so it doesn't matter what sex, as long as the baby's healthy. But knowing how my son is, I am somewhat favoring the daughter path... But then again, knowing how my daughter is... See, conundrum.  I have three dogs, two huskies and a German Shepherd. Wonderful dogs, but the littlest husky has been displaying a bit of bad behavior as of late. She has started to express her behavior in chewing plastic bottles of various beverages, thereby leaving large puddles of drink on the floor. Be it water, pop (or 'soda' for those of you who don't call it that), Hi-C, etc. She has also been leaving little 'gift' piles and the random 'ponds' or should I say 'lakes' around. That little pup sure can hold a lot of water. Now don't get me wrong... She is house broken, she does tell you when she wants to go outside. But when she gets snubbed, she does these little tantrums. I dread the day when the baby comes home... *ugh* And Minnesota thought it had a lot of lakes.  Well... This was just my first post. So I don't want to wear out my welcome too quickly and have people dropping at their desktops in droves... Especially if your at work. How embarrassing. Hate to think I brought down a company with my post.  So before I leave, I just want to close with a little bit of...     NEWS THAT SHOULD BE X-FILED!   It seems that Homer Simpson's emphatic exclamation "Doh!" has topped a British poll of favorite TV comedy catchphrases, easily beating an array of home-grown classics.  The bumbling hero of American animated TV series "The Simpsons" -- who often accompanies his trademark saying with a slap to the forehead -- topped Nuts Magazine's poll with 34 percent of the vote.  "Doh" has even found a home in the Oxford English Dictionary, which defines it as:  "Expressing frustration at the realization that things have turned out badly or not as planned or that one has just said or done something foolish. Also implying that another person has said or done something foolish."   Well thanks for stopping by today, tonight, or whathaveyou! Until my next post..    TODAY'S BUMPERSTICKER!

      Gads, could this day get any worse... Well I suppose it could, but I digress. I had recently (as of July 15th) cancelled my auto-withdraws from my mortgage company for the month of August so I can get caught up on some bills before I start up again. They said that the July 16th payment will be returned to me in 7-10 days once it is processed which at that time would of been July 21st. Well seven days go by, no check... 8 days, nadda... 9 days, still nothing. I dread waiting for day 10.  But to make matters worse... My mortgage company made an unauthorized auto-withdraw from my account today! Which overdrafts my account by $220! And to add insult to injury, I get hit by an $25 overdraft fee. And I have an authorized auto-withdraw to be done later on today still! So this will tack on yet another $25 overdraft fee if this situation doesn't clear itself up damn quick. I'm still waiting on a phone call from my bank so I can do a 3-way call with my mortgage company to get the overdraft overturned and the unauthorized withdraw money reversed. Damn! I hadn't had a problem with any auto-withdraws before in the last 4 years of doing this, and suddenly get hit with this mega backlash of BS! Ugh!  If this doesn't get resolved soon, its going to bite the big one.... and hard!    TODAY'S BUMPERSTICKER!

      As of August 3rd, my wife gave birth to a 8 lb 14 oz. bouncing baby boy. The little boogers' got a set a lungs on him alright. Talk about a little yeowler! *chuckle* But soon after things settled down, he was sawing wood like nobodies business. Looks like we got a sleeper on our hands... Guess he takes after me. *chuckle*  Thanks for listening!
