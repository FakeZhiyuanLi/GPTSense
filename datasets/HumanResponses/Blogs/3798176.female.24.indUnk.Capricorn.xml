       I got a lot of the border done today but still a lot to go. Hope to be done by the end of the week. I also have a card to make which will be my first one in the summer theme. Not sure what im going to make and im kinda nervous being that i am sending it to someone that i dont know yet. Everyone tells me my work is great but i dont think its "that" great. I have only been stitching for about 3 months so i have a lot to learn. But we'll see how that comes out. I also have to make Toya's baby stitch and hang for her baby shower on the 24th but that wont take long a day or day and a half at the most. Well Im off to bed for the night we'll see how tomorrow goes.
