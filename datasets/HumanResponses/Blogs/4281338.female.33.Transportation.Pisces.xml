						   Well last night hubby and I went over to the neighbors and played the CashFlow game. It was very fun and it helped me to expand my context. I can see myself making those decisions and choices and getting on the fast track.... I will work on my accounts later today working to get them all caught up.... I need to know what my monthly cash flow is so that I can determine where we are and how to reach our goals.  OH biggest thing... Again there are no coincidences. I asked Corkie how they started their businesses. She told me that she hired a Rich Dad coach. I think it is so incredibly crazy that she is working the same plan that I want to work. And I put her down as someone to talk to about it. I think we can really help each other keep moving. I think I still want to buy the game for myself. I can see the value in it. It really did help me to expand my context. First things first... I need to get my own finances in order so that I know where I stand....

						   Well today I downloaded a couple of reports from  urlLink www.reimentor.com  and I also listened to the free teleclass. It focused mainly on buying and selling on the no money down thing. I think that there was some good information and I learned some terminology but I don't think that this is exactly what I want to do with real estate. I think that I want to focus more on building rental properties.  I will continue to read the "Retire Young Retire Rich" by Kiyosaki and tomorrow we are going to play his Cash Flow game. I am excited to sit down and talk with Corkie and Bill. I am on my way.... STAY FOCUSED.  One other thing, I also signed up to receive the newspaper everyday. I think that this will be a great tool for finding and researching properties and the market in our area. I also need to find out about joining the Chamber and attending city council meetings. I want to find out about goings on in this city. I have a second job now and I am working for free. :)

						   OK, so I have to write this out. During this process I have been reading Kiyosaki's Rich Dad Poor Dad books. Well last Tuesday I wrote down a list of people that I wanted to talk to about my plan. One of these persons was my neighbor. I also wrote down that I wanted to buy the CashFlow 101 game from Kiyosaki. Well today I started looking for the game on Ebay. I book marked 5 different sellers and I was going to watch them to try to get the game for less than the retail $195. Well tonight my daughter and I went for a walk and on our way back I noticed my neighbor was just getting home. I stopped to talk to her and somehow we got on the subject of real estate investments. She has been doing a lot of research on investing in commercial real estate.  I asked her if she had ever read any of the Rich Dad Poor Dad stuff. She said 'Oh yeah' I have a lot of them and I bought the game. Talk about making your own reality! WOW!!!!  Well we are going to get together Saturday and play the game and then go out to dinner. She also brought me over the book that I couldn't get at the library.  This is so right....  It feels like we are on the right track!  Jenny

						   Well here is the first post to my getting wealthy journal.... I just want to keep track of the steps that I take to reach my goal of becoming wealthy. The idea to invest in real estate came from my husband Curtis. I have always been the cautious one and so I have put this off for a really long time. I think now is the time!  My long term goals are to have $100,000 - $1,000,000 in passive income per year within the next ten years. I will be working on creating my plan to get there on these pages. The first step in the process is to get my own current finances under control and to have a plan for managing them. I want to achieve this short term goal within the next three months. This will need to be done for both my personal and business accounts. I need to take charge. So it is my goal to take control of my finances by the end of November.  These are the steps I am going to take to get there. 1. Get all account information up to date in Quicken. 2. Enter all spending in Quicken as it occurs. 3. Monday, Wednesday & Friday are data entry days. 4. Everyone in the family will be involved. 5. Every Saturday download and balance accounts in Quicken. 6. Review monthly spending and financials at monthly family meeting. 7. Create and follow a budget. 8. Minimize unnecessary expenses. 9. Learn how to read and understand financial statements. 10. Change direct deposit to place 10% of income in my investment fund, 10% in my charity fund and live off the rest. 11. Get and stay serious about this. 12. Listen to or read one motivational tape or book per month.  I can do this! I am already better off than so many and I have what it takes to make it.  In addition to this I am going to train my children how to manage finances so that they will not have to struggle the first 10+ years of adulthood...  Our first family meeting will be interesting. I have never done this before so it will be fun to see how it goes. The meeting agenda is: 1. Go over family spending for August. 2. Show kids the monthly calendar. 3. Schedule all known events on calendar. 4. Explain the budget process and get kids started on their budgets. 5. Explain the job postings and how they work. 6. Explain the daily tasks, what, how and expectations, and their division.  I have scheduled the first meeting for Sept. 4th at 10AM. We will meet at McDonalds and do this over breakfast.
