       After a few days of vacation with my grandparents up in northern Washington state, I find myself in Seattle. I'm diggn' it. Mostly, I suppose, we're in the city to check out colleges. Today we saw Seattle University and I liked it quite much ^^  Perhaps I'll find myself there next year~

       And so my life (and log) continue henceforth from this new location in space-time! I'm working on getting this all photo-documented but it's proven difficult by all kindsa' crazzy circumstances's'~~~111   We (my partner's-in-crime and myself) have acquired an abandoned office building, five-stories high. We simply found it unlocked (chain clipped by some-addicts, hoodlums, homeless, whatever) and put our own locks on it. The 'previous residents' destroyed almost every room of the huge building, glass, holes in walls, and other mess. We, on the other hand, are cleaning it up and moving in furniture we find on the street. Why? The feeling of power every time you see the key to the lock dangle from your key-chain. (The building is humongous, and would be beyond our dreams if it wasn't so thrashed-up!)  Going to Seattle soon so I'm working three days in a row at Homma's    'ts good eatin' if you likes yourself a sushi~

       Oh. Yes, something actually important..ish. Tonight is the last night I spend in this house. I wish I could document the event *needs camera*.  Actually, I have to disasemble this computer before I goto sleep- which is now.   Goodbye~   see you soon from a house across town!

       I got pulled over just now, driving my friends car who was, at one point atleast, rather intoxicated. The cop had me radar'd "as fast as 40mph" (I managed, though with difficulty, to keep a straight face, having been driving near double that seconds before)  no ticket! hurray for my charm and good manors, eh?

       I'm watchin 'Laundry', a cute japanese film, on a nice little all-encoding DVD player I just downloaded called VLC from videolan.org. Its quite wonderful.  But moreso, the movie. The movie is perfect for me right now (except that I need to sleep for school tomorrow). I love it.

       I just sugar loaded on brownies. I don't feel so great.. 気持ち悪い・・  My house is boxes! I can't find anything I'm looking for! I needed peanut butter, so I opened the cupboard and it was stark empty. Strangest feeling~  I wrote 知世　on my leg again with hearts. She was a friend of mine in Japan, and I have adopted her to be my stalk-ling. Yay! Shes cute.

       It seems almost everytime I look back on something big in my life, I see regret. There are many things I did so wrong, and I don't let go of them very easy. This is especially true of my time in Japan. So I'm realizing that maybe part of my  need  to go back to japan is a desire to fix some of those things. And thats the only place I feel I can go back to and really heal my memories. But, just for a moment, lets supose that I had. I returned to my school, my family, my friends and was true. I was myself and didn't act so self-absorbed, so asuming. I didn't pull away from everyone. I treated my family as they deserved. Would I still be regreting so much there? Would it ever go away? Or perhaps my thinking that the solution is to go back and try to fix things is just as silly and misconceived as my thinking the solution from my troubles here was to go to Japan.  Wow. That felt good.

       Last night I was looking up at Going Steady shirts and I was pleased with what I found. No clue how to buy them though, so I just kinda emailed it to my Host Sister to figure out (I feel kinda guilty about that one). Oh yeah, please forgive this obsession phase.  I work tonight, it seems.  We're moving! not far..just a few miles thata' way, but nevertheless it's a new house, and a new neighborhood. I will really miss my neighbors :(  things are in boxes all over the place. We have to be out by friday- actually I have to go carry some things from the neighbors garages here right now.  Maybe I'll see you at work..

       I worked from 4:45 and didn't get out until 10 tonight. Though, I do have money and do not have any real use of my time otherwise!  Man. I opened the old CD again just the other day and - everyday I like 'Going Steady' more and more!   !!! I'm listening to it right now!   so good!! !!!!!!!

       ..and that means summer school (a truly terrifying thing in my district, which includes the bay area's ex-murder king city. eep.) though today wasn't so bad! I must say it's possibly most because of sunday, the first time I had been able to sleep in. Having my host sister from Japan staying with me the past two weeks (I had been living with her family in yokosuka for a semester with AFS), trying to show her around, and keep her entertained was defiantly a stress. Though it was so much fun to see her again and introduce her to friends I told her about and shown pictures of, I am rather releived to have things back to normal. Mmm'hmm.  Well, I have work tonight over at "Homma's Brown Rice Sushi". Ah, I do so love it there. And in the meantime,  urlLink Trogdor  calls.
