      Today after work I am getting my hair cut and then I'm off to west Texas to see Crissy Anne.  It will be much fun, I'm sure, but I don't look forward to making the bulk of my drive in the rain.  All this rain seriously needs to cease.  Or Bubba is gonna have to build an ark.  Here's something I found odd.  I went to the chiropractor on Monday and had an amazing adjustment.  Oh and I decided I need to marry a chiropractor by the way.  Anyhow, my chiropractor pointed out that my muscles were all tight and tensed up on the left side of my body.  He said this happens because of engaging in mostly right-brained activities, such as doing a play.  Then he suggested that I read a book or do some algebra (I really hope he was kidding) to get my left-brain going, but if you know me then you are very aware of the fact that there is no chance of me engaging in either of these activies on purpose.  Not even one percent.

      I sure have felt extremely busy and more sleep-deprived than usual the last several days.  I can deal with being tired, I just have issues with being unpleasant to others...I don't particularly care for unpleasant people, so I really don't care to be amongst their ranks. Other than that things are going well.  I haven't been able to practice my guitar as much as I really think I need to.  Rehearsals are going fine and the show is coming together adequately.  I will say I'm ready to be done with it so that I can get rested up and be off to Snyder for my "vacation".  The boy I have a little crush on talked to me yesterday.  This made me nervous and uncomfortable of course.  I love how I act like I'm twelve.  I have an audition for another paying job on Saturday.  Wish me luck!

      West Side Story is over and behind me now.  It was fun but I'm really glad that its done.  I had fun I suppose and it was a good experience.  But I will say I have never felt so unconnected from a cast.  The boy I was crushing on is very odd.  I don't know what to think about him.  One thing I've been doing here at work is something I would classify as questionable behavior: I've been eating a lot of slim jims.  The beef jerky stick things.  They're so good though!  My favorite part is reading the ingredients, such as mechanically separated chicken.  I don't know what that means, and I should probably be concerned.  But somehow I know that even if I did have knowledge of what mechanically separated chicken is, I would still willingly ingest such products.  Somehow I managed to sort of injure myself this weekend.  But not really...its just that my tailbone is bothering me somewhat.  And when I'm concentrating on that fact, like now, its increasingly frustrating that I simply cannot do anything about it.  But not to fear, for as chance would have it, I am seeing my chiropractor this afternoon.  My chiropractor...James...a gift from God...James...oh wait what was I talking about?  Last night me and Jennifer went to see the Joe Nichols concert.  It was so much fun...and I wasn't even abusing any substances!  I did however get to join the ranks of all the white trash running around with their bare feet covered in mud.  I promise this was not planned and I could not avoid it.

      Alright, I'm not much of a birthday person.  But it is my special day, so I figure I will probably waltz into Taco Bell completely free of guilt and order a number five with an iced tea and waltz right back out after filling my bag up with approximately seventy-three packets of fire sauce.  Its not that I'm trying to lose weight or anything, I'm just trying to not make Taco Bell a priority in my life, so I decided to limit how much of it I have.  I tend to be obsessive over anything that I find appealing.  It really wouldn't be difficult for me to seriously drop by Taco Bell everyday.  I just got a mental picture of me actually walzting around this fast food establishment.  I don't think I could really do that without facing serious consequences.  At least not in my town.  I don't think anyone here at work knows its my birthday.  And that is really how I prefer it.  I'm never in the mood to stand around and smile at all the people that I don't know that come in from the plant to have birthday cake every time someone turns a year older.  And I have only witnessed on of the other guys that works here wash his hands after he uses the bathroom, and he only does this occasionally...people, seriously, WASH YOUR DAMN HANDS!  I hardly talk to anyone here anyway.  And I hate being the center of attention.  After August 22nd I am going to need to find some way to maintain an income.  I'm not looking for a career, just a job.  Or a winning lottery ticket.  If anyone has any ideas for a job or a winning lottery ticket to spare, please let me know.  The end.

      Okay, I know that's probably rather gross. But I guess its just that time of year.  Of course, it has been that time of year for the last six months or so.  What is a boy to do?  And why do I always think of my friend Amy when pearl necklace enters my thoughts?

      Me and Crissida are going to be singing at some fourth of July festival in Snyder in a couple of weeks.  Hilarious, I know.  So I've been going through my karaoke CDs trying to pick out songs for us.  I don't think normal people have their own personal collection of karaoke tracks.  Anyhow, it should be fun.  Poor Crissida has to deal with all this country music, but she'll get over it. I'm also trying to pick out some tracks for a video audition I'm submitting for a cruise ship job.  I think it might be fun to get hired to do something like that for a while.  At the very least it will give me an income and get me out of Texas for several months.  Rehearsals are going well.  Only a week and a half until its all done!  I can't believe how fast this show has been going by.  But I'm totally okay with that.  It is fun though.  A few weeks ago I was in the supply room here at work and I was bored so I started nosing around.  There is a refrigerator back there, so I thought I would take a peek inside.  Full of beer.  Rows and rows of Budweiser.  I kid you not.  Why has no one told me of this!?!  Of course, its in our rules that we're not supposed to consume alcohol here, but I guess if your the president of the company and you made those rules in the first place, it really doesn't matter. Then yesterday I'm sitting here and Mr. president asks the shipping clerk to go to Mr. president's car and take the case of whiskey out of the car and bring it to his office.  A case of whiskey.  In his office.  I need to be the president of a company.  But I figure this gives me license to fill up my little flask and bring it to work with me.  So long as no one catches me of course.  I haven't taken action on this yet, but I really don't think its that big of a deal.  And its not like I'm going to be getting hammered in my cubicle...I'm just going to be friendlier and less bored.  I promise not to turn out like that drunk lady in the movie 9 to 5.  The end.

      That's what it said in an article I just read about the do's and don'ts of office attire.  As I finish reading this sentence, I immediately look down admiringly at the flip-flops I am sporting today.  I really don't work in a typical office environment where people dress up all business-like...I think I'm the only one who doesn't wear shorts to work...but I know I am the only one who wears flip-flops.  I've even had a couple of comments about it...not good comments.  They have been referred to as my "bare-foot shoes".  Yes, it is fairly redneck around here.  Will I continue to wear my bare-foot shoes to work on a regular basis?  You bet your ass I will!  There's nothing in the dress code against it.  And if I am subjected to unintentional viewing of old people's pasty chicken legs then they can just deal with my feet. And then I think about why...I love flip-flops.  Love them!  They're shoes for people like me that don't like to wear shoes.  Well, that's my reason anyway.  So me and Brad drove to Houston on Friday for that audition.  Neither of us got called back, but it was an enjoyable trip for me.  I wish that some of my friends that don't do these kinds of things could witness what goes on.  Now I've been around large amounts of homosexuals before...but you really should have seen the holding area at this audition.  It was gayer than Christmas.  I'm allowed to say that.  Maybe its just me, but I think that if you're auditioning for a show in which you want to be cast, you really shouldn't show up dressed like an International Male model unless you're trying to get cast in a girl role.  Seriously people.  Then again, I suppose, to each his own.  Oh that and I didn't get called back so maybe I just don't know what I'm talking about.  Two people I talk to on a daily basis: Adam and Crissida.  Adam is away at some music thing, I'm not sure what it is...it really sounds like band camp for old people.  Sad, I know.  But he is busy and so am I so it has been difficult to talk to each other except via voice mail.  And I haven't heard from Crissida since last week when she was on her way to the airport to pick up Mark, another married guy she's in love with or whatever.  All this is fine, I understand that there are times when my friends simply cannot talk to me.  But I think it might be my time of the month or something and I really need to talk to them.  And then there's Lisa.  One of my best friends who I rarely get to talk to.  But she seems to know exactly when to call.  Thanks Luh!  I will be seeing you soon!  Guess what...I have a crush!  Yes, its true.  But it really is just a small small crush and that is all its going to be.  Just thought I would let you know.  Okay, I must say that this has been an entry of most random thoughts.  But you know me.  The end.  PS - Three more things:  One - No one will think Sara is an idiot if she posts a comment on here.  She can't possibly sound stupid after I have said anything.  Two - If someone has tried to keep in touch with you several times and you do nothing to get back to them EVER, don't call them out of nowhere for some random reason and then tell them to stay in touch.  That makes you an asshole.  And three - The sun'll come out tomorrow...because tomorrow is my birthday!  Toodles!

      Last night I went to the Rangers game with the family.  Fortunately it was rained out.  I say this because I was still feeling slightly sick, but mostly just tired.  So we will be going next month sometime.  I need to be in peak condition to fully enjoy something like that. My truck is back to normal...praise the Lord! My new cd player is ten times better than the old one.  I just need to remember to take the face off everytime I get out of my vehicle from now until eternity.  Amen. Tomorrow Brad and I are going down to Houston to audition for the national tour of Oliver.  It should be fun...I'm glad I've got someone going with me this time.  The actual audition part is always an intersting experience.  Completely different every time, but always worth doing.  I was just trying to think of how many auditions I've done since I moved back to Dallas...and then I stopped trying to think about it.  I'm glad I don't get discouraged from not getting cast in a show, because I would have stopped auditioning a long ass time ago.  Persistence is key...or maybe I'm just a little crazy.  Or a lot.

      Ah yes, it has happened once again...my car got broken into.  Last night I was at rehearsal, not feeling too good.  I think I might have some sort of stomach virus or something.  So I decided to leave a little early since I was completely useless.  Oh but when I got to my little pickup truck I was greeted by a shattered window.  Yes, friends, they stole my cd player and my book of CDs.  Joy overcame my soul...except for the part where I was just incredibly upset.  I called the police and while I was waiting for them I called my dad.  Now, my dad likes to get mad at me when things like this happen.  So that didn't help the state of my emotions at all.  Everyone else at the theater was very nice and seemed genuinely concerned, but I still felt pretty sick.  Then the cop showed up and he was FINER THAN SHIT!  Unfortunately I was feeling too gross to let that really be of any consolation.  But seriously, he was a big beefy hot-ass man with a police uniform...yum! I just want to not be sick and for my car to be back to normal...is that so much to ask for?  PS - Luh, don't get me any more CDs ever because they will probably get stolen again.

      The term "birth" conjures up images in my head of screaming babies covered in placenta, blood, afterbirth, etc...which is probably why I never use that word.  Just a thought triggered by the title I just created for this entry. But, yes, I am starting a blog.  I'm not really quite sure of the reasons but at least it will give me something to do while I am at work.  Because, if you know me, you know there's not a whole lot to occupy my time at my current job.  But its low stress and it pays the bills.  I love how my boss sometimes just appears out of nowhere, like just now.  He has to know that I have nothing to do, but I do want to at least make it look like I'm working.  And when he comes along without any warning and I have to shuffle around and frantically try to cover up my computer screen with invoices I'm holding up I have to look like the biggest idiot ever.  But you know what, I think he probably goofs around online all day just like I do.  (**DISCLAIMER** If you are reading this and you are from my work, I'm just kidding) Seriously though, and I think he probably looks at porn a lot too.  There's this black and white print of this naked girl posed for some sort of body shot...its just there on his desk everytime I go into his office.  Its kind of disturbing actually.  Rehearsals for West Side Story are going well.  I'm doing well at tolerating an almost-intolerable person.  Is that a word?  I'm glad that this show does not have a long rehearsal period, but I am concerned about the outcome.  Its still a little early to tell.  But I'm sure it will turn out just fine.  If you've ever been in a play you know how it is, it all comes together at the last minute.  Unless you are Amy from Anything Goes and you make your cast rehearse for two freaking months!  That is okay too, as long as there are other people that like to go out and have drinks after rehearsals.  Or cute boys.  I had a sex dream last week and there was totally GBS going on!  First time for everything.

      Its that time again...I've got a new crush.&nbsp; On someone from tv of course, reality rarely counts.&nbsp; Its Seth MacFarlane, the guy who writes the show Family Guy.&nbsp; He has been on adult swim and he is SO CUTE!&nbsp; And funny of course.&nbsp; Yes I am aware of how pathetic I am.  Speaking of my patheticism, I had an&nbsp;AMAZING back adjustment yesterday...felt like I went to church!&nbsp; Oh, and my cutie-pie chiropractor totally slapped my ass.&nbsp; I don't think he meant to, especially since he was being observed by his staff doctor.&nbsp; It was like a locker room spank, not a gay porn website locker room, but a like a real one.&nbsp; I think.  &nbsp;

      So there is this guy who comes to my office approximately once a week to deliver the clean rugs and to pick up the dirty ones.&nbsp; Or something like that, I'm really rather clueless as to what goes on around here.&nbsp; I call him the rug man. The rug man is a decent looking fellow.&nbsp; Probably around thirty-ish.&nbsp; But he has an amazing ass...AMAZING!&nbsp; Now, if you know me well, then you know that&nbsp;I&nbsp;am not particularly an ass person, at all.&nbsp; But when I see someone that has an extremely good ass, I notice.&nbsp; How could&nbsp;I not?&nbsp; I just wish he would wear jeans ever. He is here right now.&nbsp;&nbsp;For some reason I find myself attracted to this man.&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps it is because he is&nbsp;the only&nbsp;guy around here that&nbsp;is younger than sixty.&nbsp; Or maybe even because of&nbsp;the plastic-looking black velcro shoes on his feet. Either way, this is likely the last day I will ever see him, as I am leaving this job at the end of the week. (insert a big ole 'YEEHAW!' here) Farewell, dear rug man, farewell!

      As you probably know, I have no life.&nbsp; Therefore, I have the time and energy to obsess over things like celebrities.&nbsp; I have the biggest crush on country singer Gary Allan.&nbsp; He is just SO CUTE!&nbsp; Anyway, I totally had a sex dream about him last night, although I must say I don't think there was actually any sex involved at all, much to my dismay.&nbsp; I'm sure if Gary Allan knew that there was some psycho-fag in Texas having sex dreams about him he would throw up in his mouth.&nbsp; Seriously though, if you don't know anything about him or his music, you should give him a listen...or at least look at some pictures.

      My dear friend Crissy Anne has been involved in a serious relationship for a few months now with yet another married man.&nbsp; I say that because this is not the first time this has happened.&nbsp; I understand that this marriage is only for citizenship purposes (his current&nbsp;wife's)&nbsp;or something like that, but I still take every opportunity I can to make a snide remark about it.&nbsp; Out of love, of course.&nbsp; And once again, she and the married man of choice are planning on getting married...after his pending divorce, of course.&nbsp; I truly am happy for her and I really think this one is legit and will work, even though I have yet to meet this man. &nbsp; But I was asked to be the man of honor at the wedding.&nbsp; In normal weddings there is a maid of honor, but this is obviously not going to be a normal wedding.&nbsp; Crissy Anne also made it known to me the others that she wants in her wedding party...one bridesmaid...the rest are guys.&nbsp; Gay guys as far as the bride's attendants or whatever she's going to call them goes.&nbsp; I have no idea about what the groom is planning on.&nbsp; This is all quite humorous to me but I think it would be fun.&nbsp; I have no idea on when they are planning on having the actual wedding but I do know the groom-to-be sent her out shopping for engagement rings.&nbsp; This is a very good sign, seeing how the last married-man-groom-to-be-who-also-has-four-kids never made that step.&nbsp; I don't think he could afford a ring.&nbsp; Or dental work. &nbsp; On another note, I had a couple of auditions this weekend.&nbsp; That went well but I don't know anything yet.&nbsp; Other than that my weekend was fairly calm and relaxing.&nbsp; I got to spend time with my neice.&nbsp; She's four and a half months old and seriously just about the most precious thing in the world.&nbsp; Until she starts crying.&nbsp; Then she gets handed&nbsp;to her grandmother. &nbsp; I'm going to turn in my two weeks notice this afternoon at work.&nbsp; I'm not really nervous about it.&nbsp; I just want to be done with these next two weeks.

      That's right, folks, only two more weeks of being an office bitch at a manufacturing plant in a town that no one has ever heard of.  Then I go on to be a professional dancer for three entire weeks!  Oh wait, that's not very long...I'm okay with this.  And then after that I become an office bitch yet again but for my father's company.    I also plan on becoming creative with finding other ways of making money.  Chances are high that I will be forced to resort to prostitution.  Okay, I wouldn't actually ever consider prostituting myself, although I have been on the receving end of some intersting offers from a few strange lonely men...not that I entertained these offers AT ALL.  The only action I took was to grab which ever friend of mine that was next to me (not doing anything to help me out) and briskly rushing off to somewhere, ANYWHERE, less gay.  And less prostitutionalistic.  The other day I tried to post an entry about gay boys and their cell phones.  I don't know why but it never posted.  I'm not going to rehash too much, but there is some kind of love affair going on there.  Its creepy really, but nevertheless entertaining.  I do not fit into this stereotype, I am proud to say, although I guess there is nothing wrong with it.  Except that there is something very wrong with it.

      After a brief hiatus from my writings here, I was urged by Chelsea this morning: "essscuse me surrr.. update your damn websizzite".  Okay fine.  As long as you post a comment on here ever, Chelsea.  Last weekend I got to go have myself a little vacation around west Texas.  I know, I know...but I really do like it there.  Well me and Crissy Anne were at this carnival in her town.  As soon as we walk up to the ticket booth there was an incident, of course.  The gayest carnie in the world was working behind the window at the time.  Crissy Anne said that we wanted wristbands (so that we could ride as much as we wanted).  To this the gay carnie man responded by asking her to come closer to the little hole in the window and muttered something quietly, directed towards Crissy Anne but he was eyeing me the whole time.  Well, naturally she couldn't hear him so he asked her to go around to the back of the building...but just her...yes, I was excluded from this.  I watched from a distance as the gay carnie man whispers something into my friend's ear.  She went blank and semi-shouted a "NO" and briskly walked away from him and grabbed my arm on her way out of this setting. "What?  What did he say?" I asked, "Tell me what he said!" I could see Crissy Anne thinking..."should I tell him?  I don't know if I should say...I'm telling him; I can't not tell him." "He asked me if you had a disability." Great.  Gay carnie man is asking if I have a disability.  You can't be serious.  Oh, but he did.  Now, I imagine that the typical carnie has to see many many different kinds of people in his line of work, perhaps even some with disabilities.  And he wanted to know for some reason if I was amongst their ranks.  Definitely a high point in my life.  I also managed to cause a scene later in the weekend atop an old abandoned hotel.  A group of us decided we would sneak into this old old abandoned hotel downtown.  Apparently before that we decided to act like we were fifteen.  Anyhow, we got all the way to the rooftop of the highest floor.  Coincidentally, this is the exact place where I decided that I would forget how to use a ladder and rip my left flip-flop off of my foot, tearing the flip-flop apart and rendering it unusable.  Ordinarily this wouldn't have been such an ordeal.  However, I now had to get back down a ladder and through a dark building with shattered glass and who knows what else laying around, all sans my left flip-flop.  I somehow managed to make it to the car without any injuries or run-ins with the law.  We also made it up to Amarillo to see Lone Star Rising.  It was a bit surreal but very enjoyable and, of course, I walked away with a crush.  Yes, a crush on some boy I will never ever see again.  I don't even remember his name, but that has never really been relevant.  Since I got back home things have been rather uneventful, which is probably a good thing.  I'm looking forward to a relaxing weekend without spending any money and doing as little driving as possible.

      Think of all the guys you know that are of the homosexual persuasion.  Now think of how natural it is to picture them talking on their cell phones.  Why is this?  Seriously people, there must be something very very gay about cell phones that make gay guys feel the need to wear them as some sort of badge of honor...a badge of homosexuality.  I do not include myself in this category, but I do have a couple of friends that most definitely fit this. In the unlikely event that I go out to gay Dallas, I always notice the hoards of fags along the sidewalks and in the crosswalks...nearly all of them talking on their cell phones.  If you've never been or you've never noticed, then you should check it out next time you're in that part of town, it really is quite amazing.  I really do think that they're actually all just talking to each other. If anyone has any explanations of this unexplained phenomenon, please inform me.  I really am interested in the cause.

      Here you bitches, I'm writing a new post.  I realize it has been a while but I have been sort of busy.  Plus I haven't been sitting on my ass in a cubicle all day every day, so that takes away from all that time I could use to write a post, balance my checkbook, stalk cute boys online and other things of such a random nature.  Rehearsals have been going well.  It is so wonderful to be in a cast of all these people who are so amazingly talented.  And I have four show crushes.  How awful is that!  But only one of them is a semi-serious psycho crush.  For real, there are some cuties in this cast!  The only thing I don't like about this show is waking up singing Disney music in my hea... now that's kind of a bitch.  Crissida came and visited me and we had a good time.  Except for the night where we got really drunk and went bowling and the next morning we had no recollections of things like what happened the night before, where all our money went, where her phone was, and what made us think that we were still young enough to do such stupid things.  But we found her phone at the bowling alley the next day and we had apparently taken many pictures of our drunk asses.  I will try to get some of those on here sometime soon for your viewing pleasure.  Right now I'm stuck in my house because there is a huge truck from the city parked in our driveway cleaning up the piles of brick in our yard that used to be our mailbox and our neighbor's mailbox.  Some genius drove right through them.  I'm sure they were sober, except for the part where probably not.  I'm just glad I wasn't awakened in the middle of the night with a big truck in my bedroom.  Oh yeah, they don't know who did it either.  Wonderful.
