      I just want to remind everyone: if I'm blessed enough to have a daughter, I'm naming her Anjali.  Anjali means "offering," "prayer," "hands folded in prayer," "honor" or "anoint," depending on who you ask.  I post this because I forgot to post my IM conversation with Pooja.  She was supposed to be named Anjali, but the 'rents picked Pooja for a reasons undetermined.  Either way, Pooja/Anjali: they mean almost the same thing, and the girl turned out all right.  She plays Zelda all the damn time.  That's good raising and mentoring from her brothers, I say.   urlLink Google Search: anjali meaning

      AliGold11 (1:55:45 PM): hey sachinag1 (1:55:48 PM): hey babe AliGold11 (1:55:53 PM): what's doing with you, mister? sachinag1 (1:55:57 PM): not too much AliGold11 (1:56:04 PM): update me on things. sachinag1 (1:56:06 PM): i keep getting rejected for jobs, even though they like me. AliGold11 (1:56:16 PM): what jobs? sachinag1 (1:56:27 PM): bearing point consultant and merrill lynch cdo banking sachinag1 (1:56:35 PM): and i'm still on hold for this other job AliGold11 (1:56:49 PM): ah.  but, at least you are getting interviews.  something will come along. AliGold11 (1:57:07 PM): it's frustrating, I know. sachinag1 (1:57:12 PM): well, those were kind of random.  sachinag1 (1:57:14 PM): it is. sachinag1 (1:57:14 PM): hey, i'm doing a blog made up entirely of IM conversations. AliGold11 (1:57:22 PM): ah. sachinag1 (1:57:23 PM): http://blog.sachinagarwal.com/ AliGold11 (1:57:59 PM): this is actually kind of amusing.  our conversations are never that amusing. AliGold11 (1:58:02 PM): who's john? sachinag1 (1:58:27 PM): one of my stern friends sachinag1 (1:58:32 PM): he's an m&a banker at merrill sachinag1 (1:58:37 PM): he has a good heart, but he's a republican sachinag1 (1:58:42 PM): purely for low tax reason AliGold11 (1:58:58 PM): that's retarded. AliGold11 (1:59:11 PM): I don't buy the whole "I'm socially liberal and fiscally conservative." AliGold11 (1:59:27 PM): If you're not willing to put your money where your mouth is then you aren't socially liberal. sachinag1 (1:59:31 PM): i keep telling him to give me his porn if he insists on being a republican. AliGold11 (1:59:38 PM): haha! sachinag1 (1:59:51 PM): it made him think. AliGold11 (1:59:57 PM): well, they simultaneously believe that the government shouldn't be involved with individuals' lives. AliGold11 (2:00:12 PM): and that they should be the determinator of all morality. sachinag1 (2:00:25 PM): yeah. sachinag1 (2:00:28 PM): it's fucked up. AliGold11 (2:00:30 PM): "The Determinator" a new flick from the Christian coalition. sachinag1 (2:00:37 PM): what? AliGold11 (2:00:42 PM): it should be. sachinag1 (2:00:46 PM): ah AliGold11 (2:00:47 PM): I was just making it up. sachinag1 (2:00:53 PM): it sounded plausible enough AliGold11 (2:01:05 PM): scary but true. AliGold11 (2:02:09 PM): "scary but true" is essentially my reaction to everything lately. AliGold11 (2:02:22 PM): all this stuff that I am doing on health care is 'scary, but true" sachinag1 (2:02:28 PM): bud selig is still commish sachinag1 (2:02:36 PM): what are you doing on health care? AliGold11 (2:02:51 PM): I haven't told you about my awesome new work stuff on health care? sachinag1 (2:03:11 PM): no... AliGold11 (2:03:37 PM): we are holding our summer meeting where we bring together 200 regional ceos, nonprofit execs and govt. officals. sachinag1 (2:03:45 PM): cool AliGold11 (2:03:46 PM): and we are basically proposing an agenda to do the following: AliGold11 (2:04:20 PM): 1) develop a regional workforce initiative that will connect hs grads, displaced workers, and workers reentering the workforce with job training in cna positions in the health care fields AliGold11 (2:04:48 PM): 2) develop a region-wide template for corporate wellness programs that can help businesses better manage their costs; sachinag1 (2:05:32 PM): cool AliGold11 (2:05:44 PM): and 3) (and increasinly more interesting) develop policy and programmatic ideas for pooling large businesses to demand transparency in information from health care providers in terms of quality of care vs cost; work towards IT improvements in health care... sachinag1 (2:05:52 PM): that'd beawesome. AliGold11 (2:05:57 PM): all this stuff. And basically, my boss has said, "it's yours, run with it." sachinag1 (2:06:20 PM): you should see if regional businesses would be interested in pooling their employees into one massive HC plan AliGold11 (2:06:26 PM): so, in addition to logistics and my usual communications/staffing stuff for tech comm. and emergency preparedness, I've been taking a crash course in health care. sachinag1 (2:06:31 PM): since people are likely to be job hopping w/i a geo area AliGold11 (2:06:36 PM): well, actually, that model isn't ideal. sachinag1 (2:06:39 PM): i know sachinag1 (2:06:43 PM): but as a stopgap sachinag1 (2:07:01 PM): i'm decidedly in the "expand the govt. employees health plan" camp AliGold11 (2:07:03 PM): well, everything is a stop gap, because I still believe that real reform can only be on a federal level. sachinag1 (2:07:08 PM): yip AliGold11 (2:07:49 PM): but, the problem with everyone being in one group (and this has been shown in small business pools or in pooling varying sized businesses) is that it hurts certain employers in terms of the costs that they pass along. AliGold11 (2:08:09 PM): essentially, orgs join a pool that allows them access to a provider that they might not meet the criteria for otherwise. AliGold11 (2:08:25 PM): as a result, they are "less healthy" than orgs that could join on their own or as part of a pool. sachinag1 (2:08:43 PM): true AliGold11 (2:08:55 PM): they drive up costs, and the "healthier orgs," who were controlling the costs for all, then opt out when they realize that they can get cheaper health care on their own. AliGold11 (2:09:09 PM): there have been a lot of experiments with it, and they've all failed, rather miserably. sachinag1 (2:09:48 PM): well, there you go. sachinag1 (2:09:53 PM): see, i haven't seen it all AliGold11 (2:10:03 PM): yes, I am very quickly becoming well-versed in these issues. sachinag1 (2:10:18 PM): i mean, if you forced them to join.... sachinag1 (2:10:19 PM): but yeah sachinag1 (2:10:24 PM): the opting out would suck AliGold11 (2:10:52 PM): yeah, well, forcing them to join isn't the way this country's gonna work ever, probably. sachinag1 (2:12:43 PM): yeah sachinag1 (2:12:47 PM): and im not in favor of it. AliGold11 (2:13:12 PM): agreed. AliGold11 (2:17:27 PM): but I am in favor of the Chicago Fire and keeper Henry Ring who has allowed only 2 goals in 5 games! sachinag1 (2:17:34 PM): amazing AliGold11 (2:17:45 PM): yeah, he's rocking like a hurricane. sachinag1 (2:17:58 PM): HERE I AM AliGold11 (2:18:21 PM): were you lost? sachinag1 (2:18:28 PM): ROCKING LIKE A HURRICANE AliGold11 (2:18:37 PM): haha. AliGold11 (2:23:17 PM): alright, back to the grindstone for me, Mr. AliGold11 (2:23:24 PM): have a good afternoon and I'll talk to you soon! AliGold11 signed off at 2:23:29 PM.

      WebDeskBob (11:39:19 PM): As much as I hate Glenn Reynolds, I'm glad someone's pointing out how much of a dick Nader is being about Michael Moore's weight. sachinag1 (11:39:19 PM): fun sachinag1 (11:39:35 PM): is that from votenader.org? sachinag1 (11:39:59 PM): his campaign mgr is my old imsa internship thing boss sachinag1 (11:40:04 PM): (whatever tehy were called) WebDeskBob (11:40:16 PM): There's that letter, and I guess that Nader told the washington post, "It's extremely serious. He's over 300 pounds. He's like a giant beach ball." WebDeskBob (11:40:34 PM): Your old boss is managing Nader's campaign? sachinag1 (11:40:37 PM): yeah, the dude's lost any sort of tact, perspective or anything sachinag1 (11:40:40 PM): yeah, teresa amato sachinag1 (11:40:45 PM): she ran it in 2000, too WebDeskBob (11:40:56 PM): I never thought you'd have worked for a republican activist.

WebDeskBob (11:48:37 PM): No, I mean, is that what you don't get? sachinag1 (11:48:45 PM): yeah sachinag1 (11:48:51 PM): this time around, at least. WebDeskBob (11:48:52 PM): Ok. sachinag1 (11:49:06 PM): it's not a smart career move, at the very very least sachinag1 (11:49:12 PM): and she's smarter than that WebDeskBob (11:49:15 PM): I don't get why nader's supporters/green party folk are calling for IRV. Paul and I were discussing this earlier, and I now believe that would further undermine them. sachinag1 (11:49:25 PM): nah sachinag1 (11:49:28 PM): i don't think so WebDeskBob (11:49:59 PM): I guess it might give them a possible long-term strategy, but in the short term, it gives the democrats even less incentive to kowtow to the far left, since they won't be splitting their vote anymore. sachinag1 (11:50:27 PM): what i would like to see would be a parlimentary-style system for the presidental election.  every state's electors are broken down by percentage sachinag1 (11:51:07 PM): if no one gets over 50%, then trading happens based on cabinet posts and whatnot to have pledged electors band together to put one guy/gal in the oval office. WebDeskBob (11:52:42 PM): Frankly, I'm opposed to anything that potentially increases the influence of far right- or left- parties, because I have more faith in the influence of the American far right than the far left. sachinag1 (11:53:14 PM): i think it would make the green and libertarian parties a bit more relevant sachinag1 (11:53:19 PM): and i think that's a fine thing sachinag1 (11:53:27 PM): cause there isn't any party for evil than the gop sachinag1 (11:53:37 PM): whereas there are dumber parties than the democrats sachinag1 (11:53:47 PM): green, marijuana party sachinag1 (11:53:56 PM): well, natural law and family whatever on the right sachinag1 (11:54:00 PM): but they're really not evil WebDeskBob (11:54:02 PM): There isn't now because the conservatives had their vote-splitting nightmare in the 90s. sachinag1 (11:54:42 PM): well, i think we can all agree that a weak president would be good. WebDeskBob (11:55:42 PM): I think the Christian and the Conservative elements of the Republican party would split into separate parties under a system that made third parties more viable - and I think you'd have, at times, the fundies exerting even more disproportionate influence. WebDeskBob (11:55:53 PM): We WebDeskBob (11:56:03 PM): We'd have a weaker president if it didn't happen that the Speaker of the House was in his pocket. sachinag1 (11:56:27 PM): well, we had our shot to have discipline in 93 and 94 and we fucked it up. WebDeskBob (11:57:32 PM): I suspect that the cooperation between congressional leadership and the white house in this administration is unprecedented, though I have no way of actually knowing. sachinag1 (11:57:51 PM): oh, absolutely sachinag1 (11:58:01 PM): the house has completely subjugated itself to karl rove WebDeskBob (11:58:20 PM): Thank God for senators and their massive, massive egos. sachinag1 (11:58:22 PM): at least there are like six moderate republicans in the senate sachinag1 (11:58:33 PM): i think kos' gerrymandering thesis is absolutely right. WebDeskBob (11:58:44 PM): I'm not familiar with it. sachinag1 (11:59:36 PM): the house is so divided b/c all the seats are ridiculously safe, lending to extreme elements of the parties winning the primaries, thus leading to a paucity of moderates in the house, and thus, a paucity of decorum or compromise WebDeskBob (12:00:45 AM): This is quite likely. sachinag1 (12:01:47 AM): it's a pretty simple thesis sachinag1 (12:01:50 AM): and it seems fair sachinag1 (12:02:10 AM): i mean, when peter king is about as far as a republican will stray, you've got DISCIPLINE

WebDeskBob (11:18:31 PM): Instead of my parents. sachinag1 (11:18:35 PM): it sucks. sachinag1 (11:18:42 PM): can look, but don't even think about touching sachinag1 (11:18:49 PM): she's getting old, tho sachinag1 (11:18:58 PM): a few more wrinkles in teh face than i thought sachinag1 (11:19:02 PM): but she's totally cool sachinag1 (11:19:03 PM): hot bo sachinag1 (11:19:04 PM): bod sachinag1 (11:19:09 PM): she's a personal trainer sachinag1 (11:19:13 PM): and she wears the sluttiest shit WebDeskBob (11:19:15 PM): damn. sachinag1 (11:19:17 PM): but NO TOUCHING sachinag1 (11:19:21 PM): goddammit WebDeskBob (11:19:32 PM): I could use a personal trainer, too, really. WebDeskBob (11:19:36 PM): Someone to kick my ass into shape. sachinag1 (11:19:39 PM): or a bad ass goatee. WebDeskBob (11:19:48 PM): You keep saying that. sachinag1 (11:19:49 PM): starving myself worked for me. WebDeskBob (11:20:00 PM): Harder when you're at home. sachinag1 (11:20:05 PM): but htat requires 1) discipline and 2) depression. sachinag1 (11:20:10 PM): probably true there, too. sachinag1 (11:20:12 PM): and laziness. sachinag1 (11:20:23 PM): being too lazy to eat helps with the starvation. sachinag1 (11:20:34 PM): actually, that was probably the biggest factor. sachinag1 (11:20:38 PM): my laziness is legendary. sachinag1 (11:20:44 PM): i wish there was a competition for htat. WebDeskBob (11:20:46 PM): Yeah, I'm really not quite that lazy. sachinag1 (11:20:50 PM): you're notl sachinag1 (11:20:53 PM): how unfortunatel. sachinag1 (11:21:01 PM): although, you don't have to cook, being home and all. sachinag1 (11:21:05 PM): maybe at uiuc. WebDeskBob (11:21:07 PM): True. sachinag1 (11:21:21 PM): i made some kick ass tuna melts when i lived in brooklyn. sachinag1 (11:21:28 PM): but that was about it, food-wise. WebDeskBob (11:23:14 PM): I haven't cooked in ages. sachinag1 (11:25:21 PM): yeah, me neither. sachinag1 (11:25:25 PM): i should probably learn. WebDeskBob (11:25:32 PM): Or get married. sachinag1 (11:25:45 PM): that's my number one priority right now. WebDeskBob (11:26:08 PM): See, I'm all about settling for meaningless sex. sachinag1 (11:26:10 PM): of course, finding the right chick - smart enough to make me alugh, dumb enough to marry me - seems like an impossible tast at this point. sachinag1 (11:26:25 PM): yeah, you know, i could have had that numerous times, and i can't bring myself to do it. sachinag1 (11:26:34 PM): i keep telling myself i want to do that, but i can't. sachinag1 (11:26:58 PM): of course, having chicks who are not hot does not help with the "should i have meaningless sex or not with her" question. sachinag1 (11:27:03 PM): so either way, you're not missing out. WebDeskBob (11:27:05 PM): True. sachinag1 (11:27:39 PM): did i ever tell you about the lesbian who couldn't stop sucking dick on the dean campaign? sachinag1 (11:27:44 PM): she sucked every dick but mine. WebDeskBob (11:27:48 PM): Damn. sachinag1 (11:28:05 PM): i've decided she really was a lesbian because she claimed to enjoy it and no girl i know enjoys it. sachinag1 (11:28:25 PM): i didn't know about this penchant of hers until the last night in NH sachinag1 (11:28:30 PM): or WI sachinag1 (11:28:33 PM): last night in WI sachinag1 (11:28:39 PM): by which time, it was too late. WebDeskBob (11:28:47 PM): I prefer being friends with girls who don't enjoy it, because I've had friends who do, and they won't shut up about it. sachinag1 (11:28:53 PM): but she definitely got manchester and the bedroom offices a few times. sachinag1 (11:28:59 PM): hmmm sachinag1 (11:29:05 PM): i don't have chick friends who talk about it. sachinag1 (11:29:25 PM): whatever. sachinag1 (11:29:30 PM): i just want to get married. sachinag1 (11:30:27 PM): also, i want the open DCI position.
