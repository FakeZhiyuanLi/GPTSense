      Water In romance, you lean toward qualities exhibited by Water Signs. You seek a mate who is kind and compassionate, not afraid to feel, someone to whom you can really bare your soul. You appreciate  romance  and sentiment, and though the man you long for may be a bit shy or innocent, he is very, very generous and open-minded. You'd probably love to be with a Cancer, a Scorpio or a Pisces lover. Read more about these Sun Signs to discover more about their motivations and desires. Air In romance, you're drawn to the qualities of an Air Sign. You're turned on by a man's intellect and sense of humor more than his net worth or fine physique. You desire a mate who will match you wit for wit and keep you up all night talking. Air Signs prefer to keep things light and even, so if you want love that's playful, you might be most turned on by a Gemini, a Libra or an Aquarius mate. Read more about these Sun Signs to discover more about their motivations and desires. Earth In romance, you lean toward qualities exhibited by Earth Signs. You're turned on by affluence and opulence. While you crave status and security, you also want a man with a sensual streak as strong as his stock portfolio. You like to take things slowly and make informed decisions, so you may find a Taurus, a Virgo or a Capricorn lover to be the sexiest match for you. Read more about these Sun Signs to discover more about their motivations and desires. Fire In romance, you're drawn to the qualities of a Fire Sign mate, someone ambitious, ardent and active. You don't like hesitant men -- you like a guy who'll take a chance and make the first move. Impatiently passionate, you need someone who will show you a good time -- and the world. You have a good chance of finding happiness with an Aries, a Leo or a Sagittarius man. Read more about these Sun Signs to discover more about their motivations and desires
