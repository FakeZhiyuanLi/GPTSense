      Well, I made it to graduation....sort of...After slipping by math with the scholarly final grade of a D minus, I acted like Chris Farley in the begginning of Tommy Boy and felt that it was neccesary to brag about my accomplishments to every man,woman and child within a mile radius. Well, not really, but I did call most of my close friends and family. (If you're reading this and wondering why I didn't call you...get over it.) Commencement went well, except for the part where I got the case with no diploma inside!:) The weekend was great, except for when I found out that I had to change my living arrangments because of someone backing out of a contract. I won't name names, but his initials are Tim Taylor.. (No hard feelings Tim :))Only four more weeks of college, and then I'll become as close to democrat as possible so that I can freeload off of society and milk the government for all it's worth until I finally land a job. At this point, any chance of actually landing a journalism job seems about as realistic as bumping into Tom Hanks at Merritt Square Mall. (I'd say more like...one in a million.'- 'So you're telling me there's a chance!'- Dumb & Dumber) Speaking of Merritt Square, the new theater there is amazing. As my good bud Stacey said, the theater's motto should be: Cobb 16- "Can you believe you're in Merritt Island?". We saw day after tommorow and it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be and they didn't really push an agenda like all the media was saying they would. That's truly a first! Well, I've already typed way more than anyone would want to read so I'll stop.

      Well, it's finals week and you know what that means! THE NBA PLAYOFFS ARE HERE! No but seriously, what can be more stressful than finals week? I don't know....maybe not having any job leads for when you're done with school huh? Anyway, this is my first post so it sucks. Sorry.

      Ok, so summer school officialy sucks. My sanity is seriously dwindling with each day. At the same time, I'm not so sure that I'm ready to leave college behind. Not a good situation to be in. Go Pistons!
