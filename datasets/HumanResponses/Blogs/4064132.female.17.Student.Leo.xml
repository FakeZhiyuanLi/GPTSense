      Alryte I know y'all don't know me...well some do that are looking at this but most don't.&nbsp; Why the hell does love have to be so messed up?&nbsp; Well most of&nbsp;life is the confusing but I mean why can't this love stuff&nbsp; just be straight forward? I am in love. I love this dude with all my heart and he said he loved me too. But now it's all crazy. I'm learning to except we are just friends now but everytime I talk to him my heart aches. And I am crushing on this other dude. Which I never thought could happen. I always said if u love someone you couldn't look at another person like that. But I am not and it's screwy. And I don't wanna like this guy. It's just we have alot in common and at the same time we have things that make us different and would give us our time. So I'm all wacked out. I need someone to tell me what is up!

       So yeah some bitch named Misty got my friend Rick put in jail last night and I found out about it today. They are like married and way older than me but I dunno. That totally blowed when I found out. Why should a man be put in jail for defending his daughter from her mom who is beating her? FUCKED UP!!! if you ask me!! She sucks...she'll get what she deserves though.  Got a new tounge ring today...rainbow. And it's plastic so it won't chip my teeth anymore thank goodness!! That was exciting. But they are expensive!! $15 for just one!! That's crazy dude.  I LOVE YOU ERICA!!! Just so everyone knows and so she knows! You are the best friend I could have! I am so glad you are in my life. You know I am here if you ever need me! You rock my world girl!  And I didn't get to talk to Kyle but for a minute today which made me sad! But I got to tell him good night. Which is all that matters I guess. Long as he knows I am always thinking about him. Even when I am being stupid!!

        Friends are so fun. They get you good and worked up. Yet ex's do the same thing...Imagine that. Yet all around today was an ok day. I had a good time playing with the Pit Bulls...I had a good cry with the ex boyfriend...I had a bitch session with a friend. It was an average ordinary day. A.. you got me good and pissed you know I love you man but don't come to be saying you fucked up and then tell me you are just going to go fuck it up more...cuz if you cared you wouldn't do it. I would help you in anyway possible to get you on your feet and back on track. You know that. I wouldn't let you go down hill. And K...you made my day complete...I love you...you are so sweet yet you can kill me sometimes...and you know it. PHAT AND DAZY YOU ROCK MY WORLD YOU ARE THE BEST DOGS...ok sorry. Just a good day.

       I wake up some days thinking I am over him. Then others I wake up thinking how can I like without him? Today is one of those days. I love this man and would marry him in a split second. Yet he makes me feel so horrible and worthless inside sometimes that I don't understand that I love him. And there are others that like me. That would treat me nicely and do what I would wish of them. But why is it that my eye is set on him? I want him so badly I can taste him. I don't know what I did to lose him. I wish he would tell me. But he barely tells me his name anymore. I am so lost without him there to listen to my problems and give me advice, telling me it's all ok. Sorry if this is just a bunch of rambling but it's just my thoughts.  Yet there is a man that does love me and would die for me...but I push him aside. What is wrong with me?

       I don't have many friends and when I do get one I keep them close to heart. Meaning you screw me I'm willing to forgive and forgive and forgive no matter. Every once in a great while one will push me to an edge but that is very rare. Ben you are one of the friends I have never had a fight with and I fineally do and you want to end our friendship over it? I'm not willing to give up that easy. So I tried. But you say you are sure you don't want me around as a friend no more. Long as you know I tried and know I am going to be here for you when you decide you want me in you life. And I will hold no grudge to you. I'll always be your friend...you decide when you want to be mine.

        Today rocked my world! I fineally after 4 years of wanting it got my tounge pierced! I was so nervous I was shaking when I walked into the parlor. My mom of course had to sign. But then she bolted after chick told me how to take care of it. My mom is weird and can't watch stuff like that. And to be honest. It didn't hurt as bad as I thought it was going to. The only thing I felt was a pinch. So yes now I am excited.          E just know that I believe that you will work everything out and just know that I am here for you no matter what it is that you need.

       I didn't get to see my father on my birthday, so he droped by today. My father and I don't get along very well. Very different views on everything. But he wanted to take me to a nice dinner and out to do something nice. So I picked McDonalds and to go play pool in a bar. He LOVED that...not. But he did it for me anyways. We had a GREAT time. I really enjoyed my time with him. It really made my day that we had a great conversation.

      Just for you guy...  Yes, it was my birthday. The suckyest birthday I've ever had. Or close to it. I had only 4 of my friends call me, and no family members call me. So in short only my mom told me and a few friends from online who I had been gloating to for a few days. I went to work today with my landlord. Which wasn't so bad but he had forgotten it was my birthday too. Then I went to dinner with my mom and a friend...to IHOP and got my usual...if you know me you know what it is. Then just chilled with my girl. So in short it was like any other day. So thank all who membered and fuck all who didn't care enough to give me a call.

       This weekend blowed the big one. I don't understand friends. This kick ass guy, I was diggin on wanted to hook up and meet sometime this month. Well we were just talking and he gets totally pissed cuz of a personal oppion.  Over something that actually isn't that important. I was willing to let it fly but he talked mad shit and I wanted to know what was up with that. Now he has decided that we no longer need to speak and yada yada. Totally crappy. I miss him a bunch. Then had a plan to chill with a group of my friends this weekend for my birthday on the 3rd. Man was that the wrong idea.  Some never showed, some showed and were total dicks. My good friend whom is like a bro to me canceled and didn't tell his wife then came later with his wife and fought while here. It was a mess. Note...don't see The Village...Totally confusing.  Then my guy from a diff city came to chill. And he crashed. It was great to spend time with him and just be normal. Even though I was crabby. But then my best friend had to go and flirt with him. Knowing I'm into him and what not. I dunno pretty sucky.
